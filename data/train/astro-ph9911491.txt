    "the wide - field redshift surveys of galaxies and quasars , like the two - degree field ( 2df ) and the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) , are key projects in the area of observational cosmology .",
    "these surveys provide three dimensional maps of the distribution of cosmological objects extended to high redshifts .",
    "the spatial distribution of the objects depends on various properties of the universe such as , initial density fluctuations , formation process of the cosmological objects , bias mechanism , luminosity function , cosmological parameters , and dark matter .",
    "the comparison of the observational data with theoretical predictions will put serious constraints on the cosmological models .",
    "especially the precise measurement of the power spectrum from the galaxy surveys is a promising project for the cosmological parameters and the initial density fluctuations , as well as the measurement of the cosmic microwave background anisotropies .",
    "two - point correlation function and the power spectrum are the most used tools to quantify the clustering of the cosmological objects . from a theoretical point of view",
    ", these statistical quantities that are well defined on the constant - time hypersurface have been used so far . however ,",
    "cosmological observations are carried out only on a light cone .",
    "this fact requires statistical quantities which properly incorporate the light - cone effect . for the 2df and sdss surveys the light - cone effect",
    "becomes important because of the depth of the samples .",
    "this importance of the light - cone effect was discussed by several authors ( matarrese et  al .",
    "1997 ; matsubara , suto , & szapudi 1997 ; nakamura , matsubara , & suto 1998 ; de laix & starkman 1998 ; moscardini et  al .",
    "recently , a rigorous framework to incorporate the light - cone effect into the two - point correlation function and the power spectrum has been developed ( yamamoto & suto 1999 , papar i ; nishioka & yamamoto 1999 , paper ; suto et  al .",
    "1999 ; yamamoto , nishioka , & suto 1999 , paper ) .",
    "the other important observational effect is the redshift - space distortion .",
    "because cosmological surveys are carried out in redshift space , the peculiar velocity of sources distorts the distribution of the cosmological objects .",
    "this effect has been extensively investigated in linear theory ( davis & peebles 1983 ; kaiser 1987 ; hamilton 1998 ; szalay , matsubara , & landy 1998 ) and also in a nonlinear regime ( cole , fisher , & weinberg 1994 ; suto , et  al 1999 ; magira , jing , & suto 1999 ) .",
    "it has been also pointed out that the geometrical effect originating from the expansion of the universe causes another apparent distortion in the distribution of cosmological objects , i.e. , cosmological redshift - space distortion ( alcock & paczynski 1979 ; ryden 1995 ; matsubara & suto 1996 ; ballinger , peacock , & heavens 1996 ; suto , et  al 1999 ; magira , jing , & suto 1999 ; matsubara 1999 ) .",
    "though the authors in these previous works have focused on determining the cosmological parameters by using the cosmological redshift - space distortion , we note that the cosmological redshift - space distortion gives rise to a problem in determining the power spectrum because the cosmological parameters of the universe have not been well established .",
    "in this paper we focus on the power spectrum on a light cone , taking into account the redshift - space distortion effects .",
    "we derive formulae for the power spectrum in a rigorous manner and examine how these effects distort the power spectrum measured in wide- and deep - field surveys .",
    "we adopt the following strategy .",
    "we first define an estimator for the power spectrum which can be computed from a sample of cosmological sources on a light cone , according to the conventional fourier analysis .",
    "then we calculate the ensemble average of the estimator , which we define the power spectrum on a light cone . comparing this with the conventional power spectrum defined on a constant - time hypersurface in real space",
    ", we show how the distortion appears in the shape of the power spectrum on the light cone quantitatively , modeling galaxy and quasar samples which roughly match the sdss samples .    in the present paper we work in linear theory , which enables us to derive formulae in a rigorous manner",
    ". however , this limits the validity of our results only to the large scales because the nonlinear effect affects the clustering features on the small scales .",
    "so the extension to include the nonlinear effect is needed , and a plausible extension is discussed in paper .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in  2 we define the statistical estimators of the power spectrum and the two - point correlation function on a light cone .",
    "we will find that a familiar conventional relation between the power spectrum and the two - point correlation function , which is defined on a constant - time hypersurface , holds even for those thus defined on the light cone . in ",
    "3 we consider the linear redshift - space distortion effect on the power spectrum . some parts in this section have been discussed in paper . however , the approximate formula to incorporate the linear redshift - space distortion , which was introduced in paper   in an intuitive manner , is derived in the rigorous manner in the present section . and",
    "the validity of the approximate formula is examined in detail assuming galaxy and quasar samples . in ",
    "4 we consider the cosmological redshift - space distortion effect",
    ". then the rigorous and the approximate formulae for the power spectrum on the light cone are derived .",
    "then we examine the validity of approximation , and discuss the theoretical implications .",
    " 5 is devoted to summary and conclusions . throughout this paper",
    "we use the unit in which the light velocity @xmath0 equals 1 .    for definiteness , we adopt notations similar to those in paper , and use a superscript lc to indicate quantities on the light cone explicitly . the power spectrum without the superscript",
    "@xmath1 denotes the cdm power spectrum defined on a constant - time hypersurface at present .",
    "and we use subscripts ( superscripts ) r and s to indicate quantities in real and redshift spaces , respectively .",
    "in this section we first define statistical estimators for the two - point correlation function and the power spectrum of cosmological objects on a light - cone hypersurface defined by an observer in redshift space .",
    "we define the statistical estimators for the two - point correlation function and the power spectrum , independently , which can be computed when a set of a survey catalog is obtained",
    ". then we will show that a familiar fundamental relation holds between thus defined two - point correlation function and the power spectrum .    in a redshift survey , a position of a cosmological object",

    "the distortion due to the linear peculiar velocity field of cosmological objects is called as the linear redshift - space distortion . in this section",
    "we consider the linear redshift - space distortion under the assumption that the cosmological model is exactly determined .",
    "an error of assuming the cosmological model causes another distortion , i.e. , the cosmological redshift - space distortion , which will be investigated in the next section .      in this subsection",
    "we first calculate the two - point correlation function , taking into account the linear redshift - space distortion .",
    "formulation is developed within linear theory of density perturbations based on the cdm scenario . because the definition of the two - point correlation function is different from that in the previous paper ( papers ) , derivation of the formula is slightly different from the previous one .",

    "comparing the exact and the approximate power spectra , we see that the approximation is fairly good for @xmath131 . on the larger scales ,",
    "the exact power spectrum approaches a constant value , and the deviation between the exact and the approximate formulae becomes large .",
    "this behavior originates from the fact that the corresponding wavelength becomes larger than depth of the survey volume at the large scales , @xmath132 , and that we can not properly evaluate the power spectrum because of the finite size effect of the survey volume . for comparison ,",
    "the cdm power spectrum defined on a constant - time hypersurface at present is plotted ( dashed line ) .",
    "note that in this case the cdm power spectrum is identical to the galaxy power spectrum on the constant - time hypersurface because we have adopted the case of no bias .    to quantify validity of the approximate formula , figure @xmath133 plots the power spectra for the galaxy and quasar samples , which are divided by the power spectrum on the constant - time hypersurface at present .",
    "the solid line expresses the exact power spectrum and the dotted line does the approximate one ( [ eq80 ] ) in redshift space . for comparison",
    "we show the case in real space , where we refer the real space to the case @xmath134 in the formulae .",
    "the short and the long dashed lines express the exact and the approximate power spectra , respectively , in real space .",
    "it is apparent from figure @xmath133 that the galaxy power spectrum is increased by the linear redshift - space distortion which dominantly contributes to the galaxy sample .",
    "the light - cone effect is not so effective for the galaxy sample because the sample is shallow",
    ". nevertheless it can be notable that the light - cone effect decreases the amplitude of the power spectrum by order of several percent .",
    "on the other hand , the quasar power spectrum is significantly decreased because the light - cone effect is effective for such a deep observational field .",
    "however we should remind that the behavior of the power spectrum significantly depends on the time - dependence of the bias , which determines the amplitude of clustering at high - redshift ( see also figure [ fig4 ] ) . in each panel",
    ", we see that the approximation reproduces the exact power spectra fairly well for @xmath131 for the galaxies and quasars samples .",
    "thus we conclude that equation ( @xmath135 ) provide a good approximate formula for the power spectrum on the light cone for @xmath131 .    here",
    "we briefly mention the nonlinear effects on the power spectrum .",
    "while the nonlinear evolution of density field enhances the amplitude , the finger - of - god due to the random motion decreases the amplitude in redshift space .",
    "according to the result in paper @xmath136 , the amplitude is decreased by order of several @xmath137 relative to its counterpart in linear theory for both galaxy and quasar samples , depending on the scale @xmath96 and the cosmological model .",
    "this situation is clearly shown in figure 2 in paper , from which we see that the nonlinear effects are effective for @xmath138 . because we have not taken the nonlinear effects into account throughout the present paper , figure @xmath139 in the present paper",
    "does not show the decrease of the amplitude at the small scales .",
    "the difference between the figure @xmath139 and figure 2 in paper at small @xmath96 is caused by the finite size effect of survey volume .",
    "finally in this section we discuss dependence of cosmology .",
    "figure [ fig4 ] plots the factor @xmath140 as a function of @xmath141 , where @xmath99 is defined by equation ( [ defalpha ] ) .",
    "the solid and the dotted lines represent the factor @xmath140 in redshift space and real space , respectively .",
    "here we adopt the same model for the galaxy and quasar samples as in figure @xmath133 . from figure [ fig4 ]",
    "it is apparent that the light - cone effect and the linear redshift - space distortion becomes more influential as @xmath141 increases .",
    "this will be traced back to the linear growth rate of density perturbations .",
    "for the galaxy sample , the increase of amplitude due to the redshift - space distortion is more effective than the decrease due to the light - cone effect .",
    "in contrast to this , for the quasar sample , the light - cone effect and the time - evolution of the bias become important .",
    "0lcn^ the crucial point of our investigation in the previous section is the assumption that we know the exactly correct cosmological model of the universe . because the redshift @xmath2 and the direction @xmath3 are the observable quantities of objects in the redshift survey , then we must assume a cosmological model to obtain a three - dimensional map on which the cosmological objects are plotted .",

    "the exact power spectrum approaches a constant value at the large scale , and the deviation of the exact formula from the approximate formula becomes large for @xmath193 .",

    "although we here adopted the scale - independent bias model , the distortion of the power spectrum depends on the scale @xmath96 .",
    "the location of the peak of the power spectrum is moved , due to the redshift - space distortion .",

    "that is , the long dashed line shows the case when the cosmological redshift - space distortion is not effective , and it merely shows a contribution from the light - cone effect . comparing the solid line and the long dashed line in the lower panels ,",
    "we conclude that the cosmological redshift - space distortion is an important effect not only for the quasar sample but also for the galaxy sample in estimating the power spectrum .",
    "the cosmological redshift - space distortion affects the power spectrum at the @xmath198 percent level for the galaxy sample . for the quasar samples ,",
    "the effect becomes more significant .",
    "moreover we should note that the behavior significantly depends on the time - evolution of the bias model .",
    "in the present paper , we investigated the power spectrum of cosmological objects on a light cone focusing on the redshift - space distortions in linear theory of density perturbations .",
    "we developed theoretical formulations to compute the power spectrum which properly takes into account the light - cone effect and the redshift - space distortion effects .",
    "the linear and the cosmological redshift - space distortions were considered in section 3 and 4 , respectively .",
    "the formulae for the power spectra were derived in the rigorous manner starting from the first principle corresponding to the fourier analysis . using the distant observer approximation , we derived the approximate formulae ( eqs.[[eq80 ] ] and [ [ d3 ] ] ) , and examined the validity and the limitations .",
    "it was shown that the approximate expressions are useful to describe the effects properly .    applying our formulae to galaxy and quasar samples which roughly match the sdss survey",
    ", we showed that the effects considered in the present paper become important for on - going wide and deep surveys like the sdss and 2df surveys .",
    "let us summarize the results and the implications obtained in this paper .",
    "for the galaxy samples , the light - cone effect decreases the amplitude of the power spectrum several percentage points ; the cosmological redshift - space distortion can distort the power spectrum by order of ten percent ; and the linear redshift - space distortion increases the amplitude by order of several @xmath199 percent , depending on the cosmological parameters .",
    "the power spectrum is rather insensitive to the time - evolution of the bias model for the shallow galaxy samples ( paper @xmath200 ) . for the quasar samples ,",
    "the linear redshift - space distortion can be a minor effect , and the light - cone effect and the cosmological redshift - space distortion are the influential effects .",
    "of course the power spectrum significantly depends on the cosmological model and the bias model .    in the present paper",
    "we have shown the validity of using the approximate formulas at the small scales .",
    "our numerical calcuations have shown that the approximate formulas become invalid at the large scales for @xmath201 .",
    "let us briefly discuss the physical meaning of the discrepancy between the exact formula and the approximate formula .",
    "the terminology , exact , means that the formulas are derived from the definitions of the statistical estimator for the two - point correlation function and the power spectrum , which corresponds to a conventional data processing .",
    "then the exact formulas indicate how the finite size effect of the survey volume affects the two - point correlation function and the power spectrum .",
    "for the two - point correlation function the finite size effect decreases the amplitude of the correlation function at the large scales .",
    "for example the amplitude becomes zero for @xmath202 , where @xmath82 is the diameter of the survey volume ( see figure 1 ) .",
    "for the large separation ( for large @xmath127 ) , the sign of the two - point correlation function is negative , which implies the anti - correlation at the large scales",
    ". thus the finite size effect decreases the anti - correlation at the large scales .",
    "we suppose that this causes the large amplification of the power spectra at the large scales ( at small @xmath96 ) relative to its counterpart in linear theory .    because we worked in linear theory in the present paper , the behaviors on small scales ( at large @xmath96 )",
    "are not correctly described , where the nonlinear effect causes an additional distortion of the power spectrum .",
    "the distortion of the power spectrum was discussed by extending the formula to incorporate the nonlinear effect in paper , though the exact derivation was invalidated by the inclusion of the nonlinear effect in a strict sense . according to the result",
    ", the nonlinear effect causes the additional distortion of the power spectrum by order of several @xmath199 percent at @xmath203 , depending on the cosmological model . in the present paper , the linear redshift - space distortion and the cosmological redshift - space distortion",
    "are discussed separately , however , investigations combining these effects are needed to present realistic theoretical predictions .",

    "<S> we develop theoretical formulae for the power spectrum in linear theory of density perturbations in a rigorous manner starting from first principle corresponding to fourier analysis . </S>",
    "<S> approximate formulae , which are useful properly to incorporate the redshift - space distortion effects into the power spectrum are derived , and the validity is examined . applying our formulae to galaxy and quasar samples which roughly match the sdss survey , we will show how the redshift - space distortions distort the power spectrum on the light cone quantitatively . </S>"
