    "the research for equilibrium figures of binary systems has a long history .",
    "the pioneer work was done by roche who treated a synchronously rotating , incompressible ellipsoid around a gravitating point source . following this work ,",
    "darwin constructed a synchronized binary system composed of double incompressible ellipsoids ( see @xcite ) .",
    "for the non - synchronized case , aizenman calculated an equilibrium figure of incompressible ellipsoid with internal motion orbiting a point source companion@xcite . in 1980",
    "s , the improvement of computer performance made possible to construct equilibrium sequences of synchronized binary systems with compressible equation of state in newtonian gravity@xcite .",
    "since the beginning of 1990 s , the studies on binary systems gain some importance in relation to astrophysical sources of gravitational waves .",
    "for example , coalescing binary neutron stars are expected to be one of the most promising sources of gravitational radiation that could be detected by the interferometric detectors currently in operation ( tama300 ) or under construction ( geo600 , ligo , and virgo ) . until now , numerous theoretical studies have been done in this research field . among them",
    "there are ( i ) post - newtonian analytical treatments ( e.g. @xcite ) , ( ii ) black hole perturbation@xcite , ( iii ) newtonian@xcite and post - newtonian@xcite ( semi-)analytical treatments including hydrodynamical effects of stars , ( iv ) post - newtonian hydrodynamical computations@xcite , ( v ) fully relativistic hydrodynamical treatments , pioneered by the works of oohara & nakamura ( see e.g. @xcite ) , and recently developed by shibata@xcite , oohara & nakamura@xcite , and the neutron star grand challenge group@xcite .",
    "( vi ) in parallel of the dynamical studies in ( v ) , a quasiequilibrium formulation of the problem has been developed @xcite and successfully implemented @xcite .",
    "the basic assumption underlying the quasiequilibirum calculations is that the timescale of the orbit shrinking is larger than that of the orbital revolution in the pre - coalescing state .",
    "consequently the evolution of the binary system can be approximated by a succession of exactly circular orbits , hence the name _",
    "quasiequilibrium_.    the first quasiequilibrium configurations of binary neutron stars in general relativity have been obtained four years ago by baumgarte et al.@xcite , followed by marronetti et al.@xcite .",
    "however these computations considered synchronized binaries . as far as coalescing binary neutron stars are concerned , this rotation state does not correspond to physical situations , since it has been shown that the gravitational - radiation driven evolution is too rapid for the viscous forces to synchronize the spin of each neutron star with the orbit@xcite as they do for ordinary stellar binaries .",
    "rather , the viscosity is negligible and the fluid velocity circulation ( with respect to some inertial frame ) is conserved in these systems .",
    "provided that the initial spins are not in the millisecond regime , this means that close binary configurations are well approximated by zero vorticity ( i.e. _ irrotational _ ) states .",
    "irrotational configurations are more complicated to obtain because the fluid velocity does not vanish in the co - orbiting frame ( as it does for synchronized binaries ) .",
    "we have successfully developed a numerical method to tackle this problem and presented the first quasiequilibrium configurations of irrotational binary neutron stars elsewhere@xcite .",
    "the numerical technique relies on a multi - domain spectral method @xcite within spherical coordinates .",
    "since then , two other groups have obtained relativistic irrotational configurations : ( i ) marronetti , mathews & wilson@xcite by means of single - domain finite difference method within cartesian coordinates and ( ii ) uryu & eriguchi@xcite by means of multi - domain finite difference method within spherical coordinates .",
    "recently , we have presented our method in detail with numerous tests @xcite ( hereafter paper i ) . using this method ,",
    "we have calculated ( quasi)equilibrium sequences of binary systems with synchronized and irrotational rotation states . in the present article",

    "since the method which we use in the present article for getting equilibrium configurations has already been explained in paper i@xcite , we will only briefly mention the basic equations and the solving procedure in this section .",
    "the basic equations governing the problem are as follows ( see also sec .",
    "ii.f of paper i ) :    1 .",
    "equation of state : + we adopt a simple equation , i.e. a polytropic equation of state ; + p(h ) = n(h)^ , [ e : eos_poly_p ] @xmath8 being the fluid pressure , @xmath9 the fluid baryon number density , @xmath10 a constant , @xmath11 the adiabatic index , and @xmath12 the specific enthalpy .",
    "the relation between @xmath12 and @xmath9 is given by n(h ) = ^1/(-1 ) , [ e : eos_poly_n ] where @xmath13 denotes the mean baryon mass ( @xmath14 kg ) .",

    "since there is no motion in the corotating frame ( @xmath19 ) , we obtain = . on the other hand , in the irrotational case",
    ", the velocity field in the inertial frame is potential , i.e. = , where @xmath20 is a scalar function .",
    "+ under the stationary condition the euler equation ( [ e : euler ] ) can be integrated as h + - 1 2 ( ) ^2 = const [ e : integ_euler_co ] in the synchronized case and h + + 12 ( ) ^2 - ( ) = const [ e : integ_euler_ir ] in the irrotational case .",
    "3 .   equation of continuity : + + ( n ) = 0 .",
    "[ e : continuity_general ] this equation is trivially satisfied by stationary rigid rotation . in the irrotational case",
    ", we can rewrite eq .",
    "( [ e : continuity_general ] ) as [ e : eq_psi ] n +",
    "n = ( ) n. [ e : continuity ] 4 .",
    "poisson equation for the gravitational field : + = 4 m_b n. [ e : poisson ]      * first of all , we prepare the equilibrium figures of _ two _ spherical stars . in the present computation ,",
    "we treat binary systems composed of equal mass stars with the same equation of state . however , we symmetrize only with respect to the orbital plane .",
    "although this treatment elongates the compute time , we do not symmetrize the stars because we are planning to study binary systems composed of different mass stars in the series of this research . *",
    "the separation between the centers of the two stars is held fixed . here",
    "we define the center as the point of the maximum enthalpy ( or equivalently maximum density - see eq .",
    "( [ e : eos_poly_n ] ) ) .",
    "* by setting the central value of the gradient of enthalpy to be zero , we calculate the orbital angular velocity @xmath21 ( see sec .",

    "the velocity potential @xmath20 is obtained by solving eq .",
    "( [ e : continuity ] ) .",
    "* taking into account the gravitational potential from the companion star and the centrifugal force , we calculate the new enthalpy field from eq .",
    "( [ e : integ_euler_co ] ) or ( [ e : integ_euler_ir ] ) . * using the new enthalpy",
    ", we search for the location of @xmath22 ; this defines the stellar surface since @xmath22 is equivalent to @xmath23 ( see eqs .",
    "( [ e : eos_poly_p ] ) and ( [ e : eos_poly_n ] ) ) . having determined the new stellar surface , we change the position of the inner domain boundary to make it fit with the stellar surface .",

    "( [ e : eos_poly_n ] ) , the new baryon density is obtained . * inserting the new baryon density into the source term of the poisson equation ( [ e : poisson ] ) , we can get the new gravitational potential . * finally , we compare the new enthalpy field with the old one .",
    "if the difference is smaller than some fixed threshold , the calculation is considered as having converged .",
    "if not , return to step ( c ) , and continue .    during the calculation , we make the baryon mass to converge to a fixed value by varying the central enthalpy .",
    "moreover , some relaxation is performed on the gravitational potential , the centrifugal force , and the orbital angular velocity , when such a treatment helps the iteration to converge .",
    "the explicit procedures are detailed in paper i.",
    "the numerical method which we use in this series of research @xcite is a multi - domain spectral method . in general ,",
    "spectral methods lose much of their accuracy when non - smooth functions are treated because of the so - called gibbs phenomenon .",
    "this phenomenon is well known from the most familiar spectral method , namely , the theory of fourier series : the fourier coefficients ( @xmath24 ) of a function @xmath25 which is of class @xmath26 but not @xmath27 decrease as only @xmath28 with increasing @xmath9 . in particular ,",
    "if the function has some discontinuity , its approximation by a fourier series does not converge towards @xmath25 at the discontinuity point .",
    "the _ multi - domain _ spectral method circumvents the gibbs phenomenon@xcite .",
    "the basic idea is to divide the space into domains chosen so that the physical discontinuities are located onto the boundaries between the domains .",
    "however , even if the circumvention of the gibbs phenomenon has been done by introducing multi - domains , there remains the gibbs phenomenon at the boundaries between the domains when some physical field has infinite derivative at the boundary .",
    "for example , when we consider a star , its surface coincides with the boundary of a domain .",
    "if the star has a stiff equation of state , i.e. @xmath0 in terms of the adiabatic index , the density decreases so rapidly that @xmath29 diverges at the surface . in order to recover high accuracy ,",
    "we have developed a method to regularize the density profile by extracting its diverging part ( see sec .",
    "iv of ref .",
    "@xcite ) .    here",
    "we briefly summarize this method .",
    "for a polytrope with adiabatic index @xmath11 , the matter density @xmath9 behaves as @xmath30 ( see eq .",
    "( [ e : eos_poly_n ] ) ) . in the steady state configuration ,",
    "@xmath12 is taylor expandable at the neighborhood of the stellar surface because the gravitational potential @xmath15 is taylor expandable there ( cf . eq . ( [ e : integ_euler_co ] ) or ( [ e : integ_euler_ir ] ) ) .",
    "therefore @xmath12 vanishes as @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is the equation of the stellar surface .",
    "consequently @xmath9 behaves as @xmath33^{1/(\\gamma-1)}$ ] .",
    "we introduce a known potential @xmath34 such that @xmath35 has the same pathological behavior as @xmath9 and such that @xmath36 is a regular function ( at least more regular than @xmath9 ) .",
    "we then numerically solve _ regu = n - n_div , where @xmath37 .",
    "consider , for instance , [ e : div_pot ] _ div = f ( , , )  ( 1-^2)^(+2 ) , where @xmath38 .",
    "@xmath39 is an arbitrary regular function and @xmath40 is a new radial variable such that @xmath41 at the surface of the star@xcite .",
    "it is easy to see that @xmath42 has a term vanishing at the surface with the same pathological behavior as @xmath9 , i.e. , @xmath43 .",
    "we have indeed _ div & = & f ( 1-^2)^(+2 ) + & & -4(+2 ) ( 1-^2)^(+1 ) _ f + & & + ( + 2 ) [ -6(1-^2)^(+1 ) + 4(+1 ) ^2 ( 1-^2)^ ] f , where @xmath44 is the laplacian computed with respect to @xmath45 .    for calculational simplicity ,",
    "we choose an harmonic function for @xmath46 .",
    "then , we can write @xmath47 , where _ lm:=",
    "^l ( 1-^2)^(+2 ) y_l^m ( , ) , @xmath48 being some numerical coefficients to be determined and @xmath49 the standard spherical harmonics . we then obtain n_div = _ l , m a_lm c_l ( ) y_l^m ( , ) , with c_l ( ) & = & ( + 2 ) [ -(4l+6 ) ( 1-^2)^(+1 ) ^l + & & + 4 ( + 1 ) ^(l+2 ) ( 1-^2)^ ] .",
    "we now have to determine the values of the coefficients @xmath48 which give the most regular function @xmath50 .",
    "the criterion which seems to give the best results is the following one .",
    "we expand both @xmath9 and @xmath51 as truncated series of spherical harmonics @xmath52 and chebyshev polynomial @xmath53 , & & n ( , , ) = _ i , l , m=0^i , l , m n_ilm",
    "t_i ( ) y_l^m ( , ) , + & & n_div ( , , ) = _ i , l , m=0^i , l , m a_lm c_li t_i ( ) y_l^m ( , ) , where we expand each of the function @xmath54 in a chebyshev series as c_l ( ) = _ i=0^i c_li t_i ( ) .",
    "the values of @xmath48 is computed in such a way that the @xmath55th coefficient of the truncated series of @xmath56 vanishes : a_lm = n_ilm c_li .    by means of the above procedure",
    ", we eliminate in @xmath9 the pathological term which vanishes as @xmath43 but we introduce another pathological term proportional to @xmath57 .",
    "however , the divergence occurs in a higher order derivative of this term so that it has a much weaker effect on the accuracy of the results .",
    "the method can be improved by taking _",
    "div & = & f ( , , ) ( 1-^2)^(+2 ) [ a_1 + a_2 ( 1-^2 ) + & & + a_3 ( 1-^2)^2 + + a_k ( 1-^2)^k-1 ] instead of eq .",
    "( [ e : div_pot ] ) .",
    "the coefficients @xmath58 are chosen in such a way that the first , second , ... , @xmath59th derivatives of @xmath56 vanish at @xmath41 .",
    "let us call @xmath59 the regularization degree of the procedure .    the explicit procedure to determine the coefficients @xmath58 is as follows :",
    "let us consider the case of @xmath60 and choose an harmonic function for @xmath46 for example . in this case",
    ", we need two diverging terms , @xmath61 , where we define n_div : k : = _ l , m a_lm^k c_l^k ( ) y_l^m ( , ) , with c_l^k ( ) & = & ( + k+1 ) [ -(4l+6 ) ( 1-^2)^(+k ) ^l + & & + 4 ( + k ) ^(l+2 ) ( 1-^2)^+k-1 ] .",
    "first of all , we expand @xmath9 , @xmath62 and @xmath63 by @xmath52 and @xmath53",
    ". then , we can express @xmath64 as an expansion in a chebyshev series , c_l^k ( ) = _",
    "i=0^i c_li^k t_i ( ) .",

    "to validate the above regularization technique , we investigate the improvement in the relative error in the virial theorem for a spherical static star , which is defined as [ e : vir_error_static ] virial  error = |w + 3p| |w| , @xmath66 being the gravitational potential energy and @xmath67 the volume integral of the fluid pressure .",
    "we give the values of the virial error in fig .",
    "[ fig : virial_regu ] . in this figure",
    "we show the cases of ( 1 ) @xmath68 , ( 2 ) @xmath69 , ( 3 ) @xmath70 , and ( 4 ) @xmath71 , and in each small figure except for the case of @xmath71 for which no gibbs phenomenon occurs , we have drawn four lines : `` no regularization '' , regularization degree @xmath72 , 2 , and 3 .",
    "it is found from these plots that the regularization dramatically improves the accuracy . however , the improvement by the regularization saturates at @xmath60 .",
    "note here that since there is no gibbs phenomenon in the calculation of a spherical star in the case of @xmath71 , the virial error decreases rapidly ( exponential decay - evanescent error ) with the increase of the number of radial collocation point @xmath73 , and reaches the minimum value due to the finite number of digits ( 15=double precision ) used in the numerical computation .    considering the saturation of the virial error",
    ", we will choose the regularization degree @xmath60 in the following numerical computations for @xmath74 .",
    "we note that since the matter density @xmath9 behaves as @xmath30 , the derivatives of @xmath9 of order higher than the second one diverge at the stellar surface even if @xmath75 .",
    "therefore we will also use the regularization ( @xmath60 ) for the cases of @xmath75 .",

    "this means that the numerical solution and the analytical one agree up to the accuracy of this latter ( @xmath77 $ ] ) .",

    "we do not depict the configurations of the last lines of table  [ table2 ] for the following reason .",
    "as mentioned above and in paper i , we make the boundary the inner domain fit with the stellar surface .",
    "this procedure is essential to accurately solve equilibrium figures in the irrotational case ( appendix  b of paper  i ) .",
    "however , due to the apparition of the cusp on the stellar surface , we can no longer adapt the domain to that surface because all quantities are expressed by summation of a finite number of differentiable functions .",
    "for very close configurations , just prior to the apparition of the cusp , the surface is highly distorted so that there appear unphysical oscillations when using finite series of differentiable functions ( gibbs phenomenon ) . in the last lines for each @xmath11 in table [ table2 ] ,",
    "such oscillations start to be seen , although they do not alter appreciably the global quantities .",
    "therefore to avoid any misunderstanding , we choose not to plot the final lines in table [ table2 ] , although we listed them .    figures  [ fig : velo_ig3 ]  [ fig : velo_ig18 ] show some isocontours of the velocity potential , as well as the velocity field in the co - orbiting frame , for the polytropic indices @xmath68 , @xmath115 and @xmath2 , respectively . in these figures , we show only one of the two star .",

    "we magnify the region near the end of the sequences in fig .",

    "this means that the cusp may be created before contact of stars in the irrotational case .",
    "this behavior in the irrotational case agrees with the results of uryu@xcite .",
    "it is worth to note here that the point where the cusp may be created is expressed by the orbital separation divided by _",

    "( [ e : integ_euler_ir_rw ] ) , we see that the enthalpy fields for synchronized and irrotational binaries differ precisely by that kinetic energy .",

    "however , the largest difference between @xmath132 and @xmath133 is the last term in the numerator of eq .",
    "( [ e : chi_irrot ] ) .",
    "we show this behavior in the following .",

    "we can confirm from this figure that , at small separation , the difference in the gravitational force plus centrifugal force is smaller than that in the force related internal flow .",
    "therefore , we will consider only the last term in the numerator of eq .",
