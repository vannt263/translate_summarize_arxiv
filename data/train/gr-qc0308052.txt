    "<S> the initial static wormhole background is not stable after infalling d - particles due to the classical backreaction of the geometry so that the additional exotic matter source should be introduced for the stability . </S>",
    "<S> then , the traversable wormhole geometry naturally appears and the d - particles can travel through it safely . finally , we discuss the dynamical evolution of the wormhole throat and the massless limit of d - particles . </S>"
