    "fourscore and three years after fermi computed how a nonzero neutrino mass would affect the endpoint of the electron spectrum in a @xmath1-decay process @xcite , the laboratory quest for a non - zero result in this kind of measurement is very much alive @xcite .",
    "weak electron capture ( ec ) has a sensitivity to the neutrino mass entirely analogous to the one of @xmath1-decay .",
    "ec is the @xmath2 weak - interaction process whereby an atomic electron interacts with a nucleus of charge @xmath3 to produce a neutrino , leaving behind a nucleus of charge @xmath4 and a hole in the orbital of the daughter atom from which the electron was captured .",
    "the optimal nuclide in this respect is @xmath0ho .",
    "the favoured experimental technique is `` calorimetric '' @xcite .",
    "various experiments echo @xcite , holmes @xcite and numecs @xcite are currently making progress in this direction .",
    "once upon a time it was argued that the calorimetric energy spectrum of @xmath0ho decay ought to be very well approximated by a simple theoretical expression : the sum over the breit - wigner - shaped contributions of the single holes left by electrons weakly captured by the nucleus @xcite . in the extremely good approximation in which nuclear - size effects are neglected , the corresponding orbitals are the ones whose wave function at the origin is non - vanishing . in @xmath0ho ec decay to @xmath0dy the reaction s q - value is smaller than the l ( n=2 ) binding energies so that the potentially capturing orbitals ( or resulting holes ) are h = m1 , m2 , n1 , n2 , o1 , o2 and p1 , after which the 67th element ( ho ) runs out of electrons .",
    "robertson has pointed out that two - hole contributions should not be negligible @xcite . in an ec event ,",
    "the wave functions of the spectator electrons in the mother and daughter atoms are not identical , the small mismatch leading to an `` instantaneous '' creation of secondary holes , h. an electron having been expelled from the h orbital may be `` shaken up '' to an unoccupied atomic level or `` shaken off '' into the continuum .",
    "the ensuing contribution to the energy distribution would result in a peak for shake - up and a broad feature for shake - off .",
    "the probabilities @xmath5 for the production of two holes are much smaller than single - hole ones , @xmath6 . yet ,",
    "when the energy deficit of the two - hole state @xmath7 is not very close to that of a prominent but narrow single - hole peak , there is an observable feature in the spectrum , even if @xmath8 .",
    "robertson argues that _  if the presence of the curvature in the spectrum _ [ due to two - hole processes ] _ near the endpoint were not known to an analyst , fitting to the standard spectral shape would produce erroneous results for q and @xmath9_. the two - hole processes , if significant , will be observed much before the analyst attempts to measure the cited parameters .",
    "moreover , given the recently measured q - value , @xmath10 ev @xcite , the dangerous possibility that @xmath11 for any given pair of holes is excluded .",
    "the bad news is that the cited value of @xmath12 is larger than the previously ` recommended' figure , @xmath13 kev @xcite , which goes in the direction of making a potential measurement of @xmath9 more difficult . the good news , as we shall argue",
    ", is that the contribution of two - hole states close to the spectral endpoint may compensate for the bad news , possibly in an overwhelming way",
    ".    we shall be specifically interested in calorimetric energies , @xmath14 , in a domain hardly explored so far , extending from the m1 peak at @xmath15 ev to the endpoint at @xmath16 .",
    "though qed and the weak - interaction theory are well established to impressive levels of precision , dealing with atoms containing up to 67 electrons is not entirely straightforward .",
    "thus , we shall need observational input to guide our course .",
    "some of the preliminary data of echo @xcite and numecs @xcite are shown in figs.([fig : lg],[fig : kunde ] ) . there , they are compared with an elaborate theory of the calorimetric spectrum @xcite , smeared with the experimental resolution and with the inclusion of one , two and three - hole contributions .",
    "the agreement of theory and data is fairly good for the prominent m1 , m2 , n1 and n2 contributions .",
    "there is in the echo data a significant peak at an energy close to the expected position of a contribution from n1 capture accompanied by o1 shakeup ( n1o1 ) , much larger than the theoretical expectation of @xcite .",
    "there is no evidence , at the predicted level , for the contribution from n1 capture accompanied by n4/5 shakeup ( n1n4/5 ) in either experiment .",
    "an expected , sizeable m1n4/5 peak is also apparently absent in the numecs data ( it is tacitly assumed in these theoretical predictions @xcite that the computed probability for the production of a second hole corresponds entirely to electron shakeup ) .",
    "finally , in both data sets , there is evidence for a `` shoulder '' above the theoretical expectations in the 480 ev @xmath17 550 ev domain of calorimetric energy .",
    "in @xcite we have interpreted the situation just described in terms of a simple theory of the production of `` second '' holes , described in the following chapter .",
    "the predictions , for the region close to the n1 , n2 single - hole peaks , are shown in fig.([fig : us ] ) . in this and",
    "subsequent figures , the symbols \\{c , u } and \\{c , o } refer to one electron being captured ( c ) , the other one being shaken up ( u ) or off ( o ) .",
    "the curly brackets remind us that the electrons are indistinguishable and their wave functions anti - symmetrized .",
    "once again , theory @xcite and data disagree .",
    "our estimate of the height of the n1o1\\{c , u } shakeup peak is a factor @xmath18 too low .",
    "it is possible to correct in similarly moderate ways the other contributions such as to agree with the data .",
    "one possibility , illustrated in fig.([fig : us ] ) , is to correct the n1o1\\{c , u } peak by the cited factor and to leave n1o1\\{c , o } shake - off shoulder which snugly describes the observed one as predicted , while reducing the n1n4/5 features by a factor @xmath19 .",
    "pm contamination .",
    "the resolution s width ( fwhm ) is taken to be @xmath20 ev .",
    ", scaledwidth=55.0% ]      we conclude from the comparison of theory and preliminary data that the predictions for the subdominant spectral features due to the production of more than one hole are to be taken _ cum amplo grano salis_.    as we wall discuss in more detail in sections vi and ix , it is not a surprise that the precise positions , heights and widths of the single- and multiple - hole contributions ought to be fit to the observations .",
    "only the breit - wigner shape of a single peak ( or shakeup multiple peak ) is theoretically hale and hearty .",
    "much less so is the shape of a shakeoff feature which , computed in the customary sudden approximation , depends on an overlap of bound and unbound wave functions .    finally , the predictions for the normalization of the various contributions , particularly the more elaborate ones @xcite , seem to be very untrustworthy . on the way to an analysis of the endpoint , the size of the various spectral features will need to be adjusted to fit the data .",
    "currently , there are no theoretical results for the shake - off contributions , akin to those of @xcite for the shake - up probabilities",
    ". it would be useful to know whether the shapes of these shake - off contributions agree with those of our more naive approach which , as we have seen , agree with the preliminary data .",
    "in this section we clone the simple theory of the production of one @xcite or more holes @xcite in electron capture , adapting it to the region of calorimetric energies extending from the m1 and m2 holes to the spectral endpoint .      in its simplest approximation @xcite",

    "the peak intensities are proportional to @xmath25 , the values in ho of the squared wave functions at the origin of the electrons to be captured .",

    "but the measured differences @xmath42 are so small that the sensitivity of current direct attempts to measure @xmath43 may result in a positive result only if neutrinos are nearly degenerate in mass , in which case @xmath9 in eqs.([drdec]-[eq : resonances ] ) stands for their nearly common mass .",
    "we have , in eq.([drdec ] ) , made the  classical \" approximation of neglecting interferences between different vacated orbitals . for two different intermediate states h and h to interfere ,",
    "it is necessary that they decay into the same subsequent state .",
    "the probability for this to happen , in the case we are discussing , is small .",
    "an estimate of a generous upper limit to the effect of interferences is discussed in appendix [ app : interferences ] , demonstrating that interferences may be neglected .      as robertson pointed out @xcite , in an ec event leading to a primary hole h",
    "there is a small probability for a second hole h to be made in a shake - up process . when the second electron is shaken - up to any unoccupied daughter - atom bound - state level of binding energy negligible relative to @xmath44 the calorimetric energy has a peak at @xmath45 .",

    "more precisely , @xmath53 stands for the operation of symmetrizing the product of captured wave function and transition amplitude in the singlet antisymmetric spin state , antisymmetrizing it in the triplet symmetric spin state and adding the resulting square moduli with weights 1/4 and 3/4 .",
    "the creation of a second hole h in the capture leaving a hole h can also occur as the shake - off of the electron in the orbital h to the `` continuum '' of unbound electrons : @xmath54}+e^-+\\nu_e .",

    "the neutrino energy , @xmath28 , and the ejected electron s kinetic energy , @xmath55 , satisfy @xmath56 .",

    "it is simplest to discuss the rate for the shake - off process of eq.([eq:2holes ] ) by doing it for starters in the vanishing - width approximation for the daughter holes . in this case",

    "electron capture in ho results in a dy atom which we shall in what follows denote as dy* with a hole in the orbital from which the capture took place .",
    "the absent - electron charge partially shields the one of the absent - proton .",
    "relative to a process without a similar effect such as the creation of a primary hole by photo - ionization the partial shielding generally leads to a reduced probability for the creation of a second hole .",
    "this is because the wave functions of the potentially vacated second orbitals in the parent and daughter atoms have a closer overlap in the presence of shielding . and",
    "in the sudden approximation traditionally used to make these kind of estimates the square of this overlap is the probability of not creating a second hole .",
    "intemann and pollock were the first to show how to properly treat the shake - off of a second electron in ec . in what follows",
    "we apply their method and refer as an example to m1 capture accompanied by n1 shakeoff , or , more precisely , to the m1n1\\{c , o } process ( the most relevant one closest to the spectral endpoint ) .",

    "one must it goes without saying also do the calculations encapsulated in eqs.([ip]-[bb ] ) with the exchange m1 @xmath78 n1 , since the two - hole final state , at a given @xmath55 , is the same independently of which electron is captured or ejected .",
    "thus , in the sudden approximation , the square of the ( monopolar ) matrix element for an electron being shaken - off with energy @xmath55 results in : @xmath79 for the distribution function of eq.([overlapfree ] ) .    a crucial point in estimating",
    "wave - function overlaps is to choose them with the correct spatial scale . to provide an estimate of the shape of @xmath80 we shall use non - relativistic coulomb wave functions of ho with effective values of @xmath3 chosen to reproduce the relevant orbits mean radii , as calculated with more precise hartree - fock methods @xcite .",

    "this is made clearer by comparing the @xmath104 domains , which we do in fig.([fig : endpointpileup ] ) .",
    "the ratio of single to pileup events at , for instance , @xmath117 ev is @xmath118 times larger in the lower part of this figure ( where two - hole effects are included ) than in the upper part ( where they are not ) .",
    "the reason why we find improved expectations concerning pileup is simple . at @xmath119 q",
    "the pileup spectrum is dominated by the addition of the n1h\\{c , o } and m1h\\{c , o } spectral tails , while the singles spectrum is dominated by the latter .",
    "but in the pile - up integral of eq.([pileup ] ) all spectral features are partially smoothed out .",
    "a clear conclusion from the existing data is that there are spectral contributions not anticipated in a simple single - hole theory . in the current exploratory phase of the experiments it would be tempting to subtract from the data the single - hole expectation , to visualize directly the _ residuum _ : the cited extra contributions .",
    "one could , for instance , subtract the blue curve in fig.([fig : fullmspectrum ] ) from the black one , to extract the red one : the residual sum of double - hole contributions .",
    "we now address the question of the precision with which this can be done .    given the large statistics with which single - hole contributions will be measured at and around their peaks , there is no question that their individual parameters ( position , height and width ) will be exquisitely measured . but to obtain the residua a bw shape in eqs.([drdec],[bw ] ) , extending up to very many widths above the peak , must be assumed .",
    "a breit - wigner is an approximation known to require , in certain cases , potentially large explicit corrections @xcite .",
    "the proof that in the calorimetric case at hand the simple standard bw shape we have used is perfectly well suited is lengthy .",
    "we relegate it to appendix [ apptails ] .",
    "the precise treatment of a process in an atom with 67 electrons is obviously intricate .",
    "one limitation , in the case of ec , is the use of the sudden approximation . while it is justified in the analysis of electrons captured from the inner orbitals , it is less so for captures from the @xmath120 levels of interest here .    in the sudden approximation ( e.g.  in a @xmath1-decay ) and in estimating secondary - hole probabilities , the time required for the change of nuclear charge",
    "is assumed to be negligible relative to the typical atomic orbital times : the time it takes them to `` react '' to the new environment . in ec",
    "this assumption used for decades without hardly a comment is extended to the comparison of the time required to propagate the information that the captured electron has disappeared , relative to the rest of the characteristic atomic times : the former must be negligible .    the opposite to the sudden extreme is the adiabatic case , in which the electronic orbitals have time aplenty to slowly evolve from the parent - atom eigenstates to the daughter - atom ones . in the extreme adiabatic limit",
    "the probability of making `` second holes '' would vanish .",
    "the characteristic time , @xmath121 , for the ec process @xmath122 underlying the nuclear transition is the inverse of the energy transfer @xmath123 . for a process with @xmath124 , such as the one under discussion , @xmath125 and",
    "@xmath126 is orders of magnitude smaller than any characteristic atomic time . in the nuclear sense",
    ", ec is instantaneous .      in the simple approach that we have discussed in section [ theory ] , two electrons ( the captured one and the one that is potentially exiting its orbital ) play a singular role .",
    "the rest of the electrons are only there to imply some effective values of @xmath3 or to forbid some transitions .",
    "but once more , a non - relativistic coulombic approximation everywhere but in allowing for the particularly large effect of ec from the @xmath127 orbitals . ] provides guidance , which in the case of the adequacy of the sudden approximation turns out to be quite relevant .",
    "the relativistic retardation of signals implies that the sudden nuclear transition @xmath128 can not be instantaneously felt by an electron in an orbital of mean radius @xmath129 .",
    "it takes a time of order @xmath129 for the orbital to be `` informed '' .",
    "similarly , the absence of the electron that was captured is felt by another atomic electron after a time of the order of the larger of the two mean orbital radii .",
    "recall that the mean radius and binding energy of a coulombic eigenfunction , in the usual notation , are : @xmath130&=&{[3\\,n^2-l(l+1)]/({2 \\,m_e}\\,z\\,\\alpha)}\\label{radius}\\\\ e[n]&=&{m_e\\,(z\\,\\alpha)^2/ ( 2\\,n^2)}\\label{energy}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the quantum - mechanical characteristic time for a bound state to `` react '' to a perturbation is the inverse of its binding energy .",
    "thus , deviations from the sudden approximation in a transition amplitude are , up to a factor of @xmath131 , governed by a figure of merit @xmath65 , the ratio of the  retardation \" time to the quantum - mechanical  reaction \" time : @xmath132 for @xmath133 the sudden approximation is justified , while @xmath134 corresponds to the adiabatic limit .    in numerical examples , let us use the radius of an @xmath72 orbital as a characteristic light - travel time , @xmath135 $ ] .",

    ", the sudden approximation appears once again to be justified .    in our two - active - electron approach the use of ( suddenly ) overlapping wave - function is safe , but the wave functions themselves are crude approximations .",
    "thus the potential interest of more ambitious calculations .",
    "the methods of faessler and collaborators @xcite are relativistic , like the effects neglected by use of the sudden approximation . ] , and consistently use slater determinants to describe the fully anti - symmetrized states of the ho and dy * atoms . in each atom",
    "the individual orbitals span an orthonormal set . for dy",
    "* this implies that _ all _ of its electrons must have had ample time , after the nuclear capture , to readjust to the new situation .",
    "consider the capture of an m1 electron ; the mean radius of its orbital is @xmath145  , which we will take as the pertinent time for the capture information to arrive to three inner orbitals .",
    "for the other electron in the m1 state , whose binding energy is @xmath146 kev , the figure of merit is @xmath147 . for an l1 electron , @xmath148 kev and @xmath149 . finally , for a k electron @xmath150 kev , and @xmath151 .",
    "we conclude that the sudden approximation is not good for the dy * atom in its ensemble .",
    "this statement is very specific to cases in which the captured electron belongs to a rather external orbit : m1 or higher in the case of @xmath0ho .",
    "should we have discussed k - capture , the characteristic radius ( or time ) to spread the information would have been a k radius and the energies of the orbits in which second holes may be produced a k binding energy , or a smaller one . the sudden - approximation figure of merit , @xmath65",
    ", would have always been significantly smaller than unity , justifying the sudden approximation .",
    "we have only discussed @xmath0ho . but measurements of the next - to - best electron - capturing isotope @xcite , @xmath152pt , could be of help in understanding the difficult theoretical issues associated with the two - hole contributions . the problem is simply one of qed , like in the case of holmium or the slightly harder problem of understanding the human brain .",
    "the current very preliminary data on the calorimetric spectrum of @xmath0ho decay , in the region of the n peaks , appear to be qualitatively described by the simplified theory we have discussed .",
    "a similarly preliminary conclusion is that the description of the observations becomes quantitively satisfactory when the various theoretical single- and double - hole features are renormalized to fit the data .",
    "once the data improve , we expect this conclusion to become more solid .    on the way to measure or limit the neutrino mass ,",
    "the relevant energy domain is not yet explored .",
    "it is the one extending from the m2 and m1 single peaks towards the spectral endpoint , the interval we have analized in detail .",
    "it is there that future data and the comparison of its features with theory will be of utmost interest .",
    "we argued that , relative to the  old theory \" with only single - hole contributions , double - hole effects may enhance the spectral endpoint region by a factor of @xmath153 .",
    "if this is correct , the statistical sensitivity on @xmath43 which varies as the fourth root of the number of decays would improve by a factor @xmath154 .",
    "we showed that the pileup problem would also be reduced by an even larger factor .",
    "we can not indubitably trust the above optimistic conclusions .",
    "thus , we have also studied the possibility that double- and single - hole contributions be of similar magnitude close to the endpoint .",
    "this choice makes the theoretical analysis of the data more challenging .",
    "but we have argued that also in this very pessimistic case the introduction of just one extra parameter besides @xmath9 , q and the slope of a linear function of @xmath14 should be enough to analyse the data along well - trodden paths .",
    "an issue that remains to be investigated is the possible existence , in a given calorimeter s substrate , of befs oscillations .",
    "these would be due to ho - decay electrons undergoing reflections in the crystal lattice @xcite .",
    "the possibility of a significant contribution of electron shake - ups , leading to double - hole spectral peaks , was originally presented as very damning @xcite .",
    "somewhat ironically , the likely existence of a significant contribution of electron shake - offs may be a very welcome blessing .",

    "( [ bw ] ) is a good approximation , specially very many widths above a given resonance , in particular the one corresponding to an m1 hole , whose contribution dominates the end of the spectrum . in this respect ,",

    "consider , as a `` sanity test '' , the possible but relatively very improbable case in which the hole made by ec in the neutral daughter atom , dy * , decays to the dy ground state by having the dy * outermost electron transit to the hole , with the emission of a photon .",

    "relative to eq .",

    "suppose we adopt the first of the two mentioned remedies by substituting @xmath184 take the example of m1 capture ( @xmath185 ev ) .",
    "the modification of the width in the denominator of the bw expression is immaterial at the endpoint , for @xmath186 .",

    "one reason is that the single - photon dy * decay we discussed which would require a three - body phase space treatment has a negligible branching ratio .",
    "the dominant decays consist of a series of auger or coster - kronig transitions ( in which the neutral dy * emits electrons , becoming an increasingly charged ion ) , followed by radiative transitions in which an outer atomic electron or one coming from the negatively charged atomic neighborhood drops into the dy - ion holes and a photon is emitted .",

    "but , at the relevant very non - relativistic energies , this factor , to a very good approximation , is compensated by the `` fermi - function '' , @xmath191 , which reflects the fact that the wave function of the outgoing electron is not that of a free particle , but the one of an electron subject to the field of a charged ion . for any of the soft photon emissions in fig.([fig : auger ] ) the pertinent width may be modified by a remedial factor @xmath192 , but that function differs very little from unity in its narrow allowed range ( unless @xmath193 , the unlikely case discussed in the next paragraph ) .",
    "the emission of only one photon is highly suppressed , as we said above .",
    "there still remains the possibility that one of the ( many ) photons emitted in the decay as depicted in fig.([fig : auger]) carries all of the energy @xmath194 , requiring a modified width in the corresponding breit - wigner .",
    "but in that case all the other emitted photons have momenta @xmath195 and the phase space ( multiply ) vanishes .",
    "the multi - body phase space has a multidimensional pole at the central energies of each of the transitions . at @xmath194",
    "the overwhelmingly most likely situation corresponds to all energies being close to this multiple pole and adding up to @xmath194 .",
