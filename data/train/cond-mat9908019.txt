    "the rheological properties of liquid crystalline systems continue to be of considerable interest because of their rich and complex behaviour .",
    "thin films of anisotropic molecules , such as langmuir monolayers at an air - water interface , are relevant to many industrial applications , and as such , have been subjected to detailed experimental studies . in particular , the viscous response of liquid crystalline films",
    "is often found to be non - newtonian . among the dominant causes",
    "is coupling of the flow to molecular alignment . in smectic films ( crystalline in one dimension , but liquid - like in the other ) , the presence of unbound dislocations becomes a major factor affecting viscous response .",
    "when the film is riding over another phase , usually water , viscous drag from this subphase , if large , can modify the flow profile of the film quite significantly .",
    "the coupling between molecular alignment and flow has been seen in some cases in experiments by mingotaud _",

    "the experiments involve langmuir monolayers of rod - shaped molecules that are usually tilted with respect to the surface normal , forming a hexatic phase with anisotropic in - plane bond orientations .",
    "typically the film consists of domains of a liquid crystalline phase co - existing with another liquid crystalline phase or with the liquid expanded phase ( no orientational order ) .",
    "the domains can be distinguished through brewster angle microscopy which is sensitive to molecular orientation , making it possible to follow the shape and movement of the domains along the flow .",
    "there is evidence of nonlinear shear response  @xcite emerging from such studies , as well as of the molecular orientation being influenced by flow  @xcite .",
    "shear - thinning has often been observed in experiments involving langmuir monolayers  @xcite . a possible explanation of this phenomenon is provided by bruinsma _ et al . _",
    "@xcite in terms of shear - induced defect proliferation .",
    "dislocation defects in a solid , if unbound , can relax an applied strain by moving in response to the resulting stress . since the force on such a defect depends on its `` charge '' ,",
    "oppositely charged defects tend to separate under an external stress .",
    "tightly bound pairs can not contribute to the steady state viscous response , although they can modify the response at non - zero frequencies and wave - vectors  @xcite .",
    "however , at finite temperatures , bound pairs can dissociate under this separating influence which effectively tilts the potential well confining the pair , allowing them to be free beyond a potential barrier .",
    "being thermally activated , the free dislocation density , and hence the viscous rsponse , would be very sensitive to temperature .",

    "single _ set of bragg planes .",
    "although we do not study this here , channel flow of two - dimensional smectics would also be a promising context in which to explore a tractable model of shear thinning .    in the absence of external strains , free dislocations or disclinations",
    "do nt occur in the most ordered two - dimensional phases ; they are instead bound in pairs of opposite charges by a logarithmic potential .",
    "however , in two - dimensional layered materials such as smectics or cholesterics , there is exponential decay of translational order in both the layering direction , and the liquid - like direction along the layers  @xcite . as a result ,",
    "isolated dislocations have a finite energy and exist in a finite concentration at any finite temperature . in these materials ,",
    "shear response is primarily due to the free dislocations ; the viscosity diverges inversely as the dislocation density when it becomes small at low temperatures .",
    "this divergence is cut off at short length scales by the permeation mode of mass transfer in smectics , where a layer distortion induces molecules to jump from layer to layer without affecting the layering structure , allowing the distortion to relax over a finite distance .",
    "an analogy can be made to the screening effect of supercurrents in a superconductor that allow the magnetic field to penetrate a finite distance in from the surface , although the field is expelled from the bulk .",
    "the `` permeation current '' plays a similar role with respect to shear in a smectic without dislocations .    in three dimensions",
    ", this analogy has been carried further to predict divergence of the response functions of the smectic near the second - order smectic - to - nematic transition .",
    "the coupling of the nematic order parameter to fluctuations in the magnitude of the smectic order parameter causes , among other quantities , the permeation constant of the smectic and the viscosity denoted @xmath0 in the literature , to diverge  @xcite .",
    "however , in two dimensions , a dislocation - driven thermodynamic transition to the nematic state occurs at zero temperature  @xcite , dislocations being the analog of abrikosov flux vortices in two - dimensional superconductors . at a finite temperature ,",
    "the nematic melts into an isotropic liquid via a disclination unbinding transition .",
    "below this temperature , local smectic order is disrupted by singularities in the phase of the order parameter ( _ i.e. _ , dislocations ) .",
    "however , the local smectic order parameter has a finite magnitude , and fluctuations in the magnitude are irrelevant in the renormalization sense  @xcite .",
    "thus renormalization of the elastic coefficients and response functions as in the 3-d case does not occur .",
    "the phase of the local smectic order parameter is related to the layer displacement , and dislocations , which lead to branch cuts in this phase , cost a finite energy as for magnetic vortices in the 3-d superconductor .",
    "coupling of the film flow to a subphase ( a fluid body supporting the film on its surface ) can also significantly alter its flow profile .",

    "when the subphase drag dominates the flow , the flow profile becomes semi - elliptical .",
    "stone  @xcite has performed calculations which confirm this profile and also yield the profiles interpolating between the elliptical and the parabolic as the viscosity of the film relative to that of the subphase is increased .",
    "the depth of the subphase was also a parameter in the calculations , since decreasing the depth results in increased drag . as we show below , stone s results",
    "can also be applied to hexatic films .",
    "the hydrodynamics of partially ordered hexatic films has been studied in detail by zippelius _",
    "et al . _",
    "these authors find a correction to the effective viscosity under flow conditions where the hexatic bond orientation is pinned at the boundaries , as compared to the case where the bond orientation is free to rotate .",
    "the correction comes from coupling of the flow to the bond orientation order parameter under the constraint imposed by the boundaries .",
    "a similar coupling can be enforced by imposing a pressure gradient on the flow . in the experiments conducted by kurnaz & schwartz  @xcite on hexatic film flow ,",
    "the domain structure of the hexatic mesophase can impose constraints on the bond orientation at domain boundaries , thus increasing the viscosity from its bare value .",
    "annealing of the domains would then lead to a reduction in the effective viscosity .",
    "the experimental signature of this effect would be a time - dependent viscous response .",
    "some transients have indeed been observed in these experiments , although other factors may be involved , such as domain boundary elasticity  @xcite and shear thinning .",
    "to illustrate how to incorporate effects of a subphase into the hydrodynamics of a partially ordered film , we adapt the analysis of ref .",
    "@xcite to films with hexatic order . in the presence of a subphase , the hydrodynamic equations of motion for a hexatic get modified by adding a subphase drag term to the viscous force : denoting by @xmath1 the co - ordinate across the channel , @xmath2 along the channel , and @xmath3 along the channel depth ( see fig .",
