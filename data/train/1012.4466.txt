    "we have carried out numerical scattering experiments for a detailed investigation of the mechanisms responsible for the repopulation of the tidal loss cone , and developed a hybrid model to self - consistently solve for the evolutions of the binary , the depletion of the stellar cusp , and the stellar consumption rate .",

    "the tidal disruption cross section for bound stars , which quantifies the probability of stellar disruption , is three orders of magnitude larger than the cross section for a single mbh fed by two - body relation .",
    "two mechanisms contribute to such enhancement , the kozai secular effect and chaotic resonant interactions .",
    "when the eccentricity of the mbhb is small , stars inside the kozai wedge repopulate the tidal loss cone on the kozai timescale , while stars outside the kozai wedge but inside the interaction loss cone are scattered into the tidal loss cone at random times due to close interactions with the secondary hole .",
    "when the eccentricity is large , chaotic loss - cone repopulation becomes dominant over the entire range of stellar semimajor axis @xmath351 .",
    "2 .   gr and cusp - induced precession quench the kozai secular evolution of interacting stars , causing a significant suppression ( by a factor of @xmath128 ) of the disruption rate for @xmath352 .",
    "therefore , the optimal enhancement of the tidal disruption rate by a mbhb occurs for mass ratios @xmath353 .",
    "note that even if suppressed by a factor of @xmath128 , the tidal disruption rate for binaries with @xmath352 is still two order of magnitude larger than that given by standard relaxation processes around a single mbh .",
    "3 .   if a mbhb with mass ratio @xmath69 does not evolve significantly during @xmath354 revolutions , tidal disruptions of bound stars could initially persist at a constant rate (  plateau phase \" ) that is four dex higher than the typical rates predicted for single mbhs .",
    "after one kozai timescale ( evaluated at @xmath355 ) , the tidal loss cone is repopulated mainly by chaotic interaction , and the stellar disruption rate decreases with time . the majority of stars are disrupted during a post - plateau later phase .",
    "4 .   if a mbhb evolves significantly on a timescale of @xmath354 revolution , the plateau phase of stellar disruptions may last longer than a kozai timescale .",
    "tidal disruptions of bound stars slow down the shrinking of the binary and speed up the growth of binary eccentricity .",
    "our results indicate that , after the formation of an unequal - mass mbhb at the center of a dense stellar cusp , the tidal disruption rate may go through three distinct evolutionary phases .",
    "the first phase begins shortly after the mbhs become bound , and is characterized by a disruption rate as high as @xmath356 stars per year , resulting from the three - body interactions between the binary and the bound stars @xcite . when the decay timescale of the mbhb becomes longer than the tidal disruption timescales of stars with @xmath259 , a second phase starts , where cusp depletion from slingshot ejections and tidal disruptions causes a sharp drop in the disruption rate .",
    "@xcite showed that , unless stellar relaxation is far more efficient than two - body  collisions \" , the tidal disruption rate in this phase is orders of magnitudes lower than typical for a single mbhs .",
    "a third phase begins if the mbhb shrinks to the gravitational wave regime and eventually coalesces .",
    "the tidal disruption rate then gradually increases to the value typical for single mbhs , @xmath357 , within one stellar relaxation timescale @xcite .",
    "the number of stars disrupted during phase i is about @xmath358 for @xmath114 and @xmath111 .",
    "the number of stars disrupted in phases ii and iii depends on the efficiency of stellar relaxation , but would not significantly exceed @xmath359 . if a galaxy formed , on the average , one unequal - mass mbhb following a minor merger in its lifetime , then the above numbers imply that in a sample of tidal flares from mbhs of @xmath360 , about @xmath361 of events would be associated to binaries",
    ". if a galaxy forms unequal - mass mbhbs multiple times during its lifetime , then the detection rate of tidal events from binaries in transient surveys may be higher . given the very high rates , there is also the possibility to identify mbhbs in galaxies hosting multiple tidal flares within a years - to - decades time span .",
    "over the next decade , synoptic surveys are expected to detect hundreds of tidal disruption candidates . a tidal flare associated to a mbhb",
    "is likely interrupted within one orbital period of the binary @xcite , therefore is distinguishable from the flares produced by single mbhs , as long as the orbital period of the binary is shorter than the duration of a transient survey . if mbhb - driven disruptions account for @xmath361 of the total rate , then the prospects of identifying mbhbs through tidal flares are promising .",
    "because the predicted rates in the three phases are significantly different from one another , the average stellar disruption rate over the lifetime of a galaxy is sensitive to the infalling rate of secondary mbhs and the relative duration of each phase . a comparison between the observational detection rate of tidal events @xcite and those predicted during the three phases",

    "<S> tidal stellar disruptions have traditionally been discussed as a probe of the single , massive black holes ( mbhs ) that are dormant in the nuclei of galaxies . in chen et al . </S>",
    "<S> ( 2009 ) , we used numerical scattering experiments to show that three - body interactions between bound stars in a stellar cusp and a non - evolving  hard \" mbh binary will also produce a burst of tidal disruptions , caused by a combination of the secular  kozai effect \" and by close resonant encounters with the secondary hole . here </S>",
    "<S> we derive basic analytical scalings of the stellar disruption rates with the system parameters , assess the relative importance of the kozai and resonant encounter mechanisms as a function of time , discuss the impact of general relativistic ( gr ) and extended stellar cusp effects , and develop a hybrid model to self - consistently follow the shrinking of an mbh binary in a stellar background , including slingshot ejections and tidal disruptions . in the case of a fiducial binary with primary hole mass @xmath0 and mass ratio @xmath1 , embedded in an isothermal cusp </S>",
    "<S> , we derive a stellar disruption rate @xmath2yr@xmath3 lasting @xmath4 yr . </S>",
    "<S> this rate is 3 orders of magnitude larger than the corresponding value for a single mbh fed by two - body relaxation , confirming our previous findings . for @xmath5 , </S>",
    "<S> the kozai / chaotic effect could be quenched due to gr / cusp effects by an order of magnitude , but even in this case the stellar - disruption rate is still two orders of magnitude larger than that given by standard relaxation processes around a single mbh . </S>",
    "<S> our results suggest that @xmath6 of the tidal - disruption events may originate in mbh binaries . </S>"
