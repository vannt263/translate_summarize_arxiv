    "in crystalline materials where one or more of the building blocks of the crystal structure is a large molecule the vibrational properties of the molecules often have large effects on the overall electronic properties of the material . one large family of such molecular crystalline materials are the organic conductors and superconductors@xcite . while some molecular crystals such as the fullerene superconductors @xcite have a three - dimensional crystal structure , many other examples are either quasi - one or quasi - two dimensional , _",
    "i.e. _ charge transport is restricted in certain directions due to anisotropic crystal structure .",
    "in addition to strong electron - phonon ( e - ph ) coupling to the molecular vibrations , electron - electron ( e - e ) interactions are often important in low dimensional materials . in this paper",
    "we present numerical calculations of the phase diagram for one of the simplest possible many - body models incorporating both these effects , the hubbard - holstein model ( hhm ) in one dimension ( 1d ) . in the hhm ,",

    "the electrons further interact with other electrons with an onsite coulomb repulsion when two electrons occupy the same orbital @xcite .",
    "surprisingly complex effects result from this simple model due to the presence of both e - e and e - ph interactions .",
    "the 1d hhm hamiltonian we consider is @xmath2 where @xmath3 are creation ( annihilation ) operators for electrons on site @xmath4 with spin @xmath5 , @xmath6 are bosonic creation ( annihilation ) operators for phonons at site @xmath4 , and the electron number operator @xmath7 .",
    "@xmath0 is the hubbard onsite e - e interaction energy , @xmath8 is the dispersionless phonon frequency , and @xmath9 is the e - ph coupling constant .",
    "all energies in this paper will be given in units of @xmath10 , the electron hopping integral .",
    "we will concentrate primarily on eq.[ham ] in the half - filled band limit ( one electron per lattice site ) , but also discuss briefly the quarter - filled band ( one electron per two lattice sites ) .",
    "the effect of e - ph interactions on a half - filled 1d metal is well known : for inter - molecular phonons corresponding to the relative motion of adjacent molecules in the crystal , the 1d lattice dimerizes with alternating strong and weak bonds . in this bond - order wave ( bow )",
    "state the expectation value of the electron hopping between adjacent sites alternates between strong and weak values .",
    "the dimerized chain then has a gap at the fermi level and an insulating ground state @xcite .",
    "this peierls state has both charge and spin gaps , and a bond modulation at 2k@xmath11 ( @xmath12 ) at half filling . for holstein - type phonons that couple to the local charge density",
    "a similar peierls state occurs , but instead of bond deformation the local charge density is modulated in a charge density wave ( cdw ) ground state .",
    "the cdw peierls state at half filling has alternating large and small charge densities again with periodicity 2k@xmath11 .",
    "similarly , the effect of the hubbard onsite interaction in 1d is well known : for any @xmath13 at half filling , the ground state is an insulator @xcite .",
    "anti - ferromagnetic ( afm ) spin correlations are present in this mott insulating state , although no long - range antiferromagnetic order is possible in 1d . at half filling , the 2k@xmath11 cdw can not coexist with 2k@xmath11 afm correlations and hence the peierls and afm states are competing .    numerous previous studies have examined hhm within various approximations and analytic or numerical techniques . in the limit @xmath14 one can integrate out the phonons leaving an effective @xmath0 composed of the sum of the hubbard @xmath0 and the effective phonon interaction , @xmath15 . for @xmath16",

    "the system is metallic at @xmath20 also for @xmath9 less than a finite value .",
    "however , an important distinction between @xmath22 results and those presented here is that at @xmath22 , the mott insulating transition occurs at a finite value of @xmath0 , @xmath23 , while at @xmath24 it occurs for @xmath13 .",
    "some similarities are found with our results , in particular that there is a deviation in the critical coupling for the peierls transition from @xmath25 at small @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "given that in the half - filled 1d hhm at @xmath20 the ground state is metallic ( no charge gap and a finite drude weight ) for a finite value of @xmath9 , it was proposed that this metallic phase continues to exist _ between _ the peierls and mott insulating phases for @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "subsequent numerical calculations confirmed that a metallic phase exists for both @xmath20 and finite @xmath0 @xcite . in this paper , we present more detailed numerical results and analysis of the phase diagram .",

    "we find that for larger @xmath0 , the two transitions merge into a single first - order mott / peierls transition . in our revised analysis , we find that the apparent presence of the luttinger liquid ( ll ) exponent @xmath26 @xcite _ does not _ imply dominant superconducting pairing correlations , but is more likely a finite - size effect .",

    "we comment on the expected effect of @xmath112 further below . as quarter filling",

    "there are however significant differences between half - filled and quarter - filled peierls states . at quarter",
    "filling there are more than one possible pattern of charge and bond distortion , and which one actually occurs depends on the values of @xmath0 as well as @xmath112 @xcite . in the absence of phonons ,",
    "the quarter - filled band for finite @xmath0 is a ll with neither charge nor spin gaps .",
    "as at half filling , @xmath144 and @xmath145 are degenerate at @xmath20 ( note that 2k@xmath146 at quarter filling and corresponds to a correlation function with period 4 in real space ) . in the presence of phonons",
    ", we again expect the charge susceptibility @xmath147 to diverge .",
    "our sse results show that the hhm at quarter filling is in many respects similar to the half - filled case . in fig .",
    "[ u1w1-qtr ] we show @xmath147 and @xmath78 versus @xmath93 .",
    "we again find two transitions : first a transition to a spin - gapped state , and second the transition to the peierls state .",
    "as at half filling , the spin gap opens very close to the point where @xmath148 .",
    "the phase diagram at quarter filling is therefore nearly identical to the phase diagram at half filling , with ll , intermediate , and peierls phases .",
    "we find that the intermediate phase is slightly wider at quarter than half filling .",
    "for example , at quarter filling with @xmath104 and @xmath139 ( fig .",

    "we do not have enough sse data to investigate whether the tricritical point @xmath117 occurs as at half filling , but in our data at quarter filling we do find that with increasing @xmath0 @xmath98 and @xmath88 become closer together .",
    "this suggests that a tricritical point also exists at quarter filling .    at quarter filling there are two possible cdw s that are period-4 ( 2k@xmath11 ) .",
    "these have charge densities in cartoon form of either @xmath1531100@xmath153 or @xmath1532000@xmath153 , where `` 1 '' or `` 2 '' indicates a charge density greater than the average density of 0.5 and `` 0 '' indicates a charge density less than the average @xcite . the pattern @xmath1532000@xmath153 is found in the uncorrelated ( @xmath20 ) band . in fig .",
    "[ qtr - chgchg ] we plot the real - space charge - charge correlation function @xmath154 versus distance @xmath155 for a range of @xmath9 s in the three phases .",
    "we find that the charge - charge correlation function peaks for sites separated by four lattice sites , consistent with a cdw state of the @xmath1532000@xmath153 form .",
    "the strength of the cdw correlations does not greatly change going from the ll to the intermediate phase , but increases rapidly after the peierls transition . in the @xmath1532000@xmath153 cdw , the three small charges are not exactly equal , and the actual charge densities are in sequence large , medium , small , medium ( lmsm ) .",
    "this charge pattern coexists with a bow because l - m and m - s bonds are inequivalent .",
    "[ qtr - chgchg ] shows that the charge correlations follow this lmsm pattern as expected .",
    "we conclude that the pairing at quarter filling in the hhm consists of onsite electron pairs as found at half filling , at least for the small through intermediate @xmath0 we have currently investigated .",
    "the distinction between these two cdw patterns at quarter filling is important because while @xmath1532000@xmath153 is related to _",
    "onsite _ electron pairs , the more extended cdw @xmath1531100@xmath153 is related to _ nearest - neighbor _ pairing . the @xmath1531100@xmath153 requires bond - coupled phonons in addition to the holstein phonons considered here @xcite .",
    "in addition , the pattern of the bow ( the location of the `` strong '' bond ) coexisting with the @xmath1531100@xmath153 cdw also depends on the strength of @xmath112 @xcite .",
    "if a similar metallic phase exists adjacent to the @xmath1531100@xmath153 cdw , it is possible that a region of nearest - neighbor superconducting pairing will be found that may be relevant to real quarter - filled molecular superconductors .",
    "to summarize , we have presented numerical data for charge and spin correlations of the 1d hhm model at half and quarter filling .",
    "we have based our phase diagram on charge and spin susceptibilities , which provide direct indication of phase boundaries with much weaker finite - size effects than previous calculations based on ll exponents @xcite .",
    "we find that the spin gap and peierls transitions do not occur simultaneously unless @xmath0 is larger than a critical @xmath117 . for @xmath116 as the e - ph coupling",
    "is increased from zero , the spin gap opens _ before _ the peierls state forms .",
    "the intermediate state is metallic with a spin gap but no charge gap , and the transitions to and from the intermediate state are of the kt type .",
    "our physical picture of the intermediate state is that at the spin gap transition ( @xmath98 ) , pairs are formed , but are disordered and do not order in a peierls state until the e - ph coupling is further increased . for @xmath113 ,",
    "the two transitions merge into a single first - order mott / peierls transition . with finite - size calculations we can not completely discount the possibility of a small charge gap",
    "( small compared to the finite - size gap ) in the intermediate region .",
    "however , finite charge stiffness ( drude weight ) provides further evidence for metallic behavior in the intermediate state @xcite .",
    "comparing to other calculations , the critical coupling we determined for @xmath88 at @xmath20 is consistent with previous results @xcite .",
    "the variational results of reference find the intermediate phase existing in a narrow region on both sides of the @xmath25 line , while we find the intermediate phase only for @xmath17 .",
    "several calculations of the single - particle spectral function are available for the hhm @xcite , the spinless holstein model @xcite , as well as the @xmath22 studies previously mentioned . in reference",
    "@xcite using a cluster perturbation theory method applied to the 1d hhm , a small nearly dispersionless peak was found in the spectral function for small @xmath156 .",
    "this small peak is also found in the spectral function of the metallic phase of the spinless holstein model and may possibly be associated with the intermediate phase .",
    "considering the possible modification of the ll equations in the presence of retarded e - ph interactions , we find that while this could possibly occur in a form that would agree with reference , the amount of renormalization is small ( @xmath157 ) , and possibly within finite - size errors in our determination of the transition points .",
    "we also do not see any measurable or consistent change in the constant @xmath131 when comparing @xmath139 and @xmath83 , which would be expected to change the amount of retardation in the e - ph interaction .",
    "we are not able to calculate a value for @xmath132 in eq .",
    "[ krho - renorm - ss ] .",
    "however , if eq .",
    "[ krho - renorm - ss ] is correct for the hhm model with @xmath135 , ss correlations would actually be _ enhanced _ because of retardation @xcite .",
    "an important question is the strength of ss correlations within the intermediate region . in terms of the ll framework ,",
    "models with @xmath26 have dominant superconducting correlations .",
    "indeed , our numerical data appears to show @xmath26 in the intermediate region , but this result is likely to be a finite - size effect .",
    "if we set aside any renormalization of @xmath73 , our conclusion based on comparison with the 1d negative-@xmath0 hubbard model is that in the intermediate region , @xmath73 is _ exactly _ equal to one .",
    "this implies that in the intermediate region that cdw and ss correlations are in fact _",
    "exactly degenerate_. this exact degeneracy may not be easily observable in a finite system due to the finite size difficulties near kt transitions . as the sse method is based on a world - line approach in imaginary time",
    ", there is no simple way to measure correlations involving four particles , which would be needed to measure ss correlations directly .",
    "other qmc @xcite and dmrg @xcite calculations suggest that while ss and cdw correlations are nearly degenerate in the intermediate region , cdw correlations appear slightly stronger at long range .",
    "dmrg results for a ladder system suggest that going beyond 1d can break the degeneracy , giving a region with dominant ss correlations @xcite .",
    "finally , we remark that in addition to the logarithmic scaling difficulties , observing metallic behavior in close proximity to a cdw is difficult due to the typically rapidly increasing autocorrelation time for qmc methods .",
