    "blazars are the most extreme class of active galactic nuclei ( agns ) characterized by the emission of strong non - thermal radiation across the entire electromagnetic spectrum , from radio to very high @xmath1-ray energies .",
    "the typical observational properties of blazars include irregular , rapid and often very large variability , apparent super - luminal motion of the jet at vlbi scales , flat radio spectrum , high and variable polarization at radio and optical frequencies .",
    "these features are interpreted as the result of the emission of electromagnetic radiation from a relativistic jet that is viewed closely aligned to the line of sight , thus causing strong relativistic amplification ( blandford @xmath6 rees 1978 ; urry @xmath6 padovani 1995 ) .    the egret instrument onboard @xmath7",
    "@xmath8-@xmath9 @xmath10 detected for the first time strong and variable @xmath1-ray emission from blazars in the mev - gev region . in conjunction with ground - based cherenkov telescopes and coordinated multiwavelength observations ,",
    "this provided evidence that the spectral energy distributions ( seds ) of blazars are typically double - humped with the first peak occurring in the ir / optical band for the so - called @xmath11 @xmath12 ( including flat spectrum radio quasars , fsrqs , and low - energy peaked bl lacs , lbls ) and at uv / x - rays for the so - called @xmath13 @xmath12 ( including high - energy peaked bl lacs , hbls ) .",
    "the first peak is commonly interpreted as synchrotron radiation from high - energy electrons in a relativistic jet . the sed second component , peaking at mev - gev energies in @xmath11 @xmath12 and at tev energies in @xmath13 @xmath12 , is commonly interpreted as inverse compton ( ic ) scattering of seed photons , internal or external to the jet , by relativistic electrons ( ulrich et al . , 1997 ) , although other models have been proposed ( see e.g. , bttcher 2007 for a recent review ) .",
    "blazars with greater bolometric luminosity have smaller peak frequencies and `` redder '' seds , while blazars of lower bolometric luminosity have higher peak frequencies and then are `` bluer '' ( fossati et al . , 1998 ) .",
    "this spectral sequence was interpreted by ghisellini et al .",
    "( 1998 ) as consequence of the different radiative cooling suffered by the emitting electrons of blazars of different power .    with the detection of several blazars in the @xmath1-rays by egret ( hartman et al . , 1999",
    ") the study of this class of objects has made significant progress .",
    "in fact , considering that the large fraction of the total power of blazars is emitted in the @xmath1-rays , information in this band is crucial to study the different radiation models .",
    "the interest in blazars is now even more renewed thanks to the simultaneous presence of two @xmath1-ray satellites , agile and @xmath14 , and the possibility to obtain @xmath1-ray observations simultaneously with multiwavelength data collected from radio to tev energies will allow us to reach a deeper insight on the jet structure and the emission mechanisms at work in blazars .",
    "pks 1510@xmath0089 is a highly polarized radio - loud quasar at redshift z = 0.361 belonging to the class of the fsrqs with radiative output dominated by the @xmath1-ray emission , while the synchrotron emission peaks around ir frequencies below a pronunced uv bump , likely due to the thermal emission from the accretion disc ( malkan @xmath6 moore 1986 ; pian @xmath6 treves 1993 ) .",
    "its radio emission exhibited very rapid , large amplitude variations in both total and polarized flux ( aller , aller , @xmath6 hughes 1996 ) .",
    "the radio jet shows superluminal motion up to 20@xmath15 , with the parsec and kiloparsec scale jets misaligned of 177 degrees ( wardle et al . , 2005 ) .",
    "pks 1510@xmath0089 has been extensively observed in x - rays in the last three decades from the first observation by @xmath16 ( canizares and white 1989 ) up to a long - term monitoring performed by @xmath17 in july ",
    "august 2009 in the context of an extensive multifrequency campaign on this source , whose results will be presented in a forthcoming paper ( dammando et al . , in preparation ) .",
    "the x - ray spectrum of the source observed by asca in the 210 kev band ( singh , shrader , @xmath6 george 1997 ) was very flat ( with photon index @xmath18 @xmath19 1.3 ) , but steepened in the @xmath20 bandpass below 2 kev ( @xmath18 @xmath19 1.9 ) , suggesting the possible presence of a spectral break around 12 kev , associated with the existence of a soft x - ray excess .",
    "observations by @xmath21 ( tavecchio et al . , 2000 ) and chandra ( gambill et al . , 2003 ) confirms the presence of a soft x - ray excess below 1 kev .",
    "a similar soft excess has been detected in other blazars such as 3c 273 , 3c 279 and 3c 454.3 , even if the origin of the soft x - ray excess is still an open issue , not only for blazars but for all agns ( see e.g. dammando et al .",
    ", 2008a for a discussion on the soft x - ray excess problem in the radio - quiet agns ) .",
    "a monitoring campaign on this source was organized during august 2006 by @xmath22 and @xmath17 .",
    "the @xmath22 observations confirm the presence of a soft x - ray excess , suggesting that it could be a feature of the bulk comptonization , whereas the @xmath17/xrt observations reveal significant spectral evolution of the x - ray emission on timescales of a week : the x - ray spectrum becomes harder as the source gets brighter ( kataoka et al . , 2008 ) .",
    "gamma - ray emission from pks 1510@xmath0089 has been detected in the past by egret during low / intermediate states with an integrated flux above 100 mev varying between ( 13 @xmath23 5 ) and ( 49 @xmath23 18 ) @xmath2 10@xmath3 photons @xmath4 s@xmath5 . instead in the last two years this source showed an intense @xmath1-ray activity with several flaring episodes detected by agile and @xmath14 .    in this paper",
    "we present the results of the analysis of the agile , _ swift _ , gasp - webt and rem data obtained during the multiwavelength observations of pks 1510@xmath0089 performed in august 2007 , march 2008 , and march 2009 . throughout the paper",
    "the quoted uncertainties are given at 1-@xmath24 level , unless otherwise stated .",
    "pks 1510@xmath0089 was detected for the first time by agile in high @xmath1-ray activity during the period 23 august  1 september 2007 , as reported in pucella et al .",
    "agile detected the source in a very bright state , with an average flux of @xmath25 = ( 195 @xmath23 30 ) @xmath2 10@xmath3 photons @xmath4 s@xmath5 between 28 august and 1 september 2007 .",
    "the simultaneous optical monitoring of the glast agile support program ( gasp ) of the whole earth blazar telescope ( webt ) showed that pks 1510@xmath0089 was in optical decrease during the period of the agile observation , following a bright state in mid august with the source at @xmath26 = 15.0 mag .",
    "the sed is modelled with a synchrotron self compton ( ssc ) + external compton ( ec ) emissions .",
    "the ic scattering of external photons from the blr seems to explain the observed hard @xmath1-ray spectrum observed by agile .    after this flaring episode",
    "many more @xmath1-ray flares of pks 1510@xmath0089 were detected by the agile and @xmath14 satellites between march 2008 ( dammando et al . , 2008b ) and april 2009 ( cutini et al . , 2009 ) .",
    "during a pointing toward the galactic center region , between 1 and 30 march 2008 , agile detected a rapid @xmath1-ray flare from pks 1510@xmath0089 , as discussed in detail in dammando et al .",
    "( 2009a ) . after two episodes of medium intensity",
    "the source was not detected for some days in the @xmath1-ray band and suddenly a rapid flare was observed by agile on 18 - 19 march ( see fig . 1 , left panel ) .    during the period 116 march 2008 ,",
    "agile detected an average flux from pks 1510@xmath0089 of ( 84 @xmath23 17 ) @xmath2 10@xmath3 photons @xmath4 s@xmath5 for e @xmath27 100 mev .",
    "the flux measured between 17 and 21 march was a factor of 2 higher , with a peak level of ( 281 @xmath23 68 ) @xmath2 10@xmath3 photons @xmath4 s@xmath5 on 19 march 2008 .",
    "moreover , between january and april 2008 the source showed an intense and variable optical activity with several flaring episodes of fast variability .",
    "peaks were detected by gasp - webt in the optical band on 15 february , 29 march and 11 april 2008 ( see fig .",
    "1 , right panel ) .",
    "a significant increase of the flux was observed also at millimetric frequencies in mid april , suggesting that the mechanisms producing the flaring events in the optical and @xmath1-ray bands also interested the millimetric zone , with a delay .",
    "the @xmath1-ray flare triggered 3 too observations with @xmath17 in three consecutive days between 20 and 22 march 2008 .",
    "the first xrt observation showed a very hard x - ray photon index ( @xmath18 = 1.16 @xmath23 0.16 ) with a flux in the 0.310 kev band of ( 1.22 @xmath23 0.17 ) x 10@xmath28 erg @xmath4 s@xmath5 and a decrease of the flux of about 30@xmath29 between 20 and 21 march .",
    "moreover , the @xmath17/xrt observations seem to show a harder - when - brighter behaviour of the spectrum in the x - ray band , confirming a behaviour already observed in this source by kataoka et al .",
    "this is a trend usually observed in hbl such as mrk 421 ( see e.g. tramacere et al . , 2007 ) but quite rare in fsrqs such as pks 1510@xmath0089 .",
    "this harder - when - brighter behaviour is likely due to the different variability of the ssc and ec components , therefore to the change of the relative contribution of each component .",
    "thus , the x - ray photon index observed on 20 march could be due to the combination of ssc and ec emission and therefore to the mismatch of the spectral slopes of these two components .",
    "the sed for the agile observation of 1721 march 2008 together with the simultaneous data collected in radio , mm , near - ir , and optical bands by gasp - webt and uv and x - ray bands by @xmath17 is modelled with thermal emission of the disc , ssc model plus the contribution by the external compton scattering of direct disc radiation and of photons reprocessed by the broad line region ( blr ; see fig .",
    "2 , left panel ) .",
    "some features in the optical - uv spectrum seem to indicate the presence of seyfert - like components , such as the little and big blue bumps ( see also fig .",
    "2 , right panel ) .",
    "pks 1510@xmath0089 showed an extraordinary @xmath1-ray activity during march 2009 , with several flaring episodes that could be an overlapping of different events ( see fig .",
    "3 , left panel ) . after a low intensity period in february 2009 ,",
    "the optical activity of the source is also greatly increased in march 2009 with an intense flare on 2526 march ( see fig . 3 right panel ) .",
    "a similar behaviour was observed by the rem telescope , with an achromatic variation in the near - infrared and optical bands .",
    "taking into account that the dip at the uvw1 frequency it is also found for other blazars with different redshift and could be systematic , the data collected from radio - to - uv on 25 - 26 march 2009 ( fig .",
    "3 , right panel ) seem to show a flat spectrum in the optical / uv energy band , suggesting an important contribution of the synchrotron emission in this part of the spectrum during the huge flaring episode and therefore a possible shift of the synchrotron peak , usually observed in this source in the infrared band .    during the 14 too observations performed in march 2009 , @xmath17/xrt observed the source in an intermediate state with a 0.310 kev flux in the range ( 7.5  10.8 ) @xmath2 10@xmath30 erg @xmath4 s@xmath5 .",
    "the x - ray flux seems not to be correlated with the high optical and @xmath1-ray activity .",
    "a hard x - ray outburst of this source was detected by @xmath17/bat on 9 march 2009 , with a rise from 15 mcrab to 40 mcrab in 24 hours .",
    "on 10 march the source faded below the bat sensitivity ( krimm et al . ,",
    "it is interesting to note that this outburst in the 1550 kev energy band occurred just at the beginning of the @xmath1-ray activity observed by agile .",
    "the results of the multiwavelength campaign of march 2009 will be presented in dammando et al .",
