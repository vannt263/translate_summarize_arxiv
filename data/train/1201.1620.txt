    "few years ago ellegaard et al . studied the influence of the flip symmetry breaking in quartz blocks on their spectral statistics @xcite .",
    "crystalline quartz exhibits a @xmath0 point - group symmetry about the crystal s @xmath1 ( optical ) axis and three two - fold rotation symmetries about the three @xmath2 ( piezoelectric ) axes ; the latter three axes lie in a plane orthogonal to the @xmath1 axis and sustain angles of 120@xmath3 with respect to each other .",
    "ellegaard et al.@xcite used rectangular blocks of dimensions @xmath4",
    "@xmath5 @xmath6 @xmath7 mm@xmath8 , cut in such a way that all symmetries are fully broken except a two - fold ` flip ' symmetry about one of the three @xmath2 axes . in order to break the flip symmetry , ellegaard et al removed an octant of  a sphere with a successfully increasing radius from one corner of the rectangular block .",
    "the breaking of the flip symmetry causes the eigenmodes belonging to the two different representations to interact and mix .",
    "as the radius is made larger , the nearest - neighbor - spacing ( nns ) distribution makes a fast transition from a distribution of two non - interacting spectra towards the distribution of one chaotic system without symmetries .",
    "full chaos was attained at an octant radius of @xmath9 mm , as the cut block had the shape of a three -dimensional sinai billiard .",
    "a problem like this is found , e.g. , in nuclear physics where isospin symmetry , characteristic of the strong interactions , is only approximate due to coulomb effects @xcite .",
    "isospin mixing was analyzed by guhr and weidenmller using a random matrix approach @xcite .",
    "they used a random matrix model to describe experimental data and to estimate the average symmetry - breaking matrix element , i.e. , the average coulomb matrix element .",
    "the random matrix ensemble consists of matrices @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is block - diagonal , here two blocks for the two - fold symmetry , each a member of the goe ; @xmath12 couples the blocks , breaking the symmetry .",
    "level statistics were studied within this model analytically by leitner @xcite .",
    "he assumed that the probability density of spacing belonging to the same block are unaffected by the coupling matrix @xmath12 .",
    "he took into account the interaction between pairs of levels belonging to different blocks , yielding linear dependence of the spacing distribution near the origin .",
    "taking into account the interaction between more than two levels might lead to fractional - level repulsion as recently shown by bcker et al . @xcite . while leitner s formalism is a perturbation - theory approach , which is valid only for small @xmath12 ,",
    "he has used it as a model for the whole symmetry breaking process in quartz - block data @xcite .",
    "el - hady et al .",
    "@xcite described the transition by introducing a third goe sequence which increased in the expense of the initial two independent sequences . to fit the data in ref .",
    "@xcite , the authors assumed  that the initial sequence are pseudointegrable ( for definition , see the discussion following eq .",
    "( [ sp ] ) below ) .",
    "this independent - sequence model of symmetry breaking was further elaborated in @xcite , where a relation between the fractional level density of each sequence is related to the mean squared symmetry - breaking matrix element .",
    "de carvalho et al .",
    "@xcite take into account the interaction of the three level sequences using the perturbation method suggested by leitner @xcite .",
    "in the present paper we perform an analysis of data in ref .",
    "@xcite using a superstatistical generalization of random matrix theory ( rmt ) @xcite .",
    "we are motivated by the success of the superstatistical approach to describe the final stages of the transition from integrability to chaos .",
    "a brief account of this approach is given in section 2 .",
    "section 3 reports the results of the superstatistical analysis of symmetry breaking .",
    "we also compare the results our work with that of ref .",
    "@xcite . a discussion of the results of this contribution is given in section 4 .",
    "the concept of superstatistics was introduced by beck and cohen @xcite to describe deviation of thermodynamic system from equilibrium .",
    "this concept has been successfully applied to a wide variety of physical problems , including turbulence @xcite , plasma physics @xcite , cosmic - ray statistics @xcite , cancer survival @xcite , and econophysics @xcite .",
    "the application of the superstatistics to rmt @xcite assumes the spectrum of a mixed system as made up of many smaller cells that are temporarily in a chaotic phase .",
    "each cell is large enough to obey the statistical requirements of rmt but has a different distribution parameter @xmath13 associated with it , according to a probability density @xmath14 .",
    "consequently , the superstatistical random matrix ensemble that describes the mixed system is a mixture of gaussian ensembles .",
    "the joint probability density distribution of the matrix elements is obtained by integrating distributions of the form@xmath15 \\label{rmt}\\ ] ] over all positive values with a statistical weight @xmath14 , which leads to @xmath16}{z(\\eta)}d\\eta\\label{sust}\\ ] ] where @xmath17dh,$ ]    one of the fundamental assumptions of rmt is that the matrix element joint probability density distribution is base independent .",
    "this makes the theory suitable for modelling quantum chaotic systems .",
    "indeed , the eigenfunctions of a hamiltonian of a system with a chaotic classical limit are unknown in principle . in other words",
    ", there is no special basis to express the eigenstates of a chaotic system . in integrable systems , on the other hand , the eigenbasis of the hamiltonian is known in principle . in this basis , each eigenfunction has just one component that obviously indicates the absence of complexity . in the nearly ordered regime , mixing of quantum states belonging to adjacent levels can be ignored and the energy levels are uncorrelated .      the distribution @xmath14 is determined by the spatiotemporal dynamics of the entire system under consideration .",
    "beck et al.@xcite have argued that typical experimental data are described by one of three superstatistical universality classes , namely , @xmath18 , inverse @xmath18 or log - normal superstatistics .",
    "the first universality holds if @xmath13  has contribution from @xmath19 gaussian random variables @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 due to various relevant degrees of freedom in the system .",
    "then a positive @xmath13 is obtained by setting @xmath23 is and @xmath24 is a @xmath18 distributed with degree @xmath25@xmath26 here , @xmath27 is the average value of @xmath28 with @xmath29    in the second universality class , the same considerations as above can be applied if  @xmath30 rather than @xmath13 , is the sum of several squared gaussian random variables .",
    "the resulting @xmath24 is the inverse- @xmath18 distribution given by@xmath31 in the third universality class , instead of being a sum of many contributions , the random variable @xmath13  may be generated by multiplicative random processes , i.e. @xmath32 . then @xmath33 is a sum of gaussian random variables ; hence it is gaussian as well .",
    "thus is log - normally distributed , i.e.,@xmath34^{2}/2\\nu^{2}},\\ ] ] which has an average @xmath35 and variance @xmath36 @xmath37 , where @xmath38@xmath39 .",
    "it follows from eq.([sust ] ) that the statistical measures of the eigenvalues of the superstatistical ensemble are obtained as an average of the corresponding @xmath13-dependent ones of standard rmt weighted with the parameter distribution @xmath24 .",
    "in particular , the superstatistical nns distribution is given by @xcite as@xmath40 where @xmath41 is the wigner surmise for the gaussian orthogonal ensemble with the mean spacing depending on the parameter,@xmath42 for a @xmath18 distribution of the superstatistical parameter @xmath13 the resulting nns distribution is given by@xmath43 the parameter @xmath27 is fixed by requiring that the mean level spacing @xmath44 equals unity , yielding @xmath45^{2}.\\ ] ] for an inverse @xmath18 distribution , one obtains@xmath46 where @xmath47 is a modified bessel function @xcite and @xmath48 again is determined by the requirement that the mean level spacing @xmath44 equals unity . finally ,",
    "if the parameter has a log- normal distribution ( 5 ) , then the nns distribution@xmath49d\\eta\\ ] ] can only be evaluated numerically .",
    "a justification for the use of the above - mentioned superstatistical generalization of rmt in the study of mixed systems , is given in @xcite .",
    "it is based on the representation of their energy spectra in the form of discrete time series in which the level order plays the role of time .",
    "reference @xcite considers two billiards with mushroom - shaped boundaries as representatives of systems with mixed regular ",
    "chaotic dynamics and three with the shape of limaon billiards , one of them of chaotic and two of mixed dynamics .",
    "the time series analysis in ref .",
    "@xcite allows to derive a parameter distribution @xmath14 .",
    "the obtained distribution agrees better with the inverse @xmath18 distribution given by eq .",
    "( [ invchi ] ) .",
    "the inverse @xmath18 distribution of @xmath13 follows when the quantity @xmath13  is the sum of @xmath19 inverse - squared gaussian random variables . in the application to rmt ,",
    "the parameter @xmath13 is proportional to the sum of the inverse variances of the matrix elements of @xmath50 @xcite .",
    "hence , @xmath19 refers to the number of ( largely ) contributing matrix elements . in the limit of @xmath51 where all the matrix - elements contribute to the distribution , eq .",
    "( [ invchi ] ) yields a delta function for @xmath52 turning superstatistical matrix - element distribution ( [ sust ] ) into that of the conventional rmt , eq .",
    "( [ rmt ] ) . if we take this assumption literarily , we must restrict @xmath19 to take positive integer values . as the transition from integrability to chaos",
    "is known to proceed continuously , we have to relax this condition and allow @xmath19 to take any real value grater than 1 . using the asymptotic expression of the modified bessel function @xcite",
    ", we easily find the wigner surmise when @xmath53 , as required .",
    "the other limit of @xmath54 yields the semi - poisson distribution@xmath55 which is known to provide a satisfactory description for the spectra of pseudointegrable systems such as planar polygonal billiards , when all their angles are rational with @xmath56 @xcite .",
    "the motion of the corresponding classical systems in phase space is not restricted to a torus like for integrable systems , but to a surface with a more complicated topology @xcite .",
    "we therefore conclude that the assumption that the inverse square of the variance of matrix elements as an inverse @xmath18 variable allows superstatistical rmt to model the transition out of chaos ( corresponding to @xmath57 until the system reaches the state of quasi - integrability .",
    "it is interesting to note that , if one allows @xmath19 to take lower values , one finds that the distribution @xmath58 tends to the poisson distribution as @xmath59;@xmath60 we there conclude that formula ( [ ps2 ] ) can provide a successful model for describing the stochastic transition all the way from integrability to chaos passing by the stage of quasi - integrability .",
    "this has been clearly demonstrated in ref .",
    "we have no physical explanation for this success .",
    "we regard @xmath61 in the range of @xmath62 as a clever parametrization of nns distribution of nearly integrable systems undergoing a transition from a poisson to semi - poisson statistics .",
    "our purpose here is to show that the superstatistical rmt is suitable for the analysis of chaotic systems undergoing a process leading to the breaking  of a discrete symmetry . in our view , symmetry breaking has something in common with the transition from integrability to chaos .",
    "the presence of a symmetry favors the particular bases in which the eigenvectors of the symmetry are components of the eigenstates of the hamiltonian ( e.g. , the isospin wavefunctions in the nuclear physics problem ) . in this representation ,",
    "the hamiltonian matrix is block diagonal and its spectrum consists of independent sequence of eigenvalues . as symmetry breaking interactions increase , the eigenstates involved in the different blocks mix filling the `` empty '' places in the hamiltonian matrix . at a certain stage of the symmetry breaking transition , the bases in which the eigenvectors of the symmetry are components of the eigenstates of the hamiltonian loose their special status . the joint matrix - element distribution becomes base independent . at this point , we expect superstatistical rmt to become suitable for describing the symmetry breaking process with the superstatistical parameter @xmath19 measuring the number of effective matrix elements responsible for symmetry breaking .    in the quartz crystal experiment @xcite , the authors noted that the block with conserved flip symmetry has much in common with a scalar pseudointegrable system @xcite .",
    "the initial state of the transition can be described by an independent superposition of two independent semi - poissonian sequences of equal densities . applying the method given in mehta s book @xcite",
    ", we obtain for nns distribution@xmath63 we have found out that the least square difference between @xmath64 and the superstatistical distribution ( [ ps2 ] ) in the spacing interval @xmath65,@xmath66 has a minimum at @xmath67 . in the following ,",
    "we show that nns distributions of resonances in the quartz crystal experiment @xcite , the authors noted that the initial state of the transition can be described by the distribution ( [ ps2 ] ) allover the symmetry breaking transition by allowing @xmath19 to vary in the range of @xmath68 .    in figure 1",
    ", we compare the experimental results of the acoustic resonances measured by ellegaard et al .",
