    "weak - scale supersymmetry provides a well - documented solution to the technical hierarchy problem  @xcite , which is particularly difficult to solve in a perturbatively calculable model .",
    "specialising to a minimal extension of the standard model , the mssm , one can provide a weakly interacting massive particle dark matter candidate , provided @xmath16parity is respected by the model",
    ". examples of dark matter candidates are the gravitino  @xcite , the axino  @xcite and the lightest neutralino  @xcite , the subject of much recent investigation  @xcite .",
    "the general mssm is rather complicated due to the large number of free parameters in the supersymmetric ( susy ) breaking sector .",
    "however , the observed rareness of flavour changing neutral currents ( fcncs ) suggests that the vast majority of parameter space for general susy breaking terms is ruled out .",
    "particular patterns of susy breaking parameters can postdict small enough fcncs : for instance flavour universality .",
    "one highly studied subset of such terms is that of msugra , often called the constrained minimal supersymmetric standard model ( cmssm ) . in msugra , at some high energy scale ( typically taken to be the scale of unification of electroweak gauge couplings ) , all of the susy breaking scalar mass terms are assumed to be equal to @xmath0 , the scalar trilinear terms are set to @xmath1 and the gaugino masses are set equal ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "these are indeed strong assumptions , but they have several advantages for phenomenological analysis as the number of independent susy breaking parameters is much reduced . indeed , assuming that the mssm is the correct model , the initial data from the tevatron or large hadron collider are likely to contain only a few relevant observables and so one may be able to fit against a simple susy breaking model as an example  @xcite . as the data become more accurate and additional relevant observables",
    "are measured , the lack of a good fit would propel extensions of the simple model .",
    "one may then start to consider patterns of non - universality , for instance .",
    "for the rest of this paper though , given the lack of data to the contrary , we will assume msugra .",
    "aside from the universal soft terms @xmath17 , other non - standard model msugra input parameters are taken to be @xmath18 , the ratio of the two higgs vacuum expectation values , and the sign of @xmath19 ( a parameter that appears in the higgs potential of the mssm ) .    when combined with large scale structure data , the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap )  @xcite has placed stringent constraints upon the dark matter relic density @xmath9 . a common assumption , which we will adhere to here , is that the neutralino makes up the entire cold dark matter relic density .",
    "the prediction of the relic density of dark matter in the mssm depends crucially upon annihilation cross - sections , since in the early universe susy particles will annihilate in the thermal bath .",
    "regions of msugra that are compatible with the wmap constraint often predict some of the following annihilation channels  @xcite :    * stau ( @xmath20 ) co - annihilation  @xcite at small @xmath0 where the lightest stau is quasi - degenerate with the lightest neutralino ( @xmath21 ) .",
    "* pseudoscalar higgs ( @xmath22 ) funnel region at large @xmath23 where two neutralinos annihilate through an @xmath24-channel @xmath22 resonance  @xcite .",
    "* light cp - even higgs ( @xmath25 ) region at low @xmath2 where two neutralinos annihilate through an @xmath24-channel @xmath25 resonance  @xcite",
    ". * focus point  @xcite at large @xmath0 where a significant higgsino component leads to efficient neutralino annihilation into gauge boson pairs . *",
    "stop co - annihilation  @xcite at large @xmath26 , where the lightest stop is close in mass to the lightest neutralino .",
    "many pre - wmap analyses focused on the so - called bulk region  @xcite . the bulk region is continuously connected to the stau co - annihilation region at low @xmath0 and @xmath2 .",
    "there are two reasons why the bulk region has shrunk in size when one takes the current constraints into account : the wmap constraint upon the relic density has ruled much of the region out , and the new low value of the top mass mean that the mssm higgs mass predictions are sometimes too low for low @xmath0 and @xmath2 and are ruled out by lep2 constraints .",
    "the ( now reduced ) bulk region will make an implicit appearance in our results , and we will comment upon this fact later .",
    "several authors  @xcite have asked how the annihilation cross - section can be constrained by collider measurements in order to provide a more solid prediction of the relic density .",
    "this would then be fed into a cosmological model in order to predict @xmath9 for comparison with the value derived from cosmological observation , allowing a test of cosmological assumptions ( and the assumption that there is only one component of cold dark matter ) .",
    "of course , colliders could not unambiguously identify the lightest observed susy particle as the dark matter since it could always decay unobserved outside the detector .",
    "it would therefore be interesting to combine collider information with that derived from a possible future direct detection  @xcite of dark matter , providing corroboration and additional empirical information .",
    "before such observations are made , however , we may ask how well current data constrain models of new physics .    this question has been addressed many times for msugra by using the dark matter constraint .",
    "most of the analyses ( see , for example  @xcite ) fix all but two parameters and examine constraints upon the remaining 2 dimensional ( 2d ) slice of parameter space .",
    "the dark matter relic density constraint is the most limiting , but the branching ratio of the decay @xmath7 and the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon @xmath27 also rule part of the parameter space out .",
    "recent upper bounds from the tevatron experiments on the branching ratio @xmath28  @xcite have the potential to restrict msugra in the future , but the analysis of ref .",
    "@xcite shows that the resulting constraints currently subsumed within other constraints . in the above analyses , limits are typically imposed separately , each to some prescribed confidence level .",
    "such analyses have the advantage of being quite transparent : it is fairly easy to see which constraint rules out which part of parameter space .",
    "however , they have the disadvantages of not properly describing the combination of likelihoods coming from different experimental constraints and of having to assume _ ad hoc _ values for several input parameters . in particular , as well as the soft susy",
    "breaking input parameters , the bottom mass @xmath5 , the strong structure constant @xmath29 and the top mass @xmath4 can all have a strong effect on msugra predictions .",
    "a large random scan of flavour diagonal mssm space involving @xmath30 points that pass various prescribed constraints was presented in ref.@xcite , however the sampling of the 20d parameter space was necessarily sparse .",
    "the analysis is also subject to the limitation that likelihoods have not been combined ; instead the measurements have been used as cuts to discard points . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the likelihood from the observables is calculated , properly combining different constraints , but again 1d and 2d slices through parameter space were taken . of course the time taken to efficiently sample from a likelihood distribution using the naive method ( a scan ) scales like a power law with respect to the number of parameters , meaning that in practice even a high resolution 3d scan is difficult . by parameterising lines in 2d that are consistent with the wmap dark matter constraint and scanning in two other parameters , the analysis of ref .  @xcite calculates the @xmath31 statistic for the 2d part of a 3d parameter space which is consistent with the wmap constraint on the dark matter relic density . the predicted value of @xmath9 is not combined in the @xmath31 with the other observables for this analysis , and the parameter @xmath3 must be fixed .",
    "as the authors note  @xcite , parts of the scan were sparse . in ref .",
    "@xcite , a scan was performed which included variations of @xmath1 and @xmath3 as well as other msugra parameters .",
    "it is clear from this paper that the wmap allowed region ( expressed in the @xmath2-@xmath0 plane ) becomes much larger from the @xmath1 variations .",
    "no likelihood distribution was given .",
    "baltz and gondolo  @xcite demonstrated that a markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) algorithm efficiently samples from the msugra parameter space , rendering 4d scans in @xmath32 feasible .",
    "however , they were interested in which parts of parameter space are compatible with the wmap measurement of @xmath9 and what the prospects are for direct detection there , not in the likelihood distribution . in order to increase the efficiency of their parameter sampling , they changed the simple `` metropolis - hastings '' mcmc algorithm in order to achieve a better efficiency .",
    "as the authors state in their conclusions , this has the consequence that caution must be exercised when trying to interpret their results as a likelihood distribution .",
    "indeed , we will show in a toy model that changes to the mcmc algorithm like the ones that baltz and gondolo made can alter the sampling from a distribution .",
    "it is our purpose here to utilise the mcmc algorithm in such a way as to reliably calculate the combined likelihood of msugra in the full dimensionality of its parameter space , thereby extending the previous studies",
    ". we will then be able to infer what is known about the multi - dimensional parameter space , including important variations of the sm quantities .",
    "these results will have implications for collider searches and rare decays .",
    "in section  [ sec : mcmc ] , we briefly review the mcmc algorithm .",
    "we present the implementation used in the present paper to calculate the likelihood maps of msugra parameter space and then demonstrate that the results are convergent using a particular statistical test . in section  [ sec : lmaps ] , we present the likelihood distributions and derived quantities of the 7d msugra parameter space . in section  [ sec : uncertainties ] , we illustrate the effects of theoretical uncertainties in the sparticle spectrum calculation and in section  [ sec : other ] , possible effects from allowing an additional non thermal - neutralino component to the relic density are explored . a summary and conclusions are presented in section  [ sec : conc ] . in appendix",
    "[ sec : badsampling ] , we demonstrate with two different toy models that the algorithm used by baltz and gondolo may not provide a sampling proportional to the likelihood of the parameter space .",
    "some readers might be unfamiliar with the use of statistics in this paper , and so we include some comments on how to interpret them .",
    "the likelihood is _ not _ dependent upon any priors .",
    "the likelihood @xmath33 is the probability density function ( pdf ) of reproducing data @xmath34 assuming some msugra model @xmath35 . in @xmath36 , the model @xmath35",
    "is specified by the msugra input parameters and so @xmath36 has a dependence upon them .",
    "@xmath36 is related to the pdf of the model being the one chosen by nature , given the data , by an application of bayes theorem : @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the probability of the model being correct ( the _ prior _ ) and @xmath39 is the total probability of the data being reproduced , integrating over all possible models .",
    "@xmath39 is practically impossible to estimate , so we can not get the quantity that one really wishes to estimate , @xmath40 .",
    "however , we may compare the relative probabilities of two different models @xmath41 and @xmath42 ( corresponding here to different points of msugra space ) by applying eq .",
    "[ bayes ] for each model , implying that @xmath43 we note here the appearance of the infamous prior distributions @xmath44 .",
    "if one assumes that the ratio of these two priors is one ( that no region of parameter space is more likely than any other ) , one may interpret the likelihood ratio of two different points in msugra space as the ratio of probabilities of the models , given the data . in this paper",
    "however , we provide likelihood distributions . if the reader prefers a different ratio of priors to one , they must convolute the likelihood density we give with their preferred ratio of pdfs .",
    "we now briefly review the metropolis mcmc algorithm , but for a more thorough explanation , see refs .",
    "other adaptive scanning algorithms have recently been suggested in the context of high energy physics  @xcite but ( although they can be very useful for other purposes ) they do not yield a likelihood distribution .",
    "a markov chain consists of a list of parameter points ( @xmath45 ) and associated likelihoods ( @xmath46 ) . here",
    "@xmath47 labels the link number in the chain .",
    "given some point at the end of the markov chain ( @xmath45 ) , the metropolis - hastings algorithm involves randomly picking another potential point ( @xmath48 ) ( typically in the vicinity of @xmath49 ) using some proposal pdf @xmath50 . in this paper",
    "we will specialise to the case of symmetric proposal functions , i.e.  @xmath51 . if @xmath52 , the new point is appended onto the chain .",
    "otherwise , the proposed point is accepted with probability @xmath53 and , if accepted , added to the end of the chain .",
    "if the point @xmath48 is not accepted , the point @xmath49 is copied on to the end of the chain instead .",
    "providing `` detailed balance '' is satisfied , it can be shown  @xcite that the sampling density of points in the chain is proportional to the target distribution ( in this case , the likelihood ) as the number of links goes to infinity . in the context of this analysis ,",
    "detailed balance states that for any two points @xmath54 @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the probability of making a transition from @xmath57 to @xmath58 in the case where the proposal function is symmetric . thus , the probability of sampling a point @xmath57 from the likelihood distribution and then making a transition to @xmath58 be equal to the probability of sampling @xmath58 and making a transition to @xmath57 .",
    "the metropolis - hastings mcmc algorithm is typically much more efficient than a straightforward scan for @xmath59 ; the number of required steps scales roughly linearly with @xmath60 rather than as a power law .",
    "the sampling is in principle independent of the form of @xmath61 as @xmath62 as long as it is bigger than zero everywhere .",
    "however , @xmath61 must be chosen with some care : since in practice we can only sample a finite number of points , the choice of the form of @xmath61 can determine whether the entire parameter space is sampled and how quickly convergence is reached .",
    "baltz and gondolo used a geometrical model for @xmath61 : choosing a random distance from the point @xmath63 and using a direction that was calculated from the positions of previous points in the chain .",
    "the width of the random radius pdf was calculated depending upon previous points in the chain in order to increase the efficiency of the calculation , aiming to accept roughly 25@xmath13 of potential points .",
    "either of these changes upset detailed balance and may spoil the sampling .",
    "we demonstrate in appendix  [ sec : badsampling ] with toy models that the width changing modification gives a sampling that is not proportional to the target density .",
    ".parameter ranges considered .",
    "[ tab : prior ] [ cols=\"^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the mcmc algorithm turns out to be much more efficient once we drop the assumption that the cold dark matter consist only of neutralinos : 19.9@xmath13 efficiency was achieved compared to 4.1@xmath13 .",
    "one consequence of this is that statistical fluctuations in the results are smaller .",
    "the likelihoods in each region are shown in table  [ tab : regions3 ] .",
    "a comparison of tables  [ tab : regions],[tab : regions3 ] shows that annihilation through @xmath22 pole has acquired a significantly larger likelihood through allowing for other forms of dark matter .",

    "although there is plenty of qualitative information about possible dark matter annihilation regions in msugra in the literature , this paper gives a quantitative calculation of the likelihood distributions in the full dimensionality of the parameter space .",
    "however , the most important contribution of this paper lies in the implications of the results to particle physics .",
    "we have successfully employed an mcmc algorithm to provide likelihood maps of the full 7d input parameter space of msugra . by using a statistical test",
    ", we have shown that the likelihood distributions have achieved good convergence before a total of 9@xmath70 samplings of the likelihood .",
    "we have presented the likelihood marginalised down to each 2d msugra parameter pair .",
    "such plots provide the totality of the current information we have about the model given the experimental constraints and are quantitative results .",
    "theoretical uncertainties in the sparticle spectrum calculation broaden a couple of the distributions a little but do not change them radically .",
    "the main new contribution of this paper is to our knowledge of what current constraints on msugra mean for particle physics in a quantitative sense .",
    "marginalised 1d likelihood distributions of quantities such as sparticle masses ( or mass differences ) already show some significant structure from the data , providing interesting information for future collider searches .",
    "in particular , the likelihood of the `` golden cascade '' @xmath71 being kinematically allowed is 24@xmath15 .",
    "@xmath72 is peaked below 10 gev , implying that stau reconstruction at hadron colliders could be problematic at the lhc . integrating the likelihood density",

    "our likelihood distributions for @xmath74 corroborate the conclusions of ref .",
    "@xcite : that current bounds upon the branching ratio do not yet place significant constraints upon msugra once other constraints have been taken into account , but any improvement on the upper bounds constrain the currently available parameter space .",
    "the quantitative results on @xmath74 are particularly important : if the tevatron experiments can reach down to 2@xmath12 , they will cover 29@xmath13 of the msugra likelihood , or 35@xmath13 if we allow the possibility of additional contributions to the relic density other than thermal neutralinos .",
    "we have shown that the correlation between @xmath74 and @xmath75 noticed in ref .",
    "@xcite is much diluted once simultaneous variations of all msugra parameters are taken into account .",
    "the @xmath22-pole annihilation region and the stau co - annihilation region each have approximately an order of magnitude more likelihood than the @xmath25-pole region .",
    "stop co - annihilation is highly disfavoured compared to these other regions due to more restrictive higgs mass constraints coming from a lower value of @xmath4 , as well as the @xmath74 and @xmath75 predictions .",
    "the light @xmath76pole region just survives the lep2 higgs mass constraints despite the new reduced top mass value albeit with a reduced likelihood ( in the usual frequentist language , it s outside the 95@xmath13 confidence level but not the 99@xmath13 one ) .",

    ". other observables would presumably prefer heavier susy particles .",
    "however , @xmath77 and @xmath78 do show a preference for lower @xmath2 for @xmath80 gev .",

    "we suspect that the mcmc techniques exemplified here could be found extremely useful in susy fitting programs such as fittino  @xcite and sfitter  @xcite in order to provide a likelihood profile of the parameter space , including secondary local minima .",
    "these programs are designed to fit more general mssm models than msugra to data , with an associated increase in the number of free input parameters , so the linear calculating time of mcmcs ought to be very useful .",
    "while our results presented for msugra are in themselves interesting , it is obvious that the method will be applicable in a much wider range of circumstances .",
    "once new observables become relevant , such as some lhc end - points , for example , it would be trivial to include them into the likelihood and re - perform the mcmc  @xcite .",
    "the method should be equally applicable to other models , and provided enough cpu power is to hand , could provide likelihood maps for models with even more parameters and/or detailed electroweak fits .",
    "we would like to thank other members of the cambridge susy working group , w de boer , p gondolo , p hfliger , b heinemann , s heinemeyer , g manca , a peel , m rauch and t plehn for helpful conversations .",

    "by definition , a sampler able to sample correctly from a pdf @xmath83 must generate a list of @xmath84 values whose local density , at large step - numbers , is proportional to the probability density @xmath83 at each part of the space ( in the preceding parts of the paper we have set this pdf to be the likelihood ) .",
    "the value of the constant of proportionality between the probability density and the local density of @xmath84 values is unimportant , but the key point is that it is _ constant _ across the whole space",
    ".    it can sometimes be hard to implement a good sampler for a given probability distribution .",
    "in fact it is often easier to invent an algorithm which generates a sequence of @xmath84 values , and which may superficially resemble a sampler , _ but which lacks constancy of proportionality over the space_. we might call such algorithms pseudo - samplers as their output can sometimes resemble that of a true sampler , provided that the variation in proportionality is not too great across the space considered .",
    "pseudo - samplers are sometimes useful ( e.g.  as a means of exploring a multidimensional space in which case sample density may be neither interesting nor the end product of the analysis ) .    in the present and in many other papers , however , sample density represents confidence in some particular part of parameter space , and _ is _ the final product of the analysis .",
    "extreme care , then , must be taken to ensure that any creative modifications to established markov chain sampling techniques do not break the principle of detailed balance ",
    "the test which ensures that the algorithm remains a true sampler rather than a pseudo - sampler .",
    "it is often desirable for metropolis - hastings type samplers to have an efficiency of about 25% for the acceptance of newly proposed points .",
    "efficiencies much smaller than this may suggest that the proposal distribution is too wide and is too often proposing jumps to undesirable locations far away from the present point , leading to large statistical fluctuations in the result .",
    "efficiencies much larger than this can be indicative of proposal distributions which are too narrow and may take too many steps to be practical to random - walk from one side of a region of high probability to the other .",
    "it is tempting , therefore , to adapt the present step size ( i.e.  proposal distribution width ) on the basis of recent efficiency . with a couple of toy examples ,",
    "however , we will illustrate that this is a dangerous path to follow , and we will demonstrate that it break the principle of detailed balance , and thus turns the markov chain algorithm from a sampler into a pseudo - sampler .",
    "take , for example , the 1-dimensional double gaussian probability distribution @xmath85 defined by @xmath86 where @xmath87 is a gaussian distribution of unit height and width @xmath88 centred on @xmath89 .",
    "note that the gaussian near the origin is wider than the gaussian near @xmath90 .",
    "this pdf mocks up the approximate situation along the @xmath2 direction in msugra for large @xmath0 , as fig .",
    "[ fig : like7]a shows .",
    "the narrow gaussian would then correspond to the light @xmath25-pole region , which is quite disconnected from the wider @xmath22-pole region .",
    "a metropolis - hastings algorithm ( see section  [ sec : mcmc ] ) with a fixed gaussian proposal pdf @xmath91 of width 5 was run for 2 000 000 steps and the binned result is shown in figure  [ fig : dgau]a .",
    "it reproduces the target distribution very well .",
    "in contrast , figure  [ fig : dgau]b shows what happens when the adaptive algorithm is run on @xmath85 .",
    "clearly the result is very different to that in figure  [ fig : dgau]a and is thus very wrong .",
    "the narrow gaussian has been sampled many times more frequently than it should have been relative to the wider one near the origin .",
    "the adaptive algorithm ensures that whenever the current point is in one of the two gaussian regions , the step size is adjusted to be proportional to the width of that region .",
    "this adaptation is not immediate ( seven successive rejections must occur before the step size is halved ) but suppose for the moment that adaptation were to take place almost immediately . for the moment ,",
    "let us also neglect random fluctuations of the step size . in such a limit ,",
    "when the current point is in the left - hand gaussian region , the step size is double what it is when the current point is in the right - hand region . making a proposal for a jump from the region on the left to the region on the right , therefore , is something like a @xmath92-sigma event .",
    "in contrast , making the reverse proposal ( from right to left ) is more like a @xmath93-sigma event . in this limit",
    ", it is thus @xmath94 times more likely that jumps to the right get proposed than jumps to the left .",
    "this is a vast overestimate of the bias toward the narrow region for two reasons .",
    "firstly , step size adaptation is not immediate ( even when the step size is half of what it should be , quite a few steps occur before seven successive rejections ) .",
    "secondly and more importantly , even when settled in one of the two regions , the adaptive step size makes excursions about its mean value .",
    "excursions to very high step sizes ( double or quadruple the average step size ) are infrequent but still occur .",
    "when they do , they elevate the chance of proposing a jump from one region to another , and help to equilibrate between the two regions .",
    "both of these effects reduce the bias favouring the narrow region , but still break detailed balance , and overall the right hand gaussian is still sampled about 10 times more frequently than it should be .        for quite a different example , consider the truncated cauchy distribution defined by @xmath95 a faithful sampling from this distribution is shown in figure  [ fig : cauchy](a ) , and a mis - sampling using the adaptive algorithm is shown for comparison in figure  [ fig : cauchy](b ) .",
    "although there is better correspondence between the samples generated by the two methods than was the case earlier , it is nevertheless evident that there are large differences between the degrees to which the two methods have sampled the tails of the distribution . as a consequence ,",
    "samples from the adaptive method have a root - mean - squared value of 7.6 compared to the value of 17.9 obtained by the true sampling .",
    "the cause of the discrepancy is again due to the very different scales in the cauchy distribution .",
    "its core is very narrow with a width of order 1 , but there are significant parts of probability also lodged in the tails many orders of magnitude away .",
    "the adaptive method has to raise and lower the step size frequently to sample from the whole dynamic range , and in doing so it has to break detailed balance many times , resulting in the cumulative effect of an overall order of magnitude bias in the tails .",

    "<S> an upper limit of 2@xmath12 on this branching ratio might be achieved at the tevatron , and would rule out 29@xmath13 of the currently allowed likelihood . if one allows for non thermal - neutralino components of dark matter , this fraction becomes 35@xmath13 . </S>",
    "<S> the mass ordering allows the important cascade decay @xmath14 with a likelihood of 24@xmath15 . </S>",
    "<S> the stop coannihilation region is highly disfavoured , whereas the light higgs region is marginally disfavoured . </S>"
