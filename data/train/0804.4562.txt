    "the study of p+p , d+au , and au+au collisions in the first three years at rhic showed that ( i ) hadrons at high @xmath0 ( @xmath1gev/@xmath2 ) produced in central au+au collisions are strongly suppressed , ( ii ) direct photons in au+au collisions at high @xmath0 are not suppressed , and ( iii ) high-@xmath0 hadrons in d+au are not suppressed @xcite .",
    "the particle production in collisions of two heavy - ion species a+b with respect to p+p collisions was quantified with the nuclear modification factor @xmath3 where the nuclear overlap function @xmath4 is related to the number of independent nucleon - nucleon collisions according to @xmath5 .",
    "these observations provided strong evidence for jet quenching : quarks and gluons lose energy in a medium of high color - charge density created in au+au collisions whereas direct photons leave the medium unscathed and follow the scaling with @xmath6 since they interact only electro - magnetically .",
    "with high-@xmath0 single particle spectra measured after the initial three runs at rhic assumptions and predictions of parton energy loss models can be studied in more detail . in particular , the centrality and @xmath0 dependence of hadron and direct - photon production can be tested at higher @xmath0 . moreover , the new data allow to test the dependence of the hadron suppression on the heavy - ion species ( cu instead of au ) , on the hadron species , and on @xmath7 .",

    "direct - photon yields in central au+au collisions at @xmath8gev , now available up to @xmath19gev/@xmath2 , do not appear to scale with @xmath4 at the highest @xmath0 ( @xmath20 ) .",
    "possible explanations of this observation include the difference between the parton distributions in protons and neutrons ( isospin effect ) , the modification of the parton distributions in nuclei ( emc effect ) , and the suppression of direct photons which result from the fragmentation of partons .",
    "interestingly , a suppression of direct - photon production at @xmath21gev/@xmath2 is not observed in central cu+cu collisions at the same energy ( fig .",

    "[ fig : raa]a shows that not all mesons are suppressed by the same factor .",
    "neutral pions and @xmath10 s exhibit the same suppression which is consistent with a picture in which these particles are produced in the fragmentation of partons outside the hot and dense medium",
    ". the amount of suppression for @xmath12 s at mid - rapidity is similar to that of @xmath9 s and @xmath10 s .",
    "however , @xmath13 and @xmath11 mesons appear to be less suppressed .",
    "this interesting pattern provides an important test for jet quenching models .",
    "the comparison of the @xmath9 suppression in au+au and cu+cu collisions at @xmath7 unveils a simple scaling : the suppression only depends on the number of participating nucleons ( @xmath22 ) for the same @xmath7 as shown in fig .  [",

    "such a scaling with @xmath22 is consistent with a parton energy loss picture @xcite .",
    "fitting the centrality dependence of @xmath14 in central au+au collisions for @xmath23gev/@xmath2 with the function @xmath24 yields @xmath25 , consistent with @xmath26 expected in parton energy loss scenarios @xcite .",
    "the @xmath7 dependence of the @xmath9 suppression provides further constraints for parton energy loss models .",
    "a comparison of the @xmath9 production in central au+au collisions at 62.4 and 200gev shows that for @xmath27gev/@xmath2 the @xmath14 at 62.4gev approaches the @xmath14 at 200gev @xcite .",
    "this suggests that the smaller parton energy loss at 62.4gev is offset by the steeper parton @xmath0 spectrum at this energy . the measurement of @xmath14 in cu+cu at 22.4 , 62.4 , and 200gev ( fig .",
    "[ fig : edep]b ) indicates that parton energy loss starts to dominate over cronin enhancement between 22.4gev and 62.4gev @xcite .",
    "the @xmath9 suppression at 62.4 and 200gev is consistent with a parton energy loss calculation in which the initial gluon density is derived from measured charged particle multiplicities @xcite .",

    "the parton @xmath0 spectra become steeper with decreasing @xmath7 leading to a smaller @xmath14 for the same @xmath28 .",
    "this might explain why a significant @xmath9 suppression ( @xmath29 ) is even observed at @xmath30gev in very central pb+pb collisions @xcite . for a power law spectrum @xmath31 and an approximately constant @xmath14",
    "the fractional parton energy @xmath32 loss can be estimated as @xmath33 where @xmath34 is obtained from a power law fit of the p+p spectrum @xcite at the same energy . at @xmath30 , 62.4 , 130 and 200gev the values 11.4 , 9.2 , 8.2 , 8.2 ,",
