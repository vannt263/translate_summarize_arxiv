    "the steady state diffusion equation is frequently used for interpretation of the cosmic ray phenomena ( see , for example,@xcite ) . without energy losses and nuclear interactions this equation for concentration of the cosmic rays with energy @xmath1 generated by sources distribution with density function",
    "@xmath2 has the form : @xmath3 where @xmath4 is a diffusivity .",
    "the equation ( [ eq1l ] ) describes the cosmic ray propagation under the assumption that nonhomogeneities of medium have small - scale character .",
    "if the medium has a fractal structure , the normal diffusion equation ( [ eq1l ] ) is not a proper one .",
    "a generalization of this equation leads to an anomalous diffusion ( see the reviews by @xcite and paper @xcite ) . in recent papers @xcite the anomalous diffusion equations under the different approximations",
    "were formulated and the solutions for point instantaneous and impulse sources were found .    the main goal of this paper is to find the steady state solution of the fractional diffusion equation and to evaluate the exponent of steady state energy spectrum .",
    "the fractional diffusion equation formulated in @xcite has the form : @xmath5 here @xmath6 is the anomalous diffusivity , @xmath7 , @xmath8 are determined by the fractal structure of the medium and by trapping mechanism , correspondingly .",
    "@xmath9 means fractional derivative of rieman - liouville by time  @xcite : @xmath10 @xmath11 is fractional laplacian ( called `` riss operator '' )  @xcite : @xmath12 where @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 @xmath17    if @xmath18 and @xmath19 , the equation ( [ eq1dd ] ) is the normal diffusion equation . if @xmath20 , @xmath19 , we have from ( [ eq1dd ] ) the superdiffusion equation : @xmath21 discussed in @xcite .",
    "in steady state case the equation ( [ eq2l ] ) takes the form : @xmath22 the green s function @xmath23 satisfies the equation : @xmath24 the solution of the equation ( [ eq3 ] ) can be found by means of fourier transformation : @xmath25 taking into account that the fourier transform of fractional laplacian is @xcite @xmath26 it s easy to find : @xmath27 applying the inverse fourier transformation , we obtain : @xmath28 since @xmath29 is density of three - dimensional spherically - symmetrical stable law , for green s function we have : @xmath30    using green s function ( [ eq12 ] ) we can find the solution of equation ( [ eq2 ] ) for a interesting for astrophysics source .",

    "this choice is due to the fact that @xmath37 has the analytical representation .",

    "the steady state solution is connected with @xmath52 by means of passage to the limit : @xmath53 so , we have @xmath54 @xmath55 thus , the analysis presented above shows that the exponent of the steady state spectrum turns out to be equal to the spectral exponent above the `` knee '' , that is @xmath56 .",
