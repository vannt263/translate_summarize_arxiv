    "this paper considers the motion of rigid bodies in a potential fluid in the presence of certain kind of linear nonholonomic constraints .",
    "this is motivated by studying the dynamics of underwater vehicles with large fins , which , in the first approximation , impose restrictions on the velocity of their central points relative to the fluid .",
    "the free motion of such vehicles in a 3-dimensional potential fluid can be described by the finite - dimensional kirchhoff equations , in which the action of the fluid is reflected via the tensor of adjoint masses that depends solely on the body shape . in the presence of a large fin",
    "this tensor becomes almost singular : one of its eigenvalues is very large . as was shown in @xcite , see also @xcite , section 6.4 , in the limit the dynamics of the body with the fin is described by a _",
    "system with the nonholonomic constraint that prohibits the instantaneous motion in the direction of the first eigenvalue .",
    "it should be noted however , that the vakonomic description of several mechanical systems with nonholonomic constraints gives rise to rather unexpected behavior ( see again @xcite ) .    in our paper",
    "we follow a more direct approach .",
    "namely , we describe the motion of the body with a fin by the kirchhoff equations with a regular tensor of adjoint masses and impose linear constraint(s ) on the velocities , which serve to model the action of the fin .",
    "the reaction forces arising from the constraint are included according to the lagrange - dalembert principle , which is widely accepted to be physically meaningful .    our model for the constraint and the reaction forces",
    "can also be derived following the _ anisotropic friction _",
    "approach for realizing constraints described in @xcite , see also @xcite . in this approach",
    "one considers the unconstrained system under the influence of a viscous frictional term that only acts in the direction perpendicular to the fin and is proportional to a parameter , say @xmath0 .",
    "the equations of motion are then obtained by letting @xmath1 .",
    "the obtained system is in general different from the limit vakonomic system described above .",
    "the idea of modeling the action of the fin on the fluid with a nonholonomic constraint using lagrange - dalembert s principle also appears in @xcite .",
    "although it is regarded as an idealized situation that is physically unattainable , it is the first approximation for their analysis .",
    "the authors use it to study the motion of an underwater projectile with tail fins moving at high speed .",
    "however , due to the high speed of the projectile , cavitation effects appear and the general interaction of the fluid and the body motion is not modeled with kirchhoff s approach .",
    "we thus believe that the systems that we present serve as a first approximation for the motion of an underwater vehicle with a large ( or very effective ) fin that moves in a fluid in the regime where kirchhoff s approach is valid .    in the case of a 2-dimensional body on a plane and 2-dimensional fluid",
    ", another motivation for the constraint appears : the body can interact with the plane via a sharp blade .",
    "this setting gives a hydrodynamic generalization of the famous nonholonomic chaplygin sleigh problem considered in detail in @xcite .",

    "+ + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    in section 2 we review the preliminaries that are necessary for writing down the equations of motion for our family of systems .",
    "we briefly recall kirchhoff s equations for a rigid body moving in a potential flow and the euler - poincar - suslov equations for nonholonomic systems on lie groups with left - invariant lagrangian and constraints . towards the end of the section",
    "the equations of motion for underwater bodies subject to a suslov or chaplygin sleigh type constraint are given .",
    "we then discuss the necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of an invariant measure in a simple case .",
    "the problem of the motion of the chaplygin sleigh moving in a potential flow ( with no circulation ) is treated in detail in section 3 .",
    "the reduced equations are written down explicitly for a general body shape and their qualitative behavior is determined .",
    "it is shown that these equations are hamiltonian with respect to a given bracket but do not preserve a measure with a smooth density in the generic case .",
    "we then continue to show that in the presence of the fluid , the sleigh generically evolves from one asymptotic circular motion to another in the opposite direction , although the limit circles do not coincide .",
    "their radii are given in terms of the components of the total inertia of the fluid - body system .",
    "for the purpose of concreteness , the added inertia tensor is computed explicitly for an elliptical sleigh whose contact point @xmath2 with the plane is located at the center of the ellipse @xmath3 , and where the knife edge is not aligned with its principal axes .",
    "this allows also to calculate the components of this tensor when @xmath2 does not coincide with @xmath3 .",
    "then , in the general case , the asymptotic behavior ( radius and course direction along the limit circle ) is fully determined by the position of the center of mass .    in section 4 the reduced equations of motion for the hydrodynamic chaplygin sleigh",
    "are integrated explicitly for a generic sleigh .",
    "the angular velocity is integrated to give a closed expression for the angle that determines the orientation of the body .",
    "even though the position of the sleigh can not be obtained in a closed form , the distance between the centers of the limit circles is computed explicitly .    finally , in the conclusions we motivate a further study of the hydrodynamic chaplygin sleigh in presence of circulation and/or point vortices .",
    "the motion of a rigid body in a potential fluid in the absence of external forces was first described by kirchhoff in 1890 , who derived the reduced equations for the evolution of the body that do not incorporate the fluid itself .",
    "its presence is instead encoded in an  added inertia \" matrix that depends on the body shape .",
    "kirchhoff s equations can be understood as the output of a two stage reduction procedure . in the first stage one gets rid of the fluid variables by virtue of the  particle relabeling symmetry \" . in the second stage one",
    "eliminates the body configuration variables by homogeneity and isotropy of space . as such , kirchhoff s equations are the lie  poisson equations on the co - algebra @xmath4 where the hamiltonian is the total energy of the fluid - body system .",
    "see @xcite for more details on this reduction .",
    "we briefly recall kirchhoff s equations in order to introduce the notation needed for the rest of the paper . for a derivation of these equations obtained by balancing the momentum of the body with the forces and torques exerted by the fluid see lamb s classic book on hydrodynamics , @xcite , which presents a thorough discussion of the problem and remains to date a key reference in the subject .",
    "we adopt euler s approach to the study of the rigid body dynamics and consider an orthonormal body frame that is attached to the body .",
    "this frame is related to a fixed space frame via an attitude ( or rotation ) matrix @xmath5 .",
    "let @xmath6 , @xmath7 be the linear velocity of the origin of the body and its angular velocity , both vectors are written with respect to the body frame .",

    "the @xmath25 matrix @xmath22 is the usual inertia tensor of the body with respect to the chosen frame .",
    "if the origin of the body frame is at the center of mass , then @xmath26 . for convenience",
    "we introduce the @xmath27 symmetric matrix @xmath28 ( @xmath29 denoting the @xmath25 identity matrix ) that defines @xmath30 as a quadratic form on @xmath15 .",
    "next , the total energy of the fluid is given by @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the ( constant ) fluid density , @xmath33 is the eulerian velocity of the fluid , and the integration takes place over the region occupied by the fluid .",
    "we assume that the fluid motion takes place in the boundless region of @xmath19 that is not occupied by the body .",
    "we also assume that the flow is potential , with zero circulation , and is solely due to the motion of the body . under these hypothesis",
    "it is possible express @xmath34 as the quadratic form ( see @xcite ) : @xmath35 where @xmath36 and @xmath37 , @xmath24 , are certain constants that only depend on the body shape .",
    "they are referred to as _ added masses _ and are conveniently written in @xmath27 matrix form to define the _ added inertia tensor _ : @xmath38 where @xmath39 , and @xmath40 are the corresponding @xmath25 matrices .",
    "one can show that the matrix @xmath41 is symmetric .    in the absence of potential forces ,",
    "the total energy of the fluid - body system is @xmath42 and defines the kinetic energy lagrangian @xmath43 .",
    "the motion of the body in space is determined by the geodesic motion with respect to the riemannian metric defined by @xmath44 .    in view of ( [ e : body_energy_in_terms_of_velocities ] ) and ( [ e : fluid_energy_in_terms_of_velocities ] ) , we can write the lagrangian @xmath45 in terms of the linear and angular velocities of the body ( written in the body frame ) and this expression does not depend on the particular position and orientation of the body , i.e. is independent of @xmath46 .",

    "as a consequence , the equations ( [ e : kirchhoff_1_3d ] ) decouple , and we recover the well known fact about the motion of the body in vacuum : the center of mass moves at constant velocity , whereas the body rotates freely according to the euler equations .",
    "it is also well known that in the presence of the fluid this is no longer true , that is , the fluid couples the translational and rotational modes of the motion .    given a solution of ( [ e : kirchhoff_1_3d ] ) , the motion of the body in space is describing by solving the reconstruction equations ( [ e : reconstruction_equations ] ) .    in the absence of circulation ,",
