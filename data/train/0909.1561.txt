    "ultracold atomic fermi gases present a unique opportunity to study the exotic pairing phases where the effective interaction is tunable via feshbach resonance and population of each spin component can be controlled .",
    "these studies with two - component fermi gas include the bardeen - cooper - schrieffer ( bcs ) to bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) crossover  @xcite with equal population two - component fermi gas and the effects of population imbalance on the superfluid state  @xcite . for fermi gas with population imbalance ,",
    "various pairing scenarios are proposed : fulde - ferrel - larkin - ovchinnikov phase fflo  @xcite , breached pairing  @xcite , phase separation  @xcite and pairing with deformed fermi surface  @xcite .",
    "the present studies of equal mass superfluid fermi systems involve same trapping potentials for the two component .",
    "the zero  @xcite and finite temperature  @xcite phase diagrams of the equal mass population imbalanced system taking into account various pairing phases with implications to experiments are well understood .",
    "the trap imbalanced is naturally realized with fermi mixture with unequal masses where each component experiences different potential due to the mass difference .",
    "the ground state properties for this system have been studied in ref .",
    "however , it was recently proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite that even equal mass fermi mixture can admit trap imbalance and the system was studied with population balance  @xcite and small trap imbalance  @xcite .",
    "motivated by recent experiment performed in the bec regime of interaction exploring bose - fermi mixture  @xcite , we consider the trap and population imbalanced @xmath0 fermi mixture in this regime .",
    "the phase diagram in this regime becomes richer with the existence of the gapless ( polarized ) superfluid also referred to as breached pair phase with one fermi surface .",
    "we study the effects of trap asymmetry on the shell structure as function of polarization .",
    "the shell structure , in general , consists of three phases : unpolarized superfluid ( bcs sf ) at the center , the breached pair phase with one fermi surface ( bp1 ) forms the intermediate shell finally surrounded by polarized normal ( n ) .",
    "we do not consider the fflo phase  @xcite where cooper pair carries finite center - of - mass momentum .",
    "this phase is stable within very narrow window of the applied chemical potential difference in the bcs regime .",
    "the system we consider is a trapped cloud of two - component fermionic mixture confined by harmonic isotropic potential @xmath2 where @xmath3 measures the distance from the trap center .",
    "the fermi atoms have unequal population of the two pseudo - spin ( hyperfine ) states and interact via point - contact @xmath4-wave interaction .",
    "to proceed further we start with system without the trap and later include it under local density approximation . the hamiltonian density ( @xmath5 ) for the fermions in this case",
    "is given by @xmath6 where @xmath7 creates a pseudospin-@xmath8 fermion at position @xmath9 @xmath10 @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the chemical potential and mass for pseudospin-@xmath8 component with @xmath13 .",
    "@xmath14 is the bare coupling constant characterizing interparticle interaction .",
    "it is related to @xmath4-wave scattering length @xmath15 of the system by the lippmann - schwinger equation @xmath16 where the average kinetic energy @xmath17 @xmath18 is volume and reduced mass @xmath19 the pairing hamiltonian can be diagonalized by bogoliubov transformations using thermofield dynamics techniques as described in @xcite .",
    "this formalism also accounts for the polarized superfluidity when two components have unequal population or masses .",

    "the excess fermions are accommodated in negative quasiparticle energy states .",
    "this gapless phase is referred to as breached pair phase with one fermi surface ( bp1 ) as it is stable only for @xmath31 and hence possesses one fermi surface . in the deep bec regime",
    "this phase can be understood as mixture of composite bosons and fermion quasiparticles  @xcite .",
    "the gap equation is given by the condition of extremum of thermodynamic potential density @xmath32 .",
    "the average number density and density difference equation respectively are given by @xmath33 and @xmath34 before considering the trapped system , we construct the zero temperature phase diagram in grand canonical ensemble  @xcite of fixed @xmath35 and @xmath36    we start with @xmath37 and find the point where superfluid state make continuous transition to vacuum state of molecules . this value of @xmath35 is denoted by @xmath38 for small @xmath39 this behavior i.e. superfluid - to - vacuum persists and leads to vertical phase boundary in the diagram .    next , we start with @xmath40 and increasing @xmath36 here system evolve from vacuum state to polarized normal state as @xmath41 is now positive quantity leading to finite population of the @xmath30-fermions .",
    "there can not be superfluid phase here as @xmath42 this leads to vaccum - to - polarized n phase boundary .",
    "similarly we start with @xmath43 with increasing @xmath36 here system makes continuous transition to breached pair state as superfluid starts to admit finite polarization .",
    "the superfluid - to bp1 boundray is calculated by numerical comparison of the thermodynamic potential in the respective states .",
    "as we further increase the @xmath44 , the bp1 eventually make transition to polarized normal state .",
    "however , depending on the value of @xmath35 the bp1-to - polarized transition can be first or second order .",
    "the tricritical point where first and second order transition meet is indicated in the phase diagram . also the bp1-normal first order curve intersect the superfluid - bp1 curve at large @xmath45 beyond this intersection point , bp1 ceases to exist and there is direct first order superfluid - to - normal transition .",
    "we next consider the trapped fermions confined by harmonic isotropic potential .",
    "this can be taken into account via local density approximation ( lda ) where trapped system is treated as locally uniform with local chemical potential @xmath46 @xmath11 is actual lagrange multiplier constraining number of atoms and @xmath47 with @xmath48 as trapping frequency for component @xmath49 furthermore , the chemical potentials of each component at a given point in the trap can be written as @xmath50 where @xmath51 and @xmath52 where @xmath53 and @xmath54 the quantities @xmath35 and @xmath44 are determined by enforcing particle number constraints namely total number of atoms and population difference respectively .    in terms of @xmath55 and @xmath56 ,",

    "we also note that in the deep bec regime @xmath66  @xcite , the molecular binding energy with @xmath67 .",
    "thus we impose the condition  @xcite , @xmath68 this gives , @xmath69    the zero subscript indicates that the quantities are for zero polarization . to investigate the system",
    "numerically we define the dimensionless quantities @xmath70 @xmath71",
    "@xmath72 where we choose @xmath73 with @xmath74 we , also , normalize the distance in the trap @xmath75 and define @xmath76 by the relation @xmath77 hence @xmath78 where we have expressed the binding energy @xmath79 in @xmath80 units as @xmath81 however for the system with population imbalance we have    @xmath82    where dimensionless quantity @xmath83 controls the trap asymmetry of the fermi gas .",
    "now the equation for total number of atoms and population difference in dimensionless form are given by @xmath84    the system for a given coupling strength and polarization @xmath85 is investigated numerically in the following manner : first @xmath86 is calculated by setting @xmath87 then using eq .",
    "[ eq : hmu ] together with number and population imbalance equation , @xmath35 and @xmath44 are calculated . in the bec limit",
    "the order parameter @xmath88 and density for composite bosons or molecular density are related  @xcite . by calculating the local composite boson density @xmath89 and magnetization @xmath90 ,",
    "the various phases are identified .",
    "we choose experimentally accessible @xmath91 for the interaction strength .",
    "the phase at each spatial point of the trap is determined by the local chemical potentials @xmath65 and @xmath92 ( see eqs .",
    "[ eq : hmu ] ) mapping it to the corresponding point in the phase diagram . as radius",
    "is increased @xmath93 moves towards left in the phase diagram forming a line segment .",
    "we find three different phases in the cloud . at the center ,",
    "superfluid core where the population of the two components are equal i.e. unpolarized superfluid ( bcs sf ) , then an intermediate polarized superfluid ( bp1 ) shell where fermion quasiparticles and and composite bosons coexist and finally outer rim of majority component .",
    "this leads to three radii characterizing the shell structure : @xmath94 where @xmath95 and @xmath96 forming boundary for bcs sf phase , @xmath97 above which @xmath98 and @xmath99 above which @xmath100    the three radii for the system without trap asymmetry @xmath101 as a function of polarization @xmath102 together with density profiles showing @xmath103 and @xmath104 are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:0all ] .",
    "the shell structure consist of bcs sf phase for @xmath105 , bp1 phase for @xmath106 and finally polarized normal ( n ) state for @xmath107 we next consider the system with trap asymmetry characterized by the dimensionless parameter @xmath108 the positive ( negative ) @xmath109 value indicates that majority ( minority ) component is more tightly confined harmonically than the minority ( majority ) component .",
    "the three radii with different trap asymmetry parameter @xmath109 as functions of polarization @xmath102 are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : radii ] .",
    "the value @xmath110 corresponds to the situation when one of the component is very strongly confined .",
    "we start with @xmath111 corresponding to @xmath112 the bp1 shell here is very narrow and overall size of the cloud ( characterized by @xmath99 ) is much larger than the superfluid cloud without population imbalance ( the cloud size is measured in units of @xmath113 ) .",
    "as we increase @xmath109 , the bp1 shell grows in size , however , size of the cloud decreases .",
    "the window of polarization for which bp1 phase forms the superfluid core starting at the center of the trap increases becoming maximum at @xmath114 .",
    "the bp1 phase forms the core beginning at @xmath115 which should be experimentally feasible .",
    "we also present the density profiles for same set of @xmath109 at @xmath116 in fig .",
    "[ all_density ] .",
    "we note that as @xmath109 increases , size of @xmath117 representing density of the composite bosons shrinks but becomes more dense .",
    "it also exhibits the large cloud sizes for tightly confined minority as noted above .",
    "all these features can be explained by analyzing ( @xmath118 ) variations for each value of @xmath109 in the phase diagram . to this end , we replot the phase diagram enlarging the bp1 state .",
    "the line segments representing above mentioned variations are also shown ( fig .",
    "[ inset ] ) .",
    "we note that @xmath109 with positive ( negative ) value has a positive ( negative ) slopes with zero value for @xmath119    note further that bp1 to polarized n transition is second and first order for positive and negative set of chosen values respectively .",
    "these transitions can be detected via density profiles in the experiments .",
    "the @xmath111 line segment traverses small region of bp1 phase making second order transition to polarized n while @xmath114 segment traverses larger region in bp-1 phase before making first order transition to polarized n. the order of transition can be detected in experiments via spatial discontinuities which vanish for second order transition .",
    "as @xmath109 is increased from @xmath111 line segment increasingly have larger portion in bp-1 region .",
    "this explains why the bp1 shell expands in size as @xmath109 is increased .",
    "note futher that owing to their negative ( positive ) slopes , @xmath109 with negative values have longer ( shorter ) excursion into the polarized n state before encountering the vacuum explaining the larger ( smaller ) size for their clouds .",
    "since all the atoms are integrated across the trap to conserve the atoms , the corresponding atom density distributions are also affected accounting for increased ( reduced ) number of atoms in bp1 phase for @xmath120 ( @xmath121 ) .",
    "in conclusion , we have studied in this paper the asymmetrically trapped and population imbalanced two - components fermi gas in the strongly attracting bec limit at @xmath122 . using the local density approximation ( lda ) , we calculated the the shell radii of various phases in the trap as a function of polarization and trap asymmetry .",
    "compared to symmetric trap case @xmath123 , we find that when the majority component is tightly confined the gapless superfluid shell ( bp1 ) increases in size .",
    "the polarization threshold to form the polarized bp1 superfluid at the core is reduced for a given interaction strength in this case . however , when minority are tightly confined unpolarized superfluid is favored with bp1 phase forming a narrow shell .",
    "we explained these features using the phase diagram .",
