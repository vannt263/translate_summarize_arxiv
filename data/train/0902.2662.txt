    "spin - related phenomena have recently attracted much attention , as they are the key ingredient in the new field known as spintronics @xcite . two - dimensional ( 2d ) semiconductors are appropriate materials to be used in spintronics applications since they offer the possibility of an electric control of spins via tunable spin - orbit ( so ) interaction .",
    "an important contribution to so effects in 2d electronic states of narrow gap semiconductors ( e.g , inas ) is the rashba interaction @xcite .",
    "this interaction is a generalization of the vacuum so interaction from the pauli equation , @xmath0 , which is small for non - relativistic momenta @xmath1 , @xmath2 being the scalar potential . in semiconductors ,",
    "the energy gap @xmath3 and the band splitting @xmath4 are comparable in magnitude ( @xmath5 ) and , as a consequence , the so coupling is enhanced by a factor @xmath6 .",
    "the rashba interaction is a type of so interaction arising when a 2d electron gas forms at the interface of a heterostructure .",

    "we take the confinement direction along z. in eq .",
    "( [ eq_ham ] ) , @xmath9 is the 2d momentum and @xmath10 are the pauli matrices .",
    "we note that available experimental data @xcite on few - electron quantum dots have been discussed in terms of rashba spin - orbit coupling and exchange interaction @xcite . using the spin density functional theory it was showed @xcite that the competition of this coupling and the exchange interaction gives rise to the suppression of the hund rule , and a dot with a closed configuration presents a paramagnetic behavior .",
    "we have to mention that these result have been obtained in the absence of the coulomb interaction .    when the rashba interaction is localized around a finite region of a quasi one - dimensional ballistic wire [ see fig .",
    "[ fig_system](a ) ] , ref . predicts the formation of quasi - bound states which are coupled to the nonresonant background channel .",
    "both the potential well and the intersubband coupling is produced by the rashba interaction alone .",
    "furthermore , the quasi - bound states lead to enhanced backscattering , causing strong dips in the conductance curves of the wire as a function of the fermi energy.@xcite since both the level position and broadening can be tuned with the rashba strength @xmath8 , these states are termed _ rashba dots _",
    "@xcite .",
    "recently , lpez _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite have formulated a microscopic theory for transport across rashba dots including coulomb interactions in the dot .",
    "an important aspect of this model is that different regimes can be achieved by tuning the parameters of the rashba hamiltonian and this can be done modulating external electric fields applied to nearby gates .",
    "the difference between the anderson hamiltonian @xcite and the hamiltonian proposed in ref .",
    "is twofold .",
    "first , in the anderson hamiltonian the spin is conserved at low temperatures , leading to the kondo effect , but in ref .",
    "the rashba dot hamiltonian contains a spin - flip interaction because the localized states couple to the continuum states with opposite spins .",
    "second , due to the rashba induced precession term , the direct transmission channel presents a phase term similar to the aharonov - bohm case , but the phase is now spin - dependent @xcite .",
    "remarkably , despite these differences the system shows a persisting kondo effect at low temperatures but with a novel gate dependence @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we address the magnetic properties of rashba dots .",
    "we follow anderson s model for magnetic impurities in a metallic host and determine whether it is energetically favorable for the dot to form a localized magnetic moment .",
    "we show below that the coulomb interaction can develop magnetic moments in a rashba dot for a critical value of the ratio @xmath11 , which depends of the parameters of the rashba interaction .",
    "our results might also be important for quantum dots doped with magnetic impurities @xcite .",
    "magnetic ordering in dots can be induced by the coulomb interaction and the magnetization can be electrically controlled even for a fixed number of electrons @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "we present in section ii the model and calculate the green function using the equation of motion method .",
    "the magnetic moment is determined in section iii both for the equilibrium and the nonequilibrium cases .",
    "the main results are compared with exact numerical calculations in sec .",
    "the results are discussed in section v , which also contains our conclusions .",
    "we start with the model hamiltonian : @xmath12 where @xmath13    in this hamiltonian we consider the spin quantization axis along the rashba field ( the @xmath14 direction for transport along @xmath15 ) , @xmath16 is the occupation number for electrons in the rashba dot with spin @xmath17 and @xmath18 is the creation operator of continuum electrons with wave vector @xmath19 and spin @xmath20 in the lead @xmath21 .",
    "the nonresonant channel is described with the term @xmath22 where the propagation phase acquired by a transmitted electron is spin - dependent ( @xmath23 if @xmath24 ) .",
    "finally , localized and extended electronic states are coupled via the interaction @xmath25 . a pictorial representation of @xmath26 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_system](b ) .",
    "the parameters of this hamiltonian are @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the length of the rashba induced square - well potential ( we assume , for simplicity , that @xmath31 is constant if @xmath32 and zero otherwise ) @xcite , and @xmath33 with @xmath34 .",
    "importantly , these parameters can be externally controlled with gates by changing @xmath8 and @xmath30 .",
    "the form of @xmath26 is similar to the hamiltonian describing the transport in a device formed by an aharonov - bohm interferometer with a quantum dot in one of its arms @xcite but they differ in that the phases in the interaction term @xmath35 depend on the spin direction , and that each hopping process through the dot is associated with a spin - flip event . in the conventional anderson model , spin",
    "is conserved , and this leads to kondo correlations .    in order to study the occurrence of magnetic moments in this model",

    "we note that the tunneling broadening @xmath4 becomes renormalized into @xmath49 due to the background channel when @xmath50 .",
    "furthermore , the spin contribution due to the rashba interaction is proportional to @xmath51 for the both spin orientations .",
    "the magnetization along the rashba field direction is given by the difference between the occupancy expectation value for spin up and spin down , @xmath52 at zero temperature , the occupation reads , @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the local density of states at the rashba dot , defined in terms of the green function as @xmath55 .",
    "consider first the simple case @xmath56 .",
    "then , @xmath57 where @xmath58 is given by @xmath59 since @xmath56 , the energy @xmath58 is spin independent . inserting eq .",
    "( [ eqrhod_uzero ] ) in eq .",
    "( [ eqnd ] ) , we obtain @xmath60 because @xmath61 even in the presence of spin - orbit interaction , we trivially have @xmath62 .",
    "as expected , equilibrium magnetic states arise due to the presence of coulomb interactions only .",
    "consider now the interacting case @xmath63 .",
    "we calculate the density of states using the spin dependence introduced by @xmath64 and we get : @xmath65 where @xmath66 the occupation reads ,",
    "@xmath67    we analyze the formation of a magnetic state from the condition @xmath68 as a consequence , the condition for the magnetic state that @xmath69 becomes @xmath70 this relation is similar to the stoner condition for the occurrence of the magnetic state in the itinerant - electron systems , and the correlations effects appear only as an energy shift . a more accurate discussion , taking the energy dependence of @xmath4 ( via the density of states @xmath47 ) changes the magnetic region , which is known for a constant density of states .",
    "however , for our qualitative discussion we follow the wide - band approximation with a constant @xmath4 .    from eqs .",
    "( [ eq_magn ] ) and  ( [ eq_ndsigma ] ) we find a pair of self - consistent equations for the magnetization @xmath71 and the total electron density @xmath72 :    @xmath73    from these two equations we calculate the size of the interaction above which a local moment develops . on the critical boundary describing the transition into the magnetic state , we approximately have @xmath74 and @xmath75 .",
    "thus , we find @xmath76 where @xmath77 .",
    "this condition provides a number of interesting predictions .",
    "first , for increasing @xmath15 the function @xmath78 decreases .",
    "thus , the formation of magnetic moments is enhanced by the coupling to the continuum states , which is governed by the intensity of the rashba interaction . despite the fact that spin - orbit interactions are time - reversal symmetric and do not induce spontaneous magnetizations ,",
    "indirectly the rashba coupling makes it more favorable to generate magnetic solutions as compared to the case without rashba interaction .",
    "if @xmath79 ( or , equivalently , @xmath80 ) we recover the condition for the occurrence of the anderson moments @xcite .",
    "second , @xmath78 is a weakly function of the phase @xmath81 since in eq .",
    "( [ eq_crit ] ) the dependence on @xmath81 is only implicit through the total density @xmath82 .",
    "nevertheless , in the general case the condition given by eq .",
    "( [ eq_crit ] ) is far from being trivial since we recall that @xmath83 , @xmath4 and @xmath82 are complicated functions of the rashba strength and the dot size @xcite .",
    "we now turn to the nonequilibrium case , where a finite dc bias @xmath84 is applied between the two electrodes .",
    "the formation of magnetic moments within the anderson hamiltonian out of equilibrium has been recently analyzed by komnik and gogolin , see ref . .",
    "they find that the magnetic phase is stable at arbitrarily large voltages in the case of asymmetric couplings . here",
    ", we assume symmetric couplings ( @xmath85 ) and show below that even in this case the combination of rashba interaction and finite bias leads to magnetic moment formation .    at nonequilibrium ,",
    "the spin - dependent occupations are given by the keldysh ( lesser ) green function @xmath86 , @xmath87 where @xmath88 is the fourier transformed lesser green function .",
    "we find @xmath89 where @xmath90 $ ] is the fermi distribution function at the lead @xmath91 with inverse temperature @xmath92 .",
    "interestingly enough , the occupation depends on a term proportional to @xmath93 which has a different sign for opposite spins .",
    "this term appears only at nonequilibrium ( @xmath94 ) .",
    "therefore , we expect a spin polarization ( @xmath95 ) for a noninteracting rashba dot ( @xmath56 ) induced by the interplay effect of external bias and rashba interaction.@xcite    we take @xmath96 and @xmath97 for the electrochemical potentials in the left and right contacts . as a result , we obtain a closed expression for the magnetization , @xmath98 \\end{split}\\ ] ] where @xmath99 is the background channel transmission .",
    "we infer that the magnetization is negative for positive @xmath84 , arising from the orientation of the effective rashba field , which points along @xmath100 @xcite .",
    "the magnetization can be reversed if @xmath81 changes sign ( equivalently , the rashba intensity @xmath8 ) . obviously , the periodic dependence in eq .",
    "( [ eq_mnoneq ] ) arises from the model but it is reasonable to assume a small @xmath8 .",
    "therefore , @xmath81 should not be very large .",
    "the periodic dependence on @xmath81 is obtained in analogy with the aharonov - bohm effect and can be found in related spin - orbit systems ( see , e.g. , ref . ) .",
    "for @xmath101 the minimum magnetization reads , @xmath102 which approaches @xmath103 in the limits of @xmath104 and @xmath105 . on the other hand , for gate voltages much larger than the applied bias",
    "the magnetization approaches zero as @xmath106 finally , we note that the magnetization becomes finite and independent of the gate voltage in the limit of infinite @xmath84 , in which case we find the simple expression @xmath107 .    in the interacting case , one must replace @xmath108 with @xmath109 in eq .",

    "in fact , the dip position shifts away from the symmetric point due to the rashba induced level renormalization .",
    "the most important consequence is that whereas @xmath71 vanishes for @xmath110 at large bias in the case without spin - orbit interactions @xcite , the magnetization remains finite in the rashba case .",

    "i.e. , for negative @xmath125 , strong correlations start to dominate and the interacting magnetization , although still finite , departs significantly from the noninteracting case .",

    "we have demonstrated that the value of the local magnetization @xmath71 at equilibrium depends on @xmath15 , but it is worth noting that the curve @xmath136 is not very sensitive to the change of the parameter @xmath81 .",
    "this result has been also shown in numerical simulations of the mean - field equations .",
    "as in the standard anderson calculation,@xcite our mean - field approach breaks the local symmetry but in an exact solution accounting also for the effect of the spin fluctuations we should recover the spin rotational invariance . nevertheless , even if the magnetic states found above are an artefact of the model , the mean field solution is interesting as such since it gives an indication of the region of the coupling constants of the hamiltonian where the fluctuations give a relevant effect .",
    "recently , magnetic moment formation was proposed as a mechanism to explain the temperature dependence of the conductance for different gate voltages in quantum point contacts,@xcite where the scaling behavior of the conductance close to pinch - off as a function of temperature was used as an argument for the kondo effect occurrence .",

    "<S> we study the formation of local moments in quantum dots arising in quasi - one dimensional electron wires due to localized spin - orbit ( rashba ) interaction . using an anderson - like model to describe the occurrence of the magnetic moments in these rashba dots , </S>",
    "<S> we calculate the local magnetization within the mean - field approximation . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the magnetization becomes a nontrivial function of the rashba coupling strength . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss both the equilibrium and nonequilibrium cases . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , we obtain a magnetic phase which is stable at large bias due to the rashba interaction . </S>"
