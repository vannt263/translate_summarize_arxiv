    "as far back as the 1930s it was shown that the evolution of a dust sphere according to the equations of the general theory of relativity leads to the formation of a black hole  @xcite . in the framework of the relativistic theory of gravitation  @xcite",
    "the non - zero graviton mass changes the situation drastically .",
    "although in newtonian and post - newtonian range the mass of the graviton does nt have much effect on properties of the static solution , in the case of strong fields its impact is highly significant .",
    "a general analysis of this impact on the static spherically symmetric solution has been made in  @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that these solutions bear no resemblance to black holes .",
    "an analysis of the dynamics of spherically symmetric distribution of cold dust has been performed in  @xcite where it has been shown that , instead of collapsing into a black hole , a dust sphere starts to pulsate in the course of evolution .    in this paper",
    "we will perform numerical analysis of the dynamics of collapse for several specific initial configurations .",
    "firstly , this will allow us to obtain more detailed description of the evolution of the system considered .",
    "secondly , we will be able to verify an intuitively obvious assumption that substitution of the cold dust model by a more realistic one with non - zero pressure will not lead to any qualitative changes .",
    "the presence of non - zero pressure will only slow down  ( or even stop ) the process of collapse .",
    "thirdly , we will examine the gravitational collapse in the massless limit of the rtg and compare these results with those obtained in the general relativity . and finally , on the basis of obtained numerical results we will derive rigorous analytical results concerning the time of reaching the turning point in massive rtg .",
    "the paper is structured as follows . in section 1",
    "we investigate static spherically symmetric solutions that further will be used as initial configurations for the process of collapse .",
    "we study cases of massive and massless rtg and specify the influence of the graviton mass on the properties of the static solution . in section 2",
    "we consider the process of collapse in massless rtg . in section 3",
    "we consider the process of collapse in massive rtg and determine how the turning point time depends on the mass of the graviton .",
    "lets us consider static configurations that corresponds to a given equation of state for the matter and various values of graviton mass ( including the case of massless graviton ) .",
    "we assume that the matter equation of state takes the form : @xmath3 we perform calculations for various values of constants @xmath4 and @xmath5 . for our purposes",
    "it is convenient to parameterize the metric coefficients in the following way : @xmath6 @xmath7 such a parameterization permits us to simplify calculations , because equations @xmath8 will be satisfied automatically .",
    "the system of equations for @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 takes the form ( for short , we omit the argument @xmath12 in these functions ) : @xmath13 @xmath14/\\big(2 k l r\\big),\\ ] ] @xmath15 @xmath16 @xmath17 @xmath18 @xmath19/\\big(2 k^4 k ' l r\\big),\\ ] ] @xmath20 @xmath21 @xmath22/\\big(4 k^3 k ' l r\\big).\\ ] ] for the case of massless rtg one should set the graviton mass @xmath23 equal to zero .",
    "we solve this system of equations with boundary conditions @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 .",
    "of course , in numerical calculations the infinity ( @xmath29 ) will be replaced by sufficiently large @xmath12 , and exact boundary conditions should be replaced by expansions into series in powers of @xmath30 and exponential factors @xmath31 .     for the graviton mass @xmath23 ; dashed line  metric coefficient @xmath32 for the graviton mass @xmath33 . ]    for the case of massless rtg it should be noted , that in the region where density is approximately equal to null , the solution does nt coincide with the simplest static solution of the massless rtg in vacuum @xmath34 the latter , in turn , corresponds to the simplest solution for harmonic radial coordinate ( see @xcite ) : @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the standard radial coordinate for schwarzschild solution @xmath37 this fact has already been mentioned in @xcite,@xcite .",
    "it was proved in @xcite,@xcite , that for the case of harmonic coordinates internal and external solutions are consistent only for the general solution for harmonic radial coordinate , that includes also the second ( logarithmic ) solution : @xmath38 our numerical solution shows that at large distances @xmath39 behaves in such a way that the coefficient of @xmath40 is not equal to @xmath41 , and this means that the coefficient of the second  ( logarithmic ) solution @xmath42 is not equal to 0 .",
    "in fact , it is an obvious result  the solution at @xmath43 is determined by three arbitrary constants  ( @xmath44 ) , so that at @xmath29 we need two arbitrary constants  the coefficient of @xmath30 , that is related to the mass of the solution , and the coefficient of @xmath40 , that is related to the coefficient of the logarithmic term @xmath42 .",
    "the main problem for the massive rtg is that we have to perform our numerical simulation at totally unrealistic values of the graviton mass .",
    "the known upper limit on the graviton mass is  @xmath45 ( so that @xmath46 ) .",
    "consequently , the mass of the solution should differ from the graviton mass by at least 100 orders of magnitude .",
    "this leads to the following technical difficulty : in order to study the influence of the graviton mass on the solution we need to use an accuracy of at least 160 digits , which makes the calculations extremely slow .",
    "for this reason we choose a model in which the graviton mass is only a few orders of magnitude less than the mass of the solution .",
    "the main conclusion concerning the role of the non - zero graviton mass on the static solution for the given equation of state for the matter ( besides the obvious exponential behavior of metric coefficient at large distances @xcite ) is that the increasing of graviton mass leads to some increasing of  @xmath47  the larger is @xmath23 , the closer to 1 is the value of @xmath47 ( see fig .",
    "generally , the initial static configurations for both massive and massless cases appears to be the smooth matter distributions .",
    "formally in such a distribution there is no `` body boundary '' and `` external '' and `` internal '' solutions , but it always possible to specify the sphere , that includes almost all matter of the solution . in fig .",
    "this sphere approximately corresponds to the region of rapid increasing of metric coefficient @xmath48 .",
    "the initial condition for the collapse dynamic is the static solution , obtained in the previous section .",
    "so we assume @xmath49 , @xmath50 , etc .",
    "we start the evolution of the system by modifying the equation of state  ( [ mater ] ) by decreasing the coefficient @xmath4  ( this is in some sense a simulation of nuclear fuel burnup ) . for our purposes",
    "it is convenient to change  @xmath4 smoothly : @xmath51 here @xmath52  some constant , @xmath53  the initial value , that corresponds to initial static configuration , @xmath54  the final value of the coefficient ( in the case of cold dust @xmath55 ) .",
    "the dynamics of the system is determined by the dynamics of the metric and the dynamics of matter . due to our parameterization",
    "( see the previous section ) the problem of the metric dynamics is reduced to solving the equation for  @xmath56 , since the equation @xmath57 yields : @xmath58 i.e. @xmath59 has no time dependence . as for  @xmath56 , using the rtg equations  @xcite , namely the equation for  @xmath60 , we obtain ( for short , we omit the arguments @xmath61 and @xmath12 of all functions and use the dot notation for the time derivative and the prime notation for the derivative on the radius @xmath12 ) : @xmath62 @xmath63 @xmath64 @xmath65 @xmath66 @xmath67/\\big(4 k l^5 r ( k l'-2 k ' l)\\big)\\ ] ] ( here the graviton mass  @xmath23 should be set equal to 0 , the density of matter is denoted by @xmath68 , the first component of its velocity @xmath69  by @xmath70 ) .",
    "the dynamics of matter can be obtained from the conservation law for the energy - momentum tensor  @xmath71 . two nontrivial equations ( for @xmath72 and @xmath73 ) take the form @xmath74 ( expressions for @xmath75 are too cumbersome to give them here in explicit form ) . from these equations",
    "one can obtain @xmath76 and @xmath77 .",
    "the initial conditions for @xmath68 corresponds to the static solution @xmath78 , @xmath79 .     at sufficiently large times ( @xmath80 ) .",
    "]    the results of the numerical calculations confirm our presumptions : the collapse of cold dust  ( @xmath55 ) proceeds somewhat faster than the collapse of the matter with residual pressure proportional to  @xmath54  ( of course , @xmath54 should be small enough , otherwise the collapse will not be possible for the the given mass of the solution ) . on fig .  2",
    "one can see the typical evolution of the metric coefficient  @xmath81 at sufficiently large times .",
    "as we already mentioned , there is no `` boundary of body '' ( the matter is distributed continuously ) , but the boundary of the region in which most of the matter is concentrated coincides approximately with the region of rapid growth of @xmath82 ( see fig .",
    "2 . ) . let us note that according to birkhoff s theorem  ( and its analogue in the rtg  @xcite ) the metric coefficients do nt evolve in the region where the density of matter is sufficiently small  ( i. e. , in approximate vacuum ) .",
    "it should be mentioned , that the velocity of the `` boundary '' decreases in the course of time , while the decrease of  @xmath83 does nt become slower .",
    "these two facts completely describe the subsequent evolution of the solution  the boundary stops , while @xmath83 continues to decrease .",
    "this picture of collapse is in full agreement with the well - known oppenheimer - snyder solution @xcite , @xcite described from the point of view of the distant observer .",
    "let us recall that for static solutions in massive rtg we should confine ourselves with the graviton mass values that are only a few orders of magnitude less than the mass of the solution . for the dynamics in massive rtg we meet the same problem : as it will be shown , the effect of the non - zero graviton mass on the dynamics of the collapse becomes significant only after a time proportional to  @xmath84 , i. e.  @xmath85 , and it is impossible to perform calculations on such a time scale .",
    "so we should confine ourselves only with the graviton mass values that are a 3 - 5 orders of magnitude less than the mass of the solution .",
    "the initial conditions correspond to the static solution of massive rtg ( see sec . 1 . ) .",
    "start of evolution ( [ zapu ] ) and dynamical equations ( [ dynk ] ) are precisely the same as in previous section , but the graviton mass @xmath23 now is nt equal to zero .     before and after the turning point @xmath86 . ]",
    "the comparison of the results of numerical simulations for the massive and massless cases leads us to the conclusion that at early stages the non - zero graviton mass have no influence on the collapse dynamics . only at sufficiently large times ,",
    "when the metric coefficient @xmath83 appears to be sufficiently small , the graviton mass changes the system dynamics drastically .",
    "the value @xmath83 reaches a turning point and starts to increase .",
    "the smaller is @xmath23 , the greater is the time of the turning point , when contraction is replaced by the expansion .",
    "the subsequent evolution shows oscillations of  @xmath83 ( see fig .",
    "3 ) accompanied by irregular oscillations ( waves ) in the distribution of matter ( see fig .",
    "it should be noted that the oscillations of @xmath83 are not harmonic , and , similarly , the oscillations of density are not just uniform cycles of contraction / expansion  ( see fig .",
    "the initial value of a characteristic radius of static solution is never recovered in the course of these oscillations , i.e. the values of density at large @xmath12 during the process are considerably smaller than the initial ones .     and",
    "@xmath87 as functions of @xmath12 : at @xmath88  dashed line ; at @xmath89  solid line ; @xmath90  the turning point time . ]",
    "the obtained results serve only as an indication of the main dynamics properties of the system considered",
    ". we should now to give a direct analytical proof that for  @xmath91 there is a turning point in the dynamics of @xmath83 , while at @xmath92 there is not .",
    "at the same time we will be able to obtain the dependence of the turning point time on the mass of the graviton .",
    "since we are considering a small neighborhood of  @xmath93 , we use expansions on powers of  @xmath12 . taking into account the boundary conditions at  @xmath93 , for the functions @xmath56 and",
    "@xmath10 one can obtain @xmath94 substituting these expansions into  ( [ static ] ) and ( [ dynk ] ) yields @xmath95 and @xmath96 .",
    "similarly , @xmath97 substituting these expressions into  ( [ dynk ] ) and collecting terms with  @xmath98 , we obtain ( for short , we omit the argument  @xmath61 of functions  @xmath99 and @xmath100 ) : @xmath101 during the collapse the coefficient @xmath99 tends to zero , so in ( [ full ] ) we can take into account only the terms linear in  @xmath99 and neglect the terms with @xmath102 , @xmath103 , @xmath104 .",
    "so we obtain : @xmath105    it should be noted , that the solution of this equation ( this equation is valid only for small @xmath12 and only for the late stages of collapse ) , coincides with the solution of the equation arising in the cosmological model rtg @xcite , obtained for the case of zero pressure and with assumptions , that the maximum value of the scale factor of the universe @xmath106 is sufficiently large .",
    "so at a small vicinity of the origin and for the late stages of collapse we ( in some sense ) can observe a `` homogeneous isotropic universe '' . to evaluate the time of the turning point we note that the equation for the scale factor of the universe @xmath107 at the vicinity of the lower turning point @xmath108 , obtained in @xcite , coincides with ( [ line ] ) .",
    "for @xmath91 the solution of ( [ line ] ) is : @xmath109    for @xmath92 : @xmath110 from  ( [ line ] ) it follows that for @xmath111 the second term in the right hand side of equation  ( [ line ] ) can be neglected , and the evolution of the system is described by expression  ( [ linezer ] ) . for @xmath112",
    "the mass term becomes significant , the turning point is reached , @xmath99 starts to increase and its behavior in the neighborhood of the turning point is described by equation  ( [ linemass ] ) .",
    "numerical simulation shows that after the turning point the quantity  @xmath99 continues to increase , and after some time the linear approximation  ( [ line ] ) becomes invalid  ( see fig .",
    "3 ) . in this process",
    "@xmath99 reaches values comparable to its initial value , @xmath113 , and then starts to decrease again .",
    "therefore , we have proved that , in contrast to the massless theory , for arbitrarily small mass of the graviton the collapse stops , and a characteristic time elapsed from the beginning of the collapse to the turning point is proportional to  @xmath84 .",
    "the results of our numerical analysis performed for a wide class of model equations of state for the collapsing matter , on the one hand , confirm an intuitively obvious assumption that the presence of non - zero pressure slows down the process of the collapse , but does nt result in any qualitative changes in the dynamics of the system .",
    "however , we should note , that we have considered relatively small values of pressure at which neither collapse stopping nor critical phenomena  @xcite occur . on the other hand , for the case of the cold dust model",
    "the status of the rigorous analytical solution of the general relativity equations has been confirmed in the framework of the massless rtg .",
    "the dynamics described by equations of the massless rtg , as it was expected , exactly coincides with the dynamics of general relativity solution taken in the reference frame of a distant observer .",
    "namely , the coefficient  @xmath114 exponentially decays in the region where the density of matter is relatively large  ( it is this circumstance that leads to unbounded growth of  @xmath115  @xcite for finite matter density  @xmath68 ) , but reaches zero value only after infinite time .",
    "we also have studied numerically the influence of non - zero graviton mass on the properties of static solutions for a wide class of model equations of state .",
    "it appears , that the increasing of graviton mass leads to increasing of metric coefficient @xmath114 at the center of solution .",
    "so for a given equation of state and for the given mass of solution the increasing of graviton mass leads to a `` more flat '' static solution .    and , finally , we have studied the dynamics of the collapse in the massive rtg analytically and numerically .",
    "it appears that the time of a turning point in the collapse is proportional to @xmath84 , where @xmath23 is the graviton mass .",
    "if we take into account the existing estimates for the graviton mass  @xmath116 g , we can conclude that this time is proportional to @xmath117 , i.e. it is comparable with the age of the universe . due to technical constraints",
    "we have had to study a model in which the mass of the solution differs from the graviton mass by only 35 orders of magnitude .",
    "nevertheless , the obtained results confirm conclusions of the previous analysis made in ref .",
    "it should only be added that the pulsations of the dust sphere are irregular and its original size is not recovered in the course of evolution .",
