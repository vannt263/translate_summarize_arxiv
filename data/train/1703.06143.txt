    "accretion onto supermassive black holes ( smbhs ) , and the corresponding release of gravitational potential energy , power active galactic nuclei ( agn ) .",
    "this process requires that a significant amount of matter in the interstellar medium of a galaxy experience a loss of angular momentum sufficient to ultimately be captured by the smbh s accretion disk .",
    "numerical simulations suggest that major mergers of galaxies are an effective mechanism for removing angular momentum @xcite .",
    "observational evidence for this scenario includes bright quasi - stellar objects ( qsos ) that often show evidence of interactions or mergers at both obscured phases , such as dust - reddened qsos @xcite and ultra - luminous infrared galaxies ( ulirgs ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and in traditional qsos @xcite .",
    "this scenario is also consistent with the hierarchical paradigm of galaxy evolution , in which massive stellar bulges are capable of fueling smbh growth through mergers of gas rich galaxies @xcite and suggests that smbh growth may be linked with merger events in order to maintain observed correlations between smbhs and their host galaxies .",
    "for example , the masses of smbhs appear to be correlated with the stellar velocity dispersion @xcite and luminosities @xcite of the central stellar bulges , implying that the buildup of smbh mass is correlated with the buildup of stellar bulge mass @xcite .    the structures of disk galaxies , on the other hand",
    ", are thought to be shaped by the collapse of gas via energy dissipation and smooth accretion from cooling gas within the surrounding dark matter halo , with a previous phase of mergers shaping the central stellar bulge and stellar halo @xcite .",
    "while subsequent major mergers will not necessarily destroy the disk if the gas supply of the progenitors is very high and the resulting bulge component is small @xcite , simulations have been successful at reproducing the observed properties of more massive bulges ( corresponding to substantial smbh growth ) through major mergers of spiral galaxies @xcite , implying that agn hosted by disk galaxies may be triggered via alternative routes .",
    "such mechanisms include instabilities internal to the host galaxy @xcite and minor mergers @xcite .",
    "however , the relative roles of internal instabilities , minor mergers and major mergers for growing smbhs is unclear .",
    "for example , the majority of local agn reside in late - type galaxies unlikely to have experienced a major merger @xcite , though their luminosities do not extend to the more powerful regimes seen in high - redshift quasars .",
    "these observables are explained in the model of @xcite where secular smbh growth dominates in the local universe but remains important only for low - luminosity agn triggering toward high - redshifts as the rate of gas - rich mergers increases .",
    "however , finding direct and consistent evidence in support of this picture has been difficult .",
    "numerous studies find that high luminosity agn show no preference for existing in galaxies with signs of merger activity when they are compared to a control sample of inactive galaxies ( @xcite , though see @xcite for a potential luminosity dependence ) . on the other hand",
    ", several studies find that the fraction of agn in mergers , out of a parent agn sample , increases with increasing luminosity @xcite .",
    "the above qualitative disagreements may be due to the variable conditions under which agn triggering may happen within a galaxy merger . for example , the stage of the merging galaxy system may be a particularly important parameter for the triggered accretion rate .",
    "the tidal torques induced by the merger are predicted to funnel gas and dust toward the nuclear region of the merging system , and as the merger evolves the smbhs will lose angular momentum due to dynamical friction , thereby migrating toward the nuclear region as well .",
    "therefore , at later merger stages , and thus smaller smbh separations , the supply of gas for accretion is greater , such that the accretion rate is likely to be higher @xcite , albeit with considerable uncertainty as to the timescales of agn duty cycles .",
    "while several studies have examined the dependence on merger stage using nuclear separations as a proxy @xcite , spatial resolution limits have precluded systematic analyses from observing the small nuclear separations when the accretion rate is predicted by simulations to peak @xcite .",
    "furthermore , simulations predict that the probability of triggering one versus two agn within a merger may be different and depend on properties of the host galaxies , such as the mass of their nuclear stellar cores @xcite . additionally , nuclear obscuration in mergers may hinder the establishment of a connection between mergers and agn at optical wavelengths .",
    "indeed , @xcite found that the fraction of galaxies with disturbed morphologies increases with the level of nuclear obscuration , suggesting that this may be a key phase in the evolution of agn in galaxies but which is hidden from most observations .    to understand the conditions under which agn triggering is correlated with galaxy mergers , uniform merger samples with well - understood selection biases are necessary .",
    "while many galaxy merger candidates have been selected spectroscopically from velocity offset agn emission lines @xcite , the majority of them have been shown to host agn - driven outflows rather than dual smbhs based on follow - up observations @xcite . from imaging , several samples have been selected based on morphology , either visually @xcite or based on asymmetry @xcite .",
    "however , selection by morphology is not necessarily capable of quantifying the merger stage accurately if two nuclei are not visible .",
    "while samples based on galaxy pairs can measure separations , they are necessarily limited to earlier merger stages @xcite .",
    "however , resolved separations can be significantly reduced by spatially constraining the relative locations of two individual smbhs in a merging system @xcite . in this study",
    ", we exploit this concept by using a newly constructed sample of x - ray agn that are spatially offset from the nucleus of the host galaxy or a nearby companion galaxy from @xcite , hereafter referred to as paper i. the spatially offset agn sample can be used to quantify the merger stage based on separation , and was constructed using an astrometric registration procedure that detects offsets down to @xmath0 kpc .",
    "additionally , the sample also allows us to compare the merger scenarios for single agn formation against those of dual agn formation .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section [ sec : sample ] we described our sample , in section [ sec : analysis ] we analyze the effects of bolometric luminosity , nuclear separation , group environment and obscuration on the samples , in section [ sec : discussion ] we discuss the conditions that affect agn triggering in galaxy mergers and section [ sec : conclusions ] contains our conclusions .",
    "we assume the cosmological parameters of @xmath2 km s@xmath3 mpc@xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 throughout .",
    "in this section , we discuss the samples used in our analysis : an offset agn sample and two separate dual agn samples . the offset agn represent galaxy mergers hosting only a single agn that is off - nuclear ( section [ sec : offset_agn ] ) , and the dual agn represent galaxy mergers hosting two agn ( section [ sec : dual_agn ] ) .      for our sample of galaxy mergers hosting only a single agn",
    ", we use the spatially offset agn from paper i. full details of this sample can be found in paper i , though here we summarize the main properties .",
    "the agn ( type 2 ) were originally selected from galaxies in the sdss seventh data release ( dr7 ) that are located in the agn regime of the baldwin - phillips - terlivich ( bpt ) diagram @xcite . from overlapping archival _",
    "chandra _",
    "coverage , we identified hard x - ray sources that are required to be within the sdss fiber and satisfy the x - ray criteria of an agn : unabsorbed hard x - ray luminosity of @xmath6  @xmath7 erg s@xmath3 , or a hardness ratio of @xmath8  @xmath9 where @xmath8  @xmath10 and @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the number of hard and soft x - ray counts , respectively .",
    "the overlapping sdss and _ chandra _  images were astrometrically registered with our pipeline described in paper i , establishing the _ complete _  parent agn sample ( 48 ) .",
    "spatially offset x - ray agn were then selected as those with significant spatial offsets ( @xmath13 in significance but @xmath14 kpc in projected physical separation ) from the nucleus of the host galaxy or a nearby companion galaxy , establishing the _ complete _  offset agn sample ( 18 ) .    since the spatially offset agn detections require _ chandra _  imaging , the selection is biased toward agn that have been targeted by _",
    "this bias will affect our analysis if the agn were targeted as potentially being in merging systems since it will not represent a random sampling of agn ( see section 7.2 of paper i ) .",
    "this bias affects 8  offset agn from the _ complete _  sample .",
    "removing these 8  agn leaves a sample of 40  parent agn and 10  spatially offset agn based on an unbiased sample of _ chandra _  observations .",
    "these sources make up the final offset agn sample , and they are used in all of our subsequent analyses . below",
    "we describe several unique characteristics of our offset agn sample and how we address them in our analyses :    _ possible presence of dual agn : _ since our selection of offset agn in paper i  imposed several conservative x - ray thresholds , we can not rule out the possibility that any of them are dual agn systems with the second agn either below the x - ray source detection threshold or below the x - ray agn thresholds ( see section 7.1 of paper i ) .",
    "one particular example is the source sdssj110851.04 + 065901.5  ( sdssj1108 + 0659 ) which was selected as a spatially offset agn in paper i  but was also previously discussed in @xcite who interpreted the system to be consistent with a dual agn . while sdssj1108 + 0659  is excluded from the sample because it was targeted by a _",
    "chandra _  program as a dual agn candidate , secondary agn that are currently undetected may exist in some of our other offset agn systems . for uniformity , however , we adopt the definitions used in paper i  and note that our conclusions can only be said to apply to x - ray bright agn .",
    "we also acknowledge the possibility of two x - ray detected agn in one of our sources , sdssj111458.02 + 403611.41  ( sdssj1114 + 4036 ; see section 7.1 of paper i ) , though we note that using the secondary x - ray source ( sdssj1114 + 4036sw ) instead of the primary x - ray source ( sdssj1114 + 4036ne ) has a negligible effect on our results .",
    "_ sdss fiber size : _ as described in paper i , due to the @xmath15 sdss fiber radius , spatial offsets between the x - ray agn and galaxy centers may be contained entirely within the fiber or not ( see figure 3 of paper i ) . since the x - ray agn is always constrained to be within the fiber radius , this distinction is made between cases in which the x - ray agn is offset from a galactic core that is inside the fiber ( ` in - fiber `  offset agn ) versus a galactic core that is outside the fiber ( ` out - fiber `  offset agn ) .",
    "we emphasize that the distinction between the ` in - fiber `  and ` out - fiber `  subsamples is not a selection effect but merely an artifact of the sdss fiber size .",
    "however , a side effect of this artifact is that spectroscopic coverage is available for the offset galactic cores of the ` in - fiber `  subsample ( smaller separation pairs with unresolved secondary nuclei in sdss imaging ) but not for the ` out - fiber `  subsample ( larger separation pairs with resolved secondary nuclei in sdss imaging ) . in principle",
    ", this difference should not affect our results concerning the agn properties assuming the x - ray agn detection is associated with the optical agn detection from the fiber spectrum .",
    "still , given that the fiber coverage of the overall systems is generally larger for the ` in - fiber `  subsample , in each analysis subsection we consider the effects of removing the ` out - fiber `  offset agn .",
    "_ nature of the x - ray sources : _ since x - ray sources significantly in excess of @xmath6  @xmath16 erg s@xmath3 are known to be associated with accreting smbhs , the criterion of @xmath6  @xmath17 erg s@xmath3 is likely to rule out a non - agn contribution @xcite .",
    "sources that only pass the @xmath8  @xmath18 criterion , however , may have smaller values of @xmath6  and therefore more ambiguous physical origins",
    ". the x - ray luminosity function of off - nuclear x - ray sources does not extend far above @xmath19 erg s@xmath3 @xcite , with only a few brighter sources known ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "these objects , known as hyper luminous x - ray sources ( hlxs ) , are often associated with intermediate mass black holes ( imbhs ) .",
    "such sources in our sample with @xmath6  @xmath20 erg s@xmath3 are likely associated with either a lower luminosity agn or otherwise accretion onto imbhs with high hardness ratios @xcite , an event that is likely the result of a minor galaxy merger . at lower luminosities ( @xmath6  @xmath21 erg s@xmath3 )",
    ", however , we can not rule out the possibility of stellar - mass systems in star - forming regions ( ultra - luminous x - ray sources ) that are passing through phases of unusually hard x - ray spectra that can mimic the higher hardness ratios typically seen in agn @xcite . finally , we noted in paper i  that the ionizing nature of agn optically classified as low - ionization nuclear emission regions ( liners ) is ambiguous and may not originate from accretion onto nuclear massive black holes @xcite .",
    "therefore , in each analysis subsection we consider the effects of removing the subsample that does not pass the threshold of @xmath6  @xmath22 erg s@xmath3 or is optically classified as a liner .",
    "our goal in this subsection is to create a sample of dual agn from the literature for comparison to our offset agn .",
    "since no samples currently exist that satisfy both the optical and x - ray selection criteria from paper i , we have constructed two dual agn samples , one of which is optically - selected ( section [ sec : sdss_dual_agn ] ) and the other of which is x - ray - selected ( section [ sec : bat_dual_agn ] ) .",
    "similar to the offset agn parent sample , the parent sample of the optically - selected dual agn is derived from the sdss dr7 spectroscopic agn @xcite .",
    "since we require _ chandra _  detections to spatially isolate the agn relative positions , we have cross - matched the sdss spectroscopic agn with unique detections from the _ chandra _  source catalogue ( csc ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) within @xmath15 to create the final parent sample of the optically - selected agn .",
    "from this parent sample , we use the previously identified dual agn systems found in the two studies that have selected dual agn starting from the sdss spectroscopic agn sample and for which @xmath23 imaging reveals spatially distinct x - ray agn @xcite .",
    "the two samples are described below :    there are two systems from @xcite that the authors classify as dual agn : sdssj1108 + 0659 , also in our _ complete _  offset agn sample ( section [ sec : offset_agn ] ) , and sdssj114642.47 + 511029.6  ( sdssj1146 + 5110 ) .",
    "the x - ray agn in each pair are separated by @xmath13 and @xmath14 kpc , thereby satisfying the spatially offset criteria from paper i. however , in both systems one of the x - ray sources ( sdssj1108 + 0659nw  and sdssj1146 + 5110sw ) passes the x - ray agn selection criteria from paper i , while the other x - ray source ( sdssj1108 + 0659se  and sdssj1146 + 5110ne ) does not pass either of the @xmath6  or @xmath8  criteria .",
    "however , @xcite find sdssj1108 + 0659se  likely to be an agn based on a one - dimensional analysis of the psf profiles and x - ray luminosities ( soft and hard ) that are several times the expected contribution from star - formation , and they find sdssj1146 + 5110ne  likely to be an agn because the soft x - ray luminosity is more than an order of magnitude larger than the expected contribution from star - formation . furthermore , slit spectroscopy of these two  systems from @xcite suggest that two agn may be present in each system . while sdssj1108 + 0659  is also in our _ complete",

    "_ two caveats about the sdss  dual agn sample : _ first , the sdss  dual agn were originally selected for follow - up imaging ( @xmath34 ) as dual agn candidates because of explicit double - peaks in the narrow agn emission lines of the sdss spectra and therefore do not represent an unbiased sample of agn .",
    "second , the two  dual agn systems from @xcite would only be selected as offset agn by the criteria from paper i , whereas we have adopted their dual agn interpretations ; in this sense , we can not claim the same x - ray properties for the dual agn as our offset agn sample .",

    ", we discuss the offset and dual agn scenarios in the context of agn luminosity ( section [ sec : disc_single_dual ] ) , merger stage ( section [ sec : disc_sep ] ) , the combined effect of agn luminosity and merger stage ( section [ sec : sep_lum ] ) , and finally nuclear obscuration ( section [ sec : obscuration ] ) .      as mentioned in section [ sec : lbol_frac ] , some observational evidence suggests that high - luminosity agn are preferentially found in galaxies that are interacting , merging , or have merged in the past , while other studies find no evidence for agn hosts to have different morphologies from inactive galaxies . in section [ sec : lbol_frac ] and figure [ fig : frac_lbol_oiii ] , we used our agn merger samples ( selected independent of galaxy or merger morphology ) to address this discrepancy , producing the following results :    based on their parameterizations ( section [ sec : lbol_frac ] ) , the offset and dual agn fractions behave differently as a function of @xmath28 .",
    "the offset agn fraction displays no significant evolution over the agn bolometric luminosity range probed ( @xmath76  significance ) as shown in figure [ fig : frac_lbol_oiii ] ( top ) .",

    "these results can be broadly interpreted as in agreement with claims of a positive correlation between the agn merger fraction and bolometric luminosity .",
    "specifically , observations of large - scale ( 10 - 100 kpc ) galaxy pairs have shown that the agn merger fraction is highest for major mergers @xcite , implying that major mergers are more efficient at removing angular momentum from gas and dust in their host galaxies .",
    "additionally , @xcite find that their bat - selected dual agn are preferentially found in major mergers .",
    "therefore , dual agn host systems may show a preference for major mergers so that enough fuel is available to power both agn .",
    "for example , of the three  sdss  dual agn systems , two are hosted by major mergers @xcite .",
    "since the sample from @xcite extends to high redshifts and was selected based on morphology , that sample may contain a relatively higher fraction of major mergers that allow for easier visual classification , possibly accounting for the agreement between that sample and the comparison sdss dual agn sample .    by contrast , offset agn may show a preference to reside in minor mergers instead of major mergers .",
    "for example , in section [ sec : environ_frac ] we examined the distribution of the number of group members for both the parent and offset agn , finding no significant evidence for a difference between the two samples ( figure [ fig : hist_ngroup ] ) and that both samples reside in relatively low - density environments .",
    "however , since the procedure used for measuring group members is not sensitive to galaxies with masses @xmath135 m@xmath136 @xcite , we are likely missing many lower - mass group members . therefore , compared to galaxy mergers seen in dense environments of more massive galaxies , the offset agn are more likely to be undergoing mergers with galaxies of lower masses , corresponding to mass ratios that fall in the minor merger regime",
    ".    however , we caution that the offset agn slope is consistent within @xmath91 with those of both dual agn samples ( figure [ fig : frac_lbol_oiii ] ) so that the true difference between offset and dual agn evolution with agn bolometric luminosity is poorly constrained .",
    "we also note that the effect of merger mass ratio on agn triggering is still poorly understood at small separations , particularly for offset agn , and may also depend on whether or not loss of angular momentum happens more efficiently in the major or minor galactic stellar core .",
    "currently , theoretical work has provided ambiguous results , with one model suggesting that the more luminous agn likely resides in the more massive stellar bulge @xcite , while a recent simulation of galaxy mergers has suggested that the accretion rate is higher for the agn in the less massive galaxy @xcite . in paper iii ,",
    "follow - up imaging of our offset agn sample with @xmath137 will put constraints on these predictions by allowing estimates of the merger mass ratios and smbh accretion rates .      as mentioned in section [ sec : phys_sep_frac ] , numerical work predicts that the probability of agn triggering becomes strongest at separations below @xmath138 kpc as the two smbhs dynamically evolve toward the region of greatest gravitational potential along with a significant amount of gas and dust for accretion . in section [ sec : phys_sep_frac ] and figure [ fig : frac_phys_sep ] , we used our agn merger samples ( with measured physical separations reaching below @xmath138 kpc ) to test this prediction , producing the following results :    evidence for a negative correlation with nuclear separations below @xmath92 kpc is seen at @xmath39 significance for both the offset agn fractions ( @xmath102 ) and the dual agn fractions ( @xmath112@xmath134@xmath108 ) as shown in figure [ fig : frac_phys_sep ] .",
    "while the physical separations of the dual agn sample do not allow us to see this trend continue below @xmath139 kpc , we are able to do so for the offset agn sample due to our astrometric registration procedure .",
    "indeed , the slope magnitude for the offset agn fractions is larger ( by @xmath140 ) than those of the dual agn fractions , an indication that the merger fraction rises most strongly at the smallest separations .",
    "a similar , or larger , increase may be seen in the dual agn sample with a larger sample size or with data points at separations @xmath114 kpc .",
    "our finding that the agn merger fraction rises fastest and peaks ( down to our resolution limits ) below 1 kpc is consistent with numerical predictions .    at large separations , the offset agn fractions and the dual agn fractions are consistent with the slope of the agn merger sample presented in @xcite .",

    "our results are also consistent with other studies @xcite .",
    "when examining the absolute values of the agn merger fractions , we see that the offset agn and sdss  dual agn fractions ( below @xmath142 kpc ) of @xmath143 and @xmath144 , respectively , are in agreement when accounting for their @xmath91 uncertainties . that the offset agn and sdss  dual agn fractions are consistent at small separations may be indicating that , among similarly selected samples , dual agn triggering becomes more likely at smaller separations and comparable to single agn triggering .",
    "this result is consistent with the expectation that there is an increased supply of gas for accretion at smaller nuclear separations .",
    "the generally larger values of the bat  dual fraction may indicate a stronger overall dependence of agn triggering on nuclear separation in that sample , though this conclusion is tenuous due to the substantial uncertainties ( @xmath145 below @xmath142 kpc ) and @xmath91 overlap with the offset agn and sdss  dual agn .      since the frequency of agn observability in mergers peaks at small separations due to the increased availability of fuel for accretion",
    ", we may also expect that this regime coincides with enhanced accretion rates among agn . to investigate this prediction ,",
    "we have examined the dependence of the offset agn fractions as a function of nuclear separation for two subsamples that are separated by bolometric luminosity : @xmath28  @xmath146 erg s@xmath3 and @xmath28  @xmath147 erg s@xmath3 ( figure [ fig : frac_phys_sep_lbollohi ] ) . due to the smaller numbers in each subsample compared to the full offset agn sample",
    ", we have used bin sizes of @xmath148 kpc .",
    "as shown in figure [ fig : frac_phys_sep_lbollohi ] , the fractions in the low- and high - luminosity bins are consistent within their uncertainties throughout the entire range of separations investigated .",
    "therefore , we see no statistically significant evidence that the occurrence of offset agn is dependent on luminosity at any given nuclear separation . however , we note that the greatest divergence between the two fractions ( by @xmath89 ) occurs at the smallest separation . while this result is tenuous due to the large uncertainties , it may hint that while an overall dependence of the offset agn fraction with bolometric luminosity is not seen ( section [ sec : lbol_frac ] ) , it does appear at small nuclear separations when the supply of gas for accretion is larger .",
    "this result is also qualitatively consistent with the results from @xcite in which the luminosities of dual agn increase at smaller separations .",
    "we caution that the observability of agn in these systems depends not only on luminosity but also on the timescale of activity which we can not measure . still , these combined results are overall consistent with the numerical predictions that the bolometric luminosities of agn in merging systems peak at merger stages corresponding to small separations @xcite .",
    "heavy obscuration of the nuclear regions of galaxies undergoing mergers is predicted by models of galaxy and quasar co - evolution in which mergers trigger enhanced levels of accretion onto agn but also pass through a stage of enhanced obscuration @xcite .",
    "therefore , the continuum emission of agn that are hosted by on - going galaxy mergers may preferentially exhibit signs of obscuration compared to agn in non - merging systems .",
    "extreme examples of agn obscuration are found in ulirgs that are rich in gas and dust @xcite , with most emission from the accretion disk obscured except for high energy photons such as hard x - rays .",
    "heavily obscured ( compton - thick ) agn , in which x - ray emission is severely obscured , may constitute a significant population of agn in galaxy mergers @xcite and therefore understanding the role that x - ray absorption plays in the link between galaxy mergers and agn is crucial .",
    "the effect of obscuration in optically - selected and x - ray detected dual or offset agn was noticed independently by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "their samples of dual and offset type 2 agn systems show systematically lower observed hard x - ray to [ ] @xmath57  luminosity ratios compared to the optically - selected type 2 agn sample from @xcite . since the [ ] @xmath57  emission line originates far enough from the smbh to not be subject to nuclear obscuration , this result suggests that dual and offset agn are suffering heavier nuclear obscuration than the general population of type 2 agn .",
    "in fact , @xcite have shown that even the absorption - corrected hard x - ray luminosities of their sample are still under - luminous compared to a general sample of type 2 agn that was cross - matched with the @xmath23 source catalogue @xcite .",
    "this has led to the suggestion that the low counts and/or intrinsically high absorbing columns result in systematically underestimated column densities .",
    "the analysis in section [ sec : loiii_lx ] showed that , while the offset agn sample has a lower mean hard x - ray to [ ] @xmath57  luminosity ratio than the parent agn , the difference is not at a significant level . therefore , no evidence of preferential nuclear obscuration is seen .",
    "this result is opposite that seen in @xcite and @xcite , and may be a result of the spatially offset selection introducing a bias toward face - on systems ( as numerically predicted in paper i ) with shallower absorbing columns",
    ". however , it may also be a result of the x - ray selection properties that target x - ray bright agn with intrinsically little nuclear obscuration . that the selection may preferentially target galaxy mergers with relatively dust - free nuclear regions means the sample is fundamentally different from the prototypical mergers seen in gas - rich systems such as ulirgs and",
    "may be probing a specific subclass of galaxy mergers .",
    "we have used our systematically constructed sample of spatially offset agn from paper i  to constrain the parameters under which agn triggering is driven by galaxy mergers . due to the selection of galaxy mergers based on offset x - ray agn , our sample is not biased toward morphological disturbances or large projected physical separations , allowing us to investigate the agn merger fraction in major or minor mergers and at early or late merger stages .",

    "the offset and dual agn fractions are similar at small separations , suggesting that the efficiency of dual agn triggering becomes similar to single agn triggering at late merger stages when significant material is available for accretion .",
    "we can only trace the dual agn sample down to @xmath156 kpc , while the resolution of our offset agn sample allows it to be traced down to @xmath1 kpc where we see the most significant increase .",
    "our sample of offset agn has allowed this analysis to be extended down to @xmath0 kpc for the first time .",
    "we see tentative evidence that the inverse dependence of the agn merger fractions on separation become strongest when restricted to a high agn luminosity subsample ( figure [ fig : frac_phys_sep_lbollohi ] ) . if real , this result would be consistent with numerical predictions that agn triggering probabilities increase with decreasing nuclear separations , and that this late merger stage also corresponds with the stage of highest agn luminosity .",
    "the hard x - ray to [ ] @xmath57  luminosity ratios of offset agn show no significant evidence for a difference from that of the parent agn ( figure [ fig : plot_lx_loiii ] ) , in contrast to the expectation from studies of many known merging galaxy systems .",

    "<S> galaxy mergers are likely to play a role in triggering active galactic nuclei ( agn ) , but the conditions under which this process occurs are poorly understood . in paper </S>",
    "<S> i , we constructed a sample of spatially offset x - ray agn that represent galaxy mergers hosting a single agn . in this paper , we use our offset agn sample to constrain the parameters that affect agn observability in galaxy mergers . </S>",
    "<S> we also construct dual agn samples with similar selection properties for comparison . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the offset agn fraction shows no evidence for a dependence on agn luminosity , while the dual agn fractions show stronger evidence for a positive dependence , suggesting that the merger events forming dual agn are more efficient at instigating accretion onto supermassive black holes than those forming offset agn . </S>",
    "<S> we also find that the offset and dual agn fractions both have a negative dependence on nuclear separation and are similar in value at small physical scales . </S>",
    "<S> this dependence may become stronger when restricted to high agn luminosities , though a larger sample is needed for confirmation . </S>",
    "<S> these results indicate that the probability of agn triggering increases at later merger stages . </S>",
    "<S> this study is the first to systematically probe down to nuclear separations of @xmath0 kpc ( @xmath1 kpc ) and is consistent with predictions from simulations that agn observability peaks in this regime . </S>",
    "<S> we also find that the offset agn are not preferentially obscured compared to the parent agn sample , suggesting that our selection may be targeting galaxy mergers with relatively dust - free nuclear regions . </S>"
