    "the ability to have computer models that can achieve genuine understanding of natural language text is a long - standing goal of artificial intelligence  @xcite .",
    "the problem can be formulated in a relatively straight - forward manner , by borrowing the same techniques that are used for measuring reading comprehension in human students : given a text passage , measure how well they can answer questions related to the information being presented in that passage .",
    "previous attempts towards achieving this goal have ranged from hand - engineered grammars  @xcite , to predicate - argument extraction and querying  @xcite , to exploiting recently - proposed reading - comprehension datasets  @xcite using various machine learning approaches  @xcite . to better understand the current state of affairs in this field , let us take a look at two publicly - available reading - comprehension datasets and recap the current state - of - the - art ( sota ) results .",
    "the mctest  @xcite contains about 500 stories associated with 2000 questions ( 4 questions per story ) , and 4 choices per question ( only one correct ) ; the stories and questions are written at the reading - level of elementary - school students ( e.g. , `` james the turtle was always getting in trouble . '' ) .",
    "the human - level performance on this dataset is estimated to be in the high 90% range .",
    "the sota on this dataset is about 70% accuracy  @xcite , obtained using a model that combines both traditional and more recent language - understanding tools , such as syntax , frame semantics , co - reference , and word embeddings .",
    "it s worth noting here that models using various neural - network architectures achieve only about 53% accuracy  @xcite , presumably because the small data size does not allow for optimal parameter estimation .    at the other end of the spectrum",
    "is the cnn / dailymail dataset  @xcite , which is based on news articles from cnn and dailymail ; the number of examples are in the hundreds of thousands , and the reading - level of these text is high - school / college level ; the questions are created from the bullet - point summaries that accompany these articles , and a clever entity - anonimization technique is used to ensure that only the information from the current passage is used to provide the answer ( e.g. , `` according to the sci - fi website @entity9 , the upcoming novel @entity11 will feature a capable but flawed @entity13 official ... '' ) . on these datasets ,",
    "the human - level performance is estimated to be around 75% accuracy  @xcite , while the sota is currently at 76.1 on cnn  @xcite , and 75.8 on dailymail  @xcite .",
    "consistent with the last research findings in a variety of natural - language tasks for which enough supervised training data is available , the sota results are achieved using neural - network models .",
    "for instance , the results in  @xcite are achieved using a neural - network architecture based on the _ attentivereader _ model originally proposed by  @xcite , together with some modifications that prove effective for the task .",
    "but since sota and human accuracy are so close for the cnn / dailymail dataset , we conclude that it has fulfilled its mission and is now headed towards retirement ( at least in the current form as a machine - comprehension dataset ; see  @xcite for a useful reincarnation in the context of abstractive summarization ) .    in this context",
    ", we present a dual contribution to the field of machine comprehension of text .",
    "first , we present a technique via which one can obtain machine - comprehension datasets based on widely - available news data ( e.g. , the english gigaword  @xcite ) ; we use this technique to generate a datasets of around 2 million examples , on which we estimate that the human - level accuracy is in the 90% range ( in a 5-way multi - choice setup ; for comparison , a random - guess approach has 20% accuracy ) .",
    "second , we present a novel neural - network architecture that combines the representation power of recurrent neural networks with the discriminative power of fully - connected multi - layered networks , and achieves the best results we could obtain on our dataset : 83.2% accuracy .",
    "these contributions open the doors for building interesting challenges for the machine comprehension task , along the following dimensions : we build such datasets over text that uses rich language constructs on both the input side ( hence a requirement for understanding the context ) and the output side ( hence a need for understanding the answers ) , thus capturing a large spectrum of natural language understanding challenges ; the large size of such datasets allows for exploring the performance of machine - learning models in a supervised - learning setting , including data - hungry models such as deep neural - network architectures ; last but not least , we can use the difference between the human - performance ceiling on these datasets and the current sota to assess the progress made in the field of machine comprehension of text .",
    "we release the machine - comprehension dataset used in this paper to the research community , in order to facilitate direct comparisons against the results reported in this paper , as well as boost the influx of new contributions to the field .",
    "in this section , we describe an algorithm for the creation of machine comprehension datasets , based on exploiting paragraph vector  @xcite models .",
    "the data requirement is that of a large set @xmath0 of @xmath1 pairs , of the type that can be extracted from a variety of publicly - available corpora , for instance the english gigaword  @xcite .",
    "the pseudo - code for the creation of the dataset is presented below :    train paragraph - vector model @xmath2 + @xmath3 + @xmath4 +    algorithm mc - create takes three main parameters : a dataset @xmath5 ; an integer @xmath6 that controls the paragraph - vector neighborhood size ; and a function @xmath7 , used to score the @xmath6 entries for each such neighborhood .",
    "the first step of the algorithm involves training a paragraph - vector model using the title entries in dataset @xmath0 . for a given title @xmath8 in @xmath0 , its @xmath6 closest neighbors in @xmath9",
    "are denoted @xmath10 .",
    "each title entry @xmath11 in @xmath10 is scored against the @xmath12 pair according to the @xmath7 function . in what follows",
    ", we are using the following @xmath13 function definition :    ( , ) = \\ {    rl 0 , & ( , ) l + _ e ( , ) & + + _ s ( , ) & + + ( 1-_s ) ( , ) ) & +    .",
    "[ eq : score ]    this function uses the notation @xmath14 to indicate a similarity score based on the surface of the strings @xmath11 and @xmath8 , and @xmath15 to indicate a similarity score based on the paragraph - vector representations of @xmath11 and @xmath8 .    the @xmath7 function first verifies if the surface - based similarity for pair @xmath16 exceeds some threshold @xmath17 . in that case",
    ", the function returns 0 , as a guard against considering pairs that are too surface - similar ; otherwise , it computes a weighted linear combination ( using weights @xmath18 and @xmath19 ) between the embedding - based similarity @xmath15 and the surface - based similarities @xmath20 for both @xmath16 and @xmath21 .",
    "intuitively , the higher this value is , the more likely it is that @xmath11 is a good decoy for @xmath8 with respect to article @xmath22 .    for the dataset released with this paper and the experiments contained here ,",
    "we used the following hyper - parameters : @xmath14 is computed using bleu  @xcite ( with brevity - penalty=1 ) ; @xmath15 is computed as the cosine between the embedding representations @xmath23 and @xmath24 ; @xmath18 = 1 ; @xmath19 = 0.5 ; @xmath25 ; the paragraph - vector model @xmath26 is trained using the pv - dbow model  @xcite using softmax sampling , for 5 epochs with a token minimum count of 5 , and an embedding size of 256 .",
    ".statistics over the dataset created by mc - create over the afp portion of the gigaword . [ cols=\"<,>,>,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     the results indicate that tied embeddings have a net positive effect : it reduces the number of model parameters by nearly half , while also contributing between 4 and 6 absolute points in accuracy .",
    "the mechanism of bilinear attention  @xcite is also superior to the one using only a tanh layer  @xcite , by influencing the decoder outputs such that the loss favoring classification accuracy ( @xmath27 ) is minimized .",
    "it contributes about 5 absolute accuracy - points , in a manner that is orthogonal with the contribution of the tied - embeddings , for a high - water  mark of 83.2% accuracy on the test set .",
    "the task of making machine truly comprehend written text is far from solved . to make meaningful progress , we need to attack the problem on two different fronts : build high - quality , high - volume datasets for training and testing machine - comprehension models ; and , given the full complexity of natural language  @xcite , invent comprehension models that can be trained to perform well on this task .",
    "this paper presents contributions on each of these fronts .",
    "the algorithm presented in section  [ sec : alg ] , mc - create , can be used to create datasets that are both high quality and high volume , starting from data that appears naturally in today s world ( e.g. , news ) . since",
    "the method presented is language - agnostic , it can also be used to create mc datasets in languages other than english , a promising prospect . regarding models of comprehension ,",
    "the proposed hybrid model not only performs at a high - level on the dataset , but has the potential to tackle a lot of other tasks that present both a generation and a discrimination component .",
    "such advances in the machine - comprehension task have the potential to move the field forward in the pursuit of genuine understanding of natural language by computers .",
