    "cross section of the @xmath0 process at the c.m.s .",
    "energies @xmath1  gev within the framework of the vector meson dominance model is determined by radiative decays of light vector mesons @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 .",
    "these decays belong to the class of magnetic dipole transitions and represent major interest for study of quark structure of vector mesons and for tests of low - energy models of strong interactions , such as non - relativistic quark model , effective potential models , etc . @xcite .",
    "study of this process allows to improve accuracy of the parameters of the @xmath11 decays .    the only previous measurement of the decay @xmath12 was carried out by nd detector @xcite : @xmath13 .",
    "this result agrees with the pdg value for isotopically complementary channel : @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "the @xmath15 decay was studied in several experiments @xcite .",
    "the world average decay probability @xmath16 @xcite .    in this work we present the study of the @xmath0 process with snd detector at vepp-2 m collider .",
    "the snd detector @xcite consists of an electromagnetic calorimeter , tracking and muon systems .",
    "the main part of the detector is a three - layer spherical electromagnetic calorimeter consisting of 1600 crystals .",
    "total thickness of the calorimeter for the particles flying from the interaction point is @xmath17 .",
    "total solid angle is @xmath18 .",
    "the energy resolution of the calorimeter for photons is @xmath19 , the angular resolution is @xmath20 .",
    "the experiment was carried out at vepp-2 m collider @xcite with snd detector @xcite .",
    "the data were collected in march ",
    "july , 1998 @xcite at 30 points in the energy range @xmath1  gev .",
    "the total integrated luminosity used for the analysis was @xmath21  pb@xmath22 .",
    "the beam energy determination was based on measured magnetic field in the bending magnets and beam revolution frequency in the collider .",
    "the error of the center of mass energy determination consists of two parts : 0.1  mev  relative accuracy of energy setting for each energy point and 0.2  mev  general energy scale bias common for all points within the experiment .",
    "in this work the process @xmath0 was studied in the three - photon final state .",
    "the main sources of background are qed processes @xmath23 and @xmath24 with extra photons of the machine background .",
    "other possible sources are process @xmath25 , and cosmic background .      for an event to be recorded the snd first level trigger ( flt ) required at least two clusters",
    "of hit crystals in the calorimeter and no signals in neither tracking nor muon systems .",
    "the flt threshold on calorimeter energy deposition changed with the beam energy , but was always below @xmath26 .",
    "the reconstructed events were first put through primary selection which required at least @xmath27 neutral and no charged particles , total energy deposition @xmath28 , total momentum measured by the calorimeter @xmath29 , polar angles of the two highest energy photons @xmath30 , the polar angle of the third photon ( descending order in energy ) @xmath31 , and the energy deposition of this photon @xmath32 .",
    "these conditions select three - photon events , suppress machine background and two photon annihilation events with additional background clusters in the calorimeter . as a result",
    "@xmath33 events were selected for further analysis .    in order to improve energy and angular resolution for photons",
    "the selected events were kinematically fitted with total energy and momentum conservation constraints .",
    "the fit results are the value of @xmath34 of the hypothesis and fitted kinematical parameters of the photons .",
    "the kinematic fit improves resolution in invariant mass of photon pairs from @xmath35 decays from @xmath36  mev to @xmath37  mev ( fig.[fig : m2 g ] ) .",
    "the @xmath38 distribution is shown in fig.[fig : xi2 ] . for additional suppression of cosmic and machine backgrounds we required @xmath39 .",
    "this cut also implicitly limits maximum energy of initial state radiation ( isr ) photons in the process under study ( fig.[fig : rceff ] ) . in order to suppress 2-photon annihilation background , each selected event",
    "was kinematically fitted to @xmath24 hypothesis and restriction on calculated @xmath40 was applied : @xmath41 .",
    "the @xmath42 distribution is shown in fig.[fig : xi2 ] .",
    "the only significant backgrounds to the process under study remaining after described above cuts are @xmath25 and qed @xmath43 annihilation . in the latter process",
    "all kinematically allowed combinations of the photon energies and angles are present , so this background can not be completely eliminated and must be subtracted . to this end",
    "all events , which passed primary selection and kinematic fit cuts , were divided into two classes : events with @xmath44 were assigned to class * _ a _ * , the rest  to class * _ b_*. here @xmath45 is an invariant mass of a photon pair after kinematic fitting ( fig.[fig : m2 g ] ) .",
    "the total number of the selected class * _ a _ * events is 36513 .",
    "the fraction of @xmath25 background in this class is less than @xmath46 .",
    "for the class * _ b _ * this fraction is up to @xmath47 .",
    "for calculation of integrated luminosity the special sample of @xmath24 events ( class * _ c _ * ) was selected using following criteria : no charged particles , at least two neutral particles , energy depositions for two most energetic photons @xmath48 , their polar angles @xmath30 , azimuth acollinearity @xmath49 , polar acollinearity @xmath50 , event does not belong to classes * _ a _ * or * _ b_*. it is necessary to note significant contribution of @xmath0 events to the class * _ c _ * ( up to @xmath51 at @xmath9 resonance ) .",
    "the @xmath0 cross section in the framework of vdm can be parameterized as follows @xcite : @xmath52 here @xmath53 and @xmath54 are coupling constants , @xmath55 is the @xmath56 resonance mass , @xmath57 is the energy - dependent width of the resonance taking into account processes with branching ratios larger than @xmath58 , @xmath59 represents possible non - resonant contribution . using following formulas for coupling constants : @xmath60 where @xmath61 and @xmath62 are cross sections of @xmath63 and @xmath64 for @xmath65 , eq.([mth : crosspg ] )",
    "can be transformed to the form more suitable for data approximation:@xmath66 where @xmath67 is a non - resonant contribution .",
    "we used two different models for description of interference phase between @xmath68 decay amplitudes . for model with energy - independent interference phases , @xmath69 . in this case",
    "the @xmath70 is expected to be @xmath71 for pure @xmath72 and @xmath73 isotopic states .",
    "electromagnetic @xmath72-@xmath73 mixing leads to nonzero value of @xmath70 .",
    "it can be estimated from @xmath74 : @xmath75 .",
    "the second model is based on mixed propagator approach @xcite :    @xmath76    where @xmath77 is @xmath6 mixing self - energy .",
    "detection efficiency for @xmath0 process depends not only on c.m.s .",
    "energy @xmath78 but also on energy of extra photons emitted by initial particles @xmath79 . the detection efficiency @xmath80 was determined by monte carlo simulation with isr taken into account .",
    "the energy and angular distributions of isr photons were generated according to refs . @xcite .",
    "the dependence of detection efficiency on @xmath79 approximated by a smooth function is shown in fig.[fig : rceff ] for @xmath81  mev .",
    "the noticeable peak in detection efficiency near isr kinematic limit corresponds to the case when @xmath82 invariant mass is close to @xmath83 and isr photon is emitted at the large angle and detected .",
    "the effective threshold on the isr photon energy @xmath84 is determined by @xmath85  restriction and can be defined as a width at half maximum of the @xmath80 . at @xmath81  mev @xmath86 .",
    "the @xmath87 dependence on @xmath78 is shown in fig.[fig : rceff ] .",
    "the visible cross section of the @xmath0 process was calculated as @xcite : @xmath88 where @xmath89  is cross section , the function @xmath90 is electron `` radiator '' function @xcite . for data presentation",
    "we used traditional form:@xmath91 where @xmath92 and @xmath93 are defined as:@xmath94    for simulation of the background process @xmath23  ( qed ) the lowest - order formulas from @xcite were used .",
    "visible cross section calculated using monte carlo simulation was corrected for higher order loop diagrams and soft photons emission @xcite using @xmath87 as an upper limit of soft photons energy .",
    "the correction varied in the range of @xmath95 .",
    "we expect that the accuracy of the calculated @xmath23 visible cross section is not worse than @xmath96 .    for simulation of the process",
    "@xmath24  ( qed ) used for luminosity determination the formula from @xcite taking into account additional photon emission was used .",
    "the accuracy of the visible cross section determination is estimated as @xmath58 .",
    "the fit package @xcite was used for data fitting .",
    "the fitting was done by means of maximum likelihood method on all three data sets ( classes * _ a_*,*_b_*,and * _ c _ * ) simultaneously .",
    "expected number of events in the @xmath97-th energy point was calculated as:@xmath98 visible hadronic cross sections were calculated according to eq.([mth : viscalc ] ) and corrected for beam energy spread . because the @xmath0 process gives noticeable contribution to events of luminosity process @xmath24 , the integrated luminosity ( @xmath99 ) was recalculated on every iteration step of the minimization .",
    "the accuracy of determination of the c.m.s .",
    "energy is worse than the accuracy of the @xmath73-meson mass value .",
    "therefore we introduced the possible energy scale bias @xmath100 as a free parameter .",
    "other fit parameters were @xmath101 , @xmath102 , @xmath67 , @xmath70 or @xmath77 depending on approach to phase factor ( eqs.([mth : crosspg])([mth : mixing ] ) ) calculation , and @xmath103 .",
    "the @xmath103 parameter is a ratio of measured and calculated @xmath104 cross sections .",
    "parameters of the process @xmath105 were taken from @xcite : @xmath106 for other cross section parameters the world average values @xcite were used .",
