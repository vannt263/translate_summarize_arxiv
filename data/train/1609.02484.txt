    "in @xcite unitary representations of thompson s group @xmath1 were constructed from simple data .",
    "special cases made it clear that all knots and links can naturally be constructed from @xmath1 by completing the `` pair of trees '' way of representing elements of @xmath1 .",
    "this process is inherently unoriented but in @xcite it was also shown that restricting the construction to a certain subgroup @xmath2 we may naturally orient the link .",
    "what was missing in @xcite was the specific construction of unitary representations of @xmath3 . in this paper",
    "we fill this gap .",
    "we use the construction of @xcite which simplified and considerably extended the construction of @xcite by realising the thompson groups as the groups of fractions of certain categories of forests in such a way that the representations are almost tautological .    here",
    "we will reconstruct @xmath0 as the field of fractions of an oriented version of the category of binary planar forests in such a way that use of a unitary element of an appropriate planar algebra will give the homflypt polynomial @xcite as coefficients of the vacuum vector .",
    "the construction works for any tqft link invariant whose braid group representations are made unitary by the markov trace .",
    "let @xmath4 be a function from @xmath5 to @xmath6 .",
    "such that @xmath7 .",
    "let @xmath8 and @xmath9 be given .",
    "we consider the vector spaces @xmath10 given by the homflypt skein module for the circle with @xmath11 boundary points .",
    "that is to say the quotient of the space of all linear combinations of conway tangles of oriented links ( orientations compatible at the boundary with @xmath4 with @xmath12 out and @xmath13 in ) modulo the skein relation + @xmath14{figp}\\ ] ]    this vector space has a natural * -structure given by reflection and the condition @xmath14{figq}\\ ] ]    one needs to specify a first point on the boundary of a diagram as well .",
    "see @xcite for more details .",
    "the homflypt polynomial equips the @xmath15 with scalar products @xmath16 where if @xmath17 and @xmath18 are tangles , @xmath19 is the homflypt polynomial of the link : + @xmath14{figr}\\ ] ]    the inner product @xmath20 on @xmath15 defined above is positive semidefinite if @xmath21 for @xmath22 .",
    "this is a corollary of wenzl s paper @xcite in which the result is proved for the special choice of @xmath23 with @xmath24 . to get from this choice of boundary orientations to any other one ,",
    "first observe that the permutation group @xmath25 is transitive on all the @xmath23 .",
    "so it suffices to show that positivity is conserved if the boundary orientation @xmath23 is changed to @xmath26 by applying a transposition between adjacent elements . for this simply surround the circle in which the tangles live with a single crossing as : + @xmath14{figs}\\ ] ]",
    "this defines a @xmath20-preserving linear map from @xmath27 to @xmath28 .",
    "[ real ] if one changes the * -structure by making an oriented crossing self - adjoint , the inner product becomes positive semidefinite when @xmath29 .",
    "recall from @xcite that a pair of binary planar trees representing an element of @xmath1 determines a surface with boundary as below : @xmath14{figt}\\ ] ]    @xmath14{fig2}\\ ] ]    @xmath3 is the subgroup of @xmath1 for which this surface is orientable and one chooses an orientation @xmath31 for the leftmost part of the surface in the picture .",
    "the link which is the boundary of the surface is then oriented with the boundary orientation .",
    "it is shown in @xcite that , modulo distant unknots , every oriented link arises in this way from an element of @xmath0 .    in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 2.1 ) a group of fractions was associated to an object @xmath32 in a category @xmath33 having three properties , namely    1 .",

    "let @xmath36 .",

    "3 .   ( cancellation ) given two morphisms @xmath39 and @xmath40 , if @xmath42 for @xmath43 then @xmath44 .",
    "if the category has one object the group of fractions is due to ore .",
    "more importantly an action of the group of fractions is associated to any functor @xmath45 from @xmath33 to another category @xmath46 . in the case where @xmath33 is the category of planar binary forests",
    ", @xmath32 is the forest with one root and one leaf , the group of fractions is thompson s group @xmath1 and morphisms are obtained whenever @xmath46 has a morphism which behaves like a tree with one root and two leaves .",
    "in particular in the category of unoriented tangles a crossing provides such a morphism .",
    "applying a unitary unoriented tqft to the picture gives unitary representations of @xmath1 on a hilbert space with a special `` vacuum '' vector @xmath47 so that the coefficient @xmath48 is the invariant that the tqft assigns to the link .",
    "we will now repeat this construction by constructing a category @xmath30 of planar binary forests with extra orientation data .",
    "@xmath30 will satisfy the axioms of @xcite and its group of fractions will be obviously isomorphic to @xmath0 . moreover assigning _ oriented _ crossings to the forks in @xmath30 will give a functor to the category of tangles and applying a unitary oriented tqft such as su(n ) at some level will give a unitary representation of @xmath0 whose coefficients @xmath48 produce the homflypt polynomial of the oriented link constructed from @xmath49 in @xcite .",
    "for @xmath50 an _ @xmath51-sign _ will be a sequence of @xmath51 @xmath31 s and @xmath52 s beginning with @xmath31 , then @xmath52 ( if @xmath53 .",
    "an @xmath51-sign determines a bi - colouring ( by @xmath54 ) of the regions to the left of @xmath51 points on @xmath55 so that the infinite left region is coloured @xmath31 ( adjacent regions other than the leftmost two may have the same colour ) .",
    "binary planar forests are as in @xcite .",
    "they form a category under stacking .    given an @xmath56-sign @xmath4 and a binary planar forest @xmath37 whose @xmath56 roots lie on @xmath55 and whose @xmath51 leaves lie on a parallel copy of @xmath55 , the colouring of the regions between the roots of @xmath37 extends uniquely to a colouring of the regions of the planar map given by the forest , with the property that regions sharing an edge of @xmath37 which emanates clockwise from a triple point have different colours . as illustrated in the diagram @xmath57with @xmath58 , @xmath59 : + @xmath14{figu}\\ ] ]    obvious from the diagram .",
    "thus @xmath37 and @xmath4 together determine an @xmath51-sign @xmath60 which can be read off from the copy of @xmath55 containing the leaves of @xmath37 . in the above example",
    "@xmath4 is @xmath61 and @xmath60 is @xmath62 .",
    "the map @xmath63 is functorial , i.e. @xmath64 .    the claim is actually a consequence of the uniqueness of the procedure described in the former proposition .",
    "in fact , on the one hand we have a colouring of the regions determined by @xmath49 and induced by @xmath4 , which in turn extends to a colouring of the regions determined by @xmath37 and induced by @xmath65 . on the other hand , since @xmath66 is forest we also have a naturally induced colouring of the regions determined by @xmath66 and @xmath4 .",
    "the claim now follows by the uniqueness of the procedure .    the category @xmath30 has as objects all pairs of the form @xmath67 where @xmath4 is an @xmath51-sign and the morphisms from @xmath68 to @xmath69 are the pairs @xmath70 where @xmath71 .",
    "composition of morphisms is obvious .",
    "consider @xmath72 , with @xmath73 being the unique @xmath74-sign .",
    "then @xmath30 satisfies the unit , stabilisation and cancellation properties .",
    "we start with the unit property .",
    "a morphism in @xmath75 is just a binary tree @xmath37 such that @xmath76 .",
    "the set of these trees is non - empty since one can always determine a planar binary tree for a given @xmath51-sign as done in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 5.2 , p. 31 ) .",
    "now we take care of the stabilisation property .",
    "we recall that one can describe the elements of the oriented thompson group @xmath77 as pairs of trees ( see @xcite for the notation , cf .",
    "@xcite ) . given two elements @xmath78 and",
    "@xmath79 , if one wants to perform the multiplication @xmath80 , one needs to find other representatives of the factors of the form @xmath81 and @xmath82 .",
    "this can be done by adding pairs of opposing carets .",
    "then the product is @xmath83 . in the same way , in the present situation , we may add `` carets '' and vertical lines forming the forests / morphisms @xmath39 and @xmath40 to the trees / morphisms @xmath37 and @xmath49 and obtain the same tree @xmath41 .",
    "the cancellation property is clear .",
    "the group of fractions of @xmath30 is naturally isomorphic to @xmath0 .",
    "a pair of morphisms in @xmath30 from @xmath32 to any fixed object is , by definition , a pair of binary planar trees together with a bi - colouring of the graph described in @xcite . thus forgetting the @xmath51-signs defines a homomorphism from the group of fractions of @xmath30 onto @xmath0 which is injective since the planar tree @xmath37 determines @xmath84",
    "let @xmath85 be the category whose objects are sequences @xmath23 of an odd number of signs and whose morphisms @xmath86 are the oriented conway tangles in a rectangle with @xmath56 points on the bottom and @xmath51 points on the top so that the string incident on the @xmath87 point on the bottom is ingoing or outgoing if @xmath88 is @xmath52 or @xmath31 respectively . and the string incident on the @xmath87 point on the top is ingoing or outgoing if @xmath89 is @xmath31 or @xmath52 respectively . composition is stacking of tangles . here is an element of @xmath86 : + @xmath14{figv}\\ ] ] where @xmath90 and @xmath91 .",
