    "<S> thermodynamic and magnetic properties in these materials strongly depend on the @xmath0 level splitting by the crystal electric field ( cf ) . </S>",
    "<S> inelastic neutron scattering ( ins ) , well established for the determination of this splitting in bulk materials , requires large sample volumina . </S>",

    "<S> it is non - trivial , however , to independently assess the crystal field splitting and the quantitative strength of kondo screening which both affect the magnitude and temperature dependence of the paramagnetic response @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> this development was boosted by exploiting resonance enhancement of the excitation process and by the significant improvement of the detection sensitivity . </S>",
    "<S> notable advantages of rs are its high spectral resolution and its ability to reveal excitation symmetry properties by utilizing well - defined light polarization configurations . apart from vibration mode studies , rs has also been utilized for investigating electronic excitations , including a few studies of cf excitations in rare earth materials @xcite . to our knowledge , to this date </S>",
    "<S> all published raman results from @xmath0 electrons originate from bulk samples @xcite .    in this letter </S>",
    "<S> , we report on the direct determination of the cf - induced @xmath0 level splitting in ultrathin cept@xmath1 layers ( between 3.5 and 18.0 unit cells ) from crystal field excitations ( ce ) in @xmath4 electronic raman scattering in uhv . </S>",
    "<S> three distinct ce raman peaks are identified . </S>",
    "<S> their electronic nature follows from both their temperature dependence and their absence in isostructural lapt@xmath1 films without @xmath0 electrons , whereas both materials feature very similar vibrational raman losses . </S>",
    "<S> the ce peaks of cept@xmath1 exhibit individual evolutions of intensity vs. cept@xmath1 film thickness . </S>",
    "<S> this allows us to assign them to spatially distinct ce positions in the specimens , i.e. , at the cept@xmath1/pt(111 ) interface , ` bulk - like ' sites , and those adjacent to the pt surface termination layer .    </S>",
    "<S> the preparation of ordered ce - pt and la - pt phases has been reported in the literature @xcite , and the specimens of the present study were prepared essentially according to these procedures . in brief , clean pt(111 ) </S>",
    "<S> surfaces were prepared by repeated cycles of @xmath5 kev ar@xmath6 ion sputtering and annealing at @xmath7 k. the surface intermetallic phases were then generated by evaporating the desired amount of ce ( la ) onto the substrate near ambient temperature and subsequently annealing the specimen to @xmath8 k for 5 - 10 min . </S>",
    "<S> they are readily identified by their characteristic leed patterns @xcite . for the la - pt system </S>",
    "<S> we observe a similar succession of structural phases as in cept@xmath1 @xcite which , however , evolves much faster as a function of coverage . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , from the reported evidence and similarities between the phases @xcite , auger electron spectroscopy , and the results below we conclude that the la - pt phases consist of lapt@xmath1 . in line with previous work </S>",
    "<S> we specify the intermetallic thickness @xmath9 in nominal multiples of unit cells ( u.c . ) along the surface normal ( 1 u.c . </S>",

    "<S> , the specimens were transferred _ in situ _ to the uhv optical analysis chamber ( residual pressure p < 2@xmath1110@xmath12 mbar ) and mounted onto a continuous - flow he cryostat . </S>",
    "<S> an initial set of raman spectra taken at room temperature ( rt ) was followed by a series of low - temperature measurements ( lt , @xmath13 k ) . the samples were excited by the 2.54 ev and 2.41 ev lines of an ar@xmath6-ion laser ( incident power : 100 mw ) .    </S>",
    "<S> the scattered light was collected in near - backscattering geometry by an f/3 lens system and analyzed by a single monochromator ( spex 1000 m ) with ccd detector ( andor idus series , quantum efficiency @xmath14 ) . inserting an ultra - steep long - pass edge filter ( semrock razoredge ) into the optical path allowed the detection of raman signals down to 9 mev from the laser line . </S>",
    "<S> the energy resolution ( fwhm ) was approximately 0.4 mev . </S>",
    "<S> polarization dependent spectra were recorded with vertically polarized incident radiation and either vertically ( ` vv ' ) or horizontally ( ` vh ' ) polarized detection . </S>",
    "<S> spectra taken without polarization selection will be denoted as ` vu ' . </S>",
    "<S> typical integration times for a single spectrum amounted to 900 s.     surface layer ( 18  u.c . ) on pt(111 ) , and a reference sample with a lapt@xmath1 surface layer ( 12 u.c . ) , taken at t = 300  k.

    "<S> for both materials the vu spectra exhibit three pronounced raman losses between 12 and 18 mev which we label as v1 , v2 , and v3 . these peaks may be attributed to vibration modes owing to their polarization and thickness dependence ( see fig .  [ </S>",
    "<S> fig : intensitaetdickeltcept5 ] below ) as follows . </S>",

    "<S> the cept@xmath1 thickness obvioulsy entails a concomittant increase of the v1 spectral weight which we attribute to the growing ` inner volume ' of the intermetallic film . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , features v2 and v3 show much less of a thickness dependence and we therefore attribute them to the uppermost region of the intermetallic film , where the lattice symmetry is reduced from d@xmath22 to c@xmath23 due to structural relaxations , as shown by a recent leed - iv analysis @xcite . as a result , </S>",
    "<S> four additional modes are now raman allowed , two of which ( e@xmath3 and a@xmath24 ) possess the polarization dependences observed for v2 and v3 . </S>",
    "<S> these assignments are readily transferred to the lapt@xmath1 specimens , since the polarization dependence of their vibration features ( not shown ) is an exact match to those of cept@xmath1 . at lt ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : polarisationceptlaptrtlt](b ) the vibrational raman features exhibit reduced line widths as well as small but systematic frequency shifts the detailed discussion of which is deferred to a later publication @xcite .    here , we focus on the remarkable difference between the two materials instead , represented by the emergence of two new raman features appearing in cept@xmath1 at loss energies of ( 23.1 @xmath25 0.2 ) mev ( ce2 ) and ( 25.4 @xmath25 0.1 ) mev ( ce3 ) , while obviously absent in lapt@xmath1 . in hindsight </S>",
    "<S> we note that a faint contribution of these electronic transitions may already be discerned in the rt spectra . </S>",
    "<S> a third peak will be identified further below . </S>",
    "<S> no other spectral signatures were found up to 180 mev .    </S>",
    "<S> we attribute the additional raman peaks in the cept@xmath1 spectrum to ce @xmath0 cf excitations . </S>",
    "<S> this seems to be a natural choice since the main difference of ce with respect to la consists of the extra @xmath0 electron , and cf excitations generally acquire more intensity at low temperature @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the appropriateness of this attribution may once again be discussed based on the polarization dependence of the new features , which is similar to that of v1 . in the cf picture </S>",
    "<S> the hexagonal symmetry of the ce site in cept@xmath1 leads to a splitting of the @xmath26 multiplet into three kramers doublets of pure @xmath27 , @xmath28 , and @xmath255/2 character , which belong to the double group representations @xmath29 , @xmath30 , and @xmath31 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> since the quadrupole selection rules for ce raman transition in the present geometry require @xmath32 , only the transitions involving the @xmath331/2 doublet are symmetry allowed , i.e. @xmath34 ( @xmath35 ) and @xmath36 ( @xmath37 ) . </S>",
    "<S> their polarization dependence is encoded in the irreducible representations contained in the direct products @xmath38 and @xmath39 , respectively . both share @xmath20 as a member which we already identified with the vibration mode v1 . </S>",
    "<S> the symmetry analysis thus leads us to expect that the ce peaks and v1 have the same polarization dependence , which is readily confirmed for ce2 and ce3 from fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : polarisationceptlaptrtlt](b ) . a closer inspection of the cept@xmath1 raman spectra at small @xmath9 reveals that there is actually a third , broader excitation , as shown in the inserts to fig .  </S>",

    "<S> the observation of three distinct ce excitations clearly can not be reconciled with a single cf splitting scheme valid for all ce sites alike . </S>",
    "<S> the key to their understanding lies in evaluating their spectral intensities as a function of intermetallic film thickness @xmath9 . to this end </S>",
    "<S> , each raman spectrum was subjected to a least squares fit by a superposition of gaussians above a linear background . in fig .  [ </S>",
    "<S> fig : dickenabhaengigcfe1biscfe2 ] , we report the spectral weights of the lt electronic raman losses , normalized to the background intensity at 20 mev . their dependence on @xmath9 is quite individual : while the intensity of ce1 rapidly decreases with increasing film thickness and vanishes for @xmath9@xmath42 u.c . </S>",
    "<S> , the ce2 intensity shows a complementary increase , and that of ce3 is thickness - independent within experimental error for @xmath9@xmath43 u.c . </S>",
    "<S> therefore we assign the different cf excitations to ce atoms with different local environments in the intermetallic films .    </S>",
    "<S> the rapid decrease of the ce1 intensity suggests that it is related to the ce sites in the vicinity of the interface to the pt(111 ) substrate . </S>",
    "<S> its rate of decay with @xmath9 leads to an estimated attenuation length of @xmath44 ( 6.0 @xmath25 1.5 ) nm . </S>",
    "<S> the steady growth of the ce2 intensity is very reminiscent of the behavior of the vibration peak v1 of the cept@xmath1 film and hence suggestive of associating it with the cf excitations in the ` inner ' , bulk - like volume of the film . </S>",
    "<S> based on the @xmath45 estimate , however , one would expect a signature of saturating intensity of ce2 as well as v1 in the limit of largest @xmath9 , which is clearly not the case . </S>",
    "<S> a non - saturating growth of v1 may arise from an increase of scattering efficiency upon gradually acquiring bulk - like symmetry with increasing film thickness . </S>",
    "<S> this will also lead to stronger electronic scattering provided there is significant coupling to the vibration mode . </S>",
    "<S> such coupling was indeed discussed and detected in earlier work @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> finally , the nearly thickness - independent intensity of feature ce3 is very compatible with cf excitations limited to the vicinity of the film surface . </S>",
    "<S> the spatial dependence of the cf energies highlights that the cf splitting may sensitively depend on the local surroundings ` even in a metal ' . </S>",
    "<S> a similar conclusion was recently reached concerning the nature of the electronic ground state in a ce - pd surface alloy on the basis of photoemision experiments @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> -layer - thickness dependence of the raman intensities at t = 20 k of electronic transitions ce1 to ce3 between crystal - field - split ce 4f levels . </S>",
    "<S> these crystal field excitations are denoted as ce1 to ce3 . </S>",
    "<S> inset : schematic assignment of the cf excitations to interface ( i ) , film ( f ) , and surface ( s ) . ]    a conclusion with respect to the character of the ce transitions ( @xmath34  vs.   @xmath36 ) can be reached by using complementary information . from xas experiments it was concluded that the states with @xmath46 are highest in energy and that the splitting between the states with @xmath47 and @xmath48 amounts to less than 1 mev @xcite . on this basis </S>",
    "<S> we can unanimously state that the raman losses observed here all are of @xmath36 character and represent excitations from lower - lying states with @xmath27 to excited states with @xmath49 . </S>",
    "<S> the temperature dependence of x - ray linear and cirular dichroism at the ce m@xmath50 edges furthermore suggested an energy scale for the total cf level spread of @xmath51 mev for @xmath9 @xmath52 u.c . and </S>",
    "<S> @xmath53 mev for @xmath9 @xmath43 u.c . </S>",
    "<S> , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> given that the xas probing depth is smaller by roughly a factor 4 to 6 compared to the present work , this level of almost quantitative agreement is extremely gratifying . </S>",
    "<S> both sets of experiments also agree in that no higher lying cf excitations are observed in the ultrathin cept@xmath1 films . detecting the cf excitations by raman scattering offers the compelling advantage of high spectral resolution , though . </S>",
    "<S> it allows us to discriminate between coexisting ce @xmath0 schemes involving minute differences at the quantitative level which would otherwise go unnoticed . </S>",
    "<S> also , the level of accuracy achievably by direct observation of the excitations exceeds by far what can be obtained from fitting boltzmann distributions in temperature dependent experiments .    </S>",
    "<S> the high spectral resolution also allows us to examine the width of the ce raman losses and to address the question of the enhanced width of ce1 compared to ce2 and ce3 . </S>",
    "<S> here we can draw an analogy with ins . </S>",
    "<S> recently , willers et al .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite have noted for ce compounds a positive correlation between the width of cf excitations in ins and the strength of hybridization between ce @xmath0 electrons and itinerant states seen by xas , suggesting that hybridization contributes significantly to reducing the lifetime of the cf excited states . in this respect </S>",
    "<S> our raman results are fully in line with these ins observations . </S>",
    "<S> the ce1 excitation relates to the cf splitting scheme which is predominant at small film thickness and is characterized by a large width of the raman loss peak . </S>",
    "<S> this is also the thickness regime of strongest ce @xmath0 hybridization @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , the regime of stronger hybridization and hence stronger kondo screening @xcite correlates with the occurrence of a smaller overall cf splitting . </S>",
    "<S> a similar conclusion seems to hold in the case of ceag@xmath54 films , albeit on a much reduced energy scale @xcite .    in summary , we have shown that besides the vibration modes also the crystal field splitting of @xmath0 electron levels can be determined with high accuracy by direct observation of raman scattering from electronic transitions between cf - split levels , even for ultrathin intermetallic films comprising just a few atomic layers and a moderate density of rare earth atoms . in our exemplary study of cept@xmath1/pt(111 ) </S>",
    "<S> the observation of three distinct ce raman peaks for ce atoms at the cept@xmath1-pt(111 ) interface , within ` bulk - like ' cept@xmath1 layers , and adjacent to the film surface , reveals the different crystal fields of these atomic environments . </S>",
    "<S> the small energy difference between ce2 and ce3 in particular could hardly have been resolved by other means . </S>",
    "<S> the electronic origin of these raman peaks is substantiated by their absence in isostructural lapt@xmath1 , and their polarization dependence is in accordance with the lattice symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> raman spectroscopy thus lends itself as a viable laboratory - scale alternative for analyzing the crystal - field level structure of ultrathin metallic rare - earth compounds with high sensitivity and accuracy . </S>"
