    "solid - state lasers containing frequency - doubling crystals are efficient and compact sources of coherent visible optical radiation . unfortunately , when they operate in multimode regime , one observes irregular fluctuations of the output intensity .",
    "this behavior , referred to as the green problem , has been reported for the first time by baer [ baer , 1986 ] .",
    "he found that these instabilities arise from a coupling between longitudinal modes of the laser due to sum - frequency generation .",
    "in particular , when such a laser operates in a single longitudinal mode , its output is stable [ kennedy & barry , 1974 ] . in the case of two oscillating longitudinal modes , the output intensity is stable only for small values of nonlinearity , otherwise both modes tend to pulse on and off out of phase [ baer , 1986 ] .",
    "when the number of lasing modes is larger than two , the laser can exhibit , depending on the parameters describing it , various types of behaviour such as : antiphase dynamics [ james et al .",

    "one of the motivations of the large number of papers devoted to intracavity - doubled solid state lasers and published during the last decade has been the need to find a configuration and the range of parameters describing the lasers , which could guarantee a stability of their outputs .",
    "several ways to reach this goal have been found , for example , an introduction of a quarter - wave plate into the laser cavity , a proper alignment of the angle between birefringent axes of the active medium and the nonlinear crystal [ james et al .",
    ", 1990a , james et al .",
    ", 1990b , roy et al . ] , a placing of a tilted mirror inside the cavity [ ustyugov et al . , 1997 ] , or an utilization of the effect of sum - frequency - mixing [ falter et al . , 1997 ,",
    "danailov & apai 1994 ] .",
    "moreover , it has been predicted analytically [ james et al . , 1990b ] and confirmed experimentally [ magni et al . , 1993 ]",
    "that when the number of oscillating longitudinal modes is set to be sufficiently large ( for example , by increasing the length of the laser cavity ) the output of the laser becomes stable . besides",
    ", the green problem can also be avoided in the case of a single mode operation of the laser , which can be obtained , for example , by use of an intracavity etalon [ baer , 1986 ] or a birefringent filter [ nagai et al . , 1992 , fan , 1991 ]    the main goal of this paper is to continue the investigations of the green problem .",
    "the fact that the cross - saturation coefficient is modulated by the spatial hole - burning effect is taken into account .",
    "firstly , the stabilization of the laser radiation by an increase of the number of longitudinal modes , as proposed in [ james et al . , 1990b , magni et al . , 1993 ] is analyzed .",
    "the results presented in [ james et al . , 1990b , magni et al . ,",
    "1993 ] , where the cross - saturation coefficient was assummed to be constant for all modes , are compared with the numerical data .",
    "it is shown that the theoretically obtained [ wang & mandel , 1993 ] linear dependence of the minimal number of modes necassary for stabilization the laser output on the strength of nonlinearity agrees with the numerical solutions only in the case of sufficiently small nonlinearity . for larger values of nonlinearity , due to the cancellation of modes during the evolution , the minimal number of modes obtained by the numerical simulations is larger than the number which follows from the theoretical predictions . for very large nonlinearity",
    "this cancellation is so strong that only a few modes survive ( even when there are initially 250 oscillating modes in the laser cavity ) .",
    "therefore , a large number of simultaneously oscillating modes necessary for stabilization of the laser output can not be achieved .",
    "a similar situation takes place when the cross - saturation coefficient is modulated by the effect of spatial hole - burning , therefore the stabilization of the laser output by an increase of the number of longitudinal modes is not always possible , as a result of a strong competition between modes and a cancellation of some of them during the evolution .",
    "however , the problem of the stabilization of the laser output can be solved in another way , namely , by an increase of the strength of nonlinearity , which leads to very strong competition between the modes , so that during the evolution all of them , but a single one , are canceled .",
    "as a consequence , a steady - state solution , which is stable against small perturbations , arises .",
    "this is the stabilization mechanism proposed in the present paper .",
    "it is valid in the case of constant cross - saturation coefficient , as well as in the case when the spatial hole - burning is taken into account .",
    "the analysis presented in this paper is based on the baer - type rate equations [ baer , 1986 ] extended by roy , bracikowski and james to the case when the effect of spatial hole - burning is taken into account [ roy et al . ,",
    "bracikowski & roy , 1991 ] .",
    "these equations have the following form : @xmath0    ( p , q ) = _ 0 _ 0 | |_z_0^z_0+l , [ cross ]    @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the number of longitudinal modes ; @xmath3 and @xmath4 are , respectivelly , the cavity round trip time and the fluorescence lifetime ; @xmath5 and @xmath6 are , respectively , the intensity and gain of the @xmath7-th longitudinal mode ; @xmath8 is the cavity loss parameter for the @xmath7-th mode ; @xmath9 is the small signal gain ; @xmath10 and @xmath11 describe , respectivelly , self - saturation of the @xmath7-mode and cross - saturation between two modes , @xmath7 and @xmath12 ; @xmath13 is the scaling parameter ; @xmath14 is the length of the gain medium ; @xmath15 is the length of the laser cavity , @xmath16 is the distance of the gain medium from the first cavity mirror , ( as shown in fig .",
    "1 ) ; @xmath17 is the wavevector of the longitudinal cavity mode @xmath7 with the wavelengths @xmath18 .",
    "note that even through in eq .",
    "( [ cross ] ) three parameters : @xmath15 , @xmath14 , and @xmath16 are present , the modified cross - saturation coefficient depends only on two rescaling parameters , @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "the parameter @xmath21 is a nonlinear coefficient which describes the conversion efficiency of the fundamental intensity into the doubled intensity",
    ". the terms @xmath22 and @xmath23 in eq .",
    "( 1 a ) account for the loss in the intensity of the fundamental frequency through second harmonic generation and through sum - frequency generation , respectivelly .",
    "the set of equations ( 1 a , b ) has a rather complicated structure and it is not possible to solve it analytically .",
    "therefore , the results presented in this paper has been obtained with the aid of the numerical method of runge - kutta .",
    "in this section the approximation that the cross - saturation coefficient is constant for all modes : @xmath24 , is used .",
    "it is assumed that losses and small signal gains are the same for all modes , i.e. @xmath25 , where @xmath26 .",
    "other parameters describing the system have been chosen as follows : @xmath27 , \\t_f=0.24 \\ , [ ms ] , \\al=0.015 , \\g=0.12 ,   \\b_0=0.06 $ ] .",
    "the number of longitudinal modes , @xmath28 , and the strength of nonlinearity , @xmath29 , are not fixed and they are varied in the analysis .",
    "as the first step let us consider the dependence of the laser output on the number of longitudinal modes initially excided in the laser cavity . from the numerical simulations it follows that for very small nonlinearity , @xmath30 , the laser output is stable , even for a large number of longitudinal modes . in the case of larger nonlinearity , @xmath31 , as it can be seen from fig .",
    "2a , the behavior of the laser output is complicated and already for three simultaneously oscillating longitudinal modes the total intensity exhibits irregular oscillations .",
    "when the number of modes increases , amplitudes of those oscillations slowly increase ( see fig .",
    "2b representing the results for 70 modes ) .",
    "finally , when the number of modes is larger than the critical value , the total stabilization of the laser output occurs , as shown in fig .",
    "however , for slightly higher than previously considered value of nonlinearity , @xmath32 , we have not observed the stabilization of the laser output , even for very large number of longitudinal modes , @xmath33 ( compare the total intensity of the laser output for @xmath34 , @xmath35 , and @xmath33 modes , shown , respectivelly , on figs . 2d , 2e , and 2f ) .",
    "this happens because of cancelation of modes , as a result of a competition between them , which takes place during the evolution .    the dependence of the minimal number of modes neceessary for stabilization of the laser output on the strength of nonlinearity is presented in fig .",
    "3 . as it can be seen , for small nonlinearity , @xmath36",
    ", there is a rather good agreement between theoretically [ wang & mandel , 1993 ] and numerically obtained results .",
    "however , when nonlinearity increases , @xmath37 , the minimal number of modes obtained in numerial simulations is larger than the number predicted theoretically .",
    "this discrepancy is the result of the competition between modes , which leads to cancellation of some of them during the evolution .",
    "when @xmath38 the cancellation is so big that after some time only few modes survive , thus a sufficiently large number of modes necessary for stabilization of the laser can not be realised .",
    "concluding , depending on the relation between nonlinearity and the number of longitudinal modes , the dynamics of a multimode , intracavity - doubled , solid - state laser can be divided into four regions as illustrated in fig .",
    "5 . in particular , when nonlinearity is small and the number of modes is larger than a critical value the output of the laser is stable .",
    "examples of such a behavior , which is labeled as region i , are shown in fig .",
    "4a . with increasing nonlinearity the complexity of the behaviour of the laser increases and irregular fluctuations of the output intensity appear .",
    "this behavior , depicted in fig .",
    "4b , corresponds to region ii . for even larger values of the strength of nonlinarity the cancellation of modes",
    "starts to take place .",
    "when nonlinearity exceedes the critical value @xmath39 the evolution of the output intensity leads to a cancellation of a large number of modes , so that only a few of them survive .",
    "as s result , a stabilization of the laser output can not be obtained .",
    "this behavior , illustrated in fig .",
    "4c , is classified as region iii . when nonlinearity is larger than the critical value @xmath40 there is such a large mutual cancellation of modes that after some time only one of them survives .",
    "therefore , the steady - state solution , shown in fig .",
    "4d , which is stable against small perturbations , arises .",
    "this mechanism of stabilization , achieved by forcing the laser to operate in the one - mode regime , is similar to other approaches presented in the literature , where the stabilization is obtained by inserting into the laser cavity an additional element like an etalon [ baer 1986 ] or a birefringent crystal [ nagai et al . , 1992 , fan , 1991 ] .",
    "however , the method proposed here seems to be a better solution , since no additional element is involved .",
    "in this section the analysis presented in the previous section is extended to take into account the effect of spatial hole - burning .",
    "the present analysis is based on the baer - type rate equations , eq .",
    "( 1 ) , modified by bracikowski , roy and james [ roy et al . ,",
    "bracikowski & roy , 1991 ] , who have written down an explicit form for the cross - saturation coefficient , eq .",
    "( 2 ) , but were not investigating the influence of the spatial hole - burning on the laser dynamics .",
    "as far as the autors know , the analysis presented in this section is the first study of this issue .",
    "similarly to the previous section , two ways of the laser stabilization are analyzed : by increasing the number of longitudinal modes and by increasing the strength of nonlinearity .",
    "parameters describing the laser cavity are chosen to be as follows : @xmath41,$ ] @xmath42,$ ] @xmath43 $ ] .",
    "our results show that when the spatial hole - burning effect is taken into account ( i ) the competition between the modes is much stronger than in the case of the cross - saturation coefficient constant for all modes ( ii ) .",
    "therefore , the minimal number of modes which are necessary to obtain the stabilization of the laser output is in the case ( i ) larger than in the case ( ii ) .",
    "for example , for the strength of nonlinearity @xmath44 only 80 modes are necessary in the case ( ii ) , as shown on fig .",
    "2c , while in the case ( i ) even 200 initially oscillating modes are not sufficient for the stabilization of the laser output , as shown on fig . 6c .    therefore , an alternative approach of the stabilization of the laser output based on an increasing of the strength of nonlinearity , which has been proposed in the previous section , can be examined . indeed , from the results of the numerical simulations , displayed in fig .",
    "6f it follows that the stabilization of the laser output can be obtained when the nonlinearity is larger than a critical value .",
    "this occurs because of an extensive cancellation of modes , due to which the laser operates in a single longitudinal mode .",
    "in this paper the properties of the dynamics of multimode intracavity - doubled solid - state lasers have been studied .",
    "the infulence of spatial hole - burning on the cross - saturation coefficient was taken into account .",
    "the system was described by the rate equations of baer - type , which were solved numerically with the aid of the runge - kutta method .",
    "firstly , the case of the cross - saturation coefficient constant for all modes was considered .",
    "the minimal number of modes necassary for the stabilization of the laser output was defined and its dependence on the strength of nonlinearity was studied .",
    "it was shown that for small nonlinearity this dependence is linear and agrees with the theoretical predictions . however , for larger values of nonlinearity the minimal number of modes was found to be larger than the number obtained in theoretical considerations . as a reason of this discrepancy the effect of the competition between the modes and cancellation of some of them during the evolution was given .",
    "it was also observed that with increasing of nonlinearity the competition between modes increases , so that for some values of nonlinearity the initially large number of oscillating modes is reduced to only a few of them . for much higher values of nonlinearity",
    "this competition is so strong that only a few modes survive .",
    "therefore , a large number of simultaneously oscillating modes can not be realised and the stabilization can not be obtained in this way .",
    "however , we propose another method based on the increase of the strength of nonlinearity .",
    "this stabilization occurs for such a high value of nonlinearity , for which all modes , besides a single one , are canceled during the evolution . in this case",
    "a steady - state solution , stable against small perturbations , arises .",
    "a similar analysis was accomplished for the cross - saturation coefficient modulated by the effect of spatial hole - burning .",
    "we have shown that in this case the stabilization of the laser output by increase of the number of longitudinal modes is hardly possible .",
    "therefore , an alternative approach of the stabilization based on an increasing of the strength of nonlinearity have been examined and shown to be an appropriate solution .",
    "the method of a stabilization of a laser output , as proposed in our paper , is similar to other approaches presented in the literature where the stable output of the laser is achieved by forcing the laser to operate in a single - mode regime , for example , by inserting into the cavity an etalon or a birefringent crystal .",
    "however , the method proposed here offers a better solution , since no insertion of an additional element into the laser cavity is needed .",
