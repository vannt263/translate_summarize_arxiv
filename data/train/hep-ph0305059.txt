    "evidences for neutrino oscillations and hence for neutrino masses and mixings seem to be getting more and more solid .",
    "the results from solar and atmospheric neutrino experiments as well as those using terrestrial neutrinos as in the k2k and kamland experiments which are responsible for this very important conclusion have together with chooz and palo - verde experiments clearly established the mixing pattern among different neutrino generations .",
    "it seems that two of the three neutrino mixings i.e. @xmath6 and @xmath7 are large and the third angle @xmath8 is small@xcite .",
    "we will follow the literature and call this the bi - large mixing pattern .",
    "this good news on the mixing front is however not shared by the masses i.e. our knowledge of the neutrino mass pattern is far from clear . at the moment",
    "three obvious possibilities i.e. ( i ) normal mass hierarchy , ( ii ) inverted mass hierarchy and ( iii ) degenerate mass pattern are equally viable .",
    "the challenge for future experiments is therefore twofold : to pin down the mass pattern more definitively and to improve measurements of the three angles to more precise values so that different theoretical models can be tested .",
    "for example it has been noted that if the present upper limit on the angle @xmath8 drops by one order of magnitude , a lot of very interesting models for neutrino masses will be ruled out . of course",
    "more models being ruled out makes the direction of physics beyond the standard model that much more clear .",
    "it is therefore important to extract the predictions of the various models as far as possible to narrow the choices .",
    "one of the very intriguing mass patterns for neutrinos is the inverted pattern , where the two heavier neutrinos are split by the solar mass difference @xmath9 , whereas their absolute mass value is the square root of the atmospheric mass difference square i.e. @xmath10 . in the extreme limit where @xmath11",
    ", this mass matrix admits an @xmath12 symmetry .",
    "if this pattern is confirmed by experiments , the existence of the @xmath12 symmetry could provide a clue to new local symmetries that operate at the higher scales where neutrino masses arise .",
    "in two recent papers@xcite , it was shown that if there is a leptonic @xmath4 horizontal symmetry@xcite acting both on the left as well as the right handed leptons of the standard model , then the theory must have two right handed neutrinos to cancel the global @xmath4 witten anomaly .",
    "this provides a rationale for the existence of the right handed neutrino needed for implementing the seesaw mechanism .",
    "this leads to a @xmath3 seesaw formula for neutrino masses .",
    "the resulting neutrino mass matrix naturally leads to an inverted mass pattern for the light neutrinos after seesaw mechanism@xcite and in a certain areas of the parameter space gives rise to an approximate @xmath12 symmetry@xcite of the neutrino mass matrix .",
    "thus if the inverted mass pattern for neutrinos is confirmed by experiments , the @xmath4 models must be given very serious consideration .",
    "as discussed in ref.@xcite , there are two possible patterns for the charged lepton mass matrix in these models and since the pmns mixing matrix gets contributions both from the charged lepton as well as the neutrino sector , there will be two sets of predictions for the neutrino mixings . in this paper , we focus on them separately and study their physical implications , especially their predictions for lepton flavor violating branching ratios @xmath0 and @xmath13 .",
    "the key point is that below the horizontal symmetry scale , the theory is the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) and as is well known@xcite , the presence of lepton mixings leads to mixings between sleptons via the renormalization group evolution even though at the gut scale all slepton masses being equal forbid any such mixings .",
    "these in turn lead to lepton flavor violating decays such as @xmath0 and @xmath13 through one loop graphs involving the gauginos .",
    "in order to arrive at our result , we first fix the model parameters such that they lead to observed neutrino mixings .",
    "we then find that for both the models referred to above , in most of the allowed parameter space for mssm , the @xmath0 is around @xmath14 , which is within the range of the next generation of experiments@xcite .",
    "the constraints on the supersymmetry parameter space come not only from the collider searches for supersymmetry and the lep bound on higgs boson mass but also from the brookhaven g-2 results as well as the wmap dark matter constraints@xcite .",
    "the last constraint arises from the lightest neutralino @xmath15 as the dark matter candidate and using the recent wmap results for the dark matter content of the universe i.e. @xmath16 ( 2@xmath17 ) . in deriving these results ,",
    "some assumptions are needed for supersymmetry breaking parameters of the model .",
    "we use the msugra choice@xcite at the gut scale to obtain the constraints i.e. universal mass for superpartners , common gaugino mass and @xmath18-terms being proportional to the yukawa couplings .",
    "it is important that the gut scale is higher than the seesaw scale to get sizable flavor mixing effects .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "2 , we briefly review the salient features of the @xmath4 models and write down the @xmath3 seesaw formulae for the neutrino masses and mixings as well as the charged lepton mass matrices .",
    "we also present the exact neutrino mixing matrices in the limit of zero electron masses . in sec . 3",
    ", we present the numerical analysis of the neutrino mixings and masses and write down the choices of the model parameters that are phenomenologically acceptable . in sec . 4",
    ", we discuss the predictions for lepton flavor violating branching ratios in the model for these choices of parameters . in sec .",
    "5 , we conclude with a summary of the results .",
    "we consider extensions of the mssm where the gauge group extended to @xmath19 above the seesaw scale . below the seesaw scale",
    "the model is mssm so that the usual results for gauge coupling unification and electrweak symmetry breaking hold .",
    "the basic motivation for considering these models is to find a symmetry rationale for the existence of right handed neutrino othet than the fact that it is needed to implement the seesaw mechanism .",
    "an elegant extension of the standard model that brings in the right handed neutrino automatically is to include the local b - l symmetry in the theory i.e. theories based on the gauge group @xmath20 or @xmath21 or the gut group so(10 ) . since our understanding of neutrino physics is not complete , it is important to explore other possibilities .",
    "a different possibility is to look for horizontal ( or family ) symmetries that arise in the standard model in the limit of vanishing fermion masses . to see the possibilities ,",
    "let us work with the extension of the standard model based on the gauge group @xmath22 , where @xmath23 actos on the different generations .",
    "three interesting possibilities that provide independent motivations for the existence of right handed neutrinos are : ( i ) @xmath24@xcite ; ( ii ) @xmath25 @xciteand ( iii ) @xmath26@xcite with the obvious choice of fermion assignments . here",
    "we will work with the case ( iii ) where we assume that the quark superfields transform under the @xmath27 group as singlets and leptons as doublets . in this case",
    ", it was noted in @xcite that while this model is free of local anomalies , absence of global witten anomalies@xcite implies that one must add two right handed neutrinos to the theory .",
    "thus the existence of the right handed neutrinos are required for the consistency of the theory and not just to implement the seesaw mechanism .",
    "this is the model we want to study in detail in this paper .",
    "the assignment of the leptons and higgs superfields under the gauge group @xmath28 is given as follows :    * table i *    [ cols=\"^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     * table caption : * we display the quantum number of the matter and higgs superfields of our model .    here",
    "@xmath29 denote the left handed lepton doublet superfields .",
    "we arrange the higgs potential in such a way that the @xmath4 symmetry is broken by @xmath30 and @xmath31 , where @xmath32 .",
    "the vevs for @xmath33 are chosen so as to cancel the d - terms and leave supersymmetry unbroken below the scale @xmath34 .",
    "note that we have used the @xmath4 symmetry to align the @xmath35 vev along the @xmath36 direction . at the weak scale ,",
    "all the neutral components of the fields @xmath37 and @xmath38 acquire nonzero vev s and break the standard model symmetry down to @xmath39 .",
    "we denote these vev s as follows : @xmath40 and @xmath41 ; clearly @xmath42 has values in the 100 gev range depending on the value of @xmath43 .",
    "note that @xmath44 breaks the @xmath4 group down to the @xmath45 group which is further broken down by the @xmath46 vevs .",
    "since the renormalizable yukawa interactions do not involve the @xmath46 field , this symmetry ( @xmath47 ) is also reflected in the right handed neutrino mass matrix .",
    "this turns out to play a crucial role in leading to a bimaximal mixing pattern .    to discuss the detailed leptonic mixings , we now write down the yukawa superpotential of the theory .",
    "the two models we discuss arise from the two ways the horizontal doublets couple to fermion superfields . in one case",
    ", we will allow only the @xmath46 field to couple to all fermions ( to be called model i ) and in the second case , we will allow the @xmath46 to couple to the right handed neutrino sector only and @xmath48 to couple to the charged leptons only .",
    "this will be called model ii .",
    "the yukawa superpotential for this model is given by : @xmath49 this can be made natural by a choice of the discrete @xmath50 symmetry under which @xmath51 is odd and all other fields even , so that it does not couple to matter fields in the superpotential .",
    "@xmath52 directly leads to the @xmath47 invariant @xmath53 mass matrix at the seesaw scale , as already noted .",
    "the @xmath46 vev contributes to this mass matrix only through nonrenormalizable operators and we assume those contributions to be negligible .",
    "we also do not include any term where @xmath35 couples to light fields .",
    "since the theory is supersymmetric , any term omitted from the superpotential will not be induced by loops due to the non - renormalization theorem .",
    "similarly there will also be some small contributions from the @xmath54 sector if we did not decouple it completely .",
    "we ignore these contributions in our analysis .",
    "further , we define @xmath55 gev .    to study neutrino mixings in this model , let us write down the @xmath56 mass matrix for neutrinos : @xmath57 this is a @xmath3 seesaw matrix@xcite and after seesaw diagonalization , it leads to a @xmath58 light neutrino mass matrix as follows : @xmath59 where @xmath60 ; @xmath61 .",
    "the resulting light majorana neutrino mass matrix @xmath62 is given by : @xmath63 to get the physical neutrino mixings , we also need the charged lepton mass matrix defined by @xmath64 . this is where the difference between the two models appear .    in model",
    "i , the charged lepton mass matrix is given by @xmath65 in order to study physical neutrino mixings , we must diagonalize the @xmath62 and @xmath66 matrices . in ref.@xcite , we diagonalized the neutrino mass matrix analytically in the limit @xmath67 .",
    "let us discuss it for completeness .",
    "since @xmath68 is proportional to the electron mass , we will ignore temporarily .",
    "then , defining the matrices that diagonalize the charged lepton mass matrix as @xmath69 , we get @xmath70 where two angles @xmath71 are given by : @xmath72 and @xmath73 and we have ignored terms of order @xmath74 . similarly the matrix that diagonalizes @xmath62 is given by @xmath75 where @xmath76 with @xmath77 given by @xmath78 .",
    "the pmns matrix that is measured in neutrino oscillation is given by @xmath79 and has the form , in the limit of @xmath67 : @xmath80 using this , it was concluded in @xcite that there is an approximate relation between the neutrino parameters given by : @xmath81 it is clear from the above equation that for a given value of @xmath82 , the smallest value of @xmath83 will happen for the largest value of @xmath84 . in this paper",
    "first we numerically solve for the neutrino mixings and then proceed to calculate the lepton flavor violation effects for the allowed choices of the parameters of the model .      in this case , we impose a discrete symmetry under which the fields @xmath85 and @xmath48 are odd and all othee fields are even .",

    "we will discuss the detailed numerical predictions in the next section .",
    "the expressions for the dirac neutrino matrix and the charged lepton matrix are given in the previous section .",
    "we will use those expressions in order to derive the light neutrino masses and the mixing angles numerically . that will fix the model parameters that will go into the renormalization group evolution of the slepton masses .",
    "we will generate the fit for different values of @xmath95 and model parameters .",
    "for example , at @xmath96 , the charged lepton mass matrix is given by ( at the scale where the horizontal symmetry gets broken ) : @xmath97 this matrix needs @xmath98 , @xmath99 , @xmath100 and @xmath101 with @xmath102 and @xmath103 .",
    "we get the correct values of charged lepton masses at the weak scale from the above matrix .",

    "the range of @xmath83 is 0.07 - 0.13 in this model and is allowed by the current experimental upper bound 0.22@xcite .",
    "in fact , it is expected that the planned long base line experiments including minos have the ability to probe this range in the next few years .",
    "the scale of the horizontal symmetry breaking is assumed to be @xmath121 and the magnitude of the majorana coupling is @xmath122 . the fit does not change if we move the scale up or down .",

    "the atmospheric mixing angle @xmath145 is 0.98 and is well allowed by the experimental results .",
    "the prediction for @xmath146 and it will also be probed in the near future .    in the following",
    ", the scale of horizontal symmetry breaking our calculations is assumed to be @xmath147 and the magnitude of the majorana coupling is @xmath148 .",
    "it is well known that in the standard model where neutrino masses vanish , there is no lepton flavor violation .",
    "once the neutrinos have masses as well as mixings , there are small amounts of lepton flavor violation leading to processes such as @xmath149 with @xmath150 . however , if only a dirac mass ( by adding a right handed neutrino ) or a majorana mass ( by adding a higgs triplet ) of the neutrino are added to the standard model , then lepton flavor violating processes which always arise at one loop or higher loop level in gauge theories have branching ratios proportional to @xmath151 and are therefore very tiny . in models with supersymmetry however , the situation can change drastically . in the presence of neutrino masses , the superpartners of leptons",
    "could in general mix and the lfv branching ratio in that case becomes of order@xmath152 where @xmath153 is a typical mass of the slepton and since the slepton masses are expected to be of order of the weak scale , the lfv branching ratios in general can be quite large .",
    "the actual magnitude however depends on the specific model for neutrino masses as well as on the pattern of supersymmetry breaking .",
    "if we assume the neutrino masses to arise from the seesaw mechanism , then depending on how the seesaw mechanism is implemented in a theory , the predictions for lfv can be different .",
    "similarly , the nature of supersymmetry breaking is also important since in the supersymmetric limit the radiative flavor changing decays vanish . to illustrate this point ,",
    "let us consider a simple seesaw model where the susy breaking slepton masses are universal at the seesaw scale and the susy breaking @xmath18 terms are proportional to yukawa couplings as in the minimal sugra models .",
    "we can go to a basis where the charged lepton yukawa couplings are diagonal .",
    "this simply rotates the neutrino mass matrix and keeps all other terms in the lagrangian flavor in such a theory , just below the seesaw scale , flavor mixing is present only in the neutrino masses from the seesaw formula .",
    "as we extrapolate the slepton masses down to the seesaw scale , they remain diagonal since the charged lepton yukawa coupling is diagonal .",
    "the only source of lepton flavor violation is then in the neutrino masses .",
    "therefore , in this case @xmath154 and is therefore negligible . to obtain a significant lfv effect therefore",
    ", one must assume that the universality of slepton masses and the proportionality of the @xmath18 terms must hold much above the seesaw scale .",
    "fortunately , this is what is generally assumed in minimal sugra models anyway .",
    "thus no observable lfv effect would simply be a manifestation of the fact that it is the seesaw scale where universality of slepton masses holds e.g. in models like gauge mediated supersymmetry breaking . in this paper",
    ", we will assume that the universality of scalar masses holds at a scale higher than the seesaw scale .",
    "turning to our case , since we only have an su(2 ) horizontal symmetry , we can dispense with any assumption regarding universality and allow for the most general susy breaking pattern consistent with the @xmath4 symmetry .",
    "for definiteness , we will assume universality of scalar masses at a higher scale ( e.g. the gut scale ) and use rge effects of the lepton yukawa couplings to get the slapton masses and the @xmath18 terms at the @xmath34 scale .",
    "this is a non - universal profile at the seesaw scale and leads to @xmath155 as a function of the yukawa couplings .",
    "if we then rotate i.e. @xmath156 and @xmath157 . if we now rotate the charged lepton yukawas just below the horizontal symmetry scale to go to a diagonal basis for charged lepton yukawa couplings , we will generate slepton flavor mixings such as @xmath158 and @xmath159 .",
    "a combination of these two terms at the weak scale will give rise to a nonvanishing branching ratio for @xmath160 and @xmath161 .",
    "if we focus the slepton masses alone , we roughly get @xmath162 one can also in a similar manner estimate the contribution of the @xmath18 terms .",
    "in fact it turns out that it is the @xmath18-term slepton mixings that make the dominant contribution to the lfv branching ratios in our model .    to proceed with the calculations for lfv processes in our case , we will use msugra models which has five parameters at the gut scale i.e. @xmath163 , @xmath164 , @xmath165 , @xmath95 and @xmath166@xcite .",
    "we will assume that at the gut scale all scalar masses have the common value @xmath163 as noted in the previous section ; gauginos have the common mass @xmath164 ; the trilinear susy breaking terms are proportional to the yukawa couplings and the rest of the theory is defined by the the superpotentials in section ii . first note that the renormalization group evolution ( rge ) is caused only by dimension four terms in the lagrangian .",
    "the charged lepton yukawa matrix responsible for the rge from the gut scale to the weak scale is diagonal since the only dimension four yukawa couplings are @xmath167 .",
    "similarly , the dimension 4 dirac neutrino couplings are also flavor diagonal with the yukawa coupling @xmath168 .",
    "thus as we run down from the gut scale to the horizontal symmetry breaking scale @xmath34 , the slepton masses remain horizontal ; the @xmath18 terms get modified .",
    "the rge from the @xmath34 scale down to the weak scale is the mssm rge .",
    "we generate the off diagonal elements of the charged lepton yukawa matrix at the horizontal scale from the nonrenormalizable operators and dirac neutrino matrix becomes a @xmath169 matrix .",
    "the off diagonal elements of the charged lepton mass matrix induce the flavor violating terms in the @xmath170 , @xmath171 and @xmath172 mass matrices via the rges from the horizontal scale down to the weak scale .",
    "for example , @xmath173 term ( which contributes to @xmath171 ) gets generated via terms @xmath174 , @xmath175 pieces in the rge ( @xmath176@xmath177 , where @xmath178 is the @xmath58 matrix for the dirac yukawa coupling ) .",

    "in summary , we have analysed two models with local su(2 ) horizontal symmetry that lead naturally to bi - large mixing pattern for neutrinos .",
    "we determined the parameters of these models from the detailed numerical fit to the neutrino masses and the mixing angles . using these models",
    "we then obtained predictions for lepton flavor violating decays br[@xmath181 ] in msugra framework .",
    "the parmeter space , we consider , is constrained by the following experimental constraints : br[@xmath183 ] , higgs mass and the recent relic density results from wmap and the brookheven g-2 experiment .",
    "we find that , in both models , the branching ratio is large in a large region of parameter space and is in the range accessible to the current round of searches for this process .",
    "this parameter space can simultaneously be explored at tevatron , lhc and the upcoming of dark matter detectors .",
