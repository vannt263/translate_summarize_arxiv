    "the attractions are obvious : by coarse graining over the atomistic degrees of freedom one can access the relevant length and time scales with only modest computing requirements .",
    "polymer phase behaviour @xcite , polymer dynamics @xcite , polymer rheology @xcite , surfactant mesophase formation kinetics @xcite , the properties of amphiphilic bilayers @xcite , and the properties of colloidal suspensions @xcite have all been investigated by the method .    charged systems such as anionic and cationic surfactants , water - soluble polyelectrolytes , charge - stabilised colloidal suspensions , and mixtures of these @xcite , form a large subclass of widespread practical importance . in these systems",
    "there is often the requirement to model the supporting electrolyte .",
    "this can be done implicitly , for example with the poisson - boltzmann equation , or explictly by incorporating ions as charged particles in the simulation . in the latter case , particularly for dpd where soft interactions are the norm",
    ", it is natural to smear the point charges into charge clouds .",
    "the divergence of the long - range coulomb law as @xmath0 ( where @xmath1 is the center - center separation ) is replaced by a smooth cutoff , thus ensuring thermodynamic stability according to a theorem by fisher and ruelle @xcite .",
    "the precise form of the charge smearing is often tuned to the choice of numerical algorithm and a consensus on the best approach has yet to emerge .",
    "groot introduced a grid - based method with linear charge smearing @xcite .",
    "later gonzlez - melchor _ et al .",
    "_  examined an ewald - based method with exponential charge smearing @xcite . here",
    "we study a related ewald method with gaussian charge smearing .",
    "this choice can be used to simplify the ewald algorithm , and connects with recent work on the so - called ultrasoft restricted primitive model ( urpm ) @xcite . in principle",
    "the differences between smearing methods can be subsumed into short - range part of the interparticle potential , though the details are the subject of ongoing investigations .",
    "to study the screening properties of our gaussian electrolyte model , we use a combination of monte - carlo ( mc ) simulations , the hyper - netted chain ( hnc ) integral equation closure , and the random phase approximation ( rpa ) , to analyse the asymptotic behaviour of the pair distribution functions .",
    "the programme is as follows . in the next two sections we define the mesoscale electrolyte model and the tools used to analyse it .",
    "we then present results demonstrating that , for typical applications , hnc can be relied upon to deliver accurate results ( it is no exaggeration to say that hnc is up to ten million times faster than mc ) .",
    "we then use hnc to explore the screening properties of the model , establishing the conditions under which a screening length is well defined ( _ i.e. _  on the low density side of a kirkwood line in the phase diagram ) and the extent to which the screening length matches the expected debye length",
    ". we further establish the domain of applicability of the much simpler rpa , which gives relatively simple expressions for the kirkwood line and the screening length .",
    "we emphasise that our approach could easily be applied to other smeared charge electrolyte models .",
    "mindful of this , and the utility of a fast , accurate , multicomponent hnc solver in general , we have released our fortran 90 hnc code as fully documented open source software @xcite .",
    "we now describe the gaussian charge model for electrolyte solutions . the potential energy is given by a sum of pairwise terms , split into short range and long range ( electrostatic ) contributions , @xmath2 the short range piece",

    "the short range part of the potential corresponds to the standard dpd interaction law @xcite .",
    "the long range part corresponds to the interaction between gaussian smeared charges with a radial charge distribution @xmath17 .",
    "the function @xmath18 as @xmath0 , thus ensuring the coulombic divergence is replaced by a smooth cutoff .",
    "we will consider up to three species of particles , corresponding to positively and negatively charged ions of valencies @xmath19 and @xmath20 at densities @xmath21 and @xmath22 , and a third neutral solvent species at a density @xmath23 .",
    "the total _ ion _ density will be denoted by @xmath24 .",
    "the total _ overall _ density will be denoted by @xmath25 . in the case where there is no solvent , @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "we adopt the convention that the valency includes the sign as well as the magnitude .",
    "overall charge neutrality then requires @xmath28 .",
    "we do not necessarily suppose the valencies are of the same magnitude .",
    "we shall label species by greek indices , @xmath29 .",
    "the system volume is @xmath30 and thermal averages will be denoted by @xmath31 .",
    "we first consider a special case .",
    "the aforementioned urpm is an unsolvated equimolar mixture of gaussian charge clouds , corresponding to the choice @xmath32 , @xmath26 , and @xmath33 .",
    "the urpm is governed by a dimensionless density , @xmath34 , and a dimensionless coupling constant , @xmath35 , which plays the role of an inverse temperature .",
    "the model exhibits marked clustering for @xmath36 , and a condensation transition for @xmath37 , for densities in the range @xmath380.1 ( these estimates are translated from the results shown in fig .  5 in ref .  ) .",
    "the physics behind the phase transition remains somewhat unclear @xcite , but the phenomenology can be viewed as a reflection of stability issue for point charges mentioned in the introduction .",
    "it quantifies the onset of the ` danger zone ' as the point charge limit is approached . to avoid these artefacts",
    "the implication is that we should attempt to keep @xmath39 .",
    "however for practical applications there is already a strong incentive to make @xmath16 as large as possible , to reduce the cost of computing the electrostatic interactions .",
    "usually this is enough to ensure that low temperature urpm artefacts are avoided .    in the general case",
    "the properties of the model are governed by three length scales , @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath12 , the repulsion amplitude matrix @xmath11 , the choice of valencies @xmath40 , and the densities @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "the parameter space is thus potentially very large .",
    "our strategy to reduce the complexity is to consider the mapping to the underlying atomistic system .",
    "this requires us to distinguish between _ physical _ units in which the length scales and densities are expressed in si units ; and _ simulation _ units in which length scales and densities are expressed in units of @xmath15 or @xmath16 .    in standard dpd the choice @xmath43 is usually made @xcite , and we will adopt the same here .",
    "in addition one usually introduces the notion of a ` mapping number ' @xmath44 , giving the number of solvent molecules represented by one dpd solvent particle . given this ,",
    "the value of @xmath15 in physical units is determined by the identity @xmath45 , where @xmath46 is the solvent molar volume and @xmath47 is avogadro s number @xcite . if water is the solvent ( @xmath48 ) , and with the conventional choice @xmath49 , one has in physical units @xmath50 .",
    "next consider the bjerrum length .",
    "in physical units this is @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the elementary charge , @xmath53 is the relative permittivity of the solvent , and @xmath54 is the permittivity of free space . for water at room temperature @xmath55 . since a @xmath56:@xmath56 electrolyte is equivalent to a 1:1 electrolyte with @xmath12 increased by a factor @xmath57 , there is considerable interest in exploring higher values of @xmath12 . in the present work we shall explore up to @xmath58 ( @xmath59 in physical units ) , which covers many cases of interest .    for an electrolyte at a molar concentration @xmath60 , the microscopic ion density is @xmath61 .",
    "this is readily converted to a simulation density by multiplying by @xmath62 .",
    "for example a @xmath63 1:1 electrolyte solution would be represented by @xmath64 ( note that @xmath65 counts both species of ion ) . to cover the typical range of electrolyte concentrations we therefore consider @xmath66 in the range @xmath671 .",
    "the above considerations do not yet impinge on the choice of @xmath16 .",
    "this is a central theme of the present study and will be discussed extensively below .",
    "finally we discuss the repulsion amplitude matrix . in the present study we will only consider a constant repulsion amplitude matrix @xmath68 , leaving the extension to unequal repulsion amplitudes for future work .",
    "we use either @xmath69 motivated by standard dpd @xcite , or @xmath70 corresponding to the situation in the absence of short range repulsions . in the latter case , of course , it does not make sense to include the neutral solvent species since it would just form an ideal gas in the background .",
    "it has been suggested that @xmath71 should be chosen to match the solvent compressibility @xcite .",
    "however this introduces the danger if @xmath71 is too large one will encounter an order - disorder transition driven by the short range repulsions .",
    "a less rigorous criterion is to demand only that the solvent be relatively incompressible , so that @xmath72 where @xmath73 is the pressure .",
    "this is satisfied by @xmath69 , for which the solvent is clearly still a liquid with only moderate structure .",
    "moreover much work has been done based on this value , which we will therefore continue to use .",
    "to summarise , in the remainder of this work we shall consider mainly two classes of models : either the pure urpm comprising unsolvated gaussian charges , or the ` solvated ' case containing in addition a neutral species and short range repulsions between all particles .",
    "( it is possible to consider an intermediate case where short range repulsions are added to the urpm , however this does not generate any new insights . )",
    "as already mentioned the urpm is characterised by the dimensionless density @xmath74 ( with @xmath33 implying @xmath75 ) and coupling strength @xmath35 .",
    "the length scale @xmath15 plays no role , except , perhaps , as a ` fiducial ' length . on the other hand the solvated case ( with the ` standard ' choice @xmath76 and @xmath69 ) is characterised by the dimensionless densities @xmath77 , and dimensionless ratios @xmath78 and @xmath79 , where all except @xmath79 are fixed by the mapping to the underlying physical system .    from a practical point of view",
    "@xmath80 is commonplace , and it shall be important to pay attention to the units of length when mapping between the solvated case and the pure urpm . in the text we shall endeavour to be always explicit about this , and where the figure annotations use implicit units we shall always state the choice of units in the caption .",
    "a symmetric @xmath56:@xmath56 electrolyte in the solvated case can be mapped to the urpm with a renormalised @xmath81 .",
    "an asymmetric electrolyte can not be mapped onto the urpm but we shall discuss this case only rather briefly .",
    "it is worth bearing in mind that it is quite straightforward to apply the tools developed here to _ all _ these cases .",
    "given the model is governed solely by pair interactions , the thermodynamic properties are completely determined by the pair distribution functions @xmath82 . in addition the screening properties are also determined by the asymptotic behaviour of these functions .",
    "specifically , the screening length @xmath83 features in the asymptotic behaviour of the total correlation functions , @xmath84 _ provided _ the asymptotic decay is purely exponential .",
    "the decay length defined in this way is unique to each state point and does not depend on the identity of the species of charged particles under consideration .",
    "as the density decreases the screening length approaches the debye - hckel limiting law behaviour , @xmath85 , where the debye length is @xmath86 conversely , as the density increases the screening length gets smaller but there comes a point where the asymptotic decay of the total correlation functions ceases to be purely exponential and instead becomes damped oscillatory .",
    "this transition defines a line in the phase diagram known in charged systems as the kirkwood line @xcite , or more generally a fisher - widom line @xcite .    for applications , one would hope that the actual screening length will hew as closely as possible to the expected debye length ( at least , as long as the latter is well defined ) .",
    "the extent to which this can be made so is the central theme of the present work .",
    "for example , a 1:1 electrolyte at @xmath63 concentration has a debye length @xmath87 . if we simulate this in the present model with the choice @xmath88 , the asymptotic decay of the total correlation functions would be _ oscillatory _ and we would not even be on the right side of the kirkwood line .",
    "on the other hand if we use @xmath89 the asymptotic decay would be purely exponential with @xmath90 , thus the actual screening length would be only 6% different from the debye length .",
    "this example will be worked through in more detail below .      given that the underlying electrolyte model is a fluid mixture , it is natural to think of using multicomponent integral equation theory to calculate the structural and thermodynamic properties @xcite .",
    "further , since the interactions are soft , one expects that the hyper - netted chain ( hnc ) integral equation closure should work well .",
    "we find this is indeed the case .",
    "we also find that for parameters typical of 1:1 electrolytes , the random phase approximation ( rpa ) also works well .",
    "the starting point is the multicomponent ornstein - zernike ( oz ) relation which defines the direct correlation functions @xmath91 . in reciprocal space",
    "the oz relation is @xmath92 where the spatial fourier transform of a function @xmath93 is defined by @xmath94 .",
    "the hnc closure is defined in real space , and is @xmath95 where @xmath96 is the pair potential between particles of species @xmath97 and @xmath98 .",
    "the solution of these coupled equations is numerically quite demanding and in the present case we exploit the accelerated convergence schemes originally proposed by ng @xcite .",
    "we typically solve the distribution functions on a grid of size 4096 points at a grid spacing @xmath99 , so that the functions are calculated out to @xmath100 where all trace of structure has typically vanished below the numerical precision of the calculation .",
    "we find , however , that the schemes fail to converge for @xmath101 .",
    "this loss of solution has also been observed by coslovich , hansen and kahl @xcite , and may be indicative of a mathematical property of the hnc rather than a numerical problem .",
    "numerically much less demanding is the rpa closure , which is given by @xmath102 because there are no hard cores , the rpa is the same as the mean spherical approximation ( msa ) . unlike the hnc , the rpa can be solved for all values of @xmath35 although it may yield unphysical results ( for example @xmath103 ) .",
    "the pressure @xmath73 and the internal energy density @xmath104 , can be solved from the pair functions @xcite .",
    "the pressure can be found either by the virial or compressibility routes .",
    "these do not give exactly the same result because the hnc closure breaks thermodynamic consistency .",
    "in practice , for the present applications , we have found the two routes differ by typically at most a few percent .",
    "specific results for the rpa thermodynamics can be found in refs .   and  .",
    "coslovich , hansen and kahl solve the rpa for the urpm @xcite , and we have recently revisited the problem in terms of the low temperature phase behaviour @xcite .",
    "the relevant properties of the rpa solution are described here .",
    "urpm symmetry implies that in the rpa the correlation functions are given by @xmath105 .",
    "inserting this into the oz equations , with the rpa closure , reveals @xmath106 where @xmath107 is the square of the debye wavevector ( _ i.e. _  @xmath108 ) .",
    "the real space total correlation functions can ( in principle ) be obtained by expressing the fourier back - transform of eq .   as a contour integral in the complex @xmath109-plane .",
    "the behaviour of the correlation functions is therefore determined by the poles of @xmath110 in the upper half plane . as a particular consequence",
    ", the asymptotic behaviour of @xmath111 as @xmath112 is determined by the position(s ) of the pole(s ) closest to the real axis @xcite .",
    "there are two cases .",
    "if the nearest pole to the real axis is purely imaginary , the asymptotic behaviour of @xmath111 is purely exponential , with a decay length set by the distance of the pole from the real axis .",
    "alternatively if the nearest poles to the real axis are complex , the asymptotic behaviour is damped oscillatory .",
    "clearly , then , the kirkwood line is determined by the crossover between these two scenarios , typically when a purely imaginary pole nearest to the real axis collides with the next - nearest pole , to form a complex pair which subsequently move off the imaginary axis .    in the present case , writing @xmath113 and @xmath114 ,",
    "the poles of @xmath115 are determined by the solutions of @xmath116 these solutions can be expressed in terms of the lambert @xmath117 function which solves @xmath118 .",
    "for the asymptotic behaviour of @xmath111 the most relevant solution is given by @xmath119 where @xmath120 is the principal branch of the lambert @xmath117 function @xcite . if @xmath121 , @xmath122 is negative real and the corresponding poles of eq .",
    "( in the complex @xmath123-plane ) are at @xmath124 note that @xmath125 ( from below ) as @xmath126 . if @xmath127 , @xmath122 is complex and the asymptotic decay of @xmath111 is damped oscillatory .",
    "we therefore identify @xmath128 as the kirkwood line @xcite .",
    "equivalently , eq .   requires @xmath129 with equality determining the location of the rpa kirkwood line . for general applications the charge density in eqs .   and",
    "should be taken to be the ionic strength , defined by @xmath130 .",
    "the rpa can of course be solved for the solvated urpm case .",
    "we leave discussion of this to a separate publication .      we benchmark hnc against mc simulations .",
    "we use an @xmath131 ensemble with standard single particle trial displacements in the usual metropolis scheme @xcite .",
    "we calculate the energy of a configuration from @xmath132 , where @xmath133 from eq .  , and @xmath134 from eq .",
    "the latter is re - expressed as an ewald sum , @xmath135 where @xmath136 , and @xmath137 is the reciprocal space charge density .",
    "this is just the standard ewald result omitting the real space contribution @xcite .",
    "the last term is a self energy correction ; this can of course be omitted from the mc acceptance criterion , but it is essential to retain this correction when making comparisons with integral equation theory .    the first term in eq .",
    "is a sum over a discrete set of wavevectors , commensurate with the simulation box dimensions , such that @xmath138 where the cut - off is chosen so that @xmath139 is sufficiently small . for the simulations reported below we use @xmath140 .",
    "there are about @xmath141 discrete wavevectors in the sum ( the second factor is the density of wavevectors in reciprocal space ) .",
    "this means that the computational cost of evaluating the sum varies as @xmath142 . as a practical consideration , this is a strong motivation for making @xmath16 as large as possible .",
    "the only other point to make about the ewald implementation concerns the calculation of the pressure , @xmath143 \\displaystyle { } \\hspace{3em}+\\frac{2\\pi{l_{\\mathrm{b}}}}{3v^2}\\bigl\\langle\\sum_{k\\le k_c } \\!\\ !",

    "the third term follows from eq .   by calculating @xmath144 @xcite .",

    "the calculations are shown in the numbered rows in table [ tab : eg ] .",
    "we start from the standard dpd mapping with @xmath187 and @xmath188 .",
    "this gives @xmath189 ( row 1 ) .",
    "if the molar concentration of a 1:1 electrolyte is @xmath60 , then @xmath190 ( row 2 ; the factor two accounts for both species of ion ) . the debye length ( row 3 ) follows from eq .",
    ", here in the form @xmath191 .",
    "alternatively one can use the well known expression @xmath192 from the colloidal literature @xcite .",
    "we choose a value for @xmath16 ( row 4 ) and calculate the left hand side of the inequality in eq .",
    "( row 6 ) . for the choice @xmath89 , eq .   is satisfied and we are on the low density side of the kirkwood line .",
    "we can then use the value of the lambert function ( row 7 ) to calculate @xmath193 ( row 8) from eq .  .",
    "given that @xmath178 ( row 5 ) , this should be a good estimate of the true screening length . as claimed in section [ sec : ie ] , the answer deviates from the debye length by only 6% ( row 9 ) . for the choice @xmath88",
    "though , eq .   is violated ( row 6 ) , and we are on the high density side of the kirkwood line .",
    "this is also indicated by the fact that the lambert function ( row 7 ) evaluates to a complex number .",
    "as we have seen , a mapping to a physical system fixes @xmath12 and @xmath15 , but the choice of @xmath16 remains unresolved .",
    "our study so far reveals this choice is a balance of conflicting requirements . on the one hand we would like to increase @xmath16 as much as possible , mainly because this reduces the cost of computing the electrostatic interactions in a simulation . on the other hand",
    "if @xmath16 is too large we run the risk of deviating strongly from the expected screening properties of the physical system , and may ultimately cross the kirkwood line in fig .",
    "[ fig : kirkwood ] .",
    "such behaviour is almost certain to be artefactual since the chances of coinciding with similar behaviour in the physical system seem remote .",
    "for example for a 1:1 aqueous electrolyte we can plot the ratio @xmath194 as a function of salt concentration @xmath60 , using the method just described in section [ sec : eg ] .",
    "[ fig : csmap ] shows just such a plot , for three choices of @xmath79 .",
    "inspection suggests as sensible compromise might be @xmath195 , since this restricts significant deviations from the debye length ( _ i.e. _  more than 10% ) to @xmath196 , where in any case the debye length is starting to become comparable to @xmath15 .",
    "let us close with some more remarks about implementation , and indicate avenues for future work .",
    "first , let us dispose of an elementary point .",
    "the simulations described here have been performed using mc , rather than dpd .",
    "the reason for this is that we are interested in equilibrium properties , and mc is free from issues such as the choice of integration algorithm and time step @xcite .",
    "nevertheless the ewald method can easily be applied to a dynamical simulation , by calculating the forces that arise from the potential energy in eq .  .",
    "the usual ewald implementation for point charges introduces a ` splitting parameter ' so that part of the interaction is calculated in real space and part in reciprocal space @xcite .",
    "here we have ` physical - ised ' the splitting parameter by linking it to the gaussian charge size @xmath16 , so that we can discard the real - space interaction .",
    "this may not always be the best choice , since one can not then optimise the splitting parameter to match the simulation box size @xcite .",
    "however coslovich _ et al . _",
    "found that there is practically no benefit in divorcing the splitting parameter from the gaussian charge size , at least for the urpm for their parameter ranges .",
    "nevertheless it is worth bearing in mind this possibility , particularly if @xmath16 is much smaller than the simulation box size .    aside from standard ewald , any existing molecular dynamics ( md ) method",
    "could be used in principle to calculate electrostatic interactions in dpd .",
    "most notable are the p3 m ( particle - particle - particle - mesh ) methods , such as that introduced by groot @xcite , and hybrids such as smooth particle mesh ewald @xcite .",
    "some of these methods are highly parallelisable @xcite , or highly efficient in other ways @xcite .",
    "these md methods are typically developed for point charges , but the application to smeared charges should involve a straightforward extension to the underlying algorithms .    as mentioned in the introduction , there is no consensus on the best form of charge smearing ( linear , exponential , gaussian , _ etc . _ ) , nor , perhaps , does there need to be .",
    "all smearing methods generate pair potentials which may differ in the short range part , but share a common @xmath197 dependence for large @xmath1 .",
    "this raises the question of whether the methods can be mapped on to one another , _ vis  vis _ the screening properties .",
    "related to this is our observation that short range repulsions have practically no effect on the screening properties . whilst this is a great bonus for applications",
    ", it can not hold generally , for it would imply that there should be negligible effect of the choice of smearing .",
    "but we know this is manifestly untrue : two gaussian charge models with @xmath198 do not have the same screening properties . more generally ,",
    "in any smeared charge model , another length scale must be present to non - dimensionalise @xmath12 .",
    "the question of how to determine this length scale remains unsolved .",
    "our present results suggest that a systematic use of hnc could give an answer , thus providing a ` rosetta stone ' tying together the existing treatments of dpd electrostatics .",
    "this is the subject of ongoing investigations .",
    "separate from this , a long term goal is to incorporate specific ion effects into the model , such as the hofmeister series @xcite . as mentioned in section [ sec : model ] , we have here focussed on a constant repulsion amplitude matrix @xmath68 .",
    "obviously there is scope to go beyond this , using hnc to calculate both the structural and thermodynamic consequences of unequal repulsion amplitudes .",
    "the hope is that a suitable choice of @xmath11 can be found , which will systematically and transferrably capture specific ion effects .",
    "it is encouraging to note in this respect that a similar programme has been pursued with some success recently , for md @xcite .",
