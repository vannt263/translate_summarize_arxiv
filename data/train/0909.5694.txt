    "the standard picture of inflation introduced in 1981@xcite relied on a scalar field , called the inflaton , which during inflation was assumed to have no interaction with any other field .",
    "the inflationary scenario postulates that the universe underwent a phase of very rapid , accelerated expansion in its distant past .",
    "observations have provided strong support for the paradigm .",
    "standard inflationary scenario is divided into two regimes , slow - rolling expansion and reheating phase .",
    "it is assumed that exponential expansion places the universe in a super - cooled phase and subsequently thereafter the universe is reheated . during the inflationary epoch particles are being continually produced but their density is rapidly diminished by the expansion of the universe . in this scenario the radiation energy density @xmath2 becomes negligible rapidly since it scales inversely with the fourth power of the scale factor .",
    "in such a case , a short time reheating period terminates the inflationary period initiating the radiation dominated epoch .",
    "inflation in presence of non - negligible radiation component is characterized by a non - isentropic expansion .",
    "this can be realized in the warm inflation scenarios@xcite .",
    "what distinguishes warm inflation is that this particle production is sufficiently strong compared with the effects of the expansion , so that it is possible to produce a non - negligible particle density .",
    "warm inflation occurs when the particle number is large enough to influence the classical inflaton field and produce density fluctuations@xcite .",
    "two important facts in warm inflation are that it can provide a graceful exit to the standard inflation dynamics , and can give a physical justification of the slow - rolling conditions , which are incorporated ad hoc in models of standard inflation .    in this paper",
    "we examine the evolution of entropy on a 4d brane from a 5d vacuum state , which is defined on a 5d background riemann - flat metric , using ideas of modern kaluza - klein theory .",
    "this theory allow the fifth coordinate to play an important physical role . in the framework of the induced matter ( or space - time - matter ) theory@xcite , all classical physical quantities , such as matter density and pressure , are susceptible of a geometrical interpretation .",
    "the mathematical basis of it relies in the campbell s theorem@xcite , which ensures an embedding of 4d general relativity with sources in a 5d theory whose field equations are apparently empty .",
    "that is , the einstein equations to @xmath3 and greek letters that run from @xmath4 to @xmath5 . ]",
    "@xmath6 ( we use natural units : @xmath7 ) , are embedded perfectly in the ricci - flat equations @xmath8 . other version of 5d gravity , which is mathematically similar , is the membrane theory , in which gravity propagates freely on the 5d bulk and the interactions of particles are confined to a 4d hypersurface called `` brane''@xcite .",
    "both versions of 5d general relativity are in agreement with observations .",
    "we consider the recently introduced 5d riemann - flat metric@xcite @xmath9 where @xmath10 is a time - dependent function , which can be interpreted as a decaying cosmological parameter under certain circumstances@xcite .",
    "furthermore , @xmath11 is the 3d euclidean metric , @xmath12 is the cosmic time and @xmath13 is the space - like noncompact extra dimension . since the metric ( [ a1 ] ) is riemann - flat ( and therefore ricci - flat ) , hence it is suitable to describe a 5d vacuum vacuum ( @xmath14 ) in the framework of space - time - matter ( stm ) theory of gravity@xcite . with this aim",
    "we shall consider the 5d action @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the determinant of the covariant metric tensor @xmath17 : @xmath18 and @xmath19 is a constant to make dimensionless the expression @xmath20 .    in order to describe a 5d vacuum on ( [ a1 ] )",
    ", we shall consider @xmath21 as a massless test classical scalar field , which is minimally coupled to gravity .",
    "for this reason , the lagrangian related to @xmath21 is purely kinetic and free of any interaction on ( [ a1 ] ) . from the mathematical point of view",
    ", the second term in the action ( [ act ] ) is constructed by using monogenic fields @xmath21 , which have null d'alambertian on the 5d riemann - flat metric ( [ a1])@xcite .",
    "the equation of motion for the field @xmath21 is @xmath22 \\dot\\varphi - \\frac{\\lambda}{3 } e^{-2\\int \\sqrt{\\frac{\\lambda}{3 } } dt } \\nabla^2\\varphi   -   \\frac{\\lambda}{3}\\left[4\\psi \\frac{\\partial\\varphi}{\\partial\\psi } + \\psi^2 \\frac{\\partial^2\\varphi}{\\partial\\psi^2}\\right ] = 0.\\label{dis}\\ ] ] furthermore , since @xmath21 evolves on a riemann - flat spacetime and complies with the einstein equations @xmath23 , ( @xmath24 is the gravitational constant ) , the energy - momentum tensor @xmath25 must be null on ( [ a1 ] ) .    in the next sections we shall study the interpretation for the dynamics of the scalar field @xmath21 on an effective 4d frw brane .",
    "we shall assume that the 5d spacetime ( [ a1 ] ) is dynamically foliated on the fifth coordinate : @xmath26 , such that the effective 4d hypersurface is @xmath27dt^2 - \\psi^2(t ) \\ , e^{2\\int \\sqrt{\\frac{\\lambda(t)}{3 } } dt } \\ , dr^2 , \\label{u}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with the condition @xmath28 , such that @xmath29 [ @xmath30 are the components of the penta - velocity ] .",
    "we can define @xmath31 and @xmath32 , the energy density and the pressure on @xmath33 in ( [ u ] ) .",
    "we shall consider that @xmath35 and @xmath36 are the energy density and the pressure on the effective 4d hypersurface @xmath37 in ( [ u ] ) and the system describes an adiabatic evolution on ( [ u ] ) , so that ( from the thermodynamical point of view ) it can be considered as a closed system @xmath38 + p_0\\ , \\frac{d}{dt}\\left[a^3(t)\\right]=0.\\ ] ]    since the universe describes a de sitter expansion during the inflationary epoch , it is interesting to study the evolution of @xmath21 on the hypersurface @xmath39 , which can be considered as a brane on ( [ u ] ) .",
    "it is very important to remark that the equivalence principle is broken on @xmath33 : @xmath40 .",
    "hence , @xmath41 and @xmath42 comply with the following equation on @xmath33 : @xmath43 where @xmath44 , @xmath45 is the scale factor on @xmath33 , @xmath46 is the hubble parameter , @xmath47 is the background temperature of the thermal bath , and @xmath48 is its entropy .",
    "a very interesting case , of particular interest is @xmath49 . in this particular case",
    "we can identify @xmath41 and @xmath50 with the radiation energy density and its pressure : @xmath51 and @xmath52 . in this case @xmath53 and the system radiates @xmath54 where the interaction @xmath55 is related with the variation of entropy@xcite .",
    "notice that the entropy increases with time , so that both sides in ( [ en ] ) are positives .",
    "the interesting is that eq .",

    "however , after a few planckian times one recovers @xmath90 , so that @xmath91 , for a matter dominated universe . in other words ,",

    "notice that dissipation @xmath100 is of the order of the expansion @xmath101 during all the inflationary stage , so that the production of entropy remains high in this epoch .",
    "the evolution of entropy is given by @xmath102 so that @xmath103    in the next table we endorse the entropy produced during warm inflation for @xmath104 and @xmath105 , taking into account different values of initial temperature @xmath106    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     where we are using natural units @xmath107 , so that the planckian mass is given by @xmath108 and @xmath24 is the gravitational constant .",
    "the interesting here is that models with smaller initial temperature generate more entropy in shortest times .",
    "in this letter we have studied the evolution of entropy on a 4d frw metric , which can be considered as a brane on a 5d riemann - flat metric on which we define a vacuum .",
    "the generation of entropy is a consequence of dissipative dynamics of the inflaton field , which can be induced from a 5d vacuum state .",
    "furthermore , the equivalence principle is broken on the frw brane on which the `` extra force '' that acts on the inflaton field must be interpreted as non - conservative .    in the example here",
    "studied we have examined different possibilities of evolution with different initial conditions for warm inflation .",
    "our results show how the rate of production of entropy of the universe increases during inflation when @xmath106 is smallest . in this sense ,",
    "models of warm inflation with smallest initial temperature are favored because they produce more entropy in shortest times .",
    "anyway , we found that for all @xmath106 which are below @xmath109 , warm inflation produces a sufficiently high amount of entropy to assure sufficiently flatness of the universe : @xmath110 .",
