    "with such similar numerical data for a real quadratic field @xmath374 ( @xmath145 , class number prime to @xmath1 , @xmath375 of degree @xmath1 over @xmath96 , @xmath376 ( @xmath1 inert ) or @xmath377 ( @xmath1 split ) is , modulo @xmath378 , of the form @xmath379 with a rational @xmath380 ) , we get the following diagram : = 0.65 cm @xmath381 = 1.0 cm    for @xmath382 , @xmath361 , we have no more information likely to give a result on the structure of the profinite group @xmath352 containing a subgroup , of index @xmath1 , isomorphic ( non - canonically ) to @xmath383 .    despite the previous class field theory study , it remains possible that @xmath254 be always non - canonically isomorphic to @xmath384 , independently of additional arithmetic considerations about the group @xmath385 .",
