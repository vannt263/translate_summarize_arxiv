    "since cayley  @xcite in 1857 and 100 years later merson @xcite and followed shortly after by butcher @xcite , it has been known that rooted trees are extremely useful for structuring algebras of differential operators and elementary differentials . in 1972",
    "butcher  @xcite produced the far - reaching result that runge ",
    "kutta methods form a group .",
    "this was later named the butcher group in the paper by hairer and wanner @xcite , who made significant contributions to this theory .",
    "the butcher group is defined on the dual of the tree space and it was pointed out by dr  @xcite that there exists a one - to - one correspondence between the butcher group and the commutative graded hopf algebra of unordered rooted trees .",
    "the hopf algebra of unordered rooted trees has had far - reaching applications in various areas of mathematics and physics . in 1998 a hopf subalgebra was discovered by connes and moscovici  @xcite during work on an index theorem in non - commutative geometry and by kreimer  @xcite in the renormalization method of quantum field theory .",
    "further collaborations between connes and kreimer  @xcite have lead to other surprising results ; notably a connection with the riemann ",
    "hilbert problem was established .",
    "brouder  @xcite realized that the mathematical structure of connes ",
    "kreimer was the same as that of butcher .",
    "grossman and larson  @xcite also developed a cocommutative graded hopf algebra on a general class of rooted trees .",
    "it was shown by foissy  @xcite and hoffman @xcite that the commutative hopf algebra of butcher and connes ",
    "kreimer was the dual of the cocommutative hopf algebra of grossman  larson , which corrected the original result of panaite  @xcite .",
    "murua @xcite has developed series expansions of elementary differential operators and shown among other results that the logarithm of such a series is equivalent to the series expansions obtained from backward error analysis .",
    "recently a great deal of interest has been focused on developing numerical methods which preserve geometric properties of the exact flow . in particular , lie group integrators , which describe integrators that use lie group actions on manifolds , were originally proposed by crouch and grossman @xcite followed shortly after by lewis and simo @xcite",
    ". integrators of this type are now known as lie group integrators ; a survey of these methods is given in @xcite .",
    "series expansions for various classes of lie group methods have been developed ; these expansions are generally used to analyze order .",
    "munthe - kaas @xcite constructed the order conditions for a special subclass of lie group methods , where the computations are performed in a lie algebra , which is a linear space .",
    "later , @xcite it was shown that the classical order conditions could be used along with a certain transformation .",
    "owren and marthinsen @xcite developed the general order conditions for the crouch ",
    "grossman methods with their analysis being based on ordered rooted trees .",
    "recently , owren @xcite derived the order conditions for the commutator free lie group methods @xcite , which were derived to overcome some of the problems associated with computing commutators .",
    "in this paper we aim to construct a commutative graded hopf algebraic structure , which can be used to analyze the order of all lie group methods .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows : in section  [ sect : derivation ] we will introduce ordered trees and forests and describe some useful operations on them .",
    "we will motivate the present hopf algebra as a universal object in a category of non - commutative derivations , and also briefly discuss lie  butcher theory which will be treated in more detail in @xcite .",
    "in section  [ sect : hopf ] we develop the hopf algebra of ordered trees , giving both recursive and non - recursive definitions of the coproduct and antipode , using certain cutting operations on ordered rooted trees .",
    "we show that the hopf algebra described in this paper is the dual of the grossman  larson hopf algebra , thus generalizing the result of hoffman  @xcite . finally , in section  [ sect : homo ] we use a symmeterization operator to provide an injective hopf algebra homomorphism from the unordered trees into the ordered trees , establishing the former as a sub - algebra of the latter .",
    "in this section we will define an algebra @xmath3 spanned by forests of ordered ( and possibly colored ) rooted trees .",
    "this algebra is a universal ( ` free ' ) object in a general category of non - commutative derivation algebras , and plays a role in symbolic computing with lie  butcher series similar to the role of _ free lie algebras _",
    "@xcite in symbolic computing with lie algebras .",
    "let @xmath4 denote the set of _ ordered colored rooted trees _ , and @xmath5 denote the ( empty and nonempty ) words over the alphabet @xmath4 , henceforth called the set of empty and non - empty _ forests_. it",
    "should be noted that , unlike the classical butcher theory , the ordering of the branches in the trees in @xmath4 is important , and likewise the ordering of the trees within the forest @xmath5 .",
    "the basic operations involved in building @xmath4 and @xmath5 are :    * create the empty forest @xmath6 . *",

    "this vector space is naturally equipped with an inner product such that all forests are orthogonal , @xmath26 for @xmath27 and @xmath18 , we let @xmath28 denote the coefficient of the forest @xmath20 , thus @xmath29 can be written as a sum @xmath30 where all but a finite number of terms are zero .",
    "the space of all infinite sums of this kind is denoted @xmath31 and is the dual space of @xmath3 , that is @xmath32 we again let @xmath33 denote the value of @xmath34 on @xmath35 .",

    "alternatively , it is possible to grade this algebra using @xmath43 ; in this case , @xmath41 denotes the linear combination of forests with the same number of nodes .",
