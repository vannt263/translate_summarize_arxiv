    "the rapid burster ( mxb 1730 - 335 , @xcite ; hereafter rb ) is a peculiar neutron star ( ns ) low - mass x - ray binary ( lmxb ) located at a distance of @xmath4 kpc in the globular cluster liller-1 @xcite .",
    "ns lmxbs often show x - ray bursts , either due to thermonuclear burning of accreted material on the ns surface ( type - i ) , or a sudden release of gravitational energy ( type - ii ) .",
    "the rb is one of only two nss showing type - ii x - ray bursts and the only source showing both types .",
    "it typically displays only type - i bursts at high persistent luminosities , and both burst types at lower ones @xcite .",
    "various models for the poorly understood type - ii bursts have been proposed , including magnetospheric gating of the accretion flow ( @xcite , see @xcite for a recent overview of models ) , in which a strong ns magnetic field truncates the accretion disk outside the innermost stable circular orbit ( isco ; @xmath5 @xmath6 for a non - spinning ns , where @xmath7 is the gravitational radius ) .",
    "measuring the inner disk radius can thus provide a direct test of such magnetospheric models for the rb .",
    "constraining the accretion geometry in lmxb is possible by modeling the reflection spectrum @xcite : hard x - ray emission reflected off the accretion disk , which prominently contains a gravitationally and dynamically broadended fe - k line at @xmath8 kev .",
    "using this approach , @xcite find an inner disk radius of @xmath9 @xmath6 in the bursting pulsar ( gro j1744 - 28 , @xcite ; hereafter bp ) , the other source showing type - ii bursts .",
    "this truncation is much larger than typically observed in ns lmxbs ( @xmath5@xmath10 @xmath6 , see e.g. @xcite for a sample study ) .",
    "hence , the question arises whether a similar truncation is present in the rb . in this letter",
    ", we present an analysis of new , simultaneous observations of the rb using _ swift _ , _ nustar _ and _ xmm - newton _ , aimed at constraining the inner disk radius .",
    "as rb outbursts are relatively predictable , a _ swift _ @xcite x - ray telescope ( xrt ) monitoring campaign was carried out in window timing ( wt ) mode to detect the start of the outburst .",

    "the non - burst spectrum is well described by a combination of the comptonization model comptt , relativistic reflection of this comptonized emission ( relconv*reflionx ) , a soft ( disk)blackbody and a narrow emission line at @xmath53 kev . from the reflection spectrum",

    "ns lmxbs show a wide range of inferred inner disk radii , which can roughly be divided into three categories : most sources show small inner disk radii of @xmath5@xmath10  @xmath6 ( 12 lmxbs , see * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "secondly , five ns lmxbs , mostly ( intermittent ) x - ray pulsars , show a slightly larger inner radius of roughly @xmath10@xmath23  @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "finally , two sources show significantly larger truncation radii : @xcite infer @xmath84 @xmath6 for igr j17062 - 6143 , an lmxb persistently accreting a low rates ( @xmath85 erg s@xmath68 ) .",
    "although various possible explanations exist for a truncated disk at such low @xmath86 , truncation by the magnetosphere would imply a large ns magnetic field ( @xmath87 g ) . furthermore , @xcite measure @xmath9 @xmath6 in the bp .",
    "our result places the rb in this third category of large disk truncations . as only the rb and the bp show type - ii bursts , the presence of a large disk truncation in both forms an interesting constraint of type - ii burst models .",
    "models for type - ii bursts can be divided into different general categories ( see * ? ? ? * for a review ) : instabilities in the accretion flow , general - relativistic instabilities close to the isco , and interactions between the accretion disk and the ns magnetic field . as only two lmxbs show type - ii bursts , it is difficult to distinguish between these options . however , the first type of model is unable to account for the uniqueness of the rb and the bp : such instabilities should be observed more generally among ns lmxbs .",
    "the second category is strongly disfavored by our inner disk radius measurement , as it requires the disk to extend up to the isco .",
    "the most prominent model of accretion instabilities driven by a disk - magnetic field interaction is a so - called _ trapped disk _ @xcite . at the magnetospheric radius @xmath88",
    ", the disk is truncated by the magnetic field ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "if the ns spin frequency exceeds the keplerian rotation frequency of the disk at this radius @xmath88 , the magnetic field prevents accretion , confining infalling material in the disk @xcite , or , alternatively , resulting in outflows @xcite . as matter piles up , the magnetospheric radius moves inwards , until the keplerian frequency exceeds the ns spin , matter swiftly accretes and @xmath88 moves out again .",
    "this trapped - disk model is consistent with our measurement of a large truncation radius in the rb , and the similar result for the bp by @xcite .",
    "additionally , in this scenario a change in @xmath51 might be expected during bursts .",
    "however , the size of such a change in inner radius is unknown ; given the relatively large uncertainties on @xmath51 ( @xmath89@xmath16 @xmath6 ) , we might simply be unable to detect such changes significantly in our observations .",
    "assuming that the disk is truncated by the magnetic field , we can estimate the magnetic field of the rb using equation 1 in @xcite .",
    "we estimate a bolometric flux of @xmath90 erg @xmath67 s@xmath68 by extrapolating the best fit over the @xmath91@xmath33 kev range . using geometrical and efficiency parameters from @xcite ,",
    "we find @xmath92 g. this estimate is higher than generally observed for ns lmxbs @xcite .",
    "a similarly high magnetic field as in the rb is present in the 11-hz pulsar igr j17480 - 2446 in terzan 5 @xcite .",
    "this strengthens the proposed link between these two sources @xcite and indicates that the rapid burster , like igr j17480 - 2446 , could be young , mildly recycled lmxb @xcite .",
    "however , a spin measurement for the rb remains necessary to confirm this scenario .",
    "@xcite fit the continuum in a @xmath22@xmath33 kev _ integral _ spectrum with a combination of a powerlaw and a blackbody .",
    "the blackbody parameters ( @xmath93 kev , @xmath94 km ) suggest that this continuum might originate from a hotspot on the ns surface , as expected if the magnetic field truncates the disk , or a boundery layer .",
    "instead , we fit the continuum above @xmath22 kev using a comptt - component , which might thus arise from such a hotspot or boundary layer ( instead of e.g. a corona ) . in the trapped - disk model",
    ", such an origin could also explain the large increase in the comptt - flux during bursts .",
    "as we also have high - quality data below @xmath22 kev , we detect an additional soft blackbody component unseen by _",
    "integral_. its temperature is consistent with the expectation for the ns surface at the inferred accretion rate @xcite , although the implied radius of @xmath95  km is larger than expected for nss ( @xmath96  km ) .",
    "however , @xcite also show that the surface spectrum might slightly deviate from a perfect blackbody .",
    "these deviations in the surface spectrum might thus explain why the bbodyrad  model infers a larger radius than expected .",
    "if the soft component indeed corresponds to the ns surface , it completes a self - consistent geometrical description of the rb spectrum with a large truncation radius and a hotspot on the ns surface .",
