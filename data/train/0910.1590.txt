    ", radiation energy dominates the thermal energy of ions and electrons by several orders of magnitude .    in the subsequent expansion",
    ", the internal energy is mostly converted into kinetic .",
    "the ejecta is optically thick to electron scattering , and the adiabatic condition gives @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the initial internal energy , and @xmath22 , the radius .",
    "after many doubling times , the ejecta reaches a phase of free homologous expansion , where the velocity of a fluid element is proportional to radius @xmath23 .",

    "we determine @xmath13  and @xmath30  below for three different scenarios .",
    "first , if the opacity , @xmath31 , in the supernova envelope were a constant , the time scale of the light curve would be set by the effective diffusion time . given the mean free path @xmath32 and the optical depth of the ejecta @xmath33 , the diffusion time is @xmath34 over time , the supernova radius increases and the density decreases due to the outward expansion . using the characteristic values @xmath35 and @xmath36 in eq .",
    "[ eq : tdiff ] , one can solve for @xmath30 . @xmath37 where the scaling for @xmath13  was determined by using @xmath30  in eq .",

    "these are the scalings of @xcite    the results eq .",
    "[ eq : arnett ] , though commonly applied , are not quite adequate for sne  iip because the assumption of constant opacity neglects the important effects of ionization @xcite .",
    "once the outer layers of ejecta cool below @xmath38  k , hydrogen recombines and the electron scattering opacity drops by several orders of magnitude .",
    "a sharp ionization front develops  ionized material inside the front is opaque , while neutral material above the front is transparent .",
    "the photon mean free path in the ionized matter ( @xmath39  cm ) is much smaller than the ejecta radius ( @xmath40  cm ) , so the supernova photosphere can be considered nearly coincident with the ionization front .",

    "the progressive elimination of electron scattering opacity allows for a more rapid release of the internal energy . once the ionization front reaches the base of the hydrogen envelope , and the internal energy has been largely depleted , the light curve drops off sharply , ending the `` plateau '' .",
    "any subsequent luminosity must be powered by the decay of radioactive elements synthesized in the explosion ( the light curve `` tail '' ) .    to account for hydrogen recombination while ignoring , for the moment , radiative diffusion ( as in * ? ? ?",

    "* ) , we use the fact that the photosphere is fixed near the ionization temperature @xmath41  and radiates a luminosity @xmath42 given by @xmath43 the light curve timescale @xmath30  is then given by how long it takes the photosphere to radiate away all of the ( adiabatically degraded ) internal energy  in other words , @xmath44 .",
    "this , ( along with @xmath45 ) gives @xmath46 unlike eqs .",
    "[ eq : arnett ] , these scalings show no dependence on @xmath31 . effectively , the assumption is that the ejecta is infinitely opaque below the recombination front , and fully transparent above .",

    "finally , to derive scalings which include both the effects of radiative diffusion and recombination ( as in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we return to the diffusion time equation of eq .  [",

    "radioactive @xmath50  synthesized in the explosion introduces an additional energy source concentrated near the center of the debris .",
    "the heating from radioactive decay helps maintain the ionization of the debris and so extends the duration of the plateau . to incorporate this effect into the scalings",

    "all models were computed with the kepler code , which follows stellar evolution including the most up - to - date opacities , prescriptions for mass loss , and nuclear reaction rates @xcite .",

    "this variation is due to mass loss and convective dredge up from the helium core , which are greater in more massive stars .",
    "as the envelope helium abundance affects both the electron scattering opacity and the recombination temperature of the ejecta , we will find it has a significant effect on the light curves of sne  iip .    while most stars in our survey have solar abundances , a lower metallicity ( @xmath72  solar ) @xmath73 model was also included .",
    "the chief effect of the lower metallicity was a smaller presupernova radius and less total mass loss .",

    "any asymmetry in the shock wave , however , is likely smoothed out by propagating through the large hydrogen envelope .",
    "explosive nucleosynthesis was calculated using the same code and physics as in @xcite . while the mass of @xmath50  that is synthesized is numerically well determined by this procedure",
    ", it is an overestimate for two reasons .",
    "first , situating the piston at the edge of the iron core , the deepest it can possibly be without violating nucleosynthetic constraints on the iron isotopes , overestimates both the density and mass close to the explosion .",
    "it is difficult to launch a successful explosion in the face of such high accretion and a more reasonable location for the piston might be farther out near the base of the oxygen shell .",
    "there is a sudden increase in the entropy per baryon , @xmath77 , to a value around 4.0 signals a rapid fall off in density in the presupernova star . to illustrate the sensitivity to the piston location , a second version of the 0.6 b explosion of the solar metallicity 15",
    "@xmath12  star was calculated with the piston at the location where @xmath77 = 4.0 .",
    "the @xmath50  production declined from 0.24 @xmath12  to 0.084 @xmath12 .",
    "second , the ejection of @xmath50  is sensitive to the treatment of mixing and fallback .",
    "it was assumed here that whatever material had positive speed at 10@xmath78 s , the time of the link from the kepler hydrodynamics code to the spectral synthesis code would be ejected . since some of the slow moving material will fall back into the collapsed remnant at later times , this also overestimates the ejection of @xmath50 .",
    "however , mixing which is largely finished before @xmath79 s , reduces this sensitivity by taking @xmath50  that would have fallen in and moving it farther out in the ejecta @xcite .",
    "observations of the tail of the supernova light curve constrain the mass of @xmath50  to be in the range @xmath30.01 - 0.1 @xmath12  @xcite with values closer to 0.1 @xmath12  coming from the more massive progenitors . all in all , it seems that multiplying the @xmath50  yield of our models by a factor of @xmath80 is reasonable .",
    "it should be noted that the plateau phase of the light curve is insensitive to the @xmath50  production ( see section [ sec : onemod ] ) .",
    "in addition to its affect on the absolute yields , hydrodynamical mixing during the explosion can carry @xmath50  out into the hydrogen envelope and hydrogen deep into the core of helium and heavy elements .",
    "the early appearance of x - rays in sn 1987a and the smoothness of the light curve showed that substantial mixing occurred - more than has been provided so far in any calculation of just the rayleigh - taylor instability . mixing that commences with a broken symmetry in the exploding core itself seems to be necessary @xcite . because a large number of models needed to be studied here and because the degree of mixing is affected by the uncertain asymmetry of the central engine , we used a simple parametric representation of the mixing similar to that used by @xcite and @xcite . a running boxcar average of width @xmath81 m is moved through the star a total of @xmath82 times until the desired mixing is obtained .",
    "the default values @xmath81 m and @xmath82 are 10% of the mass of the helium core and 4 , respectively .",
    "this gives , for example , the mixed composition for model 15c in figure  [ fig : model_abun ] .",

    "detailed radiative transfer calculations of the shock breakout phase and early luminosity will be discussed in a separate paper @xcite .    in the monte carlo approach , the radiation field is represented by discrete photon packets which are tracked through randomized scatterings and absorptions . at the start of the calculation , a large number @xmath85 ) of packets",

    "the energy of the packets was chosen so that the sum equaled the equilibrium radiation energy of the zone .",
    "the initial frequency @xmath86 and direction vector @xmath87 of each packet were sampled assuming that the distribution was isotropic and blackbody in the comoving frame . throughout the simulation ,",
    "additional packets were created to model gamma - rays input by the decay of @xmath50  and @xmath54 .",
    "the transport and absorption of these gamma rays were likewise followed using a monte carlo approach applying the relevant opacities .",
    "we adopted a mixed - frame approach for the transport whereby the gas opacities and emissivities were calculated in the comoving frame , while monte carlo packets were tracked in the lab frame .",
    "the relevant optical opacities included electron scattering , bound - free , free - free , and bound - bound line opacity , the last treated in the expansion opacity formalism of @xcite .",
    "the matter ionization and excitation state were computed assuming saha / boltzmann statistics at the matter temperature . while the code allows for non - equilibrium between matter and radiation temperatures , the radiation energy density is so dominant in sne  iip that the two equilibrated on a short timescale .",
    "the scattering of photon packets was simulated by lorentz transforming a packet into the comoving frame , preforming an isotropic scattering , and then transforming back to the lab frame .",
    "the application of the two lorentz transformations changes the energy and frequency of the outgoing packet . when averaged over many scattering events , this effect accounts for the work done by the radiation field .",
    "we checked that the correct behavior was recovered in very optical thick regions of the ejecta , where the radiation energy density evolved with time as it should for a homologous adiabatic flow , @xmath88 .    while the properties of individual packets were sampled from continuous distributions in space , time , and wavelength , the grid through which they moved was discrete . in these calculations , the ejecta was divided into 150 equally spaced radial zones .",
    "opacities and emissivities in each zone were further defined on a wavelength grid of range @xmath89    with a constant binning of 5   .",
    "the physical properties of the zones ( e.g. , density , temperature , ionization state , and opacity ) were updated on a timescale chosen much shorter than the dynamical timescale , with time - steps not exceeding @xmath90  s. higher resolution tests were performed to confirm that the discretization was adequate .",
    "nlte calculations of type  ii spectra show that deviations from lte have significant effects on line profiles , while the continuum flux is less affected @xcite . to estimate the potential effects , we computed stationary nlte spectra on the plateau ( day 50 after explosion ) using the same code .",
    "a particularly relevant nlte effect is on the ca  ii ir - triplet , whose emission is over predicted by lte enough to cause a @xmath91  mag increase in @xmath92-band magnitude .",

    "initially , the model luminosity decreases after shock breakout , and reaches a minimum around day  20 . at that time , the outermost layers of ejecta become cool enough such that hydrogen can recombine .",
