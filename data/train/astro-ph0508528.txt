    "image separations between multiple images play an important role in the statistics of lensed quasars : the image separation is mainly determined by the potential wall depth of the lens object , thus the image separation distribution reflects hierarchical structure in the universe .",
    "this fact suggests that lensed quasars may categorized roughly into two populations ; small - separation lens ( @xmath5 ) that are produced by a single galaxy , and a large - separation lens ( @xmath6 ) that are caused by clusters of galaxies . thus far about",
    "80 lensed quasars are known : most are small - separation lenses and only one lens , sdss j1004 + 4112 @xcite , has the image separation larger than @xmath7 . the current largest homogeneous lens survey , the cosmic lens all sky survey ( class ; * ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , contains small separation only , thus it may not be suitable for studying the image separation distribution from galaxy to cluster scales . however , ongoing lens surveys such as that in the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) are expected to unveil the full distribution , which will be extremely useful for understanding the assembly of structures .    in theoretical sides ,",
    "there have been many attempts to calculate the full image separation distribution .",
    "historically , the image separation distribution is computed from either the galaxy luminosity function @xcite or the mass function of dark halos @xcite . while the former approach accounts for the observed lensing probability and its distribution at @xmath8 fairly well , it has difficulty in explaining the existence of the large - separation lens for which dark matter dominates the lens potential",
    ". therefore in this paper we take the latter approach .",
    "however , modeling the image separation distribution on the basis of dark halos is not simple . it has been found that none of models that consider only one population for lensing halos are consistent with current observations .",
    "correct models need to include a characteristic mass around @xmath9 , where the density distribution inside dark halos changes @xcite : large mass halos @xmath10 ( correspond to groups or clusters ) have cooling time longer than the hubble time , thus the internal structure of dark halos is not strongly affected by baryon cooling and is well described by that of dark matter @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , in small mass halos @xmath11 ( correspond to galaxies ) the baryon cooling is very efficient and the mass distribution becomes strongly centrally concentrated , which is well approximated by the singular isothermal sphere ( sis ) .",
    "although this two - component model is successful in explaining the image separation distribution to some extent , clearly it is not sufficient .",
    "first of all , this model considers only galaxies that lie at the center of isolated dark halos , and thus does not take galaxies in groups and clusters into account .",
    "put another way , this model neglects substructures ( subhalos ) which should corresponds to satellite galaxies .",
    "actually , it has been speculated that lens systems in such dense environments is quite common @xcite .",
    "in addition , sometimes lens systems are significantly affected by the mass distribution outside the lens object .",
    "a good example is q0957 + 561 @xcite ; its lens object is a galaxy in a cluster , and the image separation is much larger than expected from the luminosity of the lens galaxy because the image separation is boosted by the cluster potential .",
    "indeed , it has been shown theoretically that at intermediate - separation regime ( @xmath12 ) lens galaxies in dense environments are quite common @xcite .",
    "therefore the correct model needs to account for such external mass .    to construct a model that is based on dark halos and subhalos",
    ", we have to model the relation between mass of dark halos ( subhalos ) and luminosities of galaxies inside them .",
    "there are several models to link them : conditional luminosity function ( clf ) which is defined by the luminosity function in a halo of given mass @xcite , universal mass - luminosity relation between halo / subhalo mass and hosted galaxy luminosity @xcite , and the mixture of these two models @xcite .",
    "there models are calibrated to match observed galaxy luminosity functions , clustering of galaxies as a function of galaxy luminosities , and the luminosity function of galaxies in groups or clusters .    in this paper , we study the image separation distribution with a particular emphasis on the different contributions from central and satellite galaxies . for central galaxies ,",
    "we consider baryon cooling in a dark matter halo as done by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "satellite galaxies , which have been neglected in previous studies , are linked to dark halo substructures .",
    "we basically take the approach proposed by @xcite to relate mass of dark halos and subhalos with luminosities of galaxies , but we modify it to account for the relatively small abundance of satellite galaxies in galactic halos ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . for satellite galaxies , the external mass from the host halo , which is shown to be important at large - image separations ,",
    "is taken into account .",
    "in addition to the difference between central and satellite galaxies , we also pay particular attention to how lens objects make the transition from sis to nfw as halo masses increase .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in  [ sec : halo ] , we introduce models of dark halos and subhalos that are used to compute lensing probabilities . section [ sec : link ] are devoted to model the relation between ( sub-)halo masses and galaxy luminosities .",

    "we find that our model explains both observed distributions reasonably well .",
    "an exception is that for all lenses the observed number of sub - arcsecond ( @xmath166 ) lenses appears to be smaller than expected .",
    "however , this is clearly due to a selection effect that sub - arcsecond lenses are difficult to find particularly in optical lens surveys .",
    "indeed , for the class lenses , which is a lens survey in a radio band , the discrepancy is less significant .",
    "thus we conclude that our model well accounts for the observed image separation distributions .        it should be noted that the theoretical predictions is based on many assumptions",
    ". the most important ingredient of our model is the mass - to - luminosity relation defined in equations ( [ ml_halo ] ) and ( [ ml_sub ] ) . to see how the result is dependent on the adopted relation , in figure [ fig : prob_ml ] we show the dependence of the total image separation distribution on the mass - to - luminosity relations . as seen in the figure , the shape ( rather than the overall normalization ) of the image separation distribution is quite sensitive to the mass - to - luminosity relation .",
    "this indicates that precise measurements of the image separation distribution offer quite useful probe of the mass - to - luminosity relation .",
    "in this paper , we have constructed a model of the image separation distribution .",
    "our model is based on dark halos and subhalos which are linked to central and satellite galaxies respectively via simple mass - to - luminosity relation . for dark halos and central galaxies , we have considered baryon cooling in a dark matter halo using an improved adiabatic contraction model of @xcite . for satellite galaxies ,",
    "we have considered the mass associate with their host halo .",
    "our primary interest is to quantify the contribution of the subhalo population which has been ignored in all previous studies .",
    "our results are summarized as follows :    * we predict that @xmath156 of lenses should be caused by central galaxies ( halos ) and @xmath0 of lenses should be produced by satellite galaxies ( subhalos ) .",
    "the fraction of the subhalo population takes the maximum at @xmath5 , and becomes smaller with increasing image separations .",
    "* the mass distributions of lensing halos at small ( @xmath167 ) and large ( @xmath126 ) image separation regions are close to those of sis and nfw , respectively . at @xmath129",
    "the mass distributions are complicated and can not be described by either sis or nfw . * for both halo and subhalo populations , already at @xmath150",
    "the effect of dark halos becomes significant , making a simple sis approximation worse .",
    "this means applying isothermal profiles to these lenses results in biased estimates of parameters such as velocity dispersions and the hubble constant from time delays . *",
    "our model predicts that lensing halos of small separation lenses are heterogeneous : halo - by - halo differences of the shape of rotation curves and the fraction of dark matter at image positions are large .",
    "this is a natural consequence of the scatters of the concentration parameter and the mass - to - luminosity relation around their medians .",
    "* in computing the image separation distribution for the subhalo component , it is important to take account of the external mass which comes from their host halos .",
    "this also implies very strong dependence of environments of lensing satellite galaxies on image separation distributions . *",
    "halo and subhalo populations have quite different contributions of image separation distributions from different ( host-)halo mass intervals .",
    "we predict that @xmath2 of lenses lie in groups , and @xmath160 in clusters .",
    "almost half of lenses in groups and clusters are produced by satellite galaxies ( subhalos ) , rather than central galaxies ( halos ) .",
    "* we have compared our model predictions with observed image separation distributions and found that they are in reasonable agreements with each other .",
    "since the shape of the image separation distribution is rather sensitive to the mass - to - luminosity relation , precise measurements of the image separation distribution in well - defined statistical lens samples offer powerful probe of the connection between dark halos and galaxies .    in summary ,",
    "we have constructed a realistic model which predicts lensing probabilities from small to large image separations .",
    "the model is quite useful in understanding lens populations as a function of the image separation .",
    "the fraction of lensing by the subhalo population , which has been derived for the first time in this paper , is important for not only an accurate prediction of the image separation distribution but also interpreting results of mass modeling of individual lens systems since central and satellite galaxies may show rather different lensing characteristics .",
    "we note that there are several ways to improve our modeling .",
    "first , we have considered early - type galaxies only .",
    "although this can be justified because most of lensing galaxies are early - type , the very existence of lensing by late - type galaxies indicates that the correct model needs to take both the two galaxy types into account .",
    "since the lensing by spiral galaxies has quite small image separation @xmath168 and also is inefficient @xcite , we expect that the inclusion of late - type galaxies decreases the number of sub - arcsecond lenses caused by central galaxies . in addition , we have neglected the scatters of the relations between galaxy luminosities , velocity dispersions , and effective radii .",
    "the scatters could affect the quantitative results , as the scatter in the mass - to - luminosity relation is important .",
    "the redshift evolutions of relations are also neglected . however",
    ", if we assume the evolution of early type galaxies at @xmath169 is purely passive , it implies that the mass distribution of lensing halos does not change across the redshift .",
    "therefore we expect the effect of redshift evolution is rather small .",
    "more importantly , we have assumed simple spherical halos . in reality ,",
    "dark halos are quite triaxial @xcite and the triaxiality enhances lensing probabilities by a few factors at large - separations @xcite . on the other hand , small - separation lensing probabilities are hardly affected by the ellipticity of lens galaxies : @xcite showed that the change is less than a few percents unless quasars are very bright .",
    "large - separation lensing probabilities are also sensitive to the inner slope of dark matter halos ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we not , however , that the mass distribution after baryon cooling is rather insensitive to the inner slope of dark halos , thus the fraction of lensing by satellite galaxies does not depend on the inner slope very much .",
    "refining our model by incorporating these is beyond the scope of this paper , but is of interest for future studies .",
    "the author would like to thank c. keeton , n. dalal , j. ostriker , j. lee , and a. vale for discussions .",
    "the author is supported by jsps through jsps research fellowship for young scientists ."
