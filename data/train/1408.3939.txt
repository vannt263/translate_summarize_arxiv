    "electrons restricted into the hilbert space of the partially filled lowest landau level ( lll ) by the application of strong magnetic field perpendicular to the plane of the quasi - two dimensional systems become strongly correlated that leads to a topological quantum state of matter giving rise to fractional quantum hall effect @xcite ( fqhe ) .",
    "one of the topological characters appears through the emergence of composite fermions @xcite ( cfs ) from the cooperative phenomenon between electrons confined in the lll .",
    "a composite fermion is a bound state of an electron and an even number @xmath3 of quantized vortices that produce a berry phase of @xmath4 for a closed loop around it .",
    "because of this , cfs experience a much reduced magnetic field @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the perpendicular component of the external magnetic field , @xmath7 is the two - dimensional electron density , and the unit flux quantum @xmath8 . as a consequence ,",
    "cfs form their own landau - like kinetic energy levels , called @xmath9 levels ( @xmath9ls ) , in this reduced effective magnetic field . this energy splitting in the lll",
    "is thus a direct manifestation of the topological order in fqhe .",
    "integer quantum hall effect ( iqhe ) of noninteracting cfs at filling factor @xmath10 ( the integer @xmath11 refers to the @xmath11 completely filled @xmath9ls ) describes fqhe of electrons at the filling factor @xmath12 , where @xmath13 denotes @xmath14 @xmath15 .",
    "jain s composite fermion wave functions @xcite for the ground state of fqhe at @xmath16 is @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the complex coordinate of the @xmath19 particle in @xmath20 particle system , the jastrow factor @xmath21 represents the attachment of @xmath3 quantized vortices to every electrons transforming them into cfs , @xmath22 is the wave function for completely filled @xmath11 lowest @xmath9ls by noninteracting cfs , and @xmath23 represents projection into the lll .",
    "these wave functions describe the wave functions for electrons being spinless which is justified because the electrons become polarized for large zeeman energy @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the effective g - factor for the electrons in the system and @xmath26 is the total external magnetic field .",
    "nevertheless , the polarization of the fqhe states can become less than @xmath27 for low zeeman energy , to be precise , polarization @xcite will be @xmath28 where @xmath29 and @xmath30 represents the number of @xmath9ls filled by up ( down)-spin cfs , and consequently spin - transitions @xcitetake place by tuning @xmath26 and keeping @xmath6 fixed . in this paper",
    "we consider fully spin - polarized fqhe states only , but the role @xcite of empty spin - reversed @xmath9ls on neutral collective excitations will also be considered .",
    "neutral collective modes in quantum hall states have been studied using hartree - fock approximations @xcite for the electronic excitons , density modulation @xcite over the ground state in the single - mode approximation @xcite ( sma ) , exact diagonalizations @xcitefor small systems , hamiltonian description of composite fermions @xcite , and excitons of composite fermions @xcite .",
    "all these studies qualitatively or semiquantatively describe the presence of `` magneto - roton '' and `` spin - roton '' in the collective modes that have been identified in several inelastic light scattering ( ils ) experiments.@xcite in this paper , we employ the method of using excitons of cfs for determining neutral collective modes . in the composite - fermion theory",
    ", the neutral collective excitations emerge due to mixing @xcite of several levels of cf - excitons , wherein a single cf from any of the filled @xmath9ls is excited into any of the empty @xmath9ls of either spin . if the change in the @xmath9l index of the excited cf becomes @xmath31 , then the corresponding cf - exciton is called `` level-@xmath31 '' cf - exciton . apart from @xmath0 , there can be more than one cf - excitons at level-@xmath31 , depending on the @xmath9l where the said cf is situated in the ground state . the excitation of a cf into a @xmath9l without ( with ) changing its spin , _",
    "i.e _ , the change in spin projection @xmath32 corresponds to spin-0 ( spin-1 ) cf - exciton .",
    "therefore , the excited state wave function @xcite that corresponds to level-@xmath31 and spin-@xmath33 ( @xmath33=0 or 1 ) cf - exciton is @xmath34 where @xmath35 represents wave function of a cf - exciton where one of the cf from @xmath11-filled @xmath9ls is excited across @xmath31 @xmath9ls with @xmath36 .",
    "this theory naturally describes more than one neutral collective modes @xcite and thus it is clearly distinct from the sma which by definition describes only one neutral mode . in past ,",
    "both spin - conserving ( spin - zero ) and spin - reversed ( spin - one ) neutral collective modes had been studied @xcite for several filling factors using sma .",
    "while some of the qualitative features such as number of `` magneto - roton '' minima and finite gap at the long wavelength limit in spin - zero modes and spin - wave mode in the filling factor 1/3 agree with the lowest collective modes in the cf theory , the latter describes following additional characteristics which do not have any sma analogue .",
    "first , the higher energy spin - zero modes at @xmath0 merge @xcite with the lowest mode at the long wavelength limit .",
    "second , the higher energy spin - zero modes at @xmath1 and 2/5 , and spin - one modes at @xmath0 also have rotons in their dispersions @xcite .",
    "the lowest spin - one modes at @xmath2 , 3/7 , and 4/9 have `` spin - roton '' minima @xcite showing an unusual characteristic of a composite fermion ferromagnet as their energies are lower than @xmath37 . in this paper , we provide a detailed account of the theoretical aspects of our previously published results @xcite , and a handful of new results : we determine the lowest two spin - zero collective modes at filling factors 3/7 and 4/9 , and spin - one collective modes at higher energies for filling factors 2/5 , 3/7 , and 4/9 . by incorporating local density approximation @xcite ( lda ) , we calculate quantum well thickness and carrier density dependent energies of the critical modes such as rotons , spin - rotons , long - wavelength , and large - momentum for all of the neutral collective modes .    the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we provide explicit form of the composite fermion wave functions for the ground states as well as excited states due to the formation of both spin-0 and spin-1 cf - excitons at filling factor @xmath38 in a spherical geometry@xcite .",
    "we have derived a recursion relation for the jain - kamilla @xcite lll - projected spherical harmonics as the single particle basis states . in section iii , we present both spin - zero and spin - one collective modes obtained by the evaluation of coulomb energies for the composite fermion wave functions of the ground and excited states by the monte carlo method in the fully polarized phase of the filling factors 1/3 , 2/5 , 3/7 , and 4/9 .",
    "first , we obtain wave functions for different levels of cf - excitons when a cf particle is excited across some of the lowest available empty @xmath9ls with or without same spin , depending on the type of excitations .",
    "secondly , we calculate all the elements of the coulomb matrix in the restricted low - energy hilbert space of the chosen levels of cf - excitons .",
    "we then perform graham - schmidt orthogonalization procedure to obtain an orthogonal basis in this restricted hilbert space and calculate effective coulomb matrix in the new orthogonal basis . finally , we diagonalize the effective coulomb matrix @xcite to obtain the energies of the excited states and hence the determination of the energies of the lowest and higher modes upon subtracting the energy of the fully polarized ground state .",
    "the characteristics of the modes at different filling factors are as follows . filling factor 1/3 : all the lowest three spin - zero modes that we determine have one roton and they merge @xciteat the long wavelength limit , although they are well separated at the high momentum region .",
    "the lowest spin - one mode is a spin - wave with zero interaction energy at the momentum @xmath39 , in consistence with larmor s theorem , and finite energy at large momentum .",
    "the next two higher spin - one modes are well separated with the formation of one spin - roton @xcitein each of those . filling factor 2/5 : the lowest two spin - zero modes have two rotons each and the modes do not merge @xciteat long wavelength .",
    "the lowest spin - one mode behaves as spin - wave at long - wavelength but its negative curvature leads to lowering its energy until it forms a spin - roton @xcite minimum ; in a window of momentum , the energy of this mode is lower than the zeeman energy .",
    "the next higher spin - one mode also possesses a spin - roton but it has finite energy at @xmath39 . filling factor 3/7 :",
    "the lowest two spin - zero modes have three rotons each and finite separation at @xmath39 . as in filling factor 2/5",

    "the lowest spin - one mode has two spin - rotons and a spin - maxon ( a maximun in the dispersion of spin - one mode ) , apart from its spin - wave nature at @xmath39 .",
    "the net excitation energy of this mode is always less than @xmath37 .",
    "the next higher mode has a spin - roton . in section iv , we review the procedure @xcite of determining effective two dimensional coulomb potential between electrons in a square well of finite transverse width in lda .",

    "we employ standard spherical surface @xcite where the electrons are influenced by the radial magnetic flux @xmath40 ( @xmath41 is an integer ) due to the dirac magnetic monopole of charge @xmath42 placed at the center of the sphere with radius @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is the magnetic length .",

    "<S> we determine the lowest and higher order collective modes in both spin - conserving and spin - reversed sectors by calculating energy differences of the appropriate linear combinations of different levels of composite - fermion - excitons and the fully spin - polarized ground states at filling factors @xmath0 , 2/5 , 3/7 , and 4/9 . </S>",
    "<S> apart from providing the detailed study of previously reported modes that have also been observed in the experiments , we predict additional higher energy modes at different filling factors . </S>",
    "<S> the lowest and the next higher spin - conserving modes have equal number of `` magneto - rotons '' and the number is the same as the number of filled effective landau - like levels of composite fermions . </S>",
    "<S> the higher energy modes at @xmath1 merge with the lowest mode at long - wavelength . </S>",
    "<S> the spin - conserving modes do not merge at other filling factors . </S>",
    "<S> apart from showing zero - energy spin - wave mode at zero momentum , thanks to larmor s theorem , the lowest spin - reversed modes at the ferromagnetic ground states of @xmath2 , 3/7 , and 4/9 display one or more `` spin - rotons '' at negative energies signalling the unstable fully polarized ground states at sufficiently small zeeman energies . </S>",
    "<S> the high energy spin - reversed modes also have spin - rotons but at positive energies . </S>",
    "<S> the energies of these excitations depend on the finite width of the quantum well as the coulomb interaction gets screened . </S>",
    "<S> we determine finite thickness correction to the coulomb interaction by the standard method of local density approximation and use them to calculate the critical energies such as rotons , long - wavelength , and short - wavelength modes which are detectable in inelastic light scattering experiments . </S>"
