    "the first sensitive sub - millimeter bolometer camera ( the sub - millimeter common user bolometer array , scuba ) unveiled a new population of galaxies over a decade ago @xcite , with very large sub - millimeter fluxes ( @xmath10  mjy at 850 ) , which were named sub - millimeter galaxies ( smgs ) .",
    "these galaxies were later identified to be typically at high redshift , and often very faint or completely undetected at ( rest - frame ) optical wavelengths ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "the large sub - millimeter fluxes of smgs imply very large dust infrared luminosities ( @xmath11 ) , which are likely powered by intense star formation ( exceeding several times @xmath12 ) .",
    "even though the number density of these galaxies is low ( e.g.  @xcite ) , such highly star - forming galaxies are thought to be the progenitors of local elliptical galaxies ( e.g.  @xcite ) , and the intense gas consumption in these objects may be linked to agn growth and feedback ( e.g.  @xcite ) . therefore , understanding these objects is crucial to trace the evolution of todays massive galaxies ( see @xcite for reviews ) .",
    "a main limitation in characterizing sub - millimeter galaxies in terms of redshift and physical properties such as stellar mass , star formation rate and dust attenuation has been identifying their counterparts at shorter wavelengths , due to the large beams of the single - dish sub - millimeter discovery observations .",
    "modern ( sub-)millimeter interferometers such as the iram plateau de bure interferometer ( pdbi ) and now the atacama large millimeter array ( alma ) are allowing us to pin - point the position of smgs with unprecedented accuracy , which allows , for the first time , to reliably identify their counterparts at optical , infrared and radio wavelengths .",
    "the single - dish laboca 870-  survey of the extended _ chandra _ deep field south ( ecdf - s ) , less , is the largest and deepest contiguous survey ever performed at that wavelength , and identified 126 sub - millimeter sources with 870-  fluxes above 4  mjy @xcite .",
    "122 of the 126 less sources were followed - up at the same wavelength , with unprecedentedly high sensitivity and spatial resolution enabled by alma in the cycle 0 program aless @xcite .",
    "the high resolution enabled by the alma interferometer allowed for a de - blending of multiple sources that were previously identified as a single source due to the large beam of single - dish observations , and to pin - point the location of the detected smgs to within @xmath0  arcsec @xcite . using these observations",
    ", @xcite demonstrated the limitations in identifying the counterparts of sub - millimeter sources in previous single - dish studies .",
    "the aless observations showed that between 35 and 50% of the detected laboca sources are actually multiple sources blended in the large beam , and that 45% of counterparts were missed by previous statistical methods that relied on higher - resolution 24-  and radio observations . _",
    "these observations make aless the first statistically reliable survey of smgs , which allows for a complete and unbiased multi - wavelength study of the properties of this galaxy population .",
    "_    the ecdf - s field contains a wealth of ancillary data from x - rays , to optical , near - infrared , far - infrared and radio wavelengths .",
    "@xcite measured aperture photometry of the aless counterparts ( based on the alma positions ) in up to 19 bands from the @xmath13-band to the _",
    "spitzer_/irac 8-  band .",
    "they used the observed optical spectral energy distributions ( seds ) to compute photometric redshifts , stellar masses and dust attenuation of the sources . at longer wavelengths , @xcite estimated the infrared fluxes of the aless smgs by using the alma positions as priors to de - blend the lower - resolution _ herschel _ photometry , thus building the full infrared seds from 24  to 500- , also including the alma flux at 870  and the radio flux at 1.4  ghz .",
    "@xcite fit these seds using templates to derive the first estimates of total infrared luminosity , dust temperature and star formation rates of these galaxies .",
    "the aless sample and the studies described above allow us to build , for the first time , the complete spectral energy distributions from ( rest - frame ) ultraviolet to the radio of a complete , statistically unbiased survey of smgs with robust counterparts .",
    "however , so far most studies have analysed the ( optical ) stellar and the infrared ( dust ) seds of smgs independently from each other ( with the exception @xcite , who used grasil @xcite templates to model the full seds of smgs ) .",
    "typically , photometric redshifts , stellar masses and dust attenuations are derived from optical data , while dust luminosities , dust masses and star formation rates are constrained from far - infrared / sub - millimeter data .",
    "moreover , often the models used to analyze the optical seds are models that were calibrated mostly using ` normal ' local galaxies which are not likely to be as dust - obscured and actively star - forming as high - redshift smgs .",
    "this is problematic because stellar age , dust and photometric redshift suffer degeneracies ( as pointed out by , e.g.  @xcite ) , and at this high optical depth regime stellar mass - to - light ratios are very difficult to constrain ( as discussed by e.g.  @xcite ) .    in this paper",
    ", we interpret consistently the full ultraviolet - to - radio spectral energy distributions of the aless smgs in terms of photometric redshift , stellar content , star formation activity and dust properties using an updated version of the  model @xcite .",
    "the new version of the code extends the sed parameter priors to the high - redshift , high - optical depth and actively star - forming regime , mainly by including new star formation histories , a more general prior for the dust attenuation parameters , and the effect of intergalactic medium absorption of ultraviolet photons at high redshift , allowing us to make a detail exploration of the parameter space for our sources .",
    "additionally , our new infrared emission models include a wider range of possible dust temperatures and a simple radio emission component .",
    "the new sed - fitting code used in this paper also allows for the photometric redshift to be left as a free parameter when fitting the observed seds .",
    "this allows us to explore how well we can constrain the physical properties and photometric redshift of smgs when using all available information from the ultraviolet to the radio .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in ",
    "[ data ] , we describe the multi - wavelength data available for the aless smgs . in  [ modelling ] , we describe the  model , which computes the stellar and dust emission of galaxies in a consistent way , and the modifications to the model that were made to better explore the parameter space of high - redshift galaxies . in ",
    "[ sedfits ] , we present our method to fit the multi - wavelength seds of the aless sources using , discuss the photometric redshifts obtained using our approach , and discuss the properties of the most optically - faint aless sources . in  [ properties ] , we analyze the physical properties related to the stellar content and dust properties of our sources obtained with .",
    "we discuss the average intrinsic spectral energy distributions of the aless smgs , and how the aless smgs compare with ` main sequence ' galaxies at their redshifts in  [ discussion ] .",
    "our conclusions are summarized in  [ conclusion ] .    throughout this paper ,",
    "we use a concordance @xmath14cdm cosmology with @xmath15  km  s@xmath16  mpc@xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "unless otherwise stated , we adopt a @xcite initial mass function ( imf ) and ab system magnitudes .",
    "of the 122 less sources that were followed - up at higher resolution with alma as part of the aless program , several were resolved into multiple counterparts , producing a total of 131 smg detections @xcite .",
    "99 of these aless smgs are considered to be the most reliable by @xcite , based on the fact that they are significant detections ( with s / n@xmath19 ) inside the alma primary beam of good - quality maps ",
    "these are the sources in the main aless catalog . the remaining 32 sources ( supplementary catalog )",
    "are found to be less reliable by @xcite , and are therefore are not included in the main aless sample ( @xcite show that up to 30% of smgs in the supplementary catalog are likely to be spurious ) .",
    "we choose to include only the 99 smgs from the main aless catalog in our analysis , because they are the most statistically reliable sample of smgs and therefore allow for a complete and unbiased study of this population of galaxies .",
    "the positions of these smgs are known to @xmath0  arcsec thanks to the high - resolution alma interferometric observations , which allows us to identify the counterparts and measure the fluxes of the smgs at other wavelengths , using deep ancillary data in the optical , infrared and radio .",
    "to sample the rest - frame stellar emission of our galaxies , we use the ( aperture ) photometry of the aless counterparts ( based on the alma positions ) compiled by @xcite from archival ground - based and _",
    "spitzer_/irac observations of the ecdf - s ; this provides photometry in up to 19 bands for each galaxy .",
    "most of the @xmath20 photometry comes from the musyc survey @xcite , which is supplemented with ( deeper ) @xmath13-band data from the goods / vimos imaging survey @xcite . in the near - infrared , additional deep @xmath21- and",

    "was measured by @xcite across all filters by centering 3  arcsec apertures on the alma position ( with a possible shift of @xmath23  arcsec ) and applying aperture corrections based on the total flux of a composite psf .",
    "the uncertainties are computed by measuring the flux in 3-arcsec apertures placed in random blank regions of the sky in each image ( and assuming that sky noise dominates the flux uncertainty ) ; full details are given in @xcite .",
    "77 of our aless main catalog sources are detected ( i.e. their flux is 3@xmath24 above the background noise ) in at least four optical / near - ir bands .",
    "@xcite apply systematic offsets to the measured photometry to optimize sed fits to the  code templates @xcite .",
    "since these offsets are sed - model / fitting - procedure dependent , we chose to use the raw photometry measured in @xcite without including the offsets ( in practice this means that we subtract the offsets from the photometry quoted in their table 2 ) . in order to account for possible zero point offsets and/or mis - matches between the photometry at different wavelengths ,",
    "we add a magnitude error in quadrature to the quoted errors that is proportional to the photometric offsets determined by @xcite . for the photometric bands where @xcite apply smaller offets , we conservatively add an additional @xmath25  mag to the error in quadrature .",
    "we use the mid - infrared , far - infrared and radio fluxes of the aless sources compiled in @xcite , which we briefly summarize here .",
    "@xcite exploit the _",
    "spitzer_/mips 24-  images of the ecdfs publicly available from the far - infrared deep extragalactic ( fidel ) survey , and extracted a catalog of about 3600 sources down to a @xmath26 depth of @xmath27jy .",
    "the very large array ( vla ) radio observations at 1.4  ghz come from catalogue of the ecdfs described in @xcite .",
    "the ecdf - s was imaged with _ herschel _ at 70 , 100 and 160  with pacs as part of the pacs evolutionary probe ( pep ) survey @xcite .",
    "@xcite obtained the pacs fluxes for the aless smgs by matching them with the pep catalog extracted by @xcite .",
    "_ herschel_/spire imaging at 250 , 350 and 500  is available from the _ herschel _ multitiered extragalactic survey ( hermes ;",
    "@xcite ) . due to the large beam of the spire observations , it is challenging to measure the photometry of individual sources .",
    "@xcite obtained the spire fluxes of the aless sources using a de - blending method based on positional priors from the alma maps together with the mips 24-  and radio source catalogs .",
    "we note that , since the resolution of the optical / near - infrared ( @xmath28  arcsec ) and far - infrared ( @xmath29  arcsec ) are so different , it is not possible to measure the photometry in an identical manner across all wavelengths .",
    "however , in all cases , we extract ` total fluxes ' : in the optical / near - infrared , @xcite achieve this by applying aperture corrections based on the total flux of a composite psf determined using point sources in the images , as mentioned in section  [ optobs ] , and described in detail in section  2.2.1 of @xcite . in the far - infrared , @xcite de - blend the _ herschel _ maps by using a psf at each wavelength for each galaxy in the prior catalog , and they demonstrate ( using simulations ) that the total fluxes of sources are recovered using this method .",
    "thus , we expect the combination of far - infrared and optical / near - infrared here to be as reliable as possible given the available data .",
    "in this paper we aim to model the full observed spectral energy distributions of the aless smgs from the rest - frame ultraviolet to the radio in a physically consistent way .",
    "to do so , we use the  code @xcite , which relies on an energy balance technique to consistently combine the emission by stellar populations with the attenuation and emission by dust in galaxies . in this section , we summarize the main ingredients of  and present an updated version , which extends the parameter space of the models in order to include also properties that are more likely applicable to high - redshift smgs . specifically , we extend our star formation history and dust optical depth priors (  [ sfh ] and  [ attenuation ] ) , and we add intergalactic medium absorption in the ultraviolet (  [ igm ] ) .",
    "the stellar population properties of smgs have been challenging to constrain , mostly because of limited ( rest - frame optical / near - infrared ) observations available , and also because previous analysis have not modelled the full seds in a physically consistent way while sampling properly the full parameter space of star formation histories , metallicities , and dust content .",
    "previous studies that have attempted to derive the stellar masses of high - redshift smgs by modelling their rest - frame ultraviolet to near - infrared seds have used limited parameterizations of the star formation history @xcite .",
    "these studies demonstrate that determining the mass - to - light ratio of smgs is particularly challenging because of the large degeneracy between stellar age and dust reddening , which is exacerbated in the very dust - obscured regime ; also , in this regime , a large fraction of the mass may be completely dust - obscured in optically - thick regions .",
    "one of the main goals of our sed modelling is to properly take into account these degeneracies and uncertainties in order to get robust likelihood distributions for the stellar masses of the aless smgs .",
    "to do so , we consider a wide range of sfhs , dust attenuations and metallicities , and employ a bayesian approach to constrain the physical parameters from observations .",
    "in addition , by modelling the infrared dust emission consistently with the emission by stellar populations in the rest - frame ultraviolet to near - infrared , we expect to better constrain the attenuation by dust and hence get more insight into obscured populations that are required to power the observed dust emission @xcite .    in the next sub - section ,",
    "we describe the stellar emission models used to fit the uv to near - ir emission from our galaxies .",
    "these models are build using parameter priors that we optimized to get the best possible stellar mass , dust attenuation , mean stellar ages and star formation rate estimates and , at the same time , understand uncertainties and degeneracies that affect these parameters .",
    "we build a library of @xmath30 stellar emission models that is specifically adapted to interpret the emission from high - redshift , possibly dusty sources with unknown ages and star formation histories .",
    "the prior likelihood distributions for each parameter described below are intended to extend the parameter space of the models ( compared to the current publicy - available  priors which were calibrated on local galaxies of typically lower infrared luminosities and star formation rates ; @xcite ) , so that they include higher dust optical depths , higher star formation rates , and younger ages ( since we expect galaxies to be younger at high redshift ) .",
    "however , it is important to note that we avoid biasing our estimates by also including a large fraction of models extending to low dust optical depths , low star formation rates and older ages , and allowing our bayesian fitting constrain the most likely values . by doing a bayesian analysis and building the posterior likelihood distribution of each parameter ( based on @xmath31 comparison with the observed photometry )",
    ", we ensure robust estimates and specially robust confidence ranges that take into account parameter degeneracies and uncertainties due to lack of / poor observational constraints in certain wavelength ranges ( see more detailed discussion in e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "we compute the stellar emission of each model as in @xcite ; essentially , the luminosity per unit wavelength emerging at at time @xmath32 from a model galaxy is expressed as : @xmath33 \\ , , \\label{llambda}\\ ] ] where @xmath34 is the luminosity emitted per unit wavelength per unit mass by a simple stellar population ( ssp ) of age @xmath35 and metallicity @xmath36 , @xmath37 is the star formation rate evolution with time ( i.e. the star formation history ) , and @xmath38 is the effective absorption optical depth seen by stars of age @xmath35 .",
    "we compute the emission by ssps using the spectral population synthesis models of @xcite ( using a @xcite initial mass function ) ; we adopt a uniform prior in metallicity from 0.2 to 2 times solar .",
    "we discuss the modelling of star formation histories and dust attenuation in the next sections .      for each model ,",
    "we parameterize the star formation history ( sfh ) as a continuous delayed exponential function of the form : @xmath39 where @xmath32 is the model age ( i.e. the time since the onset of star formation ) and @xmath40 is the inverse of the star formation time - scale in gyr@xmath16 .",
    "this form of the star formation history for high - redshift galaxies is motivated by @xcite .",
    "there is growing evidence ( based on observations and on galaxy evolution models ) that , for high redshift galaxies , the sfhs are likely to have a variety of shapes , but overall they should be rising with time instead of declining as the ` @xmath41-models ' typically used at low redshift @xcite .",
    "the sfh parameterization we adopt here ( eq .  [ sfh ] ) rises linearly at early ages and then declines exponentially with the timescale defined by the @xmath42 parameter . for each model , we draw @xmath42 randomly from a broad prior distribution ( @xmath42 can vary between @xmath43 and @xmath44 , which corresponds to the peak of the sfh happening between 0.7 and 13.3  gyrs after the onset of star formation ) .",
    "we draw the age randomly between 0.1 and 10  gyr .",
    "this ensures that our model library includes a wide range of possible continuous sfhs that go from essentially @xmath41-like models peaking at very early ages , to approximately constant star formation rates with time , to sfhs that are linearly increasing with time .",
    "despite the fact that we cover a wide range of star formation evolution with this prior , the actual form of sfhs is likely to be more complex than any analytical parameterization ( see e.g. @xcite ) . to account for stochasticity on the star formation histories ,",
    "we superimpose star formation bursts of random duration and amplitude to the continuous model defined in eq .",
    "we set the probability of a burst of star formation occurring at any random time in the previous 2  gyrs to 75% ; each burst can last between 30 and 300  myr , and the total mass of stars formed during the burst can have any random value between 0.1 and 100 times the mass formed by the underlying continuous sfh ( eq .  [ sfh ] ) .",
    "this ensures that we account for as wide a range of sfhs as possible using our simple parameterization ( including both starburst - like and more quiescently star - forming ) , which is crucial to sample all possible stellar ages and mass - to - light ratios in our analysis , and thus get the most robust constraints on these parameters for the observed galaxies .    in this context ,",
    "the ` age ' of a galaxy model is simply the time when the star formation history starts in our analytical parameterization and has no real physical meaning . in order to have a more reliable measure of the overall age of the stellar population in our galaxies , we define the ` mass - weighted age ' of each model as : @xmath45 where @xmath37 is the star formation history of each model , which is essentially @xmath46 ( eq .  [ sfh ] ) plus random bursts .",
    "the value of @xmath47 hence depends not only on the model age , but also strongly on the shape of the star formation history . in fig .",
    "[ priors](a ) , we plot the distribution of @xmath47 in our model library , that results from the different random sfhs and model ages included .",
    "we note that @xmath48-band light - weighted ages ( i.e. the ages of the stars dominating the rest - frame @xmath48-band light ) for the models in our library are typically lower than the mass - weighted ages , with @xmath49 .",
    "we define the current star formation rate ( sfr ) of each model as the average of the star formation history @xmath50 over the last 10  myr .",
    "we use the two - component model of @xcite to describe the attenuation of stellar emission at ultraviolet , optical and near - infrared wavelengths .",
    "this model accounts for the fact that young stars that are still inside their birth clouds are more dust - attenuated than intermediate - age and old stars in the diffuse ism . in practice , the effective optical depth in eq .",
    "[ llambda ] is described as : @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the effective attenuation optical depth of dust in stellar birth clouds , and @xmath53 is the effective attenuation optical depth in the diffuse ism . in practice ,",
    "the three free parameters of our dust attenuation model are the lifetime of stellar birth clouds @xmath54 , the effective ( i.e.  angle - averaged ) @xmath4-band optical depth seen by stars younger than @xmath54 in the birth clouds , and @xmath55 , the fraction of  seen by stars older than @xmath54 .",
    "we change the priors of these parameters compared to previous studies @xcite in order to reflect our uncertainty of stars / dust geometry and optical depth in high - redshift smgs and to ensure that we cover a broad parameter space .",
    "we allow for dust attenuation to reach higher values both in the stellar birth clouds and the diffuse ism , to account for the fact that smgs might be heavily optically - thick ( such as local ulirgs ; @xcite ) .",
    "the prior probability distribution for  is constant between 0 and 6 , and declines exponentially to a maximum of 20 ; for @xmath55 , we set the prior probability distribution to be a gaussian centered at 0.25 with 0.10 standard deviation .",
    "we let the lifetime of birth clouds @xmath54 vary between 5 and 50 myr  typically this was fixed at 10  myr @xcite ; since this is an unknown parameter and the ism conditions in smgs might be different than in moderately star - forming local galaxies ( e.g. higher densities , stronger stellar winds from the starburst ) , we vary this unknown parameter so that the spectral fitting solution marginalizes over a wide range of possible values .    even though our dust attenuation prescription is described by the three parameters described above , for simplicity and to allow for a more direct comparison with other studies , we also define , for each model , the resulting overall @xmath4-band dust attenuation as @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the emitted ( i.e. observed ) @xmath4-band luminosity , and @xmath58 is the intrinsic ( i.e. dust - free ) @xmath4-band luminosity of each model .",
    "the priors of , @xmath55 and @xmath54 described above result in the prior distribution for @xmath59 plotted in fig .",
    "[ priors](d ) .",
    "we include absorption by the intergalactic medium ( igm ) in our model seds , which strongly affects the rest - frame ultraviolet emission from high - redshift galaxies .",
    "to do so , we use the absorption prescription from @xcite , which includes lyman series line blanketing and lyman - continuum absorption . to account for different opacities along different lines of sight ( which reflect different distributions and properties of absorbers along the line of sight ) , we draw the igm effective absorption optical depth of each model @xmath60 from a gaussian distribution centered at the mean igm effective absorption absorption given in @xcite , @xmath61 , with a standard deviation of @xmath62 .",
    "we model the emission by dust from rest - frame mid - infrared to millimeter wavelengths using four main dust components as described in @xcite : ( i ) a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( pahs ) empirical template ; ( ii ) mid - infrared continuum from hot dust ; ( iii ) warm dust in thermal equilibrium ; and ( iv ) cold dust in thermal equilibrium .",
    "the dust components in thermal equilibrium emit as modified black bodies [ @xmath63 , with emissivity index @xmath64 fixed at 1.5 for the warm components and 2.0 for the cold components .",
    "the equilibrium of warm dust in stellar birth clouds @xmath65 is uniformly distributed in the range @xmath66  k , and the equilibrium temperature of cold dust in the ` diffuse ism ' @xmath67 is uniformly distributed in the range @xmath68  k. the relative contributions of these dust emission components to the total infrared luminosity are also free parameters of the model .",
    "we note that the detailed pah emission in smgs may be different from our adopted template , and there may even be variations of the pah emission between smgs , since the strength of different features depends on factors such as the intensity of the radiation field and metallicity ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "previous observations of the mid - infrared emission from @xmath69 smgs by @xcite show that their average mid - infrared spectrum is similar to that of local starbursts , which implies that our pah template is at least a good approximation .",
    "@xcite also find some variation of the ratios of different pah features from smg to smg that we are not able to reproduce using our fixed template , however due to the lack of data sampling the ( rest - frame ) mid - infrared emission for our smgs in detail , we would not be able to constrain that part of the spectrum , even if we included variation of the pah emission in our modelling . furthermore , while the shape of the pah emission in our model is fixed , the contribution of pahs to the total dust luminosity is allowed to vary , therefore the models include a range of overall pah emission strength . while this parameter itself can be hard to constrain in the absence of photometric data sampling the rest - frame mid - infrared , thanks to the mips 24-  data ( combined with the _ herschel _ and alma data which constrain the total infrared sed ) , we are able to loosely constrain the pah contribution for our galaxies .",
    "this contribution is typically less than 10% of the total infrared luminosity , and therefore uncertainties related to the pah template should not affect the energy balance significantly .",
    "even though our infrared seds contain multiple temperature components , for simplicity , and to make comparisons between galaxies easier , we define an average , _ luminosity - weighted dust temperature _ for each model as : @xmath70 where @xmath71 and @xmath72 are the fraction of total dust luminosity contributed by the ( birth cloud ) warm and ( diffuse ism ) cold dust components , respectively , and @xmath73 is the fraction of total dust luminosity contributed by the diffuse ism component ( which are all free parameters of the model ) . @xmath74 and @xmath75 are the fractional contribution and temperature of warm dust to the cool ism component , and are fixed at @xmath76 and @xmath77  k ( see model details in @xcite ) . by varying the temperatures and relative contributions of the warm and cold dust to the total dust emission , we obtain the distribution of average dust temperatures in our model library plotted in fig .",

    ", we also add radio emission to our seds by following the simple method described in @xcite , which essentially uses the radio / far - infrared correlation and fixed slopes for the thermal and non - thermal radio emission for each model ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "to summarize , we compute the radio emission as the sum of a thermal ( free - free emission ) component with spectral shape @xmath78 and a non - thermal component with shape @xmath79 .",
    "we fix the contribution of the thermal component to the 20-cm radio continuum at 10% , and scale the total radio emission of each model to the infrared luminosity using the local radio / far - infrared correlation @xmath80 i.e. the ratio between the far - infrared and the 1.4  ghz flux density .",
    "we draw the value of @xmath80 randomly for each model from a gaussian prior distribution centered at @xmath81 ( the local value ; @xcite ) , with a @xmath82 , in order to account for possible scatter in the radio / far - infrared correlation ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "a lack of strong redshift evolution of the radio / far - infrared correlation is supported by several studies ( e.g.  @xcite ) , and our fits ( e.g.  fig .",
    "[ fit_aless1 ] ) show that this assumption is sufficient to reproduce the observed 1.4  ghz flux of most aless sources detected in the radio .",

    "+ + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    we note that the sed models used in this study assume that the dominant source of dust heating is star formation , and do not include agn emission .",
    "this should not have a great impact in our analysis of the full sample for two main reasons .",
    "first , the fraction of agn in our smg sample is likely low , as shown by @xcite , who find that only 10 of the 91 aless smgs in the area covered by _",
    "chandra _ are x - ray sources , and 8 of those ( aless011.1 , aless017.1 , aless057.1 , aless066.1 , aless070.1 , aless073.1 , aless084.1 , aless114.2 ) are identified as agn .",
    "second , most of the parameters recovered by  are robust to agn contamination even when the agn contributes up to 75% of the ultraviolet - to - infrared emission , as shown in an independent study by @xcite .",
    "the parameter that suffers most uncertainty in the case of strong agn contamination is the stellar mass , which may be overestimated by  by up to 0.3  dex when the contribution of agn - heated dust to the near-/mid - infrared is the highest ( see @xcite for more details ) .",
    "an important feature of our model is that we combine the stellar emission ( attenuated by dust ) with the dust emission in a self - consistent way using a simple energy balance argument : that the energy absorbed by dust in stellar birth clouds and the diffuse ism ( @xmath83 and @xmath84 , respectively ) is re - radiated in the infrared .",
    "different combinations of physical parameters ( star formation histories , dust attenuation parameters ) can lead to the same absorbed energies @xmath83 and @xmath84 in a model galaxy , and these energies can be distributed in the infrared range in different ways depending on the parameters regulating the contribution and temperatures of the different dust components . in practice ,",

    "the large range of mass - to - light ratios with different star formation histories illustrates why we must marginalize over a wide range of sfhs in our sed fitting to get reliable stellar mass estimates .",
    "we find that the typical mass - weighted ages of our sample are less than 1  gyr ( the median for the sample is @xmath166  myr ) , which indicates that the stellar mass is not dominated by a significantly old stellar population ( with ages @xmath167  gyr ) as argued by @xcite .",

    "when doing so , it becomes clear that these galaxies must have a significant amount of ongoing star formation to power the large infrared luminosities , and even when allowing for models to have a significant fraction old stars ( our star formation history prior also includes models with early bursts / peaks of star formation , which have older mass - weighted ages ) , that is not what is preferred by the fitting in a statistical sense , i.e. the posterior likelihood distributions of the age are not peaking at the oldest ages allowed by the prior .",

    "on average , the typical aless source has a dust luminosity of @xmath177 , a dust mass of @xmath178 , and a luminosity - averaged dust temperature of @xmath179  k.    as previous other smg studies ( e.g.  @xcite ) , we find a correlation between the total dust luminosity and the average temperature of our sources ( plotted in fig .",
    "[ ldust_tdust ] ) .",
    "the measured dust temperatures in @xcite and @xcite are typically lower than our luminosity - averaged temperatures , but this could be simply because of the different temperature definition and/or the way the infrared seds are fitted ( as discussed in e.g.  @xcite ) . our luminosity - temperature correlation is broader than that observed for the smgs of @xcite and @xcite because our sample includes lower sub - millimeter flux sources thanks to the high sensitivity of alma . at fixed infrared luminosity , the deeper we go in sub - millimeter flux @xmath180 , the higher dust temperatures ( and lower dust mass ) we probe .",
    "this means that smgs only have very cold dust temperatures ( compared to local galaxies of similar infrared luminosity ) if we consider the sources detected at the highest sub - millimeter fluxes ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "we find a weak correlation between the total dust luminosity ( and the average dust temperature ) and the average @xmath4-band dust attenuation @xmath59 .",
    "if we divide our sample into sources with dust attenuation lower than the sample median ( i.e. @xmath181 ) and sources with dust attenuation higher than the sample median ( @xmath182 ) , we find that galaxies with the lowest @xmath59 have a median dust temperature @xmath183  k and a median dust luminosity @xmath184 , while the highest @xmath59 galaxies have a median dust temperature @xmath185  k and dust luminosity @xmath186 .",
    "while this is a very tentative result given the large error bars on our @xmath59 and @xmath187 estimates , it may indicate that , in more dust - obscured galaxies , dust is more effectively heated , presumably because of a more compact distribution of dust , i.e. the higher @xmath59 , the more concentrated dust grains are around the ( young ) stars , and so they see a stronger radiation field ( we return to this discussion in  [ section_average_seds ] ) . a better sampling of the seds ( possibly combined with known redshifts ) is needed to reduce the statistical error bars on these parameters in order to investigate this correlation in more detail .",
    "[ average_seds ]        [ average_seds_bright_faint ]        in this section we analyze the best - fit  ultraviolet - to - radio seds of our aless smgs . in fig .",
    "[ average_seds ] , we plot the best - fit model seds of all 99 main aless smgs in the rest - frame ( calculated using our photometric redshift for each smg ) , in observed flux units , highlighting the range of intrinsic seds of these sources .",
    "we obtain the ` average aless sed ' ( plotted in black in fig .  [ average_seds ] ) by computing the simple average flux @xmath188 of all the best - fit seds at each rest - frame wavelength ( weighting the average by infrared luminosity or sub - millimeter flux does not change the result )",
    ". we also plot , for comparison , the seds of two prototypical local starburst galaxies , arp220 ( a ulirg ) and m82 ( a dwarf starburst ) , the average sed of 16 local ulirgs from @xcite , and the @xmath189 sub - millimeter galaxy smmj2135 - 0102 ( the ` cosmic eyelash ' ; @xcite ) , all normalized such that their total infrared luminosity is the same as the median total infrared luminosity of the whole sample i.e. @xmath190 , at the median redshift @xmath191 .",
    "the spectral energy distribution of the average aless smg in the infrared ( @xmath192 ) follows closely that of arp220 ( with the exception of the 9.8-  silicate absorption feature that is included in the arp220 template but not in the  models ) . in the rest - frame ultraviolet",
    "to near - infrared range , both the arp220 template and the average local ulirg template are fainter and redder than the average aless smg , which could be due to a different stellar content and/or dust attenuation .",
    "this is consistent with high - redshift smgs being more massive and/or having a more extended dust distribution than local ulirgs .",
    "while arp220 may provide a suitable template for the ( rest - frame infrared ) dust emission of high - redshift smgs , caution must be taken when using this template to interpret or extrapolate their ( rest - frame uv - to - near - ir ) stellar emission .",
    "[ average_seds ] also shows that the average emission by aless smgs is very different from the starburst m82 , which shows hotter dust emission , significantly higher optical / near - infrared flux , and a redder stellar continuum .",
    "it is clear from this comparison that the full sed of high - redshift smgs is not simply a scaled - up version of a local starburst .",
    "interestingly , @xcite find that the mid - infrared spectral properties of smgs are similar to those of local starbursts , but due to the poor sampling of the rest - frame mid - infrared emission , we can not verify whether this is also the case for the aless smgs .    in fig .",
    "[ average_seds ] , we compare the average seds of our 77 optically - bright sources and our 22 optically - faint sources . not surprisingly , the ultraviolet - to - near - infrared emission of the optically - faint sample is significantly fainter ( about an order of magnitude ) than for the optically - bright sample , and the slope of the stellar continuum is also redder .",
    "this is consistent with the significantly higher inferred @xmath59 of these smgs as discussed in ",
    "[ section_faint ] .",
    "interestingly , the average infrared sed of these smgs peaks at shorter wavelength than the optically - bright average sed , which could indicate that these sources have on average higher dust temperatures . this tentative evidence for warmer dust in the optically - faint sources , combined with higher inferred dust attenuation @xmath59 may indicate that these galaxies are more compact than their optically - bright counterparts , which would increase the dust column ( hence higher @xmath59 ) and provide more effective dust heating by the stellar radiation field ( e.g.  @xcite ) .    to understand the variation of intrinsic seds of the 99 aless smgs , we plot , in fig .",
    "[ average_seds_bins ] , the average seds in different bins of ( a ) redshift , ( b ) observed alma 870-  flux , ( c ) average @xmath4-band dust attenuation @xmath59 , and ( d ) and total dust luminosity .",
    "we note that the scatter within each bin is large and in some cases larger than the difference between the bins , but nevertheless this is a useful way of understanding average variations of sed shapes as a function of different properties .",
    "a larger sample with more complete sampling of the seds for all sources is needed to perform a more quantitative statistical analysis .    fig .  [ average_seds_bins](a ) shows that the average intrinsic seds of the aless smgs are different depending on their redshift : as redshift increases , we select intrinsically brighter sources with that peak at lower wavelengths in the ( rest - frame ) infrared i.e. have warmer dust .",
    "[ average_seds_bins](b ) shows that the average intrinsic seds of smgs of different observed 870-  flux do not vary significantly : this does not mean that the seds do not vary within each flux bin , but rather that there is no systematic variation with sub - millimeter flux , i.e. we are not selecting a particular type of sed in different flux bins . if all we know about an smg is its 870-  flux and redshift , then the average aless sed is a fair approximation for its intrinsic sed regardless of its sub - millimeter flux . fig .",
    "[ average_seds_bins](c ) , illustrates how the average dust attenuation is a crucial parameter driving the variability of optical sed shapes in the aless sample ; as expected , as @xmath59 increases , the stellar continuum of the galaxies becomes systematically fainter and redder .",
    "we find that the infrared emission in different @xmath59 bins remains almost constant , with only a small increase of the total infrared luminosity and dust temperature towards higher @xmath59 .",
    "the fact that the infrared seds vary little with @xmath59 is a possible indication that the main difference between galaxies in these bins is viewing angle ( i.e.  galaxies with higher @xmath59 being observed more edge - on ) , since viewing angle does not affect the shape and normalization of the dust emission because it is isotropic ( for an illustration of the effect of viewing angle on seds computed using a radiative transfer code , see figure 8 of @xcite ) .",
    "the small observed variation in the shape and normalization of the dust emission in different bins ( in the sense that higher @xmath59 sources are on average slightly hotter and more infrared - luminous ) could be due to variations on the compactness of the sources , which as discussed above can be driving the difference between the seds of optically - bright and optically - faint sources . in this scenario , in more compact galaxies ,",
    "the dust column is higher ( hence higher @xmath59 ) , and the dust gets more effectively heated because it is closer to the heating source ( the stars ) and hence feels a stronger radiation field . in fig .",
    "[ average_seds_bins](d ) , we plot the average seds in bins of total dust luminosity .",
    "the peak of the dust emission shifts to lower wavelengths as the dust luminosity increases , which reflects the luminosity - temperature relation discussed in  [ section_dust ] .",
    "we also note that the average stellar continuum gets redder as the dust luminosity increases .",
    "this is mainly caused by the fact that the highest dust luminosity sources have higher stellar masses ( and thus stronger near - infrared stellar bumps ) and also , to a lesser extent , because they have slightly higher average @xmath59 .",
    "[ ms ]    in this section we discuss , based on our results for the physical properties of the aless smgs , how they compare with the ` normal ' galaxy population at their redshifts .",
    "the place occupied by smgs in the star formation rate vs. stellar mass plane is a subject of great ongoing discussion in the literature ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "some studies argue that smgs are extreme starbursts forming stars at much higher rates than other galaxies of the same stellar mass at the same redshift , implying that these intense starbursts have to be powered by extreme events such as major merger ( @xcite ) , while some cosmological simulations establish smgs simply as the high - mass end of the normal galaxy population , implying that whatever ` secular ' processes govern the star formation histories of fainter galaxies are also at play in the sub - millimeter bright population @xcite .",
    "our careful analysis of the star formation rate and stellar mass of the aless sample ( a complete and unbiased smg sample ) gives us a unique opportunity to address this question . in order to compare the aless smgs with the general galaxy population at their redshifts , in fig .",
    "[ ms ] we plot the star formation rates against stellar masses of our sources in two redshift bins ( @xmath193 and @xmath194 ) , and compare them with the ` star - forming main sequence ' ( i.e. the observed correlation between the stellar mass and the star formation rate of the general galaxy population ) at those redshifts .",
    "the exact slope , normalisation and redshift evolution of the main sequence still have large uncertainties and vary between studies ; here we chose the main sequence definition of @xcite , which is based on a compilation of different studies in the literature spanning a wide range of stellar masses and redshifts .",
    "we plot their main sequence relation at @xmath195 and @xmath196 as a grey solid line in the left- and right - hand panels of fig .",
    "[ ms ] , respectively .",
    "[ ms ] shows that , contrary to less - active galaxies in mass - selected samples , there is no strong correlation between the stellar masses and star formation rates of the aless sources at fixed redshift : this is because the sub - millimeter selection essentially selects in star formation rate .",
    "we find that , at @xmath8 , our smgs have on average @xmath197 and sfr@xmath198 , which implies that their specific star formation rate is about 0.7  dex lower than that of the ` average @xmath199 smg ' of @xcite ( plotted for comparison ) . with the relatively more modest specific sfrs of our smgs , we find that @xmath200 ( i.e.@xmath201% ) of them lie significantly above the main sequence at that redshift ( i.e. they have star formation rates over a factor of 3 higher than ` main sequence ' galaxies of the same stellar mass ) , while @xmath202 ( @xmath203% ) are consistent with being in the high - mass end of the main sequence . at higher",
    "redshift ( @xmath204 ) , the star formation rates and stellar masses of the smgs are typically higher than at @xmath8 , with @xmath205 and sfr@xmath206 on average .",
    "however , since the specific star formation rate of main sequence galaxies predicted by @xcite continues increasing with redshift , this means that a smaller fraction of our smgs lie significantly above the main sequence at those redshifts .",
    "we find that only @xmath207 smgs ( i.e.@xmath208% ) have sfrs at least 3 times higher than main sequence galaxies of the same stellar mass at the same redshift , with most smgs ( 73% ) being consistent with the main sequence .",
    "our results depend on how well the evolution of the star - forming main sequence with redshift is constrained .",
    "if the specific star formation of main sequence galaxies plateaus at @xmath209 as suggested by some studies ( e.g.  @xcite ) , then the fraction of high - redshift smgs that are significant outliers would increase .",
    "the wide stellar masses and positions with respect to the star - forming main sequence of the aless smgs may be an indication that these galaxies are not a uniform population ( as suggested by e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "in this paper we have presented an update of the  code that allows us to fit simultaneously the ultraviolet - to - radio seds of an unbiased sample of smgs from the aless survey .",
    "this new version of the code allows us to constrain photometric redshifts simultaneously with all other physical properties , and explores a realistic parameter space for high - redshift star - forming galaxies , including complex star formation histories , and a wide range of dust attenuation and emission parameters to include different possible dust contents and distributions .",
    "our main results are summarized as follows .    *",
    "our redshifts are consistent with the classic method of deriving photometric redshifts by fitting only the stellar emission ( i.e. no dust emission ) .",
    "our method improves the redshift constraints in the case of optically - faint sources for which optical observations are limited , by including information from infrared and radio wavelengths .",
    "an advantage of our method is that the uncertainty in photometric redshift is naturally included in the uncertainty in the intrinsic physical parameters of the galaxies such as the stellar mass , dust attenuation , dust luminosity , dust temperature and star formation rate ( and vice - versa ) .",
    "* we derive the median properties of the full sample of 99 aless smgs by has a median redshift @xmath210 , has a median stellar mass of @xmath211  , a star formation rate of @xmath212 , average @xmath4-band dust attenuation @xmath213 , total dust luminosity @xmath214  , total dust mass @xmath215  , and luminosity - averaged dust temperature @xmath216  k. these physical properties are very similar to the properties of local ulirgs @xcite . *",
    "we find that the 22 optically - faint aless smgs are likely to be at higher redshifts than the optically - bright sources , with a median photometric redshift of @xmath217 .",
    "our analysis of the likelihood distributions of the physical parameters of these galaxies indicates that they are consistent with having similar overall properties as the bright sources , except for significantly higher dust attenuation .",
    "this could indicate that these smgs are a population of high - redshift smgs that are either very compact or very edge - on compared to sources of similar sub - millimeter fluxes that are more optically - bright . * using our multi - wavelength sed fits , we provide new smg templates that should be more appropriate to interpret and/or extrapolate smg observations than current local galaxy templates .",
    "* when we compare the star formation rates and stellar masses of the aless smgs with the star formation main sequence at that redshift , we find that , at @xmath8 , about half of the smgs lie significantly above the main sequence ( with sfrs 3 times higher than main sequence galaxies of the same stellar mass ) , while the other half falls in the high - mass end of the main sequence . at higher redshifts ( @xmath9 ) ,",
    "the smgs tend to have higher sfrs and stellar masses than at @xmath8 , but if we include the evolution of the star - forming main sequence with redshift @xcite , we find that only about a third of the smgs can be considered extreme , high - sfr outliers .",
    "this suggests that the aless smgs are not a uniform population , including galaxies that may be extreme starbursts but also galaxies with sfrs that are similar to those of the general population of galaxies at the same redshift .",
    "however , in order to fully understand what this means in terms of the star formation mode of smgs , we need to more detailed information such as spatially - resolved imaging and spectroscopy ( to determine , for example , their dynamics and merging state ) , and we also need to understand the processes that drive the star - forming main sequence at high redshifts in more detail .    our method is designed to optimally extract as much information as possible on the physical properties of smgs ( or , more generally , any sample of high - redshift star - forming galaxies with a wide range of dust contents and properties ) using integrated multi - wavelength observations .",

    "<S> we explore how the average seds vary with different parameters ( redshift , sub - millimeter flux , dust attenuation and total infrared luminosity ) , and we provide a new set of smg templates that can be used to interpret other smg observations . to put the aless smgs into context </S>",

    "<S> we find that , at @xmath8 , about half of the smgs lie above the star - forming main sequence ( with star formation rates three times larger than normal galaxies of the same stellar mass ) , while half are consistent with being at the high - mass end of the main sequence . at higher redshifts ( @xmath9 ) , </S>",
    "<S> the smgs tend to have higher star formation rates and stellar masses , but the fraction of smgs that lie significantly above the main sequence decreases to less than a third . </S>"
