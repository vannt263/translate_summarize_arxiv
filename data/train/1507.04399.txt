    "lepton - nucleon elastic scattering is important both in theory and experiment .",
    "the use of polarization techniques has yielded much new information . in this paper , we study lepton - nucleon elastic scattering using the one - photon and one - scalar - boson exchange mechanism by considering all possible polarizations .",
    "the differential cross sections are calculated in a general reference frame .",
    "there are two applications of our results in this paper .",
    "the first one is searching for a new light scalar boson .",
    "the second one , using only the one - photon exchange contribution , is to provide new ways to measure the nucleon form factor : generalizing current techniques to measure the ratio @xmath1 and presenting a new method to separately measure @xmath2 and @xmath3 using polarized incoming and outgoing muons .",
    "the interest in a new light scalar boson arises from recent studies of the proton radius using the lamb shift in the @xmath4 transition in muonic hydrogen @xcite , the value of proton radius was reported to be 0.84087(39 ) fm , whereas the codata value @xcite 0.8775(51 ) fm is 7 standard deviation away .",
    "the major difference between these two reported data is that the former extracts the proton radius from muonic hydrogen and the latter from electronic hydrogen and electron - proton scattering experiments .",
    "although the different proton radius may arise due to subtle lepton - nucleon non - perturbative effects within the standard model @xcite , it could also be a signal of new physics caused by a violation of lepton universality .",
    "another candidate of new physics signal is the muon anomalous magnetic moment , which is defined as @xmath5 .",
    "the measurement at bnl @xcite differs from the standard model prediction by 3 to 4 standard deviations , and @xmath6 , respectively . ]",
    "@xmath7 the different values depending on the choice of lowest order hadronic contribution .",
    "this discrepancy is also possibly explained by new physics involving violation of lepton universality .",
    "it is known that a light scalar boson with mass around 1 mev is a candidate to explain both proton radius and muon anomalous magnetic moment puzzles simultaneously @xcite .",
    "the non - relativistic potential between lepton and nucleon caused by exchange of a scalar boson is written as @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the mass of the scalar boson ; @xmath10 and @xmath11 are scalar bosons coupling to lepton and nucleon , respectively .",
    "we adopt the constraints in @xcite that for @xmath12 mev @xmath13 so the potential of the scalar boson is suppressed by @xmath14 and an exponentially decay factor comparing with the coulomb potential .",
    "the fact that the potential of the scalar boson is intrinsically much smaller than the coulomb potential makes it hard to find the scalar boson .",
    "there could be other possible particles , however , most of them are ruled out , e.g. pseudoscalar and axial vector are ruled out by hyperfine splittings @xcite .",
    "there are proposals to search for the light scalar boson , such as a direct detection method @xcite . in this paper , we study the cross section of elastic lepton - nucleon scattering caused by one - photon and one - scalar - boson exchange . since the muon is much heavier than the electron , the lepton mass can not be neglected , as is done for electron - proton scattering .",
    "the two - photon exchange contribution is expected ( from perturbation expansion ) and measured to be at a few percent level compared with one - photon exchange ( ope ) @xcite .",
    "therefore , the effect of one - scalar - boson exchange must be greater than few percent of ope to be observed .",
    "we consider unpolarized and polarized elastic scattering cross sections .",
    "we find the following two cases that for certain kinematic regions where the effects of the scalar boson are dominant and potentially observable : electron - neutron cross section with incoming and outgoing electrons polarized , and muon - neutron cross section with incoming and outgoing neutrons polarized .",
    "there are several facilities that can measure the lepton - nucleon elastic scattering , for electron , such as jlab , and for muon , muse at psi and the j - parc muon facility . based on our results and the current experimental setup and capability @xcite ,",
    "although the polar angle resolution is sufficient , the kinematic region where scalar bosons may have significant effects is beyond the current polar angle measured range ; the electron - neutron scattering is more promising than muon - neutron scattering due to the high intensity of the electron flux .",
    "further estimates and discussions are in section [ sec : searching for phi_leptons polarized ] and [ sec : searching for phi_nucleons polarized ] .    the polarized cross section with one - photon exchange is used to measure the sachs form factors , @xmath15 and @xmath16 @xcite .",
    "the standard technique of measurement is using elastic electron - nucleon scattering using the following experiments : unpolarized rosenbluth separation @xcite , polarized lepton beam and nucleon target , and polarized lepton beam and recoil nucleon .",
    "the latter two experiments , using the ratio technique ( also known as polarization transfer method ) , were first developed in @xcite and later discussed in more detail in @xcite .",
    "we explore other possible ways to determine form factors by including lepton masses and other lepton polarization configurations different from conventional ones . in section [ sec :",
    "form factor ij ] , we generalize the current method to measure the ratio of form factors , @xmath1 , by including lepton mass , non - longitudinal lepton polarization , and more polarization configurations ( polarized one lepton and one nucleon , either they are incoming or outgoing ) . in section [ sec :",
    "form factor 13 ] , we present a new method to measure @xmath3 or @xmath2 directly for certain kinematic conditions in elastic muon - nucleon scattering cross section with polarized incoming and outgoing muons .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows . in section [ sec : setup ]",
    ", we set up the formalism needed to compute cross sections . in section [ sec : cross section ] , the cross sections are calculated in a general reference frame with all possible polarizations , and the massless lepton limit is slso discussed . in section",
    "[ sec : searching for a scalar boson ] , we show that there are two cases in which the scalar boson is potentially observable : electron - neutron cross section with incoming and outgoing electrons polarized , and muon - neutron cross section with incoming and outgoing neutrons polarized . in section [ sec : measuring form factors ] , comparing with the current method , we give a more general result for the ratio of form factors , @xmath1 , by including lepton mass , non - longitudinal lepton polarization , and more polarization configurations .",
    "we also discuss new measurements to selectively obtain the contribution from @xmath3 or @xmath2 in the cross section with polarized incoming and outgoing muons .",
    "a conclusion is presented in section [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "the elastic lepton - nucleon scattering process is denoted as @xmath17 where @xmath18 and @xmath19 stand for lepton and nucleon ; @xmath20 and @xmath21 are momentum and spin polarization ; the number 1 , 2 , 3 , and 4 label the incoming lepton , incoming nucleon , outgoing lepton , and outgoing nucleon .",
    "this notation is used throughout the entire paper . in the lowest order",
    ", we consider the interaction by exchanging a scalar boson or a photon between the lepton and the nucleon .",
    "there are three contributions to the cross section : one - photon exchange , one - scalar - boson exchange , and the interference terms .      in the nucleon rest frame ( lab frame )",

    "is given by @xmath44 where @xmath21 is the spin polarization which satisfies @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",

    "there are two important special cases . for transverse polarization @xmath58 , @xmath59 . for longitudinal polarization @xmath60 , @xmath61",
    "this is useful for a light lepton because if its mass is small compared with the beam energy , the light lepton is naturally longitudinally polarized .",
    "the massless lepton limit is important for electron scattering or the high energy limit . in general , naively taking @xmath62 in physical quantities does not give us the correct result ( see section [ sec : massless lepton ] below ) , because the longitudinal polarization ( [ eq : sl ] ) blows up .",

    "there is no contribution to cross section if only one particle is polarized in exchanging one - photon and one - scalar - boson .",
    "the reason is the following .",
    "the parity flips momentum and time reversal flips momentum and angular momentum .",
    "one can only flip spin polarization by combining parity and time reversal , and it is equivalent to change the overall sign of the polarization . therefore ,",
    "if the theory conserves @xmath89 , the spin asymmetry part can depend only on product of even number of spin polarizations to remain invariant under @xmath89 .",
    "for example , if we polarize three particles , there is no term depending on the product of all three polarizations , but there are terms depending on product of two polarizations , see section [ sec : fully polarized ] . on the other hand , one can consider an interaction which breaks time reversal to have an additional dependence on odd number of spin polarizations , such as exchanging a z boson . in conclusion , in exchanging a photon and a scalar boson , one needs to polarize at least two particles to have a spin dependent part .",
