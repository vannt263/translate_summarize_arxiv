    "there are several problems in different areas of theoretical physics that involve the study of boundary field theories , such as the kondo effect , quantum impurities in strongly correlated electron systems , the catalysis of baryon decay in the presence of magnetic monopoles ( callan - rubakov effect ) , and even black - hole evaporation , to name a few .",
    "therefore the study of boundary theories is more than an interesting exercise , and we should try to learn as much as possible about them",
    ". an especially interesting class of boundary field theories can be obtained by restricting 1 + 1-dimensional integrable field theories to the half - line while preserving integrability .",
    "a remarkable example is the boundary sine - gordon model @xcite , which has found very important applications @xcite in real physical systems in the past few years .",
    "in this paper we study one of the simplest two - dimensional models which has nonetheless a very rich structure , the tricritical ising model ( tim ) , in the presence of a boundary .",
    "the tim provides a useful venue to study many non - trivial aspects of two - dimensional quantum field theory such as superconformal invariance @xcite , renormalization group flows @xcite and exact s - matrices @xcite .    as a lattice model the tim can be realized as an ising model with annealed vacancies @xcite , with hamiltonian h= -j _ i , j _ i _ j - _ i ( _ i)^2 , [ ham ] where the first sum is performed over nearest neighbors , @xmath2 are the spin variables , @xmath3 is the chemical potential and @xmath4 is the energy of a configuration of a pair of unlike spins .",
    "this model has a critical point for some value of @xmath5 where three phases can coexist and to which can be associated @xcite a conformal field theory with central charge @xmath6 , corresponding both to the next simplest minimal model @xmath7 and to the simplest @xmath8 superconformal minimal model @xmath9 .",
    "this fact will be extremely useful in the following .    in @xcite zamolodchikov",
    "has shown that unitary minimal models can be associated to the infrared fixed point of some particular scalar field theories , having an effective landau - ginzburg ( lg ) description . to the @xmath10 model , with central charge @xmath11 , @xmath12 , one can associate the action s_lg = d^2 z  .",
    "[ lg ] there is also a lg description for the @xmath8 superconformal unitary minimal series @xmath13 , with central charge @xmath14 , @xmath15 , given by the action s_lg^n=1 = d^2 z d^2  , [ slg ] where the superfield @xmath16 written in components is @xmath17 , and the conformal dimensions for the fields @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 are @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 respectively .",
    "therefore the conformal theory associated to the tim can be studied as the critical point of a bosonic theory with a @xmath26 potential or as a @xmath8 supersymmetric theory with a @xmath27 potential .    any @xmath8 superconformal field theory ( scft )",
    "allows two different projections onto local field theories @xcite .",
    "this comes about in the following way .",
    "the fields in a scft can be divided in two types , neveu - schwarz ( ns ) and ramond ( r ) fields , depending on how they behave under rotations around the origin in the punctured plane .",
    "ns fields are periodic and r fields are antiperiodic .",
    "this means that the operators in the ns sector form a closed algebra under operator product expansions while the ones in the r sector do not .",
    "so if we project out the r fields we obtain a consistent local quantum field theory , which will be manifestly supersymmetric .",
    "another way of obtaining a consistent local theory is by projecting out the fermions , which is usually called the gso projection . this way we obtain what is usually called the spin model associated to the scft .",
    "the important observation is that for the tim we can associate each of the lg actions ( [ slg ] ) , ( [ lg ] ) to each of these local projections .",
    "as it was argued in @xcite , a minimal model perturbed by the @xmath0 operator gives an integrable theory . in the bosonic description ( [ lg ] ) the operator @xmath0 corresponds to @xmath28 , and in the manifestly supersymmetric description ( [ slg ] ) to the auxiliary field @xmath29 . in both descriptions the lg action can still be used off criticality as a guide to the solitonic structure of these massive deformations .",
    "an @xmath1-matrix based on this deformation of ( [ lg ] ) has been proposed in @xcite . in this paper",
    "we study the @xmath1-matrix proposed in @xcite , corresponding to the perturbed action s = d^2z d^2  , [ slgf ] which is manifestly supersymmetric . by looking at ( [ slgf ] ) in terms of components",
    "it can be argued that in this model there are solitonic and antisolitonic supersymmetric doublets , which we will denote by @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "due to the fact that multi - soliton configurations have to alternate solitons and anti - solitons , there is an adjacency condition to be respected by the allowed multi - particle states .    in this paper",
    "we study the factorized scattering theory associated to the action ( [ slgf ] ) in the presence of a boundary .",
    "some related work has been done by chim in @xcite ; he solved the boundary yang - baxter equation ( bybe ) for the @xmath1-matrix proposed in @xcite , where supersymmetry acts non - locally . in that case",
    "it is difficult to identify which reflection matrix corresponds to boundary supersymmetry preserving interactions .",
    "as we will see , in the present formulation this identification is done in a transparent way , due to the fact that we are dealing with a manifestly supersymmetric theory , where the supersymmetric charges act locally .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we discuss general aspects of two - dimensional integrable theories . in section 3",
    "we discuss the @xmath1-matrix proposed by fendley to describe the @xmath0 perturbation of the tim . in section 4",
    "we find the reflection matrices that preserve boundary supersymmetry . in section 5",
    "we solve the boundary yang - baxter equation , and find the general reflection matrices which preserve integrability but not necessarily supersymmetry , and relate these solutions to the solutions of section 4 in the appropriate limits . in section 6 we discuss the possible boundary interactions which preserve integrability and supersymmetry , and connect them with the reflections matrices we have obtained . in the last section we discuss our results and some possible extensions of this work .",
    "in this section we briefly review the main aspects of factorized scattering theories that will be needed in the rest of the paper . this section is meant mainly to set the notation . as a general reference for bulk integrable field theories in two - dimensions",

    "it is difficult to analyze supersymmetric boundary conditions , whereas in the present case it is quite natural .",
    "let us notice initially that in the massless bulk limit the topological charge in the supersymmetry algebra vanishes @xcite , and as a consequence we do not expect any difference between the saturated and non - saturated case from the point of view of deformed cft .",
    "after this preliminary remark , recall that in the bulk our model can be formulated as the massive deformation of the ns sector of @xmath138 by the relevant primary operator @xmath139 . in fact , the chiral ns superfield has two components , the energy operator and the sub - leading ( vacancy ) operator , @xmath140 the perturbation by @xmath141 preserves supersymmetry and the one by @xmath130 breaks it @xcite .",
    "a boundary field theory is defined by specifying the conformal boundary conditions ( cbcs ) and the boundary perturbation .",
    "it is well known @xcite that in minimal unitary ( super)conformal models the cbcs are in one - to - one correspondence with primary operators .",
    "this means that in the ns sector of @xmath138 , the possible cbcs that do not break superconformal invariance correspond to the primary superfields @xmath142 and @xmath139 . the cbcs determine the spectrum of allowed boundary operators @xcite and it turns out that in the first case the only boundary operators that can appear are the identity @xmath143 and the irrelevant operator @xmath144 , whereas in the second @xmath130 and @xmath141 .",
    "once we know the boundary operator content of a bcft we can study which ones will preserve boundary integrability .",
    "the argument of @xcite can be rephrased by saying @xcite that a boundary operator preserves integrability if it is in the same representation of the relevant conformal algebra as the bulk perturbation . in our case",
    "this means that the perturbation by the boundary superfield @xmath139 is integrable ; furthermore , the perturbation by @xmath130 breaks supersymmetry while the perturbation by @xmath141 preserves it , as it can be easily verified to first order in conformal perturbation theory .",
    "let us notice , finally , that from cardy s analysis @xcite ( see also @xcite ) it turns out that the free boundary conditions do not support the boundary operators @xmath130 and @xmath141 .",
    "a reasonable proposal is that the reflection matrices we obtained correspond to some sort of fixed boundary conditions perturbed respectively by the operators @xmath141 and @xmath130 .",
    "in this paper we have found the exact reflection matrices for the @xmath1-matrix proposed by fendley to describe the superfield sector of the tricritical ising model , where supersymmetry acts locally .",
    "supersymmetry fixes , almost completely , the structure of boundary scattering and predicts a universal ratio for the amplitudes of bosons and fermions scattering diagonally off the boundary .",
    "more explicitly , the requirement of boundary supersymmetry alone fixes @xmath145 , @xmath146 and establishes the precise relation between @xmath74 and @xmath75 .",
    "we also solved the bybe in general and we showed that it fixes @xmath145 , @xmath146 and that @xmath74 and @xmath75 should have the same functional form .",
    "we were able to connect some of theses solutions to the supersymmetry preserving ones .",
    "as a next step it would be interesting to compute correlation functions in this realization of the tim by means of the form - factor approach . a first step in the computation of supersymmetric form - factors has been done in the paper @xcite .    as a last remark we should mention that a thermodynamical bethe ansatz computation of finite - size effects would be very useful in order to confirm that this description in term of supersymmetric soliton doublet is the correct scattering theory for the massive excitations of the supersymmetric tim . in any case the necessity of introducing some cdd factors does not change the structure of our reflection matrices .",
    "we would like to thank g.  mussardo for a critical reading of the paper and for many valuable suggestions , p.  fendley for useful remarks concerning the @xmath1-matrix used in this paper and r.  musto for useful comments .",
    "one of us ( mm ) would like to thank k.  schoutens for discussions on related issues in an early stage of this work and lis for encouragement .",
    "in this appendix we discuss some subtleties in the boundary crossing - unitarity condition that arise in models with fermions .",
    "these are well understood , but since we have not found an explicit discussion in the literature about these issues , we will present it here .",
    "recall that the crossing symmetry property of the @xmath1-matrix can be written as s_ab^cd(i-)=c_bbs^bc_da()c^dd  , where @xmath147 is the charge conjugation matrix and @xmath148 is its inverse . from the crossing properties of our bulk @xmath1-matrix we find that the only non vanishing elements of the charge conjugation matrix can be chosen in the following way :      as it is well known @xcite , the reflection amplitude @xmath81 is the analytic continuation of the amplitude @xmath149 to the domain @xmath150 , @xmath151 . in models that are not invariant under charge conjugation ,",
    "the appropriate analytic continuation involves the charge conjugation matrix as follows : k^ab()=c^aar^b_a(- )  . in order to write down the boundary crossing - unitarity equation , without assuming we are dealing with a theory invariant under the usual discrete symmetries , we come back to the argument of ghoshal - zamolodchikov .",
    "the amplitude @xmath152 at positive real @xmath32 is the coefficient of the two - particle contribution in the expansion of the boundary state in terms of out states , |b=|0 , whereas at negative real @xmath32 it is interpreted as the two - particle contribution in the in states basis , |b=|0 .",
    "the boundary cross - unitarity condition is obtained as a consistency condition of these two expressions , using the fact that in and out states are related through the @xmath1-matrix : k^ab()=s_ab^ba(2)k^ab(- ) .",
    "notice the different ordering of indices with respect to equation ( 3.35 ) in @xcite , where invariance under charge conjugation , parity and time reversal were assumed .",
