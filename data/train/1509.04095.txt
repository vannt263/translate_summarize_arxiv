    "<S> how ferromagnetic phases emerge in itinerant systems is an outstanding problem in quantum magnetism . here </S>",
    "<S> we consider a repulsive two - component fermi gas confined in a two dimensional isotropic harmonic potential and subject to a large rashba spin - orbit ( so ) coupling , whose single - particle dispersion can be tailored by adjusting the so coupling strength . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the interplay among so coupling , correlation effects and mean - field repulsion leads to a competition between ferromagnetic and non - magnetic phases . at intermediate interaction strengths , </S>",
    "<S> ferromagnetic phase emerges which can be well described by the mean - field hartree - fock theory ; whereas at strong interaction strengths , a strongly correlated non - magnetic phase is favored due to the beyond - mean - field quantum correlation effects . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the ferromagnetic phase of this system possesses a chiral current density induced by the rashba spin - orbit coupling , whose experimental signature is investigated .    </S>",
    "<S> _ introduction  _ itinerant ferromagnetism represents an outstanding problem in many - body physics . </S>",
    "<S> based on stoner s argument , a fermionic system in continuum may become ferromagnetic when the repulsive interaction strength exceeds a critical value @xcite . in the context of a spin-1/2 fermi gas , ferromagnetism means that the two spin species tend to phase separate to form spin domains as such a configuration obviously reduces interaction energy . </S>",
    "<S> attempt to realize ferromagnetic state in repulsive fermi gas was made by the mit group in 2009 @xcite . although some indirect evidences were present , spin domain formation was not observed . </S>",
    "<S> later it was clarified that their system suffers from strong atom loss as the atoms tend to form tightly bound dimers , and ferromagnetism was therefore not expected @xcite . from perhaps a more fundamental point of view , even if a repulsive fermi gas is stable , it is not completely clear whether a ferromagnetic state will result . </S>",
    "<S> this is because the stoner s criterion is based on a mean - field argument , in which ferromagnetism arises once the mean - field repulsion overcomes the kinetic energy . </S>",
    "<S> however , it has been conjectured that , under strong repulsive interaction , the fermi gas may form a strongly correlated non - magnetic state @xcite that competes with the ferromagnetic state . here </S>",
    "<S> the quantum correlation effects , neglected in the mean - field argument , play a more dominant role . </S>",
    "<S> therefore whether itinerant ferromagnetic phases can exist in repulsive fermi gases remains as an open question .    in this letter , we show that itinerant ferromagnetism _ can exist _ in a repulsive fermi gas subject to spin - orbit ( so ) coupling @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> itinerant ferromagnetism is a consequence of the interplay among kinetic energy , mean - field repulsion between the spin species , and quantum correlation effects . </S>",
    "<S> the key here is that the so coupling significantly modifies the single - particle dispersion of the fermi gas such that a ferromagnetic state emerges without the need of a very strong repulsive interaction .    </S>",
    "<S> more specifically , we consider here a rashba so coupled repulsive two - component fermi gas confined in a two dimensional ( 2d ) isotropic harmonic potential . </S>",
    "<S> the trapping potential is necessary for any cold atom experiment as it provides atomic confinement . </S>",
    "<S> however , in the current situation , it plays an additional role : together with the rashba so coupling , it produces a landau level - like single - particle spectrum whose band flatness can be controlled by the so coupling strength @xcite , which as we will show is crucial for the existence of the itinerant ferromagnetic phases in our system . </S>",
    "<S> if the system consists of a single spin-1/2 particle , the physics is well understood . </S>",
    "<S> the ground state is represented by a half vortex state @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> an interesting feature of the system is that , under the limit of large so coupling strength , the single - particle spectrum exhibits landau level - like structure . in the case of an ensemble of spin-1/2 bosons , </S>",
    "<S> as previous works have shown @xcite , the near flat band structure leads to intriguing spin textures and strongly correlated phases . </S>",

    "<S> the dashed line represents the mean - field results which contains only two regimes : a non - magnetic phase below the dashed line and a ferromagnetic phase above the dashed line.,width=240 ]    to address this problem and to elucidate the relationship between ferromagnetism and interaction effects , we carried out a fully quantum mechnical exact diagonalization ( ed ) calculation combined with a mean - field hartree - fock calculation . </S>",
    "<S> these two complementary methods allow us to roughly divide the interaction effects into two parts : ( 1 ) it leads to a mean - field repulsion between the two spin species ; ( 2 ) it builds up quantum correlations in the system . </S>",
    "<S> we will show that the former favors ferromagnetism , whereas the latter has an opposite effect . </S>",

    "<S> by contrast , for an initial chiral ferromagnetic state , the whole cloud also undergoes an angular rotation , analogous to the scissors mode in a condensate with vortices @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> _ conclusion  _ in summary , we have shown that how the landau level - like band structure of a 2d rashba so coupled fermi gas , with a controllable band flatness , can be exploited to exhibit itinerant ferromagnetism . </S>",
    "<S> the near - flat band structure dramatically reduces the critical interaction strength required for the ferromagentic phase transition . </S>",
    "<S> we employed two complementary methods , the fully quantum ed method and the mean - field hf method , to investigate this problem . </S>",
    "<S> our calculation elucidates the interplay between the mean - field repulsion and the quantum correlation effects , and shows that the former favors while the latter tends to destroy ferromagnetism . </S>",
    "<S> the emergence and disappearance of the ferromagnetic phase result from the competition between these two factors . </S>",
    "<S> we have also shown that the ferromagnetic phase in our system is accompanied by a chiral density current resulting from the so coupling . </S>",
    "<S> this chiral density current and the spin texture that characterize the itinerant ferromagnetic state can be readily detected using today s cold atom techniques . </S>",
    "<S> we hope our work may open new avenues of research in both so coupling and itinerant magnetism in cold atoms .    finally , we comment that dresselhaus so coupling has recently been realized by the shanxi group @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the single - particle spectrum of a harmocally trapped 2d spin-1/2 particle remains exactly the same if the rashba so coupling is changed to the dresselhaus coupling . </S>",
    "<S> our results for the repulsive fermi gas remain essentially the same under dresselhaus coupling @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> , the trapping frequency along the @xmath6-axis is suddently changed from @xmath78 to @xmath79 , while that along the @xmath5-axis remains at @xmath78 . </S>",
