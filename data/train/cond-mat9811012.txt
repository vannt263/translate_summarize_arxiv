    "new experiments @xcite on condensed bose gases with oscillating trap potential permit the excitation of low - lying collective modes with given symmetry .",
    "the measurement of their excitation frequencies provides a good opportunity to analyze the applicability of different approximations and numerical approaches in many - body - theory .",
    "zero temperature calculations with different number of atoms in the condensate @xcite are in excellent agreement with the corresponding spectra measured in the jila - top @xcite and the mit trap @xcite .",
    "the frequently used starting point for the theoretical studies are the coupled bogoliubov equations .",
    "their eigenvalues can be determined numerically by expanding the solutions in a basis - set of orthonormal functions @xcite .",
    "analytical solutions of the bogoliubov equations have been obtained in the hydrodynamic limit by _ stringari _ @xcite and in @xcite .    for finite temperatures a possible and",
    "frequently used extension of the bogoliubov equations are the hartree - fock - bogoliubov equations with neglection of the anomalous expectation values , commonly referred to as hartree - fock - bogoliubov ( hfb)-popov equations @xcite . without their neglection",
    "the anomalous expectation values appearing in the self - consistent hartree - fock theory would lead to an unphysical energy gap of the collective modes in a spatially homogeneous bose - condensed system violating the hugenholtz - pines theorem @xcite . in a spatially inhomogeneous",
    "trapped bose - condensate the hugenholtz - pines theorem does not apply , but in this case the kohn - theorem @xcite would be violated , which states that the dipole excitations have the frequencies of the harmonic trap .",
    "the hfb - popov equations have been solved within the local density approximation @xcite , which is sufficient to determine the thermodynamic properties of the trapped bose - condensates . beyond that ,",
    "similar to the numerical method used in the case of the zero - temperature bogoliubov equations , the excitation spectra can be derived by an expansion in a basis set of eigenfunctions . _",
    "dodd et al . _",
    "@xcite present the numerical results together with the experimental data . for temperatures",
    "@xmath0 ( @xmath1 is the theoretical transition temperature for the ideal , trapped bose gas ) the calculated values differ by less than @xmath2 from the experiment . on the other hand ,",
    "it was also pointed out in @xcite that the same accuracy between numerics and experiment is already obtained by a much simpler approximation .",
    "the excitation spectra at finite temperatures are simply derived by a zero temperature calculation but with the number of atoms in the trap reduced to account for the thermal depletion .",
    "correspondingly , this solution is denoted as _ equivalent zero - temperature condensate _",
    "( ezc)-solution @xcite .    in the present paper",
    "we present a further numerical study of the hfb - popov equations with two aims : on the one hand we wish to calculate the excitation spectra by combining the use of a basis set expansion for the low - lying modes with the local density approximation for the high - lying modes beyond a suitably chosen energy cut - off .",
    "this eliminates truncation errors while keeping the discrete basis set of modes reasonably small , thereby speeding up our computation .",
    "the second aim then is to use this gain in efficiency for a more detailed check of the accuracy of the ezc - approximation in comparison with the hfb - popov approximation .",
    "in particular we shall provide a comparison for axially symmetric traps with arbitrary anisotropy both for low lying excitations and also for excitations at energies above the chemical potential .",
    "the hfb - popov mean - field theory for inhomogeneous dilute bose gases has been derived in detail by griffin in ref .",
    "we merely give a brief summary of the basic equations .",
    "the bose gases in the experiment are weakly interacting and dilute .",
    "therefore , the s - wave approximation @xmath3 is adequate to describe the interaction where @xmath4 and @xmath5 is the s - wave scattering length . to the bose field operator @xmath6 the usual decomposition @xcite in a @xmath7-number part plus an operator with vanishing expectation value",
    "is applied : @xmath8 .",
    "@xmath9 represents the condensate wave function and the operator @xmath10 the excitations of the condensate .",
    "this ansatz is inserted in the heisenberg equation of motion ( in units of @xmath11 ) : @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the trap potential ( @xmath14 the atomic mass and @xmath15 and @xmath16 the radial and axial trap frequencies ) . the statistical average over ( [ heq ] ) and the replacement of the cubic term @xmath17 by the average in mean - field approximation @xmath18 neglecting the anomalous expectation value @xmath19 and its complex conjugate leads to the generalized gross - pitaevskii ( gp ) equation in the hfb - popov approximation @xmath20\\phi(\\bbox{r } ) = 0\\ , .\\ ] ] here we introduced the local density of the condensate @xmath21 . the subtraction of equation ( [ gpe ] ) from ( [ heq ] ) and a treatment of the cubic terms within the mean - field theory similar to the one of equation ( [ gpe ] ) yields two coupled equations of motion for @xmath10 and its adjoint .",
    "we only state the final results after the insertion of the bogoliubov transformation @xcite : @xmath22 $ ] leading to the generalized bogoliubov equations for the generalized eigenfunctions @xmath23,@xmath24 and their corresponding eigenvalues @xmath25 : @xmath26 where @xmath27 with the total density @xmath28 .",
    "+ the number density of particles @xmath29 outside the condensate is given in terms of the thermal number of quasi - particles @xmath30 by    [ ben ] @xmath31    where @xmath23 , @xmath24 are normalized by @xmath32 .",
    "+ the coupled equations can either be solved by direct expansion of the solution in the basis set of the free trap potential as in @xcite or by using the local density approximation as in @xcite .",
    "the local density approximation is the leading order of a semiclassical approximation and amounts to setting @xmath33 where @xmath34 is defined by @xmath35 and @xmath36 , @xmath37 are normalized by + @xmath38 .",
    "+ in the semiclassical limit the functions @xmath39 and @xmath37 are slowly varying on the scale of the harmonic oscillator length @xmath40 with @xmath41 , and the derivatives of @xmath42 and @xmath43 as well as the second derivatives of @xmath34 are negligible . the equations in ( [ beq ] )",
    "are then reduced to the algebraic form    @xmath44    the solution is straight - forward and we are led to the excitation spectrum @xmath45 with the hartree - fock energy @xmath46 . the non - condensate density is then obtained by a simple integration over the momenta : @xmath47   \\theta(\\epsilon^2_{\\text{hf}}(\\bbox{p},\\bbox{r})-g^2n_c^2(\\bbox{r } ) ) \\,\\,\\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] let us first consider the case where the local density approximation is used for the whole excitation spectrum , not only the high - lying part .",
    "then it is necessary for consistency to treat also the condensate in the corresponding approximation , which is the finite - temperature thomas - fermi approximation .",
    "it applies to sufficiently large condensates . in this case",
    "the kinetic energy term in eq.([gpe ] ) is neglected and one obtains with @xmath48 @xmath49 and hence @xmath50 reduces to @xmath51 inside the condensate the excitation energy is then gapless like in the spatially homogeneous case .",
    "moreover the integrand in ( [ ntlda ] ) for @xmath52 inside the condensate and @xmath53 becomes @xmath54 and therefore the integral ( [ ntlda ] ) converges for small @xmath55 ( besides , of course , converging also for large @xmath55 ) .    on the other hand ,",
    "even if the thomas - fermi approximation for the condensate is not applicable because the condensate is to small one may still apply the semiclassical local density approximation for sufficiently high lying states .",
    "but for the low - lying states the local density approximation is then inconsistent , as can e.g. be seen from the fact that @xmath50 inside the condensate now has a gap for @xmath53 of size @xmath56 in space points @xmath52 where @xmath57 .",
    "therefore , one has to introduce an energy cut - off @xmath58 in this case , below which the excitations are treated by solving eqs.([beq ] ) exactly , expanding in a suitable basis , and above which the local density approximation can still be employed . then eq.([ntlda ] ) is replaced by @xmath59 where @xmath60 and @xmath61    it is our goal here to implement this hybrid procedure .",
    "the choice of the energy cut - off depends on the purpose of the calculation . if the aim is the calculation of thermodynamic properties requiring only the density of states it is sufficient to take the energy cut - off low at an energy of a few @xmath62 , and to restrict the discrete part of the sum over states to only very few discrete modes .",
    "if on the other hand the goal is to calculate the mode spectrum of the low - lying modes accurately up to a given energy , then this energy determines the cut - off .",
    "however , the employed basis set must then still be chosen considerably larger ( in practice about twice as large ) than the number of discrete modes to be calculated , in order to make sure that no discrete mode below the cut - off is missed . in this way it is ensured that eq .",
    "( [ ntldana ] ) really gives an accurate value of the particle density outside the condensate .",
    "the advantage of our hybrid approximation over the hitherto used simple cut - off of the employed basis set is that the truncation error in @xmath29 is avoided , which allows us the use of a smaller basis set and therefore a more economical computation .",
    "the self - consistent procedure we use combines and extends previously used methods of ref .",
    "for a given number of atoms , temperature and anisotropy of the trap we start e.g. with @xmath63 or a previously determined better estimate for @xmath64 , solve eq.([gpe ] ) for @xmath9 , @xmath65 and @xmath66 from the condition that @xmath67 , solve then eq.([beq ] ) for all states up to the chosen energy cut - off to find @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 , and determine finally an improved value for @xmath29 from eqs.([ntldana ] ) , ( [ ntldanb ] ) .    to calculate the second term in eq.([ntldana ] )",
    "it is necessary to introduce a finite region in space , where we perform the energy integral at certain points . due to the axial symmetry of our problem",
    "this finite region is a rectangle in the @xmath68 and @xmath69 plane .",
    "this rectangle is chosen in such a way that @xmath29 and @xmath70 fall fast enough to zero approaching the edges .",
    "in this rectangle we introduce a fine grid and the energy integrals are performed at every grid point numerically . since both , @xmath70 and @xmath29 are smoothly varying functions the grid methods are suitable from the numerical point of view .",
    "we use the same grid in solving the gross - pitaevskii eq.([gpe ] ) . to reach fast convergence for the solution of ( [ gpe ] ) we apply the newton - raphson algorithm in combination with multigrid methods as discussed in ref .",
    ".    however , the grid methods are not appropriate in determining the solutions of eq.([beq ] ) especially for the high - lying states .",
    "for this reason we solve the bogoliubov - equations in the basis of the eigenfunctions of the free trap . in this basis",
    "we only need to calculate numerically the matrix elements of @xmath71 , @xmath72 in harmonic oscillator eigenstates .",
    "these matrix elements are decaying fast enough , because these quantities are smooth and localized around the origin .",
    "for our purposes the best method to solve ( [ beq ] ) in our basis is that of hutchinson et al .",
    "then we do not have to introduce a basis for @xmath73 and @xmath74 separately , a single basis set is enough but two subsequent diagonalizations must be performed . for further details see @xcite .",
    "we shall now discuss some results obtained by the procedure described in the previous section . in the calculations we present here we choose @xmath75 rubidium atoms and @xmath76 where @xmath77 is the critical temperature of an ideal bose - gas with the same parameters .",
    "the anisotropy of the trap is described by the parameter @xmath78 where @xmath79 is fixed to @xmath80 hz . as a check on our code we reproduced and confirm the zero - temperature results for the low - lying excitation spectrum as a function of the anisotropy parameter presented in fig.1 of ref.@xcite",
    ". a further check on our code , now at finite temperature , is the agreement of our results for the low - lying excitation spectrum as a function of temperature for the special anisotropy of the jila - top trap with the results in @xcite .",
    "let us now turn to our own results . in fig .",
    "[ fdnde ] we fix @xmath81 at @xmath82 and plot the spectral distribution @xmath83 of the particles in the trap over energy @xmath84 in units of @xmath15 . thus @xmath85 is the number of atoms with energy @xmath84 in the interval @xmath86 . in fig .",
    "[ fdnde ] we compare the spectral distribution    [ gs ] @xmath87 obtained in the local density approximation with @xmath88 from eq.([ntldanc ] ) ( full line ) , with the spectral distribution @xmath89    obtained from the low - lying discrete modes by folding @xmath90 ( [ ntldanb ] ) with a gaussian of variance @xmath91 .",
    "some smoothing on the quantum scale is necessary for a meaningfull comparison .",
    "the energy cut - off was chosen at @xmath92 , which is the reason for the fall - off of @xmath93 at around this energy .",
    "it can be seen that the local density approximation is rather good for energies somewhat above the chemical potential and higher . for energies at @xmath66 or lower the local density approximation increasingly fails and the spectral distribution from the discrete modes must be used .",
    "the oscillations by which @xmath94 differs from @xmath95 may be understood semiclassically @xcite by analysing the short periodic orbits of the classical dynamics generated by the hamiltonian @xmath96 @xcite .",
    "next we discuss results for the excitation spectrum at temperature @xmath97 as a function of the anisotropy parameter @xmath81 .",
    "we use the same parameter values as chosen in ref.@xcite where the excitation spectrum for the special value of @xmath82 of the jila - top trap was presented .",
    "this case is therefore contained in our results . in fig .",
    "[ fmu ] we show the behavior of the chemical potential @xmath66 for @xmath75 atoms as a function of @xmath81 . in the vicinity of the limiting cases @xmath98 the chemical potential changes rapidly and is expected to tend towards the groundstate energies of the free trap .",
    "the parity quantum number and the azimuthal quantum number @xmath14 are good quantum numbers for axially symmetric harmonic traps . on figs .",
    "[ fevev]-[fodev ] we show the elementary excitations as a function of @xmath81 for different parity classes and @xmath14 . for clarity only the excitation spectra with the quantum numbers @xmath99 are presented . on figures  [ fevod ] and [ fodev ]",
    "the lowest curves show the behavior of the center of mass modes , for odd parity with @xmath100 and for even parity with @xmath101 .",
    "they represent the collective oscillations of the atoms with the harmonic frequencies of the free trap @xmath16 and @xmath15 . by kohn s theorem",
    "@xcite they must occur in all finite temperature spectra and would be straight lines in our pictures . from our numerical data",
    "we see that kohn s theorem is not exactly maintained in the hfb - popov approximation , but the discrepancy for all anisotropies is so small , that it is practically negligible at @xmath102 . in the excitation spectra ( figs .  [ fevev]-[fodev ] ) modes with different axial quantum numbers @xmath14 cross freely as one would expect if ( [ beq ] ) is considered as a linear set of eigenvalue equations . however , due to the coupling of these equations via @xmath29 , which depends on the @xmath103 and the @xmath104 , the linearity is actually broken for finite temperature .",
    "but the nonlinearity enters only via a global coupling .",
    "therefore , in discussing the crossings of levels we may consider @xmath105 and @xmath70 as given by their final self - consistent values in which case ( [ beq ] ) does become linear explaining the free level - crossings for different quantum numbers @xmath14 .",
    "some avoided crossings between levels with the same @xmath14 can also be seen in these figures .",
    "a remarkable feature of the above spectra is that the levels tend to a few common eigenvalues in the limits @xmath106 or @xmath107 . in the first case ( @xmath108 ) @xmath15 goes to zero and",
    "the limiting energy eigenvalues do not depend on the azimuthal quantum number @xmath14 but still on the parity . in the opposite case ( @xmath109 ) they now depend on @xmath14 but not on the parity .",
    "however , in the limit @xmath108 the spectra agree with that of the free harmonic oscillator with @xmath110 .",
    "this fact can be easily understood because both , the condensate and the thermal density vanish due to the repulsion between particles and the vanishing confinement in radial direction .",
    "the same argument can be applied for @xmath109 with vanishing confinement in the @xmath69-direction . however , in the close neighborhood of @xmath109 some quantities ( see for example the behavior of the chemical potential in fig .",
    "[ fmu ] ) change too rapidly and it is extremely difficult to get reliable data for the spectra in that region .",
    "note that the limiting situations are quite different from those studied by stringari @xcite ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite ) under the conditions that the hydrodynamic approach is applicable , though some features are common .",
    "the low - lying excitation spectrum as a function of the anisotropy parameter for zero temperature has been presented by _",
    "hutchinson et al _ @xcite .",
    "the results are remarkably similar to ours considering the widely different physical conditions under which they are obtained .",
    "the similarity of the results of finite temperature calculations in the hfb - popov approximation to zero - temperature results was first noted by _",
    "dodd et al _ @xcite . for anisotropy @xmath82 they compared their results with an effective zero - temperature calculation ( ezc ) , where @xmath111 , using as effective particle number @xmath112 the number of particles in the actual condensate at temperature @xmath113 .",
    "the close agreement they found led to the conclusion that in practice the excitation spectra are determined mainly by the atoms in the condensate , so that the thermal density @xmath29 can be neglected in the gp and the bogoliubov equations ( [ gpe ] ) and ( [ beq ] ) .",
    "furthermore , at least for the high - lying excitations @xcite @xmath114 can be set to zero in ( [ beq ] ) @xcite and the equations ( [ beq ] ) reduce to an ordinary schrdinger equation .",
    "we can now use our result for arbitrary values of @xmath81 and looking also at higher lying excitation energies to provide a much more sensitive test of the accuracy of the ezc model .    in fig .",
    "[ fezc ] we present the low - lying ezc mode spectra for the same case as in fig .  [ fevev ] . in the ezc approximation",
    "the kohn - theorem is satisfied exactly , as there is no thermal cloud in the effective zero - temperature system .",
    "the excellent agreement with the hfb - popov results , even in fine details , over the whole interval of anisotropies confirms the remarkable usefulness of the ezc approximation for the calculation of the low - lying excitation spectrum .",
    "however , considering a broader range of energies one can find differences between the predictions of the hfb - popov and the ezc - calculations . in order to make a quantitative comparison we fix the anisotropy parameter @xmath81 in fig .",
    "[ fcom ] to the value of the jila trap @xmath82 .",
    "here we plot the energy - differences between the hfbp- and the ezc - calculations @xmath115 and between the hfbp- and the hartree - fock - calculations @xmath116 as a function of the hfbp - excitation energies .",
    "at very low energies @xmath117 is very small confirming again that in the low - lying spectra ezc levels agree with the hfb - popov levels . with increasing energy",
    "the ezc reveals an increasing shift and @xmath118 shows larger fluctuations .",
    "the difference between the eigenvalues is less than @xmath119 .",
    "it is not too big , but shows clearly the magnitude of the difference between the two calculations . for energies above twice the chemical potential the hartree - fock model ( @xmath120 neglected , but including the thermal density @xmath64 ) turns out to be a better approximation for the hfb - popov equations . the shift for large energies can be understood in the following way : there is a shift in the chemical potential @xmath121 because of the neglection of the almost constant thermal density in the condensate region in the ezc . considering only small energies",
    "the eigenmodes are localized inside the condensate where the term @xmath122 and the chemical potential shift cancel each other .",
    "therefore the energy difference @xmath117 is small for low energies .",
    "but for states localized outside , where even @xmath64 is negligible the difference @xmath123 is the main reason for the shift of the levels in the ezc calculations .",
    "the fig .",
    "[ fcom ] is in accord with the expectation that the assymptotic limit of the energy shift is @xmath123 .",
    "we have investigated the hartree - fock - bogoliubov - popov equations to obtain the finite temperature excitation spectrum of trapped condensed bose gases .",
    "our computational method combined the use of the local density approximation above a certain cut - off and a solution of the discrete bogoliubov equations below the energy cut - off .",
    "we have explored in a systematic way the excitation frequencies within a large range of parameters for the anisotropy of the trap potential .",
    "we gave numerical evidence for degeneracies occuring at extreme anisotropic situations @xmath124 and argued that these two spectra can be explained by the non - interacting model .",
    "further we compared the spectra of the hfb - popov with the ezc calculations and showed that for large energies the ezc spectra are shifted by a small amount which is mainly due to the shift in the chemical potentials .",
