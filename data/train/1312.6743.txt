    "the range of mobile services available to consumers and businesses is growing rapidly , along with the range of devices used to access these services .",
    "such heterogeneity in both hardware and traffic requirements requires maximum flexibility in all layers of the protocol stack , starting with the physical layer ( phy ) .",
    "orthogonal frequency division multiple access ( ofdma ) , which is based on multi - carrier transmission and enables low - complexity equalization of the inter - symbol interference ( isi ) caused by frequency selective channels , is one promising phy solution and has been adopted in various wireless communication standards , e.g. , wimax and 3gpp lte @xcite .",
    "however , the complexity of ofdma and other features that enable heterogeneous high - rate services leads to increased energy consumption , and hence increased greenhouse gas emissions and operational expenditure .",
    "green radio ( gr ) , which emphasizes improvement in energy efficiency ( ee ) in bits / joule rather than spectral efficiency ( se ) in bits / sec / hz in wireless networks , has thus become increasingly important and has attracted widespread interest recently @xcite .",
    "prior to the relatively recent emphasis on ee , the research on ofdma based wireless networks has mainly focused on dynamic resource allocation , which includes dynamic subcarrier ( sc ) and power allocation , and/or data rate adaptation , for the purposes of either maximizing the throughput @xcite or minimizing the transmit power @xcite .",
    "the authors in @xcite first considered the problem of power minimization in ofdma , through adaptive sc and power allocation , subject to transmit power and mts individual rate constraints .",
    "a time sharing factor , taking values within the interval @xmath0 $ ] , was introduced to relax the original problem to a convex problem , which can then be efficiently solved .",
    "the throughput maximization problem for ofdma can be more generally formulated as a utility maximization problem @xcite .",
    "for example , if the utility function is the network sum - throughput itself , then the maximum value is achieved with each sc being assigned to the mt with the largest channel gain together with the water - filling power allocation over scs @xcite .",
    "this work has been extended to the case of rate proportional fair scheduling in @xcite .",
    "the lagrange dual decomposition method @xcite was proposed in @xcite to provide an efficient algorithm for solving ofdma based resource allocation problems .",
    "although there has been no proof yet for the optimality of the solution by the dual decomposition method , it was shown in @xcite that with a practical number of scs , the duality gap is virtually zero .",
    "recently , there has been an upsurge of interest in ee optimization for ofdma based networks @xcite . since",
    "energy scarcity is more severe at mobile terminals ( mts ) , due to the limited capacity of batteries , energy - efficient design for ofdma networks was first considered under the uplink setup @xcite .",
    "the sum of mts individual ees , each defined as the ratio of the achievable rate to the corresponding mt s power consumption , is maximized considering both the circuit and transmit power ( termed the total power consumption in the sequel ) .",
    "ee maximization for ofdma downlink transmissions has been studied in @xcite .",
    "a generalized ee , i.e. , the weighted - sum rate divided by the total power consumption , was maximized in @xcite under prescribed user rate constraints . instead of modeling circuit power as a constant ,",
    "the authors in @xcite proposed a model of rate - dependent circuit power , in the context of ee maximization , since larger circuit power is generally required to support a higher data rate .",
    "it is worth noting that most of the existing work on ee - based resource allocation for ofdma has only considered transmitter - side energy consumption .",
    "however , in an ofdma downlink , energy consumption at the receivers of mts is also an important issue given the limited power supply of mts .",
    "therefore , it is interesting to design resource allocation schemes that prolong the operation time of mts by minimizing their energy usage .",
    "since the energy consumption at the receivers is roughly independent of the data rate and merely dependent on the active time of the mt @xcite , the dominant circuit power consumption at mts should be considered . consequently",
    ", fast transmission is more beneficial for reducing the circuit energy consumption at the receivers .",
    "a similar idea has also been employed in a recent work @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we propose to characterize the tradeoffs in minimizing the bs s versus mts energy consumption in multiuser ofdm based downlink transmission by investigating a weighted - sum transmitter and receiver joint energy minimization ( wstremin ) problem , subject to the given transmission power constraint at the bs and data requirements of individual mts .",
    "we assume that each sc can only be allocated to one mt at each time , but can be shared among different mts over time , a channel allocation scheme that we refer to as sc time sharing .",
    "therefore , optimal transmission scheduling at the bs involves determining the time sharing factors and the transmit power allocations over the scs for all mts .    to obtain useful insights into the optimal energy consumption for the bs and mts , we first consider two extreme cases separately , i.e. , the weighted - sum receiver - side energy minimization ( wsremin ) for mts and transmitter - side energy minimization ( temin ) for the bs .",
    "it is shown that dynamic tdma ( d - tdma ) as illustrated in fig . [",
    "fig : schemeexample](a ) , where mts are scheduled in orthogonal time slots for transmission , is the optimal strategy for wsremin at mts .",
    "intuitively , this is because d - tdma minimizes the receiving time of individual mts given their data requirements .",
    "in contrast , ofdma as shown in fig . [",
    "fig : schemeexample](b ) is proven to be optimal for temin at the bs .",
    "it is observed that transmitter - side energy and weighted - sum receive energy consumptions can not be minimized at the same time in general due to different optimal transmission schemes , and there exists a tradeoff between the energy consumption of the bs and mts . to obtain more flexible energy consumption tradeoffs between the bs and mts for wstremin and inspired by the results from the two extreme cases ,",
    "we further propose a new multiple access scheme , i.e. , time - slotted ofdma ( ts - ofdma ) scheme as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : schemeexample](c ) , in which mts are grouped into orthogonal time slots with ofdma applied when multiple users are assigned to the same time slot .",
    "ts - ofdma can be shown to include both the d - tdma and ofdma as special cases .",

    "section [ sec : wsre ] and section [ sec : te ] then study the two extreme cases of wsremin and temin , respectively . section [ sec : wse ] introduces the general wstremin problem and proposes the ts - ofdma transmission scheme to achieve various energy consumption tradeoffs between the bs and mts . in section [ sec : delay ] , we discuss how the obtained results can be extended to the case when a maximum time constraint is imposed on the transmission .",
    "section [ sec : numerical ] shows numerical results . finally section [ sec : conclusion ] concludes the paper .",
    "consider a multiuser ofdm - based downlink transmission system consisting of one bs , @xmath1 orthogonal subcarriers ( scs ) each with a bandwidth of @xmath2 hz , and @xmath3 mts .",
    "let @xmath4 and @xmath5 denote the sets of mts and scs , respectively .",
    "we assume that each sc can be assigned to at most one mt at any given time , but the sc assignment is allowed to be shared among mts over time , i.e. , sc time sharing .",
    "we also assume that the noise at the receiver of each mt is modeled by an additive white gaussian noise ( awgn ) with one - sided power spectrum density denoted by @xmath6 .",
    "let @xmath7 be the transmit power allocated to mt @xmath8 in sc @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , and @xmath12 be the achievable rate of mt @xmath8 at sc @xmath9 in the downlink .",
    "then it follows that @xmath13 where @xmath14 accounts for the gap from the channel capacity due to practical modulation and coding , and @xmath15 is the channel power gain from the bs to mt @xmath8 at sc @xmath9 , which is assumed to be perfectly known at both the bs and mt @xmath8 .    with time sharing of scs among mts , @xmath16 , dubbed the time sharing factor ,",
    "is introduced to represent the fraction of time that sc @xmath9 is assigned to mt @xmath8 , where @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 , @xmath20 .",
    "let @xmath21 denote the total transmission time for our proposed scheduling .",
    "the amount of information bits delivered to mt @xmath8 over time @xmath21 is thus given by @xmath22 the average transmit power is given by @xmath23 we assume that @xmath24 bits of data need to be delivered from the bs to mt @xmath8 over a slot duration @xmath21 for the time slot of interest .",
    "then the following constraint must be satisfied : @xmath25    we further assume that the receiver of each mt is turned on only when the bs starts to send the data it requires , which can be at any time within the time slot , and that it is turned off right after all @xmath24 bits of data are received .",
    "let @xmath26 , @xmath27 , denote the `` on '' period of mt @xmath8 .",
    "it is observed that the following inequalities must hold for all mts : @xmath28 the origin of this inequality can be understood from fig .",
    "[ fig : systemmodel ] , where mt @xmath8 is turned on and then off within the time interval @xmath21 .",
    "= 0.7     energy consumption at the bs in general comprises two major parts : transmit power @xmath29 and a constant power @xmath30 accounting for all non - transmission related energy consumption due to e.g. processing circuits and cooling .",
    "consequently , the total energy consumed by the bs over duration @xmath21 , denoted by @xmath31 , can be modeled as @xmath32    on the other hand , the power consumption at the receiver of each mt is assumed to be constant @xcite , denoted by @xmath33 , when it is in the `` on '' period receiving data from the bs .",
    "otherwise , if the receiver does not receive any data from the bs , its consumed power is in general negligibly small and thus is assumed to be zero .",
    "hence , the receiver energy consumed by each mt @xmath8 over @xmath21 , denoted by @xmath34 , can be approximately modeled as @xmath35 in general , each mt can be in a different state of energy depletion , and thus it is sensible to define a weighted - sum receiver - side energy ( wsre ) consumption of all mts as @xmath36 where a larger weight @xmath37 reflects the higher priority of mt @xmath8 in terms of energy minimization .",
    "it is assumed that all channels @xmath15 s are constant over the total transmission time of a frame , @xmath21 .",
    "while in theory the optimal @xmath21 is unbounded , for a practical number of bits to be transmitted per frame , @xmath24 s , and practical transmit power levels @xmath30 and @xmath33 , the designed optimal @xmath21 will be finite and in fact usually quite small . if we consider low - mobility and/or short frame lengths , then the assumption of a static channel over an indeterminate @xmath21 is valid .",
    "however , in section [ sec : delay ] , we provide detailed discussions on how the obtained results in this paper can be extended to the case when an explicit maximum transmission time constraint is imposed .",
    "we aim to characterize the tradeoffs in minimizing the bs s versus mts energy consumption , i.e. , @xmath31 versus @xmath34 s , in multiuser ofdm based downlink transmission by investigating a weighted - sum transmitter and receiver joint energy minimization ( wstremin ) problem , which is formulated as @xmath38 where @xmath39 is an additional weight assigned to the bs , which controls the resulting minimum energy consumption of the bs as compared to those of mts .",
    "notice that the design variables in the above problem include the power allocation @xmath7 , time sharing factor @xmath16 , as well as transmission time @xmath21 , while the constraints in ( [ eq : wstremin c1 ] ) are to limit the total transmission time at each sc to be within @xmath21 , those in ( [ eq : wstremin c2 ] ) are for the data requirements of different mts , and that in ( [ eq : wstremin c3 ] ) specifies the average transmit power at bs , denoted by @xmath40 .",
    "the main difficulty in solving problem ( wstremin ) lies in the absence of a functional relationship among @xmath26 , @xmath16 s and @xmath21 with the inequality in ( [ eq : lower bound of on time ] ) being the only known expression that links the three variables . minimizing over the upper bound of each mt s energy consumption , i.e. , @xmath41 , which could be quite loose as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : systemmodel ] , may result in conservative or energy - inefficient solution .    in order to obtain useful insights into the optimal energy consumption for the bs and mts , we first consider two extreme cases separately in the following two sections , i.e. , wsre minimization ( wsremin ) corresponding to the case of @xmath42 in section [ sec : wsre ] and transmitter - side energy minimization ( temin ) corresponding to the case of @xmath43 , respectively , in section [ sec : te ] .",
    "compared with problem ( wstremin ) , problems ( wsremin ) and ( temin ) have exactly the same set of constraints but different objective functions .",
    "we will illustrate how problem ( wstremin ) may be practically solved based on the results from the the two extreme cases in section [ sec : wse ] .",
    "problem ( wstremin ) could have an alternative interpretation by properly setting the energy consumption weights @xmath39 and @xmath37 s .",
    "suppose @xmath39 and @xmath37 represent the unit cost of consumed energy at the bs and mt @xmath8 , respectively . since mts are usually powered by capacity limited batteries in comparison to the electrical grid powered bs , @xmath39 and @xmath37 s should reflect the energy price in the market for the bs and the risk of running out of energy for each mt @xmath8 , respectively . with this definition , problem ( wstremin )",
    "can be treated as a network - wide cost minimization problem .",
    "how to practically select the values of @xmath39 and @xmath37 s to achieve this end is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "in this section , we consider minimizing receiver energy consumption at all mts without regard for bs energy consumption . from ( [ eq : receiver energy at mt k ] ) and ( [ eq : weighted energy definition ] ) , the wsremin problem is thus formulated as @xmath44 as mentioned in section [ sec : introduction ] , receiver - side energy minimization has also been considered in @xcite , in which the available time - frequency resources are divided into equally spaced rbs over both time and frequency .",

    "can be shown to be @xmath304 for @xmath74 , @xmath46 and @xmath305 for @xmath306 , @xmath307 . ] hence , the optimal solution of ( p2-d ) can be obtained as @xmath67 and @xmath308 by applying the ellipsoid method .    after obtaining the dual solution @xmath67 and @xmath308 , we can substitute them into ( [ eq : p2 solution 1 ] ) and ( [ eq : p2 solution 2 ] ) , and obtain the corresponding @xmath309 and @xmath310 .",
    "however , notice that the obtained @xmath309 and @xmath310 may not necessarily be the optimal solution of problem ( p2 ) , denoted by @xmath311 and @xmath312 , since they may not satisfy the constraints in ( [ eq : p2 c1 ] ) and ( [ eq : p2 c2 ] ) .",
    "the reason is that when @xmath313 for certain pairs of @xmath9 and @xmath8 , the corresponding @xmath314 can actually take any value within @xmath0 $ ] according to ( [ eq : solution for p2 derivative ] ) , each of which would result in a different @xmath315 accordingly .",
    "therefore , with @xmath67 and @xmath308 , we may obtain infinite sets of @xmath309 and @xmath310 , some of which might not satisfy the constraints in ( [ eq : p2 c1 ] ) and/or ( [ eq : p2 c2 ] ) @xcite . in such cases ,",
    "a linear programming ( lp ) needs to be further solved to obtain a feasible optimal solution for problem ( p2 ) .    to be more specific ,",
    "we first define the following two sets with given @xmath67 and @xmath308 : @xmath316 from ( [ eq : p2 solution 1 ] ) and ( [ eq : p2 solution 2 ] ) , we know that for any pair of @xmath9 and @xmath8 with @xmath317 , the corresponding @xmath315 and @xmath314 can be uniquely determined , which implies @xmath318 the problem remains to find @xmath319 and @xmath48 with @xmath320 .",
    "it is then observed that the optimal solution of problem ( p2 ) needs to satisfy the following linear equations : @xmath321 where ( [ eq : lp1 ] ) is due to ( [ eq : p2 solution 1 ] ) , and ( [ eq : lp2 ] ) is due to lemma [ lemma:6 ] and the complementary slackness conditions @xcite satisfied by the optimal solution of problem ( p2 ) .",
    "therefore , @xmath319 and @xmath48 with @xmath320 can be found through solving the above linear equations by treating @xmath319 and @xmath48 with @xmath317 as given constants , which is a linear programming ( lp ) and can be efficiently solved . in summary ,",
    "one algorithm for solving problem ( p2 ) and its dual problem ( p2-d ) is given in table [ table2 ] as follows .",
    "for the algorithm given in table [ table2 ] , the computation time is dominated by the ellipsoid method in steps 1)-3 ) and the lp in step 4 ) .",
    "in particular , the time complexity of steps 1)-3 ) is of order @xmath322 @xcite , step 4 ) is of order @xmath323 @xcite .",
    "therefore , the time complexity of the algorithm in table [ table2 ] is @xmath114 .    ' '' ''    1 .",
    "initialize @xmath324 and @xmath283 .",
    "* repeat : * * obtain @xmath325 and @xmath326 using ( [ eq : p2 solution 1 ] ) and ( [ eq : p2 solution 2 ] ) , respectively , with given @xmath302 and @xmath303 .",
    "* compute the subgradient of @xmath272 and update @xmath302 and @xmath303 accordingly using the ellipsoid method @xcite .",
    "3 .   * until * both @xmath302 and @xmath303 converge to @xmath67 and @xmath308 , respectively , within a prescribed accuracy . 4 .   determine @xmath327 with @xmath67 and @xmath308 .",
    "if it is feasible for problem ( p2 ) , set @xmath328 ; otherwise solve a lp to find @xmath122 .    ' '' ''    [ table2 ]",
    "to show problem ( temin-2 ) is convex , we need to prove that both @xmath97 and @xmath108 are convex functions of @xmath21 . since @xmath329 is linear in @xmath21 , we only need to show the convexity of @xmath97 and @xmath330 .",
    "first , we check the convexity of function @xmath97 , which is sufficient to prove that for any convex combination @xmath331 with @xmath332 and @xmath333 , we have @xmath334 .",
    "denote the optimal solution to problem ( temin-1 ) with @xmath335 and @xmath336 as @xmath337 , @xmath338 ( termed solution 1 ) and @xmath339 , @xmath340 ( termed solution 2 ) , respectively .",
    "then we have @xmath341    next we construct another solution @xmath342 , @xmath343 ( termed solution 3 ) of problem ( temin-1 ) with given @xmath21 , which is achieved by properly allocating power for each mt on each sc such that the average power consumption is the same as that with time sharing between solution 1 and solution 2 .",
    "the details of constructing solution 3 are given as follows : @xmath344}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] it can then be shown that @xmath345 i.e. , solution 3 is feasible for problem ( temin-1 ) with the given @xmath21 , and also achieves the same objective value as that in ( [ eq : time sharing objective ] ) .",
    "since solution 3 is only a feasible solution for problem ( temin-1 ) with given @xmath21 , which is not necessary to be optimal , we have @xmath346 the convexity of @xmath97 is thus proved .",
    "first , we find the gradient of @xmath97 . since @xmath97 is differentiable , its gradient and subgradient are equivalent .",
    "we provide the definition of subgradient @xcite as follows .",
    "a vector @xmath347 is said to be the subgradient of function @xmath348 at @xmath349 if for all @xmath350 , @xmath351    the dual function ( [ eq : p2 dual function ] ) can be expressed as @xmath352 then , we have @xmath353 where @xmath111 and @xmath354 is the optimal solution of problem ( p2-d ) with given @xmath109 . for any @xmath355 and @xmath356",
