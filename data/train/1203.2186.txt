    "blue compact dwarf galaxies ( bcds ) are known by their intense processes of star - formation .",
    "these make that their optical spectra were dominated by the blue light from massive young stars and the bright emission lines from the ionised gas , so they are also called h ii galaxies .",
    "their high specific star - formation rates and their low gas - phase metallicities were taken as evidences that these galaxies were undergoing their first bursts of star formation @xcite .",
    "in fact , one of the most important aspects about bcds is that they constitute an important link to the high redshift universe and the early epoch of galaxy formation @xcite . during the last decade , however , deep imaging of bcds showed that in addition to bright young stars from the present starburst most of them have an underlying older stellar population @xcite .",
    "one of the challenges of the bcds is to reconcile their low  observed metallicity with the relatively high star formation rate ( sfr ) in these galaxies . @xcite",
    "proposed three possible mechanisms to explain this fact : 1 ) variations in the initial mass function ( imf ) ; 2 ) accretion of metal - poor gas ; and 3 ) galactic winds powered by supernovae explosions . according to numerical models",
    ", it seems that the last mechanism is the most simple to reproduce the observed properties ( see @xcite and references therein for a detailed explanation ) .",
    "the star formation history ( sfh ) and the metal content of bcds must be figured out in order to shed some light on these questions . in the case of sfh , although some advances have been done by means of the fitting of the optical spectrum with stellar populations synthesis @xcite , one of the most reliable method consists of the analysis of colour - magnitude diagrams ( cmds ) .",
    "however , this is limited to the closest objects whose stellar population can be resolved .",
    "another important contribution comes from the study of the ionic chemical abundances of elements with a different nucleosynthetic origin , such as oxygen and nitrogen @xcite .",
    "these chemical abundances can be derived very accurately in the metal - poor gas phase of bcds , where the cooling rate is not efficient , increasing the electron temperature of the ionised gas and enhancing the emissivity of the collisional lines necessary to derive the ionic abundances following the method based on the determination of the electron temperature @xcite .",
    "ngc6789 is , according to @xcite , the closest bcd to our galaxy , with a distance modulus of ( m - m ) = 27.80 , or a distance of 3.6 mpc .",
    "this value yields a linear scale of 17.5 pc arcsec@xmath1 .",
    "@xcite imaged ngc 6789 from the ground .",
    "they found that it belongs to the ie subtype ( following @xcite classification ) , exhibiting the morphology most characteristic of the vast majority of bcds .",
    "ngc 6789 presents several h@xmath0 emission knots which show evidence of actual star formation activity .",
    "it also shows a high surface brightness in its central region and a small radial velocity ( v@xmath2 = -141 km s@xmath1 , * ? ? ?",
    "ngc 6789 s closeness , spatial isolation and morphology offer the prospect of studying the structure , sfh , and metallicity of different star forming knots within the same bcd .",
    "to investigate these issues , we obtained simultaneous blue and red long - slit observations with the isis double - arm spectrograph at the 4.2 m william herschel telescope ( wht ) , of the brightest five knots of ngc 6789 .",
    "we also used archival data from hst / wfpc2 , galex and h@xmath0 narrow filter , and b and r broad filters .",
    "these images were used to derive the sfh and to give an observational input to derive the properties of the ionising populations with the aid of photoionisation models .",
    "these were also used to provide more accurate chemical abundances in each one of the five studied knots of this galaxy and to better understand their differential chemical evolution .    in the following section",
    "the long - slit wht observations and reduction are described and the results from the analysis are presented . in section [ phot ]",
    "the optical and uv photometry are described together with the resolved stellar photometry .",
    "finally , we discuss all these results in section [ discussion ] and conclusions are presented in section [ conclusions ] .",
    "the long - slit spectrophotometric observations of ngc  6789 were obtained using the isis double - beam spectrograph mounted on the 4.2 m william herschel telescope ( wht ) of the isaac newton group ( ing ) at the roque de los muchachos observatory on the spanish island of la palma .",
    "they were acquired on 2005 july 8 during one single night observing run and under photometric conditions , with an average seeing of 0.7 arcsec .",
    "the eev12 and marconi2 detectors were attached to the blue and red arms of the spectrograph , respectively .",
    "the r600b grating was used in the blue covering the wavelength range 3670 - 5070    ( centred at @xmath3 = 4370  ) , giving a spectral dispersion of 0.45   pixel@xmath1 . on the red arm ,",
    "the r316r grating was mounted in two different central wavelengths providing a spectral range from 5500 to 7800   ( @xmath3 = 6650  ) and from 7600 to 9900   ( @xmath3 = 8750  ) with a spectral dispersion of 0.86   pixel@xmath1 . to reduce the readout noise of our images , the observations were taken with the `` slow '' ccd speed .",
    "the pixel size for this set - up is 0.2 arcsec for both spectral ranges .",
    "the slit width was 1 arcsec , which , combined with the spectral dispersions , yields spectral resolutions of about 1.0 and 3.5   fwhm in the blue and red arms , respectively .",

    "the calibration lamp used was + cuar .",
    "the images were processed and analysed with iraf routines in the usual manner .",
    "the procedure included cosmic rays removal , bias subtraction , division by a normalised flat field and wavelength calibration .",
    "typical wavelength fits to second to third order polynomials were performed using around 40 lines in the blue and 20 - 25 lines in the red .",
    "these fits were done at 100 different locations along the slit in both arms ( beam size of 10 pixels ) obtaining rms residuals between @xmath50.1 and @xmath50.2pix . in the last step ,",
    "the spectra were corrected for atmospheric extinction and flux calibrated . for both arms ,",
    "bd+254655 standard star observations were used , allowing a good spectrophotometric calibration with an estimated accuracy of about 5% .    unfortunately , the sky subtraction in the spectral range from 7600 to 9900   left strong residuals from night - sky emission lines and telluric absorption , leaving this part of the spectra unusable and therefore , we were not able to measure with enough accuracy the [ siii]@xmath69069,9532  lines in any of the five knots .",
    "figure [ regslit ] shows the h@xmath0 image and continuum contours in the r - band from @xcite in order to illustrate the position of the slits in relation to the position of the bursts of star formation and the host galaxy .",
    "we also show elliptical regions in h@xmath0 taken to measure the total h@xmath0 and galex flux of the knots ( see section [ halfa ] below ) .",
    "the five knots are labelled with the first alphabet letters .",
    "knots a and c were taken at pa = 138@xmath7 , which in average is close to the parallactic angle . in the case of knots",
    "b , d , and e the slit was at pa = 76@xmath7 , which is in average @xmath8 40@xmath7 off the parallactic angle .",
    "therefore , the observations in this second position can be affected by a certain differential atmospheric refraction ( dar ) .",
    "nevertheless , taking into account the curves given by @xcite for the mean air mass during the observations ( @xmath8 1.30 ) , we calculated that the angular deviation between [ oii ] and [ sii ] is not larger than the slit width at this p.a .",
    "besides , we checked that the emission line - ratios in the spatial position where both slit positions intersect do not vary in more than the quoted errors .",
    "nevertheless , the line measurements errors of the second slit position ( b , d and e knots ) might be larger due to this effect .",
    "for the sake of comparison , we also plot in figure [ regslit ] part of the rectangle encompassing the field - of - view ( fov ) of the pc chip of the wfpc2 data used to obtain the resolved stellar photometry ( see section [ rphot ] )      the optical calibrated spectra of the five observed knots with some relevant identified emission lines are shown in figure [ spectra ] .",
    "the spectrum of each knot is split into two panels .    underlying stellar population in star forming galaxies",
    "have several effects in the measure of the emission lines produced by the ionised gas .",
    "balmer and paschen emission lines are depressed by the presence of absorption wings of stellar origin and does not allow the measure of their fluxes with acceptable accuracy @xcite .",
    "all the properties derived from ratios that involve these lines , like reddening or ionic abundances , will be affected .",
    "we subtracted from the observed spectra the spectral energy distribution of the underlying stellar population found by the spectral synthesis code starlight @xcite .",
    "starlight fits an observed continuum spectral energy distribution using a combination of the synthesis spectra of different single stellar populations ( ssps ; also known as instantaneous burst ) using a @xmath9 minimisation procedure .",
    "we chose for our analysis the ssp spectra from @xcite , based on the stelib library of @xcite , padova 1994 evolutionary tracks , and a @xcite imf between 0.1 and 100 m@xmath10 .",
    "the metallicity of the libraries was strictly constrained following the results derived from section [ ssfh ] .",
    "thus , we fixed the metallicity of the stellar populations to z = 0.004 ( @xmath8 3/10 z@xmath10 = 0.0122 ] ) for the interval log(age ) = [ 8.1,8.5 ] and z = 0.001 ( @xmath8 1/12 z@xmath10 ) for log(age ) = \\{6.0 , 6.4 , 6.6 , 6.8 , 7.0 , 7.1 , 7.2 , 7.9 , 8.0 , 8.1 , 8.2 , 8.3 , 9.1 , 9.2 , 9.3 , 9.7 , 9.8 , 9.9 , 10.0 , 10.1 } shown in the sfh solution ( see figure [ sfh ] ) .",
    "as explained in section [ ssfh ] , although both metallicities appear in the youngest burst ( @xmath11 12 myr ) sfh solution , we assigned the lower metallicity to this event according to the abundances derived in section [ abundances ] .",
    "the starlight code solves simultaneously the ages and relative contributions of the different ssps and the average reddening . the reddening law from @xcite with",
    "@xmath12 = 3.1 was used .",
    "prior to the fitting procedure , the spectra were shifted to the rest frame and re - sampled to a wavelength interval of 1   in the entire wavelength range by interpolation , as required by the program .",
    "bad pixels and emission lines were excluded from the final fits .    it should be noted that while emission lines can be masked out , this is not possible for the nebular continuum emission .",
    "we tested the contribution of this emission using starburst99 libraries ( sb99 ; * ? ? ? * ) in the same starlight models and we checked that the nebular continuum does not affect significantly neither the subtraction of the underlying continuum nor the determination of the stellar mass , consistently with the weak gas emission in this galaxy .    the hi series ( emitted as a consequence of recombination )",
    "were used to determine the extinction , comparing the observed line ratios with the expected theoretical values .",
    "case b ( optically thick in all the lyman lines ) is the best simple approximation to describe the physical conditions in the ionisation of the gas .",
    "this method takes advantage of the fact that the ratio between the emissivities of two hydrogen recombination lines , which depends on electron temperature and density , is almost constant . as an example",
    ", the ratio between the emissivity of h@xmath0 and h@xmath13 is 2.86 for the case b with @xmath14 @xmath15 and @xmath16 k , and this value varies less than 10% in the range of interest of temperatures and densities for an hii region .",
    "we used an iterative method to estimate them , taking as starting values those derived from the measured [ sii ] @xmath6 6717,6731   and [ oiii ] @xmath6 4363,4959,5007  .",
    "a least square fit of the measured decrements to the theoretical ones , computed based on the data by @xcite , was performed that provides the reddening coefficient , c(h@xmath13 ) , and adopting the extinction law given by @xcite with r@xmath17 = 3.1 . due to the large error introduced by the presence of the underlying population ,",
    "only the strongest balmer emission lines ( h@xmath0 , h@xmath13 , h@xmath18 , and h@xmath19 ) were used .",
    "line fluxes for the most relevant emission lines were measured using the ` splot ` task in iraf .",
    "balmer lines were obtained from the starlight residual spectra , while the rest of the lines were measured on the original spectra .",
    "we checked in all spectra that the starlight models properly reproduce the observed balmer absorption profiles .",
    "the statistical errors associated with the observed emission line fluxes were calculated using the expression :    @xmath20    where @xmath21 is the error in the observed line flux , @xmath22 represents the standard deviation in a box near the measured emission line and stands for the error in the continuum placement , n is the number of pixels used in the measure of the line flux , ew is the line equivalent width , and @xmath23 is the wavelength dispersion in   per pixel @xcite .",

    "table [ lines ] gives the equivalent widths and the emission - line fluxes relative to 1000@xmath24f(h@xmath13 ) , before and after reddening correction , in the optical spectra of the five observed knots , together with the reddening constants and their errors , their corresponding a(v ) value ) = 0.4656*a(v ) , using @xcite and r@xmath17 = 3.1 .",
    "] and the extinction - corrected h@xmath13 flux .",
    "we also provide the adopted reddening curve , @xmath25 normalised to h@xmath13 .",
    "the errors in the emission - line ratios were obtained by propagating in quadrature the observational errors in the emission - line fluxes and the reddening constant uncertainties .    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     @xmath26 values derived from the h@xmath0 image , not corrected for extinction .",
    "the total masses of the ionising clusters were also derived by using the number of ionising photons and the ages obtained from the respective cloudy models and the starburst99 libraries of the corresponding synthesis cluster atmospheres .",
    "these are listed in table [ haprops ] . as can be seen , the stellar masses of the bursts in the four first knots are quite similar , while knot e has the lowest value .",
    "these masses are in agreement within 0.3 dex with the masses derived for the younger stellar population using the fitting to the optical spectrum made with starlight ( table [ slprop ] ) .",
    "once the @xmath27 were estimated for the five knots , it was possible to derive the properties that depend on the corrected total l(h@xmath0 ) , including the mass of ionised hydrogen , the star formation strengths ( sfs , defined as the total mass of gas transformed into stars during the burst ) and the sfr .",
    "these are listed in table [ haprops ] , along with the values for the whole galaxy .",
    "the total ionised masses of the gas clouds in each knot were calculated using @xcite :    @xmath28    assuming case b , n@xmath29 = 100 @xmath30 , and @xmath31 @xmath30 s@xmath1 .",
    "the individual knots show masses of ionised hydrogen of the order of hundreds of solar masses for knot e and up to @xmath5 6600 m@xmath10 in knot c. in the case of the whole galaxy , the total flux described in section [ halfa ] can be converted into ( 1.0 @xmath32 0.1 ) @xmath4 10@xmath33 m@xmath10 of ionised hydrogen , comparable to knot a of the giant extragalactic hii region ngc 5471 in m101 @xcite or to the whole ngc 604 giant hii region in m33 @xcite .    it is known that the sfr determined from h@xmath0",
    "is sensitive to several uncertainties , as those related with the extinction and the assumed imf . besides , not always all the ionising photons",
    "are absorbed , being the escape fraction of ionising radiation from individual hii regions ( in nearby galaxies ) between 15% and 50% @xcite .",
    "we applied the calibration by @xcite , which makes a distinction between instantaneous ( ib ) and extended burst ( eb ) .",
    "we used our extinction and dust absorption corrected h@xmath0 luminosity ( except for the value of the whole galaxy ) and a salpeter imf in the range 0.1 - 100 m@xmath10 as input . for the ib case , the value given by the calibration is the sfs .",
    "the sfs values in table [ haprops ] were calculated using the age provided by the calibration , namely 4 , 5 , and 6 myr , closest to the age estimated from the photoionisation models . according to this calibration",
    ", the mass of gas transformed in stars during the actual burst in each knot is of the order of tens of thousands of solar masses , except for knot e , which is one order of magnitude lower .",
    "we provide as well the sfr , for the eb case ( continuous star formation ) , as a reference value .",
    "regarding the sfr of the whole galaxy , the value estimated by means of the h@xmath0 flux is slightly higher than the peak obtained from the cmd ( see figure [ sfh ] ) .",
    "the sfr for bcds spans from a few 10@xmath34 to several times 10@xmath35 m@xmath10/yr @xcite , showing ngc 6789 not a particularly high value .",
    "although our models are able to reproduce much of the observational information both in the optical and the uv , some of their limitations must be taken into account .",
    "it is possible that the ew(h@xmath13 ) could be modified owing to great fractions of leaked photons .",
    "however , comparing the mass of ionised gas in this galaxy [ log(m / m@xmath10 ) @xmath5 5 , see table [ haprops ] ] with the mass of neutral hydrogen does not support this scenario , but taking into account the oversimplified geometry of our models it can not be ruled out completely . in this sense , as the long - slit does not cover entirely the gas - emission from the knots , the ew(h@xmath13 ) are lower limits .",
    "nonetheless , the aperture factors derived from the direct comparison with the h@xmath0 image do not lead to a satisfactory solution .",
    "larger dust - to - gas ratios and @xmath27 than typical values for hii regions with larger metallicity ( _ e.g. _ @xcite ) were derived by the models in all knots in order to fit the observed ew(h@xmath13 ) and fuv - nuv colours . however , these values can not be taken as representative of the whole galaxy but only for the analysed star - forming knots , considering that the fraction of ionised - to - neutral gas is quite small , as mentioned above , and that this galaxy does not present a very high ir luminosity ( _ i.e. _ it does not appear in the iras catalogue ) .",
    "we have run other set of models with standard dust - to - gas ration values , but they do not fit the observables mentioned above .",
    "the dust - to - gas ratios could be considerably decreased by assuming different geometries of the gas and dust inside the hii regions , but this approach is beyond the scope of this work .    finally , our results about the masses and ages of the ionising clusters must be used only as a guiding signpost , as the involved masses range in a regime ( @xmath5 10@xmath36 m@xmath10 ) where stochastic fluctuations in the imf can be important @xcite . in this sense ,",
    "imf sampling effects @xcite can also alter our results , as there can be a lower number of massive stars than expected for the mass range of these knots .",
    "the derived densities , both for [ sii ] and [ oii ] , are very similar for the first four knots , being lower than 100 @xmath30 .",
    "interestingly , knot e , located in the outskirts of the galaxy , shows a density twice higher than the knots located in the central part of the galaxy . at any rate , these densities are typical of low density environments found in bcds .    regarding electron temperatures , t([oiii ] ) was measured in the five knots , with errors which depend on the quality of the spectrum in each knot going from 3% in knot a up to 13% in knot e. the first four star - forming regions show very similar [ oiii ] temperatures , all within a relatively narrow range , between 13000 and 14300 k , while knot e has a lower temperature by about 2000 k. to our knowledge , there is no previous report on t([oiii ] ) for this galaxy in the literature .",
    "t([oii ] ) was also measured in three of the knots ( b , c , and e ) and it was estimated in the other two knots by means of relations between these temperatures and the measured value of t([oiii ] ) .",
    "the knot c , which is the brightest in h@xmath0 , has in average higher temperatures .",
    "we derived oxygen , nitrogen , sulphur , neon and argon total abundances in all the studied knots by taking the ionic abundances calculated in section [ abundances ] and the icfs estimated in our tailored photoionisation models . as in the case of temperatures , no other direct abundance determination exists in the literature for this galaxy . in average ,",
    "ngc 6789 shows an oxygen abundance characteristic of the low values found in strong line bcds , with values in all knots in the range of 12 + log(o / h ) = 7.80 - 7.93 , what is compatible with a similar abundance in all knots taking into account the errors .",
    "this behaviour , i.e. showing different star forming knots within a bcd close abundance values ( i.e. , @xmath11 0.2 dex ) , is also found in other objects using both long - slit spectroscopy @xcite and integral field spectroscopy @xcite , or in hii complexes in spiral galaxies with a similar spatial scale @xcite .    since nitrogen and oxygen have different nucleosynthetic origins , their ratio is related to the chemical history of galaxies .",
    "primary nitrogen synthesis is thought to occur in intermediate - mass stars in the cno process during hydrogen burning being hence independent of the initial heavy - element abundances , while secondary nitrogen production is expected to be produced in stars of all masses @xcite . at low metallicity ,",
    "most part of nitrogen has a primary origin and a constant log(n / o ) ratio is observed .",
    "however , the n / o values found in the studied knots of ngc 6789 range in an interval ( from -1.38 to -1.26 ) is sensibly higher than the observed values for other bcds or low - metallicity dwarf irregular galaxies @xcite ,",
    "which is around log(n / o ) @xmath8 -1.6 . in the case of knot",
    "c , this ratio is even higher , with a value of -1.07 . the cause of these relatively high n / o can be partially found in the corresponding icfs derived by the models as the total nitrogen abundances derived from the assumption n / o",
    "@xmath8 n@xmath37/o@xmath37 give lower n / o values in knots a [ log(n / o ) = -1.41 ] and c [ log(n / o ) = -1.34 ] , although still higher within the errors than the typical n / o value for bcds .",
    "on the other hand , several causes are cited in the literature to explain this overabundance of nitrogen in low - metallicity environments ( _ e.g. _ the pollution of the ism by wolf - rayet stellar winds ) , but it is especially indicative in this case that we found this overabundance in the five knots , which present different evolutionary and excitation properties .",
    "therefore , the high n / o is apparently related with some other process affecting all the ism of the galaxy .",
    "the fall of pristine gas in the galaxy could explain the n / o overabundance @xcite and , at same time , the triggering of the star formation in different places of the galaxy with very short time intervals between them",
    ".    the ratio of the alpha elements , sulphur , neon , and argon , to oxygen should be constant and show no dependence on the oxygen abundance , since all are products of @xmath0-processes in the same massive stars that make oxygen .",
    "the derived log(s / o ) ratios range between -1.64 and -1.41 in the four first knots and it is sensibly higher in knot e , but in this knot the derivation is much more uncertain as no [ siii ] was measured . although the ratio seems to increase from knot a to d , the average error ( @xmath5 0.18 ) prevents us from drawing any conclusion about the homogeneity .    regarding the logarithmic ne / o ratio , knots a and c show the same value , -0.70 , while for the rest of the knots the mean value is -0.94 , with an average error of 0.07 dex for a and c and 0.20 dex for b , d , and e.    the ar / o ratios found , in the range -2.28 to -2.06 , show a very similar value for all knots , taking 0.17 dex as the average error ( ranging from 0.09 up to 0.22 dex )",
    ".    finally , the derived helium abundances are the same for all five knots of ngc 6789 within observational errors , and similar to the values found for other bcds @xcite .",
    "in this paper , we present resolved stellar , h@xmath0 , and galex photometry , from different data archives , and wht - isis optical spectroscopy of the five brightest star - forming knots of the nearest bcd galaxy ngc 6789 in order to study their sfh and metallicity .",
    "the spectroscopic observations of ngc 6789 were taken using isis double - arm spectrograph attached to the 4.2 m wht , which allowed the simultaneous analysis of the spectra , covering from 3650 up to 7500  . from the long - slit spectra",
    ", we extracted and performed a detailed analysis of the five main star forming knots of the galaxy . thanks to the measure of the [ oiii ] electron temperature in all knots and the measure of t([oii ] ) in three of them ,",
    "we provide `` direct method '' abundances for oxygen , nitrogen , sulphur , neon , and argon , not reported previously in the literature . our analysis indicates that this galaxy is metal - poor ( 12+log(o / h ) in the range 7.80 - 7.93 ) and chemically homogeneous , with quite similar values of the studied species in all knots . at same time , all the knots present values of n / o which are higher than expected for the metal regime of this galaxy .",
    "we used optical data obtained from the hst archive to derive the sfh of ngc 6789 by means of the classical method of cmd reconstruction .",
    "we used the derived sfh in the program starlight to fit the optical spectrum and we compared these results with another non - constrained case .",
    "we corrected the emission - line measures from absorption and we derived the total stellar masses for each knot . although the sfh obtained from the cmd is not foreseen by starlight in the non - constrained case , we checked that the total stellar mass and the ratio of older and younger stellar populations are not noticeably affected by the assumed sfh . anyway , whenever possible , the extension of this type of studies for objects for which simultaneous resolved stellar photometry and optical spectroscopy are available will provide a much more accurate constrain to the age - metallicity - extinction degeneracy of these galaxies , as well as the comparison between nebular and stellar properties .",
    "finally , the ages and masses of the bursts of star formation in each knot were derived using cloudy tailored photoionisation models to fit the optical and uv photometric properties and the observed emission - line ratios and corrected h@xmath13 equivalent widths .",
    "we found that dust absorption factors correlate much better with the galex fuv - nuv colour index than with the reddening constants derived from the balmer decrement , indicating a very complex inner dust extinction structure .",
    "the models predict for all knots instantaneous bursts with ages in the range between 3 and 6 myr .",
    "these ages do not follow any spatial trend in the galaxy image , so they are possibly related with the distribution of the galaxy in the line of sight .",
    "the dust absorption - corrected h@xmath0 fluxes were used to derive accurate sfrs for the individual knots .",
    "the combination of several observational and model techniques lead to a better and auto - consistent study of ngc 6789 .",
    "the derivation of a non - typical metallicity evolution using a cmd allows the use of the sfh to the subtraction of the older stellar population using spectral fitting to the optical spectrum with starlight .",
    "this information , together with the derivation of accurate physical properties and ionic chemical abundances pointing to similar low o / h and high n / o ratios in all knots allow the application of photoionisation models that predict dust - absorption factors fitting the galex colour indices and the derivation of ages ( ibs in the range 3 - 6 myr ) .",

    "<S> we present a detailed auto - consistent study of the nearest blue compact dwarf galaxy ngc 6789 by means of optical and uv archive photometry data and optical long - slit isis - wht spectroscopy observations of the five brightest star - forming knots . </S>",
    "<S> the analysis of the spectra in all knots allowed the derivation of ionic chemical abundances of oxygen , nitrogen , sulphur , argon and neon using measures of both the high- and low - excitation electron temperatures , leading to the conclusion that ngc 6789 is chemically homogeneous with low values of the abundance of oxygen in the range 12+log(o / h ) = 7.80 - 7.93 , but presenting at the same time higher values of the nitrogen - to - oxygen ratio than expected for its metal regime .    </S>",
    "<S> we used archival _ </S>",
    "<S> hubble space telescope_/wide - field planetary camera 2 ( hst / wfpc2 ) f555w and f814w observations of ngc 6789 to perform a photometric study of the colour - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) of the resolved stellar populations and derive its star formation history ( sfh ) , which is compatible with the presence of different young and old stellar populations whose metallicities do not necessarily increase with age . </S>",
    "<S> we fit the observed optical spectrum in all the five knots using the starlight code and a combination of single stellar populations following the sfh obtained from the cmd . </S>",
    "<S> we compare the resulting stellar masses and the relative fractions of the ionising populations with a non - constrained sfh case . </S>",
    "<S> the properties of the younger populations were obtained using cloudy photoionisation models , giving similar ages in all the knots in the range 3 - 6 myr and the estimation of the dust absorption factor , which correlates with the observed galex fuv - nuv colour indices . </S>",
    "<S> the total photometric extinction and dust - absorption corrected h@xmath0 fluxes were finally used to derive the star formation rates .    </S>",
