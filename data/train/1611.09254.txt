    "phase transition are very common in nature .",
    "they are sudden changes of the macroscopic behavior of a natural system composed by many interacting parts occurring while an external parameter is smoothly varied .",
    "phase transitions are an example of emergent behavior , i.e. of a collective properties having no direct counterpart in the dynamics or structure of individual atoms @xcite .",
    "the successful description of phase transitions starting from the properties of the interactions between the components of the system is one of the major achievements of equilibrium statistical mechanics .    from a statistical - mechanical point of view , in the canonical ensemble , describing a system at constant temperature @xmath3 , a phase transition occurs at special values if the temperature called transition points , where thermodynamic quantities such as pressure , magnetization , or heat capacity , are non - analytic functions of @xmath3 ; these points are the boundaries between different phases of the system . starting from the celebrated solution of the @xmath4 ising model by onsager",
    ", these singularities have been indeed found in many models , and later developments like the renormalization group theory @xcite have considerably deepened our knowledge of the properties of the transition points , at least in the case continuous transitions , or critical phenomena .    yet , the situation is not completely satisfactory , first , in the canonical ensemble these singularities occur only in the rather artificial case of infinite systems : following an early suggestion by kramers @xcite , lee and yang @xcite showed that in the thermodynamic limit @xmath5 ( @xmath6 is the number of degrees of freedom , and the limit is taken at fixed density ) must be invoked to explain the existence of true singularities in the canonical partition function @xmath7 and then in the thermodynamic functions defined as derivatives of @xmath7 . since in the last decades",
    "many examples of transitional phenomena in systems far form the thermodynamic limit have been found ( e.g. in nuclei , atomic clusters , biopolymers , superconductivity , superfluidity ) , a description of phase transition valid also for finite systems would be desirable .",
    "second , while necessary conditions fro the presence of a phase transitions can be found ( one example is the above - mentioned need of the thermodynamic limit in the canonical ensemble ) , nothing general is known about sufficient conditions : no general procedure is at hand to tell if a system where a phase transition is not ruled out from the beginning does have or not such a transition without computing @xmath8 .",
    "this might indicate that our deep understanding of this phenomenon is still incomplete .",
    "these considerations motivate a study of the deep nature of phase transitions which may also be based on alternative approaches .",
    "one of such approaches , proposed in @xcite and developed later @xcite , is based on simple concepts and tools drawn from differential geometry and topology .",
    "the main issue of this new approach is a topological hypothesis , whose content is that at their deepest level phase transitions are due to a topology change of suitable submanifolds of configuration space , those where the system lives as the number of its degrees of freedom becomes very large .",
    "this idea has been discussed and tested in many recent papers @xcite .",
    "moreover , the topological hypothesis has been given a rigorously background by a theorem @xcite which states that , at least for systems with short - ranged interactions and confining potentials , topology changes in configurations space submanifolds are a necessary condition for a phase transition .",
    "anyway , in @xcite it has been shown that the theorem can not be sustainable except for some particular cases . in @xcite",
    "a generalized version of the theorem has been proposed in which also concepts of geometric nature are encompassed besides topology .",
    "however , the problem of which may be , if any , the sufficient conditions to entail phase transitions either topological alone or in addition to geometric hypotheses remains open . a first answer to this problem has been given in @xcite , where a straightforward theorem for the occurrence of a @xmath0-symmetry breaking phase transition ( sbpt hereafter ) has been proven .",
    "in this paper we generalize that theorem finding out a more general sufficient and necessary condition for @xmath0-sbpts .",
    "the sufficient condition of the theorem in @xcite makes use only of topological properties of the equipotential hypersurfaces ( @xmath1 s hereafter ) of configuration space , while the generalized version is given in terms of a geometric property of the @xmath1 s largely independent on their topology .",
    "the @xmath1 s having this property has been called _strangled_ in the sense of the presence of a bottleneck which will be clarified in the paper . the original topological condition survives as a limiting case . in general",
    ", the results of this paper seems to suggest that purely topological conditions for sbpts are unattainable , as already highlighted in @xcite , even though it is not said that the generating - mechanism of sbpts delineated here is the unique acting in nature .",

    "in this paper we have highlighted the generating - mechanism for @xmath0-sbpts in hamiltonian systems .",
    "the mechanism is based on a particular shape of the @xmath68-level sets that we have defined strangled. the strangledness of a @xmath68-level set entails the spontaneous ergodicity breaking , whence the sbpt . since in the thermodynamic limit",
    "the the @xmath172-level sets is the unique level set accessible to the rp of the system , we can calculate the spontaneous magnetization by the ensemble average on the @xmath172-level set provided that the last is ergodic .",
    "but we have shown that if the @xmath172-level set is strangled , then it can not be ergodic because the rp can not visit all the regions of the @xmath172-level set for a time proportional to the statistical measure .",
    "in other words , a strangled @xmath68-level set has a neck in correspondence of the plane at @xmath22-magnetization where the probability to find the rp is exponentially suppressed with @xmath6 , so that the neck acts as a topological barrier .",
    "we note that , despite we have applied this idea to the canonical ensemble , this mechanism is suitable for application also to the microcanonical ensemble because it is independent on @xmath6 .",
    "the concept of the strangled @xmath68-level sets can be directly extended also to discrete variables - systems , e.g. the ising model .",
    "the @xmath68-level sets become discrete sets , so that the statistical measure is replaced by the count of the microstates .",
    "this question weather a narrow neck can break the symmetry of a system has been pointed out also in the recent paper @xcite , where the authors have introduced the new concept of asymptotic diffeomorphicity among manifolds : two manifolds can be diffeomorphic at any finite @xmath6 , but not asymptotically diffeomorphic in the limit @xmath5 . in the meanwhile",
    "we wait for a rigorous definition of asymptotic diffeomorphicity , we wonder weather this picture may be equivalent to the one of the strangled @xmath68-level sets introduced here , at least for systems with a @xmath0 symmetry where the strangledness is defined .    another open question is about short - range systems . in a short - range system",
    "the entropy @xmath140 has to be a concave function of @xmath68 , at most non - strictly concave in presence of phase transitions @xcite .",
    "the definition of the strangled @xmath68-level sets we have given is suitable only for long - range systems because it implies a non - concave shape of @xmath140 .",
    "anyway , that definition is suitable to be generalized to the short - range case if we assume that the strangledness of the @xmath68-level sets are maintained for any @xmath6 but not in the limit @xmath5 .",
    "this entails that the entropy must be a non - strictly concave function of @xmath68 , as requested for a short - range system .",
    "this means that there is no qualitative difference between short - range and long - range as long as @xmath6 is far from the thermodynamic limit . in @xcite",
    "the average trapping time of the rp to be located around one of the two average values of the magnetization in the broken phase of the @xmath4 @xmath2 model with nearest neighbors interactions has been found to increase as a polynomial in @xmath6 .",
    "but in a long - range system the trapping time increases exponentially in @xmath6 , so that the difference becomes crucial as @xmath6 is large enough . this difference may be responsible of the fact that a non - concave entropy in the broken phase of a long - range system is replaced by a non - strictly concave entropy of a short - range system .",
