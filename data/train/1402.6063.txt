    "in the theory of light is well known the deep relationship between electromagnetic and geometrical optics .",
    "usually , geometrical optics is considered as an approximation valid in the limit of short wavelengths @xcite .",
    "furthermore , another radically different point of view is also possible : the light rays of geometrical optics determine the exact way in which the surfaces of field discontinuity propagate , for all wavelengths @xcite .",
    "in this context , a natural question appears : what happens with the polarization ?",
    "a simple calculus shows a coupling between the rays of the light , the gradient of the refraction index , and the field itself ; consequently , it can be proved that the ellipse of polarization just rotates along the propagation , always keeping its shape @xcite .",
    "it is a remarkable phenomenon that the polarization transformation has a purely geometrical origin since it depends only on the shape of the trajectory , becoming an example of topological dynamics .    in this work",

    "on the other hand , we may consider that classical trajectories also emerge in the quantum - mechanical version of the optical eikonal approach .",
    "this actually corresponds to the wentzel - kramers - brillouin ( wkb ) methods @xcite , where the classical trajectories arise as an approximation of quantum dynamics valid for short values of the planck constant .",
