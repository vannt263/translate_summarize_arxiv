    "the study of quantum fluctuations arising from dynamical phonons and their effects on the charge ordering instability of one - dimensional systems has a long history.@xcite one of the simplest models to describe a one - dimensional solid under the influence of the quantum fluctuations is the molecular - crystal or holstein model,@xcite which is given by the following hamiltonian : @xmath0 where @xmath1    in this model , the electrons move in a tight - binding band interacting with the lattice via the coupling between the local electron density and the local lattice displacement . in the hamiltonian ,",
    "@xmath2 ( @xmath3 ) creates ( annihilates ) an electron at site @xmath4 with spin @xmath5 , and @xmath6 is the electron number operator .",
    "the ions are described by momentum @xmath7 and displacement @xmath8 for site @xmath4 .",
    "the mass of the ions is @xmath9 , and @xmath10 is the harmonic lattice coupling constant , so that the phonon frequency , @xmath11 .",
    "following convention , we shall call these dispersionless optical excitations  einstein phonons \" .",
    "the hopping energy of the electrons between nearest neighbors is @xmath12 , and @xmath13 is the electron - phonon coupling energy . in",
    "what follows we will use units such that @xmath14 , except where otherwise specified .",
    "for the half - filled band , early work suggested that the holstein model displays dimerization and that long range charge ordering sets in at any finite phonon frequency.@xcite these conclusions have been challenged by various studies which find that for small enough electron - phonon coupling , the system has zero charge gap and thus no long range order . @xcite",
    "a recent quantum monte carlo study@xcite further suggested that the dominant power - law ordering is the singlet bcs superconducting pairing ( ss ) correlation .",
    "this conclusion was based on data from finite size simulations which shows that the luttinger charge exponent ( @xmath15 ) is larger than one.@xcite ( it is important to realize at the outset that this is not an off - diagonal long range ordering@xcite , as breaking the @xmath16 gauge invariance@xcite to generate a mass gap is forbidden at one dimension.@xcite ss should thus be understood as a charge gapless , dominant off - diagonal power - law decaying ordering . ) in the ( possibly singular ) limit of infinite phonon frequency , the holstein model becomes equivalent to the attractive hubbard model .",
    "@xcite for the attractive hubbard model at half - filling , the ss and the charge density wave ( cdw ) order parameters are degenerate because of the particle - hole symmetry .",
    "moreover , both order parameters possess continuous symmetry with respect to the spin rotation.@xcite therefore , long range ordering of either sort is forbidden in this case .",
    "however , from the numerical simulations for finite size lattices , @xmath15 is always larger than one and converges to one very slowly with increasing system size.@xcite the similar behaviors of @xmath15 for both the attractive hubbard model and the holstein model at finite phonon frequency have led to the suggestion that the holstein model _ even at finite phonon frequency _ may have a charge gapless metallic phase with degenerate ss and cdw correlations , even though @xmath17 from finite size calculations.@xcite we note that this coexistence has been proposed years ago.@xcite    in the present article we present analytical and numerical calculations of the ll relations in the 1d holstein model with finite size corrections .",
    "our results extend to einstein phonons previous studies involving acoustic phonons@xcite and complement prior multiscale functional renormalization group studies of retardation effects due to einstein phonons.@xcite in essence , we seek to answer three important questions raised by previous studies:(i ) are the ll scaling relations valid in the 1d holstein model ?",
    "( ii ) what are the dominant correlations in this model ? ( iii ) what can be said about the possibility of a charge gapless metallic phase at half - filling for weak electron - phonon coupling ?",
    "as we shall see , we are able to provide clear answers to the first two questions but can only comment on the third .    in section ii of the paper ,",
    "we begin our study by describing the forward scatterings of the holstein model in terms of bosonic fields . in section iii , we solve analytically the forward scattering part of the holstein model to show that electron - phonon coupling modifies the relations between scaling exponents , and we calculate these modifications for finite size systems .",
    "this enables us to answer question ( i ) . in section iv",
    ", we employ quantum monte carlo calculations for the full hamiltonian ( eq . [ hhm ] ) to resolve question ( ii ) and to gain some insight into question ( iii ) . in section",
    "v , we discuss the reasons of why all the perturbative renormalization group studies obtain long range cdw phase and under what circumstances the metallic phase can be obtained .",
    "section vi contains a brief conclusion .",
    "to answer the question about the validity of the ll relations for the holstein model in the _ gapless _ regime , _ including the gapless half - filled case if present _ , it is sufficient to diagonalize exactly the _ forward scatterings ( scatterings with zero momentum transfer , often denoted as @xmath18 and @xmath19 in the  g - ology \" terminology)_@xcite of the hamiltonian .",
    "the neglect of anything beyond forward scatterings is unquestionably an assumption which can not be _ a priori _ justified in the full model , but this neglect is the fundamental conjecture on the description of the gapless one - dimensional system : any contributions beyond forward scatterings can be incorporated into the renormalization of the forward scatterings . therefore , although we are considering forward scatterings only , it is completely general for the description of any gapless regime _ regardless of the filling_. in what follows ,",
    "the right hand side of the symbol , @xmath20 , is understood to include only those terms in which the forward scatterings _ exclusively _ are retained .    by formulating the one - dimensional problem in the continuum limit and retaining only the low - energy degrees of freedom , @xmath21 ,",
    "can be expressed in term of bosonic fields , @xmath22 and their corresponding momenta @xmath23 with explicit spin@xmath24 - charge@xmath25 separation.@xcite @xmath26 . \\label{llh}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for the holstein model at half filling , the fermi points are at @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "therefore @xmath29 , and @xmath30.@xcite the values of these parameters , @xmath31 , can be renormalized by the interactions .",
    "however , as long as the ll description is valid , the scalings of the various correlation functions are determined solely by these parameters.@xcite in particular , the cdw correlation and the ss correlation scale as @xmath32 and @xmath33 , respectively .",
    "this implies @xmath34 , when a spin gap appears , in which case @xmath35 .",
    "consider the electron - phonon coupling . as we include only forward scatterings , only the phonons with momentum @xmath36 are coupled with the electrons .",
    "the hamiltonian for the phonons with momentum @xmath36 is @xmath37 ,   \\label{llh_ph}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath38 is the mass density , @xmath39 is the phonon field with momentum @xmath36 , and @xmath40 is the conjugate momentum .",
    "the hamiltonian for the electron - phonon coupling is @xmath41 by keeping only the term which is linear in the bosonic field to express the density operator , @xmath42 , we obtain@xcite @xmath43 the remaining terms will generate the back scatterings and umklapp scatterings .",
    "they also lead to spin - charge coupling due to the retardation.@xcite    when only forward scatterings are considered , the electron - phonon coupling affects only the charge part of the hamiltonian , and we will thus focus on the charge part only in the following . the spin part is unchanged from the standard luttinger model.@xcite the charge part of the hamiltonian ( eq . [ hhm ] ) arising solely from forward scatterings is @xmath44 +   \\\\ \\nonumber \\frac{1}{2}\\int dx [ \\zeta^{-1}\\pi_{d_{0}}^{2 } + \\zeta \\omega_0 ^ 2 d_{0}^{2 } ] + g_{\\rm{ep } } \\int dx \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{\\pi}}(\\partial_{x } \\varphi_{\\rho } ) d_{0}. \\label{h_forward}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] since the phonon fields appear at quadratic order , we follow the work by martin and loss,@xcite who considered the case of acoustic phonons ( as opposed to the einstein phonon case we are considering here ) to integrate out the phonon fields , @xmath39 , which results in the collective propagator for the charge field , @xmath45 , @xmath46 , \\label{drho}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath47 . the first part of the propagator is the contribution from the bosonized electrons , and the second part comes from the electron - phonon coupling .",
    "the crucial difference between einstein phonons and acoustic phonons is that the coupling between the two bosonic modes ( @xmath45 and @xmath39 ) is symmetric for acoustic phonons ( @xmath48)@xcite , but asymmetric for einstein phonons ( @xmath49 ) . as a result ,",
    "the dispersion relations for the collective modes are linear for acoustic phonons but nonlinear for einstein phonons .",
    "therefore , the acoustic phonon case can be solved exactly , but the einstein phonon case , in general , can not be solved exactly .",
    "it is generally believed that the spin part of the half - filled holstein model is always gapped due to the back - scatterings.@xcite ( the spin - gapped but charge - gapless ll is often referred as luther - emery liquid.@xcite ) as a consequence , the luttinger spin exponent @xmath50 renormalizes to zero .",
    "we take this as an assumption and will not elaborate on it here . therefore",
    ", the boundary of the transition between the charge ordering and the singlet pairing is determined by the points where the luttinger charge exponent crosses the value _",
    "one _ , providing that the luttinger liquid description survives .",
    "it has previously been shown that the ll scaling relations are modified by the coupling with acoustic phonons.@xcite the analogous exact relations can not be obtained for the holstein model , which has einstein phonons . nevertheless , we can still extract the power - law decaying terms _ asymptotically ( i.e. , long - distance , low - energy limit , @xmath51)_. we find @xmath52 to the lowest order in the momentum . at this order ,",
    "the velocity of the lower branch , @xmath53 is @xmath54 .",
    "hence the relation @xmath34 is preserved .",
    "@xcite we reiterate that these asymptotic results are strictly correct only at long - distance , even apart from any oscillatory contributions .",
    "in addition , the power - law decay of the correlations is also valid at long distances only .",
    "the exact results for the charge density , @xmath55 , and the singlet pairing , @xmath56 , correlation functions can be expressed in term of two series : @xmath57 ,     \\\\",

    "we take the continuum limit , which amounts to replacing the summation over the momentum by an integral ; and we have to introduce the low momentum cutoff @xmath60 @xcite and the high momentum cutoff is set to @xmath61 . for the following numerical calculations , we fix the phonon frequency , @xmath62 .",
    "the asymptotic results indicate that the relation , @xmath63 , is valid independent of any parameter . in particular , it is valid independent of the electron - phonon coupling , which enters via the parameter @xmath64 . therefore , the ratio of the product of the singlet pairing and the charge ordering correlations at @xmath65 and @xmath66 , @xmath67 ln[o_{ss}(b , x)]}{ln[o_{cdw}(0,x ) ] ln[o_{ss}(0,x)]},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] should be equal to one when @xmath68 , that is , @xmath69 while eq .",
    "[ exp_ratio ] is exact in the asymptotic limit , using the analytical expressions we obtained for @xmath70 and @xmath71 , we find that @xmath72 deviates from one for non - zero scaled electron - phonon couplings , @xmath64 ; even at rather long distances , @xmath73 .",
    "this is shown in detail in fig .",
    "[ ll_exp ] .",
    "importantly , this deviation depends not only on the distance but also on the value of the electron - phonon coupling .",
    "the ratio is clearly larger than one and seems to converge to the asymptotic value , _ one _ , very slowly and at distances that are likely beyond the reach of existing numerical calculations , which typically study systems up to a few hundred sites .",
    "this behavior is also likely to preclude a reliable scaling estimate of its asymptotic value .",
    "our results suggest that the product of the exponents of the singlet pairing and of the charge ordering is larger than one at finite distance for non - zero electron - phonon coupling .",
    "consequently , observing a charge exponent larger than one does not automatically imply that the singlet pairing correlation is the dominant instability .",
    "_ thus although @xmath34 in the asymptotic limit , in a finite size system the value of @xmath74 not only depends on the system size but also on the forward scatterings strengths_.     ln[o_{ss}(b , x)]}{ln[o_{cdw}(0,x ) ] ln[o_{ss}(0,x)]}$ ] , versus the scaled electron - phonon coupling , @xmath64 , at various distances , @xmath73 , for @xmath75 , scaledwidth=48.0% ]    the deviation from one is enhanced by the scaled electron - phonon coupling , @xmath64 , and suppressed by the distance , @xmath73 .",
    "these results are consistent with the charge exponent obtained in a quantum monte carlo study,@xcite in which the charge exponent is larger than one and increases with electron - phonon coupling . in addition",
    ", the quantum monte carlo calculations also found that the charge exponents decrease with increasing system size.@xcite    our results show that even if all the non - linear operators , which are always present and especially important in the half - filling case , are irrelevant and renormalized to zero and the holstein model is in the gapless regime which can be described in terms of ll , the charge exponent alone _ at finite distance _ can not resolve the competition between the charge ordering and the singlet superconducting pairing .",
    "in fact , the  two - cutoff \" renormalization group@xcite calculations have shown that the charge gap is always opened by the umklapp scatterings.@xcite similarly , multiscale renormalization group approaches which systematically renormalize the frequency dependences of the couplings@xcite also ruled out the existence of dominant singlet pairing due to the contribution from the dynamical umklapp scatterings at high energy.@xcite further , a recent study once again confirmed the cdw phase and further discussed the quantum - classical crossover.@xcite    from the results of the correlation functions for the forward scatterings of eq .",
    "[ hhm ] , it is quite clear that using the relation , @xmath34 , to decide the dominating correlations in the gapless phase of the half - filled holstein model can lead to misleading results .",
    "we reiterate that the violation of this relation at finite system sizes is not because of the oscillating terms from normal ordering but because of the non - linear collective modes from the asymmetric coupling between the electrons and the dynamical phonons .",
    "our previous results make clear that we can not rely on the ll relations for the thermodynamic limit to determine the correlation exponents from finite size simulations of the holstein model .",
    "hence we turn instead to a numerical study of the full model ( eq .",
    "1 ) and use the projector determinantal monte carlo@xcite to determine the  ground state \" and its correlation functions of finite size systems .",
    "the  ground state \" ( @xmath76 ) is obtained by projecting the free fermion trial state ( @xmath77 ) as @xmath78 , in practice @xmath79 is set between @xmath80 .",
    "we use the @xmath76 to calculate the pairing correlation , @xmath56 , and the charge ordering correlation , @xmath55 , in the real space directly ,    @xmath81    where @xmath82 is the number of lattice sites . in the monte carlo calculation",
    ", we set @xmath83 , @xmath84 , and @xmath85 , so that the @xmath86 defined in eq .",
    "[ hhm ] is the same as the electron - phonon coupling @xmath87 defined in the ref .",
    "we show the correlation functions at different electron - phonon couplings in fig .",
    "[ correlations_mc ] . at zero electron - phonon coupling ,",
    "the holstein model is a free fermion theory , and the singlet pairing and charge ordering are degenerate ( the 1st row in the fig .",
    "[ correlations_mc ] ) .",
    "when the electron - phonon coupling is turned on , the charge ordering tends to decay more slowly , while the singlet pairing tends to decay faster , than in the free fermion case .",
    "the difference between them is expectedly small , possibly due to the exponentially small charge gap with respect to the electron - phonon coupling.@xcite turning to larger electron - phonon couplings , the difference between the two different orderings becomes more obvious . as we are using systems with modest sizes ( 22 and 46 sites with periodic boundary condition ) only , it is difficult to determine whether the charge ordering is long range or decays as a power law , but the data clearly show that the charge ordering is enhanced and the singlet pairing is suppressed as the electron - phonon coupling is increased . for fairly large electron - phonon couplings , _",
    "e.g. _ , @xmath88 ( the 6th row in fig .",
    "[ correlations_mc ] ) , our data show a clearer signal that the charge ordering tends to become long range , as the charge correlation changes only very slowly beyond a few lattice sites .",
    "we also calculate the luttinger charge exponent by the same method used previously for the holstein model,@xcite which found @xmath89 . using the set of data obtained in the same run for the correlation functions presented in fig .",
    "[ correlations_mc ] , we reproduce the result that the luttinger charge exponent is clearly above _ one _ at least for @xmath90 ( see fig . [ k_mc ] ) . using the ll relations would imply the dominant singlet pairing state for the model in this region ; however , from the correlation functions we know that the singlet pairing decays faster than the charge ordering and is thus not dominant .",
    "the @xmath89 obtained from _ finite size _",
    "calculations is not incompatible with the cdw correlation decaying slower than that of the ss .     and",
    "spin exponents @xmath50 for different electron - phonon couplings .",
    "@xmath82 is the number of lattice sites.,scaledwidth=48.0% ]    from our monte carlo data , we can conclude that singlet pairing is not the dominant instability for any range of electron - phonon coupling ( although , strictly speaking , numerical data can hardly provide a conclusive answer for @xmath91 ) .",
    "this provides a reasonably convincing answer to question ( ii ) .",
    "the most prominent open question is whether the long range cdw ordering or equivalently the charge gap can be destroyed by the quantum fluctuations from the dynamical phonons as the electron - phonon coupling is decreased below a certain value .",
    "perturbative renormalization group approaches have consistently shown that the charge part is always gapped and thus the cdw is long range.@xcite this is ultimately related to the fact that the continuous spin rotation symmetry is broken by any finite phonon frequency which leads to a relevant umklapp scattering .",
    "this result already appears in the perturbative renormalization group approaches within a second - order perturbation approximation . for a metallic phase to be obtained in a perturbative renormalization group approach for the holstein model ,",
    "in particular for degenerate cdw and ss phase to be obtained , the summation of all the higher order terms in the perturbation series would have to cancel exactly the second order contribution to restore the spin rotation symmetry .",
    "this is an unlikely scenario , and there is no convincing argument for why this should happen .    on the other hand , to determine precisely the nature of the ground state from numerical calculations for very weak couplings is challenging , as the charge gap is exponentially small with respect to the electron - phonon coupling , even within the mean field approximation ( @xmath92 ) .",
    "quantum fluctuations from the dynamical phonons will further suppress it , especially at large phonon frequency.@xcite nonetheless , recent density matrix renormalization group studies did argue for the metallic phase , and further claimed that there are two types of metallic phases in both holstein and holstein - hubbard model.@xcite one of the metallic phases is gapless in both the spin and charge sectors , which normally implies that either triplet superconducting pairing or spin density wave ordering is the dominant power - law decaying ordering@xcite , even though spin fluctuations are completely absent in the holstein model .",
    "more elaborate calculations using monte carlo algorithms which can directly extract the pairing correlations for much larger system sizes may provide further insight.@xcite    although we can not rule out the possibility of a metallic phase from this study , it is quite clear that the holstein model in one dimension does not support dominant superconducting correlations for the half - filled case .",
    "this is due to the relevant umklapp scattering from the perspective of the perturbative renormalization group,@xcite which is supposed to be reliable from weak to intermediate coupling . in general",
    ", breaking the particle - hole symmetry alone,@xcite by , for example , including non - linear term for the phonon , is probably not sufficient to induce dominant superconducting correlation.@xcite the crucial point is to weaken the contribution from the particle - hole channel by removing the nesting condition .",
    "theoretically , this can be achieved by introducing long range hopping terms or doping away from the half - filling.@xcite",
    "in this paper we have examined the nature and applicability of using the ll relations to determine the possible existence and the nature of a proposed metallic ground state of the one - dimensional half - filled holstein model .",
    "we conclude by reiterating our answers to the three questions posed in our introduction .",
    "( i ) the ll scaling relation @xmath34 is valid only in the limit of infinite size systems ; for finite size systems there are corrections that lead to @xmath89 .",
    "( ii ) for a wide range of electron - phonon coupling , the dominant correlation for finite size systems in the holstein model is the cdw .",
    "( iii ) although the cdw seems to be always the dominant correlation , without a direct study of the gap  which is expected to be exponentially small with respect to the electron - phonon coupling and thus very challenging to study numerically  we can not rule out the possibility of a charge gapless",
