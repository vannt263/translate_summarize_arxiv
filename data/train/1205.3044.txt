    "h. whitney @xcite investigated singularities which are unavoidable by small perturbation , and found the singularity type , which is called whitney umbrellas ( or cross - caps ) .",
    "this singularity type is very important , since it is the only singularity of a map of a surface to 3-dimensional euclidean space which is stable under small deformations .",
    "it is natural to investigate whitney umbrellas as a subject of differential geometry , and there are several articles @xcite in this direction .    in the authors previous work @xcite , we introduce some differential geometric ingredients ( principal curvatures , ridge , sub - parabolic points , etc . ) for whitney umbrellas , and investigate singularities and versal unfoldings of distance squared functions on whitney umbrellas in terms of these ingredients . to develop the differential geometric ingredients , we consider the double oriented blowing - up ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* example ( a ) in p. 221 ) ) @xmath0 and a map , which is usually called a blow - up , @xmath1\\to(r\\cos\\theta , r\\sin\\theta),\\ ] ] where @xmath2 denotes the quotient space of @xmath3 with identification @xmath4 .",
    "we remark that @xmath2 is topologically a mbius strip .",
    "there is a well - defined unit normal vector via @xmath5 , thus we obtain the information on the asymptotic behavior of the principal curvatures and the principal directions .",
    "moreover , we also obtain the configuration of the parabolic line ( or ridge lines , or sub - parabolic lines ) on @xmath2 near the exceptional set @xmath6 .    in this paper , we investigate the relationships between singularities of height functions on whitney umbrellas and these differential geometric ingredients for whitney umbrellas , and the versality of the family of height functions .",
    "we also study intersections of a whitney umbrella and hyperplanes through its singular point .",
    "height functions are a fundamental tool for the study of the differential geometry of submanifolds .",
    "several authors have studied the geometrical properties of submanifolds in euclidean space by analyzing the singularities of height functions on submanifolds ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "the intersection of a surface and a hyperplane is intimately related to the height function on the surface .",
    "in particular , for a regular surface in @xmath7 , the contact between the surface and a hyperplane is measured by the singularity type of the height function on the surface .",
    "for instance , when the contact of a point @xmath8 is @xmath9 type ( i.e. , the height function has an @xmath9 singularity ) , the intersection of the surface and the hyperplane at @xmath8 , which is the tangent plane at @xmath8 , is locally an isolated point or a pair of transverse curves ( see , for example , @xcite ) .    in section  2 , we recall the differential geometric ingredients developed in @xcite . in section  3 , we investigate singularities and versal unfoldings of heigh functions on whitney umbrella in terms of the differential geometry which is discussed in section 2 .",
    "theorem [ thm : main1 ] shows that the relationship of the singularities of the height functions and the differential geometric ingredients for whitney umbrellas . in section  4 ,",
    "we study the local intersections of a whitney umbrella and hyperplanes through the singular point . to detect local singularity types of the intersections of a surface with hyperplanes",
    ", we must investigate how the zero set of the height function on the surface is mapped to the surface .",
    "for a regular surface , it is trivial , since the contact of the surface between hyperplanes is measured by the singularities of the height function on the surface . on the other hand , for a whitney umbrella , we must investigate how the zero set of the height function on the whitney umbrella contacts with the double point locus @xmath10 in the parameter space .",
    "theorem  [ thm : main2 ] shows that if the hyperplane @xmath11 through the whitney umbrella singularity does not contain the tangent line to @xmath10 on the surface then the contact of the whitney umbrella and @xmath11 at the singularity is measured by the type of singularities of the height function , and that if @xmath11 contains the tangent to @xmath10 on the surface then the contact of the whitney umbrella and @xmath11 is measured by the type of singularities of the height function and the contact between the zero set of the height function and @xmath10 in parameter space .",
    "hence , theorem [ thm : main2 ] is considered to be an analogous theorem of montaldi @xcite for whitey umbrellas .",
    "in this section , we recall the differential geometry of whitney umbrellas , which is obtained in @xcite .    a smooth map germ @xmath12 is a _ whitney umbrella _ if @xmath13 is @xmath14-equivalent to the map germ @xmath15 defined by @xmath16 . here",
