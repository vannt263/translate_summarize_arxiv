    "matter - antimatter interaction produces more energy per unit mass than any other means of energy production . for example , proton - antiproton annihilation releases 275 times more energy in the form of kinetic energy of charged particles than nuclear fission or @xmath0 fusion .",
    "this energy is released by simple contact of antimatter with matter so that , in principle , no ignition energy is required to start the reaction .",
    "it is therefore not surprising that the concept of using antimatter as an energy source has been in scientific literature for decades @xcite .",
    "other practical applications of antimatter are under consideration .",
    "for example , antimatter propulsion systems @xcite , space based power generators @xcite , directed energy weapons @xcite , cancer therapy @xcite . finally , both edward teller @xcite and andrei sakharov @xcite",
    ", the key scientists in charge of the development of the h - bomb in their respective countries , show in their published scientific works a big interest in the annihilation properties of antimatter , the nuclear process that after fission and fusion could lead to a third generation of nuclear bombs .",
    "this paper is a summary of a comprehensive assessment of the feasibility of producing large quantities of antiprotons and using them for igniting inertial - confinement fusion pellets or triggering large scale thermonuclear explosions @xcite .",
    "when a particle meets it s antiparticle they annihilate and the energy equivalent to their total mass ( @xmath4 ) is converted into various new particles and kinetic energy @xcite . in the case of proton - antiproton annihilation , many different reaction channels are possible , each resulting in the production of a different number of charged and neutral particles .",
    "a good approximation is that three charged and two neutral pions are produced on the average . since neutral pions quickly decay into photons , the typical @xmath5 annihilation process is as follows : @xmath6 where @xmath7  mev and @xmath8  mev .",
    "an antiproton can also annihilate with a neutron , in which case mostly pions are produced again , in numbers , on the average , similar to @xmath5 annihilation .",
    "antiprotons , antineutrons and positrons can combine to form antinuclei , antiatoms , antimolecules .",
    "annihilation occurs when the two kinds of matter come sufficiently close to one other . even at some distance",
    ", a neutral atom and a neutral antiatom will attract each other by van der waals forces @xcite . as a consequence , storage of _ antiatoms _ in a container made of matter",
    "is impossible in general .",
    "however , there may exist metastable states of _ antiprotons _ in normal matter @xcite .",
    "when a @xmath9 annihilates in a hydrogen plasma , essentially all the annihilation energy is radiated in the form of very energetic pions and photons . at solid hydrogen densities ,",
    "the mean free path of the 187  mev photons is 25  m , so that they will not loose energy in the plasma . however , the three 236  mev charged pions will loose energy by multiple coulomb interactions with the electrons at a rate approximately given by : @xmath10  mev / cm in solid @xmath11 or @xmath0 and 2.06  mev / cm in @xmath1 .",
    "if we now assume that annihilation takes place at the center of a sphere , the energy @xmath12 deposited within a radius @xmath13  cm is only 1.5  mev out of the total 1876  mev annihilation energy .",
    "there are however several ways to improve energy deposition , and thus plasma heating .",
    "firstly , the fuel to be heated may be compressed by a factor @xmath3 , @xmath14 will then be multiplied by @xmath3 , and thus @xmath12 by @xmath15 .",
    "but compression requires energy .",
    "secondly , fuels such as @xmath1 , which contain more electrons , have a proportionally larger @xmath14 .",
    "however , their thermonuclear ignition temperature is also higher .",
    "finally , annihilation may take place with a nucleus .",
    "when a @xmath9 annihilates with a nucleon from a nucleus , because of the fermi motion of the annihilated nucleon , the nucleus will recoil with an energy of about 20 mev .",
    "furthermore , each of the 5 annihilation pions has a probability of colliding with the rest of the nucleus .",
    "hence , the average total energy deposition in a sphere is @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the number of charged pions and @xmath18 the local energy deposition by the recoiling nucleus and the various pion - nucleus interaction debris .    in the case of @xmath9 annihilation with deuterium or tritium",
    "@xmath18 is approximately 12  mev on the average , about half of the fermi energy . with heavy nuclei",
    "there have been many theoretical speculations in the absence of measurements .",
    "the first of these was introduced by duerr and teller @xcite , who speculated that an antiproton would find a very strong ( 900  mev ) attractive potential when getting close to a nucleus .",
    "more recently @xcite , los alamos scientists have calculated that annihilation in carbon would result in the local energy deposition of about 100  mev .",
    "recent measurements at cern show that it is in fact only 33  mev in carbon @xcite .",
    "low energy @xmath9 s annihilate mostly at the surface of nuclei , and thus local energy deposition follows a @xmath19 dependence on atomic weight . in effect , the cern data is compatible with the expression : @xmath20}.\\ ] ] hence , for @xmath9 annihilation in @xmath11 , @xmath0 or @xmath1 , @xmath21 is always about 3 and @xmath18 is approximately equal to 0 , 12 or 22 mev respectively .",
    "a matter - antimatter plasma is obtained if some initially stable particle - antiparticle mixture is suddenly ignited .",
    "the annihilation rate of two interacting species , with number densities @xmath22 and @xmath23 , is @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the annihilation reaction rate averaged over the maxwell distribution .    in a @xmath26 plasma",
    ", equation holds for both protons and electrons with @xmath27 initially .",
    "hence , for a given temperature @xmath28 if we assume @xmath29  kev , @xmath25 is approximately the same for both @xmath30 and @xmath5 annihilation .",
    "thus the electron and the proton populations deplete at the same rate , with a time constant of 5  ns for @xmath31  g/@xmath32 .",
    "when matter and antimatter come into contact , annihilation primarily takes place in a boundary layer in which particles and antiparticles are mixing .",
    "the thickness of this matter - antimatter plasma is of the order of the antimatter mean - free - path in matter , i.e. , @xmath33 . a first approximation , assuming that whenever an antiparticle penetrates into the boundary layer it instantly annihilates , is an annihilation rate per element area given by the total number of antiparticles impinging on that surface . from the maxwell velocity distribution one",
    "gets @xmath34 the @xmath35 annihilation rate is thus @xmath36 times the @xmath9 annihilation rate .",
    "however , since the @xmath37 plasma debye length is much smaller than the boundary layer thickness , plasma charge neutrality insures that the antimatter flow rate is determined by the slowest annihilation rate .",
    "therefore , if @xmath37 s interact with the walls of a closed cavity , annihilation results in an overall decrease of the antimatter density within the cavity .",
    "let us now take the case of a sphere of solid antihydrogen that is suddenly put in contact with a collapsing spherical shell of compressed @xmath0 . to solve eq .",
    "one has to calculate the increase in the @xmath37 plasma internal energy by the pions and other particles from @xmath9 annihilation in the surrounding @xmath0 : @xmath38 where @xmath39  cm is the approximate range of the 20  mev recoil protons from @xmath9 annihilation in @xmath0 , and @xmath40 ( initially equal to @xmath41 ) the number of @xmath37 atoms . for hydrogen @xmath42",
    ", we get a system of equations for the @xmath37 plasma density and temperature . if annihilation is much faster than the collapse of the cavity ( @xmath43 constant ) the solution of eqs .   and",
    "is @xmath44 for @xmath45 , which corresponds to @xmath46  cm , we find @xmath47  kev and @xmath48  ns .",
    "thus , in about @xmath49  ns , over 90% of the antihydrogen in the sphere is annihilated .",
    "this time constant is compatible with the requirements of instantaneous thermalization and inertial confinement of the plasma .",
    "the most efficient way to trigger a thermonuclear explosion is probably to start a thermonuclear detonation wave in @xmath1 by collapsing a hollow sphere of that material on a tiny spherical pellet of solid antihydrogen .    in the spark model of thermonuclear ignition ,",
    "an outgoing spherical detonation wave starts if : ( a ) a critical amount of energy @xmath50 is deposited in the center of the sphere ( the `` spark '' region ) and ( b ) if the temperature within this volume is higher than a critical temperature @xmath51 . without compression , one has @xmath52  kev and @xmath53  kev for solid @xmath0 , and @xmath54  kev and @xmath55  kev for @xmath1 .",
    "however , for a compressed thermonuclear fuel at temperature @xmath51 , the critical energy decreases with the square of the compression factor @xmath3 .",
    "the number @xmath40 of @xmath9 annihilations necessary to induce a thermonuclear burn wave can be estimated by supposing that annihilation takes place at the center of the sphere to be ignited .",
    "thus , from equation , condition ( a ) is satisfied if @xmath56 since the pions originate from the center , the temperature in the fuel goes as @xmath57 .",
    "therefore , for simplicity , we require that condition ( b ) is satisfied for the average temperature within the critical volume .",
    "thus @xmath58 where @xmath59 and @xmath60 are respectively equal to 2 and 2.5 for @xmath0 , and 6 and 9.5 for @xmath1 .",
    "taking @xmath61 , a modest compression factor , and solving eqs .   and for @xmath40 and the spark radius @xmath62 , one finds @xmath63 and @xmath64  cm for @xmath0 , and @xmath65 and @xmath66  cm for @xmath1 .",
    "however , because of some of the simplifying assumptions made , these results may be somewhat pessimistic .",
    "hence , we will assume that @xmath67 @xmath9 s are sufficient to trigger the thermonuclear explosion of compressed @xmath0 or @xmath1 pellets .    for thermonuclear explosions in the kiloton range",
    ", chemical explosives may be used to implode the @xmath1 shells . for low yield explosions such as in x - ray laser pumping or icf ,",
    "compression factors higher than 30 can be achieved using magnetic compression , beams or other techniques .",
    "however , antiproton induced fusion will remain an attractive alternative to normal icf only if the compression factor is kept relatively small , i.e. , less than 300 , giving a number of @xmath9 s of the order of @xmath68 .",
    "the production of @xmath68 @xmath9 s for each antimatter triggered icf pellet would require an energy investment of at least @xmath69  mj @xcite .",
    "it will therefore be very difficult to achieve energy break - even in power generating reactors using annihilation techniques .",
    "moreover , the technologies for producing @xmath9 s with high energy accelerator systems , and the means for manipulating and storing sizable amounts of @xmath37 are extremely complicated .",
    "for instance , a plant of the size required to produce the antimatter needed for one thermonuclear bomb trigger a day ( @xmath70 g of @xmath37 or @xmath67 @xmath37 atoms per day ) could consist of several 10 s of accelerators and storage rings , and could require as many as several large nuclear power plants to supply the electricity @xcite .",
    "a study by the rand corporation gives a cost estimate of $ 500 to 1000 million for a prototype factory providing 10 to 100  micrograms , and $ 5 to 15 billion for a full production factory with an output of about 10  mg per year @xcite . as a consequence ,",
    "civilian applications of antimatter for power production are very unlikely .",
    "directed energy weapons applications may include the triggering of thermonuclear plasma jets , and x - ray or gamma - ray laser pumping . in the event of a comprehensive test ban treaty",
    ", antimatter would provide a means for inducing laboratory and small scale thermonuclear explosions in a yield range which can not easily be covered by underground explosions or classical icf systems @xcite .",
    "of course , many technical problems will have to be solved @xcite .",
    "in particular , the levitation of a frozen @xmath37 pellet within a 1  mm diameter cryostat at the heart of a complex thermonuclear device is a tremendous challenge for materials microtechnology .",
    "however , if metastable states of @xmath9 s in @xmath71 , @xmath72 or possibly @xmath73 compounds are discovered , much simpler designs could be considered .",
