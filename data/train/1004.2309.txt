    "syntheses of superheavy nuclei ( shn ) becomes an active and exciting field in modern nuclear physics .",
    "up to now shn with @xmath5 except @xmath6 have been synthesized in experiment .",
    "superheavy elements allow nuclear physicists to explore concepts such as magic numbers and the island of stability , which help us understand the nuclear structure properties in superheavy region . in recent experiments on shn , on the one hand , @xmath0-decay is indispensable to the identification of new elements via the observation of @xmath0-decay from an unknown parent nucleus to a known daughter one since the dominant decay mode for shn is @xmath0-decay . on the other hand ,",
    "experimentalists need the half - life values to design the experiments .",
    "moreover , measurements on the @xmath0-decays provide reliable information on nuclear structure , such as ground state energies , ground state half - lives , nuclear spins and parities , shell effects , nuclear deformation and shape coexistence @xcite .",
    "therefore , as one of the most important decay channels for unstable nuclei , @xmath0-decay has been extensively investigated both experimentally and theoretically . from the theoretical point of view",
    ", @xmath0-decay is regarded as an @xmath0 particle tunneling through a potential barrier between an @xmath0 particle and a daughter nucleus , and many theoretical models have been applied to investigate the @xmath0-decay , such as the cluster model @xcite , generalized liquid drop model ( gldm ) @xcite , density - dependent m3y ( ddm3y ) effective interaction @xcite and coupled channel approach @xcite .",
    "some physically plausible formulas also have been employed to calculate the @xmath0-decay half - lives directly @xcite .",
    "a unified fission model ( ufm ) has been employed to study the proton radioactivity by balasubramaniam and arunachalam @xcite , and it was used to extract the preformation factor of cluster in cluster radioactivity in our previous work @xcite . in this work , the ufm @xcite is used to study the @xmath0-decay , in which the assault frequency is treated with a new approach .",
    "it is well known that the most important decay parameters for @xmath0-decay of shn are the @xmath1 value as well as the half - life , and @xmath1 value is a key factor for the @xmath0-decay half - life calculation .",
    "the half - life is extremely sensitive to the @xmath1 value and an uncertainty of 1 mev in @xmath1 corresponds to an uncertainty of @xmath0-decay half - life ranging from @xmath7 to @xmath8 times for the heavy element region @xcite .",
    "therefore , an accurate formula of @xmath1 value is crucial for the half - life prediction .",
    "however , the calculated @xmath1 value with the extant methods is difficult to achieve a good accuracy .",
    "therefore , we derive an expression of @xmath1 value based on the liquid drop model , which can be used as an input to quantitatively predict the half - lives of unknown nuclei .",
    "the half - life of a parent nucleus decaying via @xmath0 emission can be calculated by means of the wkb barrier penetration probability . in the ufm , the decay constant",
    "is simply defined as @xmath9 and half - life can be obtained by @xmath10 . here",
    "@xmath11 is the assault frequency which will be addressed in detail later .",
    "the barrier penetrability @xmath12 is given by @xmath13,\\ ] ] where @xmath14 and @xmath15 are incoming and outgoing points with @xmath16 .",
    "the potential @xmath17 is composed of the repulsive long range coulomb potential , the attractive short range nuclear proximity potential and the centrifugal potential for @xmath18 , but for @xmath19 , @xmath17 is parameterized simply as a polynomial .",
    "here @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the radii of the parent nucleus , daughter one and emitted particle respectively , which are given by @xcite @xmath23 in a word , the potential @xmath17 takes the form @xmath24 where @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the charge numbers of the emitted particle and daughter nucleus , respectively .",
    "the coefficients @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 in the polynomial can be determined by the following boundary conditions    \\(1 ) at @xmath30 , @xmath31 ;    \\(2 ) at @xmath32 , @xmath33 ;    \\(3 ) at @xmath32 , @xmath34 .",
    "+ the third condition ensures the smooth potential curve , which is different from the previous ufm .",
    "@xmath14 is the internal turning point with @xmath31 , which differs from refs .",
    "@xcite where the barrier penetration probabilities were calculated from two touching spheres ( @xmath35 ) .",
    "therefore , the formation process of cluster or @xmath0-particle was not be taken into account and hence one can extract the preformation factor by combining with the experimental half - life . in our calculations with the present potential barrier ,",
    "however , the penetrability has been evaluated from @xmath14 , hence the process of formation of @xmath0-particle has been considered to a great extent , as has been pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite : the preformation probability can be calculated within a fission model as a penetrability of the internal part of the barrier , which corresponds to still overlapping fragments .",
    "@xmath15 is given by @xmath36 @xmath37 in the potential is the nuclear proximity potential taking the form @xmath38 where ssmann central radii are @xmath39 and @xmath40 fm is the surface width . the nuclear surface tension coefficient @xmath41 is given as @xmath42 \\text { \\ \\ mev}\\cdot \\text{fm}^{-2},\\ ] ] where @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 represent the neutron , proton and mass numbers of the parent nucleus . the universal function @xmath46 is determined by the following formula @xcite @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the overlap distance in units of @xmath49 between the colliding surfaces .",
    "we propose a new approach to deal with the assault frequency phenomenologically . assuming that the @xmath0 particle vibrates in a harmonic oscillator potential @xmath50 with a classical frequency @xmath51 and a reduced mass @xmath52 after formation , by employing the virial theorem , we obtain @xmath53 where @xmath54 and @xmath55 are the radial quantum number ( corresponding to the number of nodes ) and angular momentum quantum number , respectively .",
    "@xmath56 is the root - mean - square radius of @xmath0 particle distribution in quantum mechanics and that it equals to the rms radius @xmath57 of nucleus is assumed here .",
    "it is farfetched that the assault frequency is understood with a classical method that the @xmath0 particle moving back and forth inside the nucleus due to the wave properties of the @xmath0 particle .",
    "we identify the oscillation frequency @xmath58 with the assault frequency , which is related to the oscillation frequency @xmath51 @xmath59 the relationship of @xmath60 @xcite is used here .",
    "@xmath61 is the principal quantum number . for @xmath0-decay , we take the form as in ref .",
    "@xcite @xmath62 the order of magnitude of @xmath11 is @xmath63 s@xmath64 for @xmath0-decay .",
    "as have been pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite , the quantum number @xmath65 can have an uncertainty of 2 due to the simple application of wildermuth rule to heavy nuclei that involve shell mixtures , but not serious .",
    "the calculations are performed in the framework of spherical shape , which is partly equivalent to averaging the deformed potential to a spherical case .",
    "recently , some authors investigated the @xmath0-decay in the framework of the deformed version of the @xmath0-decay model . we would point out that the centrifugal barrier should not take the form of @xmath66 because @xmath55 is not a good quantum number for the deformed potential .",
    "the @xmath0-decay half - lives of shn calculated with the ufm using the experimental @xmath1 values and without considering the centrifugal barrier are given in table i. the results obtained with the ddm3y effective interaction and the gldm also have been shown for comparison .",
    "the results from the ufm are in fair agreement with the experimental data indicating that the ufm taking account of the assault frequency with the phenomenological method is a useful tool to investigate the half - lives of @xmath0-decay when the experimental @xmath1 values are given .",
    "the ddm3y effective interaction overestimates but gldm underestimates the half - lives on the whole .",
    "there is no doubt that the ddm3y interaction and gldm are very successful due to the appropriate considerations in the microscopic level in the ddm3y interaction and the quasi - molecular shape in the gldm .",
    "the deviations might result from the fact that empirical assault frequencies they used are too rough .",
    "the ufm is quite simple compared to the gldm and ddm3y interaction , but provides the excellent results .",
    "another obvious advantage is that the proximity potential for proton , @xmath0 and cluster emission can be written in a unified manner , which means these different decay modes can be easily treated in a unified framework . for some nuclei belonging to @xmath67113 , @xmath68111 and @xmath69111 @xmath0-decay chains , the half - lives from the ufm as well as other models",
    "are underestimated by a few times possibly due to the nonzero angular momentum transfers , which reduce the tunneling probability and increase the half - life . however , as no experimental evidence is available for the spin - parity of the levels involved in the decay , we have not included the centrifugal barrier in the calculations .",
    "recently , the new isotope @xmath70hs has been produced in the reaction @xmath71pb(@xmath72fe , n)@xmath70hs at the 88-inch cyclotron of the lawrence berkeley national laboratory @xcite .",
    "there are three @xmath0-particle energy groups at @xmath73 , @xmath74 , and @xmath75 mev observed in experiment . the calculated half - life of @xmath76 ms assuming @xmath73 mev ( @xmath77 mev ) is closest to the experimental data of @xmath78 ms which indicates the group of the @xmath73 mev is perhaps the dominant transition among the three groups .",
    "it is an interesting phenomenon that most of odd - a or odd - odd shn are longer - lived than the even - even ones around them which perhaps indicates the stability of odd - a or odd - odd nuclei over the even - even ones . on the one hand",
    ", the small preformation probability could prolong the @xmath0-decay half - life since the dominant decay mode for shn is @xmath0-decay .",
    "on the other hand , the possible centrifugal barrier reduces tunneling probability and hence increases the lifetime .",
    "this problem needs to be studied further .",
    "the odd - a isotopes of all the elements with @xmath79 and @xmath80 , which lie in the neighborhood of the even - even isotopes , have been observed .",
    "this may suggest that @xmath81118 and @xmath82118 can be the good candidates to be synthesized in laboratory since the new element @xmath83118 has been synthesized .",
    "it is well known that the @xmath1 value is a crucial quantity to determine the @xmath0-decay half - life . up to now , however , there has been nearly no approach that can provide an accurate @xmath1 value theoretically with deviation less than 0.5 mev , leading to the prediction of half - life with a good accuracy a very difficult work .",
    "here we introduce a quantity @xmath84 } { % \\partial q_{\\alpha}}\\right\\vert,\\ ] ] which describes the @xmath1 value dependence of @xmath0-decay half - life .",
    "to show the behavior of @xmath85 values more obviously , we calculate the @xmath85 values including heavy nuclei ranging from @xmath86 to @xmath87 , and show the results in fig",
    "one could notice that , the @xmath85 value decreases with increasing of the atomic number @xmath44 on the whole .",
    "this indicates the half - life becomes more and more insensitive to @xmath1 value .",
    "for instance , the increase of @xmath1 value by 0.4 mev leads to the half - life decrease by only one order of magnitude for @xmath83118 , but five orders of magnitude for @xmath88sm .",
    "this is an advantage for us to predict the @xmath0-decay half - lives of shn since they are not so sensitive to @xmath1 value as for medium - heavy nuclei . for some nuclei near the @xmath89 closure shell ,",
    "the @xmath85 values are low because they are strongly affected by the shell effect .",
    "we present the @xmath85 values of even - even po , rn , ra and th isotopes in fig .",
    "2 . one can find that the larger the atomic number of an element , the lower the @xmath85 values , which further confirms what we have discussed above .",
    "the @xmath85 value changes smoothly before @xmath90 , but decreases sharply from @xmath90 to @xmath91 , and increases rapidly after @xmath91 with increasing of neutron number , indicating the shell effect plays an important role in the behavior of @xmath85 value .",
    "this fact suggests that for a given superheavy element , the isotopes at the beginning of the closed shell are more insensitive to @xmath1 values .",
    "[ table1 ]    [ cols=\"<,<,<,<,<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "in summary , the half - lives of @xmath0-decay for shn have been investigated in the framework of a ufm with a new method for assault frequency .",
    "no adjustable parameter has been involved in the calculations .",
    "the results of the present calculations using the ufm are in excellent agreement with the experimental data .",
    "for some nuclei in @xmath67113 , @xmath68111 and @xmath69111 @xmath0-decay chains , the half - lives from the ufm together with other models are underestimated by a few times possibly due to the nonzero angular momentum transfers .",
    "we also find that @xmath1 value dependence of @xmath0-decay half - life becomes increasing weaker as the atomic number increases on the whole , which implies that the uncertainty of the @xmath0-decay half - life due to the uncertainty of @xmath1 value is smaller for heavier nuclei and thus it is exactly what we expect to predict @xmath0-decay half - life of shn . and",
    "the isotopes at the beginning of the closed shell are more insensitive to @xmath1 values .",
    "finally , a local formula was proposed to calculate the @xmath1 values for the nuclei with @xmath2 and @xmath3 . according to this formula in combination with the experimental data ,",
    "the possible proton shell gaps exist at @xmath92 and 110 , and long - lived shn should be neutron rich .",
    "the half - lives of isotope of @xmath4 which perhaps will be observed in the near future , are predicted by using the ufm combing with this formula .",
