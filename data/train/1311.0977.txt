    "rough boundary problems have many practical applications in aerodynamics , electromagnetism , hydrodynamics and hemodynamics , etc .",
    "direct numerical computation around rough boundaries is usually out of reach for the time being since the problems have both macroscopic and microscopic scales and hence need lots of computational burden .",
    "therefore one usually changes the boundary condition on rough boundary with a new boundary condition on a regularized fictitious boundary close to the rough boundary , that is so - called a _ wall - law_. for viscous fluid flows , no - slip boundary condition at the rough wall is replaced by a type of navier slip boundary condition , _ navier wall - law _ , at the fictitious boundary . the derivation of navier wall - laws are also important for shape optimization of roughness for better drag reduction since the procedure of shape optimization for drag reduction requires to know _ a priori _ the navier s coefficient in the slip boundary condition .    in this article",
    "we study effective wall - laws for the stokes system @xmath5 where @xmath6 is a bounded and simply connected domain and its sufficiently smooth boundary @xmath7 consists of a nonoscillatory part and a rough part formed by locally periodic microscopic rugosities of characteristic size @xmath3 .",
    "boundary data is assumed to be supported in the nonoscillatory part of @xmath7 .",
    "there is a number of papers dealing with effective wall - laws for stokes and navier - stokes equations , see e.g. @xcite and the references therein for the case of periodic roughness and @xcite for the case of nonperiodic random roughness .",
    "moreover , one can find results concerning explicit or implicit wall - laws for poisson equations , see , e.g. @xcite . here",
    ", we note that the poisson equations describe simplified flows which are uniform in longitudinal direction .",
    "the main techniques used to derive effective wall - laws are domain decomposition and multiscale asymptotic expansions .",
    "most rough boundaries we meet in reality are curved boundaries , and for practical applications , results of flat rough boundaries may be applied to curved rough boundary problems with small curvature to some extent . however , if the curvature is considerably large , for more accurate analysis near the rough surfaces and for determination of micro - roughness shape giving better performance of drag reduction , the curved rough boundary must be considered as it is .",
    "we note that most of above mentioned references concern the flat rough boundaries , while for references dealing with wall - laws for curved rough boundaries , we refer to e.g. @xcite . in a pioneering work",
    "@xcite a first order wall - law for the poisson equation in a ring with many small holes near the outer boundary was obtained using domain decomposition techniques . later , in @xcite ,",
    "first and second order wall - laws for poisson equations in general two - dimensional annular domains with curved rough boundaries were obtained by combining techniques of domain decomposition and two - scale asymptotic expansions .",
    "we note that two - dimensional problems correspond to the case where longitudinal grooves form rough surfaces .",
    "wall - laws for multi - dimensional poisson problem over curved rough boundary were obtained in @xcite .",
    "more precisely , for poisson problem with homogeneous dirichlet boundary condition on curved compact boundary with locally periodic roughness on it the authors constructed suitable approximations of @xmath1-order in @xmath2-norm and @xmath3-order in energy norm based on analysis of a boundary layer cell problem .",
    "then , a wall - law with the same order of error estimates as the approximations in interior domains was derived .",
    "we refer to a review article @xcite for more details on the derivation and analysis of wall laws of fluid flows .    motivated by @xcite , in this article we address derivation of wall - laws for _ inhomogeneous boundary value problem for the stokes systems _ over curved rough boundaries .",
    "we note that the system may be used to analyze exterior fluid flows , if the boundary has two components and boundary data is supported only in outer non - oscillatory boundary part . furthermore ,",
    "if the rough boundary part and non - oscillatory boundary part are adjacent , the system may be used for local analysis of fluid flows near a curved rough surface that can be a part of boundary of any type of objects .    to achieve our goal , first , we analyse a boundary layer cell problem depending on the geometry of the fictitious boundary and roughness shape , that is elliptic in the sense of agmon , douglis and nirenberg , see @xmath8 in subsection 3.2 , by using technique of fourier series expansion",
    ". then we construct boundary layer approximations of @xmath1-order in @xmath2-norm and @xmath3-order in energy norm using the orthogonal tangential vectors and normal vector on the fictitious surface . using these approximations",
    "we obtain an effective navier wall - law which is shown to be irrespective of the choice of the orthogonal tangential vector fields and has error of @xmath1-order in @xmath2-norm and @xmath3-order in @xmath4-norm .",
    "the main theorems of the paper are theorems [ t3.14 ] , [ t3.15 ] and [ t3.20 ] .    dealing with the stokes system ,",
    "we are encountered with additional difficulties compared to the poisson problem , which are mainly related to the difference between vectorial and scalar case as well as the structural complicatedness of the stokes system over poisson equation .",
    "the main difference from the case of scalar poisson equation is that for the construction of the approximations and wall - laws we need to consider curvilinear systems of tangential vectors and normal vector on the fictitious surface ; we should take careful observations of dependence of approximations on the local curvilinear system .",
    "moreover , due to inhomogeneous boundary condition , we need some sophisticated techniques using cut - off functions in construction and estimates of boundary layer approximations so that artificial vertical layer flows around the nonoscillatory boundary part could not be generated thus ensuring the required approximation order near the edge between nonoscillatory and oscillating parts of boundary .    for simplicity",
    "we consider the case of spacial dimension @xmath9 , but the result of the paper can be directly extended to the case of @xmath10 without essential change .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we describe the rough domain considered in the paper and give the main notations .",
    "section 3 , the major part of the paper , consists of several subsections .",
    "estimates of dirichlet wall - law are given in subsection 3.1 and a boundary layer cell problem is analyzed in subsection 3.2 .",
    "subsections 3.3 and 3.4 concern the construction of local and global boundary layer correctors , respectively . in subsection",
    "3.5 boundary layer approximations are constructed and an effective navier wall - law with higher order error estimates is derived .",
    "finally , in appendix we give a refined analysis for divergence problem ensuring the estimate constant for a solution of divergence equation in our rough domain being independent of micro - roughness size @xmath0 .",
