    "weak gravitational lensing by large - scale structure , or `` cosmic shear '' , has emerged as a powerful cosmological probe , as it is directly sensitive to foreground mass ( for reviews , see * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "a measurement of cosmic shear is therefore closely tied to cosmological theories , which are principally concerned with the distribution of dark matter .",
    "in particular , the systematic biases of this technique are not limited by unknown physics such as biasing @xcite or the mass - temperature relation for x - ray selected galaxy clusters @xcite .",
    "cosmic shear surveys are rapidly growing in size and precision @xcite .",
    "cosmological parameter constraints from these surveys are now approaching the precision of other methods .",
    "however , cosmic shear surveys can be subject to several systematic biases of their own . imperfect telescope tracking , telescope flexure or optical misalignment within the camera , even at a level that is acceptable for most purposes , can artificially distort images and align the shapes of distant galaxies in a way that mimics cosmic shear .",
    "the survey described in this paper represents a culmination of effort at the william herschel telescope .",
    "we have combined the experience of instrumentalists with detailed image simulations and careful data analysis to control the various sources of systematic error .",
    "our first cosmic shear paper @xcite reported an initial detection of cosmic shear using a 0.5 square degree survey with the william herschel telescope ( wht ) . the second paper @xcite compared the wht shear signal with an independent measurement using the keck  ii telescope , and examined systematics from these two very different instruments . in this paper , we extend our wht survey to cover 4 square degrees to constrain cosmological parameters , while paying great care in monitoring and correcting systematic effects .",
    "we also now test our entire pipeline for shear measurement and cosmological parameter estimation by comparing it to external code , developed independently for the combo-17 survey by @xcite .",
    "this paper is organised as follows . in  [ observations ]",
    "we describe our survey strategy and observational parameters . in  [ results ] we present our results and draw constraints upon cosmological parameters . in  [ systematics ] we test for the absence of any systematic errors . in  [ mlb ] , we present a second set of results obtined via an independent shear measurement pipeline . we conclude in  [ conclusions ] .",
    "we have acquired 4 square degrees of imaging to @xmath0 ( for a point source at @xmath8 ) with the _ prime focus imaging camera _ ( pfic ) of the william herschel telescope on la palma .",
    "the median seeing was @xmath9 and no exposures had seeing worse than @xmath10 .",
    "the pixel size is @xmath11 .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig : skymap ] , pointings were scattered randomly in a pencil - beam survey between galactic latitudes of @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "this was tuned to provide @xmath14 stars per arcmin@xmath15 , with which we could measure the point spread function ( psf ) across each field .",
    "the only selection criterion was to avoid foreground stars brighter than @xmath16 in the digitised sky survey or apm ( automated plate measuring machine ) catalogues .",
    "cosmic shear statistics have already been presented from the first square degree of this survey in @xcite .",
    "that data consisted of eight @xmath17 images and eleven @xmath18 images taken after the addition of a second , identical ccd to the pfic . during june and august 2002 , we observed an additional 41 @xmath18 pointings .",
    "when combining statistical measurements from all of these fields , we weight the contribution of the large fields to be twice that of the small fields .",
    "this scheme is ideal for measurements on small angular scales , where the large fields do indeed contain twice as many pairs of galaxies as the small fields .",
    "the scheme is non - optimal in exploiting the extra signal on large scales contained via additional pairs across different ccds .",
    "however , in general , as both large and small fields were randomly deployed , no bias should result from our weighting scheme .    for each survey field we took four 900s exposures , each dithered by a few arcseconds from the last .",
    "this strategy enabled a continual monitoring of astrometric distortions within the telescope , cosmic ray removal , and lower overheads in the event of inclement weather .",
    "data reduction then proceeded for the exposures exactly as in @xcite : see that paper for more details .",
    "after bias subtraction and flat fielding , fringing remained in the @xmath19-band images .",
    "this could have been prevented by observing at a shorter wavelength , but at a cost to the observed number density of background sources . to remove this ,",
    "a fringe frame was compiled from all the exposures in each night .",
    "a multiple of this was subtracted from each image which minimised fringing , to a negligible level @xmath20% of the background noise .",
    "the four dithers for each field were then re - aligned ( using linear interpolation between adjacent pixels to allow sub - pixel offsets ) and stacked ( with @xmath21-clipping to remove cosmic rays ) .",
    "objects were located on the final images using hfindpeaks from the imcat package by ( * ? ? ? * ksb ) . following the recommendations of @xcite , objects within 10@xmath22 of saturated stars or 5@xmath22 of the edge of the ccds were masked and removed .",
    "we also removed noisy objects from the catalogue with cuts in size , signal - to - noise and ellipticity of @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "this is the same procedure to that adopted in @xcite , and leaves 15.2 galaxies per arcmin@xmath26 in the final catalogue , with a median magnitude of @xmath27 .",
    "according to @xcite as before , this corresponds to a median source redshift of @xmath28 .",
    "galaxies observed ellipticities , @xmath29 , were formed from combinations of their gaussian - weighted quadrupole moments , then corrected for convolution with the telescope s psf .",
    "the shape of the psf was measured from stars in each image , then interpolated to the positions of galaxies via a polynomial fit within each ccd separately .",
    "the order of this polynomial was varied from field to field : it was occasionally raised to fourth order but lowered to second order where possible .",
    "this limited spurious power on small scales and particularly around the edges of the field .",
    "even so , an acceptable polynomial fit to the psf was not always possible .",
    "we conservatively discarded 14 fields , all of which were otherwise within specifications , but whose stellar ellipticities remained correlated after correction .",
    "more sophisticated psf fitting methods have recently been suggested by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "such techniques may improve the interpolation , and thus increase the number of useable fields , but they have not been investigated here .    the shear susceptibility factor for each galaxy , @xmath30 ,",
    "was determined from the higher - order shape moments of the galaxy and the interpolated psf .",
    "the shear susceptibility is a notoriously noisy quantity ; in this implementation of ksb , we chose to fit @xmath30 with a cubic polynomial as a function of galaxy size , @xmath31 .",
    "we can then form shear estimators for each galaxy , @xmath32 .",
    "we apply a final calibration factor of @xmath33 to these shears .",
    "this calibration factor was determined by @xcite , using our shear measurement pipeline upon simulated wht images with a known input signal .",
    "each set of four dithered exposures were also used to continually monitor astrometric distortions within the telescope .",
    "as observed in @xcite , these closely follow the engineering predictions in the pfic manual of @xmath34 , @xmath35 with @xmath36 measured in arcminutes from the field centre .",
    "this affects the shear estimate of an average galaxy in a large exposure by less than @xmath37 .",
    "a galaxy in the corner of a large exposure is altered by @xmath38 .",
    "since this is no longer an _ entirely _ negligible effect in our enlarged survey , we subtract this distortion from the final shear catalogues using the shear addition and subtraction operators in @xcite .",
    "the resulting distribution of shear estimators is shown in figure  [ fig : gdist ] .",
    "both components of shear are well - fit by the normalised proabability density function @xmath39 extended , cauchy - like wings are a salient feature of the ksb method , where ellipticity measurements are formed from ratios of ( noisy ) quadrupole moments .",
    "the power spectrum of the weak lensing shear is given by @xmath40^{2 }    p\\left(\\frac{\\ell}{r } , \\chi\\right)~{{\\rm d}}\\chi , \\label{eq : shearpowerspectrum}\\ ] ] where @xmath41 is a comoving distance ; @xmath42 is the horizon distance ; @xmath43 is an angular diameter distance ; @xmath44 is the lensing weight function ; and @xmath45 is the underlying 3d distribution of mass in the universe .",
    "the two - point shear correlations functions can be expressed in terms of the power spectrum as @xmath46 ~\\ell~{{\\rm d}}\\ell   \\label{eq : c1 } \\\\",
    "c_2(\\theta ) & = & \\frac{1}{4\\pi}\\int_0^\\infty c_\\ell^\\gamma ~\\big[{\\rm j}_0(\\ell\\theta ) -{\\rm j}_4(\\ell\\theta)\\big ] ~\\ell~{{\\rm d}}\\ell ~. \\label{eq : c2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    these can be measured by averaging over galaxy pairs , as @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the separation between the galaxies and the superscript  @xmath49 denotes components of shear rotated so that @xmath50 ( @xmath51 ) in the first galaxy points along ( at 45@xmath52 from ) the vector between the pair .",
    "a third shear - shear correlation function can be formed , @xmath53 for which the parity invariance of the universe requires a zero signal .",
    "@xmath54 can therefore be used as a first test for the presence of systematic errors in our measurement .    to perform the measurement in practice ,",
    "we first measure the shear correlation functions in each field , using all galaxy pairs within various @xmath48 bins . to obtain a combined result for the entire survey",
    ", we then average the binned values for each field .",
    "we find that the measured correlation functions are quite sensitive to changes in the binning scheme .",
    "the highly non - gaussian distribution of shear estimators ( see figure  [ fig : gdist ] ) , plus additional non - gaussianity introduced by computing correlation functions , means that the inclusion in one bin of a small number of outlying fields can significantly bias measurements .",
    "both the correlation functions and the subsequent constraints on cosmological parameter constraints move within their full 1@xmath55 statistical error bars . during the averaging",
    ", we therefore introduce @xmath21-clipping in each bin to remove some outliers , and further @xmath21-clipping in @xmath54 and the star - galaxy cross - correlation functions @xmath56 to eliminate flaws with psf correction ( see  [ psfcorrect ] ) .",
    "this leaves between @xmath57 and @xmath58 fields used for each angular bin .",
    "our final choice of bin size yields representative central values .",
    "the result is shown in figure  [ fig : cth ] .",
    "we shall separately estimate the amount of instability caused by binning , and increase the error upon cosmological parameter constraints accordingly .",
    "we now use a maximum likelihood method to determine the constraints set by our observations upon the cosmological parameters @xmath62 , the total mass - density of the universe , and @xmath63 , the normalisation of the matter power spectrum at 8 @xmath6 mpc .",
    "the analysis directly uses the observed correlation functions @xmath64 and @xmath65 , proceeding as in @xcite , except that theoretical predictions for the non - linear power spectrum are calculated via the updated fitting functions of @xcite rather than those by @xcite .",
    "this has the effect of lowering our final constraint on @xmath66 by about @xmath67% .",
    "we use the fitting functions for the linear transfer function suggested by @xcite . note that , although we shall perform an @xmath68 decomposition , we fit @xmath69 and @xmath70 rather than the @xmath4 mode signal to avoid degeneracies arising from our survey s finite size .",
    "we will use the @xmath68 decomposition as an a posteriori consistency check for systematics on relevant scales ; because of such contamination , we discarded the first and last data points shown in figure  [ fig : cth ] ( see discussion in  [ systematics ] ) .",
    "the theoretical correlation functions were first calculated from equation  ( [ eq : shearpowerspectrum ] ) on a 2d grid across the @xmath62 _ vs _ @xmath63 plane .",
    "the power spectrum shape parameter was set to @xmath71 , consistent with recent observations of clustering in galaxy redshift surveys @xcite .",
    "the median redshift for source galaxies was fixed to @xmath72 for wht and @xmath73 for keck .",
    "errors on these parameters will be propagated separately into our final constraints .",
    "we then fitted the observed shear correlation functions @xmath74 to the theoretical predictions calculated at the centres of each bin @xmath75 , computing the log - likelihood function @xmath76\\big)^{-1 } ~ \\big(\\vec{d}(\\vartheta ) - \\vec{t}(\\vartheta,\\omega_m,\\sigma_8 ) \\big ) \\label{eq : chisq}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] throughout the grid .",
    "we thus explore parameter space in this plane , and minimise @xmath77 to find the best - fit cosmological model . to compute confidence contours ,",
    "we numerically integrate the likelihood function @xmath78    note that the matrix inversion in equation  ( [ eq : chisq ] ) is unstable , possibly for the same reasons as the binning instability .",
    "since @xmath79 $ ] is constitent with zero but noisy , we solve this problem in practice by forcing it to zero .",
    "the inversion is then well - behaved .",
    "our constraints on cosmlogical parameters are presented in figure  [ fig : wht_constraints ] , and the constraints from our keck survey @xcite are reproduced in the same format in figure  [ fig : keck_constraints ] . in both cases , the contours show 68.3% , 95.4% and 99.7% confidence limits , including statistical errors and non - gaussian sample variance .",
    "they reveal the well - known degeneracy between @xmath62 and @xmath63 when using only two - point statistics .",
    "a good fit to the 68.3% confidence level from our wht data is given by @xmath80 while the keck data is well - fit by @xmath81 the multiplication of the respective likelihood functions provides a constraint from a combined survey .",
    "such confidence contours are shown in figure  [ fig : combined_constraints ] , with the 68.3% confidence level well - fit by @xmath82 for @xmath83 .",
    "note that all of these constraints include only the statistical error and sample variance .",
    "we can propagate other sources of error by noting that @xmath84 where @xmath85 and @xmath86 and @xmath30 is the shear calibration factor , in a fiducial @xmath87cdm cosmological model with @xmath88 , @xmath89=0.7 , @xmath71 and @xmath90 . adding in turn to our constraint  ( [ eq : combined_con ] ) : a 6% additional binning instability , a 10% source redshift uncertainty , a 15% prior on @xmath91 , and a 5% shear calibration uncertainty , gives a final 68.3% cl constraint for the combined survey of @xmath92 where the various errors have been combined in quadrature on the second line .",
    "this result now includes all contributions to the total error budget : ( non - gaussian ) statistical noise and sample variance , covariance between different angular scales , binning instability , shear calibration error , source redshift uncertainty , and marginalisation over @xmath91 .      for historical reasons ,",
    "cosmic shear results are often expressed as the variance of the shear field in circular cells on the sky . for a top - hat cell of radius @xmath48",
    ", this measure is related to the shear correlation functions by @xmath93 ^ 2~\\ell~{{\\rm d}}\\ell \\label{eq : shvar } \\\\ ~ & \\simeq & \\frac{2}{\\theta^2 } \\int_0^\\theta \\left [ c_1(\\vartheta)+c_2(\\vartheta ) \\right]~       \\rmn{d}\\vartheta ~,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we have used a small angle approximation involving the bessel functions .",
    "note that the shear variance is more strongly correlated on different angular scales in this form than they are as correlation functions .    in practice , data is not available on all the scales necessary to perform this integration .",
    "the correlation functions have not been calculated on scales smaller than 1@xmath94 , and are contaminated by systematics on scales smaller than 2@xmath94 ( see  [ systematics ] ) .",
    "we determine the deficit in the measured values as a function of @xmath48 by extrapolating the data through these scales using the theoretical predictions given by the best - fit cosmological model determined in  [ constraints ] .",
    "this deficit ( @xmath95 at @xmath96 and @xmath97 at @xmath98 ) is then added back on to our measured data points .",
    "we present our results as the variance of shear in cells , and compare them to those from similarly deep lensing surveys in figure  [ fig : var ] .",
    "these surveys use data from 8.5 square degree , @xmath72 virmos - descart survey on the 3.6 m cfht by @xcite ; the 1.25 square degree , @xmath99 combo-17 survey on the 2.2 m la silla telescope by @xcite ; the 0.36 square degree , @xmath100 medium deep survey ( mds ) with the _ wide field and planetary camera _ on hst by @xcite ; 0.27 square degrees of random fields observed to @xmath73 in parallel - mode with the _ space telescope imaging spectrograph _ ( stis ) on hst by @xcite ; and the 0.6 square degree , @xmath73 pencil - beam survey using the 10 m keck  ii telescope by @xcite . for ease of comparison between these different surveys ,",
    "all the results have been scaled to the values that would have been obtained if their median source redshift had been @xmath72 , and using the theoretical prediction that @xmath101 .",
    "results from deeper surveys are thus shown slightly lower here than in their original papers .",
    "the validity of any cosmic shear result depends sensitively upon the treatment of systematic errors and the control of observational biases .",
    "almost all systematic effects , whether they be due to a background gradient , astrometric distortions within the telescope or imperfectly corrected psf anisotropy , act to increase the observed correlations between galaxy shapes .",
    "all the effects can mimic cosmic shear and the most important task incumbent upon any weak lensing survey is to prove that its systematics are controlled to a negligible level . as already described in  [ observations ] , the astrometric distortions in wht have been corrected for , and the basic data reduction was performed sufficiently carefully to eliminate most biases . in this section , we discuss further tests for other sources of residual systematics .",
    "the correlation functions can be recast in terms of @xmath4 ( gradient ) and @xmath5 ( curl ) modes of the shear field @xcite .",
    "gravitational lensing is expected to produce only @xmath4 modes , except for a very low level of @xmath5 modes due to lens - lens coupling along a line of sight @xcite .",
    "systematic effects are likely to affect both @xmath4- and @xmath5-modes equally .",
    "the presence of any non - zero @xmath5 mode would therefore be a useful indication of contamination from other sources .",
    "@xmath4- and @xmath5-modes correspond to patterns within an extended region on the sky .",
    "the separation can not be performed locally , but requires the shear correlation functions to be integrated over a wide range of angular scales . in practice",
    ", we can not perform these integrals exactly because our correlation function data extends only between @xmath102 and @xmath103 . in other words , a shear field measured within a finite aperture",
    "can not be uniquely split into distinct @xmath4- and @xmath5-mode components : some correction will always be necessary .",
    "we find the frequently - used decomposition into aperture mass @xmath104 and @xmath105 modes @xcite to be particularly unstable with our data .",
    "the correlation functions need to be integrated between 0 and @xmath106 , with a lot of weight placed upon their values at small angular scales .",
    "since these are changing rapidly , the end result becomes even more sensitive to the bin spacing .",
    "furthermore , our measured correlation functions are least reliable at small separations .",
    "this is likely to be the case in any real data because of small - scale effects like overlapping galaxy isophotes .",
    "since data from these small scales need to be included in all subsequent integrals , any bias there would adversely affect the aperture mass on all scales .",
    "we therefore prefer another method for @xmath68 decomposition .",
    "following @xcite , we calculate @xmath107 which contains only the @xmath4-mode signal and @xmath108 which contains only the @xmath5-mode signal .",
    "these can be calculated using data exclusively from scales larger than @xmath48 .",
    "a correction will still need to be made for absence of data on scales larger than @xmath103 , but this is in a regime where the expected signal ( and the necessary correction ) is small . as can be seen from the above equation",
    ", a function of @xmath48 ( not only a constant of integration ) must be added to @xmath109 and subtracted from @xmath110 ( c.f . * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "we calculate this function by using theoretical predictions for the best - fit cosmological model ( as determined in  [ constraints ] ) to extrapolate our data to infinity .",
    "the size of this correction is approximately one third of the size of the measured @xmath4-mode signal .",
    "the correction is 2.4@xmath111 at @xmath98 and 1.5@xmath111 at @xmath112 .",
    "an @xmath4/@xmath5 decomposition of our data is shown in figure  [ fig : eb ] . on scales",
    "@xmath113 , we find a @xmath5-mode signal consistent with zero , confirming the absence of systematics on these scales .",
    "note that because of the extra uncertainty introduced by this additive function , we have not used the derived @xmath4-mode signal to fit cosmological parameters .",
    "we instead direcly fit the measurements of @xmath69 and @xmath70 on those scales deemed free of systematic errors only ( see  [ constraints ] ) .",
    "the wht psf over long exposures can be quite anisotropic , with a mean stellar ellipticity of @xmath114 , where the error quoted is the rms stellar ellipticity within one field , averaged over all fields .",
    "application of ksb reduces this to @xmath115 .",
    "figure  [ fig : cth_stellar ] shows the full correlation functions @xmath116    where @xmath117 .",
    "application of the ksb method has successfully reduced these by four orders of magnitude . note that these are correlations of ellipticity rather than shear , and therefore exhibit a different overall normalisation that is connected to the shear susceptibility factor .",
    "the elimination of stellar anisotropy is also a slightly different problem than the challenging correction of galaxy shapes , where the interpolation of the psf is critical , and the size of the weight function @xmath31 may be different .    the correction of galaxy shapes for the psf anisotropy can be tested using cross - correlation functions between corrected shears @xmath118 from galaxies and stellar ellipticity @xmath119 before correction , @xmath120    where @xmath117 .",
    "these cross - correlation functions are shown as dashed line in the top two panels of figure  [ fig : cth ] , and is consistent with zero on all scales .",
    "note that psf correction residuals would also have appeared as @xmath5-modes in figure  [ fig : eb ] , which are in fact consistent with zero .    uncertainties still remain in the ksb method about the overall _ calibration _ of shear estimators after psf correction ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "detailed image simulations by @xcite or @xcite have been used to study these issues .",
    "@xcite found that , with our survey and telescope parameters , our implementation of ksb requires a constant calibration factor of @xmath121 to be applied to all calculated shear estimators .",
    "problems with read noise or charge transfer efficiency on the ccd , or telescope flexure and vibration , could cause the measured shear to vary as a function of position on the chip , even when averaged over many separate fields .",
    "figure  [ fig : gxy ] shows plots of shear as a function of @xmath122 and @xmath123 .",
    "figure  [ fig : gr ] shows plots of shear as a function of @xmath36 .",
    "both are consistent with zero , as desired .",
    "+     the mean components of shear across the entire ccd are @xmath124 and @xmath125 .",
    "the rms shear within the survey is @xmath126 and @xmath127 , or @xmath128 .",
    "( note that our shear measurement pipeline includes a catalogue cut at @xmath25 ) .",
    "the main , and irreducible , component of this dispersion comes from the intrinsic ellipticities of source galaxies . from other work performed with high resolution and high",
    "s / n space - based data @xcite and simulated images @xcite , we estimate a fundamental lower limit for @xmath129 around @xmath130 .",
    "our measurement of @xmath63 is at the relatively high end of the distribution of published cosmic shear results . compared to equivalently deep surveys , it is most different from that published by the combo-17 survey by @xcite , who obtain @xmath131 .",
    "we have therefore re - analysed our wht data using several variations of the combo-17 pipeline to determine the extent to which this disagreement might arise from technical differences in the pipelines .",
    "there are four main differences between the combo-17 and the wht pipelines . in the combo-17 pipeline :    * the psf was interpolated across every field via third - order polynomials in @xmath122 and @xmath123 , so the correction may be different in idividual cases .",
    "data was excluded on all scales for any fields with problematic psf correction , * a less stringent signal - to - noise cut was applied .",
    "all galaxies with @xmath132 were included , rasising the overall number density to 19.8 .",
    "every galaxy was still given the same weight when their shears were combined , * galaxy pairs were not included if the galaxies lay on different ccds .",
    "this will lower the signal - to - noise on large scales but may remove some bias if the chips are imperfectly aligned on the focal plane , * no correction was made for astrometric distortions in the telescope .",
    "this will spuriously increase the signal on large scales , where galaxies are a long way from the telescope axis , * independently - developed code was used to calculate theoretical models and to fit cosmological parameters to the data .",
    "the first two changes are relevant in the creation of a shear catalogue .",
    "differences in the psf interpolation introduce a @xmath1331% rms dispersion between shear values measured by the wht or combo-17 pipelines ( see the top - middle panel in figure  [ fig : analysis2 ] ) .",
    "this small difference can be explained by the uncertain nature of any interpolation between sparsely sampled data points .",
    "the lower - order fit in the wht method typically produces smoother , and therefore perhaps more reasonable behaviour in regions of the images that are devoid of stars .",
    "however , neither method appears to bias the shear estimators or resulting constraints on cosmological parameters .    of greater importance",
    "are the @xmath24 or @xmath132 catalogue cuts in signal - to - noise .",
    "very faint galaxies were discarded in our original analysis of wht images , and the simulated images of @xcite , because of residual correlation found between the galaxy and stellar ellipticities after correction .",
    "such correlations were not observed in the combo-17 data , so the cut was lowered .",
    "a possible explanation is the absence of ccd fringing in the combo-17 data .",
    "uncorrected fringing in wht images would alter the shapes of those galaxies at a flux level comparable to the fringing via an additive process rather than a convolution or multiplication .",
    "this would not have been corrected , so the galaxies would have simply been discarded .",
    "brighter galaxies that appear in both the wht - pipeline and combo-17 pipeline have identical estimates of @xmath30 , since both are calculated by hfindpeaks . however , these values are noisy .",
    "both pipelines regard galaxies as a population ensemble , for which it is possible to average over noise by fitting a global shear susceptibility factor .",
    "theoretically , the susceptibility factor of a galaxy shear is expected to vary as a function of its radial profile , size and ellipticity ; but not as a function of its flux .",
    "we therefore fit @xmath134 , as shown in the left - hand panels of figure  [ fig : analysis2 ] .",
    "however , it seems that real faint galaxies do indeed have higher shear susceptibilities than similarly - sized bright galaxies .",
    "as shown in the middle panels of figure  [ fig : analysis2 ] , this raises @xmath135 , and thus lowers shear esimators by a factor of @xmath136 .",
    "the skewed distribution reflects the overall size distribtuion of galaxies , and arises because this process affects small galaxies more than large ones .",
    "the reason for this variation of @xmath137 is not yet clear : it may be that the morphology distribution of faint galaxies really does contain intrinsically higher shear susceptibilities .",
    "both approaches would be valid in this case , since the fit really has found a suitable average value for the population ensemble of galaxies .",
    "a more worrying alternative would be that the noise in faint galaxies biases @xmath30 to higher values , partly because the main @xmath138 component of @xmath30 ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is defined to be strictly positive . in this case",
    ", it would instead be preferable to fit only the bright galaxies , then apply that susceptibility to faint galaxies of the same size . either way ,",
    "the results from the wht pipeline would be less affected , as the @xmath24 cut has been calibrated upon simulated images containing a known signal by @xcite .",
    "a full investigation into this technical issue is beyond the scope of this paper , and it will need further investigation in the future . other comparative studies , e.g. the shear testing program ( step , heymans et al .  in preparation ) , or the edinburgh and bonn pipelines ( heymans et al .  in preparation ) , find that the detailed way in which @xmath30 is , or is not , adequately fit may indeed explain a large part of the variation between results from different implementations of ksb . here",
    ", we shall propagate the analysis of shear catalogues from the combo-17 pipeline with both @xmath24 and @xmath132 cuts .",
    "we find similar instabilities in the production of shear - shear correlation functions with the combo-17 pipeline as we found in the wht pipeline ; results are sensitive to binning at the @xmath1397% level .",
    "measurements with the @xmath132 as shown as blue circles in figure  [ fig : cth ] , rescaled by a factor @xmath140 to allow comparison despite the increased source redshift distribtion . excluding galaxy pairs of different ccds",
    "has increased the size of error bars by up to 50% at large @xmath48 , where the number of available galaxy pairs is significantly lower , but the central values move only within their @xmath141 error bars .",
    "not correcting for the telescope s known astrometric distortion has moved the bin at largest scales by a significant amount , but this is not used for parameter fitting anyway . excluding data on all scales from fields with any residual star - galaxy correlation also has a minimal effect .",
    "each of these differences change the derived constraint on @xmath63 by less than 1% .",
    "the main difference in the two analyses is that introduced by the different cuts in signal - to - noise .",
    "the inclusion of fainter galaxies increases the median magnitude of the @xmath132 population by @xmath142 magnitudes , leading to a new median redshift of @xmath143 ( @xcite ) .",
    "the expected cosmic shear signal thus increases ( see equation  [ eq : coszgp ] )  an effect that is incorporated during the calculation of theoretical models for the fitting of cosmological parameters .",
    "reassuringly , the shear signal measured from faint galaxies is also higher .",
    "the final constraints for the combo-17 pipeline , using a cut of @xmath24 indicate :    @xmath144    including only statistical errors and , for a cut of @xmath132 with the higher assumed source redshift distribution @xmath145    the consistency of these fits , and their agreement with the results from the wht pipeline is reassuring .",
    "they tend to justify the adoption of a global shear susceptibility factor for an ensemble population of galaxies , and verify the validity of the methods for controlling many potential systematic effects in both pipelines .",
    "our survey probes a wide range of angular scales , and thus excludes small values of @xmath146 ( at 68%cl ) .",
    "the preference for large @xmath62 comes from the fit to the transfer function by @xcite .",
    "if we adopt the fit by @xcite , and assume the hubble parameter @xmath147 , we effectively apply a different prior on @xmath62 . in this case ,",
    "our data excludes @xmath148 ( at 68%cl ) , similar to the result obtained by @xcite . using the @xcite transfer function",
    "also lowers our best - fit value for @xmath63 around @xmath88 by @xmath1332% .",
    "we have measured the weak lensing shear - shear correlation functions in four square degrees of deep @xmath19-band imaging data from the william herschel telescope .",
    "our measurements constrain the amplitude of the mass power spectrum , @xmath149 , including all contributions to the total 68%cl error budget : statistical noise , sample variance , an additional estimated error due to binning instabilities from non - gaussian outliers , covariance between different angular scales , systematic measurement and detection biases , source redshift uncertainty , and marginalisation with priors over other parameters .",
    "we have examined our data for contamination by systematic effects using a variety of tests including an @xmath4-@xmath5 decomposition .",
    "these demonstrate a well - understood and modest contribution to our uncertainties from systematic errors .    using the pipeline developed for earlier wht studies , we find our measurement of the normalization of the dark matter power spectrum lies at the relatively high end of the distribution of published values .",
    "however , it is still consistent with those from equivalently deep surveys by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "our results are also consistent at the 1@xmath55 level with cmb results from the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap ) @xcite .",
    "the wide distribution of @xmath63 constraints from recent cosmic shear surveys understandably casts some aspersion upon their precision .",
    "for example , it might be argued that the dispersion largely arises from unknown or poorly - understood systematic effects . for the first time we analyze our dataset with an independent pipeline  that developed for the combo-17 data ( @xcite ) .",
    "this provides a valuable check on the extent to which dispersion in the published cosmological results , as well as our apparently high normalization , might arise from different techniques , both in constructing shear catalogues and in analysing the shear - shear correlation functions .",
    "reassuringly , we find remarkable concordance between the two pipelines for the same dataset .",
    "however , the various differences we have explored , for example in the selection thresholds , seem to be insufficient to reconcile the spread in observed @xmath63 values , suggesting that significant differences remain at some level in the actual data themselves .",
    "uncertainties in the redshift distribution of source galaxies in deep data clearly contribute .",
    "it is difficult to determine the precise redshift distribution of galaxies after excluding those smaller than a fixed apparent size .",
    "we have been conservative in this analysis and , as seen in equation  ( [ eq : con_full_errors ] ) , source redshift uncertainty is already a major component of our total error budget .",
    "the resolution of such issues will require extensive spectroscopic follow - up and more complete image simulations .",
    "such advances are essential if the potential of the next generation of cosmic shear surveys is to be fully realised .",
    "finally , we note that most recent cosmic shear results remain discrepant at the @xmath21 level with measurements derived from the abundance of x - ray selected cluster samples based on an observational rather than theoretical mass - temperature relation @xcite .",
    "these suggest @xmath150 .",
    "@xcite concluded that even extreme non - gaussianity in the mass distribution would be insufficient to explain this discrepancy , because the two techniques probe similar mass scales .",
    "further studies are therefore needed in both the cluster method , to understand the difference between the observed mass - temperature relation and that found in numerical simulations ; and in the weak lensing method , to construct more reliable and better calibrated shear measurement methods .",
    "such consistency checks will represent a crucial verification of the standard @xmath87cdm paradigm , so resolving this issue is of paramount importance .",
