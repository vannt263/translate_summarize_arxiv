    "cavity quantum electrodynamics ( cqed ) in the strong coupling regime holds great interest for experimentalists and theorists for many reasons @xcite . from an applied perspective",
    ", cqed provides precise tools for the fabrication of devices which generate useful output states of light , as exemplified by the single - photon source @xcite , the @xmath1-photon source @xcite , and the optical phase gate @xcite .",
    "conversely , cqed effects transform the high - finesse cavity into a sensitive optical detector of objects which are in the cavity field .",
    "viewed simply , standard optical microscopy is made more sensitive by having a probe beam pass through the sample multiple times , and by efficiently collecting scattered light . in the weak - coupling regime , this has allowed for nanometer- resolution measurements of the positions of a trapped ion @xcite . in the strong - coupling regime , the presence and position of single atoms can be detected with high sensitivity by monitoring the transmission @xcite , phase shift @xcite , or spatial mode @xcite of probe light sent through the cavity .    in this paper",
    ", we consider using strong - coupling cqed effects to precisely count the number of atoms trapped inside a high - finesse optical microcavity .",
    "the principle for such detection is straightforward : the presence of atoms in the cavity field splits and shifts the cavity transmission resonance .",
    "a precise @xmath1-atom counter could be used to prepare the atoms - cavity system for generation of optical fock states of large photon number @xcite , or to study ultra - cold gaseous atomic systems gases in which atom number fluctuations are important , such as number - squeezed @xcite and spin - squeezed @xcite systems .",
    "a crucial issue to address in considering such a cqed device is the role of the spatial distribution of atoms and their motion in the cavity field .",
    "an n - atom counter ( or any cqed device ) would be understood trivially if the n atoms to be counted were held at known , fixed positions in the cavity field .",
    "this is a central motivation for the integration of cqed with extremely strong traps for neutral atoms @xcite or ions @xcite .",
    "the tavis - cummings model @xcite , which applies to this case , predicts that the transmission spectrum of a cavity containing @xmath1 identically - coupled ( with strength @xmath2 ) , resonant atoms will be shifted from the empty cavity resonance by a frequency @xmath3 at low light levels .",
    "atoms in a cavity can then be counted by measuring the frequency shift of the maximum cavity transmission , and distinguishing the transmission spectrum of @xmath1 atoms from that of @xmath4 atoms in the cavity .",
    "however , to assess the potential for precise cqed - aided probing of a many - body atomic system , we consider here the possibility that atoms are confined at length scales comparable to or indeed larger than the optical wavelength .    in this paper",
    ", we characterize the influence of cavity mode spatial dependence and atomic motion on the transmission spectrum for an arbitrary number of atoms .",
    "the impact of atomic motion on cqed has been addressed theoretically in previous work @xcite , although attention has focused primarily on the simpler problem of a single atom in the cavity field .",
    "we show that when spatial dependence is included , the intrinsic limits on atom counting change significantly . the organization of this paper as follows . in",
    "we introduce the system hamiltonian , define our notation , and derive an explicit expression for the intrinsic transmission function . in",
    ", we introduce the method of moments , and use this method to calculate the shape of the intrinsic transmission function .",
    "conclusions and implications for atom counting are presented in .",
    "let us consider the hamiltonian for @xmath0 identical two - level atoms in a harmonic potential inside an optical cavity which admits a single standing wave mode of light .",
    "we consider atomic motion and the spatial variation of the cavity mode only along the cavity axis , assuming that the atoms are confined tightly with respect to the cavity mode waist in the other two dimensions .",
    "the hamiltonian for this system is @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the frequency of the cavity mode and @xmath7 is the annihilation ( creation ) operator for the cavity field .",
    "the motional hamiltonian @xmath8 is a sum over single - atom hamiltonians @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the atomic mass and @xmath11 the harmonic trap frequency .",
    "the atomic ground and excited internal states , @xmath12 and @xmath13 , respectively , are separated by energy @xmath14 .",
    "the dipole interaction with the light field @xmath15 is a sum over interactions with the dipole moment of each atom @xmath16 where @xmath2 is the vacuum - rabi splitting , which depends on the atomic dipole moment and the volume of the cavity mode . in this paper",
    "we assume the cavity mode frequency to be in exact resonance with the atomic transition frequency , @xmath17 .    since the hamiltonian ( eq .  [ equation::hfull ] )",
    "commutes with the total excitation operator , @xmath18 , the eigenspectrum of @xmath19 breaks up into manifolds labelled by their total excitation number . in this work ,",
    "we are concerned with excitation spectra of the atoms - cavity system at the limit of low light intensity , and we therefore restrict our treatment to the lowest two manifolds , with @xmath20 .    in particular , we consider the excitation spectra from the ground state ( motional and internal ) of the atoms - cavity system .",
    "this state @xmath21 is given simply as a product of motional and internal states , @xmath22 .",
    "in the uncoupled internal state notation , the @xmath23 symbol indicates there are zero photons in the cavity , and the @xmath24 symbol indicates that atom @xmath25 is in the ground state.the motional state @xmath26 is a product of single - atom ground states of the harmonic trap .",
    "let us calculate the low - light intensity transmission spectrum of the cavity .",
    "we assume that the system is pumped by a near - resonant linearly coupled driving field such that the cavity excitation hamiltonian is @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the product of the external driving electric field strength and the transmissivity of the input cavity mirror , and @xmath29 is the driving frequency . to determine the cavity transmission spectrum , we determine the excitation rate to atoms - cavity states in the @xmath30 manifold from the initial ground state .",
    "the atoms - cavity eigenstates decay either by cavity emission , with the transmitted optical power proportional to @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the cavity decay rate and @xmath33 is the intracavity photon number operator , or by other processes ( spontaneous emission , losses at the mirrors , etc . ) at the phenomenological rate constant @xmath34 . neglecting the width of the transmission spectrum caused by cavity and atomic decay ( @xmath35 )",
    ", we use fermi s golden rule to obtain the transmission spectrum @xmath36 : @xmath37 where @xmath38 . in the summation over all atoms - cavity eigenstates ,",
    "we make the simplification that only states with @xmath39 need be included since only these states are coupled to the ground state by a single excitation .",
    "to simplify notation , we make this implicit assumption throughout the remainder of this paper . we denote @xmath36 as the `` intrinsic transmission spectrum '' . in the limit of @xmath40",
    "this is composed of delta functions in frequency , while an experimentally observed transmission spectrum would be convolved by non - zero linewidths .    to proceed further",
    ", we introduce the basis states @xmath41 which span the space of _ internal states _ in the @xmath30 manifold .",
    "the state @xmath42 has one cavity photon and all atoms in their ground state .",
    "the state @xmath43 is the state in which the cavity field is empty , while a single atom ( atom @xmath25 ) is in the excited state .",
    "restricted to the @xmath30 manifold , the hamiltonian ( eq.([equation::hfull ] ) ) is written as @xmath44 , where @xmath45    to gain intuition regarding the behavior of the system , let us define the operator @xmath46 as the optical potential operator @xmath47 for which the position operators are replaced by definite positions @xmath48 . in the @xmath49 dimensional space of internal states for the @xmath30 manifold , the operator @xmath46 has two non - zero eigenvalues , @xmath50 with corresponding eigenstates @xmath51 we will refer to the @xmath52 and @xmath53 eigenstates of the potential matrix as the red and blue internal states , respectively , in reference to their energies being red- or blue - detuned from the empty cavity resonance .",
    "the remaining @xmath54 eigenvalues of the optical potential matrix are null - valued .",
    "these correspond to dark states having no overlap with the excited cavity internal state , @xmath55 , and which , therefore , can not be excited by the cavity excitation interaction @xmath56 .",
    "note that @xmath57 for all bright ( dark ) states , hence the cavity transmission spectrum is equivalent to the excitation spectrum in this treatment .",
    "we can now write the optical potential operator @xmath58 as @xmath59 we also note that the initial state @xmath60 can be written as a superposition of bright states , @xmath61    our treatment allows us to recover easily results of the tavis - cummings model @xcite in which a collection of fixed two - level atoms are coupled to a single - mode cavity with fixed , identical dipole coupling .",
    "considering @xmath62 with all atoms at the origin ( @xmath63 ) , we find a spectrum composed of delta - functions at @xmath64 ( see figure 1a ) corresponding to the two bright states @xmath65 .",
    "the clear dependence of the frequency of peak transmission on the integer number of atoms in the cavity provides the background for a basic , transmission - based atom - counting scheme .",
    "`` extrinsic '' line - broadening , due to cavity decay and other losses , will smear out these sharp transmission peaks ( see figure 1b ) , and will determine the maximum number of atoms that can be counted at the single - atom level by discriminating between the transmission spectra for @xmath1 and @xmath49 atoms .",
    "for the remainder of the paper , we focus on intrinsic limitations to atom counting , i.e.  those due to atomic localization and motion .",
    "to analyze the transmission characteristics of the atoms - cavity system in the presence of spatial dependence and atomic motion , we shall assume that the key features of the spatially - independent limit discussed above are maintained ( figure 2 ) .",
    "specifically , the transmission spectrum will still be described by two sidebands , one red - shifted and one blue - shifted from the empty cavity resonance by some frequency on the order of @xmath66 . in determining the cavity transmission @xmath36 , we may thus divide the bright excited states @xmath67 of the @xmath68 manifold into `` red '' @xmath69 and `` blue '' @xmath70 states . from these `` red '' and `` blue '' states ,",
    "we determine the transmission lineshapes @xmath71 and @xmath72 of the red and blue sidebands , respectively .",
    "the validity of this approach is made more exact by the following considerations .",
    "we have already obtained the locally - defined internal - state eigenbasis for the @xmath30 manifold as eigenstates of the operator @xmath46 , namely the states @xmath73 and the remaining @xmath54 dark states .",
    "let @xmath74 be the rotation operator which connects the uncoupled internal states @xmath75 to the eigenstates of @xmath46 at a particular set of coordinates @xmath48 ( the `` coupled internal state basis '' ) .",
    "now , consider applying this local choice of `` gauge '' everywhere in the system .",
    "since the dipole interaction operator @xmath76 is diagonalized in the coupled internal state basis , it is convenient to examine the full hamiltonian @xmath19 in this basis . defining the spatially - dependent rotation operator @xmath77",
    ", we therefore consider the transformed hamiltonian @xmath78 .    returning to , the only portion of the hamiltonian @xmath19 which does not commute with the operator @xmath79 is the kinetic energy .",
    "considering the transformation of the momentum operator for atom @xmath25 ,    @xmath80    the transformed hamiltonian @xmath81 can be expressed as @xmath82 , where    @xmath83    the operator @xmath84 describes the behavior of atoms which adiabatically follow the coupled internal state basis while moving through the spatially - varying cavity field , and @xmath85 represents the kinetic energy associated with this local gauge definition .",
    "let us treat @xmath86 as a perturbation and expand the eigenvalues and eigenstates of @xmath81 as @xmath87 we define projection operators onto the red and blue and dark internal states , @xmath88 , respectively , with the explicit forms @xmath89 these projection operators commute with @xmath84 .",
    "hence the bright eigenstates of @xmath84 , which are simultaneous eigenstates of @xmath90 and @xmath91 , can be written as @xmath92    we now assign an eigenstate , @xmath93 , of @xmath94 to the red or blue sideband if its zeroth order component @xmath95 belongs respectively to the @xmath96 or @xmath97 manifold .",
    "we can therefore define the sideband transmission spectra @xmath98 as the separate contributions of red / blue sideband states to the total transmission spectra ( see ): @xmath99 determining the exact form of @xmath98 is equivalent to solving for all the eigenvalues @xmath100 of the full hamiltonian .",
    "this is a difficult problem , particularly as the number of atoms in the cavity increases . in practice ,",
    "given the potential extrinsic line - broadening effects which may preclude the resolution of individual spectral lines , it may suffice to simply characterize main features of the transmission spectra .",
    "as we show below , general expressions for the various moments of the spectral line can be obtained readily as a perturbation expansion in @xmath86 .",
    "these moments allow one to assess the feasibility of precisely counting the number of atoms contained in the high - finesse cavity based on the transmission spectrum .    in general ,",
    "we evaluate averages @xmath101 weighted by the transmission spectral distributions @xmath98 .",
    "we make use of the straightforward identification ( for notational clarity , shown here explicitly for the case of the blue sideband ) @xmath102 where we have made use of the facts that @xmath103 and @xmath104 . to zeroth order ,",
    "becomes , @xmath105 the first - order correction to this result is given by , @xmath106    to evaluate the sums over the first - order corrections to the eigenstates , @xmath107 , we approximate the energy denominator in the first - order perturbation correction as the difference between the average energies of the red and blue sidebands , @xmath108 using this approximation , we can evaluate to the first order in perturbation , yielding @xmath109 where all expectation values are calculated over the initial state @xmath60 .",
    "we can also calculate the second moment of the distribution using the same technique . to first - order",
    ", we obtain , @xmath110    in order to evaluate these expressions , we must calculate expectation values of the form @xmath111 over the initial state @xmath60 . to simplify matters , we note that we can act with the projection operators on the initial state @xmath60 , which is equivalent to operating in the @xmath112 internal state basis .",
    "since @xmath113 is diagonal in the @xmath112 basis , and @xmath114 is the @xmath0-dimensional harmonic oscillator ground state , it is straightforward to obtain @xmath115 using the definition in , we find that the @xmath112 matrix elements of @xmath86 are given by the matrix @xmath116 where we have defined , @xmath117 combining with , we obtain to first - order in @xmath86 , @xmath118 here all expectation values are taken over the spatial state @xmath114 .",
    "although the function @xmath114 is simply the product of @xmath0 harmonic oscillator ground states , the presence of various powers of @xmath119 and @xmath120 in the above expectation values makes their analytic evaluation very difficult for arbitrary @xmath0.to determine the dependence of these integrals on atom number @xmath0 , one may expand the integrand as a taylor series in @xmath121 , leading to approximate analytic solutions for the integral as a series in @xmath122 .",
    "after some tedious algebra , we find the average positions of the red- and blue - transmission sidebands to be @xmath123 here we quantify the relative length scales of the initial harmonic trap as compared to the optical interaction potential through the parameter @xmath124 , which is related to the lamb - dicke parameter @xmath125 by @xmath126 and @xmath127 .",
    "next , we obtain an expression for the width of the red and blue sidebands by evaluating the second moment of the sidebands . expanding as a series in @xmath122",
    ", we obtain @xmath128    to gain some physical insight into these results , we consider two important regimes : the tight and loose trap regimes .",
    "these different regimes are reflected in the corresponding values of the parameter @xmath129 , which tends towards @xmath130 in the extreme tight - trap limit and to @xmath131 in the extreme loose - trap limit . in the tight regime ,",
    "the length scale of the trapping potential is much smaller than the wavelength of the light , i.e. @xmath132 .",
    "this is equivalent to the lamb - dicke regime and is applicable to current experiments for trapped ions in cavities @xcite , or for neutral atoms held in deep optical potentials @xcite . in the loose - trap regime , @xmath133 and atoms in the ground state of the harmonic oscillator potential",
    "are spread out over a distance comparable to the optical wavelength . as atoms in this regime sample",
    "broadly the cavity field , one expects , and indeed finds , a significant inhomogeneous broadening of the atoms - cavity resonance .    in the extreme loose - trap limit ( @xmath134 ) ,",
    "we find @xmath135 in the loose - trap limit , the center of the red sideband is now located at @xmath136 instead of at @xmath137 as we obtained for the spatially independent case .",
    "this difference is due to the spatial dependence of the standing mode ; the atoms no longer always feel the full strength of the potential , but are sometimes located at nodes of the potential .",
    "we also see that the sidebands have an intrinsic width of @xmath138 .",
    "this width will play an important part in limiting our ability to count the number of atoms in the cavity in the limit of a loose trap .    considering the tight - trap limit , we expand in the small parameter @xmath139 and obtain @xmath140 in the limit @xmath141",
    ", the atoms are confined to the origin and we recover the tavis - cummings result discussed earlier , wherein the transmission sidebands are delta functions at @xmath142 away from the empty cavity resonance . as the tightness of the trap decreases , the atoms begin to expericence the weaker regions of the optical potential and the centers of the sidebands move towards the origin .",
    "in addition , the sidebands develop an intrinsic variance which scales as @xmath143 .",
    "an important feature of both regimes is the intrinsic linewidth of both the red and blue sidebands ( see figure 2a ) .",
    "this linewidth has a magnitude of approximately @xmath144 when the vacuum rabi splitting is much larger than the atomic recoil energy , i.e. , @xmath145 .",
    "it is unrelated to linewidth due to cavity decay or spontaneous emission which we have not addressed here and results purely from the spatial dependence of the atom - cavity coupling .",
    "thus , it will provide an intrinsic limit to our ability to count @xmath0 atoms , regardless of the quality of the cavity that is used .",
    "our expression for the intrinsic linewidth also highlights an asymmetry between the red and blue sidebands .",
    "to first - order , increasing the atomic recoil energy _ reduces _ the linewidth of the red sideband but increases the linewidth of the blue sideband . consequently probing the red sideband of the atoms - cavity system rather than",
    "the blue sideband would facilitate counting atoms .",
    "in addition , these results suggest that the ability to tune both the atomic recoil energy @xmath146 and the coupling strength @xmath2 ( this can be done , for instance , using cqed on raman transitions ) would be beneficial .",
    "we attribute the asymmetry between the sidebands to the different effective potentials seen by states within the red and blue sidebands .",
    "a detailed analysis of this aspect will be provided in a future publication .",
    "we have found that the transmission spectrum of the cavity containing @xmath0 atoms trapped initially in the ground state of an harmonic potential will consist of distinct transmission sidebands which are red- and blue - detuned from the bare - cavity resonance , when the vacuum rabi splitting dominates the atomic recoil energy .",
    "analytic expressions for the first and second moments of the transmission sidebands were derived , and evaluated in the limits of tight and loose initial confinement .",
    "these expressions include terms containing the vacuum rabi splitting @xmath147 and the recoil energy @xmath148 .",
    "the former can be regarded as line shifts and broadenings obtained by quantifying inhomogeneous broadening under a local - density approximation , i.e.  treating the initial atomic state as a statistical distribution of infinitely massive atoms .",
    "the latter quantifies residual effects of atomic motion , in essence quantifying effects of doppler shifts and line broadenings .",
    "these results can be applied to assess the potential for precisely counting the number of atoms trapped in a high - finesse optical cavity through measuring the transmission of probe light , analogous to the work of hood _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite and mnstermann _ et al . _",
    "@xcite for single atom detection . to set the limits of our counting capability , we assume that atoms are detected through measuring the position of the mean of the red sideband . in order to reliably distinguish between @xmath0 and @xmath149 atoms in the cavity",
    ", the difference between the means for @xmath0 and @xmath150 atoms must be greater than the width of our peaks , i.e. , @xmath151 ( see figure 3 ) .",
    "let us consider that , in addition to the intrinsic broadening derived in this paper , there exists an extrinsic width @xmath152 due to the finite cavity finesse and other broadening mechanisms .",
    "evaluated in the limit @xmath153 and assuming large @xmath1 , @xmath154 we thus obtain an atom counting limit of @xmath155 where we have assumed that the intrinsic and extrinsic widths add in quadrature .",
    "this atom counting limit ranges from @xmath156 in the tight - trap limit , to @xmath157 in the loose trap limit .",
    "figure 4 shows @xmath158 as a function of @xmath159 for various values of @xmath32 . in general ,",
    "atom counting will be limited by extrinsic linewidth when @xmath160 and by intrinsic linewidth when @xmath161 .",
    "these results demonstrate that atom counting using the transmission spectrum is best accomplished within the tight - trap limit .",
    "certainly , in the loose - trap limit , atom counting will be rendered difficult as the intrinsic linewidth of the sidebands is increased . however",
    ", several questions regarding the feasibility of atom counting experiments remain .",
    "first , although atom counting by a straightforward measurement of the intensity of the transmitted light may be difficult , it is possible that the phase of the transmitted light may be less affected by motional effects @xcite .",
    "dynamical measurements ( possibly using quantum feedback techniques ) might also yield higher counting limits .",
    "second , atomic cooling techniques could be used in the loose - trap limit to cool the atoms into the wells of the optical potential , thereby decreasing the observed linewidth @xcite .",
    "finally , the state - dependence of spontaneous emission has not yet been taken into account .",
    "although the loose - trap regime leads to an intrinsic linewidth which limits atom counting , it may also suppress the extrinsic linewidth as a result of contributions from superluminescence . on the other hand , in the lamb - dicke limit ,",
    "the atoms are all highly localized , which could lead to enhanced spontaneous emission due to cooperative effects .",
    "future work will investigate alternative methods of atom counting and will explore complementary techniques of reducing the intrinsic linewidth in atom - cavity transmission spectra .",
