    "the fine balance of forces between the monopoles is broken , since the attractive yukawa interaction becomes short - ranged .",
    "consequently non - bps monopoles experience repulsion @xcite .",
    "this repulsion can be overcome by the inclusion of gravity , which allows for bound multimonopoles @xcite .    in monopole and multimonopole solutions ,",
    "the nodes of the higgs field are associated with the location of the magnetic charges .",
    "this also holds for monopole - antimonopole pair and chain solutions , where @xmath2 monopoles and antimonopoles are located symmetrically on the symmetry axis in alternating order @xcite . when the magnetic charge @xmath3 of the individual monopoles and antimonopoles becomes large ,",
    "the balance between the repulsive and attractive interactions of the monopoles and antimonopoles is shifted .",
    "for vanishing higgs potential , the structure of the solutions then changes completely , and the zeros of the higgs field form one or more rings , centered around the symmetry axis .",
    "thus vortex ring solutions arise @xcite .",
    "when the scalar coupling @xmath1 is small , the transition from maps and macs to vortex ring solutions appears for magnetic charge @xmath4 @xcite . for larger scalar coupling @xmath1 , however , bifurcations arise , where new pairs of solutions appear @xcite . thus map or mac solutions and vortex ring solutions may coexist beyond some critical value of @xmath1 . moreover new configurations with mixed node structure arise , possessing isolated nodes on the symmetry axis as well as vortex rings @xcite .",
    "the strength of the higgs self - interaction is clearly critical for the existence and the properties of these new equilibrium configurations .",
    "we here address such monopole - antimonopole systems in flat - space , reviewing and supplementing previous results @xcite .",
    "in particular , we obtain new sets of solutions associated with further bifurcations at larger values of the scalar coupling , both in the topologically trivial and the non - trivial sector .",
    "while the mass of these configurations increases with the scalar coupling , it is largely determined by their internal structure .",
    "we confirm our previous conjecture , that for large scalar coupling , mac solutions appear to be the energetically most favourable configurations .",
    "the balance of forces changes again , when gravity is coupled to ymh theory .",
    "this makes the investigation of self - gravitating maps , macs and vortex ring solutions of einstein - yang - mills - higgs ( eymh ) theory very interesting . depending on the strength of gravity , the structure of the solutions may change again @xcite",
    "also new solutions may arise , which do not possess a flat - space limit @xcite .",
    "but gravity can not become too strong , for such regular equilibrium configurations to exist , since beyond a certain gravitational coupling strength , a horizon is expected to form @xcite .    for gravitating monopoles and multimonopoles a degenerate horizon forms indeed at a critical value of the gravitational coupling @xcite . for monopole - antimonopole systems",

    "instead the flat - space branch of regular graviting monopoles bifurcates with a second branch at a maximal value of the gravitational coupling .",
    "this second branch then extends backwards and , in the limit of vanishing coupling constant @xmath5 , it becomes linked to a generalized bartnik - mckinnon ( bm ) solution of einstein - yang - mills ( eym ) theory @xcite .",
    "anticipating new phenomena @xcite , we here address the effect of gravity on monopole - antimonopole systems at large values of the scalar coupling . indeed , as @xmath1 becomes large , we observe a rich pattern of bifurcating branches of solutions arising at finite gravitational coupling strength , which encompasses all possible combinations of isolated nodes and vortex rings . moreover , certain bifurcations of the gravitating branches of solutions turn out to be precursors of the bifurcations of the flat - space solutions , and , in the limiting case of infinite @xmath1 , particular bifurcations become linked to the corresponding generalized bm solutions of eym theory .    in section",

    "\\(a ) ( b ) @xmath151 + ( c )     + ( d ) ( e )    as seen above , the bifurcations of the flat - space branches at @xmath139 and @xmath147 are reflected by bifurcations in curved space . in particular , the critical values of the gravitational coupling strength @xmath5 , where bifurcations arise for a given value of the scalar coupling strength @xmath1 , move towards smaller values of @xmath5 with decreasing @xmath1 .",
    "as the minimal critical value of @xmath5 reaches zero , the flat - space bifurcation point @xmath147 arises .",
    "it is thus obvious , that the new flat - space @xmath1-branches arising at @xmath143 , should also have precursors in curved space .",
    "these precursors indeed led to the detection of the new flat - space branches . in the following",
    "we analyze the branches of gravitating solutions , obtained with increasing scalar coupling strength @xmath1 , to clarify the emergence of the new flat - space branches .",
    "let us first consider the sets of solutions at @xmath152 and @xmath153 , exhibited in fig .",
    "[ f-9 ] . while the node structure nicely reveals the types of solutions present at the respective value of @xmath1 , and their evolution with @xmath5 , the values of the metric functions at the origin are instructive to get an overview of the sets of solutions present . for better identification",
    ", we again label the various branches of solutions a , b , c , etc .    for @xmath152",
    "there are four @xmath5-branches , just like for the smaller @xmath1 values of fig .",
    "when moving continuously along these @xmath5-branches , the node structure changes from mac , present for a and most of b , to mac plus vortex rings , shortly before the bifurcation with c. the size and the location of the nodes and the rings then evolves along c until a single ring is left in the @xmath104-plane ( together with the always present node at the origin ) .",
    "this node structure is then retained on branch d , where the solutions evolve towards the generalized bm solution as @xmath107 .",
    "as @xmath1 increases further , interestingly , another bifurcation arises , and two more @xmath5-branches appear .",
    "consequently , there is now an interval of @xmath5 with six @xmath5-branches .",
    "the branches labeled a to f are exhibited in the figure for @xmath153 . moving continuously along the branches",
    ", one again observes the structure of the solutions change from macs to macs plus vortex rings , and then to a monopole plus vortex ring(s ) .",
    "most important for understanding the emergence of the new flat - space branches is the evolution of the branches d and e with @xmath1 , with particular emphasis on the critical value of @xmath5 , where these two branches merge .",
    "we therefore consider in fig .",
    "[ f-10 ] sets of solutions with still higher values of @xmath1 .",
    "[ f-10 ]    \\(a ) ( b ) ( c )    as @xmath1 increases further , the branches d and e extend to increasingly smaller values of @xmath5 . at the critical value @xmath143 of the scalar coupling , the critical value of @xmath5 , where the branches d and e merge , then precisely reaches zero , giving rise to the bifurcation point of the new flat - space solutions .    for values of the scalar coupling beyond @xmath143 ,",
    "the set of solutions then splits into two disconnected parts .",
    "the first part emerges with branch a from the respective fundamental flat - space solution , evolves via branch b and branch c , and reaches along branch d the new upper mass flat - space solution in the limit @xmath107 .",
    "the second part emerges with branch e from the new upper mass flat - space solution , and evolves with branch f towards the limiting generalized bm solutions in the limit @xmath107 .",
    "this is demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ f-10 ] for the set of solutions with @xmath154 .",
    "_ solutions at large @xmath1 _    in the case of the @xmath47 , @xmath4 solutions we observed the appearance of new @xmath5-branches of solutions for large values of @xmath1 , exhibiting an intriguing behaviour : in the limit @xmath133 the minimal value @xmath122 , beyond which these new branches exist , decreases towards zero , while the critical solutions themselves approach the generalized bm solution as @xmath155 .",
    "we here observe an analogous pattern for the @xmath136 , @xmath4 solutions . to see this pattern arising , we reconsider the evolution of the branches a and b with @xmath1 , exhibited in fig .  [ f-9 ] and fig .",
    "[ f-10 ] . as @xmath1 increases , the branches a and b first elongate towards larger values of @xmath5 . then at a critical value of @xmath1 , a new bifurcation arises , and two additional branches appear .",
    "the minimal value @xmath122 possible for these new branches now decreases with increasing @xmath1 , analogous to the case of the respective branches of the @xmath47 , @xmath4 solutions .",
    "we now turn to the @xmath156 , @xmath4 solutions , which reside in the topologically trivial sector . as before we first address the flat - space solutions , reviewing and supplementing previous results @xcite .",
    "we exhibit in fig .",
    "[ f-11 ] the mass and the node structure of the @xmath156 , @xmath4 flat - space @xmath1-branches .",
    "the fundamental @xmath1-branch is present for arbitrary scalar coupling strength .",
    "its solutions possess two vortex rings , located symmetrically with respect to the @xmath104-plane .",
    "[ f-11 ]    \\(a ) ( b )    [ t-3 ]    at @xmath157 a first bifurcation arises , where a pair of new @xmath1-branches appears , possessing higher mass and a mixed node structure , with two outer nodes on the symmetry axis and a vortex ring in the @xmath104-plane @xcite . with increasing @xmath1",
    "the solutions on the lower mass branch retain their node structure , while the upper mass branch solutions transform first into mac solutions with four isolated nodes on the symmetry axis , and then back to the mixed node structure .    concerning the mass of these solutions ,",
    "a transition between the fundamental branch and the new lower mass branch is observed at @xmath158 , making the new lower branch solutions energetically favourable . as for the @xmath47 and @xmath136 solutions",
    ", it appears energetically advantageous for the @xmath156 solutions to exchange vortex rings for isolated nodes , when the scalar coupling is large .",
    "we therefore argued before @xcite , that a further bifurcation was likely to exist , where another pair of branches would appear , representing mac solutions with four isolated nodes on the symmetry axis .",
    "the solutions on this ( conjectured ) lower ( mass ) branch should then become the energetically most favourable configurations for large values of @xmath1 .    indeed , as seen in fig .",
    "[ f-11 ] , such a second bifurcation arises at @xmath159 , and a pair of mac solutions appears . with increasing @xmath1 the solutions on the lower mass branch retain the mac node structure , while the node structure of the upper mass branch solutions changes and forms two vortex rings .",
    "concerning the mass of the solutions we also observe the conjectured transition : beyond @xmath160 the new mac branch has the lowest mass and thus becomes the energetically favoured branch .",
    "surprisingly , at @xmath161 a third bifurcation arises and a third pair of branches appears with a new type of node structure .",
    "these solutions possess two concentric vortex rings in the @xmath104-plane .",
    "consequently their mass is considerably higher than the mass of the other configurations .",
    "but these two branches of solutions have another interesting feature . unlike the other branches of solutions , this third pair of branches exists only in a relatively small range of the scalar coupling . at the bifurcation point",
    "@xmath162 , the pair of branches merges and disappears again .",
    "since this third pair of branches of solutions appeared unexpectedly , the existence of further branches of flat - space solutions in certain ranges of the scalar coupling seems possible .      when gravity is coupled , branches of gravitating solutions arise from all of these @xmath156 , @xmath4 flat - space configurations . but as seen above , such @xmath5-branches can bifurcate many times , leading to a plethora of gravitating solutions for larger values of @xmath1 .",
    "we therefore refrain from obtaining the complete picture for these @xmath156 , @xmath4 solutions , and present only results for a few selected values of @xmath1 . in particular , we exhibit in fig .",
    "[ f-12 ] and fig .",
    "[ f-13 ] the mass , the node structure and the metric function value @xmath125 versus @xmath5 , for sets of gravitating @xmath156 , @xmath4 solutions with @xmath152 , @xmath163 and @xmath114 .     [ f-12 ]    \\(a ) ( b ) + ( c ) ( d ) + ( e ) ( f )    the first value @xmath152 is chosen in the interval @xmath164 , after the first bifurcation .",
    "so there are three flat - space solutions , each giving rise to an @xmath5-branch .",
    "the @xmath5-branch emerging from the fundamental flat - space solution connects via a second @xmath5-branch to the generalized bm solution , while the @xmath5-branches emerging from the first new pair of flat - space solutions merge with each other . by considering the evolution of the nodes on the new upper mass branch with @xmath1 and with @xmath5 , respectively ,",
    "we note again , that an increase of the scalar coupling can lead to an analogous effect as the decrease of the gravitational coupling . in both cases ,",
    "the mac node structure can change into a mixed node structure at a critical value of the coupling .",
    "[ f-13 ]    \\(a ) ( b ) + ( c ) ( d ) ( e ) + ( f ) ( g ) ( h )    the second value @xmath153 resides in the interval @xmath165 , after the second bifurcation .",
    "thus there are five flat - space solutions , each giving rise to an @xmath5-branch . as in the previous case",
    ", the @xmath5-branch emerging from the fundamental flat - space solution connects via a second @xmath5-branch to the generalized bm solution , and this feature of the fundamental branch solutions is retained , independent of @xmath1 .",
    "however , the @xmath5-branches emerging from the first new pair no longer merge with each other .",
    "instead the first new lower branch merges with the second new upper branch , and the first new upper branch merges with the second new lower branch .",
    "the reason for this can be inferred from the evolution of the @xmath5-branches with @xmath1 , since the emergence of the second new pair of flat - space solutions can be traced back to the appearance of a bifurcation on one of the @xmath5-branches of the first new pair of solutions , for a value of @xmath166 . as @xmath1 then increases ,",
    "the two additional @xmath5-branches grow in size , while their bifurcation point @xmath122 moves towards smaller values of @xmath5 , reaching @xmath146 at @xmath147 .",
    "thus beyond @xmath147 , the @xmath5-branches of the first pair of solutions are disconnected from each other and merge instead with those of the second pair .",
    "as seen in the figure , at @xmath153 the solutions on the @xmath5-branch emerging from the first lower mass solution possess a mixed node structure , those connected to the second upper mass solution have a node structure changing from mac to mixed , while the solutions on the other branches have mac structure .    the third value of @xmath1 is chosen in the interval @xmath167 , where three pairs of flat - space branches are present .",
    "their corresponding @xmath5-branches are exhibited in fig .",
    "[ f-13 ] . at this value of @xmath1",
    "a plethora of @xmath5-branches is present , caused by numerous further bifurcations .",
    "the node structures of these solutions range from macs to double vortex rings .",
    "thus one may speculate about the existence of solutions with still more complicated node structures , which might arise from new @xmath5-branches , as the scalar coupling is further increased .",
    "we have investigated static axially symmetric solutions of @xmath0 einstein - yang - mills - higgs theory , representing monopole - antimonopole pairs , chains , vortex rings , and new types of configurations with mixed node structure .",
    "such new configurations appear for larger values of the scalar coupling , when the subtle interplay between repulsive and attractive forces allows for more than one non - trivial equilibrium configuration of these systems .    in flat space , at critical values of the scalar coupling , bifurcations arise , where pairs of new branches of solutions appear , which possess a different node structure than the solutions on the fundamental branches . in particular ,",
    "new solutions appear , where vortex rings present in the fundamental solutions , are replaced by isolated nodes on the symmetry axis . for high values of @xmath1 the new solutions with monopole - antimonopole chain structure have the lowest mass .",
    "while we have studied here in detail only the monopole - antimonopole systems with @xmath168 and @xmath4 , we conjecture , that this phenomenon is not restricted to these particular systems but that it is of a more general nature , implicating an enormous richness of configuration space for high values of @xmath1 and larger @xmath2 and @xmath3 . for @xmath156 and @xmath4 ,",
    "for instance , we observed already seven distinct flat - space solutions in a certain range of the scalar coupling .",
    "the coupling to gravity leads to additional attraction between the components of these monopole - antimonopole systems , shifting the balance of forces and thus affecting the possible equilibrium configurations .",
    "whereas for small scalar coupling only two gravitating branches of solutions are associated with a flat - space solution , there is a surge of further branches when the scalar coupling becomes large .",
    "particular of these branches can be shown to give rise to new pairs of flat - space solutions .",
    "thus study of the einstein - yang - mills - higgs configuration space gives valuable insight into the configuration space of yang - mills - higgs theory .",
    "indeed , by exploiting this interrelationship , we were able to find the new flat - space solutions presented .",
    "but the einstein - yang - mills - higgs configurations are also related to einstein - yang - mills solutions .",
    "first of all , in the limit @xmath107 , one of the @xmath5-branches of a particular set of solutions , characterized by @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath1 , always connects to a generalized bartnik - mckinnon solution @xcite . but",
    "another connection arises in the limit of infinite scalar coupling . in this limit",
    "the bifurcation point @xmath122 of two of the @xmath5-branches is seen to approach @xmath146 , while the solutions at @xmath122 approach the respective generalized bartnik - mckinnon solution .",
