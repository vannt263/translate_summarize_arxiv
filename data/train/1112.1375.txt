    "since ken wilson s seminal work in the early 1970s @xcite , based also on the groundbreaking foundations laid by leo kadanoff , ben widom , michael fisher @xcite , and others in the preceding decade , the renormalization group ( rg ) has had a profound impact on modern statistical physics . not only do renormalization group methods provide a powerful tool to analytically describe and quantitatively capture both static and dynamic critical phenomena near continuous phase transitions that are governed by strong interactions , fluctuations , and correlations , they also allow us to address physical properties associated with the emerging generic scale invariance in certain entire thermodynamic phases , many non - equilibrium steady states , and in relaxation phenomena towards either equilibrium or non - equilibrium stationary states .",
    "in fact , the renormalization group presents us with a conceptual framework and mathematical language that has become ubiquitous in the theoretical description of many complex interacting many - particle systems encountered in nature .",
    "one may even argue that the fundamental rg notions of universality and relevance or irrelevance of interactions and perturbations , and the accompanying systematic coarse - graining procedures are of crucial importance for any attempt at capturing natural phenomena in terms of only a few meso- or macroscopic degrees of freedom , and thus also form the essential philosophical basis for any computational modeling , including monte carlo simulations .    in these lecture notes ,",
    "i aim to give a pedagogical introduction and concise overview of first the classic applications of renormalization group methods to equilibrium critical phenomena , and subsequently to the study of critical dynamics , both near and far away from thermal equilibrium .",
    "the second half of this article will specifically explain how the stochastic dynamics of interacting many - particle systems , mathematically described either through ( coupled ) non - linear langevin or more `` microscopic '' master equations , can be mapped onto dynamical field theory representations , and then analyzed by means of rg - improved perturbative expansions . in addition",
    ", it will be demonstrated how exploiting the general structure of the rg flow equations , fixed point conditions , and prevalent symmetries yields certain exact statements .",
    "other authors contributing to this volume will discuss additional applications of renormalization group tools to a broad variety of physical systems and problems , and also cover more recently developed efficient non - perturbative approaches .",
    "we begin with a quick review of landau s generic mean - field treatment of continuous phase transitions in thermal equilibrium , define the critical exponents that characterize thermodynamic singularities , and then venture to an even more general description of critical phenomena by means of scaling theory .",
    "next we generalize to spatially inhomogeneous configurations , investigate critical infrared singularities in the two - point correlation function , and analyze the gaussian fluctuations for the ensuing landau  ginzburg ",
    "wilson hamiltonian ( scalar euclidean @xmath0 field theory ) .",
    "this allows us to identify @xmath2 as the upper critical dimension below which fluctuations crucially impact the critical power laws . finally , we introduce wilson s momentum shell renormalization group approach , reconsider the gaussian model , discuss the general emerging structure , and at last perturbatively compute the fluctuation corrections to the critical exponents to first order in the dimensional expansion parameter @xmath4",

    "different thermodynamic phases are characterized by certain macroscopic , usually extensive state variables called order parameters ; examples are the magnetization in ferromagnetic systems , polarization in ferroelectrics , and the macroscopically occupied ground - state wave function for superfluids and superconductors .",
    "we shall henceforth set our order parameter to vanish in the high - temperature disordered phase , and to assume a finite value in the low - temperature ordered phase .",
    "landau s basic construction of a general mean - field description for phase transitions relies on an expansion of the free energy ( density ) in terms of the order parameter , naturally constrained by the symmetries of the physical system under consideration .",
    "for example , consider a scalar order parameter @xmath5 with discrete inversion or @xmath6 symmetry that in the ordered phase may take either of two degenerate values @xmath7 .",
    "we shall see that the following generic expansion ( with real coefficients ) indeed describes a _ continuous _ or second - order phase transition : @xmath8 if the temperature - dependent parameter @xmath9 changes sign at @xmath10 . for simplicity , and again in the spirit of a regular taylor expansion , we let @xmath11 , where @xmath12 denotes the _ mean - field critical temperature_. stability requires that @xmath13 ( otherwise more expansion terms need to be added ) ; near the critical point we can simply take @xmath14 to be a constant . note that the external field @xmath15 , thermodynamically conjugate to the order parameter , _ explicitly _ breaks the assumed @xmath6 symmetry @xmath16 .    minimizing the free energy with respect to @xmath5 then yields the thermodynamic ground state .",
    "thus , from @xmath17 we immediately infer the _ equation of state _ @xmath18 and the minimization or stability condition reads @xmath19 . at @xmath20 , ( [ stateq ] ) reduces to the _ critical isotherm _",
    "for @xmath22 , the _ spontaneous order parameter _ at zero external field @xmath23 vanishes ; for @xmath24 , one obtains @xmath25 , where @xmath26 note the emergence of characteristic power laws in the thermodynamic functions that describe the properties near the critical point located at @xmath20 , @xmath23 .    the continuous , but",
    "non - analytic onset of spontaneous ordering is the hallmark of a second - order phase transition , and induces additional thermodynamic singularities at the critical point : the isothermal order parameter _ susceptibility _ becomes @xmath27 , whence @xmath28 diverging as @xmath29 on both sides of the phase transition , with",
    "_ amplitude ratio _ @xmath30 . inserting ( [ spordp ] ) into the landau _ free energy _ ( [ landex ] )",
    "one finds for @xmath31 and @xmath23 @xmath32 and consequently for the _ specific heat _ @xmath33 whereas per construction @xmath34 and @xmath35 in the disordered phase .",
    "thus , landau s mean - field theory predicts a critical point _",
    "@xmath36 for the specific heat .",
    "experimentally , one indeed observes singularities in thermodynamic observables and power laws at continuous phase transitions , but often with critical exponents that differ from the above mean - field predictions .",
    "indeed , the divergence of the order parameter susceptibility ( [ opsusc ] ) indicates violent fluctuations , inconsistent with any mean - field description that entirely neglects such fluctuations and correlations .",
    "the emergence of scale - free power laws suggests the following general scaling hypothesis for the free energy , namely that its singular contributions near a critical point ( @xmath37 , @xmath23 ) can be written as a generalized _ homogeneous _ function @xmath38 where @xmath39 measures the deviation from the ( true ) critical temperature @xmath10 .",
    "thus , the free energy near criticality is not an independent function of the two intensive control parameters @xmath40 or @xmath41 and @xmath15 , but satisfies a remarkable two - parameter scaling law , with analytic _ scaling functions _",
    "respectively for @xmath43 and @xmath44 that only depend on the ratio @xmath45 , and satisfy @xmath46 in landau theory , the corresponding _ critical exponents _",
    "are @xmath47 , compare ( [ frenor ] ) , and @xmath48 , as can be inferred by combining eqs .",
    "( [ stateq ] ) and ( [ spordp ] ) .",
    "the associated _ specific heat _ singularity follows again via @xmath49 indicating a divergence if @xmath50 , and a cusp singularity for @xmath51 .",
    "similarly , one obtains the _ equation of state _ @xmath52 and therefrom the _ coexistence line _ at @xmath23 , @xmath53 @xmath54 where we have identified @xmath55 .",
    "additional _ scaling relations _ , namely identities that relate different critical exponents , can be easily derived ; for example , on the _ critical isotherm _ at @xmath56 , the @xmath41-dependence in @xmath57 on the r.h.s .",
    "of ( [ sceqst ] ) must cancel the singular prefactor , i.e. , @xmath58 , and @xmath59 finally , the isothermal _ susceptibility _ becomes @xmath60 and upon eliminating @xmath61 , one arrives at the following set of scaling relations @xmath62 clearly , as consequence of the two - parameter scaling hypothesis ( [ fschyp ] ) , there can only be _ two independent _ thermodynamic critical exponents . in the framework of landau s mean - field approximation , the set of critical exponents reads @xmath47 , @xmath63 , @xmath64 , @xmath65 , and @xmath66 ; note that these integer or rational numbers really just follow from straightforward dimensional analysis . in both computer and real experiments ,",
    "one typically measures different critical exponent values , yet these still turn out to be _",
    "universal _ in the sense that at least for short - range interaction forces they depend only on basic symmetry properties of the order parameter and the spatial dimensionality @xmath67 , but _ not _ on microscopic details such as lattice structure , nature and strength of interaction potentials , etc .",
    "indeed , the ising ferromagnetic and the liquid - gas critical points , both characterized by a scalar real order parameter , are governed by identical power laws , as is the critical behavior for planar magnets with a two - component vector order parameter and the normal- to superfluid transition in helium 4 , with a complex scalar or equivalently , a real two - component order parameter .",
    "the striking emergence of thermodynamic self - similarity in the vicinity of @xmath10 has been spectacularly demonstrated in the latter system , with the @xmath68-like shape of the specific heat curve appearing identical on milli- and micro - kelvin temperature scales .      in order to properly include the effects of fluctuations , we need to generalize the landau expansion ( [ landex ] ) to spatially varying order parameter configurations @xmath69 , which leads us to the _ coarse - grained _ effective _ landau  ginzburg  wilson ( lgw ) hamiltonian _",

    "given the strongly fluctuating and correlated nature of critical systems , standard theoretical approaches such as perturbation , cluster , or high- and low - temperature expansions typically fail to yield reliable approximations .",
    "fortunately , the renormalization group provides a powerful method to tackle interacting many - particle systems dominated by fluctuations and correlations , especially in a scale - invariant regime .",
    "the _ renormalization group program in statistical physics _ can be summarized as follows : the goal is to establish a mathematical framework that can properly capture the infrared ( ir ) singularities appearing in thermodynamic properties as well as correlation functions near a continuous phase transitions and in related situations that are _ not _ perturbatively accessible . to this end ,",
    "one exploits a fundamental new symmetry that emerges at a critical point , namely _ scale invariance _ , induced by the divergence of the dominant characteristic correlation length scale @xmath98 .",
    "approximation schemes need to carefully avoid the region where the physical ir singularities become manifest ; instead , one analyzes the theory in the ultraviolet ( uv ) regime , by means of either of various equivalent methods : in wilson s momentum shell rg approach , one integrates out short - wavelength modes ; in the field - theoretic version of the rg , one explicitly renormalizes the uv divergences .",
    "either method quantifies the weight of fluctuation contributions to certain coarse - grained or `` renormalized '' physical parameters and couplings .",
    "one then maps the resulting system back to the original theory given in terms of some `` effective '' hamiltonian , which in wilson s scheme entails a rescaling of both control parameters and field degrees of freedom .",
    "thus one obtains recursion relations for _ effective _ , now scale - dependent _ running couplings_. subject to a recursive sequence of such renormalization group transformations , these effective couplings will    * either grow , and ultimately tend to infinity : to access a scale - invariant regime , one therefore has to set these _ relevant _ parameters to zero at the outset , which defines the _ critical surface _ of the problem ; * or diminish , and eventually approach zero : these _ irrelevant _ couplings consequently do not affect the asymptotic critical scaling properties ; * certain _ marginal _ parameters may also approach an _ infrared - stable fixed point _",
    ", provided their initial value is located in the fixed point s basin of attraction : clearly , scale - invariant behavior thus emerges near an ir - stable fixed point , and the independence from a wide range of initial conditions along with the automatic disappearance of the irrelevant couplings constitute the origin of _",
    "universality_.    the central idea now is to take advantage of the emerging scale invariance at a critical fixed point as a means to infer the proper infrared scaling behavior from an at least approximative analysis of the ultraviolet regime , where , e.g. , perturbation theory is feasible . thus one may establish a solid theoretical foundation for scaling laws such as ( [ fschyp ] ) and ( [ corsch ] ) , thereby derive scaling relations , and also construct a systematic approximation scheme to compute critical exponents and even scaling functions .",
    "we shall soon see that an appropriate small parameter for a perturbational expansion is given through a _ dimensional expansion _ in terms of the deviation from the upper critical dimension @xmath4 .",
    "wilson s momentum shell renormalization group approach consists of two rg transformation steps :    1 .",
    "carry out the partition integral over all fourier components @xmath84 with wave vectors residing in the spherical momentum shell @xmath132 , where @xmath133 : this effectively _ eliminates _ the short - wavelength modes .",

    ", one also needs to rescale the fields : @xmath136 with a proper choice of @xmath137 ensuring that the rescaled residual hamiltonian assumes the original form .",
    "subsequent iterations of this procedure yield _ scale - dependent effective couplings _ , and the task will be to analyze their dependence on the scale parameter @xmath138 .",
    "notice the _ semi - group _ character of the above rg transformations : there obviously exists no unique inverse , since the elimination step ( 1 ) discards detailed information about fluctuations in the uv regime .",
    "the mechanism and efficacy of the momentum shell rg is best illuminated by first considering the exactly tractable gaussian model . introducing the short - hand notations @xmath139 and @xmath140",
