    "complex artefacts , such as a computer or a car , involve a large number of components , each of which is the result of a different production process , requiring inputs from yet other production processes .",
    "many of these processes , once internal to the same firm , are typically delocalised in a myriad of firms whose interaction is mediated through market prices @xcite . the traditional method to parse",
    "the production activity of an economy is input - output ( io ) economic analysis , which decomposes an economy s productive sector into the elementary flows between its components . in its original inception @xcite",
    "this kind of analysis simply amounted to compiling and inverting io matrices to determine the amount of goods to be produced by each sector in order for the economy to match consumer demand .",
    "modern io analysis is instead carried out in the framework of economics general equilibrium theory ( get ) , which seeks to derive macro - economic behaviour from the interaction between profit - maximizing firms and utility - maximizing consumers through market prices .",
    "attempts to derive laws for the collective behaviour of large economies are hampered by the dazzling complexity of the diverse agents involved and of their network of interactions .",
    "these difficulties are only partly circumvented by the so - called _ representative agent _",
    "approach , that effectively derives macro - economic dynamics by scaling up insights on micro - economics .",
    "this approach provides intuition on a plethora of phenomena , and is the basis of the most elaborate computational dynamic stochastic general equilibrium ( dsge ) models that are used in practice for policy analysis @xcite . yet ,",
    "its conceptual @xcite and practical @xcite shortcomings have been repeatedly pointed out .    on the one hand ,",
    "efforts in get have focused in trying to prove results for economies under the broadest possible assumptions .",
    "this program is similar to worst - case analysis in computer science , where a problem complexity is determined by estimating how hard it is to solve it in the hardest possible instance . yet , worst - case instances are often very different from typical ones , which is why this approach has lately been contrasted with typical - case complexity . likewise ,",
    "even if no result can be proved for all economies , the typical behavior of large economies may be well defined and it can be characterized with the techniques described in this paper .",
    "we believe that the get program , which was abandoned in its `` worst - case '' version , can be revamped in its `` typical - case '' version .    on the other hand , get aimed at a description of an economy which is similar to the one that newton s classical mechanics provides of a gas of particles . while being extremely detailed , it is hardly of any use for describing the behavior of a gas . yet",
    ", when classical mechanics is combined with a statistical ansatz on the distribution of micro - states , a full description of the typical properties of gases that quantitatively reproduces the laws of thermodynamics emerges .",
    "here we carry out a similar program , by deriving a description of the typical properties of an economy that enjoys many of the properties of such an approach in physics , such as the irrelevance of the micro - economic details on the collective behavior .",
    "statistical mechanics @xcite offers a general perspective @xcite on collective phenomena , which also takes the heterogeneity at the micro scale fully into account .",
    "this has shed considerable light on the physics of disordered systems , such as glasses and random alloys @xcite , but also on a wide variety of subjects , including atomic spectra of heavy ions @xcite , the stability of ecosystems @xcite , algorithmic transitions in computer science @xcite , statistics @xcite , random geometries @xcite , and portfolio instability in finance @xcite .",
    "one of the main insights provided by this approach ( and common to the aforementioned examples ) is the presence of potential sharp changes in the collective behaviour  called phase transitions  that can hardly be explained from the behaviour of individual components .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to show that an unexpected sharp phase transition can also plague large complex economies as described by get .",
    "specifically , we show that when the fraction of non - primary goods , i.e.  goods that result as an output of a production process , exceeds a critical threshold , the economy freezes in a state where all production processes collapse .",
    "this transition is reminiscent of the one discussed by donoho and tanner @xcite for random geometries in high dimensions , although it is of a slightly different nature .",
    "the occurrence of the transition only depends on the properties of the production set , and is independent of the properties of consumers . within the simplified description of an economy that get provides ,",
    "this result not only suggests a sharp separation between industrialised and underdeveloped economies , but it also implies a collapse of the economy when the number of intermediate goods grows too large .",
    "we consider a classical model @xcite of an economy composed of @xmath0 goods , where producers aim for the maximum profit and consumers adjust their demand in order to maximize their own utility .",
    "both producers and consumer maximisation problems are solved at fixed prices , that are tuned to match demand and supply for each good in competitive markets .",
    "this is a single period economy , where consumers are born with initial endowments that are then exchanged in markets and transformed into final consumption goods by competitive firms in the production sector .",
    "the emphasis is on the ability of the production sector to transform the abundant primary goods into the desired ( scarce ) final goods .",
    "a key aspect is that _ primary goods _ may be different from _ final goods _ , and some of the goods may be neither primary nor final .",
    "these are _ intermediate goods _ , that enter in the transformation process of primary goods into final ones .",
    "formally , let @xmath1 be the set of _ primary _ goods , where @xmath2 is the aggregate initial endowment of consumers for good @xmath3 ( we set @xmath4 for all @xmath5 ) .",
    "likewise , final goods @xmath6 are those the utility of consumers depends on . at fixed prices @xmath7 ,",
    "the consumer s problem is that of exchanging the initial endowments for the final consumption goods , in order to achieve utility maximization compatibly with a budget constraint .",
    "the role of the production sector is to transform initial endowments into final goods .",
    "we assume a linear activity model for the production sector , with @xmath8 transformation processes , each characterised by a vector @xmath9 .",
    "good @xmath10 is an input ( output ) if @xmath11 , the @xmath12 component of @xmath9 , is negative ( positive ) .",
    "when such an activity operates at scale @xmath13 , the amount of good @xmath10 consumed or produced by the @xmath14 activity is simply @xmath15 .",
    "so the whole production sector is defined by @xmath8 vectors @xmath16 , @xmath17 , each run at a scale @xmath18 . as customary @xcite",
    ", we also assume disposal technologies for each good with all components equal to zero , apart from component @xmath10 , @xmath19 .",
    "disposal technologies are not included in equation ( [ eq : market_clearing ] ) with the understanding that those goods with @xmath20 that are not final are disposed of , i.e.  they are wasted . ] .",
    "feasible set _ of production scales @xmath21 is given by all vectors @xmath22 such that @xmath23 as we can see from equation ( [ eq : market_clearing ] ) , @xmath24 is the sum of the initial endowments @xmath25 and of the aggregate net production of good @xmath10 , and it can be therefore interpreted as the available volume of good @xmath10 .",
    "we now have two possibilities : either good @xmath10 is final , or it is not . in the former case , by assuming strongly monotonic preferences , consumers will always consume all the available volume of good @xmath10 .",
    "hence , for final goods , @xmath24 is equal to the level of consumption of good @xmath10 . in the latter case",
    ", consumers will not consume any volume of good @xmath10 , and therefore @xmath24 is equal to the excess supply of good @xmath10 . equation ( [ eq : market_clearing ] ) implies that excess supply can not be negative for any good .    at market prices",
    "@xmath7 , the profit of each activity @xmath26 when run at scale @xmath27 is given by @xmath28 .",
    "at equilibrium , each @xmath27 is fixed within the feasible set in order to maximise profit .",
    "if a technology is unprofitable with the equilibrium prices , it is optimal to stop operating it by setting its scale to zero .",
    "hence , the number @xmath29 of activities that actually operate will be smaller than @xmath8 in general .",
    "finally , prices are set so as to match supply with consumer demand .",
    "two important generic properties of the equilibrium can be easily derived by multiplying both sides of equation ( [ eq : market_clearing ] ) by @xmath30 ( the price of commodity @xmath10 ) and by summing over all commodities .",
    "one immediately finds that consumers saturate their budget constraint , i.e.  @xmath31 ( walras law ) , and that the profit for each activity is zero .",
    "the number of active production processes is at most @xmath32 .",
    "final goods turn out to be associated with positive prices , whereas for the remaining goods , prices are set by the marginal profits @xcite .",
    "non - final goods that are in positive excess supply @xmath20 have @xmath33 and we will interpret them as _",
    "waste_. among these , goods that are also not primary ( i.e.  @xmath34 ) are intermediate goods ; those among them that have @xmath35 are fully exploited by activities , and therefore have @xmath36 .",
    "besides these generic results , little can be said about how the properties of an economy ( such as levels of consumption , scales of production , or fraction of operating activities ) depend on its structure , i.e.  on the number of goods of different types , on the number of technologies , etc .",
    "indeed the project of general equilibrium was largely abandoned for its lack of specific predictions @xcite .",
    "rather than considering a specific realisation of the framework discussed above , we discuss an ensemble of economies drawn from a given distribution .",
    "the key observation is that , when the economy becomes large enough , certain properties  called _ self - averaging _  exhibit the same collective behaviour for almost all realisations . in view of their statistical robustness , these properties are the natural candidates to be compared to the observed aggregate behaviour of complex systems , an approach that has been remarkably successful in a variety of contexts @xcite , including systems of heterogeneous interacting agents @xcite .",
    "our main results only entail properties of the production sector , so we shall avoid the intricacies of the aggregation problem on the demand side , and specialise to the simpler case of one ( representative ) consumer with a separable utility function @xmath37 where @xmath38 is a concave increasing function ( i.e.  @xmath39 and @xmath40 ) and @xmath41 encodes consumer preferences , as @xmath42 ( @xmath43 ) if the good @xmath10 is final ( non - final ) . as discussed above , the utility function only depends on the _ final _ goods @xmath44 .",
    "each good is assigned to the class @xmath45 with probability @xmath46 and , independently , to class @xmath47 with probability @xmath48 .",
    "so the number of final ( primary ) goods is @xmath49 ( @xmath50 ) .",
    "a primary good @xmath10 is part of the initial endowments , and therefore @xmath51 , whereas @xmath4 for all non - primary goods .",
    "this fully specifies the demand side of the economy .    as for the production sector , we take a maximum entropy approach in the spirit of ref .",
    "@xcite , where the only assumption we make is that the first two moments @xmath52 and @xmath53 are fixed .",
    "this implies that each activity @xmath16 is an independently drawn random vector satisfying these constraints . here",
    "@xmath54 means that , for each technology , the quantity of inputs is larger than the quantity of outputs .",
    "this ensures that no linear combination of the activities with non - negative coefficients @xmath27 can produce some output without any input .",
    "therefore , @xmath54 encodes irreversibility and its value is a measure of the inefficiency of production processes .",
    "the convexity of @xmath55 ensures that the equilibrium is unique @xcite and it satisfies the first welfare theorem .",
    "this can be rephrased by saying that , when the market clears , the optimal production scales @xmath56 deliver an optimal consumption bundle @xmath57 to consumers , given by the market clearing condition equation ( [ eq : market_clearing ] ) ) .",
    "from the perspective of the optimization problem , the aforementioned constraint @xmath31 is accounted for simply by substituting equation ( [ eq : market_clearing ] ) in equation ( [ eq : utility ] ) .",
    "this implies that ( see @xcite ) the equilibrium is given by the solution of @xmath58 all other properties of the equilibrium can be computed from the solution @xmath59 and the market clearing condition .",
    "the solution @xmath59 depends on the specific ( random ) realisation of the economy , i.e.  precisely on which goods are final and/or primary and on the specific realisation of the activities . yet ,",
    "if the economy is large enough , i.e.  for large values of @xmath8 and @xmath0 , the aformentioned self - averaging quantities attain _ typical _ values with very high probability , and independently of the specific realisation .",
    "for example , the average scale of production @xmath60 or the number of activities with @xmath61 both satisfy this property . these and other quantities can can be computed analytically using techniques borrowed from statistical physics of disordered systems @xcite in the `` thermodynamic '' limit @xmath62 , @xmath63 , with finite ratio @xmath64 .",
    "@xmath65 quantifies the number of technologies available per good , and therefore can be taken as a synthetic measure of how much an economy is developed . in a nutshell , by the law of large numbers , we expect that : @xmath66 where we have made explicit the dependence of the utility function on the activities @xmath67 , on the initial endowments @xmath68 , and on consumer preferences @xmath41 .    the problem on the r.h.s",
    ".  of equation ( [ eq : utility_average ] ) entails , at least in principle , the optimization and averaging of the utility function over an infinite number of variables . such problem can be solved analytically by resorting to the replica method @xcite borrowed from the statistical physics of disordered systems .",
    "the first step of the method consists in computing the utility function s maximum @xmath69 for a given realisation of the random variables @xmath9 , @xmath68 , and @xmath41 .",
    "since the utility function is an extensive quantity ( see equation ( [ eq : utility ] ) ) , for large @xmath8 we expect @xmath70 to be finite .",
    "therefore , its maximum can be computed by using the steepest descent method @xcite : @xmath71 where @xmath72 is called _ partition function _ in statistical physics parlance .",
    "the rationale is that , for a large system and in the limit @xmath73 , the leading contributions to the integral in equation ( [ eq : partfunc ] ) will come from the maximum of the utility function . in order to compute the right - hand side of equation ( [ eq : utility_average ] ) we need to average both sides of equation ( [ eq : max1 ] ) , and",
    "therefore we must compute the average of the logarithm of the partition function .",
    "this problem also arises in the computation of macroscopic observables of disordered systems and it can be circumvented by making use of the following identity : @xmath74 so that the problem of computing @xmath75 translates into computing @xmath76 , which can be done for integer values of @xmath77 .",
    "the final step consists in performing an analytical continuation of such quantity to real values of @xmath77 , so that the limit @xmath78 can be taken .",
    "in [ sec : sm_optm ] , we show that the approach outlined above converts the optimisation problem in equation ( [ eq : utility_average ] ) into a system of six non - linear _ saddle - point equations _ equations , whose unknowns are six _",
    "order parameters_. although results are derived in the limit @xmath79 they provide an accurate description of the behaviour of economies for finite but large @xmath8 ( see [ sec : sm_optm ] ) .",
    "effectively , this method reduces the optimisation problem in equation ( [ eq : max ] ) to an optimisation over the parameters of a single `` representative '' activity problem coupled to a single `` representative '' good .",
    "these features emerge from the statistical mechanical treatment , rather than being assumed at the outset as in the representative agent approach .",
    "we refer the reader to [ sec : sm_optm ] for a detailed derivation , which follows similar lines to those in ref .",
    "in summary , the parameters that define the ensemble of economies are _",
    "i ) _ the number of technologies available per good @xmath65 , _ ii ) _ the fraction @xmath46 of final goods , _ ii ) _ the fraction @xmath48 of primary goods , _ iii ) _ the inefficiency @xmath80 of technologies , and _",
    "iv ) _ the utility @xmath38 of consumers . for the latter , since our qualitative results do not depend significantly on the choice of @xmath81 ( as long as it is strictly increasing and convex ) , in the examples presented below we shall stick to the standard choice @xmath82 .",
    "the detailed quantitative behavior for other choices can be derived with the technique discussed in [ sec : sm_optm ] . in figure",
    "[ fig : s_phi ] we plot the average optimal scale of productions @xmath83 and the fraction @xmath84 of active producers as functions of @xmath65 and @xmath48 , for a given fraction of final goods , i.e.  for fixed preferences .",
    "we find that the parameter space is sharply divided into two regions . in the first one  that we shall call the _ industrial phase _ ",
    "we find a solution where a finite fraction @xmath85 of activities are run at positive scales @xmath86 . in the second region ",
    "the _ pre - industrial phase _  only solutions with @xmath87 ( and @xmath88 ) exist , corresponding to an economy relying exclusively on primary resources ( @xmath89 ) with no production activity .",
    "we shall discuss later the origin of this sharp transition . for",
    "the moment let us make two important observations .",
    "first , the value of @xmath48 at which the transition occurs is a decreasing function of @xmath65 , meaning that more developed economies ( with larger values of @xmath65 ) are able to sustain production with a smaller fraction of primary goods .",
    "second , the position of the _ critical line _ separating the two regions does not depend on the fraction of final goods @xmath46 , but it depends weakly on @xmath80 . upon decreasing @xmath80 , i.e.  making production processes more efficient , the critical line shifts towards lower values of @xmath48 for a fixed value of @xmath65 , expanding the parameter space region where @xmath90 .",
    "moreover , as @xmath80 decreases , @xmath83 increases and gets a sharper peak around @xmath91 ( see [ sec : sm_optm ] , figure [ eps_peak ] ) .",
    "( left panel ) and fraction @xmath84 of active producers ( right panel ) for a large economy ( with @xmath92 and @xmath93 ) as a function of the level of development of the economy @xmath65 and the fraction @xmath48 of primary goods .",
    "we distinguish three different regimes .",
    "the first one ( @xmath94 ) describes a pre - industrial phase of the economy .",
    "the second one ( @xmath90 and @xmath95 ) described a developing stage of the economy , where the introduction of a new technology has positive spillovers on already active producers ( since @xmath96 and @xmath97 ) .",
    "the third one ( @xmath90 and @xmath98 ) describes a competitive stage , where the introduction of a new technology has disruptive effects on other ones ( since @xmath99 and @xmath100).,title=\"fig : \" ]   ( left panel ) and fraction @xmath84 of active producers ( right panel ) for a large economy ( with @xmath92 and @xmath93 ) as a function of the level of development of the economy @xmath65 and the fraction @xmath48 of primary goods .",
    "we distinguish three different regimes .",
    "the first one ( @xmath94 ) describes a pre - industrial phase of the economy .",
    "the second one ( @xmath90 and @xmath95 ) described a developing stage of the economy , where the introduction of a new technology has positive spillovers on already active producers ( since @xmath96 and @xmath97 ) .",
    "the third one ( @xmath90 and @xmath98 ) describes a competitive stage , where the introduction of a new technology has disruptive effects on other ones ( since @xmath99 and @xmath100).,title=\"fig : \" ]    let us focus on the properties of the industrial phase ( @xmath90 ) . as noted in @xcite , we can distinguish two different regimes .",
    "for @xmath95 , the average scale of production increases with @xmath65 , while the fraction of active producers is roughly constant .",
    "this means that introducing a new technology ( by moving towards larger values of @xmath65 ) has no negative effect on the technologies already in place .",
    "in contrast , for @xmath98 the economy is in a highly competitive regime , in which the introduction of a new technology has a disruptive effect on the others , as both @xmath83 and @xmath84 decrease with @xmath65 .",
    "figure [ fig : wc_psi ] shows the difference between these two regimes along the complementary dimension of consumption , for a given fraction of final goods , i.e.  for fixed preferences . for @xmath101 the utility and the level @xmath102 of consumption of final goods sharply increase with @xmath65 , and , at the same time , the amount of waste @xmath103 decreases significantly . in the @xmath104 regime , instead , the utility and @xmath102 saturate to constant levels while waste @xmath103 approaches zero .",
    "interestingly , close to @xmath91 , for small @xmath80 , a non - monotonic behaviour in @xmath102 can also occur ( see figure [ fig : wc_psi ] , bottom panel , blue solid curve and [ sec : sm_cons ] for details ) .",
    "as the economy exits from the non - industrial phase , levels of consumption of final goods experience a jump , which can be either positive or negative depending on the inefficiency @xmath80 . in spite of the non - trivial behaviour of @xmath102 , the utility of consumers increases monotonically with @xmath65 , in agreement with expectations based on welfare theorems",
    "indeed , it is not only the level of consumption that matter , but also its variety .",
    "( top panel ) , fraction of efficiently processed intermediate goods @xmath105 and primary non - final goods @xmath106 ( middle panel ) , and levels of consumption @xmath102 and waste @xmath103 as a function of level of development of the economy @xmath65 .",
    "@xmath107 , @xmath108 . in the non - operational phase only primary goods are available , and therefore a fraction @xmath109 ( blue dotted line ) of all goods are consumed ,",
    "while a fraction @xmath110 are wasted ( violet dotted line ) . as",
    "production starts , @xmath102 jumps to a larger or smaller value , depending on the inefficiency @xmath80 , and afterwards @xmath111 .",
    "@xmath112 , as more and more non - final goods are used by production processes ( see middle panel ) .",
    "both @xmath105 and @xmath106 undergo a discontinuous change while crossing the transition into an operational economy , but the jump is hardly visible for @xmath106 . ]",
    "notice that , averaging @xmath24 ( see equation ( [ eq : market_clearing ] ) ) over all types of goods one finds that @xmath113 .",
    "so there is generally a negative relation between the volume of goods @xmath114 and the average scale of production @xmath83 .",
    "the economy reallocates primary goods to production in such a way as to realise the reduction in @xmath114 by exploiting the goods that are wasted in the non - industrial phase .",
    "the aforementioned peak of @xmath83 around @xmath91 , and the fact that it becomes sharper as @xmath80 decreases , are the origin of the non - monotone behaviour of @xmath102 seen in figure [ fig : wc_psi ] .    clearly , in the non - industrial phase ( @xmath115 ) the only goods in positive amounts are the primary ones , a fraction @xmath46 of which are also final goods , whereas the rest ( a fraction @xmath110 of all goods ) is waste . as industrial production sets in ,",
    "a finite fraction of these wasted primary commodities , starts being employed by technologies ( see figure [ fig : wc_psi ] , middle panel , violet lines ) . at the same time , a finite fraction of intermediate goods are also recruited in the production process ( see figure [ fig : wc_psi ] , middle panel , blue lines ) . as a consequence , markets where each of these goods are traded at positive prices emerge .",
    "as figure [ fig : wc_psi ] shows , this change is abrupt : the fraction of intermediate and primary non - final goods that are traded in the economy experiences a jump ( though the discontinuity is much sharper for intermediate goods ) .",

    "we can see that the introduction of primary goods has a beneficial impact on the economy at first , as @xmath118 and @xmath119 . however , as @xmath26 keeps increasing scales of production peak and the number of active firms saturates .",
    "a further increase @xmath26 leads to the collapse of the economy , ultimately resulting in @xmath120 and @xmath121 .",
    "the increase in @xmath103 signals that non - final goods ( including intermediate goods ) are not efficiently processed .",
    "such behaviour is consistent with figure [ fig : s_phi ] , as increasing @xmath26 at fixed @xmath116 amounts to moving along diagonals from the upper right corner to to the bottom left corner of the plane @xmath122 . ]",
    "while final and primary goods are related to intrinsic properties of the economy ( preferences and endowments ) , one could imagine a scenario in which economic expansion is driven by the proliferation of intermediate goods .",
    "these correspond , for example , to services ( e.g.  finance , legal services , etc ) or goods produced at intermediate steps in a production chain .",
    "it is instructive to analyse the behaviour of the economy as a function of the number of intermediate goods .",
    "this entails looking at the behaviour of the economy at fixed @xmath117 and @xmath116 , i.e.  the ratios of the number of primary and final goods to the number of technologies , while the fraction @xmath123 of intermediate goods , varies .",
    "figure [ fig : ig ] shows that the expansion of intermediate goods initially goes along with the expansion in the scales of production ( top panel ) and with an increase in the number of technologies used ( middle panel ) . for higher value of @xmath26 , @xmath124 reaches a peak and it decreases for larger @xmath26 .",
    "correspondingly the fraction of operating firms saturates to a constant level .",
    "as the number of intermediate goods increases even further , the economy collapses .",
    "the reason for this behaviour can be understood by observing that , in the evolution discussed above , both @xmath125 and @xmath48 decrease since the number @xmath0 of commodities increases .",
    "therefore the economy , at some point falls in the phase where no solution with @xmath126 is possible . from the welfare point of view",
    ", it is worth to point out that the average utility of consumers _ decreases _ when new goods are introduced , because new constraints are added to the scales of production .",
    "yet , the decrease in @xmath127 is almost negligible before the peak , while it becomes sharper and sharper as the transition is approached .",
    "the amount of waste exhibits a similar behaviour as the number of intermediate goods increases ( figure [ fig : ig ] bottom panel ) : for small values of @xmath26 the waste @xmath103 is almost negligible . on the contrary ,",
    "beyond the point where @xmath124 attains its maximum , the waste starts increasing considerably signalling that the economy is not able to process and take advantage of all the intermediate outputs of the production process .",
    "technologies , one primary good and two final goods ( left panel ) .",
    "the constraint @xmath128 is satisfied in the region below the dotted line .",
    "the good @xmath129 is produced in non - negative amounts for all @xmath130 , whereas the constraint @xmath131 singles out the shaded blue region .",
    "the introduction of an intermediate good ( right panel ) introduces one further constraint @xmath132 ( that is satisfied in the red shaded region ) .",
    "this may cause the collapse of production because the only point where all constraints are satisfied is the origin @xmath133 . note that primary goods introduce non - homogeneous constraints whereas non - primary goods correspond to homogeneous constraints . ]",
    "the transition between the industrial and pre - industrial phases has its origin in the constraints @xmath134 .",
    "each of these , in view of equation ( [ eq : market_clearing ] ) identifies a hyperplane cutting the @xmath8-dimensional space of technologies @xmath135 into a feasible and an unfeasible half - space .",
    "the volume @xmath136 of feasible production scales @xmath135 corresponds to the intersection between the feasible half - spaces corresponding to all goods @xmath10 and the positive orthant @xmath137 .",
    "this construction is sketched in figure [ fig : pictorial ] ( left panel ) for a simple economy with one primary good , two final goods and two technologies .",
    "notice that constraints associated with primary goods ( @xmath138 , dotted line ) are _ non - homogeneous _ , in the sense that they correspond to hyperplanes that do not intersect the origin @xmath139 .",
    "constraints associated with non - primary goods ( @xmath140 , dashed line ) are instead _ homogeneous _ and the corresponding hyperplane passes through the origin .",
    "therefore , non - homogeneous constraints can contribute to shrink the volume @xmath136 but they can not make it vanish .",
    "conversely , homogeneous constraints select `` slices '' of space , whose intersection can be limited to the origin .",
    "this is shown in figure [ fig : pictorial ] ( right panel ) for the case of the simple economy discussed above , when a new intermediate good is introduced .",
    "let us consider initially the case in which the signs of @xmath141 and @xmath142 ( and the corresponding arrows in the diagram ) are reversed with respect to figure [ fig : pictorial ] ( right panel ) . in this case",
    "the new constraint @xmath143 is redundant .",
    "in fact , the region of the plane @xmath144 compatible with all the constraints does not change after the introduction of the new intermediate good and the new equilibrium has the same production scales @xmath59 as the prevailing one . in such region @xmath143 , meaning that in the new equilibrium the new intermediate good is in excess supply and therefore it contributes to waste and has @xmath145 . in the case",
    "in which the new constraint @xmath143 is not redundant , several scenarios can present instead .",
    "the production scales @xmath59 corresponding to the prevailing equilibrium could still be compatible with the new constraint .",
    "this case is analogous to the previous one , in the sense that in new equilibrium the scales of production @xmath59 are unchanged and @xmath145 .",
    "however , if @xmath59 corresponding to the prevailing equilibrium is in the region @xmath146 , it means that ( from the perspective of the prevailing equilibrium ) the new intermediate good is in negative excess supply , i.e.  in excess demand .",
    "the old equilibrium will be displaced and @xmath59 will adjust so that @xmath147 and @xmath148 .",
    "however , if the region of the plane @xmath144 compatible with all the constraints reduces to the origin , the economy will collapse to the @xmath87 state , as in figure [ fig : pictorial ] ( right panel ) .",
    "the same intuition carries over to the case of large random economies where the volume @xmath136 of feasible production vectors @xmath137 depends on the particular realization of the random technologies @xmath9 and endowments @xmath68 . as the number of non - primary goods increases , the set @xmath136 of feasible production plans shrinks because additional homogeneous constraints are introduced .",
    "if the economy has too many non - primary goods ( or too few technologies ) the volume @xmath136 ultimately collapses to the single point @xmath139 .",
    "since the transition depends only on the properties of the production sector , the position of the critical line is independent of the fraction of final goods .",
    "the critical line can be computed analytically using the same techniques outlined in section [ sec : random ] , and applied in @xcite to solve a similar problem .",
    "we refer the interested reader to [ sec : sm_volume ] for a full derivation .",
    "the critical lines computed analytically in this way are in perfect agreement with the results in the previous subsection and with numerical simulations .",
    "one interesting aspect of the transition is the discontinuous behaviour of @xmath83 across the transition , shown in figure [ fig : s_phi ] .",
    "this is entirely consistent with the picture outlined above .",
    "indeed the utility function is monotonically increasing , so @xmath59 is expected to lie on the border of the feasible set , where the non - homogeneous constraints are satisfied as equalities .",
    "adding homogeneous constraints , the feasible set becomes a thinner and thinner slice until it reduces to the origin .",
    "yet , before that , the length of @xmath59 remains finite , as it is determined by the non - homogeneous constraints . in order to check the soundness of this picture",
    ", we sampled vectors @xmath135 within the feasibility sets of randomly generated instances of economies with large but finite @xmath8 and @xmath0 .",
    "the shape of the feasibility set can be probed by principal component analysis @xcite of the sampled vectors correlation matrix .",
    "this analysis confirms the presence of privileged directions in the space of vectors @xmath135 as the economy approaches the phase transition ( e.g.  by decreasing @xmath48 at fixed @xmath65 ) , as an exceedingly large fraction of the variability between different feasible production scales @xmath135 is explained by a single principal component ( see the [ sec : sm_geometry ] for details ) .",
    "the study of large random economies presented here has its own merit as a reference benchmark with respect to which different approaches may be compared .",
    "its value stands in the transparency of the assumptions made and in the fact that it captures genuine economic complexity .",
    "this section is devoted to comparing the behaviour of an economy , as described in the simplified general equilibrium setting described here , to the behaviour of real economies .",
    "the aim is to explore the explicatory power of complex and efficient competitive markets , as captured by the get framework , and to compare the emergent non - trivial aspects of industrial dynamics with the empirical evidence discussed in economic literature .",
    "our framework is a static one .",
    "yet , we could think of a world where , at the beginning of every period , nature endows consumers with a quantity @xmath68 of primary goods that are transformed into final goods @xmath149 by the production sector and consumed by the end of the period .",
    "what happens from one period to the next is that a new technology may be invented ( i.e.  @xmath150 ) or a new good ( i.e. @xmath151 ) may be introduced .",
    "first notice that , in this extremely simplified setting , the economy features a no - industrialisation trap , even without increasing returns to scale .",
    "expansion of the technological repertoire or of the number of primary goods is sufficient to escape the trap , without the need to invoke a `` big push '' @xcite . in our simplified world industrial revolutions",
    "would occur as sharp transitions from an economy based on natural resources to one characterised by mass production of final goods .",
    "the main determinants of this transitions are the span of the repertoire of available technologies and the number of primary goods .",
    "the transition occurs as any of the two increases .",
    "there is a vast literature on the possible determinants of the industrial revolution and on why this process occurred earlier in some countries than in others ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "our results suggest that typically a country having access to a larger basket of primary resources ( e.g.  because of its colonial empire ) would cross the transition `` first '' with respect to a country with the same repertoire of technologies but with a more limited access to primary goods .",
    "this contrasts with the _ curse of natural resources _ that observes that economies rich in natural resources tend to grow at a slower pace @xcite .",
    "this contrast is only apparent .",
    "first because the key variable we consider is the variety of the basket of primary goods , not their abundance .",
    "second , ref .",
    "@xcite finds that once indirect effects ( e.g.  corruption , trade openness , etc ) that are assumed away by the get framework , are taken into account `` resource abundance has a positive direct impact on growth '' @xcite .",
    "once an economy has entered its industrialisation phase , what type of industrial dynamics would we typically expect ?",
    "this depends on the incentives for r&d activities .",
    "we take a simplified picture of industrial dynamics , where r&d activity generates a new ( randomly drawn ) activity @xmath152 in an already existing equilibrium with a repertoire of @xmath8 existing activities ( r&d would also contribute to make existing technologies more efficient , i.e.  reducing @xmath80 .",
    "analogous considerations would apply ) .",
    "if the new technology generates a positive profit at the current prices , it will be adopted and the equilibrium will be displaced .",
    "otherwise , the technology will remain idle and the equilibrium will not change . moving from one equilibrium to the other",
    ", each existing technology shall adjust its scale of production .",
    "the adjustment will generate profits if the corresponding scale of activity @xmath27 increases , and it will generate losses if @xmath27 decreases .    in this caricature of industrial dynamics ,",
    "the regions @xmath101 and @xmath104 markedly differ in terms of the private sector s capabilities to sustain r&d activities .",
    "indeed , in the operational phase for @xmath101 new technologies are adopted with high probability ( @xmath153 ) and the fact that @xmath124 increases with @xmath65 implies that profits will be shared with the rest of the production sector .",
    "such spillovers are endogenous in this phase of the economy . on the contrary , for @xmath104",
    "a new technology will be adopted with a probability that decreases with @xmath65 . in addition",
    ", a new successful technology displaces already existing ones ( because @xmath154 ) and decreases their average profitability ( because @xmath155 ) .",
    "even though investment is not included in our model , the fact that r&d activities generate profits in the @xmath101 phase , suggests that they can be sustained in this phase . on the contrary",
    ", r&d activities can hardly be sustained when @xmath104 .",
    "it is suggestive to relate this finding to the observation that the rate of introduction of new drugs in a very technologically intensive domain as the pharmaceutical sector , has been constant for decades , in spite of increasing investments in r&d and of spectacular technological advances @xcite .",
    "a second mode of industrial change is the introduction of a new non - final good  .",
    "examples include outsourcing the production process of intermediate components to external firms with interactions mediated by market prices , emission permits for pollutants ( e.g.  carbon , nitrogen oxides ) , services and financial products . in the simplified get framework discussed here",
    ", the sole change is that a new market is created for the new good and each technology acquires a component specifying its contribution to the production or usage of that good . for a new primary good ,",
    "the endowment vector @xmath68 acquires an additional non - zero component . as discussed earlier ,",
    "if the new good is in excess supply the prevailing equilibrium is not modified , whereas if the new good is in negative excess supply   ( e.g.  carbon emissions ) then the economy s equilibrium will adjust so as to clear the market .",
    "again , the regions @xmath101 and @xmath104 markedly differ in terms of the incentives they generate to support this process . for @xmath101 adding a new good comes with a reduction of the average scale @xmath124 of operations , because the increase in the number of ( intermediate ) goods implies a reduction in @xmath65 .",
    "this implies losses for the productive sector .",
    "this suggests that _ vertically integrated _",
    "production processes should prevail in the early stages of industrialisation ( @xmath101 ) .",
    "for an economy in an advanced stage of industrialisation ( @xmath104 ) instead , the incentives for outsourcing are positive , again because @xmath156 .",
    "this is remarkably reminiscent of the account that langlois @xcite offers of industrial evolution in the last four centuries . in brief",
    ", industrial dynamics has been dominated for long by vertically integrated firms , that incorporated all stages of production .",
    "this required intensive managerial skills to buffer the volatility inherent in the intermediate stages of the production process . as demand expanded , market institutions developed in order to support stable prices .",
    "the resulting decrease in volatility made it profitable to outsource part of the production process by generating new competitive markets for intermediate goods .",
    "the same argument suggests that the introduction of carbon emission trading systems may generate profits in the industrial sectors of advanced economies ( @xmath104 ) and losses in those of developing ones ( @xmath101 ) .    from the welfare point of view",
    ", it has to be observed that while technological innovation ( i.e.  increasing @xmath8 ) always leads to an improvement in consumers welfare , the opposite is true for the introduction of new intermediate goods ( i.e.  increasing @xmath0 ) , because it imposes further constraints on the set of feasible production scales @xmath135 .",
    "these welfare changes are substantial for @xmath101 whereas they are smaller for @xmath104 .",
    "in summary , the statistical mechanics approach to the get of large random economies exhibits a rich behaviour that informs us on what competitive markets can achieve in typical cases , without invoking non - equilibrium effects , equilibrium multiplicity ( e.g.  increasing returns ) or market inefficiencies .",
    "it ultimately suggests that the statistical mechanics of large random economies possesses an explicative potential that is yet untapped .",

    "also , for a smooth enough @xmath177 , one can safely expect that , when @xmath8 becomes large , the solutions of the maximization problem do not depend on the specific realization of random variables , i.e.  one can expect @xmath178 to become a self - averaging quantity : @xmath179 the averaging operation in the above equation makes it difficult to exploit the identity in equation ( [ max1 ] ) , as computing the average of the logarithm of the partition function @xmath180 is typically a very difficult task .",

    "as pointed out in @xcite , the logarithm of the volume , and not the volume itself , is found to be self - averaging : @xmath285 in fact , the limit of a vanishingly small volume corresponds to the limit @xmath286 , where @xmath287 is the distance between different solutions ( replicas ) compatible with the constraints   defined in equation ( [ chi ] ) . however , to keep consistency with @xcite we prefer not to introduce another symbol . ] . in this limit",

    "as we vary the value of @xmath65 , we are able to draw the critical line in the plane @xmath122 .    in order to check that the analytically computed critical line is correct we proceed as follows .",
    "the volume in equation ( [ eq : volume_true ] ) is delimited by @xmath8-dimensional hyperplanes that either select an infinite region or a region of zero volume ( the origin ) in the space of scales of production . in the latter case",
    "the maximum of any linear combination of scale of productions @xmath310 will be precisely @xmath139 . finding the maximum of any such function of scale of productions compatible with linear constraints is the very definition of a linear programming problem .",

    "in the previous section we have focused on computing the couples @xmath122 where the volume vanishes .",
    "additional properties of the transition depend on _ how _ the volume shrinks to zero",
    ". in particular , such transition can be either continuous or discontinuous . in order to characterise such behaviour",
    "we need to take into account the `` full '' volume : @xmath311 defined both by homogeneous and by non - homogeneous constraints .",
    "in fact , the transition for the volume in equation ( [ eq : volume_true ] ) can only be discontinuous , since , for a given realization of the technologies , @xmath278 is either zero or infinite .",
    "unfortunately , computing @xmath136 analytically is remarkably more difficult .",
    "however , solving the corresponding linear programming instances ( for large @xmath8 ) is computationally feasible .",
    "since the solutions of a linear programming problem lie on the boundary of the polytope identified by the problem s linear constraints , the surface of the volume @xmath136 ( the feasible set ) associated with a given realization of the technologies can be probed by fixing the problem s constraints ( i.e.  the input - output matrix @xmath9 ) and optimizing multiple random linear functions ( i.e.  linear combinations of the scales of productions with random coefficients ) .",
    "repeating this procedure for multiple ( random ) choices of the constraints provides access to the average properties of the volume @xmath136 . as outlined in section [ sec : geometry ] , we build the correlation matrix of the sampled solution vectors @xmath59 and compute its largest eigenvalue @xmath312 .",
    "principal components analysis ( pca ) informs us that @xmath312 will be close to @xmath8 whenever the volume @xmath136 has an elongated shape around a dominant direction . in figure",
    "[ fig : pca ] we repeatedly compute @xmath312 for a fixed value of @xmath65 and for decreasing values of @xmath48 , i.e.  by `` approaching '' the transition by moving along what would be vertical lines in figure [ fig : vol ] .",
