    "its mere knowledge is therefore insufficient to disentangle the contributions of valence and sea quarks to the nucleon spin and for a further decomposition of the light quark sea into different flavours . a recent study of asymmetries in semi - inclusive hadron production by the smc collaboration  @xcite yielded some additional constraints on the valence and sea quark polarization .",
    "these data are however still insufficient for a simultaneous determination of all different polarized quark and antiquark distributions .",
    "one of the major future projects in the study of the nucleon spin structure is the operation of the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) at bnl with two colliding polarized proton beams at centre - of - mass energies of @xmath5  gev  @xcite .",

    "hadron centre - of - mass frame and the study of their numerical impact is the aim of the present paper . the perturbative corrections to double spin asymmetries in vector boson production are identical to the corrections in the longitudinally polarized drell  yan process and can therefore be easily obtained from  @xcite .",
    "corrections to the corresponding single spin asymmetries have been first considered in  @xcite in the context of a soft gluon resummation .",

    "this calculation is technically very similar to the calculation of the corrections to the polarized drell  yan process presented in our earlier work  @xcite , we will only point out the differences to the drell  yan calculation without presenting all details of our derivation .",
    "the numerical magnitude of the corrections will be studied in detail in section  [ sec : num ] .",
    "finally , section  [ sec : conc ] contains a summary of our results and concluding remarks .",
    "the production of vector bosons in hadronic collisions can be described accurately in the narrow - width approximation ( e.g.  @xcite ) as production of an on - shell massive vector boson by quark - antiquark annihilation .",
    "like in the case of the polarized drell  yan process , one can study the double spin asymmetry as a function of the rapidity of the vector boson in the hadronic centre - of - mass frame : @xmath10 where @xmath11 with @xmath12 and @xmath13 denoting positive and negative hadron helicities .",
    "the unpolarized cross section in the denominator of this asymmetry can be predicted using the known unpolarized parton distribution functions .",

    "the rather small discrepancy between both predictions seems to suggest that the unpolarized cross section can be predicted reliably .",
    "this is however not true in reality , since the ratio of @xmath17 and @xmath18 production cross sections in proton - proton collisions is proportional to the ratio of the unpolarized light antiquark distributions @xmath19 , which is only poorly known at present . in principle , a measurement of the unpolarized @xmath20 boson production cross sections at rhic could help to determine this ratio , as suggested in  @xcite .",
    "however , by the time rhic comes into operation , this ratio should already be well constrained from measurements of the drell  yan lepton pair production in proton - proton and proton - deuterium collisions  @xcite , thus enabling a reliable prediction of the unpolarized cross sections .",
    "the phenomenology of the double spin asymmetries is best understood at leading order ( and neglecting the ckm mixing factors @xmath21 for @xmath0 production ) , where they can be expressed  @xcite as ratios of polarized and unpolarized quark distributions @xmath22 } { \\sum_q ( v_q^2 + a_q^2 )   \\left [   q(\\xaa , m_z^2 ) \\bar q(\\xbb , m_z^2 ) +   \\bar q(\\xaa , m_z^2 )   q(\\xbb , m_z^2 ) \\right ] } \\ ; , \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the distribtions being probed at @xmath23    at rhic with @xmath15  gev , these asymmetries are thus sensitive on @xmath24 , where one expects the polarized quark distributions @xmath25 and @xmath26 to be dominated by contributions from valence quarks , which are reasonably well constrained from inclusive and semi - inclusive asymmetries in lepton ",
    "hadron scattering .",
    "the above double spin asymmetries can therefore be used as a direct probe of the polarized antiquark distributions .",
    "even the flavour structure of the polarized quark sea can be revealed , since @xmath17 production probes only @xmath27 , while @xmath18 production is particularly sensitive on @xmath28 .",
    "in addition to the above double spin asymmetries , it is also possible to define non - zero single spin asymmetries , which are induced by the parity violating couplings of the vector bosons .",
    "these asymmetries are absent in the ( parity conserving ) classical drell  yan process and their measurement requires only one of the incoming hadrons to be polarized . taking hadron  1 ( moving in the @xmath29 direction ) to be polarized and hadron  2 to be unpolarized , one can define the following single spin asymmetry @xmath30 where @xmath31 and @xmath32 as in eq.([eq : sig0 ] ) above .    at leading order ( again neglecting the ckm mixing factors for @xmath0 production )",

    "the second term in the numerator is dominant for large and negative @xmath3 , ( @xmath37 ) , since @xmath38 for large @xmath39 . in practice , this means that a measurement of these single spin asymmetries at rhic with @xmath15  gev can probe  @xcite the polarized quark distributions for @xmath40 from @xmath41 and the polarized antiquark distributions for @xmath42 from @xmath43 .",
    "a discrimination of different quark flavours is again possible from a study of @xmath17 and @xmath18 boson production .    using the double and single spin",
    "asymmetries @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 together with the unpolarized cross section @xmath47 , one can calculate the cross section @xmath48 for any combination @xmath49 of hadron helicities .",
    "it is therefore possible to express the parity violating double spin asymmetries @xmath50 and @xmath51 discussed in  @xcite by linear combinations of the asymmetries defined above .",
    "the derivation of the @xmath2 corrections to spin asymmetries in hadronic vector boson production is in many aspects similar to the calculation of the @xmath2 corrections to the @xmath3 distribution of lepton pairs produced via the drell  yan process in collisions of longitudinally polarized hadrons .",
    "we have recently presented a complete derivation  @xcite of these corrections to the longitudinally polarized drell  yan process , which was following closely the unpolarized calculation of altarelli , ellis and martinelli  @xcite .    the only lowest order contribution to the drell  yan process comes from the annihilation of a quark - antiquark pair into a virtual photon @xmath52 ( or on - shell vector boson @xmath53 ) of invariant mass @xmath54 . at next - to - leading order , one has two different contributions : the @xmath2 correction ( emission of a real or virtual gluon ) to the @xmath55 annihilation process and the quark - gluon compton scattering process @xmath56 , where @xmath57 can be a quark or antiquark .",
    "both next - to - leading order parton level cross sections contain divergences associated with collinear singularities in the initial state .",
    "these divergences can be made explicit in dimensional regularization with @xmath58 , they are process independent and can be factorized into the bare parton distribution functions . in the case of the drell  yan process at @xmath2 , all infinities can be absorbed into the bare quark distribution .",
    "the use to dimensional regularization to compute spin dependent quantities faces the problem of representing @xmath8 in @xmath59 dimensions .",
    "we use the @xmath8prescription  @xcite of t  hooft , veltman , breitenlohner and maison ( hvbm ) , which has been consistently used in the derivation of the next - to - leading order corrections to the polarized splitting functions  @xcite . in this prescription , one restricts the anticommutation property of @xmath8 to the physical four dimensions , while @xmath8 commutes in the remaining @xmath60 dimensions .",
    "the major drawback of this formalism in the @xmath7scheme is the non  conservation of the flavour non  singlet axial vector currents  @xcite due to a non  vanishing first moment of the corresponding non ",
    "singlet nlo splitting function @xmath61 . to restore the conservation of this",
    "non  singlet axial vector current , a further scheme transformation  @xcite of the results obtained in the hvbm formalism is needed  @xcite .",
    "an explicit formula for this scheme transformation , represented by a finite counterterm in the bare polarized quark distribution is given for example in  @xcite .",
    "inclusive vector boson production in unpolarized hadron collisions is up to @xmath2 in perturbation theory identical to the drell  yan process , differences due to the coupling of the @xmath1 boson to a closed quark loop  @xcite occur only at @xmath62 .",
    "it should therefore be expected that the @xmath2 corrections to the double polarized cross section @xmath63 are identical to the corrections to the @xmath3 distribution of lepton pairs produced in the polarized drell  yan process  @xcite .",
    "this identity could only be spoilt if the vector and axial - vector components of the vector boson couplings ( @xmath64 and @xmath65 ) to polarized quarks would acquire different higher order corrections due to the breaking of the anticommutation property of @xmath8 in @xmath59 dimensions .    using the hvbm representation of @xmath8",
    ", one can easily show that it is still possible to factor out the combination @xmath66 from the squared next - to - leading order matrix elements .",
    "the resulting matrix elements then coincide with the matrix elements appearing in the polarized drell  yan process up to terms which yield only contributions of @xmath67 to the final result .",
    "the @xmath2 corrections to the double polarized cross section  ( [ eq : sigll ] ) are therefore indeed identical to the corrections to the polarized drell  yan process , as navely expected .",
    "the single polarized cross section defined in ( [ eq : sigl ] ) vanishes due to parity conservation in the classical drell  yan process , which is mediated by a virtual photon .",
    "only the parity violating couplings of the @xmath0 and @xmath1 bosons to quarks induce non - zero single spin asymmetries . in the lowest order annihilation process",
    ", one has to distinguish between the annihilation of a quark from the polarized hadron with an antiquark from the unpolarized hadron ( @xmath68 ) and the annihilation of an antiquark from the polarized hadron with a quark from the unpolarized hadron ( @xmath69 ) .",
    "the @xmath70-dependent parts of these lowest order cross sections , relevant for the finite terms generated in the mass factorization , are non - identical if the hvbm prescription for @xmath8 is used : @xmath71    these normalization factors of the lowest order cross sections determine the terms that have to be factored out from all matrix elements of the @xmath2 subprocess contributions .",
    "the factor @xmath72 is required for the ( @xmath73 ) annihilation process and for the ( @xmath74 ) and @xmath75 gluon compton scattering processes , while @xmath76 must be factored out from the ( @xmath77 ) annihilation process and the ( @xmath78 ) and @xmath79 gluon compton scattering processes .",

    "the following studies of the numerical effects of the next - to - leading order corrections can therefore only illustrate the qualitative effects of these corrections without making definite , quantitative predictions for asymmetries or @xmath101-factors .",
    "the contributions of the individual subprocesses ( @xmath55annihilation at leading and next - to - leading order and quark - gluon compton scattering ) to the polarized vector boson cross sections are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : nlo ] .",
    "all polarized subprocess cross sections are obtained with the polarized gs(a ) parton distributions and are normalized to the full unpolarized cross section at next - to - leading order . in the case of the quark - gluon compton process , we distinguish moreover the case where the gluon originates from the proton moving in @xmath102 direction ( @xmath85 ) and the case where the gluon originates from the proton moving in @xmath29 direction ( @xmath103 ) .",
    "this distinction is irrelevant for @xmath104 , it becomes however important for @xmath105 , where the @xmath85 process probes @xmath106 while the @xmath103 process is sensitive on @xmath107 .",
    "the numerical impact of the individual contributions to both @xmath105 and @xmath104 is similar to the impact of these contributions in the ordinary polarized drell  yan process  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath2 correction to the @xmath108annihilation process enhances significantly the lowest order prediction while the quark ",
    "gluon compton process contributes with a sign opposite to the annihilation process . a definite prediction of the relative magnitude of these two next - to - leading order processes is however only possible for @xmath109 , as we shall explain below .",
    "the quark - gluon compton contributions to @xmath105 arise mainly from the @xmath85 configuration for @xmath110 and from the @xmath103 configuration for @xmath111 .",
    "consequently , an extraction of the large @xmath94 behaviour of the polarized quark distributions at next - to - leading order from a measurement of @xmath98 will not suffer from the uncertainty on the polarized gluon distribution , since only the known unpolarized gluon distribution contributes in the @xmath85 configuration .",
    "the numerical magnitude of the next - to - leading order corrections to @xmath98 can therefore predicted reliably : inclusion of these corrections enhances @xmath112 by about 1525% compared to its lowest order value .",
    "a quantification of the next - to - leading corrections to @xmath104 and @xmath113 requires on the other hand some knowledge on the magnitude of the polarized gluon distribution @xmath114 , which enters these cross sections in the quark - gluon compton scattering process .",
    "the same problem was already encountered in the qcd corrections to the longitudinally polarized drell  yan process  @xcite .",
    "it illustrates that any extraction of the polarized sea quark distributions at next - to - leading order requires at least some order - of - magnitude knowledge on the polarized gluon distribution .",
    "the change of physical quantities such as cross sections or asymmetries under variations of the ( unphysical ) mass factorization scale @xmath91 enables an estimate of the numerical importance of unknown higher order corrections .",
    "we quantify this uncertainty in fig .",
    "[ fig : muf ] , showing the double and single spin asymmetries in vector boson production for @xmath115 .",
    "it can be seen that the absolute value of @xmath44 changes by less than 0.005 in the central region , the variations become slightly larger in the region where @xmath3 approaches its kinematic limit , but they never exceed 0.01 .",
    "the variations in @xmath98 are even smaller and do not exceed 0.004 , they become larger in @xmath43 , where they can amount up to 0.01 .",
    "all these variations are however significantly smaller than the difference between predictions for @xmath44 and @xmath95 obtained with various parameterizations of the polarized parton distribution functions ( cf .",
    "[ fig : pdf ] ) .",
    "it must be emphasized that the relative smallness of these observed variations with the mass factorization scale arises partly due to the fact that the scale dependence of polarized and unpolarized cross sections largely compensate when taking their ratio in the asymmetry .",
    "the unpolarized vector boson production cross sections vary by about 15% between @xmath116 and @xmath117 .",
    "we have presented a complete calculation of the perturbative @xmath2 corrections to double ( @xmath44 ) and single ( @xmath95 ) spin asymmetries in massive vector boson production in collisions of longitudinally polarized hadrons .",
    "the results can be expressed in simple analytic form and are given in eqs.([eq : llmas ] ) and ( [ eq : lmas ] ) .",
    "these corrections are of particular importance for the extraction of the polarized sea quark distributions from measurements of vector boson production asymmetries at rhic .",
    "the next - to - leading order terms contributing to @xmath44 agree with the corrections to this asymmetry in the longitudinally polarized drell  yan process  @xcite , as naively expected .",
    "corrections to @xmath95 had been first considered by weber  @xcite in the context of a soft gluon resummation to single spin asymmetries .",
    "while our results for the @xmath118 , @xmath69 and @xmath78 next - to - leading order subprocesses agree ( after suitable change of factorization scheme ) with  @xcite , we obtain a different result for the @xmath119 subprocess ( polarized quark  unpolarized gluon ) .",
    "this difference could be attributed to a non - conventional normalization of the gluonic polarization sum used in  @xcite .",
    "a check of our results is given by the fact that all single polarized subprocess cross sections can be directly related to subprocess cross sections in the double polarized or unpolarized case .",
    "this behaviour should be expected due to the helicity structure of the vector boson couplings to quarks .",
    "a further check is the integration of our results over the rapidity @xmath3 , which reproduces the recent results of  @xcite while showing the same above discrepancy with  @xcite .",
    "we have demonstrated that the numerical impact of these corrections on the polarized vector boson cross sections is very similar to the impact of the next - to - leading order corrections in the unpolarized case .",
    "the corrections due to the individual subprocesses turn out to be sizable",
    ". however , a @xmath101factor between leading and next - to - leading order results can at present only be predicted for @xmath98 , which is insensitive to the yet unknown magnitude of the polarized gluon distribution .    with the knowledge of the next - to - leading order corrections , it is furthermore possible to quantify the uncertainty of the theoretical prediction due to the choice of factorization scale and hence the theoretical error on a measurement of the polarized quark distributions .",
    "we have demonstrated that the absolute value of @xmath44 varies by less than 0.005 in the central region under change of the factorization scale .",
    "the variations in @xmath95 are only sizable for @xmath111 , where they amount up to 0.01 .",
    "these variations are however significantly smaller than the difference between predictions obtained for @xmath44 and @xmath95 using different parameterizations for the polarized parton distribution functions .    to summarize , the calculations presented in this paper allowed us to investigate two possible sources of theoretical uncertainty on an extraction of the polarized quark distributions from double and single spin asymmetries in vector boson production at rhic .",
    "we found that the variation of the mass factorization scale had only minor effects on all asymmetries , thus indicating that the effect from unknown higher order terms can be expected to be small .",
    "the effects on these asymmetries from the yet unknown polarized gluon distribution were on the other hand found to be sizable for both @xmath44 and @xmath43 , while being negligible in @xmath98 .",
    "this observation illustrates that a consistent extraction of the next - to - leading order polarized sea quark distributions from vector boson production at rhic will require at least some order - of - magnitude information on the polarized gluon distribution , which is to be obtained from other processes .",
    "part of the work presented in this paper has been carried out during a visit to the fermilab theory group , whose kind hospitality is gratefully acknowledged .",
    "the author would moreover like to thank w.  vogelsang for clarifying discussions on ref .",
