    "very soon after the discovery of quantum vortices in superfluid @xmath0he by vinen @xcite , an equation of motion for a vortex was proposed by hall and vinen@xcite ; a few years later iordanskii@xcite added an extra term , to produce what is commonly known as the hall - vinen - iordanskii ( hvi ) equation of motion .",
    "the hvi equation , occasionally supplemented by an inertial mass term and by a noise fluctuation term , has been used in the last 60 years to analyze thousands of experiments in superfluids and superconductors .",
    "however it has been controversial , and for the last 20 years a strenuous debate has been going on over its validity .",
    "key questions concern the value of the vortex effective mass @xmath1 ( estimates range from zero to infinity @xcite ) and the vortex - quasiparticle coupling coefficients @xmath2 , @xmath3 . indeed , thouless et .",
    "@xcite find @xmath4 for all @xmath5 ; and scattering analyses@xcite give various different results for @xmath3 .",
    "in what follows we wish to shift the focus of this discussion . in our view",
    ", the key question is how to give a proper quantum - mechanical description of the vortex dynamics .",
    "this requires two equations of motion , one for a vortex centre of mass coordinate , and the other for the quantum fluctuations around this coordinate@xcite .",
    "a key parameter in the theory is the dimensionless ratio @xmath6 , where @xmath5 is the temperature , and @xmath7 the characteristic frequency of the vortex dynamics . in the classical limit , where @xmath8 , one actually recovers the hvi equation with added inertial and noise terms@xcite .",
    "while key questions remain ( notably the role of boundaries and normal fluid velocity @xcite , and the calculation of the effective mass@xcite ) , we believe that the main points at issue have now been settled in the classical regime .",
    "however the quantum regime remains relatively unexplored .",
    "it possesses a number of fascinating features , both theoretical and experimental .",
    "the theory gives an illuminating picture of vortex - quasiparticle interactions , classical analyses of which interactions have been subtle and controversial , because of the long - range nature of the interaction , and the difficulty of accounting for vortex recoil in the scattering .",
    "a quantum analysis immediately makes clear that a key feature of the interaction ( which is properly described as an interaction between quantum soliton and quasiparticle field excitations in @xmath9 dimensions ) , is the distortion of the quasiparticle part of the superfluid wave - function by the vortex zero mode part of this wave - function . on the experimental side",
    "the results suggest new kinds of experiment , and show that most previous experiments have been in the classical regime .",
    "in this paper we present a more intuitive picture of the quantum regime for vortices in a bose superfluid , highlighting the new features . on the theoretical side",
    "we first discuss the main features of a quantum description of the vortex , and of vortex - quasiparticle interactions .",
    "we then briefly summarize the resulting equations of motion for the vortex , and give an intuitive picture of them in real time ( as opposed to frequency space ) .",
    "almost all details of the calculations are eschewed - they are quite lengthy and will appear elsewhere@xcite .",
    "we then very briefly discuss how one might experimentally probe the quantum regime in a bose superfluid .",
    "we emphasize that this paper is about vortices in neutral bose superfluids - the problem of vortex dynamics in fermi superfluids ( both charged and neutral ) is rather different ( and is , we believe , still open ) .",
    "in a classical description , a superfluid vortex is described by its position @xmath10 ( and time derivatives of this position ) , and its dynamics are specified by an equation of motion for @xmath11 .",
    "consider now a quantum description of a superfluid with a single vortex in it .",
    "one begins with the @xmath12-particle wave - function @xmath13 , where @xmath14 and @xmath15 is a position state for the @xmath16-th particle ; or , equivalently , from the @xmath12-particle density matrix @xmath17 , where @xmath18 .",
    "the state - vector @xmath19 and the wave - function @xmath20 are assumed to satisfy bose symmetrization over permutations of the particles .",
    "we now add a vortex soliton to the system , with circulation @xmath21 , where @xmath22 , and assume that in the @xmath12-particle wave - function the vortex node is at a point @xmath23 in the plane . both the @xmath12-particle wave - function and the total density matrix @xmath24 must then depend explicitly on the parameter @xmath23 .",
    "one is now free to make a change of variables to a set @xmath25 of ` collective coordinates ' @xcite , with @xmath26 , wherein the vortex coordinate @xmath23 is isolated from the remaining @xmath27 coordinates @xmath28 .",
    "this vortex coordinate , formerly just a parameter in the wave - function , is now elevated to the status of a quantum variable associated with a state vector @xmath29 and with a ` zero mode ' , which we discuss below .",
    "all other degrees of freedom must now be properly orthogonalized , both to the zero mode and to each other @xcite .",
    "the corresponding @xmath12-particle density matrix is written @xmath30 .",
    "we also define a vortex reduced density matrix by integrating out the @xmath28 : @xmath31 in terms of which all physical quantities associated with the vortex may be defined and evaluated , provided we have sufficient information about @xmath32 .",
    "one may now , by fairly well - established manoeuvres , derive a field theory for the bose - condensed system , starting from the 1-particle reduced density matrix@xcite , denoted by @xmath33 .",
    "note that this is a different object from the vortex reduced density matrix we have defined above , and is obtained in the usual way by integrating over the coordinates of all the particles in the full density matrix except for one of them ( in a fully symmetrized way that takes account of the bose statistics ) .",
    "as is well known , one can characterize the result in terms of a quantum phase field @xmath34 and a density field @xmath35 ; they are assumed to have bose commutation relations ( and in a classical approximation , these fields are amalgamated into a macroscopic wave - function @xmath36 , and the commutation relations are dropped ) .",
    "it is common in the literature to separate out a slowly - varying texture in the two fields , and write @xmath37 where the quasiparticle variables @xmath38 and @xmath39 describe fluctuations about the texture .",
    "however once we introduce a vortex into the superfluid , we have to be a little more careful .",
    "the vortex solution breaks the global translational symmetry of the superfluid , leading to a new quantum mode associated with this broken symmetry , the so - called vortex zero mode . without specifying a particular hamiltonian @xmath40 for the superfluid",
    ", we can nevertheless say that the general equations that admit the vortex are : @xmath41 for a fixed vortex .",
    "the perturbed hamiltonian in the presence of the vortex is quadratic in the phase and density variations @xmath42 and leads to the coupled equations : @xmath43 a trivial solution to the perturbed hamiltonian can be found by taking the gradient of the original vortex equations ( [ vortex ] ) : @xmath44 where @xmath45 and @xmath46 are the texture solutions in the presence of the vortex . comparing with the equations of motion resulting from the perturbed hamiltonian",
    ", we see that the derivative of the original vortex profile satisfies them at zero frequency .",
    "the zero modes are then @xmath47 where the derivatives have been projected onto an arbitrary direction @xmath48 .",
    "the zero mode can also be found by considering a small translation of the vortex .",
    "expanding the vortex solution about a shifted position @xmath49 , we have : @xmath50 the zero mode corresponds to the prefactor of the small translation @xmath51 , ie .",
    ", the zero mode generates translations of the vortex , and indeed , the zero mode degrees of freedom are equivalent to the vortex degrees of freedom .",
    "there are two key observations that follow from this discussion .",
    "first , and rather obviously , we must now exclude the zero modes when defining the quasiparticle excitations .",
    "thus , the quasiparticle wave - functions must now be redefined so as to be orthogonal at all times to the zero modes , so that as the vortex moves , the quasiparticle wave - functions must continuously adapt to the changing position of the vortex ( indeed , they are excluded from the vortex core , and phase - shifted far from the vortex ) .",
    "second , although there will be an interaction between the vortex and the new perturbed quasiparticles , this interaction can not have any term linear in the quasiparticle variables .",
    "this is because the vortex soliton is itself a minimum action solution to the equations of motion , and so any fluctuations about this solution ( corresponding to the perturbed quasiparticles ) are at lowest order quadratic in the fluctuation variables .",
    "these points are familiar in the discussion of quantum solitons in @xmath52-d field theories@xcite ; a well - known example is the quantum sine - gordon model .",
    "however @xmath52-dimensional field theories are in many ways rather unique , and the standard belief for a long time has been that quantum soliton problems in higher dimensions were intractable .",
    "in fact this is not the case@xcite ; however , the vortex problem does bring in some interesting new features , notably :    \\(i ) unlike most of the interesting @xmath52-dimensional models , the quasiparticle spectrum is gapless here .",
    "this , along with the long - range nature of the interaction between vortices and quasiparticles , emphasizes the infra - red part of their coupling - indeed we expect to find divergences in the coupling to the unperturbed quasiparticles ( which would mean that any perturbative or diagrammatic expansion in powers of this coupling would be at best unreliable , at worst meaningless ) .",
    "however , as we shall see , the coupling to the perturbed quasiparticles is not ir divergent .",
    "\\(ii ) the perturbed quasiparticles differ from the unperturbed plane wave quasiparticles not only in the spatial form of their wave - function - they are also now chiral excitations , with angular momentum defined relative to the vortex position .",
    "the upshot of all of this is that we must now distinguish between the original quasiparticles , described by the field variables @xmath38 and @xmath53 , and the new perturbed quasiparticles .",
    "we can describe the low - energy dynamics of the system by defining these new variables as excitations about the vortex texture , ie . , we write : @xmath54 where the notation makes clear that the quasiparticles are tied to the vortex position .",
    "we can then write @xmath55 and @xmath56 in cylindrical components centered at the instantaneous position @xmath23 of the vortex , which we write as @xmath57 we see that the time and angular dependence can not be separated in the perturbed quasiparticles ; they are now chiral modes tied to the background vortex .    from this discussion",
    "one might imagine that we can now completely forget about the original plane wave quasiparticles .",
    "in an isolated system this would indeed be the case .",
    "however in experiments one can do something rather interesting , which is to inject external plane wave quasiparticles - in effect , one can irradiate the vortex with an external quasiparticle wind .",
    "these quasiparticles are _ not _ orthogonal to the vortex zero mode wave - function , and they will interact linearly with it .",
    "below , we discuss the experimental implications of this point .",
    "formally , we may now write the expansion of the superfluid action in terms of the perturbed ( tilded ) quasiparticles in the form : @xmath58 + \\tilde s_{qp}[\\{\\tilde \\phi,\\tilde \\eta\\ } ] + \\delta s_{int}^{(2)}[\\{\\tilde \\phi,\\tilde \\eta\\}]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the zero mode is accounted for in @xmath23 ; here @xmath59 $ ] is the vortex action and @xmath60 $ ] is the quasiparticle action ( both written in terms of perturbed quasiparticles ) , and @xmath61 $ ] is the interaction term ( where the superscript indicates that it is quadratic in the perturbed quasiparticle variables ) . rather than give a lengthy discussion of how @xmath62 $ ]",
    "is calculated , let us instead discuss the result , which can be portrayed in terms of the feynman diagrams for the final form of the vortex - quasiparticle interaction .",
    "one may give these results either in terms of unperturbed external quasiparticles , or in terms of the perturbed ( tilded ) quasiparticles - here we focus on the perturbed quasiparticles .",
    "the key question is of course to understand the form of the interaction between the vortex and the perturbed quasiparticles , which is incorporated in @xmath63 . to give an intuitive feel for this interaction , we sketch here the form of the effective field theory which describes it , in diagrammatic terms .    in a large system ,",
    "the quasiparticle propagators are the same for perturbed or unperturbed quasiparticles .",
    "we define the quasiparticle matrix propagator @xmath64 by @xmath65    in the same way one may define a propagator for the vortex itself , starting from @xmath66 $ ] .",
    "consider now the diagrams for the interaction between the quantum zero mode and the perturbed quasiparticles .",
    "one of the vertices involved is shown in fig . 1 .",
    "the expression for the total coupling @xmath67 , between the vortex and a pair of quasiparticles having momenta @xmath68 and @xmath69 respectively , takes the following form : @xmath70\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this interaction is zero unless @xmath71 : the moving vortex thus only couples the renormalized modes @xmath72 and @xmath73 to each other if @xmath74 , transferring angular momentum @xmath75 between them .",
    "because of the long - range vortex field , we focus on the long - wavelength regime where @xmath76 . in this regime ,",
    "only the transitions between @xmath77 and @xmath78 contribute to linear order in @xmath79 . using the anti - symmetry of @xmath80 under exchange of the initial state @xmath81 and the final state @xmath82 , viz .",
    ", @xmath83 , we can fully express the total coupling by the @xmath77 term , to get : @xmath84 valid for @xmath85 .",
    "the form of this interaction is interesting .",
    "as noted above , it is not ir divergent - this is because the perturbed quasiparticle wave - functions have adjusted to the vortex zero mode wave - function .",
    "nevertheless it is not analytic about the zero momentum point , and part of it changes sign with the angular momentum transfer @xmath86 .",
    "insofar as one believes the long - wavelength description of the bose superfluid , the result is exact in the long wavelength limit .",
    "there have of course been many attempts in the past to derive the form of the interaction between a vortex and the quasiparticles in a bose superfluid , and it is useful to compare the result ( [ lambda0 ] ) with some of the forms found in previous work on this problem . these fall mainly into 2 categories .",
    "the first set of calculations attempts to calculate a scattering amplitude for quasiparticles interacting with a classical vortex potential .",
    "such calculations automatically yield a quadratic coupling , ie . , a coupling to quasiparticle pairs .",
    "however , the long - range nature of the vortex field creates infra - red divergences in this scattering amplitude , which require careful discussion @xcite ; moreover , the potential also carries an effective aharonov - bohm flux @xcite .",
    "it actually turns out to be quite difficult to compare the details of such calculations with the results given here , mainly because ( i ) almost all of these calculations deal with the scattering of plane wave excitations off a static vortex ( with no recoil ) ; and ( ii ) the vortex itself is not treated quantum - mechanically .",
    "a second class of calculations employs a hamiltonian of form @xcite @xmath87 ^ 2 \\\\ & + \\sum_{\\bf k }   \\left(c_{\\bf k } { \\bf q}_{\\bf k } \\cdot { \\bf r } + { 1 \\over 2 m_{\\bf k } } \\big [ { \\bf p}_{\\bf k}^2   + m_{\\bf k } \\omega_{\\bf k}^2 { \\bf q}_{\\bf k}^2 \\big ] \\right ) \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the vector potential @xmath88 yields a ` field ' @xmath89 , which is responsible for the magnus force .",
    "this hamiltonian takes the feynman - vernon / caldeira - leggett form @xcite , with couplings @xmath90 to quasiparticle coordinates @xmath91 ( having conjugate momenta @xmath92 ) , which are linear in the @xmath93 .",
    "as noted above , such a linear interaction _ does _ exist between the vortex and the _ unperturbed _ plane - wave quasiparticles . however , as we have already explained , no linear interaction to correctly orthogonalized quasiparticles can exist .",
    "note however that this does not stop us from writing down a hamiltonian like ( [ tan94 ] ) containing a linear interaction between the vortex and _ pairs _ of quasiparticles ",
    "such forms have been employed in other cases involving quasiparticle - soliton interactions .",
    "however the interaction now depends on the momenta of both quasiparticles , and is usually strongly temperature - dependent ; considerable care is needed to evaluate it . in our view the only reliable way to carry out such a manoeuvre is to first derive the interaction between the vortex and the true orthogonalized quasiparticles , as above , and then from this derive the form of the interaction to a bath of effective oscillators .",
    "as shown in ref.@xcite , one can in fact carry though a fully non - perturbative derivation of the time dynamics of the vortex system , by dealing directly with the superfluid action , which incorporates the infra - red convergent interaction ( [ lambda0 ] ) between the vortex and the perturbed quasiparticle field . by then integrating out the quasiparticles one finds an equation of motion for the vortex reduced density matrix",
    "- there is no need to deal directly with the vortex scattering problem at all .",
    "as we noted at the beginning of this paper , the classical description of a vortex involves an equation of motion for the classical coordinate @xmath10 .",
    "as we will discuss below , the correct classical vortex equation of motion turns out to be @xmath94 where @xmath95 is some driving force , @xmath1 is the vortex mass , @xmath96 is the magnus force for a vortex with circulation @xmath97 , and the quasiparticle force @xmath98 is @xmath99 in which the longitudinal drag @xmath2 and the transverse term @xmath3 depend strongly on the temperature @xmath5 .",
    "the classic discussion of iordanskii yields @xmath100    finally , @xmath101 is a the classical limit of a fluctuational noise term @xmath102 , whose behaviour is defined by its correlator @xmath103 . in the classical regime",
    "this correlator takes the form @xmath104 ie .",
    ", it is entirely longitudinal , and displays markovian white noise - we discuss the temperature dependence below .",
    "( [ eom1 ] ) is in fact the original hvi equation@xcite , but with an added inertial mass term and a longitudinal noise term .",
    "it is actually a local ( in spacetime ) equation , ie .",
    ", it can be written in the form @xmath105 , where @xmath106 is a local differential operator acting at time @xmath107 , involving forces and an inertial term which act on @xmath10 at time @xmath107 only .",
    "there is actually no reason why the classical dynamics need to be local - one could easily have , eg . , memory terms in the dissipation of form @xmath108 , and quite generally one could have an equation of form @xmath109 , where @xmath110 is now some integrodifferential operator function of @xmath107 and @xmath111 .",
    "however , we will see that the correlation times in the classical regime are very short , and a local equation is a very accurate approximation to the truth .",
    "consider now the quantum dynamics .",
    "this has to be written in terms of an equation of motion for the reduced density matrix @xmath112 .",
    "now the range of possible different forms for an equation of motion for @xmath113 is very large .",
    "quite generally we might expect the equation to be non - local in the variables @xmath114 , and @xmath107 .",
    "moreover , there is no reason to assume that we will be able to write the equation of motion in terms of simple forces , which are a classical notion of limited applicability in quantum mechanics .",
    "it is then refreshing to find that the actual time dynamics of @xmath115 do assume a fairly simple form , even in the quantum regime .",
    "for a discussion of experiments it is convenient to transform the equations of motion to the frequency domain , and we discuss this in the next section .",
    "but it is also of interest to look at them in the real time domain , which we do here .",
    "the derivation of these results is described in refs .",
    "the key assumption is that we can make a born - oppenheimer expansion , assuming the vortex velocity is small compared to the sound velocity in the superfluid . for the derivation of the forces acting on the vortex this expansion",
    "is perfectly well behaved , and we can thus have confidence in the results . however the derivation of the effective mass is more subtle and the born - oppenheimer expansion misses the radiation reaction terms ( which also exist classically ) . consequently the born - oppenheimer expansion yields a hydrodynamic mass @xmath116 for the vortex , without frequency - dependent corrections or higher time derivatives ( eg . , terms proportional to @xmath117 ) .    the results for the vortex dynamics can be written in terms of an equation of motion for @xmath115 , but it is more illuminating here to give them in terms of the dynamics of the arguments of @xmath118 .",
    "we define the sum and difference variables @xmath119 and @xmath120 , so that @xmath10 denotes a centre of mass coordinate for the vortex , and @xmath121 a quantum fluctuation coordinate about the centre of mass coordinate .",
    "one can then write the results in terms of equations of motion for these 2 variables .",
    "for the centre of mass coordinate one gets an equation which can be written as @xmath122 = { \\bf f}_{fluc}(t)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath123 is again the magnus force , and where the new quasiparticle force @xmath124 is now a non - local _ functional _ of the velocity of the vortex , relative to the normal velocity .",
    "the equation for @xmath125 takes a somewhat similar form : @xmath126 = 0\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where however now @xmath127 ( ie .",
    ", this force is like the magnus force acting on the relative velocity @xmath128 , except it now acts simply on the ` fluctuation velocity ' @xmath129 ) ; where the quasiparticle term does not depend on @xmath130 ; and where there is no noise fluctuation term .",
    "we do not have space here to look in detail at the equation of motion for @xmath131 , but it is physically illuminating to look at the new quasiparticle force term @xmath132 $ ] . to make the connection with the hvi classical force @xmath133 appearing in ( [ f - qp ] ) ,",
    "let us write its quantum generalization as @xmath134 \\;=\\ ; { \\bf f}_\\|^r[\\dot{\\bf { r}}_v - { \\bf v}_n ] \\;+\\ ; { \\bf f}_\\perp^r[\\dot{\\bf { r}}_v - { \\bf v}_n]\\ ] ] where the idea is to separate out the two terms that in the classical limit lead to the drag force and the iordanski force .",
    "let us consider in detail the parallel term @xmath135 $ ] .",
    "it is a functional of the prior vortex velocity parallel to the normal fluid ; in fact it takes the microsopic form : @xmath136 =   { \\hbar\\over l_z } & \\sum_{m\\sigma kq } ( \\lambda_{kq}^{\\sigma m})^2 \\omega_{kq}(n_k - n_q ) \\\\ & \\times \\int_{t_1}^t ds \\ ; ( \\dot{\\bf { r}}_v(s)- { \\bm v}_n ) \\cos [ \\omega_{kq}(t - s)]\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we have assumed a quasi-2d film of thickness @xmath137 , and the frequency @xmath138 is just the difference in energies between the two quasiparticles that interact with the vortex , ie . , @xmath139 , where we expect that in the long wavelength regime , @xmath140 , where @xmath141 is the sound velocity . we see that this force has just assumed a simple memory form , and that its instantaneous value and direction depend on the previous path traced out by the vortex ( more precisely , the component of that the vortex velocity along that path that was parallel to @xmath130 ) .",
    "however there is no requirement for @xmath142 $ ] at a given time @xmath107 to be parallel to @xmath130 at the position @xmath143 of the vortex - if @xmath130 varies with time or with position , then this will not in general be the case .",
    "consider now the behaviour in time of this memory term. to do this , let us imagine a vortex following a straight line trajectory - we can then write the parallel force as @xmath144 \\rightarrow \\int^t ds d_{\\parallel}(t - s;t)({\\bf v}_n - \\dot{\\bf { r}}_v(s))\\ ] ] where the function @xmath145 is a non - local ( in time ) generalization of the hvi coefficient @xmath2 .",
    "now this function turns out to depend only on the product @xmath146 ( so that its fourier transform , as advertised , depends only on the ratio @xmath6 ) . in fig .",
    "2 we show its behaviour as a function of renormalized time .    ,",
    "shown as a function of the dimensionless variable @xmath147 : the coefficient decays roughly as @xmath148 at long times , a relatively slow decay coming from the linear low - frequency behaviour of @xmath149 .",
    "the arrow at the origin denotes a local in time ( @xmath150-function ) damping contribution .",
    ", scaledwidth=50.0% ]    suppose we write the longitudinal damping function @xmath145 as a sum of a local @xmath150-function contribution and a retarded term .",
    "now at first glance , one s intuitive expectation is that the @xmath150-function term will simply be equal to the classical @xmath2 contribution .",
    "but this is not correct .",
    "actually one finds that @xmath151 where the long - time tail term @xmath152 behaves roughly as @xmath153 .",
    "thus as one tends to low temperatures or short times , such that @xmath154 , one is left with the quantum contribution to the longitudinal damping - but this is 16 times smaller than @xmath2 , and moreover , it behaves like a local term !",
    "it is only at high temperatures or long times , when one integrates over all of @xmath155 , that the full contribution to the classical coefficient @xmath2 is recovered .    from these remarks",
    "one sees that the crossover between the classical hvi equations and the fully quantum regime is going to be an interesting one .",
    "we have no space here to outline the behaviour of the other terms in the equation of motion - suffice it to say that both the transverse quasiparticle force and the fluctuation force have non - local memory terms ( although the correction to the iordanskii force in the transverse term turns out to be very small ) .",
    "remarkably , once we have made the full crossover to the quantum regime ( ie .",
    ", where @xmath156 , or where @xmath157 , one actually ends up again with a local equation of motion for the vortex , this time coming only from the @xmath150-function terms in the various memory kernels .",
    "this equation is @xmath158 where the quasiparticle force @xmath159 is given by @xmath160 and where the fluctuation correlator is again markovian and entirely longitudinal : @xmath161",
    "thus the equation of motion in the extreme quantum regime has exactly the same form as the classical hvi equation , but with quite different coefficients ( except for the magnus and iordanskii terms , which have exactly the same coefficients ) .    to summarize - one",
    "finds that the actual equations of motion for a quantum vortex are rather complicated except in the extreme classical regime , where they reduce to the standard hvi equation , and in the extreme quantum regime , where they reduce to equation ( [ eom1b - q ] ) .",
    "the intervening crossover regime is expected to show quite different behaviour from either of the two limiting cases .",
    "condensed matter systems are populated by 3 different kinds of quantum excitation - extended quasiparticle modes , localized modes such as spins , or defects , and quantum solitons .",
    "it is obviously of great importance to understand how these different excitations interact , and the debate over the nature of vortex - quasiparticle interactions has assumed a central importance in the theory of superfluids over the years . in this work and in refs.@xcite",
    "we present what we think is a solution to this problem , obtained by extending the theory beyond the purely classical regime .",
    "we should however note some of the limitations of this work .",
    "first , it is only valid in the long wavelength limit - we ignore higher - order interquasiparticle interactions , and excitations like rotons in superfluid @xmath162he ( in @xmath0he this confines us to @xmath163 ) .",
    "it also means that we can not deal with the crossover in the vortex flow field between the near regions where normal fluid viscosity can be neglected , and the far region where the viscosity controls the flow .",
    "thouless et al.@xcite , have shown there are subtle problems involved in this crossover , and in fact we believe that the question of the total circulating normal fluid to be found around a vortex still needs to be settled .",
    "a second limitation is that the assumption of a slow vortex and a born - oppenheimer expansion , so that we can not capture all terms contributing to the inertial forces on a vortex .",
    "finally , the work here describes vortices in a bose superfluid - vortices in fermi superfluids have to be dealt with separately .",
    "it is nevertheless interesting to speculate on how one might address the quantum regime in experiments .",
    "one needs high frequency vortex motion .",
    "the obvious candidates for experiments then include ( i ) vortex tunneling experiments ( where the bounce frequency is very high ) ( ii ) experiments on the dynamics of single vortices in 2-dimensional pancake cold bec gases - this problem is discussed by cox and stamp@xcite ; and ( iii ) very low-@xmath5 experiments on turbulence ( where vortex motions can be extremely rapid ) .",
    "the detailed theory of such experiments remains an interesting challenge .",
    "this work was supported by funding from nserc , from pitp , and from cifar .",
    "the work benefited greatly from discussions at various times with ( and encouragement from ) david thouless ; we also thank bill unruh and gordon semenoff for useful comments ."
