    "the nemo-3detector was operated from february 2003 to january 2011 in the modane underground laboratory ( lsm ) to search for neutrinoless double-@xmath0 ( 0@xmath1 ) decay  @xcite .",
    "this nuclear decay violates lepton number conservation by two units .",
    "its observation would therefore provide direct evidence for physics beyond the standard model ( bsm ) .",
    "the experimental signature of @xmath10 decay involves the detection of two simultaneously emitted electrons from a common decay vertex .",
    "the 0@xmath1decay half - life for an isotope with mass number @xmath11 and atomic number @xmath12 is @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the axial vector coupling constant , @xmath15 is a phase space factor that depends on @xmath12 and the nuclear transition energy @xmath16 , @xmath17 is the nuclear matrix element ( nme ) , and @xmath18 represents a parameter of the underlying bsm physics model . both @xmath15 and @xmath17 depend on the assumed bsm decay mechanism .    under the assumption that a massive majorana neutrino mediates the decay ,",
    "the half - life depends on the effective majorana neutrino mass @xmath8such that @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the electron mass  @xcite .",
    "therefore , if 0@xmath1decay occurs through this mechanism then the measurement of the decay rate could provide information about the absolute mass scale of the neutrino . a number of other bsm mechanisms could also mediate a 0@xmath1decay , such as right handed currents ( rhc ) or majoron decay modes  @xcite .",
    "data from the nemo-3experiment is used to search for evidence of each of these decay mechanisms .",
    "the isotope @xmath2nd is a particularly interesting candidate to search for 0@xmath1decay due to its large @xmath12 and its @xmath16 value of  @xcite , which together yield the largest @xmath15 of all 0@xmath1decay candidates .",
    "since @xmath16 is large , the region of interest in the distribution of the total energy of both electrons lies above most natural radioactive backgrounds for 0@xmath1decay modes that do not involve the emission of additional neutral particles .",
    "nevertheless , the rate of 0@xmath1decay is expected to be very low , and a complete understanding of all potential background rates is critical .",
    "this includes the two - neutrino double-@xmath0 decay process ( 2@xmath1 ) , as well as other sources of natural radioactivity both in and around the active detector volume that may produce signal - like events .",
    "two previous experiments have directly measured the 2@xmath1decay half - life of @xmath2nd to the ground state of @xmath2sm .",
    "a group at the university of california , irvine conducted the first measurement , using a time projection chamber ( tpc ) located approximately underground at the hoover dam  @xcite . with of nd@xmath21o@xmath22 enriched to @xmath23 of the isotope @xmath2nd and a live time of",

    "the nemo-3collaboration has previously published results on the 2@xmath1decay half - life using half of the total exposure , corresponding to and of @xmath2nd .",
    "the half - life from this data set was measured to be  @xcite .    in this article , we present an updated measurement of the 2@xmath1decay half - life of @xmath2nd using the full data set from the nemo-3experiment , which includes an additional of live time compared to ref .  @xcite .",
    "we construct a full background model for this isotope and evaluate the sources of systematic uncertainties . using this background model and a measurement of the 2@xmath1decay rate , we search for 0@xmath1decays mediated by several possible bsm mechanisms .    in previous publications , limits on 0@xmath1decay rates have been obtained using only the total energy of the two @xmath0 particles emitted in the decay , as this is the most sensitive single observable for the 0@xmath1signal . however , there is additional information embedded in other kinematic and topological observables from the two decay electrons , which can be used to better discriminate the 0@xmath1signal from backgrounds and to disentangle the underlying bsm mechanisms .",
    "the design of the nemo-3detector allows for reconstruction of the topology and kinematics of final state particles , and thus provides a unique opportunity to study several observables and their correlations through a multivariate analysis ( mva ) , thereby improving the sensitivity to 0@xmath1decays . here , we present the first 0@xmath1limits derived from the output distribution of a mva using a boosted decision tree ( bdt )  @xcite .",
    "the nemo-3detector , described in detail in ref .  @xcite and more recently in ref .",
    "@xcite , is designed to search for 0@xmath1decays with seven different isotopes simultaneously by reconstructing the full topology of each decay .",
    "the detector is cylindrical in shape with a height of and diameter of , and is divided into 20 equal sectors .",
    "thin source foils with a thickness of are constructed from the different @xmath10-decay isotopes and are distributed around the different sectors at a fixed radius of approximately .",
    "the source foils are located between two concentric tracking chambers , commonly referred to as the inner and outer chambers , composed of 6180 drift cells operating in geiger mode .",
    "the geiger cells in each chamber are strung vertically and are arranged radially in a 4 - 2 - 3 layer configuration where the four - cell - wide layer is closest to the source foil , and the three - cell - wide layer is closest to the calorimeter ( see ref .",
    "the cells operate in a gas mixture composed primarily of helium with 4% ethanol , 1% argon and 0.15% water vapor .",
    "the tracking detector provides three - dimensional measurements of trajectories and decay vertices of charged particles .",
    "the vertex resolution is determined by comparing the reconstructed positions of calibration sources to their known locations  @xcite .",
    "the resolution depends on both the electron energy and the longitudinal position of the decay vertex . on average , the transverse ( @xmath24 coordinate ) and longitudinal ( @xmath25 coordinate ) resolutions are and , respectively , for electrons  @xcite .    surrounding the tracking chambers on all sides are calorimeter walls composed of 1940 scintillator blocks coupled to low - radioactivity 3-inch and 5-inch photomultiplier tubes ( pmt ) , which provide both timing and energy measurements .",
    "the scintillator blocks on the top and bottom of the detector located in the gaps between the geiger cell layers are referred to as the `` petal blocks '' .",
    "the energy and timing resolutions are determined using calibration sources as described in  @xcite .",
    "the energy resolution of the calorimeter is ( 14.117.7)% ( fwhm ) for the optical modules with 3-inch and 5-inch pmts , respectively , and the average time resolution is @xmath26  ps for electrons with an energy of  @xcite .    to ensure the correct calibration of optical modules in the run periods between absolute energy calibration runs , which occur every 23 weeks , a laser survey was conducted twice daily  @xcite .",
    "this laser survey identifies pmts whose gains have shifted significantly between absolute calibration runs and also provides corrections to time measurements from the pmts . the counting rate for each optical module is also monitored over the course of the experiment .",
    "any pmt with large gain variations or irregular counting rates is excluded from this analysis for the periods during which they are identified as unstable .",
    "the systematic uncertainty on the energy calibration is @xmath27 , which is estimated from the average uncertainty on the gain for all of the remaining pmts used in the analysis .",
    "surrounding the calorimeter is a solenoid coil that produces a magnetic field of parallel to the axis of the cylinder .",
    "this magnetic field provides discrimination between electrons and positrons through their track curvature .",
    "the overburden at lsm is approximately , which significantly reduces the cosmic ray flux .",
    "the decays of naturally occurring @xmath28u , @xmath29th , and their daughter decay products located in the rock surrounding the lsm laboratory can produce external neutron and @xmath30-ray fluxes that constitute backgrounds to the @xmath10-decay signal  @xcite .",
    "several components of passive shielding around the nemo-3detector reduce this external background flux .",
    "after the first year of operation , an anti - radon facility was installed to reduce the amount of @xmath31rn diffusion into the detector .",
    "the facility comprises an airtight tent to provide a buffer zone between the laboratory air and the active detector volume , and a carbon trap air filtration system that removes residual @xmath31rn in this buffer zone .",
    "the use of this facility reduces the overall activity of @xmath31rn decay products in the active detector by a factor of six  @xcite .",

    "the nd@xmath21o@xmath22 powder was mixed with a concentration of @xmath36 polyvinyl alcohol for bonding to two mylar backing films to produce a composite source foil with a total mass of for insertion into the nemo-3detector .",
    "the total mass of @xmath2nd in the foil is  @xcite .",
    "two data taking phases are defined for nemo-3detector operation .",
    "they correspond to the run periods before ( phase 1 ) and after ( phase 2 ) the installation of the anti - radon facility .",
    "the combined data from both phases yield a live time of , which corresponds to an exposure for @xmath2nd of . this live time is larger than the one used in  ref .",

    "a nemo-3event trigger requires an energy deposit in the calorimeter of approximately in combination with a series of geiger hits in three different layers occurring within in the same or a nearby sector  @xcite .",
    "a tracking algorithm constructs helical tracks from these prompt geiger hits .",
    "the tracks are extrapolated to the source foil radius to obtain a vertex location and to the calorimeter wall to associate an optical module for energy and time measurements .",
    "an electron is defined as a track that is associated with an isolated optical module on the calorimeter wall .",
    "several criteria are applied to select electrons with good quality track and energy reconstruction .",
    "the curvature of the track is required to be consistent with a negatively charged particle as determined by the magnetic field , where the charge is determined by assuming the track originates at the source foil .",
    "the reconstructed track length is required to be at least for events with a single track to ensure that the vertex and calorimeter impact points are accurately extrapolated . to further improve the track extrapolation to the vertex",
    ", the tracks must have an associated geiger cell hit within one of the first two layers of the tracker closest to the source foil .",

    "the separation between each individually reconstructed vertex is required to be ( transverse direction ) and ( longitudinal direction ) to ensure that the two tracks are associated to a common event .",
    "this separation is significantly larger than the vertex resolution . using the data and predicated background rates",
    ", we estimate the background from two simultaneous single @xmath0 decays in this allowed region to be negligible .    to ensure optimal energy reconstruction , tracks must enter the calorimeter blocks from the front face .",
    "only events with electrons of energies are considered in this analysis , as the rate of background decays rapidly increases below this threshold .",
    "electrons from @xmath2nd @xmath10 decays achieve much higher energies due to the large @xmath16 value .",
    "electron tracks extrapolated to the petal blocks closest to the source foil are rejected in this analysis because of the poorer energy and time resolution for these events  @xcite .",
    "geiger hits that are recorded in a time window after the calorimeter trigger are also stored .",
    "these delayed hits are used to identify @xmath37 particles from @xmath38bi@xmath38po cascades .",
    "the rate of these cascades is used to constrain the activity of @xmath38bi , which is an important background in the search for 0@xmath1decays .",
    "a @xmath38bi@xmath38po cascade is characterised by a ( @xmath0,@xmath30 ) decay followed by an @xmath37 decay with a delay consistent with the @xmath38po half - life of @xmath39 =  @xcite .",
    "the trajectory of an @xmath37 particle with the same energy as an electron will not be significantly affected by the magnetic field because of its larger mass . due to large ionization energy losses ,",
    "the lengths of tracks produced by @xmath37 particles from radioactive decays are shorter than  @xcite .",
    "therefore , @xmath37 particles are identified in the nemo-3detector as short , straight tracks composed of delayed geiger hits .",
    "many decays that are sources of background are accompanied by the emission of high energy @xmath30 rays .",

    "no more than one prompt geiger hit located within of any @xmath30-ray hits is allowed .",
    "this reduces the misidentification of electrons as @xmath30 rays , while allowing for low level tracker noise which is not simulated .",
    "calorimeter noise can be characterized as isolated calorimeter hits with and no track association .",
    "since calorimeter noise is also not simulated for this analysis , calorimeter hits meeting these criteria are ignored in the event selection process .",
    "vertices are required to be located within the boundaries of the @xmath2nd source foil , defined as and @xmath40 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : foilmap ] ) .",
    "several regions of high activity are identified in the @xmath2nd source foil that correspond to localized contamination from @xmath41pa and @xmath42bi .",
    "these regions are referred to as hot spots and are evident in the vertex distribution shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : foilmap_hs ] .",
    "the origin of these hotspots in unknown , though they were likely introduced during the foil production or installation . due to the ability to accurately reconstruct track vertices ,",

    "discrimination between decays that are internal and external to the source foil is achieved with two time - of - flight ( tof ) probabilities that are defined using the energy and time measurements from the calorimeter and the distances travelled by each particle in the event  @xcite .",
