    "it is clear that massive cancellations have occurred , and that the area under an oscillation peak can be much greater in magnitude than the final result .",

    "there it was found that the force can be considerably larger than that given by eq .",
    "( [ cp ] ) , and furthermore can be either attractive or repulsive .",
    "the force was found to be quasi - oscillatory , with a period of the order of the plasma wavelength of the material in the sphere .",

    "we will use subscripts @xmath15 and @xmath16 to distinguish between other parameters describing the wall and the sphere respectively . at present , we assume that the temperature is zero .    the mean casimir force on the sphere can be written as a fourier transform : @xmath17 where @xmath18 can be viewed as the contribution of a vacuum mode of frequency @xmath19 .",
    "this contribution can be found from essentially classical considerations , as it is the normal component of the classical force on the sphere when a plane wave of frequency @xmath19 is incident on the sphere - interface system . in i",
    ", it was calculated in an electric dipole approximation for the wave scattered by the sphere ; the force is found as an integral of the maxwell stress tensor over the sphere . in the present case ,",

    "so long as the temperature stays within this range of validity , the thermal correction enhances the magnitude of the force , with no shift in the positions of the force maxima and minima as illustrated in figure  [ fig : force_b5 ] for case @xmath124 . in most of the cases of interest",
    ", @xmath12 is in the ultraviolet range , so @xmath125 at room temperature .",
    "the temperature is also limited by the melting point of the material of the wall .",
    "although the finite - temperature corrections to the force are small , there is another thermal effect which can be more significant .",
    "this is the possibility of thermally activated transitions between the stable equilibrium points , which become important when the required energy is of order @xmath126 .",
    "we can estimate this effect by noting that for the case @xmath127 , this energy is approximately @xmath128 which can be expressed as @xmath129 note that @xmath130 , so for @xmath131 the upper limit on the size of a sphere that would fit inside of a particular potential minimum is about @xmath132 . in this case , the thermal activation effect would be small at room temperature",
    ". however , for a smaller sphere , e.g. , @xmath133 , thermal activation would be noticeable at room temperature .",
    "we have investigated a model for the amplification of vacuum fluctuations , in which a resonance near the plasma frequency significantly increases the magnitude of the force compared to the non - dispersive case .",
    "in particular , we have examined the effects of finite reflectivity of the wall and of finite temperature .",
    "finite reflectivity can decrease the magnitude of the effect , but so long as @xmath14 is of the order of , or larger than @xmath134 , the perfectly reflecting results are qualitatively correct .",
    "finite temperature can enhance the magnitude of the effect , but with typical plasma frequencies in the ultraviolet range , the correction to the force at room temperature is extremely small . however , thermal activation can be significant , especially for smaller spheres .",
    "the key prediction of this model is a force that is alternatively attractive and repulsive as a function of separation .",
    "the ratio of the peak force to that of gravity on a sphere near an interface with @xmath135 is approximately given by @xmath136 where @xmath137 is the mass density of the sphere .",
    "this suggests a possibility of an experimental test of the model in which the sphere could levitate in the earth s gravitational field at equilibrium positions .",
    "if forces whose magnitudes are large compared to those give by eq .  ( [ cp ] ) with @xmath138 are found , the result can be interpreted as a form of amplification of vacuum fluctuations .",
    "the spheres need to be small ( @xmath139 ) , so experiments on metal sphere would have to involve spheres with radii in approximately the @xmath140 to @xmath141 range . in the case of gold spheres , for example , ( @xmath142 ) , the sphere radius would have to be less than @xmath132 and preferably less than about @xmath143 .",
    "one might also ask if a similar amplification is possible for the casimir force between perfectly reflecting parallel plates .",
    "the spectrum of the casimir force in this case was discussed by hacyan , _ et al _",
    "@xcite , and one of the present authors  @xcite , and found to be quasi - oscillatory , as in the case of the casimir - polder potential .",
    "however , as was shown by lifshitz @xcite , the force between a pair of dielectric half - spaces is always attractive and no larger in magnitude than the casimir force .",
    "thus upsetting the cancellation seems to be more difficult for half - spaces , and suggests that the small sphere approximation may be crucial . to obtain a quasi - oscillatory force . for larger objects , there may be a cancellation of the contributions of different spatial regions .",
