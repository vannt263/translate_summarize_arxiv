    "according to quark models ( qm s ) @xcite , baryons can be described as the bound states of three constituent quarks .",
    "these are effective degrees of freedom that mimic the three valence quarks inside baryons , with a sea of gluons and @xmath0 sea pairs .",
    "the light baryons can then be ordered according to the approximate su@xmath1(3 ) symmetry into the multiplets @xmath2_a \\oplus [ 8]_m \\oplus [ 8]_m \\oplus [ 10]_s$ ] .",
    "qm s explain quite well several properties of baryons , such as the strong decays and the magnetic moments .",
    "nevertheless , they predict a larger number of states than the experimentally observed ones ( the missing resonances problem ) and states with certain quantum numbers appear in the spectrum at excitation energies much lower than predicted @xcite .",
    "the problem of the missing resonances @xcite has motivated the realization of several experiments , such as cb - elsa @xcite , taps @xcite , graal @xcite , saphir @xcite and clas @xcite , which only provided a few weak indications about some states . indeed , even if several experiments have been dedicated to the search of missing states , just a small number of new resonances has been included into the pdg @xcite .",
    "there are two possible explanations to the puzzle of the missing resonances : 1 ) there may be resonances very weakly coupled to the single pion , but with higher probabilities of decaying into two or more pions or into other mesons @xcite .",
    "the detection of such states is further complicated by the problem of the separation of the experimental data from the background and by the expansion of the differential cross section into many partial waves ; 2 ) alternately , it is possible to consider models that are characterized by a smaller number of effective degrees of freedom with respect to the three quarks qm s and to assume that the majority of the missing states , not yet experimentally observed , simply may not exist .",
    "this is the case of quark - diquark models @xcite , where two quarks are strongly correlated and thus the state space is heavily reduced .    in quark - diquark models ,",
    "the effective degrees of freedom of diquarks are introduced to describe baryons as bound states of a constituent diquark and quark @xcite .",
    "the notion of diquark dates back to 1964 , when its possibility was mentioned by gell - mann @xcite in his original paper on quarks . since then",
    ", many papers have been written on this topic ( for a review see ref .",
    "@xcite ) and , more recently , the diquark concept has been applied to various calculations @xcite",
    ". important phenomenological indications for diquark - like correlations have been collected @xcite and indications for diquark confinement have also been provided @xcite .",
    "this makes plausibly enough to make diquarks a part of the baryon s wave function .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , one of us developed an nonrelativistic interacting quark - diquark model , i.e. a potential model based on the effective degrees of freedom of a constituent quark and diquark . in ref .",
    "@xcite , it was `` relativized '' and reformulated within the point form formalism @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , we used the wave functions of ref .",
    "@xcite to compute the nucleon electromagnetic form factors . here",
    ", we intend to improve the `` relativized '' model @xcite and compute the non strange baryon spectrum within point form dynamics .    even if our previous results for the non strange baryon spectrum @xcite were in general quite good , here we intend to show how the introduction of a spin - isospin transition interaction , inducing the mixing between quark - scalar diquark and quark - axial - vector diquark states in the nucleon wave function , can further improve them , as already suggested in ref .",
    "scalar and axial - vector diquarks are two correlated quarks in @xmath3 wave with spin 0 or 1 , respectively @xcite . in a following paper , we will use the new wave functions , obtained by solving the eigenvalue problem of the mass operator of the present model , to compute the nucleon electromagnetic form factors and the elicity amplitudes .",
    "we consider a quark - diquark system , where @xmath4 is the relative coordinate between the two constituents and @xmath5 is the conjugate momentum to @xmath4 .",
    "we propose a relativistic quark - diquark model , based on the following baryon rest frame mass operator @xmath6 where @xmath7 is a constant , @xmath8 and @xmath9 respectively the direct and the exchange diquark - quark interaction , @xmath10 and @xmath11 stand for diquark and quark masses , where @xmath10 is either @xmath12 or @xmath13 according if the part of the mass operator diagonal in the diquark spin [ i.e. the whole mass operator of eq .",
    "( [ eqn : h0 ] ) without the interaction @xmath14 acts on a scalar or an axial - vector diquark @xcite , @xmath15 is a contact interaction and @xmath16 is a spin - isospin transition interaction .",
    "the direct term is a coulomb - like interaction with a cut off plus a linear confinement term @xmath17    one needs also an exchange interaction @xcite , since this is the crucial ingredient of a quark - diquark description of baryons .",
    "we have @xmath18   ~~ ,      \\label{eqn : vexchs1}\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] where @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the spin and the isospin operators .",
    "moreover , we consider a contact interaction similar to that introduced by godfrey and isgur @xcite @xmath21 where @xmath22 ( @xmath23 = 1 , 2 ) , @xmath24 and @xmath25 are parameters of the model .",
    "finally we consider a spin - isospin transition interaction , @xmath16 , in order to mix quark - scalar diquark and quark - axial - vector diquark states .",
    "@xmath16 is chosen as @xmath26 where @xmath27 and @xmath28 are free parameters .",

    "indeed , @xmath16 makes it possible to have a nucleon wave function with a quark - axial - vector diquark component in addition to the quark - scalar diquark one . at the same time , @xmath16 significantly improves the description of the non strange baryon spectrum @xcite ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : spectrum3e4 ] ) .",
    "one can also notice that the values of the model parameters change significantly from those of ref .",
    "@xcite after the introduction of the interaction ( [ eqn : vtr(r ) ] ) into the mass formula . in particular",
    ", one can see that the masses of the two constituents ( the quark and the diquark ) are now smaller than before , which is good in a relativistic qm , and the mass difference between the scalar and the axial - vector diquark is smaller too ( it goes from 350 mev to 210 mev ) .",
    "the same happens for the string tension , that goes from 2.15 @xmath39 to 1.57 @xmath39 .",
