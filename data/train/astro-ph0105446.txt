    "low - mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) are binary systems containing a compact object ( either a neutron star or black hole ) which is accreting matter from a low - mass companion star ( @xmath71 m@xmath8 ) . a particular sub - class of lmxbs , the x - ray transients ,",
    "have received special interest . due to the high variations in accretion rate",
    ", these systems can be studied under a very wide range of physical conditions .",
    "they exhibit ( sometimes recurrent ) outbursts during which they resemble in detail the persistent lmxbs .",
    "most of the time , however , these x - ray transient are in quiescence , during which no or hardly any accretion onto the compact object takes place .",
    "the outburst profiles of the x - ray transients are very diverse and although the most recent versions of the disk instability model can explain the outburst light curve properties in general , some important issues remain unexplained ( see lasota 2001 for a review of disk instability models ) .",
    "in most sources , the x - ray flux during the outburst decreases steadily to quiescence levels , although some transients exhibited a much more complex behavior ( see , e.g. , chen , shrader , & livio 1997 and bradt et al .",
    "some sources exhibit periods of low - level activity for several months to several years , long after the outburst is over . both black hole systems ( e.g. , 4u 163047 or xte j0421 + 560 :",

    "2000 ) and neutron star systems ( e.g. , aql x-1 and 4u 160852 ; bradt et al . 2000 ) can exhibit this behavior . besides the low - level of activity observed after a full outburst , aql x-1 also exhibited so - called `` failed '' outbursts , during which the source does not reach typical outburst luminosity but low - level activity is present for weeks ( bradt et al .",
    "the physical processes behind these long episodes of low - activity are unclear .",
    "one possibility is that these states indicate that the conditions for exhibiting outbursts are marginal and when systems accrete close to the critical value they might show low - level activity for several weeks to months ( see also bradt et al .",
    "2000 ) . in the remainder of this _",
    "letter _ , we refer to these long episode of low - level activity in x - ray transients as `` the low - activity state '' .      in september 1996 , using the _ bepposax _ wide field cameras ( wfc ) , a new x - ray transient ( designated sax j1808.43658 ) was discovered ( in t zand et al .",
    "the neutron - star nature of the compact object in this system was deduced from the observations of type - i x - ray bursts from which also a distance of @xmath22.5 kpc was derived ( in t zand et al . 1998 ; 2001 ) .",
    "the source had a maximum luminosity of @xmath9 ergs s@xmath1  ( 325 kev ) and could be detected for several weeks .",
    "the source remained dormant until 9 april 1998 , when it was detected again , but this time with the proportional counter array ( pca ) aboard the _ rossi x - ray timing explorer _ ( _ rxte _ ; marshall 1998 ) .",
    "using the _ rxte_/pca data , coherent 401 hz pulsations were discovered in the x - ray flux of sax j1808.43658 , making this source the first known accretion - driven millisecond x - ray pulsar ( wijnands & van der klis 1998a ) .",
    "it was also found that the neutron star is in a 2 hr binary with a very low - mass companion star ( chakrabarty & morgan 1998 ; see bildsten & chakrabarty 2001 for a discussion about the possible brown dwarf nature of the companion star of sax j1808.43658 ) . during its 1998 outburst ,",
    "its aperiodic rapid x - ray variability ( wijnands & van der klis 1998b ) and its x - ray spectrum ( gilfanov et al . 1998 ; heindl & smith 1998 ) were remarkably similar to those of other lmxbs with similar luminosities .",
    "therefore , it is very puzzling why persistent millisecond pulsations have so far only been detected from this source and not from any other neutron star lmxbs .    during its 1998 outburst ,",
    "the source was detected for a few weeks ( see , e.g. , gilfanov et al .",
    "1998 or cui , morgan , & titarchuk 1998 for its 1998 light curve ) before it returned to quiescence .",
    "sax j1808.43658 was detected for a third time on 21 january 2000 ( again with the _ rxte_/pca ) , but this time at a flux level of about a tenth of the fluxes observed during the september 1996 and april 1998 outbursts ( van der klis et al .",
    "when the source was detected , the pulsations at 401 hz were observed and during several _ rxte _ observations very strong violent flaring behavior with a repetition frequency of about 1 hz was present ( van der klis et al . 2000 ; wijnands et al .",
    "2000 ) . during this outburst",
    ", several _ bepposax _ observations were also performed to study the broad band spectrum of the source . here",
    ", we report on the 2000 outburst light curve of sax j1808.43658 as obtained with the _ rxte_/pca .",

    "after sax j1808.4 - 3658 was first detected on 21 january 2000 , the source was frequently monitored with _",
    "rxte _ as part of our ao4 too program on this source .",
    "a total of 41 observations were obtained for a total of @xmath2150 ksec on source time . during the observations ,",
    "the data were taken simultaneously in the standard 1 ( 1 energy channel and 1/8 s time resolution ) and standard 2 modes ( 129 channels ; 16 s resolution ) , and the event mode e_125us_64m_0_1s ( 64 channels ; 122@xmath10s  resolution ) .",
    "the only observation during which different modes were used was 40035 - 01 - 04 - 00 g .",
    "after a brief interval of non - detections of sax j1808.43658 , the source was found to be active again and _ rxte _ was slewed in real - time to the position of sax j1808.43658 . as a consequence ,",
    "the high - timing modes used during this observation were the same one as those used on the previous target and were the goodxenon1_16s and goodxenon2_16s modes ( combined they have 256 channels for 260 kev and a time resolution of @xmath2 1 @xmath10s ) . in this _",

    "the results obtained with the high time resolution modes are presented in morgan et al .",
    "( 2001 ) .",
    "the standard 2 mode data were used to extract the count rates of the source and the x - ray spectra .",
    "the count rates were only extracted for proportional counter units ( pcus ) 0 and 2 , which were always on during our observations .",
    "spectra were extracted for all the detectors which were on during the particular observations .",
    "we used the tools provided with ftools version 5.0.4 to extract the background data ( using the `` faint source '' model ) which were used to correct the count rates and the spectra .",
    "we fitted the x - ray spectra between 3 and 25 kev ( with a 1% systematic error added ) .",
    "the spectra were fitted with a power - law with a free - floating absorption column density ( the column densities obtained from the fit were consistent with zero _ and _ with the galactic value of @xmath11 @xmath12 towards sax j1808.43658 ; dickey & lockman 1990 ) . during several observations",
    ", the power - law alone did not produce an acceptable fit to the data and an extra low - energy ( @xmath75 kev ) component needed to be added .",
    "however , when fitting this component with a black - body , very low @xmath13 ( @xmath70.5 kev ) values were obtained .",
    "presently , it is unclear whether this component is real or if it is due to residual calibration uncertainties of the detectors at low energies . we will not discuss this further in our paper .",
    "when no source flux could be detected we obtained 95% confidence upper limits to the flux by fixing the power - law photon index to 2 .",
    "the actual limits for the individual observations ( 0.020.2 @xmath14 ergs s@xmath1 @xmath12 ) depended upon the on source time and the number of pcus on during those observations .    in our analysis we also included the data obtained as part of _",
    "rxte_/pca monitoring of the galactic bulge region .",
    "observations began in february 1999 , and typically take place twice per week , except for approximately 2.5 months between november and february when the sun is near the galactic center ( markwardt et al . 2000 ; markwardt 2000 ) . the data ( in good - xenon mode )",
    "are obtained by scanning the spacecraft to cover a large region .",
    "intensities of known sources are derived by fitting a collimator model to the observed light curve , including the contribution of a diffuse emission component ( see markwardt et al .",
    "2001 for details ) .",
    "sax j1808.43658 lies at the endpoint of one of the scans , and because the spacecraft must dwell at that point momentarily the exposure is 23 minutes .",
    "the scans are thus sensitive to variations at the @xmath15 ergs s@xmath1 @xmath12  level .",
    "our too observations were performed until 1 march 2000 , but the bulge scan observations continue .",
    "the 260 kev count rate curve of sax j1808.43658 during its 2000 outburst is shown in figure [ fig : rxte_lc ] . for display purposes",
    ", we only use the data obtained with the _ rxte_/pca bulge scan up to 26 october 2000 . during the bulge scan observations performed after that date ,",
    "the source was not detected and only count rate upper limits could be obtained .",
    "the gap in the data ( between 2 november 1999 and 21 january 2000 ) in figure  [ fig : rxte_lc]_a _ is due to solar constraints , which did not allow _ rxte _ observations of sax j1808.43658 in this period .",
    "clearly , three episodes of distinct behavior can be observed for this source . before 2 november 1999 , the source was undetected with typical upper limits on the luminosity of a few times @xmath4",
    "ergs s@xmath1  ( 325 kev ; hereafter , the quoted luminosities are for this energy range and for a distance of 2.5 kpc or otherwise noted ) .",
    "however , the source was found to be active on 21 january 2000 with a maximum reached luminosity of @xmath16 ergs s@xmath1  ( on 2 february 2000 ) .",
    "c    in figure  [ fig : rxte_lc]_b _ and _ c _ , close - ups of the count rate curve are displayed to show the strong variability more clearly . as can be seen , the source was highly variable on time scales of days , with episodes of clear activity ( luminosities up to @xmath17 ergs s@xmath1 ) followed by episodes of non - activity ( with _ rxte_/pca upper limits on the luminosity of typically a few times 10@xmath18 ergs s@xmath1 ) . in figure  [ fig : rxte_lc]_b _ , the times of the _ bepposax _ observations ( 2000 march 56 , 8 , and 2223 ; wijnands et al .",
    "2001 ) are indicated , clearly showing that they were all taken during intervals when the source was in a non - active episode .",
    "consequently , during these observations the source was not detected , with an upper limit on the luminosity of @xmath5 ergs s@xmath1  ( 0.55.0 kev ) .",
    "however , only a few days later , on 11 march , sax j1808.43658 could again be detected with _",
    "rxte_/pca at @xmath19 ergs s@xmath1 , demonstrating a factor of @xmath61000 swing in luminosity on time scales of days .",
    "the active episodes last typically only a few days but the non - active episodes could last for weeks to up to @xmath244 days ( although active episodes with a duration of @xmath73 days might have remained undetected due to the 34 day sampling of the data ) . from figure",
    "[ fig : rxte_lc]_c _ , it is apparent that the source was also highly variable on time scales of only a few hours .",
    "in particular , the decrease in count rate with a factor of @xmath220 ( from 100 to 5 counts s@xmath1 ) occurred in @xmath25 hours and the subsequent increase took only @xmath21 hour .",
    "the last time sax j1808.43658 could be detected was on 2000 may 13 in a bulge scan observation .",
    "since then the source has remained undetectable with the _ rxte_/pca ( with upper limits of typically @xmath4 erg s@xmath1 ) and it is presumed to be in quiescence .    during the 2000 outburst , sax j1808.43658 was spectrally very constant with a power - law photon index varying between 1.9 and 2.4 ( a mean of 2.16 ) .",
    "no correlations were found between the spectral parameters and time , count rate , or with the episodes of the violent flaring . as expected ,",
    "the count rates were nicely correlated with the x - ray fluxes and the count rates shown in figure  [ fig : rxte_lc ] can be converted to fluxes using a linear relationship of : flux ( @xmath20 ergs s@xmath1 @xmath12 ; 325 kev ) = 0.12@xmath210.01 @xmath22 count rate ( counts s@xmath1  pcu@xmath1 ; 260 kev ) .",
    "because the errors on the count rates are significantly smaller than those on the obtained fluxes , we only show the count rate curve .",
    "furthermore , the _ rxte_/pca bulge scans resulted only in count rate determinations of sax j1808.43658 . due to the very brief exposures on the source and its very low count rates ( @xmath23 counts s@xmath1  pcu@xmath1 after background subtraction )",
    ", the data did not allow to fit the spectral data to obtain the spectral parameters .",
    "however , because the source spectra did not change significantly during all our too observations , it is likely that also during the bulge scan observations , the source had a similar power - law shaped x - ray spectrum .",
    "we presented the _ rxte_/pca light curve of the only known millisecond x - ray pulsar during its 2000 outburst .",
    "the maximum observed luminosity was only @xmath24 ergs s@xmath1  ( assuming a distance of 2.5 kpc ) , which is about a factor of 10 lower than the luminosities observed during the 1996 and 1998 outbursts .",
    "however , due to solar constraints the source could not be observed with _ rxte _ before 2000 january 21 so the exact moment of the start of the outburst is unknown and the peak luminosity could have been significantly higher .",
    "the source exhibited strong variability by a factor of @xmath220 on time scales of 15 hours , but by even larger factors on time scales of days . therefore , the source became frequently too dim to be detected with _",
    "rxte_. the last detection with _",
    "rxte _ was on 2000 may 13 , almost four months after the source was first detected .",
    "sax j1808.43658 was also observed ( on march 56 , 8 , and 2223 ) during its 2000 outburst with _",
    "bepposax _ , but during these observations it could not be detected , with an upper limit on its luminosity ( 0.55 kev ) of @xmath25 ergs s@xmath1  ( wijnands et al .",
    "however , on march 11 and 30 , we detected the source again in the bulge scan observations , giving a luminosity of about @xmath17 ergs s@xmath1  ( 325 kev ) .",
    "this demonstrates that the source was variable with a factor of about thousand on time scales of only a few days .",
    "the erratic 2000 outburst behavior of sax j1808.43658 raises the question whether this was an unique event , or if this behavior is more common for this source . by closely examining the data obtained for the previous outbursts",
    ", we might be able to provide some answers .",
    "the 1996 outburst was only observed with the _ bepposax_/wfc .",
    "the recent detection of a third type - i x - ray burst with the wfc , @xmath230 days after the peak of the 1996 outburst , clearly demonstrates that accretion was still occurring in this system several weeks after the wfc could not detect the persistent flux anymore ( with upper limits on the persistent emission of @xmath26 ergs s@xmath1 ; 228 kev ; in t zand et al .",
    "although this is only a small fraction of the duration of the 2000 low - activity state , it indicates that the source could have been accreting considerably longer during this outburst than previously assumed .",
    "the complete _ rxte_/pca light curve obtained during the 1998 outburst is shown in cui et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , from which it is clear that during the last three observations , the source flux behaved erratically .",
    "after the luminosity had decreased steadily to @xmath27 ergs s@xmath1  ( 230 kev ) , it briefly increased again a few days later to @xmath28 ergs s@xmath1  ( during the next to last observation ) . during the last observation",
    ", the luminosity had decreased to around @xmath29 ergs s@xmath1 , but the source was still detected ( thus , during all 1998 observations the source was detected ) and the behavior of the source after this last observation is unknown but it can not be excluded that the source entered a similar low - level activity state as we observed during the 2000 outburst . to conclude ,",
    "we can not rule out that these low - activity states of sax j1808.43658 are a common feature of the behavior of the source .",
    "however , to conclusively answer this question several new outbursts of this source have to be observed with x - ray instruments with enough sensitivity and with monitoring capabilities ( i.e. , the _ rxte_/pca bulge scans ; note that the _ rxte _ all sky monitor or the _ bepposax_/wfc were not sensitive enough to detect this source during its 2000 low - activity state ; j. in t zand 2001 private communication ) .",
    "the low - activity state of sax j1808.43658 resembles similar states observed for several other transients ( see   [ intro ] ) .",
    "because it is unknown when sax j1808.43658 was first active in the 2000 outburst , it is difficult to distinguish for this source between a failed outburst ( similar to what was observed for aql x-1 ; bradt et al .",
    "2000 ) or a low - activity state that occurred after a major outburst .",
    "even the duration of the low - activity state of sax j1808.43658 ( @xmath2114 days ) is in between the duration of the failed outburst ( @xmath27080 days ) and the low - activity state after a major outburst ( @xmath2150160 days ) of aql x-1 ( note that the low - activity states observed for 4u 160852 and 4u163047 can last for several years ) .",
    "the question remains if disk instability models can explain these low - activity states .",
    "the most recent versions of the disk instability models take also into account irradiation of the disk by the central x - ray emitting region ( dubus , hameury , & lasota 2001 ; see lasota 2001 for a review ) .",
    "such models can produce the exponential decay of the x - ray light curves of certain x - ray transients , but can not explain other types of light curves .",
    "other processes like an irradiation - induced increase of the mass transfer rate from the companion star might be responsible for the different type of light curves or for the low - level activity states ( see , e.g. , kuulkers et al .",
    "1997 for a discussion about this as a possible explanation for the low - level activity in 4u 163047 ) .",
    "it is difficult to understand the dramatic , factor of @xmath30 luminosity variations we observe in sax j1808.43658 as owing to similarly dramatic variations in the mass accretion rate over such short ( @xmath21 day ) time scales .",
    "perhaps more modest variations can trigger transitions between two significantly different luminosity states .",
    "one possible mechanism is the centrifugal inhibition of magnetic accretion expected below a critical accretion rate  the so - called `` propeller '' regime ( illarionov & sunyaev 1975 ) .",
    "the onset of such centrifugal inhibition has been invoked to explain the sharp steepening of the light curve decay at the end of the 1998 outburst of sax j1808.43658 ( gilfanov et al .",
    "1998 ) as well as the 1997 outburst of the neutron star transient aql x-1 ( campana et al .",
    "1998 ) . in the 1998 outburst of sax j1808.43658 , the transition occurred when the x - ray luminosity dropped below @xmath31 erg  s@xmath1 ( assuming a 2.5 kpc distance ) , corresponding to a critical mass accretion rate of @xmath32 yr@xmath1 .",
    "if the propeller effect is indeed responsible for the sharp break in the 1998 light curve , then small but erratic variations around @xmath33 could in principle give rise to the enormous luminosity swings we observed in 2000 .",
    "it is interesting to note that the peak 2000 luminosity of @xmath34 erg s@xmath1 is very close to the critical transition value inferred from the 1998 outburst , consistent with a propeller interpretation .",
    "although it is not clear what might cause the required small variations in the mass accretion rate around @xmath35 , such variations may be characteristic of the outburst tails in soft x - ray transients .",
    "in that case , the dramatically variable behavior observed in sax j1808.43658 ( but not in other transients ) may be an accident of the system s @xmath33 , which depends upon the neutron star s spin period and magnetic field strength .",
    "the propeller mechanism might also explain why sax j1808.43658 became as faint as it did in between the active episodes ( to quiescent luminosities ; dotani , asai , & wijnands 2000 ) .",
    "it is unclear whether or not the non - active episodes during the 2000 outburst in between the active ones can be regarded as true quiescent states , because of the presence of an inner accretion disk in the system ( down to the magnetosphere of the system ) , which is presumably absent in quiescence .",
    "but it is also unclear how ( or even if ) such an accretion disk would affect the x - ray properties of the source compared to the true quiescent state .",
