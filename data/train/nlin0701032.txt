    "the classical dynamics in hamiltonian systems shows a rich behaviour ranging from integrable to fully chaotic motion . in chaotic systems",
    "nearby trajectories separate exponentially in time and ergodicity implies that a typical trajectory fills out the energy - surface in a uniform way",
    ". however , integrable and fully chaotic dynamics are exceptional @xcite as typical hamiltonian systems show a mixed phase space in which regions of regular motion , the so - called regular islands around stable periodic orbits , and chaotic dynamics , the so - called chaotic sea , coexist .    for quantized hamiltonian systems the fundamental questions",
    "concern the behaviour of the eigenvalues and the properties of eigenfunctions , especially in the semiclassical regime . from the semiclassical eigenfunction hypothesis @xcite",
    "one expects that in the semiclassical limit the eigenstates concentrate on those regions in phase space which a typical orbit explores in the long - time limit . for integrable systems these are the invariant tori .",
    "in contrast , for ergodic systems almost all orbits fill the energy shell in a uniform way .",
    "for this situation the semiclassical eigenfunction hypothesis is proven by the quantum ergodicity theorem which shows that almost all eigenstates become equidistributed on the energy shell  @xcite .    for systems with a mixed phase space , in the semiclassical limit @xmath0",
    ", the semiclassical eigenfunction hypothesis implies that the eigenstates can be classified as being either regular or chaotic according to the phase - space region on which they concentrate .",
    "this is supported by several studies , see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "it is also possible , that the influence of a regular island quantum mechanically extends beyond the outermost invariant curve due to partial barriers like cantori and that quantization conditions remain approximately applicable even outside of the island @xcite .",
    "however , it was recently shown that the classification into regular and chaotic states does not hold when the phase space has an infinite volume @xcite . in this case",
    "eigenstates may completely ignore the classical phase space boundaries between regular and chaotic regions .    in order to understand the behaviour of eigenstates away from the semiclassical limit , i.e.  at finite values of the planck constant @xmath1",
    ", one has to compare the size of phase - space structures with @xmath1 .",
    "let us consider for simplicity the case of two - dimensional area preserving maps and their quantizations .",
    "regular states of an island concentrate on tori which fulfill the ebk - type quantization condition @xmath2 for the enclosed area @xcite .",
    "this quantization rule explicitly shows that regular eigenstates only appear if @xmath3 is smaller than the area @xmath4 of that island .",
    "another consequence of finite @xmath1 in systems with a mixed phase space is dynamical tunneling @xcite , i.e.  tunneling through dynamically generated barriers in phase space , in contrast to the usual tunneling under a potential barrier .",
    "dynamical tunneling couples the subspace spanned by the regular basis states , corresponding to the quantization condition , with the complementary subspace @xcite composed of chaotic basis states .",
    "this raises the question whether the _ eigenstates _ of such a quantum system can still be called _",
    "regular _ or _",
    "chaotic_.    in ref .",
    "@xcite it was shown that is not a sufficient condition for the existence of a regular eigenstate on the @xmath5-th quantized torus .",
    "in addition one has to fulfill @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the heisenberg time of the surrounding chaotic sea with mean level spacing @xmath8 and @xmath9 is the decay rate of the @xmath5-th regular state , if the chaotic sea were infinite",
    ". when condition is violated one observes eigenstates which extend over the chaotic region and flood the @xmath5-th torus @xcite . to distinguish them from the chaotic eigenstates that do not flood the torus , they are referred to as _ flooding eigenstates_. for the limiting case of complete flooding of all tori , the corresponding eigenstates were called amphibious @xcite .",
    "recently , the consequences of flooding for the transport properties in rough nano - wires were studied @xcite .    the process of flooding was explained and demonstrated for a kicked system in ref .",
    "condition was obtained by scaling arguments , which can not provide a prefactor .",
    "moreover , for an ensemble of systems , one would like to know the probability for the existence of a regular eigenstate .",
    "in particular , when varying the heisenberg time , how broad is the transition regime during which this probability goes from 1 to 0 ?",
    "another question is , how do the chaotic eigenstates turn into flooding eigenstates for a given torus ?    in this paper we give quantitative answers to these questions .",
    "we study the flooding of regular tori in terms of the weight of eigenstates inside the regular region and devise a random matrix model which allows for describing the statistics of these weights in detail .",
    "random matrix models have been very successful for obtaining quantitative predictions on eigenstates in both fully chaotic systems and systems with a mixed phase space , see e.g.  @xcite . for the present situation",
    "we propose a random matrix model which takes regular basis states and their coupling to the chaotic basis states into account .",
    "the only free parameters are the strength of the coupling and the ratio of the number of regular to the number of chaotic basis states . from this model",
    "the weight distribution for eigenstates is determined .    for a kicked system",
    "we define the weight by the projection of the eigenstates onto regular basis states localized on a given torus @xmath5 .",
    "the distribution of the weights allows for studying the flooding of each torus separately .",
    "the resulting distributions are compared with the prediction of the random matrix model and , after an appropriate rescaling , very good agreement is observed .",
