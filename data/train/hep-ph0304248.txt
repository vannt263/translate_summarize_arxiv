    "new physics contributions , which enter through one loop radiative corrections , may be observed whenever the sm contributions absent or suppressed .",
    "thus , the measurement of @xmath7 has a very good chance to reveal new physics beyond standard model .",
    "one way in which new physics may reveal its presence is for there to be a deviation from the standard model prediction for @xmath8 . in the absence of a deviation in the cross section ,",
    "it is still possible that new physics will be show itself in the details of the @xmath7 signal .",
    "the detailed study of this signal can also provide important clues as to the nature of the new physics .    in this paper , we suggest that a significant discrepancy between @xmath9 and @xmath10 could arise in some instances of the two higgs doublet model .",
    "indeed such a discrepancy would strongly suggest new physics that couples to the mass of the lepton . in this paper",
    "we discuss how observable signals of this sort could arise in the popular framework of minimal supergravity .",
    "the sm predicts the @xmath4 and @xmath2 branching ratio for @xmath11 to be @xcite :    [ sme ] ( ) = 6.5 10 ^ -6 [ smm ] ( ) = 6.2 10 ^ -6 [ stt ] ( ) = 4.4 10 ^ -7 so that the ratio of branching fractions , @xmath12 , is :    [ rsm ] r_sm .",
    "|_sm ~.95    sm predicts @xmath13 1 unless it is significantly altered by new physics .",
    "thus the measurement of @xmath14 provides a signal for specific classes of new physics .",
    "supersymmetry ( susy ) is a promising candidate for new physics beyond standard model @xcite . in sm",
    ", the decay @xmath0 occurs through electroweak penguins and box diagrams .",
    "susy introduces several additional classes of contributions showing in :    1 .",

    ", we focus on the penguin contributions to @xmath0 mediated by neutral higgs bosons . at the one - loop level , couplings of the `` up - type '' higgs field @xmath15 to down - type quarks@xcite are induced .",
    "this coupling gives a new contribution to the down type fermion mass matrix , and induces flavor violating couplings of neutral higgs bosons . this induced flavor violating coupling increases with tan@xmath1 .",

    ", we would like to emphasize the contributions mediated by neutral higgs exchange .",
    "as we shall see , the ratio @xmath14 is particularly sensitive to new physics which contributes through this kind of mechanism , because other contributions which couple to @xmath17 and @xmath18 equally contribute to both the numerator and denominator of eq.[rsm ] , therefore giving little contributions to r.    higgs mediated susy contributions to the amplitude increase with lepton mass @xmath19 .",
    "therefore such contributions to @xmath4 are negligible while , given a sufficient large tan@xmath1 , the contribution to @xmath2 may be comparable to the sm and so observable deviations of @xmath14 from @xmath12 are possible .",

    "in particular observably large contributions to the branching fraction of @xmath2 are possible when tan@xmath139 . in particular there can be leading a large discrepancy between the @xmath2 and @xmath4 branching ratios .",

    "thus , the most promising signal of the new physics considered in this paper is a deviation in the value of @xmath14 from its sm value .",
    "conversely , if such a deviation in @xmath14 were observed it would strongly indicate new physics coupling to mass through the higgs sector as in the case of msugra model considered in this paper .",
