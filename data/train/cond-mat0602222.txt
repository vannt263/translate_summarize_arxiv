    "defects and singularities of the director field in two dimensional ( 2d ) ordered molecular systems with in - plane orientational order cause fascinating textures , easily visible by means of polarized - light microscopy . in this paper",
    "we report a detailed experimental and theoretical study of a set of simple textural transformations in a system formed by blowing smoke over a thin free standing film of chiral smectic c ( smc * ) liquid crystal .",
    "sub - micron smoke particles nucleate islands , circular regions of added smectic layers , which grow to a certain equilibrium size , with the smoke particle as a point disclination at the center of the island .",
    "the island maintains azimuthal symmetry during growth , initially with the c - director field , a unit vector @xmath0 , defined by the projection of the tilted long molecular axis onto the layer , tangentially oriented .",
    "we find that this initially stable pure bend texture can transform to two other equilibrium spiral splay - bend textures , either as the islands grow , or when they are momentarily perturbed by external forces .",
    "to understand these transformations among stable or metastable textures , we develop a linear stability analysis for this general class of textures , which predicts a state diagram , as a function of island radius , that agrees well with our observations .    important precursors to this work include an initial report of these phenomena@xcite , the report of a reversing spiral texture first discovered in domains at the air / water interface when the smc * film is both polar and chiral@xcite , and study of the boojum , a point disclination occurring at the edge of a circular domain@xcite . the theoretical analysis of the stability of textures around topological defects has been investigated for langmuir monolayers with a tilted phase and for free standing sm c films@xcite .",
    "especially important , k. k. loh _ et al._@xcite pointed out that there can be more than one stable or metastable texture for a point defect centered in a circular domain , and described the reversing spiral texture of a circular domain in a chiral system , which can be energetically stable or metastable .",
    "the remarkable growth of islands to an equilibrium size , once they are nucleated , is a consequence of their chirality and their resulting polar ( ferroelectric ) symmetry.@xcite",
    "samples are prepared by drawing a small amount of smectic c * liquid crystal material across a 6 mm diameter hole in a thin metal sheet . materials were prepared from the cs series of mixtures available from chisso co. typical films as drawn were on the order of 10 smectic layers thick.@xcite to create islands , smoke from burning paper was wafted across the film . watching the sample using a polarizing microscope with crossed polarizers , one could observe the growth of islands nucleated by some of the smoke particles .",
    "the islands were brighter than the very dark background film , their brightness being proportional to their thickness .",
    "once nucleated , islands grew in area but not in thickness .",
    "as the islands grew , one could observe their internal texture due to their birefringence .",
    "although sometimes the smoke particle was the center of a point defect at the periphery of the island , a so - called boojum , most often the sub - visible smoke particle was centered in the island as a + 1 point disclination , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : bend ] .",
    "there are four possible textures for the intensity pattern shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : bend ] . for a smc * film of thickness @xmath1 with angle @xmath2 between @xmath0 and either of the polarizers , with crossed polarizers , the intensity of transmitted light is @xmath3 where @xmath4 is a wavelength of the incident light and @xmath5 is a birefringence for light propagating normal to the film .",
    "director configurations , tangential ( clockwise or counterclockwise ) or radial ( outward or inward).,width=192 ]    we neglect the effects of the twist of @xmath0 through the film thickness , since the islands are thin compared to the helical pitch of the spontaneous twist produced by molecular chirality .",
    "the helical pitch in the materials studied was in the range of 3 to 15 micrometers , while the islands were in the range of thickness of 0.06 to 0.15 micrometers.@xcite if the @xmath0 director is parallel to either of the polarizers , @xmath6 or @xmath7 , then @xmath8 . at @xmath9 , @xmath10",
    ", @xmath11 is a maximum in eq .",
    "( [ transmittedi ] ) .",
    "hence , the four orientations of @xmath0 indicated in fig .",
    "[ fig : bend ] are possible .    .",
    "the texture is tangential counterclockwise.,width=288 ]    to distinguish among these cases , the lower edge of the sample holder is lifted producing a small tilt with respect to the microscope stage .",
    "after the floating islands move to the edge of the film due to gravity , their appearance changes to that shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : tilt ] .",
    "the increased intensity on the right half of the islands indicates that their c - director texture is tangential counterclockwise , since in that case , the added tilt increases the molecular tilt , relative to the propagation direction of the light , and thus the apparent birefringence , on the right , and decreases it on the left of the center .",
    "all the + 1 central defect islands , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : bend ] , have this `` pure bend '' texture throughout the island .        to explore the stability of pure bend islands , which are apparently at equilibrium , we blew on the film with a small jet of gas .",
    "the resulting swirling often induced two kinds of distinct changes from a pure bend texture . in all cases",
    "the boundary condition at the outer edge of the island remained tangential counterclockwise .",
    "however , the boundary condition at the smoke particle at the core of the point defect would ( a ) sometimes change from tangential to approximately radial , or ( b ) remain tangential .",
    "right after blowing , there was often a very tightly wound spiral in the texture , which slowly relaxed to equilibrium , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : simple ] . over the course of minutes , as the c - director relaxes , in case ( a ) this texture equilibrates to a final state with roughly @xmath12 rotation from radial at the core to tangential at the outer boundary ( bottom of fig .",
    "[ fig : simple](a ) ) .",
    "we call this spiral texture a `` simple spiral '' .",
    "we have observed the simple spirals with radial inward or outward boundary conditions at the core , and right or left handed spirals .",
    "neither the sense of the spiral nor the sign of the radial boundary condition is meaningful , since observing the sample from the other side would clearly reverse both these characteristics .",
    "there is a size - dependence in this textural transformation ; pure bend islands of a small size are hardly ever transformed into simple spirals .",
    "this indicates that there is only a small interaction energy between the molecular orientation and the smoke particle , since the pure bend texture is being stabilized by the torque transmitted from the outer island boundary to the defect core .",
    "however the other spiral texture resulting from blowing , case ( b ) , which maintains its tangential boundary condition at the core , which we call a reversing spiral , goes back to the pure bend texture , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : simple](b ) , when it started from an apparently stable pure bend texture .    remarkably , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : reversing ] , as a stable pure bend island grows , at some critical size the c - director texture spontaneously starts to evolve into a reversing spiral .",
    "this transition is driven by a competition between the bend and splay elastic energies .",
    "if the splay elastic constant is less than the bend constant , this enables the transformation from a pure bend texture to a reversing spiral in a large enough island .",
    "the time it takes to reach equilibrium depends on the thickness of the island .",
    "the thinner the island , the less time .",
    "it took 30 minutes for the pure bend island in fig .",
    "[ fig : reversing ] to reach equilibrium .",
    "to explore the stability of the texture in the islands , we employ linear stability analysis . to find the equilibrium configuration of @xmath0 in the islands",
    ", we should minimize the following free energy consisting of an integral of the elastic energy density over the area of the island , and the edge energy at the sample boundaries .",

    "( [ eq : surface ] ) arise from a spontaneous splay(@xmath26 ) and a spontaneous bend(@xmath27 ) respectively .",
    "however in a free - standing film , which is physically the same when viewed from the top or bottom , no spontaneous splay of @xmath0 is possible ; for films floating on a liquid this term is allowed @xcite by the polar symmetry of the sample .",
    "so @xmath28 must vanish .",
    "@xmath29 arises directly from the spontaneous bending ( in our case , left turning ) produced by the molecular chirality in the smc * , and it is directly responsible for the minimum energy textures having a counterclockwise tangential boundary condition at the outer edge of all the islands we observed .",
    "we include in @xmath18 only the lowest terms for the line energy , @xmath30    for the islands we have created by a heterogeneous nucleation with a strong anchoring tangential boundary condition at @xmath31 ( outer radius of island ) and a weak anchoring boundary at @xmath32 ( radius of the particle at the center ) , the line energy is @xmath33 the first term on the right side is the line energy for the outer boundary and the second is for the inner boundary .",

    "first our basic observations confirm the fact that the chirality of the smectic c * phase induces a preferred bend curvature in the plane of the smectic layers , leading in the case of the materials we studies , to a general left turning bend texture as their ground state .",
    "second , using an elastic model in which the difference of elastic constants , @xmath104 , provides a driving force , and the anchoring of the c - director at the core of the central disclination is weak , we construct a plausible state diagram that agrees with our observations .",
    "the circular geometry of the island , combined with the strong tangential anchoring of the c - director at its outer boundary , demand a curved texture , which makes the difference between the splay and bend curvature elastic constants crucial .",

    "a continuous frederiks transition occurs , in which the director rotates toward the external field direction . here , that effective field direction is radial , converting bend into splay , and lowering the energy .",
    "in studying different materials , using the textural transformation from pure bend to reversing spiral as a diagnostic , we saw a strong correlation between the spontaneous electrical polarization of the ferroelectric phase and the apparent difference between the bend and splay elastic constants ; high polarization materials matched our model of a material with a high bend elastic constant .",
    "this result correlates well with the fact that bend curvature of the c - director produces divergence of the spontaneous polarization , resulting in space charges which interact to increase the free energy of the bent state . in low frequency , or quasi - static , conditions ,",
    "the resulting space charge is partially screened by free charges in the material , reducing the otherwise long range electrostatic interactions to an effective local contribution to the free energy , which can be expressed as an increase in the effective bend elastic constant.@xcite the fact that our state diagram and the textures we calculate from the elastic model agree well with our observations leads us to hypothesize that we have successfully approximated the electrostatic interactions and energy by using a large bend elastic constant @xmath15 to account for the behavior of high polarization materials .",
    "the high value of @xmath15 pushes the critical island size for the appearance of the reversing spiral to very small values , as one would expect qualitatively , and as we do observe for high polarization materials . to explore this hypothesis",
    "further , we made independent studies of the elastic constants and the interactions of bend distortions with free charges in free standing smc * films , comparing high frequency and quasi - static behavior . to accomplish this , we performed light scattering experiments on c - director fluctuation dynamics , with electric field quenching of fluctuations , with analysis including both bend - induced polarization charge and conduction charge screening .",
