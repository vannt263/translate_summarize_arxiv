    "the internal structures of the large - scale solar convections have recently been revealed in detail by helioseismic observations .",
    "robust observational profile is obtained for differential rotation with a pole - equator difference of about @xmath0 of the rotation rate of the radiative zone @xcite . as for meridional circulation , however , the only robust observation is a poleward flow at the surface with the flow speed of @xmath1 @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "although it is believed that the equatorward return flow exists inside the convection zone to meet the mass conservation , the exact depth of the return flow has been largely unknown .",
    "recently , @xcite reported detecting the equatorward flow in the middle depth of the convection zone , between @xmath3 and @xmath4 , and poleward flow again below @xmath3 , where @xmath5 is the solar radius .",
    "this observation suggests the double - cell structure of the solar meridional circulation with the counterclockwise circulation cell in the upper convection zone ( poleward near the surface ) and the clockwise circulation cell in the lower layer ( poleward near the base ) .",
    "moreover , @xcite used other helioseismic measurements and also detected the evidence that the latitudinal flow changes its direction at several depths of the solar convection zone , supporting @xcite s finding that the meridional flow consists of radially distinct circulation cells . however , poleward meridional flow near the base of the convection zone of this double - cell type circulation structure is problematic for the conventional flux - transport dynamo model @xcite because , in this model , the observed equatorward migration of sunspot groups is mainly attributed to the equatorward transport of toroidal magnetic fluxes by the meridional flow at the base of the convection zone where convective stable layer can detain magnetically buoyant toroidal fluxes from rising upward for long periods of time @xcite .",
    "although the reliability of these local helioseismic measurements in the deeper convection zone is controversial and , in fact , there exists a contradictory observation which suggests the single - cell meridional circulation structure @xcite , theoretical investigation on the double - cell type meridional circulation should be regarded as of great importance as a first step to reconsider the validity of the conventional flux - transport dynamo model .    in this paper , therefore , we discuss the possibility of the double - cell meridional circulation in the framework of the mean - field theory . in a mean - field model ,",
    "the effect of the angular momentum transport by the non - diffusive part of the reynolds stress , commonly known as the turbulent angular momentum transport or the @xmath6-effect ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , is parameterized so that the differential rotation and meridional circulation are calculated self - consistently .",
    "in fact , the parameterization of the @xmath6-effect contains some uncertainties . in most of the previous mean - field simulations",
    "whose main interests focus on the taylor - proudman balance of the differential rotation @xcite , the turbulent angular momentum fluxes are set nearly equatorward just in order to accelerate the equatorial region and to obtain the solar - like differential rotation .",
    "although it is shown in these previous papers that the meridional circulation is very sensitive to the parameterization of the @xmath6-effect , the relation between the @xmath6-effect and the structure of the meridional circulation has not yet been investigated in detail .",
    "recently , @xcite studied the latitudinal dependence of the radial component of the turbulent angular momentum flux and produced the triple - cell meridional circulation in the mean - field framework .",
    "however , the double - cell structure as suggested by @xcite was not reproduced and therefore the condition of the reynolds stress for obtaining the double - cell meridional circulation is still unclear .",
    "the relationship between the meridional flow profile and the azimuthal components of the reynolds stress is described in terms of the so - called `` gyroscopic pumping '' @xcite , which has been commonly used for explaining the formation mechanism of the solar near - surface shear layer @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we first apply the equation of gyroscopic pumping for the double - cell meridional circulation and derive the condition of the reynolds stress needed for obtaining the double - cell structure . in general , however , it is not obvious whether the @xmath6-effect which reflects such a condition of the reynolds stress can drive both the double - cell meridional circulation and the solar - like differential rotation at the same time , since the differential rotation and meridional circulation are hydrodynamically balanced with each other .",
    "we therefore conduct a set of mean - field hydrodynamic simulations to see whether or not the double - cell meridional circulation is hydrodynamically compatible with the solar - like differential rotation .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows . in section [ sec : two ]",
    ", the condition of the reynolds stress which is necessary for the double - cell meridional circulation is derived by considering the equation of gyroscopic pumping . in section [ sec : three ] , our mean - field model is explained .",
    "the @xmath6-effect is specified in section [ subsec : lambda - modeling ] . in section [ sec : four ] , we show the results of our mean - field simulations .",
    "reference solution is presented in section [ subsec : drmc ] to confirm that the double - cell meridional circulation can be achieved along with the solar - like differential rotation .",
    "the influence on the taylor - proudman balance is addressed in section [ subsec : tpbalance ] .",
    "we further discuss the angular momentum balance in section [ sec : refgyro ] where the maintenance mechanism of the double - cell meridional circulation is explained . in section [ sec : validity ] , we discuss the validity of our parameterization of the @xmath6-effect . finally , we conclude in section [ sec : summary ] .",
    "in this section , we briefly discuss a qualitative condition of the reynolds stress for driving a double - cell meridional circulation . using a spherical geometry @xmath7 , the velocity field @xmath8",
    "is written as , @xmath9 where @xmath10 denotes zonal averaging . @xmath11 and",
    "@xmath12 express the mean velocity and the turbulence respectively , and @xmath13 denotes the total angular velocity .",
    "the mean @xmath11 represents the large - scale flows such as meridional circulation @xmath14 and differential rotation @xmath15 .",

    "@xmath18 denotes the time - independent background density and @xmath19 denotes the mean angular momentum density per unit mass .",
    "equation ( [ eq : gyro1 ] ) describes that , in a stationary state , the angular momentum advected by the meridional flow balances with the angular momentum transported by @xmath20 components of the reynolds stress . since",
    ", in general , @xmath21 is directed almost cylindrically outward with respect to the rotational axis within the convection zone , it would be constructive to introduce a new coordinate @xmath22 denoting the momentum arm .",
    "equation ( [ eq : gyro1 ] ) then reduces to , @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the cylindrically outward velocity .",
    ".signs of each of the quantities in eq.([eq : gyro2 ] ) [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     for double - cell type meridional circulation suggested by @xcite , @xmath24 becomes negative both near the surface and the base of the convection zone where the meridional flow is directed poleward , whereas @xmath24 takes positive value in the middle layer due to the equatorward return flow .",
    "since @xmath25 is generaly almost uniformly positive , the left hand side of the equation ( [ eq : gyro2 ] ) takes negative , positive , and negative values from lower , middle , to the upper convection zone , respectively .",
    "thus , @xmath26 must be a radially converging vector into the middle convection zone and we can specify a reynolds stress such that @xmath27 takes positive value in the lower half and becomes negative in the upper half of the convection zone as the simplest candidate which satisfies the condition above ( table [ table:1 ] ) .",
    "we can speculate , therefore , that the double - cell meridional circulation as observed might be maintained when the reynolds stress transports the angular momentum radially upward ( downward ) in the lower ( upper ) convection zone .",
    "we quantitatively confirm this speculation by conducting a set of numerical simulations using a mean - field hydrodynamic model .",
    "we solve the hydrodynamic equations for a rotating system and investigate the large - scale flow structures , differential rotation and meridional circulation , using an axisymmetric mean - field model similar to that of @xcite . in our mean - field model , all processes on the convective scale such as turbulent viscous dissipation , turbulent heat conduction , and turbulent angular momentum transport are parameterized and given explicitly in our basic equations .",
    "thus , the differential rotation and the meridional circulation are calculated self - consistently , which makes it possible for us to discuss the condition of the reynolds stress for obtaining a double - cell meridional circulation along with the solar - like differential rotation .",

    "the buoyancy force arising from this entropy perturbation almost excludes the lowermost meridional circulation cell and the double - cell structure is obtained as a result .",

    "differential rotation is finally balanced by the latitudinal entropy gradient such that the right hand side of the equation ( [ eq : vort ] ) vanishes .",

    "radially inward meridional flow of the lower clockwise cell near the equator has the advective effect of suppressing the entropy perturbation from spreading into the bulk of the convection zone , leading to weaker latitudinal entropy gradient in low to middle latitudes . in a single - cell case , in contrast",
    ", the radially outward meridional flow near the base of the convection zone can help entropy perturbation to spread upward and to produce significant latitudinal entropy gradient in this region , by which the rotation profile can largely deviates from the taylor - proudman state .",
    "it is , therefore , suggested that in our mean - field model the double - cell structure of the meridional circulation has an unfavorable effect on the realization of the non taylor - proudman differential rotation that is deduced by helioseismology compared with the single - cell case , mainly due to the advection of the entropy perturbation by the lower clockwise circulation cell near the equator .",
    "it should be noted that our mean - field model has many important parameters , in addition to the @xmath6-effect , that can also affect the results .",
    "therefore , realizing the non - cylindrical rotation profile similar to the helioseismic measurement along with the double - cell meridional circulation would not be a difficult task for our mean - field model .",
    "for example , since the amplitude of the entropy must depend on the background entropy stratification @xmath180 , decreasing the superadiabaticity below the base of the convection zone @xmath181 retrieve the non taylor - proudman rotation profile while keeping the meridional flow structure almost unchanged .",
    "however , since the aim here is to discuss the influence of the double - cell meridional circulation structure on the taylor - proudman balance by comparing with the single - cell case , we conduct our simulations with parameterizations for superadiabaticity @xmath181 , turbulent thermal diffusivity @xmath43 , and @xmath182 ( value of the diffusivities at @xmath79 ) as presented in @xcite s single - cell case .      in this section ,",
    "we discuss the dependence on the free parameter @xmath124 which specifies the magnitude ratio of the @xmath6-effect between lower and upper convection zone .",
    "larger @xmath124 corresponds to the larger effect of the upward turbulent angular momentum transport in the lower part of the convection zone with respect to the effect of the downward transport in the upper layer .",
    "when @xmath124 is changed , the amplitude of the differential rotation is directly affected .",
    "thus , @xmath107 is adjusted such that the equatorial rotation rate remains the same with the helioseismic measurement @xmath183 for all cases as shown in table [ table:2 ] .",
    "for all cases , both the solar - like differential rotation and the double - cell meridional circulation are achieved in a similar way to the reference case .",
    "figure [ fig : drparam ] shows that the general profile of differential rotation is not sensitive to the change in the parameter @xmath124 , although the magnitude of the rotation rate near the pole is marginally affected .",
    "dependence of the meridional flow is shown in figure [ fig : parameter ] .",
    "even though the amplitude of latitudinal velocity @xmath137 or the depths of the return flows are dependent on @xmath124 and @xmath107 , we can confirm the existence of poleward flow at the surface , equatorward flow in the middle layer , and poleward flow again near the base of the convection zone in all cases .",
    "this suggests that the double - cell structure is a very robust result for the meridional flow as long as the reynolds stress transports the angular momentum upward ( downward ) in the lower ( upper ) half of the convection zone .",
    "especially , figure [ fig : parameter ] shows that , in our mean - field model , this tendency is almost independent of the relative amplitude of the upward turbulent angular momentum flux in the lower convection zone so that double - cell meridional circulation suggested by @xcite can be realized even when the magnitude of the @xmath6-effect is @xmath184 times weaker in the lower convection zone compared with that in the upper convection zone .    unlike the general tendency of the double - cell structure of the meridional flow , the taylor - proudman balance of the differential rotation turns out to highly depend on the change in @xmath124 , since the flow speed near the base of the convection zone which plays a crucial role for the thermal wind balance in suppressing the entropy perturbation is sensitive to @xmath124 . in order",
    "to quantitatively discuss the taylor - proudman balance of the differential rotation , let us define a new parameter @xmath145 which describes the morphology of the differential rotation ; to what extent the differential rotation deviates from the taylor - proudman state , @xmath185 the fourth column in table [ table:2 ] shows the absolute values of @xmath145 for each case .",
    "@xmath145 monotonically decreases with the increase in @xmath124 .",
    "in other words , the differential rotation becomes close to the taylor - proudman state when the relative amplitude of the turbulent angular momentum flux in the lower region increases .    according to the previous discussion in section [ subsec : tpbalance ] ,",
    "the change in the taylor - proudman balance would be attributed to the change in the meridional flow . in order to evaluate the extent of the double - cell structure quantitatively",
    ", we further introduce a new parameter @xmath146 defined by , @xmath186 where the integral is taken over the meridional plane and @xmath187 denotes the stream - function of the meridional circulation defined by , @xmath188 here , we set @xmath189 at the boundaries of our numerical domain . when @xmath146 is @xmath190 , the meridional circulation is said to be clockwise ( counterclockwise ) , whereas the double - cell meridional circulation consists of both the clockwise cell and the counterclockwise cell with the same circulation strengths when @xmath146 is zero .",
    "the values of @xmath146 for each case are shown in the fifth column of table [ table:2 ] .",
    "when @xmath124 is sufficiently small ( case 1 ) , @xmath146 takes a negative value , meaning that the meridional flow is dominated by the upper counterclockwise circulation cell , which is the direct consequence of the local angular momentum conservation within the upper half of the convection zone . on the other hand ,",
    "when the magnitude of the @xmath6-effect in the lower half of the convection zone becomes comparable with respect to the magnitude in the upper layer ( @xmath191 ) , the influence of the lower clockwise circulation cell driven by the upward turbulent angular momentum transport becomes stronger as manifested by the positive value of @xmath146 in case 3 and 4 .",
    "these results indicate that , if the upward turbulent angular momentum transport works effectively in the lower convection zone , the differential rotation becomes close to the taylor - proudman state due to the stronger suppression of the entropy perturbation near the equator by fast clockwise circulation cell in the lower convection zone .",
    "in this section , we discuss the angular momentum balance in a dynamical stationary state for the reference solution ( case 2 ) , based on the equation of gyroscopic pumping ( equation ( [ eq : gyro1 ] ) ) .",
    "note that in the stationary state the equation of continuity reduces to the anelastic condition @xmath17 .",
    "the reynolds stress on the right hand side of the equation ( [ eq : gyro1 ] ) can be divided into the non - diffusive part ( @xmath6-effect ) and the diffusive part .",
    "therefore , we have , @xmath192 \\nonumber \\\\    & & + \\nabla\\cdot\\left[\\rho_{0}r^{2}\\sin^{2}{\\theta}\\nu_{\\mathrm{v}}\\nabla\\omega_{1}\\right ] .",
    "\\label{eq : gyro3}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] figure [ fig : gyroscopic ] illustrates the angular momentum balance in the stationary state , as expressed in each term of the above equation ( [ eq : gyro3 ] ) .",
    "figure [ fig : gyroscopic](a ) shows the mean angular momentum density @xmath193 whose contour lines are parallel to the rotational axis , showing that the angular momentum distribution is almost the same with that of solid body rotation .",
    "figure [ fig : gyroscopic](b ) shows the advection of the angular momentum by the meridional circulation ( the left - hand - side term of equation ( [ eq : gyro3 ] ) ) .",
    "figure [ fig : gyroscopic](c ) shows the turbulent angular momentum transport by the non - diffusive part of the reynolds stress ( the first term on the right hand side of equation ( [ eq : gyro3 ] ) ) , which clearly manifests that the angular momentum is transported from the lower and upper convection zone to the middle layer .",
    "figure [ fig : gyroscopic](d ) shows the dissipative effect of the angular momentum due to the turbulent viscosity ( the second term on the right hand side of equation ( [ eq : gyro3 ] ) ) .    in the stationary state , the advective effect shown in figure [ fig : gyroscopic](b ) is totally balanced by a combination of the @xmath6-effect ( figure [ fig : gyroscopic](c ) ) and the turbulent diffusion ( figure [ fig : gyroscopic](d ) ) .",
    "figure [ fig : gyroscopic](c ) shows that the distribution of the angular momentum is largely changed by the @xmath6-effect especially in low to middle latitudes where the momentum arm @xmath22 is relatively large .",
    "figure [ fig : gyroscopic](d ) , on the other hand , states that the turbulent diffusion also works effectively in this low to middle latitudinal region where the multiplication of @xmath194 becomes dominant , and consequently , the tachocline in low latitudes becomes highly subject to the turbulent diffusion .",
    "this means that the turbulent diffusion plays an important role in suppressing the @xmath6-effect , leading to a significant amount of cancellation between figure [ fig : gyroscopic](c ) and [ fig : gyroscopic](d ) . as a result",
    ", we can confirm that there exists a qualitative correspondence between the angular momentum advected by the meridional flow ( figure [ fig : gyroscopic](b ) ) and the angular momentum transport by the @xmath6-effect ( figure [ fig : gyroscopic](c ) ) .",
    "this manifests that the structure of the meridional circulation might be almost determined by the @xmath6-effect such that the advection by the meridional flow can balance with the angular momentum transported by the @xmath6-effect which is partially suppressed by the turbulent diffusion .",
    "comparison between figure [ fig : gyroscopic](b ) and [ fig : gyroscopic](c ) further shows that the accumulated angular momentum in the middle convection zone due to the @xmath6-effect is redistributed to both lower and upper layers of the convection zone by the lower and upper circulation cells , respectively .",
    "in our mean - field model , the @xmath6-effect , which drives the whole large - scale dynamics , is given by a simple consideration of the equation of gyroscopic pumping ( equation ( [ eq : gyro2 ] ) ) in an ad - hoc manner ( subsection [ subsec : lambda - modeling ] ) . in this section ,",
    "we briefly discuss the validity of our parameterization of the @xmath6-effect and consider to what extent our model is applicable to the solar convection zone . here",
    ", we should note that our parameterization of the @xmath6-effect might not be an unique solution for the double - cell type meridional circulation .",
    "we do not aim to discuss the general properties of all the possible @xmath6-effect in this section but rather focus only on the parameterization of our reference case as an example , from which we can still derive some basic suggestions on the solar meridional circulation structure .",
    "figure [ fig : correlation ] shows the values of @xmath195 and @xmath196 in the stationary state for the reference solution ( case 2 ) calculated by , @xmath197 which largely reflect our parameterization of the @xmath6-effect .",
    "positive ( negative ) @xmath195 in the lower ( upper ) convection zone expresses that the reynolds stress transports the angular momentum upward ( downward ) in the lower ( upper ) layer whereas the positive @xmath196 in the bulk of the convection zone describes the equatorward angular momentum transport .",
    "it is concluded , from the discussion in section [ sec : two ] , that the positive ( negative ) @xmath195 in the lower ( upper ) convection zone is crucial for driving the double - cell type meridional circulation .",
    "dominant positive @xmath196 , on the other hand , is needed to accelerate the equatorial region and to obtain the solar - like differential rotation . in this section",
    ", we consider that @xmath195 and @xmath196 represent the correlations of the small - scale turbulent flows which can not be resolved in this mean - field model .",
    "the aim of the following discussion is , therefore , to present possible physical processes which can produce the turbulent correlations described above in a qualitative way and consider if these physical processes exist in the solar convection zone .",
    "let us first consider the positive @xmath196 which is mostly confined outside the tangential cylinder ( figure [ fig : correlation](b ) ) .",
    "it is widely believed that convective columns , known as `` banana cells '' that are mostly aligned with the rotational axis extending across the equator , dominate the convective structure in this region under the strong influence of rotation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "these banana cells have been repeatedly revealed by 3d full spherical simulations as a coherent north - south alignment of penetrative downflow lanes @xcite . as a result , there appears a coherent azimuthal velocity field towards these downflow lanes in the outer layer of the banana cells .",
    "it is expected that the positive correlation @xmath196 is established by the coriolis forces acting on the azimuthal velocity directing the downflow lanes : the prograde ( retrograde ) azimuthal flow @xmath198 is bent equatorward ( poleward ) to obtain a positive ( negative ) latitudinal component , leading to @xmath199 .",
    "next , negative @xmath195 in the upper convection zone ( @xmath200 ) is considered ( figure [ fig : correlation](a)).in this upper region , the effect of the coriolis force becomes small and the convectional structure is mostly dominated by the radial motions of the thermal convection .",
    "negative @xmath195 can be explained by the coriolis forces acting on these radial flows : the coriolis force deflects downflows ( @xmath201 ) in a prograde way ( @xmath202 ) , inducing @xmath203 .",
    "in fact , the inward angular momentum transport driven by this negative @xmath195 is considered as one of the main formation mechanisms of the solar near surface shear layer @xcite , which exists above @xmath204 @xcite . in order to evaluate to what extent the generation process of this negative @xmath195 can prevail in the deeper convection zone",
    ", it is necessary to investigate the depth @xmath205 exceeds the unity and the influence of the coriolis force becomes weak . in @xcite s",
    "recent high - resolution calculations of the solar global convection in which the near surface shear layer is produced above @xmath206 , the rossby - unity line is located about @xmath207 .",
    "the profile of @xmath205 presented in their paper may be different from the solar profile because the luminosity is artificially reduced in order to decrease @xmath205 and to obtain a solar - like differential rotation profile , in their simulations the negative @xmath195 is not confined to the near surface shear layer but extends down to the middle convection zone @xmath208 .",
    "therefore , it is likely that the negative @xmath195 prevails in the upper half of the convection zone , not being confined only to the top surface , as presented in figure [ fig : correlation](a ) .",
    "finally , positive @xmath195 in the lower convection zone is considered ( figure [ fig : correlation](a ) ) .",
    "we should note at first that the amplitude of the positive @xmath195 in the lower convection zone is about three times smaller than the positive one in the upper convection zone in our reference case , and also that it can be even smaller as in case 1 .",
    "apart from the amplitude , it is confirmed that positive @xmath195 is mainly confined inside the tangential cylinder in middle to high latitudes .",
    "although the positive @xmath195 outside the tangential cylinder can be explained by the rotation - induced prograde inclination of the banana - cell structure @xcite , the turbulent correlations inside the tangential cylinder can not be attributed to the properties of the banana cells .",
    "in fact , it is unclear what kind of physical process can generate the positive @xmath195 in the lower convection zone in high latitudinal region . yet",
    ", our results might suggest that the realization of the double - cell meridional circulation as suggested by @xcite needs the upward transport of the angular momentum by the reynolds stress even inside the tangential cylinder where the positive turbulent correlation @xmath195 should be explained by some other physical processes but the rotation - induced banana - cell structure .",
    "we have investigated the condition of the reynolds stress needed for maintaining the double - cell meridional circulation which has recently been revealed by helioseismology @xcite .",
    "we further examined whether or not the double - cell structure of the meridional circulation can coexist with the solar - like differential rotation in the mean - field framework .",
    "this work is significant because the discovery of the double - cell meridional circulation by @xcite is one of the most controversial issues on the solar flux - transport dynamo model @xcite yet no one investigated whether or not it is a possible structure from a hydrodynamical perspective .",
    "our work can be used as a base for further research on the validity of the conventional flux - transport dynamo model .",
    "first , we consider the angular momentum balance for a stationary large scale flows in the solar convection zone , known as gyroscopic pumping @xcite and apply it to the double - cell type meridional flow to derive the properties of the reynolds stress necessary for driving the double - cell flow structure in a qualitative way . as a result ,",
    "positive ( nagative ) @xmath195 in the lower ( upper ) convection zone turns out to be indispensable for the double - cell type meridional flow . in other words ,",
    "the reynolds stress must transport the angular momentum radially upward ( downward ) in the lower ( upper ) half of the convection zone .",
    "since it is not so obvious whether the reynolds stress can drive at the same time both the solar - like differential rotation and the double - cell type meridional circulation that are in a complicated hydrodynamical balance @xcite , we then conduct a set of mean - field simulations where the @xmath6-effect @xcite is given explicitly such that it reflects the condition of the reynolds stress described above . as a consequence",
    ", it is confirmed that the double - cell structure of the meridional circulation is hydrodynamically compatible with the solar - like differential rotation as shown in figure [ fig : dr ] and figure [ fig : mc ] .",
    "we further conduct a parameter survey on the relative magnitude of the @xmath6-effect in the lower part of the convection zone with respect to that in the upper part .",
    "regardless of the amplitude ratio of the upward and downward turbulent angular momentum flux , the double - cell meridional circulation is obtained in all cases along with the solar - like differential rotation , suggesting that just a small fraction of positive turbulent correlation @xmath195 in the lower convection zone ( @xmath209 with respect to the upper layer ) is sufficient for attaining the double - cell meridional flow structure .",
    "it is also found that the taylor - proudman balance of the differential rotation is mainly influenced by the meridional flow structure . in the double - cell case ,",
    "the profile of the differential rotation becomes close to the taylor - proudman state compared with the single - cell case @xcite .",
    "it is finally concluded from the results of our parameter survey that the radially inward meridional flow near the equator of the lower clockwise circulation cell suppresses the entropy perturbation generated at the subadiabatic tachocline from spreading out into the convection zone , and therefore , the effect of the thermal wind driven by the latitudinal entropy gradient decreases in our double - cell case .",
    "next , we again consider the angular momentum balance in a stationary state by evaluating the effects of each term of the equation of gyroscopic pumping ( equation ( [ eq : gyro3 ] ) ) using our simulational results .",
    "it is found that the @xmath6-effect ( the first term of the right hand side of the equation ( [ eq : gyro3 ] ) ) is almost balanced by the advective effect of the angular momentum by the meridional flow ( the left hand side of the equation ( [ eq : gyro3 ] ) ) as shown in figure [ fig : gyroscopic](b ) and [ fig : gyroscopic](c ) .",
    "therefore , the structure of the meridional circulation turns out to be mainly determined by the parameterization of the @xmath6-effect in our model .",
    "the condition of the reynolds stress that we derived in section [ sec : two ] can relate with the maintenance mechanism of the double - cell meridional circulation as follows : when the reynolds stress distributes the angular momentum from the lower and upper parts of the convection zone to the middle layer , the meridional flow is driven such that it advects the accumulated angular momentum in the middle convection zone to the upper and lower layers by two radially distinct circulation cells , respectively .",
    "finally , the validity of our parameterization of the @xmath6-effect , which has some physical uncertainties in our mean - field framework , is addressed .",
    "the negative @xmath195 is likely to be generated by the coriolis forces acting on radial flows in the upper part of the convection zone where @xmath205 is relatively large . on the other hand",
    ", it is generally expected that the positive @xmath195 , which is crucial for driving the clockwise circulation cell in the lower part of the convection zone , is due to the rotation - induced banana cell structure in the low @xmath205 regime .",
    "however , it is found that the positive @xmath195 in the lower convection zone is mostly located inside the tangential cylinder in middle to high latitudes where the banana cells may not exist .",
    "although it is unclear how this turbulent correlation can be produced , our study suggests that the double - cell type meridional flow needs the upward angular momentum transport even inside the tangential cylinder .",
    "the uncertainties on the small - scale convectional structure or the distribution of the turbulent correlations in this region are expected to be resolved using high - resolution global spherical simulations .",
    "our future work will focus on the effect of the magnetic field on the large - scale flow structures that is not considered in this paper .",
    "several investigations have been conducted on the feedback of the lorentz force on differential rotation and the single - cell meridional flow in the mean - field framework but not for the double - cell meridional flow .",
    "@xcite found that the meridional flow structure shows a deflection from the magnetized region and also that a meridional flow with an amplitude of less than @xmath170 can not transport a magnetic field with a strength of @xmath210 due to the magnetic tension force .",
    "it is , therefore , expected that our lower clockwise cell whose amplitude is about @xmath170 might be highly affected by the existence of toroidal magnetic fluxes near the base of the convection zone that can be generated by differential rotation through the @xmath13-effect .",
    "moreover , the dynamical behavior of the large - scale magnetic field is also expected to depend upon the meridional flow structure .",
    "since all of the previous studies on the flux - transport dynamo based on the double - cell meridional circulation were carried out in a purely kinematic regime @xcite , our study on the non - kinematic flux - transport dynamo with the double - cell meridional circulation will contribute to the reconsideration of the conventional flux - transport dynamo model in a more realistic regime .",
