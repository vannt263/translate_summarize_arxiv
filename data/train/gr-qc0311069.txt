    "space - based interferometric gravitational wave detectors operate according to the same general principles , but differ in their implementation .",
    "ground - based detectors , such as the laser interferometer gravitational wave observatory ( ligo )  @xcite , operate in the low frequency limit , where the wavelength of the gravitational waves is considerably larger than the size of the detector , and most sources are only in - band for a fraction of a second .",
    "these considerations simplify the description of the detector response , which may be well approximated by a quadrupole antenna moving at constant velocity with respect to the gravitational wave source .",
    "however , ground - based interferometers employ quasi - fixed rather than freely moving test masses , and the output of the detector is given by the response of the control loop used to keep the interferometer on a dark fringe .",
    "this complicates forward modeling efforts for ground - based detectors  @xcite as it makes the detector response non - linear .",
    "the situation with space - borne detectors is completely the opposite .",
    "space - based detectors , such as the proposed laser interferometer space antenna ( lisa )  @xcite , will be able to detect gravitational waves with wavelengths that range from many times larger than the interferometer to many times smaller , and most sources will be in - band for months or years , so that the detector s orbital motion will impart amplitude , frequency , and phase modulations .",
    "these effects give rise to a complicated , time dependent detector response function  @xcite .",
    "space - borne detectors typically have large arm - lengths ( @xmath0 m for lisa ) that vary with time , which prevents them from operating as traditional interferometers . instead ,",
    "the interferometer signals are produce in software from phase differences measured in the detector using a procedure know as time delay interferometry ( tdi )  @xcite . despite these complications ,",
    "the detector response remains linear , which greatly simplifies forward modeling efforts .",
    "forward modeling plays a key role in the design of any new scientific instrument , and is especially important when the instrument is the first of its kind .",
    "work is now underway to produce an end - to - end model of the lisa observatory  @xcite .",
    "key ingredients include accurate modeling of the spacecraft orbits and photon trajectories ( this includes the effects of gravitational waves ) , realistic simulations of the time delay interferometry used to cancel laser phase noise , and experimental characterization of the various noise contributions .",
    "a good end - to - end model can help to make design trade - offs , and to avoid costly mistakes .",
    "forward modeling can also be used to develop and test data analysis strategies .",
    "while we focus our attention on lisa , our forward model can be used to study other proposals for space - borne gravitational wave detectors , such as the big bang observatory  @xcite .",
    "work on various elements of the lisa end - to - end model have been under development for some time .",
    "modeling of the detector response has its roots in the doppler tracking of spacecraft  @xcite .",
    "results were initially derived for a static array with equal arm - lengths  @xcite . following the discovery of time delay interferometry  @xcite ,",
    "these results were extended to a static array with unequal arm - lengths  @xcite .",
    "the orbital motion of the array was first incorporated in the low frequency limit  @xcite , and later extended to the full detector response  @xcite . with the full response function in hand",
    ", we have developed an open source software package called _ the lisa simulator _  @xcite that takes as its input an arbitrary gravitational wave and returns as its output the simulated response of the lisa observatory .",
    "the main purpose of _ the lisa simulator _ is to aid in the development of data analysis tools  @xcite , but its modular design allows it to be extended into a full end - to - end model .",
    "for example , the static modeling  @xcite of the tdi implementation could be incorporated into _ the lisa simulator _",
    ", as could more realistic spacecraft orbits and experimentally determined noise spectra .",
    "the value of a realistic end - to - end model has already become apparent with the discovery of flaws in the initial tdi scheme caused by the rotation of the array  @xcite , time dependence of the arm - lengths  @xcite , and problems with clock synchronization in a moving array  @xcite .",
    "these difficulties require modification of the tdi variables  @xcite and/or changes in the mission design .",
    "on the other hand , a highly realistic end - to - end simulation necessarily consumes a great deal of computer resources , and delivers a fidelity that exceeds the requirements of many data analysis efforts . indeed ,",
    "when searching a large parameter space , fidelity must be sacrificed in favor of speed . to this end",
    "we have developed an approximation to the full lisa response that extends the low frequency approximation by two decades .",
    "the motion of the array is stroboscopically rendered into a sequence of stationary states , yielding an adiabatic approximation to the full response .",
    "the adiabatic approximation allows us to write down a simple analytic expression for the response function in a mixed time / frequency representation . for sources with a few dominant harmonics , such as low eccentricity , low spin binary systems at second post - newtonian oder",
    ", the adiabatic approximation provides a fast and accurate method for calculating the lisa response .",

    "we work in natural units with @xmath1 , but report all frequencies in hertz .",
    "the current design of the lisa mission calls for three identical spacecraft flying in an equilateral triangular formation about the sun .",
    "the center of mass for the constellation , known as the guiding center , is in a circular orbit at 1 au and @xmath2 behind the earth .",
    "in addition to the guiding center motion , the formation will cartwheel in a retrograde motion with a one year period ( see fig .",
    "[ lisa ] ) .",
    "the detector motion introduces amplitude ( am ) , frequency ( fm ) , and phase modulations ( pm ) into the gravitational wave signals @xcite .",
    "the amplitude modulation is caused by the antenna pattern being swept across the sky .",
    "the phase modulation occurs when the differing responses to the two gravitational wave polarizations are combined together .",
    "the frequency ( doppler ) modulation is due to the motion of the detector relative to the source .",
    "since both the orbital and cartwheel motion have a period of one year , these modulations will show up as sidebands in the power spectrum separated from the instantaneous carrier frequency by integer values of the modulation frequency , @xmath3yr .    to describe the coordinates of the detector we work in a heliocentric , ecliptic coordinate system . in this system the sun is placed at the origin , the @xmath4-axis points in the direction of the vernal equinox , the @xmath5-axis is parallel to the orbital angular momentum vector of the earth , and the @xmath6-axis is placed in the ecliptic to complete the right handed coordinate system . ignoring the influence from other solar system bodies",
    ", the individual lisa spacecraft will follow independent keplerian orbits .",

    "the orientation of the principle directions is chosen such that there is a @xmath31 phase delay between the two polarization states .",
    "the connection between the two basis sets is a rotation by the principle polarization angle @xmath23 about the shared propagation direction @xmath19 .",
    "we model the gravitational waves from a binary system according to @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the orbital phase .",
    "the instantaneous frequency of the @xmath34 gravitational wave harmonic is given by @xmath35 unless the binary is highly eccentric or highly relativistic , the dominant emission will be quadrupolar , with frequency @xmath36 , and will be well described by the restricted post - newtonian approximation : @xmath37 here @xmath38 is the chirp mass , @xmath39 is the luminosity distance and @xmath40 is the inclination of the binary to the line of sight .",
    "higher post - newtonian corrections , eccentricity of the orbit , and spin effects will introduce additional harmonics .",
    "for two spatially separated test particles in free fall , the effect of a passing gravitational wave is to cause the proper distance between the masses to vary as a function of time .",
    "finding the detector response reduces to solving for the appropriate timelike and null geodesics in the spacetime with the metric @xmath41 in the above equation @xmath42 denotes the newtonian potential set up by various bodies in the solar system and @xmath43 denotes the time - varying metric perturbation due to gravitational waves described in the previous section .",
    "the relevant geodesics are those of the two spacecraft , @xmath44 , @xmath45 , and the photons sent from spacecraft 1 to 2 , @xmath46 .",
    "we need to find the path taken by the photon that leaves spacecraft 1 at time @xmath47 and arrives at spacecraft 2 at time @xmath48 , which amounts to a classic pursuit problem in curved spacetime .",
    "the calculation must take into account a host of factors , some due to the newtonian potential , and some due to the gravitational wave . during the time taken",
    "for the photon to travel between the spacecraft , both effects are small and can be treated independently .",
    "the newtonian potential leads to a variety of effects , such as a shapiro time delay @xmath49 , gravitational redshift @xmath50 , deflection of light @xmath51 , and tidal flexing @xmath52 .",
    "each of these effects is considerably larger than any of the effects caused by the passage of the gravitational wave , and they have to be subtracted before the gravitational wave data analysis begins .",
    "the first step in the subtraction relies on us being able to accurately model the orbital phase shifts using the solar system ephemeris .",
    "the second step in the subtraction employs a high pass filter to remove the residuals from the orbital fit , which occur at harmonics of the modulation frequency @xmath53 hz .",
    "the orbital effects , and the procedure for their removal , should be included in the full end - to - end model , even though they do not directly affect the response of the detector to gravitational waves .",

    "( [ combo ] ) and solving the geodesic equation for the photons and the spacecraft in the metric perturbed by the gravitational wave .",
    "there are two equivalent approaches for finding the phase shift .",
    "the first approach is to find the doppler shift of the photon emitted by the first spacecraft and received by the second .",
    "the doppler shift is then integrated with respect to time to give the phase shift .",
    "the doppler derivation is given in appendix b. the second approach is to integrate along the photons trajectory to find the path length variation caused by the gravitational wave  @xcite .",
    "the expressions given in appendix b is valid to all orders in the spacecraft velocity @xmath55 , and to first order in the gravitational wave strain @xmath56 .",

    "whose frequency is greater than the transfer frequency the wave period is less than the light propagation time between spacecraft , which leads to a self - cancellation effect accounted for by the transfer functions . below the transfer frequency",
    "the transfer functions approach unity .",
    "this leads to a natural division of the lisa bandwidth into high and low frequency regions , which will be exploited in a later section when we approximate the response of the detector .",
    "the connection of eq .",
    "( [ dell ] ) to what is actually measured depends on the design of the gravitational wave detector .",
    "the current proposal for lisa is to have each spacecraft measure two phases differences , one for each arm .",
    "the phase difference , @xmath83 , as measured on spacecraft @xmath61 , is found by comparing the phase of the received signal from spacecraft @xmath60 against the outgoing signal s phase that is traveling back to spacecraft @xmath60 .",
    "inherent in the phase difference measurements are both the gravitational wave signal and noise contributions from laser phase noise @xmath84 , shot noise @xmath85 , and acceleration noise @xmath86 : @xmath87 here the time @xmath66 is implicitly found through @xmath88 .",
    "the subscripts on the noise components indicate the directional dependence of that component : @xmath89 is the laser phase noise introduced by the laser on spacecraft @xmath61 that is pointed toward spacecraft @xmath60 , @xmath90 is the shot noise in the photodetector on spacecraft @xmath61 that is receiving a signal from spacecraft @xmath60 , and @xmath91 is the projected acceleration noise from the accelerometer on spacecraft @xmath61 in the direction of spacecraft @xmath60 . the position noise and path length variation are converted into a phase difference by multiplying by the angular frequency of the laser , @xmath92 .",
    "once the six phase differences are measured and telemetered down , the different interferometer signals can be synthesized .",
    "for example , the michelson signal formed by using spacecraft 1 as the vertex craft is @xmath93 where @xmath94 and @xmath95 are found from @xmath96 however , due to the relatively large laser phase noise , the michelson signal will not be a viable option . instead a number of so called tdi signals will be used  @xcite .",
    "these signals are built by combining time - delayed michelson signals in such a way as to reduce the overall laser phase noise down to a level that will not overwhelm the detector s output .",

    "a coordinate free manner we are able to apply this formalism to an arbitrary space - based mission .",
    "all that has to be changed are the spacecraft orbits .",
    "it should also be emphasized that the response is calculated entirely in the time domain .",
    "in later sections we develop approximations to the full response by working in a hybrid time / frequency domain .",

    "for example , the relatively simple analytic form of the _ rigid adiabatic approximation _ is well suited to the calculation of fisher information matrices in studies of astrophysical parameter extraction . on the other hand , _ the lisa simulator _ is available if we need to simulate the response to highly relativistic gravitational wave sources such as the merger of two black holes .",
