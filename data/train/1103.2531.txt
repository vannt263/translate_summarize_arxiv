    "in this paper we explore the question of how to most efficiently separate the components of the complement of a hyperbolic multiply connected domain using closed geodesics .",
    "the study of short closed geodesics , in particular , finding a short homology basis and examining the systole , or shortest geodesic , has been extensively studied in the literature for riemann surfaces which are compact or at least of finite type @xcite . however , here we will consider exclusively plane domains which , except in rare cases , are not riemann surfaces of finite type . also , we will restrict ourselves largely to a fixed homology class . finally , our motivation for considering these questions is somewhat different as it ultimately comes from certain problems in complex dynamics .",
    "the simple closed geodesics we will obtain , and which we will refer to as _",
    "meridians _ of our domain , can be used to characterize the conformal type of the domain and give rise to give a short homology basis .",
    "they are especially useful in dealing with questions regarding convergence of sequences of pointed domains of the same connectivity with respect to the topology for pointed domains , an example being the question of in which circumstances a limit of pointed @xmath0-connected domains with respect to this topology is again @xmath0-connected .",
    "this in turn is useful for problems in complex dynamics where one needs to be able to uniformize certain fundamental domains in the correct manner , for example in giving the correct generalization of a polynomial - like mapping for a non - autonomous version of the sullivan straightening theorem e.g. @xcite .    for a hyperbolic domain @xmath1 ,",
    "denote the hyperbolic metric by @xmath2 or just @xmath3 if the domain involved is clear from the context . extending this notation slightly ,",
    "we shall use @xmath4 or @xmath5 to denote the distance in the hyperbolic metric from a point @xmath6 to a subset @xmath7 of @xmath1 . finally , for a curve @xmath8 in @xmath1 , let us denote the hyperbolic length of @xmath8 in @xmath1 by @xmath9 , or , again when the context is clear , simply by @xmath10 .    in this paper , for the sake of convenience , we shall only consider domains which are subsets of @xmath11 so that the point at infinity is in one of the components of the complement . however , since all the domains we consider will be hyperbolic and their complements will therefore contain at least three points",
    ", there is no loss of generality in doing this .",
    "we now give a definition which describes three ways in which a curve can be said to divide two sets from each other . for two curves",
    "@xmath13 in @xmath1 , we write @xmath14 to denote homology in @xmath1 .",
    "let @xmath15 and @xmath16 be two disjoint closed sets and let @xmath17 be a closed curve which does not meet either set .    1 .",
    "we say @xmath17 separates @xmath15 and @xmath16 if no component of the complement @xmath18 contains points of both @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "we say @xmath17 _ separates @xmath15 and @xmath16 by parity _ if the winding number @xmath19 is even for every @xmath20 and odd for every @xmath21 or vice versa .",
    "we say @xmath17 _ separates @xmath15 and @xmath16 simply _ if @xmath17 separates @xmath15 and @xmath16 and at least one of these sets lies in a single component of @xmath18 .",
    "note that in the first case if @xmath17 separates @xmath15 and @xmath16 , then a finite number of components of @xmath18 gives us a separation of @xmath15 and @xmath16 . for a simple closed curve ,",
    "these three forms of separation are equivalent .",
    "if @xmath17 is a simple closed curve which separates @xmath15 and @xmath16 , unless stated otherwise , we shall always assume that @xmath17 has positive orientation and that @xmath22 for all points @xmath23 in @xmath15 while @xmath24 for all points @xmath23 in @xmath16 .",
    "from now on , for convenience let us assume that , unless stated otherwise , @xmath1 is a hyperbolic domain and @xmath15 and @xmath16 are closed disjoint sets which each contain at least two points and for which @xmath25 .",
    "let us call such a separation of the complement of @xmath1 _ non - trivial_. again for convenience , we shall assume that @xmath15 is bounded and @xmath26 . note that any curve which separates such sets can not be homotopic either to a point in @xmath1 or a point in @xmath27 ( i.e. a puncture ) .",
    "as we will see later ( e.g. in figure 1 ) , there may be many geodesics in different homotopy classes which separate @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "however , we can always find one which is as short as possible .",
    "let @xmath1 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 be as above .",
    "then there exists a geodesic @xmath17 which separates @xmath15 and @xmath16 and whose length in the hyperbolic metric is as short as possible among all geodesics which separate @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "the two main questions , then , are whether this geodesic is simple and whether it is unique .",
    "unfortunately , the answer to both of these is no as the following result shows .",
    "there exists a hyperbolic domain @xmath1 and a non - trivial separation @xmath15 , @xmath16 of @xmath27 so that the shortest geodesic in @xmath1 which separates @xmath15 and @xmath16 is neither simple nor unique .",
    "however , on the positive side , we can show the existence of a simple closed geodesic of minimum length which separates the sets @xmath15 , @xmath16 of a non - trivial separation of the complement of a general hyperbolic domain @xmath1 .",
    "there exists a simple closed geodesic @xmath17 which separates @xmath15 and @xmath16 and whose hyperbolic length is as short as possible for all curves which separate @xmath15 and @xmath16 by parity .",
    "in particular , @xmath17 is as short as possible in its homology class and also as short as possible among all simple closed curves which separate @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "furthermore , any curve which separates @xmath15 and @xmath16 by parity and has the same length as @xmath17 must also be a simple closed geodesic .",
    "it is in fact relatively easy to show that there is a shortest closed curve among all simple closed curves which separate @xmath15 and @xmath16 and that this curve must be a simple closed geodesic .",
    "the strength of this result , then , is that this curve is shortest among a class of curves which are not all simple and that any curve of the same length must also be a simple closed geodesic .",
    "let @xmath17 be a simple closed smooth hyperbolic geodesic which is topologically non - trivial in @xmath1 , let @xmath28 be a universal covering map and let @xmath29 be the corresponding group of covering transformations .",
    "any lift of @xmath17 to @xmath30 is a hyperbolic geodesic in @xmath30 and going once around @xmath17 lifts to a hyperbolic mbius transformation @xmath7 which fixes this geodesic .",
    "the invariant geodesic is then the axis of @xmath7 , @xmath31 .",
    "the hyperbolic length of @xmath17 is then the same as the translation length @xmath32 which is the hyperbolic distance @xmath7 moves points on @xmath31 .",
    "note that the quantity @xmath32 does not depend on our choice of lift and is conformally invariant .",
    "we shall call a segment of @xmath31 which joins two points @xmath23 , @xmath33 on @xmath31 a _ full segment _ of @xmath31 .",
    "this discussion and the above result lead to the following definition .",
    "let @xmath1 be a hyperbolic domain and let @xmath17 be a simple closed smooth hyperbolic geodesic in @xmath1 which is as short as possible in its homology class .",
    "such a curve @xmath17 is called a _ meridian _ of @xmath1 and the hyperbolic length @xmath34",
    "is called the _ translation length _ or simply the _ length _ of @xmath17 .    from the statement of theorem 1.3 ,",
    "a meridian @xmath17 is the shortest possible simple closed curve which separates @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "an important special case and indeed the prototype for the above definition is the equator of a conformal annulus and just as the equator is important in determining the geometry of a conformal annulus , meridians are important in determining the geometry of domains of ( possibly ) higher connectivity .",
    "in particular , the lengths of the meridians of a domain are conformally invariant .",
    "the main problem with meridians is that except in special cases such as an annulus , meridians may not be unique .",
    "there exists a hyperbolic domain @xmath1 and a non - trivial separation @xmath15 , @xmath16 of @xmath27 such that there is more than one meridian which separates @xmath15 and @xmath16 .    however , if one of the complementary components is connected , then we do have uniqueness .",
    "furthermore , in this case , the meridian is the shortest possible geodesic which separates @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "if at least one of the sets @xmath15 , @xmath16 is connected , then there is only one simple closed geodesic @xmath17 in @xmath1 which separates @xmath15 and @xmath16 . in particular",
    ", @xmath17 must be a meridian .",
    "in addition , any other geodesic which separates @xmath15 and @xmath16 must be longer than @xmath17 .",
    "let us call a meridian as above where at least one of the sets @xmath15 , @xmath16 is connected a _",
    "principal meridian _ of @xmath1 .",
    "the theorem then tells us that principal meridians are unique .",
    "these meridians have other nice properties .",
    "for example , we will see that they are disjoint and do not meet any other meridians of @xmath1 ( theorem 2.5 ) .",
    "in this section , we prove the theorems stated in section 1 , together with some supporting results .",
    "before we can prove theorems 1.1 and especially theorem 1.3 , we need to answer the basic question of whether , given a separation of the complement of a domain into two disjoint closed sets , one can always find at least one simple closed curve which separates these sets    let @xmath1 be a domain and suppose we can find disjoint non - empty closed sets @xmath15 , @xmath16 with @xmath25 .",
    "then there exists a piecewise smooth simple closed curve in @xmath1 which separates @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "we begin with a variant of the construction given in @xcite theorem 14 , page 139 which is also similar to that described in @xcite . as usual",
    ", we can suppose that @xmath26 so that @xmath15 is compact .",
    "let @xmath35 , the euclidean distance between @xmath15 and @xmath16 , and cover the whole plane with a net of squares of side length @xmath36 .",
    "let @xmath37 be the cycle @xmath38    where the sum ranges over all those squares @xmath39 which meet @xmath15 . by cancelling those segments which are on the boundary of more than one square",
    ", we can say that @xmath40 for every @xmath20 , even if @xmath23 lies on the edge or corner of a square , while @xmath41 for every @xmath21 . by examining the possible number of these remaining segments at each vertex , we see that only two or four of them may meet at such a vertex",
    ". if we then thicken @xmath37 as in @xcite in such a way as to avoid @xmath16 , then @xmath37 will be non - singular ( in the sense defined on page 140 of @xcite ) and its boundary will consist of arcs and simple polygons in view of theorem 1.2 on chapter 6 , page 140 of @xcite .",
    "however , the end point of an arc is a vertex which lies on only one segment and so we see that we can express @xmath37 in the form @xmath42    where the curves @xmath43 , @xmath44 are disjoint simple closed curves .",
    "we still need to show that we can separate @xmath15 and @xmath16 with just one simple closed curve and we do this by induction on the number @xmath0 of such simple closed curves consisting of horizontal and vertical line segments in a cycle @xmath37 as above for which @xmath40 for every @xmath20 and @xmath41 for every @xmath21 . clearly the result is trivially true for @xmath45 , so suppose now it is true for any such cycle consisting of @xmath46 curves , i.e. that if there is a cycle @xmath47 consisting of @xmath46 disjoint simple closed curves which are made up of horizontal and vertical line segments for which @xmath48 for every @xmath20 and @xmath49 for every @xmath21 , then we can find a simple closed curve in @xmath1 consisting of horizontal and vertical line segments and which separates @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "so suppose now that @xmath37 consists of @xmath0 curves and join @xmath12 to @xmath13 by a path @xmath8 in @xmath1 .",
    "it is easy to see that we may assume that @xmath8 is an arc ( i.e. a non self - intersecting path ) consisting of horizontal and vertical line segments .",
    "such a path may cross both these curves a number of times and may also meet some of the other curves in our cycle .",
    "however , by restricting the path and relabelling the curves if necessary , we may assume that @xmath8 is a path from @xmath12 to @xmath13 which meets @xmath12 and @xmath13 only at its endpoints and avoids the remaining curves @xmath50 .",
    "if we then let @xmath51 be the new cycle @xmath52 , then we still have that @xmath53 for every @xmath20 and @xmath54 for every @xmath21 .    by turning @xmath8 and @xmath55 into two slightly different disjoint arcs in opposite directions ( again consisting of horizontal and vertical line segments ) and deleting a small part of @xmath12 and @xmath13 , we can then combine @xmath12 and @xmath13 into one simple closed curve in @xmath1 which is disjoint from @xmath50 .",
    "( note that we can make these two paths by replacing @xmath8 with a suitable collection of small squares whose boundaries are oriented positively and then cancelling those segments which lie on the boundary of more than one square including those small segments of @xmath12 and @xmath13 that we remove above ) .",
    "if we denote the new cycle obtained in this way by @xmath56 , then we can ensure that this cycle is homotopic and thus homologous in @xmath1 to @xmath51 and so we still have that @xmath57 for every @xmath20 and @xmath58 for every @xmath21 .",
    "@xmath56 then consists of @xmath46 simple closed curves and it follows by induction that we can find a single simple closed curve @xmath17 in @xmath1 consisting of horizontal and vertical line segments and which separates @xmath15 and @xmath16 as required .",
    "we remark that using this result , one can easily satisfy oneself that finitely connected domains are precisely those domains where any subset of the components of the complement can be separated from the remaining components by a simple closed curve . for more on",
    "finitely connected domains , we refer the reader to section 3 of this paper .    for the most part we shall be working with the spherical metric @xmath60 on @xmath61 ( rather than the euclidean metric ) .",
    "recall that the length element for this metric , @xmath62 is given by @xmath63    we recall a well - known lemma concerning the behaviour of the hyperbolic metric near the boundary . a proof can be found in @xcite page 13 , theorem 4.3 and it is the lower bound it gives on the hyperbolic metric which will be of particular importance for us .",
    "for a point @xmath64 , we shall denote the spherical distance to @xmath65 by @xmath66 or just @xmath67 if once again the domain is clear from the context . for a family @xmath68 of mbius transformations",
    ", we say that @xmath69 is _ bi - equicontinuous on @xmath61 _ if both @xmath69 and the family @xmath70 of inverse mappings are equicontinous families on @xmath61 ( with respect to the spherical metric ) .",
    "let @xmath71 be a hyperbolic domain",
    ". then there exists @xmath72 for which the hyperbolic metric @xmath73 on @xmath1 satisfies @xmath74    an important fact to note in connection with this result is the degree to which these estimates are independent of the particular domain under consideration and in particular how we can get bounds on the constant @xmath75 and even more importantly on the size of the region on which this estimate holds near a given point on the boundary .",
    "let @xmath76 be the closest point in @xmath27 to @xmath23 and choose two other points @xmath77 , @xmath78 in @xmath65 .",
    "whose separation in the spherical topology is bounded below .",
    "the proof in @xcite then uses a mbius transformation to map these three points to @xmath79 , @xmath80 and @xmath81 respectively and uses the schwarz lemma to compare the hyperbolic metric for @xmath1 with that of @xmath82 .",
    "it thus follows that these estimates are uniform with respect to the minimum separation in the spherical metric between @xmath76 , @xmath77 and @xmath78 .",
    "this fact will be important to us later on as we will see in the counterexample in theorem 1.2 .",
    "finally , note that the original statement of this result is in terms of the euclidean rather than the spherical distance to the boundary .",
    "however , in view of the above discussion , it is clear that if we want our estimates to be uniform , we must make use of the spherical distance .",
    "we remind the reader of two well - known results on hyperbolic geodesics .",
    "let @xmath1 be a hyperbolic domain and let @xmath83 be two ( not necessarily distinct ) points of @xmath1 .",
    "then there is a unique geodesic in every homotopy class of curves joining @xmath76 and @xmath77 which is also the unique shortest curve in this homotopy class .",
    "let @xmath1 be a hyperbolic domain and let @xmath17 be a non - trivial closed curve in @xmath1 .",
    "then either there is a unique shortest geodesic which is also the shortest curve in the free homotopy class of @xmath17 , or @xmath17 is homotopic to a puncture on @xmath1 and there are arbitrarily short curves in the free homotopy class of @xmath17 .",
    "we first consider the easier question of the shortest curve in a given homotopy class which separates @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "let @xmath84 be a simple closed curve which separates @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "then there exists a unique simple closed smooth geodesic @xmath17 which is the shortest curve in the free homotopy class of @xmath84 in @xmath1 and in particular also separates @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "conversely , given a simple closed smooth hyperbolic geodesic @xmath17 in @xmath1 , @xmath17 separates @xmath27 non - trivially and is the unique geodesic in its homotopy class and also the unique curve of shortest possible length in this class .",
    "note that the fact that @xmath17 must separate @xmath15 and @xmath16 in the first part of the statement follows easily from the jordan curve theorem and the fact that @xmath17 is simple and must be homologous in @xmath1 to @xmath84 .",
    "* proof of theorem 2.4 * we start by observing that in view of theorem 2.1 , we can always find a simple closed curve @xmath84 which separates @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "since @xmath15 and @xmath16 both contain at least two points , any curve which is homotopic to @xmath84 can not be homotopic to a point or a puncture on @xmath1 and so by proposition 3.3.9 on page 73 of @xcite , then there is a simple closed geodesic @xmath17 in the free homotopy class of @xmath84 which , using winding numbers , must separate @xmath15 and @xmath16 . by theorem 2.3",
    ", @xmath17 is unique .    to prove the second part of the statement ,",
    "let @xmath17 be a simple closed hyperbolic geodesic in @xmath1 and as above let @xmath15 and @xmath16 denote the two subsets of @xmath27 separated by @xmath17 . if one of these sets , say @xmath15 , is empty , then it is a routine exercise to show that @xmath17 is contractible to a point in @xmath1 and so can not be a geodesic .",
    "also , if one of these sets , again say @xmath15 , is a single point , then once more it is easy to see that @xmath17 is homotopic in @xmath1 to a puncture and so again by theorem 2.3 can not be a geodesic which completes the proof .",
    "@xmath59    a more general question is to consider all geodesics which separate @xmath15 and @xmath16 as in the first part of definition 1.1 and this is the content of theorem 1.1 .",
    "* proof of theorem 1.1 * we note that , by theorems 2.1 and 2.4 , the class of geodesics which separate @xmath15 and @xmath16 is non - empty .",
    "since neither @xmath15 nor @xmath16 is a point , the spherical and hence euclidean diameter and hence also the arc length of any curve which separates these sets must be bounded below .",
    "now let @xmath85 be the infimum of the hyperbolic lengths ( in the sense of the riemann - stieltjes integral e.g. in chapter iv of @xcite ) of all closed geodesics which separate @xmath15 and @xmath16 and take a sequence @xmath86 of such geodesics whose hyperbolic lengths tend to @xmath85 ( note that these curves are smooth and thus of bounded variation by proposition 1.3 on page 58 of @xcite ) .",
    "since the euclidean arc lengths of these curves are bounded below , the standard estimates on the hyperbolic metric from lemma 2.1 combined with the remarks following it and the divergence of the improper integral @xmath87    show that these curves are uniformly bounded away from @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "the curves @xmath86 then all lie in a compact subset of @xmath1 and as their hyperbolic lengths are uniformly bounded above , their arc lengths will also be uniformly bounded above .",
    "finally , since their arc lengths are uniformly bounded below , it follows that their hyperbolic lengths are uniformly bounded below away from zero and so @xmath88 .",
    "since the arc lengths of the curves @xmath86 are then uniformly bounded above and below we can use linear maps to reparametrize these curves so that are all defined on @xmath89 $ ] and give us an equicontinuous family on this interval . using the arzela - ascoli theorem and the completeness of @xmath90 $ ]",
    ", we can find a subsequence @xmath91 such that as @xmath92 tends to infinity , the curves @xmath93 converge uniformly to a limit @xmath17 .",
    "it follows from the uniform convergence and that fact that the curves @xmath93 have uniformly bounded variation that @xmath17 must also be of bounded variation . using equicontinuity and again the fact that the curves @xmath93 have uniformly bounded variation and are uniformly bounded away from @xmath65 , a standard argument similar to that in the proof of theorem 1.4 on page 60 of @xcite shows that @xmath94 .",
    "additionally , as @xmath17 is a uniform limit of geodesics , it must also be a geodesic in the hyperbolic metric of @xmath1 .",
    "the uniform convergence of @xmath93 to @xmath17 ensures that @xmath93 is homotopic in @xmath1 to @xmath17 for @xmath92 large enough .",
    "it then follows immediately from theorem 2.3 that @xmath95 for @xmath92 large enough and in particular that @xmath17 must separate @xmath15 and @xmath16 as desired .",
    "@xmath59    a stronger version of this result would be if @xmath17 were the shortest curve among all curves which separate @xmath15 and @xmath16 and not just the shortest geodesic .",
    "a similar procedure to that above shows that it is not difficult to deduce the existence of a closed curve which separates @xmath15 and @xmath16 and which is as short as possible .",
    "the difficulty is that this curve may not be a geodesic and if one applies theorem 2.3 to find the shortest geodesic in its free homotopy class , then there is nothing to prevent this geodesic from no longer separating @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "we next prove theorem 1.2 .",
    "first , however , we need to prove a lemma about the points of intersection of hyperbolic geodesics .",
    "let @xmath1 be a hyperbolic domain and let @xmath17 be a closed hyperbolic geodesic in @xmath1 .",
    "then @xmath17 can have only finitely many points of self - intersection .",
    "this includes the case of a point on @xmath17 which meets infinitely many distinct arcs of @xmath17 .",
    "further , if @xmath12 and @xmath13 are two distinct closed geodesics in @xmath1 , then @xmath12 and @xmath13 can have only finitely many points of intersection .",
    "any geodesic in @xmath1 is easily seen to be freely homotopic in @xmath1 to a curve consisting of finitely many horizontal and vertical line segments . as two such polygonal curves can intersect each other only finitely many times , the result for two curves follows easily from proposition 3.3.9 on page 73 of @xcite .",
    "a similar argument to the proof of this result gives us the case with one geodesic .",
    "@xmath59    * proof of theorem 1.2 * the construction of the required counterexample is based on the figure below .",
    "let @xmath96 , let @xmath97 be the three points @xmath98 , @xmath99 , let @xmath100 , @xmath101 and let @xmath102 be the domain @xmath103 .",
    "by lemma 2.1 , if we let @xmath104 be a simple closed geodesics which separates @xmath105 from @xmath106 , then @xmath104 must have hyperbolic length @xmath107 which tends to infinity as @xmath108 tends to @xmath79 ( in fact , @xmath109 as @xmath110 for some @xmath111 ) .",
    "we claim that we can find @xmath112 not depending on @xmath108 ( or the homotopy class of @xmath104 ) such that the spherical distance from @xmath104 to @xmath113 is bounded below by @xmath114 . to see this note that if @xmath115 is a segment of @xmath116 which subtends an angle @xmath108 at @xmath79 and every point on @xmath115 is within distance @xmath117 of @xmath113 , then by lemma 2.1 and the remarks following it , we can find @xmath118 independent of @xmath108 such that @xmath119 . on the other hand ,",
    "if we replace @xmath115 by a curve @xmath120 consisting of two radial line segments from the endpoints of @xmath115 to @xmath121 combined with a suitable segment of this circle which subtends angle @xmath108 , then lemma 2.1 again tells us that we can find @xmath122 not depending on @xmath108 such that @xmath123 ( note that such a modified curve is still homotopic to @xmath104 ) .",
    "it then follows that we can find @xmath124 not depending on @xmath108 such that for any segment @xmath115 which subtends an angle @xmath125 , we must have a point @xmath23 on @xmath115 with @xmath126 .",
    "further , for @xmath127 , any such point is within distance @xmath128 of another such point @xmath129 on @xmath104 with @xmath130 and we can find an arc of @xmath104 joining @xmath23 and @xmath129 which subtends an angle of at most @xmath131 . by lemma 2.1 once more , the hyperbolic distance @xmath132 is uniformly bounded in @xmath108 and , as it subtends an angle of at most @xmath131 , a simple homotopy argument using theorem 2.2 shows that the same must be true for the above arc of @xmath104 . a final application of lemma 2.1 together with the divergence of the improper integral in the last result shows that we can make @xmath133 smaller if needed , but still independent of @xmath108 so that @xmath134 for every point @xmath23 on @xmath104 as desired .",
    "any radial half - line from @xmath79 which meets the interior of @xmath104 must meet @xmath104 itself in at least two places . then , by connecting the points of @xmath105 by curves inside @xmath104 , and using the intermediate value theorem , we see that we can find at least four disjoint arcs of @xmath104 , each of which covers angles precisely in the range @xmath135 $ ] , @xmath136 $ ] , or @xmath137 $ ] .",
