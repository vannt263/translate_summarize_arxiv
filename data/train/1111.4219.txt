    "we discuss the implications of these findings .",
    "we focus our attention on a subsonic , weakly magnetized fluid for which the ram pressure and magnetic pressure remain small compared to their thermal counterpart . as a first approximation",
    ", we thus consider a differentially rotating fluid with angular frequency @xmath6 and constant background density @xmath7 .",
    "this is a reasonable assumption in light of the results presented by @xcite and @xcite , who carried out numerical simulations of boundary layers of unstratified accretion disks and found that the density fluctuations throughout the simulations are in general quite small .",
    "we work in the framework of the shearing - sheet approximation @xcite , where the equations describing an incompressible mhd fluid in a corotating frame are given by @xmath8 here , @xmath9 and @xmath10 , with @xmath11 , stand for the velocity and magnetic fields ; @xmath12 and @xmath13 denote the kinematic viscosity and resistivity ; and @xmath14 is the corotating angular frequency at a fiducial radius @xmath15 .",

    "we remark that equations  ( [ eq : u ] ) and ( [ eq : b ] ) are _ not _ just linearized equations , they remain valid even if the amplitude of the perturbations is not small compared to the background values , and they are exact as long as a single fourier mode is considered . under these conditions , it is sensible to study the evolution of @xmath24 and @xmath25 for a long time .    in order to solve equations  ( [ eq : u ] ) and ( [ eq : b ] ) , it is convenient to work in fourier space .",

    "the expression for the energy density at early / late times in terms of the constants @xmath110 and @xmath111 is given by , and thus avoid the uninteresting contributions due to any stable alfvn wave initially present , see equations  ( [ sol : uz])([sol : bz ] ) . ]",
    "@xmath112 therefore , the energy gain via swing amplification , @xmath113 , is in general a function of the ratio @xmath114 and the initial conditions .",

    "the dependence of the energy gain on the initial conditions for @xmath115 is shown in figure  [ fig : rs ] .",
    "the horizontal axis describes how the initial energy is distributed between the @xmath116 modes and the @xmath117 modes ; while the different lines show the phase difference in the corresponding initial amplitudes .",
    "when @xmath118 or @xmath119 , the @xmath116 and @xmath117 modes are completely out of phase and evolve independently .",
    "this results in an energy gain which is linear in the initial amplitudes ( thick solid line ) .",
    "we have found that the dependence of the energy gain on the phase difference between the constants determining the initial conditions is weaker if @xmath120 decreases below unity . in this case , all the different curves converge to the thick line corresponding to @xmath118 . at the same time , as @xmath120 decreases below unity , this line gets steeper , providing thus a larger energy gain .",
    "this justifies referring to the @xmath117 and @xmath116 as the `` growing '' and `` decaying '' modes , respectively .",
    "we illustrate the dependence of the energy gain on the shear parameter in figure  [ fig : rq ] ( because the results depend only on @xmath121 , we only show the positive domain in the horizontal axis ) . in the limit of weak shear ,",
    "there are only pure alfvn waves and there is no net energy gain .",
    "the dashed line shows that the energy gain tends to the value @xmath122 as @xmath123 , which provides a good description of the numerical results for strong shear .",
    "the asymptotic behavior is insensitive to the initial conditions as long as the growing mode is excited , i.e. @xmath124 .    , on the initial conditions for @xmath125 .",
    "the horizontal axis provides a measure of the relative amplitude of @xmath126 and @xmath127 ; while the different lines show the results for various phase differences . for strong shear @xmath128 ,",
    "the dependence of the phase is weaker and all the different curves collapse onto the straight thick line , which corresponds to @xmath118 , while this one gets steeper , thus providing a larger energy gain , see also figure  [ fig : rq ] . ]",
    "we have employed the shearing - sheet framework to study the dynamical evolution of mhd waves in weakly magnetized differentially rotating backgrounds which are stable to the mri . while the fact that these waves can be transiently amplified is widely appreciated , our motivation to study them , as well as the results that we obtained , concern dynamical aspects that have not received as much attention .",
    "this is whether these shearing mhd waves can play a significant role in the transport of angular momentum in regions of the disk where the mri is inefficient , such as the accretion disk boundary layer .     for different values of the shear , parameterized via @xmath129 , obtained via numerical integration using the initial conditions @xmath84 and",
    "@xmath85 , i.e. , only the growing mode is excited . in the limit of weak shear",

    "the dashed line shows the function @xmath130 , which is in good agreement with the numerical results for strong shear .",
    "this asymptotic behavior is independent of the initial conditions as long as @xmath131 . ]",
    "the equations that we have solved are similar to those presented in @xcite , who provided numerical solutions showing that transient amplification of mhd waves is a general outcome for the modes with wavevectors that are not exactly aligned with the rotation @xmath62-axis .",
    "analytical insight on the non - linear dynamics of these waves has been usually hindered by the fact that the governing equations can not be simplified beyond a set of coupled differential equations ( see , e.g. , , and also @xcite , where higher order wkb solutions for the linear evolution of the shearing waves are provided ) . in this paper , by isolating the modes that are unrelated to the standard mri , i.e. , by setting @xmath61 , we have been able to provide analytical solutions that are valid for all times , except close to the instant where the waves evolve from leading to trailing , i.e. , when @xmath132 .",
    "these solutions are exact when only one fourier mode is considered @xcite .    despite the fact that we do not predict analytically the amplification factor for these waves , the characteristics of the solutions that we found allowed us to draw important conclusions .",
    "we showed that the amplification factor is _ only _ a function of the ( time - independent ) dimensionless ratio @xmath133 , with @xmath134 see equation  ( [ eq : amplification ] ) and figure  [ fig : rq ] , and it is thus insensitive to the sign of the shear parameter @xmath21 .",
    "an important result of this study is that while the energy of these mhd waves can be significantly amplified , their net associated stresses oscillate around zero , see equation  ( [ eq : txy ] ) and figure  [ fig : se ] .",
    "this suggests that these shearing mhd waves are unlikely to play an important role in the transport of angular momentum in the accretion disk boundary layer region .",
    "these findings are consistent with the results of global mhd simulations of accretion disks with a rigid inner boundary carried out in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "these simulations show that the inner disk regions , where @xmath4 , can develop strong toroidal magnetic fields , with associated magnetic energies that can easily reach a few tenths of the thermal energy , without leading to efficient angular momentum transport .",
    "the importance of understanding the relationship between the stress and the radial gradient in angular frequency resides in that this dependence plays a key role when modeling the inner structure of an accretion disk surrounding a weekly magnetized star ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .    in the steady state ,",
    "the constant inward flux of angular momentum at any given radius @xmath15 is given by @xmath135 , where @xmath136 stands for the accretion rate , @xmath137 is the specific angular momentum , @xmath138 is the disk height , and @xmath139 ( denoted by @xmath100 in our analysis ) is the component of the stress responsible for the flux of azimuthal momentum across the radial direction .",
    "thus , the angular momentum flux has two contributions : @xmath140 , which accounts for the flux of angular momentum due to mass accretion , and @xmath141 , which accounts for the flux of angular momentum due to the stress acting on the fluid elements constituting the disk . under the reasonable assumption that the disk must be keplerian well beyond the boundary layer , i.e. , for @xmath142 , and that the stress should vanish in the absence of shear",
    ", we must have @xmath143 , i.e. , a slowly rotating star accretes mass _ and _ angular momentum .    in order for this picture to be self - consistent",
    ", the stress must satisfy @xmath144 . in the standard accretion disk model",
    "this requirement is satisfied by assuming that the stress is linearly proportional to the local shear @xmath145 . with this model for the stress , and some supplementary assumptions , it is possible to solve for the radial dependence of @xmath0 and determine the structure of the disk ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "however , this assumption , broadly adopted in the framework of enhanced turbulent disk viscosity , does not seem to be supported by the modern paradigm , in which angular momentum transport is due to mhd turbulence driven by the mri .",
    "indeed , both local numerical simulations of shearing - boxes with non - keplerian shear profiles and global disk simulations with a rigid inner boundary @xcite suggest that angular momentum transport is inefficient if @xmath5 .",
    "this suggests that the detailed structure of accretion disk boundary layers resulting from the interaction of an mhd disk with a weakly magnetized star could differ appreciably from those derived within the standard turbulent shear viscosity , where the direction of angular momentum transport is always opposite to the angular frequency gradient .",
    "it is worth mentioning explicitly that the shearing - sheet framework that we have employed is inherently limited to address the conditions expected in the accretion disk boundary layer .",
    "for example , the absence of a hard - inner boundary could prevent kelvin - helmholtz instabilities from operating , see , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "however , these instabilities do not seem to play a predominant role in the global mhd simulations of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "moreover , because we have assumed a constant background density , our analysis precludes the possibility of buoyant modes or convective instabilities . whether these instabilities , and the turbulence they could drive , transport angular momentum inward or outward in keplerian disks has been long debated @xcite . to our knowledge",
    ", these convective instabilities have not been studied in differentially rotating backgrounds with angular frequencies increasing outward ; and speculating about their role goes beyond the scope of the present work .    in spite of the simplifications of our analytical study , the explicit solutions that we have found can provide physical insight and help elucidate transport processes in the inner disk regions close to a weakly magnetized accreting star .",
    "the current availability of powerful parallel codes ( e.g. @xcite ) which are already being used to study the hydrodynamics of accretion disk boundary layers @xcite holds the promise that a more detailed understanding of mhd boundary layers will soon be possible ."
