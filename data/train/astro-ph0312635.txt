    "deep surveys provide numerous constraints on the structure and evolution of the universe .",
    "it has been known that galaxy number counts in a specific bandpass can provide a useful constraint on galaxy evolution @xcite .",
    "multi - color surveys further constrain the galaxy formation history and allow for the selection of galaxies in specific redshift ranges .",
    "this work was pioneered in the hawaii surveys @xcite and subsequently used extensively by steidel et .",
    "al @xcite for mapping @xmath11 and @xmath12 galaxies . by using a color selection these groups were able to select and obtain spectra for over 1000 @xmath11 galaxies with a 90% success rate .",
    "this gave us a wealth of information about this redshift range .",
    "with the ability of modern detectors to take deep images in the near ir we can now select galaxies up to @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "the hubble deep fields ( hdfs ) @xcite showed the value of photometric redshifts applied to deep multi - color surveys .",
    "this technique allows estimates of redshifts for objects much too faint for optical spectroscopy .",
    "it allows for economical measurement of the redshifts of millions of galaxies .    despite the depth and accuracy of the hdf data",
    ", it only covers a small co - moving volume .",
    "@xcite have looked at the clustering of galaxies using the two point correlation function of galaxies projected on the sky .",
    "this work covered 16 sq .",
    "degrees in @xmath5 band .",
    "it has shown that galaxies are highly clustered on scales of 15 - 20 @xmath14 mpc where @xmath15 ho/100 km s@xmath16mpc@xmath16 .",
    "this has provided a challenge in obtaining an unbiased sample of galaxies , since several square degrees must be surveyed .",
    "the present paper is the first of a series which will aim to obtain the required data by imaging several 0.2 sq . degree fields .",
    "previous studies of galaxy formation and evolution have solely used optical data which introduced biases .",
    "however new generations of radio , x - ray , and mid - ir telescopes have opened up these wavelengths to deep wide - field surveys .",
    "x - rays have constrained the active galactic nuclei ( agn ) history @xcite , while radio and mid - ir fluxes have proven to be a good probe of star formation .",
    "space based optical imaging also allowed for the morphological study of galaxies out to high redshift . as such",
    "we have chosen to target regions of the sky that have been observed in multiple wave bands .",
    "we began with the hdf - n because of its deep and complete multi - wavelength data provided by the great observatories origins deep survey ( goods ) and other surveys .",
    "we have covered 0.4 square degrees centered on the hdf - n .",
    "the central 0.2 square degrees of this data are of consistent quality in all optical bands , this area contains 48,858 objects detected at 5@xmath17 in @xmath4 or @xmath6 band .",
    "this paper is one in a series focusing on the hawaii hdf - n .",
    "the properties of x - ray selected objects are discussed in @xcite .",
    "photometric redshifts , spectroscopic redshifts , and multi - wavelength analysis will be discussed in @xcite .",
    "the main focus of the present paper is the optical / ir data reduction and catalog .",
    "we also provide number counts and color - color plots to allow for comparison with current and future surveys .",
    "we have also selected high redshift candidates using color selections and comment on the effectiveness of this technique at @xmath18 as well as the implications for the star formation history .",
    "to optimize our data collection , observations were conducted on a variety of instruments .",
    "the @xmath1 band data were collected using the kitt peak national observatory 4 m ( kpno-4 m ) telescope with the mosaic prime focus camera .",
    "this camera has a reasonable @xmath1 band response and @xmath19 field of view @xcite .",
    "the @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and @xmath6 band data were collected using the subaru 8.2 m telescope and suprime - cam instrument @xcite which is optimized for red optical response and has a @xmath20 field of view . finally our @xmath7 data were collected using the quirc camera on the university of hawaii 2.2 m telescope @xcite with a @xmath21 field of view .",
    "the @xmath7 filter covers both the @xmath22 and @xmath23 bands in a single filter which allows for greater depth at the expense of some color information .",
    "the details of these observations are found in tables [ data details1 ] and [ data details2 ] .    for data collected with suprime - cam a five point",
    "x - shaped dither pattern was used with one arc minute steps .",
    "the camera was rotated by 90 degrees between dither patterns to remove bleeding from bright stars and provide better photometric calibration .",
    "the kpno-4 m data were collected using a nine point grid as a dither pattern with one arc minute steps between pointings .",
    "for both the suprime - cam and kpno-4 m observations the telescope was offset by 10 in a random direction between dither patterns .",
    "the @xmath7 data were collected using a 13 point diamond shaped dither pattern with 10 steps between exposures .",
    "the filter profiles multiplied by the detector response are plotted in figure [ filters ] along with the hdf - n filters used in @xcite .",
    "quantifiable measures of image quality are given in section [ s : detect ] .",
    "all of these data were reduced using nick kaiser s imcat toolskaiser / imcat/ ] .",
    "the @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and @xmath6 data were first overscan corrected and bias subtracted .",
    "median sky flats were then used to provide a first pass flat fielding .",
    "objects were then masked out and a second flat field was generated for each dither pattern .",
    "the second pass flat fielding was necessary to correct for changes in the instruments due to mechanical flexure and rotation of the camera and optics .",
    "the sky was then subtracted using a second order polynomial surface fit to the sky for each chip of each image .",
    "after the first pass sky subtraction the suprime - cam images had time variable scattered light structure left in the images .",
    "this problem occurred at the edges of the field where the camera was vignetted and was worst when the moon was up . to correct for this structure",
    "the objects were masked out and a surface was tessellated to the sky background and subtracted off .",
    "the @xmath6 band data taken before april of 2001 were corrected for fringing . to achieve this a surface was tessellated on a 32-pixel grid over the first pass flat field .",
    "this surface was used to provide first pass flat fielding instead of the median flat . a median fringe frame",
    "was then generated for each night of data , scaled to the background in each image , and subtracted from the flat - fielded images .",
    "the images were then second pass flattened and sky subtracted as with the other bands .",
    "after april of 2001 new chips were installed that had minimal fringing so fringe subtraction was not performed .",
    "the @xmath1 band data were corrected for internal pupil reflections which occur on the mosaic camera on the kpno-4 m telescope .",
    "a pupil image was constructed by dividing the @xmath1 band flat by a @xmath3 band flat and masking out the areas that did not contain a pupil reflection .",
    "the pupil image was subtracted from the @xmath1 band flat before flat fielding .",
    "the pupil image was then scaled to the background in each image and subtracted off . a second pass flat fielding",
    "was then performed for each dither pattern as done for the other bands .",
    "the @xmath7 data were collected in 13 point dither patterns so the data could be flattened and sky subtracted separately for each dither pattern using median sky flats .",
    "this allowed us to remove the time variability in the bias , flat field , and sky which occurs in ir arrays . the images in each dither pattern",
    "were then combined using a weighted mean to provide an image deep enough to map onto the optical astrometry grid .",
    "cosmic rays were removed during the combination process by looking for pixels which lay more than 5@xmath17 from the weighted mean value .",
    "sigma was calculated from the background noise in each image .",
    "since the image depth varied across the combined , dithered images , an inverse variance map was created for each dither sequence .",
    "these inverse variance maps were later used to combine the separate dither sequences .      an initial solution for the optical distortion",
    "was calculated by comparing standard star frames to the usno - a2.0 @xcite . from this point",
    "onward we treated each chip in each exposure as a separate image with a separate distortion .",
    "this took into account changes in the optical distortion with time , as well as any mechanical motion on the focal plane .    using the initial solution we registered images to one another to cross",
    "identify point sources from image to image .",
    "we also identified any usno - a2.0 @xcite stars which were not saturated in our images .",
    "since most usno - a2.0 objects were saturated in the suprime - cam images , the mosaic @xmath1 band data were used for the astrometric solution .",
    "the @xmath1 band data was also chosen because it covers a larger area than the other bands .    at magnitudes fainter than 18",
    "the usno - a2.0 stars are not properly corrected for magnitude dependent systematics . as well errors for individual stars are not quoted in the usno - a2.0 and",
    "are significantly worse than the mean at the faintest level .",
    "as such all usno - a2.0 stars were assumed to have a root mean square ( rms ) uncertainty of 2 in relative astrometry which is larger than any expected systematics .    in the center of the field",
    "usno - a2.0 stars were only used to constrain the scale factor and absolute astrometry of the fit .",
    "the relative astrometry was calculated by minimizing the positional scatter of stars which appeared in multiple images .",
    "this was done by fitting a third order two - dimensional polynomial to each image .",
    "the coefficients of the polynomials were calculated by minimizing the chi - squared defined by equation [ astromeq ] with respect to the coefficients defined in @xmath24 , the polynomial function . in equation [ astromeq ]",
    "@xmath25 is the number of images , and @xmath26 is the number of stars used for the astrometry . in this equation",
    "the usno - a2.0 is treated as an image , however @xmath24 is replaced with the known star positions .",
    "this effectively constrains the scale factor and rotation of the image .",
    "stars which were incorrectly cross - identified between images were removed in an iterative fashion until the astrometric solutions converged .",
    "@xmath27^{2}}{\\sigma_{i}^{2}+\\sigma_{j}^{2 } } \\label{astromeq}\\ ] ]    the resulting relative astrometry should be good to the centroiding error of @xmath28 pixel or @xmath29 rms across the center of the field where there are many measurements for each source .",
    "however this method breaks down at the edge of the field where there are fewer images . at the very edge of the field",
    "the astrometry is only good to 0.5 since only the usno - a2.0 constrains the fit hence systematics can not be removed .",
    "any chromatic aberrations in the astrometry should be minimal since both the kpno-4 m and suprime - cam have an atmospheric dispersion corrector .",
    "a large number of objects , with a wide range of colors were used for the astrometry , so any residual effects should be averaged out .",
    "a more extensive discussion of this issue can be found in @xcite .",
    "once an astrometric grid of objects was established , the @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and , @xmath4 data were warped onto it using a two - dimensional , third order polynomials for each image ( still treating each chip separately ) . to improve the grid in the redder bands point sources from the astrometricaly calibrated @xmath4 band image",
    "were added to the @xmath1 band astrometric grid .",
    "the @xmath5 , @xmath6 , and @xmath7 data were warped onto this improved grid in the same way as the bluer data . to provide accurate absolute astrometry",
    "the final images were registered to the radio catalog of @xcite .",
    "we have included comparisons to the radio catalog and usno - b1.0 @xcite in figures [ astro - radiofig ] , and [ astro - usnobfig ] .",
    "the usno - b1.0 positions are systematically offset from the radio positions by 0.5 north and 0.2 east ( see figure [ astro - usnobfig ] ) , but this offset was removed before making other comparisons .",
    "the rms astrometric scatter between the our positions and the radio positions over the central 0.2 square degree field is 0.22 .",
    "it is 0.32 between our positions and the usno - b1.0 . in both cases",
    "the scatter is dominated by the astrometric errors in the reference catalogs which are 0.16 in the radio catalog and 0.34 in the usno - b1.0 and shows no systematics across the central 0.2 square degree field .",
    "as expected we observe systematics with respect to the usno - b1.0 catalog at the edges of the field , however these offsets are less than 0.5 in amplitude .",
    "furthermore systematics at this level are known to exist in the usno - b1.0 @xcite so we chose not to remove them .      for the @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and @xmath6 data chip - to - chip photometric scaling factors were calculated for each dither pattern .",
    "this was necessary because each dither pattern was flattened separately which can change the relative normalization of the chips . when collecting our data we used large steps in our dither patterns and rotated the camera when possible .",
    "this meant we could always find a reference chip which covered the same area of sky as two or more chips in another exposure .",
    "the scaling between two chips in one exposure could then be calculated by comparing their scaling factors to a chip in another exposure .",
    "this was independent of exposure to exposure scaling so long as the photometry did not vary across the reference chip . to calculate the scale factors we used 6 apertures on objects detected at greater than 50@xmath17 with half light radii less than 1.5 .",
    "the large apertures were used to prevent any variations in seeing from affecting the scaling .",
    "the large number of exposures meant we made many measurements of the chip - to - chip scaling between adjacent chips .",
    "these were combined in a weighted mean .",
    "once the chip - to - chip photometric scaling was removed , exposure to exposure scale factors were calculated in a similar fashion by comparing overlapping areas between exposures .",
    "the geometric distortions in the mosaic and suprime cam optics cause each pixel to have a different effective area on the sky . by flat fielding these images",
    "we introduce a geometry dependent photometric offset . when calculating the photometric scaling we corrected for this effect .",
    "the @xmath7 data consists of 210 dither patterns of 13 images each .",
    "these data were collected under a combination of photometric and non - photometric conditions .",
    "we collected these data in such a way that each dither overlapped several neighboring dither patterns . to correct the photometry we calculated scale factors for each dither pattern such that the photometric scatter was minimized across the field in the overlapping regions .",
    "the absolute zero point was allowed to float during this procedure and later tied to the @xcite catalog ( see  [ s : photom ] ) .",
    "saturated pixels were clipped in the @xmath1 band images before warping or combination .",
    "however saturated pixels in the suprime - cam behaved in a very non - linear fashion , often dropping or ringing in value as they became more saturated .",
    "as such we could not simply clip the saturated pixels .",
    "we removed the saturation spikes along with satellite trails by searching for strings of elongated objects which formed straight lines in the images .",
    "a strip 21 pixels wide was clipped from the images along detected lines .    after applying photometric corrections each image",
    "was warped onto a stereographic projection .",
    "we corrected the geometry dependent photometric scaling by choosing a mapping which preserved surface brightness .",
    "the re - sampling was done using a nearest neighbor algorithm .",
    "a weighted mean was then calculated for each pixel , pixels which lay more than 5@xmath17 from the mean were rejected to remove cosmic rays . for the @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and @xmath6 data the sigma used in",
    "the rejection and weighting was measured from the rms background noise in the un - warped image . for the @xmath7 images",
    "a sigma was calculated for each pixel during the dither pattern combination and carried through to the final image combination . to avoid clipping pixels which varied due to seeing variations a window",
    "was defined around the median of the pixel values .",
    "if a pixel value were between half to twice the median value of all pixels it was accepted even if it were more than 5 sigma from the mean . a weighted mean and inverse variance",
    "were then calculated for all accepted pixels .",
    "the quality of the final images is displayed in figures [ uimage]-[iimage ] where we compare cutouts of our data in the hdf - n proper region with the hubble space telescope images of @xcite the area with @xmath7 data is shown in figure [ hkarea ] .",
    "the catalog of objects was detected in the @xmath4 and @xmath6 band images using sextractor .",
    "objects with three or more pixels rising more than 1.5@xmath17 above the background were analyzed , but only those with 5@xmath17 measurements of their aperture flux were output to the catalog .",
    "the significance of a detection was calculated using the rms map generated during the image combination process .",
    "the absolute scaling of the rms map was calculated by laying down random blank apertures away from objects on the images .",
    "this was done since the pixel - pixel noise underestimates the image noise .",
    "this method may somewhat overestimate the true noise since it also includes variations due to faint objects in the blank apertures .",
    "the area around bright stars was masked out to prevent erroneous detections and measurements from scattered light .",
    "we calculated both aperture and isophotal magnitudes for our images .",
    "aperture magnitudes were selected as the primary magnitude to avoid biases introduced by galaxy morphology in isophotal magnitudes . to avoid filter dependent aperture corrections",
    "the images were smoothed with a gaussian to match the median ratio of the total to the aperture magnitude in the worst seeing ( @xmath1 band ) image .",
    "we chose this method because it ensures the apertures are sampling the same percentage of the total light in all bands and does not assume the psf is gaussian .",
    "psf matching provided a lower signal to noise because it includes the non - gaussian components of all seven psf s which degraded the image quality .",
    "the aperture magnitudes were calculated on these smoothed images while the isophotal magnitudes were calculated on the un - smoothed images .",
    "a 3 diameter aperture was used for the photometry .",
    "an annulus with an inner radius of 6 and outer radius of 12 was used for sky subtraction .",
    "the 5 sigma limiting magnitude cut was calculated using aperture magnitudes on the un - smoothed image to avoid losing faint objects .    for the @xmath3 band data we included archival data to increase the depth @xcite .",
    "these data had better seeing ( 0.71 compared to 1.18 ) ; however they did not cover our entire field .",
    "furthermore these data were taken with extremely long exposures which become non - linear at @xmath3022nd magnitude to avoid position dependent image quality and saturation , we reduced the archival data separately and scaled them to have matching photometry .",
    "where archival data existed and was unsaturated , it was used for the shape measurements .",
    "photometry was performed on the two images separately and the fluxes combined using a weighted mean .",
    "the hdf - n is a heavily observed area of the sky with extremely accurate photometry in many bands .",
    "many objects have known redshifts and spectral energy distributions making it easy to check the accuracy of our photometry .",
    "furthermore it is difficult to accurately measure standard stars with suprime - cam because of the size of the telescope and overheads involved .",
    "obtaining photometry on other telescopes would introduce problems similar to those in using the existing photometry .",
    "as such we have chosen not to use standard stars , but rather calibrate the data using the existing photometry .    to obtain accurate absolute photometry in the ab system we matched our photometry to the hdf - n photometry of @xcite who carefully corrected for many subtle photometric effects in the hdf - n data .",
    "we converted the fluxes in the fernndez - soto et al .",
    "catalog to our filter system by linearly interpolating the flux between the hdf - n filters . the effective wavelength of the filters were used for the interpolation .",
    "this method weights by transmission so any overlap between the @xcite filters and ours should be accounted for .",
    "we then compared our isophotal fluxes to the ones we interpolated and scaled them to match . since the fernndez - soto et .",
    "fluxes were measured in an isophotal aperture , they vary systematically in magnitude with respect to the flux measured in a fixed aperture .",
    "to prevent this from introducing filter dependent offsets in our aperture fluxes we used the same magnitude range of 22 - 24 @xmath31 in the @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and @xmath6 bands when comparing our aperture photometry to the fernndez - soto et .",
    "al . photometry . in the @xmath7 band",
    "we were forced to use a range of 22 - 23.5 because of the shallower data .",
    "this may have introduced a small bias in our photometry for this band .",
    "we then scaled the aperture magnitudes to total magnitudes by comparing our isophotal and aperture fluxes for point sources in the @xmath5 band .",
    "@xmath5 band was chosen because it had the best image quality of the red bands and closely approximated the @xmath32 filter used in the hdf - n . to quantify the error in our zero point determination we measured the rms scatter between our isophotal magnitudes and those of fernndez - soto et .",
    "the rms scatter is 0.19 magnitudes which corresponds to and average error of 0.03 magnitudes in our photometric zero points exact numbers for all bands are given in table [ photometry offsets ] .",
    "figures [ abs phot1 ] and [ abs phot2 ] compares our final photometry to the interpolated photometry of @xcite .    since an extensive catalog of spectroscopic redshifts @xcite exists for this field it is possible to compare our photometry to galaxy templates",
    "this comparison was done using the photometric redshift code of @xcite which includes a calibration mode .",
    "first a best fit template at the known redshift was found for each object .",
    "the templates of @xcite and @xcite were used .",
    "twenty intermediate spectra were interpolated between the main spectral templates to improve the fits .",
    "then a weighed mean offset was calculated for each filter by comparing our photometry to the template photometry .",
    "these offsets were then applied to our photometry and the process repeated until the offsets converged .",
    "we did not apply offsets the @xmath2 and @xmath5 magnitudes because they are close to the hdf - n @xmath33 and @xmath32 filters respectively and hence we expect them to be correctly calibrated .",
    "the resulting offsets are small and are probably due to inaccuracies in the templates or filter profiles ( see table [ photometry offsets ] ) .",
    "the largest offsets occur in the @xmath4 , @xmath6 , and @xmath7 bands which are also those least like the hdf - n filters .",
    "the large offset in @xmath7 may also be due to the different magnitude range used when scaling the aperture fluxes .      due to the large amount of data",
    "we have broken the catalog into several files which are available on the internetcapak / hdf / index.html ] .",
    "there are two catalogs , one selected in the @xmath4 band and the other in the @xmath6 band .",
    "objects with an aperture magnitude error smaller than 5 sigma on the un - smoothed images in the selecting band were included .",
    "if an object was present in both catalogs it was removed from the @xmath6 catalog .",
    "each object has a unique i d within each catalog , but both the @xmath4 and @xmath6 catalog begin at 1 . our data covers up to 0.4 square degrees in some bands , however around the edges the coverage is un - even , the astrometry may be distorted ( see  [ s : astrom ] ) , and the detections become unreliable due to cosmic rays , reflections and other defects which could not be removed . as such we avoided these regions for our scientific objectives .",
    "all results in this paper are from the central 0.2 square degrees where the data is of equal depth in the @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and @xmath6 bands .",
    "since others may find it useful we have included data for the entire field in supplementary files with the same formatting and content as the main catalog .",
    "however we strongly recommend using only the main @xmath4 and @xmath6 catalog containing objects in the central 0.2 square degrees .",
    "no attempt was made to ensure the integrity of the data outside the central area .",
    "each catalog consists of four files , the contents of which are listed in tables [ shape cat],[flag cat],[mag cat],[flux cat ] .",
    "the shape file contains information on the position and morphology of the object output by sextractor .",
    "the flag file contains flags for saturation , overlapping objects , and questionable or bad detections .",
    "the bad flag is set for objects with a full width at half max ( fwhm ) of 0 or with abnormal magnitudes in the selection band .",
    "this flag was intended to mark questionable detections , however some faint point sources may also have been flagged .",
    "the magnitude file contains aperture and isophotal magnitudes along with errors in the ab system for all bands .",
    "we used the sextractor convention of -99 for an object which was outside the field or which could not be measured for other reasons .",
    "badly saturated objects were also given a magnitude of -99 .",
    "objects with negative fluxes were assigned negative magnitudes with the absolute value of the magnitudes corresponding to the absolute value of the flux .",
    "the flux catalog contains aperture and isophotal fluxes along with errors and background levels .",
    "all measurements in the flux file are in nano - janskys ( njy ) .    the area around bright objects has been removed due to false detections and problematic photometry in these areas .",
    "this was done by cutting out circles around usno - a2.0 objects with magnitudes brighter than 15.5 .",
    "a list of these regions and the size of each cutout is provided along with the catalog .",
    "to determine number counts we constructed separate catalogs detected in each color using the un - smoothed images .",
    "we measured fluxes in 3 diameter apertures and applied an aperture correction to each band .",
    "we did not use the sextractor best or isophotal magnitudes because they often act in a non - linear way at low signal to noise .",
    "the correction was calculated by measuring the median offset between sextractor best magnitudes , which estimate total magnitudes , and the aperture magnitudes for objects brighter than 24th magnitude ( see table [ photometry offsets ] ) .",
    "using aperture magnitudes may introduce a magnitude dependent bias in the number counts .",
    "however we saw no evidence that the median correction was changing with magnitude . due to the difficulty in identifying stars at faint magnitudes we have provided both raw counts and counts with stars removed .",
    "objects were identified as stars if they had a value of 0.9 or greater in the sextractor star galaxy - separator .",
    "we did not remove stars in the @xmath7 band because the star galaxy separator was unreliable in that band due to variable seeing across the image .",
    "the number counts shown in figures [ ucountfig]-[kcountfig ] were normalized to a euclidean slope as described in @xcite .",
    "they agree with those reported by other authors .",
    "the sloan digital sky survey counts @xcite were measured in @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 , and @xmath6 which are close to our bands with the exception of @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "the sloan @xmath2 band counts were generated by extrapolating between the @xmath34 , @xmath35 , and @xmath36 bands @xcite .",
    "to facilitate comparisons by future authors we have fit an exponential of the form @xmath38 to our bright end counts where n is in number per square degree per magnitude .",

    "high redshift galaxies have unique colors due to the lyman break at 912   and lyman alpha absorption blueward of 1216 .",
    "we can select theses galaxies by choosing three filters which fall blueward of the lyman break , between the lyman break and lyman alpha line , and redward of lyman alpha respectively .",
    "@xcite successfully uses a set of customized filters to select galaxies at @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",

    "@xcite has also used these criteria on the herschel deep field and hdf - n .",
    "the number and type of object selected are strongly dependent on the filters and selection criteria used . changing these parameters",
    "can severely effect the success in identifying high redshift galaxies and change the redshift range selected .",
    "for comparison to the previous work we need to select the same population as @xcite and @xcite .",
    "however our band passes differ significantly from theirs .",
    "we corrected this by calculating the expected colors for the galaxies they have selected .",
    "these colors are calculated by integrating the galaxy templates of @xcite and @xcite moderated by our filter response profile .",
    "we correct these templates for ly@xmath39 and ly@xmath40 absorption following the prescription of @xcite .",
    "we also calculate the expected colors of stars using the spectral library of @xcite .",
    "we then set a selection criteria which will select similar galaxies to the previous work but avoids stars .",

    "the selection is also shown along with our data in figures [ ubbr ] and [ brri ] .    the surface density we measure using this selection is similar to that measured by other authors @xcite ( see figures [ udropfig],[bdropfig ] and tables [ udrops],[bdrops ] . due to our redder @xmath1 band filter the @xmath11 selection suffers more contamination from stars and low redshift galaxies than that of @xcite .",
    "we attempted to remove stars by selecting objects with @xmath41 and @xmath42 as describe in , however the contamination from galaxies remains . at magnitudes fainter than @xmath43 our measurements are within the one sigma error bars reported by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "our b band counts are consistent with but systematically lower than those of @xcite or @xcite which is likely due to cosmic variance .",
    "the selection at redshifts higher than @xmath12 is significantly more difficult .",
    "the contamination for @xmath11 galaxies comes from low redshift galaxies where the co - moving volume is small . for @xmath44 galaxies the contamination comes from @xmath45 where the effective co - moving volume is very large .",
    "several authors have recently reported the discovery of large numbers of @xmath44 galaxies using color - color selection @xcite .",
    "however we find their two color selection yields a large number of lower redshift galaxies .",
    "figure [ z5selection ] shows an example for a redshift 5.5 galaxy .",
    "elliptical galaxies at @xmath46 have similar colors to a @xmath10 galaxy in the @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and @xmath6 bands .",
    "the only clear difference is in the bluer or redder bands . in particular the use of an @xmath47 selection",
    "will include many low redshift galaxies .",
    "a similar problem will occur at redshift 6 using an @xmath48 selection .",
    "there is no easy solution , either one must go more than three magnitudes deeper in the bluest band than the reddest , or obtain deep near ir imaging , both of which are time intensive for large surveys .        for @xmath44 galaxies",
    "it requires @xmath50 and no detection blueward of the 912  break . using these criteria and our multi - color data we can test the findings of other authors . to test the level of contamination we have restricted ourselves to @xmath51 which is bright enough for the expected contaminating sources to be detected at 2@xmath17 in @xmath1 or @xmath2 bands .",
    "@xcite imaged the same area with suprime - cam in the same @xmath3 , @xmath5 , and @xmath6 filter we used .",
    "however they calibrated their data in a different manner .",
    "we adopted @xmath52 and @xmath53 as our selection criteria .",
    "this avoids selecting @xmath45 galaxies and late type stars .",
    "we find that our counts are consistent with , but lower than the values of @xcite ( see figure [ vdropfig ] and tables [ vdrops ] and [ vdrops_nob ] ) .",
    "moving our selection slightly redder in @xmath48 color increases the number of objects selected , making our numbers more consistent with @xcite .",
    "however all the additional objects are detected in @xmath1 or @xmath2 band .",
    "even when objects detected in @xmath1 or @xmath2 are removed , many of the remaining objects in the acs goods field morphologically appear to be stars ( this will be quantified elsewhere ) .",
    "these results suggest that a combination of @xmath45 galaxies and late type stars are contaminating the @xmath10 selection .",
    "figure [ riiz ] shows that the selection criteria of @xcite is very likely selecting low redshift galaxies or stars .",
    "we find that 95% of the objects selecting using this criteria are detected at 2@xmath17 in @xmath3 .",
    "this selection is particularly problematic since it may include star forming galaxies at @xmath54 where [ ] or [ ] can be mistaken for lyman @xmath55 .",
    "finally the @xmath56 selection used by @xcite , selects objects which are detected at 2@xmath17 in @xmath3 band 53% of the time .",
    "in contrast only 14% of objects selecting using the @xmath57 , @xmath47 selection were detected in @xmath1 band . based on our number counts the probability of an object at 28@xmath58 magnitude falling into a 3 aperture by chance",
    "is 37% in @xmath3 band and 4% in @xmath1 band .",
    "this implies that color selection may be overestimating the number of high redshift galaxies and hence the star formation rates at @xmath44",
    ". we shall give a more extensive discussion of this issue with photometric redshift estimates in a future paper @xcite .",
    "we have compiled a deep , multi - color catalog over 0.2 square degrees in the hdf - n region .",
    "these data will provide an invaluable basis for understanding the formation and evolution of galaxies by providing a large sample of galaxies which can be studied in various ways .",
    "the raw number counts and counts of @xmath11 , and @xmath12 galaxies agree with those of other authors .",
    "however the selection of @xmath44 galaxies suffers from significant contamination by low redshift galaxies .",
    "the current deep blue imaging is required to reliably selected these galaxies and hence estimate the star formation rate .",
