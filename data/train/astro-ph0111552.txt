    "to date , astronomy is a rapidly evolving field , the clearest indication of which is the fact that a many reports in the agn session were rewritten to include spectacular results obtained only a few weeks prior to the start of this conference .",
    "this rapporteur paper covers 192 contributed papers on a range of topics in astronomy drawn from the sessions og 2.x .",
    "the classes of objects covered include supernova remnants ( og 2.2 ) , pulsars and plerions ( og 2.2 ) , active galactic nuclei ( og 2.3 ) , galaxy clusters ( og 2.3 ) , bursts ( og 2.4 ) .",
    "also presented were results on diffuse emission ( og 2.1 ) and on astroparticle physics ( og 2.7 ) . briefly summarized are reports on projects , instrumentation , and analysis techniques ( og 2.5 ) .",
    "since the de - orbiting of the compton gamma - ray observatory ( cgro ) in june 2000 no space - based detector has been operational . during the nineties the energetic gamma - ray experiment telescope ( egret ) aboard cgro was very successful in detecting gev from around 70 agn , 8 pulsars , and 170 sources",
    "not yet identified firmly with known objects @xcite .",
    "egret has also measured the spectrum and the spatial distribution of the diffuse galactic emission with unprecedented sensitivity and resolution @xcite .    the planned successor to egret",
    ", the gamma - ray large area space telescope ( glast ) , will not be launched before the year 2006 .",
    "glast will offer a factor of eight more sensitive area to than did egret , which combined with a much larger field - of - view and a better energy and spatial resolution will provide a sensitivity gain by a factor of thirty compared with egret @xcite .    during the time before glast becomes operational , two initiatives in satellite - based astronomy are planned to provide astronomical data at gev energies .",
    "the italian agile satellite ( astro - rivelatore gamma a immagini leggero ) will offer a sensitive area similar to that of egret and an angular resolution somewhat better than egret @xcite .",
    "the sensitivity of agile as a detector will however be compromised by its limited energy resolution . the alpha magnetic spectrometer ( ams ) ,",
    "an instrument originally devised for the search for antimatter in cosmic rays , will also be able to identify @xcite . for technical reasons ams will mostly detect with energies of a few gev or higher , albeit with a sensitive area and an angular resolution slightly superior to those of egret .",
    "ams can be expected to significantly contribute to our understanding of diffuse galactic emission , most notably the gev excess , but may suffer from limited statistic in studies of point sources .",
    "all gev experiments use pair production in thin foils of high-@xmath0 material to actually detect the .",
    "different techniques are used to track the @xmath1-pairs and to measure their energy , though . in principle",
    "the energy threshold is around 10 mev , but the short range of the pairs and small - angle scattering in the tracker significantly deteriorate the detector performance below 100 mev . towards high energies self - vetoing and",
    "the finite thickness of the calorimeter can reduce the quality of measurement .",
    "the main problems with satellite - based detectors , however , are the technical constraints which prohibit satellite payloads with an effective area of much more than a squaremeter .",
    "the flux of all cosmic sources falls off with photon energy and therefore the scientific return of the detectors at high photon energies is limited by statistics rather than inapplicability of the technique of measurement .",
    "glast will have an effective high energy limit of a few hundred gev .",
    "photons with energies of a hundred gev or higher generate electromagnetic showers in the earth atmosphere .",
    "the secondary particles thus produced move faster than the phase velocity of electromagnetic light and therefore emit optical erenkov - light that can be measured with suitable telescopes .",
    "existing imaging erenkov telescopes such as whipple @xcite , cat @xcite , hegra @xcite , cangaroo @xcite , or tactic @xcite have energy thresholds between 300 gev and 2 tev , but a sensitive area @xmath2 , because the atmosphere is used as the interaction site .",
    "forthcoming or planned experiments will have lower energy thresholds and hence a higher sensitivity than the existing installations . commencing operations in 2002 , magic @xcite and veritas @xcite will observe the northern hemisphere while h.e.s.s . @xcite and cangaroo iii @xcite will study the southern sky .",
    "the magic project will use a single large telescope optimized to provide a low energy threshold of 1030 gev , whereas the other three observatories will use multiple telescopes to simultaneously measure the erenkov - light of a shower , thus providing a very good hadron rejection and an excellent energy resolution .",
    "non - imaging observatories such as celeste @xcite , stacee @xcite , solar-2 @xcite , graal @xcite , and pact @xcite are now becoming operational .",
    "the very large mirror area of these observatories makes for a very low energy threshold of less than 30 gev with large effective area , but the shower reconstruction and the hadron rejection are more difficult than for imaging observatories , for only the arrival time of the erenkov shower front can be measured .",
    "all these erenkov telescopes provide a very good point source sensitivity , which allows to measure source variability on time scales of around one hour @xcite .",
    "however , only one source can be observed at a time , and therefore the actual measurement of interesting behaviour of a source requires either luck or an indication of activity from other resources .",
    "the atmospheric erenkov telescopes are thus rather complementary to glast or to monitoring devices in the tev energy range such as milagro , which experiment detects from a field nearly @xmath3sr in extent by measuring erenkov - light of shower particles in a water pond @xcite . a second significant advantage of milagro is the high duty - cycle of @xmath4 100% compared with the @xmath4 10% duty cycle of sunlight and moonlight limited observations with atmospheric erenkov telescopes .",
    "the same is true for air shower arrays such as the tibet air shower array @xcite or argo - ybj @xcite , which are composed of an array of particle detectors to measure the secondary particles in air showers produced by .",
    "the number and quality of upcoming observatories offer good prospects for the future .",
    "not only that the individual experiments will be much more sensitive than their predecessors , also the energy range of satellite - based and ground - based observatories will overlap , thus eventually providing complete coverage of the spectra of sources from some 50 mev to 10 tev .",
    "the previously uncharted part of the spectrum , energies between 10 gev and 300 gev , is particularly interesting , because leptonic emission from supernova remnants should show a spectral peak in @xmath5 representation , because competing models for emission from pulsars predict different spectra , and because the infrared background light out to a redshift of @xmath6 should be measurable by virtue of absorption effects in agn spectra .",
    "why is it interesting to study diffuse galactic ?",
    "this emission is produced in interactions of cosmic rays with gas and ambient photon fields and thus provides us with an indirect measurement of cosmic rays in various locations in the galaxy .",
    "a significant fraction of the diffuse galactic is supposedly produced in decays of neutral pions following inelastic collisions of cosmic ray nucleons .",
    "leptonic emission is particularly important at energies below 100 mev , where bremsstrahlung is presumably the main emission mechanism .",
    "inverse compton scattering of relativistic electrons on soft ambient photons is expected to provide with a hard spectrum , thus eventually dominating over the @xmath7-decay at high energies @xcite .",
    "measurements of diffuse galactic tev therefore constrain the cosmic ray electron spectrum at multi - tev energies .",
    "recent observations made with the egret instrument on the compton gamma - ray observatory of the diffuse galactic emission reveal a spectrum which is incompatible with the assumption that the cosmic ray spectra measured locally hold throughout the galaxy @xcite .",
    "the spectrum observed with egret below 1 gev is in accord with , and supports , the assumption that the cosmic ray spectra and the electron - to - proton ratio observed locally are uniform , however , the spectrum above 1 gev , where the emission is supposedly dominated by @xmath7-decay , is harder than that derived from the local cosmic ray proton spectrum .",
    "this is the well - known gev excess .",
    "[ tb ] , @xmath8 vary depending on what fraction of is assumed to be due to diffuse galactic emission @xcite .",
    "label 1 refers to all , label 2 to an independent data set for background subtraction , and label 3 to @xmath9 data as background estimate .",
    "also shown is the egret flux for @xmath10 , @xmath8 , whipple upper limits for @xmath11 , @xmath12 @xcite , and the tibet upper limits @xcite .",
    "the upper limits weakly depend on the spectral index in the respective energy range .",
    "the dotted line is an extrapolation of the egret spectrum with an index of 2.5 .",
    "the dashed line refers to a model calculation by @xcite that is explained in the text.,title=\"fig:\",width=321 ]      an interesting question is whether or not the gev excess extends to tev energies .",
    "whipple and hegra have observed a small field in the galactic plane at @xmath13 .",
    "the resulting spectrum of the diffuse emission in that field is shown in fig.[lampeitl ] .",
    "an upper limit at 10 tev from the tibet array is also shown , which however can not directly be compared with the results from the imaging erenkov telescopes , for it represents the flux from a much larger part of the sky .",
    "the same restriction applies to new results from the tibet ii and tibet hd arrays presented at this conference @xcite .",
    "the upper limits for diffuse galactic emission in the tev energy range slightly depend on the spectral index in the respective energy range .",
    "they also depend on what fraction of observed is attributed to the galactic emission .",
    "nevertheless it appears that the spectrum of diffuse galactic radiation between a few gev and a tev can not be harder than a power law with a photon index of @xmath42.4 , which constrains published models of the gev excess .",
    "@xcite have argued that the local cosmic ray electron spectra would not be representative for the galaxy , if the electron were solely accelerated in supernova remnants ( snr ) .",
    "if the average electron spectrum in the galaxy is harder than that measured locally , then the correspondingly hard spectrum of the inverse compton component could explain the gev excess .",
    "the same basic conclusion was drawn in a later study by @xcite . in these models",
    "the inverse compton spectrum is harder than @xmath14 at a few gev and displays a slow softening at higher energies arising from the transition from the thomson regime to the klein - nishina regime for infrared target photons .",
    "the inverse compton spectrum would therefore violate the upper limits from whipple , hegra , and tibet , if the snr as the assumed sources of cosmic ray electrons would produce single power law particle spectra extending to electron energies higher than about 10 tev .",
    "the available evidence for electrons with energies of 10 tev or higher in snr comes from observations of non - thermal x - ray continua which are interpreted as synchrotron radiation @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to note that for all snr the observed non - thermal x - ray flux is below extrapolations of the radio synchrotron spectrum @xcite , which indicates that snr do not produce electrons with single power law particle spectra extending to electron energies higher than about 10 tev .",
    "the upper limits for diffuse galactic tev are therefore not in conflict with hard inverse compton models of the gev excess .",
    "it is possible that cosmic ray nucleons also contribute to the gev excess . @xcite",
    "have calculated the yield of cosmic rays before escape from their sources .",
    "the spectrum produced within the sources would be harder that of truly diffuse galactic and thus unresolved sources of cosmic rays should contribute significantly at tev energies , but would presumably not explain the gev excess ( see fig.[lampeitl ] ) .",
    "@xcite have investigated a dispersion in the cosmic ray source spectra such that the snr would produce power - law spectra with varying indices .",
    "then the interstellar cosmic ray spectrum should display a curvature which could explain the gev excess , provided the spectral dispersion in the sources is sufficiently strong .",
    "speculative though bschings model may appear , the radio spectra of snr indicate that a spectral dispersion exists @xcite , if somewhat smaller than required to explain the gev excess in total .",
    "if his model was right , then the upper limits for the tev intensity would require cosmic ray source spectra modified or cut off at about 100 tev .",
    "@xcite have discussed the hard x - ray and soft emission from the galactic ridge , which , if interpreted as diffuse emission and not caused by unresolved sources , indicates the presence of a substantial flux of low energy cosmic rays .",
    "these authors find electron bremsstrahlung more likely than proton bremsstrahlung as the main radiation mechanism .",
    "more likely though an electron origin appears , the required cosmic ray electron source power would exceed the kinetic power provided by supernovae and ob stars , suggesting that the 10 kev  200 kev continuum emission from the galactic ridge is still far from being understood .",
    "snr are considered the most likely sources of galactic cosmic rays , either as individual accelerators or by their collective effect in superbubbles @xcite .",
    "observational evidence in favor of this scenario has been found only for cosmic ray electrons , not for the nucleons .",
    "[ tb ]     three shell - type snr have been detected at tev energies so far .",
    "sn  1006 has been reobserved with cangaroo with a flux consistent with the previously published result @xcite .",
    "also in the new observations only the north - eastern rim is seen in tev .",
    "recent observations of rx  j1713 - 3946 with the 10m - telescope cangaroo - ii have yielded a detection with about @xmath15 significance and have thus confirmed the earlier measurement @xcite .",
    "the hegra array of erenkov telescope has detected tev from cassiopeia  a @xcite , if with 0.03  crab above 1 tev at a flux much lower than those reported for the two southern remnants .",
    "all three shell - type snr detected so far show non - thermal x - ray emission , which presumably is synchrotron radiation .",
    "it is known that the synchrotron radiating electrons would inverse - compton scatter the microwave background to tev energies with a flux depending only on the x - ray flux and the magnetic field strength within the remnant @xcite , provided both are measured at photon energies corresponding to the same electron energy .",
    "for the two southern remnants sn  1006 and rx  j1713 - 3946 a significant contribution of from hadronic interactions appears unlikely on account of the low density environment in which the remnants reside .",
    "we have already noted that for all snr the observed non - thermal x - ray flux is below the extrapolation of the radio synchrotron spectrum @xcite , implying a cut - off in the cosmic ray electron spectrum . the actual cut - off energy would depend on the magnetic field strength , for it is measured in synchrotron frequency",
    ". the interesting question of whether or not the cut - off would be caused by energy losses , implying whether or not a similar cut - off must be expected in the cosmic ray nucleon spectra , is also a question of the magnetic field strength , for synchrotron radiation is the main energy loss channel .",
    "two important issues need to addressed :     are the x - ray and tev spectra of sn  1006 and rx  j1713 - 3946 compatible with each other in the sense of both being produced by the same particles ? if that was the case , it would confirm our notion of an inverse compton origin of the and we could indeed use the tev flux as a measure of the magnetic field strength .     is the magnetic field strength thus determined such that the high energy cut - off in the electron spectra can be caused by synchrotron energy losses ?",
    "if that was not the case , the cause of the cut - off would have to be intrinsic to the actual acceleration process and therefore also affect the cosmic ray nucleon spectra , which then would not be single power laws up to the knee at a few pev .    @xcite find the spectrum of sn  1006 between 1.5 tev and 20 tev well described by a power law @xmath16 @xmath17 when assuming a power law with exponential cut - off for the electron spectrum a fit of the combined radio , x - ray and data is obtained with a cut - off energy @xmath18tev and a magnetic field strength @xmath19 g ( see fig.[tani - fig ] ) . @xcite",
    "have carefully analyzed the x - ray spectrum between 0.12 kev and 17 kev and find that the best model includes a thermal component and a broken power law component ( @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and the break energy @xmath22kev ) to describe the non - thermal continuum .",
    "given the best - fit @xmath19 g of @xcite , a energy of 5 tev would correspond to an x - ray energy of 0.4 kev . based on their findings for the non - thermal part of the x - ray spectrum and the earlier measurements @xcite , @xcite",
    "have also presented a fit to the multi - band spectrum of sn  1006 . with their parameters",
    "@xmath23 g and @xmath24tev a energy of 5 tev would correspond to an x - ray energy of 1 kev .",
    "the spectrum measured with cangaroo is statistically well defined below 10 tev and thus has to be compared to the low energy x - ray spectrum with which it agrees .",
    "the compatibility of the x - ray and spectra of sn  1006 supports our notion of an inverse compton origin of the .",
    "a confirmation would require the observation of corresponding curvature in the x - ray and tev spectra , though .",
    "the magnetic field strength of @xmath19 g found by @xcite is disturbingly low , for the magnetic field in the rim should be compressed . the local upstream field around sn  1006 would have to be @xmath25 g depending on orientation .",
    "we can calculate the e - folding acceleration time for diffusive shock acceleration with the diffusion coefficient @xmath26 , @xmath27 , written in units of the bohm diffusion coefficient @xmath28 with @xmath29 as the larmor radius of the electrons .",
    "then @xmath30 @xmath31 the acceleration time is similar to the age of the remnant for bohm diffusion , i.e. @xmath32 . in the general case @xmath33",
    "the diffusive shock acceleration would not operate sufficiently rapid to provide electrons with 50 tev within the age of sn  1006 .",
    "if the magnetic field strength was substantially higher than @xmath34 g , the acceleration time would be correspondingly smaller . as a result electron acceleration to 50 tev within the time",
    "given would appear more feasible .",
    "@xcite have combined hydrodynamical calculations of the evolution of a young shell - type snr with an algorithm , which simultaneously calculates the associated particle acceleration in the test - particle approximation .",
    "these authors have not modelled the tev spectrum in parallel to the x - ray spectrum .",
    "nevertheless , they find that at an age of 1000 years a substantial fraction of accelerated electrons would have escaped from the regions of compressed magnetic field in the rims of sn  1006 . while all electrons would comptonize the microwave background to tev energies , only a fraction of them",
    "would emit synchrotron radiation in a high magnetic field region .",
    "it is actually possible to obtain a fit to the multi - band spectrum of sn  1006 by assuming that the magnetic field occupies only 40% of the volume filled with cosmic ray electrons @xcite . in this case",
    "the best - fit parameters would be @xmath35 g and @xmath36tev .",
    "the electron energy loss time scale for synchrotron radiation at the energy @xmath37 would be 900 years and thus similar to the age of the remnant . the acceleration time ( eq.[tauacc ] )",
    "would be similar or smaller than both the age and the energy loss time for a diffusion coefficient @xmath38 @xmath39 which would comfortably allow diffusive shock acceleration to accelerate electrons to the energies observed for a fair range of intensities of electromagnetic turbulence .",
    "@xcite have assumed the extreme case of a vanishing magnetic field in part of the volume .",
    "a realistic scenario would foresee a compressed magnetic field in the rims of the remnant and a lower ( by a factor of a few ) magnetic field strength outside the rims of sn  1006 .",
    "then we can expect @xmath40 g in the rims , @xmath41tev , and @xmath42 .",
    "we can therefore conclude that the electron spectrum in sn  1006 is probably not significantly modified by energy losses on account of the energy loss time being similar or larger than the age of the remnant .",
    "if cosmic ray nucleons were accelerated in parallel to the electrons , their spectrum would presumably show the same cut - off energy @xmath37 as does the electron spectrum .",
    "is it possible that during the later evolution of sn  1006 nucleons are accelerated to the knee at a 1000 tev ?    in the standard hydrodynamical model of snr",
    "their evolution has a first phase , in which the expansion proceeds with constant velocity , followed by the so - called sedov phase , during which the outer shock decelerates .",
    "the deceleration of the shock causes diffusive shock acceleration to operate less efficiently ( see eq.[tauacc ] ) , so that the maximum particle energy can increase only by a factor of a few during the sedov phase .",
    "the question whether or not sn  1006 can accelerate cosmic ray nucleons to the knee is therefore linked to the question whether or not sn  1006 is already in the sedov phase ; a question to which i can not give a firm answer .",
    "the supernova remnant cassiopeia a differs from sn  1006 and rx  j1713 - 3946 in that the supernova blast wave is expanding into a wind bubble and shell system from the previous wind phases of the progenitor star @xcite .",
    "the matter density and the magnetic field strength in the upstream region of the outer shock are those of a red supergiant wind and not those commonly found in the interstellar medium .",
    "cas  a also shows a non - thermal hard x - ray continuum @xcite , which would imply high energy emission from inverse compton scattering .",
    "however , we must expect that both the flux and the cut - off energy in the spectrum are much less than for sn  1006 and rx  j1713 - 3946 on account of the much higher magnetic field strength in cas  a , for which estimates for the magnetic field strength at the shock and in the downstream region suggest @xmath43 mg @xcite .",
    "[ tb ]   error range for the measured spectral distribution under the assumption of a power law spectrum . also indicated are the upper limits measured by egret , whipple @xcite , and cat @xcite .",
    "the data are compared with model predictions published by @xcite .",
    "the dotted curve represents a model spectrum for the flux arising from @xmath7-decay .",
    "the solid and the dashed line show the predicted inverse compton plus bremsstrahlung spectra for two different parameter sets.,title=\"fig:\",width=321 ]    the measured flux and spectrum of cas  a are shown in fig.[casa - fig ] .",
    "because of the moderate statistical significance of the overall detection , the spectral index is only poorly constrained .",
    "also shown in the figure are model spectra based on calculations by @xcite . to be noted from the figure",
    "is that the predicted flux from @xmath7-decay exceeds the observed flux ( the prediction was made prior to the actual detection ) .",
    "the problem is that the expected absolute flux level of @xmath7-decay is not well determined in the context of general acceleration models .",
    "one of the crucial but poorly known parameters is the injection efficiency , with which suprathermal protons are injected at the shock front .",
    "in contrast to the electrons , for which the non - thermal x - ray flux can be used as a primer for the electron flux , whatever the micro - physics at the acceleration site , the high energy cosmic ray nucleons do not reveal themselves in any observable channel other than emission .",
    "the injection efficiency does affect the overall efficiency of snr in transferring their bulk kinetic energy to a few high energy cosmic rays .",
    "a high injection efficiency , as assumed by @xcite , would provide snr with sufficient cosmic ray source power to constantly replenish the galactic cosmic rays .",
    "the data of cas  a suggest that some crucial parameters of the acceleration process are actually less favorable than assumed in the theoretical studies .",
    "to date we can not say , whether or not the tev data are in conflict with our notion that snr accelerate the bulk of cosmic ray nucleons to pev energies , but the situation is getting tight",
    ".    a high cosmic ray density in the remnants also implies backreactions of the cosmic rays on the acceleration process , one of which is a modification of the shock compression ratio caused by the pressure and energy density of the cosmic rays . @xcite",
    "have presented a calculation of non - linear particle acceleration in cas  a. they have determined the injection rate for electrons by a fit of the radio to x - ray spectrum . the proton injection required to fit the observed tev spectrum of cas  a would be more than an order of magnitude less than the electron injection rate at the same energy .",
    "it has been suggested that in a quasi - perpendicular shock electrons can be efficiently injected , whereas proton injection is suppressed @xcite . on the other hand , turbulence in the progenitor wind and at the interface with swept - up material",
    "should lead to many field lines being locally shock - parallel , thus allowing efficient proton injection at some parts of the shock .",
    "clearly , more studies of the microphysics of particle injection at the shocks are needed .",

    "hegra has established a very low 3@xmath44 upper limit of 0.03 crab above 1 tev @xcite . in x - rays tycho",
    "shows a thermal spectrum with strong lines and a bremsstrahlung continuum , but also a hard x - ray tail @xcite , which presumably is of non - thermal origin .",
    "if we interpret the apparently non - thermal x - ray emission as synchrotron radiation , the upper limit for the tev flux implies a lower limit for the magnetic field strength with @xmath45 g , when the hard x - ray tail is extrapolated to lower x - ray energies , or @xmath46 g , when the non - thermal x - ray flux is estimated by modelling asca data @xcite .",
    "@xcite have used a nonlinear kinetic model of cosmic ray acceleration similar to the one applied to cas  a @xcite to describe the properties of tycho s snr and to model the emission .",
    "these authors argue that a magnetic field strength @xmath47 g in the upstream region and consequently @xmath48 g in the downstream region is required to reproduce the synchrotron spectrum from radio to x - ray frequencies . in such strong magnetic fields",
    "high energy electrons in the downstream region are subject to radiative energy losses on a time scale much shorter than the age of remnant .",
    "therefore the electron spectrum displays a turnover to a softer power law at about one tev with a spectral index change @xmath49 .",
    "the spectral indices of the tev scale spectra of inverse compton scattering and @xmath7-decay are then similar , however , the inverse compton spectrum cuts off at a much smaller energy than does the @xmath7-decay spectrum , as shown in fig.[tycho - fig ] . as in case of cas",
    "a the expected hadronic flux exceeds the observed value or limit , if for tycho only by a factor of ten .",
    "presumably the cause of that discrepancy is the same in both cases .",

    "egret has left a legacy of about 170 sources not yet identified firmly with known sources .",
    "various population studies have been performed to search for correlations with classes of galactic objects .",
    "it has been noted only recently that very much care has to be exercised in these studies to account for systematic effects arising from the uneven exposure distribution and the structured galactic foreground emission @xcite .",
    "searches for tev in the egret error boxes have not been successful so far @xcite .",
    "it has been suggested that some of the unidentified egret sources are snr @xcite .",
    "a careful study shows that the spectra of well observed snr candidates , associated with cta 1 , w28 , ic443 , and @xmath50 cygni , are suggestive of a pulsar origin rather than young cosmic rays in shell - type snr @xcite .",

    "eight pulsars have been identified in the egret data on account of pulsed emission .",
    "there are two competing models for the production of pulsed : the polar cap model @xcite and the outer gap model @xcite , which may be observationally distinguished in the energy range between 3 gev and 30 gev .",
    "the extent of pulsed emission to very high energies is a unique prediction of the outer gap models , and is not permitted by polar cap models .",

    "will operate with substantially lower energy thresholds , as will do magic , and thus will allow observational tests of the outer gap models .",
    "there are a handful of pulsar - powered snr with synchrotron nebula , so - called plerions .",
    "the crab nebula is the prototype plerion and serves as a standard candle in high energy astrophysics .",
    "unpulsed emission , which is commonly interpreted as being caused by inverse compton scattering , can be detected up to about 20 tev @xcite .    in case of psr 1706 - 44/g343.1 - 2.3",
    "the energy density of the synchrotron radiation in the nebula is less than that of the microwave background . because the latter is known , quantitative estimates of the unpulsed tev emission can be made @xcite .",
    "earlier measurements of psr 1706 - 44 with cangaroo @xcite and the durham mk6 telescope @xcite have indicated a tev flux , which is an order of magnitude higher than predicted .",
    "recent measurements with cangaroo ii have confirmed the high flux level and spectrum @xcite , so that our problem to understand the source persists .",
    "why is it interesting to study from active galactic nuclei ( agn ) ?",
    "these sources show very intense emission , which in many cases is variable .",
    "the variability has been observed on all time scales accessible with the available measurement techniques down to about one hour ( see fig.[khelifi - fig ] ) .",
    "it should be noted that the agn detected in the gev to tev range emit a significant , if not dominant , fraction of their luminosity in the form of , indicating that with measuring we actually study the main energy transfer processes in these objects .",
    "a many studies suggest a flux correlation between x - ray and tev emission of agn , which , if real , would allow a complementary view of the radiating particles , whatever their nature .",
    "tev astronomy also provides means to probe the intergalactic infrared background radiation by measuring the absorption due to photon - photon pair production .",
    "the types of agn detected at high energies , which include flat - spectrum radio quasars ( fsrq ) and bl laceratae objects ( bl lacs ) , are collectively referred to as _ blazars_. the broadband emission from blazars from radio wavelengths to the uv  or even x - rays in some cases  is apparently dominated by highly beamed , incoherent synchrotron radiation produced in a relativistic jet aligned closely to the direction to the observer .",
    "the relativistic beaming results in a strong amplification of the apparent luminosity and a reduction of the apparent variability time scales .",

    "the multiband spectrum of blazars thus has a double hump shape with the second component peaking at energies between a few mev and a few tev .",
    "the underlying radiation mechanism of the high energy component is still the subject of debate , as is the nature of the particles causing the radiation .",
    "nevertheless it has been recognized that inverse compton scattering by the synchrotron radiating electrons should contribute to the component in the multiband spectra of blazars .",

    "the imaging atmospheric erenkov telescopes have observed a handful of blazars in the tev energy range , most of which are bl lacs .",
    "bl lacs are noted for a very small contribution of thermal emission in the optical on acount of the small equivalent width of lines in the spectrum .",
    "it is possible that in bl lacs the ambient soft photon field is much more dilute than in fsrq , implying that internal absorption by pair production would be less efficient and that inverse compton scattering of these photons would not play an important r^ ole , both compared with fsrq and with inverse compton scattering of synchrotron photons produced in the jet , the so - called synchrotron - self - compton ( ssc ) process .",
    "it appears that soft photons from a possibly existing dust torus are particularily important in fsrq @xcite , depending on the geometrical structure of the torus @xcite .",
    "the threshold energy for pair production is identical to the energy at which the transition between the thomson regime and the klein - nishina regime in inverse compton scattering occurs .",
    "@xcite have extended earlier treatments of the problem @xcite and have shown that the transition to the klein - nishina regime causes a turn - over to softer spectra at higher energies , which can seriously compromise interpretations of the spectral energy distribution in the framework of an ssc origin of the high energy radiation .",
    "very little is known on the origin of the radiating particles in the jets of agn .",
    "are the synchrotron radiating electrons the primary particles , i.e. directly accelerated in the jets , or are they secondary particles produced in inelastic interactions of high energy nucleons ? in the latter case neutrinos would be produced in parallel to the . @xcite",
    "have calculated the neutrino yield for a particular model of particle energization in the jet and have found that the detection of neutrinos from agn would be possible with future neutrino telescopes of the icecube class , if the light curves of blazars are used to define the search windows in data space .",
    "the bl lacs mkn 421 and mkn 501 are now regularily observed by many groups .",
    "both sources are usually so bright that well defined spectra can be obtained .",
    "some other bl lacs have been observed in the past , but havent been detected in later campaigns or by other groups .",

    "recently the bl lac 1426 + 428 was detected with whipple @xcite and confirmed with hegra and cat ( in both cases communicated only at the conference ) .",
    "this source is interesting for its redshift of z=0.129 which is about four times that of mkn 421 and mkn 501 , thus allowing studies of the effect of absorption by the infrared background .    not detected in tev scale at all to date are radiogalaxies and quasars @xcite .",
    "searches for possible correlations are a standard tool in astronomy when the basic characteristics of sources have to be understood .",
    "the multiband spectra of blazars typically show a low energy and a high energy component , which are possibly produced by the same particles through different radiation processes , e.g. synchrotron radiation at low energies and inverse compton scattering at high energies",
    ". it may therefore be useful to compare the lightcurves of blazars at the energies at which the components display their peak in emitted power , namely x - rays and tev .",

    "i will come back to this point later .",
    "what conclusion on the physics in the jet of mkn 421 can be drawn given the rapid outburst displayed in fig.[jordan - fig ] ?",
    "a number of authors have dealt with this subject in their presentations and i repeat the main arguments here .",
    "the tev scale outburst has a rise time scale of about one hour and a similar or possibly somewhat shorter decay time scale .",
    "the decay is probably related to energy losses and thus to internal processes .",
    "accounting for relativistic beaming by the doppler factor , @xmath51 , we find the energy loss time scale in the jet frame as @xmath52 the power emitted in x - rays is a significant fraction of the observed bolometric luminosity , therefore under the assumption of a synchrotron origin of the x - rays the electron energy losses can be approximated by those for synchrotron radiation , yielding @xmath53 so that @xmath54 for information travel time reasons the source region has a diameter not larger than @xmath55 given these relations we can ask two questions . what are the source size and magnetic field strength required for the ssc emission not to exceed the observed tev flux ? then , assuming the x - rays are produced in the same volume as are the , what is the optical depth of for pair production with the x - ray photons ?    [ tb ]     let us first deal with the ssc question . in the jet frame the energies of the x - ray and photons can be written in units of the electrons rest mass energy .",

    "@xmath61 please note that @xmath51 could be smaller if the synchrotron energy loss time scale is smaller than the flare decay time scale ( eq.[1 ] ) .",
    "eq.[4 ] indicates that for doppler factors @xmath62 the photons can produce pairs by collisions with the x - ray photons with a cross section of the order of @xmath63 .",
    "the optical depth is approximately @xmath64 so that internal absorption on the x - ray photons is not important , unless @xmath65 .",
    "this does not exclude the possibility of absorption by pair production with optical or uv photons .",
    "it should be noted that the conclusions we have derived are not based on the assumption of a specific radiation process for the tev scale .",

    "that is obviously different : most of the power in a fourier spectrum would reside at time scales around one hour and very little at longer time scales , except perhaps for the outburst on day 5 .",
    "clearly , there is no one - to - one correlation between x - rays and tev .",

    "i do nt know what the underlying process is .",
    "but i do know what the underlying process is not : it is not synchrotron - self - compton scattering in a homogeneous source .",
    "this implies that all deductions of physical parameters based on the assumption of a simple ssc model are of limited value , for the model doesnt apply .",

    "that was disturbing , because at 5 tev or higher an effect of absorption on the infrared background should have been visible on account of lower limits on the infrared photon density in intergalactic space .",
    "of all imaging atmospheric erenkov telescope operational to date , hegra offers the best energy resolution .",

    "high energy can interact with ambient radiation and form an electron / positron pair @xmath70 the electrons would also be highly relativistic and would emit at energies somewhat smaller than the energy of the primary that has produced the pair .",

    "the analysis of the cangaroo data is still preliminary , and thus the results may change beyond what is indicated by the error bars .",
    "these results can be best summarized by stating that they represent either a problem with the data analysis or a scientific sensation , for something would have to be seriously wrong in our understanding of the universe , may it be lorentz - invariance or the relation between redshift and distance or something else .",
    "several models of gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) predict tev scale radiation from inverse compton scattering or other processes with comparable fluence to the well measured mev scale radiation ( e.g. dermer , this volume ) . measuring the vhe component of grbs may be critical to the understanding of the charged particle acceleration . however , the detection of tev emission from grbs is complicated by the attenuation of vhe photons by interaction with the intergalactic infrared radiation , for which the optical depth is around unity for a redshift of @xmath75 at tev energies .",
