    "following a basic construction introduced with the late alfred hill  @xcite the so - called heidi ( high - d for higher dimension , in exchange for susy ) models were recently introduced  @xcite and discussed in a number of conferences  @xcite .",
    "this is a new class of renormalizable models that consist of an extension of the standard model with singlet fields .",
    "the singlet fields can live in higher dimensions @xmath0 , even fractional ones .",
    "nonetheless the theory stays renormalizable when @xmath1 , because one can have terms in the lagrangian that would be super - renormalizable in four dimensions .",
    "since the singlet sector can not be probed directly , the experimental signature shows up through the mixing of the standard model fields and the singlet fields . as a consequence the standard model fields @xmath2 , that normally contain a single particle peak ,",
    "will satisfy a more general spectral representation : d_(k^2)= ds ( s)/(k^2 + s -i )    one has the sum rule  @xcite @xmath3 , while otherwise the theory is not renormalizable .",
    "a typical propagator coming from the mixing with a singlet moving in @xmath0 dimensions is of the form  @xcite : d_(q^2)= ^-1 .    in this formula",
    "@xmath4 is the original lagrangian four - dimensional mass of the standard model field , @xmath5 is the mass of the higer - dimensional field and @xmath6 is the mass scale that describes the low - to - high - dimensional mixing interaction . for a detailed derivation from the lagrangiam we refer to  @xcite .",
    "this corresponds to a spectral density in the continuum :    \\(s ) = - ( / ) ( ) ( s - m^2)^ [ s - m^2 + ( ) ( s - m^2)^ ] ^2 + [ ( ) ( s - m^2)^ ] ^2 .    where we defined = _",
    "lhd^8-d ( - ) and = d/2 - 3 the factor @xmath7 is often left out in the literature and absorbed in the parameters of the propagator .",
    "we kept it here explicitly , so that one can understand formulas for critical dimensions as a limiting case .",
    "the construction can be made for all particle types .",
    "for the higgs scalar there is some tantalizing evidence that this theory corresponds to reality  @xcite .",
    "in a recent paper  @xcite a very similar construction was made and called unparticle physics . also here",
    "there are two sectors of the theory , a singlet sector and the standard model sector .",
    "there are two differences .",
    "the singlet sector is supposed to be conformally invariant and the mixing with standard model particles is through non - renormalizable instead of renormalizable interactions .",
    "the experimental signature is rather similar .",
    "one finds the exchange of fields with a non - trivial spectral density . due to",
    "the assumed conformal symmetry the spectral density[3 ] is of the form : ( s ) s^d_u-2 the following condition was imposed 1<d_u<2 . within the very general class of models where",
    "an exotic singlet sector is coupled to the standard model , imposing such a conformal symmetry is an extra assumption , that is not strictly necessary . since ultimately the interaction with the standard model particles is needed , it is not clear whether such an assumption can be valid for the full theory .",
    "the conformal symmetry presumably breaks down at the scale where the non - renormalizable interactions start playing a role . in the next section",
    "we will show that the unparticle model is a special limit of the heidi models . within the heidi models",
    "the conformal symmetry can be studied in detail . at the same time",
    "one can explain the origin of the relation ( 7 ) .",
    "the starting point is the formula ( 2 ) for the propagator or the spectral density in formula ( 3 ) . in order to make contact with the unparticle model we impose conformal invariance in the singlet sector by putting @xmath8 .",
    "now we take the infrared limit @xmath9 .",
    "if @xmath10 the spectral density and the propagator behave in this limit as ( s ) s^3-d/2 we therefore make the identification d_u=5-d/2 in a somewhat more sophisticated form we can find the same limiting behaviour by taking @xmath11 .",
    "this limit corresponds to a theory with a strong mixing between the higher - dimensional singlet field and the standard model fields .",
    "it is this particular limit m=0 , _ lhdthat describes the unparticle .",
    "this limit precisely reproduces the formulas in  @xcite . from the formula ( 3 ) for the spectral density it is clear that for large enough @xmath12 the exact conformal invariance breaks down , due to the four - dimensional part containing @xmath13 . for very large",
    "@xmath12 the density behaves as : ( s ) s^-5+d/2 , d<8",
    "we are now in a position to discuss in detail consistency conditions for the different possibilities .",
    "let us first assume that we are in the exact conformal model , that is without the @xmath13 in the density .",
    "for the case @xmath10 the spectral density in the infrared is integrable , however not in the ultraviolet .",
    "for @xmath14 it is the other way around .",
    "therefore the completely conformal model is never quite satisfactory .",
    "the situation improves , when we keep the @xmath13 terms , breaking the conformal symmetry due to the presence of standard model fields",
    ". however we still preserve the conformal symmetry in the singlet sector keeping @xmath8 . in this case",
    "the spectral density is integrable in the infrared and the ultraviolet for all values of @xmath0 .",
    "however , if we look at the discrete part of the spectrum there is always a tachyon pole when @xmath15 or @xmath14 , indicating an instability of the model . only in the range @xmath16",
    "can one avoid a tachyon when @xmath17 is small enough .",
    "this explains the origin of the relation ( 7 ) .",
    "so for the range @xmath16 one has a propagator that is behaving regularly enough to be seen as an effective interaction at the tree level .",
    "however the fall - off of the spectral density at infinity is not fast enough to have a renormalizable theory . for this one must have @xmath1 ,",
    "but then as we have seen above the higher dimensional singlet part can not be conformally invariant and we are back to the original heidi models . at the quantum - mechanical level",
    "these appear to be the only consistent theories of this type .",
    "some questions  @xcite raised about the models can be answered .",
    "is there the possibility for the new sector to have standard model gauge interactions ? in a renormalizable model the answer is clearly no . regarding the cosmological consequences it was noted in @xcite that having a higher - dimensional singlet helps in explaining some features of inflation .",
    "this work was supported by the bmbf schwerpunktsprogramm `` struktur und wechselwirkung fundamentaler teilchen '' and by the eu network heptools .",
