    "the macroscopic phenomena of marine landscape are influenced by the interactions between the flow and the motility of bacteria and phytoplankton .",
    "the effect of turbulence on marine life is therefore a key research question that also has relevance on the understanding of the consequences of climate changes .",
    "microorganisms concentrate in the turbulent regions close to the surface and to the sea bed where the level of turbulence is also affected by external factors .",
    "the motion of an individual microorganism is determined by its swimming and by the advection of the fluid , where vorticity and rate of strain re - orient it , and by the response to external stimuli and biases such as nutrient concentration , gravity and light .",
    "depending on the external stimulus , the behavior is categorized for example as geotaxis @xcite , phototaxis @xcite , gyrotaxis @xcite and chemotaxis @xcite , etc .    among the different biases , we consider gyrotaxis .",
    "this bias results from the combination of a viscous torque on the cell body , caused by the flow shear , and a gravitational torque , arising from an asymmetric distribution of mass within the organism ( bottom - heaviness ) .",
    "this induces an accumulation of cells heavier then water at the free surface and the occurrence of a bioconvective instability that develops from an initially uniform suspension without any background flow @xcite .",
    "recent studies consider the interactions between a complex flow and swimming microorganisms .",
    "cellular laminar flows are used by @xcite to study the aggregation of self - propelled particles without taxis : these authors show that the particles concentrate around chaotic trajectories .",
    "clustering is more pronounced for prolate swimmers and higher swimming speeds when particles escape from regular elliptic regions . in this particular case",
    ", spherical particles can not enter these regions if initially outside of them .",
    "the accumulation of swimming microorganisms in chaotic regions of a fluid flow can be advantageous for fast dispersion .",
    "@xcite consider a two - dimensional chaotic vortical flow and show that swimming does not necessarily lead to enhanced particle transport . for small but finite values of the swimming speed , particles can be trapped for very long time near the boundaries between chaotic and regular flow region . in a later study , @xcite",
    "add stochastic terms to the swimmer equation of motion and notice that suppression of transport ( trapping ) will increase dramatically with the addition of these random motions and rotational stochasticity and , more significantly , with elongated particles . at higher swimming speeds ,",
    "elongated swimmers tend to be attracted to the stable manifolds of hyperbolic fixed points , leading to increased transport relative to swimming spheres .",
    "the coupling of gyrotactic particles and a layer with higher shear is studied by @xcite who demonstrated that motility and shear are responsible for the formations of intense thin layers of phytoplankton by gyrotactic trapping .",
    "these layers appear in regions characterized by a vertical gradient of the horizontal velocity that exceeds a critical threshold value : cells cluster in thin layers and tumble end over end .",
    "the coupling between the flow and the swimmers motility may lead to the formation of macroscopic flow features in the more general case of more complex flows .",
    "@xcite investigated how the gyrotactic motile microorganisms aggregate in a steady tgv flow ( taylor - green vortex ) and suggested that the patchiness regimes can be characterized by two non - dimensional parameters : the swimming speed relative to a characteristic fluid speed and the magnitude of the gyrotactic torque .    in this paper",
    ", we will consider the behavior of gyrotactic and non - gyrotactic swimmers in a three - dimensional turbulent flow , as turbulence characterizes the life of microbes in water supply systems , ocean and bioreactors .",
    "as in previous studies , we approximate swimmers as prolate spheroids . the statistics of non - swimming ellipsoidal particles in the turbulent flow can be found in @xcite and references therein .",
    "these studies show that the rotation rate is influenced by alignment , particles orientations become correlated with the velocity gradient tensor , and the alignment depends strongly on the particle shape .",
    "@xcite proposes a fokker - planck model for the orientation of motile spheroids in homogeneous isotropic turbulence and shows that fluctuations in orientation manifest themselves as an increase of the effective rotary diffusivity . @xcite",
    "considered the long - time trajectories of deterministic and stochastic swimmers in shear flows .",
    "these authors simulated stochastic gyrotactic micro - organisms in synthetic turbulence and demonstrate quantitatively the transition between swimming - dominated drift and turbulence - dominated diffusion as a function of the kinetic energy dissipation rate .",
    "@xcite describe the spatial distribution of gyrotactic spherical microorganisms transported by three - dimensional turbulence flows generated by dns ( direct numerical simulations ) .",
    "they show that coupling gyrotactic motion to turbulent flow produces small - scale patchiness ( smaller than the kolmogorov scale ) in the swimmer distribution .",
    "@xcite also examined whether gyrotaxis can generate cell patchiness in turbulent flow using experiments and numerical simulations .",
    "they found that accumulation in downwelling regions is the dominant means of aggregation also in turbulent flow and shows that patchiness is not significantly affected by the taylor reynolds number @xmath0 .",
    "@xcite studied dispersion of gyrotactic algae in turbulent channel flow and quantify the increased diffusivity induced by the turbulent fluctuations .    in this paper",
    ", we document how clustering of prolate swimmers without taxis , observed in simple flows , is destroyed by turbulence .",
    "we then consider gyrotactic microorganisms of different shapes and confirm that bottom - heavy microorganisms accumulate in downwelling flows .",
    "this explains how settling larvae changing the offset of the centers of buoyancy and of gravity can preferentially accumulate in updrafts , favorable for dispersal , or downdrafts , favorable for settlement , thus exploiting the hydrodynamics of the vorticity near the sea bed @xcite .",
    "we finally show that clustering is most evident for spherical shapes .",
    "this suggests that micro - organisms like the dinoflagellate _ ceratocorys horrida _",

    "large swimming velocities are able to counteract the dispersive effect of turbulence @xcite and more elongated particles are associated to a potentially compressible velocity field , being sensitive to the background shear . in summary ,",

    "we first analyze the case of homogenous shear flow in the plane parallel to gravity , with gravity in the direction of the velocity gradient ( @xmath80 ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : a90]@xmath81 reports the period of tumbling versus @xmath77 for the 4 different values of the aspect ratio considered in the turbulent cases above , whereas  [ fig : a90]@xmath60 displays the angle at equilibrium in the @xmath82 plane , with @xmath83 the flow direction and @xmath84 the direction of gravity .",
    "note that the two plots are complementary as either tumbling or an equilibrium angle is observed for each value of @xmath77 considered .",
    "as swimmers are more and more elongated , the tumbling motion is observed to start at larger values of @xmath77 , that is for long reorientation times .",
    "the period of tumbling decreases and approaches that of the jeffrey orbit as @xmath85 . below the threshold value for the occurrence of tumbling , the equilibrium angle increases from zero ,",
    "swimmers almost aligned with the flow , to @xmath86 as @xmath87 , e.g.  swimmers parallel to gravity for strong gyrotaxis .",
    "the figure clearly shows that the transition between gravity - dominated swimming and tumbling - motions shifts to larger @xmath77 for elongated swimmers .",
    "next we consider the case of vorticity and gravity vector forming an angle of @xmath88 , as in @xcite . in this case , no tumbling is observed and the cells tend to orient parallel to the gravitational force for small values of @xmath89 , whereas they are aligned with the vorticity vector for large @xmath89 .",

    "while this accounts for the shift of the maximum accumulation to larger values of @xmath91 in the turbulent case documented above , it does not help to explain the reduced clustering . to this aim",
    ", we report in figure  [ fig : a45]@xmath60 the time evolution of the cell orientation for different initial orientations and the values @xmath92 and @xmath93 right during the transition between gravity - dominated swimming and vorticity - dominated swimming ( same final orientation ) .",
    "elongated swimmers , @xmath31 , react more slowly and approach the equilibrium position at a later time , @xmath94 , whereas spherical swimmers reach their final equilibrium at @xmath95 , where these values correspond approximatively to the mean values computed by varying the initial orientation . the trend shown in the figure ( longer transients for elongated cells )",
    "is observed in the range @xmath96 for the spherical swimmers and @xmath97 for those with @xmath31 .",
    "this range of values is consistent with the values of @xmath57 where maximum clustering is observed in turbulence .",
    "this would imply that in a time - dependent flow elongated swimmers are more unlikely to reach their equilibrium position and their orientation would be determined to a larger extent by the initial condition . as a consequence",
