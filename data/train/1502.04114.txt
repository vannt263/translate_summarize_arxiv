    "during the last decade , a new family of points for bivariate polynomial interpolation has been proposed and extensively studied , namely the so - called `` padua points '' of the square ; cf .",
    "they are the first known optimal nodal set for total - degree multivariate polynomial interpolation , with a lebesgue constant increasing like @xmath0 , @xmath1 being the polynomial degree .",
    "one of the key features of the padua points , that has allowed to construct the interpolation formula , is that they lie on a suitable lissajous curve , such that the integral of any polynomial of degree @xmath2 along the curve is equal to the 2d - integral with respect to the product chebyshev measure .",
    "more specifically , the padua points are side contacts and self - intersections of the lissajous curve .    motivated by that construction , in the present paper",
    "we try to extend the lissajous curve technique in dimension 3 .",
    "since the resulting curve is not self - intersecting , we can not obtain total - degree polynomial interpolation . on the other hand , we are able to generate an algebraic cubature formula for the product chebyshev measure ,",
    "whose nodes lie on the lissajous curve thus forming a rank-1 chebyshev lattice ( on chebyshev lattices cf . , e.g. , @xcite ) .    by such formula we can perform polynomial hyperinterpolation , which is a discretized orthogonal polynomial expansion @xcite , and can be constructed by a single 1-dimensional fast chebyshev transform along the curve . moreover , since the underlying chebyshev lattices turn out to be weakly admissible mehes for total - degree polynomials ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) , we can extract from them suitable discrete extremal sets of fekete and leja type for polynomial interpolation ( cf .",
    "we provide a matlab implementation of the hyperinterpolation and interpolation scheme , and show some numerical examples .",

    "following the lines of the construction of the padua points , the strategy adopted is to seek a lissajous curve such that the integral of a polynomial in @xmath8 with respect to the chebyshev measure @xmath9 is equal ( up to a constant factor ) to the integral of the polynomial along the curve . to this purpose ,",
