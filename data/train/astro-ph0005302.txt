    "the batse experiment on the _ compton gamma ray observatory _ and the study of the afterglows ( e.g. , piran 1999 and references therein ) . have established that the gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) are cosmological @xcite .",
    "even though the distance scale seems settled @xcite , it appears that uncertainties remain in the total energy and the burst rate of grbs @xcite .",
    "these two important issues depend on the level of beaming in grb emission .",
    "that is , the issues critically depend on whether the geometry of the gamma - ray emitting ejecta is spherical or jet - like @xcite .",
    "a number of authors have studied energetics and geometry of the ejecta @xcite .",
    "it is also important to put constraints on the width of the luminosity function by comparing the observed intensity distribution with those predicted by a physical model @xcite .",
    "in essence , the rate , the energy , and the luminosity function of grbs are all closely related to whether or not the geometry of the ejecta is spherical .",
    "two most frequently quoted statistics in grb observations are @xmath1 and @xmath2 , where @xmath3 refers to the peak flux ( or peak count rate ) and @xmath4 denotes the number of grbs with fluxes higher than @xmath3 ( e.g. , yi 1994 ) .",
    "these two quantities contain information on the lumonosity function of grbs and the spatial number density of the sources .",
    "a value of @xmath1 consistent with that of an observed sample is a necessary condition but not a sufficient condition for a luminosity function @xmath5 which is neither directly observable nor theoretically well undertood .",
    "the luminosity function of grbs can be obtained for an assumed source distribution @xmath6 such that the calculated @xmath7 fits the observed distribution , and vice versa .",
    "the density @xmath6 refers to the rate of grbs per unit time per unit comoving cosmological volume .",
    "however , due to the very nature of @xmath8 , which is the convolution of @xmath6 and @xmath5 , one almost always obtains @xmath6 for a given @xmath5 such that the theoretical @xmath7 curve fits the observed intensity distribution .",
    "therefore , in order to extract information concerning @xmath6 or @xmath5 , one has to assume one of these two functions or to develop a techinique to separate the effects of these two unknown functions ( horack and emslie 1994 ; horack et al .",
    "1994 ; ulmer et al . 1995 ; ulmer and wijers 1995 ) .",
    "it is therefore of great interest to construct @xmath5 on the basis of a physical model , which is one of our major goals in this _",
    "letter_. since there remain uncertainties in grb engine models , we focus on the consequences of the conical beaming without specifying how a beam is formed in a physical engine model .",
    "using the first batse catalog of gamma - ray bursts @xcite , @xcite studied the effects of the relativistic bulk motion in a conical beam on the statistics of gamma - ray bursts .",
    "they found that the luminosity function is naturally introduced by the random distribution of the space orientation of the cone axis and that the case of the standard candle is not easily distinguished from that of the beaming - induced luminosity function with a sharp peak .",
    "this is especially the case for large beam opening angle and the large lorentz factor @xmath9 , as one may expect .",
    "different lorentz factors and opening angles however result in non - trivial changes for the distances to grbs and especially the highest redshift of or the maximum distance to the most distant grb for a given sample . for instance , the maximum redshift @xmath10 increases as the ratio of the opening angle to @xmath11 decreases .",
    "we modify the conical beam model by allowing a spatial variation of @xmath9 and the density profile of gamma - ray emitting electrons on the photon - emitting surface of the cone .    from numerical simulations of relativistic jets @xcite and observations of the astrophysical jets @xcite ,",
    "it is clear that jets do have some significant structure in them and the bulk lorentz factors evolve as the jets propagate .",
    "therefore , it is plausible to extend the simplest jet model such as that of @xcite . in a more realistic jet model",
    ", the bulk lorentz factor has a spatial profile at the surface where the observed gamma - ray emission occurs and the spatial electron density distribution is significantly inhomogeneous .    in @xmath12 2 we begin with a brief presention of data we use , which are parts of the batse 4b catalog @xcite , and we describe our conical jet geometry , following @xcite , in @xmath12 3 we present results .",
    "finally , we conclude with summary of our results and discussions in @xmath12 4 .",
    "the batse 4b catalog @xcite provides 1637 triggered grbs detected from 1991 april through 1996 august .",
    "we use the bursts which are detected on the 1024 ms trigger time scale .",
    "we choose the bursts of which peak count rates are above 0.4 @xmath13 in order to avoid the threshold effects ( cf .",
    "mao and yi 1994 ) . of those bursts ,",
    "we select the grbs whose @xmath14 is greater than @xmath15 , which gives a sample of 651 bursts .",
    "the energy range in which the peak flux is measured is @xmath16 .",
    "the peak fluxes of bursts vary by about 2 orders of magnitude in this data set .    throughout this _",
    "letter _ we adopt the simplest cosmological model ; the universe is flat with the density parameter @xmath17 , the hubble constant is 65 @xmath18 , the cosmological constant is absent , all the grbs are standard bursts with an identical power - law spectrum , and the rate of bursts per unit comoving volume per unit comoving time is constant ( cf .",
    "mao and paczy@xmath19ski 1992 ; yi 1994 )",
    ".    in our beaming model , the ejecta is flowing outward relativistically in a cone with the geometrical opening angle @xmath20 .",
    "the observed gamma - ray emission is produced at radius @xmath21 from the central engine where the radiation first becomes optically thin . in the minimal beaming model of @xcite",
    ", the ejected material has the same bulk lorentz factor @xmath9 at this distance and the photon - emitting electrons density at the surface of the cone is uniform . in this _ letter _",
    "those simplifications are relaxed as described below .    in the cylindrical symmetry one may consider the colatitude alone , which is defined by the angle between the line of sight and the symmetry axis of the cone . besides the spherical coordinate system centered on the central engine",
    ", we introduce an auxiliary spherical coordinate system with the @xmath22-axis along the symmetry axis of the cone .",
    "it can be shown that the angle @xmath23 between a position of a direction within the cone and the line of sight is given by @xmath24    the monochromatic flux received by a local observer at a distance @xmath25 from the source , taking the cosmological redshift effects into account , reads @xmath26,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath27 $ ] , @xmath28 and @xmath29 being the speed of light and the hubble constant respectively , and @xmath30^{-1}$ ] , @xmath31 .",
    "and we have used the relation @xmath32 ; here @xmath33 is the corresponding frequency in the comoving frame . in this model",
    "we have ignored the structure of light curves due to the relative time delay of radiation from different parts of the cone , and other complicated cosmological effects .",
    "we define the terms , excluding terms for the cosmological information in the above equation ( 2 ) , as the local peak count rate , @xmath34 the maximum local peak count rate is achieved at @xmath35 and can be obtained analytically : @xmath36,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath37 , and @xmath38 .    based on the randomness of the direction of the cone axis with respect to the line of sight , we obtain the probability function which directly reflects the angle between the line of sight and the direction of the cone , @xmath39 . assuming that the cone is uniformly distributed in space , the probability function for a one - sided cone is given by @xmath40 where @xmath39 is between @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "since the local peak count rate is a function of the orientation of the cone , one may translate the probability function of the cone s angle into the probability function of the local peak count rate .    in order to obtain the luminosity function and compare with observations , we calculate the local peak count rate in a fixed frequency range .",
    "we allow variations of @xmath9 and the electron density at the surface of the cone by introducing a window function for @xmath9 and electron density , @xmath43 .",
    "the window function is axisymmetric with respect to the symmetry axis of the cone .",
    "the window function we adopt is the gaussian function centered at the center of the cone : @xmath44,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath45 is a constant , @xmath20 is a given opening angle , and @xmath46 varies from @xmath41 to @xmath20 .",
    "the probability function of the local peak count rate is shown in figure 1 for three different ratios of @xmath20 to @xmath11 , in the case where @xmath9 is uniform over the photon - emitting surface of the cone . for a fixed @xmath9 ,",
    "as the opening angle increases the peak of the probability of the local peak count rate becomes higher and narrower , as one may expect .",
    "a model with a large value of lorentz factor ( @xmath47 ) essentially provides a luminosity function indistinguishable from that of the standard candle model . for a given value of the ratio , the whole distribution function moves vertically",
    "when the absolute value of the lorentz factor changes .",
    "this is because the local peak count rate is decreasing faster with the angle for larger @xmath9 . in the extreme case where @xmath48 the distribution is a power law with the index of @xmath49 , as expected from the analytical result @xcite .    in figure 2 , we show the probability distribution functions for both the varying bulk lorentz factor and the inhomogeneous electron density .",
    "we assume the axisymmetry of the lorentz factor profile around the cone axis , @xmath50 , and hence the lorentz factor profile could mimic a simplified model for the jet - environment drag . at the center of the cone",
    ", @xmath9 has the maximum value and decreases with @xmath51 . as @xmath9 decreases more steeply with @xmath51 , the @xmath52 shows a smaller peak at @xmath53 , and a higher level of the tail of the @xmath52 .",
    "it is because this type of @xmath9 effectively reduces the average value of @xmath9 over the cone and the effective opening angle simultaneously . for a very narrow window function it essentially reduces to the pencil - beam case .",
    "the photon - emitting electrons are supposed to be distributed according to the @xmath9 distribution such that the local electron number density is inversely proportional to the square of the bulk lorentz factor , @xmath9 .",
    "that is , the electron number density is a function of the angular position in the cone . in this profile , the electron number density increases outwards from the center of the cone , since @xmath9 is a decreasing function . in effect , the cone is reminiscent of the hollow cone .",
    "once the probability distribution is obtained , we are in a position to calculate @xmath7 with an assumed spatial distribution of grbs , @xmath6 . in figure 3 , we compare the cumulative intensity distribution curve produced by our luminosity function with observational data . since the goal of this study is looking at effects of the conic beam with varying distributions of @xmath9 and the electron density over the surface of the cone , we assume there is no source evolution , that is , @xmath54 .",
    "we adopt the power law index @xmath55 of unity instead of 2 ( cf .",
    "mao and yi , 1994 ) .",
    "this is a simplification in a sense that observed grbs show various power - law indices .",
    "this value , however , represents the averaged power law indices of observed grbs @xcite .",
    "all the theoretical cumulative probability distribution with the luminosity functions shown in figure 2 are plotted in figure 3 along with the observed distribution .",
    "the curves shown in figure 3 are best - fit functions determined by the kolmogorov - smirnov ( k - s ) test for each parameter set .",
    "parameters in our model are not sensitive enough to constrain the luminosity function .    for a given set of model paramters",
    ", @xmath10 plays a role of a parameter in the k - s test in that the luminosity function studied here optimizes @xmath7 to fit observational data .",
    "the obtained @xmath10 s in this procedure are shown in the table 1 .",
    "these @xmath10 s obtained with the 4b batse catalog are greater than those for the 1b batse catalog by about @xmath56 on average , which indicates that we are seeing fainter grbs in the 4b batse than in the 1b batse catalog and therefore more distant grbs .",
    "it shows that the redshift of the most distant grbs becomes larger as @xmath9 falls more steeply from the cone center . as shown in the table 1",
    ", our toy models with the narrow gaussian profiles could easily reproduce @xmath10 values as high as the highest reported @xmath57 ( quoted from bulik ( 1999 ) , see references therein ) .",
    "this simple case indicates that the effects of the luminosity function have significant implications on the cosmological spatial distribution of grbs .",
    "it is interesting to see that such a high redshift would be hard to explain in the homogeneous beam model with a constant @xmath6 .",
    "the effects of the gaussian window on the values of @xmath10 are substantial enough for further comments .",
    "the model for a narrow window with @xmath58 gives @xmath59 while the uniform beam model ( i.e. without any variation of @xmath9 ) gives @xmath60 .",
    "the average value of redshifts , @xmath61 , is taken over the cumulative redshift distribution function shown in figure 4 .",
    "the cumulative redshift distribution is defined by @xmath62 where @xmath63",
    "the cumulative redshift distributions shown in figure 4 also indicate that the luminosity distribution induced by the beaming has a significant implication on the grbs distances in the observed samples .",
    "when the beam is sharply peaked at the beam center ( solid curves in the upper panel in figure 4 ) the fraction of the high redshift grbs ( e.g. @xmath64 ) could be as high as @xmath65 while the broad beam case ( e.g. @xmath66 ) essentially rules out any high redshift grbs .",
    "the cumulative distribution slowly decreases with the redshift when the @xmath9 in the conic beam is decreasing rapidly in a sense that grbs are spead out in a broader region beyond the averaged @xmath67 for the highly concentrated beam . that is , the ratio of @xmath10 to @xmath61 is 3.59 and 3.14 when @xmath58 and @xmath66 , respectively .",
    "the beams electron density structure also has a similar effect on the redshifts of grbs .",
    "the effects of the luminosity function have to be explicitly considered when observed high redshift values are interpreted @xcite . for instance , in the standard candle case , a significant probability for high redshift grbs could directly imply a substantial source evolution effect .",
    "however , the beaming induced luminosity function could make this simple interpretation much uncertain @xcite .",
    "the theoretical models for grbs are abundant . despite remarkable progresses in understanding physical mechanisms involved in these models ,",
    "the grb prompt emission mechanisms and engine models have so far been unable to constrain the extent of beaming and the luminosity distribution of grbs .",
    "this in turn has been a major uncertainty in interpreting the observed flux data in terms of the cosmological spatial distribution of the bursts . in this regard",
    ", the present work has shown that the simple beaming models and their resulting apparent luminosity functions have significant effects in interpreting the observed data .",
    "if the grbs are indeed standard candles with a single well - defined luminosity , the spatial distribution of grbs in connection with the cosmic star formation rate could be translated into the cosmological source evolution .",
    "however , the luminosity distributions we have considered affect the maximum redshift and the average redshift significantly .",
    "it is therefore important to derive a theoretical luminosity function for a given grb model .",
    "the jet models we adopted are obviously over - simplified . despite this major drawback ,",
    "the models capture the essential ingredients of the beamed relativistic jets concerning the apparent luminosity function .",
    "one of the major uncertainties is that the jets and grb sources differ greatly and grb luminosities and jets physical conditions are intrinsically different in each source . given the wide range of burst durations and the diverse burst types ( fishman and meegan 1995 , and references therein ) , such a possibility can not be ruled out . if this is indeed the case , our standard source approach is not applicable",
