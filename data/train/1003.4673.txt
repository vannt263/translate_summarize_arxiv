    "it is always worth a moment when teaching stochastic processes to ask the class whether time is discrete or continuous .",
    "it is both , but which aspect is uppermost depends on how we measure , or experience , time  whether our watch is digital or has a sweep second hand , one might say . in continuous time , one encounters analogues of feller s theory above in various probabilistic contexts  e.g . , the server in an @xmath21 queue being idle . in the early 1960s , the feller theory , queueing theory ( in the phase triggered by kendall s work , @xcite ) and john kingman were all young .",
    "kingman found himself drawn to the task of creating a continuous - time version of feller s theory of recurrent events ( see @xcite for his reminiscences of this time)a task he triumphantly accomplished in his theory of _ regenerative phenomena _",
    ", for which his book @xcite remains the standard source . here the role of the renewal sequence is played by the kingman @xmath22-function , where @xmath23 is the probability that the regenerative phenomenon @xmath24 occurs at time @xmath25 .",
    "a continuous - time theory contains within itself infinitely many versions of a discrete - time theory .",
    "for each fixed @xmath3 , one obtains from a kingman regenerative phenomenon @xmath24 with @xmath22-function @xmath23 a feller recurrent event ( or regenerative phenomenon in discrete time , as one would say nowadays ) , @xmath26 say , with renewal sequence @xmath27called the discrete _ skeleton _ of @xmath24 for time - step @xmath28the @xmath28-skeleton , say .    while one can pass from continuous to discrete time by taking skeletons , it is less clear how to proceed in the opposite direction  how to combine discrete - time information for various time - steps @xmath28 to obtain continuous - time information .",
    "a wealth of information was available in the discrete - time case  for example , limit theorems for markov chain transition probabilities .",
    "it was tempting to seek to use such information to study corresponding questions in continuous time , as was done in @xcite .",
    "there , kingman made novel use of the baire category theorem , to extend a result of croft @xcite , making use of a lemma attributed both to golomb and gould and to anderson and fine ( see @xcite for both ) .",
    "while in the above we have limits at infinity through integer multiples @xmath29 , we shall also be concerned with limits through positive rational multiples @xmath30 ( we shall always use the notations @xmath31 and @xmath32 for these ) .",
    "there are at least three settings in which such rational limits are probabilistically relevant :    a.   _ infinitely divisible @xmath22-functions_. the kingman @xmath22-functions form a semigroup under pointwise multiplication ( if @xmath33 come from @xmath34 with @xmath35 , @xmath36 independent , @xmath37 comes from @xmath38 , in an obvious notation ) . the arithmetic of this semigroup has been studied in detail by kendall @xcite .",
    "b.   _ embeddability of infinitely divisible laws_. if a probability law is infinitely divisible , one can define its @xmath39th convolution power for any positive rational @xmath39 .",
    "the question then arises as to whether one can embed these rational powers into a continuous semigroup of real powers .",
    "this is the question of _ embeddability _ , studied at length ( see e.g. ( * ? ? ?",
    "iii ) ) in connection with the lvy  khintchine formula on locally compact groups .",
    "c.   _ embeddability of branching processes_. while for simple branching processes both space ( individuals ) and time ( generations ) are discrete , it makes sense in considering e.g.  the biomass of large populations to work with branching processes where space and/or time may be continuous . while one usually goes from the discrete to the continuous setting by taking limits",
    ", embedding is sometimes possible ; see e.g.  karlin and mcgregor @xcite , bingham @xcite .",
    "in addition , ( i ) led kendall ( * ? ? ? * th .",
    "16 ) to study _ sequential regular variation _",
    "( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "the interplay between the continuous and sequential aspects of regular variation , and between measurable and baire aspects , led us to our recent theory of _ topological regular variation _ ( see e.g.  @xcite and our other recent papers ) , our motivation here .    in section 2",
    "we discuss the relation between kingman s theorem and the kestelman ",
    "borwein  ditor theorem ( kbd ) , introducing definitions and summarizing background results which we need ( including the density topology ) . in section 3",
    "we generalize to a baire / measurable setting the kingman theorem ( originally stated for open sets ) .",
    "our(bi-)topological approach ( borrowed from @xcite ) allows the two cases to be treated as one that , by specialization , yields either case .",
    "( this is facilitated by the density topology . )",
    "the theorem is applied in section 4 to establish a theory of ` rational ' skeletons parallel to kingman s integer skeletons . in section 5",
    "we offer a new proof of kbd in a ` consecutive ' format suited to proving in section 6 combinatorial results in the spirit of van der waerden s celebrated theorem on arithmetic progressions . again a bitopological ( actually ` bi - metric ' ) approach allows unification of the baire / measurable cases .",
    "our work in section 6 is based on a close reading of @xcite , our debt to which is clear .      in this section",
    "we motivate and define notions of contiguity .",
    "then we gather classical results from topology and measure theory ( complete metrizability and the density topology ) .",
    "we begin by recalling the following result , in which the expression ` for generically all @xmath40 ' means for all @xmath40 except in a meagre or null set according to context .",
    "we use the terms baire set / function to mean a set / function with the baire property .",
    "evidently , the interesting cases are with @xmath41 baire non - meagre / measurable non - null .",
    "the result in this form is due in the measure case to borwein and ditor @xcite , but was already known much earlier albeit in somewhat weaker form by kestelman ( * ? ? ?",
    "3 ) , and rediscovered by kemperman @xcite and later by trautner @xcite ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and footnote p.10 ) ) .",
    "we note a cognate result in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* th.2.3.7 ) .",
    "we give a new unified proof of the measure and baire cases in section 5 , based on ` almost - complete metrizability ' (= _ almost complete _ + _ complete metrizability _",
    ", see below ) and a _ generic dichotomy _ given in section 3 ; earlier unification was achieved through a bitopological approach ( as here to the kingman theorem ) in @xcite .",
    "this result is a theorem about additive infinite combinatorics .",
    "it is of fundamental and unifying importance in contexts where additive structure is key ; its varied applications include proofs of classical results such as ostrowski s theorem on the continuity of baire / lebesgue convex ( and so additive ) functions ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) , a plethora of results in the theory of subadditive functions ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) , the steinhaus theorem on distances @xcite and the uniform convergence theorem of regular variation @xcite .",
    "its generalizations to normed groups may be used to prove the uniform boundedness theorem ( see @xcite ) .",
    "recently it has found applications to additive combinatorics in the area of ramsey theory ( for which see @xcite ) , best visualized in the language of colour : one seeks monochromatic structures in finitely coloured situations .",
    "two examples are included in section 6 .",
    "the kbd theorem is about shift - embedding of subsequences of a null sequence @xmath46 into a _",
    "_ set @xmath41 with an assumption of _ regularity _ ( baire / measurable ) .",
    "our generalizations in section 3 of a theorem of kingman s have been motivated by the wish to establish ` multiple embedding ' versions of kbd : we seek conditions on a sequence @xmath46 and a _ family _ of sets @xmath47 which together guarantee that _ one _ shift embeds ( different ) subsequences of @xmath46 into _ all _ members of the family .",
    "evidently , if @xmath48 lies in several sets infinitely often , then the sets in question have a common limit point , a sense in which they are contiguous at @xmath40 .",
    "thus _ contiguity conditions _ are one goal , the other two being _ regularity conditions _ on the family , and _ admissibility conditions _ on the null sequences .",
    "we view the original kingman theorem as studying contiguity at infinity , so that divergent sequences @xmath49 ( i.e.  with @xmath50 there replace the null sequences of kbd .",
    "the theorem uses _ openness _ as a regularity condition on the family , _ cofinality _ at infinity ( e.g.  _ unboundedness _ on the right ) as the simplest contiguity condition at infinity , and @xmath51 as the admissibility condition on the divergent sequence @xmath49 ( follows from regular variation by weissman s lemma , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* lemma 1.9.6 ) ) . taken together , these three guarantee multiple embedding ( at infinity ) .",
    "one can switch from @xmath52 to 0 by an inversion @xmath53 , and thence to any @xmath54 by a shift @xmath55 .",
    "_ openness _ remains the _ regularity _ condition , a property of _ density at zero _ becomes the analogous _ admissibility _ condition on null sequences , and cofinality ( or accumulation ) at @xmath54 the contiguity condition .",
    "the transformed theorem then asserts that for admissible null sequences @xmath56 there exists a scalar @xmath57 such that the sequence @xmath58 has subsequences in all the open sets @xmath59 provided these all accumulate at @xmath54 .    in the next section",
    ", we will replace kingman s regularity condition of openness by the baire property , or alternatively measurability , to obtain two versions of kingman s theorem ",
    "one for measure and one for category .",
    "we develop the regularity theme bitopologically , working with two topologies , so as to deduce the measure case from the baire case by switching from the euclidean to the density topology .",
    "we use the notation @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",
    "likewise for @xmath62 and metric @xmath63 on @xmath64 , @xmath65 and @xmath66 denotes closure in @xmath64 . for @xmath67 given , put @xmath68 .",
    "@xmath69 denotes the ( strictly ) positive reals .",
    "when we regard @xmath69 as a multiplicative group , we write @xmath70 for @xmath64 , @xmath71 subsets of @xmath69 .",
    "call a baire set @xmath67 _ essentially unbounded _",
    "if for each @xmath72 the set @xmath73 is non - meagre . this may be interpreted in the sense of the metric ( euclidean ) topology , or as we see later in the measure sense by recourse to the density topology . to distinguish the two",
    ", we will qualify the term by referring to the category / metric or the measure sense .",
    "say that a set @xmath74 _ accumulates essentially _ at @xmath75 if @xmath76 is essentially unbounded .",
    "( in @xcite such sets are called measurably / baire _ large _ at @xmath75 . )",
    "say that @xmath74 _ accumulates essentially _ at @xmath40 if @xmath77 accumulates essentially at @xmath75 .",
    "we turn now to some topological notions .",
    "recall ( see e.g. ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and 24 ) ) that a metric space @xmath64 is _ completely metrizable _ iff it is a @xmath78 subset of its completion ( i.e.  @xmath79 with each @xmath80 open in the completion of @xmath64 ) , in which case it has an equivalent metric under which it is complete .",
    "thus a @xmath78 subset @xmath64 of the line has a metric @xmath63 , equivalent to the euclidean metric , under which it is complete .",
    "( so for each @xmath81 and @xmath82 there exists @xmath83 such that @xmath84 , which enables the construction of sequences with @xmath85-limit guaranteed to be in @xmath64 . )",
    "this motivates the definition below , which allows us to capture a feature of measure - category duality : both exhibit @xmath86 _ inner - regularity _ , modulo sets which we are prepared to neglect .",
    "( the definition here takes advantage of the fact that @xmath87 is complete ; for the general metric group context see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 5 ) . )        thus @xmath64 almost complete is baire resp .",
    "a bounded non - null measurable subset @xmath64 is almost complete : for each @xmath82 there is a compact ( so @xmath78 ) subset @xmath92 with @xmath93 , so we may take @xmath94 . likewise a baire non - meagre set is almost complete  this is in effect a restatement of baire s theorem :      for @xmath95 baire non - meagre we have @xmath98 with @xmath99 meagre and @xmath16 a non - empty open set .",
    "now @xmath100 with @xmath101 nowhere dense ; the closure @xmath102 is also nowhere dense ( and the complement @xmath103 is dense , open ) .",
    "the set @xmath104 is also meagre , so @xmath105 .",
    "taking @xmath106 , we see that @xmath107 is completely metrizable .",
    "the tool whereby we interpret measurable functions as baire functions is _ refinement _ of the usual metric ( euclidean ) topology of the line @xmath87 to a non - metric one : the _ density topology _ ( see e.g.@xcite ) .",
    "recall that for @xmath41 measurable , @xmath40 is a ( metric ) density point of @xmath41 if @xmath108 , where @xmath109 . by the lebesgue density theorem",
    "almost all points of @xmath41 are density points ( ( * ? ? ?",

    "we mention five properties :    a.   the density topology is finer than ( contains ) the euclidean topology @xcite ) .",
    "b.   a set is baire in the density topology iff it is ( lebesgue ) measurable @xcite ) . c.   a baire set is meagre in the density topology iff it is null @xcite ) .",
    "so ( since a countable union of null sets is null ) , the conclusion of the baire theorem holds for the line under @xmath111 .",
    "d.   @xmath112 is a _",
    "space , i.e.  the conclusion of the baire theorem holds ( cf .",
    "e.   a function is @xmath111-continuous iff it is approximately continuous in denjoy s sense ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the reader unfamiliar with the density topology may find it helpful to recall littlewood s three principles ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ch.4 ) , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 3.6 , p.  72 ) ) : general situations are ` nearly ' the easy situations  i.e .",
    "are easy situations modulo small sets .",
    "theorem [ t:0 ] below is in this spirit .",
    "we refer now to littlewood s second principle , of a measurable function being continuous on nearly all of its domain , in a form suited to our @xmath111-topology context .    for @xmath113",
    "measurable , there is a density - open set @xmath67 which is almost all of @xmath69 and an increasing decomposition @xmath114 into density - open sets @xmath115 such that each @xmath116 is continuous in the usual sense .    by a theorem of lusin ( see e.g.  @xcite ) , there is an increasing sequence of ( non - null ) compact sets @xmath117 ( @xmath6 , 2 ,  ) covering almost all of @xmath69 with the function @xmath19 restricted to @xmath117 continuous on @xmath117 .",

    "put @xmath114 ; then @xmath67 is almost all of @xmath69 , is density - open and @xmath116 is continuous for each @xmath119 .",
    "two results , theorem s below and theorem [ t:1 ] in the next section , depend on the following consequence of steinhaus s theorem concerning the existence of interior points of @xmath120 ( @xcite , cf .",
    "1.1.1 ) ) for @xmath64 , @xmath71 measurable non - null .",
    "the first is in multiplicative form a sharper version of sierpiski s result that any two non - null measurable sets realize a rational distance .",
    "for @xmath121 , @xmath122 density points of their respective measurable sets @xmath64 , @xmath71 in @xmath69 and for @xmath6 , @xmath123 ,  , there exist positive rationals @xmath124 and points @xmath125 , @xmath126 converging to @xmath121 , @xmath122 through @xmath64 , @xmath71 respectively such that @xmath127 .    for @xmath6 , 2 ,   and the consecutive values @xmath128 the sets @xmath129 and @xmath130 are measurable non - null , so by steinhaus s theorem the set @xmath131\\cdot \\lbrack a\\cap b_{\\varepsilon } ( a)]^{-1}$ ] contains interior points and so in particular a rational point @xmath124 .",

    "the lemma addresses @xmath111-open sets but also holds in the metric topology ( the proof is similar but simpler ) , and so may be restated bitopologically ( from the viewpoint of @xcite ) as follows .    for @xmath69 with either the euclidean or the density topology , if @xmath121 , @xmath122 are respectively in the open sets @xmath64 , @xmath71 , then for @xmath6 , @xmath123 , ",
