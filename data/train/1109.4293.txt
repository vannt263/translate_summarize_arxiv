    "it is a challenging issue in physics of unstable nuclei to search for such resonances of two neutron - rich clusters .    in our previous study with the quadrupole deformation ( @xmath12-@xmath13 ) constraint in a framework of antisymmetrized molecular dynamics ( amd ) ,",

    "note that the @xmath1he+@xmath2 and @xmath1he+@xmath9he cluster structures in these states are not weak - coupling cluster states but rather strong coupling ones where a @xmath2 or a @xmath9he cluster is sitting on the head of a deformed @xmath1he cluster . according to the previous calculation , the excitation energy of the @xmath1he+@xmath2 cluster state in @xmath0li is expected to be 2 mev higher than that of the @xmath5be@xmath14 , and hence , it might be a state above the @xmath1he+@xmath2 threshold .    to investigate @xmath1he+@xmath2-cluster states near the @xmath1he+@xmath2 threshold in @xmath0li , we perform gcm calculations with a @xmath1he+@xmath2 cluster model .",
