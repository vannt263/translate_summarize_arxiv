    "single - molecule dna micromanipulations provide a very powerful tool for the study of dna mechanics@xcite , dna - dna interactions@xcite , and dna - protein interactions@xcite . in the case of dna - dna interactions , it was possible to study the reentrant behavior of cation - condensed dna@xcite , and measure accurately the free energy of dna condensation@xcite .",
    "these studies are of great importance to determine the behavior of condensed dna , which is crucial for dna packaging and genomic ejection from viruses@xcite , and also to provide an accurate estimate of the forces involved .    in single - molecule dna condensation experiments ,",
    "a dna molecule is tethered at one end to a surface , and at the other end to a micron - sized bead , which is trapped by magnetic or optical tweezers .",
    "the experimental extension - force curves show that there is a critical traction force , above which the system is fully extended and behaves as a worm - like chain semiflexible polymer , and below which the system progressively folds to a completely condensed state@xcite .",
    "this critical condensation force allows to estimate the attractive dna - dna interaction per unit length .",
    "so far , this was done by neglecting finite size effects for long @xmath1 dna molecules .",
    "dna condensation in single - molecule experiments was already studied theoretically @xcite , but the geometry of the condensed structure was always assumed _ a priori _ to be toroidal .",
    "it is possible however that toroids are not the only possible geometry for the condensate , as was already noticed in theoretical studies of condensation of semiflexible polymers with self - interactions@xcite .",
    "it is therefore interesting to explore the possibility of the appearance of other geometrical configurations in single - molecule dna condensation experiments .    in this paper",
    "we propose to study dna condensation in single - molecule experiments by means of langevin dynamics ( ld ) simulations , together with an analytical model .",
    "the scope of this work is two - fold : on the one hand , to better account for finite - size effects in the estimate of attractive dna - dna interactions using measured critical condensation forces ; on the other hand , to evaluate the possibility of the appearance of the rod - like geometry of the condensate , alongside the well - known toroidal one .",
    "our ld simulation method is based on the work of carrivain et al@xcite , which has been successfully applied to modeling single - molecule dna supercoiling experiments@xcite .",
    "the main advantage of using this technique is its speed and enhanced sampling efficiency , based on ( a ) efficient algorithms to simulate rigid bodies@xcite and ( b ) the global thermostat scheme introduced by bussi and parrinello@xcite . using this method , we are able to observe nucleation of dna condensation within our simulation windows .",
    "the well - known toroidal structure of dna condensates@xcite is not the only geometry that we observe : rod - like structures also appear .",
    "the analytical model we propose is based on the theoretical ansatz proposed by hoang et al.@xcite .",
    "this was developed to study toroidal and rod - like structures of free dna in solution , during crowding- or cation - induced condensation .",
    "we extended the model proposed by these authors to include the presence of a traction force applied at the extremities of the dna . using this model ,",
    "we are able to evaluate the different contributions to the free energy of the system : the bending energy , the surface tension , the bulk attractive force , and the worm - like chain entropic free energy of the non - condensed region of the dna .",
    "we are also able to calculate the critical condensation force at any dna length .    in both our simulations and our analytical model we consistently model the counterions that are present in solution implicitly , using a pairwise attractive potential .",
    "the validity of this approximation is supported by a favorable comparison of our results with experimental data on dna condensation .",
    "the geometry of our system is described in figure [ fig : geometry ] .",
    "is the rod diameter , @xmath2 is the aspect ratio of the rod ; ( c ) toroid - like condensed structure : @xmath3 is the toroid radius , @xmath4 is the ratio between the radius and the thickness of the toroid . [",
    "fig : geometry],scaledwidth=50.0% ]    we describe a polymer of length @xmath5 , tethered at one end to a surface and at another end to a bead . in magnetic tweezer experiments ,",
    "the force @xmath6 acting on the bead is imposed , and the end - to - end distance @xmath7 is measured . in optical tweezers ,",
    "the bead is trapped around a fixed height @xmath8 , and the force is measured .",
    "these two experimental setups correspond to different statistical ensembles : at fixed force ( where we use the gibbs free energy ) , and at fixed end - to - end extension ( where the helmholtz free energy is used ) .",
    "we describe the polymer as a made of two different phases : a condensed phase characterized by a length @xmath9 and an extended phase of length @xmath10 .",
    "we therefore have the following two expressions for the free energy , at fixed force and at fixed end - to - end extension respectively : @xmath11 @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the energy of the condensed phase , @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the free energies per unit length of the worm - like chain phase , in the fixed force and fixed extension ensembles , respectively . in our model , we neglect the entropic contribution due to fluctuations inside the condensed phase : we consider that the condensed phase has a definite conformational structure .",
    "we now discuss separately the contributions from the condensed phase and from the extended phase .",
    "for the condensed phase , we base our model on the recent work by hoang et al.@xcite . here , we report the main results of this study .",
    "more details on the derivation of the following formulas , as well as a discussion on their validity , is reported in the original study@xcite .",
    "the authors model a polymer chain with self - interactions as a chain of spheres of radius @xmath16 connected by rigid bonds , and propose an energy ansatz for the toroidal and rod - like geometry . in our model , we take their expressions , and assign the energy of the condensed phase @xmath13 to one of the two formulas : @xmath17 @xmath18^{-1/3 } l_c^{1/3 } + \\\\    - 2 \\pi \\phi ( d ) d^{-1 } b^{1/3 } \\left(\\gamma+2\\right ) \\left[4\\eta \\left(\\gamma    + 4/3\\right)\\right]^{-2/3 } l_c^{2/3 } + \\\\    + 3 \\phi ( d ) b^{-1 } l_c .",

    "the interaction of the spheres is given by the potential function @xmath20 .",
    "we chose the lennard - jones potential energy function , which is numerically very close to the more realistic morse potential : @xmath21 .",

    "the variable @xmath23 , which represents the inter - monomer lateral distance in the condensed phase , is related to @xmath19 by the following expression : @xmath24 where @xmath25 . finally , @xmath26 is the polymer bending persistence length .",
    "notice that the precise form of the interaction potential was found to be of minor importance in determining the position and length dependence of the toroid / rod transition line in the work of hoang et al@xcite .",
    "we also checked that the morse potential gave little or no difference compared to the the lennard - jones potential in our analysis .",
    "both the toroid and the rod energy functions are a sum of three terms : the bending energy to fold the polymer into its condensed state ( which is @xmath27 ) ; the surface tension ( which is @xmath28 ) , and the bulk attractive energy , which is proportional to @xmath9 . the surface tension and the bulk energy terms are proportional to the amplitude of the attractive potential , @xmath29 .",
    "these terms are derived by supposing that the packing of the polymer in the condensate is hexagonal , so that one can calculate the average number of neighbors in the bulk , and the average number of molecules at the surface .",
    "as we shall see , the dependence of these terms on @xmath9 has important consequences on the equilibrium properties of the system .",
    "the free energy of the extended phase may be expressed using the formula derived by marko and siggia@xcite for the gibbs free energy per unit length of a worm - like chain semi - flexible polymer of length @xmath10 : @xmath30 this expression is used to calculate the relative extension @xmath31 at thermal equilibrium @xmath32    to express the free energy per unit length in the fixed end - to - end extension ensemble , we must perform the legendre transform of @xmath14 : @xmath33 to obtain the force as a function of the extension , we invert the @xmath34 function and we obtain the @xmath35 function .",

    "\\label{eq : lc_star_approx}\\ ] ] this equation depends only on @xmath41 , and not on @xmath7 and @xmath5 separately . therefore ,",
    "in the limit of large @xmath5 we expect @xmath42 to be constant .",
    "this may be translated into the following useful formula , which we will use later : @xmath43    at fixed end - to - end extension , the force acting on the bead at thermal equilibrium is given by : @xmath44 .",
    "\\label{eq : f_fixed_z}\\ ] ] this equation is derived in the appendix .    to obtain the equilibrium structures , we use numerical routines for minimization of multi - variable functions , as implemented in the gnu scientific library@xcite .    to calculate the critical condensation force , we switch back to the fixed force ensemble .",
    "the transition from the fully extended state to the fully condensed state is obtained by equating the chemical potentials of these two phases , at the critical force .",
    "we then obtain the following expression : @xmath45 where in @xmath46 we set @xmath47 .",
    "this equation may be solved numerically to obtain @xmath48 .",
    "since the bending energy and surface tension terms vary as @xmath49 and @xmath28 respectively , in the thermodynamic limit of @xmath50 , we obtain @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the critical force for an infinitely long chain .",
    "our simulation assay is based on the recently published work by carrivain et al@xcite .",
    "we mention here only the most relevant features of this simulation method .",
    "first , it is a simulation of rigid bodies , where the angular velocity is taken into account , and the simulated bodies have an impenetrable volume . in our case ,",
    "the dna is composed by @xmath53 cylinders of length @xmath54 , with a hard - core radius equal to the dna crystallographic radius , and is attached to a magnetical or optical bead , which is treated as a sphere ( see figure [ fig : geometry]a ) .",
    "second , the dna chain is modelled by an articulated system , where the joints act as holonomic contraints of a mechanical system .",
    "forces and torques may be applied at each joint , so to model bending and twisting energies . in our case",
    ", we apply only a bending term , and neglect the twisting contribution , which is irrelevant because the dna molecules are typically nicked in the experiments .",
    "finally , the coupling to the thermal bath is treated using the global thermostat scheme , introduced by bussi and parrinello@xcite .",
    "this allows for fast equilibration of the system and realistic treatment of thermal fluctuations .",
    "we model the bending energy associated to two successive cylinders as : @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the angle formed by the tangent vectors of the two cylinders , and @xmath57 is a constant related to the bending persistence length ( for full details , see reference @xcite ) .    here",
    ", we include the effect of intra - dna interactions , as modelled by the lennard - jones potential equation [ eq : ljpotential ] . in our system , the potential acts between the centers of mass of the cylinders that compose the articulated system .",
    "the lennard - jones radius @xmath22 was chosen so that the minimum of the potential corresponds to 28 .",
    "the full list of parameters used in our simulations is given in table [ tab : parameters ] .    to simulate optical tweezer experiments , we add a potential energy term to the bead , expressed as an isotropic harmonic trap : @xmath58 here , @xmath59 is the stiffness of the optical trap .",
    "typical values of this parameter are of the order of 0.1pn@xmath60nm@xcite . the vectors @xmath61 and @xmath62 are the actual position of the bead , and the position of the center of the force ( which would correspond to the laser focus ) , respectively .",
    "we run an equilibration round of 10@xmath63 steps , using a local langevin thermostat and no inter - monomer potential . after this",
    ", we switch to the global thermostat and turn on the inter - monomer interactions , and perform 10@xmath64 ld steps for production run .      we briefly describe here a few methods we used to analyze the data from our ld simulations",
    ".    * condensate length . * to calculate the length of the condensed region from an ld trajectory , we proceed as follows .",
    "first , we calculate the distance matrix between all the dna segments at a given time step .",
    "that is , calculate @xmath65 .",
    "then we select all segments in which @xmath66 , and @xmath67 .",
    "the number of segments that satisfy this condition , multiplied by @xmath54 , gives @xmath9 .",
    "* free energy . * the free energy of a given state may be estimated by calculating the total energy of the condensate ( lennard - jones potential plus bending energy ) , and adding the worm - like chain contribution of the uncondensed region .",
    "this can be calculated by averaging @xmath9 over the trajectory , and using the expression for the worm - like chain free energy per unit length proposed by marko and siggia ( see equations [ eq : awlc ] and [ eq : gwlc ] ) .",
    "as we have done in our analytical model , we neglect the entropic contribution of fluctuations of the segments in the condensed phase",
    ".    * critical force . *",
    "it is challenging to estimate @xmath48 with ld simulations directly . at the critical point ,",
    "the time scale for the formation of an initial condensation loop diverges .",
    "therefore , it is difficult to estimate @xmath48 by starting from a high force value and decreasing it , because the time scale for nucleation is inaccessible in ld simulations . on the other hand ,",
    "a similar problem is encountered when starting from a condensed structure and increasing progressively the applied force . here , the kinetic barrier between the folded and unfolded states is significant , therefore presenting the same conceptual problem .",
    "however , one can estimate @xmath48 by fitting the @xmath68 curves to a line , and estimating the intercept of the line with the @xmath69 axis ( see equation [ eq : lc_star_rho_star ] and figure [ fig : lc_rho ] ) .",
    "the value of @xmath7 at which @xmath69 gives an estimate of @xmath70 , from which we can estimate the critical force using the @xmath35 function .    * distinguishing between toroids and rods .",
    "* to automatically detect whether a condensed state is toroidal or rod - like , we developed an heuristic method outlined below .",
    "once the cylinders that are part of the condensed phase are identified , for each pair of cylinders @xmath71 and @xmath72 in contact , we evaluate @xmath73 .",
    "if @xmath74 , we say that those segments are in parallel contact , otherwise they are in antiparallel contact .",
    "we can then define an order parameter as @xmath75 , where @xmath76 and @xmath77 are the number of parallel and antiparallel contacts , respectively , and @xmath78 is the total number of contacts . for a toroid , most segments will be in parallel contact , so we expect @xmath79 .",
    "on the other hand , for a rod - like configuration we expect @xmath80 , since @xmath81 .",
    "we performed langevin dynamics simulations of a 3 kb dna molecule ( @xmath82 , @xmath83 ) , as described in methods , using parameters shown in table [ tab : parameters ] , in an optical tweezer - like setup .",
    "we compared the simulation results with the predictions of our analytical model ( equations [ eq : gibbs_free_energy ] and [ eq : helmholtz_free_energy ] ) using the same parameters , for the toroidal and rod - like geometries .",
    "we present here the results of these two approaches .    [",

    "we observed that after @xmath87 time steps , 9 chains adopted the rod - like condensed state , 10 adopted the toroidal state , and one remained uncondensed .",
    "snapshots of the rod - like and toroidal states are shown in figure [ fig : geometry]b and [ fig : geometry]c .",
    "figure [ fig : lc_t ] shows two example traces of @xmath88 for a toroid and a rod . the condensation of the chain occurs as discrete jumps , both for the toroid and rod - like geometries .",
    "the steps correspond to adhesion of successive portions of the dna chain onto an initially formed condensation loop for toroids and a condensation stretch for rods . in the time trace of the toroid condensation , a more progressive , linear condensation step is also observed .",
    "( @xmath9 is calculated as explained in methods , as a function of time for two specific simulations , one which nucleates into a rod - like condensate ( solid red ) and one which nucleates into a toroid ( dashed blue).[fig : lc_t],scaledwidth=50.0% ]      next , we used the final configurations of the simulations described in the previous section to perform stretching simulations . here , every @xmath89 time steps the value of @xmath84 was incremented by 5% .",
    "the resulting force - extension curves are depicted in figure [ fig : force_extension ] .",
    ", @xmath90 .",
    "the simulation protocol is described in methods , and the parameters used are shown in table [ tab : parameters ] .",
    "[ fig : force_extension],scaledwidth=50.0% ]    the toroid- and rod - like structures have a markedly different response under stretching force .",
    "the toroidal structures unfold progressively , exhibiting a saw - tooth - like force - extension behavior , eventually becoming fully extended ( see final blue points in figure [ fig : force_extension ] ) .",
    "the peaks in the force value can go up to @xmath9130pn .",
    "in contrast , rod - like structures never unfold , even at the highest forces probed here ( @xmath9150pn ) . in all our simulations",
    ", we could not unfold rod - like structures , whereas toroidal structures all eventually unfold .",
    "the difference in the force - extension behavior of toroids and rods under tension can be understood in terms of the direction of the applied force . in a rod - like condensate ,",
    "the rod axis is in general approximately parallel to the direction of the applied force ( see figure [ fig : geometry]b ) . as the force increases",
    ", the direction of the force becomes more and more orthogonal to the direction of the dna - dna contacts .",
    "this makes it difficult for the force to unfold the condensate .",
    "on the other hand , the toroidal structures have a larger degree of lateral mobility , that results in fluctuations aligning the lateral contacts with the direction of the applied force .      to further gain insight on the system , and to test the results of our analytical model ( equations [ eq : gibbs_free_energy ] and [ eq : helmholtz_free_energy ] ) , we performed simulations at different values of @xmath84 . for each value of @xmath84",
    ", we obtained results for 10 independent starting configurations .",
    "we then calculated the free energy of the final configurations as outlined in methods , averaging over the 10 simulations .",
    "figure [ fig : free_energy_rho ] shows the comparison of the numerical minimization of our analytical model , for the toroid and rod geometries , and the free energies obtained from langevin dynamics simulations as outlined above .    , and average free energies of final states in langevin dynamics simulations , calculated as explained in methods , for rods ( red circles ) and toroids ( blue triangles ) .",
    "[ fig : free_energy_rho],scaledwidth=50.0% ]    for each value of @xmath84 that we studied , the toroidal states are the ones having the lowest free energy .",
    "the free energy minima for toroidal and rod - like configurations , however , are remarkably close ( within @xmath92 difference ) .",
    "this fact is also manifest in the observation of simulations in which a toroidal and a rod - like condensed phase coexist within the same dna chain ( not shown ) .",
    "our simulations show that at @xmath93 for toroids and @xmath94 for rods , the condensed state ceases to exist . at values of @xmath95",
    "higher than this , the free energy is equal to the worm - like chain free energy .",
    "we notice that there is a significant spread between the values of the free energies calculated in our simulations",
    ". however , the lowest values of the free energy for a given conformation are remarkably close to the predictions of our analytical model .",
    "this means that in the other cases , the conformation adopted by the chain is not an equilibrium one , but a local minimum .",
    "this is a sign that the final conformation is strongly dependent on the nucleation of a first condensation loop .",
    "figure [ fig : fc_l_eps ] shows the values of the critical condensation force @xmath48 as estimated from the analytical model ( see equation [ eq : fc ] ) , as a function of the dna length , at fixed @xmath29 .",
    "the two values chosen for @xmath29 correspond to the case of spermidine ( 0.20 @xmath96 ) and spermine ( 0.33 @xmath96 ) given in reference @xcite . as we explained in the methods section , for a very long chain the critical condensation force reaches a finite value @xmath52 , and becomes independent of the geometrical structure of the condensate . here , we show that this thermodynamic limit is reached only for very long molecules . as an example",
    ", for @xmath97 , the value of @xmath48 reaches @xmath52 only for @xmath98 , the size of a genomic dna molecule .",
    "the experimental values of the maximum condensation force , as extracted from the work of todd et al@xcite and murayama et al@xcite are also depicted .",
    "there is good agreement between the theoretical and experimental values .     on the length of the dna , for @xmath97 ( a ) and @xmath99 ( b ) .",
    "these two values correspond to the case of spermidine and spermine , respectively .",
    "the points are extracted from the experimental data of murayama et al@xcite , besteman et al@xcite , and todd et al@xcite.[fig : fc_l_eps],scaledwidth=50.0% ]    the reason for the very slow convergence of @xmath48 to @xmath52 is to be found in the surface tension term .",
    "in fact , this term is proportional to @xmath29 ( see equations [ eq : etoroid ] and [ eq : erod ] , which is typically a very significant value , and depends on @xmath100 , which is not far from linear dependence .",
    "therefore , this term represents a significant energy penalty even for a very long dna .    as outlined in the methods section , one can estimate the critical condensation force from ld simulations by looking at the dependence of the condensed length @xmath9 on @xmath7 .",
    "figure [ fig : lc_rho ] shows the variation of the average @xmath9 , for toroids and rods , at fixed @xmath7 .",
    "the data clearly shows a linear dependence of @xmath101 on @xmath102 , which is one of the key predictions of our analytical model ( see methods ) .    .",
    "condensed length was calculated as described in methods .",
    "error bars are standard deviations .",
    "the dashed lines are linear fits to the data.[fig : lc_rho],scaledwidth=50.0% ]    a linear fit of this data provides a value of the intercept with the @xmath103 axis which is close to 1 , meaning that in the absence of an external force , the whole molecule is in the condensed state . the value of @xmath70 estimated from our data is 0.96 and 0.87 for toroids and rods , respectively .",
    "unfortunately , small errors in @xmath70 result in large errors on the estimate of @xmath48 , as for @xmath104 the @xmath35 function has a very steep increase ( see figure [ fig : force_extension ] for comparison ) .",
    "therefore , we estimate @xmath48 to be between @xmath1051.5 and 20pn , at @xmath106 .",
    "in this study , we developed an analytical theory and a simulation method to investigate the behavior of a dna under traction and in the presence of self - attraction .",
    "this study was primarily aimed at the investigation of single - molecule dna condensation in optical and magnetic tweezers @xcite .",
    "whereas our simulations allow to study the kinetic aspects of dna condensation , our analytical theory is aimed at the study of the equilibrium properties of the system .",
    "the latter are experimentally accessible , using a very slow unloading rate of a magnetic bead ( see e.  g.   ref .",
    "@xcite ) . in this section",
    "we discuss our results in relation to the experimental data .",
    "firstly , we notice that several experimental features of dna condensation are well captured by our model .",
    "the condensation of the chain proceeds in discrete steps , and each step was shown to correspond to folding of a portion of the molecule onto an initial condensation loop@xcite .",
    "when the condensate is toroidal , the force - extension curve has the characteristic saw - tooth shape , which was seen in experiments@xcite and in previous simulations of dna condensation @xcite .",
    "the force peaks of our simulations are quantitatively in agreement with the experimental ones , being in the 10 - 30 pn range ( see figure [ fig : force_extension ] ) .",
    "our values are somewhat higher than the experimental ones , and this may due to the limited time window accessible by ld simulations . moreover , we find that the conformation of the condensed structures apprearing in the ld simulations is strongly dependent on the size of the initial condensation loop , which is a well - known feature of dna toroids observed in electron microscopy experiments@xcite .    despite its simplicity , our simple assumption of a pairwise potential between the monomers is able to capture some of the principal features of the system .",
    "the analysis of the dependence of the critical condensation force on the length of the dna gives an interesting prediction : the limit of infinitely long chains is reached very slowly , as shown in figure [ fig : fc_l_eps ] . in the work of todd et al@xcite , the authors accurately measured the condensation force at different ionic concentrations .",
    "the condensation force has a maximum value as a function of the concentration of multivalent ions . for this value",
    ", one can show that the entropic contribution to the free energy due to ion mixing vanishes , and one can estimate the amplitude of the attractive dna - dna interactions using the value of the maximum critical force .",
    "this estimate is based on the idea that for a very long dna molecule , the total free energy of the condensate may be approximated by its bulk value .",
    "our study provides a quantitative way of veryfing this hypothesis .",
    "figure [ fig : eps_fc ] shows the relationship between the estimated values of @xmath29 and the condensation force .",
    "the dashed line corresponds to the hypothesis of todd et al , i.  e.   assuming direct proportionality between @xmath29 and @xmath48 , independently of the molecular length .",
    "remarkably , the curve for @xmath107 ( corresponding to the @xmath1 dna molecules used in the experiments of todd et al ) falls almost exactly on the dashed line .",
    "therefore , even though @xmath29 should have been estimated more rigorously , the values supplied by todd et al for @xmath29 are correct .    , from a given measured value of the maximum critical condensation force @xmath48 .",
    "solid colored lines correspond to the theoretical prediction of our analytical model , as extracted by numerically solving equation [ eq : fc ] .",
    "dotted line corresponds to the case of @xmath108 .",
    "dashed line corresponds to the estimate done by todd et al@xcite , assuming direct proportionality between @xmath29 and @xmath48 .",
    "experimental points were assigned by assuming that the values of @xmath29 estimated by todd et al@xcite(blue triangles ) were correct ( see main text for further details ) at a given ionic condition , and assigning the points extracted from the studies of murayama et al@xcite(green circle ) and by besteman et al@xcite(red squares ) to the corresponding ionic conditions.[fig : eps_fc],scaledwidth=50.0% ]    using the fact that those values are correct , we also set other values of experimental critical forces in the figure , as extracted from the works of murayama et al@xcite and besteman et al@xcite , along with the theoretical estimates corresponding to the molecular lengths used in those experiments .",
    "the theoretical and experimental values are in reasonable agreement .",
    "this study also showed that rod - like condensates have a different force - extension behavior compared to toroids . in the paper by baumann et al",
    "@xcite , it was reported that some of the plasmid - length dna molecules could not be stretched to the full original extension .",
    "our results may provide a possible explanation for the two different force - extension behaviors seen experimentally . to our knowledge , the results of baumann et al .",
    "are the only ones that show two different force - extension curve classes . in other experimental works@xcite on the same system , this was not reported .",
    "the geometrical configuration of the condensate is highly dependent on the model chosen for the dna bending .",
    "if one allows for formation of kinks in the chain , with low energetic cost , the rod - like structure becomes the most favorable geometry for the condensate .",
    "in contrast , adding a high energy cost for the hairpin turns strongly favors the toroidal geometry ( data not shown ) .",
    "these results are in line with previous theoretical studies@xcite .",
    "this , together with the fact that the force - extension signature of rods was not clearly reported in the literature , suggests that the high bending angles required in the rod - like structures have a higher energetic cost than that expected by a simple harmonic model as we used here ( see equation [ eq : ebending ] ) .",
    "one possibility is that the polyamines used in dna condensation experiments protect the secondary structure of dna from kinking or bending sharply .",
    "it is in fact known that the polyamines stabilize base - pairing@xcite and do not disrupt the b - dna structural form @xcite .",
    "it is therefore unlikely that dna kinks are favored by inhomogeneous patterns of adsorption of counterions on dna .",
    "the structure of condensed dna is a subject of great interest@xcite , because of the importance , for instance , of dna ejection from viral capsids@xcite .",
    "our results show that under the influence of an external traction force , the toroidal condensed structures are the only ones that can readily unfold .",
    "when a dna molecule becomes rod - like , the unfolding is strongly impeded .",
    "this could be an important element to take into account when envisaging therapeutic strategies against dna viruses .",

    "<S> dna condensation by multivalent cations plays a crucial role in genome packaging in viruses and sperm heads , and has been extensively studied using single - molecule experimental methods . in those experiments , the values of the critical condensation forces have been used to estimate the amplitude of the attractive dna - dna interactions . here , to describe these experiments </S>",
    "<S> , we developed an analytical model and a rigid body langevin dynamics assay to investigate the behavior of a polymer with self - interactions , in the presence of a traction force applied at its extremities . </S>",
    "<S> we model self - interactions using a pairwise attractive potential , thereby treating the counterions implicitly . </S>",
    "<S> the analytical model allows to accurately predict the equilibrium structures of toroidal and rod - like condensed structures , and the dependence of the critical condensation force on the dna length . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the critical condensation force depends strongly on the length of the dna , and finite - size effects are important for molecules of length up to 10@xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> our langevin dynamics simulations show that the force - extension behavior of the rod - like structures is very different from the toroidal ones , so that their presence in experiments should be easily detectable . in double - stranded dna condensation experiments , </S>",
    "<S> the signature of the presence of rod - like structures was not unambiguously detected , suggesting that the polyamines used to condense dna may protect it from bending sharply as needed in the rod - like structures . </S>"
