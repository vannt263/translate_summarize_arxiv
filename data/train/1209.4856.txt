    "supergiant fast x - ray transients ( sfxts ) are high - mass x - ray binaries ( hmxb ) transients that show flares peaking at @xmath9@xmath10 erg s@xmath4 ( 210 kev observed flux of @xmath11 erg @xmath3 s@xmath4 ) lasting a few hours .",
    "their x - ray spectra during a flare are similar to those of accreting neutron stars , and can be described as a flat power - law below @xmath12 kev sometimes displaying a cutoff at 1530 kev . their large x ",
    "ray dynamic range ( 35 orders of magnitude ) and their association with ob supergiant companions make them a peculiar class of hmxbs that now include about 10 sfxts and 10 candidates ( showing the same x  ray properties but still lacking an optical spectroscopic classification ) .",
    "loft , the large observatory for x  ray timing @xcite , is a newly proposed space mission selected by esa in february 2011 as one of the four m3 mission candidates that will compete for a launch opportunity at the start of the 2020s .",

    "* ) has an effective area a factor of @xmath13 larger than rxte / pca ( the largest area x  ray instrument ever flown ) and much improved energy resolution ( better than 260ev ) .",
    "it is specifically designed to exploit the diagnostics of very rapid x - ray flux and spectral variability that directly probe the motion of matter down to distances very close to black holes and neutron stars .",
    "the loft wide field monitor ( wfm , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) will discover and localise x  ray transients and impulsive events and monitor spectral state changes with unprecedented sensitivity , providing interesting targets for lad s pointed observations . through the loft burst alert system ( lbas ) , the position and occurrence time of bright and impulsive events discovered by the wfm will be transmitted on the ground within about 30 s from detection .",
    "the loft contribution to the sfxt investigation will include unprecedented simultaneous high s / n broad - band and time - resolved spectroscopy in several intensity states .",
    "starting point for our simulations were  broad - band observations and detailed _ xmm - newton _ observations that describe the outburst state at several intensities ( @xmath1 to @xmath2 erg @xmath3 s@xmath4 ) , the intermediate ( and most common , @xmath14 erg @xmath3 s@xmath4 ) state , and low state ( @xmath15 to @xmath7 erg @xmath3 s@xmath4 ) . in our simulations we also considered large variations of @xmath8 and the presence of emission lines , also as observed by  and _ xmm - newton_. for the wfm we used ` on axis ' arf , rmf and the background model of @xcite , for the 1.5d camera .",

    "we obtain @xmath22 and @xmath23 @xmath26% in 5ks , while flares with fluxes lower than @xmath25 erg @xmath3 s@xmath4 might require longer exposure times to have sufficiently detailed measurements of the source spectral parameters .",

    "low intensity states down to @xmath35 erg @xmath3 s@xmath4 can be studied in 10ks .",
    "several sfxts are x - ray pulsars ( with @xmath382000s ) so it is paramount to determine if all of them are indeed pulsating sources and to what limit we can determine @xmath39 for the whole sample . in conjunction with the wfm monitoring , this should in turn allow us to address the issue of why sfxts differ from ordinary hmxbs with the same @xmath20 and @xmath39 .",
    "in particular , we investigated whether we can measure pulsations during the bright outbursts with the wfm , and the required length of the pointed lad observations to accurately measure a @xmath39 .",
