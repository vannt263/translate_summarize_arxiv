    "the friendship paradox , introduced by feld  @xcite , is a sociological observation that says most people are less popular than their friends on average .",
    "it is called a ` paradox ' because , while most people believe that they are more popular than their friends  @xcite , feld observed that the converse is actually true .",
    "there are more recent observations agreeing with felds , that study online environments .",
    "for example on twitter , people you follow and also your followers have , on average , more followers than you do .",
    "they also follow more people than you do  @xcite . on facebook ,",
    "your friends have , on average , more friends than you do  @xcite .",
    "the friendship paradox is about the inter - nodal inequality of the degrees .",
    "what happens if we consider other attributes ? this is the focus of the ` generalized friendship paradox '  @xcite .",
    "for example on twitter , your friends on average tweet more and also share more viral content than you  @xcite . in the scientific collaboration networks",
    "your collaborators have on average more publications , more citations and more collaborators than you do  @xcite .",
    "the friendship paradox has applications in spotting influential nodes . in  @xcite , it is used for finding high - degree nodes for efficient vaccination . in order to sample a node with above average degree",
    ", a node is chosen uniformly at random and one of their neighbours will be sampled . in  @xcite",
    ", the friendship paradox is used for the early detection of flu outbreaks among college students . in  @xcite , it is utilized to derive early - warning sensors during catastrophic events such as hurricanes .    in this paper , first we explain a quality - dependent preferential attachment scheme introduced in  @xcite .",
    "then , we introduce measures to quantify the mean and the median paradoxes . in section 4",
    "these measures are computed numerically on the networks generated with the quality - dependent model and also uncorrelated networks .",
    "we compare the results obtained in these networks using both the mean and the median statistics .",
    "furthermore , we study the effect of node quality distribution on the quality and friendship paradoxes .",
    "we consider a _ quality - based preferential attachment _ ( qpa ) model , identical to the model proposed and analysed in  @xcite .",
    "it is similar to the barabasi - albert model  @xcite , but incorporates node qualities .",
    "each incoming node has @xmath0 links , and a discrete quality @xmath1 drawn from a distribution @xmath2 that is assigned to it upon birth .",
    "the probability of an existing node @xmath3 with degree @xmath4 and quality @xmath5 ( at the instant ) receiving a new link is proportional to @xmath6 .",
    "once assigned , the quality of a node does not change .",
    "we denote the mean of the quality distribution by @xmath7 . following  @xcite , as the number of nodes tends to infinity , @xmath8 ,",
    "the fraction of nodes with degree @xmath9 and quality @xmath1 is given by : @xmath10 in  @xcite the nearest - neighbor distribution , i.e. , the fraction of neighbors of a node with degree @xmath9 and quality @xmath1 who has degree @xmath11 and quality @xmath12 is given by : @xmath13.$ }                       \\label{nnfdd }                     \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]",
    "by marginalizing the joint distribution @xmath8 we can find the degree distribution , denoted by @xmath14 .",
    "also , from the nearest - neighbor distribution  , we can find the expected value of the qualities of neighbors of a node with quality @xmath1 and also the expected value of the degrees of neighbors of a node with degree @xmath9 .",
    "this allows us to investigate when the quality paradox ( hereinafter qp ) and the friendship paradox ( hereinafter fp ) are in force , and which nodes in the network exhibit the paradox .",
    "let us also define the ` median ' version of the paradoxes , following  @xcite . in the median version , instead of the average values of quality or degree of neighbors , we use the median values .",
    "a node experiences the median qp ( fp ) , if its quality ( degree ) is less than the quality ( degree ) of at least half of its neighbors .    throughout the paper ,",
    "the superscript nn denotes nearest - neighbor .",
    "let us denote the median operator by @xmath15 .",
    "for example , @xmath16 denotes the median value of @xmath12 under the distribution @xmath17 , and is a function of @xmath1 . also note that every measure we introduce here is by nature a function of the parameters of the quality distribution .",
    "for example , if the exponential decay quality distribution is considered , the measures will depend on the decay factor .",
    "we denote the parameter of the quality distribution by @xmath3 . using this notation",
    ", we define the critical values for the mean and the median paradoxes as follows : @xmath18 in other words , @xmath19 is the highest quality that a node can have , given that its quality is lower than the average quality of its neighbors .",
    "similarly , @xmath20 is the highest degree that a node can have , given that it exhibits the mean fp . for the median version of the paradox , we have @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "so @xmath21 is the highest quality that a node exhibiting the median qp can have .",
    "let us also emphasize that we use the following convention with regards to the median throughout the paper : the median of the probability distribution @xmath23 ( with cdf @xmath24 ) is the minimum value of @xmath3 for which @xmath25 .",
    "for example , for @xmath26+\\frac{1}{2}\\delta[x-5]}$ ] , the median is @xmath27 .",
    "we now define similar quantities for an ` uncorrelated network ' . in this network",
    "the qualities are assigned to nodes in an identical way to the qpa model , but the attachment of new nodes to existing nodes depends on neither the degrees nor the qualities of the existing nodes . in this network",
    "the properties of a node are uncorrelated with the properties of its neighbors .",
    "we denote this case by superscript @xmath28 . for this network",
    "we have @xmath29 and @xmath30 . for the critical values of the mean and the median paradoxes",
    ", we have : @xmath31 similarly , for degrees we have : @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "we are also interested in the fraction of all nodes that experience each type of paradoxes .",
    "this is equal to the fraction of nodes with their attribute below the corresponding critical value .",
    "we denote these quantities by : @xmath34",
    "in this paper we consider two quality distributions for expository purposes .",
    "the first one is the bernoulli distribution , where nodes have quality 0 ( with probability @xmath35 ) or quality @xmath36 ( with probability @xmath37 ) .",
    "the other one is the discrete exponential distribution , with decay factor @xmath38 .",
    "the probability of quality @xmath1 is proportional to @xmath39 , and the maximum value of @xmath1 is denoted by @xmath36 .",
    "figure  [ distributions ] depicts these quality distributions for four example values of @xmath35 and @xmath38 .",
    "note that for @xmath40 , the exponential distribution is a decreasing function of quality and @xmath41 , and for @xmath42 , the distribution is increasing function of quality and @xmath43 . also for the bernoulli distribution note that , with the convention we use for the median , the value of the median is zero if @xmath44 , and the median is equal to @xmath36 if @xmath45 . for each distribution ,",
    "we have numerically computed all the introduced measures for four different values of @xmath0 and four different values of @xmath36 .",
    ".493       0.493    .5    0.5     +    .5    0.5     +    .5    0.5     +    0.5    0.5    critical values obtained for two distributions are presented in figure  [ criticals ] .",
    "these values are computed using the closed form expressions mentioned in section 2 . from figure  [ crit_ext_9 ]",
    "we can learn about the differences between the networks that the qpa model generates and an uncorrelated network . in an uncorrelated network",
    "the probabilities of a random node being connected to a neighbor with quality @xmath46 and @xmath36 are equal to @xmath35 and @xmath37 , respectively ( regardless of the quality of the node ) .",
    "if the majority of the neighbors have quality zero ( @xmath47 ) , the median is zero .",
    "similarly , if the majority have quality @xmath36 ( @xmath48 ) , the median is @xmath36 .",
    "so if @xmath49 , nodes with qualities up to @xmath50 experience the median qp and @xmath51 .",
    "conversely , if @xmath52 , @xmath53 .",
    "this explains the abrupt drop in @xmath54 in figure  [ crit_ext_9 ] . on the other hand , in the qpa model",
    ", this transition takes place at a @xmath35 greater than @xmath55 .",
    "this means that upto some point beyond @xmath56 , although the probability of @xmath57 is higher than that of @xmath58 , the majority of the friends of each node have quality @xmath36 .",
    "there is a region for @xmath59 , where the majority of the network have quality zero , but the majority of the neighbors of most nodes have quality @xmath60 .",
    "this indicates quality disassortativity , since low quality nodes are mostly connected to nodes with high qualities .    for the mean version of the qp",
    ", we consider the example case of @xmath61 for discussion . in an uncorrelated network",
    ", each node ( with any quality ) is connected to neighbors with quality @xmath46 and @xmath36 with probabilities @xmath62 and @xmath63 , respectively .",
    "so the average of the qualities of its neighbors is @xmath64 .",
    "so nodes with quality less than @xmath65 experience the mean qp . on the other hand , in the qpa model @xmath66 at @xmath61 .",
    "this means that nodes whose qualities are between @xmath67 and @xmath68 , do not experience the mean qp in the qpa model ( while they do experience this paradox in the uncorrelated case ) .",
    "we deduce that these nodes are connected to quality zero nodes with a higher probability than @xmath62 .",
    "this reduces the average quality of their niehgbors .",
    "now consider the example case of @xmath69 .",
    "in this case , @xmath70 .",
    "this means that nodes with quality between @xmath67 and @xmath68 experience the mean qp in the proposed model , while they do not experience it in the uncorrelated case . in an uncorrelated network",
    "these nodes would be connected to zero and @xmath36 quality nodes probabilities @xmath63 and @xmath62 , respectively . however , in the qpa model , these nodes are connected to nodes with quality @xmath36 with a probability higher than @xmath62 , and this increases the average quality of their neighbors , making them subject to the mean qp .",
    "comparing figure  [ crit_ext_12 ] with  [ crit_ext_9 ] we observe the curves are similar , but the difference between the qpa model and the uncorrelated case is smaller in figure  [ crit_ext_12 ] .",
    "for example , the drop in the @xmath71 curve is closer to the drop in @xmath54 for the uncorrelated case .",
    "we conclude that increasing @xmath0 decreases the difference between the qpa model and the uncorrelated case .    in figure  [ crit_ext_22 ] ,",
    "critical degrees are depicted .",
    "it can be observed that as @xmath35 increases , @xmath72 increases . comparing figures  [ crit_ext_22 ] and  [ crit_ext_24 ]",
    ", we observe that all the critical degrees are greater in the case of @xmath73 than @xmath74 .",
    "also the range of node degrees experiencing any type of paradoxes is wider in the @xmath73 case . from figure  [ crit_decay_5 ]",
    ", we observe that for fixed decay factor , @xmath75 and @xmath76 .",
    "this means that there exist values of @xmath1 that in the uncorrelated network experience qp , but in the proposed model they do not .",
    "so the range of possible values of quality that experience the qp is wider in the qpa model than in uncorrelated networks .",
    "this argument holds for both mean and median paradoxes .",
    "we also observe from figure  [ crit_decay_5 ] that for @xmath40 , @xmath77 and @xmath78 .",
    "both of these inequalities flip in the case of @xmath42 .",
    "the main cause of this change of regime is the difference between the shape of the quality distribution for @xmath42 and @xmath40 . when @xmath40 , the median paradox is stronger ( using the terminology of  @xcite ) , that is , the median paradox applies to a smaller range of qualities than the mean paradox ( for both the uncorrelated network and the qpa model ) .",
    "however , when @xmath42 , the median of the distribution is greater than the mean . as it can be observed in figure  [ crit_decay_5 ] , there are values of @xmath1 that are subject to the median version of the paradox , but not to the mean version .",
    "this means that the term ` strong paradox ' introduced in  @xcite is not applicable to this case , because the mean version provides a tighter range of qualities in paradox , as compared to the median version .",
    "another observable trend in figure  [ crit_decay_5 ] is that the critical values of quality are a non - decreasing functions of @xmath38 .",
    "this can be intuitively explained as follows .",
    "when @xmath38 is low , the majority of the network is constituted by low quality nodes .",
    "the majority of the neighbors of a low quality node will also have low quality .",
    "so the node does not experience the paradox with high probability .",
    "when @xmath38 increases , the number of nodes with higher quality increases , and a low quality node has a higher probability of being connected to those high quality nodes , which gives it a higher probability of experiencing paradox . comparing figure  [ crit_decay_8 ] with figure  [ crit_decay_5 ]",
    ", we observe that as @xmath0 varies @xmath68 and @xmath54 do not change , while the critical values of the qpa model get closer to those of the uncorrelated case .",
    "these figures only depict the results for two values of @xmath0 , due to space limitations .",
    "the trend holds for the omitted figures .",
    "we conclude that _ as @xmath0 gets larger , the correlation of the quality of a node with the quality of its neighbors diminishes . _    in figure  [ crit_decay_21 ] , the critical degrees ( as defined in   and  ) are depicted .",
    "it can be observed that as @xmath38 increases , @xmath72 decreases . comparing figures  [ crit_decay_21 ] and  [ crit_decay_24 ]",
    ", we observe that all the critical degrees are greater in the case of @xmath73 than @xmath79 .",
    "also the range of the degrees who experience paradox ( of any type ) is wider when @xmath73 . in both figures , we observe that the mean fp is more sensitive to changes in the quality distribution than the median fp",
    ".    .5    0.5     +    .5    0.5     +    0.5    0.5    figure [ pop_decay ] depicts the fraction of nodes in the quality and friendship paradoxes ( as defined in ) when quality distribution is exponential . from figure  [ pop_decay_1 ] we observe that , as @xmath38 increases in the vicinity of zero , @xmath80 , the fraction of nodes experiencing the mean qp ( with qualities lower than @xmath67 ) decreases , because increasing @xmath38 increases the fraction of nodes with high qualities . the fraction @xmath80 has discontinuities at the values of @xmath38 at which @xmath81 is incremented by one .",
    "so all the nodes whose qualities where equal to the new @xmath67 are taken into account as those who experience the mean qp , hence the abrupt jump .",
    "the fraction of nodes in the median qp is depicted in figure  [ pop_decay_3 ] .",
    "it can be seen that @xmath82 has a similar behavior to that of @xmath80 .",
    "each discontinuity pertains to a value of @xmath38 at which @xmath71 increments .",
    "the main difference between figures  [ pop_decay_1 ] and  [ pop_decay_3 ] is the behavior near @xmath83 . in the mean qp",
    ", when almost all nodes have quality zero , even one non - zero quality neighbor elevates the average above zero , so all those zero - quality nodes experience the mean qp .",
    "however , in the median version , at least half of the friends of a zero - quality node must have non - zero quality .",
    "also observe that for @xmath40 , we have @xmath84 , i.e , the fraction of nodes in the mean qp is higher than the fraction of nodes in the median qp .",
    "but , for @xmath42 the inequality changes sides .",
    ".5    0.5     +    0.5    0.5    in figures  [ pop_decay_5 ] and  [ pop_decay_6 ] , it can be observed that _ for all values of @xmath0 and @xmath36 , the majority of the nodes ( over @xmath85 ) experience the mean fp . _ also , as @xmath38 increases",
    ", @xmath86 decreases .",
    "it means that the quality distribution affects the fp that depends solely on degrees . through the quality - dependant network growth mechanism , the degree distribution , and hence the conditions under which a node experiences the fp , depend on the quality distribution",
    "also , it is observed in figure  [ pop_decay_5 ] that as @xmath0 increases , the sensitivity of @xmath86 to variations of @xmath38 decreases .",
    "this means that as the initial degree of nodes increases , the effect of the quality distribution on the fp diminishes . because as @xmath0 increases the final degrees of nodes increase , and for larger degrees @xmath87 is dominated by @xmath9 ; varying @xmath1 has less of an effect .",
    "conversely , in figure  [ pop_decay_6 ] , as @xmath36 increases , the sensitivity of @xmath86 to variations of @xmath38 increases . as the range of possible qualities becomes wider , the probability of having high values of @xmath1 that have significant roles in @xmath87 increases .    in figures  [ pop_decay_7 ] and  [ pop_decay_8 ]",
    ", we observe that as @xmath38 increases , @xmath88 ( the fraction of nodes experiencing the median fp ) decreases .",
    "this is similar to the trend observed for @xmath86 in figures  [ pop_decay_5 ] and  [ pop_decay_6 ] . from figure  [ pop_decay_7 ]",
    "we observe that @xmath88 increases as @xmath0 increases . from figure  [ pop_decay_8 ]",
    "we observe that for a range of decay factors ( up to around @xmath89 ) , @xmath36 does not have a significant effect on @xmath88 , but beyond that point , @xmath88 decreases as @xmath60 increases . also ,",
    "comparing figures  [ pop_decay_7 ] and  [ pop_decay_8 ] with figures  [ pop_decay_5 ] and  [ pop_decay_6 ] , we assert that @xmath90 . in other words ,",

    "comparing figures  [ pop_ext_5 ] and  [ pop_ext_6 ] with figures  [ pop_ext_7 ] and  [ pop_ext_8 ] we deduce that for each value of @xmath35 , we have @xmath91 , i.e. , _ the fraction of nodes experiencing the mean fp is higher than nodes in the median fp regardless of the quality distribution_.",
    "in this paper we studied the friendship and the generalized friendship paradoxes on networks grown under a quality - based preferential attachment scheme . to this end , we introduced measures , such as quality and degree critical values , and fraction of nodes that experience each paradox . in each case , we considered the mean and the median to characterize the paradox .",
    "we compared the results to the uncorrelated network where the qualities and degrees of neighbors are uncorrelated .",
    "we considered bernoulli and exponential distributions for qualities .",
    "for the exponential quality distribution , the critical quality of the uncorrelated case is always smaller than that of the qpa model .",
    "this means that the range of possible values of the quality that experience paradox is wider in the qpa model than in the uncorrelated case .",
    "we also observed that as @xmath0 increases , the nearest - neighbor quality correlation decreases .",
    "in other words , the critical values of the proposed model converge to those of the uncorrelated case . for the exponential quality distribution",
    "we also observe that when @xmath40 ( which makes the median smaller than the mean ) , the median qp is stronger than the mean qp for both the qpa model and the uncorrelated case .",
    "the converse is true for @xmath42 .",
    "for all values of @xmath92 , over @xmath85 of nodes experience the mean fp .",
    "we observed that changing the distribution of qualities affects the fp ( in addition to the qp ) .",
    "this effect is strengthened when @xmath0 decreases or when @xmath36 increases .",
    "also , it was observed that regardless of the quality distribution , the median fp is always stronger than the mean fp .",
    "plausible extensions of the present contribution are as follows .",
    "we can apply the measures introduced here to real networks , and compare the results , and also compare them with networks synthesized with arbitrary quality distributions .",
    "this enables us to investigate what type of quality distribution best characterizes a given network .",
