    "we have chosen to use this energy since it is where the tevatron collider operated between 1992 and 1996 , and this work is in support of a search of the data for single top production .",

    "the cteq3 m and mrs(a@xmath65 ) @xmath34 sea distributions are not measured experimentally , but are obtained from the gluon distributions using the dokshitzer - gribov - lipatov - altarelli - parisi ( dglap ) evolution equations @xcite . the @xmath34 sea distributions in the structure functions therefore contain a mass singularity from the collinear divergence which occurs when the gluon splits to an onshell @xmath86 pair .",
    "the subprocesses we are considering which pertain to this situation are 2.1 @xmath24 , and 2.2 @xmath11 ( @xmath6-gluon fusion ) , where the initial state @xmath34  quark in subprocess 2.1 is derived from the gluon sea in the antiproton . the correct way to avoid this singularity would be to calculate the rate for subprocess 2.2 @xmath11 with complete loop corrections , and then subprocess 2.1 with its @xmath34 sea contribution would be automatically included without the need for extracting it from the parton distribution sets .",
    "however , since we are making leading order calculations , we need another method .",
    "one technique @xcite for obtaining the cross section @xmath87 is to calculate the rates for subprocesses 2.1 and 2.2 and add them together , and then subtract the rate from the splitting process @xmath88 convoluted with subprocess @xmath24 .",
    "we have chosen to employ this method here .",
    "for instance , at @xmath89 with @xmath90 and cteq3 m parton distributions , the naive cross section for @xmath24 is 0.75  pb , for @xmath11 it is 0.29  pb , and the splitting term is 0.54  pb , giving a total cross section from these two subprocesses of 0.50  pb .",
    "the rate for @xmath23 is thus over 70% higher than the rate from the @xmath6-gluon fusion subprocess @xmath11 alone .",
    "a second subtlety @xcite comes into play with this method for avoiding double counting , when working with the two parton distributions being considered : cteq3 m and mrs(a@xmath65 ) .",
    "the cteq collaboration has chosen to evolve the @xmath34 sea distribution from @xmath91 , whereas the mrs group starts the evolution of its @xmath34 sea distribution at @xmath92 .",
    "the logarithmic terms in the gluon splitting must be evaluated as @xmath93 with cteq distributions , but as @xmath94 for mrs distributions , to be consistent with the respective definitions of the @xmath34  quark sea .",
    "we show results for the cross sections of the three electroweak single top processes and the totals in fig .",
    "[ xsecmass ] as a function of the top quark mass , with @xmath95 .",
    "figure  [ xsecmass](a ) shows @xmath96 , ( b ) portrays the process @xmath23 , ( c ) is for the less important @xmath64 mode , and ( d ) shows the totals for each of these three processes for @xmath97 and combined .",
    "figure[xsecmass](d ) also shows pair production for comparison ( upper line ) , and it can be seen that when only one top quark is produced in the final state , the cross sections decrease more slowly with increasing top quark mass than when two heavy tops have to be created at once .",
    "the strong cross section illustrated is from the resummed next - to - leading order calculation of berger and contopanagos @xcite , who used the cteq3 m parton distributions .",
    "the tree level single top cross sections are the average of our calculations using cteq3 m and mrs(a@xmath65 ) .",
    "the main contribution to electroweak single top production comes from @xmath23 , the @xmath6  boson t- and u - channel mode , including @xmath6-gluon fusion .",
    "the rate from this process ( 61% , at @xmath89 ) is nearly twice as large as that from @xmath96 with a @xmath12 in the s - channel ( 32% ) .",
    "the contribution to the total cross section of the third process @xmath64 is small ( 7% ) . of the dominant t- and u - channel process",
    ", 41% of the rate comes from @xmath24 ( after subtraction of the splitting term ) , and 59% from @xmath6-gluon fusion @xmath11 .",
    "therefore , @xmath6-gluon fusion forms 36% of the total single top rate from all processes .    because there are contributions from several single top processes , the total cross section forms a significant fraction of the pair production rate .",
    "the single top and antitop cross section from production at @xmath0 is @xmath98  pb for a top quark of mass 180 and the cteq3 m parton distributions , and @xmath99  pb using mrs(a@xmath65 ) .",
    "therefore , although the rate of single top production is smaller than that from pair production ( e.g. @xmath100  pb at 180 @xcite ) for all top quark masses considered here , it is large enough to be extremely interesting for study at the tevatron .",
    "recent calculations show that higher order corrections to the leading order single top cross sections presented here are large .",
    "for instance , ref.@xcite shows that the @xmath101 factor for @xmath23 is @xmath761.45 for @xmath89 at @xmath0 with cteq2d parton distributions @xcite and @xmath90 .",

    "table  [ table1 ] presents values of various partonic subprocess cross sections for a top quark of mass 180 , and for the two parton distributions discussed previously .",
    "subprocesses with an initial state strange or charm sea quark contribute 1.9% to the total @xmath96 cross section , and 6.1% to the total @xmath23 rate .",
    "off - diagonal ckm matrix element subprocesses ( not including initial state @xmath36 and @xmath35 sea quark subprocesses ) contribute 0.3% to @xmath96 and 5.0% to @xmath23 .",
    "all these other modes contribute @xmath104 to @xmath64 production . off - diagonal ckm subprocesses and initial state @xmath36 and @xmath35 sea quark subprocesses are included in our calculation of the total single top cross section , but are not included in our plots for simplicity , because of the calculation technique used .    for single top modes like @xmath12 s - channel production with only light partons in the initial state , including both valence and sea quarks , the cross sections calculated with mrs(a@xmath65 ) are 2.4% lower than those calculated with cteq3 m .",
    "when there is a gluon in the initial state , for instance @xmath6-gluon fusion , then the mrs(a@xmath65 ) cross sections are 5.7% lower than the cteq3 m ones . for reactions with a sea @xmath34  quark in the initial state , the cross sections calculated with mrs(a@xmath65 ) are 17% smaller .",

    "the central value numbers are the mean of the values calculated using cteq3 m and mrs(a@xmath65 ) .",
    "the upper and lower bounds come from combining half the difference between the calculations using the two parton distributions with the errors from the choice of qcd scale , as discussed in the next section .",
    "the correlation of the errors is correctly accounted for by adding the @xmath14 errors to each subprocess separately , before adding them in quadrature with the uncertainty due to the choice of structure function . for a top quark of mass 180 ,",
    "the total single top plus antitop cross section is @xmath105  pb .      we have examined the effect of the choice of qcd evolution parameter @xmath14 on the various single top subprocesses .",

    "we have calculated the region in the ( , @xmath163 ) plane for which there will be experimental sensitivity using future single top measurements .",

    "[ ar ] , with correspondingly lower .",
    "the error on the measurement of is dependent on the error on the single top cross section , including both experimental and theoretical contributions .",
    "first we estimate the experimental error for a top quark of mass 180 at @xmath1 as follows : we take the integrated luminosity for tevatron run  2 as 2  fb@xmath174 , with an error of 5% ; the signal acceptance including at least one @xmath34  tag as 0.20 , from the tev-2000 study of single top production @xcite , with an error of 7% ; and a signal to background ratio of 1:2 , with a systematic error on the background of 7% .",
    "the available branching fraction includes both the electron and muon decay channels , giving @xmath175 . in run  2",
    ", all accessible modes of single top production will have to be used together in order not to make a statistics - limited measurement .",
    "we use here the value 2.44  pb for the single top cross section (= 0.72  pb ( s - channel ) + 1.72  pb ( t- and u - channels ) ) from cteq3 m .",
    "these assumptions lead to a prediction that approximately 650 events will be found in a search , with one third coming from single top production and two thirds from various backgrounds ( e.g.  @xmath176 , @xmath177  light jets with a mistag , ) .",
    "therefore , the experimental error on the total single top cross section will be 10% ( statistical ) @xmath178 16% ( systematic ) = 19% , where the @xmath178 symbol means ",
    "add in quadrature \" .",
    "the error on the theoretical calculation of the cross section includes contributions from the choice of parton distribution function and from the scale , as discussed earlier in this paper , where they were found to be @xmath7612% .",
    "however , there is another contribution , not well quantified , from the lack of knowledge of the gluon distribution in the proton and antiproton for t- and u - channel single top processes .",
    "this error has been variously reported to the authors as 30% @xcite and 10% @xcite , and so we use these values here to estimate the error on the theoretical total single top cross section at 32% or 16% .",
    "the error on a measurement of will be half the error on the single top cross section , since the cross sections for all single top processes are proportional to @xmath179 .",
    "this results in an error on of @xmath180 or @xmath181 from the tevatron run  2 , depending on one s view of the knowledge of the gluon momentum distributions in the proton sea",
    ".    there may be a run  3 at the tevatron from 2002 onwards , producing 30  fb@xmath174 of data .",
    "this high luminosity mode of collider running is known as  tev33 \" after the planned instantaneous luminosity of @xmath182  @xmath183s@xmath174 . with such high statistics available ,",
    "it has been shown by stelzer and willenbrock @xcite that using just s - channel @xmath12 production with double @xmath34  tagging instead of all single top modes with only one tag will eliminate most of the uncertainty on the theoretical cross section , because there will no longer be any contributions from processes with initial state gluons .",
    "they also showed that the measurement should be possible using 3 fb@xmath174 of data .",
    "we update their calculation here for run  3 , including estimates of the systematic errors .",
    "the cross section for @xmath123 is 0.716  pb , with @xmath89 , @xmath1 and @xmath90 . to estimate the error on using run  3 data",
    ", we make the following assumptions : the error on the luminosity remains at 5% ; the signal acceptance for @xmath12 single top is 0.08 when requiring a double @xmath34  tag , as shown in ref.@xcite , with a 1.8% error ; and the signal to background ratio is 1:2 ( again from @xcite ) , with a systematic error on the background of 1.8% .",
    "therefore , an experiment at the tevatron in run  3 will see approximately 1,146 events when searching for @xmath12 single top production , with one third signal events and two thirds coming from various backgrounds ( e.g.  @xmath176 , @xmath177  light jets with two mistags , @xmath184 with @xmath185 , @xmath6-gluon fusion , ) .",
    "this observation will lead to a measurement of the @xmath12 single top production cross section with an error of 7% ( statistical ) @xmath178 6% ( systematic ) = 10% .",
    "smith and willenbrock @xcite show that the error on the theoretical cross section for @xmath12 single top production is only 3% , leading to an error on of 5% .    in fig .",
    "[ vtbar ] we show the results of these calculations , extended into the ( , @xmath163 ) plane . in plot ( a ) for tevatron run  2 ( 2  fb@xmath174 ) , the outer short - dashed contours show the result when the error on the theory cross section includes a 30% contribution from lack of knowledge of the gluon distribution .",
    "the inner long - dashed contours result from when this error contributes only 10% to the overall measurement .",
    "plot ( b ) presents our estimates for tevatron run  3 ,  tev33 \" ( 30  fb@xmath174 ) , with the dashed contours showing the precision obtainable using a theory error of only 3% and an experimental search to isolate the @xmath12 s - channel mode of single top .",
    "we discuss in the next section how one might distinguish standard model production from the scenario discussed above where the effects of an elevated cross section caused by the anomalous coupling cancel with a reduced value of from a possible mixing of the top quark with a new fourth generation quark to give an observed number of events consistent with the standard model .",
    "top quark polarization depends strongly on the structure of the @xmath2 coupling , and one might expect an asymmetry in angular distributions of the final state partons for different values of @xmath163 .",
    "for example , standard model single top is produced almost 100% left - handedly polarized because of the left - handed current structure of the @xmath2 coupling , whereas if @xmath186 , the top quark is not polarized at all . to calculate polarization effects using monte carlo generators , it is necessary either to keep the polarization of all particles in the final states of the @xmath187 and @xmath128 processes being studied ( i.e.@xmath13 , @xmath24 , @xmath11 ) , with subsequent decays of the polarized top quark and @xmath6  boson ( @xmath8 , @xmath188 ) , or else one needs to calculate the higher order @xmath189 and @xmath190 processes ( i.e.  @xmath191 , @xmath192 , @xmath193 ) , with the top quark and @xmath6  boson treated as resonances in the intermediate states .",
    "the second method automatically includes the polarizations of the intermediate state @xmath97 and @xmath6 . to study the differences between kinematic distributions",
    "when the polarizations of the top quark and @xmath6  boson have been taken into account with those where they are assumed to be unpolarized ( as in most monte carlo generators , e.g.  pythia ) , we have calculated the @xmath189 and @xmath190 processes for the three significant single top production modes using chep alone , and compared the results with calculations where we used chep for the @xmath187 and @xmath128 single top processes , and pythia for the subsequent @xmath97 and @xmath6 decays .",
    "our direct calculations show that the @xmath138 and @xmath118 distributions are not sensitive to the polarization of the top quark .    two representative examples of distributions expected to reflect the top quark polarization effects are the invariant mass of the positron and the @xmath34  quark , , and the cosine of the polar angle , .",
    "the invariant mass is given by : @xmath194 where @xmath195 is the momentum of the positron or @xmath34 quark along the beam direction .",
    "the polar angle @xmath196 is defined as the angle between the positron direction and the @xmath79 axis within the rest frame of the @xmath6  boson , where the @xmath79 axis is defined to be in the direction of motion of the @xmath6  boson in the rest frame of the top quark @xcite .",
    "the cosine of this angle is given approximately by : @xmath197    figure  [ polar ] shows the distributions of ( a ) and ( b ) , for the case when polarizations of the top quark and @xmath6  boson have been properly taken into account ( solid histogram ) , and for when summation over the polarization of the top quark decay products has been done using the subsequent decays of an unpolarized top quark and @xmath6  boson ( dashed histogram ) .",
    "one can see that there are indeed differences in these distributions for the polarized and unpolarized cases .",
    "in particular , an asymmetry ( or lack of it ) in when the positron is emitted aligned or antialigned with the direction of motion of the @xmath6  boson in the top rest frame should be observable with high statistics .",
    "all three modes of single top production exhibit this same behavior . the two variables and can also be used in combination with the total single top production rate , which is sensitive to the @xmath2 coupling structure as shown previously , to further our understanding of the @xmath2 coupling .      from our previous estimates of the sensitivity for measuring the single top cross section at future tevatron runs ,",
    "we can obtain the expected precision on the top quark partial width @xmath198 . in the standard model",
    ", the top quark partial width is very nearly the same as its full width , since is so close to 1 .",
    "the top partial width is directly proportional to the single top cross section , and so the error on the width is just the experimental measurement error on the cross section added in quadrature with the theoretical calculation error .",
    "thus in run  2 the top quark width should be measured with an error of @xmath199 or @xmath200 , depending on whether the uncertainty on the gluon distribution function is 30% or 10% . in run  3",
    ", this precision can be improved to @xmath201 , which is comparable to what can be achieved at a linear collider @xcite using a threshold scan .",
    "in this paper we have reported the results of new studies of single top quark physics at the fermilab tevatron collider .",
    "we have made consistent calculations of the tree level cross sections for each mode of single top production as a function of top quark mass , parton distribution function , qcd scale , and collision energy .",
    "we discussed details of the calculations for several of the subprocesses involved , and gave breakdowns of the various contributions to the overall cross sections . for a top quark of mass 180 , at @xmath0 , with @xmath90 , and taking the mean result from cteq3 m and mrs(a@xmath65 ) , we find that the leading order total single top plus antitop cross section is @xmath202  pb .    we have shown for each subprocess separately the transverse momentum and pseudorapidity distributions of the top quark , the other quarks produced with it , and its decay products .",
    "these kinematic distributions need to be understood in order to be able to separate signal from background in an experimental search .",
    "we then considered the possibility for measuring the ckm matrix element and the @xmath2 coupling directly using single top events from the next tevatron run .",
    "we estimated the sensitivity such measurements might have , and how an anomalous term in the @xmath2 coupling would affect the measurement of .",
    "if there is no anomalous component to the @xmath2 coupling , then can be measured to a precision of 19% or 12% in run  2 ( 19992001 ) , with the two values coming from different estimates of the uncertainty in the gluon distribution function . in run  3 ( 20022006 )",
    ", the precision on will be improved to 5% .",
    "the top quark polarization affects the angular distributions of its decay products , and we investigated how this could be used together with a measurement of the single top cross section to distinguish between various processes affecting the top quark beyond the standard model . finally our estimates of the single top cross section error show that the top quark partial width will be measured to within 37%25% in run  2 , and to a precision of 10% in run  3 .",
