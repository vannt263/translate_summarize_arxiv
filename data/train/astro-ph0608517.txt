    "the main strategy behind the modelling approach we follow is to first calculate the collapse and merging history of individual dark matter halos , which is governed purely by gravitational interactions , and secondly to calculate the more complex physics of the baryons inside these dark matter halos , including e.g. radiative cooling of the gas , star formation and feedback from supernovae by simplified prescriptions on top of the dark matter evolution .",
    "each of the dark matter halos consist of three main components which are distributed among individual galaxies inside them . a stellar , cold and hot gas component , where the latter is only attributed to _",
    "central _ galaxies , the most massive galaxies inside individual halos . in the following sections",
    ", we will describe briefly the recipes used to calculate these different components which are mainly based on recipes presented in kauffmann et al.@xcite ( hereafter , k99 ) and springel et al.@xcite ( hereafter , s01 ) , and we refer readers for more details on model implementations to their work and references therein .    throughout this paper",
    "we use the following set of cosmological parameters : @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "we calculate the merging history of dark matter halos according to the prescription presented in somerville et al.@xcite .",
    "this approach has been shown to produce merging histories and progenitor distributions in reasonable agreement with result from n - body simulations of cold dark matter structure formation in a cosmological context@xcite .",
    "the merging history of dark matter halos is reconstructed by breaking each halo up into progenitors above a limiting minimum progenitor mass @xmath29 .",
    "this mass cut needs to be chosen carefully as it ensures that the right galaxy population and merging histories are produced within the model .",
    "progenitor halos with masses below @xmath29 are declared as _ accretion _ events and their histories are not followed further back in time .",
    "progenitors labelled as accretion events should ideally not host any significant galaxies in them and be composed mainly of primordial hot gas at the progenitor halo s virial temperature . to achieve a good compromise between accuracy and computational time , we use @xmath30 @xmath31 , which ensures that the results presented here are unaffected by numerical resolution effects .",
    "as mentioned above , once the merging history of the dark matter component has been calculated , it is possible to follow the evolution of the baryonic content in these halos forward in time .",
    "we assume each halo consists of three components : hot gas , cold gas and stars , where the latter two components can be distributed among individual galaxies inside a single dark matter halo .",
    "the stellar components of each galaxy are further divided into bulge and disc , to allow morphological classifications of model galaxies . in the following ,",
    "we describe how the evolution of each component is calculated .",
    "each branch of the merger tree starts at a progenitor mass of @xmath29 and ends at a redshift of @xmath32 .",
    "initially , each halo is occupied by hot primordial gas which was captured in the potential well of the halo and shock - heated to its virial temperature @xmath33 ^ 2 $ ] k , where @xmath34 is the circular velocity of the halo@xcite .",
    "subsequently this hot gas component is allowed to radiatively cool and settles down into a rotationally supported gas disc at the centre of the halo , which we identify as the central galaxy@xcite .",
    "the rate at which hot gas cools down is estimated by calculating the cooling radius inside the halo using the cooling functions provided by @xcite and the prescription in s01 . in the case of a merger between halos we assume that all of the hot gas present in the progenitors gets shock - heated to the virial temperature of the remnant halo , and this gas can cool down only onto the new central galaxy which is the central galaxy of the most massive progenitor halo . the central galaxy of the less massive halo will become a satellite galaxy orbiting inside the remnant halo . in this way , a halo can host multiple satellite galaxies , depending on the merging history of the halo , but will always only host one central galaxy onto which gas can cool .",
    "the cold gas content in satellite galaxies is given by the amount present when they first became satellite galaxies and does not increase , but decreases due to ongoing star formation and supernova feedback .",
    "in the simplified picture adopted above , the amount of gas available to cool down is limited only by the universal baryon fraction @xmath35@xcite . however , in the presence of a photoionising background the fraction of baryons captured in halos is reduced @xcite and we use the recipe of somerville et al.@xcite , which is based on a fitting formulae derived from hydrodynamical simulations@xcite , to estimate the amount of baryons in each halo . for the epoch of reionisation , we assume @xmath36 , which is in agreement with observations of the temperature - polarisation correlation of the cosmic microwave background@xcite .",
    "once cooled gas has settled down in a disc , we allow for fragmentation and subsequent star formation according to a parameterised global schmidt - kennicutt law@xcite of the form @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is a free parameter describing the efficiency of the conversion of cold gas into stars , and @xmath39 is assumed to be the dynamical time of the galaxy and is approximated to be 0.1 times the dynamical time of the dark matter halo@xcite . as in k99 we allow star formation only in halos of @xmath40 km / s to avoid excessively - massive central galaxies in clusters .",
    "feedback from supernovae plays an important role in regulating star formation in small mass halos and in preventing excessively - massive satellite galaxies from forming .",
    "we implement feedback based on the prescription presented in k99 with @xmath41 here we introduce a second free parameter @xmath42 which represents our ignorance about the efficiency with which the energy from supernovae reheats the cold gas .",
    "the expected number of supernovae per solar mass of stars formed is given by @xmath43 , taken as the value for the scalo initial mass function@xcite , and @xmath44 erg is the energy output from each supernova .",
    "we take @xmath34 as the circular velocity of the halo in which the galaxy was last present as a central galaxy .",
    "we allow for mergers between galaxies residing in a single halo .",
    "as mentioned earlier , each halo is occupied by one central galaxy and a number of satellite galaxies depending on the past merging history of the halo .",
    "whenever two halos merge , the galaxies inside them are going to merge on a time - scale which we calculate by estimating the time it would take the satellite to reach the centre of the halo under the effects of dynamical friction .",
    "satellites are assumed to merge only with central galaxies and we set up their orbits in the halo according to the prescription of k99 , modified to use the coulomb logarithm approximation of s01 .",
    "if the mass ratio between the two merging galaxies is @xmath45 ( @xmath46 ) we declare the event as a _",
    "major _ merger and the remnant will be an elliptical galaxy and the stellar components and the gas will be treated according to the prescriptions below . in the case of _ minor _ merger @xmath47 the cold gas in the disc of the smaller progenitor",
    "is assumed to settle down in the gas disc of the remnant and its stars contribute to the bulge component of the remnant@xcite .",
    "it is suggested that major mergers will lead to the formation of elliptical galaxies@xcite .",
    "indeed detailed numerical simulations in the last decade seem to support this hypothesis@xcite , and we wil assume in the following that major mergers disrupt the discs in progenitor galaxies as seen in various numerical simulations and relax to a spheroidal distribution . during the merger , any cold gas in the discs of the progenitor galaxies",
    "is assumed to be funnelled into the centre of the remnant where it ignites a starburst which transforms all of the cold gas into stars contributing to the spheroidal component@xcite .",
    "the second assumption is certainly a simplification of what might happen since we neglect the possibility that not all of the cold gas is funnelled to the centre but some fraction of it may for example settle down onto an extended disk which continues to grow inside - out by fresh supply of gas from tidal tails@xcite .",
    "the results of barnes@xcite indicate that @xmath48 of the initial gas in the disc could end up in the central region of the remnant and be consumed in a starburst .",
    "the exact amount is somewhat dependent on the merger geometry and on the mass ratio of the merger .",
    "unfortunately , a sufficiently large survey investigating the gas inflow to the centres of merger remnants is not available yet , so we use the simplified approach of assuming that all cold gas gets used up in the central starburst .",
    "this prescription for the fate of the cold gas results in an overestimate of the spheroid masses and an underestimate of the secondary disc components in our model .",
    "this is not very significant for massive ellipticals since they are mainly formed in relatively non - dissipative mergers@xcite .",
    "we here follow the model introduced in kauffmann & haehnelt@xcite in which super - massive black holes get formed and fed during major mergers of glaxies .",
    "the assumption is to say that a fraction of the the cold gas available in the progenitor discs , that is funnelled into the centre of the remnant , will be accreted onto the black hole .",
    "kaufmann & haehnelt introduced the following scaling law for the effectivness of this procces : @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the amount of cold gas available in the progenitor disks , @xmath34 the circular velocity of the dark matter halo and @xmath51 a free parameter .",
    "this scaling provides a good fit to the observed relation between the mass of the super - massive black hole and the velocity dispersion of a galaxy@xcite .",
    "following croton et al.@xcite we here assume the velocity dispersion of a galaxy to be identical to the circular velocity of the dark halo the galaxy is embedded in",
    ". this however is not strictly true as e.g. in the case of an isothermal sphere @xmath52 .",
    "several authors have investigated the correlation between @xmath34 and @xmath3@xcite and found different correlations .",
    "we here note that using a different scaling between @xmath34 and @xmath3 in our models still produces the same @xmath53relation if we adjust the free parameter @xmath51 accordingly .",
    "we here introduce a new prescription for the modelling of feedback from super - massive black holes , which is based on the results presented in this paper . according to our analyses a critical black hole mass exists for a given galaxy velocity dispersion @xmath3 , at",
    "which feedback is so strong that it reheats all the available cold gas and hence prevents further star formation .",
    "this critical black hole mass is derived from our empirical fit to the residual star formation fraction found in our data as @xmath54 in galaxies with black holes more massive than the corresponding critical black hole mass we stop any cooling of gas and star formation .",
    "we callibrate this relation to give the right fraction of rsf galaxies as seen in figure 1 .",
    "we normalise our two model parameters for the star formation efficiency @xmath38 and supernova feedback efficiency @xmath55 by matching the @xmath56band tully - fisher relation of giovanelli et al.@xcite and requiring that spiral central galaxies of halos with circular velocity @xmath57 km / s have on average @xmath58 m@xmath59 of stars and @xmath60 m@xmath59 of cold gas@xcite .",
    "the third free parameter @xmath51 , which regulates the black hole growth is set to match the observed @xmath53relation and is @xmath61 .",
    "we derive the @xmath62 colour-@xmath3 relation for the virgo cluster down to much smaller values of @xmath3 than in our galex - sdss sample by combining the near - uv and optical photometry from boselli et al.@xcite with velocity dispersion measurements from the goldmine database .",
    "the purpose of looking at the virgo cluster galaxies is to constrain the low end of the @xmath3 and so get an idea of the point at which all galaxies are rsf galaxies and thus below critical . since the optical photometry of the virgo galaxies in this sample are in v - band , we approximately convert the rsf criterion of _ _ nuv - r__=5.4 to _ nuv - v_. we use simple stellar populations of solar metallicity and three ages ( 3,6 and 9 gyr ) to derive the _ nuv - v _ rsf criterion ; these are _ _ nuv - v__= 5.16 , 5.12 and 5.09 respectively . in all three cases ,",
    "the point at which no virgo early - type galaxy is above this cutoff - i.e. all show some signs of young populations - is at @xmath63 .",
    "we use _ nuv - r _ colour as a discriminant between those galaxies which are quiescent and those which show signs of recent star formation . besides agn",
    ", there is one further effect which can mimic young stars in the near - uv .",
    "extremely old stellar populations can give rise to the uv upturn phenomenon in some early - type galaxies@xcite .",
    "we choose the _ nuv - r _ colour of one of the strongest uv upturn galaxies ngc 4552@xcite to be the boundary between galaxies with no young component on the one hand and those that are so blue they must have some young stars in them .",
    "although still quite limited , theoretical population synthesis models which are supported by empirical data ( lee et al.@xcite ) also suggest that the nuv - r of passively evolving etgs could not be much bluer than 5.4 . using this criterion , we compute the fraction of galaxies that must have experienced some star formation within the last billion years .",
    "the ages and mass fractions of these young stellar components are generally 300 - 500 myr and 1 - 3% by mass@xcite . due to the high sensitivity to dust extinction , these fractions are a lower limit as cold gas and dust have been detected in many early - type galaxies@xcite . _ nuv - r _ probes recent star formation for up to 1 gyr and so traces different time scales than those of agn feedback .",
    "so there may be a certain amount of time lag between the uv emissions and the processes underlying feedback .",
    "the process and criteria of the visual inspection are described in detail in schawinski et al.@xcite . in summary , we find early - type galaxy ( etg ) candidates from the sdss database using @xmath64 parameter , which is the weight of the de vaucouleurs component in the two - component ( de vaucouleurs and exponential disc ) fits .",
    "we use @xmath65 , which is a highly conservative criterion , hoping to exclude as many spiral interpolers as possible . despite this , still some spiral bulges remain in our sample .",
    "hence , we remove them via visual inspection on @xmath66 bands@xcite .",
    "since visual inspections are also subject to errors , we investigat out to what redshift and apparent magnitude visual inspection based on sdss images is reliable by comparing them with one of the combo-17 fields overlapping sdss .",
    "the combo-17 image is significantly deeper and has much better seeing with 0.7 `` as opposed to 1.4 '' which are typical for sdss . by comparing our classification based on these two different data sets",
    ", we concluded that visual inspection of morphology using sdss was possible to z @xmath67 0.13 and r @xmath68 .",
    "we settle on more conservative limits of z @xmath69 0.1 and r @xmath69 16.8 .",
    "the presence of late - type interlopers with star - forming disks or spiral arms is therefore not a significant concern and does not give rise to the correlations between @xmath70 , @xmath3 and nuv - r color .",
    "a selection of sample images with their velocity dispersions are shown in figure [ vi_ex ] ."
