    "over the last few years , we have witnessed renewed interest in the spectral line polarization produced by the presence of population imbalances and quantum interferences ( or coherences ) among the magnetic sublevels of atomic energy levels ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "this so - called atomic level polarization is typically produced by anisotropic radiation pumping processes , which are particularly efficient in the outer layers of stellar atmospheres , where the depolarizing effect of isotropic collisions tends to be negligible .",
    "particular attention has been given to coherences between pairs of magnetic sublevels pertaining to each particular @xmath0-level of the atomic model under consideration ( @xmath0 being the level s total angular momentum ) .",
    "the sensitivity of these coherences to the hanle effect produces changes in the linear polarization of the emergent spectral line radiation , which can be exploited for detecting magnetic fields that are too weak and/or too tangled so as to produce measurable zeeman polarization signals .    in general , quantum interferences",
    "are also present between pairs of magnetic sublevels pertaining to different @xmath0-levels .",
    "it is known that this kind of coherences may produce observable effects in the wings of some spectral lines .",
    "perhaps the most illustrative solar example is the @xmath9 pattern observed by @xcite across the ca ii h and k lines ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which shows a positive signal at the core of the k line ( @xmath10 and @xmath11 ) , a sign reversal between the two lines , and zero polarization at the center of the h line ( @xmath10 and @xmath12 ) . that peculiar @xmath9 pattern could be explained by @xcite using a simple theoretical model that accounts for the possibility of quantum interferences between the two upper @xmath0-levels of the ca  ii resonance lines .",
    "a rigorous theoretical framework for describing the spectral line polarization produced by radiatively induced population imbalances and quantum coherences , in the presence of arbitrary magnetic fields , is the density - matrix theory described in the monograph `` polarization in spectral lines '' ( landi deglinnocenti & landolfi 2004 , hereafter ll04 ) .",
    "this theory is based on the hypothesis that the pumping radiation field has no spectral structure over frequency intervals larger than the frequency separation between the interfering levels ( flat - spectrum approximation ) .",
    "because of this approximation , the theory is very suitable for treating spectral lines that can be described under the hypothesis of complete frequency redistribution ( crd ) , while it can not account for the effects of partial redistribution in frequency ( prd ) . despite of this limitation",
    ", this theory represents the most robust quantum approach to the physics of polarization developed so far .",
    "in particular , it accounts for the role of quantum interferences in a very general , self - consistent way ( e.g. , the review by * ? ? ?",
    "as a matter of fact , although the ca  ii h and k lines are 35   apart ( the flat - spectrum approximation thus appearing rather restrictive ) , the theory explains very well the sign reversal observed in the blue wing of the h line in terms of coherences between the two upper levels of these lines ( see ll04 ) .",
    "theoretical approaches aimed at including prd effects in the presence of @xmath0-state interferences can be found in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "it is known that interferences between pairs of magnetic sublevels pertaining to different @xmath0-levels are the smaller the larger the energy separation between them .",
    "when this separation is large , their effects are negligible in the core of the lines , becoming more important in the far wings ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ll04 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "far from line center the line emissivity is very low , and the presence of the continuum generally masks the effects of such interferences . because of these basic arguments , interferences between different @xmath0-levels are usually neglected when investigating the scattering polarization properties of many spectral lines , with a considerable simplification of the problem .",
    "however , this kind of qualitative considerations should not be applied as rigorous rules , as testified by the ca  ii h and k lines and by several other signals of the linearly - polarized solar limb spectrum ( or second solar spectrum ) which show the signatures of this kind of interferences ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "as far as the solar ca  ii h and k lines are considered , it is now clear that the reason why quantum interferences between such significantly separated lines produce observable effects is because these strong lines have very extended wings , so that the continuum is not immediately reached when moving away from line center , and because the large optical depth of the solar atmosphere compensates for the low line emissivity at the wavelengths where that observational signature appears ( cf .",
    "* ll04 ) .    in this paper , we present a systematic theoretical investigation of the role of quantum interferences between different @xmath0-levels",
    ". we aim at clarifying their observable effects in various interesting multiplets and at providing a series of general criteria for establishing under which circumstances their effects are expected to be observable , and when , on the contrary , the modeling of spectropolarimetric observations can be safely carried out ignoring their contribution .",
    "the investigation is carried out within the framework of the above - mentioned quantum theory of polarization .",
    "after briefly introducing the density - matrix formalism ( section  2 ) , and presenting the scattering polarization model that is applied for our investigation ( section  3 ) , we start focusing the attention on the @xmath2 multiplet , the simplest one where interferences between different @xmath0-levels occur ( section  4 ) . we show that although the large energy separation generally present between different @xmath0-levels makes this kind of interferences usually very small , as far as fractional polarization signals ( i.e. , ratios , such as @xmath9 ) are considered , their effects are not necessarily negligible .",
    "indeed , when only line processes are considered ( no continuum ) , the fractional polarization patterns obtained taking into account and neglecting these interferences coincide within a small spectral interval around the center of the lines , but are found to be very different at all other wavelengths , even when the @xmath0-levels are very separated from each other ( see section  4.2 ) .",
    "particular attention is given to the analysis of the effects of the doppler broadening of the lines , a physical aspect that is found to play an important role for establishing where and when such interferences can be neglected .",
    "as previously mentioned , what makes the effects of interferences between different @xmath0-levels vanish in the observed polarization patterns is the continuum , which starts dominating over the line emissivity moving from the line center to the wings . in section  4.3 ,",
    "we show that the amount of continuum needed to mask the signatures of such interferences is the larger the smaller the separation between the @xmath0-levels .",
    "the effects of interferences are thus expected to be observable either when the interfering lines have very extended wings , so that the continuum is not immediately reached between them ( as in the case of the ca  ii h and k lines ) , or when the separation between the @xmath0-levels is sufficiently small but , as we will see , still large when compared to the doppler width of the corresponding spectral lines .    in the first part of the paper , we analyze the scattering polarization profiles of hypothetical multiplets characterized by different values of the energy separation between the interfering @xmath0-levels , of the doppler width , and of the continuum intensity .",
    "the results of this analysis , and their consequences for practical applications , are then investigated in detail on various multiplets of particular interest for the diagnostics of the magnetism of the solar atmosphere ( sections  4.5 , 5 , 6 , and 7 ) .",
    "the effects due to the presence of magnetic fields of various intensities and configurations are also investigated ( section  8) .",
    "a convenient way to describe the populations of the various magnetic sublevels of an atomic system , as well as the quantum interferences between pairs of them , is through the matrix elements of the density operator .",
    "the density operator is a very useful theoretical tool for describing any physical system which is in a statistical mixture of states ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "if @xmath13 , @xmath14 ,  , @xmath15 ,  , are the probabilities for a given physical system of being in the dynamical states represented by the vectors @xmath16 , @xmath17 ,  , @xmath18 ,  , respectively , the corresponding density operator is defined by @xmath19 as any other quantum operator , also the density operator is completely specified once its matrix elements , evaluated on a given basis of the hilbert space associated with the physical system , are known .",
    "the matrix elements of the density operator contain all the accessible information about the system .    on the basis of the atomic energy eigenvectors @xmath20 ,",
    "the matrix elements of the density operator are given by @xmath21 the diagonal elements represent the populations of the various energy levels , while the off - diagonal elements represent the quantum interferences between pairs of them .",
    "on this basis , the statistical equilibrium equations ( sees ) for the atomic density matrix are given by ( see equation  ( 6.62 ) of ll04 ) @xmath22 \\nonumber \\\\   & & - \\sum_{m^{\\prime \\prime } } \\big [ \\rho_{mm^{\\prime \\prime } } \\,r_{e } ( m^{\\prime \\prime},m , m^{\\prime } ) + \\rho_{m^{\\prime \\prime}m^{\\prime } } \\,r_{e } ( m , m^{\\prime},m^{\\prime \\prime } ) \\big ] \\nonumber \\\\   & & - \\sum_{m^{\\prime \\prime } } \\big [ \\rho_{mm^{\\prime \\prime } } \\,r_{s } ( m^{\\prime \\prime},m , m^{\\prime } ) + \\rho_{m^{\\prime \\prime}m^{\\prime } } \\,r_{s } ( m , m^{\\prime},m^{\\prime \\prime } ) \\big ] \\;\\ ; .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] these equations describe the transfer ( @xmath23 rates ) and relaxation ( @xmath24 rates ) of populations and coherences due to absorption ( index @xmath25 ) , spontaneous emission ( index @xmath26 ) , and stimulated emission ( index @xmath27 ) processes .",
    "they also describe the effects due to the presence of a magnetic field . a complete derivation of these equations , as well as the explicit expression of the various rates can be found in ll04 .    here",
    "we focus our attention on the first term in the right - hand side of equations  ( [ eq : see ] ) . this term , proportional to the bohr frequency @xmath28 , with @xmath29 the energy of level @xmath18 and @xmath30 the planck constant , is zero both for populations",
    "( i.e. , for the diagonal elements @xmath31 ) and for coherences between degenerate levels , while it produces a relaxation of coherences between pairs of non - degenerate levels .",
    "the coherence @xmath32 is thus the smaller , the larger the energy separation between the levels @xmath33 and @xmath34 . modifying the frequency separations @xmath35 among the various magnetic sublevels , a magnetic field modulates , through this term , the corresponding coherences @xmath32 , and consequently the polarization of the emitted radiation .",
    "this is the basic physical mechanism at the origin of the so - called hanle effect .    finally , it is important to recall that equations  ( [ eq : see ] ) are valid under the so - called flat - spectrum approximation .",
    "this approximation requires the pumping radiation field to be spectrally flat over frequency intervals larger than the bohr frequency relating pairs of levels between which quantum interferences are considered , and larger than the inverse lifetime of the same levels .    for an atomic system devoid of hyperfine structure ( hfs ) ,",
    "the matrix elements of the density operator are often defined on the basis of the eigenvectors of the angular momentum , with @xmath0 and @xmath36 the quantum numbers associated with the total angular momentum and to its projection along the quantization axis , and @xmath8 a set of inner quantum numbers associated with the atomic hamiltonian coupling scheme , @xmath8 could represent , for example , the set of quantum numbers ( @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath27 ) which describe the electronic configuration , the total orbital angular momentum , and the total electronic spin . ] . on this basis , the matrix elements of the density operator are @xmath39 the diagonal elements represent the populations of the various magnetic sublevels , while the off - diagonal elements the quantum interferences between pairs of them .",
    "an atomic model accounting for coherences between pairs of magnetic sublevels pertaining either to the same @xmath0-level or to different @xmath0-levels within the same term is generally referred to as `` multi - term atom '' ( see section  7.5 of ll04 ) . in this case",
    ", the flat - spectrum approximation requires the radiation field incident on the atom to be flat over frequency intervals larger than the frequency separation among the @xmath0-levels belonging to each term .",
    "this implies that the incident radiation field must be flat across the frequency interval covered by the transitions of a given multiplet .",
    "when coherences between different @xmath0-levels are neglected , the corresponding atomic model is generally referred to as `` multi - level atom '' ( see section  7.1 of ll04 ) . in this case , the flat - spectrum approximation is less restrictive , since it requires the radiation field to be constant across frequency intervals larger than the zeeman splitting among the various magnetic sublevels pertaining to each @xmath0-level , and larger than their inverse lifetimes . in a multi - level atom , the incident radiation field can thus vary across the frequency interval spanned by the transitions of a given multiplet .",
    "the sees equations and the expressions of the radiative transfer coefficients for a multi - term and a multi - level atom can be found in chapter 7 of ll04 .",
    "in order to analyze the effects of interferences between different @xmath0-levels , we consider an atomic system composed of two terms ( each being characterized by the total orbital angular momentum @xmath38 , by the total electronic spin @xmath27 , and by given fine - structure ( fs ) splittings of the various @xmath0-levels ) , and we compare the polarization patterns of the radiation emitted across the transitions of the corresponding multiplet as obtained both taking into account and neglecting such coherences ( i.e. , as calculated within the framework of a two - term atomic model , which accounts for such interferences , and within the framework of the corresponding multi - level atomic model , which neglects them ) .",
    "although in the multi - level atom case the pumping radiation field can be different at the frequencies of the various transitions of the multiplet , in order to analyze the net effect of the coherences between different @xmath0-levels , we consider the same incident field , flat across the whole frequency interval of the multiplet , both in the case of the two - term atom , and in the case of the corresponding multi - level atom .",
    "interferences between different @xmath0-levels have a double role : on one hand they enter the sees and therefore , in principle , their presence may modify populations and interferences within the same @xmath0-level with respect to the case in which they are neglected ; on the other hand they contribute ( exactly as populations and interferences within the same @xmath0-level do ) to the radiative transfer coefficients .",
    "we focus our attention on the radiation scattered at @xmath40 by a plane - parallel slab of plasma illuminated by the solar continuum radiation field . in this simple scenario ,",
    "the fractional polarization of the scattered radiation can be calculated through the approximate formula ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) @xmath41 where @xmath42 and @xmath43 ( @xmath44 ) are the line emission and absorption coefficients , respectively , in the four stokes parameters , while @xmath45 and @xmath46 are the continuum intensity emission and absorption coefficients , respectively .",
    "the incident continuum radiation is assumed to have axial symmetry around the normal to the slab ( the local vertical ) , to be unpolarized , and to be flat over the frequency intervals covered by the multiplets that will be considered in this investigation . the reference direction for positive @xmath47",
    "is assumed perpendicular to the scattering plane .",
    "the doppler width used in the calculation of the line emission and absorption coefficients is derived from the temperature and microturbulent velocity of a solar model atmosphere at the height where the line - center optical depth is unity , for an observation at @xmath48 .",
    "the semi - empirical atmospheric model @xmath49 of @xcite has been used .",
    "the first step is to write down and solve the sees for the given incident ( pumping ) continuum radiation field .",
    "we describe the incident radiation through the radiation field tensor @xmath50 ( see equation  ( 5.157 ) of ll04 for its definition ) , taking the quantization axis along the local vertical .",
    "due to the cylindrical symmetry of the incident continuum radiation around this direction , only two components of the radiation field tensor are non - zero : @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "the former describes the average intensity of the radiation field over all the directions of propagation , while the latter gives a measure of the anisotropy of the radiation field . under such circumstances",
    ", it is customary to describe the radiation field through two equivalent dimensionless quantities , the mean number of photons per mode ( @xmath53 ) and the anisotropy factor ( @xmath54 ) , defined by ( ll04 ) @xmath55    in the absence of magnetic fields and of other mechanisms able to break the cylindrical symmetry of the problem , if the quantization axis is taken along the symmetry axis ( as we are assuming here ) , the only interferences that can be excited are those between pairs of magnetic sublevels pertaining to different @xmath0-levels and characterized by the same value of the magnetic quantum number @xmath36 .",
    "these are exactly the interferences that we are going to investigate in the following sections .",
    "once the sees are solved , and the density - matrix elements are known , we calculate the line emission and absorption coefficients appearing in equation  ( [ eq : emer - pol ] ) , according to the expressions given in ll04 ( chapter 7 )",
    ". the continuum emission coefficient @xmath45 will be a free parameter of the problem , used to analyze the effect of the continuum in masking the observational signatures of the coherences under investigation .",
    "the value of the continuum absorption coefficient is calculated here through the equation @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the planck function at the wavelength of the transition under investigation and at the temperature chosen for the calculation of the doppler width of each line , as previously discussed .",
    "we start our investigation considering the @xmath2 multiplet , the simplest one where interferences between different @xmath0-levels occur , and one of the most interesting given the large number of strong spectral lines belonging to this multiplet that are observed on the sun ( ca  ii h and k , mg  ii h and k , na  i d@xmath5 and d@xmath6 , ly@xmath8 , etc . ) .",
    "this multiplet consists of the following two transitions : @xmath58 ( transition of h or d@xmath5 type , in the following referred to as transition 1 ) and @xmath59 ( transition of k or d@xmath6 type , in the following referred to as transition 2 ) .",
    "we want to investigate the effects of the quantum interferences between the upper levels @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",
    "since the common lower level of the transitions of this multiplet , having @xmath62 , can not be polarized by the unpolarized incident radiation field , the sees considerably simplify with respect to the general case .",
    "moreover , @xmath63 so that the second term in the right - hand side of equation  ( [ eq : emer - pol ] ) , which describes the effects of dichroism , does not bring any contribution to the emergent polarization .",
    "if stimulation effects are neglected ( which is a good approximation in the solar atmosphere ) , and no magnetic fields are considered , it is possible to find an analytical solution of the sees , and rather simple analytical expressions for the ratio @xmath64 , both in the case in which the interferences between the two upper @xmath0-levels are taken into account , and in the case in which they are neglected ( see equations  ( [ eq : eps3lp ] ) and ( [ eq : eps2tp ] ) in the appendix ) .",
    "the @xmath65 profiles obtained taking into account ( solid line ) and neglecting ( dashed line ) interferences between the upper @xmath0-levels , assuming @xmath66 and a wavelength separation between the two components @xmath67 , with @xmath68 the doppler width of the two lines , are plotted in panel @xmath69 of figure  [ fig : pq - gen ] .        as seen in the figure ,",
    "the two profiles coincide in the core of the two lines , while they are very different at all the other wavelengths ( cf .",
    "the most remarkable difference is the sign reversal between the two lines shown by the @xmath65 profile calculated taking into account interferences .",
    "this particular signature of the quantum interferences between the two upper @xmath0-levels has been clearly observed between the h and k lines of ca  ii ( see * ? ? ?",
    "the negligible contribution of interferences between different @xmath0-levels in the center of the single lines of an arbitrary multiplet has already been discussed in section  10.17 of ll04 , where an analytical expression for the value of @xmath65 in the core of the lines is derived ( cf .",
    "equation  ( [ eq : pq-2tcore ] ) ) .    as discussed in ll04 , under the hypotheses previously introduced , the asymptotic value of @xmath65 for an arbitrary two - term atom is equal to the ( constant ) @xmath65 value of a two - level atom with @xmath70 and @xmath71 .",
    "the analytical expression of @xmath65 for a two - level atom can be found in the appendix ( equation  ( [ eq : pq-2l ] ) ) .      as shown by equations  ( [ eq : eps3lp ] ) and ( [ eq : eps2tp ] ) ,",
    "the quantity @xmath65 , as calculated both taking into account and neglecting interferences between different @xmath0-levels , depends on the value of @xmath54 but not on the value of @xmath53 .",
    ", as implicit in equations  ( [ eq : eps3lp ] ) and ( [ eq : eps2tp ] ) which are derived neglecting stimulation effects . ] concerning the dependence on the anisotropy factor , it should be observed that for small values of @xmath54 the second term in the denominator of equations  ( [ eq : eps3lp ] ) and ( [ eq : eps2tp ] ) can be neglected with respect to the first one , so that @xmath54 represents just a scaling factor of the whole profiles .",
    "this property can be clearly appreciated from figure  [ fig : w - dep ] , where the absolute value of the ratio between the values of @xmath65 ( calculated taking into account interferences ) at line center of transition 2 and at the wavelength position of the ( negative ) minimum , is plotted as a function of the anisotropy factor .",
    "the value of @xmath65 at line center of transition 2 is given by equation  ( [ eq : pq-2tcore ] ) , while it is not possible to find a simple analytical expression for the amplitude of the negative dip . as it can be observed from the figure , the above - mentioned ratio is constant and very close to unity for values of @xmath54 smaller than 0.1 . for these values , which are those that are commonly encountered in the solar atmosphere ,",
    "the anisotropy factor is just a scaling factor of the whole @xmath65 profile .",
    "numerical calculations show that the position of the minimum does not depend on the particular value of @xmath54 .",
    "if not explicitly stated , all the results presented throughout this investigation are obtained assuming @xmath72 and @xmath73 .      as shown in panels @xmath7 and @xmath74 of figure  [ fig : pq - gen ] , at the wavelength positions of the two transitions , the @xmath65 profiles obtained taking into account and neglecting interferences coincide and are constant over a wavelength interval of about five doppler widths . the mathematical and physical origin of these `` plateaux '' is discussed in the appendix , where it is shown that their boundaries are determined by the wavelength positions at which the behavior of the corresponding voigt profiles changes from gaussian to lorentzian .",
    "since the extension of the plateaux does not show significant variations with the wavelength separation between the two components of the multiplet , their presence only marginally affects the @xmath65 profile when the separation between the two components is much larger than the doppler width of the two lines ( see panel @xmath69 of figures  [ fig : pq - gen ] and [ fig : dl - dep ] ) , while it starts modifying the overall shape of the @xmath65 profiles when the distance between the two components is of the same order of magnitude as the doppler width of the lines ( see panel @xmath7 of figure  [ fig : dl - dep ] ) .        when the wavelength separation between the two components is equal or smaller than the extension of the two plateaux , these start merging , so that between the two lines all the signatures of the interferences between the upper @xmath0-levels ( such as the negativity previously discussed ) disappear ( see panels @xmath74 and @xmath75 of figure  [ fig : dl - dep ] ) . since the width of each plateau is about five doppler widths , it is important to observe that their merging , and therefore the disappearance of the effects of the interferences , starts when the intensity profiles of the two lines are still separated from each other ( see panel @xmath74 of figure  [ fig : dl - dep ] ) by an optically thin slab . ] .",
    "the effects of interferences become appreciable in the line - core when the separation between the two components is of the same order of magnitude as the width of the two interfering @xmath0-levels . indeed , in the limiting case in which the separation between the two levels goes to zero , the effects ( and in particular the depolarizing effect ) of the fine structure have to disappear , and the polarization pattern of a two - level atom with @xmath70 and @xmath71 must be recovered ( because of the principle of spectroscopic stability ) .",
    "this effect is shown in panels @xmath76 and @xmath77 of figure  [ fig : dl - dep ] , where a frequency separation between the two components of the same order of magnitude as the einstein coefficient for spontaneous emission has been considered .",
    "it must be observed that the fs splitting of the various @xmath0-levels is always much larger ( also in the case of hydrogen ) than the natural width of the levels .",
    "for example , in the case of the ly@xmath8 line , the separation between the two fs components is of the order of 10@xmath78 s@xmath79 , while the einstein coefficient for spontaneous emission is equal to .",
    "however , we have to remind that collisions ( here neglected ) may have an important role on these phenomena ( both for their broadening and depolarizing effect ) .",
    "another interesting result to be pointed out is that when the separation between the two components is smaller than the doppler width of the two lines , so that the two plateaux completely merge , the fs depolarizing effect takes place on a wavelength interval of about five doppler widths ( the width of a single plateau ) , independently of the actual separation between the two components .",
    "we now analyze how the fractional polarization profiles previously obtained taking into account only line processes are modified when the contribution of an unpolarized continuum is added according to equation  ( [ eq : emer - pol ] ) .",
    "as shown by the various panels of figure  [ fig : cont - dep ] , the main effect of the continuum is to make the fractional polarization vanish as one moves from the core of the lines toward the wings .",
    "although this overall effect makes the patterns obtained taking into account and neglecting interferences coincide , if the continuum is not too strong , clear signatures of the interferences between different @xmath0-levels can still be noticed .",
    "let us consider first the case in which the wavelength separation between the two transitions is much larger than the doppler width ( figure  [ fig : cont - dep ] , panels @xmath69 and @xmath7 ) .",
    "as far as the profile calculated taking into account interferences is concerned , we observe that if the continuum is not sufficiently strong , the maximum value of the polarization is not found at the center of transition 2 , but at slightly shorter wavelengths .",
    "this circumstance can be seen in the observations of the ca  ii h and k system ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the amount of continuum needed in order to make the maximum signal falling at the center of transition 2 is the larger the smaller the wavelength separation between the two components .",
    "the presence of the continuum reduces the negativity of the @xmath9 pattern between the two transitions , it moves the negative minimum toward the wavelength position of transition 1 , but it does not affect the wavelength position of the sign reversals . moreover , it produces a positive peak in the red wing of transition 1 , so that an antisymmetrical profile across this component appears .",
    "this latter effect , due to interferences between the different @xmath0-levels of the upper term , can be clearly observed across the na  i d@xmath5 line ( see * ? ? ?",
    "as the value of the continuum is increased , the amplitude of this antisymmetrical pattern is decreased , and the overall profile becomes more similar to the one obtained neglecting interferences .",
    "the amount of continuum needed for this signature to be cancelled out is the larger the smaller the wavelength separation between the two components ( this explains why this structure can be observed across the d@xmath5 line of na  i , but not across the corresponding ba  ii line at 4934   ) .",
    "we consider now the opposite case in which the various components are very close to each other with respect to the doppler width of the single lines ( figure  [ fig : cont - dep ] , panels @xmath74 and @xmath75 ) . in this case , as previously discussed , interferences between different @xmath0-levels do not produce any observable effect across a spectral interval of about five doppler widths centered at the wavelength of the two transitions , irrespectively of the continuum value . just outside this interval ,",
    "on the other hand , the @xmath9 profile obtained taking into account interferences shows , if the continuum is not too strong , two peaks .",
    "these @xmath9 peaks disappear as the value of the continuum is increased .",
    "it should be emphasized that the physical origin of this two - peak structure , which is obtained only when interferences are taken into account , lies in the way the continuum is included in the slab model we are considering here .",
    "this does not mean that it is an artifact , but it is clear that its reliability is intimately related to the suitability of the model that we are using .",
    "we finally observe that for the same value of the continuum , the @xmath9 profiles obtained taking into account interferences always show more extended wings than the corresponding profiles obtained neglecting them .",
    "all the results shown in this investigation are based on the slab model described in section  [ sect : model ] , which allows us to study the polarization properties of the scattered radiation through the approximate analytical expression of equation  ( [ eq : emer - pol ] ) .",
    "this allows us to analyze in great detail the atomic aspects of the problem , without introducing the complications due to radiative transfer processes in stratified model atmospheres ) describes the possibility of dichroism ( i.e. , selective absorption of polarization components ) , which is absent in optically thin media . ] .",
    "the analysis of the effects of radiative transfer on the polarization signatures produced by interferences between different @xmath0-levels is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "nevertheless , we can make some brief , qualitative considerations on this topic .",
    "the main consequence of radiative transfer is that , depending on its frequency across the spectral line profile , the scattered radiation comes from different atmospheric heights , characterized by different values of the anisotropy factor of the local radiation field .",
    "the fractional polarization patterns previously obtained using a single value of the anisotropy factor will thus be modified by radiative transfer effects , through a modulation on the different values of @xmath54 .",
    "such modifications will take place mainly between the center and the wings of the single spectral lines .",
    "very likely , when radiative transfer effects in solar atmospheric models are considered , the amplitude and shape of the @xmath9 profile around the line center will be different from those shown in the plots of figure  [ fig : cont - dep ] .",
    "for example , we believe that the flat plateaux previously discussed will not be obtained , or will be different . on the other hand , the results of the analysis of the spectral intervals where the effects of interferences are negligible , and where the fs depolarization takes place , should remain valid , as well as the qualitative shapes of the signatures of interferences , as far as these appear in the far wings of the lines , where assuming a constant value of @xmath54 is quite a good approximation .    finally , we emphasize that , despite of its simplicity , the slab model of section  3 has already been applied with success for interpreting several peculiarities observed in scattering polarization signals ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , thus showing that it represents a suitable approximation , at least for the modeling and understanding of the physical mechanisms producing polarization in the solar atmosphere .",

    "for all these ions , the wavelength separation between the two lines of the multiplet is much larger than their doppler width , so that , depending on the continuum emissivity , patterns similar to those shown in panels @xmath69 and @xmath7 of figure  [ fig : cont - dep ] are obtained .    comparing the profiles of the various ions plotted in figure  [ fig : bana ] ,",
    "it can be clearly observed how the amount of continuum needed for masking the signatures of interferences is the larger the smaller the separation between the two lines .",

    "these signatures , on the other hand , are still observable in calcium , magnesium and sodium , if the same continuum is considered . from figure",
    "[ fig : bana ] , it can also be observed that for the wavelength separation of the magnesium ( and sodium ) lines , the amount of continuum needed in order to obtain a given ratio between the amplitude of the negative minimum ( in absolute value ) and the amplitude of the polarization peak of the k ( or d@xmath6 ) line is more than 10 times stronger than in the case of the calcium lines . in agreement with these considerations ,",
    "the above - mentioned signatures of interferences between different @xmath0-levels can be clearly observed in calcium and sodium , but not in barium .",
    "unfortunately , there are no high sensitivity observations available as far as the h and k lines of mg  ii are concerned .",
    "the fact that these two lines are very close to each other ( their separation is similar to that between the sodium d - lines ) , and with very extended wings ( so that , as in the case of calcium , the continuum is not completely reached between them ) , suggests that these signatures should be observable also across these lines . on the other hand , at the wavelength position of these lines the continuum is very strong , and has a very high degree of linear polarization , whose effect should be carefully taken into account .",
    "we note that no sign reversal was found in the pioneering observations of these @xmath9 signals performed by @xcite using the ultraviolet spectrometer and polarimeter on board of the _ solar maximum mission _ satellite , which however was not designed for detecting weak scattering polarization signals .    as a last example of @xmath2 multiplet",
    ", we consider the h  i ly@xmath81 line ( see figure  [ fig : ly - alpha ] ) .        since the separation between the two components is in this case much smaller than the doppler width of the line , the profiles that are obtained for different values of the continuum are very similar to those shown in panels @xmath74 and @xmath75 of figure  [ fig : cont - dep ] .",
    "as previously pointed out , in this case interferences do not produce any effect in the core of the line , across a wavelength interval of about five doppler widths .",

    "signatures of interferences between the upper @xmath0-levels , consisting of two peaks appearing in the wings of the line , might be produced if the continuum is sufficiently weak ( of the order of 10@xmath82 or smaller ) .",
    "however , we already pointed out that these features in the calculated @xmath9 profile might be due to the simple slab model that we are using and that might not be obtained once radiative transfer effects are properly taken into account .",

    "we emphasize that this is a consequence of the flat - spectrum approximation required for the theory of the two - term atom to hold .",
    "if we describe this triplet within the framework of a multi - level atom approach , so that we are allowed to consider a pumping field which varies among the various transitions , the @xmath99 coefficient will be in general different from zero , also under the hypothesis of unpolarized lower levels ( see * ? ? ?",
    "nevertheless , @xcite showed that the presence of a given amount of atomic polarization in the lower levels of this triplet is required in order to explain the observations presented in @xcite , which show @xmath9 signals of the same amplitude in all the three lines .",
    "although lower - term polarization plays an important role in the mg  i @xmath7-lines , interferences between different lower @xmath0-levels are found to produce negligible effects on the @xmath103 pattern of this multiplet ( see panel @xmath69 of figure  [ fig : mgi ] ) .",
    "this result implies that the atomic polarization of the upper level is practically unaffected by the presence of this kind of interferences in the sees ( as already pointed out in section  10.21 of ll04 ) .",
    "interestingly , interferences between different lower @xmath0-levels are found to play a negligible role also on the ratio @xmath104 ( see panel @xmath74 of figure  [ fig : mgi ] ) .",
    "detailed analytical calculations performed in section  10.21 of ll04 on the simpler @xmath105 multiplet show that interferences between different @xmath0-levels of the lower term are the smaller the larger the ratio @xmath106 between the fs splitting of the lower term and its natural width ( given by @xmath107).-levels vanish , and the levels become completely uncorrelated ( like in a multi - level atom ) .",
    "vice versa , when this ratio goes to zero , the lower @xmath0-levels are degenerate , and for the principle of spectroscopic stability the lower term has to behave like a @xmath0-level with @xmath108 . ] indeed , such a negligible effect of these interferences on the @xmath109 profile is due to the low value of @xmath53 that we are considering ( @xmath110 ) . as shown in panel @xmath75 of figure  [ fig : mgi ] ,",
    "if larger values of @xmath53 ( of the order of 0.1 or larger ) are considered , clear differences can be observed between the @xmath109 profiles obtained taking into account and neglecting interferences between lower @xmath0-levels values are typical of masers . ] .",
    "such differences are larger in the wings of the lines , while they disappear in the cores , where the effects of these interferences remain negligible also when large values of @xmath53 are considered . as discussed in ll04 for the @xmath105 multiplet , when lower - term polarization is taken into account , not only the interferences between different lower @xmath0-levels result to be sensitive to the value of @xmath106 , but also the interferences between magnetic sublevels pertaining to the same @xmath0-level , as well as the populations of the various magnetic sublevels .",
    "this explains the variation with @xmath53 of the @xmath109 profiles calculated neglecting the interferences between lower @xmath0-levels .",
    "it can be noticed that the sensitivity of these latter profiles to the value of @xmath53 is limited to the cores of the lines ( the asymptotic values do not change significantly with @xmath53 ) , while a variation with @xmath53 of the overall pattern ( from the core to the far wings ) takes place when interferences between different @xmath0-levels of the lower term are taken into account .",

    "we investigate now how the fractional polarization patterns described in the previous sections are modified by the presence of a magnetic field . before carrying out this analysis",
    ", we recall that in the multi - level atom approximation , any kind of correlation between different @xmath0-levels is neglected by definition .",
    "this implies that when this approach is applied in the presence of a magnetic field , it must be always assumed that the field is sufficiently weak for the zeeman effect regime to hold ( the splitting of the magnetic sublevels must be much smaller than the separation among the various @xmath0-levels ) .",
    "this limitation is not required as far as the multi - term atom approximation is considered . in this latter case ,",
    "magnetic fields going from the zeeman effect regime to the complete paschen - back effect regime can be considered . as we will see ( and as it is discussed in detail in ll04 ) , in the incomplete paschen - back effect regime , interferences between different @xmath0-levels are at the origin of interesting phenomena ( e.g. , `` level - crossing '' and `` anti - level - crossing '' effects ) , which may leave their signatures in the observed polarization profiles .",
    "we start considering the @xmath113 doublet of mg  ii at 2800   .",
    "the energy separation between the two @xmath0-levels of the upper term is sufficiently large for the zeeman effect regime to hold , at least for the magnetic field intensities of the solar atmospheric plasma .        in the zeeman effect regime ,",
    "the magnetic sublevels pertaining to the same @xmath0-level split monotonically with the magnetic field strength .",
    "because of the relaxation term proportional to @xmath35 appearing in the sees ( recall equations  ( [ eq : see ] ) in section  [ sect : theory ] , and the discussion therein ) , this splitting causes a decrease of the interferences between different magnetic sublevels pertaining to the same @xmath0-level ) . ] , which in turn produces a decrease of the linear polarization degree of the emitted radiation with respect to the non magnetic case .",
    "this is the hanle effect for quantum interferences within the same @xmath0-level . in the mg  ii doublet under investigation",
    ", this effect can be clearly observed in the core of the k line ( see panel @xmath69 of figure  [ fig : mg_mag ] ) .    in this regime , on the other hand",

    "the hanle effect has therefore the same impact on the linear polarization patterns calculated taking into account and neglecting interferences , as shown in panel  @xmath7 of figure  [ fig : mg_mag ] .",
    "as it can be clearly observed in the same figure , the hanle effect takes place only in the core of the lines , right in the wavelength interval where the contribution of interferences between different @xmath0-levels is negligible .",
    "since the hanle effect takes place only in the core of the lines , if the same continuum as in the unmagnetized case is considered , a two - peak @xmath9 profile is obtained , the central dip being produced by the hanle depolarization ( see panel  @xmath74 of figure  [ fig : mg_mag ] ) .",
    "this structure is gradually lost as the continuum intensity is increased . on the other hand ,",
    "if a continuum sufficiently strong to cancel out this two - peak structure is considered , also the signatures of interferences between different @xmath0-levels ( such as the antisymmetric pattern across the h line ) result to be strongly reduced ( see panel @xmath75 of figure  [ fig : mg_mag ] ) . as in section  [ sect : continuum ] , we emphasize that the physical origin of this two - peak structure lies in the way the continuum is included in the slab model .        in the presence of a magnetic field with a longitudinal component , an appreciable @xmath114 profile is obtained in the k line .",
    "this signal , due to the hanle effect , appears in the core of the k line , over the same wavelength interval where the hanle depolarization of the @xmath111 profile takes place .",
    "this is also the wavelength interval ( of about five doppler widths ) where interferences between different @xmath0-levels do not produce any appreciable effect on the @xmath111 pattern .",
    "indeed , the profiles obtained taking into account and neglecting such interferences can not be distinguished ( see panel @xmath69 of figure  [ fig : mg_mag_uv ] ) .",
    "we note that a very weak antisymmetrical @xmath114 profile ( of the order of @xmath115 , not visible in the figure ) is obtained in the core of the h line when interferences are taken into account .",
    "this signal , too weak to be observable in practice , and of purely academic importance , is probably due to the small variation of the interferences between different @xmath0-levels produced by the magnetic field in the zeeman effect regime . as previously pointed out , this kind of effect ( i.e. , hanle effect for interferences between different @xmath0-levels ) is generally negligible for magnetic fields in this regime , since the variation of the energy separation between the interfering magnetic sublevels ( pertaining to different @xmath0-levels ) is very small .",
    "these effects become more important as the paschen - back effect regime is reached . in the presence of the same field , also a @xmath116 profile due to the zeeman effect is obtained ( see panel @xmath7 of figure  [ fig : mg_mag_uv ] ) .",
    "there are no differences between the @xmath116 profiles calculated taking into account and neglecting interferences .",
    "the mg  ii h and k lines are an example of a doublet in which the separation between the two lines is much larger than their doppler width .",
    "the results obtained in this section can be extended to any other @xmath2 multiplet in which the two components are sufficiently separated from each other .",
    "the results can also be extended to different multiplets , provided that the various lines are well separated , that lower - term polarization is absent or negligible ( in this multiplet it is zero by definition ) , and that the same hypotheses here considered can be made .      in this section ,",
    "we investigate the effects of a magnetic field on the antisymmetric interference pattern characterizing the emergent @xmath9 profile across the @xmath117 transition of the @xmath2 multiplets .",
    "no hanle depolarization takes place in this line , since its line - core polarization is identically zero already in the absence of magnetic fields ( see , for example , the previous analysis of the mg  ii doublet at 2800   ) .        nevertheless , it is interesting to observe how the interference pattern is modified by the presence of a magnetic field strong enough for the transverse zeeman effect to be appreciable . as shown in figure  [ fig : d1-mag ] ,",
    "when the typical signatures of the transverse zeeman effect superimpose on the interference pattern , a peculiar profile , qualitatively similar to the one observed by @xcite in the na  i d@xmath5 line , is obtained ( see also the theoretical investigations by trujillo bueno et al .",

    "the exact shape of the resulting profile depends on the relative amplitude and width of the antisymmetric interference pattern , and of the transverse zeeman effect pattern ( compare the three panels of figure  [ fig : d1-mag ] ) .",
    "the shape of the interference pattern is controlled by the continuum intensity ( recall the discussion in section  [ sect : continuum ] ) , while the shape of the zeeman pattern by the magnetic field strength .",
    "as expected , the intensity of the magnetic field required for the zeeman pattern to be appreciable on the overall profile is the higher the shorter the wavelength ( compare the three panels of figure  [ fig : d1-mag ] ) .      in order to investigate the effects of a magnetic field on a multiplet in which the separation among the various components is much smaller than their doppler width , we consider now the ly@xmath81 line .",
    "as discussed in section  [ sect : applications ] , interferences between different @xmath0-levels do not produce any observable signature in the core of this line .",
    "also in this case , the impact of the hanle effect due to a magnetic field with strength in the zeeman effect regime is the same on the polarization profiles obtained taking into account and neglecting interferences ( see figure  [ fig : ly - alpha_mag ] ) .    in the ly@xmath81 line , on the other hand , the separation between the two upper @xmath0-levels is sufficiently small for the incomplete paschen - back effect regime to be reached for magnetic fields of the order of 1  kg . in this regime ,",
    "the variation of the energy separation between pairs of magnetic sublevels pertaining to different @xmath0-levels is no longer negligible . in particular , when the separation between two magnetic sublevels is of the same order of magnitude as their natural width ( i.e. , when the two sublevels overlap ) , the first term in the right - hand side of equations  ( [ eq : see ] ) produces a significant modification of the corresponding coherence ( generally an increase in absolute value ) , which may produce observable effects in the polarization of the emergent radiation .",
    "it can be demonstrated that while pairs of magnetic sublevels with @xmath118 can approach and cross each other ( note that when this happens the relaxation term is exactly zero ) , pairs of magnetic sublevels with @xmath119 can approach but never cross .",
    "the terminology of ` level - crossing ' and ` anti - level - crossing ' ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) effects is often used to indicate the hanle effect produced by these particular behaviors of the magnetic sublevels in the incomplete paschen - back effect regime .",
    "a detailed description of these phenomena can be found in ll04 .        here",
    "we want to focus the attention on the following aspect : the possibility , when interferences between different @xmath0-levels are considered , to have hanle effect also in the presence of a `` vertical '' magnetic field .",
    "as discussed in section  [ sect : model ] , in a medium with cylindrical symmetry around a given direction ( e.g. , the vertical ) , if the quantization axis is taken along this direction , it can be shown that no quantum interferences can be induced between pairs of magnetic sublevels pertaining to the same @xmath0-level .",
    "such interferences , which are the only ones to be accounted for in a multi - level atom , also remain zero in the presence of a magnetic field directed along the symmetry axis of the incident radiation , since this does not break the symmetry of the problem .",
    "since the magnetic field does not modify the populations ( note that under the same hypotheses population imbalances can be induced among the various magnetic sublevels ) , it follows that , as known , for the multi - level atom model there is no hanle effect in the presence of a vertical magnetic field .",
    "this is no more true when interferences between different @xmath0-levels are considered .",
    "as previously shown , in a medium with cylindrical symmetry , interferences between magnetic sublevels with the same value of @xmath36 , pertaining to different @xmath0-levels , are actually non - zero .",
    "these interferences are modified by a vertical magnetic field , in the incomplete paschen - back effect regime , with appreciable effects on the polarization of the scattered radiation .",
    "this particular example of hanle effect for interferences between different @xmath0-levels can be clearly observed in figure  [ fig : ly - alpha_mag ] : in the presence of a vertical magnetic field of about 2  kg ( thus in the incomplete paschen - back effect regime ) , the amplitude of the scattering polarization signal is increased with respect to the zero - field case .",
    "this enhancement of the polarization due to a vertical magnetic field was already pointed out by @xcite for the na  i d@xmath6 line , and by @xcite for the ba  ii d@xmath6 line .",
    "however , it should be observed that in these latter cases the effect is due to interferences between different hfs @xmath120-levels , and not between different @xmath0-levels as in the ly@xmath81 line ( the physical mechanism is exactly the same ) .",
    "it is clear that this effect is of more practical interest when hfs is present , since magnetic fields relatively weak are sufficient for the incomplete paschen - back effect regime of hfs to be reached .",
    "we analyze here the effect of a magnetic field on the mg  i triplet at 5178   .",
    "as discussed in section  [ sect : mgi ] , the polarization of the radiation emitted in these lines is very sensitive to the atomic polarization of the lower levels .",
    "the so - called lower - level hanle effect can thus be clearly observed in this triplet .",
    "if the lower level is metastable ( as in this case ) , the lower - level hanle effect is sensitive to rather weak magnetic fields . in these lines , assuming @xmath121 , it can already be appreciated for magnetic field intensities of the order of a few mg ( see figure  [ fig : wing - he ] ) , while for a magnetic field of 1  g it is already saturated .        also in the presence of magnetic fields",
    ", interferences between different lower @xmath0-levels do not produce any observable signature on the @xmath9 profile of the emergent radiation , and they can be safely neglected .",
    "an interesting property of the lower - level hanle effect is that it does not vanish in the wings of the lines , but it depolarizes the whole pattern ( see panel @xmath69 of figure  [ fig : wing - he ] ) . as a consequence , if the same continuum as in the unmagnetized case is considered , no double - peak structures are obtained as a result of the hanle depolarization ( see panel @xmath7 of figure  [ fig : wing - he ] ) .",
    "we recall that the property of the ( upper - level ) hanle effect to vanish in the wings of the lines is strictly verified under the assumptions of unpolarized lower level , no stimulation effects , and no elastic collision ( see section  10.4 of ll04 for an analytical proof ) .",
    "it is clear that this property remains valid whenever stimulation effects are very weak ( like in the solar atmosphere ) , and whenever the influence of lower - level polarization and collisions on the polarization properties of the line is negligible .",
    "an analysis of the influence of elastic collisions on the hanle effect can be found in section  10.6 of ll04 .",
    "a detailed analysis of the physical conditions under which `` wing - hanle - effect '' can be observed will be presented in a forthcoming paper .",
    "we have investigated the effects of quantum interferences between different @xmath0-levels on the linear polarization pattern of the radiation scattered at 90@xmath1 by a slab of stellar atmospheric plasma .",
    "the investigation has been carried out within the framework of the quantum theory of polarization presented in ll04 , which is based on the flat - spectrum approximation .",
    "we started focusing our attention on the @xmath2 doublet .",
    "we analyzed the effects of the interferences between the two upper @xmath0-levels as a function of the wavelength separation ( @xmath122 ) between the two fs components , and assuming a finite doppler width ( @xmath68 ) for the two spectral lines , in the absence of the continuum .",
    "the most important results of this part of our study , carried out for the unmagnetized case , and neglecting the effects of collisions and stimulated emission , are the following .    1",
    ".   the effects of interferences between different @xmath0-levels are negligible in the core of the two lines , while they become important moving from the center to the wings ( see panel @xmath69 of figure  [ fig : pq - gen ] ) .",
    "if the separation @xmath122 between the two lines is much larger than their doppler width , the shape of the overall interference pattern ( shown in panel @xmath69 of figure  [ fig : pq - gen ] ) does not depend on the particular value of @xmath122 .",
    "2 .   in the core of the two lines ,",
    "the fractional polarization profiles obtained taking into account and neglecting such interferences show flat `` plateaux '' of about @xmath123 , across which they perfectly coincide ( see panels @xmath7 and @xmath74 of figure  [ fig : pq - gen ] ) .",
    "when @xmath124 ( so that the two plateaux merge ) , all the signatures due to interferences disappear between the two - lines ( note that this merging starts when the intensity profiles are still well separated from each other ; see panel @xmath74 of figure  [ fig : dl - dep ] ) .",
    "when @xmath125 ( so that the two plateaux completely merge ) , the fine structure depolarization takes place on a wavelength interval of about @xmath123 ( the width of a single plateau ) , irrespectively of the actual separation between the two components ( see panels @xmath75 , @xmath76 , and @xmath77 of figure  [ fig : dl - dep ] ) .",
    "signatures of interferences become appreciable in the line - core when the separation between the interfering @xmath0-levels is of the same order of magnitude as their natural width ( see panels @xmath76 and @xmath77 of figure  [ fig : dl - dep ] ; note that this circumstance is not met by any real multiplet ) .",
    "although we believe that the flat plateaux that appear in the core of the lines may not be obtained once radiative transfer effects in realistic solar model atmospheres are taken into account , the fact that across the corresponding wavelength intervals the effects of interferences are negligible is a physical result that is expected to remain valid also when full radiative transfer is properly considered . a detailed analysis of the physical and mathematical origin of these intervals , and of their width ( of the order of @xmath123 ) ,",
    "has thus been carried out ( see the appendix ) .",
    "we then analyzed how the signatures of interferences are masked when the contribution of an unpolarized continuum is taken into account , finding the following main results .    1 .",
    "the amount of the continuum emissivity needed to mask the signatures of interferences is the larger the smaller the wavelength separation between the interfering lines ( see figures  [ fig : cont - dep ] and [ fig : bana ] ) .",
    "2 .   in the case of the @xmath2 multiplet ,",
    "the effect of the continuum is to reduce the amplitude of the negative minimum between the two lines , to move it toward the @xmath126 transition , and to produce an antisymmetrical pattern across this transition ( see figure  [ fig : cont - dep ] ) .",
    "for a given value of the continuum emissivity , the amplitude of the above - mentioned antisymmetrical pattern is the smaller the larger the separation between the two components of the multiplet ( see figure  [ fig : bana ] ) .",
    "the above - mentioned results are not all limited to the @xmath2 doublet , but they can be generalized to any other multiplet .",
    "we carried out an analysis of the signatures produced by interferences between different @xmath0-levels on the following multiplets :    * ba  ii @xmath2 doublet ( 4554   and 4934   resonance lines ) ; * ca  ii @xmath2 doublet ( h and k lines ) ; * mg  ii @xmath2 doublet ( h and k lines ) ; * na  i @xmath2 doublet ( d@xmath5 and d@xmath6 lines ) ; * h  i @xmath2 doublet ( ly@xmath8 ) ; * cr",

    "we found that for the typical solar values of @xmath53 ( the mean number of photons per mode of the pumping radiation field ) , their effect on the scattering polarization profiles is completely negligible ( see panels @xmath69 and @xmath74 of figure  [ fig : mgi ] , and panel @xmath69 of figure  [ fig : mgi - b ] ) .",
    "values of @xmath53 of the order of 0.1 or larger are needed in order to observe their signatures on the ratio @xmath128 , their effect being in any case negligible in the core of the lines ( see panel @xmath75 of figure  [ fig : mgi ] ) .",
    "the atomic polarization of the upper levels is practically unaffected by the presence of these interferences in the sees , also for high values of @xmath53 ( see panel @xmath7 of figure  [ fig : mgi ] ) .",
    "the signatures of interferences between different lower @xmath0-levels ( appreciable only when high values of @xmath53 are considered ) are in any case strongly masked by the presence of the continuum .",
    "our calculations also showed an appreciable sensitivity of the @xmath9 profile of the emergent radiation to the value of @xmath53 ( see panel @xmath7 of figure  [ fig : mgi - b ] ) .",
    "we finally investigated whether or not , and to which extent , the signatures due to interferences between different @xmath0-levels are modified by the presence of a magnetic field .",
    "the results can be summarized as follows .    1 .   in the zeeman effect regime ,",
    "the influence of the magnetic field on the values of the interferences between different @xmath0-levels is extremely small .",
    "the hanle effect thus leaves the same signatures on the fractional polarization patterns calculated taking into account and neglecting interferences between different @xmath0-levels .",
    "as shown by the profiles calculated for the mg  ii h and k lines , as far as the @xmath111 pattern is concerned , the hanle effect takes place in the core of the k line , right in the wavelength interval where the effect of interferences is negligible ( see figure  [ fig : mg_mag ] ) .",
    "also the @xmath114 signal , produced by the hanle effect in the same line in the presence of a longitudinal field , appears across this wavelength interval ( see panel @xmath69 of figure  [ fig : mg_mag_uv ] ) .",
    "2 .   in the incomplete paschen - back effect regime ,",
    "interferences between different @xmath0-levels are significantly modified by the magnetic field , thus producing observable effects on the emergent radiation .",
    "the physical mechanisms at the origin of these effects ( e.g. , level - crossings , anti - level - crossings , alignment - to - orientation conversion mechanism ) are described in detail in ll04 . in this paper",
    ", we focused our attention on the possibility to have hanle effect also in the presence of `` vertical '' fields when interferences between different @xmath0-levels are taken into account ( see figure  [ fig : ly - alpha_mag ] ) .",
    "we should remember that the paschen - back effect regime is more typical for hfs multiplets .",
    "even for the ly@xmath8 line considered here , for which the separation between the two interfering @xmath0-levels is particularly small if compared to that of other fs multiplets , fields of about 2  kg are needed for producing this kind of effects .    in summary ,",
    "when the energy separation between pairs of magnetic sublevels pertaining to different @xmath0-levels is much larger than their width ( which is always the case in the absence of magnetic fields or in the presence of weak magnetic fields in the zeeman effect regime ) , the contribution of the interferences between such magnetic sublevels modifies the fractional linear polarization pattern in the wings of the lines ( outside a @xmath129 wavelength interval around the line center ) .",
    "however , at these wavelengths the line contribution to the total emissivity and absorptivity is no longer dominating with respect to that of the continuum .",
    "the presence of the continuum strongly masks the effects of interferences between different @xmath0-levels , which indeed are observable only in rather strong spectral lines ( e.g. , ca  ii h and k , na  i d@xmath5 and d@xmath6 ) . because of the crucial role of the continuum , it is not possible to establish a simple quantitative criterion for deciding whether or not interferences between different @xmath0-levels",
    "are expected to produce observable effects .",
    "on the other hand , in the presence of a magnetic field sufficiently intense for the paschen - back effect regime to be reached ( or , in other words , when the energy separation between pairs of magnetic sublevels pertaining to different @xmath0-levels is no longer negligible with respect to their width ) , interferences between different @xmath0-levels may modify the amplitude of the fractional polarization pattern in the core of the lines through the mechanisms described in detail in sections 10.18 and 10.20 of ll04 .",
    "we conclude pointing out that all the results presented in this paper on the effects of interferences between different @xmath0-levels can be generalized to the case of interferences between different hfs @xmath120-levels .",
    "the only remarkable difference for practical applications is the fact that the paschen - back effect regime for hfs is generally reached for magnetic fields much weaker than those needed for reaching the paschen - back effect regime for fs .    financial support by the spanish ministry of science and innovation through project aya2010 - 18029 ( solar magnetism and astrophysical spectropolarimetry )",

    "in this appendix , we first recall some equations and analytical results derived in ll04 that have been mentioned in the text . these equations will be the starting point for the following derivation of a series of analytical expressions that will allow us to get more insights on some results presented in this paper on the @xmath2 multiplets .",
