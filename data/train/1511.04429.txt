    "astrophysical observations provide strong evidence for the existence of dark matter ( dm ) @xcite , and its abundance in the current phase of the universe @xcite . according to the newest results from planck collaboration ,",
    "there is a 74% approximately of matter which is not directly visible but is observed due to its gravitational effects on visible matter .",
    "additional evidence for the existence of dm comes from study the rotation curves of spiral galaxies @xcite , the analysis of the bullet cluster @xcite , and the study of baryon acoustic oscillations @xcite .",
    "one of the most common hypothesis used to explain these phenomena is to postulate the existence of weakly interacting massive particles ( wimps ) @xcite .    in order to explain dm",
    ", we study a simple extension of the standard model ( sm ) , called the inert higgs doublet model ( ihdm ) .",
    "this model , which was originally proposed for studies on electroweak ( ew ) symmetry breaking @xcite , introduces an additional doublet and a discrete symmetry .",
    "these two characteristics of the model modify the sm phenomenology , but there are some regions of the parameter space which predict only small deviations from the sm .",
    "nevertheless , one of the most attractive characteristic of the ihdm is the presence of an stable neutral particle which can be a dm candidate .    in this work the ihdm",
    "is revisited , considering various restrictions , focusing our analysis on the zones of the parameter space which reproduce the correct dm relic density according to the newest measurements @xcite . in this context , three not connected mass regimes for the lightest inert particle are found .",
    "these regimes are also analyzed using lhc observables like branching ratios to invisible particles and an specific sm  like higgs boson decay mode .",
    "additionally , we study some inert decays modes .",
    "finally , we use a direct detection approach to rule out one of the mass regimes .",
    "it is further shown that this regime can also be ruled out by constraints from collider physics @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . after a short introduction in section [ secintro ] the model",
    "is introduced in section  [ sechdm ] by formulating the associated potential and constraints of the model , and by exploring the parameter space and its characteristics in section [ secparameters ] . in section [ seccollider ]",
    "the behavior of the model is presented from a collider physics perspective , studying the modifications of the sm and its implications for the ihdm . in section [ secdm ]",
    "the results of this study are complemented by an analysis from the dark matter perspective .",
    "finally , in section [ secconc ] we remark on the most important conclusions of our work .",
    "consider an extension of standard model ( sm ) , which contains two higgs doublets @xmath2 and a discrete @xmath3 symmetry @xcite ( @xmath4 and @xmath5 ) .",

    "the sm - like higgs boson mass is fixed now thanks to the measurement @xmath35 gev @xcite .",

    "we assume it is the @xmath0 boson , thus @xmath45 and @xmath46 , which due to ( [ masses ] ) translates to @xmath47 we do not consider @xmath23 as the dm candidate because it is analogous to consider @xmath0 as the dm candidate defining @xmath48 instead of @xmath34 .",
