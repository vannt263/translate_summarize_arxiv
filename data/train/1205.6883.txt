    "the present paper reports calculations of the polarizabilities of the hydrogen atom and isoelectronic ions using the dirac equation to describe the underlying dynamics . such calculations are now topical since some atomic polarizabilities can directly impact the definitions of two fundamental quantities , the kelvin and the second  @xcite .",
    "the new generation of optical frequency standards have reached such precision that they are sensitive to the black - body radiation of the apparatus itself @xcite .",
    "the resulting black - body radiation shift is largely determined by the differences in polarizabilities of the two atomic states involved in the clock transition . additionally ,",
    "very high precision measurements of the helium dielectric constant have been recently reported @xcite . in conjunction with high precision calculations of the static dipole polarizability @xcite",
    ", these measurements can result in improved determinations of boltzmann s constant and thus the kelvin @xcite .",
    "another reason for doing such calculations is that they can be used to verify the accuracy of computational methods and tests of fundamental theory .",
    "the polarizabilities of the hydrogenic ions are properties of the ground state of a set of systems that are often used to test the fundamental principles of physics .",
    "it is rather surprising that the first explicit calculations of the quadrupole polarizabilities of the hydrogenic ions based on the dirac equation have only just been reported @xcite .",
    "an important advance in the topic of the dipole and higher multipole polarizabilities was an investigation based on the pauli approximation that gave expressions for the static multipole polarizabilities up to @xmath10  @xcite .",
    "this was a generalization of an earlier work which gave the @xmath10 expression for the dipole polarizability @xcite .",
    "the work on dipole polarizabilities was extended to @xmath11 @xcite , @xmath12 @xcite and to all orders in terms of a generalized hypergeometric function @xcite .",
    "apart from a very recent calculation  @xcite , the expressions for the quadrupole and higher - order polarizabilities have not had independent confirmation .",
    "there have been a number of independent calculations of the dipole polarizability and related sum rules .",
    "many of these investigations have been computational in nature .",
    "drake and goldman derived expressions for some dipole oscillator strength sum rules as well as performing some explicit calculations of the dipole polarizability @xcite by expanding the wave function as a linear combination of exponential type functions .",
    "goldman  @xcite extended the basis set approach to calculate the dipole polarizability of hydrogenic ions from @xmath13 to @xmath14 using a gauge - invariance method .",

    "there have been a number of other computational investigations of the dipole polarizabilities of hydrogenic ions based on dirac equation @xcite .",
    "the present calculations used the b - spline galerkin method with notre dame ( nd ) boundary conditions @xcite .",
    "other approaches to the b - spline boundary conditions have been proposed @xcite .",
    "there is at present no overwhelming reason for adopting more complicated boundary conditions in preference to the nd boundary conditions .",
    "the b - spline approach to atomic structure has a number of advantages @xcite , it does not lead to linear dependence , the basis can be made effectively complete in a finite region of space , the details of the basis are easily adjustable and results are numerically stable .",
    "however , like all basis set approaches , the energy spectrum also has a sea of negative - energy states ( the dirac sea ) and it is also possible for spurious states to appear in the positive energy spectrum  @xcite .",
    "these issues have been discussed extensively  @xcite    the present b - spline calculations of the multipole polarizabilities give numerical values that are more precise than any previous calculation .",
    "values of associated oscillator strength sum - rules are also given .",
    "the nuclear mass was set to be infinite and the point nucleus model was adopted .",
    "values are reported for intermediate sums including the entire set of states and also for a set of calculations that omitted the negative energy states from the dirac sea .",
    "analytic expressions for the polarizabilities are constructed that are accurate to a relative precision of @xmath17 for @xmath18 .",
    "the static multipole polarizabilities for quadrupole , octupole and hexadecupole transitions have been computed and found to be compatible with the @xmath10 expressions of kaneko _ et al _ @xcite .",
    "the sum rules @xmath6 , provide a valuable consistency check on the reliability of our calculations .",
