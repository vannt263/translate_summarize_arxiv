    "mechanical motion and optical fields are coupled by a number of different mechanisms in cavity optomechanical systems  @xcite . within micro- and nanoscale geometries ,",
    "perhaps the most commonly considered one is the change in effective optical path length resulting from moving dielectric boundaries , analogous to a movable mirror in a fabry - perot cavity .",
    "however , the optical path length also depends on the refractive index of the medium filling the cavity , and in solids this can change due to mechanical motion because of the photoelastic effect ( electrostriction )  @xcite .",
    "this has been observed in stimulated brillouin scattering in suspended silicon waveguides  @xcite and cooling and excitation of traveling wave acoustic modes in silica whispering gallery mode resonators  @xcite .",
    "more recently , it has been considered in silicon optomechanical crystals , where optimized geometries that exclusively rely on the photoelastic effect have been developed  @xcite .    in this work ,",
    "we investigate the moving dielectric boundary and photoelastic contributions to the optomechanical coupling in gaas devices .",
    "gaas has many desirable properties for cavity optomechanics : relatively large photoelastic coefficients  @xcite which can produce devices with high optomechanical coupling  @xcite ; piezoelectric properties  @xcite which can be exploited for driving or readout of mechanical motion ; and potential integration with inas / gaas quantum dots that offer non - classical light emission and a strong resonant nonlinearity  @xcite that can be used to probe and control mechanical motion  @xcite .",
    "we first present a combined theoretical and experimental analysis of gaas microdisks of varying radius , where in large radius devices the moving boundary effect dominates , while in small radius devices the photoelastic effect is the leading contribution .",
    "while these trends have recently been theoretically predicted  @xcite , here we experimentally demonstrate the importance of considering both these effects in the overall optomechanical coupling rate @xmath0 .",
    "we then present two designs of gaas nanobeam optomechanical crystals that rely predominantly on the photoelastic effect .",
    "we show a significant ( 30  @xmath5 ) dependence of @xmath0 on the in - plane device angle , in contrast with similar si devices  @xcite , for which the dependence is much weaker ( 3  @xmath5 ) .",
    "this dependence originates from the much larger magnitude ( and opposite sign ) of the photoelastic coefficient @xmath7 in gaas .",
    "we experimentally demonstrate this effect by measuring @xmath0 in devices fabricated with differing in - plane angles , and measure @xmath8 as high as 1.1  mhz for devices oriented along the [ 110 ] axis of gaas .",
    "mechanical modes at 2.5  ghz with a quality factor @xmath9  2000 at room temperature and atmosphere are observed , as is self - oscillation of the mechanical modes through radiation - pressure driven dynamical back - action  @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : figure1](a ) shows a scanning electron microscope image of a microdisk cavity fabricated in a 220  nm thick gaas layer using typical lithography and dry etching processes ( see supplementary material ) .",
    "finite - element - method simulations are used to calculate the whispering gallery optical modes and radial breathing mechanical modes of such devices ( fig .",
    "[ fig : figure1](a ) ) , with disk radius @xmath10 varying between 1  @xmath2 m and 5  @xmath2 m . for each value of @xmath10 ,",
    "we calculate optical modes of transverse electric ( te ) polarization ( dominant electric field components are in the plane of the disk ) , and determine the azimuthal mode number @xmath11 that places a first order radial mode in the 1550  nm band .",
    "we focus on the te@xmath12 mode because of its comparatively high radiation - limited optical quality factor ( @xmath13 ) for small disks ( @xmath14  @xmath2 m ) .",
    "similarly , we focus on the fundamental radial breathing mechanical mode as it is expected to have a higher mechanical quality factor ( @xmath15 ) than higher - order modes for a given supporting pedestal size .    the optomechanical coupling rate @xmath0 , defined as the optical mode frequency shift due to the mechanical mode s zero - point motion  @xcite , has moving boundary ( @xmath16 ) and photoelastic ( @xmath17 ) contributions obtained from the calculated modes as in ref .",

    "qualitatively , the photoelastic contribution is sensitive to mechanical motion throughout the device , whereas the moving boundary contribution is sensitive to the motion of surfaces ( particularly the disk sidewall for the radial breathing mode ) .",

    "is an order of magnitude lower , likely as a result of @xmath31  nm length scale roughness present on the underside of the gaas layer ( see supplementary material ) .",
    "such lower @xmath13 values do not influence the estimate of @xmath0 , but do prevent operation in the sideband - resolved regime needed for a number of applications .",
    "the optomechanical coupling rate @xmath0 can be estimated from a mechanical mode spectrum as ( see supplementary material ) :    @xmath32    where @xmath33 is the power in the mechanical mode , @xmath34 is the power in the phase modulator signal , and @xmath29 is the modulation index .",

    "the data shows good agreement with the red curve , which plots the sum of the moving boundary and the photoelastic contributions to @xmath0 . especially for small disk radii , the data shows significant deviation from the moving boundary contribution alone , which might help explain some discrepancies observed in previous measurements of gaas disk optomechanical resonators , where only moving boundary effects were considered in simulation comparisons  @xcite .",
    "we note that for nominally identical disks , a spread in @xmath0 of @xmath43 is observed .",
    "we attribute this to the specifics of the fiber taper coupling for each device , which , we have observed , can perturb the optical and mechanical modes and the resultant optomechanical coupling ( see supplementary material ) .",
    "the measurements of @xmath0 in gaas microdisks demonstrated that the contribution due to the photoelastic effect ( @xmath44 ) can become comparable to , and even exceed that due to the moving boundary ( @xmath45 ) effect , as the disk radius @xmath10 becomes comparable to the wavelength . intuitively , as @xmath10 is reduced , the volume of both the optical and mechanical modes decrease and @xmath0 increases due to increased spatial overlap . given that bending loss starts to dominate @xmath13 for @xmath46  @xmath2 m",
    ", one can estimate that @xmath47  khz based on the data shown in fig .",

    ", one needs to consider geometries that support more tightly confined optical and mechanical modes .",
    "optomechanical crystals  @xcite , structures that spatially co - localize optical modes within a photonic bandgap and mechanical modes within a phononic bandgap , have been demonstrated in a number of materials  @xcite and in both one- and two - dimensional geometries . here",
    ", we focus on one - dimensional ( nanobeam ) geometries , where the nanobeams are patterned with a series of holes whose dimensions are graded quadratically from the center ( cavity section ) to the edge ( mirror section ) .",
    "the general design principle for the optical cavity  @xcite relies on choosing the center hole dimension to support a guided mode and then quadratically tapering the hole dimension down to the mirror section where the mode lies in the forbidden band and hence is reflected .",
    "the cavity is constructed by putting two such tapers back - to - back .",
    "the quadratic taper ensures that the electric field amplitude of the mode has a gaussian profile and retains high @xmath13 .",
    "similar design concepts have been used in the development of gaas nanobeam photonic crystal cavities for applications in lasing  @xcite and cavity quantum electrodynamics  @xcite .",
    "here , we demonstrate these gaas cavities in the context of cavity optomechanics , where we note that the tailoring of the hole dimensions also enables localization of mechanical modes  @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : figure3 ] shows two different nanobeam optomechanical crystal cavity designs in 220  nm thick gaas , using circular holes ( fig .",
    "[ fig : figure3](a)-(d ) ) as described above and elliptical holes ( fig .",
    "[ fig : figure3](e)-(h ) ) in an approach similar to ref .  @xcite . for each design , we show a schematic of the geometry , the variation in device parameters as a function of hole number , and the optical and mechanical modes .",
    "we designed the devices to have a nominal operating wavelength of 1550 nm and ran a parameter sweep to find designs with the highest @xmath48 , where both moving boundary and photoelastic contributions to @xmath0 are calculated as described earlier for microdisks .",
    "the circular hole design is one realization of the more general elliptical hole design , and is thus comparatively simple in terms of the number of design parameters . in particular",
    ", we fix the lattice constant @xmath49 and adjust only the hole radius @xmath50 at the different lattice sites .",
    "more specifically , we vary the hole radius in the center of the cavity and the mirror sections , as well as the steepness of the quadratic grading profile ( i.e. , the number of holes over which the radius is tapered ) . in comparison ,",
    "the elliptical hole designs have quadratic grades for the lattice constant ( @xmath49 ) and lengths of the principal axes of the ellipse ( @xmath51 and @xmath52 ) .",
    "thus , for each dimension @xmath49 , @xmath51 , and @xmath52 , we vary the value in center of the cavity and mirror sections , as well as the steepness of the quadratic grade .    while for both the circular and elliptical hole designs , we find parameters for which @xmath53 , @xmath0 is higher for the elliptical hole designs . in particular",
    ", the optimized elliptical hole design has @xmath54  khz and @xmath55  khz for coupling between the @xmath56  nm optical mode and @xmath57  2.14  ghz mechanical mode , compared to the optimized circular hole design with @xmath58  khz and @xmath59  khz for coupling between the @xmath60  nm optical mode and @xmath61  ghz mechanical mode .",
    "the elliptical design ensures a higher @xmath0 by having a higher gaas volume fraction in the center of the beam . we note that while in microdisks , the moving boundary and photoelastic contributions to @xmath0 are comparable in magnitude and of the same sign , for the optimized nanobeams , @xmath0 is dominated by the photoelastic effect and the moving boundary contribution is opposite in sign and thus reduces the net optomechanical coupling rate",
    "this behavior is consistent with refs .",
    "@xcite and  @xcite , where an optimized nanobeam geometry dominated by the photoelastic effect was developed for si and diamond , respectively .",
    "given that the photoelastic effect is represented by a tensor , one would expect the contribution to @xmath0 to depend on the in - plane orientation of the nanobeam .",
    "moreover , the fact that @xmath7 has a much larger magnitude in gaas than in si ( @xmath62 , @xmath63 ) suggests that the dependence of @xmath0 on in - plane orientation will be much more significant in gaas .",
    "figure  [ fig : figure4](b ) shows @xmath44 for the elliptical hole nanobeam shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : figure3](e)-(h ) as a function of the angle the long axis of the nanobeam makes with the [ 100 ] direction .",
    "the coupling rate is calculated using the rotated photoelastic tensor ( see supplementary material ) .",
    "we can see that the effect is quite significant with a variation of almost 35  % and a peak value @xmath64  1.2  mhz at 45  @xmath65 ( device orientation along [ 110 ] ) .",
    "we also plot the orientation dependence of @xmath44 for a silicon nanobeam optomechanical crystal similar to that of ref .",
    "we see that again , there is a dependence of @xmath44 on in - plane orientation , although in this case the optomechanical coupling rate is minimized at 45  @xmath65 and the variation between 0  @xmath65 and 45  @xmath65 is less than 5  % . to understand this , we plot in fig .",
    "[ fig : figure4](c ) the contributions due to the @xmath66 and @xmath7 terms of eqn .",
    "[ eq : g0_eqns ] as a function of in - plane angle .",
    "the in - plane anisotropy of @xmath44 is seen to arise primarily from the contribution due to the @xmath7 term , and the aforementioned difference in the @xmath7 values for gaas and si helps us understand why this rotational dependence is so weak in si .",
    "we also point out that the in - plane anisotropy of the elastic coefficients of gaas leads to an orientation - dependent young s modulus  @xcite and a resultant shift in the mechanical mode frequency ( see supplementary material ) , but the moving boundary contribution @xmath45 is relatively insensitive to in - plane orientation under the assumption of gaas being an isotropic elastic material ( as can be seen from the form of eqn .  1 ) .",
    "the total optomechanical coupling rate for the gaas elliptical hole design , including both photoelastic and moving boundary contributions , is therefore as high as @xmath67  1.1  mhz .    , mechanical mode frequency , optical wavelength , @xmath45 and @xmath44 ( nanobeam long axis oriented along the [ 100 ] direction ) , zero - point motional amplitude , and effective motional mass .",

    "we note that while the uncertainty values we have quoted for the measured @xmath0 are the one standard deviation value due to the uncertainty in the phase modulator @xmath37 , another source of uncertainty is in the precise angle with which the cavity was fabricated relative to the gaas crystal planes ( i.e. , the alignment of the gaas chip within the electron - beam lithography system ) .",

    "the microdisk patterns were exposed in a 100  kev direct write electron beam lithography system with a beam current of 200 pa and nominal dose of 250  @xmath2c/@xmath90 . after exposure , the electron beam resist was developed using hexyl acetate ( 65 sec ) .",
    "for improved sidewall roughness , the resist was reflowed at @xmath91 for 1 min .",
    "the microdisk patterns were then transferred to the underlying gaas layer using an inductively coupled plasma reactive ion etcher with an ar / cl@xmath92 chemistry .",

    "device fabrication follows the same general procedure as with the microdisks , with two changes : ( 1 ) a slightly higher cl@xmath92 percentage is used in the ar / cl@xmath92 etch to achieve near - vertical sidewalls in the nanobeam holes , and ( 2 ) the devices are undercut with 49  @xmath5 hf .",
    "the low optical quality factors measured for the gaas microdisks in this work ( @xmath30 ) relative to those measured in other work using the same fabrication process  @xcite can be attributed to the presence of significant underside roughness in the gaas layer which causes additional scattering .",
    "the roughness can be seen clearly in fig .",
    "[ fig : figuresi_sem ] , which shows the underside of a collapsed microdisk .",
    "the roughness is apparently unrelated to the lithography and dry etching processes , since the underside of the gaas layer is protected during these stpdf .",
    "this suggests that either the wet undercut step , or the initial growth itself , is where the roughness originates .",
    "given the success of the same wet undercut procedure in fabricating similar gaas devices by many research groups , our current hypothesis is that the roughness arises in the underlying al@xmath87ga@xmath88as layer , possibly due to temperature variations during growth , and acts as a template for the subsequent gaas layer growth .",
    "this hypothesis is consistent with other reports in the literature  @xcite .",
    "we use a phase modulator to calibrate the optomechanical coupling rate @xmath0 .",
    "the basic idea is to relate the modulation produced by sending light through the cavity optomechanical system ( which is driven by its contact with the thermal environment ) to a direct phase modulation applied with an electro - optic phase modulator . because both undergo the same transduction function , as shown by gorodetsky et al .",
    "@xcite , the ratio of the integrated power in their photocurrent rf spectra will be related to the ratio of @xmath0 and the phase modulator s modulation index .",
    "we go through this derivation below .    the root - mean - square ( rms ) thermal displacement amplitude ( @xmath95 ) is related to the temperature ( @xmath96 ) using the equipartition theorem : @xmath97    where @xmath98 is the motional mass of the oscillator and @xmath99 is the mechanical mode frequency .",

    "we then relate @xmath0 to @xmath109 : @xmath110    the modulation index ( @xmath29 ) of the phase modulator is defined as : @xmath111    where @xmath112 is the signal amplitude and @xmath113 is the modulator half wave voltage .    by comparing the ( integrated ) powers in the cavity mechanical mode signal and the phase modulator signal obtained from the electronic spectrum analyzer , we get : @xmath114",

    "given the high refractive index of gaas and the accompanying tight mode confinement , the fiber taper waveguide has to be brought in close proximity to the disk to ensure sufficient coupling depth so that one can observe the mechanical modes .",
    "this problem is exacerbated in our case by the underside roughness which lowers the intrinsic optical @xmath123 of the cavities significantly .",
    "if the fiber taper comes in contact with the disk , it perturbs both the optical mode ( by modifying the field distribution ) and the mechanical mode ( by clamping the motion where the fiber touches the disk ) .",

    "[ fig : figuresi_opt_mode_taper ] ) and mechanical mode spectra ( fig .",
    "[ fig : figuresi_mech_mode_taper ] ) as well as an increase in the corresponding damping rates .",
    "we find that the extracted coupling strength for devices in which the fiber taper has come into contact with the microdisk can be significantly different ( @xmath124 in some cases ) than those in which the fiber is held to the side of the disk . for the measurements shown in fig .  2 in the main text , we have attempted to keep the fiber taper waveguide coupling position consistent for all of the measured microdisks , with the coupling depth ( extinction ratio @xmath125 75  % ) of the optical mode and the mechanical q ( @xmath126 1000 ) of the radial breathing mode mode serving as consistency checks for disks of the same nominal diameter .",
    "finally , we note that while our work has assumed that the inferred optomechanical coupling rate @xmath0 is purely due to dispersive coupling ( consisting of both moving dielectric boundary and photoelastic components ) , recent work has highlighted the potential for other coupling mechanisms , such as dissipative coupling in which the intrinsic and extrinsic quality factors of the optical cavity depend on the motion of the mechanical resonator  @xcite .",
