    "pan et al.@xcite have recently observed the fractional quantum hall ( fqh ) effect@xcite in a spin - polarized two - dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) at the @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and @xmath5 fillings of the lowest landau level ( ll ) . in the composite fermion ( cf )",
    "model,@xcite these values correspond to the fractional fillings @xmath6",
    ", @xmath7 , and @xmath8 of the second cf ll , respectively . in haldane s hierarchy picture@xcite of these states , laughlin quasielectrons ( qe s ) fill ( the same ) fraction @xmath9 of their ll . the most striking conclusion from pan s",
    "discovery is that the cf s ( or qe s ) can also form incompressible states when partially filling a ll .",
    "this could not be predicted by a simple analogy with known fractional electron liquids ( laughlin,@xcite jain,@xcite or moore ",
    "read@xcite states ) , because of a different form of qe ",
    "qe interaction,@xcite therefore yielding qualitatively different qe  qe correlations .",
    "although several numerical studies of interacting qe s have been reported@xcite and ideas such as cf flavor - mixing,@xcite qe pairing,@xcite or stripes@xcite were invoked , the correlations responsible for the fqhe at @xmath3 and @xmath4 are not yet understood .",
    "it has not even been settled if these fqh states are isotropic , and the energies of liquid and solid phases were compared recently @xcite ( although the laughlin form was arbitrarily assumed for the liquid ) .    sometimes overlooked is a general connection@xcite between the form of haldane pseudopotential,@xcite occurrence of laughlin correlations , and the validity of cf transformation .",
    "actually , the form of qe  qe interaction is known from independent calculations,@xcite and laughlin correlations among the qe s have been ruled out using both a general pseudopotential argument@xcite and a direct analysis of many - qe wavefunctions .",
    "@xcite in this paper we refer to the following well - established facts :    \\(i ) the qe ",
    "qe haldane pseudopotential@xcite is known from exact diagonalization of the coulomb interaction among electrons in the lowest ll.@xcite since there are no unchecked assumptions in such a calculation , it must be regarded a `` numerical experiment . ''",
    "neither finite - size errors , lowest - ll restriction , finite 2deg width , nor other details of realistic experimental systems affect the dominant feature of the pseudopotential which is the _ lack of strong qe ",
    "qe repulsion at short range_.    \\(ii ) the qe s _ do not_@xcite have laughlin correlations at @xmath6 corresponding to @xmath3 .",
    "the moore  read half - filled state _ is not_@xcite an adequate description of qe ",
    "qe correlations at @xmath10 corresponding to @xmath11 .",
    "\\(iii ) a sequence of nondegenerate finite - size qe ground states with a gap , extrapolating to @xmath6 has been found@xcite on a sphere .",
    "although spherical geometry is not adequate for studying crystal or other broken - symmetry phases , the identified states appear incompressible and have the lowest energy of all qe liquids ( considerably below the laughlin state ) .    to address the problem of correlations at @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and @xmath5 we calculate pair - distribution functions @xmath0 in the incompressible liquid ground states of up to @xmath12 qe s .",
    "their comparison with the ( known ) curves of the laughlin and moore  read states implies a different nature of the qe correlations in these novel fqh states .",
    "it shows that their incompressibility can not be explained by a simple analogy between the qe and electron liquids , and suggests that different wavefunctions need be proposed for the correlated cf s .",
    "unfortunately , the calculated @xmath0 are of little help in a precise definition of these wavefunctions , even though some qualitative statements can be made about the qe correlations .    from our finite - size results we identify and analyze the size - independent features in @xmath0 : the @xmath13 behavior at short range and a shoulder at a medium range , and argue that they are consistent with the idea@xcite of qe cluster formation .",
    "short- and long - range contributions to @xmath0 are found , describing correlations between the qe s from the same or different clusters .",
    "both intra- and inter - cluster qe ",
    "qe correlations depend rather weakly on @xmath9 .",
    "the average size of the clusters is estimated ; it seems that the qe s form pairs at @xmath6 and triplets at @xmath10 . a similar analysis of @xmath0 carried out for the moore ",
    "read state reveals a qualitatively different behavior .",
    "the numerical calculations have been carried out in haldane s spherical geometry,@xcite convenient for the exact study of short - range correlations . in this model , the lowest ll for particles of charge",

    "@xmath16 is the strength of dirac monopole in the center of the sphere defined in the units of elementary flux @xmath17 as @xmath18 , the total flux of the magnetic field @xmath19 through the surface of radius @xmath20 . using the usual definition of the magnetic length , @xmath21",
    ", this can be written as @xmath22 . in the following",
    ", @xmath23 denotes the qe magnetic length corresponding to the fractional charge @xmath24 .",
    "the relative ( @xmath25 ) and total ( @xmath26 ) pair angular momenta are related via @xmath27 . for fermions",
    ", @xmath25 is an odd integer , and it increases with increasing average pair separation @xmath28 .",
    "the interaction ( within the lowest ll ) is entirely determined by haldane pseudopotential defined as the pair interaction energy @xmath29 as a function of @xmath25 .",
    "recently , we have identified@xcite the series of finite - size spin - polarized states that in the thermodynamic limit describe the fqhe at @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "to do so , we have carried out extensive exact - diagonalization calculations for interacting qe s ( particles in the second cf ll ) .",
    "on haldane sphere , @xmath30 fermionic qe s were confined in a standard way to an angular momentum shell of degeneracy @xmath31 , corresponding to the qe filling factor @xmath32 , and the haldane qe ",
    "qe pseudopotential @xmath33 ) was taken from earlier calculations.@xcite    regardless of the electron layer width @xmath34 , magnetic field @xmath19 , or other experimental parameters , the dominant feature of @xmath35 is strong repulsion at @xmath36 .",
    "this feature alone determines the wavefunctions at @xmath37 ( with the qe ",
    "qe correlations consisting of maximum possible avoidance of haldane pair amplitude @xmath38 at @xmath36 ) , which are hence virtually insensitive to the ( sample - dependent ) details of @xmath35 .",
    "this justifies model calculations using @xmath35 of refs .",
    "actually , a model pseudopotential as simple as @xmath39 is sufficient to reproduce correct correlations and incompressibility at @xmath3 or @xmath4 .",
    "the numerical results carried out for @xmath40 ( two sample spectra are displayed in fig .  [ fig1 ] ) showed@xcite a sequence of nondegenerate ( i.e. , at the total angular momentum @xmath41 ) ground states at @xmath42 with @xmath6 and @xmath43 .",
    "the significant and well - behaved ( as a function of @xmath30 ) excitation gap along this sequence strongly suggests that it represents the infinite @xmath3 fqh state observed in experiment.@xcite the value @xmath44 precludes laughlin correlations among qe s in this state ( earlier ruled out indirectly , based on the form of qe ",
    "qe pseudopotential@xcite ) , i.e. , an idea that the @xmath3 state is simply a haldane hierarchy state of laughlin - correlated cf s .",
    "while the exact correlations in this ( known only numerically for a few consecutive @xmath30 ) ground state have not yet been defined , their vanishing degeneracy ( @xmath41 ) implies that they describe a qe liquid , rather than a broken - symmetry state ( such as liquid - crystal nematic states proposed@xcite in the context of fqhe at different values of @xmath9 ) .",
    "another sequence was anticipated at @xmath45 to represent the infinite @xmath11 fqh state . however , the only ground state with a significant gap and remaining outside of the @xmath6 sequence ( or its particle - hole symmetric @xmath46 sequence at @xmath47 ) occurs@xcite for @xmath12 and @xmath48 ( and it also has @xmath41 ) .",
    "these values of @xmath49 happen to belong to a @xmath50 series representing the moore  read ( pfaffian ) paired state , but the overlap between the two turns out nearly zero.@xcite moreover , the ground states for the two neighboring even ( as appropriate for a hypothetically paired state ) values of @xmath51 and 16 ( and @xmath52 and 29 ) have @xmath53 and no gap , the value of @xmath54 for @xmath55 coincides with the @xmath46 sequence ( so that only for @xmath56 can the filling factor @xmath9 be meaningfully assigned ) , and we are unable to compute the spectra for @xmath57 . nevertheless , despite little evidence available from numerical diagonalization , the ground state for @xmath12 and @xmath48 ( and its particle - hole counterpart at @xmath51 and the same @xmath48 ) may possibly represent the @xmath11 fqh state ( i.e. , have similar correlations causing incompressibility ) .",
    "qe pair - distribution functions @xmath0 have been calculated for the incompressible many - qe ground states as expectation values of the appropriate pair interaction , @xmath58 here , @xmath59 is the relative angle on a sphere , so that @xmath60 measures interparticle distance along the surface ( rather than chord distance ) .",
    "more accurately , @xmath60 is the distance between the centers of extended qe s ( note that in the calculation of many - qe wavefunctions , the system of qe s is mapped onto the lowest ll of point charges interacting through an effective pseudopotential ) .",
    "the prefactor in eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) ensures proper normalization , @xmath61 .",
    "denoting infinitesimal area by @xmath62 or ( in magnetic units ) by @xmath63 , we get an equivalent normalization condition , @xmath64\\,ds={2l\\over n}\\rightarrow\\nu^{-1 } \\label{eq2}\\ ] ] in large systems .",
    "since @xmath65 , a `` local filling factor '' can also be defined as @xmath66 , and it satisfies @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",
    "the results for the @xmath6 sequence at @xmath69 are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2](a ) .",
    "similarity of all four curves is evident , indicating size - independent form of correlations ( hence , describing an infinite system ) , with a well - developed shoulder around @xmath70 .",
    "similar shoulders occur in @xmath0 of all incompressible ground states at @xmath46 or @xmath7 ( the @xmath46 sequence at @xmath71 is obtained from @xmath69 by replacing @xmath30 with @xmath72 , while at @xmath10 there are two particle  hole conjugate sequences at @xmath50 and @xmath73 , denoted by @xmath74 ) .",
    "the four curves representative of @xmath6 , @xmath8 , and @xmath75 are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2](b ) .",
    "they are all clearly different from those marked with thin lines and describing correlations known for other incompressible fqh states ( full ll , laughlin @xmath6 state , or moore  read half - filled state ) .",
    "this is a direct indication of a different nature of qe ",
    "qe correlations responsible for the fqhe at @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "let us stress that although the qe ",
    "qe interactions are not known with great accuracy , the correlation functions in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] are rather insensitive to the details of @xmath35 , as long as the dominant repulsion occurs at @xmath36 ( which seems to be universally true in the systems studied experimentally ) .",
    "this insensitivity is reminiscent of the laughlin wavefunction , which also very accurately describes the actual @xmath6 ground state for a wide class of electron  electron pseudopotentials .",
    "however , while the avoidance of @xmath76 by the electrons in the lowest ll can be elegantly described by flux attachment in the cf picture , no similar model has been proposed yet for the avoidance of @xmath36 by the qe s .",
    "therefore , knowing the @xmath0 curves of qe s and understanding their correlations , we still can not write their wavefunctions .      .",
    "gaussian deconvolution parameters for qe ",
    "qe pair - distribution functions shown in figs .  [ fig2](b ) and [ fig3 ] . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     we have calculated the prefactors @xmath77 of the short - range approximation @xmath78 for different values of @xmath79 and @xmath80 and listed some in tab .  [ tab2 ] ( note that @xmath81 is known exactly ) .",
    "these coefficients are to be compared with @xmath82 of the incompressible @xmath30-qe states obtained from diagonalization .",
    "of course , this approach is somewhat questionable as one generally can not deduce the precise cluster size from the short - range behavior of @xmath0 for the following reasons : ( i ) @xmath79 is not a well - defined ( conserved ) quantum number ; ( ii ) @xmath6 states occur for all @xmath30 ( not only those divisible by two or three ) which means that all clusters can not have the same @xmath79 ; ( iii ) parameters @xmath83 and @xmath84 are size - dependent and their extrapolation to large systems is not very reliable based on limited number of @xmath30-qe systems we are able to diagonalize ; ( iv ) inter - cluster exchange of qe s makes the `` independent - cluster '' picture only an approximation .",
    "fortunately , we can use the moore  read states ( known to be paired @xcite ) as a test .",
    "our calculation ( for details see sec .  [ sec_pff ] ) for @xmath12 and @xmath48",
    "gives @xmath85 , somewhat larger than @xmath86 .",
    "hence , we shall assume that @xmath77 in general underestimates the actual value of @xmath84 in a many - body @xmath79-clustered state .",
    "for the qe s , we got @xmath87 for @xmath51 and @xmath88 ( @xmath6 ) , and @xmath89 for @xmath12 and @xmath48 ( @xmath90 ; directly comparable with the moore  read state ) . with appropriate reservation ,",
    "we can hence risk a hypothesis that qe s ( on the average ) form pairs at @xmath6 and triplets at @xmath10 ( possible triplet formation might turn out especially intriguing in the context of parafermion statistics@xcite ) .",
    "the evolution of @xmath0 when going from the lowest electron ll to the second cf ll ( i.e. , from ll@xmath91 to cf - ll@xmath92 ) is clear when using a model pseudopotential @xmath93 . for @xmath94 or 1 ,",
    "the correlations ( avoidance of @xmath95 or 3 ) are insensitive to @xmath96 , and both laughlin and qe ",
    "qe correlations are accurately reproduced by @xmath97 and @xmath98 , respectively .",
    "modeling correlations among electrons in ll@xmath92 ( the second ll ) is more difficult , because they are very sensitive to the exact form of @xmath35 at the corresponding @xmath99 . as a result , the @xmath30-electron coulomb eigenstates in ll@xmath92 are more susceptible to finite - size errors than in ll@xmath91 or cf - ll@xmath92 . in large systems",
    ", a good trial state is only known at @xmath10 ( moore  read state ) , and much less is established about the correlations at @xmath6 .",
    "still , the @xmath0 curves for electrons in ll@xmath92 must certainly fall between the two extreme curves for @xmath100 and 1 ( and differ from both of them ) .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig5](a ) for both @xmath6 and @xmath7 .    the exact moore ",
    "read wavefunctions were calculated on a sphere for @xmath40 and @xmath101 by diagonalizing a short - range three - body repulsion.@xcite in fig .",

    "the @xmath103 , also shown , is positive definite , very different from the qe curves in fig .",
    "[ fig4](b ) , and rather close to @xmath104 , where @xmath105 describes a laughlin @xmath106 state . assuming @xmath107 and expanding @xmath108 into @xmath109 and @xmath110 in accordance with eq .",
    "( [ eq2 ] ) one obtains an approximate formula @xmath111 marked with the circles in fig .",
    "[ fig4](b ) that appears to be quite accurate ( the largest finite - size error is in @xmath110 calculated for only @xmath112 , while @xmath109 is for @xmath51 ) .    the fact that @xmath108 is positive and rather featureless ( similar to @xmath105 ) for the moore ",
    "read wavefunction is in contrast with the result for qe s .",
    "this difference may indicate that the qe clusters can not be understood as literally as moore  read pairs .",
    "indeed , even the lack of correlation between the occurrence of @xmath41 ground states ( or size of the excitation gap ) and the divisibility of @xmath30 by @xmath113 or 3 precludes such a simple picture .",
    "the fact that @xmath114 could mean that the average relative ( with respect to center of mass ) angular momentum @xmath115 of the qe clusters is much larger than @xmath116 .",
    "certainly , @xmath115 is only conserved for an isolated cluster , but it is possible that the qe clusters are more relaxed due to cluster ",
    "cluster interaction than the moore  read pairs are .",
    "this would make @xmath117 underestimate the radius of the actual intra - cluster qe - qe correlation hole , and explain the negative sign of @xmath108 .",
    "from exact numerical diagonalization on haldane sphere , we obtained the energy spectra and wavefunctions of up to @xmath12 interacting laughlin qe s ( cf s in the second ll ) .",
    "we identified the series of finite - size liquid ground states with a gap , which extrapolate to the experimentally observed incompressible fqh states at @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and @xmath5 . in these states",
    ", we calculated qe ",
    "qe pair - distribution functions @xmath0 , and showed that they increase as @xmath13 at short range and have a pronounced shoulder at a medium range .",
    "this behavior supports the idea of qe cluster formation , suggested earlier from the analysis of qe ",
    "qe interaction pseudopotential .",
    "the @xmath0 is decomposed into short- and long - range contributions , interpreted as correlations between the qe s from the same or different clusters .",
    "the intra - cluster contribution to @xmath0 is that of a full ll , and the remaining term identified with the inter - cluster qe ",
    "qe correlations appears to be the same in all three @xmath6 , @xmath7 , and @xmath8 states .",
    "the ( average ) cluster size on the other hand does depend on @xmath9 , and we present arguments which suggest that the qe s form pairs at @xmath6 and triplets at @xmath10 .",
    "the qualitative difference between the @xmath0 curves obtained here for correlated cf s and those known for the laughlin and moore  read liquids of electrons are another indication that the origin of incompressibility at @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and @xmath5 is different .",
    "of other hypotheses invoked in literature and mentioned here in the introduction , the broken - symmetry states can not be excluded by our calculation in spherical geometry .",
    "however , we anticipate that the qe s form a liquid ( studied in this paper ) also in experimental samples , because of the whole series of isotropic ground states with a gap occurring in finite systems of different size .",
