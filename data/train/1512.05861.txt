    "the quest for a concrete particle theory realization of cosmological inflation continues to be a major theoretical challenge .",

    "the simple chaotic inflation models with a quadratic or quartic inflaton potential are disfavored by the observation . instead , the @xmath2-inflation model @xcite and the nonminimally coupled higgs inflation model @xcite , among others , have ( re)surfaced as viable accounts of the early universe .",
    "in particular , the bezrukov - shaposhnikov scenario @xcite of nonminimally coupled higgs inflation is an attractive proposal . this scenario is economical as there is no need to introduce a new field of unknown origin ; the higgs field that already exists in the standard model ( sm ) is responsible for inflation .",
    "the model also has strong predictive power as the physics at the inflationary scale is related to that of the collider scale through the renormalization group flow @xcite .",
    "there is a controversy on the unitarity problem associated with the large nonminimal coupling required in this type of scenario @xcite .",
    "this danger may be avoided , e.g. by considering the cutoff scale as field - dependent @xcite .",
    "the bezrukov - shaposhnikov scenario of higgs inflation assumes that the sm is valid all the way up to the energy scale of inflation .",
    "however , it is widely believed that the grand unification takes place at the energy scale of @xmath3 gev and there the physics is supposed to be described by grand unified theory ( gut )",
    ". the tensor - to - scalar ratio of @xmath4 , for example at 68% confidence . ] , implies that the hubble parameter during inflation can be as large as @xmath5 gev ; this is closer to the gut scale than to the electroweak scale , and thus inflation may be more appropriately discussed in the framework of gut than in the sm . in view of the elegant gauge coupling unification in the presence of supersymmetry , a natural beyond - the - sm extension of the bezrukov - shaposhnikov scenario",
    "would be in supersymmetric gut .",
    "implementation of the nonminimally coupled inflationary scenario in supersymmetric gut has been discussed e.g. in the supersymmetric @xmath0 model gut higgs inflation without supersymmetry is discussed in @xcite . ] @xcite and the supersymmetric pati - salam model @xcite . by construction , these nonminimally coupled models employ a noncanonical khler potential to circumvent the supergravity @xmath6 problem and at the same time to suppress the tensor mode fluctuations to be compatible with the observation .",
    "this type of model involves multiple scalars and in principle , the prediction for cosmological observables depends on the trajectory of the inflaton in the multidimensional field space . as pointed out in @xcite , there is a danger of tachyonic instabilities in undesired directions of the field space , but the instabilities may be removed and the inflaton trajectory can be controlled by further noncanonical terms in the khler potential @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "thus the trajectory of the inflaton is in general sensitive to the noncanonical terms , and naturally the prediction for the cosmological observables depends on the khler potential .",

    "another important topic that we have not touched upon in this paper is ( p)reheating after inflation .",
    "recent studies of nonminimally coupled multifield reheating based on simple inflationary toy models indicate that energy transfer due to parametric resonance is efficient @xcite , since the strong single - field attractor behavior persists during reheating and multifield de - phasing effects can be avoided . in our phenomenological example based on supersymmetric gut , in contrast , the inflaton dynamics after the slow roll may exhibit irregular and chaotic behavior , due to the irregular shape of the scalar potential near the gut and the sm vacua . such irregular motion may lead to suppression of the resonance effects as in @xcite .",

    "the klein - gordon equation obtained from the lagrangian is @xmath185 where @xmath186 is the covariantized time derivative which is defined to operate on a field space vector @xmath187 as @xmath188 the overdot is the derivative with respect to the cosmic time @xmath189 .",

    "such a half pipe however can not be too narrow since the sm vacuum @xmath198 , @xmath199 needs to be reached from the initial point @xmath200 . during inflation , light fields have quantum fluctuations of the order of the hubble parameter .",
