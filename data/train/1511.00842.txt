    "the parent compounds of cuprate superconductors are identified as mott insulators @xcite , in which the lack of conduction arises from the strong electron - electron repulsion .",
    "superconductivity then is obtained by adding charge carriers to insulating parent compounds with the superconducting ( sc ) transition temperature @xmath0 has a dome - shaped doping dependence @xcite . since the discovery of superconductivity in cuprate superconductors , the search for other families of superconductors that might supplement what is known about the sc mechanism of doped mott insulators has been of great interest .",
    "fortunately , it has been found @xcite that there is a class of cobaltate superconductors na@xmath3coo@xmath4h@xmath5o , which displays most of the structural and electronic features thought to be important for superconductivity in cuprate superconductors : strong two - dimensional character , proximity to a magnetically ordered nonmetallic state , and electron spin 1/2 . in particular , @xmath0 in cobaltate superconductors has the same unusual dome - shaped dependence on charge - carrier doping @xcite .",
    "however , there is one interesting difference : in the cuprate superconductors @xcite , cu ions in a square array are ordered antiferromagnetically , and then spin fluctuations are thought to play a crucial role in the charge - carrier pairing , while in the cobaltate superconductors @xcite , co ions in a triangular array are magnetically frustrated , and therefore this geometric frustration may suppress @xmath0 to low temperatures .",
    "it has been argued that the triangular - lattice cobaltate superconductors are probably the only system other than the square - lattice cuprate superconductors where a doped mott insulator becomes a superconductor .",
    "the heat - capacity measurement of the specific - heat can probe the bulk properties of a superconductor , which has been proven as a powerful tool to investigate the low - energy quasiparticle excitations , and therefore gives information about the charge - carrier pairing symmetry , specifically , the existence of gap nodes at the fermi surface @xcite . in conventional superconductors",
    "@xcite , the absence of the low - energy quasiparticle excitations is reflected in the thermodynamic properties , where the specific - heat of conventional superconductors is experimentally found to be exponential at low temperatures , since conventional superconductors are fully gaped at the fermi surface . however , the situation in the triangular - lattice cobaltate superconductors is rather complicated , since the experimental results obtained from different measurement techniques show a strong sample dependence @xcite .",
    "thus it is rather difficult to obtain conclusive results .",
    "the early specific - heat measurements @xcite showed that the specific - heat in the triangular - lattice cobaltate superconductors reveals a sharp peak at @xmath0 , and can be explained phenomenologically within the bardeen - cooper - schrieffer ( bcs ) formalism under an unconventional sc symmetry with line nodes .",
    "however , by contrast , the latest heat - capacity measurements @xcite indicated that among a large number of the gap symmetries that have been suggested @xcite , the sc - state with d - wave ( @xmath6 pairing ) symmetry without gap nodes at the fermi surface is consistent with the observed specific - heat data .",
    "furthermore , by virtue of the magnetization measurement technique , the value of the upper critical field and its temperature dependence have been observed for all the temperatures @xmath7 @xcite , where the temperature dependence of the upper critical field follows qualitatively the bcs type temperature dependence . on the theoretical hand , there is a general consensus that superconductivity in the triangular - lattice cobaltate superconductors is caused by the strong electron correlation @xcite . using the resonating - valence - bond mean - field approach ,",
    "it has been suggested that the spin fluctuation enhanced by the dopant dynamics leads to a d - wave sc - state @xcite .",
    "based on the mean - field variational approach with gutzwiller approximation , a d - wave sc - state is realized in the parameter region close to the triangular - lattice cobaltate superconductors @xcite . within the framework of the kinetic - energy - driven sc mechanism @xcite",
    ", it has been demonstrated that charge carriers are held together in d - wave pairs at low temperatures by the attractive interaction that originates directly from the kinetic energy by the exchange of spin excitations @xcite .",
    "moreover , superconductivity with the d - wave symmetry has been explored by a large - scale dynamical cluster quantum monte carlo simulation on the triangular - lattice hubbard model @xcite . in particular , using the diagram technique in the atomic representation , the sc phase with the d - wave symmetry in an ensemble of the hubbard fermions on a triangular lattice has been discussed @xcite , where the domelike shape of the doping dependence of @xmath0 is obtained . however , to the best of our knowledge , the thermodynamic properties of the triangular - lattice cobaltate superconductors have not been treated starting from a microscopic sc theory , and no explicit calculations of the doping dependence of the upper critical field have been made so far .    in this case , a challenging issue for theory is to explain the thermodynamic properties of the triangular - lattice cobaltate superconductors . in our recent study @xcite , the electromagnetic response in the triangular - lattice cobaltate superconductors",
    "is studied based on the kinetic - energy - driven sc mechanism @xcite , where we show that the magnetic - field - penetration depth exhibits an exponential temperature dependence due to the absence of the d - wave gap nodes at the charge - carrier fermi surface . moreover , in analogy to the dome - shaped doping dependence of @xmath2 , the superfluid density increases with increasing doping in the lower doped regime , and reaches a maximum around the critical doping , then decreases in the higher doped regime . in this paper , we start from the theoretical framework of the kinetic - energy - driven superconductivity , and then provide a natural explanation to the thermodynamic properties in the triangular - lattice cobaltate superconductors .",
    "we evaluate explicitly the internal energy , and then qualitatively reproduced some main features of the heat - capacity and magnetization measurements on the triangular - lattice cobaltate superconductors @xcite .",
    "in particular , we show that a sharp peak in the specific - heat of the triangular - lattice cobaltate superconductors appears at @xmath0 , and then the specific - heat varies exponentially as a function of temperature for the temperatures @xmath1 due to the absence of the d - wave gap nodes at the charge - carrier fermi surface , which is much different from that in the square - lattice cuprate superconductors @xcite , where the characteristic feature is the existence of the gap nodes on the charge - carrier fermi surface , and then the specific - heat in the square - lattice cuprate superconductors decreases with decreasing temperatures as some power of the temperature in the temperature range @xmath1 .",
    "moreover , the upper critical field follows qualitatively the bcs type temperature dependence , and has the same dome - shaped doping dependence as @xmath2 .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows .",
    "we present the basic formalism in section [ framework ] , and then the quantitative characteristics of the thermodynamic properties in the triangular - lattice cobaltate superconductors are discussed in section [ thermodynamic ] , where we show that although the pairing mechanism is driven by the kinetic energy by the exchange of spin excitations @xcite , the sharp peak of the specific - heat in the triangular - lattice cobaltate superconductors at @xmath0 can be described qualitatively by the kinetic - energy - driven d - wave bcs - like formalism .",
    "finally , we give a summary in section [ conclusions ] .",
    "in the triangular - lattice cobaltate superconductors , the characteristic feature is the presence of the two - dimensional coo@xmath5 plane @xcite . in this case , a useful microscopic model that has been widely used to describe the low - energy physics of the doped coo@xmath5 plane is the @xmath8-@xmath9 model on a triangular lattice @xcite .",
    "this @xmath8-@xmath9 model is defined through only two competing parameters : the nearest - neighbor ( nn ) hopping integral @xmath8 in the kinetic - energy term , which measures the electron delocalization through the lattice , and the nn spin - spin antiferromagnetic ( af ) exchange coupling @xmath9 in the magnetic - energy part , which describes af coupling between localized spins . in particular , the nn hopping integral @xmath8 is much larger than the af exchange coupling constant @xmath9 in the heisenberg term , and therefore the spin configuration is strongly rearranged due to the effect of the charge - carrier hopping @xmath8 on the spins , which leads to a strong coupling between the charge and spin degrees of freedom of the electron . since the triangular - lattice cobaltate superconductors are viewed as an electron - doped mott insulators @xcite , this @xmath8-@xmath9 model is subject to an important local constraint @xmath10 to avoid zero occupancy , where @xmath11 ( @xmath12 ) is the electron creation ( annihilation ) operator . in the hole - doped side ,",
    "the local constraint of no double electron occupancy has been treated properly within the fermion - spin approach @xcite . however , for an application of the fermion - spin theory to the electron - doped case , we @xcite should make a particle - hole transformation @xmath13 , where @xmath14 ( @xmath15 ) is the hole creation ( annihilation ) operator , and then the local constraint @xmath10 without zero occupancy in the electron - doped case is replaced by the local constraint of no double occupancy @xmath16 in the hole representation .",
    "this local constraint of no double occupancy now can be dealt by the fermion - spin theory @xcite , where the hole operators @xmath17 and @xmath18 are decoupled as @xmath19 and @xmath20 , respectively , with the charge degree of freedom of the hole together with some effects of spin configuration rearrangements due to the presence of the doped charge carrier itself that are represented by the spinful fermion operator @xmath21 , while the spin degree of freedom of the hole is represented by the spin operator @xmath22 .",
    "the advantage of this fermion - spin approach is that the local constraint of no double occupancy is always satisfied in actual calculations .",
    "based on the @xmath8-@xmath9 model in the fermion - spin representation , the kinetic - energy - driven sc mechanism has been developed for the square - lattice cuprate superconductors in the doped regime without an af long - range order ( aflro ) @xcite , where the attractive interaction between charge carriers originates directly from the interaction between charge carriers and spins in the kinetic energy of the @xmath8-@xmath9 model by the exchange of spin excitations in the higher powers of the doping concentration .",
    "this attractive interaction leads to the formation of the charge - carrier pairs with the d - wave symmetry , while the electron cooper pairs originated from the charge - carrier d - wave pairing state are due to the charge - spin recombination @xcite , and they condense into the d - wave sc - state .",
    "furthermore , within the framework of the kinetic - energy - driven superconductivity , the doping dependence of the thermodynamic properties in the square - lattice cuprate superconductors has been studied @xcite , and then the striking behavior of the specific - heat in the square - lattice cuprate superconductors are well reproduced .",
    "the triangular - lattice cobaltate superconductors on the other hand are the second known example of superconductivity arising from doping a mott insulator after the square - lattice cuprate superconductors .",
    "although @xmath0 in the triangular - lattice cobaltate superconductors is much less than that in the square - lattice cuprate superconductors , the strong electron correlation is common for both these materials , which suggest that these two oxide systems may have the same underlying sc mechanism . in this case",
    ", the kinetic - energy - driven superconductivity developed for the square - lattice cuprate superconductors has been generalized to the case for the triangular - lattice cobaltate superconductors @xcite .",
    "the present work of the discussions of the thermodynamic properties in the triangular - lattice cobaltate superconductors builds on the kinetic - energy - driven sc mechanism developed in refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite , and only a short summary of the formalism is therefore given in the following discussions . in our previous discussions in the doped regime without aflro ,",
    "the full charge - carrier diagonal and off - diagonal green s functions of the @xmath8-@xmath9 model on a triangular lattice in the charge - carrier pairing state have been obtained explicitly as @xcite ,    [ bcsgf ] @xmath23    where the charge - carrier quasiparticle coherent weight @xmath24 , the charge - carrier quasiparticle coherence factors @xmath25 and @xmath26 , the charge - carrier quasiparticle energy spectrum @xmath27 , and the charge - carrier excitation spectrum @xmath28 . in the early days of superconductivity in the triangular - lattice cobaltate superconductors , some nmr and nqr data are consistent with the case of the existence of a pair gap over the fermi surface @xcite ,",
    "while other experimental nmr and nqr results suggest the existence of the gap nodes @xcite . in particular , it has been argued that only involving the pairings of charge carriers located at the next nn sites can give rise to the nodal points of the complex gap appearing inside the brillouin zone @xcite .",
    "moreover , the nodal points of the complex gap has been obtained theoretically by considering the interaction between the hubbard fermions @xcite . however , although the recent experimental results @xcite obtained from the specific - heat measurements do not give unambiguous evidence for either the presence or absence of the nodes in the energy gap , the experimental data of the specific - heat @xcite are consistent with these fitted results obtained from phenomenological bcs formalism with the d - wave symmetry without gap nodes .",
    "furthermore , some theoretical calculations based on the numerical simulations indicate that the d - wave state without gap nodes is the lowest state around the electron - doped regime where superconductivity appears in triangular - lattice cobaltate superconductors @xcite .",
    "in particular , the recent theoretical studies based on a large - scale dynamical cluster quantum monte carlo simulation @xcite and a combined cluster calculation and renormalization group approach @xcite show that the d - wave state naturally explains some sc - state properties as indicated by experiments . in this case",
    ", we only consider the case with the d - wave pairing symmetry as our previous discussions @xcite , and then the d - wave charge - carrier pair gap @xmath29 in eq .",
    "( [ bcsgf ] ) has been given in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "since the spin part in the @xmath8-@xmath9 model in the fermion - spin representation is anisotropic away from half - filling @xcite , two spin green s functions @xmath30 and @xmath31 have been defined to describe properly the spin part , and can be obtained explicitly as ,    [ sgf ] @xmath32    where the function @xmath33 and spin excitation spectrum @xmath34 in the spin green s function ( [ mfsgf ] ) have been given in ref .",
