    "in recent years the field of ultracold atomic physics has attracted the attention of a great many condensed matter theorists , largely due to the prospect of finding novel realizations of many - body systems .",
    "part of the appeal doubtless lies in the exquisite experimental control that may be exercised over the parameters of a system in which many of the complicating factors familiar from the solid state ( disorder , phonons , etc . )",
    "are absent .",
    "intrinsic _ aspects of ultracold atomic gases  not dependent on the specifics of the experimental setting  are qualitatively novel , however , and without antecedent in the study of condensed matter . in this latter category",
    "we may place the possibility of spontaneous ordering of the spin degrees of freedom in a bose gas .",
    "indeed , prior to the ` ultracold revolution ' the only bose superfluid that could be studied in the laboratory was @xmath0he , which has zero spin . with the advent of optical trapping of bose condensates of alkali atoms , which allows for a fully rotationally invariant setting , the experimental study of spin ordering within a hyperfine multiplet came within reach  @xcite .",
    "the earliest theoretical works motivated by these developments explored possible ordered phases using a mean field description , in both the spin 1 and spin 2 hyperfine multiplets  @xcite . in this description the concept of spontaneous symmetry breaking plays a central role .",
    "up until very recently , however , there were no experiments in which this spontaneous ordering was apparent .",
    "the reason for this is that the simplest experimental protocol for the investigation of the hyperfine state of the gas is to apply a magnetic field gradient to split a gas cloud into different components in a stern - gerlach experiment  @xcite .",
    "the different components are subsequently imaged to determine their ( relative ) occupancies .",
    "this technique naturally imposes a quantization axis , and any information concerning the _ coherence _ between different hyperfine levels is lost . thus magnetic alignment in the plane perpendicular to this axis , which depends on the relative phase of these different levels , can not be observed .",
    "the characterization of magnetic ordering in atomic gases has taken a leap forward in the last few years thanks to the work of the berkeley group , who demonstrated _ in situ _ dispersive imaging of the transverse magnetization of a gas of @xmath1rb in the spin 1 multiplet  @xcite , and subsequently employed this technique to investigate a number of fascinating aspects of this system , including the dynamics of spontanteous symmetry breaking , defect production , and the role played by magnetic dipole forces  @xcite .",
    "the above developments illustrate two important needs .",
    "firstly , imaging of the spin order was necessary to bring much of this new physics out into the open .",
    "secondly , the nonequilibrium character of most experiments requires that the mean field theory of equilibrium ordered states be supplemented with a _",
    "dynamical _ description of the relevant order parameters .",
    "it is our hope that the next few years will see the development of imaging techniques capable of detecting some of the spin orders to be discussed in section  [ sec : spin ] , of which an average magnetization is only the simplest .",
    "the aim of this work is to address the second need : uncovering the low energy description of the order parameter . for the case of the bose ferromagnet , which is appropriate to the spin 1 @xmath1rb system ,",
    "this description was provided in an earlier paper  @xcite . in this work",
    "we will focus instead on states with vanishing average magnetization . for reasons that will be become clear in the following sections these cases are qualitatively different .      in an ordered phase of matter we expect that the low energy degrees of freedom consist of variations of the order parameter on some manifold of symmetry broken states ( goldstone modes ) , together with any conserved quantities . in our earlier work on the bose ferromagnet  @xcite the degrees of freedom were the local magnetic moment @xmath2 and the superfluid velocity @xmath3 . in the long wavelength limit",
    "these were found to obey the coupled equations @xmath4 @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the convective derivative .",
    "( [ lle ] ) is a modified landau - lifshitz equation and gives rise to quadratically dispersing spinwaves when linearized on around a solution @xmath7 .",
    "the quadratic dispersion is a consequence of the two transverse deviations of the order parameter being canonically conjugate . for the phases with vanishing average magnetization that are the focus of this work ,",
    "the conjugate variables involve deviations from the order parameter manifold .",
    "this results in linearly dispersing goldstone modes .",
    "the situation is analogous to the case of spin waves in an antiferromagnet , where the conjugate variables are the difference in magnetization on neighboring sites  the nel order parameter  and the sum .",
    "it also follows from the vanishing of the average magnetization that the order parameter dynamics and superfluid flow are decoupled except for a global topological constraint . again , this is quite different from the case of the ferromagnet , where the two are coupled together in the equations of motion .",
    "it follows that we can write a lagrangian for the spin degrees of freedom only .",
    "this lagrangian is expressed in terms of a rotation matrix @xmath8 that specifies the local orientation of the spin state relative to some reference state . by expressing the matrix elements of @xmath8 in terms of an orthonormal triad @xmath9 , with @xmath10",
    ", the spin lagrangian may be written @xmath11\\ ] ] here @xmath12 are @xmath13 are some constants to be specified later , which depend on the ordered phase in question .",
    "the lagrangian eq .",
    "( [ l_genspin ] ) is the main result of this paper .",
    "the only other phase for which the spin lagrangian was previously obtained is the polar phase of the spin 1 gas , to be discussed below , in which @xmath14 , @xmath15 , giving the familiar @xmath16 model  @xcite .",
    "the structure of the remainder of this paper is as follows . in section  [ sec : basics ]",
    "we review the basic description of a spinor condensate , and in particular the structure of the interaction hamiltonian .",
    "section  [ sec : spin ] describes in detail the ground state manifolds of the different phases of spinor condensates , beginning with the simplest non - trivial case , spin 1 , before introducing the majorana ( or stellar ) representation that is very useful in visualizing spin states .",
    "the global structure and local geometry of the order parameter manifolds are then introduced , as well as a parametrization for the dynamical variables conjugate to the order parameter .",
    "after this the derivation of the low energy lagrangian is a relatively simple matter , and is described in section  [ sec : low ] along with the derivation of the equations of motion .",
    "we have tried to keep the presentation pedagogical throughout , though at various points there are parenthetical technical comments that the casual reader should feel free to ignore .    in a related work ,",
    "barnett _ et al . _",
    "@xcite have derived the full equations of motion of a spinor condensate in terms of the majorana representation and applied a group - theoretical analysis to the determination of all normal modes about an ordered ground state .",
    "we pursue a complimentary goal of obtaining the full _ nonlinear _",
    "lagrangian for the goldstone modes only .",
    "one could take the point of view that the description of the dynamics of a dilute spinor gas is no different from its spinless counterpart , being governed by the time - dependent gross - pitaevskii equation , with lagrangian density @xmath17 ( we set @xmath18 from now on ) . for a spin @xmath19 gas @xmath20",
    "is a @xmath21 component spinor and the hamiltonian density has the form @xmath22 where the first term is the kinetic energy .",
    "the interaction part @xmath23 is quartic in @xmath20 and its form will be given below for @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "we will not discuss the influence of the trapping potential , save to assume that it preserves rotational symmetry .",
    "for stationary solutions of the form @xmath26 the time - dependent description reduces to the time - independent gross - pitaevskii theory , with @xmath27 the chemical potential . instead of treating the action @xmath28 classically",
    ", we can interpret it as the quantum action in a coherent state path integral .",
    "little that we will have to say will depend upon this distinction .",
    "in fact this superficial similarity between the spinless and spinful problems is quite misleading .",
    "the ground state in a uniform system corresponds to some constant @xmath20 . in the spinless case",
    "this fixes @xmath20 up to a phase once the density @xmath29 is specified .",
    "but in the spinful case we still have to find the correct ` direction ' of @xmath20 in the complex @xmath21 dimensional spinor space , determined by minimizing the interaction hamiltonian @xmath23 .",
    "the interactions will be assumed to respect rotational symmetry , so this minimum is only unique up to rotation ( specified by the three euler angles , say ) . choosing this rotation  starting from some arbitrary reference state  specifies the spontaneous breaking of rotational symmetry in the ground state .",
    "the slow variation of this rotation in space and time constitutes the low energy dynamics of the system , the description of which is the subject of this work . to characterize these low energy manifolds",
    "we must first specify the form of @xmath30 .",
    "the structure of @xmath30 has been discussed in many works , starting with the first papers treating spinor bose condensates .",
    "we will therefore keep the following discussion relatively brief .",
    "low energy scattering between a pair of bosons occurs in the @xmath19-wave channel only , and can be treated as a @xmath31-function interaction , characterized by a set of interaction constants @xmath32 , @xmath33 for a pair of bosons with total spin @xmath34 .",
    "bose symmetry dictates that the interaction vanishes for odd total spin .    for spin 1",
    ", the resulting interaction may be presented in the form  @xcite @xmath35 where @xmath36 are the spin @xmath19 angular momentum matrices .",
    "( [ spin1hint ] ) is the sum of a density - density and a spin - spin interaction . for spin 2",
    "we have  @xcite @xmath37 here @xmath38 is a scalar representing the amplitude of singlet pairs of spin s ( eq .  ( [ spin1hint ] ) can be expressed using this operation instead of the spin - spin interaction . in the spin 2 case",
    "both terms are needed ) .",
    "our use of @xmath39 for two different quantities matches the notation of the works cited above , where one may find explicit expressions for @xmath40 @xmath41 in terms the constants @xmath32 defined above .    in the spin 1 case",
    "it is fairly clear how to minimize eq .",
    "( [ spin1hint ] ) at fixed density . for the spin 2 case things",
    "are less obvious . in the next section",
    "we will discuss a method of parametrizing the spinor @xmath42 to make this operation transparent .",
    "in this section we will introduce the majorana ( or _ stellar _ ) representation of spin states .",
    "this provides a vivid way to picture spin ordering in higher spin condensates in which rotational symmetry is manifest .",
    "none of the calculations of section  [ sec : low ] depend upon this representation ; its use is rather in providing a concrete way to picture the ground state manifold .    before beginning it is worth setting the scene with a more pedestrian discussion of the spin 1 case  @xcite .",
    "let us minimize eq .",
    "( [ spin1hint ] ) with a spinor @xmath42 normalized to unity ( thus we are adopting units in which the density @xmath43 ) .",
    "this is a matter of minimizing ( maximizing ) @xmath44 for @xmath45 ( @xmath46 ) .",
    "one way to make the resulting states more clear is to write the complex spinor @xmath47 where @xmath48 and @xmath49 are two real vectors satisfying @xmath50 , and to work in cartesian components .",

    "ferromagnetic _ as it corresponds to maximal polarization of the spin .",
    "the resulting order parameter manifold corresponds to the set of all configuration of a pair of orthogonal vectors , and is thus identified with the group of rotations @xmath56    for @xmath45 @xmath48 and @xmath49 are aligned",
    ". the resulting _ polar _ state ( the name originates from an analogous state in superfluid @xmath57he ) can therefore be written as @xmath58 for @xmath59 a _ real _ unit vector .",
    "note that this parametrization has some redundancy in that the points @xmath60 and @xmath61 are identified .",
    "the resulting manifold is known as the _ mapping torus _ of the antipodal map of the sphere @xmath62 .",
    "the global topology of the above ferromagnetic and polar order parameter manifolds naturally determines the character of the topological defects in the ordered phases , and certain features of the ordering transitions , some of which have already been discussed in the literature  @xcite .",
    "this is not the focus of the present work and topology will not be further discussed , even though the defect physics of the higher spin condensates promises to be highly non - trivial  @xcite .",
    "the polar state has @xmath63 .",
    "nevertheless the above discussion makes it clear that polar ordering involves a choice of axis : the spinor @xmath64 is the @xmath65 state with respect to the axis @xmath59 .",
    "it is natural to ask for an operator that acquires a non - zero expectation value in the polar state .",
    "the obvious candidate is the spin 2 quadrupole tensor ( or _ nematicity _ ) @xmath66 with @xmath67 such expressions are familiar in the study of nematic liquid crystals , where the vector @xmath59 is known as the director . in the liquid crystal context the identification of @xmath59 and @xmath68 without the phase factor in eq .",
    "( [ polar_parm ] ) ( the order parameter manifold is then the real projective plane @xmath69 ) makes for very different defect physics , however  @xcite .",
    "nematic ordering in solid state magnetic systems has been the subject of much experimental and theoretical work in recent years , with a good deal of uncertainty still remaining .",
    "the observation of the polar state in the spin 1 bose gas would therefore be an important milestone .",
    "searching for higher spin order parameters as the spin of the gas particles increases becomes arduous .",
    "we now turn to a more convenient representation of the spin order .",
    "the representation of a general spin @xmath19 state that ( sometimes ) bears his name was discovered by majorana in 1932  @xcite , and independently several times since  @xcite , though it has antecedents in 19@xmath70 century mathematics  @xcite .",
    "a very nice discussion can be found in ref .  .",
    "the result is very simple to state , and represents a generalization of the bloch sphere for spin 1/2 to arbitrary spin .",
    "up to normalization and a phase  thus in more mathematical terms we are parametrizing the complex projective space @xmath71  an arbitrary spin @xmath19 state can be specified by locating @xmath72 indistinguishable points on the unit sphere ( see fig .  [",

    "[ fig : principal],title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=40.0% ] +    there are two steps to understand why this is so .",
    "first , imagine forming our spin @xmath19 from @xmath72 spin 1/2 in the totally symmetric subspace .",
    "an arbitrary state may then be written as a totally symmetric spinor @xmath73 , where the round brackets denote the operation of symmetrization and each of the @xmath21 indices can take the value @xmath74 or @xmath75 .",
    "the relationship between @xmath76 and the corresponding @xmath21 component spinor @xmath42 is @xmath77 next contract every index of @xmath76 with @xmath78 .",
    "denoting by @xmath79 the resulting polynomial of order @xmath72 , the fundamental theorem of algebra tells us @xmath80 with @xmath81 some normalization .",
    "thus @xmath76 may be written @xmath82 with the _ principal spinors _",
    "@xmath83 , @xmath84 , etc . related to the @xmath85 by @xmath86 relations that are unchanged",
    "if we normalize the spinors , in which case they correspond to @xmath72 points on the bloch sphere with coordinates @xmath87 , @xmath88 @xmath89 ( notice that @xmath76 in eq .",
    "( [ root_spinors ] ) is not in general normalized when the principal spinors are ) .",
    "then ( minus ) the roots of @xmath79 can be written @xmath90 and correspond to stereographic projection from the north pole to the plane tangent to the sphere at the south pole .",
    "the beautiful feature of the majorana representation is that rotations act simply as rotations on the bloch sphere . of course , it is useful to have an explicit expression for the polynomial @xmath79 in terms of the @xmath21 components of the spin @xmath19 state @xmath42 .",
    "it is easy to show @xmath91 if spinor indices are raised and lowered using the antisymmetric tensors @xmath92 and @xmath93 ( with @xmath94 and @xmath95 ) @xmath96 then rotational invariance upon contraction of indices is guaranteed ( in fact the result is invariant under the larger group @xmath97 , a result that will be useful later ) . if we denote by @xmath98 the result on @xmath42 of raising all indices of the corresponding symmetric spinor , then one can readily see that @xmath99 , and thus @xmath100 . after raising indices of the principal spinors we have @xmath101 , etc",

    "thus we see that the spinor @xmath103 is represented by a set of points antipodal to those representing @xmath42 .",
    "furthermore , the majorana representation of a normalized state with @xmath104 , corresponding to @xmath105 , consists of pairs of antipodal points ( and is thus only possible for integer spin ) .",

    "the transformation @xmath106 is in fact the ( anti - unitary ) operation of time reversal .",
    "the use of the majorana representation to visualize spin ordering in a bose gas was suggested in ref .  .",
    "let us first see how the phases of the spin 1 gas discussed in section  [ sec : spin1phases ] appear in this representation , before moving on to the spin 2 case .      as mentioned in section  [ sec : hint ] ,",
