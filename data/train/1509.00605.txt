    "electric and electronic control devices are indispensable for a variety of modern technologies . however , these technologies typically become useless during massive power outages such as those caused by natural or other disasters . in this paper , we consider a non - electrified alternative control method to stabilize an inverted pendulum using gravitational potential .",
    "our proposed mechanism is a wheeled inverted pendulum that descends a slope .",
    "the brake mechanism of our proposed mechanism transforms gravity force into friction force between the pendulum and the wheel .",
    "this friction produces a restoring force by which the pendulum is asymptotically stabilized in a standing position .",
    "approaches similar to ours can be found in the field of passive dynamic walking , pioneered by mcgeer @xcite , in which two - legged mechanisms are designed to stably walk down a slope that consume only gravitational potential energy .",
    "extensive studies have been reported on the passive dynamic walking , including experimental development of passive walkers @xcite and nonlinear analyses of passive dynamic walking based on simplified models @xcite .",
    "early insights into the use of such passivity can also be found in the study of passive gravity - gradient attitude stabilization @xcite wherein the alignment of one axis of a satellite along the earth s local vertical direction was achieved without the use of active control elements .    on the other hand ,",
    "the wheeled inverted pendulum has attracted significant attention in the fields of control engineering and robotics . because of",
    "the applications of wheeled inverted pendulums in personal mobility devices , including the segway@xmath0 @xcite , methods for controlling wheeled inverted pendulums have been developed via approaches such as partial feedback linearization @xcite , inclined surface control @xcite , sliding - mode velocity control @xcite , neuro - fuzzy - based control @xcite , and robust control based on a quasi - linear parameter - varying model @xcite .",
    "not surprisingly , these studies implied the use of electric devices .    in this paper",
    ", we merge concepts from passive dynamic walking and studies of the wheeled inverted pendulum to derive our new mechanical design for the non - electrified stabilization of a wheeled inverted pendulum .",
    "as stated above , we propose a wheeled double pendulum mechanism , whose second pendulum transforms gravity force into braking force that acts on the wheel . to investigate the dynamic stabilities of this newly proposed mechanism , we start with deriving a nonlinear analytical model of the mechanism to examine the stabilities of its steady states .",
    "three types of critical points arise in the analytical model .",
    "these critical points are analytically characterized and numerically continued in the parameter space to obtain stability limits for the steady standing motions .",
    "it is found that the stability of the proposed mechanism is limited by hopf bifurcation and vanishing external resistance on the wheel .",
    "[ fig : model ]    we propose a wheeled inverted pendulum with friction control , as shown in fig.[fig : model ] , that comprises 1 ) a wheel placed on a slope without slipping , 2 ) a double pendulum suspended on the wheel axis , and 3 ) a friction control mechanism that generates a braking force on the wheel proportional to the angle between the first and second pendulums .",
    "hereinafter , we refer to this model as a friction - controlled wheeled inverted pendulum ( fcwip ) .",
    "configuration of the fcwip can be described by a three - dimensional generalized coordinate : ( @xmath1 denotes transpose ) @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the rotational angle of the wheel , @xmath4 is the absolute slant angle of the first pendulum , and @xmath5 is the relative angle of the second pendulum from the first pendulum . in addition , we consider the corresponding generalized force : @xmath6 where @xmath7 is a torque acting on @xmath8 .",
    "unless the friction control mechanism ( or @xmath9 ) is specified , the fcwip in fig.[fig : model ] is simply a wheeled double pendulum whose lagrangian is given by @xmath10 with @xmath11 where the physical parameters are listed in table[tab : para1 ] .",

    "these conditions are required to stabilize the first pendulum in a standing position . because , they guarantee existence of the braking force @xmath22 caused by a negative clearance between the brake pad and disk , @xmath23 ( or @xmath20 ) , and that is mechanically caused by @xmath24 . otherwise , the braking force vanishes , and the fcwip becomes nothing more than an uncontrolled wheeled double pendulum that can never be stabilized around the standing position .    in addition , note that the fcwip model , in absence of the floor model of the slope , can theoretically have another stable steady state , a static equilibrium where the second pendulum is hanging down at rest at @xmath25 and @xmath26 for small @xmath27 .",

    "in particular , ( [ eqn : ss1 ] ) can also be derived from the balance of the energy supply from the gravitational potential and the energy consumption via coulomb friction and quadratic resistance .",
    "the steady - state equations in ( [ eqn : ss0 ] ) , ( [ eqn : ss1 ] ) , ( [ eqn : ss2 ] ) , and ( [ eqn : ss3 ] ) can be reduced to the following form : @xmath37 thus , we have derived the steady - state equations of the fcwip model with three unknowns @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and @xmath38 ( @xmath39 ) .",

    "<S> , the proposed mechanism descends the slope in a stable standing position , while dissipating gravitational potential energy via the brake mechanism . by numerically continuing the stability limits in the parameter space , we find that the stable parameter region is simply connected . </S>",
