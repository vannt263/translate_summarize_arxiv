    "it is difficult to accommodate all the apparent oscillations in a three neutrino generation model .",
    "however , an additional sterile neutrino ( @xmath218 ) can easily explain all the oscillations .    in this section , i will review the new result presented at this workshop from super - kamiokande  @xcite on the atmospheric @xmath6 deficit and from chorus and nomad on the search  @xcite for @xmath7 oscillation .",

    "the @xmath224 oscillation scenario has been investigated using two techniques based on the fact that @xmath218 has no neutral current coupling .",

    "the effect is more prominent at higher energies and no distortion in the angular distribution of high energy events is observed .",

    "in the standard model , there is no symmetry associated with lepton number and therefore there is no fundamental conservation law for lepton number ; lepton number conservation is an experimentally observed phenomenon .",
    "lepton number violation is expected in many extensions of the standard model such as lepto - quarks , susy , superstrings , left - right symmetric models and models which include heavy neutral leptons .",

    "the experimenters have searched in 49 decay modes and the 90% cl upper limits  @xcite are typically @xmath243 .",
    "the limits on the decays that violate both lepton and baryon numbers ( but conserve baryon minus lepton number ) are new since tau98 .",

    "it is evident that for two of the related decays , @xmath251 and @xmath252 , the experimental limits have already constrained some of the parameters in the theory .",
    "the last two decays have no experimental limits and are within the reach of the current b - factory experiments",
    ".      we can expect another order of magnitude improvement in sensitivity for the lepton number violating @xmath0 decays in the near future from the b - factory experiments .",
    "this is based on the assumption that the search is not background limited as was the case with cleo  ii which provides all but four of the 49 limits .",
    "lhcb  @xcite is an experiment at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) at cern that may have good sensitivity for neutrinoless @xmath0 decays produced in @xmath253 collisions at a center - of - mass energy of 14  tev .",

    "this corresponds to the production of @xmath257 s , of which @xmath258 s are in the lhcb acceptance .",

    "the expected mass resolution is excellent , 5.4 mev .",
    "however , the potential signal is on a large combinatoric background of the true muon from @xmath260 and random tracks . under the assumption of no observed signal , the experiment can set a 90% cl limit of @xmath261 after one year of data collection .",
    "this is not very competitive in view of the fact that the b - factory experiments will reach this sensitivity in the near future and lhcb is not scheduled to commence data collection until the year 2005 .",
    "the estimate of the sensitivity is preliminary and the search technique is currently being refined .",
    "possible modification to the trigger to enhance the sensitivity is being considered .",
    "the sensitivity to other neutrinoless @xmath0 decays with pions and kaons will be investigated .",
    "i would like to repeat the suggestion i made at tau98 : both cdf and d0 may have good sensitivity to neutrinoless @xmath0 decays and i would like to urge the experimenters to perform the search !",
    "in this section , i will discuss the future prospects of the physics of the @xmath0 lepton .",
    "the future prospect for the @xmath0 neutrino has already been discussed in the section on neutrino oscillation .    in the next few years , we expect most of the results will come from the b - factory experiments . both babar at slac and belle at kek have collected a data sample comparable to the cleo  ii experiment at cornell .",
    "the cleo  ii experiment collected @xmath262 of data , corresponding to @xmath263 produced events .",
    "we expect most of the analyses performed by cleo  ii will be repeated with smaller statistical errors .",
    "it will require care and hard work to reduce the systematic errors in the systematic limited analyses .",
    "in the following , i will discuss a few analyses that we can expect to see significant progress in the near future :    * michel parameters : we can expect significant improvement in the measurement of the michel parameters with the much larger data samples . in particular , the measurement of the low - energy parameter @xmath64 will be greatly improved .",
    "as the name implied , the biggest sensitivity to this parameter is at low lepton energy and the parameter can only be measured in the muon decay channel because of the helicity flipping factor @xmath65 for the daughter charged lepton in eq .",
    "( 12 ) as discussed in section 3 .",
    "the cleo experiment can only identify muons with momentum above 1 gev .",
    "the muon detector of babar , for example , can identify muons with momentum as low as 0.6 gev , greatly increasing the sensitivity to @xmath64 .",
    "* cabbibo - suppressed decays : the single most important difference between the cleo  ii and b - factory detectors is the addition of an excellent kaon identification system .",
    "this will allow precision measurements of major kaon channels and observation of new rare kaon modes , reminiscence of the advance in the study of decays with @xmath264 and @xmath64 s provided by the csi calorimeter of the cleo  ii detector .",
    "* second class current : observation of the second class current decay @xmath265 is one of the major goals of @xmath0 physics of the b - factory experiments .",
    "the branching fraction of the decay is expected to be @xmath266  @xcite .",
    "the upper limit on the branching fraction as extracted by the cleo  ii experiment  @xcite is @xmath267 at 95% cl . in the analysis , the major background with an @xmath64 signal is from the hadronic events ( @xmath268 ) and the decays @xmath269 and @xmath270 .",
    "the latter decay has the smallest contribution and can be easily eliminated with the excellent kaon identification capacity .",
    "the other two backgrounds can be suppressed with a much tighter photon veto .",
    "this selection criterion was not imposed in the cleo  ii analysis because the analysis was designed to study the decay @xmath271 which had a different background contamination .",
    "the second class current decay can therefore be observed in the near future . * @xmath5 mass : the atmospheric @xmath6 deficit observed by super - kamiokande favors the solution of @xmath7 oscillation with @xmath226 .",
    "since the upper limit on the @xmath6 mass is 0.19  mev at the 90% cl  @xcite , this implies that the @xmath5 mass must also be less than 0.19  mev , beyond the sensitivity of any b - factory experiment .",
    "however , as discussed in section 9 , the confirmation of the @xmath7 oscillation hypothesis with the detection of @xmath5 appearance will have to wait until the year 2005 .",
    "the experimenters should therefore continue to measure the @xmath5 mass with the much larger data sample . with the excellent kaon identification",
    ", the use of kaon decay modes such as @xmath272 and @xmath273 could greatly enhance the sensitivity .",

    "the neutral partner of the @xmath0 lepton , @xmath5 , on the other hand , points to physics beyond the standard model via the observation of @xmath7 oscillation .",
    "this implies the violation of lepton number conservation , a fundamental assumption of the standard model .",
    "this challenge to the standard model needs to be confirmed with the direct observation of @xmath5 appearance in an @xmath6 beam , an observation that is now proven to be possible by the direct observation of @xmath5 by donut .",
