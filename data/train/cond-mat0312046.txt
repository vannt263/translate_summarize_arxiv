    "certain matrix functions - the green s function , the density matrix , and the logarithm - are very important to science and engineering . where they are important ,",
    "scientists are faced with a computational bottleneck : evaluation of a matrix function generally requires @xmath2 time , where @xmath1 is the basis size and usually scales linearly or worse with the system volume .",
    "this prohibits computations of large systems , even with modern computers .",
    "in particular , if a matrix function must be recalculated at every step of a system s evolution in time , then calculations with a basis size larger than @xmath3 are not practical .    in 1991",
    "w. yang introduced the divide and conquer algorithm , which approximated a matrix function in @xmath0 time@xcite .",
    "this stimulated the development of many other @xmath0 algorithms @xcite which have met considerable success , permitting for instance quantum dynamics calculations of tens of thousands of atoms .",
    "all @xmath0 algorithms rely on special characteristics of the system under study , and the question of their validity can be answered only after having specified that system . to date ,",
    "theoretical studies of the validity of these algorithms have occurred almost exclusively within the conceptual framework of ordered systems , using ideas of metals , insulators , and band gaps@xcite . in this paper",
    "i carefully examine the applicability of @xmath0 algorithms to disordered systems .",
    "i calculate a matrix function in two ways : with an @xmath0 algorithm , and via diagonalization .",
    "comparison of the two results provides some new insight into when disorder can make @xmath0 calculations feasible .",
    "this paper begins by introducing @xmath0 algorithms ( section 2 ) and then explaining how to measure the errors which these algorithms induce ( section 3 . ) section 4 introduces disordered systems and the density matrix function , while section 5 gives theoretical estimates of @xmath0 errors .",
    "i present my numerical results in section 6 , and finish in section 7 with a short assessment of their reliability .",
    "all @xmath0 algorithms make three basic assumptions :    * existence of a preferred , local basis .",
    "it is assumed that the system is best described in terms of a localized basis set .",
    "i here define a basis as localized if for any basis element @xmath4 , only a small number of positions @xmath5 satisfy @xmath6 . *",
    "existence of a distance metric .",
    "there must be a way of computing the physical distance between any two basis elements @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "* locality of both the matrix function and its argument .",
    "i call a matrix @xmath9 local if , for every pair of basis elements @xmath10 and @xmath11 that are far apart , @xmath12 . throughout this article",
    "i choose a simple criterion for being far apart : comparison with a radius @xmath13 .",
    "there are a number of ways for an @xmath0 algorithm to exploit the three basic assumptions . in this article",
    "i focus on the class of algorithms based on basis truncation .",
    "this class includes yang s divide and conquer algorithm@xcite , the `` locally self - consistent multiple scattering '' algorithm@xcite , and goedecker s `` chebychev fermi operator expansion''@xcite , which i will henceforth call the goedecker algorithm .",
    "basis truncation algorithms break the matrix function into spatially separated pieces . given the position of a particular piece",
    ", the basis is truncated to include only elements close to that position , and then the matrix function is calculated within the truncated basis .",
    "thus , for any generic matrix function @xmath14 , a basis truncation algorithm calculates @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is a projection operator truncating all basis elements far from @xmath5 , @xmath17 .",
    "there may be also an additional step of interpolating results obtained with different @xmath18 s , but i will ignore this . in this paper",
    "i choose @xmath18 to be independent of the left index @xmath5 , and truncate all basis elements outside a sphere of radius @xmath13 centered at @xmath17 .",
    "basis truncation algorithms vary only in their choice of how to evaluate the function @xmath19 .",
    "specifically , yang s algorithm calculates @xmath20 in terms of the argument s eigenvectors , the goedecker algorithm does a chebyshev expansion of @xmath20 , and the `` locally self - consistent multiple scattering '' algorithm calculates the argument s resolvent or green s function and then obtains @xmath20 via complex integration .",
    "because these approaches are all mathematically equivalent when applied to analytic functions , they should all converge to identical results , as long as one makes identical choices of which matrix function to evaluate , of how to break up the function , of which projection operator to use , and of a possible interpolation scheme .",
    "moreover , given an identical choice of matrix function , variations in the other choices should obtain results that are qualitatively the same . in this paper",
    "i use the goedecker algorithm , but i want to emphasize that the results obtained here apply to the whole class of basis truncation algorithms .    the goedecker algorithm is essentially a chebyshev expansion of the matrix function . as long as all the eigenvalues of the argument @xmath21 are between @xmath22 and @xmath23 , a matrix function may be expanded in a series of chebyshev polynomials of @xmath21 : @xmath24 .",
    "the coefficients @xmath25 are independent of the basis size , and therefore can be calculated numerically in the scalar case .",
    "the chebyshev polynomials can be calculated in @xmath0 time using the recursion relation @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 = 1 .",
    "( of course , one must also bound the highest and lowest eigenvalues of @xmath21 and then normalize . in practice",
    "very simple heuristics are sufficient for estimating these bounds . )",
    "if the matrix function @xmath14 has a characteristic scale of variation @xmath29 , then the error induced by the chebyshev expansion is controlled by an exponential with argument of order @xmath30 .",
    "previous efforts to test numerically the accuracy of @xmath0 algorithms have been confined to evaluations of whether the overall physical predictions are reasonable , and tests of convergence with respect to the localization radius @xmath13 and any other parameters .",
    "in contrast , in this paper i compute a matrix function using both an @xmath0 algorithm and an algorithm based on diagonalization , and then compare the results .    this careful comparison required development of a metric for comparing two matrices .",
    "first , note that the dot product used for comparing two vectors can be easily generalized to matrices : @xmath31 if @xmath32 , this matrix dot product is just square of the frobenius norm , one of the traditional norms for matrices .",
    "note also that matrix dot product is invariant under change of basis .",
    "moreover , it is simple to show that @xmath33 , so one may define the angle @xmath34 between two matrices as the arcsin of this quantity . bowler and gillan@xcite justified this , showing that the concept of perpendicular and parallel matrices is valid and useful .    however the matrix dot product is not quite suited to my needs .",
    "@xmath0 algorithms have a preferred , local basis , and thus are not well matched by a basis invariant measure .",
    "moreover , the matrix functions which they compute are expected to agree best with the exact matrix functions close to the diagonal , and to agree not at all outside the truncation radius .",
    "therefore , a more sensitive metric is needed , one that distinguishes different distances from the diagonal .",
    "i define the partial matrix dot product as :    @xmath35    the argument @xmath5 of this dot product allows me to obtain information about agreement at displacement @xmath5 from the diagonal .",
    "it is still valid to call this a dot product , because the magnitude of @xmath36 is bounded by one , and thus one can compute a displacement - dependent angle @xmath37 and relative magnitude @xmath38 .",
    "the partial matrix dot product has a simple sum rule relating it to the full matrix dot product : @xmath39 .    in my results",
    "i actually compute another dot product , an angular average @xmath40 over all @xmath5 satisfying @xmath41 .",
    "in this paper i restrict my attention to a single matrix function , the density matrix .",
    "this function is very important in quantum calculations of electronic structure in atoms and molecules , where its argument is the system s hamiltonian , its diagonal elements describe the charge density , and its off - diagonal elements are used to compute forces on the atoms .",
    "eigenvalues of the hamiltonian give the energies of their corresponding electronic states , and i will use the words eigenvalue and energy interchangeably throughout the rest of this paper .",
    "the density matrix function @xmath42 is basically a projection operator which deletes eigenvectors having energy @xmath43 larger than the fermi level @xmath44 . here",
    "i use the following form : @xmath45 for physical reasons , it is not quite a projection operator : it has a transition region around @xmath44 of width proportional to the temperature @xmath46 where its eigenvalues interpolate between @xmath47 and @xmath22 . the error induced by a chebyshev expansion",
    "is controlled by an exponential with argument proportional to @xmath48 , where @xmath49 is the size of the energy band and @xmath50 is the number of terms in the chebyshev expansion@xcite .",
    "the density matrix is well suited to @xmath0 algorithms .",
    "as @xmath44 becomes large , it converges to the identity .",
    "moreover , it is invariant under unitary transformations acting on the set of eigenvectors with energies below the fermi level@xcite .",
    "even when the hamiltonian s eigenvectors are not a local basis set , often a unitary transformation can be found which maps them to a basis which is localized . if such a transformation exists , the density matrix is localized .",
    "several papers have examined density matrix locality in the context of ordered systems ; i.e. ones whose hamiltonians possess lattice translational invariance@xcite .",
    "( lattice translational invariance can be expressed quantitatively as @xmath51 for all @xmath52 located on an infinitely extended lattice . )",
    "it is well known that the eigenvalues of such systems are arranged in bands separated by energy gaps where there are no eigenvalues , and that the eigenvectors are extended through all space .",
    "notwithstanding the nonlocality of the eigenvectors , there are strong arguments for localization in all ordered systems .",
    "if the system is metallic ( meaning that the fermi level lies in one of the bands of eigenvalues ) and the temperature is zero , then in a three - dimensional system the density matrix is expected to fall off asymptotically as @xmath53 , where @xmath13 is the spatial distance from the diagonal . a non - zero temperature multiplies this by an exponential decay .",
    "if instead the system is an insulator , then the density matrix should decay exponentially even at @xmath54 .",
    "most systems of physical interest do not exhibit lattice translational symmetry .",
    "in particular , many exhibit inhomogeneities at scales much smaller than that of the system itself . these are termed disordered systems . in this article",
    "i study the prototypical disordered system , the anderson model@xcite .",
    "it describes a basis laid out on a cubic lattice , one basis element per lattice site , and a very simple symmetric hamiltonian matrix @xmath21 composed of two parts :    * a regular part : @xmath55 if @xmath5 and @xmath17 are nearest neighbors on the lattice .",
    "this term is , up to a constant , just the second order discretization of the laplacian ; its spectrum consists of a single band of energies between @xmath56 and @xmath57 , where @xmath58 is the spatial dimensionality of the lattice . * a disordered part : diagonal elements @xmath59 have random values chosen according to some probability distribution . in this article",
    "i choose to use the gaussian distribution @xmath60 i call @xmath61 the disorder strength ; this is related to the disorder strength used in the literature by a factor of @xmath62@xcite .    at small disorder strengths ,",
    "the anderson model is dominated by its regular part ; in particular the eigenvectors are extended throughout the whole system volume .",
    "however , there is a small but important departure from the ordered behavior : at the band edges one finds a few eigenvectors with volumes much smaller than the system volume .",
    "in fact , there is an energy @xmath63 such that any eigenvector with eigenvalue @xmath43 satisfying @xmath64 is localized . on average these eigenvectors decay exponentially with the spatial distance from their maximum@xcite .",
    "as the disorder strength is increased , @xmath63 gets smaller and smaller ; i.e. more and more of the energy band becomes localized . at a critical disorder strength",
    "the whole energy band becomes localized .",
    "this phenomenon is called the anderson transition ; for the gaussian probability distribution used in this paper it occurs at the critical disorder @xmath65@xcite .",
    "note that these statements must all be understood as regarding the ensemble of hamiltonians determined by the probabilistic distribution of the disorder : for instance , i am stating that above the critical disorder the subset of hamiltonians with unlocalized eigenvectors is vanishingly small compared to the total ensemble size .",
    "moreover , these statements are valid for an infinite lattice ; the mapping to computations on a finite lattice is not always absolutely clear .",
    "studies of the locality of disordered systems have traditionally concentrated on computations of the green s function , not the density matrix .",
    "it is expected that the average of the green s function should decay exponentially as @xmath66 , where @xmath67 is called the coherence length@xcite .",
    "the density matrix , as we will see , is closely related to the green s function , so one may hope that its average will also decay exponentially .",
    "however , there are two reasons why this hope may be unjustified : first , we do not need to know whether the average of all density matrices is localized , but instead whether each individual density matrix is localized .",
    "the difference between the two could be significant .",
    "second , in a system below the critical disorder there will be unlocalized eigenvectors , and one might therefore expect the @xmath53 behavior typical of a metal .",
    "many @xmath0 computations have treated systems which are disordered@xcite .",
    "however , the @xmath0 literature contains little theoretical material about the applicability of @xmath0 algorithms to disordered systems .",
    "the originators of the `` locally self - consistent green s function '' algorithm , which does not truncate the basis but instead does a sort of averaging outside of a radius @xmath68 , suggested that @xmath68 should be related to the coherence length@xcite , and also to the error induced by their averaging@xcite .",
    "zhang and drabold computed the density matrix of amorphous silicon using exact diagonalization and found an exponential decay@xcite . in the next sections , i will first argue theoretically and then show numerically that @xmath0 basis truncation algorithms are applicable to disordered systems , including ones far below the anderson transition .",
    "the quantity of interest is the relative error , @xmath69 where @xmath13 is the radius of the truncation volume and @xmath70 is the difference between the exact matrix function @xmath20 and the approximate matrix function @xmath71 .",
    "a first guess can be made from the intuition that the absolute error @xmath72 is probably bounded by its value at the boundary of the truncation region .",
    "this allows a rough estimate of the relative error : @xmath73 , suggesting that it can be made arbitrarily small if the matrix function is localized .",
    "the numerator , however , is left undefined .",
    "perhaps it is reasonable to assume that on the boundary the absolute error is equal to the approximate matrix function , giving :    @xmath74    the following paragraphs develop further insight into the absolute error by resolving @xmath70 into a multiple sum over dot products between the argument s eigenstates @xmath75 and position eigenstates @xmath76 .",
    "knowledge of the normalization and asymptotic behavior of these states shed some light on the magnitude of the matrix elements of the error : @xmath77 .",
    "basis truncation algorithms separate the basis into two projection operators , @xmath78 for the part inside the localization cutoff @xmath13 , and @xmath79 for the part outside @xmath13 . @xmath78 and @xmath79 are then used to divide the argument @xmath21 into two parts : a part @xmath80 which leaves @xmath9 and @xmath81 disconnected , and a boundary term connecting @xmath9 and @xmath81 , @xmath82 .",
    "the final result of a basis truncation algorithm is just @xmath83 .",
    "therefore , the error induced by a basis truncation algorithm is entirely due to the boundary term @xmath84 . in other words , @xmath85 .    for matrix functions which are analytic on a region of the complex plane which contains the poles of @xmath21 and @xmath86 ,",
    "an exact equation for this boundary effect can be easily derived from the dyson equation .",
    "first define the green s functions @xmath87 , @xmath88 . then note that the matrix function can be obtained from the green s function through contour integration over the complex energy @xmath43 : @xmath89 , where the complex integral must contain the poles of @xmath21 .",
    "next , apply the dyson equation @xmath90 twice to obtain : @xmath91 this gives an exact relation between the correct green s function @xmath92 of the untruncated argument @xmath93 and the green s function @xmath94 of the truncated argument @xmath86 . in order to obtain a similar relation for the matrix function @xmath20",
    ", one must make the poles in this expression explicit and then do a complex integration .",
    "define @xmath95 and @xmath96 as two eigenvectors of @xmath86 which are both located inside of the localization region , the set of @xmath97 as the complete set of eigenvectors of @xmath21 , and @xmath98 , @xmath99 , and @xmath100 as their respective energies . then :    @xmath101    where    @xmath102    @xmath103 is the spectral density @xmath104 and is often approximated as a continuous function .",
    "similarly , @xmath105 is the spectral density of the eigenstates of @xmath86 which are located inside the truncation region .",
    "if the matrix elements and matrix function are well - behaved , then this integral is also well - behaved .",
    "consider the integral @xmath106 .",
    "when @xmath20 is the density matrix and one uses a simple model with @xmath107 equal to a constant @xmath108 inside the energy band @xmath109 $ ] , this integral is of order @xmath110 when @xmath44 is inside the energy band and @xmath47 when it is outside the band .",
    "assuming that all eigenvectors of both @xmath21 and @xmath86 are unlocalized , one can use eq .",
    "[ eqexpand ] to derive an upper bound on @xmath111 of order @xmath112 . in the case of the density matrix",
    "this is a gross overestimate . nonetheless eq .",
    "[ eqexpand ] can teach three lessons :      suppose that all the eigenvectors are bounded by @xmath113 , where @xmath114 is the origin of the eigenvector and @xmath115 is the minimum decay length of the system",
    ". then one can use eq .",
    "[ eqexpand ] to prove that @xmath116 is bounded by a polynomial times @xmath117 for large @xmath13 , that the absolute error @xmath118 is bounded by a polynomial times @xmath119 , and that the relative error can be made arbitrarily small .",
    "this suggests that in localized systems the absolute error @xmath118 depends exponentially on @xmath68 .",
    "if so , then eq . [ roughestimate1 ] is a gross overestimate .",
    "if the eigenvectors are unlocalized , then the magnitudes of @xmath120 and @xmath121 have no strong dependence on @xmath5 and @xmath122 .",
    "this suggests that @xmath123 is roughly independent of the position , and that @xmath124 is roughly independent of @xmath68 , thus providing partial justification of eq .",
    "[ roughestimate1 ] .",
    "[ eqexpand ] suggests that in systems with a finite coherence length @xmath125 the absolute error is reduced , via reduction of the matrix elements @xmath126 and @xmath127 .",
    "i assume a very crude model of the incoherence where the eigenvectors are broken into domains with constant phase , each domain of size @xmath128 .",
    "the main effect is to decrease any integral over an eigenvector by a factor of @xmath129 , where @xmath130 is the number of different domains where the integrand is non - zero .",
    "@xmath84 touches about @xmath131 such domains . therefore if @xmath132 , @xmath133 and @xmath134 .",
    "analytic calculations of the second moment of the matrix element confirm the same scaling law .",
    "i studied ensembles of anderson hamiltonians at eleven disorder values between @xmath135 and @xmath136 , including the critical disorder @xmath137 . in the results presented here a truncation radius of @xmath138",
    "was used , but the results are qualitatively similar to those obtained with @xmath139 .",
    "a lattice size of @xmath140 was used , and calculations with @xmath141 and @xmath142 lattices at the critical disorder @xmath143 indicate that finite size effects are small .",
    "the largest such effect is an improvement of the basis truncation algorithm s accuracy at smaller lattice volumes . at each disorder",
    "i calculated the density matrix at @xmath144 values of the fermi level @xmath44 ranging uniformly from @xmath145 to @xmath146 , which covered the whole energy band at the lower disorders , and most of it even at larger disorders .",
    "close to the edges of the energy band the density matrix magnitude drops precipitously and the other observables also change rapidly ; the main results reported here apply only to values of @xmath44 where the spectral density remains high .    a low temperature ( @xmath147 )",
    "was chosen in order to minimize any temperature effect . a careful examination of the density matrix s behavior at @xmath148 showed that any temperature effect was swamped by other effects .",
    "in particular , at low disorder the density matrix s behavior is dominated by lattice effects .",
    "because of the low temperature a large number of chebyshev terms was needed ; for each matrix i used a number of terms @xmath50 equal to @xmath149 times the total band width , which was enough to make the truncation error quite small .",

    "the first is the inverse of the first participation ratio ; i.e. @xmath165 .",
    "this quantity is a lattice friendly measure of volume because it has a minimum value of one when @xmath166 is a delta function and a maximum value of the system size when @xmath167 is a constant .",

    "my second volume measure is based on the second moment : @xmath170 , where @xmath171 is the second moment ( or quadrupole tensor ) of @xmath172 .",
    "unlike the first volume measure , this measure remains large even at large disorders , indicating that each eigenfunction consists of several isolated peaks scattered throughout the system volume .",
    "this structure is caused by the fact that states with similar energies will mix even if they are connected by exponentially small matrix elements .",
    "however , mixing caused by such small matrix elements does not influence the density matrix , because it essentially just induces a unitary transformation of the mixed eigenvectors , and as we know the density matrix is invariant under unitary transformations between states that are all either less than @xmath44 or more than @xmath44 .",

    "i have taken steps to manage both issues :      all results presented here were obtained from ensembles of @xmath201 realizations , but repeating the calculations with ensembles of @xmath202 realizations yielded the same results . at the critical disorder the same quantities were computed with three different lattice sizes ( @xmath202 realizations at both @xmath141 and @xmath140 , and @xmath180 realizations at @xmath142 ) , and the agreement is very good .",
    "graphing any quantity across several disorders , one immediately notices that there is little noise induced overlap of the two graphs .",
    "therefore , it seems likely that risks due to finite ensemble size are under control .",
    "i have tried very hard to reduce this risk .",
    "the software includes an automated test suite which tests all computational functions except the highest level output ( graph printing ) routines .",
    "moreover , i have taken pains to enable other researchers to easily reproduce and check my results , simply by installing my software and the libraries it depends on , compiling it with the gnu gcc compiler@xcite , and starting it running .",
    "the software , with all needed configuration files , is available under the gnu public license@xcite ; check www.sacksteder.com for further details .",
    "special thanks to my advisor , giorgio parisi , for his attentiveness , stimulation , and encouragement .",
    "thank you also to stephan goedecker for sharing one of his @xmath0 codes , to the oxon group for sharing their code ( though it remained unused ) , and to the organizers of the 21st international workshop on numerical linear algebra and its applications for putting that event together .",

    "<S> these @xmath0 algorithms rely on assumptions about the spatial locality of the matrix function ; therefore their validity depends very much on the argument of the matrix function . in this article </S>",

    "<S> i focus on the prototypical disordered system , the anderson model . </S>",
    "<S> i find that @xmath0 algorithms for the density matrix function can be used well below the anderson transition ( i.e. in the metallic phase ; ) they fail only when the coherence length becomes large . </S>",
    "<S> this paper also includes some experimental results about the anderson model s behavior across a range of disorders . </S>"
