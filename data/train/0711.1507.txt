    "in the absence of fundamental framework for non - equilibrium systems , one - dimensional models known as asymmetric simple exclusion processes ( asep ) , where particles interact via an exclusion potential and hop along discrete lattices , have become important tools and references for understanding complex phenomena in chemistry , physics and biology @xcite .",
    "aseps now are playing a role similar to the one the ising model has in the studies of equilibrium systems @xcite .",
    "asymmetric exclusion processes have been applied successfully to analyze the kinetics of biopolymerization @xcite , protein synthesis @xcite , molecular transport through nanopores and channels @xcite , the motion of motor proteins along cytoskeleton filaments @xcite , growth of fungal filaments @xcite , and different aspects of car traffic processes @xcite .",
    "many non - equilibrium phenomena can be reasonable well described by a single - channel exclusion models .",
    "however , the necessity to analyze more realistic complex phenomena , that involve the transport along the parallel coupled lattices and existence of internal states , e.g. for motor proteins , vehicular traffic and hopping of quantum dots , stimulated the development of multi - channel aseps @xcite . in these models particle can move along their lattice and they also can transfer between the channels . leading to complex dynamic behavior . theoretical analysis of multi - channel exclusion processes indicates that a coupling between channels has a strong effect on particle dynamics and stationary - state properties , and it also leads to several unusual phenomena , such as localized domain walls @xcite .",
    "dynamics of many non - equilibrium systems is strongly modified by the presence of inhomogeneities and defects .",
    "for example , it is known that in the protein synthesis the elongation rate of ribosomes is not uniform due to slow codon sites on rna molecules @xcite .",
    "the effect of local inhomogeneities have been already investigated for different aseps on single - chain lattices @xcite . however , for multi - channel aseps mostly homogeneous systems have been considered .",
    "the aim of the present paper is to investigate two - channel aseps with inhomogeneous coupling between the lattices .",
    "specifically , we analyze the simplest case when two channels are coupled at the single lattice site far away from the boundaries , and two different cases , symmetric and asymmetric couplings , are considered .",
    "the problem is motivated by the cellular transport of motor proteins that move along parallel protofilaments along microtubules @xcite .",
    "occasionally , motor proteins may jump between the chains , especially in the presence of structural defects in the original protofilament . in our study",
    "we use a simple approximate model for theoretical calculations of stationary - state properties and phase diagrams , and we test our predictions by utilizing extensive monte - carlo simulations .    the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we give a detailed description of the model , briefly present known results for single - chain aseps , and develop an approximate theory for asymmetric exclusion processes involving two channels connected by a single cluster far away from the boundaries where particles can transfer with symmetric or asymmetric rates between the lattices . in section 3",
    "we present and discuss monte - carlo computer simulation results and compare them with theoretical predictions . finally , in section 4 we summarize and conclude .",
    "we consider identical particles that move on two parallel one - dimensional lattices as illustrated in figure 1 .",
    "two channels are identical and they have @xmath0 sites .",
    "the particles interact via hard - core exclusion potential : each site is either empty or occupied by a single particle .",
    "the dynamics of the system is random - sequential , i.e. , at each time step we randomly choose a site on one lattice to follow its dynamics .",
    "particles can enter the system from the left with the rate @xmath1 if any of the first sites in either lattice are empty .",
    "particles that reach the final site in either lattice can leave the system with the rate @xmath2 . in the bulk of the system particles move from the site @xmath3 to the site @xmath4 on the same lattice with the rate 1 if the next site is available . however , dynamic rules are different at the special site @xmath5 : see figure 1 . a particle at this site on the first lattice can move vertically to the site @xmath5 on the second lattice with the rate @xmath6 if the corresponding site is empty , or it can hop to the right empty site with the rate @xmath7 . however , if the site @xmath5 in the second channel is occupied , the particle jumps in the horizontal direction to the right with the rate 1 if the forward site is available",
    ". the total transition rate out of this defect site is equal to one .",
    "similarly , the particle on the site @xmath5 on the second lattice can hop vertically with the rate @xmath8 if the upper site is free , or it can move horizontally with the rate @xmath9 if the forward right site is not occupied .",
    "otherwise , it will move to the right neighboring site with the rate 1 , assuming again that the forward site is available .",
    "when the transition rates between the channels are equal ( @xmath10 ) the coupling is symmetric , while for @xmath11 the coupling between the lattices is asymmetric .",
    "both cases of two - channel aseps with inhomogeneous coupling are analyzed separately .     and",
    "allowed transitions are shown by arrows .",
    "entrance rates at both lattices are equal to @xmath12 and exit rates are equal to @xmath13 . ]",
    "if the inter - channel hopping rates are equal to zero ( @xmath14 ) then we have two independent single - lane aseps for which exact solutions for all dynamic properties are already known @xcite .",
    "there are three stationary - state phases . for large entrance and exit rates , @xmath15 and @xmath16",
    ", the single - lane asep is found to be in a maximal current ( mc ) phase where the stationary current and bulk density are given by @xmath17 for @xmath18 and @xmath19 the dynamics is determined by the entrance process and we have a low - density ( ld ) phase where the particle current and the bulk density are @xmath20 finally , for @xmath21 and @xmath22 the exiting is a rate - limiting process , and the single - chain asep is in a high - density ( hd ) phase where @xmath23    several approximate theoretical approaches have been developed for investigation of multi - channel aseps @xcite .",
    "however , probably the closest description of non - equilibrium dynamics , as judged by comparison with monte carlo computer simulations , is obtained in the mean - field model that have exact treatment of the vertical transitions between the channels @xcite .",
    "we adopt this strategy to analyze the inhomogeneous coupling in two - channel aseps .",
    "the dynamics at the coupling cluster can be specified by introducing functions @xmath24 ( @xmath25 ) that define the probability that the vertical cluster is empty ( @xmath26 ) , partially occupied [ @xmath27 or @xmath28 if the occupied site is on the lane 1 or 2 , respectively ] , or fully occupied ( @xmath29 ) .",
    "these probabilities are related via a normalization condition @xmath30 in the presented analysis we calculate only bulk densities in all phases , however , our analysis can be easily applied to obtain full density profiles utilizing known results @xcite .",
    "let us consider the case of the symmetric coupling when the vertical transitions rates are equal .",
    "as can be seen from figure 1 , the vertical coupling cluster divides the two - channel inhomogeneous system into four homogeneous horizontal segments .",
    "each of these segments can be viewed as a single - lane asep that are connected with the vertical junction cluster , as shown in figure 2 .",
    "we label left segments in the first and second channels as 1l and 2l , respectively .",
    "the particles enter these segments with the rate @xmath12 and leave them with an effective rate @xmath31 . similarly ,",
    "1r and 2r describe the corresponding right segments with entrance and exit rates given by @xmath32 and @xmath13 : see figure 2 . because of the symmetry , the probability to have the partially filled vertical cluster with the particle on lane 1 or 2 is the same , @xmath33 , which modifies the normalization condition , @xmath34 thus dynamics in four segments and in the vertical cluster is treated exactly , but correlations between different parts are neglected .",
    "it is instructive to analyze first the simplest case of strong symmetric coupling when @xmath35 .",
    "it can be shown that it is not possible to have a completely empty vertical cluster in the large - time limit , i.e. , @xmath36 .",
    "the vertical configuration @xmath37 can only be obtained from the partially filled cluster by particles leaving to segments 2l and and 2r .",
    "however , the first particle to reach the junction cluster will hop vertically from one defect site to the other constantly until another particle arrives to completely fill the cluster .",
    "there is no possibility for creating empty vertical cluster .",
    "then from the normalization condition ( [ norm_sym ] ) one obtains , @xmath38    because from the vertical cluster particles can leave to the right part of the system only from the completely filled configuration , the effective rate to enter the segments 1r and 2r can be easily expressed in terms of the properties of the junction cluster , @xmath39 the effective exit rates from the left segments can also be found using similar arguments : the particle can leave the segment 1l or 2l to the right if the vertical cluster is in the partially filled configuration , leading us to the following expression , @xmath40 this result has important consequences on the particle dynamics in the system . since @xmath41 the maximal - current phase can not be realized in the left segments .",
    "symmetry and conservation of the particle current also require that @xmath42 i.e. , fluxes through all segments are equal . using the notation ( @xmath43,@xmath44 ) , where @xmath43 and @xmath44 denote the phase of the left and right segments respectively ,",
    "we conclude that the only possible stationary phases for this system are ( hd , hd ) , ( ld , hd ) , ( ld , ld ) and ( hd , ld ) phases .    the ( hd , hd ) phase might exist if the following conditions are satisfied , @xmath45 because the bulk densities in the left and right segments of this phase are the same , it implies that @xmath46 then from eqs .",
    "( [ a_eff ] ) and ( [ b_eff ] ) we derive that @xmath47 substituting this expression into inequalities ( [ hdhd_cond ] ) we obtain , that ( hd , hd ) phase is realized when @xmath48 similar arguments for ( ld , ld ) yield that this phase exists for @xmath49 the conditions for existence of ( hd , ld ) phase can be written in the following form , @xmath50 in this phase the stationarity of the particle current requires that @xmath51 , and utilizing eqs .",
    "( [ a_eff ] ) and ( [ b_eff ] ) it produces @xmath52 combining this result with eq .",
    "( [ hdld_cond ] ) we obtain that this phase exists only for @xmath53 it can also be shown that in this mean - field approximation that neglects the correlations between the segments the ( ld , hd ) phase correspond to the phase boundary @xmath54    in the general case of symmetric coupling between channels , when @xmath55 , the calculations become slightly more involved because the vertical configuration with both empty sites now have a nonzero probability , i.e. , @xmath56 .",
    "the expressions for the effective entrance and exit rates are modified as @xmath57 as in the case of strong symmetric coupling , the particle fluxes through all segments are the same , and it is impossible to have a maximal - current phase in the system . if mc would exist in one of the segments , than it would have to be found in all segments . this would require that @xmath58 and @xmath59 , leading to @xmath60 however , from eq .",
    "( [ rates ] ) it follows that @xmath61 which contradicts the inequality ( [ inequal ] ) .",
    "thus , our mean - field approach suggests that there are four possible stationary phases [ ( hd , hd ) , ( ld , ld ) , ( hd , ld ) and ( ld , hd ) ] in the two - channel asep with inhomogeneous symmetric coupling .",
    "let us define functions @xmath62 and @xmath63 as probabilities to find the particle at the last sites of left segments 1l and 2l respectively .",
    "similarly , @xmath64 ( @xmath65 ) gives the density at the first sites of the right segments 2l and 2r . because of the symmetry these functions are related , @xmath66 the dynamics at the vertical cluster is described at all times by the master equation , @xmath67 which at steady state reduces to @xmath68 the particle current that leaves any of the left segments can be written as @xmath69 while the flux entering any of right segments is given by @xmath70 combining eqs .",
    "( [ rates ] ) , ( [ master1 ] ) , ( [ jl ] ) and ( [ jr ] ) , we derive the expression that relates the probabilities of filled and partially filled vertical junction clusters , @xmath71 solving this equation and eliminating the unphysical solution leads us to @xmath72}-p_{11}}{1-w}.\\ ] ] then the effective entrance and exit rates can be expressed using eqs .",

    "is expected @xcite .",
    "the calculated phase diagram is also shown in figure 4 .",
    "note that for @xmath82 two channels are uncoupled and we recover the results for individual single - lattice aseps , as expected . in the limit of strong coupling ( @xmath74 )",
    "the predicted phase diagram is also agrees with the one discussed earlier .",
    "it is interesting to note that in the case of symmetric coupling the phase diagram for two - channel aseps is very similar to a phase diagram for the single - chain aseps with local inhomogeneity @xcite .",
    "the connection between two systems can be easily understood from figure 1 . in each lane",
    "the hoping rate to the right is the same at all sites except at the one that couples the channels .",
    "then the motion along each lattice can be viewed as a transport along a single - lane asep with local defect that was studied in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the dynamics in the system of two - channel aseps with inhomogeneous coupling become very complex for asymmetric vertical transition rates , i.e. , when @xmath11 . , and the symmetry between two lattices no longer exists .",
    "specifically , the densities at the last sites of the left segments and densities at the first sites of right segments are not equal : @xmath83 , and @xmath84 .",
    "to specify a state of the system we use the notation @xmath85 with @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath86 and @xmath87 corresponding to the phase in the segments 1l , 1r , 2l and 2r respectively , and each of them is able to take the values ld , hd or mc .",
    "it is convenient to view the system with the asymmetric coupling slightly differently from the symmetric case , as shown in figure 3 .",
    "segments 2l and 1r have @xmath88 sites while 1l and 2r segments are longer with @xmath5 sites .",
    "however , because we consider dynamics in the thermodynamic limit ( @xmath89 ) , the difference in the sizes does not matter and all segments still can be viewed as homogeneous single - chain asep with known stationary properties .        to simplify calculations , we consider the case of maximal asymmetry with @xmath90 and @xmath91 .",
    "our calculations can be easily generalized for general values of vertical transition rates .",
    "the particle can enter the segment 1r only when the vertical cluster is fully occupied , and it produces the following expression for the effective entrance rate , @xmath92 however , as can be seen from figure 3 , there are two ways to enter the segment 2r : from the left segment 2l and from the partially - filled vertical configuration with the probability @xmath27 . then the effective entrance in this case is equal to @xmath93 using similar arguments it can be shown that the effective exit rate from the segment 2l is given by the expression , @xmath94 while the effective rate out of 2l segment is @xmath95    the densities at the last and at the first sites of segments play important role in our analysis . they can be easily expressed in terms of the entrance and exit rates from known exact solutions for single - chain aseps @xcite . in the maximal - current phase",
    "the densities are @xmath96 the corresponding expressions for segments in the low - density regimes are equal to @xmath97 while expressions in the high - density regimes can be written as @xmath98    particle dynamics through vertical junction cluster can be described by a set of three independent master equations , @xmath99 @xmath100 @xmath101 where @xmath102 denotes the density at the site before the last one in the segment 1l and @xmath103 is the occupancy of the second site in the segment 2r : see figure 3 . at steady - state these equations",

    "in contrast , for the asymmetric coupling between the channels the currents through all segments are not necessary equal to each other , and mc phase can be found under some conditions in some segments . this leads to existence of many steady - state phases in the system .",
    "the phase diagram for the asymmetric inhomogeneous coupling is almost symmetric with respect to @xmath150 transformation .",
    "this is because the transport of particles from the left can be also viewed as a motion of holes in the opposite direction .",
    "however , as can be clearly seen from figure 5 there is a slight asymmetry in the phase diagram , and it also shows up in the dynamic properties .",
    "the deviation from the particle - hole symmetry can be explained by analyzing the dynamics at the vertical junction for the case of @xmath90 and @xmath91 , as illustrated in figure 8 .",
    "the particle at the partially filled junction cluster can only move in the vertical direction . at the same time",
    ", the hole in the partially filled cluster can move vertically _ and _ horizontally , if the particle from the 1l segments enters the cluster .",
    "thus , the corresponding dynamic rules for the particles and for the holes in the vertical cluster are not the same , and it produces the slight asymmetry in large - time properties of two - channel aseps with inhomogeneous asymmetric coupling .",
    "two - channel asymmetric simple exclusion processes with inhomogeneous coupling between the lattices have been investigated . to better describe the large - time behavior of the system a mean - field approach , that treats particle dynamics in four lattice segments and in the vertical cluster exactly while neglecting the correlations between different parts of the system , is developed . for symmetric transition rates between the channels",
    "the phase diagram is rather simple and it consists of three phases .",
    "this is a consequence of constraints on the particle fluxes due to the symmetry .",
    "the situation is very different for asymmetric coupling between the channels . here",
    "our analysis indicates that there are ten stationary phases .",
    "it is argued that this complex behavior is realized because of weaker constraints on the particle currents .",
    "our theoretical calculations are supported by extensive monte carlo computer simulations .",
    "slight deviations between theoretical results and computer simulations are only found in the phases where correlations around the junction site play important role .",
    "our theoretical calculations and computer simulations also point out to asymmetry in the properties of two - channel aseps with asymmetric coupling with the respect to the particle - hole symmetry . it is argued that this asymmetry appears due to different dynamic rules for the particles and for the holes at the vertical junction cluster .",
    "there are several extensions of this work can be proposed .",
    "two - channel aseps with homogeneous asymmetric coupling show a phase diagram with only seven phases and very different stationary properties @xcite",
    ". it will be interesting to increase the region of inhomogeneous coupling from one site to many to see how dynamics of the system changes .",
    "another interesting question that will help to understand mechanisms of asymmetric exclusion processes is how far coupling clusters should be put in order to feel each other .",
    "in addition , the analysis can be extended to transport of extended particles @xcite .",
