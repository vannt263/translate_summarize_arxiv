    "the method of the radiative return , i.e. the study of events with initial state radiation ( isr ) at electron - positron colliders , allows to measure the hadronic cross section over a wide range of energies in a single experiment , without changing the beam energy .",
    "originally suggested already long time ago @xcite , the idea has been revived in @xcite , after high luminosity electron - positron colliders , specifically @xmath0- and @xmath4-meson factories , came into operation .",
    "already now the method has been used to study the pion form factor at daphne @xcite and the production of @xmath5 @xcite and of @xmath6 at babar @xcite .",
    "it relies on the factorization into a part describing the production of the virtual photon from the initial state ( including radiative corrections ) and a part describing the production of hadrons from the virtual photon , which essentially corresponds to the cross section for @xmath7 .",
    "this important feature is affected by contributions from the emission of photons from the final state ( fsr ) . as discussed in @xcite ,",
    "suitable kinematic cuts can be chosen , which strongly reduce these effects in @xmath8 .",
    "for @xmath4-meson factories , configurations with hadrons of low invariant mass in one hemisphere and a hard photon in the opposite hemisphere are completely dominated by isr , with a small admixture from the `` two step '' process @xmath9 .",
    "the situation is more involved at the @xmath0-factory daphne . for photons at small angles with respect to the beam direction and",
    "centrally produced pions , isr is again dominant .",
    "this is the kinematic region studied in @xcite for a measurement of the pion form factor . in general",
    ", however , fsr will be more important at these low energies .",
    "unavoidably , the input for any fsr analysis and monte carlo simulation will be model dependent and a careful experimental test of the model assumptions is required .",
    "the most recent and detailed analysis of this problem @xcite has been performed with the monte carlo event generator phokhara @xcite , where fsr for pions is modeled by scalar qed ( sqed ) ( a different ansatz , leading to similar conclusions is presented in @xcite ) .",
    "this ansatz is certainly adequate for most of the kinematic regions and for cms energies away from the @xmath0 resonance . for @xmath10 gev , on top of the @xmath0-resonance ,",
    "an additional complication arises : the presence of the narrow @xmath0-resonance leads to an enhancement of @xmath1 final states through radiative @xmath0-decays into ( dominantly scalar ) resonances .",
    "this process is important in itself and has , for many years , been the subject of theoretical investigations ( see @xcite and references therein ) , where the decay chain @xmath11 is generally assumed to dominate .",
    "first investigations , where this channel has been linked to the radiative return , have been published in @xcite .",
    "two distinct features allow to discriminate the radiative @xmath0 decay from @xmath1 production through the radiative return on one hand and from fsr from charged pions on the other hand : radiative @xmath0 decays to @xmath12 will lead to @xmath2 and @xmath13 states with a relative weight 2:1 ; this is in contrast to fsr from pions , which , similarly to isr , leads by construction to @xmath2 only .",
    "fsr is , furthermore , strongly enhanced for photons collinear to the pions . a second important feature , which will be the main subject of this paper , is the charge asymmetry .",
    "it arises from the interference between isr with @xmath14 in an odd charge conjugate state , and fsr and radiative @xmath0 decays , with @xmath14 in an even charge conjugate state . with",
    "the isr amplitude being already fairly well determined , this interference will allow to pin down size and even the relative phase of the @xmath15 amplitude in a model independent way . as a third possibility the dependence of all this distributions on the cms energy and the energy dependent relative importance of @xmath0 and continuum amplitude could be used .",
    "however , we will not dwell further on this last , fairly obvious , aspect .",
    "the subsequent analysis will not attempt to study the most general amplitude for the radiative @xmath0 decay .",
    "instead we will use characteristic models with different resonance admixture and variable phases and demonstrate that these will lead to marked differences in the charge asymmetry .    for definiteness ,",
    "we have adopted two models describing @xmath16 decays ( @xmath17 stands for both neutral and charged modes ) , used also in @xcite : the `` no structure model '' of @xcite and the @xmath18 model of @xcite .",
    "the models were extended to include both @xmath19 and @xmath20 ( @xmath21 ) intermediate states in the decay chain @xmath11 , an extension required to fit experiments @xcite .",
    "more sophisticated version of the @xmath18 model , incorporating also the complete @xmath22 mixing matrix , can be found in @xcite .",
    "contributions from the @xmath23 decay chain are not taken into account .",
    "indeed kloe data @xcite show , that they are negligible for the @xmath13 final state .",
    "the branching ratios br(@xmath24 ) and br(@xmath25 ) are comparable @xcite , hence the same applies to the @xmath2 final state .    at present",
    "this choice of models is not based on definite experimental information , which is still quite poor , but on their simplicity . to discriminate between different models , more experimental work is needed . however , as shown in the next section , a lot can be learned from studies of charge and charge induced asymmetries .",
    "the amplitude for fsr based on sqed , denoted @xmath26 , is identical to the one used in phokhara and is given by @xmath27    the nlo correction to fsr and the complete description of isr , including nlo corrections , is also identical to the one used in phokhara and described in @xcite .",
    "the pion form factor @xmath28 is taken from @xcite .",
    "for the sake of definiteness , we write down explicitely the amplitude @xmath29 for @xmath11    @xmath30    which , when combined with @xmath0 production , describes the resonant process @xmath31 with the amplitude    @xmath32    here @xmath33 ( @xmath34 ) and @xmath35 ( @xmath36 ) are @xmath0 and photon four momenta ( polarization vectors ) respectively . @xmath37 in the case of @xmath38 annihilation amplitudes , @xmath39 ( @xmath40 ) is the @xmath41 ( @xmath42 ) four momentum and @xmath43 .",
    "@xmath44 denotes @xmath0 mass and @xmath45 its width .",
    "unless stated otherwise , all numerical values of physical parameters are taken from @xcite .",
    "the @xmath46 coupling , deduced from @xmath47 , is @xmath48 gev@xmath49 .",
    "the phase @xmath50 in @xmath51 becomes relevant for the interference between @xmath51 and both @xmath26 and isr amplitudes and thus can be measured for charged pions .",
    "it is kept constant in the ` no structure ' model . in the case of the @xmath18 model it is taken from @xcite : @xmath52 , with @xmath53 ( thus also constant for fixed @xmath54 ) .",
    "the function @xmath55 reads    @xmath56",
    "in the ` no structure ' model , and    @xmath57 \\ , \\label{fphikk}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    in the @xmath18 model .",
    "the meaning of the three - particle couplings @xmath58 is self - explanatory and , assuming isospin symmetry , these couplings are identical for charged and neutral pion modes . @xmath59 and @xmath60 ( @xmath61 and @xmath62 ) are the mass and the width of @xmath19 ( @xmath20 ) . again for simplicity , we use constant widths for both resonances .",
    "the phase @xmath63 has to be substantially different from zero to fit the experimental data @xcite ( see below ) .",
    "@xmath64 is the k - loop function given in @xcite .",
    "[ t : tab1 ]    .the values of the parameters obtained by fits to the experimental data @xcite [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     from the amplitude @xmath65 ( eq . [ mphi ] ) we have calculated the differential branching ratio @xmath66 , as measured in @xcite ( @xmath67 ) .",
    "the parameters obtained in the fits to these data are shown in table 1 .",
    "the values of masses and widths obtained in the fits do depend on the choice of the model and at this point it is difficult to interpret them as physical masses and widths of the resonances .     model - solid line ( @xmath68 ) , ` no structure ' model - dashed line ( @xmath69 ) . , width=472,height=302 ]    [ f1 ]    both models agree well with the data , as shown in fig.[f1 ] , and the destructive interference between @xmath20 and @xmath19 amplitudes is needed in both cases to describe the low @xmath70 tail of the distribution . as expected , the @xmath71 data alone can not differentiate between different models .",
    "however , as shown in the next section , charge asymmetries have an enormous analyzing power , and allow to test details of the radiative @xmath0 decays to charged pions .",
    "the importance of charge asymmetries for tests of the fsr model was discussed in details in the context of scalar qed in @xcite . at the @xmath0-factory daphne , the direct radiative @xmath0-decays , not included in @xcite , play",
    ", however an important role @xcite .",
    "these a  priori small effects are enhanced by the resonant behavior of @xmath0 and their accurate analysis is compulsory .",
    "the interest in these asymmetries is twofold .",
    "on one hand they play an important role in the fsr background estimate for the measurement of the pion form factor via the radiative return method . on the other hand ,",
    "as we will show below , they allow for powerful tests of models describing radiative @xmath0-decays .",

    "all models are compatible with kloe data on @xmath82 decay and thus the simultaneous analysis of @xmath82 and @xmath79 data is highly desirable .",
    "it will also allow for a full control of the fsr contributions to the @xmath79 cross section , hopefully reducing the error from fsr in @xmath83 , as measured via the radiative return , to a negligible level .",
    "the interplay between radiative corrections to pion pair production in electron - positron annihilation on one hand and @xmath1 production through radiative @xmath0-decays on the other hand has been investigated .",
    "the charge asymmetry is shown to be a unique signal for the interference between the amplitude for @xmath84 production through the radiative return and @xmath84 production from the radiative @xmath0-decay .",
    "this asymmetry can be studied as a function of the invariant mass of the @xmath84-system and is particularly sensitive to the model for @xmath78 .",
    "this has been demonstrated by implementing model amplitudes for @xmath85 into the phokhara event generator and by studying the resulting distributions .",
    "indeed different models , which lead to seemingly indistinguishable @xmath84 mass distributions in @xmath0-decay , give rise to strikingly different charge asymmetries .",
    "we conclude with a discussion of the impact of radiative @xmath0-decays on the measurement of the pion form factor and demonstrate , that their effect can be kept well under control , if suitable kinematic regions are selected .",
