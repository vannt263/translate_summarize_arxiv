    "2.3 ) , and as the position angle of the outer radio features is much different from that of the inner features , it is reasonable to conclude that significant deceleration occurs over most of the radio source , leading to a substantially higher age .",
    "indeed , the age of the inner lobes alone was already estimated at 6 @xmath3 10@xmath21 years ( slee et al .",
    "1983 ) , although this may be too high .",
    "the jets appear to lose much of their energy within a few parsec from the nucleus , presumably by interaction with ambient material .",
    "the peculiar radio brightness evolution of component c1 in the nuclear jet may provide a clue to this process ( tingay et al . 1998 ) underscoring the need for further vlbi monitoring of centaurus a , as well as the desirability of filling the resolution gap in the 0.10.3@xmath25 range .",
    "the inner jets dissolve in the more extended inner lobe plumes , which exhibit a profound clockwise bending ( decreasing position angle ) .",
    "again , ambient material and its movement in the galaxy , may explain the observed morphology ( see e.g. sparke 1982 ; gopal - krishna @xmath1 saripalli 1984 ; heckman et al .",
    "1985 ) , but hard evidence is lacking .",
    "moreover , this is unlikely to also explain the similarly profound clockwise bending of the giant outer lobes , well outside the optical galaxy . noting a continuous decrease of position angle ( i.e. clockwise bending ) of various features at increasing distance to the nucleus , haynes et al .",
    "( 1983 ) have proposed that the central collimating source precesses at a rate of the order of 10@xmath148 degrees per year .",
    "the discovery of a circumnuclear disk perpendicular to the nuclear and inner jet , yet inclined to the minor axis of the elliptical galaxy , supports the idea of precession .",
    "if the rate of procession is correctly estimated , the structure of the radio source should exhibit the effect of several precessional periods",
    ". it would be interesting to see whether the run of position angles with radius can indeed be modelled by such a precession of the collimating agent .",
    "alternatively , a combination of precession and ambient gas dynamics may be required , while the structure of the outer lobes , in addition , may be influenced by tumbling and orbital motion of the galaxy as a whole ( burns et al .",
    "1983 ) .    the putative age of the merger ( sect .",
    "6.3 ) suggests a link to the origin of the radio source .",
    "although the presence of an active nuclear source predating a merger can not be excluded , it is tempting to associate its origin with the accumulation of matter in the centre caused by transfer of angular momentum through viscous damping after such an event .",
    "an intriguing indication that the origin of the radio source is connected to merger activity is provided by a morphological argument . the bended appearance of the giant radio lobes ( fig .  4 ) is very similar to that of the tilted rings forming the dust band ( _ cf . _ fig .",
    "11b in nicholson et al .",
    "1992 ) rotated by 90@xmath20 .",
    "for instance , the position angle of 0@xmath20 characterizing the outer radio contours corresponds to the position angle of 90@xmath20 of the outer rings . because the dynamical time scale of the outer rings is much longer than that of the more strongly tilted inner rings , their _ present",
    "_ position angle should more closely resemble the _ original _ orientation of the inner disk structure at the time that the matter now forming the outer lobes was ejected . as the dust disk originated in a merger event , and the morphology of the radio lobes appear to follow its subsequent evolution , it seems likely that the activity creating these lobes is also a consequence of the merger event .",
    "if the nuclear source is in fact a black hole , its estimated bolometric luminosity ( half of it at high energies ) of about 10@xmath149 erg s@xmath38 implies a _ lower limit _ to the black hole mass of about 5@xmath310@xmath150 whereas the total luminosity of the radio source suggests a mass @xmath151 ( terrell 1986 and references therein ; kinzer et al .",
    "1995 ) . as the dynamical mass within 40 pc is about 4@xmath310@xmath21 @xmath14 , and",
    "there is no obvious sign of keplerian rotation ( see fig .",
    "10 ) , its _ upper limit _ must be a few times 10@xmath0 @xmath14 .",
    "although the high obscuration of the centre of ngc 5128 and the lack of h@xmath80o masers ( braatz et al . 1996 ) precludes , at the moment , a more accurate mass determination , the actual mass of the putative black hole nevertheless is fairly well - constrained and is comparable to that of the circumnuclear disk ( sect .",
    "this mass is not very high and infalling molecular clouds , especially dense cores , may penetrate deeply before being tidally disrupted .",
    "the variability of the nucleus may represent the accretion of individual stellar or cloud remnants onto the black hole triggering renewed jet activity ( sect .",
    "5.4 through 5.6 ) and fueling the radio source .",
    "details of these processes are not clear yet , but careful and frequent monitoring of centaurus a at radio , x - ray and @xmath110-ray wavelengths may provide important information .",
    "for instance , how does the nucleus drive the nuclear jets , and how are the relativistic nuclear jets transformed into the nonrelativistic inner jets ?",
    "the circumnuclear disk ( sect .",
    "5.2 ) does not seem capable of controlling the collimation of the nuclear jets , but its orientation exactly perpendicular to these jets , suggests that it is somehow connected with the collimating agent .",
    "comparison of centaurus a features with very - high resolution observations ( hst , vlba ) of other active elliptical galaxies suffering less nuclear extinction , such as the ten times more distant ngc 4261 ( e.g. jones @xmath1 wehrle 1997 , and references therein ) may prove particularly fruitful .",

    "<S> at a distance of 3.4 mpc , ngc 5128 ( centaurus a ) is by far the nearest active radio galaxy . </S>",
    "<S> it is often considered to be the prototype fanaroff - riley class i ` low - luminosity ' radio galaxy , and as such it plays an important role in our understanding of a major class of active galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> its proximity has spawned numerous detailed investigations of its properties , yielding unrivalled but still incomplete knowledge of its structure and dynamics .    </S>",
    "<S> the massive elliptical host galaxy is moderately triaxial and contains a thin , strongly warped disk rich in dust , atomic and molecular gas and luminous young stars . </S>",
    "<S> its globular cluster ensemble has a bimodal distribution of metallicities . </S>",
    "<S> deep optical images reveal faint major axis extensions as well as a system of filaments and shells . these and other characteristics are generally regarded as strong evidence that ngc 5128 has experienced a major merging events at least once in its past .    </S>",
    "<S> the galaxy has a very compact , subparsec nucleus exhibiting noticeable intensity variations at radio and x - ray wavelengths , probably powered by accretion events . </S>",
    "<S> the central object may be a black hole of moderate mass . towards the nucleus , </S>",
    "<S> rich absorption spectra of atomic hydrogen and various molecular species suggest the presence of significant amounts of material falling into the nucleus , presumably ` feeding the monster ' . emanating from the nucleus </S>",
    "<S> are linear radio / x - ray jets , becoming subrelativistic at a few parsec from the nucleus . at about 5 kpc from the nucleus </S>",
    "<S> , the jets expand into plumes . </S>",
    "<S> huge radio lobes extend beyond the plumes out to to 250 kpc . </S>",
    "<S> a compact circumnuclear disk with a central cavity surrounds the nucleus . </S>",
    "<S> its plane , although at an angle to the minor axis of the galaxy , is perpendicular to the inner jets . </S>",
    "<S> the jet - collimating mechanism , probably connected to the circumnuclear disk , appears to precess on timescales of order a few times 10@xmath0 years .    </S>",
    "<S> this review summarizes the present state of knowledge of ngc 5128 and its associated radio source centaurus a. underlying physical processes are outside its scope : they are briefly referred to , but not discussed .    </S>",
