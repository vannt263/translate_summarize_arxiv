    "a fourier-@xmath3 knot is one that can be parameterized as @xmath4 here the _ frequencies _ @xmath5 and @xmath6 are integers and the _ phase shifts _ @xmath7 and @xmath8 and _ amplitudes _ @xmath9 and @xmath10 are real numbers . because any function can be closely approximated by a sum of cosines , every knot is a fourier knot for some @xmath3 .",
    "but a remarkable theorem of lamm @xcite states that in fact every knot is a fourier-@xmath11 knot for some @xmath12 . the special case of fourier-@xmath13 knots",
    "are called _ lissajous _ knots .",
    "lissajous knots are very highly symmetric : either strongly @xmath14  amphicheiral ( if all three frequencies are odd ) , or 2-periodic and linking the axis of rotation once ( if one frequency is even ) .",
    "hence most knots , including all torus knots , are not lissajous knots .",
    "most of what is known about the topic can be found in @xcite@xcite .    while every knot can be expressed as a fourier-@xmath11 knot for some integer @xmath12 , it is not clear how big @xmath12 needs to be .",
    "to date no one has a produced a knot that requires @xmath12 to be bigger than 2 .",
    "could every knot be a fourier-@xmath11 knot with @xmath15 ?",
    "it is known that this is true for all twist knots and for all 2-bridge knots to 14 crossings @xcite , @xcite . in this paper",
    "it is shown to be true for all torus knots .",
    "this was conjectured to be true in @xcite and answers the question posed by kauffman in @xcite .",
    "the parameterization of the torus knot @xmath1 given in theorem  [ main theorem ] was found after the methodical sampling of fourier-@xmath0 knots undertaken in @xcite yielded all torus knots to 16 crossings .",
    "careful examination of these examples led to the general formula .",
    "the standard parameterization of the @xmath16 torus knot as it winds round an unknotted torus in @xmath17 , @xmath18 times in the longitudinal direction and @xmath19 times in the meridional direction , is @xmath20 here the torus is defined by sweeping the circle of radius @xmath21 centered at the point @xmath22 and lying in the @xmath23-plane around the @xmath24-axis . by using the identity @xmath25 and converting sines to cosines , we may rewrite the parameterization as @xmath26 thus every torus knot can be expressed as fourier-@xmath27 knot .",
    "this parameterization is given by both costa @xcite and kauffman @xcite , and kauffman asks if a simpler fourier representation can be found .",
    "since torus knots can not be lissajous , the following theorem is best possible .",
    "* proof : * the @xmath33-projection of the fourier-@xmath0 knot given by equations  [ xparam]-[zparam ] with @xmath34 and @xmath35 is shown in figure  [ 37 ] . the knot is oriented in the direction of increasing @xmath36 with the arrowhead placed at @xmath37 . to see that this is indeed a diagram of the torus knot @xmath38 consider only those arcs that move from left to right .",
    "notice that each of these arcs lies completely above any arc that is moving from right to left .",
    "thus the right - going arcs form a braid that lies entirely above the braid formed by the left - going arcs .",
    "the two braids join to form a closed braid that we may think of as braided around the y - axis .",
    "this figure is representative of the general case and it will suffices to prove the following two claims :      suppose @xmath39 and @xmath40 are a pair of times that produce a double point in the projection of the knot into the @xmath33-plane .",
    "it is not hard to determine that the pair @xmath41 must be one of the following two types .",
    "the first possibility is that @xmath42 where @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "we call these _ type i _ crossings .        at either type crossing",
    ", both arcs are moving to the right , or both to the left , if and only if @xmath50 . evaluating @xmath51 at a type",
    "i crossing we obtain @xmath52   \\left [ -p \\sin\\left (   k\\pi+\\frac{j p\\pi}{q}-\\frac{\\pi}{2   q}\\right)\\right]\\\\   & = & p^2\\sin^2\\left (   \\frac{j p\\pi}{q}-\\frac{\\pi}{2   q}\\right)>0 .",
    "\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] thus at a type i crossing both strings are going to the right , or both are going to the left .",
    "a similar calculation reveals that at type ii crossings the strings are headed in opposite left - right directions .    we may compute the sign of a crossing @xmath41 as follows .",
    "if @xmath53 is the projection of the velocity vector into the @xmath33-plane , then the cross product @xmath54 will point up or down .",
    "its dot product with the vector @xmath55 will be positive if and only if the crossing is right handed .",
    "thus the crossing has the same sign as @xmath56\\left[z(t_1)-z(t_2)\\right ] .",
    "\\label{crossing sign formula}\\ ] ] using equation  [ trig identity ] we may simplify @xmath57 as follows : @xmath58    to prove claim 1 we want to show that at every type ii crossing it is the upper string that is moving to the right .",
    "this is equivalent to showing that @xmath59 using [ z1-z2 ] we obtain @xmath60\\\\ & = & 2 p \\sin^2(pk\\pi / q)\\left [ 1-(-1)^k\\sin(jq\\pi / p+\\pi/(2p)-\\pi/(4q))\\right].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this quantity is always positive since within the final factor the sine term has magnitude less than 1 .",
    "thus even if we are subtracting rather than adding , the difference is positive .    to prove claim 2 , we must show that every type i crossing is left handed .",
    "computing the expression in [ crossing sign formula ] , one finds that its sign is the same as the sign of @xmath61 which we want to show is negative .",
    "notice that the two angles , @xmath62 and @xmath63 are very close together .",
    "in fact , they can never be separated by a multiple of @xmath64 . for suppose that @xmath65 for some integer @xmath21 .",
    "then , multiplying by @xmath66 gives @xmath67 which is clearly impossible .",
    "thus the sines of the two angles always have the same sign and hence their product is positive .",
    "claims 1 and 2 coupled with the fact that each string oscillates between 1 and @xmath68 in the @xmath69-direction as it moves to the left or the right completes the proof that the closed braid is indeed a torus knot . since there are a total of @xmath48 type i crossings , we see that it must be the knot @xmath1 .",
    "the final assertion , that if @xmath18 is even the phase shift @xmath70 may be replaced with the simpler expression @xmath71 , can be proven by simply repeating the proof with the new phase shift .",
    "an alternative proof , and one that offers more insight into the situation , is to consider the _ phase torus _",
    "+ @xmath72 .",
    "the type i crossing with indices @xmath73 becomes singular on the horizontal line @xmath74 where @xmath75 is an arbitrary integer .",
    "the type ii crossing with indices @xmath73 becomes singular along the diagonal lines @xmath76 where @xmath75 is an arbitrary integer .",
    "more detailed information on the phase torus and the kinds of singular curves that are associated to the type i and ii crossings can be found in @xcite .",
    "each region complementary to the singular lines defines a knot type .",
    "if @xmath18 is even , the two points @xmath77 and @xmath78 lie in the interior of the same region and therefore define the same knot type . if @xmath18 is odd , the second point no longer lies in the same complementary region as the first point .",
    "in fact , it lies at the intersection of two singular lines associated to type ii crossings and on the boundary of the region containing the first point . @xmath79"
