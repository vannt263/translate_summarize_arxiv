    "one of the major problems in nuclear physics is to understand the properties of nuclear matter under extreme conditions .",
    "this is related to the basic knowledge of the in - medium nucleon - nucleon ( nn ) interaction which in the present stage can still hardly be obtained from the ab initio theory of the strong interaction , i.e. , quantum chromodynamics .",
    "our knowledge on the in - medium nn interaction today is mainly developed along two lines . in the first line ,",
    "one starts from the bare nn interaction , which has been fitted very well from nn scattering data , together with phenomenological three - body interactions , so that the in - medium nn interaction and the properties of nuclear matter can be obtained through many - body theories . in the second line ,",
    "the starting point is an effective in - medium nn interaction or lagrangian , with the parameters fitted to the empirical nuclear matter properties obtained usually through mean - field approximations .",
    "ten years ago , an isospin- and momentum - dependent mean - field potential ( hereafter mdi ) was constructed to study the dynamics ( especially the isospin effects ) in intermediate - energy heavy - ion collisions together with an isospin - dependent boltzmann - uehling - uhlenbeck ( ibuu ) transport model  @xcite .",
    "in addition to the good description of the empirical nuclear equation of states , the momentum dependence of this mean - field potential reproduces pretty good the optical potential extracted by hama _",
    "et al . _ from elastic proton scattering data  @xcite .",
    "the studies using this interaction have constrained the nuclear symmetry energy at both subsaturation and suprasaturation densities  @xcite .",
    "in addition to the dynamics of heavy - ion collisions , the mdi model has also been used to the study the thermodynamical properties of nuclear matter  @xcite .",
    "it was recently found that the isospin- and momentum - dependent potential can be derived from an effective interaction with a density - dependent two - body interaction and a yukawa - type finite - range interaction using hartree - fock calculation  @xcite .",
    "the mdi model thus serves as a useful effective in - medium interaction .    in the past few years",
    ", the shear viscosity of the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) formed in relativistic heavy - ion collisions has attracted special attentions . from the study with a viscous hydrodynamical model  @xcite , it was found that the strong - interacting qgp behaves like a nearly ideal fluid , i.e. , its specific shear viscosity is only a little larger than the kss boundary  @xcite . up to now",
    "large efforts have been devoted to study the shear viscosity of qgp  @xcite and hadron resonance gas  @xcite formed in relativistic heavy - ion collisions , while there are only a few studies on the shear viscosity of nuclear matter formed in intermediate - energy heavy - ion collisions  @xcite .",
    "even few studies are related to the isospin effects on the shear viscosity of nuclear matter  @xcite . in the present talk",
    "i will discuss my recent study  @xcite on the shear viscosity of nuclear matter using the mdi model mentioned above from a relaxation time approach , which gives an intuitive picture how the shear viscosity changes with the density , temperature , and isospin asymmetry of nuclear matter .",
    "the system concerned here is an isospin asymmetric nuclear matter with uniform neutron and proton density @xmath0 and @xmath1 , respectively , and the nucleons are thermalized with temperature @xmath2 .",
    "the flow field @xmath3 is static in the @xmath4 direction and its magnitude is linear in the coordinate @xmath5 , i.e. , @xmath6 and @xmath7 . in the rest",
    "frame nucleons move with the flow field and follow fermi - dirac distribution @xmath8 in the equilibrium state . in the lab frame",
    "the equilibrium distribution is a simple boost by the flow field compared with that in the rest frame , denoted as @xmath9 . due to nn collisions",
    ", the real distribution may be slightly away from the equilibrium distribution and is denoted as @xmath10 , and the deviation from the equilibrium distribution @xmath11 is much smaller than @xmath9 .",
    "the shear force between flow layers per unit area by definition can be written as @xmath12 in the above , @xmath13 or @xmath14 denotes the isospin degree of freedom , @xmath15 is the number of nucleons moving between layers per unit time per unit area , and @xmath16 is the momentum transfer per nucleon in the @xmath4 direction .",
    "the nucleon velocity in the @xmath5 direction @xmath17 can be further written as @xmath18 , with @xmath19 being the effective mass . using the momentum distribution @xmath20 to calculate the average and taking into account that the equilibrium momentum distribution @xmath21 is even in @xmath22 , eq .",
    "( [ f ] ) can be further written as @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the spin degeneracy .    in the following",
    "i will calculate @xmath25 by linearizing the isospin - dependent buu equation as follows @xmath26 \\notag\\\\ & \\times & ( 2\\pi)^3 \\delta^{(3)}(\\vec{p}_1+\\vec{p}_2-\\vec{p}_1^\\prime-\\vec{p}_2^\\prime)- d\\int \\frac{d^3p_2}{(2\\pi)^3 } \\frac{d^3p_1^\\prime}{(2\\pi)^3 } \\frac{d^3p_2^\\prime}{(2\\pi)^3 }    & \\times & [ n_\\tau(p_1)n_{-\\tau}(p_2)(1-n_\\tau(p_1^\\prime))(1-n_{-\\tau}(p_2^\\prime))- n_\\tau(p_1^\\prime)n_{-\\tau}(p_2^\\prime)(1-n_\\tau(p_1))(1-n_{-\\tau}(p_2 ) ) ] \\notag\\\\ & \\times & ( 2\\pi)^3 \\delta^{(3)}(\\vec{p}_1+\\vec{p}_2-\\vec{p}_1^\\prime-\\vec{p}_2^\\prime).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in the above , @xmath2 is the transition matrix , the degeneracy @xmath27 takes the double counting of identical nucleon collisions into consideration , and @xmath28 is from the pauli blocking effect . replacing @xmath10 with @xmath9 in the first - order approximation ,",

    "the pp and np scattering cross sections are isotropic and they can be respectively parameterized as  @xcite @xmath42 where the cross sections are in mb and @xmath43 is the velocity of the projectile nucleon with respect to the fixed target nucleon .",
    "it is worth to note that in the most probable collision energies the np scattering cross section is about three times the pp scattering cross section . in nuclear matter ,",
    "the in - medium nn scattering cross sections are modified by the in - medium effective mass in the form of  @xcite @xmath44 where @xmath45 ( @xmath46 ) is the free - space ( in - medium ) reduced mass of colliding nucleons .",
    "once the relaxation time @xmath47 is known , @xmath48 can be calculated from @xmath49 using the definition @xmath50 , the shear viscosity can be calculated from eqs .",
    "( [ shearf ] ) and ( [ deltan ] ) in terms of the local momentum distribution @xmath51 as @xmath52 by setting the magnitude of the velocity field to be infinitely small .",
    "note that from eq .",
    "( [ eta ] ) the shear viscosity is related to the local momentum distribution near the fermi surface .",
    "figure [ tau ] displays the density , temperature , and isospin dependence of the relaxation time . in neutron - rich nuclear matter",
    ", @xmath53 is larger while @xmath54 is smaller compared to that in symmetric nuclear matter as a result of less frequent np collisions and more frequent nn collisions . for the similar reason ,",

    "( [ tauds ] ) , the total relaxation time is determined by @xmath57 which is always smaller than @xmath58 due to the larger np cross section than pp ( nn ) cross section in the most probably collision energies .",
    "thus , neutrons have a larger relaxation time than protons in neutron - rich nuclear matter .",
    "it is seen in panel ( d ) that the relaxation time decreases with increasing temperature due to more frequent collisions at higher temperatures .",

    "the specific shear viscosity decreases with increasing temperature , and it is similar in both magnitude and trend to those obtained from buu calculations using the green - kubo formula  @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to see that at higher temperatures the specific shear viscosity is about @xmath64 times the lower limit from ads / cft calculation  @xcite , which is already close to that of qgp extracted from the study using a viscous hydrodynamical model  @xcite . at lower temperatures the specific viscosity increases with increasing density due to the pauli blocking effect , while at higher temperatures the dependence on the density is rather weak .    ) and asymmetric ( @xmath59 ) nuclear matter . ]    due to the sharper momentum distribution of neutrons compared to that of protons in neutron - rich nuclear matter , the total shear viscosity is dominated by neutrons which have a longer relaxation time in asymmetric nuclear matter compared to that in symmetric nuclear matter .",
    "this is confirmed in fig .",
    "[ extensive ] that both the shear viscosity and the specific shear viscosity are larger in neutron - rich nuclear matter .",
    "in addition , it was seen  @xcite that both the shear viscosity and specific shear viscosity satisfy the parabolic approximation with respect to the isospin asymmetry , i.e. , @xmath65 similar to the symmetry energy , the second - order coefficient can thus be defined as the symmetry shear viscosity or the symmetry specific shear viscosity .",

    "it is seen that both the symmetry shear viscosity and symmetry specific shear viscosity decrease with increasing temperature . at lower temperatures ,",
    "both of them increase with increasing density . at higher temperatures ,",
    "the density dependence is rather weak . @xmath66 and @xmath67 are important quantities in understanding transport properties of neutron - rich nuclear matter , and they deserve further studies in the future .",
    "using a relaxation time approach , i studied the shear viscosity and specific shear viscosity of hot neutron - rich nuclear matter as that formed in intermediate - energy heavy - ion collisions by using an isospin- and momentum - dependent interaction .",
    "it is found that the specific shear viscosity decreases with increasing temperature , and it increases with increasing density at lower temperatures due to the strong pauli blocking effect .",
