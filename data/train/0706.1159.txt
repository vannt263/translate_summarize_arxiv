    "thus , the condition for a swallowtail perestroika to occur is that @xmath416 where we call @xmath417 the _ resultant eta process_.    when the zeros of @xmath417 form a perfect set , swallowtails will spontaneously appear and disappear on the caustic infinitely rapidly .",
    "as they do so , the geometry of the caustic will rapidly change moreover , maxwell sets will be created and destroyed with each swallowtail that forms and vanishes as when a swallowtail forms it contains a region with two more pre - images than the surrounding space .",
    "this will add to the turbulent nature of the solution in these regions .",
    "we call this ` complex turbulence ' occurring at the turbulent times which are the zeros of the resultant eta process",
    ".    complex turbulence can be seen as a special case of real turbulence which occurs at specific generalised cusps of the caustic . recall that when a swallowtail perestroika occurs on a curve , it also satisfies the conditions for having a generalised cusp .",
    "thus , the zeros of the resultant eta process must coincide with some of the zeros of the zeta process for certain forms of cusped turbulence . at points where",
    "the complex and real pre - caustic touch , the real pre - caustic and pre - level surface touch in a particular manner ( a double touch ) since at such a point two swallowtail perestroikas on the level surface have coalesced .",
    "thus , our separation of complex turbulence from real turbulence can be seen as an alternative form of categorisation to that outlined in section 5.3 which could be extended to include other perestroikas .",
