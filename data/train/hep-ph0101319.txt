    "bose - einstein correlations ( bec ) of identical bosons , produced in multihadron final states of high energy particle interactions , have been analysed for some 40 years @xcite .",
    "many bec analyses utilised pairs of identical charged pions produced in multihadron final states where the emitter has often been assumed to be a sphere with a gaussian distribution .",
    "the experimental results have been then subjected to a coulomb correction to account for the repulsive force between the equally charged particles .",
    "the kinematic variable frequently used , and still in use today , is defined by + @xmath8 where @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the four momenta of the two identical hadrons . in the limit of @xmath11",
    "the two identical bosons are occupying the same lowest energy ground state defined in their centre of mass system . to observe the effect of the bec",
    "the experimental @xmath12 distribution is divided by a corresponding reference sample distribution which is selected so as to be , as much as possible , identical to the data sample in all its features but void of bose - einstein statistics effects .",
    "the distribution of this ratio is in general described by the expression @xmath13 where @xmath14 measures the average distance between the two boson when they are predominantly in an s - wave .",
    "this @xmath14 value , extracted from @xmath15 as @xmath12 approaches zero , is taken to represent the dimension of the hadron emitter .",
    "the factor @xmath16 in eq .",
    "[ ctwo ] , which can vary between @xmath17 , is the strength of the effect which depends on the chaoticity of the emitter and on the purity of the measured data sample . in @xmath18 annihilations @xmath14",

    "@xcite ) , essentially independent of the centre of mass energy @xmath19 .",
    "+ in recent years the bec analyses in @xmath18 annihilations have been extended in several directions . among them , the search for the so called higher order bec namely , of three or more genuine identical hadrons correlations ; the search for deviation from an ideal spherical emitter and to studies aimed to determine whether the correlation dimension is a function of the hadron mass .",
    "@xcite it was first pointed out that in @xmath20 the measured dimension @xmath14 values are a decreasing function of the hadron mass @xmath21 ( see fig .",
    "this observation was first deduced from the measured @xmath14 values obtained from bec analyses of identical @xmath22 and @xmath23 boson - pairs .",
    "that indeed @xmath24 was significantly strengthened by the recent emitter size measurements @xcite of the @xmath25 and @xmath26 pairs .",
    "these last measurements utilised a method proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite where the mixture of s=0 and s=1 spin states can be determined for the hyperon - pair as a function of their centre of mass ( cm ) energy .",
    "the onset of the pauli exclusion principle , as the cm kinetic energy decreases to zero and the s - wave of the systems dominates , determines the @xmath27 value which was found to be of the order of 0.15 fm .",
    "+ whereas the experimental findings that @xmath28 is somewhat larger than @xmath29 , but still equal within errors , may still be consistent with the string fragmentation model , although in its basic form it expects @xmath30 to increase with @xmath21 @xcite , the much smaller value obtained for @xmath27 poses a challenge to the model @xcite .",
    "at the same time however , it was shown in ref",
    ". @xcite that by applying the heisenberg uncertainty relations , one can derive an expression for @xmath30 which decreases as @xmath21 increases , namely : @xmath31 taking for @xmath4 the value @xmath5 sec to represent the time scale of the strong interactions sector , independent of the hadron mass , one obtains the continuous thin line in fig .",
    "[ fig_rm ] which follows rather well the trend of the @xmath14 values measured in the lep1 data .",

    "[ uncertainty ] to the data yields for @xmath4 the value @xmath32 sec . the continuous thick line in fig .",
    "[ fig_rm ] , which is almost identical to the one obtained from the uncertainty relations , was derived from the virial theorem assuming local parton hadron duality @xcite using a general qcd potential @xcite .",
    "+    the effective range of the two - pion sources was also estimated in 2-dimensional bec analyses , in heavy - ion collisions @xcite and in the hadronic z@xmath1 decays @xcite , as a function of the transverse mass @xmath2 of the pion - pair , defined as @xmath33 here @xmath34 and @xmath35 are the transverse momentum of the two identical bosons in the longitudinal centre of mass system ( lcms ) @xcite . as can be seen e.g. in fig .",
    "[ fig_rl ] , the results of these studies show also a decrease of the longitudinal range @xmath36 of the @xmath37 system as @xmath2 increases .",
    "moreover , the behaviour of @xmath38 follows very closely the dependence of @xmath30 which is a function of the hadron mass itself .",
    "+ these findings pose the obvious question why the values of @xmath30 and @xmath38 essentially coincide when @xmath39 . also of interest",
    "is the question whether both or one of the two quantities , @xmath21 and @xmath2 , are the basic variables on which the hadron emitter dimension depends on and thus should play an integral part in any model describing multi - hadron production . + in the quest to understand the interrelation between @xmath30 and @xmath38 we explore in section 2 the possibility that the dependence of @xmath40 on @xmath2 can also be described in terms of the heisenberg uncertainty relations .",
    "next in section 3 we turn to another phenomenon related to the bose statistics namely the bose - einstein condensation .",
    "here we show that at a fixed very low temperature the dependence of the interatomic atomic separation on the mass of the condensates atoms is proportional to @xmath41 .",
    "finally a summary is presented in section 4 .",
    "most of the bec analyses were carried out under the assumption that the emitter size is a gaussian sphere .",
    "the possibility that the space - time extend of the particle emission region deviates from a sphere and in fact is characterised by more than one dimension has been recently proposed @xcite .",
    "in particular the lund group developed for the bec a model based on a quantum mechanical interpretation of the string fragmentation probability @xcite . in this model",
    "the correlation length in the longitudinal string direction should be larger than the corresponding range in the transverse direction .",
    "+ the experimental analyses , most of which were carried out with identical charged pions , have utilised the longitudinal centre of mass system .",
    "this coordinate system is defined for each pair of identical pions as the system in which the sum of the pion - pair momenta @xmath43 , referred to as the out axis , is perpendicular to the thrust ( or jet ) direction defined as the z - axis .",
    "the momentum difference of the pion - pair @xmath44 is then resolved into the longitudinal direction @xmath45 parallel to the thrust axis , @xmath46 is collinear with the pair momentum sum and the third axis @xmath47 , is perpendicular to @xmath48 and @xmath46 . in this system",
    "the projections of the total momentum of the particle - pair onto the longitudinal and side directions are equal to zero . in particular @xmath49 , where the index 1 and 2 refer to the first and second pion",
    ", so that @xmath50 .",
    "the difference in the emission time of the pions couples to the energy difference between the particles only in the @xmath46 direction . in a 2-dimensional analysis one defines the transverse component of q by the relation @xmath51 thus the correlation function , which is fitted to the data , is of the form @xmath52 where @xmath40 , estimated from eq .",
    "[ twodim ] as @xmath48 approaches zero , is the longitudinal geometrical radius and @xmath53 is a mixture of the transverse radius and the emission time .",
    "the experimental findings , both in heavy ion collisions @xcite and in @xmath18 annihilations @xcite , verified the theoretical expectations that @xmath54 is significantly smaller than one .",
    "+    in the frame work of the azimuthally symmetric sources of pair of identical bosons @xcite another variable of the emission function is considered namely , the transverse mass @xmath2 defined by eq .",
    "preliminary results of delphi @xcite concerning the dependence of @xmath38 on @xmath2 , measured for identical charged pion pairs present in the hadronic z@xmath1 decays , is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_rl ] .",
    "as can be seen , @xmath38 decreases with @xmath2 in a very similar way to the decrease of @xmath30 as the mass @xmath21 increases .",
    "in fact the continuous line in the figure , which is drawn according to eq . [ uncertainty ] replacing @xmath30 by @xmath38 and @xmath21 by @xmath2 , describes well the @xmath40 measurements using for @xmath4 the value @xmath55 sec . that this is the case is not surprising once one realises that @xmath56 , the longitudinal distance and @xmath57 , the difference in the longitudinal momentum of the two hadrons in the lcms , are conjugate observables which obey the uncertainty principle @xmath58 here @xmath57 is measured in gev ,",
    "@xmath59 is given in fermi units and @xmath60 gev fm .",
    "in the lcms one has @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the reduced mass of the two identical hadrons of mass @xmath21 and the longitudinal velocity @xmath63 of these hadrons .",
    "thus @xmath64    simultaneously we also utilise the uncertainty relation expressed in terms of energy and time @xmath65 where the energy is given in gev and @xmath4 in seconds . in as much that the total energy @xmath66 of the two - hadron system is determined essentially only by their mass and their kinetic energy , i.e. the potential energy can be neglected , and since in the lcms@xmath67 , one has @xmath68 where @xmath69 and @xmath70 are the transverse mass of the first and second hadron . as @xmath48 decreases the longitudinal momentum @xmath71 vanishes so that we can , once @xmath72 , expand the hadron energy @xmath66 in terms of @xmath73 and retain only the two first terms , @xmath74 next we order the identical bosons so that @xmath75 and define @xmath76 while @xmath77 inserting these relations into eq . [ expand ] one gets , after few algebraic steps , that @xmath78 as @xmath79 is larger than @xmath80 , we finally get @xmath81    since 2@xmath2 is not a function of @xmath71 it may be considered to stay fixed as @xmath82 , so that one has @xmath83 combining eqs .",
    "[ rz ] and [ deltaf ] one obtains @xmath84 this last equation is identical to the one derived in @xcite for the dependence of emitter dimension on the boson mass when @xmath30 and @xmath21 are replaced by @xmath85 and @xmath2 .",
    "a fit of eq .",
    "[ finalmt ] to the data shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_rl ] yields @xmath86 sec so that @xmath87 fm .",
    "this value is compatible with the value of @xmath88 sec obtained in @xcite for @xmath30 when one also takes into account the relatively wide spread of the 1-dimensional @xmath37 bec analyses results for @xmath30 obtained by the four lep1 experiments ( see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite ) . in heavy - ion collisions of s",
    "+ pb , at an energy of 200 gev per nucleon , the longitudinal range @xmath38 was also observed to be inversely proportional to the square root of @xmath2 @xcite namely , @xmath89 fm .",
    "the ratio between the proportionality factor of 2.0 and 0.354 may well be accounted for by the difference in the extend of the heavy ion target as compared to that of the @xmath18 annihilation leading to hadronic z@xmath1 decays .",
    "+ the dependence of the transverse dimension , @xmath90 , on the two - pion transverse mass @xmath2 has also been measured in the hadronic z@xmath1 decays @xcite . here",
    "again the transverse range was found to decrease as @xmath2 increases .",
    "however unlike @xmath40 which is a geometrical quantity , @xmath53 is a mixture of the transverse radius and the emission time so that an application of the uncertainty relations is not straightforward .",
    "when bosonic atoms are cooled down , below a critical temperature @xmath91 , the atomic wave - packets overlap and the equal identity of the particles becomes significant . at this temperature ,",
    "these atoms undergo a quantum mechanical phase transition and form a bose - einstein ( be ) condensate , a coherent cloud of atoms all occupying the same quantum mechanical state .",
    "this phenomenon , first predicted by a. einstein in 1924/5 , is a consequence of quantum statistics @xcite .",
    "detailed theoretical aspects of the bose - einstein condensation can be found in ref . @xcite and",
    "its up to date experimental situation is described in ref .",
    "concise summaries , aimed in particular to the non - expert , both of the experimental situation and the theoretical background , can be found in refs .",
    "@xcite . to form bose condensates",
    "one cools down , below the critical temperature @xmath91 , extremely dilute gases so that the formation time of molecules and clusters in three - body collisions is slowed down to seconds or even minutes to prevent the creation of more familiar transitions into liquid or even solid states .",
    "+ the existence of be condensation was first demonstrated in 1995 by three groups @xcite in cooling down rubidium , sodium and lithium .",
    "typical temperatures where be condensates occur are in the range of 500 nk to 2 @xmath92k with atom densities between @xmath93 and @xmath94 @xmath95 .",
    "the largest sodium condensate has about 20 million atoms whereas hydrogen condensate can reach even one billion atoms .",
    "+ let us consider a dilute homogeneous ideal gas of @xmath96 identical bosonic atoms of spin zero , confined in a volume @xmath97 .",
    "these atoms occupy energy levels @xmath98 , handled here as a continuous variable , which are distributed according to the bose - einstein statistics .",
    "we further set the ground state to be @xmath99 .",
    "if @xmath100 is the number of atoms in this ground state and @xmath101 is the number of atoms in the excited states then @xmath102 . for a homogeneous ideal gas of identical bosonic atoms",
    "it can be shown @xcite that at a low temperature @xmath103 one has @xmath104 where @xmath97 is the volume occupied by the atoms of mass @xmath21 .",
    "since @xmath91 is defined as the temperature where almost all bosons are still in excited states , we can , to a good approximation , equate @xmath96 with @xmath101 .",
    "that is @xmath105 for @xmath106 one obtains from eqs .",

    "the atomic density of the bose gas at very low temperatures , @xmath109 where @xmath110 , is then given by @xmath111 where @xmath112 is the boltzmann constant and @xmath113 , the atomic density , has the dimension of l@xmath114 . from this",
    "follows that @xmath115 is the average interatomic separation in the bose condensate . at the same time",
    "the thermal de broglie wave length is equal to @xmath116 combining eqs .",

    "+ in relating the condensates with the production of hadrons in high energy reactions one should however keep in mind that the interatomic separation proportionality to @xmath129 does not necessarily imply that this should also be so for hadrons produced in high energy reactions .",
    "common to both systems is their bosonic nature which allow all hadrons ( atoms ) to occupy the same lowest energy state .",
    "in addition the condensates are taken to be in a thermal equilibrium state . among the various models proposed for the production of hadrons in high energy @xmath18 and nucleon - nucleon reactions some attempts",
    "have also been made to explore the application of a statistical thermal - like model @xcite . however , whether this approach will eventually prevail is at present questionable .",

    "[ ctwo ] is different from zero i.e. , only if the source is not 100@xmath130 coherent .",
    "however so far there is no evidence for a dependence of @xmath14 on @xmath16 apart from that introduced by the correlated errors between @xmath131 and @xmath132 produced by fitting eq .",
    "[ ctwo ] to the data .",
    "it is shown that the longitudinal range of the two - pion emitter size obtained from 2-dimensional bec analyses of the hadronic z@xmath1 decays as a function of the transverse mass , is well described by the expectation of the heisenberg uncertainty relations using a constant value for @xmath4 of the order of @xmath5 seconds . as a consequence it is not surprising that @xmath38 has essentially the same behaviour as the one observed experimentally for @xmath30 which is a function of the hadron mass itself . in both cases",
    "the range , in fm , is equal to @xmath133 .",
    "this kind of dependence on the transverse mass is also seen in heavy - ion collisions where it was found that @xmath134 . + it is interesting to note that the interatomic separation of atoms in different bose condensates , having the same fixed temperature , is proportional to @xmath129 , where here @xmath21 is the atom mass .",
    "this behaviour is the same as found for the range between identical hadron - pair produced in high energy reactions when the time scale @xmath4 is fixed .",
    "this similarity can be traced back to the close connection between the de broglie wave length , applied to the bosonic atoms in condensates , and the heisenberg uncertainty relations , used here to connect in high energy reactions the range between identical hadrons to their mass .",
