    "processes like deeply virtual compton scattering , elastic meson production , and hard diffraction tell us about the spatial distribution of quarks or gluons within a hadron .",
    "the impact parameter representation provides an adequate language to represent this information .",
    "it is a deep concept in field theory and has been used in various contexts of high - energy scattering .    to describe fast moving particles ( hadrons or partons )",
    "it is useful to work with light - cone momenta @xmath0 . from the usual momentum eigenstates of a particle  labeled here by @xmath1 with boldface vectors referring to the @xmath2-@xmath3 plane ",
    "one can form states @xmath4 with definite plus - momentum and definite transverse position ( called impact parameter ) . to avoid infinities",
    "one can use wave packets , where the transverse position is smeared out a bit . to retain the simple interpretation of @xmath5 as roughly twice @xmath6 ( for @xmath7 ) one must restrict the range of @xmath8 in the wave packet , giving a position uncertainty @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "one can hence localize a particle in the @xmath2-@xmath3 plane very precisely , provided it moves fast enough along @xmath10 .",
    "this is different from trying to localize a particle in _ all three _ space dimensions , where one is limited by the compton wavelength @xmath11 .",
    "the original work of burkardt @xcite gives a hint at how this difference arises : it turns out that to achieve a simple interpretation one must approximate the energy @xmath12 with a constant for a given wave packet .",
    "to localize in three dimensions this restricts momenta to @xmath13 . for localizing in the transverse plane one needs @xmath14 , which is not restrictive for large @xmath6 .",
    "the states @xmath15 are eigenstates of a transverse position operator @xmath16 @xcite .",
    "it is associated with `` transverse boosts '' , i.e. , with lorentz transformations @xmath17 for some fixed vector @xmath18 .",
    "notice the similarity with galilean transformations in non - relativistic mechanics , where the mass of a particle replaces @xmath5 .",
    "noether s theorem relates galilean invariance with the conservation of the center of mass of a many - body system .",
    "the conserved quantity for transverse boost invariance is hence the `` center of ( plus ) momentum '' , @xmath19 .",
    "the position @xmath20 of a hadron state ( [ impact - state ] ) can be understood as the center of momentum of its partons .",
    "the impact parameter representation fits naturally with the concept of parton distributions , as realized long ago by soper @xcite and shown in detail by burkardt @xcite .",
    "this can be used for `` imaging '' of hadrons @xcite .",
    "the usual momentum space parton densities can be expressed through matrix elements @xmath21 , where the quark or gluon operator @xmath22 creates and annihilates a parton at impact parameter @xmath23 . i have omitted the dependence on polarization labels and on the usual plus momentum fraction @xmath2 of the parton in the target .",
    "inserting the same operator between the states ( [ impact - state ] ) one finds @xmath24 where the matrix element on the right - hand side depends on @xmath8 and @xmath25 only through @xmath26 because of lorentz invariance .",
    "the expression on the right is the fourier transform of a generalized parton distribution @xcite at @xmath27 and zero skewness @xmath28 , whereas the left - hand side gives the joint density of partons with plus momentum fraction @xmath2 and transverse position @xmath20 .",
    "it hence contains genuinely _ three - dimensional _ information about the target structure . integrating ( [ parton - imp ] ) over @xmath20",
    "one recovers the usual parton densities with their one - dimensional information .",
    "if one integrates over @xmath2 then @xmath22 turns into a local operator , and the right - hand side becomes the fourier transform of a form factor associated with this operator .",
    "this representation of a form factor in terms of a two - dimensional density is fully relativistic , unlike the usual representation through a three - dimensional density in a hadron at rest , which holds in the nonrelativistic limit and is limited to distance scales large compared with the compton wavelength of the target .",
    "this is not a big restriction for a large and heavy nucleus , but it is quite restrictive for a proton .",
    "an interpretation of generalized parton distributions along these lines has been proposed in @xcite .",
    "it is not known how to measure generalized parton distributions at @xmath29 ( except for certain moments in @xmath2 ) , but the processes mentioned in the beginning involve these functions at nonzero @xmath28 . a calculation analogous to ( [ parton - imp ] )",
    "gives the picture shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : impact ] for @xmath30 , and a similar one for @xmath31 @xcite .",
    "the center of momentum of the hadron is shifted by the interaction because the struck parton returns with a smaller momentum fraction .",
    "note that this shift is independent of @xmath2 , which is integrated over in the amplitudes of hard scattering processes . in a wide range of kinematics",
    "the shift is small compared with the distance of the struck parton from the `` average '' hadron position .",
    "a well - known formulation of bfkl dynamics at leading @xmath32 accuracy is the color dipole representation , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : dipole ] for the virtual compton amplitude .",
    "the sum of momentum space feynman graphs can be rewritten in terms of photon wave functions @xmath33 and of the scattering amplitude @xmath34 for a @xmath35 dipole of size @xmath36 on the target .",
    "the size @xmath36 , which is fourier conjugate to the transverse quark momentum in the loop , is conserved in the scattering process as a nontrivial consequence of small-@xmath2 kinematics , see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "after fourier transform with respect to the transverse momentum transfer @xmath37 one obtains a representation fully in impact parameter space as shown in the figure .",
    "the conservation of the center of momentum in the transition between photon and @xmath35 pair has direct consequences for the dipole scattering amplitude , which is of the form @xcite @xmath38 }    n(x_{bj } , { { \\mathbf{r } } } , { { \\mathbf{\\delta } } } ) .\\ ] ] we see that the relevant transverse distance in the fourier transform is between the target and the quark in the dipole ( not between the target and the photon ) .",
    "if one finally takes the leading double @xmath39 approximation , the amplitude @xmath40 becomes proportional to the generalized gluon distribution at impact parameter @xmath20 , with the factorization scale @xmath41 set by the size of the dipole probing the gluons .",
    "the impact parameter formalism gives a geometrical representation of hadron structure and dynamics , fully consistent with the principles of relativistic field theory .",
    "it naturally blends with the physical picture of the qcd parton model .",
    "various aspects of physics become quite transparent in this representation , such as gribov diffusion and diffractive shrinkage @xcite , the pion cloud of the nucleon @xcite , or the limit @xmath42 of a fast parton in the target @xcite .",
    "much remains to be understood , as illustrated by the nontrivial interplay of @xmath36 and @xmath20 in saturation dynamics @xcite .",
    "measurement of the @xmath43 and @xmath44 dependence in exclusive @xmath45 scattering processes can provide correlated information in longitudinal momentum and transverse position space , and thus in all three space dimensions .",
