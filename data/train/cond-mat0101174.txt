    "electron - electron interaction induced carrier relaxation is an important inelastic scattering process in low - dimensional semiconductors nanostructures .",
    "it is often ( particularly in situations where lo  phonon emission is energetically prohibited because the excited electrons do not have enough energy ) the most dominant relaxation process in semiconductor quantum wells and wires , and is therefore of considerable fundamental and practical importance .",
    "band gap engineering has led to the possibility of fabricating tunable far infrared quantum well cascade lasers ( qcl ) and efficient quantum well infrared photodetectors ( qwip ) where inelastic carrier relaxation via electron - electron interaction is a crucial ( perhaps even decisive ) process in determining device operation and feasibility @xcite . for qcl and qwip operations",
    "it is the intersubband inelastic relaxation which turns out to be the primary rate limiting scattering process . for other proposed devices , such as the planar hot electron transistors or related 2d high speed devices ,",
    "intrasubband relaxation is the important process .",
    "a thorough quantitative understanding of intra- and inter - subband relaxation due to electron - electron interaction is therefore important for the successful realization of these devices .",
    "in addition to this practical technological motivation arising from qcl , qwip , and other proposed band - engineered quantum well devices , there is also obvious fundamental reason for studying inelastic coulomb scattering in 2d quantum well systems .",
    "inelastic electron - electron scattering determines the 2d quasiparticle spectral width , as determined for example in tunneling measurements , through the imaginary part of the electron self - energy function @xcite .    in this article",
    "we use a many - body approach in calculating the inelastic relaxation rate of 2d electrons confined in gaas - al@xmath0ga@xmath1 as semiconductor quantum well structures .",
    "our work is a multisubband generalization of the earlier work @xcite by jalabert and das sarma who considered only intrasubband relaxation within a single subband model .",
    "we consider both intra and intersubband relaxation in the two lowest subbands , and consider both single well and coupled double well structures .",
    "an additional important issue addressed in our work is the effect of structural asymmetry in the quantum well on the relaxation rate .",
    "this is in fact a potentially significant factor in the fabrication of qcl and qwip structures since asymmetry could lead to the opening of new electron - electron interaction channels in the inelastic intersubband relaxation as we discuss below in this article .    the central quantity we calculate in this work , within the leading order dynamically screened coulomb interaction expansion ( the so - called gw approximation in the multisubband situation ) , is the imaginary part of electronic on - shell self - energy matrix , @xmath2 , in the quantum well subband index ( @xmath3 etc . ) .",
    "the subband self - energy in the multisubband situation is , in general , off - diagonal reflecting the breaking of the translational invariance along the growth ( _ z _ ) direction ( we take the _ x - y _ plane to be the 2d plane with all wave vectors in this paper being 2d wave vectors in the _ x - y _ plane ) .",
    "the off - diagonal self - energy , @xmath4 , incorporates in an intrinsic many - body manner the possibility of electron - electron interaction induced intersubband scattering ( both virtual and real ) of carriers .",
    "we believe that in the doped situation of our interest , where the quantum well subbands are occupied by many electrons , the many - body self - energy approach is the only reasonable technique in calculating the inelastic carrier relaxation rate in contrast to the boltzman equation approach where the scattering rates usually calculated using fermi s golden rule .",
    "this is because the dynamical screening inherent in the many electron system , which affects the calculated inelastic scattering rates in profound and highly nontrivial way , is automatically incorporated in our many - body gw expansion whereas inclusion of dynamical screening in fermi s golden rule type formula is problematic and can only be done heuristically by replacing the bare interaction by a screened interaction in an _ ad - hoc _ manner .    our theory , as mentioned above ,",
    "is based on the so - called gw self - energy approximation @xcite where the electron self - energy @xmath2 is obtained in a leading order expansion of the dynamically screened coulomb interaction @xmath5 , where the superscript @xmath6 denotes dynamical screening of the bare electron - electron interaction matrix @xmath7 in the multisubband situation .",
    "we use the rpa to obtain the dynamical screened interaction @xmath8 , i.e. @xmath9 , with @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the leading - order ( i.e. noninteracting ) electron polarizability matrix .",
    "we also approximate the electron green s function@xmath12 by the noninteracting green s function @xmath13 making our formal expression for the self - energy matrix to be @xmath14 where the integral involves integrating over all internal momentum and energy variables as well as summing over all internal subband indices ( and spin ) . putting the subband ( matrix ) indices explicitly in eq .",
    "( [ 1 ] ) , we get @xmath15 we note , however , that @xmath16 being the noninteracting green s function , is necessarily diagonal in subband indices ( i.e. an electron can not suffer an intersubband scattering in the absence of interaction ) ; @xmath17 then , eq .

    "( [ 4 ] ) may , in principle , differ from the simplistic fermi s golden rule approach we consider the specific two subband model of interest to us in this paper .",
    "then @xmath25 with only subband 1 , the ground subband , and the subband 2 , the first excited subband being considered in the theory assuming all other subbands to be substantially higher in energy making negligible contributions to the self - energies of the lowest two subbands .",
    "we also assume the square well structure to be symmetric , so that parity is a good quantum number in the problem which makes all  off - diagonal  interaction matrix elements vanish @xcite by virtue of parity conservation with the only non - zero elements of @xmath8 being @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 ( note that @xmath29 and @xmath30by symmetry ) .",

    "in this situation , the next excited subband , @xmath59 43.74 mev , is high enough in energy to be neglected .",
    "these results are present in section iii.c below .",
    "our reason for studying the five different classes of systems described above is that we are interested in understanding the effects of interwell tunneling and structural asymmetry on the electron relaxation rate .",

    "we also find that , the thin solid line ( diamonds ) corresponding to the spe contribution to @xmath190 does not contain any contribution coming from the acoustic - like plasmon mode . as a matter of fact",
    ", there is no contribution to @xmath190 in fig .",
    "4(b ) coming from the emission of the acoustic - like plasmon mode at all because the integral in @xmath190 does not contain any segment representing the acoustic - like plasmon mode which is heavily landau damped in the asymmetric situation under consideration . on the other hand ,",
    "the thin dashed line ( squares ) , corresponding to the plasmon contribution to @xmath188 , clearly has two threshold wave vectors @xmath26110@xmath209 @xmath262and @xmath26310@xmath209 @xmath143 , which characterizes the emission of the acoustic- and optical - like plasmon mode , respectively .",
    "thus , in the asymmetric case , the acoustic - like plasmon modes contribute to carrier scattering @xmath188 in the narrower well but not to @xmath190 in the wider well by virtue of strong landau damping .",

    "5 is that inter- and intra - subband plasmon modes as well as intra- and inter - subband single - particle excitations contribute to the total inelastic scattering rate @xmath188 in the second subband .",
    "notice that , in contrast to the behavior of @xmath190 , the total inelastic scattering rate in the second subband @xmath188 does not vanish for wavevectors any @xmath280 this is due the fact that there is no fermi surface in the second subband .",
