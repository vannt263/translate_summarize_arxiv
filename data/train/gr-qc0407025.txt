    "a direct observation of gravitational waves ( gw ) produced by astrophysical sources is an ultimate goal for a new generation of detectors based on laser interferometry @xcite-@xcite . a broad class of expected signals",
    "are bursts which are transients of gravitational radiation with short duration , typically less then a second .",
    "they may be produced by sources such as supernova explosions , mergers of binary inspiral systems , gamma ray bursts , and other violent and energetic phenomena in the universe .",
    "the first result of burst searches with ligo detectors has been recently reported by the ligo collaboration @xcite .    at the present time",
    "the waveforms of gravitational waves from burst sources are poorly known .",
    "consequently , burst searches employ data analysis algorithms which identify bursts with a broad range of possible waveforms .",
    "recently several such algorithms have been developed @xcite , including the algorithm called waveburst @xcite .",
    "the waveburst algorithm is based on wavelet transformations and allows detection of a wide class of gw bursts by using a bank of wavelet packets @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we describe a data analysis pipeline with a particular implementation of the waveburst algorithm and evaluate the pipeline performance on the data from the second ligo scientific run ( s2 ) .",
    "the s2 data was collected from all three ligo detectors during a two month period beginning on february 14 , 2003 .",
    "we used a small fraction ( @xmath0 ) of the s2 data , which was selected as the test ( playground ) set for the purpose of tuning and evaluation of the burst detection algorithms .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : we begin with a brief description of the data analysis pipeline , present the measurements of the false alarm rates , and conclude with the estimation of the pipeline sensitivity .",
    "the block diagram of the waveburst data analysis pipeline is shown in figure  [ fig : pipeline ] .",
    "the pipeline takes as input the raw time series from the gw channels of the three ligo detectors and generates a set of potential gw burst events ( triggers ) .",
    "the data processing stages of the pipeline are :    * production of burst triggers with the waveburst event trigger generator ( etg ) , * reconstruction of events coincident in all three ligo detectors , * final selection of the triple coincidence events .",
    "the waveburst etg is an implementation of the burst analysis method described in @xcite .",
    "the method is based on wavelet transformations which allow time - frequency representation of data .",
    "the bursts are identified by looking for regions in the wavelet domain with an excess of power inconsistent with stationary detector noise .",
    "the etg takes data from the gw channels of two detectors and produces a list of coincident burst triggers .",
    "the data is processed in the following steps : 1 ) wavelet transformation , 2 ) selection of wavelet amplitudes , 3 ) coincidence between the channels , 4 ) generation of burst triggers , and 5 ) selection of burst triggers . during steps 1 ) , 2 ) and 4 ) the data processing is independent for each channel . during steps 3 ) and",
    "5 ) data from both channels is used .",
    "the input data are time series with duration of 120 seconds and sampling rate of @xmath1  hz . using the orthogonal wavelet transformation the time series are converted into wavelet series @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the time index and @xmath4 is the wavelet layer index .",
    "each wavelet layer can be associated with a certain frequency band of the initial time series .",
    "therefore , the wavelet series @xmath2 can be displayed as a time - frequency scalogram consisting of 64 wavelet layers with @xmath5 pixels ( data samples ) each .",
    "the time - frequency resolution of the waveburst scalograms is the same for all wavelet layers ( @xmath6  sec @xmath7  hz ) , which is different from dyadic time - frequency resolution of conventional wavelets @xcite .",
    "the constant time - frequency resolution makes the waveburst scalograms similar to spectrograms produced with windowed fourier transformations .",
    "for each layer we select a fixed fraction ( @xmath8 ) of pixels with largest absolute amplitudes , which are called _",
    "black pixels_. the number of black pixels is @xmath9 .",
    "all other wavelet pixels are called _",
    "white pixels_. then we calculate rank statistics for the black pixels .",
    "the rank @xmath10 is an integer number from 1 to @xmath9 with the rank 1 assigned to the pixel with the largest amplitude .",
    "given the rank @xmath10 , the following non - parametric statistic is computed @xmath11 for white pixels the value of @xmath12 is set to zero .",
    "the statistic @xmath12 has a meaning of the pixel _",
    "logarithmic significance_. assuming gaussian detector noise , the logarithmic significance can be also calculated as @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the absolute value of the pixel amplitude in units of the noise standard deviation . in practice ,",
    "the ligo detector noise is not gaussian and its probability distribution function is not well known .",
    "therefore , we use the non - parametric statistic @xmath12 , which is a more robust measure of the pixel significance than @xmath15 . using the inverse function of @xmath16 with @xmath12 as an argument , we introduce the _ non - parametric amplitude _ @xmath17 and the _ excess power ratio _ @xmath18 which characterizes the pixel excess power above the average detector noise .    after the black pixels",
    "have been selected , we require a coincidence between the channels . given a black pixel in the first channel , it is accepted or rejected depending on a condition applied to pixels in the corresponding time - frequency area of the second channel . the pixel is accepted if the significance of pixels in the second channel satisfies @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the _ coincidence threshold_. otherwise , the pixel is rejected .",
    "this procedure is repeated for all black pixels in the first channel .",
    "the same coincidence algorithm is applied to pixels in the second channel . as a result , a considerable number of black pixels in both channels produced by fluctuations of the detector noise is rejected . at the same time",
    ", black pixels produced by coincident bursts have a much higher acceptance probability because of the coherent excess of power in two detectors .",
    "after the coincidence procedure is applied to both channels , the channels may have similar but not identical patterns of black pixels which form clusters .",
    "the clusters can be reconstructed separately for each channel . however , in the present waveburst algorithm , we merge the black pixels from both channels into one time - frequency scalogram and then run a cluster analysis . for each black pixel",
    "we define neighbors , which share a side or a vertex with the black pixel .",
    "neighbors can be both black and white pixels .",
    "the white neighbors are called _ halo _ pixels .",
    "we define a cluster as a connected group of black and halo pixels . after the cluster reconstruction , we go back to the original time - frequency scalograms and calculate the cluster parameters separately for each channel .",
    "there are always two clusters , one per channel , which form a waveburst trigger .",
    "the cluster parameters are calculated using black pixels only .",
    "for example , the cluster size @xmath21 is defined as the number of black pixels . other parameters , which characterize the cluster strength , are the cluster excess energy ratio @xmath22 and the cluster _ logarithmic likelihood _ @xmath23 : @xmath24 where @xmath25 defines a set of black pixels in the cluster . the cluster size and",
    "the excess power ratio are used for the selection of triggers .",
    "a trigger is reported by the etg if both clusters satisfy the conditions : @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "there are two main etg parameters : the black pixel fraction @xmath8 and the coincidence threshold @xmath20 .",
    "the purpose of these parameters is to control the average black pixel occupancy @xmath28 of the scalograms used for the cluster reconstruction .",
    "to ensure robust cluster reconstruction , the occupancy should not be greater than @xmath29% .",
    "for white gaussian detector noise the functional dependence @xmath28 can be calculated analytically .",
    "we require that @xmath30 , which sets a constraint on @xmath8 and @xmath20 .",
    "the selection of black pixels effectively sets a threshold on the wavelet amplitudes : @xmath31 . the larger the value of @xmath8  the lower the threshold .",
    "however , the black pixel fraction should not be greater than 31.7% , otherwise pixels with negative values of @xmath32 would be taken into the analysis . from the other side , with @xmath8 set too small ( less than a few percent ) , noise outliers due to instrumental glitches may consume the entire time - frequency volume available for black pixels and thus mask gravitational waves . to avoid saturation from the instrumental glitches , we run the analysis with @xmath8 equal to 10% . together with the occupancy constraint above it sets the coincidence threshold of @xmath33 .    for s2 playground data and selected values of @xmath8 and @xmath20 ,",
    "the average trigger rate is approximately @xmath34  hz . within a factor of two",
    "it is consistent with the false alarm rate expected for the white gaussian detector noise . to reduce the etg rates to manageable level ( @xmath35  hz )",
    ", we set an intermediate threshold on the cluster excess power ratio ( section  [ s_etg ] ) and postpone the final selection of the pipeline threshold for the post - production analysis ( section  [ final ] ) . in this case , there is no need to re - run the etg , which is cpu and time consuming operation , for tuning of the pipeline false alarm rates and sensitivity .",
    "the output of the waveburst etg is a set of double coincidence triggers for a selected interferometer pair @xmath36 . for three ligo interferometers",
    "there are three possible pairs : @xmath37 , @xmath38 and @xmath39 , where @xmath40 and @xmath41 are two hanford interferometers and @xmath42 is the livingston interferometer . to identify triple coincidence events ,",
    "we require a time - frequency coincidence of the waveburst triggers generated for these three pairs .",
    "for time coincidence the following conditions are required @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the time window ( @xmath45 ) and @xmath46 is the average center time of the @xmath47 and @xmath48 clusters . given the time @xmath49 for individual pixels , the cluster center time is calculated as @xmath50 we also apply a loose requirement on the frequency coincidence of the waveburst triggers .",
    "first , we calculate the minimun ( @xmath51 ) and maximum ( @xmath52 ) frequency for each interferometer pair @xmath36 @xmath53 where @xmath54 and @xmath55 are the lower and upper frequency boundaries of the @xmath47 and @xmath48 clusters",
    ". then the trigger frequency bands are calculated as @xmath56 for all pairs . for frequency coincidence",
    ", the bands of all three waveburst triggers are required to overlap .",
    "the triple coincidence events consist of 3 waveburst triggers or 6 clusters .",
    "the cluster parameters are calculated separately for each interferometer , as described in section  [ s_etg ] .",
    "for the final selection of the burst triggers we use the _ cluster significance _",
    "@xmath57 derived from the logarithic likelihood @xmath23 @xcite .",
    "given the significance of six clusters , we compute the _ combined significance _ of the triple coincidence event as @xmath58 where @xmath59 ( @xmath60 ) is the significance of @xmath47 ( @xmath48 ) cluster for the @xmath61 interferometer pair .",
    "figure  [ fig : gcga ] shows the combined significance distribution for the false alarm events found in the s2 playground data . to control the pipeline false alarm rate , we set a threshold on the value of the combined significance",
    "assuming there is no physical correlation between the hanford and livingston sites , the false alarm ( fa ) rate is dominated by accidental triple - coincidence events produced by fluctuations of the detector noise . for estimation of the fa rate",
    "we perform the entire waveburst analysis on the data with artificial time shifts between the livingston and hanford detectors .",
    "the false alarm triggers are generated for 46 time lags between @xmath62 and @xmath63 seconds with time step of @xmath64 seconds .",
    "the zero time lag is excluded from the analysis .",
    "figure  [ fig : bg_lags ] shows the measured rates at different time lags before the final selection cut is applied to the combined significance .",
    "the measurements at different time lags are consistent with the average rate of @xmath65 hz .",
    "selection cut as a function of the time lag between the livingston and hanford detectors.,scaledwidth=70.0% ]        as shown in figure  [ fig : bgrate ] , the fa rate depends strongly on the waveburst combined significance cut . without compromising much the pipeline sensitivity ,",
    "the significance threshold is set to 5.47 ( or @xmath66 ) . at this threshold",
    "the fa rate is approximately @xmath67 for the waveburst triggers in the frequency band @xmath68  hz .",
    "the rate is strongly dependent on the frequency band selected for the analysis .",
    "for example , for the frequency band below @xmath69  hz , the measured fa rate is approximately @xmath70 . both the fa rate and the pipeline sensitivity depend on the significance threshold . varying the threshold , we can study the dependence of the fa rate on the sensitivity , which is an important characteristic of the pipeline .",
    "figure  [ fig : roc ] shows the pipeline rate as a function of the sensitivity for frequency band below @xmath69  hz .    hz and @xmath71 .",
    "solid circles correspond to the waveburst triggers with @xmath72 greater than 0 , 0.5 , 1.0 , 1.25 , 1.5 , 1.7 , 2.0 , 2.5 ( counting from the left ) . for convenience ,",
    "the rate - hrss dependence is approximated with a solid line.,scaledwidth=80.0% ]",
    "for estimation of the waveburst detection efficiency we studied the response of the analysis pipeline to simulated signals .",
    "simulated signals with different amplitudes were injected into the gw data streams from three ligo detectors .",
    "then we applied the waveburst algorithm to find the injected signals and thus estimated the pipeline sensitivity .",
    "several ad - hoc and astrophysically motivated waveforms were selected for injections . these included gaussian , sine - gaussian waveforms and the simulated bh - bh merger waveforms described in @xcite . to make the injections as realistic as possible we took into account the antenna pattern functions of the ligo detectors and injected the waveforms at random times , accounting for the delay in the arrival time between the hanford and livingston sites .",
    "a general gw burst is comprised of two waveforms @xmath73 and @xmath74 which represent two polarizations of the gravitational wave .",
    "the signal produced at the output of the gw detector is a linear combination of these waveforms : @xmath75 where @xmath76 and @xmath77 are the antenna pattern functions .",
    "these functions depend on the source location in the sky ( spherical angles @xmath78 and @xmath79 ) and its polarization angle @xmath80 . to generate the antenna pattern functions for hanford detectors",
    ", we explicitly construct the rotational transformation from the source coordinate frame to the hanford frame . to obtain the @xmath42 antenna pattern",
    "we apply a second transformation ",
    "rotation from the hanford to the livingston detector frame .",
    "the amplitudes of injected signals are varied to obtain the sensitivity of the algorithm as a function of the injection strength . for the hanford data ,",
    "the simulated signals are injected randomly in time at the average rate of 5 per minute . for the livingston data , the same set of waveforms",
    "is injected with time delays , uniquely defined by the source coordinates @xmath78 and @xmath79 .",
    "the source coordinates are generated randomly , so the sources appear distributed uniformly on the sky ( _ all sky simulation _ ) and their polarization angles take random values between @xmath81 and @xmath82 . in addition , we injected waveforms with the same strength for both sites , ignoring the antenna pattern functions .",
    "although this simulation does not correspond to any meaningful source population , it allows us to remove the contribution of the antenna pattern functions and estimate the best pipeline sensitivity .",
    "below we refer to this case as the _ simulation with optimal orientation_.      the detection efficiency is a function of the injected signal strength . for a given signal strength ,",
    "the detection efficiency is defined as the ratio of the number of detected waveforms to the total number of injected waveforms .",
