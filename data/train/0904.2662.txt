    "after the discovery of bulk plasmons in an infinite electron plasma,@xcite-@xcite there was a great deal of interest in plasmons occurring in structures with special geometries , like a half - space ( semi - infinite ) plasma , a plasma slab of finite thickness , a two - plasmas interface ( two plasmas bounding each other ) , a two - dimesional sheet with an aperture , a slab with a cilindrical hole , structures with surface gratings or regular holes patterns , layered films , cilindrical rods and spherical particles , etc .",
    "there is a vast literature on various structures with special geometries exhibiting plasmon modes .",
    "these studies were aimed mainly at identifying new plasmon modes , like the surface plasmons,@xcite-@xcite accounting for the electron energy loss experiments and exploring the interaction of the electron plasma with electromagnetic radiation ( polariton excitations).@xcite-@xcite more recently , a possible enhancement of the electromagnetic radiation scattered on electron plasmas with special geometries enjoyed a particular interest.@xcite-@xcite in all these studies the plasmon and polariton modes are of fundamental importance.@xcite-@xcite the methods used in deriving such results are of great diversity , resorting often to particular assumptions , such that the basic underlying mechanism of plasmons or polaritons occurrence is often obscured .",
    "the need is therefore felt of having a general , unifying procedure for deriving plasmon and polariton modes in structures with special geometries , as based on the equation of motion of the charge density , maxwell s equations and the corresponding boundary conditions . such a procedure is presented in this paper for an ideal semi - infinite plasma and an ideal plasma slab .    we represent the charge disturbances as @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the ( constant , uniform ) charge concentration and @xmath2 is a displacement field of the mobile charges ( electrons ) .",
    "this representation is valid for @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the wavevector and @xmath5 is the fourier component of the displacement field .",
    "we assume a rigid neutralizing background of positive charge , as in the well - known jellium model . in the static limit , _",
    "i.e. _ for coulomb interaction , the lagrangian of the electrons can be written as @xmath6+e\\int d\\mathbf{r}\\phi(\\mathbf{r})\\delta n(\\mathbf{r})\\,\\,\\,,\\label{1}\\ ] ] where @xmath7 is the electron mass , @xmath8 is the coulomb energy , @xmath9 is the electron charge and @xmath10 is an external scalar potential . equation ( [ 1 ] ) leads to the equation of motion @xmath11 which is the starting equation of our approach .",
    "we leave aside the dissipation effects ( which can easily be included in equation ( [ 2 ] ) ) .    by using the fourier transform for an infinite plasma it is easy to see that the eigenmode of the homogeneous equation ( [ 2 ] ) is the well - known bulk plasmon mode given by @xmath12 . on the other side ,",
    "equation @xmath0 is equivalent with maxwell s equation @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the internal electric field ( equal to @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the polarization ) . making use of the electric displacement @xmath17",
    ", we get the well - known dielectric function @xmath18 in the long - wavelength limit from the solution of the inhomogeneous equation ( [ 2 ] ) .",
    "similarly , since the current density is @xmath19 , we get the well - known electrical conductivity @xmath20 .",
    "we apply this approach to a semi - infinite plasma and a plasma slab .",
    "first , we derive the surface and bulk plasmon modes and obtain the dielectric response and the electron energy loss for a semi - infinite plasma . the surface contribution to the energy loss exhibits an oscillatory behaviour in the transient regime near the surface .",
    "further on , we consider the interaction of the semi - infinite plasma with the electromagnetic field , as described by the usual term @xmath21 in the lagrangian , where @xmath22 is the vector potential , @xmath23 is the charge density and @xmath24 is the scalar potential .",
    "we limit ourselves to the interaction with the electric field , and compute the reflected and refracted waves , as well as the reflection coefficient .",
    "generalized fresnel s relations are obtained for any incidence angle and polarization .",
    "we find it more convenient to use the radiation formulae for the retarded potentials , instead of using directly the maxwell s equations , and the resulting integral equations are solved .",
    "bulk and surface plasmon - polariton modes are identified .",
    "the field inside the plasma is either damped ( evanescent ) or propagating ( transparency regime ) , and the reflection coefficient exhibits an abrupt enhancement on passing from the propagating to the damping regime ( total reflection ) .",
    "finally , we give similar results for a plasma slab , where we compute also the transmitted field and the transmission coefficient .",
    "apart from characteristic oscillations , the reflection and transmission coefficients for a plasma slab exhibit an appreciable enhancement in the damped regime .",
    "the present approach can be extended to various other plasma structures with special geometries .",
    "we consider an ideal semi - infinite plasma extending over the half - space @xmath25 ( and bounded by the vacuum for @xmath26 ) .",
    "the displacement field @xmath2 is then represented as @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the displacement component in the @xmath29-plane , @xmath30 is the displacement component along the @xmath31-direction and @xmath32 for @xmath25 and @xmath33 for @xmath26 is the step function . in equation of motion (",

    "one can see the ( de)-polarizing field occurring at the free surface @xmath40 ( the second integral in equation ( [ 4 ] ) ) .",
    "we use fourier transforms of the type @xmath41 ( for in - plane unit area ) , as well as the fourier representation @xmath42 for the coulomb potential .",
    "then , it is easy to see that equation ( [ 4 ] ) leads to the integral equation@xmath43 and @xmath44 , where we have dropped out for simplicity the arguments @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "the @xmath28-component of the displacement field is directed along the wavevector @xmath47 ( in - plane longitudinal waves ) .",

    "one can see the surface contributions ( terms proportional to @xmath53 ) and bulk contributions ( @xmath54-terms ) .",
    "the solutions given by equations ( [ 9 ] ) exhibit two eigenmodes , the bulk plasmon @xmath55 and the surface plasmon @xmath56 , as it is well known .",
    "indeed , the homogeneous equation ( [ 8 ] ) ( @xmath57 ) has two solutions : the surface plasmon @xmath58 for @xmath59 and the bulk plasmon @xmath60 for @xmath61 . making use of this observation",
    "we can represent the general solution as an eigenmodes series @xmath62 for @xmath25 , where @xmath63 , and @xmath64 .",
    "then , it is easy to see that the hamiltonian @xmath65 corresponding to the lagrangian @xmath66 given by equation ( [ 1 ] ) becomes @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the kinetic energy and @xmath69 is the potential energy .",
    "we can see that this hamiltonian corresponds to harmonic oscillators with frequencies @xmath56 and @xmath55 .    making use of @xmath14 and equations ( [ 9 ] ) we can write down the internal field ( polarization ) as@xmath70 where @xmath71 is directed along the in - plane wavevector @xmath47 and @xmath72 is parallel with the @xmath31-axis ( perpendicular to the surface @xmath40 ) .",
    "this is the dielectric response of the semi - infinite plasma to an external potential .",
    "we take an external potential of the form @xmath73 ( leaving aside the frequency argument @xmath46 ) , and get the electric displacement @xmath74 and @xmath75 from @xmath76 .",
    "we can see that the surface terms do not contribute to this response , as expected , since these terms are localized . making use of @xmath77 , we get the well - known dielectric function @xmath78 in the long - wavelength limit .",
    "it is well known that the energy loss per unit time ( stopping power ) is given by @xmath79 for an electron moving with velocity @xmath80 , where the field @xmath81 is taken at @xmath82 and @xmath83 for @xmath84 ( @xmath25 ) .",
    "it is assumed that the electron energy is sufficiently large and the energy loss is small enough to use a constant @xmath28 in estimating the _ rhs _ of equation ( [ 13 ] ) .",
    "the potential created by the electron is given by the poisson equation @xmath85 , whence , by making use of the fourier representation ( [ 6 ] ) , we get @xmath86 we introduce this potential in equations ( [ 12 ] ) and compute the energy loss given by equation ( [ 13 ] ) .",
