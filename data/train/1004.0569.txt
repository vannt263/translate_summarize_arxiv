    "the successful prediction of anomalous magnetic moments in early days of particle physics was one of the first triumphs of quantum field theory  @xcite . since then it has served as a critical test of the standard model of particle physics , which is based on quantum field theory , guided by gauge principle .",
    "recent measurement of anomalous magnetic moment of muon ( e821 at bnl )  @xcite provides the most stringent test so far , at the level of sub parts per million , of the standard model , @xmath1 which exhibits currently @xmath2 deviation from the standard model estimate : @xmath3 if the discrepancy persists in more improved measurements , such as the e969 experiment , planned at bnl , or other experiments at the fermi lab , it will certainly indicate a hint of new physics .",
    "therefore it is quite necessary to understand the standard model predictions more precisely to pin down the possible hint of new physics at the level of @xmath4 or more .",
    "the theoretical prediction of muon @xmath5 in the standard model consists of three different contributions : @xmath6 among them the qed contribution is most dominant one and has been calculated to be @xmath7 at 4.5 loops by kinoshita et al  @xcite , while the weak interaction corrections are found to be @xmath8 at the two - loop level  @xcite .    as hadrons ( or quarks ) contribute to the anomalous magnetic moment of muon only through quantum fluctuations , the strong interaction contribution is suppressed , compared to that of qed .",
    "the current estimate of the hadronic contributions is @xmath9 the most uncertainty in the sm estimate is however coming from the hadronic contributions , since we poorly understand strong dynamics , while the electroweak corrections can be calculated accurately in perturbation",
    ". direct calculation of hadronic contributions from qcd requires lattice calculations , which are currently not accurate enough to give a meaningful result due to large systematic uncertainties  @xcite .    in this talk",
    "i present new estimates of the hadronic contributions , based on a holographic model of qcd .",
    "holographic models have been proposed recently for qcd  @xcite , inspired by the gauge / gravity duality , found in string theory  @xcite , which states that certain strongly coupled gauge theories are equivalent to weakly coupled gravity in one - higher dimension , the extra dimension being the renormalization scale .",
    "the holographic models of qcd were found to be quite successful to account for the properties of hadrons at low energy and give relations to their couplings and also new sum rules  @xcite , offering theoretical understanding of phenomenological rules for hadrons found in 60 s such as vector meson dominance , proposed by sakurai  @xcite .",
    "holographic qcd ( hqcd ) is a model for 5d gravity dual theory of qcd in the large @xmath10 and large t hooft coupling limit ( @xmath11 ) , describing qcd directly with hadrons . as a gravity dual of qcd with three light flavors we consider @xmath12 flavor gauge theory in a slice of @xmath13 , @xmath14 where the metric is given as",
    ", taking the ads radius @xmath15 , @xmath16 we take the ultraviolet ( uv ) regulator @xmath17 and introduce an infra - red ( ir ) brane at @xmath18 to implement the confinement of qcd , breaking the conformal symmetry  @xcite . the bulk scalar ( @xmath19 ) and the bulk gauge fields ( @xmath20 ) are dual to @xmath21 and @xmath22 , respectively . following katz and schwartz  @xcite ,",

    "our calculations can be easily applied to other holographic models like sakai - sugimoto model , which will give similar results",
    ".    gauge / gravity duality at large @xmath10 and large @xmath30 implies that the generating functional of one - particle irreducible green s functions is given by the classical gravity action of the dual theory : @xmath31=s_{5d{\\rm eff}}[\\phi(x,\\epsilon)]\\quad{\\rm with}\\quad \\phi(x,\\epsilon)=\\phi_{0}(x)\\,.\\label{ads - cft}\\ ] ] using this equality we will be able to calculate the hadronic contributions at the leading order in @xmath32 and @xmath33 expansion .",
    "the strong interaction contributions to the muon magnetic moment consist of three pieces ; the hadronic vacuum polarization ( hlo ) , the higher - order hadronic vacuum - polarization effect , and the hadronic light - by - light ( lbl ) scattering .",
    "the hlo contribution ( see fig .  [ hlo ] ) is given as  @xcite @xmath34 where the vacuum polarization is defined as @xmath35 and the kernel is @xmath36    from the ads / cft formula ( [ ads - cft ] ) the vector current correlator @xmath37 can then be expressed in terms of the infinite set of the vector meson wave - functions @xmath38 , as shown in fig .",

    ", we find for euclidean momentum @xmath42",
    "@xcite @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the decay constant of @xmath45-th excited vector mesons .",
    "plugging the holographic vacuum polarization ( [ bar : pi ] ) into the formula ( [ g-2 ] ) , we obtain  @xcite @xmath46 which agrees , within 30% errors , with the currently updated value  @xcite , estimated from new 2009 babar data  @xcite @xmath47 |_{\\rm babar }   = ( 514.1 \\pm 3.8 ) \\times 10^{-10 } \\ , .",

    "[ lbl diagram ] , we need to calculate 4-point functions of flavor currents .",
    "since there is no quartic term for @xmath48 ( @xmath49 ) , there is no 1pi 4-point function for the em currents in hqcd ,    because higher order terms like @xmath50 or @xmath51 terms are suppressed . in hqcd",

    "in the era of electroweak precision , it becomes more important to understand precisely qcd corrections to the electroweak processes . as being non - perturbative strong dynamics , qcd corrections are often difficult to estimate and one resorts to lattice calculations , which are , however , not precise enough for certain measurements such as muon anomalous magnetic moment .",
