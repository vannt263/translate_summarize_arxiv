    "experimental realizations of analogue black holes  @xcite and their associated effects have drawn a lot of attention in the past few years  @xcite .",
    "probably the most discussed results have been the first observation of the classical analogue of hawking radiation in an open channel flow  @xcite and the still controversial observation of radiation in ultrashort laser pulse filaments  @xcite . even though it remains an open question whether or not real black holes emit hawking radiation , calculations involving analogue black holes suggest that the emission process is most probably unaffected by transplanckian effects that could , in principle , alter or even exclude the radiation process  @xcite .",
    "superradiance  @xcite is another typical phenomenon of black hole physics  @xcite which is also manifest in analogue models of gravity  @xcite . in standard scattering processes ,",
    "the ratio between the reflected and the incident particle number currents  @xcite ( i.e.  the reflection coefficient ) is smaller than one .",
    "this is directly encoded by the fact that the amplitude of the reflected wave is usually smaller than the amplitude of the incident one in non - dispersive normalized scattering processes . however , in some special situations ( e.g.  wave scattering in a kerr black hole spacetime ) , low - frequency incident waves can be amplified in the scattering process . this amplification effect , known as superradiance ,",
    "was first discovered by zeldovich in the context of electromagnetic waves  @xcite , and later shown to be a more general phenomenon in physics  @xcite , in which classical as well as quantum field excitations can be amplified .",
    "the main goal of our work is to analyze the robustness of the amplification process for dispersive fields .",
    "the dispersive fields considered in this paper exhibit two extra scattering channels , such that one can study the overall robustness of the amplification process for multiple superradiant scattering . additionally , in some simplified cases we also investigate the specific deviations in the amplification spectrum due to dispersion .",
    "the examples discussed in this paper are motivated by analogue models of gravity , where fields exhibiting sub or superluminal dispersion relations arise naturally .      before starting our analysis of superradiance for dispersive fields , it is important to review the basic ingredients that make the phenomenon possible in some simple systems .",
    "for example , in a kerr black hole , incident scalar field modes of frequency @xmath0 and azimuthal number @xmath1 are known to be superradiant for sufficiently low frequencies . although the klein ",
    "gordon equation is very complicated when expressed in standard boyer - lindquist coordinates , the radial part of the equation of motion for these modes can be written , after a change of variables , very simply as + v _ ,",
    "m(r^*)u=0 , where @xmath2 is related to the radial part of the separated scalar field and @xmath3 is a tortoise - like coordinate ( which goes to @xmath4 at the event horizon and reduces to the standard radial coordinate @xmath5 at spatial infinity ) .",
    "@xmath6 is the effective potential and possesses the following asymptotics , [ bh2 ] v _ , m ( r^ * )    ( -m_h)^2 , & r^*- , + ^2 , & r^*+ ,    where @xmath7 is the angular velocity of the black hole at the event horizon .",
    "it can be shown that , for @xmath8 , incident modes are superradiantly scattered by the black hole  @xcite .",
    "the corresponding reflection coefficient is given by [ basic_ref_kerr ] |r|^2=1-|t|^2 > 1 , where @xmath9 is the transmission coefficient .",
    "two factors are responsible for the occurrence of the effect  @xcite : first , the event horizon behaves as a one - way membrane that allows only ingoing transmitted waves ( defined by the group velocity ) near the black hole ; second , because of the ergoregion of the rotating black hole , low - frequency ingoing waves are associated with an outgoing particle number current at the horizon ( the current being proportional to @xmath10 )  @xcite .",
    "this outgoing flux at the horizon is compensated by the superradiantly reflected modes in such a way that the total particle number current is conserved during the process .",
    "another simple system exhibiting superradiance is a massless scalar field @xmath11 with electric charge @xmath12 and minimally coupled to an electromagnetic potential @xmath13 in 1 + 1-dimensions  @xcite .",
    "the evolution of this system is determined by the klein ",
    "gordon equation , [ kg0 ] ( _ - i e a_)(^ - i e a^)=0 , which , after separation of the temporal dependence ( i.e.  @xmath14 ) , reduces to [ corinne1 ] + ( -ev(x))^2 f=0 , where @xmath0 is the frequency of the mode in question . if the electromagnetic potential @xmath15 has the following asymptotic behaviour , [ corinne2 ] v(x)=    0 , & x- , + e_0 , & x+ ,    one can calculate the relation between the reflection and transmission coefficients for incident waves  @xcite : [ basic_ref ] |r|^2=1-|t|^2 . therefore , low frequency ( @xmath16 ) . therefore , if we redefine @xmath17 , the superradiant condition will be given by @xmath18 . throughout this paper , we fix the potential by requiring that @xmath19 .",
    "consequently , the condition for superradiance , which is based on the smallness of @xmath20 , is reduced to a condition on the smallness of @xmath0 . ]",
    "right - moving modes originating from @xmath4 interact with the scattering potential , resulting in transmitted right - moving modes and superradiantly reflected ( @xmath21 ) left - moving modes .",
    "this is basically the klein paradox  @xcite  see  @xcite for a detailed explanation of the relationship between superradiance , the klein paradox and pair creation .",
    "note that the important ingredients for superradiance are essentially the same as in the rotating black hole case : firstly , there is no left - moving mode at @xmath22 ( this is similar to the boundary condition at the event horizon of a black hole , where no outgoing solutions are allowed ) ; secondly , the form of the electromagnetic potential allows for low - frequency right - moving modes to be associated with left - moving particle number currents at @xmath22 .",
    "in order to study how a modified dispersion relation affects superradiance , we shall first generalize the simple , non - dispersive , 1 + 1-dimensional model above  @xcite by including fourth - order terms in  ( [ kg0 ] ) .",
    "inspired by the quartic dispersion relation @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is a dispersive momentum scale and the @xmath25 notates super and subluminal dispersion respectively , we propose the following generalization of  , [ kgmod ] _",

    "since our model is non - dissipative , we expect such a quantity to exist @xcite .",
    "in fact , by calculating the @xmath28-component of the noether current associated with the symmetry @xmath35 , it is possible to show that the expression [ wrons_ggg ] z[f]=w_1+w_2 ^ 2w_3 , where @xmath36 generalizes the notion of the wronskian and the functional @xmath37 is the conserved quantity commonly referred to as wronskian . for klein  gordon fields , the wronskian can be interpreted as the particle number current . ] to our dispersive model , i.e.  @xmath38 for any solution @xmath26 of  .",
    "furthermore , it is convenient to work with the scaled functional @xmath39 whose action on a function @xmath26 is defined by x[f]= [ gen_wronskian ] . in particular , the action of @xmath39 on a linear combination of ` on shell ' plane waves ( wavenumbers satisfying the dispersion relation ) is simply x=_n |a_n|^2 .",
    "[ action ] we would like to emphasize the simplicity of the algebraic expression above , which only depends on the amplitudes , effective frequencies and group velocities of the various scattering channels participating in the scattering process . throughout the paper , we shall refer to  ( [ action ] ) as the particle number current since it generalizes the usual notion of particle number current associated with a complex klein - gordon field .",
    "based on the general notion of superradiance described in the introduction , we will study the scattering process of incident waves originating from @xmath40 in the presence of a subluminal dispersion .",
    "in realistic scenarios , we do not expect the dispersion relation @xmath41 to have a maximum / minimum value above / below which only imaginary solutions of the dispersion relation are possible .",
    "therefore , in order to guarantee that at least one real mode is present in the dispersion relation , we assume that the dispersion parameter @xmath24 is large compared to the electromagnetic interaction , i.e.  we assume that @xmath42 . in such situations , the behaviour of the solutions to   in the asymptotic limits is captured in fig .",

    "we can also see in fig .",
    "[ step1 ] that the @xmath66 channel even becomes non - superradiant for some frequencies in the range @xmath94 .",

    "note also that the total reflection coefficient in the dispersive case is not continuously connected with the non - dispersive regime .",
    "more precisely , as @xmath24 is increased in fig .",
    "[ step11 ] , the total reflection coefficient becomes larger and larger and moves away from the non - dispersive coefficient ( @xmath95 ) .",
    "a possible explanation for this behaviour resides in the fact that the subluminal dispersion relation itself is not continuously connected to the linear dispersion relation in the limit @xmath96 . in other words , the modes @xmath86 and @xmath87 which are always absent in the non - dispersive case ,",

    "compared to the non - dispersive result , one might expect extra terms related to the exponentially decaying modes . however , these extra contributions are also exponentially decaying and , therefore , their particle number currents are negligible at @xmath104 . as a consequence ,",
    "one obtains the following reflection coefficient ( valid for @xmath105 ) , [ wrk2 ] |r|^2 = 1 + || |t|^2>1 , which , similarly to the subluminal case , is always greater than one .",
    "note also that the expression above reduces to the usual non - dispersive reflection coefficient in the limit @xmath96 .     for the superluminal case as a function of @xmath79 calculated for the step potential @xmath80 with @xmath81 . like in the subluminal case ,",
    "the divergence at @xmath82 is caused by the discontinuity in @xmath15 and would be absent if a smooth potential were used .",

    "using appropriate boundary conditions at @xmath83 ( see the appendix ) , one can relate the coefficients in   to the wavenumbers given in  , @xmath106 once again , it is useful to plot the reflection coefficient as a function of @xmath0 for different values of the dispersive parameter @xmath24 , see fig .",
    "[ step2 ] .",
    "the results obtained for the scattering of sub and superluminal dispersive fields in our 1 + 1-dimensional toy - model demonstrate that superradiance is possible and that the amplification is enhanced due to the extra scattering channels in comparison with non - dispersive superradiance .",
    "these results are interesting for experimental attempts of detecting superradiance , since they indicate that dispersion may increase the amplification rates and , consequently , make the effect easier to observe .",

    "following the standard procedure used in quantum mechanics ( see e.g.  @xcite ) , we integrate the differential equation over a small region @xmath260 around the discontinuity @xmath83 and then take the limit of the obtained expression as @xmath261 . starting from   and repeating this procedure three times , one can show that @xmath262 and its derivatives up to third order are all continuous at @xmath83 .",

    "<S> motivated by analogue models of classical and quantum field theory in curved spacetimes and their recent experimental realizations , we consider wave scattering processes of dispersive fields exhibiting two extra scattering channels . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we investigate how standard superradiant scattering processes are affected by subluminal or superluminal modifications of the dispersion relation . </S>",
    "<S> we analyze simple 1 + 1-dimensional toy - models based on fourth - order corrections to the standard second order wave equation and show that low - frequency waves impinging on generic scattering potentials can be amplified during the process . in specific cases , by assuming a simple step potential , we determine quantitatively the deviations in the amplification spectrum that arise due to dispersion , and demonstrate that the amplification can be further enhanced due to the presence of extra scattering channels . </S>",
    "<S> we also consider dispersive scattering processes in which the medium where the scattering takes place is moving with respect to the observer and show that superradiance can also be manifest in such situations . </S>"
