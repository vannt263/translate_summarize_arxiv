    "the strength of the qubit - tls coupling indicates that the tls was located close to the cpb josephson junctions , either in the tunnel barrier itself or on the surface of the cpb island .",

    "the vertical lines at @xmath127 and @xmath128 are due to the resonant crossing between the qubit parabolas and the resonator line at @xmath35 .",
    "although the fits are reasonable and capture all of the major features , the fit parameters contain one surprise .",
    "if we assume two independent fluctuators , the simplest assumption in light of the strong shielding of electric fields in the dielectric of the josephson junction by the superconducting electrodes , then we would expect @xmath129 and @xmath130 while @xmath131 .",
    "however our fit yields @xmath132 while @xmath130 and @xmath133 which suggests coupled tls s or more complicated microscopic behavior .",
    "furthermore , we note that several of the tls parameters , such as the charge coupling @xmath134 , change values when switching from the single to the double tls model .",
    "this indicates that the two tls model is needed to explain the full quadrupled spectrum and suggests that there is significant interaction between the tlss .",
    "there are some noteworthy implications from the magnitude of the fit parameters .",
    "first , we note that @xmath135",
    ". the large relative size of @xmath76 to @xmath48 suggests that the junction tunnel barrier is non - uniform with a few dominant conduction channels and that the tls is located near and modulates one of these channels.@xcite second , the tls tunneling matrix element @xmath136{ghz}$ ] is small compared to the other energies in the system , indicating that the tls is tunneling between fairly well isolated sites .",
    "we can also place a lower bound on @xmath47 by noting that for @xmath137{ghz}$ ] the spectra would be too faint to observe .",
    "if the excited state of such a tls were resonant with the first excited state of the cpb , the resulting avoided crossing would be very small and difficult to resolve .",

    "this is in agreement with the bounds of @xmath144  found by z. kim , _",
    "et al_.    discrete critical current fluctuators have been reported in current biased josephson junctions , identified via either a random telegraph signal in the voltage time trace or a signature lorentzian bump in the noise spectrum.@xcite one way we can compare our tls s to others is to calculate the effective defect area @xmath145 given by @xmath146 . for our device find @xmath147{nm^{2}}$ ] where @xmath148{nm^{2}}$ ] is the junction area .",

    "if we assume that the conductance of a tunneling channel is similar between the various devices , this is consistent with a small number of tunneling hot spots in our junction .",

    "our fit values then place an upper bound on the tls excited state lifetime of @xmath161{ms}$ ] .",
    "this bound is consistent with a relatively long tls lifetime and with our qubit @xmath162{\\text{\\textgreek{m}}s}$ ] .",

    "only when both the qubit and tls decay rates are small , as is our case , will the system decay time be long in both parabolas .",
    "finally it s worthwhile to speculate why this behavior was observed in our sample . in order to observe spectral twinning rather than an avoided crossing",
    ", the tls needs to be coupled to the qubit but have a transition frequency less than @xmath101 . that this occurred is a statistical coincidence .",
    "observing two such defects in the same sample is less likely , and the tls fit parameters suggest they are correlated . furthermore , we are biased in selecting samples for detailed study that have especially conspicuous features , such as large avoided crossings or anomalous spectra , and the parameter values of such samples are likely to be somewhat unusual .",
    "while our simple model provides a good fit to the recorded spectrum , it leaves other questions unanswered .",
    "the resonator was nt included in the model but some of our observations suggest that it may produce significant effects on the spectrum .",
    "inclusion of the resonator in the model would allow a theoretical calculation of the expected dispersive shift and a comparison with the data .",
    "a more complete model may also elucidate the role , if any , the resonator played in the the large difference in the visibility of the different parabolas when the qubit was tuned from below to above the resonator @xmath35 or the `` dead zone '' we observed between @xmath114{ghz}$ ] where no spectrum was visible . perhaps the most puzzling feature was that half of the spectral parabolas were nt visible when measured with a pulsed probe .",
    "unfortunately additional data on this issue was nt obtained .    in conclusion",
    "we have examined the transition spectrum of a cpb that had an anomalous quadrupling of the spectral lines .",

    "<S> we report on the quadrupling of the transition spectrum of an @xmath0 cooper - pair box ( cpb ) charge qubit in the @xmath1{ghz}$ ] frequency range . </S>",
    "<S> the qubit was coupled to a quasi - lumped element al superconducting resonator and measured at a temperature of @xmath2{mk}$ ] . </S>",
    "<S> we obtained good matches between the observed spectrum and the spectra calculated from a model hamiltonian containing two distinct low excitation energy two - level systems ( tls ) coupled to the cpb . in our model , each tls has a charge that tunnels between two sites in a local potential and induces a change in the cpb critical current . by fitting the model to the spectrum </S>",
    "<S> , we have extracted microscopic parameters of the fluctuators including the well asymmetry , tunneling rate , and a surprisingly large fractional change ( @xmath3 ) in the critical current ( @xmath4{na}$ ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> this large change is consistent with a josephson junction with a non - uniform tunnel barrier containing a few dominant conduction channels and a tls that modulates one of them . </S>"
