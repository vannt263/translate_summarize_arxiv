    "the ly@xmath2 blob ( lab ) remains one of the great mysteries of the high redshift universe . while these extended nebulae are similar in extent ( 5 - 20@xmath3 or @xmath450 - 150 kpc ) and flux ( 10@xmath5 ergs s@xmath6 ) to high - redshift radio galaxies , blobs are radio quiet and are therefore unlikely to arise from interaction with jets .",
    "they are found almost exclusively within high - redshift galaxy over - densities @xcite with none found so far at even moderate redshift ( z@xmath70.8 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , suggesting strong evolution .",
    "after more than a decade of searching , there are still only a handful of the truly giant ( @xmath850 arcsec@xmath9 , @xmath85@xmath1010@xmath11 ergs s@xmath6 ) labs known .",
    "however , deep searches @xcite show that the blobs are part of a continuous size distribution of resolved emitters .    with most lying at the density peak of high redshift structures @xcite and with number densities comparable to galaxy clusters in the nearby and high - z universe ( 10@xmath1210@xmath13 mpc@xmath14 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , it seems likely that the giant labs are at the very least signposts for regions of massive galaxy assembly , if not the progenitors of the massive elliptical galaxies themselves .",
    "the limited _ hst _ imaging of these objects to date shows some evidence for interaction and merger of multiple compact objects @xcite .",
    "major mergers of high - mass galaxies , like those predicted to build giant ellipticals , must be occurring at higher redshift ( i.e. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the lab may represent an opportunity for the study of the merger formation of the most massive galaxies .",
    "one of the biggest unknowns of the blobs is the source of their energy .",
    "@xcite found that for at least a third of labs , including all the biggest and brightest of them , the galaxies within the blob do not emit enough rest - wavelength uv light to excite such a vast quantity of hydrogen gas .",
    "the exciting ultraviolet illumination could be escaping along different lines of sight from an obscured agn @xcite .",
    "many labs contain luminous x - ray counterparts @xcite , while others show powerful agn emission lines @xcite .",
    "alternatively , outflows could be driving great plumes of gas into the surrounding ambient medium and producing shocks .",
    "while agns are known to drive some outflows , supernova - driven superwinds are also a viable model @xcite .",
    "such outflows would likely take the form of immense bubbles or shells expanding outwards from the galaxy , some evidence of which has been claimed in the brightest labs @xcite .",
    "integral field spectroscopy of the labs show the large velocty widths and structure consistent with superwind outflows @xcite , although the systems are complicated enough that other velocity models , like rotation , can not be completely ruled out .",
    "cooling flows have also been suggested as a possible source of the extended emission @xcite . the primary evidence to support the cooling model are labs with no apparent internal power source , even out to the mid - infrared @xcite , and sources with he ii emission with weak to no measurable civ emission @xcite , indicative of the lower temperature gas emission that one would expect from a cooling flow @xcite .",
    "mid - infrared and submillimeter imaging show that it is very common that the extended nebulae of labs contain sources of extreme infrared luminosity . powerful _ spitzer _",
    "24  sources have been found within roughly ten labs , and almost all the most luminous ones , @xcite , with fluxes of 0.05 - 0.86 mjy .",
    "submillimeter flux has been measured for a similar number @xcite .",
    "mid - infrared colors suggest significant quantities of hot dust for these infrared - bright sources @xcite , although whether from agn or extreme star formation remains unclear .    in this paper",
    "we discuss mid - infrared and submillimeter observations of mid - infrared sources identified within labs from four different fields , with @xmath15=2.38 - 3.09 .",
    "we examine both their _ spitzer _ mid - infrared flux ratios and mid - infrared to sub - mm flux ratios and compare them to models in order to identify their likely power source , agn or star formation .",
    "we then look at _ spitzer _ irs spectra of 6 sources for an even more definitive agn / star formation separation . finally , we look at the possible masses of these infrared sources from within the labs .",
    "we assume an @xmath16=0.3 , @xmath17=0.7 universe with h@xmath18=70 km s@xmath6 mpc@xmath6 .",
    "because of their rarity , most labs are discovered in small numbers , often one or two at a time .",
    "this has led to a naming system where the labs in question are often just referred to as blob 1 or blob 2 , if they are given any specific name at all .",
    "that creates a problem for a work such as this one , where multiple labs are being discussed from multiple fields , all known as blob 1 or lab1 or b1 or something similar .",
    "since labs are large , they occasionally have multiple counterparts associated with them , which can make it even more difficult to identify the correct object under discussion .",
    "to address this issue we will use the following naming system in this paper .",
    "all labs will be referred to as :    lab[number][letter]_j[coordinate of associated field center ]    the _ [ number ] _ used is that which has been associated with the lab in previous publications , if there has been any .",
    "if no previous number has been assigned we will begin the labeling at lab1 and count upwards from there . in many cases ,",
    "the original numbering included all the detected emitting sources in the field so just because there is a lab6 does not indicate there must be a lab5 . while these \" missing ",
    "numbers might create some mild confusion , we found this system to be superior to the certain confusion that would result from changing the numbers that have already been used to identify these sources from one paper to the next .",
    "the _ [ letter ] _ refers to the counterpart of the lab being discussed .",
    "most blob counterparts have only one associated counterpart and will therefore be given no letter identifier , so the existence of a letter implies that at some point in the literature , multiple components have been assigned to the lab .",
    "discussions of the labs themselves will never be given a letter .",
    "the _ [ coordinate of the associated field center ] _ is an eight digit code giving the right ascension and declination ( j2000 ) of the field with which the lab is associated .",
    "most of these fields have been observed multiple times with slightly different centers , but for this paper we have chosen j2217 + 0017 , j1714 + 5014 , j1434 + 3317 , and j2143 - 4423 to represent the ssa22 , 53w002 , ndwfs , and j2143 - 4423 fields in this study ( see below ) .",
    "we found this method of only providing a field coordinate superior to a full 12 - 14 digit coordinate designation as it makes the discussion of object names significantly less cumbersome and keeps a clear connection with the field and/or structure they have been found within .",
    "table 1 provides the list of all the lab infrared counterparts included in this paper , providing both the new name as well as any previous names by which the labs have been known .",
    "the labs presented in this paper are spread across four different fields : j2143 - 4423 , ssa22 , 53w002 , and the noao deep wide - field survey .",
    "we assembled all available _ spitzer _ mid - infrared imaging data , which includes both irac and mips imaging .",
    "the data for the j2143 - 4423 field ( lab1_j2143 - 4423 , lab6_j2143 - 4423 , lab7_j2143 - 4423 ) come from go-3699 ( pi : colbert ) and were done in a 3 @xmath10 5 raster map covering 15@xmath19 @xmath10 25@xmath19 , centered at @xmath2= 21@xmath2042@xmath2135@xmath22 , @xmath23 = -44@xmath2427@xmath19 ( j2000.0 ) . the total integration times per pixel were 1800 s for irac channels 1 - 4 and 1818 s for mips 24 .",
    "this reached 3 @xmath25 depths of 1 , 7 , and 40 @xmath26jy for 4.5 , 8 , and 24  respectively .",

    "* ) we examine the 16 labs with both an isophotal area greater than 20 square arcseconds and submillimeter data coverage , excluding only lab4_j2217 + 0017 which lies too close to a bright object for an uncontaminated analysis .",
    "we assembled the _",
    "spitzer _ imaging from multiple programs taken at different epochs , centered roughly at @xmath2= 22@xmath2017@xmath2140@xmath22 , @xmath23 = + 00@xmath2417@xmath19 ( j2000.0 ) .",
    "the irac and mips data come from four programs : go 30600 ( pi : colbert ) , go 3473 ( pi : blain ) , and gto 64 & gto 30328 ( both pi : fazio ) .",
    "the irac data was previously presented in @xcite , but we re - extracted the photometry to ensure uniformity among our several fields and also extracted to slightly deeper ( 3@xmath25 ) depths .",
    "the mips data presented here includes new data ( go 30600 , see below ) not presented in @xcite , covering more sources and greatly increasing the 24  depth .",
    "the ssa22 irac data from gto 64 was a deep pair of single pointings covering most of the known ssa22 blobs , gto 30328 was a 3 @xmath10 4 raster map , while go 3473 was a smaller 2 @xmath10 3 raster map that lies to the east of the majority of the known lab positions .",
    "altogether the combined irac image maps out a region roughly 20 @xmath10 26 arcminutes , ranging in depth from 1500 to 15,000 seconds .",
    "most of the labs lie at depths of 4000 s or greater , roughly corresponding to 3 @xmath25 depths of 0.5 and 5 @xmath26jy at 4.5 and 8  respectively .",
    "only one of the sub - mm detected blobs ( lab10_j2217 + 0017 ) completely falls off the area covered by irac .",
    "the ssa22 mips data from gto 64 is a single pointing ( 1120 s ) , gto 30328 is a 3 @xmath10 3 map built from a set of cluster offsets ( 1200 s per pixel ) , and go 3473 was a set of pointings targeting known sub - mm galaxies ( 1200 s ) . go 30600 consisted of two parts .",
    "the first was a set of three pointings targeting the sub - mm detected blobs on the outskirts of the previously taken 24  data ( 2700 s each ) .",
    "the second part was an extremely deep pointing on the central portion of the field ( 10,800 s ) where the biggest labs ( lab1_j2217 + 0017 & lab2_j2217 + 0017 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) are located .",
    "assembled altogether the mips data covers an area roughly 15 @xmath10 26 arcminutes , with the regions covering the lab locations ranging from 1200 - 13,000 seconds , with all sub - mm detected labs observed for at least 3300 seconds , which provides a 3 @xmath25 depth of 30 @xmath26jy .",
    "the 53w002 field , centered at @xmath2 = 17@xmath2014@xmath2120@xmath22 , @xmath23 = + 50@xmath2415@xmath19 ( j2000.0 ) , contains two labs @xcite .",
    "the irac data come from gto 211 ( pi : fazio ) and were obtained in a single pointing of 3300 s in all four irac bands .",
    "the mips data are a combination of go 3329 ( pi : stern ) , a single 500s pointing , and go 20253 ( pi : i m ) , a much deeper exposure of 18720 seconds .",
    "the 3 @xmath25 depths obtained are 0.6 , 5 , and 12 @xmath26jy for 4.5 , 8 , and 24  respectively , not accounting for the effect of confusion noise which becomes significant in such a deep 24 pointing .",
    "both blobs in the field have mid - infrared counterparts that are bright enough that confusion is not an issue .",
    "the noao deep wide - field survey ( ndwfs ) contains one reported bright blob @xcite , located at @xmath2 = 14@xmath2034@xmath2111.0@xmath22 , @xmath23 = + 33@xmath2417@xmath1931@xmath3 ( j2000.0 ) .",
    "we do not attempt to re - reduce or extract new photometry for this source and use the irac and mips fluxes already reported in @xcite .",
    "both the irac and mips data were combined using the mopex package available from the _ spitzer _ science center ( ssc ) . for the irac data we started with the artifact - mitigated ( .cbcd ) files where available ( gto 30328 ) . for the programs that had not been yet been reprocessed above pipeline s16 ( the first .cbcd files begin at s17 , released jan .",
    "08 ) , we used the basic bcd and applied the irac artifact mitigation code ( available from the ssc ) ourselves . for our extragalactic fields , which contain very few bright stars or extended sources",
    ", we saw no significant difference between the two methods .",
    "we then removed a residual offset from each frame by subtracting the median of each frame itself ( i.e. , removing a constant sky ) , medianing all the subtracted frames , and then subtracting that resulting offset frame from all the original frames .",
    "this prevents a gradient from appearing in the final images .",
    "this is the data product we place into mopex to produce the final , combined image .",
    "for the mips data , a median flat was created from all available data taken near in time , normalized , and divided into each image .",
    "after the overlap correction module was executed by mopex we found that we still had some trouble getting all the various sky levels to match up , so an additional sky constant was also subtracted before final combination of all the mips frames .      the optical and nir data for the j2143 - 4423 field ( u , b , g , r , j and h ) were acquired at the cerro tololo inter - american observatory ( ctio ) 4 meter telescope , using the mosaic ii imager , and the near infrared side port imager camera ( ispi ) .",
    "the seeing ranged from 0.91.4@xmath3 , reaching depths of 26 for u and b , 24 in r , and 23 in j and h. for further details see @xcite .",
    "all magnitudes are ab magnitudes here and throughout the paper .      as part of the _ spitzer _ go 30600 , we targeted all known bright ( @xmath8 200 @xmath26jy ) 24@xmath26 m sources associated with labs , including the those within the j2143 - 4423 110 mpc filament structure at @xmath15=2.38 @xcite and one within the possible proto - galaxy structure around radio galaxy 53w002 at @xmath15=2.39 @xcite .",
    "altogether we targeted five mid - infrared sources associated with four blobs .",
    "lab6_j2143 - 4423 contains two powerful mips 24  sources @xcite , both of which have been confirmed to be at the redshift of the blob @xcite . at the time of observation there was one more known mid - infrared bright ( 0.86 mjy at 24  ) lab1_j1434 + 3317 discovered in the noao deep wide - field survey by @xcite for which irs spectra had already been taken .",
    "we include its irs data as part of our analysis . the complete list with coordinates is presented in table 2",
    ".    there are no @xmath8 200 @xmath26jy 24@xmath26m - emitting labs in the most well studied lab field of all , the @xmath15=3.09 ssa22 field @xcite , despite many of them having significant sub - mm detections .",
    "this is likely the result of the strong 7.7  feature having shifted out of the mips 24  filter . for these sources",
    "we only examine their mid - ir to sub - mm ratios .",
    "the mid - infrared spectra were all taken with the _ spitzer _ infrared spectrograph ( irs ) using the 1st order of the long - low module ( ll1 ) , which is sensitive from 19.5 - 38.0 .",
    "the ll1 module has a spatial resolution of 5.1/arcsec per pixel and a wavelength resolution of r=58 - 116 , with the @xmath27 an approximately constant 0.17  per pixel .",
    "the aperture of the ll1 long slit is 10.7@xmath10 168 arcseconds .",
    "the irs data were acquired from the _ spitzer _ cycle 3 go 30600 program , mostly taken june 13 - 21 , 2007 , although one spectrum ( lab18_j1714 + 5015 ) was taken september 16 , 2006 .",
    "these spectra were acquired using the irs spectral mapping astronomical observation template ( aot ) , placing the source at six separate positions along the length of the slit , each separated by 20 .",
    "a high accuracy peak - up observation on a nearby 2mass star was done for each observation .",
    "we used the 120 second ramp exposure throughout , producing total exposure times per source of 84  528 minutes .",
    "we began our data reduction with the basic calibrated data ( bcds ) produced by the spitzer pipeline s16.1 .",
    "a significant latent charge builds up on the detector over long observations that varies depending on wavelength . to correct this we measure a median background value for each wavelength row and then fit a slope to the change in background with time . using the slope at each wavelength we derive the corresponding latent build - up for each frame and subtracted it .",
    "we then averaged together all the exposures taken at the same position within each astronomical observation request ( aor ) , producing six two - dimensional spectra per aor .",
    "we also produced a separate sky frame for each position using all the images taken at the other five positions medianed together .",
    "we subtracted each sky frame from the its corresponding image and then ran the program irsclean , provided by the _",
    "science center ( ssc ) , in order to remove all remaining rogue pixels or cosmic ray strikes .",
    "we then extracted the one - dimensional spectra for all six positions using the optimal extraction option within the ssc tool spice ( v.2.1.2 ) .",
    "we used a smaller than standard aperture ( 5 pixels at 27 , width scaling with wavelength ) , in order to avoid flux from two nearby bright sources and to reduce the inclusion of noise from blank sky .",
    "this non - standard aperture alters the spice generated calibration , but we use the known 24  fluxes for final calibration so this was not an issue .",
    "the initial sky subtraction does not always produce a perfect zero background and can not account for contamination from brighter , nearby sources . to address this we extracted one dimensional sky spectra using the same method and aperture as that for the sources , only offset by 30 arcseconds .",
    "two sky spectra , one from each side , are extracted , except for the spectra closest to the edge of the slit , where only one is extracted .",
    "we median all the sky spectra together and apply a 1.7  wide boxcar smoothing , before subtracting this one dimensional sky from the extracted source spectra .",
    "this secondary sky subtraction adds 2 - 5% to the noise of the the extracted source spectra , but can make significant corrections to the spectral shape , particularly in the two cases ( lab1_j2143 - 4423 and lab7_j2143 - 4423 ) with bright nearby sources .",
    "finally , we average the spectra from all the positions into a final spectrum using a 2 sigma clipping . in the case of lab1_j2143 - 4423",
    "the data was taken in two aors with slightly different roll angles .",
    "this minor difference in position angles produced a large difference in the contamination from a nearby quasar , producing significantly more noise ( 60% higher ) .",
    "therefore we applied a variance weighting to the combination the lab1_j2143 - 4423 spectra .",
    "in all the other cases the noise was constant across spectra and no weighting was required .    as part of our analysis",
    "we also include one irs spectrum ( lab1_j1434 + 3317 ) taken as part as part of the gto 15 program in february and june of 2005 .",
    "this spectrum was taken using the irs staring aot , which takes exposures at two separate positions along the slit length , separated by 55 arcseconds .",
    "because of the smaller number of positions , instead of subtracting a two - dimensional medianed sky from each position we simply subtracted one nod from the other .",
    "we also note the bcds were produced by the s15.3 pipeline .",
    "otherwise the data reduction is identical to those spectra taken in irs spectral mapping mode .",
    "the labs are large and commonly cover multiple irac sources , so we used the positions of the brightest irac 8  sources as the likely source of any 24  or 850  emission .",
    "this approach produced a good match between the centers of the associated 8 and 24  sources in all cases where both are strongly detected .",
    "for sources with no 8  detections within the blob ( 5 sources from ssa22 ) , the position of the 3.6  source within the lab is used .",
    "none of the sources without 8  detections had 24  or 850  detections , meaning they are not included in most of the following analysis of flux density ratios .",
    "two sources had multiple strong 8  sources , each with measurable 24  fluxes , within the lab : the lab6_j2143 - 4423 @xcite and lab1_j2217 + 0017@xcite . for the case of lab6_j2143 - 4423 ,",
    "an examination of the full sed and irs spectra ( see * ? ? ? * and below ) reveals that the counterpart lab6a_j2143 - 4423 is powered by an agn while lab6b_j2143 - 4423 is powered by star formation , making it almost a certainty that the sub - mm flux identified at that position is coming from lab6b_j2143 - 4423 and all further analysis assumes that .",
    "the two sources in lab1_j2217 + 0017 , on the other hand , have very similar mid - ir colors , so it is not possible to discriminate from which 8  source the submillimeter might have originated . using both ovro and vla 21 cm observations , @xcite found emission near the most northern of the two 8  objects ( lab1a_j2217 + 0017 ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "however , there is evidence that the 850  flux for this source is likely distributed across multiple sources@xcite , indicating that the second 8  source ( lab1b_j2217 + 0017 ) may also be a significant contributor to the total submillimeter flux . for our analysis of 24/850",
    "we therefore combined the two sources together ( see more below ) .",
    "mips 24  photometry was derived from prf - fitting using apex , part of the _ spitzer _ mopex software tool @xcite . in cases of 24  non - detections we extracted limits from the data using the known 8  positions .",
    "the rest of the photometry was done using apertures . for the u ,",
    "b , r , j , & h bands , we derived the flux densities using apertures of radius 1.5@xmath10fwhm ( 1.72 , 2.10 , 1.95 , 1.35 , 1.35 ) . for the irac channels 3 and 4 , we used a 3.6aperture , but for channels 1 and 2 we used a 2.4aperture to avoid crowding issues .",
    "all the above apertures only required moderate aperture corrections of 10 - 22% .",
    "substantial submillimeter imaging has been published on many of the major fields known to contain labs , including the @xmath15=3.09 ssa22 field @xcite , the @xmath15=2.38 j2142 - 4423 cluster @xcite , and the @xmath15=2.39 53w002 field @xcite .",
    "the ssa22 field was imaged at 850  using the submillimetre common user bolometer array ( scuba ) on the james clerk maxwell telescope reaching 1@xmath25 noise limits of 1.5 mjy using the pointed photometry mode and 5.3 mjy from a more shallow scan - map .",
    "five blobs were detected with fluxes ranging from 4.9 - 16.8 mjy @xcite .",

    "* ) and atacama submillimeter telescope experiment ( aste ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) observations of the brightest blob ( lab1_2217 + 0017 ) in the field .",
    "the j2143 - 4423 cluster was imaged at 870  ( 345 ghz ) using the laboca @xcite instrument installed on the atacama pathfinder experiment ( apex , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) reaching a 1@xmath25 point source sensitivity of 1.47 mjy , depending on distance from center of the field .",
    "lab7_j2143 - 4423 is robustly detected ( 8.41.0 mjy ) , while lab6_j2143 - 4423 is only marginally detected ( 4.9 2.0 mjy ) .",
    "the scuba 850  observations of the 53w002 field reach 1 - 1.5 mjy noise levels and detect one of the two known blobs there ( lab18_j1714 + 5015 ; 5.60.9 mjy ) .    for ease of discussion , the rest of the paper will use 850  to describe either the 850  scuba data or the 870  laboca data .",
    "it is assumed that at the level of accuracy of the reported sub - mm fluxes there are no measurable differences between the two sub - mm bands .",
    "we present the flux densities of all the lab counterparts presented in this paper in table 1 .",
    "the mid - infrared properties of warm ulirgs , those dominated by agn radiation , are significantly different than those of cool ulirgs powered by star formation .",
    "the seds of warm ulirgs rise rapidly and steadily through the mid - infrared , roughly obeying a power law , while the cool ulirg seds do not rise steeply until far into the mid - infrared ( @xmath8 10@xmath26 m ) .",
    "the other significant difference is the presence of strong polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon ( pah ) features in cool ulirgs , which can be compared to the continuum to determine the fraction of infrared luminosity generated by star formation @xcite .    because of these mid - infrared color differences , plots of _ spitzer _ mid - infrared irac colors can be powerful tools for identifying agn and separting them from starbursts at low redshifts @xcite . by including mips 24",
    "one can then continue this analysis to much higher redshift ( i.e. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we plot all the mid - infrared sources associated with labs that have 8  detections in figure 1 , which is a comparison of the 24/8  flux density ratio to the 8/4.5  flux density ratio .",
    "both @xcite and @xcite created just such a mid - infrared color - color plot for their respective samples of labs and submillimeter galaxies .",
    "the rectangular box represents the region @xcite identified as the location of sources starburst - dominated in the mid - infrared .",
    "the higher 8/4.5  flux ratios are generally only obtainable by agn , as only their seds should be that steep at these high redshifts ( z@xmath82 ) .",
    "submillimeter sources with similar redshifts to the labs in this study , taken from @xcite , have very similar 24/8 and 8/4.5flux ratios , with mean colors that are the same , to within one standard deviation , as that of the lab counterparts presented in figure 1 .    for comparison we over - plot a series of models derived from ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter ce01 ) .",
    "as ce01 is based on low redshift infrared galaxies , we applied an evolution in specific star formation to account for the expected build - up of stellar mass with time , a factor of ( 1+z)@xmath28 . this redshift evolution roughly matches the evolution in integrated specific star formation found for the massive galaxies studied by @xcite , erring on the side of more conservative ( i.e. less ) evolution .",
    "stronger evolution in specific star formation would produce larger 24  to 8  ratios , moving the star formation ends of all the models upwards on the plot .",
    "the ce01 models cover a range in luminosity , so we selected three that are representative of that entire range . changing",
    "exactly which models are plotted makes no difference to the results or discussion we present here .",
    "finally we mixed the star forming ce01 sed models with the sed of an agn ( mrk 231 ) to produce a range of ratios from agn to star formation - dominated . on the plot",
    "the models start to the left and/or high above as pure star formation and converge on pure mrk 231 around 8/4.5  2 .",
    "the z=2.4 models ( solid lines ) cover a much larger range in 24/8ratio than the z=3.1 models ( dotted lines ) because of the possible presence of the large 7.7pah feature at that redshift .",
    "nearly two thirds ( 59% ; 10 of 17 ) of the lab - associated sources fall within the star - formation rectangle , 29% have mid - infrared colors clearly indicative of agn , while the two remaining sources ( 12% ) are borderline , but likely also contain significant agn contribution . on the surface",
    "this would indicate that the majority of sources associated with labs are powered by starbursts .",
    "however , even an agn dominant in the infrared can still have significant contribution from stars at rest wavelength 1 which has the effect of flattening its slope considerably , i.e. it decreases the 8/4.5  ratio .",
    "for instance , the mrk 231 ratios presented here ( the converging end point of the models we plot in figure 1 ) differ somewhat from the mrk 231 model ratios presented in @xcite , particularly at z3 .",
    "this is likely a result of their use of a mrk 231 model based only on mid - infrared data ( a @xcite mid - infrared spectrum combined with a fit to _ infared astronomical satellite _ photometry ) .",
    "the mrk 231 model we use comes from a multi - component fit @xcite that includes the critical stellar component fit to near - infared data points , which has a strong effect on the resulting 8/4.5  ratio at z@xmath82 .",
    "in addition , at these redshifts these ratios are extremely sensitive to hot dust , which one would expect to be dominated by any agn , even if the agn was not a significant contributor to the total infrared luminosity .",
    "alternatively , an extreme starburst can also produce a large amount of emission from hot dust , which could produce similar irac colors to an agn @xcite .",
    "this diagnostic plot makes no direct measurement of the far infrared luminosity , the source of which we are trying to determine .      at the redshifts of labs with sub - mm imaging ( @xmath15=2.4 - 3.1 ) ,",
    "850  is sensitive to rest - wavelength 200 - 250 , past the peak of far infrared cold dust emission , where flux density is beginning to fall like a rayleigh - jeans law ( f@xmath29 ) . _",
    "spitzer _ mips 24  observations are sensitive to the rest wavelength 6 - 7mid - infrared , blueward of the far - infrared peak and very sensitive to both hot dust and the presence of pahs ( although less so for pahs at the higher redshift , see discussion below ) . _",
    "spitzer _ irac observations at these redshifts are not really sensitive to dust emission but instead can be dominated by stellar emission . in particular , 8  is roughly equivalent to rest wavelength k - band , an excellent tracer of total stellar mass .",
    "the combination of _ spitzer _ mid - infrared with submillimetre flux densities , each being sensitive to a different temperature regime ( stars , hot dust , cold dust ) , can do a great deal to reveal the likely power sources of the infrared - bright galaxies within the blobs .",
    "in particular , a simple color - color plot ( ratio of mips 24  to 850  sub - mm versus ratio of mips 24  to irac 8) can be a powerful tool for discriminating agn from star formation , as well as getting a picture of the specific star formation ( sfr per unit mass ) .    in figure 2 we plot the ratio of 24  to 850  sub - mm versus ratio of 24  to 8  for the three fields listed above that have both blobs and deep sub - mm coverage .",
    "any source without a 24  detection is not plotted . in the case of lab6_j2143 - 4423",
    "there are two mips 24   sources with confirmed @xmath15=2.38 redshifts @xcite ) , so both sources ( lab6a and lab6b ) are included on the plot , but the submm detection has been assigned to lab6b_j2143 - 4423 ( as described above ) .",
    "similarly , lab1_j2217 + 0017 is associated with two equally bright 8  sources ( lab1a and lab1b ) .",
    "due to the large sub - mm beamsize it is not possible to deduce which source is likely associated with the 850  flux and , of course , both may be .",
    "we have therefore combined the 8  and 24  fluxes of lab1a_j2217 + 0017 and lab1b_j2217 + 0017 into a single source for the purpose of this plot . if all the sub - mm flux were to originate in the slightly fainter 24  source ( lab1a_j2217 + 0017 ) the 24/850  ratio would go down by an additional factor of 3 , with very little change in 24/8 .",
    "we overplot the same ce01/mrk231 mixed models as used in figure 1 .",
    "we marked the ratio of star formation luminosity to agn luminosity for one of the models , running from 1.0 ( 100% starburst ) upwards to 0.0 ( 100% agn ) contribution from star formation to the total bolometric luminosity .",
    "all eight of the sub - mm detected components for labs have mid - ir / sub - mm ratios consistent with star formation .",
    "an additional six of the blob components are only upper limits , but only two of those ( lab6a_j2143 - 4423 and lab19_j1714 + 5015 ) are clearly outside and above the locus of star formation , consistent with irs spectrum of lab6a_j2143 - 4423 ( see below , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the broad line nature of lab19_j1714 + 5015 @xcite .",
    "this submillimetre evidence for significant quantities of cool dust in labs was previously noted by @xcite , who found that all but one of the ssa22 8  sources they studied were detected at 850  as well . that strong trend does not hold true for our sample , where 6 of 14 of our lab counterparts are detected at 8  but not at 850 but that could be at least partially attributable to the slightly different depths and redshifts in our study .",
    "this plot strongly indicates that the majority of these infrared - bright components of labs are not powered by agn alone , but there are two important caveats .",
    "first , the present sensitivity limits of submillimeter surveys are just barely deep enough to conduct this experiment .",
    "not only are nearly half the sources not detected at all , but none of the actual detections are that strong , ranging from 2.5 - 8 @xmath25 , with half of 4@xmath25 significance or less .",
    "fortunately the expected range of 24/850  ratio is large , especially at z=3.1 , allowing for a strong discrimination even with very large sub - mm errors .",
    "secondly , while the correction for mass evolution is likely generally correct , it is almost certain that there will be real variations in specific star formation history from galaxy to galaxy . on the plot",
    "this will move galaxies back and forth horizontally , which will change what models and agn / star formation percentage one would associate with it .",
    "this is not an important effect at @xmath15=3.1 , where the models are less degenerative and there is large separation in 24/850  ratio as the agn contribution is increased , but it can be a concern at @xmath15=2.4 .",
    "the mid - ir to sub - mm ratios at the @xmath15=2.4 are not as strong for discriminating the energy source because of the presence of the powerful pahs in the 24  filter , which can somewhat mimic the rising power law slope of an agn .",
    "for instance , lab18_j1714 + 5015 ( labeled in figure 2 ) appears to lie roughly in the neighborhood of the 93 - 98% star formation models .",
    "however , a change in the specific star formation of the nearby models by 30% would shift it towards the agn models such that it would only take a factor of 2 - 3 change in the 24/850  ratio ( either the model or through a measurement error ) to make this source agn - dominated .",
    "in fact , its irs spectrum ( see below ) suggests that it is completely agn - dominated . to similarly shift",
    "@xmath15=3.1 sources would require changes of factors of 10 - 20 in the 24/850  ratio .    for further comparison we also plot sub - mm galaxies spectroscopically confirmed at similar ( 5% in 1+@xmath15 ) redshifts from @xcite .",
    "the mid - infrared colors and mid - infrared to sub - mm ratios for the @xcite sub - mm galaxies are very similar to those from the lab sample , with the exception of one @xmath152.4 sub - mm source ( gn22 ) with a 24/850  color so cool it can not be easily explained by our simple set of models .",
    "three of these @xmath152.4 sub - mm galaxies also have irs mid - infrared spectroscopy ( gn04 , gn05 , and gn19 ; * ? ? ?",
    "all three have significant pah features , despite the fact that two of the three are detected in the hard x - rays .",
    "looking at the line - to - continuum ratios , @xcite found that only gn04 ( the source with the largest 24/850ratio included from their study ) had @xmath850% contribution to the mid - infrared energy output and they classified it as a mixed ( agn + starburst ) source .",
    "we note that one blob in our sample falls on the low end of the models .",
    "this is the @xmath15=3.09 @xcite lab1_j2217 + 0017 , which has a large reported sub - mm flux ( 16.82.9 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but is quite faint at 24  with a flux of only 7010 @xmath26jy .",
    "this is actually the combined 24  flux of the two bright 8  sources identified at this location @xcite .",
    "if split back into their two components the 24  fluxes are 25 and 47 @xmath26jy , so if the submillimeter flux came from just one of them the 24/850  ratio would be even more extreme .",
    "lab1_j2217 + 0017 was undetected in high spatial resolution observations ( 2@xmath3 ) taken with the submillimeter array @xcite , indicating that the 850  flux must be widely spread out or split into multiple sources .",
    "alternatively , the original measurement might be a several sigma deviation .",
    "aste - aztec 1.1 mm observations failed to detect it down to 10 mjy @xcite . however , even a factor of 10 less flux would still place lab1_j2217 + 0017 in the region dominated by star formation .      of the six sources associated with labs targeted with irs spectroscopy ,",
    "four show significant pah features . in order to measure individual pah emission lines",
    ", we used the idl pahfit software package @xcite , which fits all pah emission lines and continuum simultaneously .",
    "given the limited coverage of the data , we only include the pah lines in the fit that cover the wavelength range of interest ( 6 - 9 ) and a single red continuum .",
    "we chose this over the more direct method of isolating the region directly around each line of interest and fitting a line and continuum there ( i.e. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , as that can underestimate the equivalent widths by factors of up to 4 .",
    "fits to all six spectra are shown in figure 3 and all fluxes , equivalent widths , and line - to - continuum ratios are listed in table 3 .",
    "two of the spectra show no apparent pah features , with all line fits producing fluxes below the 1-@xmath25 uncertainty .",
    "these featureless sources are the counterpart lab6a_j2143 - 4423 ( previously reported in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and lab18_j1714 + 5015 @xcite .    the remaining four sources all show the 7 - 9  pah complex ( 7.4 - 8.7 ) at the expected location for their redshifts .",
    "the weakest pah detection is that of source lab1_j2143 - 4423 , with a 7.7feature ( defined as the combination of the 7.60 and 7.85  pah lines ) detection of only 2@xmath25 significance .",
    "however , the whole 7 - 9  complex for the lab1_j2143 - 4423 source is detected at 4@xmath25 significance .",
    "combined with their discovery at the appropriate wavelengths there is little doubt the pah features for lab1_j2143 - 4423 are real .",
    "we measured a 7.7  line - to - continuum ( l / c ) ratio for each source in order to test the contribution of any possible agn to the total infrared energy output .",
    "for ease of comparison we use the same method of @xcite , taking the average intensity of the line and continuum over 7.57 - 7.94 .",
    "the error in line intensity is just a quadratic sum of uncertainty in the data , but the error in continuum is dominated by the quality of the continuum fit , which has only two parameters , temperature and a normalization factor , for each of which the fitting routine returns an uncertainty . using a monte carlo method we take the two derived probability distributions of temperature and normalization factors to create a large distribution of average continuum intensities from which we measure a final rms .",
    "this continuum error is consistently large , often dominating the error in l / c .    using their l / c definition ,",
    "@xcite found that agn have l / c@xmath30 0.2 , pure starbursts have l / c@xmath30 3 , and the typical local ulirgs have l / c@xmath30 2 , indicating they are almost completely star formation dominated .",
    "the two sources from our suvey with no detected pah features have l / c ratios @xmath7 0.2 - 0.3 ( 2@xmath25 limits ) , clearly agn - dominated sources .",
    "the two with the most powerful pahs have l / c=5 - 6 . even accounting for large errors in l / c ( the lab7_j2143 - 4423 error is 50% ) ,",
    "it is clear these are star formation - dominated sources .",
    "the final two sources are a bit less clear . with a l / c of 0.80.2 , lab1_j1434",
    "+ 3317 appears to have its main mid - ir contribution from an agn , but the star formation component is far from negligible .",
    "for lab1_j2143 - 4423 , its l / c ( 1.50.7 ) , suggests a similar but opposite situation : the primary contribution is from star formation , but the agn component is significant . the large error on the lab1_j2143 - 4423",
    "l / c does add some further confusion , as a one sigma deviation could easily change the likely power source .",
    "another similar way to approach this problem is to look at the pah equivalent widths ( ew ) .",
    "we plot the 6.2  ew vs. the 7.7  ew in figure 4 .",
    "the 6.2  feature is less contaminated by nearby pahs and silicate absorption and therefore can be less vulnerable to the continuum model chosen .",
    "unfortunately , for most of our data the 6.2  feature lies near the noisier wavelength edge of the ll1 irs detector , limiting the information available for the continuum there .",
    "the 6.2  pah was also not always strongly detected for similar reasons . in the case of lab1_j2143 - 4423 , the 6.2",
    "pah emission is undetected , so instead we plot a 2@xmath25 upper limit .",
    "equivalent widths of pahs are extremely vulnerable to how the exact line fitting is done , as they are a combination of both the line measured and continuum fit assumed .",
    "a factor of 2 difference in measured fluxes can easily result in a factor of 4 difference in equivalent width .",
    "this can make it problematic to compare equivalent widths between studies that have not approached the measurement in a similar way .",
    "we therefore compare our four pah - detected sources to the @xmath15=1 - 3 ulirgs of @xcite , where they also applied a multi - component pah profile fit .",
    "some differences remain , as @xcite covered a longer range of wavelengths , which produces somewhat different continuum fits .",
    "our fits seem to be favoring a continuum that is slightly lower , leading to slightly larger ews .",
    "however , considering the large errors , the two methods produce similar results .",
    "the dashed lines on the figure ( 6.2  ew=0.2  and 7.7  ew=0.8 ) are also from @xcite and represent suggested dividing lines between strong - pah ( i.e. star forming ) and weak - pah sources ( i.e. agn - like ) .",
    "only 25% of the @xcite high - z ulirg sample fell into the strong - pah ( they are half the sources on the plot , but that is misleading as 7.7  limit - only objects are not plotted ) , as opposed to half of our sample ( our two pah - free sources are not plotted ) .",
    "while the lines are mainly a device to assist comparison between studies , they do appear to be in rough agreement with what we found looking at 7.7  l / c ratios .",
    "star formation rates can be derived from pah luminosities ( i.e. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , although the uncertainties and unknowns increase with redshift and luminosity .",
    "using the 7.7  to total infrared luminosity formulas suggested by @xcite for their sample of submillimeter galaxies , we derive star formation rates and/or limits for our six sources ( see table 3 ) . as already discussed above ,",
    "our method of fitting all pah features and continuum simultaneously produces larger pah fluxes than if one just fit a continuum locally around each pah emission feature , as @xcite did for their sample .",
    "therefore if we simply put our derived luminosities into the @xcite formulas we would certainly be overestimating the star formation rate . for our 4 detected 7.7  emission features , we found a mean correction factor to our fluxes of 1.7 if we use a method similar to that of @xcite .",
    "we apply this correction , dividing the 7.7  luminosities in table 3 by a factor of 1.7 , before applying the formulas of @xcite .",
    "we find star formation rates in our pah - detected sample ranging from 420 to 2200 m@xmath1 yr@xmath6 , significantly larger than the limits we found for our two non - pah sources which were @xmath7 130 - 140 m@xmath31 yr@xmath6 . while these rates are derived from the 7.7  fluxes , the 6.2  feature can also be used to derive total infrared luminosity and , consequently , sfr . while our 6.2  feature detections are generally quite weak , the star formation rates derived from them agree with those from 7.7  within the errors .",
    "the most discrepant source is that of lab1_j1434 + 3317 , which despite having a low l / c ratio does have the brightest 7.7  luminosity of the sample . while technically within the errors , its 6.2  luminosity points toward a sfr closer to a 1000 m@xmath1 yr@xmath6 .",
    "none of the other 6.2  sfr estimates are off by more than a few hundred m@xmath1 yr@xmath6",
    ". this could be due to lab1_j1434 + 3317 being such a strongly mixed ( starburst and agn ) source or perhaps because it is such a highly luminous mid - infrared source .",
    "both are known to affect conversion from pah luminosity to far infrared luminosity @xcite .",
    "we can then ask the question whether these star formation rates are enough to power the labs .",
    "star formation might cause the labs in two different ways : photoionization from lyman continuum photons escaping from the galaxy and supernova - driven outflows into the surrounding medium , producing shocks .    for photoionization",
    "we can estimate the number of ionizing photons produced from the @xcite models which use a high mass cutoff of 100 m@xmath1 .",
    "assuming an age greater than 15 myr ( after which the number of ionizing photons produced by continuous star formation become roughly constant ) , for every 1 m@xmath1 yr@xmath6 the young stars will generate 9@xmath1010@xmath32 ionizing photons s@xmath6 .",
    "the predicted luminosity is therefore :    @xmath33 \\times ( 9\\times 10^{52 } ) \\mbox { ergs s}^{-1}\\ ] ]    where h@xmath34 for is 2.58@xmath1010@xmath35 ergs , 0.6 is the fraction of absorbed lyman continuum photons that will be re - emitted as photons , and f@xmath36 is the fraction of lyman continuum photons that can escape from the galaxy . for a sfr of 1000 m@xmath1 yr@xmath6",
    "we predict 1.4@xmath1010@xmath37 ergs s@xmath6 .",
    "for @xmath38 near unity one could power most blobs with the ionizing continuum from the starbursts , but such a high escape fraction for the lyman continuum is highly improbable for these sources where most of the energy is coming out as reprocessed dust emission .",
    "the majority of rest frame ultraviolet photons are certainly not escaping along our line of sight .",
    "if we apply a more conservative @xmath38 = 0.1 then there are not enough ionizing photons from star formation escaping to produce any of the labs with pah - emitting sources presented here , with deficits ranging from factors of 2 to 13 .    for supernova - driven outflows we start by estimating the number of supernovae generated per year .",
    "again using the @xcite models we estimate 5@xmath1010@xmath14 sn per m@xmath1 yr@xmath6 . if each supernova produces 10@xmath39 ergs ,",
    "then star formation is generating roughly 1.7@xmath1010@xmath40 ergs s@xmath6 for every m@xmath1 yr@xmath6 .",
    "this is enough energy to power the labs , but we still have to account for the efficiency of the conversion of the supernova energy into kinetic outflows .",
    "@xcite indicates that as much as 7090% of the supernova energy will be radiated away , leaving only 13@xmath1010@xmath41 ergs of kinetic energy remaining .",
    "if we account for this efficiency our typical 1000 m@xmath1 yr@xmath6 infrared lab counterpart will generate 25@xmath1010@xmath11 ergs s@xmath6 . except for the most pessimistic assumptions",
    ", there appears to be enough supernova energy available to power two of the three star formation dominated labs , with only lab1_j2143 - 4423 falling short by nearly a factor of 4 .",
    "we note that a more top heavy imf with larger mass upper limits will produce both more supernovae and ionizing photons .",
    "while this will certainly produce more photons , it is unlikely the imf could be radically different enough from our assumptions to change the results .",
    "so while star formation can not quite photoionize enough photons to generate labs , there is enough energy in supernova outflows to do so , but not in all cases .",
    "the requirement for detection at 24  clearly has the potential to introduce a bias into our analysis . without a powerful 7.7  feature",
    "the 24  flux of @xmath15=2.4 sources would generally be less , likely removing it from this sample ( @xmath80.2 mjy ) altogether .",
    "one known @xmath152.4 lab , lab19_j1714 + 5015 @xcite , was excluded because its 24  flux density is not above 0.2 mjy , just missing our cut .",
    "it is a known broad line agn @xcite which likely dominates its mid - infrared output .",
    "however , that is the only 24-observed lab at redshift @xmath423 known at the time of our program that was not observed by irs .",
    "unfortunately the number of known labs at redshifts below @xmath15=3 remain very small ( roughly a dozen ) , so we must not draw too many conclusions from such a small sample . of those galaxies associated with labs that are bright at 24  ,",
    "half have strong pahs and appear to be star formation dominated .",
    "none of the labs in the higher redshift @xmath15=3.09 ssa22 field had bright 24  fluxes , but at their redshift the powerful 7.7  pah feature moves beyond the mips 24filter which instead becomes sensitive to the continuum below 6 . that is a region of the spectrum of galaxies that is generally dominated by hot dust , meaning at this higher redshift",
    "one might expect a reverse of the selection bias : brighter 24will indicate a stronger hot dust component , i.e. a greater contribution from agn .",
    "four of the five ssa22 blobs ( 80% ) with luminous x - ray counterparts @xcite are detected at 24  ( 40 - 160 @xmath26jy ) , as opposed to the remaining ten non x - ray luminous sources observed with mips 24 , for which only four ( 40% ) are detected ( 50 - 80@xmath26jy ) .",
    "we wish to provide one final word of caution on the use of pah flux to continuum ratios for trying to breakdown the total bolometric output for such powerful , high - redshift objects .",
    "it is entirely possible that star forming galaxies , forming at rates of more than 1000 m@xmath43/yr might produce significant quantities of hot dust emission without agn ( i.e. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and/or produce conditions that destroy the grains that produce pahs ( i.e , * ? ? ?",
    "however , the continued discovery of pahs in bright , high - z sources ( i.e. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) suggests the issue of pah destruction is likely not a serious problem .",
    "if anything , there appears to be evidence that the brightest , high - redshift galaxies are over - producing pahs compared to their lower redshift , less luminous counterparts @xcite .    whether we measure _ spitzer _ photometry ratios , compare mid - infrared to submillimeter fluxes , or examine the strength of pahs using irs spectroscopy , we consistently find a very similar answer : half to 2/3 of all lab counterparts appear to have their infrared luminosity powered mainly by star formation .",
    "this does not prevent powerful agn from also existing within these sources or rule agn out as a source of the extended emission .",
    "however , with such large reservoirs of starburst energy it does make star formation - driven lab models , such as superwind outflows , a much more likely power source for the majority of labs .",
    "several lines of evidence suggest that labs mark regions of massive galaxy assembly : their location at the peak of high redshift structures @xcite , their number densities comparable to galaxy clusters in the nearby and high - z universe ( 10@xmath1210@xmath13 mpc@xmath14 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the freqent indicators of merger and/or interaction @xcite .",
    "one possiblity is that they could be a phase in the formation process of massive elliptical galaxies themselves . _",
    "spitzer _ irac data provides us with rest wavelength measurements of the 1 - 2  portion of the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of the infrared components of the labs being analyzed in this paper .",
    "this is ideal for estimates of mass , lying at the peak of stellar light output while minimizing the effects of dust extinction .",
    "however , the mass - to - light ratio ( m / l ) can change significantly , even at these wavelengths , for the young objects that one might expect to find in the early universe .",
    "robust mass estimates require a good age estimate , so therefore most studies perform a full sed fit to estimate the age in order to derive a m / l ratio and total mass .",
    "previous measurements of lab counterpart masses regularly find the brighter labs to be around 10@xmath0 m@xmath1 @xcite .",
    "@xcite measured masses for seven ssa22 labs , deriving masses from their k - band data ranging from 4@xmath1010@xmath44  1.1@xmath1010@xmath0 m@xmath1 , which they found to be roughly correlated with the luminosity of the labs within which they resided .",
    "in addition , both lab1_j2143 - 4423 @xcite and lab6b_j2143 - 4423 @xcite have undergone a full sed fitting analysis , producing masses of 1.5@xmath10 10@xmath0 m@xmath1 and 4@xmath1010@xmath0 m@xmath1 respectively . in the case of lab1_j2143 - 4423",
    "there were two fits done , one to each major component , but as we are unable to resolve the two components in the coarser irac data used in this study we report only the combined mass here .    a full sed fitting is not possible for all galaxies associated with the labs , due to the paucity of the some of the necessary deep data  especially the near - infrared  for the different fields . for instance , the 4000  break , one of the more critical features for age estimation , lies entirely in the near - infrared at the redshifts of the labs . more importantly , even with full spectral coverage , sed fits can suffer from agn - contamination and age / dust extinction degeneracy , both of which will strongly effect any mass determination . even measurements of the 4000  break , which are robust for measuring the age of older populations , will fail to provide accurate ages for young starbursts , like those likely present at the high energies and early universe epoch we are studying .",
    "we therefore decided to examine the mass upper limits for our lab counterparts .",
    "almost all of the galaxies in our study are covered with the four irac channels , covering the rest - frame 1.1   both at @xmath45 and at @xmath46 .",
    "we convert the 1.1  luminosity to stellar masses assuming a simple single stellar population model @xcite with no dust . in order to compare galaxies at different redshifts ,",
    "we have computed maximally old stellar population models at the observation redshift , assuming @xmath47 formation redshift .",
    "the derived masses , therefore , provide an upper limit to the real stellar masses , since they are computed under the assumption that all the 1.1  luminosity is due to old stars .",
    "to give an idea how much this could overestimate the masses we can compare to the sed model fit done for the x - ray detected labs in ssa22 of @xcite .",
    "they found that a relatively young sed model with 100 myr of continuous star formation history and an extinction of a@xmath48 = 1.5 was the best fit for their x - ray emitting sources .",
    "if this same model applied to all the lab counterparts , their masses would be lower by a factor of 5.7 at @xmath15=3 and 6.7 at @xmath15=2.4 than our plotted maximum mass limits .",
    "however , for the cases of a couple of our brighter sources ( lab1_j2143 - 4423 and lab6b_j2143 - 4423 ) the upper limits are within a factor of 2 of the masses previously derived from a full sed fit @xcite . of",
    "the ssa22 lab counterparts included in both our study and that of k - band study of @xcite , the typical difference is a factor of 2 - 2.5 , although two sources have very large disparities ( lab7_j2217 + 0017 & lab16_j2217 + 0017 ) , for which the difference is closer to a factor of 8 - 10 .",
    "the 4.5/8  ratio of lab16_j2217 + 0017 suggests it may contain an agn , so these may be examples of agn contamination .",
    "lab7_j2217 + 0017 is too faint to apply any of our infrared agn / starburst diagnostic ratios .",
    "an analysis using these mass upper limits has another advantage .",
    "if the lab components are all of similar formation era , whatever that may be , then they should have very similar 1.1  m / l ratios and their masses _ relative _ to one another would be accurate no matter when exactly they all formed .",
    "we plot these mass upper limits versus the luminosity of the blob within which they are found in figure 5 .",
    "the errors plotted are just from the photometry and do not represent the significant uncertainties resulting from the model m / l ratios , choice of formation redshift , etc . in cases of more than one mid - infrared source ( lab1_j2217 + 0017 and lab6_j2143 - 4423 ) both",
    "are plotted with the same luminosity .",
    "the clearest result is that there are no low mass , high luminosity sources .",
    "in fact , one could split the blobs into two groups : a bright ( @xmath82@xmath1010@xmath11 ergs sec@xmath6 ) , high mass sample and a faint ( @xmath72@xmath1010@xmath11 ergs sec@xmath6 ) sample with no strong preference for mass which does not quite reach the most massive end of the lab sample .",
    "this lack of bright , low mass sources would continue to hold true even if one were to reduce the masses of the bright sources by the factor of 6 suggested for the @xcite x - ray labs , while leaving the masses of the faint sources unchanged .",
    "the limited mass fitting by ourselves and previous studies ( i.e , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) suggest that if there is any systematic difference in the m / l ratio with flux , it is actually the bright sources that tend to have higher",
    "m / l , which would make this split stronger .",
    "this possible split is similar to the two populations proposed by @xcite , infrared luminous and infrared faint , which they based mainly on whether the counterpart possessed an 8  detection .",
    "their conclusion that the infrared luminous lab counterparts had large hot dust contributions from agn and/or intense starburst ulirg activity while the infrared faint counterparts resembled cooler , pure star formation systems , does not appear to apply as well to luminosity or mass .",
    "our plotted sample shows evidence for agn contribution throughout the entire range of luminosity studied and all but the faintest end of the mass limits .",
    "however , the @xcite study does include the smallest and faintest of the ssa22 blobs which we removed from our study .",
    "the presence of a bright agn would contaminate the rest wavelength 1.1  and produce masses much higher than are actually present in stars .",
    "we have marked all those sources with irac colors indicating agn ( this includes our three agn - dominated irs spectra ) in red .",
    "we also mark the two borderline agn cases from figure 1 in yellow .",
    "finally we circle all the x - ray detected blob counterparts from @xcite .",
    "if these potential contaminant labs were removed from the sample , a weak trend appears with the most massive sources associated with the brightest luminosities .",
    "however , with only 10 sources and the general uncertainties in both agn contamination and actual mass this trend is far from confirmed .    while it is unlikely that the masses of these mid - infrared components all lie at their upper limits , it is clear many are quite large , around 10@xmath0 m@xmath1 .",
    "massive galaxies with substantial ( @xmath80.5 gyr ) ages are not unusual at these redshifts @xcite . some of our largest masses could be a combination of a close pair , like those known to be in lab1_j2143 - 4423 @xcite . in another case , lab1_j2217 + 0017 , the two sources are barely distinguishable at the irac resolution , so it would not be that surprising to find others that could not be .",
    "whether a single galaxy or some sort of merging / interacting pair ( or more ) , the total mass of all the galaxies is likely indicative of the size of the potential well in which the galaxy is assembling .",
    "the weak correlation of mass and luminosity , if real , would indicate a correlation between the size of this potential well and the energy source that is powering the blob .",
    "if the lab is a cooling flow one would expect a direct correlation of potential well to luminosity , but that does not rule out stellar wind or agn illumination models , as a greater potential well might be expected to drive more gas inflow causing star formation or feeding a supermassive black hole .",
    "mid - infrared _ spitzer _ ratios ( rest frame near and mid - ir ) indicate that 60% of lab counterparts are consistent with being cool starbursts , while the rest have a substantial hot dust component that one would expect from an agn , although extreme starbursts are a possibility in some cases . including submillimeter observations ( rest frame far infrared ) in the analysis comes to a similar conclusion : roughly 2/3 of lab counterparts are consistent with the total bolometric energy output",
    "being dominated by star formation .",
    "irs spectroscopy of six of the brighter ( and lower redshift ) sources found 4 of 6 to have measurable pahs .",
    "the other two were featureless power law spectra indicative of agn - domination .",
    "of the four detected , two had l / c ratios and pah ews suggestive of mixed sources , with energy contributions from both star formation and supermassive black hole accretion .    in general ,",
    "the stellar masses of the lab counterparts are quite large , around 10@xmath0 m@xmath1 .",
    "there is a weak trend with the luminosity of the host blob",
    ". this could be suggestive of two populations of lab : one luminous and generally massive and one fainter and slightly less massive , but generally covering a wide range of stellar masses .",
    "alternatively , the lab counterparts could be one continuous population , with mass growing with luminosity .",
    "indications of agn are seen at all luminosites and all but the smallest masses .",
    "a lot of the work on labs has been spent trying to determine the energy source that powers them . not only would that allow us to understand the physics of these giant clouds of extended emission , but could possibly provide valuable information on the assembly of massive galaxies , including questions of agn feedback , escaping ionizing radiation , and/or cooling flows .",
    "it has been theorized that labs could be a short lived evolutionary step in the life of most galaxies at these redshifts @xcite .",
    "the halo could be powered by star formation superwinds , growing larger and larger until the central agn grows enough to blow out most of the gas and cutting off the lab s power source @xcite .",
    "the problem with trying to place all the observed labs in an evolutionary sequence is that again and again the blobs resist efforts to link them to a single power source . while @xcite found five labs were strong x - ray sources , their further submillimeter analysis suggested that even for these objects , the total bolometric output for the galaxy is dominated by star formation .",
    "the presence of agn , seen in many labs , could just be confusing the analysis or maybe indicating a future evolutinary stage .",
    "our own analysis of submillimter and mid - infrared data suggests a great deal of the lab infrared counterparts show no indication of a significant hot dust component , again pointing towards star formation , but there are several significant exceptions .",
    "the irs spectra from this study reveal two lab infrared counterparts each with an unambiguous , featureless agn mid - infrared spectrum .",
    "two other sources have similarly unambiguous powerful pah , star dominated mid - infrared spectra . if the infrared counterpart is the power source for the lab , it is difficult to see how there could possibly be a single explanation for what powers all blobs .",
    "evolutionary scenarios that leave the halo behind while the internal galaxy changes over to a new energy source ( like an agn turning on ) are probably not viable due to the rapid cooling time of the ionized gas halo ( 1 - 2 myr ) .",
    "we note that for lab6_j2143 - 4423 there is both an agn and a star formation dominated counterpart , so those particular irs spectra do not contradict the single power source model .",
    "the estimated star formation rates for the pah - emitting labs generate enough energy in supernova outflows to power two of the five labs we observed using irs .",
    "neither agn nor cooling flows are needed to explain the emission for these powerful pah sources .",
    "more generally , cooling flow models may deposit too much mass onto their galaxies , depending on the exact duty - cycle of the halo @xcite . however , there are several well studied , bright labs with no obvious infrared power source @xcite , for which cooling flows remain the most viable explanation .",
    "while more study is certainly required , we would suggest that the data to date do not point to a single , uniform source of power for the blob . instead of being a homogenous group of objects ,",
    "all created in the same way , the labs are likely a heterogenous group , with different power sources depending on the object .",
    "what labs likely all have in common is their environment : the dense , gas - rich infall zones at the centers of high redshift over - densities where the most massive galaxies are being born . outflows or photoionization from intense star formation may drive the majority , but agn almost certainly play a important role in others . cooling flows could account for only a small minority of those seen , which would allow shorter duty - cycles and fewer issues of mass deposition .",

    "<S> the mid - infrared ratios ( 4.5/8  and 8/24 ) indicate that 60% of lab infrared counterparts are cool , consistent with their infrared output being dominated by star formation and not active galactic nuclei ( agn ) . </S>",
    "<S> the rest have a substantial hot dust component that one would expect from an agn or an extreme starburst . comparing the mid - infrared to submillimeter fluxes ( 850  or rest frame far infrared ) </S>",
    "<S> also indicates a large percentage ( 2/3 ) of the lab counterparts have total bolometric energy output dominated by star formation , although the number of sources with sub - mm detections or meaningful upper limits remains small ( 10 ) . </S>",
    "<S> we obtained infrared spectrograph ( irs ) spectra of 6 infrared - bright sources associated with labs . </S>",
    "<S> four of these sources have measurable polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon ( pah ) emission features , indicative of significant star formation , while the remaining two show a featureless continuum , indicative of infrared energy output completely dominated by an agn . </S>",
    "<S> two of the counterparts with pahs are mixed sources , with pah line - to - continuum ratios and pah equivalent widths indicative of large energy contributions from both star formation and agn . </S>",
    "<S> most of the lab infrared counterparts have large stellar masses , around 10@xmath0 m@xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> there is a weak trend of mass upper limit with the luminosity of the host blob , particularly after the most likely agn contaminants are removed . </S>",
    "<S> the range in likely energy sources for the labs found in this and previous studies suggests that there is no single source of power that is producing all the known labs . </S>"
