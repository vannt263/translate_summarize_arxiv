    "in order to give an answer to the question , `` what is the origin of the interest of the asymptotic dependence of elliptic random variables ? '' one has to go back several dozen years .",
    "+ already in the years 1950 s and 1960 s researchers discovered the non - normal behaviour of financial market data . in the early 1990 s an understanding of the methodology",
    "underlying financial or insurance extremes became very important .",
    "traditional statistics mostly concerns the laws governing averages .",
    "but when we look at the largest ( respectively the smallest ) elements in a sample , the assumption of normality seems not to be reasonable in the number of applications , particularly in finance and insurance .",
    "and heavy - tailed distributions have a chance to be more appropriate .",
    "let @xmath1 , @xmath2 be insurance claims due to flood disasters @xmath4 and wind storms @xmath5 .",
    "last year events taught us that very often the extreme values of @xmath1 are accompanied by extreme values of @xmath2 . in mathematical language",
    "it means , that@xmath1 and @xmath2 are asymptotically dependent .",
    "traditional models based on multidimensional normal probability law give rise to quite opposite conclusion . therefore in modelling of extreme events",
    "more and more often the researchers use the wider class of distributions , which includes the normal distribution as a special case . + let us now consider a simple example from finance market . on the figure below you see daily log - returns of stock indices",
    "dax and cac ( horizontal axis @xmath1-dax , vertical axis @xmath2-cac ) .",
    "the data cover the period from 1990 to 2004 ( about 4000 data ) .",
    "the scatter plot assumes a shape of `` elliptic cloud '' . and the level sets of the probability density , of the random vector @xmath6 , are ellipses . this empirical observation suggests , that the family of elliptic distributions should be taken under consideration .",
    "+        furthermore we can ask how often we observe the situation , when the daily log - returns of the both indices take the extreme values .",
    "+ let @xmath7 be the quantity of observations @xmath8 such that + @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the j - th order statistics of the random variable @xmath11 , @xmath12 .",
    "+    .,width=453,height=264 ]    the graph of the function @xmath7 shows us , that @xmath1 and @xmath2 are asymptotically dependent .",
    "so the joint random variable @xmath6 could nt be normally distributed .",
    "to begin with , we recall the basic definitions . + let @xmath13 be an univariate distribution function and @xmath14 its generalized inverse + @xmath15    let @xmath6 be a random vector with marginal distribution functions @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",

    "if @xmath21 , then we say that @xmath1 and @xmath2 are asymptotically independent .",
    "+ otherwise ( that is @xmath22 or @xmath23 does nt exists ) we say that , they are asymptotically dependent . +    for a pair of random variables upper tail dependence is a measure of joint extremes .",
    "that is they measure the probability that one component is at an extreme of size given that the other is at the same extreme , relative to the marginal distributions .",
    "+    if two continuously distributed random variables @xmath1 , @xmath2 are independent , then they are asymptotically independent .",
    "+ @xmath24    note that the bivariate normal distribution has the same property .",
    "+ the tail behaviour can be also described in a `` symmetric way '' .",
