    "in 1997 the scuba camera was commissioned at the 15-m jcmt in hawaii , providing 2.5-arcmin - wide images at wavelengths of 450 and 850@xmath0 m with resolutions of 7 and 15respectively .",
    "the mambo 1.25-mm camera at the 30-m iram telescope provides a similar capability ( see dannerbauer et al .",
    "2002 ) , while the 350-@xmath0 m sharc - ii and 1.1-mm bolocam cameras being commissioned at the 10-m caltech submillimeter observatory ( cso ) should provide significantly enhanced performance within a year . in the future , bolocam is expected to observe from the 50-m mm - wave gtm / lmt telescope under construction in mexico , a larger - format 8@xmath18-arcmin@xmath2 camera scuba - ii is being designed in the uk , and developments of mambo are planned for apex  a new 12-m telescope at the 5000-m alma site in chile .",
    "apex will join the 10-m - class japanese aste submm telescope at the alma site for which a large bolometer camera is being designed .",
    "scuba was the first submm camera able to survey fields large enough to detect the redshifted thermal dust emission from previously unknown galaxies ( smail , ivison & blain 1997 ) .",
    "the peak of the emission from galaxies , typically at 60200@xmath0 m in their restframe , corresponding to a range of dust temperatures between about 60 and 20k , is redshifted into scuba s observing bands .",
    "the steep submm rayleigh ",
    "jeans slope of the dust emission ensures that distant galaxies with similar bolometric luminosities and spectral energy distributions ( seds ) would produce similar flux densities at all redshifts from @xmath3 to @xmath4 , assuming the same spectral energy distribution ( sed ) .",
    "the detectability of galaxies does depend on the details of the sed , in general being greater for cooler temperatures at a fixed luminosity and redshift ( see blain et al .",
    "2002 ) .",
    "more than 300 high-@xmath5 submm galaxies ( smgs ) have now been detected by scuba and mambo , while bolocam ( glenn et al .",
    "1998 ) could detect new examples at a rate of order 1 per hour .",
    "various types of surveys have been made : in narrow fields to exploit the gravitational lensing effect of clusters of galaxies ( smail et al .",
    "2002 ; chapman et al .  2002a ; cowie , barger & kneib 2002 ) ; in the hubble deep field ( hughes et al.1998 ) ; and in wider shallower surveys ( eales et al .  1999",
    "; borys et al .",
    "2002 ; scott et al.2002 ) covering a total of about 0.25deg@xmath2 .",
    "these smgs are responsible for a significant fraction of the star - formation/ agn activity at @xmath6 ( blain et al .",
    "it is vital to understand their individual properties if we are to understand the formation of galaxies as a whole .",
    "their inferred space density is similar to that of giant elliptical galaxies in the local universe , and it has been suggested that they are high-@xmath5 formation events of these rare galaxies ( eales et al .",
    "1999 ) , presumably in the most massive dark - matter halos with the lowest specific angular momenta .",
    "it is more likely that they reflect a more common , short - lived phase involving the formation of galactic bulges in perhaps episodic mergers ( blain et al .",
    "the test of these ideas is to measure the redshifts , clustering properties and mass distribution of a representative sample of smgs .",
    "the coarse ( @xmath715 ) resolution of submm images ensures that there are many possible faint optical counterparts to the detected galaxy .",
    "hence , while some smgs have bright optical counterparts ( ivison et al . 1998 , 2000 ) , most remain unidentified at optical wavelengths .",
    "final confirmation of a correct identification in both position and redshift is provided by detecting ( sub)mm - wave co molecular line emission with a suspected redshift in the narrow spectral window of existing ( sub)mm - wave spectrographs ( frayer et al .  1998 , 1999 ) .",
    "mm - wave continuum interferometer images of the fields have reduced positional uncertainties to @xmath8arcsec for several smgs ( downes et al .",
    "1999 ; frayer et al .",
    "2000 ; dannerbauer et al .",
    "2002 ) , but are very expensive in observing time .",
    "deep near - ir imaging to @xmath9 tends to reveal plausible red counterparts for many smgs ( smail et al .",
    "1999 ; frayer et al .   2003 ) by their @xmath10 and @xmath11 colors .",
    "deep optical / near - ir spectroscopy of these galaxies can then be attempted to find redshifts .",
    "the most efficient technique for determining redshifts , however , appears to be to exploit very deep radio images . for reasonable seds ,",
    "smgs with 850-@xmath0 m flux densities of about 510mjy ( with luminosities @xmath12l@xmath13 ) should be detectable in @xmath14@xmath0jy rms 1.4-ghz vla images out to @xmath15 , if they lie on the far - ir  radio correlation observed for local galaxies ( condon 1992 ) : ( see barger , cowie & richards ( 2000 ) and chapman et al .",
    "( 2001 , 2002b ) .",
    "the wide field ( 0.25deg@xmath2 ) and accurate sub - arcsec astrometry of vla images , coupled with the low surface density of the faintest radio sources as compared with optically - selected galaxies yield accurate positions for a large fraction ( @xmath16% ) of the smgs brighter than 5mjy at 850@xmath0 m .",
    "this provides an opportunity for efficient multi - object optical spectroscopy . in march 2002",
    ", about 25 spectra were obtained using the keck - lris spectrograph ( chapman et al .",
    "these will be subject to co molecular line spectroscopy to confirm the identifications and to study both their gas masses ( via velocity dispersions ) and excitation conditions ( via line  line and line  continuum ratios ) , using mm - wave interferometers in the 2002 - 2003 northern winter .",
    "only a handful of reliable redshifts were available for smgs in 2001 : now it is likely that a luminosity function of these radio - selected smgs should be available in 2003 .",
    "the key target of investigating the smgs is now to find their physical properties , especially their masses .",
    "however , just obtaining a reasonably complete redshift distribution is important for fixing their form of evolution and ensuring their fractional contribution to the energy emission of all galaxies is correctly accounted for ( eales et al .",
    "1999 ; blain et al .",
    "1999a ) .",
    "as redshift surveys were generally unsuccessful until ( chapman et al .",
    "2003 ) , photometric techniques have been proposed to provide redshift information ( eales et al .",
    "1999 ; hughes et al .   1998 , 2002 ) .",
    "the key information available is radio ( carilli & yun 1999 ) , submm and mid-/far - infrared photometry , typically from vla , scuba and _ iso _ respectively .",
    "the _ iras _",
    "survey is not sufficiently deep to detect smgs ; _ iso _ data is deeper , but covers only a small area and is only useful for the closest ( soucail et al.1999 ) or brightest examples ( ivison et al .",
    "the _ sirtf _ space telescope will be ideal for finding far - ir seds .",
    "fitting a thermal spectrum to a galaxy at uncertain redshift leads to an unavoidable degeneracy between the inferred dust temperature @xmath17 and redshift @xmath5 .",
    "the peak wavelength of the sed is determined in the observers frame , but this is shifted in exactly the same way by either a fractional increase in @xmath17 or a corresponding fractional decrease in @xmath18 .",
    "this makes any far - ir / submm - based photometric redshift only as accurate as the knowledge of the temperature ( blain , barnard & chapman 2003 ) , and not to @xmath19 as claimed by hughes et al .",
    "( 2002 ) . despite non - thermal radio emission",
    "being due to an entirely different process , the submm  radio properties of galaxies on the far - ir  radio correlation conspire to produce a similar @xmath17@xmath18 degeneracy if @xmath20k ( blain 1999 ) .",
    "if a reliable link exists between dust temperature and luminosity , then it is possible to break this degeneracy ; however , the accuracy of the result is then determined by the scatter in the lt relation , which is likely to be at least 30% , implying at least this great an uncertainty in redshift ( blain et al .",
    "2003 ) .",
    "the addition of @xmath21-band near - ir data ( dannerbauer et al .",
    "2002 ) could also help , but first the intrinsic scatter in the ratio between the @xmath21-band and far - ir luminosity of the galaxies must be known . based on observations of fairly complete samples of smgs ( ivison et al .",
    "1998 ; frayer et al .  2003 ) , the k - band magnitudes are certainly scattered by as much as @xmath22mag .",
    "spectroscopic redshifts remain essential for accurate study of smgs .",
    "correct identifications of smgs via either samples of faint radio galaxies that feed targets to multi - object spectrographs or deep near - ir imaging and spectroscopy , must be confirmed and verified using mm - wave interferometers or single - antenna telescopes to detect co molecular rotational line emission at integer multiples of 115ghz in the galaxy s rest frame .",
    "there are other possibilities for obtaining spectroscopic redshifts , especially the direct detection of molecular or atomic fine - structure spectral lines at mid-/far - ir and submm wavelengths .",
    "the key is to obtain wide - band spectral coverage at these wavelengths , in order to allow searches for redshifts . at present",
    ", mm - wave spectrographs cover a total frequency range of only @xmath23 , and so a redshift must be known to well within 5% before confirmation can be made .",
    "powerful correlators for the 100-m gbt will allow searches for co(1 - 0 ) lines ( rest frequency 115ghz ) from high - redshift galaxies in the 22 & 44-ghz radio bands . at shorter submm wavelengths new very stable 230/345-ghz spectral line receivers at the cso",
    "will have @xmath14ghz bandwidths ( rice et al . in prep . ) .",
    "dispersive techniques may allow very - wideband , low - resolution spectrographs at millimeter or far - infrared wavelengths .",
    "these include the zspec and wafirs waveguide / grating concepts for space - borne and ground - based applications ( bradford et al . in prep ) .",
    "i thank vicki barnard , matt bradford , scott chapman , dave frayer , andrew harris , tom phillips , naveen reddy , frank rice , chip sumner and jonas zmuidzinas .",
    "work on a wide - band correlator for the cso is being supported by the caltech tolman endowment and the research corporation .",
