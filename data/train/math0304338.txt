    "-5 mm    the theory of continuous valuations on convex sets generalizes , in a sense , both the measure theory and the theory of the euler characteristic . roughly speaking",
    "one should think of a continuous valuation @xmath0 on a real linear space @xmath1 as a finite additive measure on a class of compact nice subsets of @xmath1 ( say piecewise smooth submanifolds with corners ) which satisfy the following additional property ( instead of the usual sigma - additivity ) : the restriction of @xmath0 to the subclass of convex compact domains with smooth boundary extends by continuity to the class @xmath2 of _ all _ convex compact subsets of @xmath1 . here",
    "the continuity is understood in the sense of the hausdorff metric on @xmath2 .",
    "remind that the hausdorff metric @xmath3 on @xmath2 depends on the choice of the euclidean metric on @xmath1 and it is defined as follows : @xmath4 where @xmath5 denotes the @xmath6-neighborhood of a set @xmath7 .",
    "this condition of continuity turns out to be very strong restriction and has a lot of consequences on purely algebraic level .",
    "these properties will be discussed in this paper .",
    "the simplest examples of such valuations are any smooth measure on @xmath1 and the euler characteristic .",
    "also it turns out that one of the main tools used recently in investigations of valuations is the representation theory of real reductive groups and the beilinson - bernstein theory of @xmath8-modules .",
    "now let us give the formal definition of valuation .",
    "\\a ) _ a function @xmath9 is called a valuation if for any @xmath10 such that their union is also convex one has _",
    "@xmath11    \\b ) _ a valuation @xmath0 is called continuous if it is continuous with respect the hausdorff metric on @xmath2 .",
    "_    the linear space of all continuous valuations on @xmath1 will be denoted by @xmath12 .",
    "it is a frchet space with the topology of uniform convergence on compact subsets of @xmath2 . in section 1",
    "we discuss its dense subspace of polynomial smooth valuations @xmath13 ( it has the topology of inductive limit of frchet spaces ) .",
    "it turns out that this space has a natural structure of associative commutative unital algebra ( when the unity is the euler characteristic ) . in section 2 we discuss the space @xmath14 of translation invariant continuous valuations .",
    "its dense subspace @xmath15 of so called smooth valuations is a subalgebra of @xmath13 .",
    "it has a natural grading and satisfies a version of poincar duality .",
    "this property follows from the irreducibility theorem 2.1.3 which is by itself key result in the investigation of valuations ( see subsection 2.1 ) .",
    "moreover _ even _ smooth translation invariant continuous valuations form a graded subalgebra of @xmath15 and satisfy a version of the hard lefschetz theorem ( subsection 2.2 ) .",
    "this property turns out to be closely related to the cosine transform problem in the ( gelfand style ) integral geometry solved recently in @xcite .",

    "the classical hadwiger theorem describes explicitly @xmath16- and @xmath17-invariant translation invariant continuous valuations on the euclidean space @xmath18 .",
    "the new result is the classification of unitarily invariant translation invariant continuous valuations on the hermitian space @xmath19 ( subsection 2.3 ) .",
    "the main application of the classification results on valuations is integral geometric formulas . using our classification",
    "we obtain new results in ( chern style ) integral geometry of real submanifolds of complex spaces ( section 3 ) .",
    "-5 mm    in order to study general continuous valuations let us remind the definition of _ polynomial _ valuation introduced by khovanskii and pukhlikov @xcite , @xcite .    _ a valuation @xmath0 is called polynomial of degree @xmath20 if for every @xmath21 the function @xmath22 is a polynomial on @xmath1 of degree at most @xmath20 .",

    "we will discuss properties of this space .",
    "-5 mm    it was shown by p. mcmullen @xcite that the space @xmath14 of translation invariant continuous valuations on @xmath1 has a natural grading given by the degree of homogeneity of valuations .",
    "let us formulate this more precisely .    _",
    "a valuation @xmath0 is called homogeneous of degree @xmath51 if for every convex compact set @xmath52 and for every scalar @xmath53 _",
