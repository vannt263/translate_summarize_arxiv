    "the advent of topological insulators have created an exciting interdisciplinary research field which is vitalized by discoveries of new materials to realize new concepts @xcite and hence is greatly helped by contributions from chemistry.@xcite the topological insulators are characterized by a gapped bulk state and gapless surface or edge states whose gapless nature is protected by time - reversal symmetry .",
    "soon after the discovery of topological insulators , it was recognized that a similar topological state is conceivable for superconductors which also have a gapped bulk state.@xcite already various schemes for realizing such a topological superconductor ( tsc ) have been discussed,@xcite inspired by the interest in exotic quasiparticles called majorana fermions which may show up in tscs .",
    "@xcite in particular , it has been proposed @xcite that superconductors derived from topological insulators are promising candidates of tscs due to the strong spin - orbit coupling which would lead to unconventional electron pairing . for superconductors of this category",
    ", a limited number of materials , such as cu@xmath11bi@xmath1se@xmath2,@xcite bi@xmath1te@xmath2 under high pressure,@xcite in@xmath11sn@xmath12te,@xcite cu@xmath11(pbse)@xmath13(bi@xmath1se@xmath2)@xmath14,@xcite sr@xmath11bi@xmath1se@xmath2,@xcite and tl@xmath13te@xmath2 @xcite have been discovered and studied .    among such candidate tscs , cu@xmath11bi@xmath1se@xmath2 was the first to show intriguing signatures of majorana fermions on the surface.@xcite the superconductivity in this material occurs as a result of cu intercalation into the van der waals gap of the parent bi@xmath1se@xmath2 compound . although superconducting cu@xmath11bi@xmath1se@xmath2 can be grown by a melting method,@xcite",
    "the superconducting volume fraction ( vf ) is typically very low ( up to @xmath520% ) in melt - grown samples .",
    "it was shown that an electrochemical synthesis technique@xcite yields samples with much higher superconducting vf ( up to @xmath570% ) near @xmath15 = 0.3.@xcite however , chemical differences between superconducting and nonsuperconducting samples of cu@xmath11bi@xmath1se@xmath2 are not understood .",
    "the superconductor phase is apparently unstable and it is easily lost by heat or mechanical strain , which makes it difficult to elucidate its exact crystal structure .",
    "very recently , it was found that bulk superconductivity can also be achieved in bi@xmath1se@xmath2 by intercalation of sr ; in the resulting sr@xmath11bi@xmath1se@xmath2 , the maximum transition temperature @xmath16 of 2.9 k and the superconducting vf of up to 90% have been reported .",
    "@xcite also , it has been reported that all the binary topological - insulator materials having the tetradymite structure , bi@xmath1se@xmath2 , bi@xmath1te@xmath2 , and sb@xmath1te@xmath2 , become superconductors under high pressure,@xcite although it is still to be elucidated how the crystallographic and electronic structures are altered before these systems show superconductivity under pressure .",
    "another interesting candidate of tsc is sn@xmath12in@xmath11te.@xcite this is derived from the topological crystalline insulator @xcite snte by doping in to the sn site , after which the topological surface states are still preserved .",
    "@xcite however , the topological superconducting state appears to be limited to a narrow range of @xmath15 and the condition for its realization is not clear at the moment .",
    "@xcite    to foster the research of tscs , further discoveries of candidate materials are desirable . in this regard , making bi@xmath1te@xmath2 superconducting in ambient pressure by doping would be very useful , because it allows for direct comparison to cu@xmath11bi@xmath1se@xmath2 or sr@xmath11bi@xmath1se@xmath2 . like bi@xmath1se@xmath2 ,",
    "pristine bi@xmath1te@xmath2 consists of covalently bonded quintuple layers ( qls ) having the stacking sequence of te - bi - te - bi - te , and those qls are held together by van der waals force , @xcite which is weak enough to allow for easy exfoliation .",
    "in contrast to bi@xmath1se@xmath2 in which superconductivity is known to show up upon intercalation of cu or sr , no robust superconductivity has been reported for intercalated bi@xmath1te@xmath2 , besides a preliminary report @xcite of a trace superconductivity in pd@xmath11bi@xmath1te@xmath2 which has not been confirmed by other groups . in this paper",
    ", we report that doping a large amount of tl to bi@xmath1te@xmath2 results in a superconductor with a transition temperature of 2.28 k. a large superconducting vf of up to 95% determined from specific - heat measurements gives evidence for the bulk nature of the superconductivity in tl@xmath0bi@xmath1te@xmath2 .",
    "this discovery could provide a new platform for addressing topological superconductivity .",
    "single crystalline samples with the nominal composition of tl@xmath17bi@xmath1te@xmath2 with various @xmath15 values were synthesized from high - purity elemental shots of tl ( 99.99% ) , bi ( 99.9999% ) and te ( 99.9999% ) .",
    "we focus on samples with @xmath15 = 0.6 in this paper , and results on other @xmath15 values are presented in the supporting information . before the synthesis , we performed surface cleaning procedures to remove the oxide layers formed in air on the raw shots of starting materials , as described in our previous paper .",
    "@xcite the raw materials were then mixed with the total weight of 4.0 g and sealed in an evacuated quartz tube .",
    "the sealed quartz tubes were heated up to 1123 k and kept for 48 h with intermittent shaking to ensure homogeneity of the melt .",
    "the tubes were subsequently cooled down to 823 k at a rate of 5 k / h and , then , quenched into ice - water .",
    "we also prepared a similar sample without quenching and found that quenching is essential for obtaining superconducting samples .",
    "large shiny single crystals with the lateral dimension of up to a few centimeters can be obtained by cleaving along the @xmath18 plane .",
    "the reference bi@xmath1te@xmath2 crystal was grown with the same method involving quenching .",
    "in addition , we also synthesized tl@xmath17bi@xmath19te@xmath2 with exactly the same method for comparison .",
    "the crystal structure was analyzed with x - ray diffraction ( xrd ) using @xmath202@xmath20 scan performed on rigaku ultima - iv x - ray apparatus .",
    "the rietveld analyses of powder xrd data were performed by using fullprof software package .",
    "the actual composition was analyzed by using inductively coupled plasma atomic - emission spectroscopy ( icp - aes ) as well as energy - dispersive x - ray spectroscopy ( edx ) .",
    "dc magnetic susceptibility was measured in a squid magnetometer ( quantum design mpms ) .",
    "the in - plane transport properties were measured by a standard six - probe method , recording the longitudinal resistivity @xmath21 and the hall resistivity @xmath22 simultaneously .",
    "the single crystal samples for transport measurements were cut into a rectangular shape with a typical size of @xmath23 0.2 mm@xmath24 , and electrical contacts were made by using room - temperature - cured silver paste .",
    "the specific heat @xmath25 was measured by a relaxation - time method using the physical properties measurement system from quantum design equipped with a @xmath24he probe ; the addenda signal was measured before mounting the sample and was duly subtracted from the measured signal .",
    "the @xmath25 measurements were done in 0 t as well as in various magnetic fields up to 2 t applied along the @xmath10 axis .",
    "bi@xmath1te@xmath2 and bi@xmath1te@xmath2 , showing ( 00@xmath26 ) reflections from cleaved single crystals ; inset shows an enlarged view of the ( 006 ) peak , which presents a clear shift to higher angle after tl doping .",
    "( b ) powder xrd data for tl@xmath0bi@xmath1te@xmath2 taken on powders prepared by crushing cleaved single crystals , together with the result of a rietveld refinement to consider a coexistence of bi@xmath1te@xmath2 and tlbite@xmath1 .",
    "red symbols denote the observed intenstities ; black and blue lines give the caculated and difference intensities , respectively .",
    "the upper and lower lines of vertical bars indicate the positions of the bragg reflections of the main and impurity phases , respectively . , width=321 ]    we found that quenched single crystals of tl@xmath0bi@xmath1te@xmath2 are invariably superconducting at low temperature .",
    "this composition suggests that tl atoms are intercalated in the van der waals gap of bi@xmath1te@xmath2 ; however , as we show in the following , the crystal structure analysis suggests that intercalation is _ not _ taking place .",
    "figure 1(a ) shows the xrd pattern of tl@xmath0bi@xmath1te@xmath2 measured on cleaved single crystals , along with similar data for pristine bi@xmath1te@xmath2 .",
    "the sharp reflections indicate good crystalline quality of our single crystals . only ( 00@xmath26 ) reflections can be observed with this method , and the peaks are easily indexed by considering the rhombohedral structure of bi@xmath1te@xmath2 . hence , after the doping of tl into bi@xmath1te@xmath2 , the crystal structure remains essentially the same as that of the parent compound .",
    "however , in contrast to the cases of cu- or sr - doped bi@xmath1se@xmath2 , in which those dopants are intercalated into the van der waals gap , the ( 00@xmath26 ) diffraction peaks in tl@xmath0bi@xmath1te@xmath2 shift to higher 2@xmath20 angles , as one can clearly see in the inset of figure 1(a ) .",
    "this means that the lattice parameter along the @xmath10-axis gets _ shorter _",
    "after tl doping .",
    "quantitatively , it decreases from 30.606(4 )  in bi@xmath1te@xmath2 to 30.438(9 )  in tl@xmath0bi@xmath1te@xmath2 .",
    "this observation suggests that intercalation is not taking place in tl@xmath0bi@xmath1te@xmath2 .",
    "note that the icp - aes analysis indicates the existence of nearly stoichiometric amount of tl in superconducting crystals , as shown in table s1 of supporting information .",
    "we also measured powder xrd patterns of tl@xmath0bi@xmath1te@xmath2 with cu @xmath27 radiation in bragg - brentano geometry on powders obtained from crushed crystals , and the results are shown in figure 1(b ) along with a rietveld refinement .",
    "( similar xrd data for smaller tl contents are shown in figure s1 of the supporting information without refinements . )",
    "we note , however , that after the grinding , the powdered samples are no longer superconducting .",
    "this suggests that the superconductor phase of tl@xmath0bi@xmath1te@xmath2 is unstable and is fragile against mechanical strain .",
    "furthermore , we observed that the superconducting volume fraction in tl@xmath0bi@xmath1te@xmath2 diminishes with time when the samples are left at room temperature , even though they are kept in inert atmosphere or in vacuum ; this suggests that doped tl atoms are mobile even at room temperature . in passing ,",
    "we have also tried to perform single - crystal xrd analysis , but tl@xmath0bi@xmath1te@xmath2 is so soft that preparations of small single crystals required for this kind of analysis resulted in deformed samples , making it impossible to obtain data of sufficient quality for the crystal structure analysis .",
    "the degradation of crystal quality was also apparent in powdered samples .",
    "as one can see in figure 1(b ) , the diffraction data are well described by two coexisting phases , bi@xmath1te@xmath2 and tlbite@xmath1 , when taking the preferred orientation correction into account .",
    "the tlbite@xmath1 phase possesses a volume fraction of about 35% .",
    "attempts to refine the occupation of the tl ions at the intercalation or other interstitial positions in the bi@xmath1te@xmath2 phase did not yield a significant occupation , in agreement with the observation that the @xmath10 lattice parameter is shorter than that in pristine bi@xmath1te@xmath2 .",
    "we find a significant amount of vacancies on the bi site ( about one third ) , which indicates a massive occupation of the te sites by bi or tl ions ( i.e. bi@xmath28 or tl@xmath29 antisite defects ) .",
    "note that bi and tl are indistinguishable in x - ray diffraction due to their similar atomic numbers .",
    "for the rietveld refinement , the structure of bi@xmath1te@xmath2 with symmetry @xmath30 ( lattice constants @xmath31 = @xmath32 = 4.3850(16 )  , @xmath10 = 30.438(9 )  , and @xmath33 = 120@xmath34 ) with additional tl positions was used .",
    "the position of the bi - atoms was refined to @xmath35 at the wyckoff position 6c , the positions of the te - atoms were @xmath36 at the wyckoff position 3a and @xmath37 at the wyckoff position 6c .",
    "no significant occupation of additional tl - atoms at @xmath38 or @xmath39 could be determined .",
    "all positions refer to the hexagonal setting of the rhombohedric cell .",
    "the tlbite@xmath1 impurity phase was also described in space group @xmath30 ( lattice constants @xmath31 = @xmath32 = 4.539(1 )  , @xmath10 = 22.617(8 )  , and @xmath33 = 120@xmath34 ) and only the @xmath40 position of the te site was refined to @xmath41 .",
    "although tlbite@xmath1 was reported to become superconducting below 0.14 k , @xcite this impurity phase can not be responsible for the appearance of the superconductivity in our samples , whose @xmath42 is above 2 k. it is also worth mentioning that elemental thallium metal is superconducting with @xmath16 of @xmath52.4 k,@xcite which is close to the @xmath16 of tl@xmath0bi@xmath1te@xmath2 .",
    "however , it is very unlikely that the superconductivity observed here is due to elemental thallium , because the xrd data do not indicate the existence of thallium metal in our samples .    in the past , the crystal structure of tl - doped bi@xmath1te@xmath2 with the composition of tl@xmath11bi@xmath19te@xmath2 was studied.@xcite it was concluded that , even though the composition suggests that tl atoms partially substitute the bi sites of the bi@xmath1te@xmath2 lattice , what actually happens is that tl nucleates microscopic patches of nominal te - bi - te - tl-@xmath43 layer , which is derived from tlbite@xmath1 structure and has the same symmetry as the bi@xmath1te@xmath2 phase @xcite ( in real crystals , the fictitious plane of te vacancy would be partially filled with te , distributing @xmath43 to the neighboring te plane of bi@xmath1te@xmath2 ) .",
    "it was proposed that there are random microscopic formations of this defect layer in tl - doped bi@xmath1te@xmath2 , which results in the overall crystal structure to be the same as bi@xmath1te@xmath2 and causes little change in the lattice constants , even though a significant amount of tl is incorporated into the lattice .",
    "it is useful to note that both our icp - aes and edx analyses of the crystals indicate the presence of nearly stoichiometric amount of tl , which would give rise to about 30% of the tlbite@xmath1 phase if the sample phase - separates into bi@xmath1te@xmath2 and tlbite@xmath1 .",
    "the amount of the tlbite@xmath1 phase indicated in the rietveld refinement is consistent with this estimate , which suggests that due to the mobility of tl atoms at room temperature , the material actually phase separates into bi@xmath1te@xmath2 and tlbite@xmath1 upon grinding .",
    "this in turn suggests that it is very difficult to elucidate the crystal structure of the superconductor phase",
    ".    a possible picture , which one can speculate for the superconducting phase based on the above result , would be to consider the formation of the nominal te - bi - te - tl-@xmath43 defect layer in the bi@xmath1te@xmath2 lattice , as is the case of the tl@xmath11bi@xmath19te@xmath2 compound.@xcite .",
    "this defect layer may eventually cluster to form the tlbite@xmath1 phase .",
    "an important difference from the case of the tl@xmath11bi@xmath19te@xmath2 compound would be that a sizable portion of bi atoms in tl@xmath0bi@xmath1te@xmath2 are most likely partially filling the te sites of the bi@xmath1te@xmath2 lattice and form bi@xmath28 antisite defects , which is consistent with the result of the rietveld refinement .",
    "in fact , the composition of tl@xmath0bi@xmath1te@xmath2 would create a significantly te - deficient growth condition and promote the formation of bi@xmath28 antisite defects.@xcite in any case , the precise structure of superconducting tl@xmath0bi@xmath1te@xmath2 should be determined in future studies , possibly by neutron scattering on as - grown crystals .     in tl@xmath0bi@xmath1te@xmath2 .",

    ", width=283 ]    figure 2 shows the temperature dependence of @xmath21 in tl@xmath0bi@xmath1te@xmath2 at zero field .",
    "the onset of superconducting transition occurs at @xmath45 k , and the zero resistivity is achieved at @xmath46 k ( lower inset of figure 2 ) , indicating a relatively sharp transition .",

    "the magnetic - field dependence of @xmath22 at 2.5 k is shown in the upper inset of figure 2 ; this @xmath50 behavior is slightly non - linear , which suggests the existence of two or more bands at the fermi level . also , the @xmath50 data indicate that the main carriers are @xmath4-type ( i.e. holes ) , and from the slope near 0 t we calculate the approximate carrier density of @xmath51 . from @xmath4 and @xmath47 ,",
    "one obtains the mobility @xmath52 175 @xmath53/vs .",
    "it is important to note that the carrier type is different from the case of cu- or sr - intercalated bi@xmath1se@xmath2 superconductors , in which the carriers are @xmath54-type .",
    "@xcite nevertheless , the magnitude of the carrier density , about 2 @xmath6 10@xmath7 @xmath8 , is comparable to that in cu@xmath11bi@xmath1se@xmath2 .",
    "@xcite hence , tl@xmath0bi@xmath1te@xmath2 would allow for investigation of the roles of the carrier types in producing a topological superconducting state in otherwise similar settings , if this material turns out to be a tsc . in passing , we comment on the possible impact of the tlbite@xmath1 impurity phase and the nominal te - bi - te - tl-@xmath43 defect layer on the transport properties .",
    "while the direct impact of phase - separated tlbite@xmath1 impurity phase is expected to be minor because the carrier density of this phase is similar to that of the main phase,@xcite the defect layer may be working as strong scatters of charge carriers and is possibly playing some role in the occurrence of superconductivity .",
    "figure 3(a ) shows the temperature dependence of the shielding fraction in tl@xmath0bi@xmath1te@xmath2 measured under 0.2 mt applied parallel to the @xmath18-plane to minimize the demagnetization effect ; the configuration is schematically shown in the inset .",
    "note that the shielding fraction is defined as the fraction of the sample volume from which the magnetic field is kept out due to superconductivity ; the data for both field - cooled ( fc ) and zero - field - cooled ( zfc ) measurements are shown .",
    "the onset of superconducting transition is observed at @xmath55 2.35 k. this is consistent with the resistivity transition shown in figure 2 .",
    "furthermore , the zfc shielding fraction at 1.75 k is as much as 83% , pointing to bulk superconductivity .",
    "we have also synthesized tl@xmath11bi@xmath1te@xmath2 samples with various @xmath15 values , and it was found that both @xmath16 and the shielding fraction become lower for @xmath56 0.6 , as is shown in figure s2 of the supporting information .",
    "also , for @xmath57 0.6 , we found that the tlbite@xmath1 impurity phase becomes dominant and it was impossible to synthesize large single crystals retaining the bi@xmath1te@xmath2 structure .",
    "therefore , we concluded that @xmath15 = 0.6 is the optimum composition for this new superconductor .",
    "the magnetization curve @xmath58 measured at 1.75 k with the magnetic field applied parallel to the @xmath18 plane is shown in figure 3(b ) .",
    "this @xmath58 behavior indicates that tl@xmath0bi@xmath1te@xmath2 is a type - ii superconductor and the flux pinning is very weak , as was also the case in cu@xmath11bi@xmath1se@xmath2 .",
    "@xcite from the low - field @xmath58 behavior measured after zero - field cooling ( shown in figure s3 of supporting information ) , one can determine the lower critical field @xmath59 as the characteristic field above which the @xmath58 data start to deviates from the initial linear behavior ; at the lowest temperature of 1.75 k , @xmath59 is estimated to be 0.35 mt , which is very small and is comparable to that in cu@xmath11bi@xmath1se@xmath2 .",
    "@xcite such a low @xmath59 value means a very low superfluid density , which is consistent with the low carrier density .",

    "a fitting of the normal - state data to the conventional debye formula @xmath62 , shown as the dashed line in figure 4(a ) , gives the following parameters : @xmath63 = 4.8 mj / mol - k@xmath64 , @xmath65 = 4.4 mj / mol - k@xmath66 , and @xmath67 = 0.11 mj / mol - k@xmath68 .",

    "therefore , one may conclude that the superconducting state of tl@xmath0bi@xmath71te@xmath72 is fully gapped .",
    "note that the applicability of the bcs model to the specific - heat data does not exclude the possibility of unconventional odd - parity pairing .",
