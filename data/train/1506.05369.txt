    "the global kinematics of halo stars encodes important information about the mass , structure , and formation of the milky way .",

    "modern studies based on observational data from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) support a dual component stellar halo @xcite . in this view , the inner halo @xmath6 kpc exhibits a flattened distribution of stars on radial orbits with no net rotation contrasted with the outer halo @xmath7 kpc characterized by a spherical distribution of stars with net retrograde rotation .",
    "@xcite , however , argue that the dual halo results from observational errors and selection effects , and can not be distinguished from a single halo full of substructure .",

    "this is not a physically plausible scenario .",
    "the high velocity dispersions for @xmath157 and @xmath158 and the positive covariance in the range @xmath124 kpc imply that some of the stars must have velocities exceeding the galactic escape velocity .",

    "we present anisotropy estimates for our overlapping fixed @xmath139 kpc bins ( red squares ) , together with the anisotropy estimates of prior researchers.,width=336 ]    we attribute the less negative values of @xmath111 estimated by other researchers to their use of much wider bins in @xmath66 , which smooth the actual dispersion profiles ; to a lower @xmath161 cutoff of 4 kpc , which may increase contamination by disk stars ; and to different statistical models that marginalize over tangential velocities and , in some cases , also impose additional assumptions about the gravitational potential and number density of stars .",
    "as shown by the horizontal bars in @xmath162 the estimates of @xmath111 by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite are based on broad ranges in @xmath66 that extend beyond the interval where our results diverge .",
    "although @xcite do not report the sizes of the bins used for their estimations , we deduce from their original data that their bins increase in width from approximately @xmath130 kpc at @xmath163 kpc to @xmath164 kpc at @xmath165 kpc .    at first glance ,",
    "our results corroborate the discontinuity in @xmath132 observed around @xmath61 kpc .",
    "our results suggest the presence of correlated stellar motions within the region of @xmath166 kpc , perhaps resulting from star streams or other structure .",
    "the implausibly high velocity dispersions also suggest that there may be another explanation for the discrepancy , namely that our underlying statistical model and those of previous researchers may be misspecified .",

    "we also investigate different model specifications , and compare the results from the restricted and unrestricted model for each sample .",
    "finally , the location and size of the bins used in the estimations may affect the results .",
    "we therefore re - estimate the model parameters using an epanechnikov kernel centered at @xmath66 with finite support on a total bandwidth of 4 kpc chosen to match the size of fixed bins used .",
    "this method gives greater weight to stars near @xmath66 , rather than weighting them uniformly as occurs with fixed bins , and provides continuous estimates of the parameters as functions of @xmath66 .    in every case , the resulting parameter estimates change by less than about one standard deviation from our original results with the exception of a systematic distance error , where the change in parameter estimates is less than two standard deviations .",
    "we conclude that our results are numerically robust within the estimated errors .",
    "the alignment of the velocity ellipsoid for halo stars with respect to the galactic coordinate system provides a powerful probe of the gravitational potential of the galaxy .",
    "the alignment can be described by the tilt angles , @xmath169 , derived by @xcite , @xmath170 where @xmath137 is the covariance between the velocity components @xmath171 and @xmath172 .",

    "their work was limited both in distance and sky coverage .",
    "our sample , on the other hand , extends to @xmath192 kpc with substantially greater sky coverage , including high galactic latitudes where any contribution from the galactic disk is negligible .",
    "many studies have exploited the dynamics of halo stars to measure the mass of the milky way @xcite by assuming dynamical equilibrium and fitting specific forms of the distribution function , postulated to depend only on two integrals of motion , the binding energy and the angular momentum .",

    "recent simulations by @xcite evaluate potential biases in estimating the mass of the milky way using dynamical tracers .",
    "they find that although deviations from spherical symmetry are relatively unimportant , deviations from dynamical equilibrium can cause significant bias . to avoid any discontinuity in the break region , where the assumption of dynamic equilibrium may not hold , we calculate the mass within 12 kpc of the galactic center , @xmath201 , using the results from the 4 kpc wide bin centered on 12 kpc and the jeans equation ( [ eq : jeans equation ] ) .",

    "we find @xmath207 m@xmath3 , a result that agrees to within 20% with @xcite .",
    "motivated by the large tangential velocity dispersion estimates in the region @xmath4 kpc , we examine whether the observational data are consistent with our one fundamental assumption : that the three components of velocity , @xmath208 , are normally distributed .",
    "the normal distribution is described by two parameters , its mean and dispersion .",
    "if the distribution of halo star velocities is not intrinsically normal and we ( incorrectly ) try to represent it as such , we expect the mean will remain largely unchanged but the dispersion will vary . notably , the sgr stream passes through our survey region in a way that introduces a bimodal velocity distribution of stars into the sample beginning at @xmath209 kpc .",
    "if the underlying theoretical assumptions are correct , the observed line - of - sight velocities should be normally distributed since linear combinations of normally distributed random variables are also normally distributed .",
    "yet section [ subsubsec : vrf_properties ] shows that the distribution of observed radial velocities departs from normal in certain regions and fails standard statistical tests for normality .",
    "physically , known or unknown star streams or other velocity structure may be responsible for this observed departure from normality .",
    "correlations between angular position and velocity break our model assumptions .    to better understand the possible causes of these discrepancies , we look more closely at the break region by selecting the @xmath210 stars in the @xmath124 kpc bin and plotting the histogram of @xmath68 in figure [ fig : vrf histogram ] .",
    "the histogram reveals deviations from a normal distribution both in the center and in the wings of the distribution .",
    "the kolmogorov - smirnov test rejects normality at a reasonable level of statistical significance ( @xmath211 , and the more powerful anderson - darling test that gives more weight to the tails than the kolmogorov - smirnoff test strongly rejects normality ( @xmath212 ) .",
    "at least one significant halo structure lies within our survey footprint : the sgr stream . to assess the impact of the sgr stream",
    ", we turn to the @xmath213-body model of @xcite . their model is designed to match existing observational constraints on the location and motion of the sgr stream in a triaxial potential .",
    "we sample the @xmath213-body model for test particles that lie at @xmath54 kpc in the range @xmath124 kpc and that fall within an approximation of our survey footprint on the sky ( @xmath214 or ( @xmath215 and @xmath216 ) ) .",
    "although the majority of sgr is at larger distances , a fraction of the stream is present in the @xmath124 kpc region .",
    "figure [ fig : vrf histogram ] ( lower panel ) shows the @xmath68 distribution of sgr @xmath213-body particles in this region .    because the sgr stream wraps around the sky in a roughly polar orbit , the sgr stars passing through the @xmath124 kpc region exhibit multiple velocity peaks and a broad velocity dispersion .",
    "suggestively , the two main peaks in @xmath68 from the sgr model coincide with the excesses found in the wings of the observed halo star distribution ( figure [ fig : vrf histogram ] ) in a fitted , three component , normal mixture model @xcite .",
    "previous research estimates that up to @xmath217 of the stars in the survey region may originate in the sgr stream @xcite .",
    "the presence of sgr stream stars in our sample may thus account , at least partially , for the observed discrepancies in the observed velocity dispersions and anisotropy of the halo in the break region .",
    "we test this hypothesis by removing all stars in our sample within @xmath218 of the sgr stream , @xmath219 , using the sgr stream coordinates , @xmath220 , defined by @xcite .    removing the region of the sgr stream from our sample",
    "modestly lowers our estimates of the dispersions , which , in turn , increases our estimate of the anisotropy .",
    "the anisotropy in the @xmath124 kpc bin changes from @xmath221 to @xmath222 , in better agreement with previous results ( figure [ fig : beta comparison ] ) .",
    "the change in @xmath11 is formally less than @xmath112 , but there may be other star streams for which we do not account .",
    "indeed , @xcite and @xcite identify 30% - 40% of f - type stars at 15 kpc depths in coherent spatial or velocity structures , and @xcite show that the percentage of halo stars in coherent structures increases with depth .",
    "we conclude that the traditionally assumed normal velocity distribution model may not properly represent the substructure of the stellar halo .",
    "we use a large sample of 19,859 stars at @xmath1 kpc to investigate the mean velocities , velocity dispersions , covariances , and anisotropy of the milky way halo .",
    "this dense sample enables finer binning than previously used and allows us to investigate the @xmath4 kpc anomaly in anisotropy at higher statistical significance .",
    "we begin by presenting a new radial velocity survey of 6,174 faint f - type stars observed with the hectospec spectrograph using the mmt telescope .",
    "f - type stars are dense tracers of both the thick disk and halo .",
    "to focus on halo kinematics , we restrict our analysis to stars with @xmath54 kpc .",
    "we add stars from published sdss radial velocity samples to create a combined sample of 19,859 stars that span @xmath1 kpc .",
    "we use the sun s offset from the galactic center to recover tangential velocity information from the observed line - of - sight velocities utilizing standard statistical methods .",
    "we make the minimal assumption that the underlying stellar velocity distribution is normal .",
    "we use a maximum likelihood procedure to calculate the velocity means , dispersions , covariances , and anisotropy .",
    "we find that the alignment of the velocity ellipsoid is consistent with a spherically symmetric gravitational potential . from the spherical jeans equation",
    ", we estimate the mass of the milky way within 12 kpc is @xmath223 m@xmath3 with an uncertainty of 40% .    a significant region of discontinuity @xmath4 kpc exists where the estimated velocity dispersions and anisotropy diverge from their anticipated values , confirming the break region observed by others .",
    "the estimated tangential velocity dispersions in this region are so large that stars would be unbound , an unphysical result .",
    "yet the results are numerically robust . in sensitivity analyses",
    "( _ i.e. _ , using a different solar motion , different distance scale , different survey footprint , etc . )",
    ", the maximum likelihood calculation yields parameters that change by less than about one standard deviation from our original result .",
    "conversely , if we input simulated data drawn from known normal velocity distributions , the maximum likelihood estimation finds the correct velocity dispersion and anisotropy parameters .",
    "we suggest that the discontinuity in the region @xmath224 kpc arises from the failure of the normal distribution model to describe the actual velocity data . physically , known or unknown star streams or other velocity substructure may be responsible for the departure from normality . the predicted contribution of the ( polar orbiting ) sgr stream in our survey region , for example , is a bi - modal distribution of stars in the wings of the observed radial velocity distribution .",
    "sgr by itself can not explain the discontinuity , but sgr is unlikely to be the only structure in the halo .",
    "the upshot is that larger radial velocity samples alone can not improve our understanding of the halo using the standard statistical approach .",
    "significant improvement requires direct tangential velocity constraints for halo stars , like those soon to be provided by _ gaia_. the combination of our radial velocity measurements with _ gaia _",
