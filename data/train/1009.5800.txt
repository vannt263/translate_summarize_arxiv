    "in the cbs ` 60 minutes ' interview televised on 15 march 2009 , ben bernanke predicted that the recession triggered by the global financial crisis will end in 2009 , and the us economy will recover in 2010 @xcite . while we will never know whether bernanke made the prediction based on his gut feelings , or on simulation results from some sophisticated macroeconomic model",
    ", what we do know is that the prediction sparked intense public debate on whether the chairman of the us federal reserve was overly optimistic . given that the financial industry was still reeling from the massive october 2008 slide , reactions to bernanke s statement must be especially strong .",
    "we also know that the us federal reserve does not appear to be behind its chairman : up till september 2010 , the interest rate has not been raised @xcite , even though there has been calls from within the federal reserve system to tighten the money supply @xcite .",
    "this has led to mounting concerns from economists that the oversupply of government money , in the form of an interest rate that is nearly zero , will cause an inflation when the economy recovers @xcite .",
    "in fact , a commentator argued that us stimulus money is fueling property bubbles all over asia , and warned that the global economy will crash once again in 2012 when the feds rein in their easy money @xcite .    in january 2004 , there was a similar call by economists to raise interest rates @xcite , when the us economy was showing signs of coming out of the technology bubble crisis .",
    "the federal reserve responded hesitantly only in june 2004 @xcite .",
    "we can understand the concern of the us government then , and possibly also now : how do we know that the early signs will lead on to a recovery that will strengthen and stay the course ?",
    "from these historical and contemporary lessons , we know that a more sensitive and more robust indicator of economic recovery is needed . while much work has been done on developing and validating reliable precursor signatures ( also called _ leading indicators _ ) for the onset of financial crises ( see for example , refs .",
    "@xcite ) , and understanding such economic disasters in general ( see for example , refs .",
    "@xcite ) , less has been done to find robust indicators of economic recovery ( see for example , refs .",
    "@xcite ) . in this work ,",
    "we hope to address this important gap .",
    "recently , we adapted the recursive entropic segmentation method @xcite developed by bernaola - galvn and coworkers for biological sequence segmentation , and applied it to financial time series segmentation @xcite . based on our segmentation of the dow",
    "jones industrial average ( djia ) time series between 1997 and 2008 , we saw that the us economy , as measured by the djia , switched between a high - volatility crisis phase and a low - volatility growth phase .",
    "the first crisis phase lasted from mid-1998 to mid-2003 , coinciding with the us technology bubble and the ensuing economic recession .",
    "the second crisis phase started in mid-2007 , coinciding with the us subprime crisis and the ensuing global financial crisis .",
    "more interestingly , we could also identify a year - long series of precursor shocks prior to the mid-1998 and mid-2007 onsets of two crisis phases , as well as a year - long series of inverted shocks prior to the mid-2003 economic recovery .",
    "the series of inverted shocks started with the mid-2002 dow jones low , so if we believe the internal dynamics of the us economy had not changed from the previous financial crisis to the present financial crisis , we would naively expect the us economy to recover one year after the march 2009 lows , i.e. the second quarter of 2010 , give and take .",
    "clearly , a single study of a single time series spanning only two financial crises and one growth period is hardly enough statistical evidence in bernanke s favor . to enhance the statistical significance of features seen in the segmented djia time series , we carried out a cross - section study , comparing the segmented time series of the ten dow jones us ( djus ) economic sector indices @xcite . by identifying the sequences of onsets in the ten djus indices , we find sectors in the us economy going first to last into the present financial crisis in merely two months ! while we may or may not have an extended sequence of precursor shocks to work with for predicting market crashes and financial crisis ( see the recent update @xcite on the heroic efforts by sornette and coworkers ) , when the dominoes are set in motion policy makers will have a month or two to contain the crisis .",
    "since this financial crisis eventually spread globally , we will have to wait for the next potential crisis to find out if containment is at all possible .",
    "we do know , however , that the us federal reserve acted promptly , announcing the first of a series of interest rate cuts in august 2007 . unfortunately , as detailed in ref .",
    "@xcite , we saw these rate cuts rapidly losing effectiveness .",
    "a critical discussion on the actions taken by the us federal reserve can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in the same comparative study",
    ", we also identified the sequence of economic recoveries in the different us economic sectors .",
    "the excruciatingly slow complete economic recovery from the previous financial crisis , defined as consistent growth in the first sector to consistent growth in the last sector , took one and a half years . given this long time scale , developing robust indicators to detect economic recovery , and thereafter designing timely stimulus packages , should be easier than finding sensitive indicators that would warn us of an impending financial crisis .",
    "we would imagine that tracking slow month - to - month indicators should be enough to give us a confident forecast on the start of growth , but all through the second half of 2009 and 2010 to date , we hear commentators mostly urging caution @xcite .",
    "we believe this cautious outlook can be blamed partly on swings in the stock markets , which always become strong when things are taking a turn for the better or for the worst .",
    "perhaps the way to allay such market - driven fears is to extract convincing signs from the high - frequency stock - market data itself .",
    "based on these signs , policy makers can then tell more confidently that the economy will recover in a matter of months , and start planning measures to further stimulate the recovery .",
    "in this paper , which is organized into six sections , we report a minimal spanning tree ( mst ) study of the segmented time series of the ten djus economic sector indices . in section [",
    "sect : datamethods ] , we describe the data sets studied , and the statistical methods used to analyze them . in section [ sect : macromst ] , we examine the gross structure of the 10-sector mst over the 2000 to 2009 period , as well as those over the 20022003 crisis period , the 20042005 growth period , and the 20082009 crisis period .",
    "we explain the macroeconomic significance of the core - fringe structure of the msts , and also suggest why the msts organize themselves into a star topology during growth , and into a chain topology during crisis . then",
    ", in section [ sect : segmentmst ] , we construct msts within segments associated with distinct macroeconomic phases to study the correlational dynamics within the us economy .",
    "we again find that the mst is star - like in low - volatility segments , and chain - like in high - volatility segments .",
    "this tells us that the star - like mst is a robust and reliable character of economic well being . by combining temporal information obtained through statistical segmentation and clustering ,",
    "we show that volatility shocks always start at the fringe and propogate inwards . some of the links to leader sectors have anomalously high cross - correlations .",
    "we also check whether such volatility shocks have a more domestic or more global origin .",
    "finally in section [ sect : mstrearrangements ] , by examining a nearly contiguous sequence of corresponding segments , we look at how the mst rearranges in the pre - recovery periods for both the previous and the current financial crises .",
    "we found very violent rearrangements prior to the previous economic recovery .",
    "for the present financial crisis , we can see clear signatures of star - to - chain and chain - to - star rearrangements , accompanied by the expected changes in market volatilities and cross - correlations .",
    "this suggests that the us market has become more efficient , as far as processing information is concerned , over the past 510 years .",
    "after predicting that the us economy will recover in early 2010 , we summarize our findings in section [ sect : conclusions ] .",
    "tic - by - tic data for the ten dow jones us ( djus ) economic sector indices ( see table [ table : djus ] for the indexing scheme @xmath0 used ) over the period 14 february 2000 to 25 november 2009 were downloaded from the thomson - reuters tickhistory ( formerly known as taqtic ) database @xcite .",
    "these were then processed into time series @xmath1 at fixed time intervals indexed by @xmath2 .",
    "since financial markets are known to exhibit complex dynamics on multiple time scales , the data frequency has to be carefully selected . in the financial economics literature ,",
    "intervals ranging from 5 to 60 minutes have been used for estimating realized or benchmark daily volatilities for foreign exchange or stock market time series @xcite . in general , higher data frequencies are not employed due to worries about the effects of market microstructures .",
    ".the ten dow jones us economic sector indices as defined by the industry classification benchmark ( icb ) .",
    "these are float - adjusted market capitalization weighted sums of variable numbers of component stocks , introduced on february 14 , 2000 to measure the performance of us stocks in the ten icb industries .",
    "the makeup of these indices are reviewed quarterly , and the number of components and float - adjusted market capitalizations taken from http://www.djindexes.com/mdsidx/downloads/fact_info/dow_jones_us_indexes_industry_indexes_fact_sheet.pdf , and are accurate as of november 30 , 2010 .",
    "the top components of each index are shown in appendix [ app : components ] .",
