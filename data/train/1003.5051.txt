    "brownian motion is historically central to the molecular - level interpretation of statistical mechanics @xcite , and it is crucial for precision measurements of macroscopic degrees of freedom @xcite . more recently , brownian motion has been interpreted as emerging from the interaction of a particle , classical or quantum , with an environment which may be schematized as a set of harmonic oscillators @xcite , representing a heat bath . as",
    "the number of oscillators in the heat bath increases , the dynamics of the test particle considered as an open system becomes increasingly stochastic .",
    "simple statistical laws for the average behavior of such open systems are obtained by considering environments with particular energy distributions , such as the canonical ensembles .",
    "indeed , in the limit of an infinite number of oscillators , and for certain additional assumptions about their collective properties , including weak coupling and/or high temperature limits , the equation of motion for the test particle reduces to the familiar langevin equation . in this case ,",
    "stationary solutions correspond to the test particle s energy having a boltzmann distribution in time , and therefore thermalized with the heat bath .    in many contexts , however , in particular for systems of interest in mesoscopic physics and nanotechnology",
    ", the size of the environment is small and does not justify this large number limit .",
    "there is also a natural infrared cut off for the frequency of the oscillators schematizing the environment , as the latter can not support wavelengths much larger than its size .",
    "furthermore , the finite amount of energy in any realistic enviroment demands an ultraviolet cut off in its density of states .",
    "our study is aimed at understanding generic properties of thermalization in mesoscopic systems , and we add to the analytical results direct simulations of a test particle in contact with a finite number of oscillators , whose frequencies are distributed in a finite bandwidth .",
    "this is a textbook system , but it produces a range of behaviors which are missed by purely analytical studies , and which lead to a spectrum of phenomenological implications , in particular in the physics of high - frequency nanomechanical structures . our findings may be relevant for the understanding of anomalies observed in the effective temperature of a resonating mode of a nanoresonator in interaction with a thermal bath and with the measurement apparatus schematized as a thermal bath at an effective temperature @xcite .",
    "the nanoresonator dynamics result from the competition between two effective heat baths at different temperatures , in analogy to the phenomenon of cold damping first discussed in @xcite , and later demonstrated for macroscopic resonators in @xcite .",
    "anomalies observed in the experiment described in @xcite may then be attributed to deviations from the boltzmann distribution for the nanoresonator .    in a previous contribution @xcite ,",
    "conditions under which thermalization occurs in the presence of a single finite resource heat bath have been discussed . in this paper , after recalling the case of thermalization in the presence of a single bath case and analyzing in more depth some specific issues , we continue our analysis by considering a situation in which the test particle is intermittently interacting with two different reservoirs . for langevin reservoirs ,",
    "this has been discussed , especially in recent years , in the literature @xcite .",
    "langevin reservoirs , however , are only parameterized by the temperatures of the heat baths and the damping coefficients ( or , alternatively , the relaxation times ) . in our case ,",
    "the density of states of the heat baths , the number of particles in each bath , and the masses of the constituent particles are further parameters which influence the thermalization of the test particle .",
    "when two heat baths are present , they can also differ in temperature and density of states , opening up an even richer scenario .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we discuss analytical results on heat baths , in the two extreme situations of a heat bath with infinite bandwidth and of zero bandwidth .",
    "both cases can be treated analytically with simple approximations , and they both provide useful insights for the more general case of a finite bandwidth . in section iii we describe in some detail the numerical techniques and some results , complementing the ones presented in @xcite , about the dependence of thermalization upon the density of states and the approximate scaling of the thermalization curves . in section iv we present the case of the two baths and examples of both thermalization and frustration of the test particle under intermittent interaction of the heat baths .",
    "the potential relevance of these studies to the analysis of recent experiments and possible future demonstrations is discussed in the conclusions , with particular regard to the possibility to engineer some baths to achieve approximated nondemolitive measurements in both the classical and quantum regime .",
    "our starting point is the classic hamiltonian of the test particle plus environment found in @xcite :    @xmath0 . \\label{htotal}\\ ] ]    here the test particle , with generalized coordinates @xmath1 , is schematized as a harmonic oscillator of mass @xmath2 and angular frequency @xmath3 , while the generic @xmath4 particle in the reservoir , with generalized coordinates @xmath5 , is schematized as a harmonic oscillator of mass @xmath6 and angular frequency @xmath7 .",
    "the systems are assumed to be one - dimensional , and the coupling between the test particle and the particles in the reservoir has been chosen to be translationally invariant , to avoid the appearance of renormalization terms as discussed in @xcite ( for more general couplings see also @xcite ) .    to illustrate the impact of the bath frequencies @xmath8 , we first consider two extreme situations for the range of their distribution which are analytically approachable : infinite bandwidth and zero bandwidth .",
    "the first situation is the usual langevin approach , summarized here for completeness and to establish the notation we will use in the following .",
    "the case of a heat bath with zero bandwidth , i.e. all oscillators degenerate in frequency , is then studied , and we find that it produces a scaling law which can be approximated in the more realistic setting of a finite bandwidth .",
    "we briefly recall the major features of the langevin approach and how it may be derived through the analysis of an ensemble of harmonic oscillators with the proper energy distribution . by writing the hamilton equations from ( [ htotal ] ) and solving for the particles of the heat bath , the test particle can be described by the generalized langevin equation @xcite :    @xmath9    where the kernel of the dissipative term ( in general non local in time ) is :    @xmath10\\ ] ]    and the fluctuation force term is :    @xmath11 +    \\frac{p_n(t_0)}{m \\omega_n } \\sin[\\omega_n(t - t_0 ) ] \\}\\ ] ]        in the limit of infinite harmonic oscillators in the bath extending over the continuum frequency range @xmath12 , with density of states @xmath13 , and if the initial conditions for the bath particles @xmath14 are chosen to realize a boltzmann energy distribution , the test particle will be described by a langevin equation ( for details see @xcite )    @xmath15 dt + \\sqrt{2 m \\gamma k_b t } dw(t )   \\label{langevin}\\ ] ]    where @xmath16 .",

    "[ langevin ] corresponds to the thermalization of the test particle energy to the boltzmann energy distribution of the bath .      in order to understand the importance of having the oscillators of the bath distributed in a large bandwidth we also discuss the extreme case of a test particle interacting with a finite number of oscillators which are degenerate in frequency ( @xmath17 ) . in this case , if the initial conditions for the bath oscillators are distributed symmetrically in the phase space for each realization of the bath ( such that @xmath18 , @xmath19 ) , the expressions for the dissipative kernel and the fluctuation force become , apart from stochastic corrections due to the partial cancellation in the initial conditions :    @xmath20\\ ] ]    @xmath21\\ ] ]    the langevin equation in this case is then written as :    @xmath22 ds+(1+\\xi ) \\omega_r^2 q(t)=0,\\ ] ]    where @xmath23 .",
    "the corresponding dynamics resembles that of multiple oscillators experiencing beating phenomena , with energy periodically transferred between the test particle and the heat bath as @xmath24 .",
    "the corresponding energy probability density @xmath25 for the test particle having energy between @xmath26 and @xmath27 is therefore @xmath28^{-1/2}$ ] .",
    "the absence of a bandwidth for the oscillators schematizing the heat bath is responsible for the lack of thermalization , as the test particle performs a deterministic , periodic motion , and in such a situation no thermalization can be expected .",
    "nevertheless , this case is relevant for understanding the dependence of the thermalization upon the parameter @xmath29 , as we will discuss in the next section .",
    "the above situations are highly idealized , since they both correspond to an _",
    "infinite _ number of oscillators in the environment , either spread out over all possible frequencies or concentrated at a single frequency . as we have mentioned in the introduction there is a strong justification for relaxing these assumptions and considering the generic case of a finite environment with a finite bandwidth for the frequencies of its particles .    in a generic situation with the oscillators of the heat bath distributed in a finite bandwidth ,",
    "no explicit solutions will generally be available .",
    "however , we can conjecture that the behaviour will lie in between the two extreme cases of the idealized langevin heat bath and the degenerate heat bath . to corroborate this qualitative claim ,",
    "we have used the method described below to numerically investigate the deviations from thermalization for a finite size reservoir characterized by a finite frequency spectrum @xmath30 $ ] , a finite number of oscillators , a finite mass ratio @xmath31 between the masses of the reservoir particles and the test particle , and a given density of states .    strictly speaking , for a heat bath made of a finite number of oscillators coupled to a test particle",
    ", there will be no approach to equilibrium , as any initial state for the combined system will recur within a finite time @xcite .",
    "if the number of oscillators in the bath is sufficiently large , however , the corresponding recurrence time will be very long .",
    "provided one is interested in studying the dynamics on a timescale much shorter than this rather long recurrence time , an effective approach to equilibrium describable in terms of the usual thermodynamic quantities is viable . in this spirit , we focus our attention on the mutual relationship between the parameters of the heat bath and the test particle , to find the conditions under which the latter thermalizes with the former .",
    "our numerical approach consists of choosing values for the parameters which describe the test particle and the bath , solving the motion equations for the system , sampling the test particle s energy over time , and analyzing its distribution .",
    "the energies @xmath32 of the oscillators in the bath are chosen to follow a boltzmann distribution , defining the bath temperature .",
    "the frequencies @xmath8 are chosen independently to follow a given  typically uniform ",
    "density of states , bounded by both the infrared and ultraviolet cutoffs .",
    "the @xmath32 and @xmath8 serve to constrain the initial conditions @xmath33 , which are then chosen to satisfy @xmath34 , each uniformly distributed in its available phase space .",
    "all of these values are chosen using the matlab pseudo - random number generator . in order to avoid bias among the frequencies and energies of the bath oscillators , we run each simulation multiple times , using different seeds for the generator , and average the results .",

    "we can then rewrite the matrix equation ( [ mateq ] ) as @xmath48 and then @xmath49 . if we let @xmath50 and @xmath51 then we have a new matrix equation in normal coordinates @xmath52 .",
    "this yields a set of independent , second order , homogenous differential equations @xmath53 where the @xmath54 are the diagonal elements of @xmath46 , the eigenvalues of @xmath55 .",
    "each of these equations has the simple solution @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the @xmath58 component of the vector of initial conditions in normal coordinates , obtained by applying @xmath59 to the initial conditions @xmath60 .",
    "we can write these solutions in a vector @xmath61 the coordinate vector containing the position and momentum of the test particle and bath particles at any time @xmath62 can then be obtained by substituting the value of @xmath62 into @xmath63 and multiplying by the matrix @xmath47 to return to the original coordinates .",
    "since @xmath47 has the same dimensions as @xmath55 specifically , @xmath64this causes the process of determining the state of the system at some time to run in time which is @xmath65 in the number of particles in the bath .",
    "however , it is possible to avoid this issue of computational resources if we are willing to sacrifice knowledge about the state of each bath particle at time @xmath62 , and simply request the knowledge of the position and momentum @xmath66 and @xmath67 of the test particle . in this case",
    "we can simply multiply the vector @xmath63 by the first row of @xmath47 to obtain the value of @xmath66 , and by the second row of @xmath47 to obtain the value of @xmath67then the process runs instead in @xmath68 , which significantly speeds up the simulations for relatively large numbers of oscillators .",
    "the thermal behavior of the test particle can be observed by sampling its position and momentum at different times and calculating its energy , and then making a histogram of the measured energies .",
    "if the distribution of energies follows the boltzmann law , we say the test particle has thermalized , and we can define a temperature for the test particle by looking at the slope of the distribution .",
    "this temperature can then be compared with the temperature of the original energy distribution of the bath particles .",
    "the slope of the distribution is evaluated in a separate function by taking the natural logarithm of the height of each bin , and then performing weighted least squares fitting , with the weight of each data point being given by @xmath69 , the original height of the bin .",
    "the statistical fluctuations in the energy are expected to have a poisson distribution , which if centered around a value @xmath70 has a standard deviation of @xmath71 , and thus the uncertainty in the number of elements @xmath69 in each bin is given by @xmath72 since the weights in a weighted least squares fit are given by @xmath73 , the weights for fitting @xmath74 are then @xmath69 .",
    "the relatively large number of oscillators and the statistical accuracy of the results do not require fitting with a canonical power law distribution as discussed in @xcite .",
    "one issue in sampling the energy of the test particle is considering the time scales involved in the problem , and possible periodicity . any sampling corresponding to periodicities in the motion of the test particle may produce misleading results . for this reason we use random step sizes in sampling the test particle energy , with the distribution of random step sizes centered around a chosen value , uniformly distributed between zero and twice that value , in such a way that the latter represents the average sampling time .",
    "the precision in the determination of the temperature of the heat bath and the test particle are due to different factors .",
    "the precision of the bath temperature is limited by the number of oscillators it comprises , which is generally in the hundreds . even generating multiple realizations of the bath energies and averaging over these to compensate for the quality of the distribution produced by the random number generator does not result in significant improvements here .",
    "this is shown in fig . 1 where the heat bath temperature and its standard deviation are plotted versus the number of oscillators for three different numbers of realizations , each of which represents a different seed for the random number generator .",
    "for the test particle temperature , on the other hand , the precision at leading order is determined by the chosen number of random realizations .",
    "averaging over a large number of trials lowers the influences from bad seeds when generating the energy and frequency distributions of the bath particles , as can be seen in fig .",
    "however , too many trials will result in a very long simulation time .",
    "for those tests which require high precision we in general use 15 seeds , while for tests requiring less precision 5 - 7 seeds are used .     versus its initial energy , with the bath temperature being @xmath75=5.5 in arbitrary units .",

    "the distribution appears boltzmann at low energies , but becomes gaussian at high energies , with its peak around the initial energy.,title=\"fig : \" ]",
    "examples of partial and complete thermalization of the test particle to the reservoir are shown in fig . 3 for different numbers of oscillators in the heat bath ( see @xcite for examples of the test particle energy distribution ) .",
    "we find three regimes : at low angular frequencies @xmath76 , the test particle approaches an equilibrium state corresponding to an average energy lower than the reservoir temperature , its spectral dependence is flat , and the energy distribution is significantly different from the boltzmann one , as discussed in @xcite . in the intermediate regime @xmath77 ,",
    "the test particle generally approaches complete thermalization . in the region",
    "where @xmath78 , the test particle thermalizes at a temperature significantly lower than the one of the reservoir , with a strong dependence upon the frequency .",
    "we have tested the dependence of the thermalization plot on the choice of the density of states of the heat bath , as show in fig .",
    "4 . keeping all the remaining parameters constant , the density of states is chosen to be proportional to @xmath79 , independent of @xmath80 , or proportional to @xmath81 in the three plots , in all cases within the same spectral interval ( and zero otherwise ) .",
    "it is apparent that for the global thermalization features it makes little difference whether the frequencies follow a uniform , square , or inverse square distribution ; the only difference is visible at the edges of the peak thermalization region , where the presence of more oscillators at lower or higher frequencies induces thermalization at slightly lower or higher frequencies of the test particle , respectively .",
    "considering the similarity among the various choices for the density of states , we have used the simplest uniform distributions in all subsequent simulations .",
    "the thermalization region can be understood by thinking of the case of a degenerate heat bath : if the test particle is in resonance with the bath oscillators , it will trade energy with them in an efficient way , and otherwise the energy exchange will be limited both in amplitude and speed . that the test particle thermalizes generally near the bandwidth of the heat bath is thus to be expected , although in some cases the effective frequency of the test particle in contact with the bath is sufficiently different than its natural frequency @xmath3 that the region of peak thermalization is shifted .",
    "since the effective frequency under the effect of the heat bath is renormalized as @xmath82 , if @xmath29 is significantly larger than zero we expect the resonance to occur at angular frequencies higher than the intrinsic angular frequency of the test particle , and this should only depend on @xmath29 .",
    "the shifts of the thermalization regions seen in fig .",
    "5 are in agreement with this scaling hypothesis .",
    "this has as a further implication a non monotonic dependence of the thermalization upon the mass ratio @xmath31 , which can not be trivially addressed in a perturbative approach @xcite . as already discussed in @xcite , the thermalization efficiency of the test particle at a given oscillation frequency",
    "is initially directly proportional to the mass ratio @xmath31 determining the coupling strength of the bath - test particle interaction , and then reaches an optimal value before the @xmath29-dependent renormalized frequency plays a role .",
    "another phenomenon worthy of note occurs in the high frequency region , where the thermalization curve is dependent upon the initial conditions of the test particle , as it is evident from the thermalization plots in the top plot of fig .",
    "6 . while at lower frequencies the particle thermalizes to the same temperature regardless of its initial energy , at higher frequencies it is effectively decoupled from the lower frequency heat bath .",
    "these energy distributions are reported in the bottom plots of fig .",
    "this non - markovian behavior can be understood as the classical counterpart of the dynamical decoupling techniques developed to protect a quantum system from environmentally induced decoherence @xcite , in which a system driven at a frequency much higher than the ultraviolet cut off of the bath is effectively decoupled . in this case",
    "the test particle oscillation frequency naturally provides a dynamical self - decoupling mechanism .",

    "here we discuss the case of a test particle connected to two heat baths with finite resources . in order to avoid simultaneous contact between the two baths through the test particle , which will eventually lead to their complete thermalization",
    ", we consider an intermittent interaction between the test particle and the baths . in this way ,",
    "as also tested at the end of each simulation , the two baths still preserve their original temperature and energy distribution for a weak bath - test particle coupling .",

    ", this also allows for an arbitrary partition of @xmath39 harmonic oscillators in @xmath103 different heat baths , each specified by different initial conditions and density of states . the matrix diagonalization method used in one - bath thermalization to solve the equations will not work now since it assumes the matrix @xmath55 does not change over time . in the two - bath case instead",

    "therefore we use a fourth order runge - kutta method to solve the equations , switching between @xmath101 and @xmath102 at each step ( @xmath104 in units of time steps of the runge - kutta code ) .",
    "this fast switching is the closest scenario to the case of a continuous interaction of the test particle with the two baths , maximizing the frustration of the test particle in equilibrating to each .",
    "simulations with switching times @xmath92 of 2 , 10 , and 20 time steps have been also performed yielding indistinguishable energy distributions within the statistical error . in the case of slow switching , _ i.e. _ for @xmath92 much longer than the thermalization time , the dynamics is complicated by the fact that the test particle , once thermalized with one bath , will have an initial condition with finite energy which can create a situation similar to the one discussed around fig .",
    "therefore thermalization may be actually affected by the energy acquired by the test particle prior to the interaction with the next bath . in the simplest case of two infinite bandwidth langevin baths as the one discussed in section ii.a , a thermalization to one bath first , and then to the other bath ,",
    "is expected instead , regardless of the test particle energy . in this case",

    "7 shows the energy distribution in the case of the test particle interacting with two baths at different temperatures .",
    "similar to the one bath case shown in @xcite , the energy distribution of the test particle reaches a boltzmann distribution when the frequency of the test particle is within the finite frequency spectrum of the bath particles , while the distribution becomes progressively less boltzmann when the frequency of the test particle moves outside the spectrum .",
    "8 shows the effect of the two baths with nominal equal temperature and density of states .",
    "the usual single bath thermalization curves when each of the baths is acting on the test particle are depicted in the top and middle plots , while the thermalization plot corresponding to their intermittent action is shown in the bottom plot .",
    "it is worth noticing that the optimal thermalization region of the test particle is shifted towards lower angular frequencies , and its temperature is slightly lower than the common temperature of the baths . in close analogy to the one bath case , one can then change the temperature of the two heat baths while keeping their density of state equal to each other . as shown in fig .",
    "9 , it is confirmed that the test particle s thermalization region is shifted towards significantly lower frequencies with respect to the thermalization curves for each separate heat bath .",
    "also , the test particle is observed to thermalize at a temperature lower than the average of the temperatures of the two baths .",
    "the average of the temperatures of the two baths is the effective temperature of the test particle expected for @xmath107 in the adiabatic switching limit when eq .",
    "[ noneq ] holds , since in that case the test particle effective temperature @xmath108 defined via the relationship : @xmath109/2\\ ] ] becomes simply @xmath110 up to terms of order @xmath111 .",
    "if we examine the lower thermalization temperature of the test particle more carefully , it seems to be a direct result from the shift of the thermalization region . since this shifted thermalization region",
    "is not the optimal region for single bath thermalization , the test particle does not thermalize with each of the two baths effectively .",
    "if we focus on the new optimal thermalization region , we can see that , although the test particle does not reach the average temperature of the two baths , it does get close to the average of two temperatures when the test particle thermalizes with the two baths separately in a narrow frequency range as shown in fig .",
    "both these features are also present in the complementary situation of two heat baths at the same temperature but with non overlapping density of states , as shown in fig .",
    "11 . in this case",
    ", while the test particle thermalizes at the common temperature of the heat baths when they are acting independently , in the intermittent case the two thermalization regions are redshifted and the test particle s temperature is nearly half of the heat baths. one possible explanation for this half thermalized temperature is that the test particle can not absorb much energy from the bath when its frequency is outside the frequency band of the bath as it has been shown in the one bath case .",
    "therefore a low frequency test particle does not receive energy from the particles in the high frequency bath , and thus it is as if the test particle is interacting with one bath at temperature 10 and the other bath at temperature 0 , and likewise for the high frequency test particle . in other words ,",
    "what matters is a sort of effective spectral temperature for the test particle , and if there are no oscillators around its proper frequency the corresponding bath is effectively at zero temperature . in fig .",
    "12 we show the combined effect of heat baths at different temperatures and different density of states . in the left plot",
    ", we display the case of the cold bath having oscillators at lower frequency ( and the hot bath with density of states shifted towards higher frequencies ) , with the test particle showing the expected thermalization to each bath at the expected temperature and in the same spectral region .",
    "when both baths are acting , the test particle displays similar features to the previous figures , _",
    "i.e. _ an effective temperature about half of the temperature of the bath operating in the same frequency region , and a redshift of the thermalization spectrum . in the right plot",
    ", we present the dual situation , with the cold bath having oscillators at higher frequency .",
    "we have studied finite resource reservoirs , showing that thermalization of a test particle occurs only under specific conditions in both the case of continuous interaction with a single bath and intermittent interaction with two baths with different features .",
    "these results may have an impact on the investigations of equilibrium and nonequilibrium quantum statistical mechanics of nanostructures , as first discussed in @xcite in the framework of quantum - limited electromechanical tunneling transducers .",
    "since then , many groups have pushed the sensitivity of displacement transducers for micro and nanoresonators near the quantum limit @xcite .",
    "three areas of current research could benefit from our discussions . in @xcite ,",
    "a phenomenon of cooling has been interpreted as due to quantum back - action of the read - out system .",
    "a more economical interpretation , without necessarily invoking the quantum features of the measurement apparatus , is instead available by imagining the effective temperature of the nanoresonator as resulting from the competition between two effective heat baths at different temperatures .",
    "this is also in line with the phenomenon of cold damping introduced eight decades ago @xcite , and demonstrated for macroscopic resonators in @xcite . from our perspective",
    ", the study of the thermalization of a particle in simultaneous interaction with two heat baths should shed light on this phenomenon already at the classical level , especially focusing on the energy distribution which , in the presence of finite resources , is not necessarily of boltzmann nature , and it could help to understand some intriguing features of the effective temperature found in the demonstration reported in @xcite . a second class of experiments which may benefit from our discussion are the ones involving very high frequency nanoresonators , as pioneered in @xcite . in our framework the existence of discrete jumps could be attributed to non - equilibrium features of the test particle , in this case a high - frequency mode of a nanomechanical structure . due to its geometry and size , the nanoresonator may have a density of states of the phonon bath with debye frequency much less than in the corresponding bulk situation .",
    "this should be confirmed by both dedicated experiments on thermal properties , such as specific heat and heat conductivity , and _ ab initio _ calculations of the density of states .",
    "our conjecture is that for lower dimensionality structures the debye frequency and the larger amount of relevant states may lie below the ghz range , _",
    "i.e. _ below the resonator frequency .",
    "the effective temperature felt by the test particle could then be quite different from the one expected by measuring the external bath to which the nanoresonator is coupled .",
    "non - equilibrium distributions are also expected in the case , not considered here , of test particles schematized in the quantum realm , for which even with a proper choice of observables deviations from the boltzmann energy distribution should be observed @xcite . finally , we believe that the careful design of some environments could help to extend quantum nondemolition measurements @xcite in nanomechanical devices .",
    "it is well known that quantum nondemolition measurements are suitable only for the case of harmonic oscillators .",
    "their extension to free particles in the form of measurements on carefully prepared contractive states @xcite or schroedinger cat states @xcite is quite problematic in practice .",
    "furthermore , the extension of quantum nondemolition measurements to generic nonlinear systems is also difficult , as it requires a specific knowledge of the initial state of the system @xcite .",
    "we believe that proper engineering of the environment surrounding the nanoresonator , with blockade of some frequency range for the exchanged phonons @xcite , corresponding in our model to a proper preparation of the density of states of the bath , will provide a robust and general way to reach and surpass the standard quantum limit .",
