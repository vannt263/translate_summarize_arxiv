    "weihai observatory ( who ) of shandong university is located at @xmath6 . made by the german apm company , the who 1-meter telescope ( whot ) , with an f/8 classic cassgerain design and equatorial fork mount mechanical structure , was installed in 2007 june .",
    "standard johnson - cousins ubvri and stromgren _ uvby _",
    "filters are mounted at the cassegrain focal plane for the photometric system . on more than 85% of observational nights , the seeing is better than 2.0@xmath4 and the median seeing is 1.7@xmath4 at who ( hu et al .",
    "sky brightness is influenced primarily by urban light pollution , which constrains the limiting magnitude of the photometry system .",
    "the faintest sky brightness is about 19.0 mag arcsec@xmath7 and the limiting magnitude with snr of 100 and exposure of 300 s is 16.2 for v band at who ( guo et al .",
    "2014 ; hu et al .",
    "the flexible scheduling character of whot allows for long - term monitoring programs with a focus on stellar astrophysics that mainly call for high - quality and high - resolution spectra . and",
    "the high resolution spectroscopic observations are less influenced than photometric observations because of high optical dispersion .    since the discovery of 51 peg b , the first exoplanet orbiting a solar - like star ( mayor & queloz 1995 ) , well over 2 900 exoplanets have been confirmed .",
    "the detection and characterisation of exoplanets are among the most popular topics in modern astronomy and astrophysics .",
    "the common methods for searching for exoplanets are radial velocity ( rv ) detection , transit detection and gravitational microlensing .",
    "high dispersion optical spectroscopic observations and high precision radial velocity ( prv ) measurements on exoplanets are important for searching for new planetary systems around dwarf and giant stars , and for determining the architecture of exoplanetary systems ( sato et al .",
    "many groups around the world have built successful spectrographs for these purposes , such as elodie ( baranne et al .",
    "1996 ) with which the first exoplanet ( 51 peg b ) was discovered , foces ( pfeiffer et al .",
    "1998 ) , feros ( kaufer et al . 1998 ) , coralie ( queloz & mayor 2001 ) , harps ( pepe et al . 2000 ) , hermes ( raskin et al . 2011 ) and caf ( aceituno et al .",
    "2013 ) .    as a complement to the current photometric measurement , the wes , designed and built by nanjing institute of astronomical optics & technology ( niaot ) , was installed in 2010 to exploit the telescope infrastructure .",
    "the design of wes was guided by the scientific need for a high - resolution spectrograph with a high optical efficiency and very high wavelength stability .",
    "like many high resolution spectrographs , the optical layout of wes is based on echelle grating , white pupil and fiber - fed design .",
    "the white pupil design with smaller cross - disperser size can reduce the scattered light emanating from the echelle gratings and avoids vignetting ( harrison et al .",
    "1976 ; baranne 1988 ; pfeiffer et al .",
    "the optical fibers can transmit the light of celestial object to a bench - mounted spectrograph installed in a stable environment which permits higher radial velocity measurement precison .",
    "the spectroscopic observation can provide data for the studies of metal abundance of stars , exoplanet mass determination , asteroseismology , etc .",
    "we give a description of the wes in sect .",
    "2 , including the telescope interface module , fiber optics , optical layout , and operating environment . in sect .",
    "3 , we describe the observations and data reduction . in sect .",
    "4 we present some data showing the performance of wes .",
    "the final section carries a brief summary and future prospects .",
    "the wes is designed for studies of metal abundance , stellar activity , and asteroseismology on nearby bright stars . in particular , it is specialized so as to have high rv measurement precision to search for and characterise giant exoplanets orbiting bright stars .",
    "precise radial velocity measurements are needed to detect the small amplitude reflex motion of an exoplanet s host star .",
    "so the most important design goal of wes is radial velocity measurement accuracy and stability ( e.g. , the stability in short - period is @xmath810 m / s for a 6th magnitude star with the exposure of 10 min and the measurement error of 2 m / s . ) .",
    "similar to most high resolution spectrographs , wes is also a cross - dispersed echelle spectrograph with a large 2k@xmath92k ccd chip which can image the complete visible spectrum in one exposure .",
    "wes adopts a fiber - fed mode and is installed in a very stable environment . the environment and mechanical design focus on holding the temperature constant and avoiding mechanical vibrations , which are critical for the high accuracy and stability of wavelength calibration .",
    "an iodine ( i@xmath10 ) cell can be placed into the beam to determine the instrumental profile ( ip ) , as is commonly used in exoplanet research ( butler et al .",
    "1996 ; valenti et al .",
    "1995 ) .",
    "the telescope interface module mounted at the cassegrain focal plane has two functions , one is for auto star guiding and injecting the light of flat field ( tungsten ) and thorium - argon ( thar ) calibration lamp into the fiber - head , the other is to change the observation mode between photometric system ( hu et al .",
    "2014 ) and spectroscopic system .",
    "[ figinterface ] shows the interface to telescope including the fiber - head , the telescope guiding system and the calibration unit .",
    "a 45@xmath11 tilt mirror mounted on a compact motorized translation stage can be moved into and out of the optical light path in front of the telescope focal plane , at the center of the telescope interface .",
    "the light from telescope is guided to the fiber - head when the 45@xmath11 pickoff mirror is moved in the optical light path .",
    "when the pickoff mirror is moved out , the light from telescope goes into the photometric system .",
    "the light of thar or flat - field lamp from the calibration unit simulates the focal ratio of telescope ( f/8 ) by the projection optics .",
    "a black circular shading is attached on a lens in the projection optics for simulating pupil of the telescope .",
    "the simulation of the light between telescope and calibration unit is very important for prv measurement because of instrument profile stability ( valenti et al .",
    "1995 ) .",
    "the fiber - head includes the entrance pinhole mirror mounted at the focal plane of telescope and the input microlens glued on the top of fiber .",
    "the microlens is used to re - image the telescope pupil onto the fiber which will be described in sect 2.2 .",
    "the diameter of the pinhole is decided by the median seeing at who which is 1.7@xmath4 ( hu et al .",
    "too much light will be lost if the diameter is too small .",
    "if the diameter of the pinhole is too large , all of the star image will fall into the pinhole , then it is not feasible to monitor the star position and we can not make sure that the illumination of fiber - head is uniform .",
    "the diameter of the pinhole is 0.1 mm corresponding to 2.6@xmath4 in the sky .",
    "the throughput of the pinhole is 80% at seeing=1.7@xmath4 condition calculated using the method of pfeiffer et al .",
    "( 1998 ) .",
    "the pinhole mirror is slightly inclined to reflect the star guiding image of @xmath12 field of view at the focal plane via another inclined mirror through guiding optics to a sbig st2000 xmi ccd .",
    "the guiding optics is telecentric with characteristics of constant magnification and geometry in all field of view , which is good for target identification and automatic guiding .",
    "[ figfiber]b shows an image of the guiding field .",
    "the guiding can be implemented on the overflow annulus of the science target when only the target appears in the field of view .",
    "we can also use another star in the field of view for manual or automatic offset guiding in the situation as shown in fig .",
    "[ figfiber]b .",
    "the telescope guiding also affects the instrumental profile ( ip ) of wes . a software for automatic guiding has been developed . because of the good tracking accuracy which can reach 0.6@xmath4 ( rms ) in 10 min of blind guiding ( hu et al . 2014 ) , the position of the target star is almost always centered on the pinhole during the long exposure ( @xmath830 - 60 minutes )",
    ".    the iodine cell can be moved in front of the fiber - head automatically .",
    "the iodine absorption lines superimposed on the stellar spectra provide a stable reference for measuring stellar radial velocities ( marcy & butler 1992 ) .",
    "the cell is a sealed glass cylinder with a diameter of 50 mm and an optical path of 40 mm .",
    "the cell is covered with distributed strips of heating tape and mounted in the center of a vacuum vessel .",
    "the iodine molecules in the cell fully evaporate at 65 @xmath11c . in order to make sure that the iodine molecules fully evaporate without thermal broadening of the i@xmath13 features , the temperature controller maintains the cell at 65 @xmath11c after a 5 minutes warm - up during our prv observations .      using fiber optics to feed the spectrograph",
    ", we could mount wes in a thermally and mechanically isolated environment to provide an exceptionally stable echelle order image on the ccd for exoplanet research by the radial velocity method .",
    "the focal - ratio degradation ( frd ) is small from about f/3.0 to about f/7.0 , for most popular fibers used on astronomy ( ramsey 1988 ) . behind the pinhole mirror with an entrance aperture , a microlens glued on top of the fiber images the telescope pupil onto its rear surface with a diameter of 46 @xmath14 m filling 92% of the 50 @xmath14 m core fibre s entrance - surface , with a focal ratio of f/3.67 which is well - suited to minimizing frd in the fibre optics ( fig .  [ figfiber]a )",
    "the focal ratio is still @xmath8f/3.7 at the other end of the fibre .",
    "the microlens at fiber - exit produces an f/10 light cone which is the same as the focal - ratio of collimator of the spectrograph .",
    "an adjustable slit is placed in the position of fiber - exit re - imaging .",
    "the parameters of the fiber optics are summarized in table  [ tabfiber ] and shown in fig .",
