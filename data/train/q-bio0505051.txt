    "the position of the molecule at time @xmath11 is obtained by adding random displacement to the current position where distribution of random displacements obeys ( [ eq : gauss ] ) .",
    "generally , time steps @xmath10 do not have to be kept constant . in our simulation",
    "we use adaptive @xmath10 in order to focus computational effort on important time segments . because diffusion and unimolecular reactions are the only processes that take place in the region far away from the membrane , one can use longer time steps in that region than in the region near the membrane where , in addition , bimolecular processes occur .",
    "these two regions are defined using two free model parameters @xmath4 and @xmath5  characteristic distances from the membrane ( fig .",
    "[ fig : bacteria ] ) . in the region",
    "far away from the membrane ( @xmath19 ) time step used is significantly longer than time step used in the region near the membrane ( @xmath6 ) . in the transitional region ( @xmath20 )",
    "time step is gradually decreased when approaching the membrane , to avoid that molecules entering the region near the membrane diffuse too far , avoiding on their path bimolecular reactions .",
    "for the same reason , time step @xmath10 in the region near the membrane has to be chosen such that condition @xmath21 is satisfied .    in our model ,",
    "parameter @xmath4 is also used as the reaction radius parameter for all bimolecular reactions .",
    "hence , the cytoplasmic mind : atp molecule can attach to the membrane only when it is in the region near the membrane . probability for this reaction is given by the simple intuitive formula : @xmath22 the probability is proportional to time step @xmath10  the longer you wait it is more probable for a reaction to take place  and inversely proportional to @xmath4 to ensure that the number of reactions taking place depends only on the reaction rate parameter @xmath23 and not on the model parameter @xmath4 used to define the near membrane region .",
    "if the reaction occurs , the molecule attaches to the membrane with random orientation .",
    "however , our model forbids this reaction to take place if the position where the molecule should bind is already occupied by another mind : atp .",
    "additionally , cytoplasmic mind : atp can react with mind : atp molecules already attached to the membrane .",
    "experimental data suggest that mind : atp attached to the membrane polymerizes into two - stranded filaments @xcite . lacking experimental data on the interaction between membrane - associated mind : atp molecules",

    "the probability for cytoplasmic mind : atp to occupy any free attachment site that is within reaction radius ( @xmath24 ) depends on the reaction rate @xmath25 : @xmath26    an attachment of mine to the membrane - associated mind : atp complex can take place if molecules are within the interaction radius ( @xmath24 ) and there is no mine molecule already attached .",
    "the probability for this reaction is @xmath27    mine protein in the membrane - associated mine - mind : atp complex stimulates detachment of the complex from the membrane by inducing atp hydrolysis . the probability for this reaction might depend on the number of bonds particular mind : atp has formed with its mind : atp neighbors , and we assume that the number of bonds established decreases the reaction probability . let @xmath28 , @xmath29 stand for the detachment reaction rate when the mind molecule has @xmath30 bonds established .",

    "@xcite used in their analytical model .",
    "however , they use only one hydrolysis rate parameter , while in our model there are four  @xmath28 , @xmath29  which obey ( [ eq : de ] ) with the ratio : @xmath41 other ratios have been tested also .",
    "it is found that it is essential to take @xmath42 significantly smaller than @xmath43 in order to generate oscillations , whose period primarily ( and strongly ) depends on the parameter @xmath44 . in the case",
    "when all @xmath28 were taken to be identical , the oscillations could not be produced even if other parameters of the model were varied substantially .    in our simulation",
    "we use 4000 mind molecules and 1400 mine homodimers , reflecting the _ in vivo _",
    "situation @xcite .",
    "the two - stranded filament width and the mind monomer length are fixed to 6 and 5  nm , respectively @xcite .",
    "the model is evolved in time with time step @xmath45  sec for processes far from the membrane ( @xmath46  @xmath47 m ) and @xmath48  sec for processes near the membrane ( @xmath49  @xmath47 m ) . in the transitional region time steps",
    "are gradually decreased when approaching the membrane .",
    "we have tested the simulation by significantly varying parameters @xmath4 and @xmath10 and the same results were obtained .    with these parameters",
    "we have reproduced pole - to - pole mind / mine oscillations ( figs .",
    "[ fig : ortgoproja ]  and  [ fig : histograms ] ) with the period @xmath50  sec , which is compatible with experimentally observed range ( @xmath51  sec ) @xcite .",
    "initially , all mine and mind are placed in the center of the bacterium .",
    "other initial distributions were tried ( e.g. , uniform distribution ) , and the same type of oscillations always appeared after the transient period lasting up to one oscillation cycle .",
    "distributions of the membrane - associated mind / mine proteins do not oscillate in phase  mine distribution lags after mind distribution ( fig .",
    "[ fig : histograms ] ) .",
    "this phenomenon has been seen in experiments , and it was described as an oscillating mine ring @xcite . however , when time - averaged both distributions have a minimum in the middle of the cell ( last row in the fig .",
    "[ fig : histograms ] ) which reflects distribution necessary for proper cell division .",
    "this minimum is experimentally observed only in the case of the mind protein oscillation @xcite . for the time - averaged mine distribution",
    "there are only model predictions and they disagree on this point ; e.g. , there are models which predict , in contrast to our model prediction , that the time - averaged mine distribution has a maximum in the middle of the cell @xcite .    to confirm its robustness , the model was additionally tested for a variety of experimentally observed phenomena .",
    "@xcite have found experimentally that the oscillation period increases with the cell length .",
    "the overexpression experiments reveal that the oscillation period increases with the amount of mind , and decreases with the amount of mine @xcite .",
    "all these phenomena are reproduced with our model ( fig .",
    "[ fig : overex ] ) .",
    "consistent with experiments @xcite , in the case of filamentous cells the zebra - striped oscillation pattern is obtained spontaneously ( fig .",
    "[ fig : filament ] ) , starting with uniform distributions of mind and mine .    in our model ,",
    "mind proteins attached to the membrane predominately form two - stranded filaments [ fig .",
    "[ fig : ortgoproja](b ) ] .",
    "this is achieved by imposing the ratio ( [ eq : ratio ] ) to the parameters @xmath28 which are responsible for dynamics of both formation and decomposition of two - stranded filaments .",
    "the imposed ratio strongly favors two - stranded configurations over a group of single molecules  the probability for a group of single molecules to be detached from the membrane is considerably greater than that for the same group of molecules , but in the form of the two - stranded filament .",
    "the filament appears as an alive object .",
    "it is degraded and rebuilt constantly .",
    "when it grows in size the building process dominates over the degrading process .",
    "both processes preferentially take place at the filament s end .",
    "mind molecules located at the end of the filament can form one or two bonds with its neighbors , while other mind molecules have probably established three bonds .",
    "because of ( [ eq : ratio ] ) it is more probable for mine to detach mind molecules locate the filament s end . if the building process dominates over the degrading process , detached mind molecules will probably be replaced with cytoplasmic mind : atp molecules .    however , as the concentration of mind molecules attached to the membrane reaches its peak , the concentration of cytoplasmic mind : atp goes to its minimum . at that time the degrading process dominates over the building process .",
    "cytoplasmic mine molecules continue to attach to the mind molecules of the two - stranded filament .",
    "mind released into cytoplasm by mine is in the form of the mind : adp complex and can not bind to the membrane .",
    "however , mine released into the cytoplasm by the same process attach to free attachment sites on the filament , thus speeding up its decomposition .",
    "the average length of filaments obtained with our model depends on the model parameters , particularly on @xmath25 and @xmath23 .",
    "if we increase the parameter @xmath25 and/or decrease the parameter @xmath23 , the probability for attaching mind to the filament already formed on the membrane ( regulated by @xmath25 ) will increase with respect to the probability for starting a new filament formation ( regulated by @xmath23 ) .",
    "hence , the average length of filaments is increased ( fig  [ fig : longerfil ] ) . in order to keep the period of oscillation similar to the period for the case shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ortgoproja ] , hydrolysis rate parameters were modified : @xmath52 , while the same ratio ( [ eq : ratio ] ) was obeyed .    in conclusion ,",
    "we have introduced 3d stochastic reaction - diffusion model to describe mind / mine dynamical structures in _",
    "e. coli_. in particular , our model spontaneously generates two - stranded filaments using a few simple physical assumptions .",
