    "the control of growth - induced surface roughness is therefore a central concern in thin film science and technology .",
    "two types of roughening mechanisms have been extensively studied in recent years @xcite .",
    "the term _ kinetic roughening _ is commonly used to refer to a _ stochastic _ mechanism , in which fluctuations in the deposition flux interact with thermal smoothening to generate a scale - invariant , rough morphology .",
    "this theoretically appealing but empirically rather elusive phenomenon @xcite is often superseded by a second , _",
    "mechanism , a _ growth instability _ associated with reduced interlayer transport and slope - dependent mass currents along the surface @xcite .",
    "the hallmark of unstable growth is a morphology of more or less regular mounds with a clearly developed characteristic length scale . while in practice the distinction between the two types of roughening mechanisms",
    "may not always be so clear - cut @xcite , they are very different conceptually .    in addition to the growth - induced roughness , clearly also",
    "the roughness of the substrate affects the film morphology . since the growing film covers up the small - scale details of the substrate modulations , the substrate contribution to the roughness",
    "is expected to decrease with increasing film thickness , while the growth - induced roughness component increases . under suitable conditions",
    "this leads to the somewhat counterintuitive possibility of a _ minimum _ of the total surface roughness at a nonzero film thickness .",
    "this phenomenon has been observed in several growth experiments @xcite , and a theoretical description has been worked out on the level of linear continuum theories of kinetic roughening @xcite and unstable growth @xcite .    in ref.@xcite a quantitative comparison with the experiments of gyure et al.@xcite",
    "was attempted , which indicated an important influence of nonlinearities .",
    "this motivated the present study , in which the nonlinear term in the growth equation is treated explicitly using the spherical approximation of phase ordering kinetics @xcite .",
    "we find that the interplay of instability , nonlinearity and noise gives rise to a rather complex behavior , in which the position of the roughness minimum can be determined by several distinct physical mechanisms .",
    "for a quick overview of the different regimes we refer the curious reader to table i.    the paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we introduce the standard continuum equation for unstable homoepitaxial growth @xcite and describe the strategy for its analytical solution .",
    "section [ det ] is devoted to the roughness evolution in the absence of noise .",
    "we first recapitulate the linear analysis of ref.@xcite , then provide a detailed analysis of the relevance of the nonlinearity and the nonlinear behavior , and finally discuss the influence of correlated initial roughness .",
    "the effects of noise are analyzed in section [ noise ] . in section [ numerics ]",
    "we compare the analytic estimates to a numerical evaluation of the spherical approximation , as well as to numerical simulations of the full nonlinear growth equation , finding good agreement in all cases .",

    "the second term models a growth - induced surface current , whose existence is often ( but not necessarily  @xcite ) caused by the presence of an ehrlich - schwoebel barrier for interlayer diffusion . we assume in - plane",

    "conditions of weak and strong step edge barriers can be distinguished according to whether @xmath26 ( strong barriers ) or @xmath27 ( weak barriers ) @xcite . here",
    "we focus on the latter case , in which a continuum description is most likely to be valid .    the coefficients @xmath28 and @xmath29 in eqs.([j],[f ] ) are related to microscopic parameters by @xmath30 , @xmath31 @xcite .",
    "we will for simplicity assume that the equality sign holds in these formulas ; however numerical factors are not precisely known and the equalities should be intended instead only in order of magnitude .",

    "this problem is most evident in this case dominated by conserved noise , as the power - law tail of the @xmath245 is broader .    in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] the value of the roughness of the fully nonlinear case and of the large-@xmath34 approximation are plotted in the case where nonconserved noise dominates .",
    "again , the analytical value @xmath246 matches quite well the numerical results .    the same quantities are reported in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] for values of the parameters such that both noise and nonlinearities are irrelevant . in this case , the analytical prediction for the position of the minimum is the one provided by linear theory @xmath247 .",
    "also in this case , the agreement between numerics and the theoretical prediction is good .",
    "notice that for these values of the parameters the naive condition  ( [ 21krug ] ) for the irrelevance of nonlinearity is violated .",
    "however , the nonlinear contribution to the current  ( [ current ] ) is initially large but rapidly decays , so that it does not influence the position of the minimum . the initial deviation from linearity",
    "can also be seen in the behavior of @xmath103 , plotted in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] .",
    "the position of the minimum is instead determined by the nonlinearity in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] : here linear theory would predict @xmath248 , while the roughness keeps decreasing until @xmath249 in reasonable agreement with the analytical estimate @xmath250 given by eq .",
    "( [ tmin2 ] ) .",
    "the nonlinear behavior is also evident in the inset , where @xmath103 is plotted : it is proportional to @xmath251 as predicted by eq .",
    "( [ bd ] ) .    finally , in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] the roughness in the most nonlinear case ( @xmath252 ) is shown . in this case",
    "the linear theory would predict @xmath253 , while eq .",
    "( [ tmin3 ] ) yields @xmath254 .",
    "the numerical result @xmath255 is again close to the estimate provided by nonlinear theory .",
    "consistently @xmath103 grows as @xmath256 ( fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] , inset ) .",
    "in summary , for initial values of the roughness ranging from very small to very large we find that the evolution of the fully nonlinear equation is well approximated by the large-@xmath34 limit and that the analytical estimates found above agree with the numerical results .",
    "the large-@xmath34 limit describes quite precisely this early stage behavior because , up to the time when the minimum is reached , the dynamics makes the surface smoother , reducing slope fluctuations and making the approximation @xmath257 increasingly more accurate . only after the minimum , when the instability takes over , slope fluctuations grow , leading to the breakdown of the large-@xmath34 approximation .",
    "in the previous sections we have carried out a rather complete analysis of the non monotonic behavior of the roughness of a surface which evolves according to the continuum equation for unstable growth . it must be stressed that an initial decrease of the roughness is not necessarily due to a `` rough '' substrate , in the sense of surface width exceeding some threshold .",
    "no matter how small the substrate fluctuations , if they extend to a length scale smaller than that of the linear instability , the roughness will initially decrease .",
    "only if substrate fluctuations are limited to relatively large length scales , big amplitudes are needed .",
    "the initial decrease of the roughness is always governed by the relaxational mullins - like term .",
    "the moment when this initial decrease ends depends instead crucially on the value of @xmath4 ( i.e. on the initial roughness ) : the minimum may be accounted for by linear ( noisy or deterministic ) or nonlinear theory .",
    "interestingly , for realistic values of the diffusion length @xmath5 and of the ratio @xmath107 , the different regimes are nonoverlapping : it is in principle possible to see each behavior by simply changing @xmath1 , i. e. the initial roughness .",
    "it is clear , of course , that this is not necessarily true in practice , since experimentally realizable values of @xmath4 are limited .",
    "notice , however , that @xmath4 depends on two quantities , @xmath1 and @xmath2 , and also the variation of the latter could help in expanding the range of variation of experimentally realizable values of @xmath4",
    ". moreover the presence of correlations in the initial roughness enhances the effect of nonlinearity .    with regards to the experimental relevance of the present results it is natural to compare them with the recent data of gyure _",
    "et al._@xcite . the comparison of linear theory with the same data  @xcite pointed out the violation of the naive condition for the irrelevance of nonlinearity , eq .",
    "( [ 21krug ] ) .",
    "as shown above the correct condition for the irrelevance is different ( eq .  ( [ 21nonlin ] ) ) and turns out to be fulfilled : the substrate is such that nonlinearity does not matter . on the other hand ,",
    "the experimental parameters give @xmath258 and @xmath259 , indicating that nonconserved noise mostly dictates the position of the minimum .",
    "this conclusion is at odds with the results of ref .",
    "the mismatch is due to a different treatment of numerical prefactors and should not be taken too seriously : the precision of values determined from experimental data is poor and already introduces large uncertainty in the physical parameters .",
    "however , even if precise experimental data were available a very detailed comparison between theory and experiment would not be possible , because formulas linking parameters of the continuum equation ( @xmath260 ) with physical quantities ( @xmath261 ) are known only in order of magnitude . improved determination of the numerical prefactors would surely be an important contribution to this field of research .",
    "we have considered here only the form  ( [ current ] ) of the unstable current , which is valid in the limit of small es barriers and does not vanish for finite slopes .",
    "other forms of the current are commonly used for large es barriers ( @xmath26 ) or when the current vanishes for some `` magic '' value of the slope .",
    "the previous analysis can be performed along the same lines for these alternative currents .",
    "we do not expect qualitatively different results .",
    "in particular , no special behavior should be induced by the presence of magic slopes , since the initial decay of fluctuations governed by the mullins - like term quickly washes out large slopes independently from the expression of the current .",
    ".analytical estimates of the position of the minimum depending on the substrate roughness parameter @xmath262 .",
