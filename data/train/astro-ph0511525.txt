    "the gas phase si abundance is about 5% of solar in cool clouds @xcite and the depleted atoms are thought to reside in interstellar grains . according to the observations of uv absorption lines , si shows a systematic trend of depletion with the density of the diffuse cloud as well as mg and fe @xcite , whereas the depletion of fe is suggested not to continue to increase with either density or extinction for @xmath10  @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "@xcite suggested that fe has the greatest fraction of its atoms incorporated into dust followed by mg and si , and suggested oxides and/or metallic fe as the grain core population .",
    "@xcite showed that the gas - phase abundance of si and fe is well correlated with each other to some extent , but the degree of returning to the gas phase is different between the two : it is easier for si to return to the gas than for fe .",
    "this suggests that at least part of si and fe atoms constitute independent grain populations .",
    "@xcite examined the relation among the depletion of si , mg , and fe , suggesting that si in dust is preferentially eroded with respect to mg and that both of these elements are preferentially eroded with respect to fe .",
    "this can not completely be explained by mechanical sputtering process , indicating some chemically selective processes involved or the presence of si in phases other than refractory silicates .",
    "@xcite showed that the gas - to - dust ratio in the local ism is well correlated with the fraction of the dust mass carried by fe .",
    "this indicates that fe forms a robust core that is not destroyed during grain processing in the ism .",
