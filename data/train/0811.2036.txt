    "the recent discovery of @xmath0 topological insulators , a band insulator with particular topological characters of bloch wavefunctions , came as a surprise .",

    "@xcite as in an iqh state in the bulk , they are characterized by a topological invariant ( @xmath0 invariant ) . as in an iqh state with boundaries ,",
    "they support stable gapless boundary states that are robust against perturbations . on the other hand , unlike the iqh states , time - reversal symmetry ( trs ) is a prerequisite to the existence of @xmath0 topological insulators . in fact , as soon as the trs of a @xmath0 topological insulator is broken , it becomes possible to deform in a continuous manner a band insulator with a trivial @xmath0 topological number into one with a non - trivial @xmath0 number .",
    "time - reversal symmetry for spin 1/2 particles is not the only discrete symmetry for which a topological distinction of quantum ground states arises . a systematic and exhaustive classification of topological band insulators and mean - field superconductors has been proposed in ref .",
    "by relying on the discrete symmetries of relevance to the theory of random matrices .",
    "@xcite in three spatial dimensions , it was shown that , besides the @xmath0 topological insulator in the symplectic symmetry class , there are precisely four more symmetry classes in which topological insulators and/or superconductors are possible .",
    "@xcite for three out of the five symmetry classes of random matrix theory , we introduced a topological invariant @xmath1 ( winding number ) , which distinguishes several different topological insulators / superconductors , just like the chern integer distinguishes different iqh states in two dimensions .",
    "@xcite    while the classification given in ref .",
    "is for non - interacting fermionic systems , strong correlations among electrons ( or spins ) might spontaneously give rise to these topological phases , by forming a nontrivial band structure for some , possibly emergent , fermionic excitations ( e.g. , spinons ) .",
    "@xcite it is the purpose of this paper to demonstrate how topological insulators ( superconductors ) emerge as a result of strong correlations .",
    "we will show that it is possible to design an interacting bosonic model with emergent majorana fermion excitations , the ground state of which is a topological insulator ( superconductor ) with non - vanishing winding number , @xmath2 .",
    "our model is a natural generalization of the spin-1/2 model on the honeycomb lattice introduced by kitaev@xcite to the three - dimensional diamond lattice with four dimensional hilbert space per site .",
    "the kitaev model on the honeycomb lattice has two types of phases : the so - called abelian and non - abelian phases .",
    "the abelian phase is equivalent to the toric code model @xcite and an exactly solvable model proposed by wen , @xcite which in turn is described by a @xmath0 gauge theory . on the other hand ,",
    "the non - abelian phase is in the universality class of the moore - read pfaffian state .",
    "each phase corresponds to the weak and strong pairing phases of two - dimensional spinless chiral @xmath3-wave superconductor , respectively , @xcite the latter of which is an example of a topological superconductor in symmetry class d of altland - zirnbauer classification in two dimensions .",
    "@xcite    similarly to the kitaev model on the honeycomb lattice , the ground state of our model can be obtained from a majorana fermionic ground state ( with a suitable projection procedure ) .",
    "our model has two phases , which we also call strong and weak pairing phases .",
    "in particular , in the weak pairing phase , the ground state is given by a topological superconducting state in symmetry class diii of altland - zirnbauer classification , and in the universality class of a three - dimensional analogue of the moore - read pfaffian state discussed in ref .  .",
    "the b phase of @xmath4 is also in this universality class . @xcite .",
    "the topological character of the ground state is protected by a discrete symmetry transformation , which is a combination of time - reversal and a four - fold discrete rotation , the latter of which forms a subgroup of a continuous u(1 ) symmetry of our model .",
    "spin-1/2 models of kitaev type on the diamond lattice , and on other three - dimensional lattices have been constructed .",
    "@xcite for these models , however , there is no phase analogous to the non - abelian phase in the original kitaev model , and the ground states discussed there have a vanishing winding number .",
    "extensions of the spin 1/2 kitaev model to models with 4-dimensional hilbert space per site have been studied in refs .  .",
    "we start by describing the local hilbert space of our model , defined as it is at each site of some lattice .",
