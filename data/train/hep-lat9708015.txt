    "with the progress in recent years of quenched simulations of qcd , deviations of the quenched hadron spectrum from experiment are being uncovered . for heavy quark systems precise calculations with nrqcd",
    "have shown that the fine structure of quarkonium spectra can be reproduced only if sea quark effects are taken into account @xcite .",
    "for the light hadron sector several reports have been made that strange quark mass can not be set consistently from pseudo scalar and vector meson channels in quenched qcd @xcite .",
    "most recently results of an extensive quenched simulation on the cp - pacs indicate that there is a systematic disagreement in the spectrum of baryons @xcite .",
    "clearly the time has come to bolster efforts toward full qcd simulations .",
    "we have recently started an attempt in this direction using the cp - pacs computer @xcite .",
    "full qcd simulations are , however , extremely computer time consuming compared to those of quenched qcd . even with the tflops - class computers that are becoming available , high statistics studies , indispensable for reliable results , will be difficult for lattice sizes exceeding @xmath2 . since a physical lattice size of @xmath3 - 3.0fm",
    "is needed to avoid finite - size effects @xcite , the smallest lattice spacing one can reasonably reach will be @xmath4gev .",
    "hence lattice discretization errors have to be controlled with simulations carried out at an inverse lattice spacing smaller than this value .",
    "this will be a difficult task with the standard plaquette and wilson quark actions since discretization errors are of order 20 - 30% even at @xmath4gev @xcite .",
    "this leads us to consider improved actions for our simulation of full qcd .",
    "studies of improved actions have been widely pursued in the last few years .",
    "detailed tests of improvement for hadron spectrum , however , have been mostly carried out within quenched qcd ( see , _",
    "e.g. _ , refs .",
    "@xcite ) , and only a few studies are available for the case of full qcd @xcite . in particular",
    "a systematic investigation of how various terms added to the gauge and quark actions , taken separately , affect light hadron observables has not been carried out in full qcd .",
    "we have decided to undertake such a study as the first subject of our full qcd program . in this article",
    "we report preliminary results of this on - going attempt .",

    "cols=\"^,<,<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     = 6.8 cm = 6.8 cm    = 6.8 cm = 6.8 cm    a similar effect has been observed in quenched qcd by the ukqcd collaboration in simulations with the  combination at @xmath6 - 6.2 ( @xmath7 - 2.5gev ) @xcite , and also in a study with improved gluon actions and the clover and d234 quark actions at coarse lattice spacings of @xmath8 - 0.7gev @xcite .",
    "it is therefore more natural to associate the origin of the effect to valence quarks rather than to dynamical sea quarks in full qcd . nonetheless ,",
    "changing the gluon and quark actions one at a time , we have been able to see clearly a decisive role played by the clover term in improving the spectrum in a quantitative detail in the context of full qcd . in this regard , improving the gluon action has much less effect .    in table",
    "[ tab : results ] we compile our results for the @xmath9 parameter , @xmath10 at @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "here again the clover term brings the values into better agreement with the experimental value of 0.48(2 ) .",
    "another interesting feature in our hadron mass data is that they exhibit a negative curvature in terms of @xmath12 toward the chiral limit .",
    "this is in contrast to quenched qcd where hadron masses ( mass squared for pseudo scalar mesons ) are generally well described by a linear function of @xmath12 up to quite heavy quark .",
    "the curvature is reduced if hadron masses are plotted against @xmath13 , but still remains at a significant level , especially for the  combination .",
    "this is possibly a full qcd effect due to sea quarks which increasingly ordered gauge configurations toward the chiral limit . for results with clover",
    "quark actions the trend may be enhanced by the dependence of @xmath14 on @xmath15 due to tadpole improvement .",
    "the curvature causes a practical difficulty in the chiral extrapolation of hadron masses since our runs have so far been made with at most three values of @xmath15 . for the estimates of @xmath16 in table  [ tab : results ] we employed a linear fit of hadron masses in the measured values of @xmath13 ,",
    "excluding for the  case the point of heaviest quark mass .    in this connection",
    "we note that a comparison such as in fig .",
    "[ fig : epn ] and for @xmath9 in table  [ tab : results ] should be made at the same lattice spacing in physical units .",
    "as we see in table  [ tab : results ] our estimate of @xmath16 shows a spread of some 20 - 30% depending on the actions .",
    "additional runs are being conducted in an effort to match the lattice spacing more precisely .",
    "another point to note is that an agreement with the phenomenological formula of ref .",
    "@xcite examined in fig .",
    "[ fig : epn ] is not an improvement criterion that follows from theoretical principles , albeit a reasonable one in view of the success of the formula for describing the experimental spectrum .",
    "stability of results toward smaller lattice spacing has to be checked , which we hope to pursue in future simulations .",
    "we plot typical results for the static quark potential in fig .",
    "[ fig : pot ] for which @xmath17 .",
    "conversion to physical units is made with the lattice scale given in table  [ tab : results ] .",
    "different symbols correspond to potential data measured in different spatial directions along the vector given in the figure .    for the  action rotational symmetry is badly violated . improving the quark action ( )",
    "we observe that the potential exhibits a much better rotational symmetry . at present",
    "how much of the improvement is due to the change of the quark action is not clear since the lattice spacing for the   case ( @xmath18gev ) is about 20% smaller than for the case of  ( @xmath7gev ) , from which one expects a 40% reduction in the violation of rotational symmetry .",
    "the best improvement is achieved with the  and  actions .",
    "it is known that the gauge action  significantly improves rotational symmetry already for the quenched case @xcite .",
    "the improvement naturally carries over to the present case of full qcd .    with our present statistics",
    "the potential can be measured with small errors up to a distance of @xmath19fm . in this distance range",
    "we do not observe flattening of the potential due to pair creation and annihilation effects .",
    "in fact the potential can be well described by a linear plus coulomb form @xmath20 .",
    "we extract the string tension @xmath21 by fitting potential data to this form .",
    "we then use the phenomenological value @xmath22 to convert results to an estimate of @xmath23 for each value of @xmath15 .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : a ] we compare the value of @xmath23 obtained in this way ( filled circles ) with that from @xmath24mev , also calculated for each value of @xmath15 ( open circles ) . for the latter quantity ,",
    "results obtained after an extrapolation of @xmath25 to the chiral limit are also shown .",
    "this extrapolation is linear for @xmath23 when we take @xmath26 as the horizontal axis , as adopted in fig .",
    "[ fig : a ] .",
    "we observe that the two estimates converge to a consistent value in the chiral limit for the  and  combinations , while an apparent deviation of order 40% and 20% are indicated for the cases of  and respectively .",
    "of course we expect the discrepancy observed for the last two cases with the wilson quark action to disappear in the continuum limit .",
    "the agreement found for the  and  cases show that the clover term helps improve the consistency of the two determinations of the physical scale of lattice spacing already at @xmath18gev .",
    "the static quark potential at short distances is directly relevant to the spectrum of heavy quark systems .",
    "a recent nrqcd calculation carried out on gauge configurations generated with the kogut - susskind action for sea quark and the plaquette gluon action at @xmath27 shows a significant deviation between the scale determined from the heavy and light hadron spectrum@xcite",
    ". it would be interesting to check for our  and  cases if the lattice scale determined from heavy quark systems yield results consistent with those from @xmath21 and @xmath28 .",
    "our comparative study has shown that the clover term of sheikholeslami and wohlert drastically improves light hadron spectrum already at @xmath0 - 1.3gev . while improving the gauge action has much less effect in this regard , we expect good rotational symmetry of static quark potential , which is achieved with the action , to be important for heavy quark systems .",
    "our results lead us to believe that a significant step forward towards a realistic simulation of full lattice qcd , encompassing both heavy and light hadrons , can be achieved with the current generation of dedicated parallel computers with the application of improved actions .",
    "we are particularly encouraged to pursue the use of the combination  toward this goal .",
