    "the study of geometrical and topological properties of classical non - abelian gauge theories turned out to be very important for our understanding of non - perturbative aspects of the corresponding quantum field theories .",
    "the configuration space of the theory is the gauge orbit space , which is obtained by factorizing the space of connections with respect to the action of the group of local gauge transformations .",
    "this space has the structure of a stratified set , because , usually , besides the principal orbit type also non - generic orbit types occur . these may give rise to singularities of the configuration space .",
    "first , the generic , or principal , stratum was investigated  leading to a deeper understanding of the gribov - ambiguity @xcite and of anomalies in terms of index theorems @xcite .",
    "in particular , one gets anomalies of purely topological type , which can not be seen by perturbative quantum field theory @xcite .",
    "next , in a paper by kondracki and rogulski @xcite , a systematic study of the structure of the full gauge orbit space was presented . in particular , it was shown that the gauge orbit space is a stratified topological space in the ordinary sense , cf .",
    "@xcite and references therein .",
    "there are partial results and conjectures concerning the physical relevance of nongeneric strata .",
    "first of all , nongeneric gauge orbits affect the classical motion on the orbit space due to boundary conditions and , in this way , may produce nontrivial contributions to the path integral .",
    "they may also lead to localization of certain quantum states , as it was suggested by finite - dimensional examples @xcite .",
    "further , the gauge field configurations belonging to nongeneric orbits can possess a magnetic charge , i.e. they can be considered as a kind of magnetic monopole configurations , which seem to be related to the quark confinement problem in chern - simons theory @xcite . finally , it was suggested in @xcite that non - generic strata may lead to additional anomalies .    most of the problems mentioned here are still awaiting a systematic investigation . in a series of papers we are going to make a new step in this direction . in @xcite we have presented a complete solution to the problem of determining the strata that are present in the gauge orbit space for @xmath2 gauge theories in compact euclidean space - time of dimension @xmath3 .",
    "the basic idea behind is the 1 - 1-correspondence between orbit types and equivalence classes of so - called holonomy - induced howe subbundles of the principal @xmath4bundle , where the gauge connections of the theory under consideration live on .",
    "it turns out that howe subgroups of @xmath4 as well as ( holonomy - induced ) howe subbundles can be classified , leading to a classification of orbit types in terms of certain algebraical and topological data . as a first application , we have shown in @xcite that  within the context of chern - simons theory in @xmath5 dimensions  the property of a configuration to be nodal in the sense of asorey ,",
    "see @xcite , is a property of strata . for a given model of this type , the nodal strata can be easily determined .    in @xcite",
    "one basic problem was left open : the determination of the natural partial ordering in the set of orbit types . in the present paper",
    "we solve this problem .",
    "first , in section [ sprev ] we recall the classification of gauge orbit types from @xcite . in section [ parord ]",
    "we prove that the natural partial ordering is characterized by a system of algebraic equations relating the classifying data via a matrix with non - negative integer entries ( inclusion matrix ) .",
    "the inclusion matrix can be visualized by a bratteli diagram , as explained in section [ bratteli ] . in sections",
    "[ dirsuc ] and [ dirpred ] direct successors and direct predecessors are characterized . in particular , operations which generate the direct successors ( splitting and merging ) and the direct predecessors ( inverse splitting and inverse merging ) are defined .",
    "finally , an example is discussed : for gauge group @xmath6 and some space - time manifolds the complete hasse diagram of the set of orbit types is derived .",
    "let @xmath7 be a principal @xmath2-bundle over a compact , connected , orientable riemannian manifold @xmath8 of dimension @xmath9 .",
    "let @xmath10 and @xmath11 denote the sets of connection forms and gauge transformations , respectively , of sobolev class @xmath12 .",
    "provided @xmath13 , @xmath10 is an affine hilbert space and @xmath14 is a hilbert lie group acting smoothly from the right on @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "if we view gauge transformations as equivariant maps @xmath15 then for @xmath16 and @xmath17 the action is given by @xmath18 let @xmath19 denote the quotient topological space @xmath20 .",
    "this is the gauge orbit space , i.e. , the configuration space of our gauge theory .",
    "let @xmath21 denote the set of orbit types of the action of @xmath14 on @xmath10 . recall that orbit types are given by conjugacy classes in @xmath14 of stabilizer , or isotropy , subgroups of connections .",

    "in @xcite it was shown that the family @xmath28 , where @xmath29 denotes the subset of @xmath19 of orbits of type @xmath25 , is a stratification of @xmath19 into smooth hilbert manifolds . for the notion of stratification ,",
