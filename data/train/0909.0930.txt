    "in the course of a search for new am cvn stars , the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) object , sdss j160043.6 + 074802.9 , was discovered to be a very rapid pulsator ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter paper  i ) .",
    "subsequent observations , reported in the same paper , shows the variability to be complex , consisting of a strong variation ( amplitude @xmath40.04  mag ) with a period of 119.33  s , its first harmonic ( 0.005  mag ; 59.66  s ) and at least another eight having periods between 62 and 118  s and amplitudes in the range 0.003 to 0.007  mag .",
    "preliminary spectroscopy in paper  i showed the star to be a hot ( sdo ) subdwarf with a cooler main - sequence companion .",
    "the object was known to be very hot from the sdss colours ( @xmath5 , @xmath6 ) and the spectrograms confirm this , showing he  ii 4686   and the pickering series lines of he  ii at 5411 , 4542 and 4200   to be clearly present in absorption .",
    "the balmer series lines h@xmath7 to h@xmath8 are also present , but these are probably blended with pickering lines of he  ii .",
    "no he  i lines ( such as the typically strong features near 4471 and 4026 ) are detected , ruling out types sdb and sdob .",
    "the relatively narrow absorption lines also seem to rule out the possibility of the object being a white dwarf star . in the red region ,",
    "the na  d lines ( 5889 and 5896 ) are present and  given the presence of he  ii lines ",
    "indicate that the object is a binary .",
    "this was confirmed by changes in radial velocities determined from two spectrograms obtained a few weeks apart , though the data were insufficient to even suggest an orbital period .",
    "the spectrum is apparently that of a classical sdo star ( see , for example , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) combined with a late - type main - sequence star .    for convenience ,",
    "we abbreviate the object name , sdss j160043.6 + 074802.9 , to j16007 + 0748 .",
    "the 2000 equatorial co - ordinates are implicit in the full sdss name ; the equivalent galactic co - ordinates are @xmath9 .",
    "the sloan digital sky survey gives photometry : @xmath10 ; for more details and background , see paper  i.    in this paper we present a spectroscopic determination of effective temperature @xmath11 , surface gravity @xmath12 and helium abundance @xmath13 using a flux calibrated sdss spectrum .",
    "we also present new and more extensive photometry for j16007 + 0748 , which recovers most , but not all frequencies found in paper  i ; we conclude that some of the pulsation modes have variable amplitudes . several uniform metallicity sdo star models , having @xmath0 and @xmath14 within the 68 per cent confidence limits derived for these quantities , were tested for non - adiabatic pulsation stability .",
    "however , pulsations are not truly driven in our models , in contrast with @xcite non - uniform metallicity sdo models , which achieve real destabilisation .",
    "in this section , we describe an analysis of a sdss spectrogram of the system taken from the sixth data release of the sloan digital sky survey @xcite .    a late - type companion ( paper  i ) with a luminosity high enough to produce observable na  i  d lines , and insufficient spectra with which to determine an orbital period , meant that the procedure of @xcite could not be used to disentangle contributions made by the two stars at each wavelength . because a flux calibrated spectrum of j16007 + 0748 had been obtained on 2006 april 28th in excellent weather , as part of the sdss survey , the @xcite technique for analysing energy distributions of composite sdb stars was developed and applied .",
    "specifically , as paper  i identifies j16007 + 0748 as a sdo and late - type main sequence binary , the @xcite method was extended to simultaneously extract all parameters of interest from the sdss energy distribution ; these are the interstellar reddening , @xmath0 , angular radii @xmath15 and radial velocities @xmath16 of both stars , as well as the @xmath14 and helium abundance @xmath13 of the sdo star .",
    "the program tlusty @xcite was used to compute a grid of model stellar atmospheres for the sdo in non - local thermodynamic equilibrium ( non - lte ) , comprising hydrogen and helium only ; this was justified only in so far as lines attributable to other elements , and originating in the sdo star spectrum , are not identified in paper  i spectra .",
    "standard model atoms for h  i , he  i and he  ii were adopted with the number of non - lte levels being 9 , 14 and 14 respectively . level populations for all non - lte levels were calculated with occupation probabilities taken into account following @xcite ; this also applies to the calculation of synthetic spectra described below .    with computed model atmospheres , non - lte synthetic spectra ( 3500 @xmath17 @xmath18 @xmath17 6800 and having hydrogen and helium lines only ) were calculated using the program synspec by hubeny & lanz ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) with revisions to he i line broadening as described by @xcite . non - lte synthetic hydrogen and helium line spectra were produced for the sdo star for the wavelength range @xmath19 .",
    "balmer line broadening was based on the @xcite static ion approximation as @xcite shows ion dynamics mainly affect line centres and are masked in stellar atmospheres .",
    "he  ii line broadening was calculated using tables by @xcite . for comparison with observation , theoretical spectra were convolved with the appropriate wavelength dependent instrumental profile ; for reasons discussed below , the projected stellar rotation velocity @xmath20 was taken to be zero .",
    "interstellar reddening was modelled following @xcite and @xcite .",
    "an initial manual comparison of observed and theoretical spectra was based on the grid @xmath21  k @xmath22 , @xmath23 @xmath24 and @xmath25 @xmath26 ; from this it became clear the sdo star had a @xmath0 near or above the upper limit of the initial grid . after some trials , the final search was based on linear interpolation in the parameter space cube having @xmath27",
    "coordinate extremes specified by ( 66000  k,4.9,0.2 ) and ( 76000  k,6.5,0.5 ) .",
    "for the late - type companion , synthetic spectra by @xcite were used , in preference to atlases derived from observed spectra , because there is then a well defined @xmath0 scale on which to base interpolation .",
    "paper  i results suggest the companion is a late f or early g - type main sequence star . accordingly",
    ", synthetic spectra for the late - type companion were generated by piecewise linear interpolation in the range @xmath28  k ; @xmath29 and solar metallicity being adopted in the first instance .",
    "again the projected stellar rotation velocity was assumed to be zero and synthetic spectra were convolved with the appropriate wavelength dependent instrumental profile .",
    "trial radial velocities between @xmath30 and @xmath31  km / s were selected for both components of the binary .",
    "the maximum flux density among all sdo star model spectra was identified , and divided by the maximum flux density in the observed energy distribution ; this ratio when multiplied by 10.0 corresponded to the maximum trial angular radius for the sdo star .",
    "a maximum trial angular radius for the late - type companion was similarly selected , except that the almost arbitrary scaling factor chosen in this case was 50.0 to reflect the smaller contribution to the observed energy distribution and the longer wavelength of the peak flux density in its energy distribution .",
    "zero was selected as the minimum trial angular radius for both stars and trial interstellar reddening values were in the range @xmath32 .",
    "because interstellar reddening may be significant , and associated interstellar ca  ii and na  i d lines present in the data , the ca  ii ( k ) line and central pixels of both na  i d lines were ignored during the fitting process .    shifting and scaling appropriately chosen theoretical spectra by correct radial velocities and squared angular radii respectively , then adding them together and adjusting for interstellar reddening ,",
    "should reproduce the observed energy distribution ; this fitting process was carried out using a revision ( version 1.2 ) of the genetic algorithm which @xcite codes as pikaia .",
    "briefly , nine unknown parameters were regarded as the `` genetic signature '' of an individual whose fitness was determined by how well the observed energy distribution was reproduced ; this was characterised by the inverse chi - squared @xmath33 .",
    "the principle of natural selection means fitter individuals are more likely to breed and produce fitter offspring .",
    "continuing evolution of a population of individuals over many generations eventually locates a global minimum @xmath34 which represents the best obtainable fit .    on the basis of constraints discussed above ,",
    "a random number generator was used to create populations of individuals .",
    "initially populations of 100 individuals , selected with 100 different random number generator seeds , would be evolved for a 100 generations ; those that evolved most rapidly would be selected for further runs , evolving them over larger numbers of generations .",
    "the global minimum was identified as the almost unique @xmath34 reached after evolving three distinct populations for 30000 generations .",
    "further tests , varying metallicity and surface gravity of the late - type companion gave less satisfactory fits .",
    "1 shows the observed sdss energy distribution and deduced contributions to it from both binary components .",
    "standard deviations were estimated following @xcite , having regard for the simultaneous estimation of nine parameters .",
    "hypersurfaces of equal @xmath34 in nine - dimensional parameter space were constructed from all trial solutions generated during an evolution of 30000 generations . for nine degrees of freedom",
    ", one standard deviation corresponds to @xmath35 .",
    "parameter values and standard deviations are presented in table  1 , where it should be noted that heliocentric corrections have not been applied to the derived radial velocities .    in fig .  2",
    ", a thin line shows the observed sdss energy distribution compared with the sum of the sdo and late - type main sequence energy distributions ( shown in fig",
    ".  1 ) plotted as a thicker line ; the `` spike '' near 5600 has been removed .",
    "note that the strong ca  ii k - line near 3933  is not fitted and h@xmath8 is predicted to be weaker than actually observed .",
    "there is clearly an interstellar contribution but also note that ca  ii ( k ) appears anomalously strong in the sdss spectrum when compared with the paper  i ( fig .",
    "6 ) spectrum .",
    ".derived parameter values and standard deviations [ cols= \" < \" , ]     some representative physical parameters of the selected models are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : phys22 ] .",
    "panels 1 and 2 display the expected behaviour of pressure and density , respectively .",
    "panel 3 shows the logarithm of the opacity : the largest opacity bump corresponds to the heavy elements partial ionisation zone , and the secondary bump at @xmath36 to the c / o partial ionisation zone .",
    "we note that for model 6 ( magenta ) the opacity is larger , although the derivative of the opacity implied in the @xmath37 mechanism driving process is qualitatively similar .",
    "panel 4 shows the nuclear energy generation rate normalised to its maximum : the deepest peak corresponds to the helium burning shell , while the shallowest is that of the hydrogen burning shell .",
    "we note that for model 6 the contribution of the helium burning is very low compared to that of the hydrogen ; and that hydrogen burning takes place deeper in the rest of the models .",
    "panel 5 shows the luminosity normalised at the surface of the star with the contributions of both burning shells ; for all the models , except model 6 , the luminosity achieves negative values at the location of the he burning shell .",
    "this is due to the increase in the helium burning rate produced by the extra - mixing of he , c , n and o in the envelope .",
    "the energy so produced diffuses inwards to the semi - degenerate material right below the burning shell , that expands and cools producing the negative luminosities .",
    "finally , panel 6 shows on one hand , the logarithm of brunt - visl frequency ( solid lines ) which shows local maxima at the zones with maximum composition gradients .",
    "the deepest and largest maximum is due to the transition between the c / o core and the he burning shell , while the secondary peak stronger for model 6 , as the transition is more abrupt ( see panel 1 in fig .",
    "[ fig : models2]) is due to the he / h transition .",
    "all the energy transport in the star is done by radiation except at the location of the heavy elements partial ionisation zone where @xmath38 , meaning that the energy transport is more efficiently done by convection .",
    "panel 6 also shows the lamb frequency ( dashed lines ) for @xmath39 modes .",
    "the models so constructed were subject to a non adiabatic stability analysis carried out with graco non adiabatic code of oscillations @xcite .",
    "modes were calculated from @xmath40 to @xmath41 in the 600 - 20000  @xmath42hz frequency range , and the normalized growth rate @xmath43 @xcite , was used as an indicator of stability . in our convention ,",
    "positive ( negative ) values of the growth rate mean the mode is unstable ( stable ) .",
    "[ fig : grates ] ( left ) shows the growth rate values of each of the selected models , all of which were found stable in the analysed frequency range .",
    "each model presents three different regions according to the behaviour of the growth rate .",
    "each of these regions can not be delimited in frequency , as they are model dependent , but it is useful to label them generally as low ( l ) , intermediate ( i ) and high frequency region ( h ) to describe their general behaviour :    * the very low frequency region ( l ) , with a slight tendency to instability , comprises more modes ( extending to higher frequencies ) and its driving is increased as the model @xmath14 increases , and it is only slightly temperature dependent . * the intermediate frequency region ( i ) is defined by growth rate values of @xmath44 , indicating its high stability .",
    "this region also shifts to higher frequencies and includes more modes as the @xmath14 of the models increases .",
    "* the high frequency region ( h ) corresponds to frequencies over the i region which have a certain tendency to instability .",
    "this region also shifts to higher frequencies and comprises a wider range in frequencies as the model @xmath14 increases . besides , when the model @xmath0 increases at constant @xmath14 , there is an overall increase in the tendency towards instability ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : grates ] , right ) .",
    "we also verified that , for models with equal metallicity , those with higher @xmath0 had somewhat higher growth rate values .",
    "the described behaviour of the l , i and h regions is also found for models within the same evolutionary sequence .",
    "besides , as expected , the frequency of the fundamental mode increases when the @xmath14 , or mean density of the model increases .",
    "therefore , the high frequency region is associated with low - radial order _ g_-modes for the models with lower @xmath14 , and shifts into the _ p_-mode region as the model @xmath14 increases .",
    "we found model 5.1 to be most favoured for instability within the range of pulsation frequencies observed for j16007 + 0748 ( roughly 8 to 16  mhz ) , this has the highest @xmath14 and opacity among our evolution sequences .",
    "we present a stability analysis carried out for model 5.1 as representative of all the other extra - mixed models .",
    "we examine the local energy exchange for modes belonging to l , i and h zones , respectively , through the derivative of the work integral , @xmath45 , whose negative ( positive ) values indicate local contribution to driving ( damping ) of the mode . fig .  [",
    "fig : modes5.1 ] shows the energy balance for representative modes _",
    "g_76 , _ g_15 and _ p_2 , with the opacity plotted in the right axis for a better understanding of the plot . mode _",
    "g_76 ( left ) is representative of the low frequency range , comprising from 0.6 to @xmath42.5  mhz , where modes achieve a certain destabilisation .",
    "this is caused by the existence of a driving region at the location of the c / o partial ionisation zone at @xmath36 .",
    "g_15 ( centre ) belongs to the intermediate frequency range , with cyclic frequencies between about 2.5 to 6  mhz , where modes are highly stable .",
    "this is explained as at these frequencies , the maximum energy interchange occurs in a damping region .",
    "p_2 ( right ) is representative of the high frequency range , from 6  mhz and above .",
    "the growth rate increases , and so the tendency to driving , due to the existence of a driving region at the location of the z - bump at @xmath46 for this model .",
    "the increase or decrease of the driving and damping regions with frequency , around the z - bump , accounts for the oscillating profile of the growth rate in this region .    by comparison , model 6 ,",
    "belonging to sequence 6 which passes through the @xmath14@xmath0 region which @xcite obtain , presents only a destabilisation for very low and very high frequencies ( in the range 20 to 50  mhz , out of the range of the plot ) , due to the c / o and heavy elements partial ionisation zones , respectively .",
    "the observed instability frequency region for j16007 + 0748 is highly stable for this model , as any significant energy dampes the modes .",
    "our pulsational study has to be compared with the discovery of the mechanism of oscillations of j16007 + 0748 by @xcite .",
    "these authors achieve real driving of modes within the instability range observed , using non - uniform metallicity models as a result of the diffusive equilibrium between radiative levitation and gravitational settling .",
    "the need for a non - uniform distribution of iron with depth to achieve an accurate description of the instability strip for sdbs had already been established by the same group @xcite , and it has now been confirmed by @xcite and @xcite to be a crucial ingredient also to achieve real driving in sdo models .",
    "all of our models have been built with uniform metallicity , and hence our inability to achieve real driving of the modes .",
    "however , from several tests carried out in our pulsation analysis we still can conclude that for sdo models within our derived spectroscopic box , those with @xmath14 values higher than 5.30 are more likely to be driven in the observed frequency range of j16007 + 0748 .",
    "besides , for models with the same @xmath14 , hotter models have a higher tendency to drive pulsations . hence , the pulsation analysis favours the higher effective temperature and higher @xmath47 estimate within our spectroscopic box . among the analysed models , model 5.1 with @xmath0=73600  k and @xmath48",
    "was found the most favoured for driving within the unstable frequency range observed for j16007 + 0748 .",
    "we have presented a spectroscopic analysis of j16007 + 0748 , a binary system containing the only pulsating sdo star known to date , and a late type companion .",
    "a flux calibrated spectrum from the sixth data release of the sdss was used for the analysis .",
    "we used tlusty @xcite to compute a grid of non - lte model stellar atmospheres for the sdo comprising h and he , which were further used with synspec ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) to compute a grid of non - lte synthetic spectra . for the late - type companion , synthetic spectra by @xcite were used , and a null projected rotational velocity was assumed for both stars .",
    "a genetic algorithm optimisation was used to estimate parameters for both binary components given in table 1 .",
    "we compared our results with atmospheric parameters derived by @xcite and find that our @xmath0 estimate is consistent , although with larger error limits ; and our @xmath14 is lower than theirs . as for the cool companion type ,",
    "the difference in spectral type estimate may arise from the fact that we have included an interstellar reddening factor , which required a redder model for the companion .    a discussion of possible evolution scenarios for the sdo component took our results into account .",
    "the derived atmospheric parameters classify j16007 + 0748 as a helium - rich sdo , although showing @xmath49 and @xmath14 values above those canonically considered for these objects ( see i.e. * ? ? ?",
    "we considered j16007 + 0748 being a post - rgb object following an evolutionary track of @xmath50 @xcite , but it is not clear how the helium enrichment would have occurred .",
    "we also considered the object to be a post - agb star following @xcite and @xcite evolutionary tracks . for most of the tracks the rapid evolution from the agb to the pre - white dwarf stage",
    "renders the observational detection unlikely .",
    "however , two born - again agb tracks from blcker , with 0.5 and 0.6@xmath51 , having longer evolutionary time , make the observational detection more likely . the possibility of the system to be physically bounded , as it seems to be implied in the derived radial velocities , is also discussed .",
    "however , uncertainties in the derived absolute magnitudes and stellar masses prevent us from a final conclusion .",
    "we presented new and more extensive photometry gathered during nineteen nights on the 1.9-m telescope at saao .",
    "the frequency analysis recovers with certainty seven out of ten frequencies established in an earlier paper .",
    "we conclude that the shorter data sets give better results , possibly due to amplitude variations that may be caused by the binary orbital motion , which needs further investigation .",
    "therefore , a spectroscopic determination of the orbital period is very desirable .",
    "finally , a pulsation analysis of uniform - metallicity sdo models within the atmospheric parameter range showed no modes were actually excited , but useful conclusions were obtained .",
    "we found models with @xmath3 5.30 were more likely to be unstable at the frequency range observed for j16007 + 0748 .",
    "besides , for models with the same @xmath14 , higher effective temperatures increase the overall driving rate . therefore , among our models ,",
    "the most favoured for instability within the observed frequency range has atmospheric parameters @xmath0 = 73600 and log @xmath2 = 5.54 .",
    "we remark that @xcite achieve actual driving of _",
    "p_-modes within the instability range of j16007 + 0748 with models including radiative levitation , which they identify as key ingredient in driving the oscillations .",
