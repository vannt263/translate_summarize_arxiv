    "the problem of distinguishing electric signals which , although look to be similar , they are emitted from systems of different dynamics , still attracts a strong interest .",
    "two characteristic cases of major practical importance are : first , seismic electric signals ( ses ) activities , which are low frequency ( @xmath01 hz ) signals of dichotomous nature that have been found in greece@xcite and japan@xcite to precede earthquakes , may look to be similar to `` artificial '' noises ( an ) , which are electrical disturbances emitted from nearby man - made sources .",
    "it has been argued@xcite that ses activities are emitted when the stress reaches a _",
    "critical _ value in the eq focal area .",
    "second , sudden cardiac death ( sd ) , which is the primary cause of mortality in the industrialized world@xcite , may occur even if the electrocardiogram ( ecg ) looks to be similar to that of truly healthy ( h ) humans .",
    "sudden cardiac arrest may also be considered as a dynamic phase transition ( critical phenomenon)@xcite .",
    "both cases have been treated in ref.@xcite , but here we only focus on the second one . the time - series will be analyzed in the natural time - domain .",
    "the natural time @xmath1 is introduced@xcite by ascribing to the @xmath2-th pulse of an electric signal consisting of @xmath3 pulses , the value @xmath4 and the analysis is made in terms of the couple @xmath5 , where @xmath6 denotes the duration of the @xmath2-th pulse .",
    "the entropy @xmath7 in the natural time - domain@xcite is defined as @xmath8 , where @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "it is _ dynamic _ entropy depending on the _ sequential _ order of pulses@xcite . here",
    "we calculate the value of @xmath7 for a number of consecutive pulses and study how it varies within the recording ( i.e. , using a time - window of certain length @xmath12 sliding , each time by one pulse , through the whole time - series ) .",
    "thus , for a window of length @xmath12 , when starting from the @xmath13-th pulse , we have @xmath14 where @xmath15 , @xmath16 with @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "this variation is quantified by the standard deviation @xmath19 ( @xmath20 ) of @xmath21 .",
    "the value of @xmath19 may change to a different value @xmath22 when repeating the same calculation but after _ shuffling _ the @xmath6 randomly .",
    "in ref.@xcite we showed that a distinction between sd and h can be achieved when calculating both @xmath22 and @xmath19 at the _ same _ ( time - window ) length @xmath12 and then studying their ratio @xmath23(which is labeled by @xmath24 ) . here",
    "we show that a similar distinction may be alternatively achieved if we introduce _ appropriate _ measures that quantify the @xmath19-variability upon _ changing _ the time - window length and , interestingly , their values approach the value of the markovian case in sd , who exhibit critical dynamics .",
    "furthermore , we show that the measures suggested in this paper exhibit a certain type of complementarity when compared to those discussed in @xcite .",

    "( cf . in fig .",
    "[ fig1](b ) we show , for example , how the qt interval time - series can be read in natural time ) .",
    "the rr- ( beat - to - beat ) and qrs - intervals ( cf .",
    "mainly the rr ) can be automatically detected@xcite ( which was followed here ) more easily than the qt- . in spite of this fact",
    ", we intentionally study here all these three types of intervals for the following reasons : it has been clinically observed that the qt interval usually exhibits prolonged values before cardiac death ( see ref.@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "interestingly , this clinical observation was found@xcite to be consistent with the fact that in all sd the @xmath19- ( and @xmath22- ) values themselves of the qt - intervals exceed those of h , see fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ( cf .",
    "the latter distinction between sd and h can not be attributed to the allocation error of the qt interval , see section viii of ref.@xcite ) . since the latter systematic behavior is not found when studying the rr- or the qrs- intervals@xcite , it is interesting to investigate here whether a systematicity occurs when employing the complexity measures suggested in this paper . actually , we find that the latter measures seem to enable the distinction between sd and h when using the rr- and qrs- intervals of the original time - series .",
    "furthermore , and most interestingly , we pinpoint that , even when solely using the most easily accessible values of the rr - intervals , such a distinction seems to be possible if we apply these measures to both the original time - series and the one obtained after shuffling the @xmath6 randomly .",
    "we use here the qt database from physiobank@xcite , which includes fifteen minutes recordings of 10 h and 24 sd ( as well as recordings from four groups of heart disease patients , see below ) .",
    "examples of the @xmath19-values , calculated for the rr- , qrs- and qt - intervals in the range 3 to 100 beats are plotted in figs . [",
    "fig3](a ) and ( b ) for one h and one sd , respectively . as for the symbols",
    ", we use the same convention as in ref.@xcite , i.e. , @xmath19 is used only when the calculation is made by a single time - window ( e.g. , 5 pulses ) , while the symbol @xmath27 stands for the average of the @xmath19-values calculated for a sequence of single windows ( e.g. , 3 , 4 pulses ) .",
    "finally , @xmath28 denotes the @xmath19-values averaged over a group of individuals , e.g. , 10 healthy subjects .    before proceeding , however , it might be useful to recapitulate the main differences of our procedure compared to several other earlier attempts by other groups .",
    "the reasons why the concept of entropy should be preferred ( compared to other quantities ) as discriminating statistics in physiological time - series have been explained in detail in ref.@xcite .",
    "furthermore , the advantages of using complexity measures based on _ dynamic _ entropy ( and not on _ static _ entropy , e.g. , shannon entropy ) , as for example the kolmogorov - sinai entropy ( k - s entropy ) , have been clarified@xcite .",
    "earlier attempts in the ecg analysis have actually used measures related to dynamic entropy . for example , the so called approximate entropy ( ae)@xcite or sample entropy ( se)@xcite have been introduced and later used by other authors ( e.g. , see ref .",
    "@xcite where ae is applied beyond other measures ; see also ref.@xcite ) .",
    "also , costa et al.@xcite introduced the multiscale entropy ( mse ) approach , the algorithm of which is based on ae or se , calculating the entropy at different scales . as for the @xmath7 , which is also a dynamic entropy , as already mentioned , differs essentially from the other ones , because it is defined@xcite in an entirely different time - domain ( see fig.[fig1](b ) ) .",
    "moreover , the following has been found : when studying the @xmath7-values themselves , most ses activities can be clearly distinguished@xcite from the majority of an , because they have s - values smaller and larger , respectively , than the value @xmath29 of the `` uniform '' distribution ( as the latter was defined in refs.@xcite ) ; on the other hand , when dealing with ecg they all have @xmath7-values comparable , more or less , to @xmath30 @xcite , see also @xcite , thus not allowing a clear distinction among their principal categories ( cf . the entropy values themselves have been used in earlier attempts ) .",
    "this is achieved , however , when we quantify the @xmath7 _ fluctuations_@xcite and use ratios of `` shuffled '' and `` unshuffled '' @xmath7 fluctuations on fixed time scales@xcite or ratios on different time scales that will be introduced here in section ii .",
    "thus , in order to discriminate similar looking electric signals emitted from systems of different dynamics , the following seems to hold : signals that have @xmath7-values more or less comparable to @xmath30 ( which is the case of all ecg ) can be better classified by the complexity measures relevant to the fluctuations @xmath19 of the entropy ; if the @xmath7-values _ markedly _ differ from @xmath30 ( which is usually -but _ not _ always- the case of ses and an ) , the classification of these signals should be preferably made by the use of the @xmath7-values themselves .",
    "in classical thermodynamics , the systems are studied close to equilibrium and the relevant quantities have a clear physical meaning . in non - equilibrium systems , however , the meaning of entropy and its treatment should be handled with great caution ( e.g. , @xcite ) , because there is at present ( e.g. , see ref .",
    "@xcite ) no unified statistical mechanical theory underlying these systems .",
    "( cf . in transformations between non - equilibrium stationary states , entropy might be a not well defined concept@xcite ; the connection of the entropy to microscopic dynamics is still a matter of intensive research ( e.g.,@xcite and references therein ) ) . in complex systems operating far from equilibrium ( like the case of heart dynamics@xcite ) , long - range correlations play an important role ( cf . such correlations are , of course , of prominent importance in equilibrium systems as well , when approaching a critical point , e.g. , the `` critical '' temperature @xmath31 , i.e. , @xmath32 ) .",
    "thus , in the latter systems _ both _ correlations ( i.e. , short- and long - range ) , in general , is advisable to be studied carefully and hence appropriate complexity measures should be envisaged .",
    "this is , in simple words , the physics underlying the present paper and stimulated the procedure followed .",
    "along these lines , we introduce the ratios @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 for the rr- , qrs- and qt - intervals , respectively , where @xmath36 denote the time - window length used in the calculation of @xmath19 . assuming that @xmath37 , these three ratios provide measures of the @xmath19- variability when a scale @xmath38 changes to a scale @xmath39 .",
    "we select as a common scale ( for all rr- , qrs- and qt- ) the _ smallest _ @xmath39-value allowed for the natural time - domain analysis , i.e. , @xmath40 beats , and for the short range ( s ) @xmath41 , while for the longer ( l ) @xmath42 beats .",
    "thus , the following ratios are studied : @xmath43 and @xmath44 , where @xmath45 denotes the type of interval , i.e. , @xmath46rr , qrs or qt . we also define the ratios @xmath47 , which provide a _ relative _ measure of the @xmath19-values of the rr - intervals compared to either qrs- or qt- ( for the _ same _ number of beats @xmath38 ) . here",
    ", we will use for the short range @xmath48 and for the long range @xmath49 .",

    "the minima @xmath54 $ ] and maxima @xmath55 $ ] among the healthy individuals for the rr ( @xmath46rr ) and qrs ( @xmath46qrs ) intervals are also inserted in this table .",

    "furthermore , attention is drawn to the point that if we also consider the @xmath73 values calculated ( _ not _ in the original , but ) in the randomized ( `` shuffled '' ) sequence of @xmath6 , we find that _ all _ sd violate one or more _ h - limits _ of @xmath74 and @xmath75 ( see table vii of ref.@xcite ) .",
    "this allows ( cf . using again four parameters in total ) the distinction of sd from h by using the rr - intervals _",
    "only_.    thus , we found that among the 10 parameters defined in the original time - series extracted from each ecg ( or 20 parameters , in total , if we also account for the corresponding parameters defined in the series obtained after shuffling the @xmath6 randomly ) , _ only _ four are required for the distinction between sd and h. we clarify that this seems to be extremely difficult to be achieved by chance .",
    "in order to visualize it , if we assume ( for the sake of convenience only ) independent and identically distributed ( iid ) distributions of the parameters for one subject , we find that the probability that _ all _ 4 parameters are within the bounds ( minima and maxima ) set by 10 other subjects ( i.e. , the healthy ones ) is @xmath76 . thus , the probability that all 24 additional subjects are classified as sd by pure chance is @xmath77 , i.e. , extremely small . concerning the validity of this statistical argument",
    ", we clarify that it does not remain valid if one just picks 4 parameters out of the original 20 ones .",
    "only if one decides which parameters wants to use _ before _ the calculation of the values , the argument is valid(this is the reason why blind evaluation- defining all methods , parameters and criteria studying one set of data , and _ then _ testing the significance using an additonal set of independent data- is considered very important in medical applications and/or publications ) .",
    "we now attempt a physical interpretation of the present results , the main feature of which focuses on the fact that both ratios @xmath68 and @xmath69 become smaller , in the vast majority of sd , compared to h. recall that the @xmath78-values themselves can not distinguish sd from h , see fig .",
    "[ fig4](a ) , in contrast to the ratios @xmath79 , see fig . [ fig4](b ) . before proceeding ,",
    "we mention two points : first , for individuals at high risk of sudden death , fractal organization ( long range correlations ) breaks down ( see refs.@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the breakdown of fractal physiologic complexity is often accompanied by emergence of _ uncorrelated randomness _ or _ excessive _ order ( e.g. , periodic oscillations appear in the heart rate recordings of `` frequency''@xmath801/min , which are associated with cheyne - stokes breathing ) @xcite .",
    "second , if we calculate@xcite the @xmath19-values in a ( dichotomous ) markovian ( @xmath81 ) time - series ( exponentially distributed pulses ) , for a total number of n=@xmath82 pulses ( i.e. , length comparable to that of the ecg analyzed here ) , we find that these values : ( a ) lead to @xmath83 and ( b ) differ drastically , see fig . [ fig4](a ) , from the @xmath78-values themselves of _ both _ sd and h ( thus indicating that they exhibit non - markovian behavior on the whole ; this is consistent with the aspects that bodily rhythms , such as the heart beat , show complex dynamics , e.g. , @xcite ) . the fact that @xmath68 in sd becomes smaller than in h can now be understood as follows : since h exhibit a high order of complexity , it is expected that ( even ) their @xmath59-value ( = 1.43 ) , should markedly exceed @xmath84 . on the other hand , in sd this high complexity",
    "is lost , and hence their @xmath68 values naturally approach @xmath84 , thus becoming smaller .",
    "interestingly , the sd average value of @xmath68 in table [ tab1 ] is 1.19 , i.e. , coincides with @xmath84 .",
    "( such a coincidence also occurs for the qrs - intervals in _ both _ h and sd , which agrees with the observations@xcite mentioned above that the prolonged qt - intervals in sd mainly originate from enlarged st - values , while their qrs- may remain the _",
    "same_. ) we now proceed to the interpretation of our results related to the ratio @xmath69 . in h",
    ", it is expected that ( in view of the rr long range correlations@xcite ) the corresponding values must be appreciably larger than @xmath85 , calculated in the markovian case ( fig .",
    "[ fig4](b ) ) .",
    "we now examine the sd : if , in sd `` _ uncorrelated randomness _ ''",
    "appears , this reflects that their @xmath69 values naturally approach @xmath86 , thus becoming smaller ( compared to h ) ; this actually occurs in the vast majority of sd in table [ tab1 ] . _",
    "if _ in sd the aforementioned periodicities appear , it is naturally expected to find _ large _ ( see ref.@xcite ) @xmath87-values when a time - window of length around 60 beats , or so ( i.e. , related to the aforementioned `` frequency''@xmath801/min ) sweeps through the rr time - series , thus resulting in @xmath87-values even larger than those in h ( since in h _ no _ such periodicities appear ) .",
    "the latter actually occurs in the few cases marked with superscript ` b ' ( i.e. , those exceeding @xmath60 ) in table [ tab1 ] ( for additional arguments on the interpretation see @xcite ) .",
    "the fact that the overall behavior of the complexity measures introduced in this paper ( i.e. , clear distinction of sd from h ) is more or less similar to that of the measures discussed in ref.@xcite does not mean that the former measures are similar to the latter , because , as we shall explain below they exhibit a certain type of complementarity in the following sense : if in the frame of the one procedure an ambiguity emerges in the distinction between sd and h , the other procedure gives a clear answer .",
    "( recall that , as mentioned in section i , in ref.@xcite we discussed entropy fluctuations -and ratios of `` shuffled '' and `` unshuffled '' entropy fluctuations- on fixed time scales , while here we study entropy fluctuations on different time scales . )",
    "this is consistent with the findings of ashkenazy et al.@xcite that an approach dealing with ratios on the same time scale and an approach dealing with ratios on different time scales ( or corresponding scaling exponents ) are somewhat complementary .",
    "we now study , as an example , the following two procedures : i.e. , the one that uses @xmath19(qt)@xcite and the other which combines the measures @xmath88,@xmath58 .",
    "the -values of sd and h given in the last column of table [ tab1 ] are classified into two classes : the larger values correspond to sd , and the lower ones correspond to h ( see also figs .",
    "[ fig2 ] and [ fig5 ] ) .",
    "let us focus on the two lowermost sd values and the uppermost h value .",
    "the former two correspond to sel33 and sel34 @xmath89(qt)=0.00076 and 0.00069 , respectively ) and the latter one to sel16795 ( @xmath89(qt)=0.00056 ) . in view of their @xmath89(qt)-values proximity , one may wonder whether these two sd could be confused with h. this ambiguity can be dissolved in the light of the other procedure ( i.e. , @xmath88 , @xmath58 ) , as follows : table i reveals that sel33 markedly violates both the @xmath59-limit for @xmath90(qrs ) as well as @xmath59 for @xmath90(rr ) ( the latter can be visualized in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] ) . as for sel34 , the @xmath60-limit of @xmath91(qrs )",
    "is strongly violated .",
    "we now turn to an alternative example , i.e. , sel47 , who , by means of the method using the complexity measures @xmath88 , @xmath58 ( of the rr- and qrs - intervals ) , could be confused with h , because a deviation of only around 12% from the @xmath59-limit of @xmath92=0.18 $ ] is noticed .",
    "this ambiguity can be dissolved by means of the procedure using @xmath19(qt ) as follows : sel47 has @xmath89(qt)=0.0029 , which exceeds significantly , i.e. , by a factor 5 , the corresponding value of sel16795 , who has the largest @xmath89(qt)=0.00056 value among the h.",
    "this section aims at distinguishing sd from patients , where the latter terminology refers to individuals suffering only from heart diseases .",
    "the qt - database of physiobank we use here , includes the following four groups of patients ( a fifth group that consists of 4 individuals only , was disregarded for the reasons discussed in ref.@xcite ) : 15 individuals from mit - bih arrhythmia database ( labeled hereafter mit ) , 13 from mit - bih supraventricular arrhythmia database ( msv ) , 33 from the european st - t database ( est ) and 6 from mit - bih st change database ( mst ) .",
    "the values of @xmath88 , @xmath58 , @xmath24,@xmath89(qt ) , @xmath93 , @xmath94 and @xmath95(qt ) of all these patients are given in ref.@xcite .",
    "an inspection of the measures @xmath88 , @xmath58 , @xmath24 shows three facts : first , all sd and all patients violate one or more @xmath96-limits .",
    "second , _ none _ of the measures @xmath88 , @xmath58 , @xmath24 alone , or a combination of two of them , can effectively differentiate the sd from the patients .",
    "third , if we consider the three measures @xmath88 , @xmath58 , @xmath24 ( i.e. , 16 parameters ) altogether , we find that twenty sd out of 24 violate some of the limits of both patients and h , thus allowing in principle a distinction of the vast majority of sd from the other individuals .",
    "thus , in summary , the consideration of the quantities ( @xmath88 , @xmath58 , @xmath24 ) only , does not lead to a distinction between _ all _ sd and patients . the same conclusion is drawn if we alternatively consider the quantities ( @xmath88 , @xmath93,@xmath58 ) only .",
    "we now turn to the investigation of the @xmath19(qt ) values . in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] , the average @xmath97(qt ) value for each group is plotted versus the time - window length . it is intriguing that the results of the four groups ( mit , msv , mst , est ) of patients are located between h ( the lowermost curve ) and sd ( the uppermost curve ) .",
    "we emphasize , however , that if we plot the curves for each one of the 101 individuals ( in a way similar to that of fig.[fig2](a ) ) , we find that there are some patients the results of which overlap with either sd or h. let us consider only the limiting cases -i.e .",
    ", the lowermost and the uppermost curve , to be called hereafter @xmath19(qt)@xmath98 and @xmath19(qt)@xmath99 , respectively- obtained in each groups of patients . in order to distinguish sd from patients",
    ", we must appropriately discriminate the overlap which refers to those of the patients that lie above the uppermost @xmath19(qt ) curve of h ; the latter curve from now on will be called @xmath19(qt)@xmath100 .",
    "thus , the limits of the patients we are currently interested in , do not extend from @xmath19(qt)@xmath98 to @xmath19(qt)@xmath99 , since they must exceed @xmath19(qt)@xmath100 , i.e. , @xmath101 the curve which corresponds to the one of the patients , that has @xmath19(qt ) lying just above the @xmath102 corresponds to a value , which will be labeled hereafter @xmath19(qt)@xmath103 .",
    "thus , if we apply the condition @xmath104 to each group of patients , we are left only with those of the patients that actually overlap with sd .",
    "we now recall that , as mentioned above , the measures @xmath88 , @xmath58 , @xmath24 altogether , which are in fact ratios of @xmath19 values , enable the discrimination of the vast majority of sd from all the others ( i.e. , patients and h ) , while the @xmath19(qt ) values themselves efficiently distinguish@xcite all sd from h. this motivates us to investigate whether a proper combination of these two facts can serve our purpose , which refers to the identification of all sd among the other individuals ( patients and h ) .",
    "thus , we now compare the quantities @xmath88 , @xmath58 , @xmath24 , @xmath19(qt ) altogether , of each sd , to the corresponding parameters of only those among the patients that happen to have @xmath19(qt ) values exceeding the corresponding values of h , i.e. , obey the condition ( [ con1 ] ) , or preferably the more accurate condition ( [ con2 ] ) .",
    "such a comparison reveals that some of the 17 parameters of @xmath88 , @xmath58 , @xmath24 , @xmath19(qt ) , in all sd , lie outside the limits of these patients ( cf . the same happens , of course , if we compare each sd to the limits of h ) .",
    "these results point to the conclusion that all 24 sd are distinguished from the patients ( and h ) .",
    "the same conclusion is drawn if we consider instead , the 17 parameters @xmath88 , @xmath93 , @xmath58 , @xmath19(qt ) .",
    "we emphasize , however , that the study of the estimation errors ( see the appendix ) reveals that the confidence level for the distinction of all sd from the patients becomes appreciably larger if we combine all the measures @xmath88 , @xmath93 , @xmath58 @xmath94 , @xmath24 ( of all intervals ) with the condition ( [ con2 ] ) applied to both @xmath19(qt ) and @xmath22(qt ) ( i.e. , in reality , we then consider the limits of those patients whom _ both _ @xmath19(qt)- and @xmath22(qt)-values are larger than those in h , as shown in fig",
    ". 6 of ref.@xcite ) .",
    "we finally comment on three points .",
    "first , once the identification of sd has been completed , the distinction between patients and h can be made by identifying as patients the individuals whom one or more of the aforementioned parameters violate the @xmath96-limits .",
    "second , since it is known that heart rate variability depends strongly on the age , it is highly recommended that when comparing values of the aforementioned complexity measures , the corresponding limits should be taken from subjects ( patients , h ) of comparable age .",
    "third , we now focus on the importance of the sequential order of @xmath6 on the aforementioned complexity measures .",
    "we prefer to deal with the results related to the rr - intervals since it is known that the healthy heart beats irregularly and that the intervals between beats ( i.e. , the rr - intervals ) fluctuate widely , following complicated patterns@xcite .",
    "let us investigate , for example , the possibility of using @xmath105(rr ) alone to distinguish the sd as well as the four groups of patients from h , i.e. , examine whether the @xmath105(rr)-values of each individual violate one ( at least ) of the relevant @xmath96-limits .",
    "the results show ( see table [ tab2 ] ) that the vast majority of sd and of each group of patients is well distinguished from h by means of @xmath105(rr ) .",
    "the situation drastically changes , however , if we use , instead of @xmath105(rr ) , the @xmath106-values ( see the tables v to vii in @xcite ) : only the minority of sd and of each group of patients can be differentiated from h. since the calculation of the @xmath105(rr)-values takes into account the sequential order of @xmath6 , while the @xmath106(rr)-values do not , this points to the following conclusion : it is the sequential order of beats that inherently contains the primary information which enables the distinction between the sd and patients , on the one hand , and the h , on the other .",
    "this might explain why procedures based on the entropy in natural time ( which is dynamic entropy , affected by the sequential order@xcite , see section i ) -and hence they consider the complexity measures mentioned in the preceding sections- can achieve such a distinction , while a static entropy ( e.g. , shannon entropy , see ref .",
    "@xcite ) can not .",
    "first , in sd , the @xmath19-values depend on the length scale in a way significantly different from that in h. hence these two groups of humans can be well distinguished .",
    "second , the sd , who exhibit critical dynamics , have @xmath88-values ( being , in fact , ratios of @xmath19-values , as mentioned above ) which approach those of the markovian case .",
    "this should _ not _ be misinterpreted as showing that the corresponding time - series are of markovian nature , because the @xmath19-values themselves are approximately one order of magnitude smaller than those of the ( dichotomous ) markovian time - series ( see fig .",
    "4(a ) and ref .",
    "third , the quantities @xmath88 , @xmath93 , @xmath58 , @xmath94 , @xmath24 , @xmath19(qt ) and @xmath22(qt ) _ altogether _ , seem to enable the classification of individuals into the three categories : h , patients and sd .",
    "beyond the error introduced by the use of an automatic threshold detector for the allocation of the corresponding intervals ( cf .",
    "this is largest for the qt- and smallest for the rr - intervals ) , the following two sources of errors must be considered@xcite : first , an estimation error emerges when analyzing -instead of the original time series of length @xmath107- smaller lengths @xmath108 , which , however , still significantly exceed the time - window lengths used , for example @xmath109 ( the errors associated with the measures in the short range,@xmath110 , are smaller from those corresponding to the longer range , @xmath111 , because for the latter range the @xmath112 values -due to the restricted length of the records available- are small , thus not allowing more reliable statistics ) .",
    "second , a source of ( statistical ) error in the results emerges when considering the ratio(s ) @xmath113/@xmath19 ( i.e. , when dealing with @xmath24 and @xmath93 ) instead of @xmath19 itself . while @xmath19 may be considered to have a",
    "value for a ( given ) original @xmath6 time - series , the value of @xmath22 depends on the randomly shuffled @xmath6 series each time selected ( cf .",
    "such differences are well known@xcite when dealing with randomized series of _ finite _ length ) .",
    "this is why the @xmath24-values given in ref.@xcite for sd and h do not fully coincide with those tabulated in the present paper . to account",
    "roughly for the extent of this statistical error , we averaged here the @xmath22-values calculated over a number ( e.g. 20 ) of randomly shuffled @xmath6-series generated from the _ same _ original series and then the corresponding standard deviation was estimated .",
    "the final results on the above sources , could be summarized as follows : the ( percentage ) estimation error was found to be around 10% ( cf .",
    "this is an _ average _ value ) for the complexity measures @xmath88,@xmath93 , @xmath58 , @xmath94 , @xmath24 associated with the rr- and qrs - intervals .",
    "furthermore , since the error in the @xmath19(qt ) may reach 20% , the estimation error in those of the complexity measures that involve @xmath19(qt ) may be as high as @xmath80 30% .",
    "upon considering such error - levels , hereafter called `` plausible estimation errors '' @xmath114 , a study of each of the methods for the distinction of sd was made .",
    "the study was repeated by assuming larger ( percentage ) estimation errors , hereafter labeled `` modified estimation errors''@xmath115 , calculated from @xmath116 for each parameter ( see table viii in ref .",
    "@xcite ) . both studies led , more or less , to the same results .",
    "the calculation , in each study , was made as follows : each parameter was assumed to be equal to its value ( initially estimated from the original time - series available ) multiplied by a number randomly selected in the range @xmath117 or @xmath118 , respectively ) and then each of the methods for the distinction of sd was applied .",
    "this application was repeated , for each method , @xmath82 times via monte carlo and relevant conclusions have been drawn for both studies . the extent to which these conclusions hold , was also investigated in the following _ extreme _ case : the limits of the parameters of h ( and patients ) , which are automatically adjusted for each `` random '' selection of the values described above , have been assumed to _ additionally _ relax by ( extra ) amounts equal to @xmath114 or @xmath115 .",
    "( such a `` relaxation '' faces the _ extreme _ possibility that the populations of h and patients treated here are not considered large enough to allow a precise determination of their limits , and hence future increased populations studies could somehow broaden these limits by _",
    "extra _ amounts as large as @xmath114 or @xmath115 ) .",
    "the following conclusions were finally drawn concerning the distinction between sd and h ( see also table [ aca7 ] ) : among the four methods suggested ( i.e. , two in ref.@xcite and two in section ii ) , the one that uses the measures @xmath88 , @xmath58 ( associated , however , with _ all _ three types of intervals , i.e. , 10 parameters in total ) seems to be robust in the following sense : when assuming the error - levels mentioned above , the use of @xmath88 , @xmath58 still allow with a confidence level above 99% the distinction of _ all _ sd from h. ( then a calculation similar to that given in section ii concerning the probability that all 24 subjects are classified , by means of 10 parameters , as sd by _ pure chance _ -based on the limits set by 10 other subjects- results in @xmath119^{24}\\approx 0.03 $ ] , i.e. , too small . ) the confidence level decreases to 63% , 49% , 32% and 59% , respectively , when using four parameters or one parameter only as follows : first : @xmath105(rr ) and @xmath120(qrs ) ; second : @xmath105(rr ) and @xmath121(rr ) ; third : @xmath122(rr ) and @xmath122(qrs ) ; fourth : @xmath89(qt ) .",
    "if we investigate the aforementioned extreme case of the additional `` relaxation '' of the _ h - limits _ , the capability for the distinction of _ all _ sd still remains with the following results : in the case of using @xmath88 , @xmath58 ( of all intervals ) , the confidence level in distinguishing _ all _ sd is 88% , while it becomes _ appreciably higher _ , i.e. , larger than 99% , if we use the quantities @xmath88 , @xmath58 , @xmath93 , @xmath94 , @xmath24 , @xmath123 , @xmath124 _ altogether_. when using , however , four parameters only in the first three combinations mentioned above , the confidence level decreases to 90% , 36% and 8% , respectively ( and to 77% when using @xmath89(qt ) ) , even when allowing two at the most sd -out of 24- to be misinterpreted as being h. as for the corresponding conclusions related to the distinction of sd from the patients , these can be drawn on the basis of the values given in the lower part of table [ aca7 ] .    in summary",
    ", the study of the estimation errors reveals that ( _ if _ the limits of the parameters will _ not _ be broadened by future investigations ) we can satisfactorily distinguish the _ totality _ of sd from h as well as discriminate the totality of sd from patients , upon employing the quantities @xmath88 , @xmath93 , @xmath58 , @xmath94 , @xmath24,@xmath125(qt ) , @xmath126(qt ) _ altogether _ , i.e. , the sixth and the last method , respectively in table [ aca7 ] .",
    "these quantities also allow the distinction of the _ totality _ of sd from h ( as well as distinguishes the _ vast majority _ of sd from the patients ) , _ even if _ their limits will be eventually broadened ( by @xmath115 )",
    ".    the following remark should be added concerning the number of parameters required to achieve the desired distinction : in reality , only twelve _ independent _ quantities , ( i.e. , the six : @xmath127 and the six @xmath128 , where @xmath51=s , l and @xmath45=rr , qrs , qt ) are extracted from the experimental data .",
    "thus , for example , beyond @xmath123 _ or _",
    "@xmath129 , eleven additional parameters ( out of 26 ) of the ratios : @xmath88 , @xmath93 , @xmath58 , @xmath94 , @xmath24 , are in principle required to be used for the distinction .",
    "these twelve quantities , however , should _ not _ be fortuitously selected , but the following points must be carefully considered : ( i ) priority should be given to the eight parameters associated with @xmath88-values and @xmath93- ( or @xmath24- ) values of rr and qrs , ( ii ) using , at least , one @xmath58-parameter ( involving @xmath123 or @xmath129 ) , and ( iii ) examining whether the totality of the parameters used can actually reproduce the aforementioned twelve @xmath19-values determined directly from the data . however , in order to avoid the difficulty arising from the completeness ( or not ) of the aforementioned selection , at the present stage ( i.e. , until an appreciably larger number of h and patients will be analyzed to allow a better precision in the determination of the corresponding limits ) , the preceding paragraph recommends to use -instead of twelve- _ all _ the 28 parameters associated with the quantities @xmath88 , @xmath93 , @xmath58 , @xmath94 , @xmath24 , @xmath123 and @xmath124 .                                                                    &",
