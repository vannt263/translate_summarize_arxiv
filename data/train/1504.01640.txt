    "the rapid structural changes occurring in the ground state and low - lying collective excited states of neutron - rich nuclei in the mass region @xmath2 have been extensively studied both theoretical and experimentally ( see e.g. @xcite and references therein ) . from the theoretical side , the equilibrium nuclear shapes in this mass region have been shown to suffer rapid changes as a function of the number of nucleons with competing spherical , axially symmetric prolate and oblate , and triaxial shapes at close energies .",
    "both relativistic @xcite and nonrelativistic @xcite approaches agree in the general description of the nuclear structural evolution in this mass region , which is supported experimentally by spectroscopic studies @xcite , @xmath3 lifetime measurements @xcite and quadrupole moments for rotational bands @xcite , as well as by laser spectroscopy measurements @xcite .    however , the nuclear structure richness is not the only attractive feature characterizing these nuclei .",
    "another remarkable property of nuclei in this mass region is that they are involved in the astrophysical rapid neutron capture process ( _ r _ process ) , which is considered to be one of the main nucleosynthesis mechanisms leading to the production of heavy neutron - rich nuclei in the universe @xcite .",
    "r_-process nucleosynthesis involves many neutron - rich unstable isotopes , whose neutron capture rates , masses , and @xmath0-decay half - lives ( @xmath4 ) are crucial quantities to understand the possible _",
    "r_-process paths , the isotopic abundances , and the time scales of the process @xcite .",
    "although much progress has been done measuring masses ( see for example the jyvskyl mass database @xcite ) and half - lives @xcite , most of the nuclear properties of relevance for the _ r _ process are experimentally unknown due to their extremely low production yields in the laboratory .",
    "therefore , reliable nuclear physics models are required to simulate properly the _ r _ process .    the quasiparticle random - phase approximation ( qrpa ) is considered a well suited model to describe medium - mass open - shell nuclear properties and specifically @xmath0-decay properties .",
    "qrpa calculations for neutron - rich nuclei have been carried out within different spherical formalisms , such as hartree - fock - bogoliubov ( hfb ) @xcite , continuum qrpa with density functionals @xcite , and relativistic mean field approaches @xcite .",
    "however , the mass region we are dealing with requires nuclear deformation as a relevant degree of freedom to characterize the nuclear structure involved in the calculation of the @xmath0-strength functions .",
    "the deformed qrpa formalism was developed in refs .",
    "@xcite , using phenomenological mean fields . a tamm - dancoff approximation with sk3 interaction",
    "was also implemented in ref . @xcite .",
    "more recently , deformed qrpa calculations using deformed woods - saxon potentials and realistic cd - bonn residual forces have been performed in @xcite .",
    "first - forbidden transitions were also considered in those references , showing that their effect in this mass region can be neglected .",
    "various self - consistent deformed qrpa calculations to describe the @xmath0-decay properties , either with skyrme @xcite or gogny @xcite interactions are also available in the literature .    in refs .",
    "@xcite the decay properties of neutron - rich zr and mo isotopes were studied within a deformed proton - neutron qrpa based on a self - consistent hartree - fock ( hf ) mean field formalism with skyrme interactions and pairing correlations in bcs approximation .",
    "residual spin - isospin interactions were also included in the particle - hole and particle - particle channels @xcite . in this work this study is extended to the neighboring regions including even and odd-@xmath1 neutron - rich ge , se , kr , sr , ru , and pd isotopes .",
    "these calculations are timely because they address a mass region which is at the borderline of present experimental capabilities for measuring half - lives at msu and riken @xcite .",
    "in addition , theoretical calculations can be tested with the available experimental information on half - lives providing simultaneously predictions for the underlying gamow - teller strength distributions and for the half - lives of more exotic nuclei not yet measured .",
    "finally , this more comprehensive study allows one to judge better the extent to which the method is able to describe the decay properties of nuclei in a wider mass region that includes spherical , well deformed , and weakly deformed transitional isotopes , as well as isotopes exhibiting shape coexistence .",
    "therefore , the theoretical method will be tested over a rich set of different nuclear structures that will reveal the limitations of the model .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec2 ] a review of the theoretical formalism used is introduced .",
    "section [ results ] contains the results obtained for the potential energy curves ( pec ) , gamow - teller ( gt ) strength distributions , and @xmath0-decay half - lives , which are compared with the experimental data .",
    "section iv summarizes the main conclusions .",
    "a summary of the theoretical framework used in this paper to describe the @xmath0-decay properties in neutron - rich isotopes is shown in this section .",
    "more details of the formalism can be found elsewhere @xcite .",
    "the method starts from a self - consistent calculation of the mean field by means of a deformed skyrme hartree - fock procedure with pairing correlations in bcs approximation .",
    "single - particle energies , wave functions , and occupation amplitudes are generated from this mean field .",
    "the skyrme interaction sly4 @xcite is used as a representative of modern skyrme forces .",
    "it has been very successful describing nuclear properties all along the nuclear chart and has been extensively studied @xcite .",
    "the solution of the hf equation , assuming time reversal and axial symmetry , is found by using the formalism developed in ref .",
    "the single - particle wave functions are expanded in terms of the eigenstates of an axially symmetric harmonic oscillator in cylindrical coordinates , using twelve major shells .",
    "the pairing gap parameters for protons and neutrons in the bcs approximation are determined phenomenologically from the odd - even mass differences @xcite . in a further step , constrained hf calculations with a quadratic constraint are performed to construct the pecs , analyzing the nuclear binding energies in terms of the quadrupole deformation parameter @xmath0 .",
    "calculations for gt strengths are performed subsequently for the various minima in the energy curves indicating the equilibrium shapes of each nucleus .",
    "since decays connecting different shapes are disfavored , similar shapes are assumed for the ground state of the parent nucleus and for all populated states in the daughter nucleus .",
    "the validity of this assumption was discussed for example in refs .",
    "@xcite .    to describe gt transitions , a separable spin - isospin residual interaction in the particle - hole ( ph ) and particle - particle ( pp ) channels",
    "is added to the mean field and treated in a deformed proton - neutron qrpa @xcite .",
    "an optimum set of coupling strengths could be chosen following a case by case fitting procedure and one will finally get different answers depending on the nucleus , shape , and skyrme force . however , since the purpose here is to test the ability of qrpa to account for the gt strength distributions in this mass region with as few free parameters as possible , the same coupling strengths are used for all the nuclei considered in this paper , which are taken from previous works @xcite .",
    "we use @xmath5 mev and @xmath6 mev for the residual interaction in the ph and pp channels , respectively .",
    "the sensitivity of the gt strength distributions to the various ingredients contributing to the deformed qrpa calculations , namely to the nucleon - nucleon effective force , to deformation , to pairing correlations , and to residual interactions , have been investigated in the past @xcite . in this work",
    "the most reasonable choices found in those references are used . summarizing the various sensitivities ,",
    "the conclusion is that the main features of the gt strength distributions are in general very robust against the skyrme force used , showing some more sensitivity in the spherical cases , where the location of the single - particle energies is more critical to determine the excitation energies of the gt transitions .",
    "deformation has been shown to be an important issue to describe the profiles of the gt strength distributions .",
    "first , because the degeneracy of the spherical shells is broken making the gt strength distributions more fragmented than the corresponding spherical ones . secondly , because the energy levels of deformed orbitals cross each other in a way that depends on the magnitude of the quadrupole deformation as well as on the oblate or prolate character . this level crossing may lead in some instances to sizable differences in the gt profiles , a fact that has been exploited to learn about the nuclear shape from the measured @xmath0-decay pattern @xcite .",
    "pairing correlations are also important to describe nuclei out of closed shells .",
    "their influence on the gt profiles was studied in ref .",
    "@xcite , concluding that the main effect is to decrease slightly the strength at low energies and to create new transitions , mainly at high energies , that are forbidden in the absence of such correlations .",
    "the effect of the ph and pp residual interactions is also well known .",
    "the repulsive ph interaction redistributes the gt strength by shifting it to higher excitation energies causing a displacement of the gt resonance .",
    "it also reduces somewhat the total strength .",
    "the attractive pp interaction moves the strength to lower energies .",
    "its effect on the gt resonance is in general negligible , but nevertheless , the changes induced in the low - energy region are of great relevance in the calculation of the @xmath0-decay half - lives , which are only sensitive to the strength contained in the energy region below the @xmath7-energy window .",

    "these regions contain in general well deformed nuclei , where the present approach is more suitable . on the other hand , weakly deformed transitional isotopes , such as light ge and se isotopes and heavy ru and pd isotopes",
    "are not so well described .",
    "furthermore , in the light isotopes of all the isotopic chains , which are closer to the valley of stability , the half - lives are larger because of the small @xmath85 energies involved . in these cases",
    "the half - lives are determined exclusively by the very low energy tail of the gt strength distribution contained in the narrow window below @xmath85 .",
    "therefore , tiny variations in the description of the gt strength distribution in the low - lying energy region can drive sizable effects in the half - lives .",
    "of course it is also important to describe the half - lives of the long - lived isotopes , but their significance to constrain the gt strength distribution is minor since the half - lives are insensitive to most of this distribution .",
    "half - lives for neutron - rich kr , sr , zr , and mo isotopes calculated from self - consistent deformed qrpa calculations with the gogny d1 m interaction and experimental values of @xmath85 @xcite agree with the results in this work within the uncertainties of the calculations .",
    "the agreement is also very reasonable between the calculated half - lives and those obtained from deformed qrpa calculations using deformed woods - saxon potentials to generate the mean field and complemented with realistic cd - bonn residual forces @xcite .",
    "the agreement is also good with the results in ref .",
    "@xcite using the skyrme force sly4 with consistent residual interactions in the ph channel as mentioned earlier .",
    "fig . 7 in that reference displays this comparison .",
    "it is also worth noticing that the worst agreement with experiment occurs in the light ge isotopes , as well as in heavy pd isotopes . in these cases",
    "the calculations overestimate the experiment leaving room for contributions coming from first forbidden ( ff ) transitions .",
    "one can understand from simple qualitative arguments that the role of ff transitions is expected to be more important in lighter ge and in pd isotopes .",
    "thus , for @xmath93ge , @xmath94se , @xmath95kr , and @xmath96sr isotopes , the last occupied proton orbitals come basically from the @xmath97 and @xmath98 negative - parity spherical shells . on the other hand",
    "the neutrons in @xmath99ge isotopes occupy orbitals belonging to the @xmath100 and @xmath101 positive - parity spherical shells .",
    "therefore , in the @xmath0-decay one neutron in a positive - parity state is transformed into a proton that would sit in a negative - parity state , thus suppressing gt and favoring ff transitions in the low - lying transitions .",
    "this is particularly true for the lighter ge isotopes . in the heavier ones , other neutron states with negative parity ( @xmath102 )",
    "have to be considered because of deformation effects .",
    "the same argument can be applied to the lighter se , kr , and sr isotopes , but in these cases proton states from positive parity ( @xmath103 ) are closer in energy and would participate in the decay favoring gt transitions .",
    "the situation is different in the case of ru and pd isotopes .",
    "now the available proton states for the decay are of positive parity ( @xmath103 ) , whereas most of the last occupied neutrons belong to negative - parity states ( @xmath102 ) , thus favoring ff transitions . according to calculations @xcite of the ff transitions in this mass region , minor effects",
    "are expected from them .",
    "nevertheless , it would be very interesting in the future to study systematically the ff contributions in all the isotopes in this mass region .",
    "another feature observed in the present calculations is the existence of some odd - even staggering effect in the calculated half - lives , which is not observed experimentally .",
    "this effect is particularly evident in ru and pd isotopes .",
    "there are not many calculations involving simultaneously even - even and odd-@xmath1 isotopes , but some of them exhibit some sort of staggering effect as well @xcite .",
    "the appearance of this effect in the half - lives suggests some deficiency in the model that might be related to the determination of ground - state energies in the odd-@xmath1 systems @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , there are more sources of uncertainty related to the odd-@xmath1 systems that should be considered as well @xcite , such as the spin and parity assignments , the blocking procedures or the treatment of the 1qp excitations involving the odd nucleon",
    ". this issue will be the subject of a future investigation in this direction .",
    "it is also interesting to look for the simultaneous appearance of structural effects that eventually can appear in different observables .",
    "one example can be seen in the evolution of the experimental half - lives with the number of neutrons in the isotopic chains . at some points",
    "one observes discontinuities in the general trends of behavior , such as in the mass regions @xmath50se , @xmath51kr , @xmath104sr , and @xmath105ru .",
    "these experimental findings on the half - lives are correlated with the shape transitions in figs .",
    "[ se_beta_rc][ru_beta_rc ] predicted in the model .",
    "one can not state firmly that these sharp changes in the behavior of the half - lives are signatures of shape transitions , but certainly this correlation can not be discarded given that a change of the deformation in the nuclear system involves a structural change to whom the half - lives are also sensitive .",
    "finally , the impact of deformation on the decay properties can be better appreciated in a systematic comparison of the half - lives calculated with both the spherical approximation and the deformation that corresponds to the minimum of the pec for each isotope",
    ". then , fig .",
    "[ fig_ratios ] shows the ratios of the calculated and experimental half - lives for two sets of data corresponding to a spherical calculation ( open dots ) and to a deformed calculation ( solid dots ) at the self - consistent deformation that gives the minimum of the pecs .",
    "these ratios are plotted as a function of the experimental half - lives ( a ) and as a function of the quadrupole deformation at the minimum of the pecs ( b ) . to increase the size of the sample , besides the isotopes considered in this work with measured half - lives , i have also included the set of zr and mo neutron - rich isotopes studied in ref .",
    "@xcite with measured half - lives . in the upper panel of fig .",
    "[ fig_ratios ] ( a ) one can see how deformation improves the description of the half - lives .",
    "practically all the full black dots are contained within the horizontal lines defining the region of one order of magnitude agreement . on the other hand ,",
    "the results from the spherical calculation are more spread out with larger discrepancy with experiment .",
    "one can also see that the results are better in both spherical and deformed calculations for shorter half - lives , whereas the results for larger half - lives show sizable deviations .",
    "the latter correspond to isotopes close to the valley of stability with small @xmath85-values , where the half - lives are only sensitive to the small portion of the gt strength distribution at low excitation energies below @xmath85 . in the lower panel ( b )",
    "one can see the results from a different point of view and it can be studied whether deformation improves the results evenly in the whole range of deformations or whether its effect is stronger at large deformations .",
    "three regions of accumulation of results can be distinguished .",
    "two of them correspond to well deformed nuclei located at @xmath106 and @xmath107 . in these regions",
    "the deformed calculations clearly improve the results from the spherical ones that show a tendency to underestimate the experiment .",
    "the other region corresponds to @xmath108 values , where nuclei are softer or transitional and the deformed formalism should be improved . in this region",
    "the results are more scattered than in the well deformed regions , but the deformed calculations show deviations that rarely exceed one order of magnitude , still representing an improvement over the spherical results .    in order to have a quantitative estimation of the quality of the various calculations , following the analysis made in ref .",

    "the analysis of the results shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_ratios ] involving @xmath117 nuclei leads to the values @xmath118 , @xmath119 , and @xmath120 in the spherical case and @xmath121 , @xmath122 , and @xmath123 in the deformed one , showing clearly the improvement achieved with the deformed formalism .",
    "a microscopic approach based on a deformed qrpa calculation on top of a self - consistent mean field obtained with the sly4 skyrme interaction has been used to study the nuclear structure and the decay properties of even and odd neutron - rich isotopes in the mass region @xmath124 . the nuclear model and interaction",
    "have been successfully tested in the past providing good agreement with the available experimental information on bulk properties all along the nuclear chart .",
    "decay properties in different mass regions have been well reproduced as well . the structural isotopic evolution has been studied from their pecs .",
    "depending on the isotopic chain , a large variety of nuclear shapes is found , including spherical shapes , well developed deformed shapes , and transitional soft shapes .",
    "charge radii have been also investigated , showing the connection between a discontinuous behavior in the isotopic trend with a shape transition and comparing the results with the available measurements from laser spectroscopy .",
    "then , gamow - teller strength distributions and @xmath0-decay half - lives have been computed for the equilibrium shapes .",
    "the isotopic evolution of the gt strength distributions exhibits some typical features , such as gt resonances increasing in energy and strength as the number of neutrons increases .",
    "effects of deformation are hard to see on a global scale , but they become apparent in the low excitation energy below @xmath85 energies , a region that determines the half - lives .",
    "half - lives have been calculated using @xmath85 energies calculated with the force sly4 . in general , a reasonable agreement with experiment is obtained , especially in the short - lived nuclei of ge , se , kr , sr , and ru isotopes .",
    "the results are comparable to other calculations using different approaches for the mean field and/or residual interactions .",
    "special difficulties are found to describe properly the half - lives of the lighter ge isotopes and the pd isotopes . these are examples of transitional nuclei where the nuclear structure is more involved and the concept of a well defined shape might not be meaningful .",
    "a systematic comparison of the ratios of the calculated and experimental half - lives has been done using both spherical and deformed calculations , showing that the inclusion of deformation improves significantly the description of the decay properties .",
    "experimental information on the energy distribution of the gt strength is a valuable piece of knowledge about nuclear structure in this mass region .",
    "the study of these distributions is within the current experimental capabilities in the case of the lighter isotopes considered in this work .",
    "here , i have presented theoretical predictions for them based on microscopic calculations .",
    "similarly , measuring the half - lives of the heavier isotopes will be highly beneficial to model the _",
    "r _ process and to constrain theoretical nuclear models .",
