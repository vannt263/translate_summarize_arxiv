    "in the context of interfacial electrochemistry the bulk electrolyte can conveniently be thought of as a large , homogeneous reservoir of charge , adsorbate particles , and energy .",
    "then one can focus on the metal ",
    "electrolyte interface , which can be viewed as an essentially two - dimensional system of ions and molecules at or near a solid surface .",
    "consequently , interfacial electrochemistry can profitably be thought of as a branch of surface science .",
    "it is therefore natural that a number of experimental and theoretical methods originally associated with more traditional branches of surface science now are routinely applied in interfacial electrochemistry , including several that are discussed in this volume .    on the theoretical side ,",
    "one such method is computational lattice - gas modeling .",
    "this method is particularly well suited to the study of fluctuations and phase transitions in systems characterized by specific chemisorption at well defined sites on the surface .",
    "different aspects of this approach have been reviewed several times by others @xcite , as well as by one of the present authors @xcite . here , it will only be described briefly .",
    "monte carlo simulation of lattice - gas models as a tool for understanding interfacial electrochemistry is the main topic of this chapter .",
    "why bother with monte carlo simulation when there are so many mean - field techniques , ranging from the simple frumkin and temkin isotherms to sophisticated cluster - variation methods ?",
    "this is a natural question , and there are three compelling answers :    1 .",
    "mean - field methods are really not very accurate for most two - dimensional systems @xcite .",
    "this is not to say that very useful results can not be obtained by mean - field methods , for they certainly can , but simple mean - field methods ignore the spatial structure of the system .",
    "a nontrivial amount of work and attention goes into manually incorporating enough of this structure to give accurate results , especially in the vicinity of phase transitions .",
    "in contrast , monte carlo codes naturally take spatial fluctuations into account .",
    "most of these codes are quite simple to write and easily adapted to model different systems .",
    "monte carlo methods are not limited to the study of equilibrium properties .",
    "dynamic monte carlo simulations provide a tool to study time dependent phenomena in systems where spatial fluctuations may strongly modify the time evolution .",
    "applied in this way , monte carlo simulation provides a more detailed supplement to standard rate - equation methods .",
    "computer technology has now evolved to a point where extensive simulations can be performed on work stations or personal computers that are well within the budget for most groups .",
    "actually , several computers that are perfectly able to handle large monte carlo simulations may already be sitting in your laboratory !",
    "the competitive edge of methods that are analytically solvable or rely on numerical solution of relatively small sets of equations is much smaller than it was only a few years ago .",
    "the purpose of this chapter is to discuss some of the basic aspects of monte carlo simulation directly in the context of interfacial electrochemistry .",
    "it is not intended to be a full textbook on monte carlo simulation .",
    "there is no sense in duplicating the excellent textbooks @xcite and large tutorial articles @xcite that already exist .",
    "rather , we hope to illustrate some of the details and pitfalls associated with constructing and running monte carlo simulations of specific systems of interest in surface electrochemistry .",
    "the outline of the rest of this chapter is as follows .",

    "[ sec : example ] , we discuss three illustrative examples drawn from our own research experience : the adsorption of bromine onto ag(100 ) @xcite , the underpotential deposition ( upd ) of copper on au(111 ) from a sulfate - containing electrolyte @xcite , and the electrosorption of urea on pt(100 ) from an acid electrolyte @xcite .",
    "particular emphasis is given to the simulational aspects of these projects .",
    "since this is not a review article , references to the original literature have been limited to those we thought most illustrative for our purposes .",
    "in lattice - gas models adsorption is only allowed on a discrete lattice of adsorption sites .",
    "the concentration of adsorbate at site @xmath0 , @xmath1 , is @xmath2 if the site is occupied by the adsorbate and @xmath3 otherwise .",
    "the energy of a particular configuration of occupied sites , @xmath4 , is given by the grand - canonical lattice - gas hamiltonian @xmath5 the electrochemical potential of the adsorbate in solution is @xmath6 , and the first term on the right - hand side is the free energy of adsorption when adsorbate - adsorbate interactions are ignored .",

    "( [ eq : lg2 ] ) . in principle",
    "this can be done directly , but in practice another approach is often used . for a given point in the phase diagram , the ground state corresponds to the phase with the lowest energy . a list of the conceivable ground states compatible with the lattice symmetry @xcite and their energies is generated .",
    "then a ground - state diagram can be constructed automatically by finding the lowest - energy phase directly while scanning in the @xmath41 and @xmath42 directions .",
    "in contrast , the finite - temperature phase diagram for most systems can only be mapped out using numerical methods , such as the monte carlo simulations that are the main subject of this chapter . since the number of possible ground states for systems with longer - range interactions can be very large ,",
    "it is in practice advisable to check the ground - state calculations and monte carlo simulations at low temperature against each other for consistency .",
    "when two types of ions adsorb onto the surface , the adsorbed charge density is @xmath45 in the absence of diffusion and in the limit of vanishing potential sweep rate @xcite , the voltammetric current can be estimated in terms of the equilibrium lattice - gas response functions @xmath46 . specifically , using the chain rule this quasi - equilibrium current is obtained as @xmath47 the total differential of the charge density is @xmath48 \\;,\\ ] ] which can be simplified with the maxwell relation @xmath49 .",

    "coverages , charges , and currents are given here per adsorption site .",
    "they can be converted to the experimentally measured units of inverse surface area through division by the area per adsorption site .",
    "accurate theoretical description of lateral interactions in an adsorbed layer must consider the complete substrate - adlayer - solution system .",
    "for instance , the geometry of adlayers observed _ in situ _ for co on pt(111 ) are different for ultra - high vacuum , high - pressure gas , and electrochemical environments @xcite .",
    "in addition , adsorption or solvation at one point on the surface can affect adsorption at another point through deformation of the substrate or distortion of the substrate electron structure . because of the complicated nature of these systems , deriving accurate _ ab initio _ estimates of interaction energies in electrochemical adsorption problems is presently not feasible .",
    "a practical alternative is to treat the interactions as adjustable parameters .",
    "because of the large number of parameters and the time - consuming simulations , parameter estimation by a formal optimization procedure must often be abandoned in favor of adjusting the parameters manually to incorporate experimental results and other chemical information efficiently .",
    "this method also has its difficulties .",
    "in particular , all of the potential consequences of adjusting a parameter may not be easily foreseen , and often several parameters must be adjusted in concert to change a single aspect of the model . in addition , there is no guarantee that the observations from two radically different sets of interactions are measurably different in the region explored by the simulations .",
    "nevertheless , the encouraging results of previous lattice - gas studies of electrochemical systems @xcite indicate that when proper attention is paid to including all available experimental information consistently , this approach has considerable predictive power .",
    "furthermore , as effective interactions obtained by first - principles calculations become available in the future , results from lattice - gas models will provide crucial information for testing the consistency of such first - principles interactions with experimentally observed thermodynamic and structural information .",
    "the modeling strategy starts by using theoretical and experimental knowledge about the substrate structure and the shapes and sizes of the adsorbate particles to formulate a specific lattice - gas model .",
    "the coverages and adlayer structure of different adsorbate phases can be determined from microscopy , scattering , radiochemical experiments , or standard electrochemical methods .",
    "group - theoretical ground - state calculations @xcite are then performed to determine a minimal set of effective interactions consistent with the observed adsorbate phases @xcite .",
    "a ground - state diagram is obtained by pairwise equating the ground - state energies of the different phases , as obtained from the lattice - gas hamiltonian , _",

    ", monte carlo methods have contributed significantly to the theoretical understanding of fluctuations and ordering in adsorbate systems .",
    "monte carlo codes also have the advantage that they are relatively easy to modify to accommodate changes in lattice structure and/or interaction geometries and ranges .",
    "this is useful when one wants to modify the model to improve the agreement with experiments , or refurbish an existing code to model a different system .",
    "one monte carlo method for estimating eq .",
    "( [ eq : expectation ] ) is to evaluate the sum directly from randomly generated adsorbate configurations . for most problems where temperature is important ,",
    "this method is inefficient since only the most energetically favorable configurations make significant contributions to the sum .",
    "a much more efficient method , called _ importance sampling _ , samples more frequently from the energetically favorable configurations .",
    "usually this is done by using the boltzmann weight , the probability of an equilibrium system being in a particular state , to determine the sampling probability of that state .",
    "in addition , one can use the idea of _ detailed balance _",
    ", that the rate of going from state @xmath56 to state @xmath57 in equilibrium is the same as the rate of going in the opposite direction .",
    "if @xmath58 is the density of states for configuration @xmath56 and the probability of going from configuration @xmath56 to configuration @xmath57 during a certain period of time is @xmath59 , the transition rate is @xmath60 .",
    "detailed balance implies that @xmath61 to sample configurations according to the boltzmann weights , the transition probabilities need to obey @xmath62    an efficient monte carlo simulation method for sampling the equilibrium ensemble of a lattice gas is obtained by considering a long series of small , random changes in the concentration that obey detailed balance . before considering particular algorithms ,",
    "it is necessary to factor the transition probability into the probability of attempting a move , @xmath63 , and the probability of accepting the move @xmath64 , _ i.e. _ @xmath65 .",
    "a commonly used and intuitively appealing monte carlo algorithm is the metropolis algorithm .",
    "given a particular configuration , all possible changes to the configuration are given the same attempt probability @xmath66 .",

    "( [ eq : detail2 ] ) , for all cases .",
    "a similar algorithm , known by the name glauber @xcite , also obeys detailed balance .",
    "it accepts the move with probability @xmath68 } } \\;.\\ ] ] the two algorithms become identical as @xmath69 , except for @xmath70 .",
    "another importance - sampling algorithm is useful when more than two configurations are possible for the portion of the surface being updated . for one move in this _ heat bath _ algorithm , the boltzmann factor for every possible configuration",
    "is calculated , and these weights are used to randomly choose the final configuration .",
    "the new configuration is accepted automatically , with the initial configuration as one of the possible choices . in the case",
    "only two configurations are possible , the heat - bath algorithm reduces to the glauber algorithm @xcite . that this algorithm satisfies detailed balance can be easily verified .",
    "commonly , monte carlo updates change only one adsorption site .",
    "however , in many applications equilibration can be slow , either because of the large fluctuations that occur near second - order phase transitions ( critical slowing - down @xcite ) or because of large local energy barriers .",
    "in such cases _ cluster update _",
    "algorithms @xcite that involve several related sites in one monte carlo update can be useful .",
    "a specific example of a heat - bath cluster algorithm designed to overcome slowing - down due to high local barriers against single - particle moves is discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : urea ] .    when importance sampling is used to incorporate the weighting , many thermodynamic averages can be estimated from the moments of the sampled quantities .",
    "for example , the @xmath71-th moment of the number of adsorbed particles of species @xmath14 is @xmath72 where @xmath73 is the number of samples taken during the simulation .",
    "the coverage is then just @xmath74 with @xmath23 the number of adsorption sites .",
    "the response functions , @xmath75 , which are related to the quasi - equilibrium cv current ( see sec .  [",
    "sec : lg ] ) , are @xcite @xmath76 the response function is proportional to the variance of the number of adsorbed @xmath14 particles , which corresponds to the fluctuations in the coverage .",
    "equation ( [ eq : chi ] ) is an example of the class of important results in statistical mechanics , called fluctuation - dissipation theorems @xcite . in our practical context",
    "it provides a convenient way to calculate the response functions without numerical differentiation .",
    "the cross - response function , @xmath46 , is calculated entirely analogously , using the covariance of @xmath14 and @xmath34 .    in thermodynamic regions far from any phase transitions ,",
    "the fluctuations in the numbers of adsorbate particles have a small correlation length .",
    "the surface can therefore be divided into independent pieces , and the fluctuations in adparticle numbers are proportional to the surface area . as a consequence the _ relative _ fluctuations , which are proportional to @xmath77 vanish with system size as @xmath78 .",
    "near a second - order phase transition on the other hand , the correlation length becomes comparable to the system size , and the fluctuations and response functions depend on @xmath23 as power laws .",
    "the power - law exponents depend on the nature of the phase transition , and can be studied by finite - size scaling techniques @xcite .",
    "the actual execution of a monte carlo simulation involves several steps .",
    "an initial configuration is constructed , followed by a sufficient number of monte carlo updates to allow it to reach equilibrium .",
    "a good habit is to construct the initial configuration using different phases for the right and left halves of the simulated system .",
    "this reduces the probability of relaxing to a long - lived metastable phase rather than true equilibrium .",
    "also , several quantities should be sampled periodically during the equilibration process to ensure that the system has indeed reached thermodynamic equilibrium before equilibrium sampling begins .",
    "equilibrium samples should be spaced far enough apart to be statistically independent .",
    "this is normally not a problem in parameter regions far from any phase transitions .",
    "near phase transitions , however , critical slowing - down leads to very strong correlations between subsequent configurations and requires the sampling to be performed at longer intervals .",
    "while sampling with intervals that are too short leads one to underestimate fluctuations and thereby response functions , sampling too infrequently is a waste of computer time .",
    "optimal sampling can be achieved by calculating time correlation functions @xcite of the quantities being sampled and adjusting the interval accordingly . to improve accuracy ,",
    "averages should also be performed over several trials , each consisting of equilibration followed by sampling .",
    "finally , it must be noted that there is a difference between a single attempted move , often called a _",
    "monte carlo step _",
    "( mcs ) , and the more frequently encountered _",
    "monte carlo step per site _ ( mcss ) .",
    "the later is useful because it is independent of the number of lattice sites and represents the smallest unit of updates over which the lattice as a whole can relax . these units should be distinguished clearly when reporting the results of monte carlo simulations .      in the previous subsection we discussed the basic interpretation of monte carlo simulation as a method to measure the equilibrium partition function and moments of quantities of interest . when it is used in this way",
    ", the simulation says nothing about the time dependence of the system .",
    "consequently , one can use _ any _ algorithm that speeds up equilibration and reduces the correlations between subsequent configurations .",
    "the only requirement is that it must obey detailed balance in order to ensure that thermodynamic equilibrium is indeed reached and importance sampling can be used .    a very different application of monte carlo simulation results when the number of mcss is viewed as _",
    "time_. then the simulation can be viewed as a `` movie '' of the dynamic process .",
    "several examples of such movies can be found at the authors web site @xcite .",
    "it is clear that a particular monte carlo algorithm does not necessarily say anything about the time evolution of the corresponding chemical or physical system unless it is specifically constructed to do so .",
    "it is possible to construct a monte carlo simulation that evolves like the physical system , at least for dynamics that can be reasonably modeled as a stochastic process .",
    "this is the case when the dynamics are dominated by thermally activated processes such as adsorption , desorption , and diffusion .",
    "here we describe the recipe for transforming a lattice - gas hamiltonian , hopefully determined to reasonable accuracy by equilibrium studies , into such a dynamical model .",
    "essentially , every mcs should correspond to a thermally activated transition between states separated by energy barriers , with the transition rates described by arrhenius rates involving the barrier heights .",
    "these barrier heights can be constructed by a method essentially equivalent to the butler - volmer approximation @xcite .",
    "this is done in the framework of activated - complex theory , or transition - state theory , with the initial and final states described by the lattice gas .",
    "the activated complex can not be represented by the lattice gas , but a free energy can be assigned to it using the model we now describe .    a schematic free - energy surface is presented in fig .  [",
    "fig : barrier ] for several possible lattice - gas configurations , @xmath79 .",
    "first consider the two states with free energy @xmath80 ( depicted as solid line segments ) .",
    "the horizontal line segments correspond to the lattice - gas states , which are locally stable .",
    "the free energy is taken to increase linearly as the system moves toward the activated complex , which occurs where the two free - energy surfaces intersect .",
    "this linear assumption for the free - energy increase leads directly to the butler - volmer equation @xcite .",
    "the height of the free - energy barrier associated with this case , @xmath81 , is a parameter which can be adjusted to describe particular processes .    in general the slope of the free energy",
    "can also be adjusted to describe specific chemical systems . if the two slopes are described by the angles @xmath82 and @xmath83 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : barrier ] , then changes in the activated - complex free energy associated with @xmath84 , can be found in terms of the _ symmetry factor _",
    "@xmath85 for a transition from the @xmath86 state to the @xmath87 state , the free energy of the activated complex is @xmath88 when @xmath89 , fig .",
    "[ fig : barrier ] is not symmetric about the activated complex .",
    "so if @xmath90 while @xmath91 , the activated - complex free energy is @xmath92 where the symmetry when @xmath93 is obvious . for the most general case with @xmath94 and @xmath95 ,",
    "the free energy of the activated complex is @xmath96 this free energy is unaltered by reflection around the transition state .",
    "in addition , the energy barriers @xmath97 and @xmath98 are not altered by shifting the zero of the free - energy scale .",
    "the symmetric case , @xmath93 , gives the convenient relation @xmath99 \\;.\\ ] ] in this case the activated - complex free energy is found by adding a constant barrier to the arithmetic mean of the free energies of the lattice - gas states @xcite .",
    "once a consistent barrier scheme has been identified , a number of reasonable transition rates can be constructed , subject only to the requirement of detailed balance .",
    "the simplest rate is probably the one given by @xmath100 where @xmath101 is the attempt frequency , typically on the order of a phonon frequency ( @xmath102  @xmath103  hz ) .",
    "another useful choice is the transition dynamics algorithm @xcite , @xmath104   \\left[1+e^{\\left({\\cal h}(c')-{\\cal h}^*(c , c')\\right)/rt}\\right ] } \\;,\\ ] ] which is simply the product of the glauber transition rates from @xmath4 to the activated complex , and from the activated complex to @xmath105 .",
    "the single - ion processes included in the dynamical model discussed here are diffusion to nearest - neighbor sites and adsorption / desorption at single sites .",
    "we assume a single value for the angle in fig .  [",
    "fig : barrier ] for all configurations with the moving ion near the surface , which implies @xmath93 for diffusion . in general , the angle associated with an ion far from the surface has a different value , but we make the reasonable @xcite choice @xmath93 so eq .  ( [ eq : barrier ] )",
    "can be used for all microscopic processes . on the other hand ,",
    "we use a different barrier , @xmath106 , for each combination of ion and process @xmath107 ( @xmath108 for adsorption / desorption and @xmath109 for diffusion ) .",
    "the values of the @xmath106 determine the relative weights among the different microscopic processes .",
    "reasonable agreement with experimental time scales would indicate that the combination of attempt frequencies and barrier heights chosen is realistic .      in many situations of experimental interest ,",
    "a direct implementation of an importance - sampling monte carlo algorithm with butler - volmer transition rates would require impossibly long simulation times .",
    "the basic reason for this is that only a very small fraction of attempted monte carlo updates may actually result in a change of the current configuration .",
    "since we are now interested in the dynamical details , we can not solve this problem by constructing a cluster algorithm , since this would generally change the dynamics completely .",
    "what is needed is an algorithm which can simply reduce the computer time needed to perform the large number of unsuccessful attempts that would be made between each successful update while remaining faithful to the original dynamics .",
    "a class of algorithms that perform this feat are known as _ rejection - free algorithms _",
    "many such algorithms have been invented and re - invented over the years ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) , they are all essentially equivalent . in these algorithms",
    "the acceptance probability is unity , but the probability of attempting a move is based on its boltzmann weight .",
    "they can also be thought of as a metropolis or heat - bath simulation with the number of rejected moves before the next successful move calculated analytically .",
    "the @xmath7-fold way @xcite , introduced by bortz , kalos , and lebowitz , is one of the best known and earliest of these methods .",
    "rejection - free algorithms are implemented by keeping a list of all the possible moves .",
    "each move is weighted by its rate @xmath110 , so that making a random choice from the list is biased towards faster processes .",
    "the stochastic nature of real processes is captured by updating the simulation clock after each move by a random number that represents the time elapsed since the last move . for the current configuration , the overall rate for the system to have any move accepted is the sum of all the individual move rates , @xmath111 . since the probability of escaping from the current configuration has a constant rate , the elapsed time until the accepted change has an exponential distribution , and can be found using @xmath112 where @xmath113 is a random number uniformly distributed on @xmath114 .",
    "here @xmath115 is a continuous time in units of mcs .",
    "the weighted list can be visualized as a line segment whose length equals the sum of all the weights .",
    "then , choosing from the weighted list is accomplished by picking a random point along the line segment , _",
    "i.e. _ picking a number on the interval [ 0,1 ) and multiplying by the segment length . determining which choice this corresponds to involves searching the list of process rates .",
    "this searching can become an important bottle neck in the implementation of @xmath7-fold way algorithms , but the effect can be reduced by using a binary tree to search for the choice from the weighted list . building a binary tree of partial sums ( of the rates ) to speed up",
    "the search is not difficult , and a great deal of help is available from many introductory texts on data structures @xcite .",
    "the rates make up the leaves at the bottom of the tree , the value of each node is the sum of all the leaves below it . as the simulation proceeds , the values of the leaves change and the nodes must be updated .",
    "two approaches can be taken .",
    "the simplest is to move up the tree from the changed leaf , explicitly adding the values of the children to find the value of the node .",
    "a faster approach is to calculate the change in the leaf value , and add this to all the nodes above the leaf .",
    "unfortunately , with this faster approach truncation errors will eventually cause the nodes to not accurately reflect the values of the leaves .",
