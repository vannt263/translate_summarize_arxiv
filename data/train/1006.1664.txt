    "so far , there are no definitive observational proofs of the existence of intermediate - mass black holes ( imbhs ) , i.e. of black holes ( bhs ) with a mass ranging from @xmath5 to @xmath6 ( see van der marel 2004 for a review )",
    ". however , the formation of imbhs is predicted by various theoretical scenarios . in the early universe ,",
    "imbhs might form via the direct collapse of metal - free stars ( heger et al . 2003 ) or via the collapse of gaseous disks in the center of pre - galactic halos ( begelman , volonteri & rees 2006 ) .",
    "imbhs might form even in more recent epochs , via the direct collapse of metal - poor stars ( mapelli , colpi & zampieri 2009 ; zampieri & roberts 2009 ; mapelli et al .",
    "2010 ) , the repeated mergers of stellar mass bhs in globular clusters ( gcs , miller & hamilton 2002 ) and the runaway growth of imbhs ( portegies zwart & mcmillan 2002 , hereafter pzm02 ) in massive ( @xmath7 ) young ( @xmath8 yr ) clusters ( ycs ) .",
    "in particular , the runaway growth scenario predicts that star clusters with initial half - mass relaxation times @xmath9 myr are dominated , during the core collapse , by star collisions , which build up one or even two ( grkan , fregeau & rasio 2006 ) very massive objects , which likely evolve into imbhs ( pzm02 ) .",
    "thus , ycs are among the best environments where we can search for imbhs .    however , the observational features of imbhs are difficult to pinpoint . there are hints ( strohmayer & mushotzky 2003 ; kaaret , ward & zezas 2004 ; strohmayer et al .",
    "2007 ) that imbhs might power some of the brightest ultra - luminous x - ray sources ( ulxs , i.e. those sources with a x - ray luminosity higher than the one predicted for a @xmath10 bh ) .",
    "other studies point out that the presence of imbhs may be inferred from anomalies in the acceleration of millisecond pulsars ( colpi , possenti & gualandris 2002 ; colpi , mapelli & possenti 2003 ) or from the observation of high - velocity stars in gcs ( mapelli et al . 2005 ) .",
    "furthermore , the combination of kinematic and photometric data with dynamical models suggests the presence of imbhs in the gc g1 ( gebhardt , rich & ho 2002 , 2005 ) in the andromeda galaxy and in the gc m15 ( gerssen et al .",
    "2002 ; van den bosch et al .",
    "2006 ) in the milky way ( mw ) .",
    "finally , gravitational waves ( gws ) will provide a powerful tool to detect imbhs .",
    "in fact , imbhs lying in the center of dense clusters are expected to form binaries with stars or stellar mass bhs ( e.g. sigurdsson & hernquist 1993 ) .",
    "such binaries harden ( i.e. progressively reduce their orbital separation ) due to gravitational encounters ( colpi et al .",
    "2003 and references therein ) .",
    "when the orbital separation is sufficiently small and if the companion of the imbh is a compact object , such as a stellar mass bh or a neutron star ( ns ) , the binary enters a regime in which the orbital evolution is driven by radiation reaction induced by gw emission .",
    "this further reduces the orbital separation , until the system merges .",
    "gws emitted by binaries hosting imbhs are mostly in the frequency range accessible to current or forthcoming detectors , such as the laser interferometer gravitational - wave observatory ( ligo ; barish & weiss 1999 ; abbott et al .",
    "2009 ) and virgo ( acernese et al . 2004 ) in initial and advanced configuration ( also known as first and second generation laser interferometers ) . gws from imbh mergers also fall in the frequency range of future gw observatories , such as the laser interferometer space antenna ( lisa ; bender et al .",
    "1998 ) and third generation ground - based instruments , for which we adopt , as an example , the concept of the einstein gravitational - wave telescope ( et ; freise et al 2008 , hild et al . 2008 ) .",
    "in particular , miller ( 2002 ) , considering imbhs in gcs , predicts that tens of sources connected with galactic imbhs will be detectable with lisa in a 5 yr integration .",
    "more recent studies investigate the emission of gws from imbh@xmath3imbh binaries ( fregeau et al .",
    "2006 ) , whose existence is predicted by simulations ( grkan et al .",
    "massive stellar mass bhs ( @xmath11 ) are also found to be important sources of gws , detectable by ligo and by advanced ligo ( oleary , oshaughnessy & rasio 2007 ) .",
    "inspirals of a ns or of a stellar mass bh into an imbh in gcs are detectable by advanced ligo , with rates up to tens per year ( brown et al . 2007 ; mandel et al . 2008 ) .",
    "finally , et might be able to observe gws from imbhs produced by seed bhs at high redshift ( sesana et al .",
    "2009 ; gair et al .",
    "2009a , 2009b ) .    in this paper",
    "we extend the previous studies by miller ( 2002 ) and by mandel et al .",
    "( 2008 ) to imbhs hosted in ycs , making predictions for the detection rate of gws from imbhs in ycs .",
    "ycs are an ideal environment in which gws from imbhs can be studied , as ycs are a key place for the formation of imbhs and because the density of ycs is expected to rapidly increase with redshift ( hopkins & beacom 2006 ) .",
    "for this reason , we pay particular attention to the integration with redshift of the detection rate .",
    "we consider , as representative of the science capability of first , second and third generation ground - based instruments initial ligo , advanced ligo and et , respectively , and for space - borne instruments lisa .",
    "we note that space - based instruments with peak sensitivity in the frequency region @xmath12 hz that fills the gap between lisa and ground based laser interferometers would be ideal for studying imbhs , due to the emission frequency of systems in the mass range @xmath13 . such instruments , such as decigo ( kawamura et al .",
    "2006 ) , alia ( bender et al . 2005 ) and the big - bang - observer ( phinney et al .",
    "2003 ) are being investigated , but their timescale is currently very uncertain and for this reason we will not consider them in this paper .",
    "in this section , we will focus on the properties of imbhs in ycs and on their role as sources of gws .",
    "in particular , we will consider two galaxies : the mw , for which we have the best observational data about ycs , and the antennae , which host a large population of ycs .",
    "these two galaxies can also be considered as prototypical of , respectively , a bright disk galaxy with a typical star formation ( sf ) rate for the current cosmic epoch , and a merging system involving two massive disk galaxies undergoing enhanced sf , a configuration that is expected to be increasingly common at higher redshift .",
    "we will subsequently generalize our results and make predictions for the detection rate of gws by ligo , advanced ligo , lisa and et .",
    "first , we derive an estimate of the number of imbhs which may exist in the ycs of the mw . as the ycs reside in the high - density regions of our galaxy , their detection and observation",
    "are made difficult by galactic absorption .",
    "thus , only data for @xmath14 massive ( @xmath7 ) galactic ycs are available ( davies et al . 2007 and references therein ) . however , gvaramadze , gualandris & portegies zwart ( 2008 ) estimate that the total number of massive galactic ycs is @xmath15 , much higher than the number of the detected ones .",
    "the runaway growth of imbhs is possible only in those ycs with half - mass relaxation time @xmath9 myr ( pzm02 ) . extrapolating from the properties of the ycs listed in table 1 of portegies zwart et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , we find that a fraction @xmath16 of the galactic massive ycs have @xmath9 myr and thus may host imbhs . therefore , @xmath17 imbhs may exist at present in the ycs of the mw . in the following sections",
    ", we adopt the average value @xmath18 as a fiducial value .",
    "imbhs born via runaway collapse in the center of dense ycs likely form binaries with other stars or stellar mass bhs ( see colpi et al .",
    "2003 and references therein ) .",
    "such binaries harden due to three - body ( or even four - body ) interactions at a rate ( sigurdsson & phinney 1993 ; colpi et al .",
    "2003 ) @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the gravitational constant , @xmath21 is the mass of the imbh , @xmath22 is the core density of the yc , @xmath23 is the orbital separation of the binary and @xmath24 is the velocity dispersion in the core of the yc . in equation  ( [ eq : eq3body ] )",
    "we take as fiducial values for the mw @xmath25 stars pc@xmath26 and @xmath27 km s@xmath28 , which are the average values for the ycs listed in table 1 of portegies zwart et al .",
    "the masses of imbhs formed by runaway collapse ( @xmath21 ) likely range from @xmath29 to @xmath30 ( pzm02 ; grkan et al .",
    "finally , a typical initial orbital separation of @xmath31 a.u . is assumed , according to devecchi et al .",
    "( 2007 ) a.u . , adopted in our calculations , is the typical orbital separation of an imbh@xmath3bh ( or imbh@xmath3ns ) binary which is already hard ( i.e. whose binding energy is larger than the average kinetic energy of a star in the cluster , see e.g. heggie 1975 ) , but which is still in the regime where the hardening due to gravitational encounters is more important than that due to gravitational wave emission . for more details about the derivation of @xmath23 ,",
    "see table  1 , equations @xmath32 and the appendix  a of devecchi et al .",
    "we note that a more realistic approach should consider a distribution of values for @xmath23 , depending on @xmath21 , on the mass of the companion , on @xmath22 , on @xmath24 , and on the history of previous gravitational encounters . here",
    ", we simply adopt the peak of the distribution of @xmath23 for m@xmath33 m@xmath34 , as derived by devecchi et al .",
    "( 2007 ) , in order to provide an approximate estimate of @xmath35 . ] .",
    "typically , a merger between the imbh and its companion occurs after a few hundred three - body interactions ( miller 2002 ) . since it is hard to give a more accurate expression for the merger rate , in the following we will assume that the merger rate for a single imbh binary is @xmath36 ( miller 2002 ) , neglecting its possible dependence on various quantities , such as m@xmath37 .",
    "thus , the merger rate for a single imbh binary in the milky way is @xmath38 yr@xmath28 .",
    "we expect a galactic total merger rate @xmath39 , considering all the @xmath40 imbhs hosted in the ycs of the mw .",
    "the antennae are a well - studied nearby galaxy pair which is undergoing merger .",
    "as the merger triggers the sf , the antennae are richer in ycs than the mw .",
    "in fact , more than 1000 yc candidates have been observed in the antennae ( mengel et al .",
    "the expected number of massive ycs in the antennae can be derived with the same calculation used by gvaramadze et al .",
    "( 2008 ) for the mw .",
    "in particular , considering a sf rate ( sfr ) of @xmath41 yr@xmath28 for the antennae ( grimm , gilfanov & sunyaev 2003 ) , assuming an upper limit of @xmath42 yr for the age of the ycs and using a power - law cluster initial mass function ( mf ) with slope 2 ( gvaramadze et al . 2008 ) , we find that @xmath43 massive ycs are expected to exist in the antennae at present . assuming that the half - mass relaxation time for the ycs in the antennae is similar to that of the ycs in the mw",
    ", we expect that @xmath44 imbhs exist in the antennae .",
    "thus , the expected merger rate for imbhs in the antennae is @xmath45 , i.e. a factor of @xmath46 higher than for the mw .      from the calculations reported in the previous sections",
    ", we can predict a detection rate of gws emitted by merging imbhs in the local universe , expected for lisa , ligo , advanced ligo and et .",
    "in particular , we consider all the mergers involving imbh@xmath3bh and imbh@xmath3ns binaries on the past light cone , within a sphere of fixed radius , derived from the detection range of a given instrument , through the expression of the maximum observable redshift @xmath47 , see the description below . under the assumption that all the imbhs have the same mass ,",
    "such detection rate can be expressed as ( miller 2002 ) :    @xmath48    where @xmath49 is the light speed , @xmath50 ( @xmath51 km@xmath52s mpc@xmath28 , spergel et al .",
    "2007 ) the hubble constant , @xmath53 is the fraction of massive ycs hosting an imbh ( see section 2.1 ) , @xmath54 is the merger rate per imbh ( see section 2.1 ) , @xmath55^{1/2}$ ] ( where @xmath56 and @xmath57 , spergel et al .",
    "the factor @xmath58 accounts for the difference between the time in the rest frame of the source ( @xmath59 ) and of the observer ( @xmath60 ) .    in equation  ( [ eq : gw ] ) ,",
    "@xmath61 is the comoving number density of ycs which are sufficiently massive to host an imbh . assuming that a constant fraction of stars ( @xmath62 ) forms in clusters , @xmath61 can be approximately estimated as : @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the maximum lifetime of a yc : we adopt @xmath65 yr , as we account for the fact that the imbh@xmath3bh and imbh@xmath3ns mergers occur @xmath66 yr after the formation of the central binary .",
    "we must also include a correction @xmath67 which represents the fraction of ycs which avoid disruption and survive up to @xmath65 yr .",
    "@xmath67 is quite uncertain ; we adopt a conservative value @xmath68 from the literature ( lada & lada 2003 ; fall et al .",

    "furthermore , values of the redshift higher than 1 are important only for et ( see fig.[fig : fig1 ] ) .",
    "finally , we adopted a conservative value of @xmath67 ( @xmath79 ) , in order to avoid overestimating @xmath80 . ] .",
    "@xmath62 is the fraction of sf which occurs in clusters ( @xmath81 , lada & lada 2003 ) .",

    "finally , @xmath86 is the fraction of ycs which are massive enough to host imbhs : @xmath87 @xmath88 depends on @xmath21 , as the simulations show that the imbh mass scales with the cluster mass ( @xmath89 , pzm02 ) . in the following calculations , we assume that @xmath90 , that @xmath91 and that @xmath85 ( lada & lada 2003 ) . under these assumptions",
    ", @xmath86 goes from @xmath92 ( for an imbh mass @xmath93 ) to @xmath94 ( for an imbh mass @xmath95 ) .    in equation  ( [ eq : gw ] ) ,",
    "@xmath96 is the maximum redshift at which an event can be detected with a sky - location and orientation averaged signal - to - noise ratio @xmath97 by a single interferometer . in observations with a network of instruments , the signal - to - noise ratio scales as the square root of the number of instruments , and in this respect the results presented here should be considered as conservative .",
    "the maximum redshift depends on the mass of the imbh @xmath21 and on the mass of the companion which merges with the imbh ( @xmath98 ) , as well as on the sensitivity of the instrument .",
    "the expressions adopted to calculate @xmath96 ( for ligo , advanced ligo , lisa and et ) are summarized in appendix  a. as a model for the gravitational waveform , we consider the analytical phenomenological inspiral - merger - ringdown waveform approximant for non- spinning bhs in circular orbits derived by ajith et at .",
    "( 2008a ) .",
    "this waveform model together with the effective - one - body - numerical- relativity ( eobnr ) waveform family ( buonanno et al 2007 ) provides a prescription for the signal from the whole coalescence of binary systems . these waveform approximants have both been calibrated on full numerical relativity simulations for binaries for approximately equal mass systems , and yield signal - to - noise ratios that are consistent within @xmath99 .",
    "however , in this paper we will apply the waveforms on a much larger mass - ratio regime that extends up to @xmath100 .",
    "for this mass - ratio we still do not have reliable inspiral- merger - ring - down waveforms , and the phenomenological and eobnr approximants yield significantly different signal - to - noise ratios , that differ by a factor @xmath101 2@xmath310 depending on the mass ratio , with the phenomenological waveforms producing the larger signal - to - noise ratio , see _ e.g. _ fig .",
    "2 of gair et al ( 2009b ) . as the detection rate scales as the cube of the maximum distance at which a source can be detected ,",
    "the amplitude differences lead to rate uncertainties of a factor 10 or larger .",
    "furthermore if the bhs are ( rapidly ) spinning , the signal - to - noise ratio at which a source is observed can be significantly ( by a factor of @xmath102 , see _",
    "e.g. _ ajith et al . 2009 ) affected .",
    "however , the lack of astrophysical predictions for the likely spins of imbh binaries and the lack of full coalescence waveform approximants for generic spin magnitudes and geometries ( see however ajith et al .",
    "2009 ; pan et al .",
    "2009 ) prevent us from considering this possibly important physical effect .",
    "the resulting values of @xmath96 are shown in the upper panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] . in this fig .",
    "we consider mergers of the imbhs with two different compact objects , i.e. nss ( left - hand panel ) and stellar mass bhs ( right - hand panel ) and @xmath103 for the nss and the stellar mass bhs , respectively .",
    "furthermore , we assume that all the imbhs formed in ycs merge with a compact object .",
    "this assumption is justified by the strong mass segregation occurring during the runaway collapse ( pzm02 ) . the strong mass segregation and the concentration of the most massive stellar objects at the center of the cluster",
    "are confirmed by the observed mass distribution in the core of some galactic globular clusters ( where the mass distribution within the core is @xmath104 , with @xmath105 , see e.g. prior et al .",
    "1986 and monkman et al .",
    "these evidences , combined with the fact that hard binaries ( i.e. binaries with binding energy larger than the average kinetic energy of a cluster star ) tend to exchange , during three - body encounters , with the most massive possible companion ( see e.g. sigurdsson & phinney 1995 ) , suggest that most of imbhs formed in ycs merge with compact objects . ] .",
    "it is evident that there is a large difference between et and the other interferometers .",
    "in fact , while for et @xmath96 is always higher than 0.5 and 1 in the case of nss and stellar mass bhs , respectively , for advanced ligo @xmath106 and @xmath107 in the case of nss and stellar mass bhs , respectively . for the other interferometers",
    "@xmath96 is even smaller .",

    "the results obtained for ligo are not shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] , as they are orders of magnitude lower than those obtained for the other interferometers .",
    "in particular , the rate of imbh@xmath3ns ( imbh@xmath3bh ) mergers detectable with ligo is lower than @xmath110 ( @xmath111 ) per year , even in the most favorable case ( corresponding to @xmath93 ) .    fig .  [",

    "thus , et will be essential to assess the existence of imbhs in the local universe , and to distinguish among different theories of imbh formation .",

    "lisa ( dashed line , green on the web ) is more efficient in detecting massive ( @xmath116 ) imbhs merging with stellar mass bhs , due to its sensitivity to frequencies lower than 1 hz .",

    "lisa is very unlikely to observe any such system during the mission lifetime ( nominally set to 5 years ) , even for @xmath117 ; the detection rate is in fact @xmath118 .    in equation  ( [ eq : gw ] )",

    "our study shows that gws from imbhs are unlikely to be detected with first generation instruments , such as initial ligo , and even with lisa .",
    "advanced ligo offers instead the ability of observing these sources : a few merger events are expected to be detected by advanced ligo in 1-year integration .",
    "et is far the best interferometer projected up to now to study gws from imbhs : @xmath14 to @xmath137 ( @xmath138 to @xmath139 ) merger events of imbh@xmath3ns ( imbh@xmath3bh ) binaries might be detected in 1-year integration , according to the scenario of runaway collapse for imbh formation .",

    "however , our estimates are affected by large uncertainties ( more than a factor of 10 ) , because of our insufficient knowledge of masses and density of imbhs in the local universe . in particular",
    ", the fraction of imbhs per cluster @xmath140 is highly uncertain , as it is based only on the properties of the @xmath115 galactic ycs for which enough data are available .",
    "furthermore , @xmath18 adopted in this paper must be considered as an upper limit , as we are assuming that all the ycs which can undergo runaway collapse host an imbh , and that all the mass involved in the collapse ends up into the imbh .",
    "there are no evidences that the runaway collapse necessarily leads to the formation of an imbh ( pzm02 ) and there are hints that a large fraction of the mass is lost due to winds and/or to recoil ( gaburov , lombardi , portegies zwart 2010 ) .",
    "thus , there is no evidence that the mf of imbhs is the same as that of the host ycs .",
    "furthermore , even the density ( @xmath141 ) and the mf of ycs are uncertain : in order to derive such quantities , we extrapolated to massive ( @xmath7 ) ycs various relationships ( e.g. the slope of the mf ) derived by lada & lada ( 2003 ) for a sample of smaller clusters ( @xmath142 ) .",
    "finally , the models adopted to derive the instrumental range , and the corresponding @xmath47 , of the considered interferometers assume that the binary has zero eccentricity , the bhs are non - spinning and consider waveforms in a mass - ratio regime in which we still do not have reliable signal approximants .",
    "these are all factors that may significantly alter the results presented in this paper , in particular should ycs produce rapidly spinning and/or highly eccentric binaries .",
    "full inspiral - merger - ringdown gravitational - waveform families for ( generic ) binary systems with a mass ratio of the order of 1@xmath3to@xmath3100 are not available at present and we will be able to address this problem more rigorously only in the future .",
    "we also note that , although we have consistently taken into account the non - linear dynamics of the binary during the final merger by adopting full inspiral - merger - ringdown waveforms ( ajith et al 2008a ) , calibrated on actual numerical relativity simulations of the coalescence of bh binaries , we have however neglected in the merger rate estimates the possibility that the gw recoil ( see , e.g. baker et al .",
    "2008 ; lousto et al .",
    "2010 ) may impart to the binary a sufficient recoil velocity to eject it from the cluster .",
    "this would prevent future mergers , and in this respect , the results presented in this paper should be regarded as upper - limits , as gw recoil can only reduce the merger rate . on the other hand , assuming a typical escape velocity of 20 km s@xmath28 from the core of the host cluster ( see e.g. colpi et al .",
    "2003 ) , the gw recoil ( calculated according to baker et al .",
    "2008 ) should not be able to eject imbhs more massive than @xmath143 m@xmath34 ( @xmath144 m@xmath34 ) merging with a 10 m@xmath34 stellar mass bh ( with a 1.4 m@xmath34 ns ) .",
    "we notice , however , that the available expressions of the recoil velocity were obtained from simulations with mass ratio @xmath145 ( e.g baker et al .",
    "2008 ) , whereas we consider systems for which @xmath146 .",
    "no simulations have been carried out for such extreme mass ratio .",
    "furthermore , even in a pessimistic scenario , accounting for gw recoils should reduce the detection rate @xmath108 by at most a factor of a few , as in our model most of imbhs undergo @xmath134 merger events within the lifetime of the cluster .",
    "all these @xmath147 must be taken into account , when comparing the rates @xmath108 derived in this paper with the forthcoming observational data .",
    "yet our results will provide the basis for future studies exploring these issues further with improved data on the nature and frequency of ycs .",

    "<S> massive young clusters ( ycs ) are expected to host intermediate - mass black holes ( imbhs ) born via runaway collapse . </S>",

    "<S> in particular , as representative of different classes of instruments we consider initial and advanced ligo , the einstein gravitational - wave telescope ( et ) and the laser interferometer space antenna ( lisa ) . we find that imbh mergers are unlikely to be detected with instruments operating at the current sensitivity ( initial ligo ) . </S>",
    "<S> lisa detections are disfavored by the mass range of imbh@xmath3ns and imbh@xmath3bh binaries : less than one event per year is expected to be observed by such instrument . </S>",
    "<S> advanced ligo is expected to observe a few merger events involving imbh binaries in a 1-year long observation . </S>",
    "<S> advanced ligo is particularly suited for mergers of relatively light imbhs ( @xmath4 ) with stellar mass bhs . </S>",
    "<S> the number of mergers detectable with et is much larger : tens ( hundreds ) of imbh@xmath3ns ( imbh@xmath3bh ) mergers might be observed per year , according to the runaway collapse scenario for the formation of imbhs . </S>",
    "<S> we note that our results are affected by large uncertainties , produced by poor observational constraints on many of the physical processes involved in this study , such as the evolution of the yc density with redshift . </S>"
