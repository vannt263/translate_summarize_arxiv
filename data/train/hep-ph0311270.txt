    "in current collider experiments the hard interaction of two incoming beams results in the production of up to thousands of outgoing particles . so far , no evidence has been found that contradicts the belief that this process is described by the standard model ( sm ) for strong and electroweak phenomena .",
    "unfortunately , a full quantum - mechanical treatment is out of reach .",
    "there are two reasons for this apparent shortcoming : first of all , the sheer number of particles involved gives rise to a tremendous number of interfering contributions that grows factorially with the number of particles .",
    "furthermore , perturbation theory is not able to account for the transition of partons to hadrons .",
    "this failure of perturbation theory necessitates other methods .",
    "simulation tools called monte carlo programs or event generators have proved to be successful for a detailed description of multiparticle production . in this contribution",
    "we want to briefly illuminate the principles underlying such programs , and we would like to present some results of our new event generator  @xcite .",
    "sketch of a proton  proton collision from an event - generator point of view.,width=461 ]    for a brief discussion of the physics concepts underlying event generators , fig .",
    "[ ppscetch ] will be employed , in which a proton(anti)proton collision is sketched .",
    "the simulation of such an event has to be decomposed into different independent stages . to control this independence ,",
    "these stages are ordered according to the scales related to them .",
    "+ at the highest scale the signal process takes place leading eventually to the production of heavy and/or exotic states . in the figure , this is represented by the thick blob in the middle , in which two gluons fuse to produce a four - particle final state . for such signals one would like to use the full matrix element . within our event generator the module  @xcite takes care of the hard processes .",
    "it automatically creates all feynman diagrams , stores them as helicity amplitudes into library files and uses these libraries when the integral over the phase space of final - state particles , i.e.  the cross section , is evaluated through monte carlo methods . + as the event evolves down to lower energy scales , multiple emission of secondary particles must be described .",
    "the bulk of radiation activity is in the soft and/or collinear phase - space region , where the interference of subsequent emissions is of subleading logarithmic order only .",
    "the logarithms are in ratios of the actual parton - emission scale compared to a suitably defined harder scale , so that , for a description of the radiation pattern , these interferences can be safely neglected . hence multiple parton emission factorizes into chains of individual parton branchings . consequently , one obtains a simulation in terms of a parton shower .",
    "radiation off the initial state is more involved , but must result in a boost only , which , due to recoil effects , may also produce some net transverse momentum of the final state . in our event generator ,",
    "the parton showers are performed by the module  @xcite , which resums all leading logarithms and uses the invariant masses of the decaying partons to order subsequent emissions .",
    "an ordering in successive opening angles to properly account for quantum coherence effects is supplemented .",
    "a novel feature of our code is that , for the first time , an algorithm has been developed combining matrix elements and the parton shower by smoothly filling the parton - emission phase space and by respecting the logarithmic accuracy @xcite .",
    "+ some particles produced in the hard interaction might be unstable .",
    "if their mass is large enough , their decay might involve particles emitted with large energies or under large opening angles .",
    "such decays , again , are treated by using matrix elements and their subsequent parton showers . at high energies the possibly perturbative interaction of the beam remnants , sometimes also coined multiple parton interaction , comes into play .",
    "these interactions may develop their own parton showers . however , this phenomenon has the potential to severely obscure the interpretation of experimental data and , therefore , has to be simulated .",
    "these two aspects are currently being implemented .",
    "+ the gauge structure of qcd leads to a breakdown of perturbation theory at scales of the order of @xmath0 .",
    "so , the parton shower has to stop at such scales and its parton ensemble has to be translated into hadrons , i.e.  white objects . since confinement has not been completely understood yet , hadronization effects have to be modelled phenomenologically introducing parameters that have to be fitted to data .",
    "successful models , such as the string and the cluster model , rely on the fact that before the non - perturbative transition the parton shower has a definite colour structure approximation , where @xmath1 is the number of colours . employing a forced splitting of gluons into @xmath2 pairs ,",
    "the partons form a set of colour singlets , each of which contains a quark and an antiquark . in cluster models usually formulated in terms of formation and decay of clusters these singlets",
    "are interpreted as primordial hadron resonances with indefinite mass decaying into primary , specified hadrons . ] .",
    "our code incorporates a newly developed cluster - hadronization model and an interface to the well - known lund string fragmentation , allowing for systematic studies of model uncertainties .",
    "_ 3.1results obtained with _ : _ the parton level _ + here , we will highlight the abilities of  in calculating cross sections for processes within and beyond the sm .",
    "there is a plethora of reasons to search for new physics , e.g. : + the sm has two intrinsic problems , the hierarchy and the naturalness problem , which are addressed to the question why the scale of electroweak symmetry breaking and the planck scale , where strong gravitational effects are expected , are separated by a wide desert . to understand this hierarchy self - interactions of the ( scalar ) higgs boson",
    "are considered . using a cut - off procedure for the ultraviolet divergencies with the cut - off given by the highest scale in the sm , the planck mass",
    ", one immediately realizes that the counter term for the higgs mass has to be quadratic in the planck mass . in reality , however , unitarity of @xmath3 scattering forces the higgs mass to be lower than roughly @xmath4 tev .",
    "the difference of roughly seventeen orders of magnitude requiring an extreme fine - tuning ( naturalness problem ) lets the sm seem somewhat inconsistent . + on top of this intrinsic problems , gravitation is not incorporated by the sm .",
    "assuming the existence of a `` theory of everything '' , one may conclude that the sm is incomplete and constitutes only an `` effective theory '' .",
    "+ however , the hope to successfully search for new physics depends on our capabilities to understand and subtract the `` old '' physics , i.e.  the sm .",
    "thus it is crucial for any event generator to provide an optimal simulation of sm effects . + _",
    "3.1.1multi - particle production in the sm : six - fermion final states _",
    "+ despite that six - fermion final states constitute significant backgrounds to signatures for new physics , they provide unique opportunities to study some of the most interesting aspects of the sm in great detail .",
    "the most important channels are the production and decay of pairs of top quarks and  if existent  of one or more higgs bosons , the latter allowing to test the structure of the higgs potential .",
    "if no evidence for a higgs boson was found at the lhc , the study of quartic gauge - boson couplings is mandatory in order to understand alternative scenarios of electroweak symmetry breaking . to test these complex calculations involving up to @xmath5 feynman diagrams , tuned comparisons of different generators are required .",
