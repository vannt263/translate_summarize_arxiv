    "transient lunar phenomena ( tlps or ltps ) are defined for the purposes of this investigation as localized ( smaller than a few hundred km across ) , transient ( up to a few hours duration , and probably longer than typical impact events - less than 1s to a few seconds ) , and presumably confined to processes near the lunar surface .",
    "how such events are manifest is summarized by cameron ( 1972 ) . in paper i ( crotts 2008 ; see also crotts 2009 ) we study the systematic behavior ( especially the spatial distribution ) of tlp observations - particularly their significant correlations with tracers of lunar surface outgassing , and we are thereby motivated to understand if this correlation is directly causal .",
    "numerous works have offered hypotheses for the physical cause of tlps ( mills 1970 , garlick et al .  1972a , b , geake & mills 1977 , cameron 1977 , middlehurst 1977 , hughes 1980 , robinson 1986 , zito 1989 , carbognani 2004 , davis 2009 ) , but we present a methodical examination of the influence of outgassing , exploring quantitatively how outgassing might produce tlps .",
    "furthermore , it seems likely that outgassing activity is concentrated in several areas , which leads one to ask how outgassing might interact with and alter the regolith presumably overlying the source of gas .",
    "reviews of similar processes exist but few integrate apollo - era data e.g. , stern ( 1999 ) , mukherjee ( 1975 ) , friesen ( 1975 ) .",
    "as the final version of this paper approached completion , several papers were published regarding the confirmed discovery of hydration of the lunar regolith .",
    "fortunately , we deal here with the special effects of water on lunar regolith and find that many of our predictions are borne out in the recently announced data",
    ". we will deal with this explicitly in  5 .",
    "several experiments from apollo indicate that gas is produced in the vicinity of the moon , even though these experiments disagree on the total rate : 1 ) lace ( lunar atmosphere composition experiment on _ apollo 17 _ ) , @xmath10.1 g s@xmath2 over the entire lunar surface ( hodges et al .  1973 , 1974 ) ; 2 ) side ( suprathermal ion detector experiment on _ apollo 12 , 14 , 15 _ ) , @xmath17 g s@xmath2 ( vondrak et al .  1974 ) ;",
    "3 ) ccge ( cold cathode gauge experiment on _ apollo 12 , 14 , 15 _ ) , @xmath360 g s@xmath2 ( hodges et al .  1972 ) .",
    "these measurements not only vary by more than two orders of magnitude but also in assayed species and detection methods .",
    "lace results here applies only to neutral @xmath4ar , @xmath5ar and @xmath6ne . by mass",
    "@xmath4ar predominates .",
    "side results all relate to ions , and perhaps include a large contribution from molecular species ( vondrak et al .  1974 ) .",
    "ccge measures only neutral species , not easily distinguishing between them .",
    "the lace data indicate @xmath4ar episodic outgassing on timescales of a few months or less ( hodges & hoffman 1975 ) , but resolving this into faster timescales is more ambiguous . in this discussion",
    "we adopt the intermediate rate ( side ) , about 200 tonne y@xmath2 for the total production of gas , of all species , ionized or neutral .",
    "the lace is the only instrument to provide compositional ratios , which also include additional , rarer components in detail",
    ". we will use these ratios and in some cases normalize them against the side total .",
    "much of the following discussion is only marginally sensitive to the actual composition of the gas . for many components of molecular gas at the lunar surface ,",
    "however , there is a significant possible contribution from cometary or meteoritic impacts , and a lesser amount from solar wind / regolith interactions .",
    "the influx of molecular gas from comets and meteorites are variously estimated , usually in the range of tonnes or tens of tonnes per year over the lunar surface ( see anders et al .",
    "1973 , morgan & shemansky 1991 ) .",
    "cometary contributions may be sporadically greater ( thomas 1974 ) . except for h@xmath7 , solar wind interactions ( mukhergee 1975 )",
    "provide only a small fraction of the molecular concentration seen at the surface ( which are only marginally detected : hoffman & hodges 1975 ) . there is still uncertainty as to what fraction of this gas is endogenous .",
    "current data do not succeed in resolving these questions , but we will return to consider them later in the context of gas seepage / regolith interactions .",
    "in this paper we consider various effects of outgassing through the regolith , and find the most interesting simple effect occurs when the flow is high enough to cause disruption of the regolith by an explosion to relieve pressure (  2 ) , which we compare to fluidization .",
    "another interesting effect occurs when the gas undergoes a phase change while passing through the regolith (  3 ) , which seems to apply only to water vapor .",
    "this leads primarily to the prediction of the likely production of subsurface ice , particularly in the vicinity of the lunar poles .",
    "these effects suggest a variety of observational / experimental approaches , which we summarize in  4 . in  5 we discuss the general implications of these findings , with specific suggestions as to how these might guide further exploration , particularly in respect to contamination by anthropogenic volatiles .",
    "we also discuss the relevance of the predictions in  4 to very recent discoveries regarding lunar regolith hydration .",
    "first , let us make a few basic points about outgassing and the regolith .",
    "one can easily picture several modes in which outgassing volatiles might interact with regolith on the way to the surface .",
    "these modes will come into play with increasing gas flow rate and/or decreasing regolith depth , and we simply list them with mneumonic labels along with descriptions :    \\1 ) choke : complete blockage below the regolith , meaning that any chemistry or phase changes occur within the bedrock / megaregolith ;    \\2 ) seep : gas is introduced slowly into the regolith , essentially molecule by molecule ;    \\3 ) bubble : gas is introduced in macroscopic packets which stir or otherwise rearrange the regolith ( such as `` fluidization '' e.g. , mills 1969 ) ;    \\4 ) gulp : gas is introduced in packets whose adiabatic expansion deposits kinetic energy into regolith and cools the gas , which therefore might even undergo a phase change ;    \\5 ) explode : gas is deposited in packets at base of the regolith leading to an explosion ; and    \\6 ) jet : gas simply flows into the vacuum at nearly sound speed with little entrained material .",
    "while the intermediate processes might prove interesting , the extreme cases are probably more likely to be in effect and will receive more of our attention .",
    "in fact choking behavior might lead to explosions or geysers , when the pressure blockage is released . since these latter two processes involve primarily simple hydrodynamics ( and eventually , newtonian ballistics )",
    ", we will consider them first , and how they might relate to tlps .",
    "if outgassing occurs at a rate faster than simple percolation can sustain , and where regolith obstructs its path to the surface , the accumulation of the gas will disrupt and cause bulk motion of the intervening regolith .",
    "the outgassing can lift the regolith into a cloud in the temporary atmosphere caused by the event .",
    "the presence of such a cloud has the potential to increase the local albedo from the perspective of an outside observer due to increased reflectivity and possible mie scattering of underlying regolith .",
    "additionally , volatiles buried in the regolith layer could become entrained in this gas further changing the reflective properties of such a cloud .",
    "garlick et al .",
    "( 1972b ) describe fluidization of lunar regolith , in which dust is displaced only temporarily and/or over small distances compared to ballistic trajectories , but we will assume that we are dealing with more rapid changes .",
    "let us construct a simple model of explosive outgassing through the lunar surface .",
    "for such an event to occur , we assume a pocket of pressurized gas builds at the base of the regolith , where it is delivered by transport through the crust / megaregolith presumably via channels or cracks , or at least faster diffusion from below . given a sufficient flow rate ( which we consider below ) , gas will accumulate at this depth until its internal pressure is sufficient to displace the overlying regolith mass , or some event releases downward pressure e.g. , impact , moonquake , incipient fluidization , puncturing a seal , etc .",
    "we can estimate the minimal amount of gas alone required to cause explosive outgassing by assuming that the internal energy of the buried gas is equal to the total energy necessary to raise the overlying cone of regolith to the surface .",
    "this `` minimal tlp '' is the smallest outgassing event likely to produce potentially observable disruption at a new site , although re - eruption through thinned regolith will require less gas .",
    "we consider the outgassing event occurring in two parts illustrated in figure 1 .",
    "initially , the gas bubble explodes upward propelling regolith with it until it reaches the level of the surface ; we assume that the plug consists of a cone of regolith within 45@xmath8 of the axis passing from the gas reservoir to the surface , normal to the surface . through this process",
    "the gas and regolith become mixed , and we assume they now populate a uniform hemispherical distribution of radius @xmath9  m on the surface . at this point , the gas expands into the vacuum and drags the entrained regolith outward until the dust cloud reaches a sufficiently small density to allow the gas to escape freely into the vacuum and the regolith to fall eventually to the surface .",
    "we consider this to be the `` minimal tlp '' for explosive outgassing , as there is no additional reservoir that is liberated by the event beyond the minimum to puncture the regolith .",
    "one could also imagine triggering the event by other means , many of which might release larger amounts of gas other than that poised at hydrodynamical instability .    for the initial conditions of the first phase of our model , we assume the gas builds up at the base of the regolith layer at a depth of 15  m ( for more discussion of this depth , see  3 ) .",
    "we set the bulk density of the regolith at @xmath10 g @xmath11 ( mckay et al .",
    "1991 ) , thereby setting the pressure at this depth at 0.45 atm .",
    "because of the violent nature of an explosive outgassing , we assume that the cone of dust displaced will be 45@xmath8 from vertical ( comparable to the angle of repose for a disturbed slope of this depth : carrier , olhoeft & mendell 1991 ) .",
    "the mass of overlying regolith defined by this cone is @xmath12 kg .    in order to determine the mass of gas required to displace this regolith cone , we equate the internal energy of this gas bubble with the potential energy ( @xmath13 , where @xmath14 m s@xmath15 ) required to lift the cone of regolith a height @xmath16  m to the surface , requiring 47,000 moles of gas .",
    "much of the gas found in outgassing events consists of @xmath17he , @xmath5ar and @xmath4ar ( see  1 ) , so we assume a mean molar mass for the model gas of @xmath18 g mol@xmath2 , hence 940  kg of gas is necessary to create an explosive outgassing event .",
    "the temperature at this depth is @xmath19c ( see  3 ) , consequently implying an overall volume of gas of 2400 m@xmath20 or a sphere 8.3 m in radius . what flow rate is needed to support this ?    using fick s diffusion law , @xmath21 , where the gas number density @xmath22 @xmath11 is taken from above , and drops to zero through 15  m of regolith in @xmath23 .",
    "the diffusivity @xmath24 is 7.7 and 2.3 cm@xmath0 s@xmath2 for he and ar , respectively , in the knudsen flow regime for basaltic lunar soil simulant ( martin et al .",
    "1973 , where @xmath26 is the absolute temperature .",
    "the sticking time of the gas molecules , or heat of absorption , becomes significant if the gas is more reactive or the temperature is reduced .",
    "unfortunately we find no such numbers for real regolith , although we discuss realistic diffusivities for other gases below . ] ) , so we adopt @xmath27 cm@xmath0 s@xmath2 for our assumed he / ar mixture .",
    "( for any other gas mixture of this molecular weight , @xmath24 would likely be smaller ; below we also show that @xmath24 tends to be lower for real regolith . )   over the area of the gas reservoir , this implies a mass leakage rate of 2.8  g  s@xmath2 , or @xmath140% of the total side rate . with the particular approximations made about the regolith diffusivity ,",
    "this is probably near the upper limit on the leakage rate . at the surface of the regolith",
    ", this flow is spread to a particle flux of only @xmath28 cm@xmath15 , which presumably causes no directly observable optical effects .",
    "the characteristic time to drain ( or presumably fill ) the reservoir is 4 d.    the second phase of the simulation models the evolution of dust shells and expanding gas with a spherically symmetric 1d simulation centered on the explosion point .",
    "the steps of the model include : 1 ) the regolith is divided into over 600 bins of different mean particle size .",
    "these bins are logarithmically spaced over the range @xmath30  mm to @xmath31 m according to the regolith particle size distribution from sample 72141,1 ( from mckay et al .",
    "the published distribution for sample 72141,1 only goes to 2@xmath32 m , but other sources ( basu & molinaroli 2001 ) indicate a component extending below 2@xmath32 m , so we extend our size distribution linearly from 2@xmath32 m to 0@xmath32 m .",
    "furthermore , we assume the regolith particles are spherical in shape and do not change in shape or size during the explosion ; 2 ) to represent the volume of regolith uniformly entrained in the gas , we create a series of 1000 concentric hemispherical shells for each of the different particle size bins ( i.e. , roughly 600,000 shells ) .",
    "each of these shells is now independent of each other and totally dependent on the gas - pressure and gravity for motion ; 3 ) we further assume that each regolith shell remains hemispherical throughout the simulation .",
    "explicitly , we trace the dynamics of each shell with a point particle , located initially 45 degrees up the side of the shell ; 4 ) we calculate the outward pressure of the gas exerted on the dust shells .",
    "the force from this pressure is distributed among different shells of regolith particle size weighted by the total surface area of the grains in each shell .",
    "we calculate each shell s outward acceleration and consequently integrate their equations of motion using a timestep @xmath33 s ; 5 ) we calculate the diffusivity of each radial shell ( in terms of the ability of the gas to move through it ) by dividing the total surface area of all dust grains in a shell by the surface area of the shell itself ( assuming grains surfaces to be spherical ) ; 6 ) starting with the largest radius shell , we sum the opacities of each shell until we reach a gas diffusive opacity of unity .",
    "gas interior to this radius can not `` see '' out of the external regolith shells and therefore remains trapped .",
    "gas outside of this unit opacity shell is assumed to escape and is dropped from the force expansion calculation .",
    "dust shells outside the unit opacity radius are now assumed to be ballistic ; 7 ) we monitor the trajectory of each dust shell ( represented by its initially 45@xmath8 particle ) until it drops to an elevation angle of 30@xmath8 ( when most of the gas is expanding above the particle ) , at which time this particle shell is no longer supported by the gas , and is dropped from the gas - opacity calculation ; 8) an optical opacity calculation is made to determine the ability of an observer to see the lunar surface when looking down on the cloud .",
    "we calculate the downward optical opacity ( such as from earth ) by dividing the total surface area of the dust grains in a shell by the surface area of the shell as seen from above ( @xmath34 ) . starting with the outmost dust shell , we sum downward - view optical opacities until we reach optical depth @xmath35 and @xmath36 to keep track the evolution of this cloud s appearance as seen from a distance ; 9 ) we return to step # 4 above and iterate another timestep @xmath37 , integrating again the equations of motion .",
    "we continue this algorithm until all gas is lost and all regolith has fallen to the ground .",
    "finally , when all dust has fallen out , we calculate where the regolith ejecta have been deposited . because we re representing each shell as a single point for the purposes of the equations of motion calculations , we want to do more than simply plot the location of each shell - particle on the ground to determine the deposition profile of ejected regolith .",
    "thus we create a template function for the deposition of a ballistic explosion of a single spherical shell of material . by applying this template to each shell - particle s final resting location ,",
    "we better approximate the total deposition of material from that shell .",
    "we then sum all of the material from the @xmath38 shells to determine the overall dust ejecta deposition profile .",
    "there are obvious caveats to this calculation .",
    "undoubtably the release mechanism is more complex than that adopted here , but this release mode is sufficiently simple to be modeled .",
    "secondly , the diffusion constant , and therefore the minimal flow rate , might be overestimated due to the significant ( but still largely unknown ) decrease in regolith porosity with increasing depth on the scale of meters ( carrier et al .",
    "1991 ) , plus the liklihood that simulants used have larger particles and greater porosity than typical regolith .",
    "lastly , the regolith depth of 15 meters might be an overestimate for some of these regions , which are among the volcanically youngest and/or freshest impacts on the lunar surface .",
    "this exception does not apply to plato and its active highland vicinity , however , and aristarchus is thickly covered with apparent pyroclastic deposits which likely have different but unknown depths and diffusion characteristics .",
    "we find results for this `` minimal tlp '' numerical model of explosive outgassing through the lunar regolith interesting in terms of the reported properties of tlps .",
    "figure 2 shows the evolution of the model explosion with time , as might be seen from an observer above , in terms of the optical depth @xmath39 and @xmath40 profiles of the model event , where @xmath39 is a rough measure of order unity changes in the appearance of the surface features , whereas @xmath40 is close to the threshold of the human eye for changes in contrast , which is how many tlps are detected ( especially the many without noticable color change ) . in both cases",
    "the cloud at the particular @xmath41 threshold value expands rapidly to a nearly fixed physical extent , and maintains this size until sufficient dust has fallen out so as to prevent any part of the cloud from obscuring the surface to this degree .",
    "easily - seen effects on features ( @xmath39 ) lasts for 50  s and extends over a radius of 2 km , corresponding to 2 arcsec in diameter , resolvable by a typical optical telescope but often only marginally so .",
    "in contrast , the marginally detectable @xmath40 feature extends over 14 km diameter ( 7.5 arcsec ) , lasting for 90 s , but is easily resolved .",
    "this model `` minimal tlp '' is an interesting match to the reported behavior of non - instantaneous ( not @xmath42 s ) tlps : about 7% of duration 90  s or less , and half lasting under about 1300  s. certainly there should be selection biases suppressing reports of shorter events .",
    "most tlp reports land in an envelope between about two minutes and one hour duration , and this model event lands at the lower edge of this envelope .",
    "furthermore , most tlps , particularly shorter ones , are marginally resolved spatially , as would be the easily - detectable component of the model event .",
    "this correspondence also seems interesting , given the simplicity of our model and the state of ignorance regarding relevant parameters",
    ".    how might this dust cloud actually affect the appearance of the lunar surface ?",
    "first , the cloud should cast a shadow that will be even more observable than simple surface obscuration , blocking the solar flux from an area comparable to the @xmath39 region and visible in many orientations .",
    "experiments with agitation of lunar regolith ( garlick et al .",
    "1972b ) show that the reflectance of dust is nearly always increased under fluidization , typically by about 20% and often by about 50% depending on the particular orientation of the observer versus the light source and the cloud .",
    "similar results should be expected here for our simulated regolith cloud .",
    "these increases in lunar surface brightness would be easily observable spread over the many square kilometers indicated by our model .    furthermore , because the sub - micron particle sizes dominate the outer regions of the cloud , it seems reasonable to expect mie - scattering effects in these regions with both blue and red clouds expected from different sun - earth - moon orientations .",
    "figure 3 shows the typical fall - out time of dust particles as a function of size .",
    "particles larger than @xmath130 @xmath32 m all fall out within the first few seconds , whereas after a few tens of seconds , particles are differentiated for radii capable of contributing to wavelength - dedendent scattering . later in the event",
    "we should expect significant color shifts ( albeit not order - unity changes in flux ratios ) .",
    "the larger dynamical effects in the explosion cloud change rapidly over the event .",
    "half of the initially entrained gas is lost from the cloud in the first 3 s , and 99% is lost in the first 15  s. throughout the observable event , the remaining gas stays in good thermal contact with the dust , which acts as an isothermal reservoir .",
    "gas escaping the outer portions of the dust cloud does so at nearly the sound speed ( @xmath43 m s@xmath2 ) , and the outer shells of dust also contain particles accelerated to similar velocities .",
    "gas escaping after about 3 s does so from the interior of the cloud in parcels of gas with velocities decreasing roughly inversely with time .",
    "one observable consequence of this is the expectation that much of the gas and significant dust will be launched to altitudes up to about 50 km , where it may be observed and might affect spacecraft in lunar orbit .",
    "the longterm effects of the explosion are largely contained in the initial explosion crater ( nominally 14 m in radius ) , although exactly how the ejecta ultimately settle in the crater is not handled by the model . at larger",
    "radii the model is likely to be more reliable ; figure 4 shows how much dust ejecta is deposited by the explosion as a function of radius . beyond the initial crater , the surface density of deposited material varies roughly as @xmath44 , so it converges rapidly with distance . inside a radius of @xmath45 m ,",
    "the covering factor of ejecta is greater than unity ; beyond this one expects coverage to be patchy .",
    "this assumes that the crater explosion is symmetric and produces few `` rays . ''",
    "the explosion can change the reflectivity by excavating fresh material .",
    "this would be evidenced by a @xmath110% drop in reflectance at wavelength @xmath46  nm caused by surface fe@xmath47 states in pyroxene and similar minerals ( adams 1974 , charette et al .",
    "likewise there is an increase in reflectivity in bluer optical bands ( buratti et al .",
    "2000 ) over hundreds of nm",
    ". even though these photometric effects are compositionally dependent , we are interested only in differential effects : gradients over small distances and rapid changes in time .",
    "the lifetime of even these effects at 300 m radius is short , however , due to impact `` gardening '' turnover .",
    "the half - life of the ejecta layer at 300 m radius is only of order 1000  y ( from gault et al .  1974 ) , and shorter at large radius ( unless multiple explosions accumulate multiple layers of ejecta ) . at 30  m radius",
    "the half - life is of order 10@xmath48  y. from maturation studies of the 950  nm feature ( lucey et al .",
    "2000 , 1998 ) , even at 30  m , overturn predominates over optical maturation rates ( over hundreds of my ) .    the scale of outgassing in this model event , both in terms of gas release ( @xmath49  1  tonne ) and timescale ( @xmath49  4  d ) , are consistent with the total gas output and temporal granularity of outgassing seen in @xmath4ar , a dominant lunar atmospheric component .",
    "the fact that this model also recovers the scale of many features actually reported for tlps lends credence to the idea that outgassing and tlps might be related to each other causally in this way , as well as circumstantially via the rn@xmath50 episodes and tlp geographical correlation ( paper i ) .",
    "how often such an explosive puncturing of the regolith layer by outgassing should occur is unknown , due to the uncertainty in the magnitude and distribution of endogenous gas flow to the surface , and to some degree how the regolith reacts in detail to large gas flows propagating to the surface . also , a new crater caused by explosive outgassing will change the regolith depth , its temperature structure , and eventually its diffusivity .",
    "we will not attempt here to follow the next steps in the evolution of an outgassing `` fumerole '' in this way , but are inspired to understand how regolith , its temperature profile , and gas interact , as in the next section .",
    "furthermore , such outgassing might happen on much larger scales , or might over time affect a larger area .",
    "indeed , such a hypothesis is offered for the scoured region of depleted regolith forming the ina d feature and may extend to other regions around imbrium ( schultz et al .",
    "2006 ) .",
    "our results here and in paper i bear directly on the argument of vondrak ( 1977 ) that tlps as outgassing events are inconsistent with side episodic outgassing results .",
    "the detection limits from alsep sites _ apollo 12 , 14 _ and _ 15 _ correspond to 16 - 71 tonne of gas per event at common tlp sites , particularly aristarchus .",
    "( vondrak states that given the uncertainties in gas transportation , these levels are uncertain at the level of an order of magnitude . )",
    "our `` minimal tlp event '' described above is 20 - 80 times less massive than this , however , and still visible from earth .",
    "it seems implausible that a spectrum of such events would never exceed the side limit , but it is not so obvious such a large event would occur in the seven - year alsep operations interval .",
    "also , this side limit interpretation rests crucially on alphonsus ( and ross d ) as prime tlp sites , both features which are rejected by our robust geographical tlp sieve in paper i.      dust elutriation or particle segregation in a cloud agitated by a low - density gas , occurring in this model , could potentially generate large electrostatic voltages , perhaps relating to tlps ( mills 1970 ) .",
    "luminous discharges are generated in terrestrial volcanic dust clouds ( anderson et al .",
    "1965 , thomas et al .  2007 ) .",
    "above we see dust particles remain suspended in a gas of number density @xmath51 to @xmath52 @xmath11 on scales of several tenths of a km to several km , a plausible venue for large voltages . in the heterogeneous lunar regolith , several predominant minerals with differing particle size may segregate under gas flow suspension and acceleration . assuming a typical particle size of @xmath53 m , and typical work function differences for particles of even well - defined compositions is problematic due to surface effects such as solar - wind / micrometeoritic weathering and exposed surface fe@xmath47 states .",
    "the following analysis suffices for two particles of different conducting composition ; a similar result arises via triboelectric interaction of two different dielectrics although the details are less understood .",
    "disturbed dust is readily charged for long periods in the lunar surface environment ( stubbs , vondrak & farell 2005 ) . ] of @xmath54 ev , two particles exchange charge upon contact until the equivalent of @xmath550.25v is maintained , amounting to @xmath56 coul = 1700 e@xmath57 . when these particles separate to distance @xmath58 , their mutual capacitance becomes @xmath59 . for @xmath60",

    "similar optimal @xmath63 are found for molecules , with minimum voltages a few times higher e.g. , 420v at @xmath66 cm@xmath15 for co@xmath7 , 414v for h@xmath7s , 410v for ch@xmath67 , and @xmath63 for other molecules @xmath68 cm@xmath15 .",

    "if this applies to tlps , the incidence of intense red emission in some tlp reports ( cameron 1978 ) argues for another gas . to 13 ( mag arcsec@xmath15 ) in v , compared to 3.4 at full moon , so visible sources could be faint .",

    "the initial gas density at the surface from a minimal tlp is @xmath70 @xmath11 , so initially the optimal @xmath63 for coronal discharge is on cm scales ( versus the initial outburst over tens of meters ) .",
    "as the tlp expands to 1 km radius , @xmath71 drops to @xmath72 @xmath11 , so the optimal @xmath63 holds over the scale of the entire cloud , likely the most favorable condition for coronal discharge .",

    "this pressure estimate is likely a lower limit . below this pressure simple gas percolation likely predominates .",
    "what processes occur during `` simple '' percolation ? were it not for phase changes of venting gas within the regolith , the composition of the gas might be a weak consideration in this paper ( except for perhaps the molecular / atomic mass ) , and temperature would likely only affect seepage as @xmath80 in the diffusivity .",
    "water plays a special role in this study ( separate from concerns regarding resource exploitation or astrobiology ) , in that it is the only common substance encountering its triple point temperature in passing through the regolith , at least in many locations . in this case water",
    "might not contribute to overpressure underneath the regolith leading to explosive outgassing .",
    "this would also imply that even relatively small volatile flows containing water would tend to freeze in place and remain until after the flow stops . for water",

    ", the entire regolith is below the triple point temperature and is too deep to be affected significantly by variations in heating over monthly timescales .",
    "this is an interesting depth , since in many areas the regolith is not quite this deep , as small as under a few meters near lichtenberg ( schultz & spudis 1983 ) and at the surveyor 1 site near flamsteed ( shoemaker & morris 1970 ) to depths at apollo sites ( summarized by mckay et al .",
    "1991 ) near the @xmath82c depths calculated above , up to probably 20 m or more in the highlands , and 40  m deep north of the south pole - aitken basin ( bart & melosh 2005 ) .",
    "presumably , the fractured megaregolith supporting the regolith likely does not contain as many small particles useful for retaining water ice , as we detail below , but it may accumulate ice temporarily .",
    "recent heat flow analyses ( saito et al .",

    "assuming that particle distributions are self - similar in size distribution ( constant porosity ) , for random - walk diffusion out of a volume element @xmath85 , the diffusion time step presumably scales with the particle size @xmath86 , so the diffusion time @xmath87 . for particles of the same density ,",
    "therefore , one should compute the diffusion time by taking a @xmath88-weighted average of particle sizes counted by mass , @xmath89 . this same moment of the distribution is relevant in  2",

    "we compare this to experimental simulations , a reasonably close analogy being the sublimation of a slab of ice buried up to 0.2 m below a medium of simulant jsc mars-1 ( allen et al .",

    "2007 ) , close to lunar regolith conditions .",
    "this corresponds to the lifetime of 800  y for a 1 m thick ice layer covered by 1  m of regolith .",
    "the porosity of jsc mars-1 is 44 - 54% , depending on compactification whereas lunar soil has @xmath149% at the surface , perhaps 40% at a depth of 60 cm , and slightly lower at large depths ( carrier et al .",

    "this begs the question of the preferred depth for an ice layer to form .",
    "the regolith porosity decreases significantly between zero and 1  m depth ( carrier et al .",
    "1991 ) which argues weakly for preferred formation at greater depth . at 30  m depth or more",
    ", the force of overburden tends to close off porosity .",
    "the current best limit on water abundance is from the sunrise terminator abundances from lace , which produces a number ratio of h@xmath7o/@xmath4ar with a central value of 0.014 ( with @xmath100 limits of 0 - 0.04 ) .",
    "this potentially indicates an actual h@xmath7o/@xmath4ar outgassing rate ratio up to 5 times higher ( hoffman & hodges 1975 ) .",

    "the disagreement between side and lace is a major source of uncertainty ( perhaps due to the neutral / ionized component ambiguity ) .",
    "we discuss below that at earlier times the subsurface temperature was likely lower , but let us consider now the situation in which a source arises into pre - established regolith in recent times .",

    "if this ice patch were 1  m thick , for example , the ice would need to be replenished every 4000  y.    of course , this is a simple model and many complications could enter .",
    "we consider briefly the effects of latitude , change in lunar surface temperature over geological time , and the effects of aqueous chemistry on the regolith .",

    "several important modifications of the scenario above are relevant .    the current heat flow from the lunar interior , @xmath126 w m@xmath15 ( langseth et al .",
    "1972 , 1973 ) , is only a @xmath127 part of the solar constant , so it affects the temperature near the lunar surface at the level of only @xmath128 millidegree .",
    "there were times in the past , however , when interior heating likely pushed the temperature near the surface over @xmath82c .",

    "after this the @xmath82c depth receded into the regolith , while the regolith layer was also growing .",

    "since the the thickness of regolith after 3 gy ago grows at only about 1 m per gy ( quaide & oberbeck 1975 ) , within the maria the @xmath82c depth sinks into bedrock / fractured zone .",
    "whatever interaction and modification might be involved between the regolith and volatiles will proceed inwards , leaving previous epochs effects between the surface vacuum and the @xmath82c layer now at @xmath131  m.      another issue to consider is possible regolithic chemical reactions with outgassing volatiles , especially over prolonged geological timescales . the key issue is the possible presence of water vapor , and perhaps so@xmath7 .",
    "there is little experimental work on the aqueous chemistry of lunar regolith ( which will vary due to spatial inhomogeneity ) .",
    "dissolution of lunar fines by water vapor is greatly accelerated in the absence of other gases such as o@xmath7 and n@xmath7 ( gammage & holmes 1975 ) and appears to proceed by etching the numerous damage tracks from solar - wind particles .",
    "this process acts in a way to spread material from existing grains without reducing their size ( which would otherwise tend to increase porosity ) .",
    "liquid water is more effective than vapor , not surprisingly , and ice tends to establish a pseudo - liquid layer on its surface .",

    "it is not clear that fe(oh)@xmath7 would oxidize to more insoluble feo(oh ) , but any free electrons would tend to encourage this .",
    "it seems that the result would be generally alkaline . since feldspar appears to be a major component in some outgassing regions e.g. , aristarchus ( mcewen et al .",
    "1994 ) , one should also anticipate the production of clays .",
    "this is not accounting for water reactions with other volatiles e.g. , ammonia , which has been observed as a trace gas ( hoffman & hodges 1975 ) perhaps in part endogenous to the moon , and which near @xmath82c can dissolve in water at nearly unit mass ratio ( also to make an alkaline solution ) .",

    "some possible products have very low hardness and not high ductility . some of these products expand but will likely fill the interstitial volume with material , which will raise its density and make it more homogeneous .",

    "the extent to which ordinary mixes such as portland cement lose water into the vacuum depend on their content of expansive admixture ( kanamori 1995 ) .",
    "portland cement mixes show little evidence of loss of compressional strength in a vacuum ( cullingford & keller 1992 ) .    we need to think in terms of",
    "possibly cemented slabs in some vicinities , and need to consider the effects of cracks or impacts into this concrete medium .",
    "this is probably not a dominant process , since the overturn timescale to depths even as shallow as 1  m is more than 1  gy ( gault et al .",
    "1974 , quaide & oberbeck 1975 ) , whereas we discuss processes at @xmath115  m or more .",
    "craters 75  m in diameter will permanently excavate to a 15  m depth ( e.g. , collins 2001 , and ignoring the effects of fractures and breccia formation ) , and are formed at a rate of about 1 gy@xmath2 km@xmath15 ( extending neukum et al .  [ 2001 ] with a shoemaker number / size power - law index 2.9 ) .",
    "this will affect some of the areal scales discussed above , but not all .",
    "we speculate that vapor or solution flow might tend to deliver ice and/or solute to these areas and eventually act to isolate the system from the vacuum . finally , we note above that over geological timescales this ice layer will tend to sink slowly into the regolith , at a rate of order 1  m gy@xmath2 , setting up a situation where any relatively impermeable concrete zone will tend to isolate volatiles from the vacuum . in this case",
    "volatile leakage will tend to be reduced to a peripheral region around the ice patch . assuming that volatiles leak out through the entire 15  m thickness of regolith at the patch boundary , the 125  m diameter patch area for @xmath137 from above corresponds to a peripheral zone expected from a 520  m diameter patch .",

    "how much water might reasonably be expected to outgas at these sites ? the earliest analyses of apollo samples argued for extreme scarcity of water and other volatiles ( anders 1970 , charles , hewitt & wones 1971 , epstein & taylor 1972 ) . on the earth , water is the predominant juvenile outgassing component ( gerlach & graeber 1985 , rubey 1964 ) , whereas even the highest water concentrations discussed below ( saal et al .",

    "so@xmath7 is the predominate volatile detected in deep - interior fire fountain glasses , a key factor in deciding what to pursue as a volcanic tracer .",

    "nasa and hopefully other space agencies have no plans to use these on lunar missions .    despite the hypotheses and methods outlined above , there is great doubt regarding the nature of lunar outgassing .",
    "water is of obvious and diverse interest , and co@xmath7 and co , while missing as apparent constituents , are interesting as drivers for fire fountain eruption .",

    "significantly , many years to come monitoring for optical transients will be best done from earth s surface , even considering the important contributions that will be made by lunar spacecraft probes in the near future . however , these spacecraft will be very useful in evaluating the nature of transient events in synergy with ground - based monitoring . given the likely behavior of outgassing events , it is unclear that in - situ efforts alone will necessarily isolate their sources within significant winnowing of the field by remote sensing .",
    "early placement of capable mass spectrometers of the lunar surface , however , might prove very useful in refining our knowledge of outgassing composition , in particular a dominant component that could be used as a tracer to monitor outgassing activity with more simple detectors .",

    "a minimal full network has a tetrahedral geometry with points @xmath160000  km above the surface : a single platform at earth - moon lagrange point l1 , covering most of the near side , and three points in wide halo orbits around l2 for the far side plus limb seen from earth .",

    "one l2 satellite covers @xmath10797% of the far side ( subtending @xmath184 , selenocentrically ) ; full coverage ( plus some redundancy ) requires three satellites ( plus l1 ) . with this configuration , the farthest point from a satellite",
