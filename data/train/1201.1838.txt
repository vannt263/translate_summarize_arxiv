    "fluids are usually treated as continuous media with their time evolution being determined by a suitable set of fluid equations , even if the underlying fundamental description is in terms of a discrete system of particles , whose dynamics is deterministic but characterized by random initial conditions .",
    "a continuum description for such systems applies when the kinetic description has a continuous phase - space probability density , given by a single - particle kinetic distribution function ( kdf ) , which satisfies a suitable kinetic equation .",
    "once the kdf is prescribed , all of the continuum fluid moments can be represented in terms of well - defined constitutive equations , determined via appropriate velocity moments of the kdf . when binary coulomb collisions are negligible ( collisionless or weakly - collisional plasmas )",
    ", one should return to the kinetic - theory description . in these cases ,",
    "stand - alone  fluid or magneto - hydrodynamics ( mhd ) approaches formulated independently of an underlying kinetic theory can usually provide , at best , a partial description of the plasma phenomenology .",
    "this is because of two possible inconsistencies which may arise .",
    "firstly , the set of fluid equations is generally not closed , and so requires the independent prescription of equations of state which may not give rise to a self - consistent system . secondly , in these approaches",
    "no account is usually given of microscopic phase - space particle dynamics ( including single - particle conservation laws ) or of phase - space plasma collective phenomena ( kinetic effects ) .",
    "these issues are naturally addressed within a kinetic treatment , where the fluid fields are determined from the underlying self - consistent kdf .",
    "this means that both the equations of state and the constitutive equations for the fluid fields ( see sections 7 - 9 ) then follow uniquely from the microscopic dynamics .",
    "this paper is concerned with the description of stationary or slowly - time - varying ( quasi - stationary ) phenomena occurring in astrophysical plasmas , focusing particularly on accretion discs around compact objects . for matter in the inner parts of such discs ,",
    "the plasma may be either collisional ( as in the majority of cases ) or collisionless , depending on the circumstances .",
    "a notable example of the latter case is provided by radiatively inefficient flows ( riafs ) arising in low - density geometrically - thick discs around black holes ( @xcite ) .",
    "matter in these systems is thought to consist of a two - temperature plasma , with the ion temperature being much higher than the electron one , and the coulomb collision timescale being much longer than the inflow time .",
    "other interesting applications for collisionless or weakly - collisional plasmas concern accretion discs around neutron stars and white dwarfs . in the inner regions of such discs ,",
    "the magnetic field of the central object may become dominant and ions and electrons can be collisionally decoupled so as to sustain different temperatures .",
    "this happens , in particular , if the radiative cooling time - scale of the electrons is much shorter than the time - scale for electron - ion collisions so that the electrons and ions are thermally decoupled and can have different temperatures ( @xcite ) .",
    "treatments of accretion discs have often been made in terms of a purely fluid - dynamical approach to which was added an anomalous  form of viscosity ( i.e. one not due to binary particle collisions ) , following simple intuitive turbulence models such as that giving rise to @xmath0-discs .",
    "however , it is now almost universally believed that the origin of the effective viscosity lies in magnetic phenomena ( such as the magneto - rotational instability , mri ) and that the medium needs to be treated as a magnetized plasma , when making detailed investigations , rather than as a simple unmagnetized neutral fluid .",
    "almost always , these calculations are then performed within the stand - alone continuum mhd treatments .",
    "however , as indicated above , the underlying plasma kinetic theory needs to be directly considered when treating collisionless or weakly - collisional plasmas .",
    "an approach of this type has been presented in two recent papers ( @xcite , hereafter referred to as paper i and paper ii respectively ) .",
    "the aim of the present paper is to address in detail the astrophysical aspects of the theory previously developed .",
    "we focus on accretion discs composed of collisionless plasma which can be subject to strong electro - magnetic ( em ) fields and which are gravitationally bound , in the sense of being confined by the combined gravitational potential of the central compact object and the disc .",
    "we deal with plasma which is sufficiently far from the central object so that it can be treated non - relativistically , with both @xmath1 and @xmath2 being @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the boltzmann constant , @xmath5 is the temperature , @xmath6 is the rest - mass of the species of plasma particle labelled with the index @xmath7 ( @xmath8 for an electron - ion plasma ) , @xmath9 is the cylindrical radial distance from the central object ( @xmath10 will be the vertical cylindrical coordinate ) , and @xmath11 is the local angular velocity in the disc .",
    "we do not include any interactions with radiation since we are not considering any background radiation field and radiation - reaction effects ( associated with the self - emission of radiation ) are negligible for our non - relativistic plasma .",
    "we envisage magnetic fields , on the other hand , which can in principle be either _ external _ ( @xmath12 ) , or _",
    "self - generated _ within the disc itself ( @xmath13 ) .",
    "estimated values coming from observations of accretion discs around compact objects include magnetic - field strengths in the range @xmath14 ( @xcite ) .",
    "for these systems , estimates for species temperatures usually lie in the ranges @xmath15 and @xmath16****for ions and electrons respectively .",
    "particle densities in different types of accretion disc around compact objects span a very wide range of values , but here we focus on the bottom end of it . in particular , for discussing the collisionless regime of non - relativistic ad plasmas , the number density is taken to be in the interval @xmath17 . in the case of hydrogen - ion systems , the spitzer collision time @xmath18 , the larmor rotation time @xmath19 and the langmuir time @xmath20 are then respectively in the ranges @xmath21 @xmath22 and @xmath23 , while the corresponding estimates for the debye length @xmath24 , the mean free path @xmath25 and the larmor radius @xmath26 are respectively @xmath27 , @xmath28 ( an extremely large number ! ) and @xmath29 ( the lower values corresponding to lower temperature and higher density in the first and second cases and to lower temperature and higher magnetic field in the third one ) . for a plasma consisting of ion and electron species ( @xmath30 ) , one can determine the range of values of these characteristic parameters for each species . for any phenomena occurring on timescales @xmath31 and lengthscales @xmath32 , satisfying",
    "@xmath33these plasmas can be considered as :    * ( # 1 ) _ collisionless : _ due to the inequalities between @xmath31 and @xmath34 and between @xmath32 and @xmath35 .",
    "_ any _ plasma is effectively collisionless for processes whose timescales and lengthscales are short enough and , under those circumstances , one needs to use kinetic theory . for a plasma",
    "which is sufficiently diffuse , this can include almost _ all _ relevant processes . *",
    "( # 2 ) characterized by a _",
    "mean - field em interaction : _ due to the inequalities between @xmath31 and @xmath36 and between @xmath32 and @xmath37 , charged particles of the accretion disc interact with the others only via a continuum mean em field . * ( # 3 ) _ quasi - neutral : _ due to the inequality between @xmath32 and @xmath38 , the plasma can be taken as being quasi - neutral on the lengthscale @xmath32 .",
    "when conditions # 1 and # 2 are satisfied , the medium is referred to as a _ vlasov - maxwell plasma _ and kinetic theory needs to be used .",
    "it is this which we will be considering in the following .",
    "the plasma is treated as an ensemble of particle species , each being described by a kdf @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the particle state vector and @xmath41 is the time , with @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the position and @xmath44 is the velocity .",
    "the species kdfs satisfy the vlasov kinetic equation @xmath45 , with the velocity moments of the kdfs determining the source of the em self - field @xmath46 , identified with the plasma charge and current density @xmath47 : @xmath48we work here within the framework of perturbative kinetic theory , extending the approach developed in papers i and ii . this approach allows construction of analytical solutions for the kdf for slowly - time - varying axisymmetric gravitationally - bound systems ( referred to as _ quasi - stationary kdfs _ ) .",
    "the treatment is developed for both strongly and weakly - magnetized plasmas , distinguishing between magnetic field configurations with closed and open magnetic surfaces ( @xcite ) . in the present paper",
    ", we are focusing on equilibrium or quasi - stationary configurations as a preliminary to subsequently studying perturbations around these solutions .",
    "note that what is meant here by the term equilibrium  is in general a quasi - stationary kdf , expressed in terms of the relevant first integrals of motion and adiabatic invariants ( see papers i and ii and @xcite ) , which can also include a non - vanishing stationary radial accretion flow ( catania1 ) .",
    "one of our main results is the demonstration that for strongly - magnetized collisionless plasmas , kinetic theory gives the possibility of having quasi - stationary accretion flows even in the absence of any additional forms of effective viscosity , such as those arising from turbulence phenomena ( which lie beyond the equilibrium solutions ) . within the framework of kinetic treatment ,",
    "quasi - stationary accretion flows can occur in collisionless ad plasmas as part of the equilibrium configuration , with the role of viscous stresses being played by the anisotropic pressure tensor generated by phase - space anisotropies .",
    "we note that a somewhat similar magnetically - driven non - turbulent mechanism for driving accretion has been pointed out before ( @xcite ) , based on a purely fluid treatment . while that has some similarity with what is being described here , in the sense that magnetic phenomena in stationary configurations are giving rise to the redistribution of angular momentum required for having the accretion flow , it is very different in other respects .",
    "we are concerned here particularly with investigating the role of specifically kinetic effects which do not appear in a fluid treatment .",
    "these can arise due to individual - particle dynamics ( e.g. finite larmor - radius effects and ones arising from microscopic conservation laws ) , as well as due to statistical properties of the equilibrium kdf ( e.g. temperature anisotropy and non - uniform fluid fields ) .",
    "their specific influence is found to depend critically on the topology of the magnetic surfaces , the statistical properties of the plasma and the strength of the em field .",
    "instabilities and turbulent phenomena ( see for example @xcite ) are not considered here .",
    "a number of issues arise for accretion - disc plasmas of this type , including ones related to :    \\1 ) existence of kinetic equilibria for both strongly and weakly - magnetized plasmas ;    \\2 ) dynamo effects occurring in quiescent accretion - disc plasmas , which can explain the self - generation of both azimuthal and poloidal magnetic fields ;    \\3 ) collisionless non - turbulent quasi - stationary accretion processes ;    \\4 ) closure conditions yielding a finite set of fluid equations for the relevant fluid fields ;    \\5 ) equations of state for the pressure tensor components .",
    "investigation of these issues is relevant for correctly understanding the equilibrium and dynamical properties of collisionless accretion - disc plasmas .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we provide a classification of accretion - disc plasmas together with the basic assumptions and definitions being used . in section 3 ,",
    "the first integrals and adiabatic invariants of the system are derived , and their physical meaning is discussed .",
    "section 4 deals with the construction of the quasi - stationary kdf for strongly - magnetized plasmas with open magnetic surfaces .",
    "similar calculations are then presented in section 5 for strongly - magnetized plasmas with closed nested magnetic surfaces , and in section 6 for weakly - magnetized plasmas . in section 7 the number density and flow velocity of each species are computed for all of the configurations considered and their physical properties are analyzed , stressing their connection with accretion - disc dynamics . in section 8 the pressure tensor for each species is explicitly calculated .",
    "a separate discussion is provided concerning the determination of equations of state for the pressure tensor components .",
    "section 9 deals with the calculation of the fluid angular momentum conservation law , while section 10 deals with the kinetic accretion process which does not depend on the presence of perturbative processes or an explicit viscosity .",
    "section 11 contains a demonstration of the existence of a kinetic dynamo mechanism and presents equations giving the poloidal and toroidal components of the magnetic field .",
    "finally , section 12 contains a summary of the main results and closing remarks . in the technical parts of this paper",
    ", we will often abbreviate `` accretion - disc plasma '' to `` ad plasma '' for conciseness .",
    "in the following we will distinguish between strongly - magnetized , intermediate and weakly - magnetized accretion - disc plasmas , the distinction being made on the basis of asymptotic conditions expressed in terms of suitable species - dependent dimensionless physical parameters .",
    "these parameters will also be used for characterizing the em fields and for constructing perturbative kinetic solutions for the quasi - stationary kdfs describing ad plasmas .",
    "three parameters are required :    \\1 ) the first parameter is @xmath49 , where @xmath50 again denotes the species index . here",
    "@xmath51 is the species average larmor radius , with @xmath52 denoting the species thermal velocity perpendicular to the magnetic field and @xmath53 being the species larmor frequency .",
    "note , that we are here always measuring temperatures in degrees kelvin , with @xmath4 denoting the boltzmann constant .",
    "@xmath54 is the characteristic length - scale of the spatial inhomogeneities of the em field , defined as @xmath55 , where @xmath56 and @xmath57 are the characteristic magnitudes of the gradients of the absolute values of the magnetic field @xmath58 and the electric field @xmath59 , defined as @xmath60 and @xmath61 , where the vector @xmath62 denotes @xmath63 .",
    "from @xmath64 it is possible to define a unique parameter @xmath65 .",
    "\\2 ) the second parameter is defined as @xmath66 , i.e. it is the ratio between the toroidal angular momentum of the particle @xmath67 and the magnetic contribution to its toroidal canonical momentum @xmath68 , with @xmath69 .",
    "here @xmath70 , with @xmath71 being the unit vector along the azimuthal direction @xmath72 , while @xmath73 denotes the flux function of the poloidal magnetic field ( see definition below ) .",
    "\\3 ) the third parameter is @xmath74 which represents the ratio between the kinetic energy of the particle @xmath75 and its potential energy .",
    "the latter is represented in terms of the effective potential @xmath76 which , in turn , is related to the electrostatic and gravitational potentials ( see the next section for a rigorous definition ) , while for thermal plasmas one has @xmath77 .",
    "related to @xmath78 , we also define @xmath79 .",
    "the ad plasma is said to be _ gravitationally bound _ if @xmath80 , and we are only considering such cases in the following .",
    "we classify these ad plasmas to be :    \\1 ) _ strongly - magnetized _ if the two conditions @xmath81 and @xmath82 are satisfied .",

    "\\3 ) _ weakly - magnetized _ if @xmath85 and @xmath86 .    in both the strongly and intermediately magnetized cases , charged particles spiral tightly around magnetic field lines ( so that gyrokinetic theory applies , see below ) , whereas they do not do this in weakly - magnetized plasmas . in this sense ,",
    "the behaviour of strongly and intermediately magnetized plasmas is similar but , on the other hand , they are importantly different in that the magnetic flux @xmath87 completely dominates the particle canonical momentum for strongly - magnetized plasmas , so that the contribution due to the particle angular momentum @xmath88 is negligible in the corresponding conservation law , whereas the contributions are comparable for intermediately - magnetized plasmas .    to give an indication of the circumstances in which conditions 1 ) and 2 ) above apply , we consider two situations representative of stellar mass and galactic - centre mass black holes . taking mass @xmath89 ( giving a schwarzschild radius @xmath90 ) as representative of a stellar - mass black hole , we focus on ad plasma located at @xmath91 from the central object , with ion temperature @xmath92 , and characteristic length - scale @xmath93 for the em field . then taking @xmath94 as representative of @xmath95 , we get @xmath96 which is at the lower end of the range of magnetic field strengths given above , and so the condition @xmath95 can easily be realized . for a galactic - centre black hole with mass @xmath97 , the equivalent estimate , for the same radial distance in terms of schwarzschild radii ,",
    "gives @xmath98 .",
    "considering now the condition @xmath99 , we make similar choices as above , plus taking the representative azimuthal particle velocity @xmath100 as being between the ion thermal velocity and the keplerian velocity , and the magnetic field strength as being related to the magnetic flux @xmath87 by @xmath101 . then requiring , for example",
    ", @xmath102 gives the ( very approximate ) bounds of @xmath103 for the stellar - mass case and @xmath96 for the galactic - centre one .",
    "the bound for the stellar - mass case is at the upper end of the range for magnetic field strengths given above , while that for the galactic - centre one is far more modest ( and we note that this is the more interesting context in practice for the appearance of riaf - type accretion flows ) .",
    "however , concerning these estimates , one should bear in mind that , in comparison with the case for @xmath104 , the bound on @xmath105 coming from @xmath106 is much more sensitive to the species being considered ( electrons or ions ) as well as to the value of the particle angular momentum and to the approximate order - of - magnitude relationship used for estimating @xmath105 from @xmath87 .",
    "depending on the circumstances being considered , the condition @xmath82 may or may not be satisfied , and so one should investigate both possibilities .    from the above considerations , it follows that both strongly and intermediately - magnetized plasmas may be found in the inner regions of accretion discs around compact objects .",
    "weakly - magnetized plasmas would be located further out , in the outer regions of discs , where lower temperatures and weaker magnetic fields are expected .",
    "we will focus here on studying the configurations for strongly and weakly - magnetized collisionless ad plasmas , leaving the corresponding investigation of intermediately - magnetized plasmas to a separate study .    ignoring possible weakly - dissipative effects ( coulomb collisions and turbulence )",
    ", we will assume that the kdf and the em fields associated with the plasma obey the system of vlasov - maxwell equations , with maxwell s equations being considered in the quasi - static approximation .",
    "for definiteness , we will consider here a plasma consisting of two species of charged particles : one species of ions ( @xmath107 ) and one of electrons ( @xmath108 ) .",
    "following the treatment presented in papers i and ii , we are taking the ad plasma to be : a ) _ non - relativistic _ , in the sense that it has non ",

    "we focus here on solutions for the equilibrium magnetic field @xmath111 which admit a family of locally - nested axisymmetric toroidal magnetic surfaces ( @xcite ) .",
    "we recall that a magnetic surface is defined as a surface on which the poloidal magnetic flux @xmath87 is constant , and that the condition @xmath112 is then identically satisfied on each magnetic surface",
    ". a schematic view of nested magnetic surfaces is shown in figure 1 . for the equilibrium configurations which we are considering here ( prior to any subsequent perturbation ) it is reasonable to think that the magnetic field would be rather ordered , at least on a local scale , so that having nested magnetic surfaces is likely on that local scale .",
    "we distinguish between the cases of _ locally closed _",
    "magnetic surfaces , discussed in paper i , and _ locally open _ magnetic surfaces , discussed in paper ii .",
    "note that here the meaning of open and closed surfaces has to be interpreted with reference to the local domain occupied by the ad plasma .",
    "see figure 1 for a schematic comparison of the two topologies . for both of the configurations",
    ", a set of magnetic coordinates ( @xmath113 ) can be defined locally , where @xmath114 is a curvilinear angle - like coordinate on the magnetic surfaces @xmath115 each relevant physical quantity @xmath116 can then be conveniently expressed either in terms of the cylindrical coordinates or as a function of the magnetic coordinates , i.e. @xmath117 where the @xmath72 dependence has been suppressed due to the axisymmetry .        for the configuration of closed nested magnetic surfaces , we will assume small inverse aspect ratio ordering  to hold , as expressed by the requirement that @xmath118 . here the dimensionless quantity @xmath119 is referred to as the _ inverse aspect ratio _",
    "parameter , where @xmath120 is the radial distance from the vertical axis to the centre of the nested magnetic surfaces and @xmath121 is the average cross - sectional poloidal radius of the largest closed toroidal magnetic surface .",
    "this ordering is consistent with the results presented by @xcite and with the assumption of nested and closed magnetic surfaces which are assumed to be localized in space ( see also further discussion in paper i ) .",
    "in the following we will consider ad plasmas which are characterized by slowly time - varying phenomena .",
    "in particular , the em field is taken to be given by an analytic function of the form @xmath122 ,   \\label{b0}\\]]with @xmath123 being an integer @xmath124 and @xmath125 .",
    "this time dependence is connected with either external sources or boundary conditions for the kdf . in particular",
    ", we will assume that the magnetic field is of the form@xmath126where @xmath127 and @xmath128 denote the self - generated magnetic field produced by the ad plasma and a finite external magnetic field produced by the central object ( in the case of neutron stars or white dwarfs ) .",
    "for greater generality , we will not prescribe any relative orderings between the various components of the total magnetic field , which are taken to be of the form @xmath129 in particular , here @xmath130 and @xmath131 are the toroidal and poloidal components of the self - field , while the external magnetic field @xmath128 is defined in terms of the vacuum potential @xmath132 . as a consequence , the magnetic field",
    "can also be written in the equivalent form @xmath133where the function @xmath134 is defined as @xmath135 with @xmath136 and @xmath137 defining a set of local magnetic coordinates ( as implied by the equation @xmath138 which is identically satisfied ) .",
    "finally , it is also assumed that the charged particles of the plasma are subject to the action of _ effective _ _ em potentials _",
    "@xmath139 where @xmath140 is given by@xmath141with @xmath142 @xmath143 and @xmath144 denoting the _ effective _ electrostatic potential and the electrostatic and gravitational potentials .",
    "in particular , the gravitational potential @xmath145 is expressed as @xmath146 , where @xmath147 and @xmath148 denote the gravitational potentials due to the external sources ( i.e. , primarily the central object ) and the same accretion disc  respectively .",
    "the latter can be computed from the poisson equation@xmath149where @xmath150 is the newton gravitational constant and the source term @xmath151 describes the distribution of matter of the ad plasma . in the following it is assumed that the gravitational potential @xmath145 is a known quantity .",
    "in this section we first define relevant kinetic conserved quantities , namely dynamical variables depending on the states of the individual charged particles of the plasma .",
    "we refer here in particular to collisionless ad plasmas which satisfy the assumptions introduced in the previous section .",
    "then , on the basis of this , we will investigate the basic physical implications of the conservation laws for the qualitative properties of single - particle dynamics .",
    "the determination of dynamical invariants ( i.e. , first integrals of motion and adiabatic invariants ) is a basic requirement for the construction of equilibrium solutions for the kdf ( kinetic equilibria ) .",
    "we recall here that an adiabatic invariant @xmath152 of order @xmath153 with respect to @xmath154 is a quantity which is conserved only asymptotically , i.e. , in the sense that @xmath155 , where @xmath156 is a suitable integer . in other words ,",
    "adiabatic invariants are dynamical variables which change slowly on the time - scale of the larmor rotation time .",
    "these invariants can be derived from the lagrangian formulation of the single particle dynamics and the corresponding gyrokinetic theory ( see subsection below ) , which can be obtained by means of a suitable asymptotic expansion in terms of the dimensionless parameter @xmath64 as long as this is @xmath157 .",
    "because of this requirement , and in view of the previous classification , gyrokinetic theory can only be formulated for strongly - magnetized and intermediately - magnetized ad plasmas .",
    "we first consider the treatment of the first integrals and adiabatic invariants which are conserved for both strongly - magnetized and weakly - magnetized ad plasmas . by assumption ,",
    "the only first integral of motion is the toroidal canonical momentum @xmath68 conjugate to the ignorable azimuthal angle @xmath72:@xmath158the total particle energy@xmath159is instead considered , by construction , to be an adiabatic invariant of order @xmath153 , with @xmath160 .",
    "additional adiabatic invariants can be determined for strongly - magnetized plasmas based on gyrokinetic ( gk ) theory ( see paper ii , @xcite ) .",
    "we recall that gyrokinetic theory provides a convenient formulation for single charged - particle dynamics in the presence of em fields which are strong enough so that the motion of the particle can be well - represented as spiraling around a single field line , following an imaginary guiding centre which moves along the field line .",
    "gyrokinetic theory clearly displays the characteristic symmetry of the spiral motion , allowing further conservation laws to be derived in addition to those mentioned previously .",
    "we refer to paper ii for the mathematical details concerning the formulation of non - relativistic gyrokinetic theory in the presence of both em and gravitational fields . here , for the sake of completeness , we recall the basic notation for this and the main conclusions which can be inferred from it . in the following , we will use a prime  @xmath161  to denote a dynamical variable defined at the _ guiding - centre position _",
    "@xmath162 ( or @xmath163 in axisymmetry ) .",
    "the single particle velocity is decomposed as @xmath164 where @xmath165 and @xmath166 denote respectively the parallel and perpendicular components of the guiding - centre velocity with respect to the magnetic field direction , while the effective velocity @xmath167 is defined as @xmath168 with @xmath169 @xmath170**@xmath171**@xmath172 being the unit vector of the local magnetic field and where we have identified @xmath173 .",
    "it then follows immediately that an adiabatic invariant is provided by the _ guiding - centre canonical momentum _",
    "correct to @xmath175 , with @xmath136 , this is given by @xmath176 a further adiabatic invariant is the _ magnetic moment _",
    "@xmath177 , which is proportional to the canonical momentum @xmath178 conjugate to the gyrophase angle @xmath179 , which can be determined in principle to arbitrary order in @xmath180 ( @xcite ) .",
    "in particular , the leading - order approximation yields @xmath181 . finally , by construction , the _ guiding - centre hamiltonian _ @xmath182 is also an adiabatic invariant .",
    "accurate to order @xmath153 this is given by@xmath183 when the above assumptions hold , the invariants determined in this way necessarily exist for arbitrary initial conditions .",
    "we now discuss the physical meaning of the conservation laws introduced here and their implications for particle dynamics in magnetized accretion discs .",
    "consider first the conservation of the toroidal canonical momentum ( p_fi ) .",
    "for a charged particle it follows that this is the sum of two terms : the particle angular momentum @xmath184 and a magnetic contribution @xmath185 .",
    "it follows that the angular momentum by itself is generally not conserved . as a consequence ,",
    "the canonical momentum conservation law allows for the existence of radial particle motion inside a disc .",
    "in fact , since in ad plasmas the magnetic flux function @xmath73 is necessarily spatially non - homogeneous , a moving particle must change its angular momentum @xmath88 while fulfilling the constraint @xmath186 , namely staying on a @xmath187surface . depending on the geometry of the magnetic surfaces",
    ", such particle motion may correspond to either a vertical or radial velocity towards regions of higher or lower magnetic flux . since the magnetic contribution to @xmath188 depends on the sign of the charges , single ions and electrons exhibit motions in different directions while keeping @xmath188 constant .",
    "this feature is different from the situation for neutral particles , for which the angular momentum itself is conserved . because of the presence of plasma boundaries",
    ", this can lead to the self - generation of quasi - stationary electric fields in the accretion disc as a result of charge separation .",
    "we next focus on the conservation of the guiding - centre hamiltonian ( ham giricinetica ) and the magnetic moment @xmath189 ( to leading - order approximation ) .",
    "these can be combined to represent the parallel velocity @xmath190 as@xmath191 } .",
    "\\label{trap}\\ ] ] therefore @xmath190 is a local function of the guiding - centre position vector @xmath192 and , due to axisymmetry , of the corresponding flux coordinates ( @xmath193 ) .",
    "the above relationship is the basis of _ particle trapping phenomena _ , corresponding to the existence of allowed and forbidden regions of configuration space for the motion of charged particles .",
    "in fact , since @xmath194 is only defined in the subset of the configuration space spanned by ( @xmath195 ) where the argument of the square root is non - negative , it follows from eq.([trap ] ) that particles must undergo spatial reflections when @xmath196 .",
    "the points of the configuration space where this occurs are the so - called _ mirror points _ and the occurrence of such points may generate various kinetic phenomena . in particular , particles can in principle experience zero , one or two reflections corresponding respectively to _ passing particles ( pps ) , bouncing particles ( bps ) _ and _ trapped particles ( tps)_. in the present case , since the right hand side of eq.([trap ] ) depends on the magnitude of the magnetic field ( @xmath197 ) , the effective potential energy ( @xmath198 ) and the centrifugal potential ( @xmath199 ) , we will refer to the tp case as _ gravitational em trapping_.    finally , an important qualitative property of collisionless magnetized plasmas follows from the conservation of the magnetic moment @xmath189 .",
    "the expression for this relates the magnitude of the perpendicular velocity @xmath200 to that of the local magnetic field @xmath201 .",
    "conservation of the adiabatic invariant @xmath202 implies that when a charge is subject to a non - uniform or a non - stationary magnetic field , its kinetic energy of perpendicular motion , @xmath203 , must change accordingly so as to keep @xmath202 constant . on the other hand , particles moving on @xmath187surfaces",
    "generally necessarily experience a non - uniform magnetic field @xmath204 .",
    "it can be shown that this property implies also the phenomenon of having a non - isotropic kinetic temperature ( i.e. there being different effective temperatures parallel and perpendicular to the local direction of the magnetic field ) . from the statistical point of view of kinetic theory , this temperature anisotropy corresponds to an anisotropy in the kinetic energy of random motion of particles subject to the magnetic field .",
    "such a feature is a characteristic kinetic phenomenon arising in magnetized collisionless plasmas .",
    "this physical mechanism operating at the level of single particle dynamics has important consequences also for the macroscopic properties of such plasmas .",
    "as we will see , conservation of @xmath189 allows the effects of temperature anisotropy to be included consistently in the quasi - stationary solution for the kdf , and for its physical implications for the dynamics of the corresponding fluid system to be inferred .",
    "another candidate source of temperature anisotropy is radiation emission ( cyclotron radiation ) due to larmor rotation in the presence of a strong magnetic field .",
    "the signature of this is the simultaneous occurrence of radiation emission corresponding to the larmor frequencies of the different plasma species .",
    "in this section and the following one , we point out the most relevant physical aspects of the kinetic treatment of quasi - stationary strongly - magnetized collisionless ad plasmas in the presence of magnetic field configurations with nested magnetic surfaces . in this section , we consider the case of magnetic surfaces which are open in the domain of the plasma .",
    "the case of closed magnetic surfaces is treated in the following section . following the treatment presented in paper ii , here we want to emphasize the physical aspects of the theory and the role of the kinetic approach adopted here . for greater generality",
    ", it is assumed that each species in the plasma is associated with a set of _ sub - species _ ( the pps , bps and tps mentioned above ) , each one having a different kdf .",
    "the existence of temperature anisotropy is allowed for all of the species , involving the introduction of different temperatures parallel and perpendicular to the local direction of the magnetic field .",
    "it is also assumed that a non - vanishing species - dependent poloidal flow velocity can exist , related to possible inward or outward matter flows in the disc ( see also the discussion below ) . under these assumptions , as pointed out in papers i and ii , a solution for the quasi - stationary kdf can be obtained , which in the following is denoted as @xmath205 .",
    "this is expressed in terms of the integrals of motion and the adiabatic invariants identified in the previous section .",
    "it has the form @xmath206where @xmath136 and @xmath154 is to be identified with @xmath180 . here , by construction",
    ", @xmath205 is only defined in the subset of the phase - space where the adiabatic invariants are defined , while the variables in the round brackets @xmath207 will be involved in the perturbative expansions to be defined below .",
    "it follows that @xmath205 is suitable for describing passing , bouncing and trapped particles .",
    "hence , by construction , the kdf is itself an adiabatic invariant , and is therefore an asymptotic solution of the vlasov equation . due to the arbitrariness of the definition of the kdf , for each plasma sub - species it is always possible to identify it with a superposition of gaussian distributions or , more generally , suitably generalized gaussian distributions .",
    "however , for a collisionless plasma , each of these functions must actually itself be a quasi - stationary solution and so , due to the requirement ( [ form ] ) , @xmath205 can always be prescribed to be asymptotically close  to a local bi - maxwellian kdf . regarding this , in paper ii it was proved that @xmath208 can be identified with a properly - defined _ generalized bi - maxwellian kdf with parallel velocity perturbations_.    in this paper we are mainly interested in the astrophysical applications of the kinetic analysis and so we omit here all of the mathematical details of the derivation , referring to paper ii for an exhaustive discussion .",
    "it is sufficient to mention here that a characteristic feature of the quasi - stationary kdf @xmath205 is that it contains implicit dependences in terms of the single particle velocities .",
    "as shown in paper ii , these dependences can be made explicit for strongly magnetized and gravitationally bound plasmas so as to allow an asymptotic analytical treatment of the velocity moments .",
    "an interesting feature of the theory is the double taylor - expansion which is performed on @xmath205 to reach this goal , achieving a systematic solution method for the vlasov equation .",
    "more precisely , this is done in terms of the two dimensionless parameters @xmath106 and @xmath209 , requiring that the inequalities @xmath82 and @xmath210 are satisfied when the particle velocity is taken to be of the order @xmath211 or @xmath212 , where @xmath213 and @xmath214 denote respectively the parallel and perpendicular thermal velocities . for greater generality , @xmath106 and @xmath215",

    "in fact , for the different populations the analytical expansion can lead to different contributions for the terms appearing in the diamagnetic and energy - correction parts , depending on the relative magnitudes of the parameters @xmath106 and @xmath237 . on the other hand , because of the double expansion and the energy dependence , the asymptotic solution for the two species can hold also in different spatial domains .",
    "finally we note that the expansion given in eq.([solo ] ) shows that , in general , a bi - maxwellian kdf can not be an exact stationary solution of the vlasov equation . instead",

    "there are two important physical implications which follow from the quasi - stationary solution for the kdf ( [ solo ] ) .",

    "hence , the functional forms of the leading - order effective number density , the parallel and azimuthal flow velocities and the temperatures carried by the bi - maxwellian kdf , are uniquely determined in terms of @xmath73 and @xmath114 . as a consequence , the azimuthal angular velocity is of the general form @xmath245 .",
    "we stress that in the customary treatment of collisionless ad plasmas based on ideal - mhd these constraints are missing . instead",
    ", they follow in a natural way from kinetic theory . by adopting a kinetic treatment it is possible to prescribe the correct form for the fluid fields , as required by the presence of kinetic constraints .",
    "a further important consequence of the kinetic constraints is the relationship between the magnitude of the temperature anisotropy and the guiding - centre magnetic field at two different spatial locations .",
    "in fact , the quantity @xmath246 in the kdf is necessarily an adiabatic invariant . to leading - order in the gk expansion",

    "in this section we present the kinetic solution for strongly - magnetized plasmas in the case in which the equilibrium magnetic field admits locally a family of closed and nested magnetic surfaces .",

    "in this section we derive a solution for the quasi - stationary kdf describing weakly - magnetized collisionless ad plasmas .",
    "the basic difference from the strongly - magnetized regime is that gyrokinetic theory does not hold for weakly - magnetized plasmas because single particles are effectively not magnetically confined ( the larmor radius is of the same order as the characteristic equilibrium scale - length of the plasma , or larger ) .",

    "hence , in this case equilibrium radial flows are excluded .    in conclusion , for the case of weakly - magnetized plasmas , it follows from the present treatment that quasi - stationary equilibrium configurations with isotropic pressure tensor would not have any net radial flow .",
    "this is as expected . in order to have an accretion flow in this context one needs to have some form of effective viscosity , either appearing explicitly or coming from perturbations around the equilibrium state such as those leading to mri in the conventional picture .",
    "a particular goal of our future work will be to investigate perturbations around the equilibrium states presented here , to see whether a process analogous to mri then appears also for collisionless plasmas .",
    "on the other hand , in the case of strongly - magnetized plasmas the situation is different and net radial inflow can occur even in the absence of effective viscosity being explicitly added or coming from perturbative mechanisms . for strongly - magnetized plasmas , eq.([angcons ] ) implies that particles of one species can move radially in a quasi - stationary configuration independently of those of other species , with the species angular momentum not being conserved , since the conservation law involves the canonical momentum ( including a magnetic - field contribution ) and not just the standard angular momentum .",
    "the flow velocity @xmath443 is different for each species and , also , the pressure tensor is non - isotropic .",
    "hence , even with quasi - neutrality , the total angular momentum of the matter can change due to balance with the torque produced by the non - isotropic species pressure tensor and/or a net current flow across magnetic surfaces ( see also the discussion below ) .",
    "as indicated above , the non - isotropic nature of @xmath445 is caused by temperature anisotropy as well as by first - order and flr effects , which are determined self - consistently in the kinetic approach .",
    "in this section we discuss how quasi - stationary accretion flows could occur in collisionless ad plasmas as a result just of the equilibrium configuration without requiring additional effective viscosity of the sort mentioned above . here the role of viscous stresses is played by the anisotropic pressure tensor , which is part of the equilibrium solution .    for the physical conditions considered in the introduction to which the theory applies , the characteristic time for the inward accretion flow in accretion discs is typically longer than the characteristic larmor time @xmath446 as well as the langmuir time @xmath36 and smaller than the spitzer ion collision time so that an accretion flow can be consistently described by the present collisionless kinetic treatment for quasi - stationary equilibria . in this section",
    "we will demonstrate that equilibrium accretion flows can not arise in the case of strongly - magnetized plasmas with closed magnetic surfaces and weakly - magnetized plasmas .",

    "the physical interpretation for both of these is clear : higher magnetic pressure slows down the matter accretion rate while increasing the number density , whereas higher parallel temperature corresponds to higher radial fluid mobility , thus decreasing the local species number density .",
    "next , we consider domains of strongly - magnetized plasmas with closed field lines , again using the inverse aspect ratio expansion .",
    "we want to prove that the poloidal - averaged radial flow velocity @xmath465 vanishes identically , when @xmath466 is computed in terms of the quasi - stationary kdf ( [ solo2 ] ) . given a generic function of the form @xmath467 , the operator @xmath468 is defined as@xmath469with @xmath470 and so , from eq.([v3 ] ) it follows that , to leading - order in the inverse aspect ratio@xmath471which vanishes because , to leading - order in @xmath472 , @xmath473 is antisymmetric with respect to the transformation @xmath474 .",
    "higher - order corrections in the inverse aspect ratio can be included , but they require also performing the asymptotic expansion of the kdf to higher - order in both @xmath215 and @xmath106 .",
    "therefore , in sub - domains of the plasma where magnetic surfaces are closed and nested no net equilibrium accretion flow can arise .    finally , the corresponding treatment for weakly - magnetized plasmas can be recovered from eq.([fwf ] ) .",

    "these originate from the guiding - centre back - transformation , which is characteristic of open - field configurations , and are responsible for the generation of @xmath480 . for strongly - magnetized plasmas with open magnetic surfaces",
    ", the parallel velocity @xmath496 also contributes to the generation of poloidal currents .",
    "\\3 ) for weakly - magnetized plasmas , only the poloidal component of the magnetic field can be self - generated . however , when the azimuthal angular velocity coincides to leading - order with the keplerian frequency , the azimuthal current density vanishes due to quasi - neutrality ( to leading - order )",
    "therefore , in this case the current is necessarily produced by first - order corrections .",
    "this conclusion is consistent with the assumption of weak magnetic field .",
    "we stress that , in contrast to customary mhd treatments , the quasi - stationary kinetic dynamo effect described here can occur even _ in the absence of possible instabilities or turbulence phenomena_. in particular , configurations with closed magnetic surfaces or contributions from tps in the case of open surfaces could be responsible for the self - generation of toroidal field even _ without needing any net accretion flow _ in the domain of interest .",
    "this toroidal field is associated with the existence of kinetic torques which cause redistribution of angular momentum , as discussed above .",
    "in this paper a kinetic description for collisionless quasi - stationary accretion disc plasmas has been formulated within the framework of vlasov - maxwell theory .",
    "a perturbative approach has been developed , which enables the systematic analytical construction of equilibrium kinetic distribution functions for non - relativistic axisymmetric collisionless plasmas subject to both gravitational and electromagnetic fields .",
    "the cases of both weakly and strongly - magnetized plasmas have been investigated , for configurations with both open and closed magnetic surfaces .",
    "the main aim was to establish kinetic equilibrium configurations to use as a starting point for subsequent perturbation analysis , looking for kinetic mechanisms which could give rise to an effective viscosity able to drive accretion flows within the collisionless regime .",
    "equilibrium solutions for the vlasov equation with non - uniform number density , azimuthal rotation , possible accretion flows and non - uniform temperature anisotropy have been constructed . for doing this , the distribution function has been represented in terms of first integrals and adiabatic invariants , as follows from conservation laws of the single - particle dynamics , and taking into account suitable kinetic constraints . as a consequence , based on the perturbative kinetic approach ,",
    "explicit constitutive equations for the fluid fields have been determined , which are accurate to first - order in the relevant expansion parameters .",
    "this permits the construction of asymptotic solutions of the corresponding mhd fluid equations systematically retaining all first - order corrections , including effects due to flr - diamagnetic and energy - correction contributions .",
    "several physical issues have been analyzed .",
    "these concern : a ) deriving equilibrium equations of state for the species pressure tensor components ; b ) establishing a fluid angular momentum conservation law and comparing it with the predictions of standard fluid treatments ; c ) investigating possible kinetic accretion processes within equilibrium ad configurations ( without perturbing the equilibrium ) and deriving a related kinetic accretion law ; d ) demonstrating the existence of a quasi - stationary kinetic dynamo mechanism for the self - generation of poloidal and toroidal magnetic field .",
    "potential applications of the theory include , in particular , the case of radiatively inefficient accretion flows .",
    "as mentioned above , future work will address making stability analysis of the kinetic equilibria presented here , so as to investigate further mechanisms which could be responsible for driving the accretion flow in the collisionless regime .",
