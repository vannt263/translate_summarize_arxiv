    "i.e. , microwave , infrared , and visible light spectroscopy , x - ray diffraction , and electron scattering , were doomed to fail . finally , the stability of the dimer @xmath1he@xmath12  was confirmed by mass spectroscopy  @xcite , while dimer and trimer of @xmath4he were detected using diffraction from the nanoscale grating  @xcite .",

    "significant differences were noticed in case of the trimer @xmath1he@xmath12t@xmath23 , e.g. , when the most accurate @xmath4he - t@xmath23 model is replaced by the frequently used model , the binding energy is reduced by almost @xmath24 , which is also reflected in different distribution functions .",

    "additionaly , they calculated casimir - polder  @xcite retardation effects appropriate for each level of correction ( adiabatic , adiabatic+relativistic , and so on ) .",
    "they also computed dissociation energies for @xmath4he-@xmath4he using those types of corrections , and showed that some of them cancel each other .",
    "the @xmath22-dissociation energy @xmath30 is changed the most by including among all @xmath22-corrections only the retardation term appropriate for the @xmath22  interaction potential ( ret ) ; in that case it is lowered approximately by @xmath31 . on the one hand , by including all corrections , i.e. when using the complete saptsm+arq retarded potential ( pckljs - the authors  @xcite acronym ) , the dissociation energy is 1.62(3 ) mk  @xcite .    in order to compare the selected @xmath22  potentials and their corrections , in figure  [ fig : saptsm ] we plot the differences hfdb - saptsm , tty - saptsm , together with arq and ret correction , and the error of the saptsm potential @xmath25 .",
    "as the separation of he atoms @xmath28 increases , both corrections ( arq , ret , @xmath25 ) and oscillating differences ( hfdb - saptsm , tty - saptsm ) decay very fast ( notice the logarithmic scale ) .",
    "all plotted differences are by absolute value higher than @xmath25 , so it is interesting to investigate whether their impact on the cluster properties could be discerned in experiments .    as discussed in section  [ ch : results ] , experimentally measured trimer properties suggest even weaker potentials than the previously mentioned models .",
    "this prompted us to test if small changes in the interaction potential model could account for the experimental findings . during the potential model construction , dispersion coefficients @xmath32",
    "are usually attenuated by fitting damping functions to experimental or theoretical data .",
    "simplifying this procedure , lowering only the coefficient @xmath33 used in the hfdb model , we tried to obtain a new potential that could predict structural properties of he trimers more accurately than the previously mentioned corrections . to this end , we constructed three models hfdb - rc6 where r denotes the factor by which the parameter @xmath33 is reduced : @xmath34 ( 2c ) , @xmath35 ( 1c ) and @xmath36 ( 5 m ) , e.g. , -5mc6 means @xmath37 .",
    "comparison of -rc6 corrections with ret is given in figure  [ fig : hfdb ] .",

    "@xmath29 from -rc6 models are more significant than ret , while at long range ret becomes dominant . on the same figure , we plot the reversed percentage of hfdb .",

    "roudnev and cavagnero  @xcite stressed the sensitivity of benchmarked dimer and trimer properties to fundamental constants .",
    "thus we used the best available data from the nist database , with constant @xmath49 for @xmath4he and @xmath5he equal to @xmath50 and @xmath51 , respectively .    in order to reduce the variance of the calculation to a manageable level",

    "additional tests were performed with significant changes in parameters to ensure that the guiding wave function did not introduce any energy bias .",

    "in table  [ tab : e2 ] , we present detailed calculations of the helium dimer energy and the scattering parameters obtained using selected potentials , in combination with different corrections .",
