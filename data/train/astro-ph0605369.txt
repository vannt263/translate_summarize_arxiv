    "the oscillations lead to a higher effective decay rate compared to the qed prediction , because the mirror photons from the decays of mirror orthopositronium are not detected . because collisions between orthopositronium and gas molecules will inhibit the oscillations , it is possible to distinguish this effect from possible invisible decay modes of orthopositronium . in a vacuum cavity experiment performed in 1990 @xcite a faster decay rate than the qed prediction was seen .",
