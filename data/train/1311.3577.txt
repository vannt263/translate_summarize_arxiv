    "the international committee for weights and measures recommended several radiations for the practical realization of the metre . at the border of the visible and near - infrared ranges ,",
    "in particular , the international bureau of weights and measures ( bipm ) recommends the 5s@xmath0(f=3 ) - 5d@xmath1(f=5 ) two - photon transition in @xmath2rb with a standard uncertainty of 5 khz ( the relative standard uncertainty of @xmath3 )  @xcite .",
    "recent development in phase - stabilized optical frequency combs based on mode - locked femtosecond lasers allowed determination of the absolute frequency of a similar transition in rb , 5s@xmath0 - 7s@xmath0 , which is 100 times weaker than 5s-5d , yet less sensitive to stray magnetic fields . at the 5s-5d transition",
    "the rubidium atoms must be carefully shielded against the magnetic field to avoid any linear zeeman shifts . on the other hand ,",
    "the 5s and 7s levels have the same land @xmath4 factors which cancels the linear zeeman shifts in the 5s-7s transition .",
    "the ac - stark effect in the 5s-7s transition is also smaller than in the 5s-5d case . because of the difference in the signal strengths , all previous measurements of the 5s-7s transition  @xcite yielded absolute values of its frequency less accurate than for the 5s-5d transition  @xcite . in this work",
    "we report the measurement of the absolute frequency measurements of the 5s@xmath0 - 7s@xmath0 transitions in @xmath5rb and @xmath2rb with relative standard uncertainty smaller than @xmath6 which is better than measured previously and is comparable with the measurements of the 5s-5d transition  @xcite .",
    "the experimental setup is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : setup ] .",
    "we have used a commercial ring - cavity titanium sapphire ( tisa ) laser to study the two - photon 5s@xmath0 - 7s@xmath0 transitions at 760 nm in a hot rubidium vapour cell at temperatures up to @xmath7c .",
    "the tisa laser , pre - stabilised by a fabry - prot cavity , has the linewidth of 300 khz .",
    "the two - photon spectroscopy signal is observed by a photomultiplier tube in the 7s-6p-5s radiative cascade , with the 6p-5s blue fluorescence around 421 nm . the laser is digitally locked to the measured transition .",
    "the digital lock , a technique generally used in optical atomic clocks , allows for long interrogation of the non - modulated reference beam with an optical frequency comb .",
    "that technique and good long - term stability of our system reduce the statistical uncertainties of measured frequencies below 1  khz , an order of magnitude better than in refs .",
    "@xcite , thanks to the longer averaging times .",
    "the low statistical uncertainty enabled studies of systematic shifts with accordingly higher precision .",
    "the idea of the digital lock is depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : digilock ] . an acousto - optic modulator ( aom ) driven by a direct digital synthesizer ( dds ) square - wave modulates the light frequency with the step @xmath8 equal to the half - width of the line",
    "the aom carrier frequency @xmath9 is chosen such that the aom efficiency with @xmath10 and @xmath11 is the same .",
    "the microcontroller ( atmel at91sam7s ) , which controls the dds , counts the photomultiplier pulses from the fluorescence signal of the 6p-5s transition . the error signal for the laser lock is calculated from the difference of the counts corresponding to fluorescence for @xmath12 and @xmath13 . the software pi regulator in the microcontroller calculates the correction @xmath14 and applies it to the tisa laser .",
    "switching between the @xmath15 frequencies in the dds is completed in 150 ns and the acoustic wave needs few @xmath16s to completely propagate the frequency changes through the aom pbmo0@xmath17 crystal .",
    "the following acquisition of the photomultiplier pulses takes 38 ms which is long enough to ignore chirping effects from switching the @xmath15 frequencies .",
    "the power of the light sent to the rubidium cell is stabilised by the software pi regulator on the embedded pc ( fox board g20 ) with a half - wave plate mounted on a piezo - driven mount and a polariser . to exclude the residual doppler effect , caused by the wave - front curvature , the counter - propagating beams in the two - photon spectroscopy are not focused and their relative positions are controlled by a ccd beam profiler .",
    "the digital lock can be also used to measure the line profile ( fig .",
    "[ fig : line ] ) by changing @xmath18 in the digital lock algorithm and recording accordingly the fluorescence intensity .",
    "since the counter - propagating beams are not focused , the transition is characterized by a power - broadened lorentzian profile .",
    "the measurement accuracy may be reduced at the line center where the digital lock is less precise because of small value of the fluorescence derivative with respect to the laser frequency leading to underestimation of measured fluorescence at given frequency .",
    "rb f=2-f=2 line profile for different intensities of the probing light .",
    "the lorentz profile is fitted to the measured data . ]",
    "part of the tisa light is sent directly to the er - dopped fiber optical frequency comb ( menlo fc1500 - 250-wg ) .",
    "the comb , the dds synthesizers and counters in the experiment are locked to a microwave rb frequency standard ( srs fs725 ) , disciplined by the gps ( connor winfield fts 375 ) with fractional freuqency uncertainty better than @xmath19 at our measurement times .",
    "the fractional allan variance of the frequency of the tisa laser locked to the @xmath5rb f=2-f=2 transition measured with the optical frequency comb is presented in fig .",

    "s the rb frequency standard reaches its final stability , and our system is further disciplined by the gps which improves the stability , as seen in the plot , after @xmath20 s integration time .",
    "rb f=2-f=2 transition measured with the optical frequency comb . ]",
    "several systematic effects should be taken into account to deduce the transition frequency .",
    "most pronounced is the systematic pressure shift of the measured transition .",
    "the rubidium vapour pressure is determined by the cell temperature  @xcite .",
    "we measured the absolute frequencies at different temperatures ( accuracy of 0.2  k ) and estimated the coefficient of the pressure shift interaction rb - rb as -17.82(81 ) khz / mtorr ( fig .",
    "[ fig : press]a ) .",
    "this value differs from the value in ref .",
    "@xcite since we used a more accurate expression  @xcite for calculating the vapour pressure at given temperature .",
    "finally , the shift was extrapolated to the zero pressure . in the same way we measured and calibrated the ac - stark shift .",
    "surprisingly , the measured ac - stark shift is much lower than calculated in ref .",
    "analysis of this effect is , however , beyond the scope of this report .",
    "in addition to the rb - rb pressure shift , additional contribution comes from collisions with residual gas present in the cell ( mainly ar , since rubidium acts as a getter for other impurities ) . in recent work of wu et al .",
    "@xcite the 6s-8s transition frequency measured in 10 different commercial cs vapour cells varied by hundreds of khz , but measurements of the 5s-5d transition  @xcite proved that in rb this effect is not that big .",
    "our rb cell has been filled under vacuum of the order of @xmath21 torr but we assume it could drop to about @xmath22 torr because of the cell ageing .",
    "the rb - ar collisional shift was estimated assuming van der waals interaction  @xcite and verified with data in ref .",
    "[ fig : press]b depicts the determination of the quadratic zeeman shift coefficient measured by application of an external , calibrated magnetic field .",
    "the actual magnetic field was measured by a precise magnetometer .",
    "the black body radiation @xcite and second order doppler shifts were calculated for a given stabilised cell temperature .",
    "the systematic shift caused by different efficiencies of the aom probing two sides of the transition is most likely the fundamental limit of the measured uncertainty in the digital lock scheme .",
    "this shift is dependent on the laser frequency derivatives of fluorescence corresponding to @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "this effect is most clearly seen when the residual doppler effect caused by some misalignment of the probe beams broadens the line by few mhz . the resulting change of these derivatives shifts the transition by tens of khz .",
    "this shift is quantified by varying the @xmath18 value in the dds lock and the aom diffraction order ( + @xmath9 or -@xmath9 ) .",
    "these systematic shifts can be significantly reduced in future measurements .",
    "for example , in the optical clocks this effect is eliminated by the injection locked slave laser .",

    "[ fig : zest ] and table [ tab : hyp ] show that while there is a good agreement of all previous measurements of the a hyperfine constants and isotope shift of the 5s-7s transition , the absolute frequency measurements agree within the expanded uncertainties only with the values given in refs .",
