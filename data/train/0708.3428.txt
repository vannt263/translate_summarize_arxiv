    "= .45 cm during the last fifty years many papers have been written on the calculation of the casimir energy . in this paper",
    "we introduce a new approach in regards to the renormalization program .",
    "we found it most suitable to introduce our approach in the simplest example possible , i.e. a real scalar field confined between two parallel plates in 1 + 1 dimensions , with @xmath0 self - interaction .",
    "as we shall see , our results for the next to leading order term ( nlo ) are finite for both the massive and massless cases and this differs significantly from what exists in the literature .",
    "it is therefore suitable to start at the beginning . in 1948",
    "casimir found a simple yet profound explanation for the retarded van der waals interaction @xcite .",
    "after a short time , he and d. polder related this effect to the change in the zero point energy of the quantum fields due to the presence of nontrivial boundary conditions @xcite .",
    "this energy has since been called the casimir energy .",
    "the zero - order energy in perturbation theory has been calculated for various fields ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "also the nlo correction , which is usually called the first - order effect , has been computed for various fields . for the electromagnetic field",
    "this correction is said to be due to the following feynmann diagram , and has been computed first by bordag and collaborators @xcite .",
    "however , note that this correction is a two loop correction in this case and is @xmath1 .",
    "moreover the two - loop radiative corrections for some effective field theories have been investigated in @xcite .",
    "next , in the case of a real massive scalar field nlo correction to the energy has been computed in @xcite .",
    "this correction is a two loop correction in this case but is @xmath2 .",
    "moreover , n. graham _ et al _ used new approaches to this problem by utilizing the phase shift of the scattering states @xcite , or replacing the boundary conditions by an appropriate potential term @xcite .",
    "however , the authors use the free counterterms , by which we mean the ones that are relevant to the free cases with no nontrivial boundary conditions , and are obviously position independent . only in ref .",
    "@xcite the author notes that in certain cases , counterterms can depend on the distance between the plates .",
    "the first use of nontrivial boundary conditions for the renormalization programs in problems of this sort seems to be due to fosco and svaiter @xcite .",
    "these authors use free counterterms in the space between the plates and place additional surface counterterms at the boundaries . later on various authors proposed the use of exactly the same renormalization procedure for various physical problems @xcite . the first calculation for the nlo of casimir energy for the massive scalar field using this renormalization program",
    "is done in ref .",
    "we should note that their results for the massless limit in 1 + 1 dimensions , like those of @xcite , is infinite .",
    "it is also worth mentioning that all the papers on the analogous calculations of the nlo corrections to the mass of solitons , that we are aware , of use free counterterms ( see for example @xcite ) . in references @xcite",
    "the authors used the mode number cutoff introduced by r.f .",
    "dashen ( 1974 ) @xcite to calculate the nlo casimir energy due to the presence of solitons .    in this paper , we present a systematic approach to the renormalization program for problems which are amenable to renormalized perturbation theory , and contain either nontrivial boundary conditions or nontrivial ( position dependent ) backgrounds , e.g. solitons , or both",
    ". obviously all the n - point functions of the theory will have in general nontrivial position dependence in the coordinate representation .",
    "this is one of the manifestations of the breaking of the translational symmetry .",
    "the procedure to deduce the counterterms from the n - point functions in a renormalized perturbation theory is standard and has been available for over half a century .",
    "using this , as we shall show , we will inevitably obtain position dependent counterterms .",
    "therefore , the radiative corrections to all the input parameters of the theory , including the mass , will be in general position dependent .",
    "therefore , we believe the information about the nontrivial boundary conditions or position dependent backgrounds are carried by the full set of n - point functions , the resulting counterterms , and the renormalized parameters of the theory .",
    "our preliminary investigations have revealed that our position dependent counterterms approach the free ones when the distance between the plates is large .",
    "their main difference is for positions which are about a compton wavelength away from the walls , although it is also nontrivial at other places .",
    "here we use this procedure to compute the first - order radiation correction to the casimir energy for a real scalar field in 1 + 1 dimensions .",
    "we compute this correction for both a massive and a massless scalar fields and show that the massless limit of the massive case exactly corresponds to the massless case .",
    "in addition , up to now all the papers on the casimir effect , that we are aware of , use some from of _ analytic continuation_.",
    "we share the point of view with some authors such as the ones in @xcite that the analytic continuation techniques are not always completely justified physically .",
    "moreover , like the first of the aforementioned authors , we have found counterexamples , which we point out in this paper and elsewhere @xcite .",
    "the counterexamples show that it alone might not yield correct physical results , and sometimes even gives infinite results @xcite .",
    "therefore , we prefer to use a completely physical approach by enclosing the whole system in a box of linear size @xmath3 , which eventually can go to infinity , and calculating the difference between the zero point energies of two different configurations .",
    "the main idea of this method is actually due to t.h .",
    "boyer @xcite , who used spheres instead of boxes .",
    "this we shall call the  box renormalization scheme \" and can be used as a supplementary part of other usual regularization or renormalization programs .",
    "this box renormalization scheme , has the following advantages :    1 .",
    "use of this procedure removes all of the ambiguities associated with the appearance of the infinities , and we use the usual prescription for removing the infinities in the regulated theory , as explained in sec .",
    "[ massive case ] .",
    "this is all done without resorting to any analytic continuation schemes .",
    "the infrared divergences which generically appear in these problems in 1 + 1 dimensions automatically cancel each other .",
    "3 .   in order to calculate the casimir energy",
    "we subtract two physical configuration of similar nature , e.g. both confined within finite regions , and not one confined and the other in an unbounded region .",
    "this method can be used as a check for the cases where analytic continuation yields finite results , and more importantly , can be used to obtain finite results when the former yields infinite results .",
    "we should mention that some authors believe that use of box regularization or renormalization procedures , in which the size of the box eventually goes to infinity could be avoided by using appropriate boundary conditions on the fields at spatial infinity @xcite    in section [ sec2 ] we calculate the leading order term for the casimir energy in @xmath4 space dimensional case .",
    "we do this first of all to explain more completely the physical content of the problem and set up our notations .",
    "secondly this computation is just about as easy as to do in @xmath4 dimensions as is in the one dimensional case . in section [ sec3 ]",
    "we compute the first order radiative correction to this energy . in order to do this we first state the renormalization conditions , and then derive expressions for the the first order radiative corrections for both the massive and massless cases .",
    "we show that the results for the massless limit of the massive case and the massless case are equal . in section [ sec4 ]",
    "we summarize our results and state our conclusions .",
    "the lagrangian density for a real scalar field with @xmath0 self - interaction is : @xmath5^{2}-\\frac{1}{2}m_0^{2}\\varphi(x)^{2 }    -\\frac{\\lambda_{0}}{4!}\\varphi(x)^{4},\\ ] ] where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the bare mass and bare coupling constant , respectively .",
    "here we calculate the leading term for the casimir energy in @xmath4 spatial dimensions .",
    "obviously the leading term , in contrast to the higher order corrections , is independent of the form of the self - interaction .",
    "the casimir energy is in general equivalent to the work done on the system for bringing two parallel plates from @xmath8 to @xmath9 . as mentioned before , part of our renormalization procedure is to enclos the whole system in a @xmath4 dimensional cubical box of sides @xmath3 . to compute this leading term , we first compare the energies in two different configurations : when the plates are at @xmath9 as compare to @xmath10 .",
    "we name the axis perpendicular to the plates the @xmath11 axis . to keep the expressions symmetrical",
    ", we choose the coordinates so that the edges of the confining box are at @xmath12 in any direction .     the geometry of the two different configurations whose energies are to be compared . the labels a1 , _ etc .",
    "_ denote the appropriate sections in each configuration separated by the plates.,width=264 ]    the total zero point energy of the upper configuration in figure ( [ geometry ] ) will be called @xmath13 and of the lower one @xmath14 . in our box renormalization scheme we need to define the casimir energy as follows    @xmath15,\\ ] ]    where , @xmath16 here we choose the dirichlet boundary condition on the plates .",
    "then we can expand the field operator @xmath17 in the eigenstate basis appropriate to this boundary condition , and its explicit second quantized form , for example in region @xmath18 becomes @xmath19\\textbf{a}_{n}+\\nonumber\\\\     & & \\dd e^{i(\\omega_{a_1,n}t-\\mathbf{k^{\\bot}}\\textbf{. }     \\mathbf{x}^{\\bot})}\\sin\\left[k_{a_1,n}(z+\\frac{a}{2})\\right ]     \\textbf{a}_{n}^{\\dag}\\bigg\\},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where , @xmath20 here @xmath21 and @xmath22 denote the momenta parallel and perpendicular to plates ( in z - direction ) , respectively .",
    "also @xmath23 and @xmath24 are creation and annihilation operators obeying the usual commutation relations : @xmath25=\\delta_{n , n^{_\\prime}},\\quad [ \\textbf{a}_{n},\\textbf{a}_{n^{_\\prime}}]=[\\textbf{a}^{\\dag}_{n } , \\textbf{a}^{\\dag}_{n^{_\\prime}}]=0,\\ ] ] and @xmath26 defines the vacuum state in the presence of boundary conditions . using the above equations one can easily obtain @xmath27 where @xmath28 denotes the usual free hamiltonian density , easily obtained from the lagrangian density , and the superscript @xmath29 denotes the zero ( or leading ) order term of this energy .",
    "also @xmath30 , and @xmath31 is the solid angle in d - dimensions .",
    "therefore , @xmath32 where , @xmath33 now we are allowed to use the abel - plana summation formula , since we now expect the summand to satisfy the strict conditions @xcite for the validity of this formula .",
    "that is , we expect any reasonable renormalization program for calculating any measurable physical quantity to yield finite results .",
    "the abel - plana summation formula gives @xmath34,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath35 vanishes in this case due to our box renormalization .",
    "the second term in the bracket , using suitable changes of variables , becomes    @xmath36    where @xmath37 for example in the first term denotes @xmath38 , obviously treated as a continuous variable .",
    "the above calculation shows that this term is exactly zero .",
    "therefore , only the branch - cut term ( the last term in eq .",
    "( [ e8:main ] ) ) gives nonzero contribution and the final result is @xmath39}{(\\frac{l - a}{2})^{^{(d-1)/2 } } }     -\\frac{2k_{_{(d+1)/2}}[(l - b)jm_0]}{(\\frac{l - b}{2})^{^{(d-1)/2}}}\\right\\}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath40 denotes the modified bessel function of order @xmath41 . using eq .",
    "( [ e2:e.cas . ] ) for the casimir energy and noting that @xmath40 is strongly damped as @xmath42 goes to infinity , only the first term remains when the limits are taken , and the result is @xmath43 if we set @xmath44 , we have @xmath45 with the following limits , @xmath46 the results are in agreement with what exists in literature ( see for instance @xcite ) .",
    "it is interesting to note that for the massless case , the result is , not surprisingly , exactly half of the corresponding expression for the electromagnetic case .    for the @xmath47 case , eq .",
    "( [ e11:res.z.term ] ) becomes @xmath48 and its limits are @xmath49 it is interesting to note that if we solve the massless case exactly the branch - cut terms simplify to give @xmath50 which is identical with our result for the massless limit , and is reported for example , in refs .",
    "now we calculate the next to the leading order ( two loop quantum correction ) shift of the casimir energy for a scalar field in @xmath51 theory using the renormalized perturbation theory in @xmath52 dimensions . as mentioned before",
    ", the main idea of our work is that when a systematic treatment of the renormalization program is done , the counterterms needed to retain the renormalization conditions , automatically turn out to be position dependent .",
    "this , as we shall see , will have profound consequences .",
    "however , our main scheme of canceling the divergences using counterterms and a few input experimental parameters , is in complete conformity with the standard renormalization approach . to set the stage for the calculations , we shall very briefly state the renormalization procedure and conditions .      the @xmath51 lagrangian eq.([e1 ] ) , after rescaling the field @xmath53 , where @xmath54 is called the field strength renormalization , and the standard procedure for setting up the renormalized perturbation theory , becomes ( see for example @xcite ) , @xmath55^{2}-\\frac{1}{2}m^{2 }     \\varphi_{r}(x)^{2}-\\frac{\\lambda}{4!}\\varphi_{r}(x)^{4}\\qquad\\nonumber\\\\&&\\hspace{1cm}+     \\frac{1}{2}\\delta_{z}[\\partial_{\\mu}\\varphi_{r}(x)]^{2 }     -\\dd\\frac{1}{2}\\delta_{m}\\varphi_{r}(x)^{2}-\\dd\\frac{\\delta_{\\lambda}}{4!}\\varphi_{r}(x)^{4},\\nonumber\\\\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath56 are the counterterms , and @xmath57 and @xmath58 are the physical mass and physical coupling constant , respectively . in this problem",
    "we are to impose boundary conditions on the field at the walls .",
    "an alternative approach would be to add appropriate external potentials to the lagrangian so as to maintain the boundary conditions on the fields .",
    "we will use the first approach .",
    "obviously the presence of nontrivial boundary conditions breaks the translational invariance and hence momenta will no longer be good quantum numbers",
    ". therefore we find it easier to impose the renormalization conditions in the configuration space .",
    "for example , the standard expression for the two - point function is , @xmath59 since the birth of quantum field theory , as far as we know , the assertion has always been that the above expressions can be expanded systematically when the problem is amenable to perturbation theory .",
    "for example , in the context of renomalized perturbation theory , as indicated in eq.([e17 ] ) , we can symbolically represent the first few terms of the perturbation expansion of eq.([2pfun . ] ) by @xmath60 where refers to the appropriate counterterm .",
    "it is obvious that the above expression represents a systematic perturbation expansion , and most importantly , all of the propagators on the right hand side should be the one appropriate to the problem under consideration , that is they should have the same overall functional form as the first term .",
    "our first renormalization condition is that the renormalized mass @xmath57 should be the pole of the propagator represented by the first term in ( [ e18:renor.con1 . ] ) .",
    "this implies the second and third diagrams should cancel each other out in the lowest order , and this in turn implies the cancelation of the uv divergences in that order , and that the counterterms will in general turn out to be position dependent .",
    "the renormalized mass @xmath57 will naturally turn out to be position dependent as well .",
    "however , we only need to fix the value of @xmath61 at one position between the plates by our renormalization condition .",
    "the exact functional dependence of @xmath61 will then be completely determined by the theory .",
    "that is , we insist the overall structure of the renormalization conditions such as above , and the counterterms appearing in them should be determined solely from within the theory , and not for example be imported from the free case .",
    "the equations are self deterministic and there is no need to take such actions . obviously we still need a few experimental input parameters for the complete renormalization program , such as @xmath61 for some @xmath42 .",
    "analogous expression and reasonings could be easily stated for the four - point function .    to one - loop order the renormalization conditions derived from eq .",
    "( [ e18:renor.con1 . ] ) and its four - point counterpart , are @xmath62 respectively . here",
    "@xmath63 is the propagator of the real scalar field and @xmath64 .",
    "obviously the counterterms automatically incorporate the boundary conditions and are position dependent , due to the dependence of the two and four - point functions on such quantities .",
    "now , the higher order contributions to the vacuum energy in the interval a1 ( i.e. @xmath65 $ ] ) is @xmath66 where@xmath67 and @xmath68 $ ] refer to the counterterms .",

    "then , after the usual wick rotation , the the expression for the green s function in the two dimensional euclidean space becomes @xmath73\\sin     \\left[k_{a_1,n}(z'+\\frac{a}{2})\\right]}{\\omega^{2}+k_{a_1,n}^{2 }     + m^{2}}.\\nonumber\\\\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] using eq .",

    "however , proper regularization schemes should still be implemented and proper care taken when handling these infinite expressions .",
    "for example , the summation appearing in the squared form in the first term of the last part of eq.([e25:e.bet.plats ] ) is infinite .",
    "we want to use the abel - plana formula to convert this sum into an integral .",
    "however this sum does not satisfy the stringent requirements stated in the abel - plana theorem for such a conversion @xcite .",
    "however our box renormalization scheme provides a solution : we first expand the square as a double sum",
    ". then we subtract these double sums as indicated in eq .",
    "( [ e26:box - reg . ] ) .",
    "now we can expect this new summand to satisfy the requirements for the abel - plana theorem . then all the infinities actually cancel and the result for the two - loop correction reduces to ( see appendix for details ) :    @xmath77,\\nonumber\\\\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]",
    "where , @xmath78 and @xmath79 , defined by the following expression @xmath80 refers to the so called branch - cut term in the abel - plana summation formula and is a finite quantity . note that the last integral in eq .",
    "( [ e27:corr.cas.e ] ) seems to diverge so it must be properly regularized , and this crucially depends on our box renormalization program , as we shall explain below .",
    "however , before we engage in this calculation , we want to raise an important point : if we were to use the free counterterm in eq .",
    "( [ e22:vacc - ene ] ) , as is routinely done , this term would be absent , in addition to some minor differences .",
    "therefore , one would easily obtain finite results which we like to dispute .",
    "now let us proceed with our calculations .",
    "we prefer to use a regularization scheme for this integral term which is analogous to the zeta function regularization for the sums .",
    "that is , in that expression we set the power of the integrand to @xmath81 for the first two terms and @xmath82 for the remaining terms . in the final stage",
    "we let @xmath83 and @xmath84 approach zero .",
    "hence we will have @xmath85 for @xmath83 and @xmath84 sufficiently small , this expression becomes @xmath86 now , if @xmath87 the infinities cancel .",
    "the cancelation of these divergent quantities without any residual finite terms is the usual prescription in regulated theories and this is what we have used . ) .",
    "what is almost invariably done is to adjust the regulators so that the singular terms exactly cancel each other , i.e. without extracting any extra finite piece from the difference between the infinite quantities ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "this is also apparent in the leading term for the casimir energy in eq .",
    "( [ e9:sec.term ] ) where , as explained in the appendix , the four changes of variables are equivalent to choosing four different cutoffs .",
    "one could have adjusted them so that as usual the infinities cancel , but any finite term would remain . however , the well known answer is obtained only when there is no remaining extra finite term in this subtraction scheme . this is the prescription that we have used .",
    "however , we do believe that this is a subject that needs further study . ] therefore the term in question becomes , @xmath88 this result is obviously finite , and we believe it could not have been obtained with any regularization or analytic continuation schemes in common use , other than our box renormalization program .",
    "thus , eq .  ( [ e27:corr.cas.e ] ) becomes @xmath89,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath90 .",
    "this is the two - loop radiative correction for the work done on the plates ( or two points in this case ) while moving them from @xmath91 to @xmath92 .",

    "this is in contrast to the view expressed in for example refs.@xcite .",
    "this is yet another important counterexample for the validity of analytic continuation : as is well known the massless limit of the analytic continuation of the mass counterterm in @xmath0 theory is zero for space - time dimension bigger than two .",

    "in general this breaking of the translational invariance , is reflected in the nontrivial position dependence of all the n - point functions .",

    "obviously we still need a few experimental input parameters for the complete renormalization program , such as @xmath61 for some @xmath42 .",

    "for the zero order , our results are identical with what exists in the literature . however , our first order results are markedly different from those reported in refs.@xcite .",

    "this is our second main difference in approach to the problem . as mentioned before , we believe that @xmath114 should not be arbitrarily set to zero even in the massless case , since in that case the renormalization conditions can no longer be fully implemented , although the theory is still in principle renormalizable .",
