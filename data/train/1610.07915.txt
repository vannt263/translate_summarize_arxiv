    "input lines are heavily attenuated and filtered using reflective low - pass and lossy eccosorb filters @xcite .",
    "we used three microwave sources , two for the qubits ( a and b respectively ) and one for readout .",
    "the upper and lower band frequencies for each qubit was generated using sideband modulation technique where the local oscillators ( lo ) for the iq mixers were set to the mean frequency : @xmath35 .",
    "the quadrature ( i and q ) modulating signals ( at frequency @xmath36 ) were generated using a 1 gs / s arbitrary waveform generator ( awg ) with 300 mhz analog bandwidth .",
    "the amplitude and phase of these signals were optimized to create either a single tone ( @xmath16 or @xmath37 ) signal for conditional rotations or a multi - tone signal ( @xmath16 and @xmath37 ) for qubit selective rotations .",
    "the signal strengths on each band for a given qubit were adjusted to provide identical pulse lengths for a given rotation angle .",
    "we used gaussian - edge , flat - top pulses to have a good balance between pulse bandwidth and pulse lengths .",
    "one particular advantage of this technique is the simple control of rotation axis by adjusting the phase of the modulating signal in software .",
    "additionally , any rotation of the qubit about z - axis does nt require a separate gate and can be included by modifying the rotation axis of subsequent pulses .",
    "one important detail in this technique is to ensure that the phase difference between the upper and lower band tones for qubit a must be identical to that of qubit b. this difference can arise due to unequal cable lengths at the rf output of iq mixers before they are combined and sent to the device .",
    "however , this phase difference can be easily compensated by adjusting the phase of the quadrature modulating signals as well .",
    "this technique can easily be extended for a three qubit system where four tones per qubit would be generated using appropriate modulating signals .",
    "in the trimon with identical josephson junctions , only qubit a couples to the cavity with coupling strength @xmath38 . in order to estimate the spurious coupling of qubits b and c to the cavity ( @xmath39 and @xmath40 ) due to junction asymmetries , we used the data shown in fig .",

    "the relative coupling strengths of the different qubits to the transmon can be used as a rough estimate for their relative coupling strengths to the cavity .",
    "we obtain @xmath41 and @xmath42 which are small enough to ensure that the relaxation time for qubits b and c is not limited by the purcell effect @xcite provided their transition frequencies are not too close to the cavity s resonance .",
    "the relatively small coupling of the qubits b and c to the cavity makes it very difficult to couple power into those qubits and is the primary reason behind our gate pulse lengths being relatively long . it should be possible to carefully tailor the power coupling by introducing controlled asymmetry in the junctions or by redesigning port configuration on the cavity .",
    "the large power required to drive qubit c also resulted in a strong ac stark shift @xcite and prevented us from obtaining a clear hahn echo signal ( see table i in the main text ) .",
    "the two qubit states @xmath43 residing in a 4-dimensional hilbert space are represented by the basis , @xmath44 with the @xmath45-plane conditioned when a@xmath46 ( lower band ) and a@xmath47 ( upper band ) are given by , @xmath48 similarly controlled rotations for qubit a conditional on the state of qubit b are given by , @xmath49 these rotations can be used to implement generic two - qubit controlled unitary gates . the conventional cnot gate ( up to a @xmath12 phase ) becomes a special case of these controlled rotations , namely , @xmath50 and @xmath51 where @xmath52 denotes rotation about x - axis .",
    "for a two - qubit system the density matrix ( @xmath53 ) can be constructed by a set of 16 linearly independent operators @xmath54 : @xmath55 the goal of tomography is to determine the set of coefficients @xmath56 from the expectation values of the observables @xmath54 .",

    "the generic form of our two qubit joint measurement operator can be written as:@xcite @xmath65 since our measurement operator involves both one and two qubit observables , the complete set of independent observables can be obtained by applying single qubit rotations prior to the measurements@xcite .",
    "we have used standard maximum likelihood estimation ( mle ) technique @xcite to reconstruct the density matrices .",
    "mle searches in the parameter space of all physical density matrices and finds the density matrix @xmath53 which is most likely to have produced the observed experimental data @xmath66 by constructing the `` likelihood functional '' .",

    "our goal is then to maximize this function with respect to the parameters @xmath78 .    in our setup , the measurement is implemented by sending a microwave pulse at the cavity frequency .",
    "the signal transmitted through the cavity acquires a phase shift which is dependent on the joint state of the two qubits .",
    "this signal is first amplified by a near - quantum limited ljpa @xcite followed by more amplification using a cryogenic ( 4k ) hemt amplifier and a room temperature low noise amplifier .",
    "the amplified signal is then demodulated using homodyne technique and digitized .",
