    "studies of broad emission line spectra for agn provide both the strongest constraint on models for the nebular physics and kinematic models of the broad line emitting clouds .",
    "ideally one would like to have both high signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) and moderate resolution ( 5  ) measures for the strongest high and low ionization lines as well as measures across as wide a wavelength range as possible in order to better characterize the continuum shape .",
    "the former measures have led to the eigenvector 1 parameter space concept ( sulentic et al .",
    "2000a , b ) that is , in part , built upon foundations laid almost ten years ago ( boroson & green 1992 ; hereafter bg92 ) .",
    "the above goals are very observing time intensive but recent agn surveys have provided an alternate method for examining quasar spectra from 1000  10000  . average or composite spectra derived from large survey databases involving hundreds of agn ( lbqs : francis et al .",
    "1991 ; hst : zheng et al . 1997 ; 1998 ; first : brotherton et al . 2001",
    "; sloan survey : vanden berk et al .",
    "2001 ) make it possible to generate a `` typical '' quasar spectrum from blueward of ly@xmath2  to .",
    "what is unclear is whether such composite spectra are astrophysically useful beyond , perhaps , allowing us to identify lines that are too weak to be seen in individual source spectra .",
    "the fundamental question is whether the similarities or the differences in agn line and continuum phenomenology tell us more about the underlying physics .",
    "the eigenvector 1 concept has been advanced as a possible  h - r diagram \" for agn in the sense that it appears to provide parameter space discrimination between all major classes of broad line sources as well as a correlation for , at least , radio quiet sources ( sulentic et al .",
    "the correlation and distribution of radio - quiet sources ( with fwhm()@xmath3 4000 ) in e1 have been reasonably well fit with a model that sees accretion rate , convolved with source orientation , as the principal physical driver ( marziani et al .",
    "the generality of e1 , of course , requires much further testing but unless it is far off the mark , it suggests that average or composite spectra should be viewed in the same way that one would view an average stellar spectrum taken over the full effective temperature range that is observed in the h - r diagram ( spectral types o - m ) .",
    "interpretation of composite spectra from heterogeneous samples will be complicated in two ways : ( 1 ) they will be subject to selection biases dependent on the relative number of sources with each `` spectra type '' in a given sample and , more significantly , ( 2 ) they will average the spectra of sources with dramatically different physical properties .",
    "we suggest that the most useful approach to averaging agn spectra lies within the e1 context .",
    "we present average spectra for fixed domain quadrants in e1 followed by a brief discussion of important differences .",
    "the emphasis is on the fwhm ( ) measures although large differences in the equivalent width parameter are also seen .",
    "full discussion of the equivalent width differences must wait for significant numbers of very high s / n measures for  weak sources .",
    "our current sample includes optical spectra for 187 sources obtained between 1988 and 1996 .",
    "they cover the wavelength range that includes , , and most of the optical  emission ( 4200 - 5700   in the rest frame ) .",
    "spectra were obtained with the following telescopes and spectrographs : eso 1.5 m ( b&ch ) , san pedro martir 2.2 m ( b&ch ) , calar alto 2.2 m ( b&ch ) , kpno 2.2 m ( gold ) , and mount ekar ( asiago ) 1.82 m ( b&ch ) .",
    "data for 52 objects can be found in marziani et al .",
    "( 1996 ) and the unpublished part of the dataset will appear in a forthcoming paper ( marziani et al .",
    "spectra were taken with very similar instrumental setups including typically 120 / mm dispersion and 2 arcsec slit width yielding resolution in the range 4 - 7   fwhm .",
    "the s / n is typically in the range @xmath4 20 - 30 .",
    "spectra with s / n @xmath0 10 were excluded .",
    "the sample includes spectra for 187 type 1 agn with redshifts z @xmath0 0.8 , @xmath5 16 .",
    "table 1 summarizes the properties of our data sample within the context of eigenvector 1 ( see  [ types ] for bin definition ) .",
    "composite spectra were obtained by taking the median of all spectra with 1binning . the s / n of the composite spectra was @xmath1 100 except for bin a3 where only 5 objects were available , and s / n@xmath450 .",
    "no composite spectra were obtained for the rare objects in the outlier domain ( fwhm()@xmath1 4000  and @xmath1 0.5 ) which spans several e1 bins .",
    "the following analysis procedures were applied to each spectrum ( see marziani et al .",
    "1996 for details ) .",
    "( 1 ) deredshifting using the narrow line component of , and/or  as rest frame measures . ( 2 )",
    "normalization using the best estimate for a local continuum at @xmath6 5100  .",
    "( 3 ) subtraction of  emission blends using a template based on the spectrum of izw1 which also yielded the feii blend equivalent width w ( ) . ( 4 ) subtraction of the  and  lines . ( 5 ) subtraction of the narrow component from  ( ) using a gaussian model . in cases",
    "where no clear inflection between broad and narrow components was seen , two alternative approaches were employed : ( a ) we assumed that fwhm ( ) @xmath4  fwhm ( ) or ( b ) we assumed that fwhm ( ) @xmath4  fwhm ( ) . the latter approach was useful for narrow line seyfert 1 sources . following these procedures we extracted  and derived equivalent width and fwhm measures which allowed us to populate e1 .",
    "host galaxy contamination was not significant for the luminous agn included in this sample .",
    "the typical uncertainty for fwhm ( ) is about 10% and for w ( ) and w ( ) about 10 - 15% .",
    "errors on  are estimated to be less than 0.2 .",
    "the distribution of 187 sources in the optical e1 plane ( fwhm ( ) vs. ) is shown in figure [ fehb ] .",
    "we binned the optical parameter plane as shown in figure 1 and as defined in table 1 .",
    "the bins were arbitrarily set to constant @xmath7 fwhm ( ) = 4000 , and @xmath7 = 0.5 .",
    "a finer subdivision is not warranted at this time by the accuracy of the measures or the heterogeneity of the data sample .",
    "the adopted a - b bin labeling reflects our earlier suggestion that two distinct radio - quiet agn populations may exist : pop . a ( `` pure '' radio - quiet ) and pop .",
    "b ( same as the radio - loud domain ; see table 1 ) .",
    "the numeral accompanying the letter designation for a bins reflects the increasing strength of .",
    "the `` + '' designations for b bins reflect increasing fwhm ( ) .",
    "there are many measures that distinguish between radio - quiet pop .",
    "a and b as defined with a boundary at fwhm ( ) @xmath4 4000 .",
    "there are also many measures that support a phenomenological commonality between population b and radio - loud sources ( sulentic et al . 2000a , b , c ) .",
    "table 1 summarizes the properties of domain space bins that are occupied by a significant number of sources .",
    "the composite ( median ) spectra after processing step 2 ( continuum normalized ) and after step 3 (  subtracted ) are presented in the left and right panels of figure 2 respectively .",
    "the median spectra are available in digital format on the world wide web .",
    "it is important to note that the e1 binned median spectra are unlikely to be strongly influenced by any luminosity dependence since : ( a ) there is , so far , no convincing evidence for a difference in line profile properties with source redshift / luminosity ( sulentic et al .",
    "2000a ) and ( b ) for any sub - sample , @xmath8  ( see table 1 ) .",
    "it is also worth noting that the median @xmath9  of our sources is close to the limit separating seyfert 1 galaxies and quasars ( @xmath9=-23.0 ) .",
    "this should not be considered a particular problem because there is no discontinuity in the agn luminosity distribution .",
    "radio - loud sources in our sample show a higher mean luminosity perhaps due to the inclusion of many beamed sources but pop .",
    "b radio - quiet sources , co - spatial with them in e1 , are not more luminous than pop . a radio - quiet sources .",
    "our w ( ) uncertainty estimate (  [ anal ] ) is valid if  is clearly detected above the noise .",
    "however , the minimum w ( ) for which it is possible to visually detect  depends both on s / n and on  fwhm . for s",
    "/ n @xmath10 20 . upper limits for  detection is estimated to be @xmath4 14 , 17 , 20  for fwhm = 2500 , 5000 , 7500  respectively .",
    "the utility of the composite spectra is also evident because of the much higher s / n in bins b1 ( and b1@xmath11 ) , which contain many upper limits because is intrinsically weak in population b sources . in those bins it is possible to obtain more reliable w ( ) measurements from composite spectra .",
    "median spectra of the   profile are shown in fig .",
    "they were extracted from the median spectra after  and continuum subtraction to take advantage of the much higher s / n of the compositer spectra .",
    "we derived a pure  profile by first subtracting  and  and then fitting  with a high - order spline function to avoid the effects of finite s / n and to interpolate across the .",
    "this approach has proven to be successful for measuring line parameters in noisier line profiles ( marziani et al .",
    "it is preferable to template fitting because it makes no assumptions about the shape of the profile .",
    "table 1 presents fwhm ( ) as well as line centroids at 1/2 and 1/4 maximum intensities derived from the median spectra . the median  profiles in pop .",
    "a are almost symmetric with a slight blueward asymmetry in bin a2 .",
    "the blue asymmetry becomes visually apparent in bin a3 which contains sources that are extreme in many ways .",
    "table 1 shows that the profiles of nlsy1 do not differ from bin a1 and a2 median spectra .",
    "the smaller median fwhm  reflects an arbitrary cutoff ( @xmath32000 ) in the definition of nlsy1s .",
    "the profiles of pop . a sources are very different from those of pop .",
    "b. the median profiles of population b sources are red asymmetric with the strongest asymmetry in the ( few ) bin b1@xmath12 sources .",
    "the different shape may point towards different blr structure / kinematics in these sources .",
    "profile shape was not selected _ a priori _ in the population definition that was based on a possible fwhm ( ) break .",
    "an alternate way to describe profile asymmetry involves fitting a functional form to the median profiles .",
    "the  profile in nlsy1 sources is well fit by a lorentz function ( see also vron - cetty , v ' eron , & gonalves 2001 ) .",
    "the same is generally true for a1 and a2 median profiles while a3  is based on only five sources .",
    "a lorentzian function is definitely not a satisfactory description for bin b median profiles .",
    "the  profile is significantly different and this can be seen even in fig .",
    "[ aver2 ] .",
    "the profile becomes more gaussian but we were unable to fit bin b profiles with any simple and physically meaningful function .",
    "the best fits to  bin b1 and b1 + profiles required the sum of two gaussians : ( 1)_a fwhm@xmath4 4000 - 5000 unshifted gaussian core _ and _ ( 2 ) a broader fwhm@xmath4 10000redshifted ( @xmath13 ) gaussian base_. the main difference between b1 and b1@xmath11 may be related to the strength of the `` very broad component '' .",
    "we will show in the next section : ( 1 ) that many radio - loud and some radio - quiet pop .",
    "b sources show unambiguous very broad components and ( 2 ) that the interpretation of the profile in terms of two components may have a straightforward physical meaning .",
    "we find significant and systematic differences in median spectra across e1 .",
    "fwhm ( ) and  both show systematic changes and the other e1 parameters reinforce this dichotomy ( pop .",
    "a sources show a systematic blueshift of the civ@xmath141549 broad line profile and and a soft x - ray excess while pop .",
    "b source do not : sulentic 2000ab ) . pop .",
    "a sources show a more symmetric profile with the largest  values ( indicating large w ( ) and somewhat depressed w ( ) ) . as one enters the population b domain the radio - loud source fraction increases",
    ".   becomes increasingly broad and red asymmetric for both radio - loud and radio - quiet sources .",
    "overall nlsy1/pop . a spectra show lower ionization spectra than pop .",
    "b ( marziani et al . 2001 ) . comparison between high (: hil ) and low (: lil ) ionization emission lines suggests that they are emitted in disjoint regions in pop .",
    "a. contrarily , both lil and hil may arise from a single region in pop .",
    "b sources ( marziani et al . 1996 : sulentic et al .",
    "2000a , b ) .",
    "it is more accurate to say that we can not rule out the possibility that both hil and lil arise from the same line emitting regions ( broad and very broad ) in population b ( sulentic 2000a ) .",
    "the  profile analysis indicates that the blr  and specifically the region emitting the low ionization lines  is most probably structurally different in population a and population b sources .",
    "it is beyond the scope of the present paper to report on detailed model calculation .",
    "we note however that the lorentz profile is consistent with emission from an extended accretion disk .",
    "this reinforces the suggestion that the lil spectra in pop .",
    "a sources arise from a disk .",
    "the situation is less clear for pop .",
    "b sources where the eddington ratio may be much lower .",
    "there is good evidence that sometimes only one of the two emission components is present in pop .",
    "b sources ( pure blr or pure vblr ; see sulentic et al .",
    "2000c ) . in a companion paper",
    ", we suggest that even the narrow line region structure / kinematics may be changing along the e1 sequence ( zamanov et al .",
    "2002 ) .      can the double gaussian model that is needed to fit pop .",
    "b ( and radio - loud ) profiles be physically justified ?",
    "several lines of evidence point towards the existence of a very broad line region ( vblr ) at the inner edge of the blr ( corbin 1997a , b ) .",
    "emission from this region may be thought of as a sort of inner , large covering factor , `` boundary layer '' where gas begins to become optically thick ( marziani & sulentic 1993 ; sulentic et al .",
    "2000c ) . in objects like the luminous quasar",
    "pg 1416 - 129 , almost pure vblr emission survived after a continuum intensity decrease effectively quenched the classical blr .",
    "3c232 ( marziani et al .",
    "1996 ) may represent a good radio - loud analog of pg1416 .",
    "other examples of possible pure vblr line sources can be found in sulentic et al .",
    ".  has also been known for some time to show a profile systematically broader than  in some sources ( see osterbrock & shuder 1982 ) and this can be seen in figure 2 . unfortunately  is usually weak and/or blended with stronger  and feii emission ( it is on the red end of ) .",
    "detection of the  broad component is therefore a function of  strength and s / n",
    ". the strongest very broad feature is seen in the bin a1 median spectrum where we have a favorable combination of s / n ,  width ,  weakness and  strength .",
    "the latter bias reflects the inclusion of data from an observing run dedicated to studying strong  emission .",
    "a very broad  profile is sometimes seen in pop .",
    "a sources ( e.g. ton s 180 ) with much narrower .",
    "however , in i zw 1 , the highest s / n spectra fail to detect any trace of  emission . at this time",
    "the question of  emission must be considered on an object - by - object basis .",
    "we note that  strength was an orthogonal ( eigenvector 2 ) parameter in the principal component analysis of boroson & green ( 1992 ) .",
    "we generated average qso spectra in the 42005700   spectral region for fixed optical parameter bins in e1 . in fixed parameter range bins the mean spectral type appears to change systematically across e1 .",
    "this systematic behaviour is reflected in e1 x - ray and uv measures as well .",
    "composite spectra in an e1 context should provide useful input for theoretical modeling .",
