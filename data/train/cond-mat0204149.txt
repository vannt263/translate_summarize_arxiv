    "the scope of problems dealing with construction of knot and link invariants as well as study of entropy of random knots belongs to this field .    in this paper",
    "the modern methods of algebraic topology are used to argue for the nontrivial fractal structure of unknotted polymer ring in a compact state .",
    "namely , we show that the condition for the whole knot to be trivial implies that each part of such knot in the compact state is almost unknotted .",
    "let us remind that the non - phantomness of polymer chains causes two types of interactions : a ) volume interactions , vanishing for infinitely thin chains , and b ) topological interactions , remaining even for chains of zero thickness . for sufficiently high temperatures",
    "the polymer macromolecule is strongly fluctuating system without reliable thermodynamic state .",
    "however for temperatures below some critical value @xmath6 the macromolecule forms a dense drop  like weakly fluctuating globular structure @xcite . in classical works @xcite devoted to investigation of coil  to",
    " globule phase transition without topological constraints it has been shown , that for @xmath7 the globular state can be described in virial approximation , i.e. using only two and three  body interaction constants : @xmath8 and @xmath9 ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the approach developed in @xcite is considered as the basis of the modern statistical theory of collapsed state of polymer systems .    in the globular phase of unknotted macromolecule the topological constraints",
    "play a role of an additional repulsion .",
    "one might expect that the parts of the unknotted chain deeply penetrate each other by loops as it is shown in fig.[fig:0]a .",
    "however this is not true and in the paper @xcite it has been shown that the absence of knots on densely packed polymer ring causes very unusual fractal properties of the chain trajectory strongly affecting all the thermodynamic properties of the macromolecule in the globular phase .",
    "the corresponding structure of a collapsed unknotted polymer ring was named `` crumpled '' fractal globule .",
    "the chain trajectory in the crumpled globule densely fills the volume such that all parts of the chain become segregated from each other in a broad region of scales  see fig.[fig:0 ] .",
    "hence , the line path in a crumpled globule reminds the well known peano curve @xcite schematically shown in fig.[fig:0]c .    experimental examination of a fractal structure of unknotted polymer ring is a very difficult problem .",
    "some measurements can be interpreted as the indirect verification of the crumpled globule structure : a two  stage dynamics of a collapse of a linear macromolecule after abrupt change of a solvent quality @xcite and the effect of compatibility enhancement in a melt of linear and ring macromolecules @xcite .",
    "however now there was no direct observation of crumpled globule structure in equilibrium globular polymer chains .",
    "we show below that the investigation of distribution of random knots over the topological classes and analysis of topological correlations in trivial knots helps one to understand the structure of the phase space of unknotted polymer in a globule phase and validate the crumpled globule conjecture `` from the first principle '' .",
    "below we express the arguments in support of the crumpled globule on the basis of direct determination of the topological state of a _ part _ of a polymer chain under the condition that the chain as a whole forms an unknotted loop . in our work we use some modern methods of construction of topological knot invariants @xcite applied for solution of specific statistical problems @xcite .",
    "first of all one has to define the topological state of a part of a ring polymer chain .",
    "certainly , the mathematically rigorous definition of the topological state exists for closed or infinite paths .",
    "nevertheless , the everyday s experience tells us that open but sufficiently long rope can be knotted .",
    "hence , it is desirable to introduce the concept of a _ quasi  knot _ available for topological description of open paths .",
    "for the first time that idea in the polymer context had been formulated by i.m .",
    "lifshits and a.yu .",
    "grosberg @xcite .",
    "they argued that the topological state of a linear polymer chain in a globular state is defined much better than topological state of a coil .",
    "actually , the distance between the ends of the chain in a globule is of order @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is a size of a monomer and @xmath12 is a number of monomers in a chain . taking into account that @xmath13 is sufficiently smaller than the contour length @xmath12 and that the density fluctuations are negligible",
    ", we may define the topological state of a path in a globule as a topological state of composition of a chain itself and a segment connecting its ends .",
    "this composite structure can be regarded as a quasi ",
    "knot for an open chain in a globular state . later on we shall repeatedly use this definition .",
    "let us describe the model under consideration .",
    "the crumpled globule is modeled by `` dense '' knots .",
    "we call the knot `` dense '' if its projection onto the plane fully fills the rectangle lattice @xmath14 of size @xmath15  see fig.[fig:1a ] .",
    "the lattice @xmath14 is filled densely by a single thread , which crosses itself in each vertex of the lattice in two different ways : `` above '' or `` below '' .",
    "the topology of a knot is defined by `` above '' and `` below '' passages with prescribed boundary conditions .",
    "the `` woven carpet '' shown in fig.[fig:1a ] corresponds to a trivial knot .",
    "let use enumerate the vertices of the lattice by the index @xmath16 and attribute to each vertex the variable @xmath17 according to the rule :    = 1.00 mm    ( 110.00,20.00 ) ( 10.00,10.00)(1,0)8.00 ( 22.00,10.00)(1,0)8.00 ( 20.00,0.00)(0,1)20.00 ( 80.00,10.00)(1,0)20.00 ( 90.00,0.00)(0,1)8.00 ( 90.00,12.00)(0,1)8.00 ( 40.00,10.00)(0,0)[cc]@xmath18 ( 110.00,10.00)(0,0)[cc]@xmath19    our task can be rephrased now as follows .",
    "we have an ensemble of randomly generated crossings @xmath20 @xmath21 independent in all vertices under the condition that the total set of crossings @xmath20 defines a trivial knot .",
    "we call this initial knot the `` parent '' one .",
    "if @xmath22 for all @xmath23 $ ] then the knot is trivial . changing the sign for some @xmath17 from `` @xmath24 '' to `` @xmath25 '' we can get a nontrivial knot .",
    "later we shall call such change of a sign `` impurity '' , so @xmath26 is concentration of impurities .",
    "let us cut a part of the parent trivial knot closing the open ends of the threads as it is shown in fig.[fig:1a ] . this way we get the well  defined `` daughter '' quasi  knot .",
    "below we study the typical topological state of such daughter quasi ",
    "knots under the condition that the parent knot is trivial .    the model under consideration is oversimplified because it does not take into account the spatial fluctuations of a path of a polymer chain in a knot .",
    "however we believe that our model well describes the globular ( condensed ) structure of a polymer ring where the chain fluctuations are essentially suppressed and the polymer has reliable thermodynamic structure with almost constant density @xcite .",
    "in our work we characterize the topological state of the knot by its jones ",
    "kauffman polynomial invariant @xcite .",
    "recall that the kauffman invariant of variable @xmath27 is a jones polynomial of variable @xmath28 @xcite .    in brief",
    "the procedure of construction of the algebraic knot invariant is as follows .",
    "let us construct the `` potts lattice '' @xmath29 corresponding to the `` knot lattice '' @xmath14see fig.[fig:1b]b .    in fig.[fig:1b]a positions of potts spins are depicted by circles .",
    "introduce the set of variables @xmath30 on the bonds of the potts lattice as follows : [ eqbb ] b_i , j= \\ {    cl -_k , & + _ k , &    .",
    "we can treat @xmath31 and @xmath32 as `` ferromagnetic '' and `` antiferromagnetic '' bonds , because changing a sign @xmath30 means changing a sign of the coupling constant @xmath33 .",
    "let us note , that even for the trivial knot we have antiferromagnetic bonds on the potts lattice  see fig.[fig:1b]a and fig.[fig:1b]b , c .",
    "we should stress that in our terms the `` impurity '' means not an antiferromagnetic bond , but just the change of the sign of a bond with respect to the trivial knot . in fig.[fig:1b]b and fig.[fig:1b]c the ferromagnetic @xmath31 and antiferromagnetic @xmath32 bonds are shown by solid and dashed lines correspondingly .",
    "in @xcite it has been explicitly shown that the jones knot invariant @xmath34 of variable @xmath35 of ambiently isotopic knots on the lattice @xmath14 can be expressed as a partition function of the potts model on the lattice @xmath29 : [ eqkp2 ] f_k(x,\\{b_i , j})=k ( x,\\{b_i , j } ) z(q(x),\\{j_i , j(b_i , j , x ) } ) where [ eqh ] k(x,\\{b_i , j } ) = ( - - ) ^-(n_p+1 ) ( - ) ^ _ \\ { i , j } b_i , j is a trivial prefactor , independent on potts spins and @xmath36 is a total number of potts spins .    the potts partition function @xmath37 defined in ( [ eqkp2 ] ) reads : [ eqpb ] z(q(x),\\{j_i , j(b_i , j , x)})=_\\ { } ( _ \\{i , j } ( _ i,_j ) ) where the coupling constant @xmath33 and the number of spin states @xmath38 are : [ eqjq ] = ( -x^b_i , j ) , q = x+2+x^-1 the specific property of the partition function ( [ eqpb ] ) consists in the relation between the temperature @xmath39 and the number of the potts spins states , @xmath38 , so the variables @xmath39 and @xmath38 can not be considered as independent quantities . later on",
    "we shall be interested in the largest power of the jones polynomial invariant , hence we forget about specific physical sense of the parameters @xmath35 , @xmath39 , and @xmath33 .    in the paper @xcite we have investigated semi  numerically the probability @xmath40 that among @xmath41 possible realizations of the disorder",
    "@xmath42 one can find a knot in a specific topological state defined by the jones ",

    "each topological type of a knot is characterized by polynomial invariant @xmath34 .",

    "the power @xmath2 of the polynome @xmath34 : [ eq : exp ] n=_|x| for trivial knots @xmath46 ; as the knot becomes more complex , @xmath2 grows up to its maximal value @xmath47 .",
    "certainly , the lack of our description consists in the fact that @xmath2 is rather rough characteristic and one can not distinguish `` topologically similar '' knots",
    ". however the discrimination of the topological state of knots ( or links ) by the power @xmath2 of a corresponding polynome enables us to introduce a `` metric '' in the phase space of topological states and , hence , to compare the knots .",
    "in this section by numerical and analytical methods we investigate the typical topological state of a part of a `` parent '' knot under the condition that the parent knot is trivial .",
    "in fact , we slightly modify the very problem as soon as we characterize the topological state of the knot by the power @xmath2 of its algebraic polynome .",
    "namely , we study topological correlations not only in trivial knots , but in all knots characterized by zero s power of the knot polynome as well",
    ". there are some non - trivial knots among a variety of knots with @xmath46 , but the complexity of such non - trivial knots is not high .",
    "we could say that the knots with @xmath46 are `` about trivial '' .    in our numerical investigation we restrict ourselves to topological correlations in knots represented by strips of sizes @xmath48 , where @xmath49 is the width ( @xmath50 ) and @xmath4 is the length of the strip .",
    "we consider essentially asymmetric distribution of crossings , namely with @xmath51 .",
    "remind that @xmath52 corresponds to the single configuration of crossings representing the trivial knot .",
    "the power of the polynomial invariant characterizes the complexity of a knot .",
    "hence , according to ( [ eq : exp ] ) and definition of kauffman invariant as potts partition function , the power @xmath2 has a sense of a free energy .",
    "thus , for long strips ( @xmath53 ) neglecting the boundary effects produced by shorter side @xmath54 we conclude that @xmath2 is proportional to @xmath4 .",
    "this fact directly follows from the additivity of the free energy . at the same time for short strips @xmath55",
    "the boundary effects cause the deviation from linear behavior of @xmath2 upon @xmath4 .",
    "our numerical computations remarkable confirm the above statement .",

    "contrary , for a random knot of size @xmath155 without the brownian bridge condition the complexity scales as @xmath156 ( see @xcite ) in agreement with the frstenberg theorem @xcite ) .",
    "the figs.[fig:2]b and [ fig:3]b confirm our statement . actually , the mean complexity of a bb  knot is smaller than the typical complexity of a random knot of the same size without the bb  condition .",
    "the probability for a part of a trivial knot to be also trivial is sufficiently higher than the corresponding unconditional probability for a random knot ( of the same size ) to be trivial ",
    "see fig.[fig:2]b .",
    "thus we directly validate the hypothesis that the topological state of any daughter quasi  knot , which is a part of a trivial parent knot , is almost trivial .",
    "hence , the parts of a polymer chain in the crumpled globule are practically unknotted in a broad range of scales .",
    "the investigation carried out above could be considered as an indirect verification of a hypothesis expressed in @xcite concerning the possibility to formulate some topological problems of collapsed polymer chains in terms of path integrals over trajectories with prescribed fractal dimension and without any topological ingredients .",
    "namely , in ensemble of collapsed polymer chains the essential fraction of trajectories has the fractal dimension of dense packing state @xmath159 ( @xmath160 is the space dimensionality ) .",
    "conversely there is a reason to assume that almost all paths in ensemble of trajectories with fractal dimension @xmath159 ( where @xmath161 ) are topologically isomorphic to knots , close to trivial .",

    "d_f\\{r } e^-h_f the usual wiener measure @xmath162 is concentrated on the trajectories with the fractal dimension @xmath165 .",
