    "sunspot penumbrae appear in the first telescopic observations of sunspots made four hundred years ago ( see the historical introduction by * ? ? ?",
    "despite this long observational record , we still lack of a physically consistent scenario to explain their structure , origin and nature .",
    "penumbrae are probably a form of convection taking place in highly inclined strong magnetic fields @xcite . however , there is no consensus even on this general description .",
    "for example , the _ observed _ vertical velocities do not suffice to transport the energy radiated away by penumbrae ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * and   [ vertical ] ) , which has been used to argue that they are not exclusively a convective phenomenon . the difficulties of understanding and modeling penumbrae",
    "are almost certainly associated with the small length scale at which the relevant physical process take place .",
    "this limitation biases all observational descriptions , and it also makes the numerical modeling challenging and uncertain .    from an observational point of view , one approaches the problem of resolving the physically interesting scales by two means .",
    "first , assuming the existence of unresolved structure when analyzing the data , in particular , when interpreting the spectral line asymmetries ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . via line - fitting , and with a proper modeling , this indirect technique allows us to infer physical properties of unresolved structures . on the other hand ,",
    "one gains spatial resolution by directly improving the image quality of the observations , which involves both the optical quality of the instrumentation and the application of image restoration techniques .",
    "eventually , the two approaches have to be combined when the relevant length - scales are comparable to the photon mean - free - path ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the advent of the swedish solar telescope ( sst ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) has opened up new possibilities along the second direct course .",
    "equipped with adaptive optics ( ao ) , it allows us to revisit old unsettled issues with unprecedented spatial resolution ( @xmath001 ) , a strategy which often brings up new observational results . in this sense",
    "the sst has already discovered a new penumbral structure , namely , dark lanes flanked by two bright filaments @xcite . these dark cores in penumbral filaments were neither expected nor theoretically predicted , which reflects the gap between our understanding and the penumbral phenomenon .    the purpose of this work is to describe yet another new finding arising from sst observations of penumbrae .",
    "it turns out that the penumbral proper motions diverge away from bright filaments and converge toward dark penumbral filaments .",
    "we compute the proper motion velocity field employing the local correlation tracking method ( lct ) described in the next section . using the mean velocity field computed in this way",
    ", we follow the evolution of a set of tracers ( corks ) passively advected by the mean velocities . independently of the details of this computation ,",
    "the corks tend to form long narrow filaments that avoid the presence of bright filaments ( fig .",
    "[ cork1]b ) .",
    "this is the central finding of the paper , whose details uncertainties and consequences are discussed in the forthcoming sections .",
    "the behavior resembles the flows in the non - magnetic sun associated with the granulation , mesogranulation , and supergranulation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the matter at the base of the photosphere moves horizontally from the sources of uprising plasma to the sinks in cold downflows . using this resemblance to granular convection",
    ", we argue that the observed proper motions seem to indicate the existence of downward motions throughout penumbrae , and in doing so , they suggest the convective nature of the penumbral phenomenon .",
    "lct techniques have been applied to penumbrae observed with lower spatial resolution ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "our analysis confirms previous findings of radial motions inward or outward depending on the distance to the penumbral border .",
    "in addition , we discover the convergence of these radial flows to form long coherent filaments .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "the observations and data analysis are summarized in   [ observations ] .",
    "the proper motions of the small scale penumbral features are discussed in   [ results ] and   [ formation ] .",
    "the vertical velocities to be expected if the proper motions trace true mass motions are discussed in ",
    "[ vertical ] , where we also consider their potential for convective transport in penumbrae . finally , we elaborate on the implications of our finding in   [ conclusions ] .",
    "the ( in-)dependence of the results on details of the algorithm is analyzed in appendix  [ robust ] .",
    "we employ the original data set of @xcite , generously offered for public use by the authors .",
    "they were obtained with the sst @xcite , a refractor with a primary lens of 0.97  m and equipped with ao .",
    "the data were post - processed to render images near the diffraction limit .",
    "specifically , we study the behavior of a penumbra in a 28 minutes long sequence with a cadence of 22 s between snapshots .",
    "the penumbra belongs to the large sunspot of the active region noaa 10030 , observed on july 15 , 2002 , close to the solar disk center ( 16  heliocentric angle ) .",
    "the series was processed with joint phase - diverse speckle ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which provides an angular resolution of 012 , close to the diffraction limit of the telescope at the working wavelength ( g - band , @xmath2  4305   ) . the field - of - view ( fov ) is @xmath3 , with pixels 0041 square .",
    "the images of the series were corrected for diurnal field rotation , rigid aligned , destretched , and subsonic fourier filtered ( modulations larger than 4 km  s@xmath1 are suppressed ) . for additional details ,",
    "see @xcite and the web page set up to distribute the data .",
    "our work is devoted to the penumbra , a region which we select by visual inspection of the images .",
    "figure  [ cork1]a shows the full fov with the penumbra artificially enhanced with respect of the umbra and the surrounding sunspot moat .",
    "figure  [ cork1]b shows the penumbra alone .",
    "the qualitative analysis carried out in the next sections refers to the lower half of the penumbra , enclosed by a white box in fig .",
    "[ cork1]a .",
    "the results that we describe are more pronounced in here , perhaps , because the region is not under the influence of a neighbor penumbra outside but close to the upper part of our fov .",
    "the effects of considering the full fov are studied in appendix  [ robust ] .",
    "we compute proper motions using the local correlation tracking algorithm ( lct ) of @xcite , as implemented by @xcite .",
    "it works by selecting small sub - images around the same pixel in contiguous snapshots that are cross - correlated to find the displacement of best match .",
    "the procedure provides a displacement or proper motion per time step , which we average in time .",
    "these mean displacements give the ( mean ) proper motions analyzed in the work .",
    "the sub - images are defined using a 2d gaussian window with smooth edges .",
    "the size of the window must be set according to the size of the structures selected as tracers . as a rule of thumb ,",
    "the size of the window is half the size of the structure that is being tracked ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "we adopt a window of fwhm 5  pixels ( @xmath4  02 ) , tracking small features of about 10 pixels ( @xmath4  04 ) .",
    "the lct algorithm restricts the relative displacement between successive images to a maximum of 2 pixels .",
    "this limit constrains the reliability of the proper motion velocity components , @xmath5 and @xmath6 , to a maximum of @xmath7 pix per time step , which corresponds to a maximum velocity of some 3.8  km  s@xmath1 .",
    "( here and throughout the paper , the symbols @xmath5 and @xmath6 represent the two cartesian components of the proper motions . ) such upper limit fits in well the threshold imposed on the original time series , were motions larger than 4  km  s@xmath1 were filtered out by the subsonic filter .    using the mean velocity field , we track the evolution of passively advected tracers ( corks ) spread out all over the penumbra at time equals zero .",
    "thus we construct a _ cork movie _ ( not to be confused with the 28  min long sequence of images from which the mean velocity field we inferred , which we call _ time series _ ) .",
    "the motions are integrated in time assuming 22  s per time step , i.e. , the cadence of the time series .",
    "figure  [ cork1]b shows the corks that remain in the penumbra after 110  min .",
    "( the cork movie can be found in http://www.iac.es/proyect/solarhr/pencork.html . )",
    "some 30  % of the original corks leave the penumbra toward the umbra , the photosphere around the sunspot , or the penumbra outside the fov .",
    "the remaining 70  % are concentrated in long narrow filaments which occupy a small fraction of the penumbral area , since many corks end up in each single pixel . as it happens with the rest of the free parameters used to find the filaments , the final time is not critical and it was chosen by trial and error as a compromise that yields well defined cork filaments .",
    "shorter times lead to fuzzier filaments , since the corks do not have enough time to concentrate .",
    "longer times erase the filaments because the corks exit the penumbra or concentrate in a few sparse points .",
    "we will compare the position of the cork filaments with the position of penumbral filaments in the intensity images .",
    "identifying penumbral filaments is not free from ambiguity , though .",
    "what is regarded as a filament depends on the spatial resolution of the observation .",
    "( no matter whether the resolution is 2   or 01 , penumbrae do show penumbral filaments .",
    "obviously , the filaments appearing with 2   and 01 can not correspond to the same structures . )",
    "moreover , being dark or bright is a local concept .",
    "the bright filaments in a part of the penumbra can be darker than the dark filaments elsewhere ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "keeping in mind these caveats , we use the average intensity along the observed time series to define bright and dark filaments , since it has the same spatial resolution as the lct mean velocity map .",
    "in addition , the local mean intensity of this time average image is removed by subtraction of a running box mean of the average image .",
    "the removal of low spatial frequencies allows us to compare bright and dark filaments of different parts of the penumbra .",
    "the width of the box is set to 41 pixels or 17 .",
    "( this time averaged and sharpened intensity is the one represented in figs .",
    "[ cork1 ] . )",
    "the main trends and correlations to be described in the next sections are not very sensitive to the actual free parameters used to infer them ( e.g. , those defining the lct and the local mean intensities ) .",
    "we have had to choose a particular set to provide quantitative estimates , but the variations resulting from using other sets are examined in appendix  [ robust ] .    a final clarification may be needed .",
    "the physical properties of the corks forming the filaments will be characterized using histograms of physical quantities .",
    "we compare histograms at the beginning of the cork movie with histograms at the end . except at time",
    "equals zero , several corks may coincide in a single pixel . in this case",
    "the corks are considered independently , so that each pixel contributes to a histogram as many times as the number of corks that it contains .",
    "we employ the symbol @xmath8 to denote the proper motion vector .",
    "its magnitude @xmath9 is given by @xmath10 with @xmath5 and @xmath6 the two cartesian components .",
    "note that these components are in a plane perpendicular to the line of sight . since the sunspot is not at the disk center",
    ", this plane is not exactly parallel to the solar surface .",
    "however , the differences are insignificant for the kind of qualitative argumentation in the paper ( see item  #  [ case_coor ] in appendix  [ robust ] ) .",
    "it is assumed that the plane of the proper motions defines the solar surface so that the @xmath11 direction corresponds to the solar radial direction .",
    "the solid line in figure  [ horiz_vel ] shows the histogram of time - averaged horizontal velocities considering all the pixels in the penumbra selected for analysis ( inside the box in fig .",
    "[ cork1]a ) .",
    "the dotted line of the same figure corresponds to the distribution of velocities for the corks that form the filaments ( fig .",
    "[ cork1]b ) .",
    "the typical proper motions in the penumbra are of the order of half a km  s@xmath1 .",
    "specifically , the mean and the standard deviation of the solid line in fig .  [ horiz_vel ] are 0.51  km  s@xmath1  and 0.42  km  s@xmath1 , respectively . with time",
    ", the corks originally spread all over the penumbra tend to move toward low horizontal velocities . the dotted line in fig .",
    "[ horiz_vel ] corresponds to the cork filaments in fig .",
    "[ cork1]b , and it is characterized by a mean value of 0.21  km  s@xmath1and a standard deviation of 0.35  km  s@xmath1 .",
    "this migration of the histogram toward low velocities is to be expected since the large proper motions expel the corks making it difficult to form filaments .",
    "the proper motions are predominantly radial , i.e. , parallel to the bright and dark penumbral filaments traced by the intensity .",
    "figure  [ angle ] shows the distribution of angles between the horizontal gradient of intensity and the velocity . using the symbol @xmath12 to represent the intensity image , the horizontal gradient of intensity @xmath13 is given in cartesian coordinates by , @xmath14 with the superscript @xmath15 representing transpose matrix .",
    "the intensity gradients point out the direction perpendicular to the intensity filaments .",
    "the angle @xmath16 between the local velocity and the local gradient of intensity is @xmath17 the angles computed according to the previous expression tend to be around 90@xmath18 ( fig .",
    "[ angle ] ) , meaning that the velocities are perpendicular to the intensity gradients and so , parallel to the filaments .",
    "the radial motions tend to be inward in the inner penumbra and outward in the outer penumbra , a systematic behavior that can be inferred from fig .",

    "this forecast intensity image has a clear divide in the penumbra .",
    "those points close enough to the photosphere around the sunspot will become bright , meaning that they exit the penumbra .",
    "the rest are dark implying that they either remain in the penumbra or move to the umbra .",
    "such radial proper motions are well known in the penumbral literature ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    ". however , on top of this predominantly radial flow , there is a small transverse velocity responsible for the accumulation of corks in filaments (   [ formation ] ) .",

    "the tracks followed by a set of corks finishing up in one of the filaments are plotted in fig .",

    "it shows the histogram of intensities associated with the initially uniform distribution of corks throughout the penumbra ( the solid line ) , and the final histogram after 110  min ( the dotted line ) .",

    "figure  [ histo1]b contains the same histogram as fig .  [ histo1]a but in a logarithm scale .",
    "it allows us to appreciate how the shift of the histogram is particularly enhanced in the tail of large intensities .",
    "the displacement between the two histograms is not larger because the corks do not end up in the darkest parts of the dark penumbral filaments ( see , e.g. , fig .",
    "[ tracks ] ) .",
    "it is important to know which properties of the velocity field produce the formation of filaments .",
    "most cork filaments are only a few pixels wide ( say , from 1 to 3 ) .",
    "the filaments are so narrow that they seem to trace particular stream lines , i.e. , the 1d path followed by a test particle fed at the starting point of the filaments",
    ". then the presence of a filament requires both a low value for the velocity in the filament , and a continuous source of corks at the starting point .",
    "the first property avoids the evacuation of the filament during the time span of the cork movie , and it is assessed by the results in   [ results ] , fig .",
    "[ horiz_vel ] .",
    "the second point allows the flow to collect the many corks that trace each filament ( a single cork can not outline a filament . ) if the cork filaments are formed in this way , then their widths are independent of the lct window width .",

    "the typical @xmath29 at the corks implies moderate convergent velocities , of the order of 100  m  s@xmath1 for points separated by 100  km .",

    "we want to stress that neither equation  ( [ myuz ] ) assumes the plasma to be incompressible , nor @xmath36 is the scale height of @xmath37 . actually , the value of @xmath36 , including its sign , is mostly set by the vertical stratification of density in the atmosphere ( see appendix b ) .",

    "we adopt this scale height because it is close to , but smaller than , the figure measured in the non - magnetic sun by ( * ? ? ?",
    "the density scale hight decreases with temperature , which reduces the penumbral value with respect to that in the non - magnetic photosphere .",
    "( one can readily change to any other @xmath36 since it scales all vertical velocities . ) according to fig .",

    ", the cork filaments seem to be associated with downflows .",
    "the cork filaments are also associated with dark features (   [ results ] ) .",
    "this combination characterizes the non - magnetic granulation ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and it reflects the presence of convective motions .",
    "the question arises as to whether the velocities that we infer can transport the radiative flux escaping from penumbrae .",
    "back - of - the - envelope estimates yield the following relationship between convective energy flux @xmath40 , mass density @xmath41 , specific heat at constant pressure @xmath42 , and temperature difference between upflows and downflows @xmath43 , @xmath44 @xcite . following the arguments by @xcite , the penumbral densities and temperature differences are similar to those observed in the quiet sun .",
    "furthermore @xmath40 is a large fraction of the quiet sun flux ( 75  % ) .",
    "then the vertical velocities required to account for the penumbral radiative losses are of the order of the velocities in the non - magnetic granulation or 1  km  s@xmath1 ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "one may argue that the penumbral vertical velocities inferred above are far too small to comply with such needs .",
    "however , the spatial resolution of our velocity maps is limited .",

    "could this bias mask large vertical convective motions ?",
    "we believe that it can , as inferred from the following argument .",
    "when the lct procedure is applied to normal granulation , it leads to vertical velocities of a few hundred m  s@xmath1 , which are smaller than the fiducial figure required for equation  ( [ ctransport ] ) to account for the quiet sun radiative flux ( 1  km  s@xmath1 ) .",
    "however , the quiet sun radiative flux is deposited in the photosphere by convective motions .",
    "therefore a large bias affects the quiet sun estimates of vertical velocities based on lct , and it is reasonable to conjecture that the same bias also affects our penumbral estimates .",
    "the vertical velocities associated with the non - magnetic solar granulation mentioned above have not been obtained from the literature .",
    "we have not been able to find any estimate when the lct window has a size to track individual granules , say , 0708 .",
    "then , we carried out an add hoc estimate using the quiet region outside the sunspot studied by @xcite .",
    "the vertical velocities are computed employing equation  ( [ myuz ] ) when the fwhm of the lct window equals 075 .",
    "the inferred vertical velocities  consider a gradient of horizontal velocities of the order of 1  km  s@xmath1  across a granule 1000  km wide .",

    "have standard deviations between 280  m  s@xmath1 and 110  m  s@xmath1 depending of the time average used to compute the mean velocities ( 5  min and 120  min , respectively ) .",
    "one can conclude that the vertical velocities are some five times smaller that the fiducial 1  km  s@xmath1 .",
    "this bias would increase our velocities to values consistent with the radiative losses of penumbrae .",
    "in short , given the limited spatial resolution , the velocities inferred from lct may be underestimating the true vertical velocities .",
    "if this bias is similar to that affecting the non - magnetic granulation , then the observed velocities suffice to transport the radiative losses of penumbrae by convection .",
    "all the discussion above assumes the proper motions to trace true motions .",
    "however , the proper motion velocities disagree with the plasma motions inferred from the evershed effect , i.e. , the intense and predominantly radial outward flows deduced from doppler shifts ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "our proper motions are both inward and outward , and only of moderate speed (   [ results ] ) .",
    "this disagreement may cast doubts on the vertical velocities computed above .",
    "fortunately , the doubts can be cleared up by acknowledging the existence of horizontal motions not revealed by the lct technique , and then working out the consequences .",
    "equation  ( [ myuz ] ) is linear so that different velocity components contribute separately to @xmath37 . in particular",
    ", the evershed flow represents one more component , and it has to be added to the proper motion based vertical velocities .",
    "the properties of the evershed flow at small spatial scales and large spatial scales do not modify the velocities in figure  ( [ usubz ] ) .",
    "on the one hand , we apply equation  ( [ myuz ] ) to average proper motions as inferred with the finite spatial resolution of our observations . it is a valid approach which , however , only provides average vertical velocities ( see appendix  [ appb ] ) .",
    "one has to consider the contribution of the average evershed velocities , eliminating structures smaller than the spatial resolution of the proper motion measurements . on the other hand ,",
    "the large scale structure of the evershed flow is also inconsequential . according to equation  ( [ myuz ] ) , a fast but large spatial scale flow does not modify @xmath37 ; add a constant to @xmath5 and @xmath6 , and @xmath37 does not change .",
    "only the structure of the evershed flow at intermediate spatial scales needs to be considered , and it does not invalidate our conclusion of downflows associated with the cork filaments . for the evershed flow to invalidate this association , it would have to provide upflows co - spatial with the cork filaments , and so , with dark lanes .",
    "however , the existence of upflows in dark lanes is not favored by the observations of the evershed effect , which seem to show the opposite , i.e. , a local correlation between upflows and bright lanes ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "thus we can not rule out a bias of the vertical velocities in figure  ( [ usubz ] ) due to the evershed flow but , if existing , the observed vertical component of the evershed flow seems to reinforce rather than invalidate the relationship between cork filaments and downflows .",
    "using local correlation tracking ( lct ) techniques , we measure mean proper motions in a series of high angular resolution ( 012 ) penumbral images obtained with the 1-meter swedish solar telescope ( sst ; * ? ? ?",
    "previous studies of lower resolution find predominantly radial proper motions , a result that we confirm . on top of this trend",
    ", however , we discover the convergence of the radial flows to form long coherent filaments .",
    "motions diverge away from bright filaments to converge toward dark filaments .",
    "the behavior resembles the flows in the non - magnetic sun associated with the granulation , where the matter moves horizontally from the sources of uprising plasma to the sinks in cold downflows . using such similarity",
    ", we argue that the observed proper motions suggest the existence of downward flows throughout the penumbra , and so , they suggest the convective nature of the penumbral phenomenon .",
    "the places where the proper motions converge would mark sinks in the penumbral convective pattern .",
    "the presence of this convergent motions is best evidenced using tracers passively advected as prescribed by the penumbral proper motion velocity field : see the dots in fig .",

    "[ tracks ] . with time",
    ", these tracers or corks form filaments that avoid the bright features and tend to coincide with dark structures .",
    "we quantify this tendency by following the time evolution of corks originally spread throughout the penumbra .",

    "assuming that the proper motions reflect true stationary plasma motions , the need for mass conservation allows us to estimate the vertical velocities at the cork filaments , i.e. , in those places where the plasma converges .",
    "these vertical velocities tend to be directed downward with a mean of the order of 200  m  s@xmath1 .",
    "the estimate is based on a number of hypotheses described in detail in  [ vertical ] and appendix  [ appb ] .",
    "we consider them to be reasonable but the fact that the vertical velocities are not direct measurements must be borne in mind .",
    "the inferred velocities are insufficient for the penumbral radiative flux to be transported by convective motions , which requires values of the order of 1 km  s@xmath1",
    ". however , the finite spatial resolution leads to underestimating the true velocities , a bias whose existence is indicated by various results . in particular , the same estimate of vertical velocities applied to non - magnetic regions also leads to vertical velocities of a few hundred m  s@xmath1 , although we know from numerical simulations and observed doppler shifts that the intrinsic granular velocities are much larger ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the algorithm used to infer the presence and properties of the cork filaments depends on several free parameters , e.g. , the size of the lct window , the cadence , the time span of the cork movie , and so on .",
    "they were originally set by trial an error . in order to study the sensitivity of our results on them",
    ", the computation was repeated many times scanning the range of possible free parameters ( appendix  [ robust ] ) .",
    "this test shows how the presence of converging flows associated with dark lanes and downflows is a robust result , which does not depend on subtleties of the algorithms .",
    "it seems to depend on the spatial resolution of the observation , though .",
    "the downward motions that we find may correspond to the ubiquitous downflows indirectly inferred by @xcite from the spectral line asymmetries observed in penumbrae . they may also be connected with an old observational result by @xcite , where they find a local correlation between brightness and doppler shift with the same sign all over the penumbra , and so , corresponding to vertical velocities ( see also , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the correlation is similar to that characterizing the non - magnetic granulation , which also suggests the presence of downflows in penumbrae .",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the association between downflows and dark features is particularly clear in the 02 angular resolution sst data studied by @xcite .",
    "again , these downflows may be an spectroscopic counterpart of those that we infer .",
    "however , it should be clear that we also find downflows in the inner penumbra , where they do not .",
    "whether this fact reflects a true inconsistency or can be easily remedied is not yet known .",

    "however , the three of them can cooperate to make the cross correlation negligible , so it is not unreasonable to use equation  ( [ appb2 ] ) as a working hypothesis , even for penumbrae .    the continuity equation for the actual variables ( equation  [ [ appb1 ] ] ) and the mean variables ( equation  [ [ appb4 ] ] ) are formally identical .",
    "we will use the former for the sake of clarity , dropping the angle brackets from the expressions ( @xmath60 , and @xmath61 ) .",

    "the mean density at the spatial coordinates @xmath62 , @xmath63 and @xmath11 can be split into two components , @xmath64 with the one describing the systematic vertical variation @xmath65 larger than the other accounting for the horizontal variations @xmath66 , @xmath67 keeping in mind this condition , the continuity equation can be approximated as , @xmath68\\simeq   \\nabla ( \\rho_0{\\bf u})= ( \\nabla\\rho_0)\\cdot{\\bf u}+\\rho_0\\nabla{\\bf u}\\simeq 0 . \\label{appb5}\\ ] ] since @xmath65 only varies along the vertical direction then , @xmath69 and equation  ( [ appb5 ] ) can be rewritten as , @xmath70 where the symbols @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath37 represent the three cartesian components of the mean velocity field . with the density scale height @xmath71 defined as , @xmath72 and the vertical velocity scale height given by ,",

    "however , the density is not constant and , consequently , one can have @xmath79 with vertical velocities whose magnitude @xmath81 decreases with height ( @xmath82 ) , increases with height ( @xmath83 ) , or is constant ( @xmath84 ) .",
    "although @xmath79 is an hypothesis , it seems to be more reasonable than the alternative @xmath85 .",
