    "the first proof makes it easier for the reader to see at a glance , how the inequality is achieved by applying shannon inequalities after adding an auxiliary variable .",

    "we consider the set of vectors , listed in the order @xmath117 that satisfy the current list of inequalities .",

    "when we just have the shannon inequalities , there are twelve extreme rays , up to symmetry : @xmath123    next , generate a list of possible one - variable copy specifications that will create a new variable @xmath45 . again with just one from each symmetry family these are : @xmath124 each of these codes up an instance of the copy lemma of the form",

    "then the above reads as : @xmath134 ( some possibilities were elimintated in advance : a last copy over no variables can never produce any new inequalities , and we may assume that no variable appears in both @xmath126 and @xmath127 . )    now go through a full search , testing each of the copy specifications against all of the extreme rays ( including all symmetric forms ) to see whether any contradictions are obtained . in the current example , the results of the run are : @xmath135    the passed entries are those copy specifications which did not contradict any of the extreme rays .",

    "next , we test ( by trial and error ) whether some of these constraint equations can be eliminated .",

    "for example , for the first remaining constraint , we first try using a multiple of zero :    itp(`@xmath159 ' , ... + ` @xmath142 ' , ... + ` @xmath143',`@xmath144 ' , ... + ` @xmath145 ' , ... + ` @xmath146 ' , ... + ` @xmath148',`@xmath149 ' , ... + ` @xmath151 ' , ... + ` @xmath153',`@xmath154 ' , ... + ` @xmath155',`@xmath156 ' , ... + ` @xmath157',`@xmath158 ' ) + not provable by itip    this of course fails since it was already determined that this equation was necessary .",

    "the first examples of infinite families of non - shannon inequalities were found by matus @xcite .",
    "for example , matus showed ( @xcite corollary 3 , formula ( 4 ) ) that for any nonnegative integer s , the following is an information inequality : @xmath229 here we have interpreted matus variables @xmath230 as @xmath231 respectively .",
    "note that in the case @xmath232 this is just the shannon inequality @xmath233 .",
    "if @xmath234 we get the zhang - yeung inequality . when @xmath235 this is inequality  ( [ matus2 ] )",
    "but when @xmath236 the resulting inequality does not appear previously in this paper .",
    "each inequality in this list can be proved using the copy lemma method , but the number of copies goes to @xmath237 as @xmath238 .",
    "matus used this list in a clever way to show that @xmath239 is not polyhedral .    in this section",
    "we will introduce another method of quickly generating inequalities .",
    "rather than listing them using an index @xmath240 , we will use a more general approach which we call extension rules .",
    "an extension rule turns one inequality of a certain type into another of the same type . as an example , consider our first extension rule .",
    "* rule [ 1 ] : * if @xmath241 is an information inequality with nonnegative coefficients , then so is @xmath242    notice that the premise inequality differs from the general form given in section  [ fourcopies ] in two ways . first , an additional term @xmath243 has been added .",
    "this of course , is not necessary since the coefficient @xmath244 could be set to zero . in other words , this term is only included because it can be and it is not known whether it is ever useful . secondly , notice that the coefficient of @xmath245 on the right matches the coefficient of @xmath116 on the left .",
    "this is the only restriction ( assuming it is of the general form ) needed to apply this rule .",
    "notice also that the conclusion inequality also satisfies this same restriction , allowing us to iterate this rule indefinitely .    to see why this rule generalizes the matus list  ,",
    "start with the shannon inequality @xmath233 and iterate the rule indefinitely .",
    "notice also that there are many other inequalities in section  [ fourcopies ] that satisfy the special condition of the coefficients and can therefore be iterated using this rule .",
    "we will now give an outline of the proof of rule [ 1 ] and then give several other similar rules .",
    "we observe that none of the rules discovered so far generalize the second infinite list of inequalities given by matus : @xmath246    the procedure for proving rule [ 1 ] is similar to that in preceding sections . given a collection of already - known inequalities , one can perform a polytope computation to produce a set of extreme rays .",
    "each of these extreme rays can be tested against one or more copy specifications ; if such a test results in a contradiction , then a new inequality can be deduced .",
    "the difference here is that , when testing an extreme ray against a copy specification , one can use instances of previously - obtained inequalities , involving both the given random variables and the copy variables , in an attempt to reach a contradiction .",
    "for example , suppose we take the zhang - yeung inequality as known , and produce the list of extreme rays ( see ) .",
    "we now consider the copy specification `` @xmath45 is a @xmath44-copy of @xmath1 over @xmath177 '' .",
    "using the equations represented by this copy specification , the shannon inequalities on variables @xmath247 and the instances of the zhang - yeung inequality obtained by substituting in combinations of these five variables , one finds that some of the listed extreme rays are not attainable .",

    "this is not surprising , because further investigation shows that the process of obtaining this inequality here used only one instance of zhang - yeung , namely : @xmath249 it only takes one additional copy variable to prove directly , so two copy variables in all suffice to prove .    but",
    "further information can be extracted from the proof of which will allow us to get a substantially more general result .",

    "( this decomposition was found by a trial - and - error approach . )",
    "now that we have divided into these pieces , we can reassemble the pieces with different coefficients to get a more general rule for deducing inequalities from old ones . by putting arbitrary nonnegative coefficients @xmath252 on the five inequalities above , instead of the coefficients @xmath253 used to get ,",
    "we get : the inequality @xmath254    is provable from `` @xmath45 is a @xmath44-copy of @xmath1 over @xmath177 '' and the shannon inequalities .",

    "it is clear that according to this measure , there is still quite a gap to fill , with room for improvement in both inner and outer bounds .",
    "perhaps one of the most interesting entropy vectors is the one that yields the worst violation of ingleton s inequality  .    given a probability distribution ,",

    "we begin with some definitions .",
    "let @xmath354 be a polytope in @xmath355 , let @xmath356 be an affine function of @xmath24-variables such that for each point @xmath357 in @xmath354 , @xmath358 .",
    "then the set of points in @xmath354 satisfying @xmath359 is called an _ extreme _ segment of @xmath354 .",

    "first of all , the polytope @xmath296 is a subset of both @xmath285 and @xmath288 , so we only need to show that @xmath285 does not contain any vertices of @xmath288 that lie outside of @xmath296 . outside of @xmath296",
    "the only vertices of @xmath288 are the tops of the pyramids .",
    "but these tops fail one of the permuted forms of the zhang - yeung inequality . for example",
    ", the top of the pyramid give by fails the inequality of theorem  [ th : zy2 ] .",
    "we will now use the zhang - yeung inequality to show that @xmath296 is also the 1-core of @xmath285 in @xmath288 .",
    "then we will use the infinite families of inequalities to prove the stronger result that it is also the 3-core .",
    "so the ingleton region , aside from its applications to linear ranks , is a natural part of the geometry of entropy space .",
    "the 1-core of @xmath285 in @xmath288 is @xmath296 .    since the polytope @xmath296 is a subset of both @xmath285 and @xmath288 , we need to show that the intersection of @xmath285 with the 1-skeleton of @xmath288 lies entirely in @xmath296 .",
    "we only need the zhang - yeung inequality , @xmath72 and the ingleton inequality  .",
    "@xmath362 subtracting the two , we get the inequality @xmath363 which must be satisfied by any point on the base of the pyramid , since the ingleton equation   is satisfied by such points .",
    "also , if any base point has a zero value for all of the terms @xmath364 then it satisfies the zhang - yeung inequality non - strictly ( as an equation ) .",
    "we now consider an extreme line segment connecting a two vertices of @xmath288 , one of them being the top of the pyramid . since this is the only vertex of @xmath288 that fails the ingleton inequality , the other vertex satisfies the ingleton inequality .",
    "therefore , at some point on this segment , the ingleton equation is satisfied .",
    "we will call this the base point of the segment .",
    "there are thirteen shannon equations satisfied by all of the points on this segment .",
    "since the top of the pyramid is defined by the fourteen shannon faces of the pyramid , the thirteen shannon equations satisfied by the line segment must be included in this group of fourteen .",
    "therefore , all points on the line segment are either zero on all three of the terms above , or on all three of the terms with @xmath3 , @xmath44 interchanged , @xmath365 since these represent six of the fourteen shannon faces . therefore , the base point of this line segment either satisfies the zhang - yeung equation or the zhang - yeung equation with @xmath3",
    ", @xmath44 interchanged . on the other hand , it is easy to check that the top of the pyramid   fails both the zhang - yeung inequality , and the same inequality with @xmath3 , @xmath44 interchanged . by linearity , one of the two zhang - yeung inequalities must fail everywhere on the part of the line segment where the ingleton inequality fails .",
    "therefore the intersection of @xmath285 with the 0-skeleton of @xmath288 lies entirely in @xmath296 .",
    "we will now prove a stronger result using a similar technique , and making use of the infinite families of inequalities .",
    "the 3-core of @xmath285 in @xmath288 is @xmath296 .    as in the previous proof ,",
    "we need to show that no point of @xmath366 is in the 3-skeleton of @xmath288 .",
    "we suppose there is such a point and call it @xmath357 .",
    "then @xmath357 lies on a three dimensional extreme segment that includes at least four vertices of @xmath288 , one of which we may assume is the top of the pyramid and is the only one that fails the ingleton inequality .",
    "the segment is defined by eleven shannon faces , and since the segment includes the top of the pyramid , these eleven faces must be among the fourteen shannon faces of the pyramid .",
    "suppose first that the eleven faces includes the two faces @xmath367 then consider the first matus family of inequalities   @xmath368 which on our segment reduces to @xmath369    at the top of the pyramid , all terms of this reduced inequality are zero except @xmath116 .",
    "the inequality becomes @xmath370 , which is false .",
    "but if the ingleton equation is satisfied , then this becomes @xmath371 and the value of the right side tends to zero with large values of @xmath240 . by linearity ,",
    "the value of the right side of the reduced inequality at @xmath357 must become negative for sufficiently large @xmath240 , so the information inequality is false .",
    "therefore , the eleven defining faces of the segment can not include both @xmath289 and @xmath316 .    a similar argument with @xmath1 and @xmath2",
    "interchanged tells us that the eleven faces can not include both @xmath289 and @xmath319 .",
    "next , suppose that the eleven faces of our segment includes the two faces @xmath372 iterating rule 2 , and starting with the shannon inequality @xmath273 , we generate the infinite list of inequalities : @xmath373 where @xmath240 is any any non - negative integer . on our segment",
    "this reduces to @xmath374 at the top of the pyramid , this again becomes @xmath375 , which is false . if the ingleton equation is satisfied , then this becomes @xmath376 we conclude , as before , that the inequality becomes false at @xmath357 for sufficiently large values of @xmath240 .",
    "therefore , the eleven defining faces of our segment can not include both @xmath316 and @xmath319 .    summarizing the work so far",
    ", we see that the eleven faces can not include any two of the three faces @xmath377    a similar argument with @xmath3 and @xmath44 interchanged shows that the eleven faces can not include any two of the three faces @xmath378    but only three of the fourteen shannon faces are excluded , so this is a contradiction .",
    "future inequalities may be able to improve this further , perhaps showing that @xmath296 is the 4-core of @xmath285 in @xmath288 , etc .",
    "but it ca nt go beyond the 5-core since the four - atom point lies on eight of the fourteen shannon faces .",

    "specifically , in @xcite , the zhang - yeung inequality ( our theorem  [ thm : zhang - yeung ] ) was used to derive an upper bound on the coding capacity of the vmos network ( see figure  [ fig : vamos - network ] ) .",
    "the vmos network is a network constructed from the well - known vmos matroid and is of interest as it is presently the only known network for which non - shannon information inequalities have improved capacity bound calculations .",
    "the capacity upper bound derived in @xcite was @xmath388 and was shown to be strictly smaller than the smallest possible upper bound ( i.e. @xmath303 ) obtainable directly from shannon - type information inequalities .",
    "the vmos network thus illustrates a potential for improvement in capacity calculations using non - shannon - type inequalities over shannon - type ineqaulities .",
    "it was also shown in @xcite that the linear coding capacity of the vmos network over every finite field is exactly equal to @xmath389 , which is presently the best known lower bound on the ( possibly non - linear ) coding capacity of the vmos network .",
    "the capacity bound calculation in @xcite was specific to the particular form of the zhang - yeung inequality .",
    "a more general strategy for improving capacity upper bounds using other non - shannon inequalities is given in what follows .",
    "we present a systematic method for using non - shannon information inequalities to obtain capacity bounds .",
    "in particular , the best known upper bound on the vmos network capacity is improved from @xmath388 to @xmath390 .",
    "the exact coding capacity of this network remains an open problem , lying somewhere in the interval @xmath391 $ ] .",
    "we will now demonstrate one way to exploit the new non - shannon inequalities given in the present paper to obtain even tighter bounds on the coding capacity of the vmos network .",
    "the next theorem provides a tighter upper bound on the vmos network coding capacity than previously known .",
    "the coding capacity of the vmos network is at most @xmath390 .",
    "[ thm : vamos - bound ]    consider a @xmath385 solution to the vmos network .",
    "assume that the network messages @xmath51 are independent , @xmath380-dimensional , random vectors with uniformly distributed components and assume each edge in the network has capacity @xmath24 .",
    "let @xmath392 denote the random variables carried by edges @xmath393 , respectively .",
    "since the @xmath24-dimensional vector carried on any edge @xmath394 is a deterministic function of the in - edges to node @xmath395 and sources generated at @xmath395 , the conditional entropy of the random vector on @xmath383 , given the vectors on the in - edges to @xmath395 and message vectors produced at @xmath395 must be zero .",

    "to our knowledge , no one has ever given a non - shannon inequality and proved that it will not be superseded by others .",
    "this would certainly be an interesting challenge for future research .",
    "although each inequality found gives more information about the shape of entropy space , and each one is at least theoretically useful in a network information flow problem , it seems unlikely that endlessly producing new inequalities will be fruitful in itself .",
    "these inequalities are presented with the hope that it may be possible to study the list as a whole , in order to gain further insights that will enable doing more than just endlessly extending the list .",
    "along these lines , perhaps the most striking feature of list of the inequalities listed is their special form .",
    "indeed every inequality produced has the form @xmath191 and vary from each other only by the choice of the coefficients @xmath228 .",
    "there seems to be no obvious reason for this form .",
    "indeed , there were a few inequalities that were found and were not of this form .",
    "but each of these non - conforming inequalities was superseded by other inequalities or was reduced to the special form under tightening . explaining this special form might be a first step in gaining a deeper understanding of the inequalities .",
    "another direction to pursue is to find patterns among the inequalities and/or their proofs .",
    "identifying such patterns may allow us to continue the patterns indefinitely .",
    "along these lines , we have identified several  rules \" that allow us to generate new inequalities from old ones .",
    "application of these rules quickly yields infinite families of inequalities similar to those found by matus @xcite .",
    "families of inequalities have already given valuable insight into the structure of entropy space and were instrumental in matus proof that entropy space is not a polytope ( or polytopal cone ) . to our knowledge",
    ", no one has yet been able to show whether or not entropy space is curved",
    ". this would certainly be a valuable contribution toward understanding this space .",
    "finally , the techniques used in this paper seem limited and do not seem like they will be strong enough to settle the four atom conjecture .",
    "we believe therefore , that some new techniques for finding non - shannon inequalities will be vital for gaining a more complete understanding of entropy space .",
