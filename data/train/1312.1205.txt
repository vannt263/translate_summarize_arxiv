    "therefore , mention of @xmath69 will hereafter imply that @xmath1 allows loops .",
    "note also that @xmath69 can replace @xmath4 in the definition of inducibility , because in large graphs repeated sampling of vertices gets rare .    several extremal constructions for inducibility fall under the following simple definition .",

    "no copy of @xmath0 in @xmath74 can have more than one vertex from @xmath82 , since @xmath0 is twin - free and every two vertices in @xmath82 are twins in @xmath74 .",

    "therefore @xmath84 as required .",
    "see  @xcite for conditions under which inducibility is attained by blow - ups .",
    "lemma  [ twins ] s proof naturally leads to the following construction , by pippenger and golumbic  @xcite .",
    "the _ composition _ of two graphs @xmath1 and @xmath0 , which we denote @xmath85 , is essentially a blow - up of @xmath1 , with a copy of @xmath0 corresponding to every vertex of @xmath1 .",
    "formally , @xmath85 is a graph on @xmath86 , with edges @xmath87 note that this operation is non - commutative but associative .",
    "we use the shorthand @xmath88 for the iterated composition of @xmath89 copies of @xmath1 .",
    "the sequence @xmath90 is called the _ nested blow - up _ of @xmath1 .",
    "the nested blow - up of a graph @xmath0 yields the above - mentioned lower bound @xmath91 , where  @xmath92 . for @xmath93 @xmath94 ,",
    "pippenger and golumbic showed that this bound is tight up to a constant factor , and conjectured it to be sharp .",
    "for example , by nested blow - up @xmath95 , rather than @xmath96 obtained by regular blow - ups . flag algebra calculus yields a different but close upper bound of @xmath97  @xcite .",
    "exoo  @xcite noticed that sometimes the nested blow - up of some @xmath98 beats the nested blow - up of @xmath0 . indeed , suppose that a @xmath6-vertex graph @xmath0 is obtained from a vertex - transitive graph @xmath99 by removal of a single vertex . in this case , the nested blow - up of @xmath99 gives @xmath100 which is superior to the above bound by about @xmath101 .",
    "in particular , taking @xmath102 he obtained @xmath103 . by computer search he found an even better candidate , the paley graph @xmath104 in which two elements of the finite field @xmath105 are neighbors iff their difference is a square .",
    "the nested blow - up of @xmath104 yields @xmath106 .",
    "we turn to describe the other main building block , which is due to thomason  @xcite .",

    ", @xmath107 , has vertex set @xmath86 , where @xmath108 in particular , @xmath109 is a blow - up of @xmath1 .",
    "a less trivial example is @xmath110 which is isomorphic to the paley graph of order  @xmath111 .",
    "note that the tensor product is associative and commutative .",
    "as thomason observed , and we explain below , the @xmath6-profile of @xmath107 can be easily computed from those of @xmath1 and  @xmath0 .",
    "this considerably simplified his original refutation of the erds conjecture .",
    "for the special case of @xmath112 , he found plenty of further counterexamples .",
    "in particular , a computer investigation of products of small graphs yielded @xmath113 then , a broader search on larger cayley graphs enhanced the bound to @xmath114 where we define @xmath115 .",
    "a final remark in  @xcite , attributed to a referee , states that this construction is still not optimal . replacing @xmath116 by a randomly perturbed blow - up of @xmath116",
    "yields a slight improvement ( @xmath117 ) .",
    "the above chain of events makes it natural to ask , what would happen if @xmath118 were replaced by a nested blow - up of @xmath110 . indeed , as we explain in the next section @xmath119 note that proposition  [ ik4a4 ] follows from this by lemma  [ qlemma ] .",
    "in fact , the graph sequence that demonstrates proposition  [ ip4 ] hides in the @xmath3-profiles along the way : @xmath120",
    "we next develop general tools , which may also provide some insight on the construction .",
    "we begin with a slightly different formulation of thomason s analysis from  @xcite .",
    "recall that @xmath121 and @xmath8 are the distributions of induced graphs on @xmath6 random vertices , sampled with and without replacements , respectively .",
    "it is convenient to define the _ labeled @xmath6-profile _ , which accounts also for the ordering of the sample . for a labeled @xmath6-vertex graph  @xmath0",

    ", we similarly define @xmath127 in the non - repetitive case .",
    "the labeled graphs of order @xmath6 admit a natural group structure , with the operation of symmetric difference of the edges .",
    "one can apply the discrete fourier transform over this group , and obtain @xmath128 , the _ spectral @xmath6-profile _ : @xmath129 the summation is over all @xmath130 labeled graphs with @xmath6 vertices , and @xmath131 is the number of edges which appear in both @xmath0 and @xmath99 . observe that @xmath132 for every @xmath1 .",
    "note also that @xmath133 is constant on classes of graph isomorphism , exactly like @xmath134 .",
    "therefore we can refer to , e.g. , @xmath135 without specifying labels on the vertices of @xmath37 .",
    "the basic observation about the tensor product is that sampling vertices in @xmath136 can be separated , in a sense , to sampling each factor independently .",
    "more precisely , if the @xmath1 components of the sample create @xmath0 and the @xmath74 components create @xmath99 , then the sampled graph is the symmetric difference @xmath137 .",
    "consequently , @xmath138 where @xmath139 stands for convolution over the group of labeled graphs . from this immediately follows ,    [ pointwise ] @xmath140    we are now in position to explain thomason s method .",

    "then , by linear automorphisms of  @xmath227 , @xmath230  is further equivalent to at least one of the following symmetric quadratic forms over  @xmath229 : @xmath231 note that @xmath232 if and only if the hamming weight of @xmath233 equals @xmath234  or  @xmath235 mod  @xmath3 .",
    "this can simplify our choice of generators .",
    "for instance , @xmath236 can be generated by all vectors in @xmath237 of hamming weight @xmath238 .",
    "franek and rdl  @xcite introduced further counter - examples to the erds conjecture , using other cayley graphs of @xmath239 which are generated by sets of hamming distances .",
    "a computer search for such graphs provided the best - known upper bounds on @xmath58 for @xmath240  @xcite .",
    "for example , in @xmath237 the weights set @xmath241 yields @xmath242 , improving @xmath243 obtained by @xmath236 .",
    "note that the two graphs differ in about @xmath244 of the edges .",
    "in general , these new constructions can be interpreted as minor modifications of the ones derived from @xmath245 and  @xmath246 .",
    "it would be interesting to understand why this method generates better graphs , and to find how its performance grows with  @xmath6 .",
    "meanwhile , it indicates that our graph construction toolbox is still far from sufficient .",
    "we close this note with a quick glance at @xmath43-vertex inducibilities .",
    "our current state of knowledge is collected in a table in appendix  [ app1 ] .",
    "lower and upper bounds on the inducibility of all @xmath247 graphs with @xmath43 vertices are listed there , together with a short description of the construction leading to the lower bound .",
    "the quoted upper bounds were generated by the excellent freeware _",
    "flagmatic _ , created by vaughan  @xcite , which has reduced such calculations to typing one line on the computer .",
    "we used the method ` graphproblem(7,density= ... ).solve_sdp ( ) ` , but did nt try to round the results to rational numbers .",
    "consequently , the upper bounds should only be viewed as well - established conjectures .",
    "some trends emerge in table  [ exoo5table ] . in the first eight lines ,",
    "the lower bound comes from blow - up of small graphs .",
    "the choice of the blown - up graph is rather natural in all these cases . only in two of the cases",
    "are the upper and the lower bounds different , and then , too , the difference is quite small . in this view",
    "we suspect that the lower bound is the correct value .",
    "the next five constructions are again either tight or at least plausibly so .",
    "they each consist of two disjoint blow - ups of the same small graph , with size - ratios optimized to @xmath248 .",
    "this number comes up as the ratio @xmath249 that maximizes @xmath250 subject to @xmath251 . in all five cases",
    "the target graph is a connected graph plus an isolated vertex .",
    "moreover , the graph that we duplicate and blow up is the best construction for the inducibility of the @xmath3-vertex component , as in table  [ exootable ] .",
    "the only exception is , again , @xmath44 .",
    "it is plausible that such relations between constructions carry on in larger graphs .    for the cycle @xmath252 ,",
    "nested blow - up has been long conjectured , as discussed in section  [ constsect ] .",
    "the remaining four cases seem to exhibit more complex behavior . in two cases ,",
    "our current constructions use random graphs .",
    "one of them is tight and in the other one there is still a considerable gap , which make us doubt its optimality",
    ". it would be interesting to explore the role of random constructions in the study of inducibility .",
    "the challenge of derandomization suggests itself as well .",
    "this may require the introduction of new machinery in the realm of constructions beyond blow - ups , nesting and products .",
    "our best constructions for the two last cases , the @xmath43-path and the self - complementary `` bull '' graph , combine nested blow - up with tensor products .",
    "this situation is similar to  @xmath44 and  @xmath253 , the heroes of this note .",
