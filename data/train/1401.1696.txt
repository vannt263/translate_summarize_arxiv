    "how can a charged object exert electric forces on an uncharged object ? generally speaking , this may be the case whenever the nominally neutral object and/or its overall neutral environment is actually composed of positive and negative constituents , which may freely move ( e.g. ions in a liquid ) or lead to dielectric polarization effects ( e.g. electrons and protons in a solid ) in the presence of an electric field , see fig . [ fig1 ] .    according to textbook electrostatics @xcite , any given charge in a polarizable environment gives rise to a so - called `` self - energy '' or `` energy of charge '' , which is negative and proportional to the polarizability of the environment . as a consequence ,",
    "a repulsive force between the given charge and any other extended object arises in the most common case that they are both surrounded by a fluid and the polarizability of the object is lower than that of the fluid , see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ( a ) .",
    "= 0.5 = 0.5 +    one of the best known examples is an ion ( charged object ) in an aqueous solution ( dielectric constant of water @xmath0 ) being repelled by a biological or artificial membrane ( neutral object ) with a typical dielectric constant @xmath1 of @xmath2 @xcite . here , we address the conceptually analogous case of the potential barrier which an _ uncharged _ particle encounters upon entering a charged membrane pore .",
    "the corresponding forces on the particle are closely related to the well - known phenomenon of dielectrophoresis and will henceforth be denoted as _",
    "dielectric forces_.    additional important effects arise in the usual case that the ambient fluid contains positively and negatively charged ions @xcite . as a consequence ,",
    "any charged object now attracts counterions ( and repels coions ) from the ambient fluid ( electric double layer ) .",
    "the characteristic extension of such a counterion `` layer '' or `` cloud '' is quantified by the so - called debye length , typically of the order of @xmath3 nm . at distances beyond a few debye lengths , the charged object is thus essentially screened , i.e. it `` looks '' as if it were uncharged .    on the one hand ,",
    "the above mentioned dielectric forces are therefore expected to be notably reduced already within the counterion layer and become negligible outside it . on the other hand , additional repulsive forces are expected when an uncharged object enters the electric double layer , see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ( b ) .",
    "the reason is that the prevailing like - charged ions repel each other , resulting in an excess pressure within the counterion cloud which also acts against any intruding object . while this effect bears some resemblance to _",
    "osmotic pressure _",
    "@xcite , the term _ counterion pressure _ seems more appropriate to us and will be adopted from now on .",
    "a detailed exploration of those effects is the main subject of our present work .",
    "in particular , we will demonstrate that , under typical experimental conditions , the counterion pressure gives rise to considerably larger energy barriers against the entrance of uncharged nanoparticles into charged nanopores than the dielectric forces .",

    "typical experimental concentrations @xmath7 range from about @xmath8 mm to about @xmath9 mm @xcite .",
    "the membrane is modeled as an insulator with constant surface charge density @xmath10 , whose quantitative value depends on the membrane material , ph - value , salt concentrations , and other factors , and which is screened by counterions in the electrolyte solution . under typical experimental conditions",

    "typical values in our examples below will be @xmath16 nm and @xmath17 nm .    the quantity of foremost interest is the net force acting on the particle due to the counterion pressure and the dielectric forces mentioned in sec .",
    "[ s1 ] .    from the viewpoint of the numerical ( and analytical ) tractability of the problem , two further assumptions are practically unavoidable @xcite ,",

    "first , we restrict our discussion to the axisymmetric case where a particle translocates through the pore along the @xmath18-axis ( see fig .",
    ". this will also be justified by our later finding that the neutral particle is repelled by the uniformly charged membrane and pore surfaces and hence the energetically most favorable translocation path ( e.g. driven by thermal noise ) will be along the pore axis @xcite .",
    "second , we restrict ourselves to steady state ( time - independent ) situations , and we assume , similarly as in refs .",
    "@xcite , that the particle itself does not to exhibit any notable proper motion within the relaxation time of its environment . in other words ,",
    "the particle position is a model parameter rather than a dynamical variable .",
    "the justification is , as usual , the clear cut time- and length - scale separation between the nanoparticle and the molecular degrees of freedom of the ambient fluid @xcite .",
    "in this section we summarize the poisson , nernst - planck , and stokes equations .",
    "a more detailed discussion is provided e.g. in refs .",

    "the reynolds number is very low , the non - linear terms in this equation can be safely neglected . focusing on steady states and neglecting the very small effect of gravity , it is thus sufficient to solve the simpler stokes equation @xmath42 with @xmath43 the viscosity of the fluid .",
    "analogously to eq .",
    "( [ 5 ] ) , assuming an incompressible fluid and focusing on steady state solutions , mass conservation implies @xmath44      the relative permittivity is assumed to be of the form @xmath45 while @xmath46 is usually close to the value @xmath47 for water at room temperature , @xmath1 and @xmath48 are material dependent .",

    "physically , this follows by observing that for an overall constant @xmath22 , the electric field is proportional to the field for @xmath95 , i.e. for a non - polarizable particle in vacuum .",
    "since there are no dielectric forces in the latter case , the same applies to the former case .",
    "( @xmath89 in ( [ 16 ] ) must be zero in both cases ) .",
    "formally , the same follows from poisson s equation ( [ 1 ] ) , whose right hand side vanishes within the particle region , the boundary conditions ( [ 9 ] ) , ( [ 10b ] ) , which imply a smooth behavior of @xmath96 across the particle boundary for @xmath94 , and by employing the gauss theorem in ( [ 16 ] ) . for a neutral particle with arbitrary @xmath48",
    "it thus seems justified to henceforth _",
    "identify @xmath89 with the dielectric forces _ due to polarization or self - energy effects from fig .",
    "[ fig1]a and sec . [ s1 ] .",

    "[ fig1]b and sec . [ s1 ] .    furthermore , for symmetry reasons the force @xmath86 resulting from ( [ 15 ] ) , ( [ 16 ] ) , ( [ 17a ] ) will be parallel to the pore axis .",

    "symmetry reasons further imply that @xmath108 with ( [ 36 ] ) we thus can conclude that @xmath109      in spite of the above mentioned simplifications at thermal equilibrium , the remaining poisson - boltzmann equation ( [ 20a1 ] ) , complemented by ( [ 8])-([10b ] ) , and the final surface integrations in ( [ 16 ] ) , ( [ 17a ] ) can only be tackled analytically in a few special cases and within certain approximations , see e.g. sec .",

    "only numerical solutions are possible .",
    "it , however , turns out that the numerical treatment of the fully three - dimensional problem is still very demanding , even on modern computers , if a satisfactory numerical accuracy is required .",
    "consequently , similar previous studies are restricted to one - dimensional @xcite , two - dimensional @xcite , or axisymmetric problems @xcite problems . in the latter case , which is also at the focus of our present work , an effectively two - dimensional problem is readily recovered when going over to cylindrical coordinates ( see e.g. @xcite for the explicit expressions ) .",

    "[ fig2 ] ) , which is `` fully threaded through the pore ''",
    "so that both ends stick far out at either side of the pore , we are dealing with an almost translation invariant situation and the net force on the particle will be practically zero .    likewise , for a very `` long '' pore ( @xmath111 in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) and a comparatively `` short '' particle ( @xmath112 ) with both ends `` far inside '' the pore , an almost translation invariant net force on the particle is expected ( the pore ends hardly matter ) .",
    "furthermore , for symmetry reasons the forces acting onto either end of the particle will almost cancel each other , i.e. a close to zero net force is expected .",
    "the main focus of the present section is on the following `` mixture '' of the above two cases : we consider a very `` long '' pore ( @xmath111 in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) in combination with a sufficiently `` long '' particle ( @xmath113 ) , so that one of its ends is `` far inside '' the pore and the other end `` far outside '' the pore .",
    "again , one thus expects an almost translation invariant net force on the particle , but now there is no symmetry argument that this constant force should be almost zero .",
    "rather one expects that the force will actually be ( almost ) maximal ( in modulus ) . in the following ,",
    "our main goal is to analytically approximate this `` maximum force '' , henceforth denoted as @xmath114 .    closer inspection of the surface integrals in eqs . ( [ 16 ] ) and ( [ 17a ] ) shows that , as expected from our above considerations , the main contributions to @xmath114 are generated in the vicinity of the particle s end far inside the pore . since no analytical ( exact or approximate ) solutions of the poisson - boltzmann equation ( [ 20a1 ] )",
    "seem to exist for such a case , we can not evaluate the surface integrals ( [ 16],[17a ] ) directly .",
    "we therefore adopt the following , alternative approach : we assume that the particle is moved an infinitesimal distance @xmath115 into the pore ( along the cylinder axis ) .",

    "the force @xmath114 required to hold the particle fixed at the initial position is thus given by @xmath117    in the framework of the poisson - boltzmann equation ( [ 20a1 ] ) the free energy of the system can be expressed in several equivalent forms @xcite . the most convenient form for our purpose is @xmath118   \\ , \\ ] ] where the integration domain @xmath119 is the entire fluid chamber .",
    "since @xmath120 , we can approximate the free energy difference as @xmath121 and hence @xmath114 from ( [ 20c ] ) as @xmath122 where @xmath123 is the free energy per unit length for an infinitely long , empty pore , and @xmath124 is the corresponding free energy per unit length for an infinitely long particle in an infinitely long pore . for",
    "both situations the potentials @xmath125 and the charge densities @xmath126 become independent of @xmath18 .",
    "we may thus adopt cylinder coordinates with @xmath127 and rewrite the poisson - boltzmann equation ( [ 20a1 ] ) as @xmath128 complemented by the conditions @xmath129 for @xmath130 ( overall charge neutrality of pore surface and counterions , cf .",

    "the translocation of neutral particles through nanopores can be greatly suppressed if the nanopore walls carry surface charges .    according to figs .",
    "[ fig4 ] and [ fig5 ] and their discussion in the main text , the force @xmath104 develops two plateaux of height @xmath179 , whose widths can be very roughly approximated as @xmath191 . in combination with ( [ 36 ] ) , ( [ 34 m ] )",
    "we thus arrive at the following approximation for the potential barrier , @xmath192 as fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] demonstrates , this simple approximation reproduced the numerically obtained barriers quite well .",
    "the deviations are mainly rooted in the fact that we can not approximate very well the `` edges '' of the force plateaux in figs .",
    "[ fig4 ] ( e),(f ) .",
    "so far , we have restricted ourselves to particles with radii @xmath193 nm .",
    "we have seen that , beside other factors , the potential barrier for crossing the pore strongly depends on the ion concentrations . above @xmath194 mm",
    "the barrier nearly vanishes . for these salt concentrations ,",
    "the distance of the particle from the wall , @xmath195 , is larger than a few times the debye length @xmath196 from ( [ deb ] ) so that the surface charge is almost entirely screened by the counterions . on the other hand ,",
    "if @xmath195 is comparable to or smaller than the debye length , the counterion pressure within the nanopore will significantly influence the translocation dynamics . for particle radii other than @xmath16 nm",

    "[ s5b ] depend on the surface charge density @xmath10 . as tacitly anticipated in fig .",
    "[ fig5](b ) , all forces are obviously independent of the sign of those charges , i.e. they must be even functions of @xmath10 .",
    "moreover , they must vanish in the absence of any surface charges .",
    "hence , the leading order behavior for small @xmath10 will be proportional to @xmath184 .",
    "this asymptotics as well the behavior beyond the small @xmath10 regime is illustrated by fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] ( b ) .",
    "moreover , we found numerically e.g. for @xmath197 mc / m@xmath12 almost the same shapes of the force curves as for @xmath11 mc / m@xmath12 in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , just their overall amplitudes were rescaled by the same factor of @xmath198 as the corresponding maximum force @xmath114 in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] ( b ) .",
    "a similar behavior is expected for a large range of other @xmath10-values .",
    "while the surface charge density of sulfate coated surfaces is , e.g. , quite independent of the solution conditions @xcite , the surface charge density of silica ( sio@xmath50 ) membranes has been reported to increase with increasing concentration @xmath143 and has typical values between -10 mc / m@xmath12 and -100 mc / m@xmath12 for @xmath143 between @xmath3 mm and @xmath199 mm @xcite . in such a case , a more realistic modeling should take into account a reduction of the surface charge density within the pore , compared to the membrane charge density far from the pore @xcite .",
    "we have conducted preliminary numerical investigations along these lines , indicating that the results change only quite insignificantly .",
    "we have explored the forces , experienced by an electrically neutral but in general polarizable nanorod in an electrolyte solution , which are generated by a constant surface charge density on a membrane with a cylindrical nanopore . unless the debye screening length ( [ deb ] ) , quantifying the characteristic extension of the electric double layer , is much smaller than the minimal distance between particle and pore walls , those forces are quite notable and give rise to significant potential barriers against the particle s entrance into the pore .",
    "the dominating contribution is due to the mutual repulsion of the counterions which screen the surface charges , resulting in an repulsive pressure force on those parts of the particle which are entering the counterion cloud .",
    "a second contribution is due to the combined net effect of all the induced dipoles in the particle and the ambient fluid . under typical experimental conditions",
    "those dielectric forces are , however , much weaker than the counterion pressure forces .",
    "this is in striking contrast to the extensively studied opposite case of a charged particle , entering a neutral pore @xcite .    what happens if both the pore and the particle are charged ?",
    "while a systematic exploration of this issue goes beyond the scope of our present paper , we briefly may point out the main features of our numerical findings in the special case that the pore and the particle both carried the same surface charge @xmath11 mc / m@xmath12 ( all other parameters as in fig . [ fig4 ] ( a ) , ( c),(e ) ) : the forces @xmath178 exhibited almost the same shapes as those in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ( a ) , while their amplitudes increased by about a factor of five .",
    "the forces @xmath176 did not resemble those from fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ( b ) at all , rather they now were almost ( but not exactly ) proportional to @xmath178 with proportionality constants close to unity .",
    "as a consequence , also the total forces @xmath104 were similar to those from fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ( e ) , except that the amplitudes were larger by about a factor of ten .",
    "in particular , these findings can not be understood by simply superimposing the cases of an uncharged particle and of an uncharged pore .",
    "we also note that while @xmath200 can still be associated with the counterion pressure effects ( cf .",
    "[ fig1](b ) and eq .",
    "( [ 17a ] ) ) , @xmath201 now comprises not only the dielectric forces but also the only partially screened electrostatic repulsion between the equally charged particle and pore walls ( cf . fig . [",

    "regarding potential applications , a particularly interesting direction may be ultrafiltration @xcite , especially the design of sieves for uncharged ( and possibly even non - polarizable ) nanoparticles , whose particle sorting characteristics can be adjusted by means of the ion concentration , see fig .",
