    "this paper investigates systems of differential equations of the type @xmath1 where @xmath2 @xmath3 , the functions @xmath4 @xmath5 , and @xmath6 are sufficiently smooth of class @xmath7 with some positive integer @xmath8 .",
    "the function @xmath9 is @xmath10-periodic , and @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 are parameters .",
    "we assume that for @xmath14 the unperturbed system @xmath15 has an exponentially orbitally stable quasi - periodic solution of modulated wave type @xmath16 here @xmath17 and @xmath18 are constants , while @xmath19 and @xmath20 are smooth @xmath10-periodic functions .",
    "we assume that the following nondegeneracy condition holds : @xmath21=2.\\ ] ] it is easy to verify that ( [ > 0 ] ) is true for all @xmath22 if it is true for one @xmath23 .",
    "moreover , without loss of generality we assume that @xmath24 is periodic , i.e.  the curve @xmath25 in @xmath26 does not loop around the origin ( otherwise we should replace @xmath27 by @xmath28 and @xmath29 by @xmath30 with an appropriate @xmath31 ) .",
    "it follows from assumption ( [ > 0 ] ) that the set @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the unit circle , is diffeomorphic to a two - dimensional torus .",
    "obviously , @xmath34 is invariant with respect to the flow of ( [ eq:010])([eq:020 ] ) , and the solution ( [ qp ] ) lies on @xmath34 .",
    "roughly speaking , our main result describes the domain in the three - dimensional space of the control parameters @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 with @xmath38 and @xmath39 such that the following holds : for almost any solution @xmath40 to ( [ 01])([02 ] ) , which is at a certain moment close to @xmath34 , there exists @xmath41 such that @xmath42    let us reformulate our result in a more abstract language as well as in the language of a physical application .    abstractly speaking , ( [ eq:010])([eq:020 ] )",
    "is an autonomous system which is equivariant under the @xmath43-action @xmath44 , @xmath45 , on the phase space .",
    "the solution ( [ qp ] ) is a so - called modulated wave solution or relative periodic orbit to the @xmath43-equivariant system ( [ eq:010])([eq:020 ] ) .",
    "it is well - known that generically those solutions are structurally stable under small perturbations that do not destroy the autonomy and the @xmath43-equivariance of the system .",
    "thus , our results describe the behavior of exponentially orbitally stable modulated wave solutions to @xmath43-equivariant systems under external forcings of modulated wave type in the case when the difference between the internal and the external modulation frequencies @xmath46 is small while the difference between the internal and the external wave frequencies @xmath47 is large .",
    "note that in @xcite related results are described for the case when both differences of modulation and wave frequencies are small , and @xcite considers the case when the internal state as well as the external forcing are not modulated . for an even more abstract setting of these results see @xcite .    system ( [ 01])([02 ] ) is a paradigmatic model for the dynamical behavior of self - pulsating lasers under the influence of external periodically modulated optical signals . for more involved",
    "mathematical models see , e.g. , @xcite and for related experimental results see @xcite . in ( [ 01])([02 ] ) , the state variables @xmath48 and @xmath49 describe the electron density and the optical field of the laser , respectively . in particular ,",
    "the absolute value @xmath50 describes the intensity of the optical field .",
    "the @xmath43-equivariance of ( [ eq:010])([eq:020 ] ) is the result of the invariance of autonomous optical models with respect to shifts of optical phases .",
    "the solution ( [ qp ] ) describes a so - called self - pulsating state of the laser in the case when the laser is driven by electric currents which are constant in time . in those states",
    "the electron density and the intensity of the optical field are time periodic with the same frequency .",
    "self - pulsating states usually appear as a result of hopf bifurcations from so - called continuous wave states , where the electron density and the intensity of the optical field are constant in time .",
