    "medical applications of ionizing radiation are the most important sources irradiation of the population .",
    "ionizing radiation is used in medicine in three areas : nuclear medicine , radiotherapy and diagnostic radiology , the latter use x - ray equipment to obtain images of the inside of the patient s body .",
    "dosimetric investigations in diagnostic radiology have been increasing in importance in the last two decades .",
    "the most widely used technique in radiation dosimetry is thermoluminescence ( tl ) .",
    "several types of thermoluminescent dosimeters ( tld ) are commercially available for a wide range of applications : personnel , environment and medical dosimetry , nuclear accidents , etc .",
    "lithium fluoride doped with magnesium and titanium , known commercially as tld-100 , is still the most commonly used radiation dosimeter .",
    "it has become popular because of several properties , such as tissue equivalence , relative low fading and the possibility to manufacture the material with acceptable reproducibility @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "tld-100 has some features that do not entirely suitable for use in low dose x - ray such as low sensitivity ( which is why it is necessary to calibrate every use ) , poor detection threshold and disagreement in several reports about the fading @xcite , @xcite , @xcite . in this work",
    "this material was used only as a reference dosimeter .",
    "other material with nearly tissue equivalence is lithium fluoride doped with magnesium , copper , and phosphorus ( lif : mg , cu , p ) @xcite and @xcite .",
    "it has several important advantages compared to tld-100 such as higher sensitivity , low fading , good detection threshold ; however , this has not yet been proposed for routinely use for dosimetric applications as the tld-100 .",
    "on the other hand , there are materials over - respond due to their higher effective atomic number @xmath3 .",
    "thus , they have higher sensitivity and are characterized as non - tissue equivalent materials .",
    "this materials are calcium sulfate ( caso@xmath0 ) and calcium fluoride ( caf@xmath4 ) among others and are used for environmental monitoring .    for environmental monitoring of conventional medical installations",
    ", dosimeters should be placed at least a month , so its fading in this period of time should be the minimum .",
    "calcium fluoride presents a rapid fading in a short period of time @xcite , @xcite , therefore this materials are not suitable for routine monitoring of low dose x - ray .",
    "calcium sulfate has advantages for environmental tld .",
    "it can easily be prepared , is @xmath5 30 times as sensitive as tld-100 , and exhibits considerably less fading than calcium fluoride @xcite .",
    "however this characteristics have been realized for indoor dosimetry of gamma radiation areas in around of the nuclear installations in the worldwide @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "but not there are measurements of environmental x radiation delivered in medical installations .",
    "the aim of this study is to determine the dosimetric characteristic of two different thermoluminescent materials lif : mg , cu , p and pellets synthesized in mexico based on caso@xmath0:dy , and compared them with tld-100 for low dose x - rays used in diagnostic radiology in similar conditions or close to real working conditions which may reduce the uncertainties associated with commercial tlds .",
    "the materials and equipment used are listed below :    * tl dosimeters * * 18 chips of tld-100 of @xmath6 and @xmath7 thick .",
    "( harshaw chemical company , solon , oh , usa ) . * * 20 discs of @xmath8 diameter and @xmath9 thick of caso@xmath0:dy ( cicata - legaria , ipn ) . * * 16 discs of @xmath10 diameter and @xmath9 thick of lif : mg , cu , p ( mikrolab s.c . , poland ) . * harshaw thermo scientific tld reader ( model 3500 ) . * harshaw thermolyne heating muffle ( model 1400 ) . * radcal accu - gold+ multisensor ( model agms - d ) . * conventional x - ray equipment ( cmr model mrh - ii e gmx 325af sbv-1 with rotating anode x - ray tube ) .",
    "dosimeters received a standard annealing treatment before exposure to radiation .",
    "depending on the type of material , thermal annealing schemes were : @xmath11c for 10 minutes to lif : mg , cu , p and @xmath12c for 30 minutes to caso@xmath0:dy and @xmath13c for 1 hour followed by @xmath14c for 2 hours to tld-100 .",
    "the method of slow cooling inside the muffle was used to reach room temperature for all cases .",
    "the radiation was performed with a conventional x - ray equipment of radiology area at hospital mxico specifically designed for general radiographic procedures .",
    "the readings of the tl materials are performed in a reader .",
    "the reading cycles were varied depending on the material as shown in table [ t1 ] . in order to eliminate the contribution by triboluminescence",
    "all readings were performed in an atmosphere of high purity n@xmath4 .",
    ".reading parameters for tld materials [ cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]     figure [ fa ] shows the the dose - response curve for an @xmath15 x - ray in the low dose in log - log scale . a linear plot in the log- log scale with the slope equal to 1 indicates a linear dose response .",
    "the error bars in the graph corresponds to @xmath16% .",
    "non - linearity , as reported by some authors @xcite , @xcite was observed for the tld-100 below @xmath2 .",

    "i.e. _ , @xmath18% for tld-100 , @xmath19% for caso@xmath0:dy and @xmath20% for the lif : mg , cu , p .",
    "in general the three materials showed very good repeatability for low dose x - ray . in figure [ f2 ] , the values for all materials",
    "are presented and include error bar of 5% .",
    "caso@xmath0:dy is about 82% more sensitivity than tld-100 , while the lif : mg , cu , p was about 66% higher than the tld-100 . in other investigations",
    "@xcite , @xcite , @xcite have been reported sensitivity factor values about 60% more than tld-100 for caso@xmath0:dy .",
    "the most sensitive is caso@xmath0:dy and the second one is lif : mg , cu , p . among all materials the tld-100 presented the lowest tl sensitivity .",
    "it is not easy to compare sensitivity values obtained in this study with those from the literature , because this parameter varies significantly with beam energy .",
    "most frequently , sensitivity values are presented for the @xmath21co energy , which are not useful for dosimetry purposes in low energy beams .",
    "the results obtained showed that , in the diagnostic radiology energy range , the differences in sensitivity among the materials are even more accentuated than for the high energy beam of @xmath21co .",
    "typical tl reproducibility values are between 2% and 10% @xcite , @xcite,@xcite , @xcite .",
    "the results of this study were all within the expected range . moreover , all materials , presented very good performance , with reproducibility values below 4% .        from the three materials , lif : mg , cu",
    ", p presents less reproducibility , reading up to @xmath22 was not enough to annealing . specifically , there is a distribution of traps associated with low intensity peaks located between @xmath23 and @xmath24 that are not annealed @xcite .",
    "for this reason , upon reading residual signals remain dependent on their dosimetric history , so after a certain time measurement reproducibility is impoverished .    in figures",
    "[ f4a ] , [ f4b ] and [ f4c ] , fading of peaks of glow curves for the three materials are shown in a period of one month .",
    "it is observed clearly the slight decrease in the intensity of the dosimetric peak for each of the materials , the first peak had a higher fading , completely disappearing at the @xmath25 for the tld-100 and caso@xmath0:dy and @xmath26 ( 1 month ) for lif : mg , cu , p .",
    ": dy from 3 hours ( note 24h ) up to 1 month ( note 720h ) after irradiation.,width=264 ]    the above mentioned figures ( [ f4a ] , [ f4b ] and [ f4c ] ) show a small shift to higher temperature are seen in the peak temperature of the main dosimetry peak .",
    "it is known that a glow peak with kinetic order greater than one ( non - first - order tl glow peak ) shifts to higher temperatures with decreasing the population of trapping states . storing the tl dosimeter causes depopulation of trapping states due to fading .",
    "therefore , the tl glow peaks shift to higher temperature with increase in storage time .        by analyzing the relative intensities ( as shown in figure [ fr ] ) obtained for each measurement , the tld-100 showed a slow fading ( 11% ) for a period of 3 hours to 48 hours , after this the fading was 15% between 48h and 720h . in the case of caso@xmath0:dy",
    "the fading was 11% between 3h and 48h and 35% from 48h up to 720h presenting the greatest fading compared to other materials .",
    "finally , lif : mg , cu , p presented a fading of 7% between 3h and 48h and slow fading ( 8.8% ) from 48h until 720h post irradiation .",
    "the caso@xmath0:dy was the material with a higher fading in the period of one month at room temperature , which is in agreement with that reported in the literature @xcite , @xcite , in the case tld-100 showed a high fading as reported by @xcite and @xcite , while the lif : mg , cu , p dosimeter was experienced slower fading due to loss of some of the initially trapped charges , between irradiation and reading the influence of heat ( even at room temperature , thermal fading ) or exposure to unwanted light ( optical fading ) . it is further known that the response of lif : mg , cu , p is more stable at ambient temperature than the tld-100 @xcite , @xcite .",
    "in this research , thermoluminescence materials lif : mg , cu , p and caso@xmath0:dy were characterized to low doses of x - rays , which correspond to radiological diagnosis by the following dosimetric tests : homogeneity batch reproducibility , sensitive factor , detection threshold , linearity and fading .",
    "the experiments were carried out simultaneously with the tests for tld-100 , so that the results are directly comparable .",
    "the materials have a linear behavior for the range of doses studied ( caso@xmath0:dy and lif : mg , cu , p ) . tl reading for tld-100 have a high uncertainty below @xmath2",
    "so we conclude that is not precise and it has a non - linear behavior in the dose range described above .",
    "this findings are very important and should be made available to researchers and medical practitioners that they use tld-100 dosimeters for low dose measurement in diagnostic radiology .",
    "the caso@xmath0:dy is the material with higher threshold detection with very high sensitivity to low doses x - rays so we suggest its use in environmental and personal dosimetry in diagnostic radiology .",
    "lif : mg , cu , p has high sensitivity and excellent dosimetric characteristics better than the tld-100 , and is the material that show fewer fading in natural light and environmental conditions .",
    "we suggest its use for monitoring both environmental and occupational doses in rooms with low doses of radiation .",
    "finally we conclude that the system formed by the caso@xmath0:dy and lif : mg , cu , p is effective for detection of very low doses delivered by x - ray equipment .",
    "this system is very useful to physiologists , medical physics , occupationally exposed workers , etc .",
    "our final suggestion is that in every area of health where work with ionizing radiation combined use of both materials becomes necessary to achieve a comprehensive dosimetry monitoring .",
