    "the initial mass - final mass relation ( ifmr ) characterises the amount of material stars with primordial masses m@xmath610m@xmath1 cast out into interstellar space during post main sequence evolution , en route to becoming white dwarfs .",
    "accordingly , the form of this relation is of considerable importance to investigations relating to the chemical evolution of the milky way and galaxies in general .",
    "the details of the upper end of the ifmr also have relevance to supernovae studies since theoretical predictions of the rate of these explosions are rather sensitive to the assumed minimum mass of a core - collapse progenitor .",
    "furthermore , the form of the ifmr conveys information on the mass loss processes which occur during the final stages of stellar evolution , which are difficult to model in a physical context .",
    "arguably the most robust method with which to place ( semi- ) empirical constraints on the form of the ifmr is via the study of white dwarfs in open clusters ( e.g. weidemann 1977 , romanischin & angel 1980 , weidemann 2000 ) .",
    "since the constituents of an open cluster have a common age , determinable from the main sequence turn - off mass ( e.g. king & schuler 2005 ) , the lifetime of a progenitor star can be estimated from the difference between this age and the cooling time of the resulting white dwarf .",
    "subsequently , the progenitor masses can be determined by comparing their estimated lifetimes to the predictions of stellar evolutionary models .",
    "unfortunately , until quite recently , the small numbers of wds recovered in each open cluster ( @xmath230 wds in 14 clusters ) , their intrinsic faintness and the significant distances involved has meant that the uncertainties in clusters ages and in white dwarf mass determinations ( and hence cooling time estimates ) , have conspired to produce significant scatter in the semi - empirical ifmr ( e.g. claver et al .",
    "encouragingly , with time on 8/10 m class telescopes now readily available , this situation is beginning to improve .",
    "for example , kalirai et al .",

    "( 2005 ) have spectroscopically identified 16 and 6 likely white dwarf members of the rich but relatively distant open clusters m37 and m35 respectively .",
    "these two populations of white dwarfs are found to be consistent with a monotonically increasing ifmr for progenitor mass ranges m@xmath22.8 - 3.4m@xmath1 and m@xmath24.5 - 5.5m@xmath1 , respectively .    nevertheless , while significant additional pieces of the jigsaw puzzle have recently been put in place",
    ", much work remains to be done before we are able to claim a thorough understanding of the ifmr .",
    "accordingly , we recently embarked on a search for white dwarfs members of the modestly rich and relatively nearby praesepe open cluster ( m44 , ngc2632 ) . using proper motions measurements and photographic photometry drawn from the usno - b1.0 catalogue and supercosmos archive we identified 6 new candidates in a @xmath7 region centered on the cluster , to add to the five previously known praesepe white dwarfs .",
    "futhermore , two of these new candidates were confirmed spectroscopically .",
    "full details of these objects are given in table 1 of dobbie et al .",
    "( 2004 ) .    in this work we present new low resolution optical spectroscopy which confirms that the four remaining candidates are also white dwarfs .",
    "additionally , we use new data to provide refined estimates of the effective temperatures and surface gravities of lb5959 and wd0837 + 218 .",
    "we re - examine the membership status of each of these objects and present a new astrometric measurement of the high mass `` praesepe '' white dwarf lb5893 which establishes that it has a proper motion which is consistent with cluster membership .",
    "we discuss the implications of our findings in relation to the initial mass function of praesepe and kinematic effects of mass loss in the final stages of the evolution of the white dwarf progenitors . adopting an age of 625@xmath8myrs for the cluster",
    ", we estimate the masses of these progenitor stars and examine our results in the context of previous work on the initial mass - final mass relation .",
    "we have acquired optical spectra ( 3200 - 6000 ) of the four remaining candidate white dwarf members of praesepe from dobbie et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , using the william herschel telescope and the isis spectrograph .",

    "sky conditions were good on the first and third nights with clear skies and seeing @xmath20.7 - 0.9  .",
    "on the second night there was some thin and patchy cirrus and seeing was slightly poorer , @xmath21.0 - 1.2  .",

    "the hydrogen line broadening was addressed in the following manner : the broadening by heavy perturbers ( protons and hydrogen atoms ) and electrons was treated using allard s data ( including the quasi - molecular opacity ) and an approximate stark profile ( hubeny , hummer & lanz 1994 ) respectively . in the spectral synthesis step",
    "detailed profiles for the balmer lines were calculated from the stark broadening tables of lemke ( 1997 ) .      as discussed in dobbie et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , comparison between the models and the data is undertaken using the spectral fitting program xspec ( shafer et al .",
    "xspec works by folding a model through the instrument response before comparing the result to the data by means of a @xmath41statistic .",
    "the best fit model representation of the data is found by incrementing free grid parameters in small steps , linearly interpolating between points in the grid , until the value of @xmath42 is minimised .",
    "errors in the t@xmath10s and log g s are calculated by stepping the parameter in question away from its optimum value and redetermining minimum @xmath42 until the difference between this and the true minimum @xmath42 corresponds to @xmath43 for a given number of free model parameters ( e.g. lampton et al .",
    "1976 ) .    given the probable age of the praesepe cluster ( @xmath2600 - 700myrs ) , a number of the white dwarf members may have effective temperatures approaching that at which the h - balmer lines reach their maximum equivalent width ( t@xmath10@xmath212500 - 13500k ) .",
    "previous spectroscopic studies of da white dwarfs in this temperature regime indicate that the sensitivity to surface gravity of the equivalent widths of the lower order balmer lines ( e.g. h-@xmath44 , h-@xmath45 ) is reduced here ( e.g. daou et al .",
    "therefore , in the present analysis all lines from h-@xmath44 to h-8 are included in the fitting process .",
    "furthermore , given that we assign each line an independent normalisation parameter , there is the potential for obtaining two solutions for t@xmath10 in this regime ( e.g. gianninas et al . 2005 ) .",
    "hence minimum @xmath42 has been approached from both the high and low temperature ends of the model grid .",
    "no convincing fit with t@xmath10@xmath4613500k is found to any of the datasets ; the overall spectral shape of the data ( ie . lines and",

    "the results of our fitting procedure are given in table 1 and shown overplotted on the data in figure 1 .",
    "as a check for potential systematic errors ( e.g. napiwotzki et al .",

    "differences between individual results were found to be well within the error limits quoted in table 1 and no significant systematic discrepancies were apparent .",
    "nevertheless , it should be noted that the parameter errors quoted here are formal @xmath43 fit errors and may underestimate the true uncertainties .",
    "we have used modern evolutionary tracks supplied by the montreal group ( e.g. fontaine , brassard & bergeron 2001 ) to determine the masses and cooling times of our four new white dwarfs .",
    "we have adopted the calculations which include a mixed co core and thick h surface layer structure , which make this work consistent with other recent studies in this area ( e.g. liebert et al .",
    "the masses and cooling times shown in table 1 have been derived using cubic splines to interpolate between points in this grid . at the present level of precision",
    "these mass determinations are not sensitive to our choice of core composition . however",
    ", if instead we had adopted thin h - layer models these estimates would be systematically lower by 0.02m@xmath1 .",
    "nevertheless , we can conclude that all four white dwarfs have masses which are significantly larger than those typical of field white dwarfs , the distribution of which is found to be strongly peaked at 0.565m@xmath1 ( e.g. liebert et al .",
    "2005b , bergeron , liebert & fulbright 1995 , marsh et al .",
    "these comparatively high masses and the projected spatial distribution of the white dwarfs ( figure 2 ) argue that our objects are associated with the praesepe open cluster .    in an effort to quantify the level of contamination by field white dwarfs in our assembly of probable praesepe members",
    ", we have repeated our original survey procedure on four 5@xmath47@xmath485@xmath47 fields flanking the cluster to the ne , nw , se and sw . only 2 objects in total have been flagged as candidate white dwarf members of praesepe according to the selection criteria we applied in dobbie et al .",
    "there is no guarantee that spectroscopic data would confirm either of these two objects to be a white dwarf .",
    "thus we conclude that contamination by field white dwarfs is at a very low level .",
    "nevertheless , it is worth recalling here that lb5893 , one of the five `` original '' white dwarf members of praesepe , was not recovered by our survey . since luyten ( 1966 ) measured a proper motion of @xmath49cos @xmath50=-34 mas yr@xmath51 , @xmath52=-14 mas yr@xmath51 , albeit with large uncertainties , in dobbie et al .",
    "( 2004 ) we concluded that the usno - b1.0 astrometry of @xmath49cos @xmath50=@xmath056 mas yr@xmath51 , @xmath52=@xmath014 mas yr@xmath51 , may have been adversely affected by the proximity of the star kw195 .",
    "claver et al . ( 2001 ) previously reached a similar conclusion on finding that their proper motion measurement of this object , which relied on poss - i plates for epoch 1 , also failed to confirm cluster membership .",
    "given the lingering uncertainties in the proper motion of lb5893 and the rather peculiar location of this object in the semi - empirical ifmr ( see figure 11 of claver et al .",
    "2001 ) , we have used the poss - ii f band image ( 1989/11/08 ) and a v band image ( 2001/02/04 ) obtained from the canada - france - hawaii telescope archive at the canadian astrophysical data center to obtain a refined astrometric measurement for lb5893 .",
    "our estimate of @xmath49cos @xmath50=@xmath034@xmath39 mas yr@xmath51 , @xmath52=@xmath018@xmath312 mas yr@xmath51 supports the original proper motion determination of luyten ( 1966 ) and argues strongly that lb5893 is a member of praesepe .",
    "therefore in the subsequent discussion we accept that the number of praesepe white dwarfs is at least eleven .",

    "thus in the context of the cluster simulations of williams et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , in reflection , it seems more appropriate to compare our results to the predicted observable number of single white dwarfs ( ie .",
    "the predicted total observed number - the predicted number observed in binaries ) .",

    "accordingly , we adjudge that there is not a deficit of white dwarfs , at least single objects , in this open cluster . if our conclusion is correct then these results suggest that the bulk of praesepe white dwarfs did not gain a significant recoil kick velocity from possible asymmetries in their loss of mass during the asymptotic giant branch phase of evolution .",
    "fellhauer et al .",
    "( 2003 ) find that if the mean kick velocity extended to a white dwarf during this phase is greater than twice the cluster velocity dispersion ( the one - dimensional velocity dispersion of praesepe is 0.67@xmath30.23kms@xmath51 ; madsen et al .",
    "2002 ) then a significant fraction of these objects evaporate from the cluster ( @xmath6760% at 600 - 700myrs ) .",
    "the metalicities of the praesepe and the hyades open clusters are found , within uncertainties , to be very similar .",
    "for example , cayrel de strobel ( 1990 ) and boesgaard & budge ( 1988 ) determine [ fe / h]=0.10@xmath30.06 and [ fe / h]=0.13@xmath30.07 respectively for the former , while cayrel , cayrel de strobel & campbell ( 1985 ) and perryman et al .",
    "( 1998 ) find [ fe / h]=0.12@xmath30.03 and [ fe / h]=0.14@xmath30.05 respectively , for the latter .",
    "furthermore , it has been recognised for decades that the space motions of the two clusters are comparable ( e.g. schwarzchild & hertzsprung 1913 , eggen 1992 , madsen et al .",
    "2002 ) , leading to the suggestion that praesepe is a member of a hyades supercluster .",
    "if this is the case it is likely that the ages of the two clusters are similar .",
    "the bulk of determinations place the age of the hyades cluster in the range 500 - 900myrs ( e.g. barry et al .",
    "1981 , kroupa 1995 ) .",
    "perryman et al .",
    "( 1998 ) have estimated an age of 625@xmath350myrs by fitting theoretical isochrones , which included a treatment for convective overshoot , to the hipparcos - based cluster hertzsprung - russell diagram .",

    "they conclude that the upper main sequence is poorly reproduced by the 1000myr isochrone but can be considered consistent with either of the two younger models .",
    "in addition , recent work on the x - ray properties of solar type praesepe members reveals that these are similar to those of the f and g stars of the hyades ( franciosini et al .",
    "furthermore , we note that the most detailed study to date of the spatial distribution and dynamics of the cluster ( adams et al . 2002 ) finds no evidence for the existence of a sub - cluster as suggested by holland et al .",
    "therefore , we follow claver et al .",
    "( and more recently ferrario et al .",
    "2005 ) and in our subsequent discussion assume the age of praesepe is 625@xmath350myrs .",
    "we have derived the lifetime of the progenitor star of each of the four new white dwarf members by subtracting the estimated cooling time , shown in table 1 , from the adopted cluster age .",
    "the results of this process are shown in table 2 .",
    "for consistency , we obtained new spectroscopy of comparable quality for wd0837 + 218 and wd0837 + 185 ( figure 1 ) and analysed it using our new grid of model atmospheres .",
    "thus we also provide in tables 1 and 2 , revised effective temperatures , surface gravities , masses , cooling times and progenitor lifetimes for these two objects .",
    "we note that the bulk of the discrepancy between the new and old parameter estimates for these two objects stems from the different datasets used in the two analyses .",
    "the spectral datasets in dobbie et al .",
    "( 2004 ) were of comparatively low quality and the true level of uncertainty in the associated effective temperature and surface gravity estimates appears to have been slightly underestimated by our formal error analysis .",
    "subsequently , we have used cubic splines to interpolate between the lifetimes calculated for stars of solar composition by girardi et al .",
    "( 2000 ) and have constrained the masses of these six progenitors to the values shown in table 2 .",
    "the quoted errors take into account the uncertainty in the cluster age . the locations in initial mass - final mass space of all six of these objects and the five original praesepe white dwarfs , where their masses , cooling times and progenitor lifetimes and progenitor masses have been derived on the basis of the effective temperature and surface gravity measurements of claver et al .",

    "( 2003 ) , we prefer an age of 160@xmath325myrs , the progenitor mass for each of these white dwarfs is derived assuming the system / cluster age and metalicity adopted by ferrario et al .",
    "the upper limits to the progenitor masses of the white dwarf members of ngc2516 and the pleiades displayed in figure 3 have been determined by supplementing the model grid of girardi with an evolutionary calculation for a 9m@xmath1 star drawn from a grid of a previous generation of the padova models ( bressan et al .",

    ". it has been suggested that a significant proportion of the white dwarfs in this secondary peak may be the progeny of close binary systems .",
    "the initial mass - final mass data shown in figure 3 can be reasonably approximated by a linear function . in deriving the co - efficients for this",
    "we exclude the two objects which appear to deviate most strongly from the general relation as these most likely result from close binary evolution .",
    "additionally , we choose to reject from the our fit the magnetic white dwarf eg61 as the true uncertainties in the effective temperature and surface gravity determinations for this star , obtained from the zeeman split profiles of the balmer lines , could be significantly larger than the formal errors quoted by claver et al .",

    "we note that had we adopted pure - c core white dwarf evolutionary models , the cooling times would have been systematically larger by between 5 - 30myrs , resulting in shorter progenitor lifetimes , larger progenitor masses and a marginally flatter imfr ( a@xmath4=0.304 , a@xmath5=0.127 ; dashed line ) . in either case",

    "we find most stars appear to follow , relatively closely , a monotonic relation between their initial and final masses .",

    "<S> we report the spectroscopic confirmation of four further white dwarf members of praesepe . </S>",
    "<S> this brings the total number of confirmed white dwarf members to eleven making this the second largest collection of these objects in an open cluster identified to date . </S>",
    "<S> this number is consistent with the high mass end of the initial mass function of praesepe being salpeter in form . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , it suggests that the bulk of praesepe white dwarfs did not gain a substantial recoil kick velocity from possible asymmetries in their loss of mass during the asymptotic giant branch phase of evolution . by comparing our estimates of the effective temperatures and the surface gravities of wd0833 + 194 , wd0840 + 190 , wd0840 + 205 and wd0843 + 184 to modern theoretical evolutionary tracks </S>",
    "<S> we have derived their masses to be in the range 0.72@xmath00.76m@xmath1 and their cooling ages @xmath2300myrs . for an assumed cluster age of 625@xmath350myrs the infered progenitor masses are between 3.3@xmath03.5m@xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> examining these new data in the context of the initial mass - final mass relation we find that it can be adequately represented by a linear function ( a@xmath4=0.289@xmath30.051 , a@xmath5=0.133@xmath30.015 ) over the initial mass range 2.7m@xmath1 to 6m@xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> assuming an extrapolation of this relation to larger initial masses is valid and adopting a maximum white dwarf mass of 1.3m@xmath1 , our results support a minimum mass for core - collapse supernovae progenitors in the range @xmath26.8 - 8.6m@xmath1 .    </S>",
