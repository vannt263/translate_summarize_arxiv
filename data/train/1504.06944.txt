    "recently , it was reported in @xcite ( see also  @xcite ) that a possible gev - scale gamma - ray excess might be due to dm annihilation into @xmath0 with canonical cross section .",
    "the most discussed higgs - portal dm models are the following effectively described theories , @xmath1 for spin 0,1/2 , and 1 , respectively . in the above lagrangian , the only relevant new degree of freedom is the dark matter field and all other fields have been assumed heavy and integrated out . here , we have neglected the kinetic terms and possible self - interaction terms for dm as well .",
    "however , the reported gamma - ray excess is usually explained through the annihilation channel , fig .",

    "this would naturally lead to large scattering cross section for direct detection in fig .",

    "is not discussed here .    ]",
    "we consider a vector dark matter , @xmath4 , which is associated with dark gauge symmetry , taking @xmath5 as an example .",
    "the simplest model will be the one including only a complex scalar @xmath6 , whose vacuum expectation value ( vev ) is responsible for the mass of @xmath4 : @xmath7 we here neglected the kinetic mixing term @xmath8 , but for non - abelian groups , such term does not appear .",
    "more details can be found in @xcite and other phenomenologies is also discussed in @xcite .",
    "the above covariant derivative @xmath9 on @xmath6 is defined as @xmath10 assuming that the @xmath5-charged complex scalar @xmath6 develops a nonzero vev , @xmath11 , @xmath12 which breaks @xmath5 spontaneously .",
    "therefore @xmath4 gets mass @xmath13 , and dark higgs field @xmath14 will mix with the sm higgs field @xmath15 through the higgs - portal @xmath16 term .",
