    "fermilab calculation @xcite is only at the end point . ]",
    "interestingly , the @xmath6 values measured by  @xcite exceed sm expectations by @xmath15 and as much as @xmath16 respectively , and if taken together , disagree with the sm by about @xmath17 . on the other hand , older belle results used to lie in between the sm expectation and the  measurement and were consistent with both @xcite .",
    "latest belle results @xcite using the full data sample of @xmath18 @xmath19 pairs is completely consistent with sm within @xmath20 .",
    "lhcb announced the results of their first measurement of @xmath21 @xcite , and their result is @xmath22 larger than the value expected in sm .",
    "both  and belle have analyzed the effects of the charged higgs of type 2hdm - ii on @xmath6 .",
    "analysis shows that in 2hdm - ii , the measured values of @xmath23 and @xmath21 can not be explained simultaneously by any point in the @xmath24 - @xmath25 parameter space which is allowed by the data .",
    "hence , 2hdm - ii as a possible new physics ( np ) candidate was excluded by  at @xmath26 confidence level , while the earlier belle measurement is consistent with the 2hdm - ii prediction given in the regions around @xmath27 @xcite .",
    "as is already mentioned , latest belle result @xcite does not require 2hdm or any other np .",
    "also , since lhcb can not do @xmath28 semileptonic decays , they can not make statements about 2hdm - ii .    in passing we mention that a similar pattern , but with even bigger errors , is observed in the   and belle measurements on the branching fractions of the purely leptonic decay @xmath29 which uses both the leptonic and hadronic channels for the identification of @xmath0 .",
    "note in particular that , both the experiments had earlier used only the leptonic channels for the identification of @xmath0 in the measurements of @xmath30 . only in their latest analysis @xcite",
    ", belle has used hadronic channels for @xmath0 reconstruction .",
    "we think it is rather useful to examine @xmath31 simultaneously , when possible , with @xmath32 for a variety of reasons .",
    "for one , if @xmath32 is showing deviation(s ) from the sm , then it stands to reason that @xmath31 may also do the same .",
    "also @xmath32 may be suffering from background contaminations ( e.g. from higher charm resonances ) that are difficult to deal with , whereas @xmath31 may not have that difficulty and therefore to that extent may be more reliable .",
    "moreover , since detection of @xmath0 is involved both in @xmath32 and in @xmath31 , by studying them together as by our proposed ratio , eq.([rtaudeq ] ) , if there are any unknown systematics affecting the @xmath0 detection then they will tend to largely cancel .",
    "finally , in a large class of new physics models that affect the @xmath33 vertex , the effect of new physics will tend to cancel in the ratio @xmath34 so this ratio may serve as a very good diagnostic of the new physics .    of course",
    ", the experimental measurement of @xmath31 in itself is extremely demanding and the accuracy of the measurements to date are fairly limited ( as elaborated in section [ sec : smexp ] below ) but our point in suggesting these correlation(s ) is to emphasize their importance for the long run ; in particular , in view of the much larger data sets that will become available from belle - ii in the near future .",
    "moreover , since @xmath23 and @xmath35 are independent of @xmath13 , we emphasize the importance of analogous ratios for semileptonic decays @xmath36 and similarly for @xmath37 ( see eq.([rtaupi ] ) ) .",
    "in tables [ tab : taubabar ] and [ tab : taubelle ] , the  and belle measured values of the @xmath39 are shown , using leptonic and hadronic decays of @xmath0 separately .",

    "now , @xmath0 decay channels include both the hadronic and leptonic final states .",
    "therefore , we can define observables like @xmath90 , for individual @xmath0 channels . for each of these ratios ,",
    "any ( unknown ) systematics due to the @xmath0 identification is expected to cancel in the ratio @xmath91 .",

    ". consequently , this tends to increase the theory error in this observable but perhaps for testing the validity of the sm , this cautious approach has an advantage .",

    "also , as alluded to before , we want to emphasize again that the consistency with the sm in fig .",
    "[ rnrnst ] or table [ tab : rtaudst ] does not necessarily mean that it rules out presence of new physics .",

    "in fact our analysis of @xmath201 explicitly shows that type ii-2hdm in the region of @xmath202 larger than about 500 gev with tan@xmath203 less than about 25 is allowed ; in this important respect we reach at a different conclusion than the   analysis .",
    "indeed , the constraint obtained on the parameter space in @xmath174-@xmath25 plane is very similar to the one obtained from @xmath3 ; @xmath204 is not allowed by the present data in the case when @xmath205 _",
    "tev_.    this conclusion regarding the possible relevance of type - ii 2hdm is of special significance to super - symmetric theories as therein type ii-2hdm are crucial .",
    "analogously , we also study inclusive semileptonic decays of final states with @xmath0 in them .",
    "experimentally , these inclusive final states are especially challenging .",
    "however , at least for belle ii by ( partial ) re - construction of the  other b \" , this may have a chance and thereby one may be able to use the higher branching ratio of the inclusive mode . for this purpose",
    "we define @xmath97 for the inclusive decays @xmath206 , and find the constraints on 2hdm - ii parameter space . here too , the allowed regions are mostly dominated by the constraints from @xmath3 .",
    "in addition to the above observable we also study the ratio @xmath207 . at present , only an upper limit exists for this ratio , therefore we do not get strong bounds on @xmath174 or @xmath208 plane from this observable . also , large values of @xmath209 are still allowed . here too , more precise measurements are necessary to probe the presence for new physics . also , there are models of new physics which effect the two modes in the ratio differently",
    ". our newly defined observable may play an important role in distinguishing the possible signature of those new physics models from others .    for a reliable interpretation of new physics signals in semi - tauonic final states in b - decays , not only experimental and theoretical precision in those modes",
    "is needed but also more precise measurements of @xmath3 would help significantly .",
    "the expected larger data samples at belle ii by factors of around 25 to 50 should prove to be very useful in the next few years in this regard would be very valuable for other reasons as well  @xcite . ] .",
    "needless to say more accurate measurements of semi - tauonic modes would also go a long way .",
    "therein not only belle - ii but more data from lhcb should be forthcoming and should be very helpful in significantly reducing the current uncertainties . in all these interpretations lattice calculations play a crucial role and in the next few years in many quantities of interest to all this physics , percent or even sub - percent precision",
    "is , fortunately , anticipated . in this context , we want to reiterate that in lattice calculations , in the sm , in addition to @xmath32 , ratios analogous to @xmath34 ( see eq.([rtaudeq ] ) ) , @xmath145 , @xmath210 ( see eq.([rtaupi ] ) ) for @xmath46 , @xmath122 decays , with appropriate choices of @xmath211 relevant to charge - current semileptonic transitions , are desirable .",
    "this would ensure that correlations in lattice data are properly taken into account to enhance precision .",
