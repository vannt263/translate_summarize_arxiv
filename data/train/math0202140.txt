    "therefore , there is a @xmath301 such that the operator @xmath302 with symbol @xmath303 also has positive commutator with @xmath14 .",
    "however , following @xcite , we can turn @xmath302 into a differential operator @xmath304 of order @xmath305 , by letting @xmath306 the symbol @xmath145 is a polynomial on each fibre of @xmath149 , so we may take @xmath304 to be a differential operator .",

    "we need to apply the form which is valid for @xmath310 as opposed to @xmath311 which is the standard situation .",
    "this gives @xmath312 where @xmath9 is a positive constant depending on @xmath304 and @xmath313 .",
    "this can be derived from the usual grding inequality by writing @xmath314 , where @xmath91 solves the dirichlet problem @xmath315 with the same dirichlet data as @xmath1 .",
    "( here @xmath316 is a sufficiently large constant . )",
    "we then get an estimate on the @xmath317 norm of @xmath91 in terms of the boundary norms of @xmath1 appearing in . on the other hand",
    ", we can apply the standard grding inequality to @xmath318 .",
    "thus , and combined yield @xmath319 we can estimate the left hand side from below by a constant times @xmath320 .",
    "consider the right hand side .",
    "let us write @xmath321 , where @xmath78 is as in , so that @xmath91 satisfies .",
    "then @xmath322 , where @xmath323 is a differential operator of order @xmath305 .",
    "since @xmath78 is smooth , we obtain @xmath324 since @xmath325 at @xmath25 , and we are interested in @xmath326 , we may assume that @xmath327 , where @xmath328 has order @xmath329 .",
    "using , we may replace @xmath330 by @xmath331 repeatedly , until only @xmath332 terms remain .",
    "thus we have @xmath333 where @xmath334 is a differential operator on @xmath25 of order @xmath335 , independent of @xmath3 . hence becomes @xmath336 using the upper bound estimate on the sum over @xmath78 and for all terms in the sum over @xmath21 with @xmath337",
    ", we find @xmath338 finally , we estimate the last term in by @xmath339 , and absorb the @xmath340 term in the left hand side .",
    "this proves the lower bound .",
    "here we briefly discuss further examples which illustrate how the presence of trapped geodesics in the interior of @xmath0 affects the behaviour of eigenfunctions at the boundary .",
    "consider the manifold @xmath341 given in terms of coordinates @xmath45 as in , by @xmath342 let @xmath343 . here",
    ", the equator at @xmath344 is a trapped geodesic , as is every nearby geodesic , so this is an extreme case where there is a nonempty open set of periodic geodesics . in this case , there is a sequence of normalized dirichlet eigenfunctions @xmath345 where the lower bound fails spectacularly , namely there is exponential decay of @xmath346 : @xmath347 this follows by separating variables , @xmath348 , and reducing to a one dimensional problem where @xmath349 plays the role of a semiclassical parameter .",
    "the positive curvature of the sphere manifests itself as a potential function with a nondegenerate minimum at @xmath344 .",
    "well known estimates ( see e.g. @xcite , chapter 3 ) show that there are normalized eigenfunctions @xmath345 which localize near @xmath344 as @xmath350 .",
    "more precisely , for any @xmath351 and differential operator @xmath304 there are constants @xmath352 and @xmath20 such that @xmath353 in the set @xmath354 .",
    "if we then apply our upper bound argument from section  [ sec : rellich ] , which involves only the gradient of the eigenfunction near the boundary , we obtain .",

    "\\times s^1_\\phi , \\quad g = dy^2 + ( \\cosh y)^2   d\\phi^2.\\ ] ] again , there is a periodic geodesic at @xmath344 .",
    "however , this is the opposite extreme to the example above .",
    "now @xmath0 has negative curvature , the geodesic is unstable , and it is in fact the unique trapped geodesic on @xmath0 .",
    "( other geodesics may be trapped as @xmath356 or @xmath357 , but not both . ) using results of colin de verdire and parisse @xcite one can show that there is a sequence of normalized eigenfunctions @xmath345 , @xmath358 , such that @xmath359 thus , the lower bound is violated , but just barely .",
    "both this example and the previous one are based on sequences of eigenfunctions which microlocally concentrate at a periodic geodesic . since the geodesic is in the interior of the manifold ,",
    "the eigenfunctions are concentrated in the interior , and so are not as large near the boundary as one would normally expect .",
    "consider the unit disc , as in example 1 .",
    "there is a basis of neumann eigenfunctions of the form @xmath361 where @xmath362 is a normalization constant and @xmath363 denotes the @xmath78th zero of the derivative of the @xmath35th bessel function @xmath364 .",
    "the eigenvalue for this eigenfunction is @xmath365 .",
    "denoting the boundary value of this eigenfunction by @xmath366 , rellich s identity gives us @xmath367 this shows that there is a lower bound for @xmath368 .",
    "however , the first positive critical point of @xmath364 , @xmath369 , is known to have asymptotic @xmath370 so fixing @xmath371 and sending @xmath57 in shows that there is no upper bound for @xmath368 .",
    "we remark that it is not hard to derive a lower bound for _ convex _ euclidean domains from rellich s identity . on the other hand",
    ", the argument of example 5 applies equally to neumann eigenfunctions , so the lower bound is not generally valid .",
    "it is not clear to the authors whether the lower bound holds under the nontrapping assumption of theorem  [ main ] .",
    "one might wonder whether , on an arbitrary compact riemannian manifold , with no trapped geodesics ( that is , satisfying the conditions of theorem  [ main ] ) , one could choose a first order _ differential _",

    "we show via an example that this is impossible in general .",

    "let the symbol of @xmath59 be @xmath372 .",
    "the hamilton vector field of @xmath14 is @xmath373 , so having a positive commutator requires that @xmath374 thus , the matrix @xmath375 must be positive definite .",
    "now consider the 2-manifold @xmath0 with boundary illustrated in the figure ( with corners smoothed so that it has smooth boundary )  in the figure , the top and bottom dashed lines , and the leftmost and rightmost dashed lines , are identified .",
    "it is clear that @xmath0 satisfies the geodesic condition of the theorem , so the lower bound is valid for it .",
