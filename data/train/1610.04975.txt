    "the open charm production in collisions of high energy hadrons is an appropriate class of processes to test the perturbative quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) @xcite . a large mass of charm quark @xmath16 as a lower bound of hard energy scale @xmath17 leads to the small value of the strong coupling constant @xmath18 due to the condition @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the asymptotic scale parameter of qcd",
    ". production of charm quark with large transverse momentum ( @xmath21 ) is a typical multiscale hard process for which the fixed - order qcd calculations should be corrected by the fragmentation contribution to resum large logarithmic terms @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the strong coupling constant .",
    "nowadays , the theoretical study of inclusive @xmath0-meson hadroproduction were performed at the leading order ( lo ) for double production ( @xmath24 ) and the next - to - leading order ( nlo ) for single production in the collinear parton model ( cpm ) of qcd within the two approaches : the general - mass variable - flavor - number ( gm - vfn ) scheme  @xcite , and the so - called fixed order scheme improved with next - to - leading logarithms ( fonll scheme )  @xcite . in the first one ,",
    "realized in the refs .",
    "@xcite , the large transverse momenta collinear logarithms are resummed through the evolution of the fragmentation functions ( ffs ) , satisfying the dokshitzer - gribov - lipatov - altarelli - parisi ( dglap ) evolution equations  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0-meson ffs were extracted both at the lo and nlo in the fixed factorization scheme from the fit of @xmath15 data taken by the opal collaboration at cern lep1  @xcite .",
    "opposite , in the fonll approach , the nlo @xmath0-meson production cross sections are calculated with a non - perturbative @xmath14-quark ff , that is not a subject to dglap evolution .",
    "the fonll scheme was implemented in the refs .",
    "@xcite and its main ingredients are the following : the nlo fixed order calculation with resummation of large transverse momentum logarithms at the next - to - leading level for heavy quark production .",
    "the important difference of these two fragmentation approaches is in following : in the case of scale - depended gm - vfn scheme @xmath0-mesons are produced both from @xmath14-quarks and from gluons , in case of scale - independent fonll scheme @xmath0-mesons are produced only from @xmath14-quarks .    at the high - energy regge limit @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the invariant collision energy , one has new dynamic regime of particle production in the multi - regge kinematics ( mrk ) or in the quasi - multi - regge kinematics ( qmrk ) , when one particle or a group of particles are produced in the rapidity region , being strongly separated in rapidity from other particles .",
    "radiative corrections in this regime are dominated by the production of additional hard jets .",
    "the only one way in cpm to treat these processes is to calculate higher - order corrections , which is a challenging task for some processes even at the nlo level , such as for relevant to our study process of double charm production in the gluon fusion , @xmath27 .    alternatively , to solve this problem we should change a factorization scheme from the collinear approximation of the pm to the high - energy or @xmath28-factorization @xcite and take into account a large part of the higher - order corrections which are incorporated in the transverse - momentum - dependent parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) of off - shell initial partons .",
    "recently , the studies of single and double @xmath0-meson hadroproduction at the lhc were performed in the @xmath28-factorization approach with the scale - independent peterson @xmath14-quark ff in refs .",
    "@xcite and with the scale - dependent @xmath14-quark and gluon ffs from @xcite in refs .",
    "the latter are based on the parton reggeization approach ( pra ) , which is a combination of @xmath28-factorization framework with the fully gauge - invariant amplitudes with reggeized partons in the initial state .    in our previous study of the single @xmath0-meson production at the tevatron and the lhc  @xcite in the central rapidity region of produced mesons ( @xmath29 and @xmath30 , respectively ) in the pra we obtained quite a good agreement between theoretical calculations and the experimental data . in this work",
    "we continue the investigation and extend it into the region of large rapidity for single and double @xmath0-meson production .",
    "not so long ago the lhcb collaboration has provided the forward @xmath0-meson production data  @xcite .",
    "the differential cross sections on @xmath0-meson transverse momentum @xmath31 were measured for @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath32 , and @xmath4 mesons in proton - proton collisions at the cern lhc at a center - of - mass energy of @xmath7  tev and with rapidities in the range of @xmath33 . nowadays ,",
    "the recent data come from the lhc run ii and the newest measurements of @xmath0-meson production were presented by the lhcb collaboration at @xmath8  tev  @xcite .",
    "they are presented as @xmath9 distributions of @xmath0 mesons at the same rapidity region and in a wider @xmath9 range then in the lhc run i. the data are presented in three kinds : absolute double differential cross sections @xmath34 , ratios of @xmath0-meson production cross sections between different center - of - mass energies @xmath35 , and ratios of the cross sections for different mesons .    not only the single but also a pair production of @xmath0 mesons is under consideration .",
    "the first observations of double charm production were performed at the @xmath7 tev by the lhcb collaboration  @xcite .",
    "the published results include the cross sections differential in azimuthal angle difference , transverse momentum , rapidity difference and invariant mass of various combinations of @xmath0-meson pairs .",
    "the spectra were measured at the region of large rapidities @xmath36 at the collision energy @xmath7  tev .",
    "we continue our recent study of double @xmath0-meson production in pra  @xcite testing the new contributions from reggeized quark ",
    "reggeized antiquark annihilation processes and studying different combinations of @xmath0-mesons in the measured pair production spectra .",

    "[ sec : two ] we present the relevant reggeized amplitudes as they are obtained from the lipatov s effective high - energy action in qcd . in sec .",

    "[ sec : six ] we summarize our conclusions .",
    "[ sec : two ]    the reggeization of amplitudes at the high energy is a natural property of gauge - invariant quantum field theories , such as quantum electrodynamics  @xcite and qcd  @xcite . at large @xmath37",
    "the dominant contribution to cross sections of qcd processes give mrk or qmrk parton scattering processes with the gluon or quark @xmath38-channel exchange . due to the reggeization of quarks and gluons ,",
    "an important role is dedicated to the vertices of reggeon - particle interactions .",
    "nowadays , they can be straightforwardly derived from the non - abelian gauge - invariant effective action for the interactions of the reggeized partons with the usual qcd partons , which was firstly introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite for reggeized gluons only , and then extended by inclusion of reggeized quark fields in the ref .",
    "the full set of the induced and effective vertices together with feynman rules can be found in refs .",
    "@xcite .    in our recent paper  @xcite we have shown that gluon and @xmath14-quark fragmentation",
    "give the leading contribution to the @xmath0-meson production in the pra .",
    "the same result was also obtained in the ref .",
    "@xcite in nlo of the cpm , as well as the light quark fragmentation turns out to be negligible . according to this statement in case of the forward production of charmed mesons in the framework of the pra we will also consider the gluon and @xmath14-quark fragmentation . the lowest order in @xmath39 parton subprocesses of pra which give a contribution to a single @xmath0-meson production via gluon fragmentation",
    "are the following @xmath40 and @xmath41 the corresponding lowest order parton subprocesses which contribute to a single @xmath0-meson production via @xmath14-quark fragmentation are charm quark - antiquark pair production in the gluon - gluon fusion @xmath42 and in the quark - antiquark annihilation @xmath43 where @xmath44 are the reggeized gluons and @xmath45 denotes reggeized @xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 quarks .",
    "the double @xmath49-meson production at the lowest order of pra is described by the parton subprocesses ( [ eq : rrqq ] ) and ( [ eq : qqqq ] ) of @xmath50-pair production as well as by the parton subprocesses of @xmath51-pair production @xmath52 @xmath53    in the case of @xmath6-meson production we should consider contributions from six parton subprocesses . at first , these are ( [ eq : rrgg ] ) and ( [ eq : qqgg ] ) .",
    "there are also @xmath54 and @xmath55 subprocesses @xmath56 @xmath57 @xmath58 @xmath59 formally , the matrix elements of the @xmath60 , @xmath61 and @xmath55 subprocesses are of different order in the strong coupling constant @xmath39 , but their contributions can be of the same order because the fragmentation probabilities for gluon and @xmath14-quark fragmentation to a @xmath0-meson are related as @xmath62 . taking into account our previous study @xcite and the results of ref .",
    "@xcite , we conclude that gluon fragmentation dominates over the @xmath14-quark fragmentation in the @xmath6-pair production at the lhc energy , so we will consider the contributions of ( [ eq : rrgg ] ) and ( [ eq : qqgg ] ) subprocesses only .",
    "let us define four - vectors @xmath63 and @xmath64 , where @xmath65 are the four - momenta of the colliding protons , and @xmath66 are their energies .",
    "we have @xmath67 , @xmath68 , and @xmath69 .",
    "for any four - momentum @xmath70 , we define @xmath71 .",
    "it is easy to see that the four - momenta of the reggeized gluons can be represented as @xmath72 where @xmath73 .",
    "then the amplitude of gluon production in a fusion of two reggeized gluons can be presented as a convolution of the fadin - kuraev - lipatov effective prr vertex @xmath74 and polarization four - vector of final gluon @xmath75 : @xmath76 where @xmath77 , \\label{amp : rrg}\\ ] ] @xmath78 and @xmath79 are the color indices of the reggeized gluons with incoming four - momenta @xmath80 and @xmath81 , and @xmath82 with @xmath83 is the antisymmetric structure constant of color gauge group @xmath84 .",
    "similarly , we can write down the amplitudes for subprocess ( [ eq : qqg ] ) with massless spinors of reggeized quark @xmath45 and antiquark @xmath85 , @xmath86 and @xmath87 respectively : @xmath88 the fadin - sherman effective vertex  @xcite is given by @xmath89 .",
    "\\label{amp : qqg}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath90 are the generators of the color gauge group @xmath84 , @xmath91 and @xmath92 then the squared amplitudes have a simple form and read : @xmath93 where @xmath94 , @xmath95 .    the amplitudes for the subprocesses ( [ eq : rrqq ] ) , ( [ eq : qqqq ] ) , ( [ eq : rrgg ] ) , and ( [ eq : qqgg ] ) , can be written as a convolution of corresponding effective vertices with final gluon polarization four - vectors @xmath96 in case of gluon production or with spinors @xmath86 and @xmath87 in case of initial - state reggeized quark @xmath97 and antiquark  @xmath98 : @xmath99 where @xmath100 are the effective vertices of the transition of two reggeized partons into the gluon pair or charm quark - antiquark pair .",
    "the general form of the squared amplitudes is : @xmath101 where @xmath102 and @xmath103 are functions which depend on variables @xmath48 , @xmath38 , @xmath46 , @xmath104 , @xmath105 , @xmath106 , @xmath107 , @xmath108 .",
    "the corresponding effective vertices and matrix elements squared are too large to be presented here and can be found in an explicit form in ref .",
    "@xcite in the case of the massless final charm quarks(antiquarks ) .",
    "we perform our analysis in the region of @xmath109 , that allows us to use zm vfns scheme , where the masses of the charm quarks in the hard - scattering amplitude are neglected .    for all the squared amplitudes of @xmath60 subprocesses we checked that in the collinear limit , i.e. @xmath110 , the reggeized squared amplitudes transform to the squared amplitudes of the corresponding parton subprocesses in cpm .",
    "it is evident that the squared amplitudes for @xmath111 subprocesses are vanishing in the collinear limit .",
    "[ sec : three ]    in the conventional cpm the factorization theorem allows to present the cross sections of processes which take place in high - energy hadron - hadron collisions and have a one hard scale @xmath112 as a convolution of scale - dependent parton ( quark or gluon ) _ collinear _ distributions @xmath113 and squared amplitude of the hard parton scattering .",
    "these distributions represent the density of partons carrying the longitudinal momentum fraction @xmath114 of the proton , integrated over the parton transverse momentum @xmath28 up to @xmath115 .",
    "the evolution of this density from some scale @xmath116 , fixing a non - perturbative regime , to the typical scale @xmath117 is described by dglap  @xcite evolution equations where the large logarithms of type @xmath118 ( collinear logarithms ) are summed .",
    "the typical scale @xmath117 of the hard - scattering processes is usually of order of the transverse momentum of the produced particle , @xmath119 .",
    "the pra gives the description of qcd parton scattering amplitudes in the region of large @xmath108 and fixed momentum transfer @xmath38 , @xmath120 ( regge region ) , with various color states in the @xmath38-channel . in the regge region",
    "we should keep the transverse momenta of the initial partons and their virtualities .",
    "it becomes possible introducing the unintegrated over transverse momenta parton distribution functions ( unpdfs ) @xmath121 , which depend on parton transverse momentum @xmath122 while its virtuality is @xmath123 .",
    "the unpdfs are defined to be related with collinear ones through the equation : @xmath124 the factorization formula in the pra reads : @xmath125 where @xmath126 , @xmath127 , @xmath128 and @xmath129 are the factorization and renormalization scales respectively , @xmath130 is the unpdf of an @xmath131-parton in the initial state and @xmath132 is the cross section of the hard off - shell partonic subprocess .",
    "the cross section ( [ eq : kttheorem ] ) is normalized to be in accordance with the cpm at the collinear limit , when @xmath110 .",
    "according to the factorization formula ( [ eq : kttheorem ] ) the partonic cross section of the @xmath111 subprocess ( as an example we take ( [ eq : rrg ] ) ) is being a convolution of gluon production squared amplitude ( [ sqamp : rrg ] ) with unpdfs , and it can be simplified to the following formula : @xmath133 where @xmath134 is the azimuthal angle between @xmath135 and @xmath136 .",
    "the hadronic cross section of any @xmath137 subprocess , here we show the case of heavy - quark pair production through the process ( [ eq : rrqq ] ) , can be written as follows : @xmath138 where @xmath139 , @xmath140 , @xmath141 is the azimuthal angle between @xmath142 and @xmath143 , the rapidity of the final parton with four - momentum @xmath144 can be presented as @xmath145 .",
    "again , we have checked a fact that in the limit of @xmath146 , we reproduce the conventional factorization formula of the collinear parton model from ( [ eq : qmrkg ] ) and ( [ eq : qmrkqq ] ) .",
    "the important ingredient of the our calculation is unpdf , which we take as one proposed by kimber , martin and ryskin ( kmr ) @xcite .",
    "these distributions are obtained introducing a single - scale auxiliary function which satisfies the unified bfkl / dglap evolution equation , where the leading bfkl logarithms @xmath147 are fully resummed and even a major ( kinematical ) part of the subleading bfkl effects are taken into account .",
    "the dependence on the second scale , @xmath38 , is implemented at the last step of the evolution .",
    "this procedure to obtain unpdfs requires less computational efforts than the precise solution of two - scale evolution equations such as , for instance , ciafaloni - catani - fiorani - marchesini equation  @xcite , but we found it to be suitable and adequate to the physics of processes under study .",
    "the set of feynman diagrams corresponding to the contributions proportional to @xmath148 included into unpdfs appear if we consider the reggeization of given parton .",
    "that makes unpdfs fully compatible with reggeized amplitudes . in our previous study",
    "@xcite devoted to the similar processes of @xmath0-meson production we proved that they give the best description of @xmath149spectra measured at the central region of rapidity at the lhc .    to describe the hadronization stage we use the fragmentation model  @xcite .",
    "so , the transition from the produced gluon or @xmath14-quark to the @xmath0 meson is described by corresponding fragmentation function @xmath150 . according the factorization theorem in qcd , in the fragmentation model",
    "the basic formula for the single @xmath0-meson production cross section reads : @xmath151 where @xmath152 is the fragmentation function for the parton @xmath131 splitting into @xmath0-meson at the scale @xmath112 , @xmath153 is the longitudinal momentum fraction of a fragmenting particle carried by the @xmath0-meson . in the zero - mass approximation",
    "the fragmentation parameter @xmath153 can be defined as follows @xmath154 , @xmath155 and @xmath156 are the @xmath0-meson and @xmath131-parton four - momenta , and @xmath157 .    in the case of pair @xmath0-meson production",
    "an additional integral over the momentum fraction of second parton appears .",
    "the fragmentation formula now has the following form : @xmath158 where @xmath159 and @xmath160 are the fragmentation functions for the transitions of parton @xmath161 into @xmath0 meson with momentum fraction @xmath162 and of parton @xmath163 into @xmath164 meson with momentum fraction @xmath165 , respectively , at the scale @xmath112 . in our calculations",
    "we use the lo ffs from ref .",
    "@xcite , where the fits of non - perturbative @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and @xmath4 ff s to opal data from lep1  @xcite were performed .",
    "these ffs satisfy two desirable properties : at first , their scaling violations are ruled by dglap evolution equations ; at second , they are universal .    as the contribution of gluon fragmentation at @xmath166",
    "is initiated by the perturbative transition of gluons to @xmath167-pairs encountered by dglap evolution equations , the part of @xmath14-quarks produced in the subprocess ( [ eq : rrqq ] ) with their subsequent transition to @xmath0-mesons are already taken into account considering @xmath0-meson production via gluon fragmentation in the subprocess ( [ eq : rrg ] ) .",
    "such a way , to avoid double counting , we must subtract this contribution , that can be effectively done by the lower cut of the amplitude in formula ( [ eq : qmrkqq ] ) as @xmath168 , i.e. at the threshold of the production of @xmath50-pair .",
    "the forward rapidity region in @xmath169 collisions at the lhc became available due to the specially designed lhcb detector where the measurements of differential cross sections of @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath32 , and @xmath4 mesons with @xmath33 at the @xmath170  tev were performed  @xcite .",
    "the observed data divided into 5 rapidity regions are presented together with our results obtained in the lo of pra in the fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] .",
    "the sum of all contributions from subprocesses ( [ eq : rrg])-([eq : rrqq ] ) is shown as solid line .",
    "we estimated a theoretical uncertainty arising from uncertainty of definition of factorization and renormalization scales ( @xmath171 ) by varying them between @xmath172 and @xmath173 around their central value of @xmath9 , the transverse momentum of fragmenting parton .",
    "the resulting uncertainty is depicted in the figures by shaded bands .",
    "we find a good agreement between our predictions and experimental data in the whole @xmath9 interval of @xmath0-meson transverse momenta within experimental and theoretical uncertainties only with one exclusion for @xmath174-mesons , when our results overestimate data by a factor 2 .",
    "it may be connected with the bad quality of gluon or @xmath14-quark ff extracted from the @xmath15 data , see @xcite for details .    in the calculations of ref .",
