    "the recent progress on the four dimensional @xmath4 supersymmetric gauge theory reveals a remarkable relation to the two dimensional conformal field theory @xcite . this relation provides the explicit interpretation for the partition function of the four dimensional gauge theory @xcite as the conformal block of the two dimensional liouville field theory , and is naturally regarded as a consequence of the m - brane compactifications @xcite , which reproduces the results of the four dimensional gauge theory @xcite .",
    "it is originally considered in @xcite for @xmath5 theory , and extended to the higher rank gauge theory @xcite , the non - conformal theory @xcite and the cases with the surface and loop operators @xcite , etc .    according to this connection , established",
    "results on the two dimensional side can be reconsidered from the viewpoint of the four dimensional theory , and vice versa .",
    "one of the useful applications is the matrix model description of the supersymmetric gauge theory @xcite .",
    "this is based on the fact that the conformal block on the sphere can be also regarded as the matrix integral , which is called the dotsenko - fateev integral representation @xcite . in this direction",
    "some extensions of the matrix model description are performed by starting with the liouville correlators on the higher genus riemann surfaces @xcite .",
    "furthermore another type of the matrix model is also investigated so far @xcite @xcite .",
    "this matrix model is directly derived from the combinatorial representation of the partition function by considering its asymptotic behavior while the dotsenko - fateev type matrix model is obtained from the liouville correlator , so that the conformal symmetry is manifest .",
    "this treatment is quite analogous to the matrix integral representation of the combinatorial object .",
    "although they are apparently different from the dotsenko - fateev type , both types of the matrix model correctly reproduce the results of the four dimensional gauge theory , e.g. seiberg - witten curve .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to extend the remarkable connection between the two and four dimensional theory to the orbifold theory .",
    "the four dimensional orbifold manifold is given by @xmath6 where @xmath7 is a finite subgroup of @xmath5 , e.g. @xmath8 , and its minimal resolution of the singularity gives the ale space @xcite .",
    "the gauge theory on the ale space is well investigated in @xcite with respect to the instanton moduli space .",
    "their results show the moduli spaces of the instanton on the ale spaces are deeply connected to the affine lie algebras , and the quiver varieties .",
    "this interesting fact provides a guideline to search for a counterpart of the agt relation for the orbifold theory .",
    "furthermore this theory has been reconsidered in terms of d - branes @xcite in which some aspects of 2d/4d connection are partially studied , and the theory on the taub - nut space has been investigated in @xcite in detail .    to obtain the solutions of the four dimensional gauge theory on the ale space , we have to deal with the partition function as the case of @xmath3 by implementing the adhm construction and the localization method for the ale space . by performing such a procedure",
    ", the orbifold generalization of the combinatorial partition function , which would describe the gauge theory on the ale space , has been investigated @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "they are defined as the invariant sector of the young diagram under the orbifold action @xmath7 , and the process to extract only the @xmath7-invariant sector is called the orbifold projection in @xcite .",
    "this projection seems quite reasonable , but it is difficult to perform this in a systematic manner . in this paper",
    "we will show the orbifold projection is naturally performed when one appropriately parametrizes the partition function .",
    "this parametrization is just interpreted as the root of unity limit @xmath9 of the @xmath1-deformed partition function while we have to take @xmath2 for the usual @xmath3 theory .-",
    "parameter , we have to take care of its convergence radius .",
    "thus , to obtain the root of unity limit @xmath10 , we first parametrize it as @xmath11 , and take the limit of @xmath12 . ]",
    "the similar approach is found in @xcite in the context of the spin calogero - sutherland model , where the combinatorial method plays an important role in characterization of the wavefunction , derivation of the dynamical correlation functions and so on ( see , for example , @xcite ) .    in this paper",
    "we also propose a new matrix model description for the orbifold theory .",
    "starting with the combinatorial representation and applying the method developed in @xcite we derive a new kind of matrix models , and discuss the corresponding gauge theory consequences . as a result of orbifolding , we get @xmath13-matrix models for the ale space .",
    "this model is quite similar to the chern - simons matrix model @xcite for the lens space @xmath14 @xcite ( see also @xcite ) , which is recently applied to the abjm theory @xcite @xcite .",
    "this is so reasonable because the ale space goes to the lens space @xmath14 at infinity .",
    "we then discuss the large @xmath15 limit of the matrix model , and show seiberg - witten curve is arising from the spectral curve of the matrix model .",
    "along the recent interest in the 2d/4d relation , it is natural to search a two dimensional counterpart of the orbifold partition function . while the original relation relies on the interpretation of the @xmath16 partition function as the conformal block of the conformal field theory described by @xmath17 algebra , its generalization is also proposed @xcite @xcite @xcite : the generalized @xmath18 algebra corresponds to more complicated gauge theories in four dimensions . in such a theory",
    "an embedding @xmath19 plays an important role in characterizing the generalized @xmath18 algebra @xcite . on the other hand , in the orbifold theory , an embedding @xmath20",
    "is also found to characterize the decomposition into the irreducible representations of @xmath7 .",
    "we will discuss this similarity from the viewpoint of string theory and propose a new kind of connection between 2d/4d theories .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows . in section [ sec : n=2 ]",
    "we provide the combinatorial representation of the four dimensional gauge theory , which is originally proposed in @xcite , as preliminaries for some extensions discussed in this paper . in section [ sec : orbifold ] we then study the orbifold generalization of the partition function with focusing on its combinatorial aspect .",
    "we will see the root of unity limit of the @xmath1-deformed partition function implements the orbifold projection .",
    "section [ sec : matrix ] is devoted to derivation of the matrix model from the orbifold partition function by considering its asymptotic behavior . in section [ sec : spectral ] we study the multi - matrix model in detail by taking the large @xmath15 limit .",
    "we then extract seiberg - witten curve of the corresponding gauge theory via the spectral curve of the matrix model . in section",
    "[ sec : related ] we try to search a 2d/4d relation for the orbifold theory .",
    "the two dimensional theory is discussed from the viewpoint of string theory , and a relation to the generalized @xmath18 algebra is also proposed .",
    "we also discuss topics related to the @xmath1-deformation of the partition function .",
    "we finally summarize our results in section [ sec : summary ] .      after submitting this article , some related papers , considering extensions of the agt relation to the ale spaces , appear in the preprint server @xcite .",
    "let us start with the partition functions for @xmath4 theories , originally studied by @xcite , as preliminaries of discussions along this paper : its deformation is proposed in section [ sec : orbifold ] and we will also see in section [ sec : matrix ] the matrix model can be obtained from the combinatorial representation by considering its asymptotic behavior .",
    "first we introduce the instanton part of the four dimensional partition function for @xmath4 @xmath16 theory with @xmath21 ( anti)fundamental matters , @xmath22 these combinatorial expressions are written in terms of @xmath23-tuple partitions , @xmath24 , and their parameters are related to those of the gauge theory as @xmath25 where @xmath26 are @xmath27-background parameters , @xmath28 is the coulomb moduli parametrizing the @xmath29 vacua , and @xmath30 denotes the mass of the fundamental matter .",
    "we can also introduce bifundamental matter fields , but we do not focus on them in this paper . for @xmath31 theory , which includes the adjoint matter , we have to consider another contribution , @xmath32 with the mass of the adjoint matter @xmath33 note one can see a simple relation @xmath34 this @xmath31 theory is given by the simple deformation of @xmath35 theory by applying the mass to the adjoint matter .",
    "we will comment on the massless limit of this @xmath31 theory later .",
    "the five dimensional extensions of these partition functions are also proposed , which can be regarded as the @xmath1-deformed analogue of the original four dimensional one , @xmath36 @xmath37 here we define @xmath38 and deformed parameters are given by @xmath39 @xmath40 the radius @xmath41 of the compactified dimension @xmath42 is implicitly included in these parameters by rescaling the parameters , e.g. @xmath43 .",
    "thus one can check the four dimensional result is reproduced by the five dimensional partition function by taking the limit @xmath44 , or equivalently @xmath2 .    to obtain the matrix models , it is useful to consider another representation for these partition functions with cut - off parameters @xmath45 for the partitions @xcite . by decomposing the partition functions ( [ part_vec01 ] ) , ( [ part_adj01 ] ) as @xmath46",
    "each part can be rewritten as @xmath47 we can check finite constants turn out to be @xmath48 therefore they can be represented as @xmath49 @xmath50 these expressions are convenient to give the matrix model description @xcite .",
    "we will investigate deformed versions of the partition functions , starting from these expressions , and derive the corresponding matrix models in section [ sec : matrix ] .",
    "we then consider the orbifold generalization of the partition function for @xmath4 theory @xcite , which describes the gauge theory on the ale spaces @xcite , obtained from the minimal resolution of orbifolds @xmath6 where @xmath7 is a finite subgroup of @xmath5 .",
    "this resolution of the singularity is performed by replacing two - spheres , where their intersecting numbers are related to a cartan matrix of the corresponding lie algebras @xmath51 .",
    "this connection between subgroups @xmath7 of @xmath5 and lie algebras @xmath51 is known as the mckay correspondence .",
    "especially the abelian groups @xmath8 correspond to @xmath52 lie algebras , and we focus on them in this paper .    to study such an extended partition function , we will show it is useful to deal with the @xmath1-deformed partition function which corresponds to the five dimensional theory , and take the root of unity limit of the deformation parameter .",
    "we remark the procedure used in this paper to obtain the orbifold partition function is closely related to the method proposed in @xcite to study the spin calogero - sutherland model ( e.g. see @xcite ) , where combinatorial arguments are quite important as well as the four or five dimensional gauge theory .      to construct the orbifold partition function ,",
    "let us first clarify the orbifold action for the combinatorial partition function .",
    "recalling the partition function is obtained from the chern character of the fixed point in the moduli space under the torus action , or the equivariant @xmath53-theory class , it is reasonable to observe an effect of the orbifolding on the torus action .",
    "their expressions are closely related to the five dimensional partition function , so that we first study the five dimensional function rather than the four dimensional version to discuss the meaning of the orbifold action .    by considering adhm construction and the localization method for the ale space @xcite as in the case of the usual @xmath3 space",
    ", it is shown the orbifold partition function should be defined as a sector of the @xmath1-deformed function ( with @xmath2 ) , which is invariant under the following orbifold action @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the primitive @xmath56 root of unity .",
    "@xmath57 is an integer @xmath58 , and @xmath59 .",
    "it denotes the @xmath60 chern class of the instanton bundle @xcite , and also is interpreted as the linking number of the five branes @xcite .",
    "actually the boundary of the ale space is a lens space @xmath61 , and thus we can assign non - trivial flat connection at infinity in this case . therefore the instanton solution is classified by both the @xmath60 and @xmath62 chern classes .",
    "we remark the instanton number defined as @xmath63 coincides with the @xmath62 chern class only if the @xmath60 chern class is vanishing .",
    "this constraint is quite non - trivial , but it does not concern our derivation of the matrix model discussed later .",
    "it is easy to see this action in terms of a young diagram .",
    "since the five dimensional partition function is written in the following form @xmath64 where @xmath65 stands for the transposed partition , we can see the @xmath7-invariant sector satisfies @xmath66 for @xmath67 case the left hand side coincides with the hook length of the box , @xmath68 .",
    "thus the corresponding four dimensional function can be given by taking into account this condition , @xmath69 the product in this expression is explicitly taken over the @xmath7-invariant sector ( [ gamma - inv ] ) .",
    "[ part_fig01 ] shows @xmath7-invariant sector for @xmath67 theory with @xmath70 .",
    "-invariant sector for @xmath67 theory with @xmath71 .",
    "numbers in boxes stand for their hook lengths @xmath72 .",
    "shaded boxes are invariant under the action of @xmath70 . ]",
    "although this definition seems natural for the orbifold version of the partition function , it is not useful anyway because we have to extract the @xmath7-invariant sector by hands .",
    "this procedure is called the orbifold projection in @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "when we consider another deformation of the partition function , which is given by replacing the parameters with ( [ orb01 ] ) as @xmath73 and take the limit of @xmath2 , namely the root of unity limit @xmath10 of the original @xmath1-partition function , we can see only the @xmath7-invariant sector contributes to the partition function and the others are decoupled in this limit .",
    "it is because , unless the power of @xmath74 becomes @xmath75 in ( [ part_orb02 ] ) , they just give a factor independent of the shape of the young diagram , or the partition .",
    "thus , if we take into account the adjoint matter contribution to regularize the singular behavior at @xmath2 , the weight function behaves as @xmath76 this means the orbifold projection is automatically assigned by this parametrization .",
    "therefore let us define the partition function modified with ( [ orb01 ] ) as the ( @xmath1-deformed ) orbifold partition function from now .",
    "we note that the pure yang - mills contribution can be extracted by taking the decoupling limit @xmath77 .",
    "we now check this reduction with a simple example , @xmath5 gauge theory on @xmath78 with the adjoint matter .",
    "if we set @xmath79 , @xmath80 and @xmath81 , lower degree parts of the instanton partition function are obtained by replacing @xmath1-parameters as @xmath82 , @xmath83 @xcite , @xmath84 thus , taking the limit @xmath12 , we have @xmath85 these correctly reproduce the result derived in @xcite .",
    "let us consider the meaning of this parametrization without taking the four dimensional limit @xmath86 .",
    "a candidate of the corresponding manifold is the taub - nut manifold because it can be obtained by compactifying the singularity on @xmath42 , and reproduces the ale space by taking a certain limit .",
    "it is just a speculation , thus we have to come back to this identification problem in a future work .",
    "we then comment on ambiguity of this parametrization . in this paper",
    "we apply the primitive root of unity to define the partition function as ( [ part_orb02 ] ) , but other roots of unity , represented as @xmath87 , are also valid for the orbifold projection while @xmath13 and @xmath88 are co - prime .",
    "this arbitrariness reflects @xmath89 symmetry of the system .",
    "corresponding to @xmath4 theories on @xmath90 and @xmath91 with the limit of @xmath92 .",
    "@xmath93 is related to the radius of the compactified dimension @xmath42 . ]",
    "[ fig : q ] shows how to parametrize @xmath1 to obtain the partition functions for the ale spaces .",
    "@xmath93 corresponds to the radius of the compactified dimension @xmath42 .",
    "when we consider the four dimensional limit , we have to approach @xmath94 with taking care of the radius of convergence since the partition function includes infinite products of @xmath1 . in @xcite a similar parametrization is actually proposed , which is interpreted as an analytic continuated one , but they do not take into account regularizing the infinite product appearing in the partition function . thus the parametrization used in this paper should be more suitable .",
    "as discussed before the partition function for @xmath16 theory on @xmath3 is represented with @xmath23-tuple partition . for this case",
    ", we can reproduce the one - matrix model by blending @xmath23-tuple partition to a single one @xcite .",
    "next we consider its natural generalization to the orbifold theory . in this case , on the other hand , it is convenient for the discussion below to divide a @xmath23-tuple partition into a @xmath95-tuple one @xcite , @xmath96 where @xmath97 this corresponds to the decomposition into irreducible representations of @xmath7 .",

    "thus we can rewrite the resolvent , the prepotential and the saddle point equation in a simple form as @xmath209 @xmath210 @xmath211 from multi - cut discontinuities of the resolvents we obtain the density of eigenvalues @xmath212 which has supports on the intervals @xmath190 .",

    "since the resolvent is periodic in the imaginary direction , @xmath221 , there seems to be the discrete @xmath89 shift symmetry @xmath222 . this is quite similar to the discrete @xmath223 symmetry of @xmath16 five dimensional theory , proposed in @xcite .",
    "this similarity suggests the level - rank duality of this model .    .",

    "thus the partial t hooft coupling is simply given by its contour integral , @xmath226 in addition , from ( [ legendre_part ] ) we have another contour integral @xmath227 where the contour @xmath224 is the relative cycle represented by the path starting at @xmath228 , and going back to @xmath229 on another sheet after reaching @xmath230 as shown in fig",

    ". therefore analysis of this matrix model is equivalent to that of @xcite .",
    "but in this section we reconsider the result of the gauge theory from the viewpoint of the matrix model ( similar approach is found in @xcite ) .",
    "let us first consider the most simple case , the four dimensional theory with @xmath166 , as a preliminary for other generalized theories .",
    "this is the case investigated in @xcite in detail .",
    "we now concentrate on the relation between seiberg - witten curve and the spectral curve of the matrix model .",
    "one can see notations for the four dimensional matrix model in appendix [ sec : matrix4d ] .    to clarify the connection between the matrix model description and the gauge theory consequences explicitly",
    ", we have to consider the contribution of the dynamical scale , which is actually interpreted as the instanton counting parameter . in this case",
    "the counting parameter should be replaced with @xmath238 because the instanton number becomes fractional @xcite . in this section",
    "we introduce this contribution to the potential functions for both the vector multiplet and the ( anti)fundamental matter .    due to the saddle point equation ( [ eom4d ] ) , we have a regular function on the complex plane , except at the infinity , @xmath239 this turns out to be a monic polynomial @xmath240 , because it is an analytic function with the following asymptotic behavior , @xmath241 here @xmath242 should be the smaller root with the boundary condition as @xmath243 thus we now identify @xmath244 therefore from the hyperelliptic curve ( [ elliptic01 ] ) we can relate seiberg - witten curve to the spectral curve of the matrix model , @xmath245 note that it is shown in @xcite we have to take the vanishing fraction limit to obtain the coulomb moduli from the matrix model contour integral .",
    "this is the essential difference between the profile function method and the matrix model description .",
    "we can deal with the theory with ( anti)fundamental matters in a similar way . in this case",
    "the spectral curve of the matrix model reads @xmath246 thus the regular part is modified as @xmath247 where we now take into account the contribution from the matter fields , @xmath248 as well as the pure gauge theory , we identify @xmath249 and @xmath250 is a monic polynomial because of its analyticity and asymptotics .",
    "for @xmath251 although we have to consider the multi - matrix model , we can perform almost the same approach . in this case",
    "we now apply the same resolvent @xmath74 and the corresponding function @xmath252 to all the matrices . due to the slightly modified potential term",
    ", we have a regular function @xmath253 again @xmath250 is a monic polynomial @xmath254 , due to the asymptotic behavior , @xmath255 identifying the smaller root as @xmath256 we have a slightly modified relation for the spectral curve @xmath257 we can apply the same spectral curve to each matrix because they are independent of the index @xmath88 of the matrix . therefore seiberg - witten curve for each matrix is given by multiplying the original one by @xmath258 , @xmath259 it means seiberg - witten curve for the ale space is decomposed to @xmath13 curves , and when we consider the total contribution from @xmath13 matrices , we can reproduce the original relation for the prepotential and the coulomb moduli .",
    "we can easily see the relation ( [ swcurve4d ] ) is also obtained from the theory with the matter fields .",
    "this simple relation between @xmath166 and @xmath251 theories is also suggested by the result in @xcite .",
    "it is shown that the central charge of the two dimensional conformal field theory , corresponding to the theory we discuss here , is given by @xmath260 in the case of @xmath131 , namely @xmath261 , since the second part is vanishing , it is natural to expect there are @xmath13 sectors without interacion between them .",
    "this is consistent with our result discussed above .",
    "we generalize the result for @xmath166 , which is derived in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) , to the cases @xmath251 .",
    "we now apply a similar method discussed above to the five dimensional case . as well as the four dimensional theory , we can have a regular function @xmath262 where we modify the definition @xmath263 . in this case",
    "it yields a @xmath264 monic polynomial @xmath265 , because of its asymptotics @xmath266 by setting the boundary condition @xmath267 seiberg - witten differential for this theory defined on the curve ( [ swcurve5d ] ) reads @xmath268 we can see the result of @xcite is obtained by setting @xmath166 . in this case",
    "although the curve is modified as ( [ swcurve5d ] ) , the form of the differential itself is not changed . in the four dimensional limit @xmath44 , @xmath13 sets of @xmath23 cuts are decoupled because distance between them is @xmath269 as shown in fig .",
    "a generalization to the theory with matter fields is straightforward .",
    "the recent remarkable progress on the four dimensional @xmath4 theory gives the interesting relation to the two dimensional conformal field theory .",
    "thus , according to the results discussed above , it is natural to search a two dimensional theoretical counterpart of the orbifold theory . in this section",
    "we discuss some proposals for such an interesting 2d/4d connection .",
    "we now discuss a string theory realization of the orbifold theory , and try to find its two dimensional description .",
    "it is well known that string theory gives us a lot of interesting field theoretical consequences , e.g. the holographic approach to a strongly correlated system , the method to construct instantons and monopoles and so on .",
    "actually the 2d/4d relation @xcite can be naturally understood in terms of m - theory .",
    "let us consider the string theory realization of @xmath35 sym theory on the taub - nut space @xcite , which is expected to be related to our case .",
    "the taub - nut manifold @xmath270 is given by a @xmath42 compactification of the @xmath52 singularity .",
    "it approaches to the cylinder @xmath271 at infinity , and the ale space is obtained by taking the limit of @xmath272 where @xmath41 stands for the radius of @xmath42 .",
    "we remark although the partition function of the gauge theory on the taub - nut manifold is not identical to that of the ale space , we expect this difference does not seriously affect the corresponding two dimensional theory because the @xmath16 theory on both of these manifolds is specified by a flat connection on the boundary @xmath14 as discussed later .",
    "we start with type iia string theory on @xmath273 with wrapping @xmath23 d4-branes on @xmath274 . lifting this to m - theory ,",
    "we then obtain the compactification of @xmath275 and wrapping @xmath23 m5-branes on @xmath276 . by replacing the two - manifold @xmath277 with various riemann surfaces",
    "@xmath278 , we obtain the corresponding @xmath4 theories @xcite . to study this configuration we go back to type iia theory with another compactification @xmath279 .",
    "in this case there are @xmath23 d4-branes and @xmath13 d6-branes wrapping @xmath280 and @xmath281 respectively because the circle fibration of the taub - nut space has singular points .",
    "one can see these d4- and d6-branes are intersecting on @xmath277 , and thus the chiral fermion is arising from these intersecting configuration .",
    "this chiral fermion plays an important role in considering the level - rank duality of the system .    to discuss the two dimensional theory on @xmath277 we then deal with the boundary of the four dimensional manifold . by considering the radial quantization near the boundary and a wavefunction for the time evolution along @xmath282",
    ", we have a hilbert space with a state @xmath283 for each @xmath23-dimensional representation @xmath284 integrating out the flux coming from @xmath13 d6-branes , we obtain the chern - simons term for @xmath285 this means the boundary condition for the d4-brane requires specifying a state of the @xmath16 chern - simons theory at level @xmath13 living on @xmath277 , and thus we have a state for each integrable representation of the @xmath286 wzw model . note that the same procedure can be performed for the @xmath287 theory on @xmath13 d6-branes , and the diagonal @xmath288 part is decoupled .",
    "therefore we obtain the embedding @xmath289 , thus it is easy to see the level - rank duality .",
    "we also remark it is conjectured in @xcite that the gauge theory partition function is related to the @xmath290-function by utilizing the chiral fermion representation .",
    "consequently the generating function for instantons on the ale space of the ade type would be related to the ade wzw theories on the seiberg - witten curve .",
    "it is consistent with the intersecting brane configuration because we obtain the @xmath4 theories when we consider the intersecting branes on general curves @xmath278 , which turn out to be seiberg - witten / gaiotto curves @xcite .",
    "we then discuss the connection between the two and four dimensional theory more concretely .",
    "the original proposals of @xcite elucidate the explicit relation between the @xmath16 partition function and the two dimensional conformal field theory described by @xmath291 algebra .",
    "this relation is extended to the theory with the generalized @xmath18 algebra @xcite @xcite @xcite , which is obtained from the quantum drinfeld - sokolov reduction applied to an affine lie algebra @xmath292 @xcite .",
    "it is characterized by a choice of an embedding @xmath293 , and this embedding @xmath294 can be labeled by a partition of @xmath23 , or equivalently a young diagram @xmath295 . for example , it reproduces well - known algebras , @xmath296)=\\widehat{\\mathrm{su}}(n)$ ] , @xmath297)=w_n$ ] , etc .",
    "such an embedding has been discussed in the orbifold case ( [ embedding01 ] ) .",
    "indeed we consider the embedding of the finite subgroup @xmath89 of @xmath5 for the orbifold theory , and the decomposition into the irreducible representations of @xmath89 corresponds to that of the gauge group @xmath298 with @xmath299 .",
    "this shows that this embedding is also labeled by a partition of @xmath23 .",
    "therefore it is expected that the two dimensional conformal field theory , corresponding to the @xmath16 gauge theory on the ale space @xmath300 , is related to the generalized @xmath18 algebra @xmath301)$ ] .",
    "this connection is still speculation , and should be investigated in detail .",
    "it is shown in @xcite that @xmath1-deformed cft , which is described by @xmath1-virasoro @xcite and @xmath1-@xmath18 algebra @xcite , corresponds to the @xmath1-deformed five dimensional partition function of the gauge theory , and its matrix model description is also proposed in @xcite by clarifying a connection with @xmath1-virasoro algebra .",
    "this matrix model , which we now call @xmath1-virasoro matrix model , is apparently different from the trigonometric one @xcite , but it is worth considering the root of unity limit of such a @xmath1-virasoro related models .",
    "the root of unity limit of @xmath1-virasoro algebra is investigated in @xcite while that of @xmath1-@xmath18 algebra is not yet well known .    in this subsection",
    "let us focus on the matrix measure part of the @xmath1-virasoro matrix model @xcite .",
    "it is just given by the two - parameter deformed vandermonde determinant , which is closely related to the macdonald polynomial @xcite , @xmath302 we can obtain the usual vandermonde determinant by taking the limit @xmath303 with @xmath304 , @xmath305 this corresponds to the limit to get the jack polynomial from the macdonald polynomial @xcite . on the other hand , performing the uglov condition , @xmath11 , @xmath306 with @xmath307 @xmath308 , then taking @xmath2 , it becomes @xmath309 the matrix measure ( [ vander02 ] ) is expected to be related to the corresponding one ( [ vander4d ] ) .",
    "indeed they are equivalent for @xmath166 .",
    "although this is written in terms of only one matrix while the model discussed in the previous section is not , we can see the vandermonde part in ( [ vander02 ] ) is also found in ( [ vander4d ] ) . we just expect the interaction part in ( [ vander4d ] ) is encoded into the non - singular part of ( [ vander02 ] ) .",
    "such a difference seems to be related to that found in the usual matrix model for the four dimensional theory , the penner - type @xcite , interpreted as the integral representation of the liouville correlator and the other one just given by the asymptotics of the combinatorial expression of the partition function @xcite .",
    "indeed they are different because the conformal symmetry is manifest for the former one , but the latter one .",
    "however it is not enough yet to understand the difference between the macdonald - type and trigonometric - type deformed vandermonde determinant .",
    "this difference is expected to be understood , for example , in terms of string theory .",
    "we now remark the polynomial , called the _ uglov polynomial _ in @xcite , is given by taking this limit from the macdonald polynomial in order to describe the spin calogero - sutherland model @xcite .",
    "in this paper we have performed some extensions of the partition function and its matrix model description for the four dimensional @xmath4 gauge theory to the orbifold theory .",
    "we have shown that the orbifold projection , extracting the @xmath7-invariant sector of the young diagram , is automatically performed by taking the root of unity limit @xmath310 of the @xmath1-deformed partition function while we have to take @xmath2 to get the four dimensional theory on @xmath3 .",
    "for such an orbifold partition function of @xmath16 theory with @xmath8 , it is convenient to divide @xmath23-tuple to @xmath95-tuple partitions . as a result , we have obtained the multi - matrix model by considering the asymptotic behavior of the combinatorial representation .",
    "this matrix model at the large @xmath15 limit has been analysed in detail , which is equivalent to studying the limit shape of the young diagram , and then we have seen seiberg - witten curve is obtained as the spectral curve of the matrix model .",
    "we have also discussed the corresponding two dimensional theory of the four dimensional orbifold theory .",
    "focusing on the embedding @xmath311 , which characterizes the decomposition of @xmath16 gauge group to the irreducible representations of @xmath89 , we have suggested the generalized @xmath18 algebra appears in the two dimensional theory .",
    "we now comment on some possibilities of extension beyond this study .",
    "we hope our study becomes a step for understanding of m - theory itself .",
    "actually the emergence of @xmath286 symmetry in the two dimensional theory as a counterpart of the orbifold theory @xmath300 is analogous to the abjm theory because the level of chern - simons theory in the abjm theory is directly related to the background manifold @xmath312 on which m2-branes are located . indeed , in both cases , the level @xmath13 is interpreted as the degree of singularity of the complementary manifold of the corresponding world - volume theory .",
    "it is interesting to study a relation between m2- and m5-branes from this point of view .",
    "we are also interested in the level - rank duality of our model .",
    "such a duality can be found in the two dimensional @xmath286 , or @xmath313 wzw theory , which is closely related to the four dimensional orbifold theory .",
    "it is expected that this duality plays an important role in understanding some aspects of m - theory .",
    "it is natural to consider some applications to related topics .",
    "one of them is the three dimensional duality , which is a recent hot topic on this subject @xcite .",
    "the @xmath1-parameter plays a similar role in such a theory , so that it is interesting to study the singular limit of the @xmath1-parameter , i.e. the root of unity limit .",
    "second is a relation to the quantized integrable models .",
    "it is shown in @xcite that when we consider generic @xmath27-parameters , @xmath314 , correction to the prepotential can be interpreted as a quantization effect of the corresponding integrable model .",
    "searching an integrable model , which corresponds to the orbifold theory , would be also interesting .",

    "in this appendix we summarize the results of the four dimensional limit of the matrix model in order to fix our notations .",
    "let us mainly consider the @xmath166 theory , and shortly comment on simple generalizations to the cases of @xmath251 .",
    "the partition function for this case is given by @xmath315 and the saddle point equation is obtained from its differentiation with respect to each eigenvalue , @xmath316 this is also given by the extremal condition of the effective potential defined as @xmath317    we then introduce the resolvent for this model . by taking the large @xmath15 limit , it can be given by the integral representation , @xmath318 its asymptotic behavior yields @xmath319 here the density of states is obtained from the discontinuities of the resolvent , @xmath320 thus the saddle point equation can be also written in the following form , which is convenient to discuss its analytic property , @xmath321    on the other hand , we have another convenient form to treat the saddle point equation , which is called the loop equation , given by @xmath322 where we denote @xmath323 it is obtained from the saddle point equation by multiplying @xmath324 and taking their summation and the large @xmath15 limit .",

    "the filling fraction , or the partial t hooft coupling , is simply given by the contour integral on the hyperelliptic curve @xmath326    for @xmath251 we can perform the same thing as well as the case of @xmath166 since there is no interaction between @xmath13 matrices in the four dimensional limit with @xmath131 .",
    "the @xmath13-matrix partition function is given by @xmath327 @xmath328 we can provide all the matrices with the same density of states , resolvents and hyperelliptic curves etc , e.g. @xmath329 , and the total contribution to the partition function is given by the simple summation of them .",
