    "recently the properties of graphene attracted special attention ( see , for instance @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the matter of fact the wide variety of carbon materials such as graphite , graphene tubules , and fullerenes consists of graphene ( i.e. , a single layer of graphite ) sheets shaped in different manner .",
    "two - dimensional graphene has a very simple band structure , which can be obtained with help of the symmetry consideration or in tight - binding approximation @xcite .",
    "it was shown in refs .",
    "@xcite that the energy bands of graphene are degenerated at the corners of the 2d brillouin zone @xmath7 , where @xmath8=1.44 @xmath9 is the interatomic distance ( see fig .",
    "1 ) . this is the dirac - type spectrum but it is massless and two - dimensional .",
    "it was demonstrated that due to the symmetry arguments such gapless spectrum with the conic point in the 3d case turns out stable with respect to the coulomb interaction @xcite .",
    "one can proof that this stability remains also for the 2d graphene spectrum with the conic point .",
    "such simple band structure can be used in analytic calculations of various thermodynamic and transport properties of graphene .",
    "an example of such calculations was presented in ref .",
    "@xcite where the imaginary part of the dielectric function im@xmath10 of graphite has been calculated .",
    "the gapless band structure of graphene also results in the unusual behavior of conductivity . despite the enormous number of paper devoted to carbon materials ,",
    "the analytical expression of graphene conductivity was not yet derived to our best knowledge .",
    "the standard diagrammatic approach to calculation of transport properties of impure metals is restricted by the fundamental requirement that the mean free path of carriers @xmath11 must be much larger than the electron wavelength @xmath12 , i.e. @xmath13 .",
    "this condition can not be evidently satisfied in the case of graphene when the fermi surface degenerates to the points .",
    "we avoid this difficulty addressing the problem when the graphene sample is clean enough but temperature is finite ( @xmath14 ) . in this case",
    "the temperature appears instead of fermi energy and electrons obey boltzmann statistics .    in the present paper , we calculate analytically the frequency and wave - vector dependence of the graphene conductivity @xmath15 at finite temperature @xmath16 for the relatively low frequencies",
    "@xmath17 ev , when only the nearest @xmath18 bands can be taken into consideration .",
    "let us remind briefly the properties of the graphene electron spectrum .",
    "the tight - binding approximation allows to write down the following effective hamiltonian @xmath19 matrix @xmath20where @xmath21 and @xmath22 is the @xmath23 transfer integral , which is of the order of @xmath24 ev .",
    "the dispersion law of graphene , @xmath25 can be obtained by means of its diagonalization : @xmath26 in the vicinity of the @xmath27 point , the matrix elements of the effective hamiltonian can be expanded as @xmath28where @xmath29 .",
    "this results in the linear dispersion relation @xmath30 calculating the conductivity , we can use this expansion for @xmath31 @xmath24 ev .",
    "let us pass to the calculation of the electric current , following the paper by abrikosov @xcite , where the dielectric function of bi - type metals was considered .",
    "we assume that the external field is described by the vector potential @xmath32 the current operator has the form @xmath33where @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 are the velocity and mass operators correspondingly , the tilde in the notation @xmath37 means that the operator is taken in the interaction representation with @xmath38    we will calculate the current in the linear approximation in @xmath39 .",

    "the fourier component ( with respect to the spatial coordinates and imaginary time ) of this correlator@xmath40is expressed in terms of the temperature green s functions:@xmath41 ^{-1}\\]]in eq .",
    "( [ cor ] ) the notations @xmath42are used , the summation is carried out over the fermionic frequencies @xmath43 while the trace operation is performed over the band index of the hamiltonian @xmath44 .",

    "( [ sum ] ) into the upper half plane of the complex frequency can be performed by simple substitution @xmath51 with @xmath52 .",
