    "the computer simulation of full qcd in the regime of light quark masses , _ i.e. _ below the vector meson decay threshold , @xmath1 , represents one of the most interesting and yet long standing goals of lattice qcd . as the algorithms and computer resources of today are still inadequate for directly simulating realistic quark masses without running into severe",
    "_ finite size effects _ ( fse )",
    ", gral will make a virtue of necessity by performing simulations on _ sequences _ of small and medium sized lattices ; using _ finite size scaling _ techniques we will attempt to extrapolate the results to the infinite volume prior to the chiral and continuum extrapolations . in order to make contact with sesam and t@xmath2l data we use standard wilson fermions .",
    "seeking to simulate qcd with light quarks our first task is to determine an _ operating point _",
    "( @xmath3 , @xmath4 ) in parameter space with @xmath5 . in order to render simulations at this point feasible",
    "we specify @xmath6 as the maximal spatial extent of a series of lattices employed . with the number of lattice points in temporal direction held fixed at @xmath7 , the computational cost for @xmath6 thus sets an upper bound for the costs of subsequent simulations on smaller lattices .    to be specific , we require the simulation with @xmath8 at @xmath9 to yield meson masses with @xmath10 and a fse of @xmath11 .",
    "this particular value for the finite size parameter has been chosen in view of a recent sesam / t@xmath2l quark mass analysis  @xcite , where @xmath12 was found to mark the onset of significant fse s in the spectrum .    in summary ,",
    "the envisaged properties of our target point on a @xmath13-lattice are as follows : @xmath14{\\multicolumn{1}{c}{\\rule[-2mm]{0mm}{6 mm } # 1 } }   \\renewcommand{\\tabcolsep}{1pc }   \\renewcommand{\\arraystretch}{1.2 }   \\begin{array}{ccccccc } \\hline    \\cc{\\frac{{m_{\\rm ps}}}{{m_{\\rm v } } } } & \\cc{z } & \\cc{{\\xi_{\\rm ps } } } & \\cc{a{m_{\\rm ps } } } & \\cc{a{m_{\\rm v } } } &     \\cc{a [ { \\rm fm } ] } & \\cc{l\\ [ { \\rm fm } ] } \\\\     \\hline     0.4 & 0.2 & 3.2 & 0.31 & 0.78 & 0.116 & 1.86 \\\\     \\hline   \\end{array}\\ ] ] the lattice spacing @xmath15 has been estimated on the basis of the sesam and t@xmath2l data at @xmath16 and @xmath17 . obviously , the price for sticking to @xmath6 is a fairly coarse lattice .",
    "however , according to the scaling formulae in  @xcite , we expect a total cost of approximately @xmath18 to produce 100 statistically independent gauge field configurations at @xmath19 , which is feasible .",
    "on the search for the bare run parameters @xmath19 we let ourselves be guided by a heuristic consideration . from the known lattice spacings @xmath20 at @xmath21 and @xmath22 at @xmath23 , we deduce an estimate for @xmath24 from the renormalization group @xmath25-function .",
    "assuming that we are in the scaling regime we get @xmath26 , which leads us to expect that the presumed lattice spacing of @xmath27 at the target point will be attained at @xmath28 .",
    "with this in mind we turn to the sesam / t@xmath2l spectral data .",
    "the solid lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : extrap_5.6 ] represent linear fits to the @xmath29 and @xmath30 data at @xmath31 with @xmath6 .",
    "the dashed lines result from separate fits to the t@xmath2l  data with @xmath32 .",
    "we use these fits ( and corresponding ones for @xmath21 ) to establish functional dependencies of @xmath33 and @xmath34 on @xmath35 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : mpimrho_z ] .",
    "we are now in the position to guesstimate the operating point by direct extrapolation in the @xmath25-@xmath36 plane . setting out from the functions of fig .",
    "[ fig : mpimrho_z ] we use a linear and a quadratic ansatz to construct curves of constant @xmath33 and @xmath34 in that plane , displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : beta_kappa ] .",
    "the intersection of the straight lines for @xmath37 ( solid ) and @xmath38 ( dashed ) in the @xmath25-@xmath36 plane delivers with @xmath39 a first estimate for the operating point .",
    "although @xmath3 comes out close to the estimate from the @xmath25-function , this result is not to be taken too seriously , as preliminary results of a simulation performed with these action parameters give @xmath40 and @xmath41 , which is off the expectation by a factor of two in both cases . in order to illustrate qualitatively the behavior of @xmath42",
    ", the long - dashed curve shows a quadratic interpolation between @xmath9 ( having @xmath43 ) and the points with the same @xmath33 at @xmath21 and @xmath23 .",
    "( the dotted curve shows the same for @xmath44 . )    a two - dimensional quadratic fit of all available ( simulated and extrapolated ) @xmath42 and @xmath44 , respectively , to functions of the form @xmath45 leads to the coordinates @xmath46 . the dot - dashed curves in fig .  [ fig : beta_kappa ] show the resulting @xmath47 for @xmath48 and @xmath49 . as this second guess for @xmath9 deviates only little from the first one we are still running at @xmath50 , but with increased values of @xmath36 .",
    "production is carried out on apemille at desy zeuthen .",
    "for the smaller lattices ( @xmath51 ) we will use the cluster computer alice at the university of wuppertal . to carry out a chiral extrapolation , we will generate additional ensembles at equal @xmath25 , but larger @xmath33 .",
    "the step to a larger @xmath25 can be done either by going to @xmath52 at @xmath53 and @xmath54 , or by moving on to @xmath55 , depending on the results at the present simulation point .",
    "we are aware of the fact that our operating point may be located far in the strong coupling regime . on the other hand we might possibly take advantage of the increased `` @xmath25-shifts '' at light sea quark masses .",
    "eventually we want to reach values of @xmath56 .    for the extrapolation to the infinite volume limit",
    "we expect a formula of the form @xmath57 to be applicable  @xcite .",
