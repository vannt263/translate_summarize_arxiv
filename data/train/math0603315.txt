    "a permutation @xmath0 is said to be a subpermutation of a permutation @xmath1 , @xmath2 , if @xmath1 has a subsequence isomorphic to @xmath0 ( that is , its terms are ordered relatively the same as the terms of @xmath0 ) .",
    "for example @xmath3 is a subpermutation of @xmath4 because of the subsequence @xmath5 ( or @xmath6 or @xmath7 ) . on the other hand @xmath8 is not a subpermutation of @xmath4 because there is no three element subsequence of @xmath4 in which the three elements occur in decreasing order .",
    "consequently @xmath4 is said to _ involve _",
    "@xmath3 but to _ avoid _",
    "if @xmath9 is a set of permutations then @xmath10 denotes the set of all permutations which avoid every permutation in @xmath9 .",
    "such sets of permutations are called _ pattern classes _  and have given rise to many enumerative results .",
    "typically , given @xmath9 , one is interested in determining the number @xmath11 of permutations of each length @xmath12 in the pattern class @xmath10 . for obvious reasons we shall assume throughout",
    "that @xmath9 is non empty .",
    "when explicitly listing the elements of some set @xmath9 as an argument we will generally omit braces , thus writing @xmath13 rather than @xmath14 .",
    "the sequences @xmath11 can be studied from several points of view .",
    "we might wish to discover an exact formula for @xmath11 , to find bounds on its growth as a function of @xmath12 , or to determine the ordinary generating function @xmath15 recently marcus and tardos @xcite resolved affirmatively the long - standing open question of whether @xmath11 was always exponentially bounded . in part because of this result , attention has turned to enumerative questions of finer detail , and this paper addresses one such question .",
    "we shall be concerned with pattern classes of polynomial growth ; in other words , classes @xmath10 for which there exists a bound of the form @xmath16 for some constants @xmath17 .",
    "examples of classes of polynomial growth have appeared many times in the literature .",
    "for example , in an early paper @xcite , on pattern class enumeration , simion and schmidt proved that @xmath18 .",
    "some more difficult enumerations were carried out by west @xcite in his work on classes of the form @xmath19 where @xmath20 is a permutation of length three , and @xmath21 one of length four ; he showed that 4 of the 18 essentially different such classes have polynomial enumerations .",
    "more recently , kaiser and klazar @xcite proved that , in a polynomial growth class , @xmath11 , as a function of @xmath12 , was actually equal to some polynomial for all sufficiently large @xmath12 and that this polynomial had a particular form .",
    "kaiser and klazar also proved that classes @xmath10 whose growth was not polynomial have @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the golden ratio .",
    "huczynska and vatter @xcite gave a simplification of the results of @xcite , characterising polynomial growth classes in terms of `` grid classes '' of matchings , and establishing the dichotomy between classes of polynomial growth and those whose growth exceeds the growth of the fibonacci numbers .",
    "necessary and sufficient conditions on the basis @xmath9 for @xmath10 to have polynomial growth are implicit in @xcite , and were made explicit by huczynska and vatter .",
    "these conditions are so simple that it is virtually trivial to test whether @xmath10 has polynomial growth . by themselves",
    "the conditions tell us little about an actual polynomial that gives @xmath11 ( for sufficiently large @xmath12 ) and so , after exhibiting a somewhat different derivation of the conditions ( theorem [ n&s ] ) , we go on to give more precise results when @xmath24 ( section [ small ] ) .    if @xmath25 there is nothing to say beyond what is obvious ; @xmath26 has polynomial growth only if @xmath27 . in these cases : @xmath28    it is more complex to characterise the two and three element bases @xmath9 that lead to pattern classes of polynomial growth . in the three element case",
    "the classes @xmath10 of polynomial growth are sufficiently numerous that we have only used theorem [ n&s ] to list the various sets @xmath9 ( see theorem [ threerestrictions ] ) ; it would not be difficult in most cases to give the complete enumerations .",
    "however , in the two element case , we obtain a characterisation ( theorem [ tworestrictions ] ) of polynomial growth classes which are more demanding to analyse . in section [ enumeration ]",
    "we give some bounds on the degrees of the polynomials that arise in this case .    in order to simplify the exposition it will be useful to introduce a few further pieces of definition and notation .",
    "two sequences @xmath29 and @xmath30 of distinct elements from ( possibly different ) totally ordered sets are _ order isomorphic _  ( or simply _ equivalent _ ) if , for all @xmath31 , @xmath32 if and only if @xmath33 .",
    "thus , a permutation @xmath0 is involved in a permutation @xmath1 exactly when , considered as a sequence , it is equivalent to some subsequence of @xmath1 . further , every finite sequence of distinct elements from a totally ordered set is equivalent to exactly one permutation , called its _",
    "pattern_. if a pattern class @xmath34 is of polynomial growth , then we define @xmath35 to be the degree of the polynomial @xmath36 for which @xmath37 for all sufficiently large @xmath12 .",
    "this section aims to give an alternative proof to @xcite of the necessary and sufficient condition for which @xmath10 has polynomial growth .",
    "informally this condition is that among the permutations of @xmath9 we must find permutations of all the 10 types shown in figure [ 10types ] .",
    "clearly , testing this condition is very easy and can be done in linear time .",
    "we shall develop some terminology and notation to state this condition more formally , and to justify it .",
    "let @xmath38 be any sequence whose terms are @xmath39 or @xmath40 .",
    "then the pattern class @xmath41 consists of all permutations @xmath0 that have a segmentation @xmath42 where @xmath43 is increasing if @xmath44 and decreasing if @xmath45 ( empty segments are allowed ) . for example , the permutation @xmath46 because of the segmentation @xmath47 .",
    "these pattern classes are the ` @xmath48'-classes of @xcite where they were used to study partial well - order and regularity questions",
    ". we will be particularly interested in the four @xmath48-classes formed from sequences @xmath49 of length @xmath50 and their inverses , which form the first eight types in figure [ 10types ] .",
    "we will use a somewhat more compact notation for these classes : @xmath51 { } - } } = w(+1 , -1 ) \\quad { w_{- \\ ! \\makebox[1pt ] { } -}}^{-1 } = w(-1,-1)^{-1 } \\quad \\mbox{etc.}\\ ] ] the last two types in figure [ 10types ] are not related to @xmath48-classes and we call them @xmath52 and @xmath53 respectively since the first consists of permutations with increasing layers which are either singletons or decreasing doubletons , and the second is the reverse of this class .",
    "we can now state the conditions formally :    [ n&s]a pattern class @xmath54 has polynomial growth if and only if every class in the list @xmath55 { } + } } , \\ , { w_{+ \\ ! \\makebox[1pt ] { } - } } , \\ , { w_{- \\ ! \\makebox[1pt ] { } + } } , \\ , { w_{- \\ ! \\makebox[1pt ] { } - } }   \\\\ { w_{+ \\ ! \\makebox[1pt ] { } + } } ^{-1 } , \\ , { w_{+ \\ ! \\makebox[1pt ] { } -}}^{-1 } , \\ , { w_{- \\ ! \\makebox[1pt ] { } + } } ^{-1 } , \\ , { w_{- \\ ! \\makebox[1pt ] { } -}}^{-1 }   \\\\",
    "l_2 , \\ , l_2^r \\end{array}\\ ] ] has non - empty intersection with @xmath9 .",
    "note that in order to avoid each of the ten types , we may assume that @xmath10 has at most @xmath56 basis elements .",
    "our proof of theorem  [ n&s ] needs two auxiliary results .",
    "suppose that @xmath57 is a pattern class that is not a subset of any @xmath48-class .",
    "then there exists a one - to - one map @xmath58 with @xmath59 such that @xmath57 contains every subpermutation of @xmath60 .",
    "a permutation @xmath0 is called an _ up - down _  permutation if @xmath61 .",
    "the set of all up - down permutations can be considered as a tree , @xmath62 .",
    "the root of this tree is the single permutation of length @xmath63 and the @xmath64th level is the set of up - down permutations of length @xmath64 .",
    "the parent of a permutation on the @xmath64th level is the up - down permutation of length @xmath65 defined by removing its last symbol and replacing the remaining elements by their pattern .",
    "for example , the parent of @xmath66 is @xmath67 . in particular , note that @xmath62 is finitely branching , with each vertex at level @xmath64 having at most @xmath64 children .",
    "since @xmath57 is not contained in any @xmath48 class , it must contain a basis element of each @xmath48 class . among these",
    "there are up - down permutations of every length .",
    "these form an infinite subtree of @xmath62 as @xmath57 is closed under taking subpermutations . by knig s lemma",
    ", this tree has an infinite path .",
    "thus @xmath57 contains a sequence of up - down permutations @xmath68 such that , for each @xmath69 , the length of @xmath70 is @xmath69 and @xmath71 is a child of @xmath70 .    by a general construction in @xcite (",
    "theorem 1.2 ) , the set of subpermutations of this sequence of permutations can be described in terms of a map @xmath60 where @xmath60 has the form claimed in the statement of the lemma . in this case",
    "it is easy to carry out the construction directly : inductively define the map @xmath60 ( starting from an empty map ) by defining @xmath72 to be any real number such that the sequence @xmath73 is equivalent to @xmath71 .",
    "[ minimal - non - w ] suppose that the pattern class @xmath57 is not contained in any @xmath48-class .",
    "then @xmath57 contains one of the following pattern classes : @xmath74 { } + } } ^{-1}$ ] , @xmath74 { } -}}^{-1}$ ] , @xmath75 { } + } } ^{-1}$ ] , @xmath75 { } -}}^{-1}$ ] , @xmath52 , or @xmath53 .",
    "consider the map @xmath60 guaranteed by the previous lemma . for @xmath76 , the sequence of real numbers @xmath77 contains an infinite monotone subsequence , labelled @xmath78 .",
    "suppose first that this sequence is increasing , and put @xmath79 , @xmath80 , noting that @xmath81 for all @xmath69 .",
    "now consider the infinite complete graph with vertices @xmath82 for @xmath82 a positive integer .",
    "we colour the edges @xmath83 of this graph with the pattern of the sequence @xmath84 . given the constraints @xmath85 , @xmath86 and @xmath87 there are only three possibilities for this pattern : @xmath88 , @xmath89 and @xmath90 . by ramsey",
    "s theorem the graph contains an infinite monochromatic induced subgraph .",
    "since all permutations equivalent to subsequences of the values of @xmath60 belong to @xmath57 there is no loss of generality in assuming that the entire graph is monochromatic .",
    "however , this implies that @xmath57 contains @xmath52 , @xmath74 { } + } } ^{-1}$ ] or @xmath75 { } + } } ^{-1}$ ] depending on whether the colour occurring is @xmath88 , @xmath89 or @xmath90 .    for the other case , when @xmath77 contains an infinite decreasing sequence , put @xmath91 , @xmath79 so that @xmath92 , and consider instead the graph whose edges @xmath83 are coloured with the pattern of the sequence @xmath93",
    ". then an exactly parallel argument to that of the previous paragraph establishes that @xmath57 must contain one of @xmath53 , @xmath75 { } -}}^{-1}$ ] or @xmath74 { } -}}^{-1}$ ] .",
    "alternatively we could note that in this case the class consisting of the reversals of all the permutations in @xmath57 must be of the type already analysed .",
    "we can now complete the proof of theorem [ n&s ] .",
    "one implication is clear : if @xmath57 has polynomial growth then it can not contain any of the 10 classes specified since these all have exponential growth , and hence @xmath9 must contain a permutation from each of them .    for the converse we shall use proposition [ minimal - non - w ] .",
    "so now suppose that @xmath9 contains a permutation from each of the 10 given pattern classes .",
    "then @xmath57 does not contain any of the 10 classes .",
    "then , by proposition [ minimal - non - w ] , it must be contained in some @xmath48-class @xmath94 ( with @xmath95 segments , say ) .",
    "but , applying proposition [ minimal - non - w ] to @xmath96 , it must also be the case that @xmath57 is contained in the inverse of some @xmath48-class @xmath97 ( with @xmath98 segments say ) .",
    "consider a permutation @xmath0 belonging to the intersection of @xmath99 and @xmath100 .",
    "its representation as an element of @xmath99 divides the positions of @xmath0 into @xmath95 blocks , in each of which the values form a monotone segment .",
    "similarly , its representation as an element of @xmath100 divides the values of @xmath0 into @xmath98 blocks of consecutive elements .",
    "these value blocks might cross - cut each of the @xmath95 position blocks , and likewise the position blocks might cross - cut the value blocks .",
    "however , @xmath0 will have a blocked structure with ( at most ) @xmath101 blocks , where the @xmath102 non - empty blocks are monotone and form a permutation pattern .",
    "figure [ intersect ] provides a simple illustration of this .",
    "since the number of such permutations of length @xmath12 is bounded above by the number of non - negative solutions of @xmath103 , which is a polynomial in @xmath12 of degree @xmath104 , @xmath57 has polynomial growth .",
    "this proof shows that every class of polynomial growth is a subclass of a polynomial growth class defined by a permutation @xmath0 ( of degree @xmath105 say ) and a sequence of @xmath105 signs @xmath106 . to avoid a reduction to a smaller case",
    "we will assume that when this permutation has consecutive terms @xmath107 then not both signs are @xmath39 , and when it has consecutive terms @xmath108 then not both signs are @xmath40 .",
    "the permutations in the class are obtained from @xmath0 by replacing any term associated with @xmath39 by an increasing consecutive segment ( possibly empty ) , and the terms associated with @xmath40 by a decreasing consecutive segment .",
    "therefore any permutation in the class can be specified ( though not generally uniquely ) by the vector of lengths of these segments .",
    "a subclass then corresponds to an ideal in the partially ordered set of such vectors ordered by dominance .",
    "in this section we consider the implications of theorem [ n&s ] for @xmath9 when @xmath109 or @xmath110 . to eliminate trivialities",
    "we will assume throughout this section that each permutation in @xmath9 has length at least three .",

    "we shall deduce properties of @xmath0 using its graph , shown in figure [ upperbound ] as laid out in @xmath174 regions defined by @xmath166 and the points of @xmath60 .",
    "these properties will provide a bound on the number of starred points of @xmath60 .",
    ", width=192 ]    the middle - left and middle - right regions can be divided into rows defined by the starred points of @xmath60 .",
    "similarly , the top - middle and bottom - middle can be divided into columns .",
    "the figure shows the rows in the middle - left region .    for each non - empty row in the middle - left region",
    "choose a representative point of @xmath0 . among these representatives",
    "we can not have a decreasing sequence @xmath175 of length @xmath176 . for",
    "if there were such a sequence then we could find a point @xmath177 among the starred points , below @xmath178 and above @xmath179 , and then @xmath180 would be equivalent to @xmath181 .",
    "an exactly similar argument applies to the representative points of columns in the top - middle region .",
    "now consider the representatives in both the middle - left and top - middle regions . among these",
    "there can not be a decreasing subsequence of length @xmath176 . nor",
    "can there be an increasing subsequence of length @xmath182 ( or together with @xmath183 we would have an increasing subsequence of length @xmath82 , i.e. a subsequence isomorphic to @xmath184 ) . by the erds - szekeres theorem",
    "the total number of representatives in these two regions is at most @xmath185 .",
    "an analogous argument shows that , in the middle - right and bottom - middle regions , there are at most @xmath186 row or column representatives .",
    "so the total number of non - empty rows or columns in these four regions is at most @xmath187 .",
    "next we consider the @xmath188 pairs @xmath189 .",
    "none of these pairs can be two consecutive values as @xmath0 is irreducible , and so each of them must have some separating term ( in the top - middle or bottom - middle if the separation is by position , and in the middle - left or middle - right if the separation is by value ) .",
    "but these separating terms clearly all lie in distinct rows or distinct columns , and it follows that @xmath190 which gives @xmath191 as required .",
    "now consider the case where @xmath192 .",
    "the same argument as above can be used except that here we have @xmath193 pairs of terms ( rather than @xmath194 that require separating representatives ; this leads to the required bound .",
    "the case @xmath195 follows in a similar way .",
    "the second part of the lemma follows from the erds - szekeres theorem since we have a bound on the length of a maximum decreasing subsequence of an irreducible in @xmath196 , while an increasing subsequence can have length at most @xmath182 .",
    "we now discuss how the irreducibles and their properties determine the degree of a polynomial growth class @xmath57 .",
    "every permutation in @xmath57 can be contracted to a unique irreducible permutation by replacing all occurrences of segments @xmath108 by @xmath69 ( and relabelling ) , and doing this repeatedly until the result is irreducible .",
    "for example , @xmath197 reduces to @xmath198 .",
    "the opposite process of replacing each term in an irreducible permutation of @xmath57 by decreasing consecutive segments is called _",
    "expanding_. since every permutation in @xmath57 arises by expanding some irreducible , and since each irreducible of length @xmath105 expands to @xmath199 permutations of length @xmath12 we see that @xmath200 where @xmath105 is the maximal length of an irreducible permutation in @xmath57 .",
    "however , it does not follow that @xmath201 since not every expansion of an irreducible lies in @xmath57 .",
    "we therefore introduce the idea of an expansible set : a subset of the terms of an irreducible permutation @xmath202 is said to be _",
    "expansible _ if the terms can each be replaced simultaneously by an arbitrarily long decreasing consecutive segment to obtain a permutation in the class .",
    "if @xmath202 has an expansible set of size @xmath203 then certainly @xmath204 .",
    "conversely , if @xmath205 , then @xmath57 will contain some irreducible permutation which has an expansible subset of size @xmath203 . to see this note first that @xmath57 is the finite union of subsets @xmath206 , one for each irreducible @xmath207 , where the permutations in @xmath206 all contract to @xmath0 .",
    "therefore there must be some irreducible @xmath0 for which @xmath206 has polynomial growth of degree @xmath208 .",
    "suppose that @xmath209 . then the permutations of length @xmath12 in @xmath206 are determined by a set @xmath210 of @xmath105-tuples of positive integers that sum to @xmath12 .",
    "we wish to show that there is some set of @xmath203 positions in these @xmath105-tuples where all the components are simultaneously unbounded .",
    "if this is not true then we can find some upper bound @xmath211 with the property that , if @xmath212 , then , for all subsets @xmath213 of size @xmath203 of the @xmath105 positions , @xmath214 for some @xmath215 ; but then it follows that @xmath216 for all but @xmath208 of the @xmath105 positions .",
    "hence the permutations of length @xmath12 in @xmath206 fall into @xmath217 subsets ; in each subset there is an associated set of @xmath208 positions and outside of these positions the entries in the @xmath105-tuples are less than @xmath211 .",
    "now it follows that each of the subsets has only @xmath218 elements , and this contradicts @xmath205 .",
    "therefore the sizes of maximal expansible sets determine @xmath35 exactly .",
    "the expansible sets can be characterised by an avoidance condition .",
    "suppose first that neither @xmath36 nor @xmath154 is zero .",
    "then , in order that no subpermutation isomorphic to @xmath21 appears when an expansible subset @xmath213 of an irreducible permutation @xmath202 is expanded , there must not be a subsequence @xmath219 of @xmath202 isomorphic to @xmath220 with both @xmath221 .",
    "of course subpermutations isomorphic to @xmath184 can not arise by expansion at all . in the case",
    "@xmath192 ( or @xmath195 ) the condition is slightly different : we require that there should not be a subsequence @xmath222 isomorphic to @xmath223 with @xmath224 ( or a subsequence @xmath225 isomorphic to @xmath3 with @xmath226 ) .",
    "now , from these remarks and the upper bound on @xmath0 in the above lemma we have    @xmath227    unfortunately , we do not know how good this upper bound is . a lower bound can be obtained as follows .",
    "[ lowerboundirreducible ] there exists an irreducible permutation of size @xmath228 in @xmath229 ; furthermore this permutation has an expansible set of size @xmath168 .",
    "the irreducible we construct consists of @xmath182 interlocking layers of decreasing points , each of size @xmath230 .",
    "for each layer , excluding the lower - leftmost , the bottom @xmath231 points are placed horizontally between the top @xmath232 points in the layer immediately below and to the left . similarly , the top @xmath231 points are placed vertically in the gaps between the bottom @xmath232 points of the layer immediately below and to the left .",
    "thus every pair of consecutive points within a layer is separated by a point from the layer above and one from the layer below .",
    "this gives the permutation :    @xmath233    where @xmath234 , and @xmath235 , @xmath236 , @xmath237 for @xmath238 are the symbols at the bottom right of each layer ( counting layers from bottom left to top right ) .    figure [ lowerbound ] shows the layers as a series of interlocking boxes , with each adjacent pair of layers shown in greater detail .     in @xmath229,width=288 ]",
    "it is clear that the permutation above is irreducible , and that it does not contain any occurrence of @xmath239 ( as there are only @xmath182 layers ) .",
    "if it were to contain @xmath181 , then the occurrence of @xmath181 could only lie in 2 adjacent layers , as two non - adjacent layers do not intersect .",
    "thus the top descent of length @xmath36 of such a @xmath181 in the irreducible could be taken to lie at the top of the upper layer ( or the top of the lower layer , respectively ) , and the bottom descent of length @xmath154 at the bottom of the lower layer ( the bottom of the upper layer , respectively ) .",
    "but in either case this then leaves no points in between for the required increasing layer of size @xmath50 within @xmath21 .",
    "hence this is an irreducible permutation lying in @xmath196 , and it is of size @xmath240 .",
    "now we identify an expansible subset of this permutation .",
    "suppose first that @xmath170 and @xmath171 .",
    "we claim that the subset consisting only of the bottom @xmath232 points from each layer is expansible .",
    "note that such a subpermutation consists of exactly @xmath182 non - intersecting layers , each of size @xmath232 .",
    "none of the bottom @xmath232 points of any layer can be used as the top point in a 4231-pattern , as there are no increases below and to the right of any one of these points .",
    "thus the subpermutation is expansible , and is of size @xmath241 .    in the case",
    "@xmath192 the same proof can be used , but we need to use the top @xmath232 points of each layer instead so that none can be used as a 1 in a @xmath223-pattern .",
    "@xmath242 .",
    "if @xmath243 then @xmath244 or @xmath3 . to within a symmetry that preserves",
    "@xmath20 these are the same so we take @xmath244 .",
    "now put @xmath245 which is the generating function of the enumeration sequence @xmath246 for @xmath247 .",
    "we now appeal to a result of mansour and vainshtein ( theorem 2.1 of @xcite ) .",
    "it tells us that @xmath248 since both @xmath184 and @xmath21 are irreducible , the class @xmath249 can be obtained from its irreducible permutations by arbitrarily expanding individual elements into descending segments .",
    "such classes were investigated in @xcite where it was shown that , if we define @xmath250 , then @xmath251 will be the generating function for the irreducible elements of @xmath249 .",
    "after some manipulation we obtain @xmath252 although this equation is similar to the previous equation it differs in that the summation starts at @xmath253 and this means that @xmath251 does not appear on the right - hand side of the equation .",
    "it follows that each @xmath251 is a polynomial in @xmath254 .",
    "@xmath251 has degree @xmath255 and leading coefficient the @xmath256th catalan number @xmath257 for all @xmath258 .",
    "we have @xmath259 and all other @xmath251 are given by the recurrence .",
    "let @xmath260 be the degree of @xmath251 .",
    "then we have @xmath261 and , from the recurrence , @xmath262 and @xmath263 follows by induction .    next , if @xmath264 is the leading coefficient of @xmath251 we obtain @xmath265 and , again by induction , @xmath266 .",
    "the pattern class @xmath267 is enumerated by a polynomial of degree @xmath268 with leading coefficient @xmath269 .",
    "as noted above , this follows from the results of @xcite , specifically that @xmath270 this equation simply captures symbolically the fact that each permutation belonging to @xmath249 is obtained uniquely from the expansion of some irreducible in the class .      in this subsection",
    "we shall take @xmath272 .",
    "let @xmath60 be an arbitrary irreducible permutation belonging to @xmath273 .",
    "if @xmath274 is an expansible subset of @xmath60 , then @xmath275 when @xmath170 and @xmath171 , and @xmath276 when @xmath192 or @xmath195 .",
    "first assume @xmath170 and @xmath171 , and note that an expansible subset of @xmath60 will necessarily avoid 4231 .",
    "thus , @xmath274 avoids @xmath277 and @xmath220 .",
    "let @xmath278 . by proposition 3.2 of @xcite , @xmath279 ,",
    "where , in the permutation @xmath280 that is equivalent to @xmath274 , each @xmath281 is consecutive decreasing .",
    "thus in @xmath282 there are at least @xmath283 consecutive decreasing pairs @xmath108 .",
    "each of these , as pairs of @xmath60 , must be separated by some point of @xmath60 .",
    "we shall show that two pairs @xmath284 can not be separated by the same term of @xmath60 .",
    "assume without loss of generality that @xmath285 lies to the left of @xmath286 .",
    "there are two cases :    1 .",
    "@xmath287 : here separating both pairs would create a 123 pattern .",
    "@xmath288 : here separating both pairs would create a @xmath220-pattern , contradicting @xmath274 being expansible .",
    "hence @xmath289 , but ( by lemma [ maxdescent ] ) @xmath290 so @xmath291 .    in the case when @xmath192 , we know that an expansible subset must now avoid @xmath223 .",
    "so @xmath274 is easily seen to have @xmath110 segments rather than @xmath292 and so @xmath293 , giving @xmath294 .",
    "this lemma gave an upper bound on the size of an expansible set .",
    "a matching lower bound can be obtained from the construction in lemma [ lowerboundirreducible ] specialised to @xmath271 . in the permutation given there we simply take the bottom @xmath295 points from each of the two decreasing sequences defined , and verify that this set of @xmath296 points is expansible . together with the last lemma this proves the first statement of the next proposition ; the last statement is a small variation on the first whose details we omit .    if @xmath170 and @xmath171 then @xmath297 . if either @xmath192 or @xmath195 , @xmath298 .",
    "we have given a criterion for a pattern class to have polynomial growth in terms of its basis and this enabled us to give complete sets of two or three pattern restrictions to produce polynomial growth .",
    "however , the criterion produces neither the enumerating polynomial nor its degree , and so we gave some properties of these polynomials in the case of two restrictions .",
    "in general , it remains open to determine exactly what the polynomials are .",
    "this work might be regarded as a first step in characterising possible enumeration functions for a pattern class .",
