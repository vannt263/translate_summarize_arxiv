    "the optical beam splitter is a fundamental device in optics @xcite and is widely used in quantum information science and technology , such as quantum communications @xcite , linear - optics quantum computation @xcite ( based on non - classical interference of photons @xcite ) , and even quantum metrology @xcite . the conventional beam splitter is simply a cube with two triangular prisms glued together , or a plate of glass with a thin coating .",
    "the photon reflected or transmitted by such a beam splitter leaves no imprint in the splitter itself , and the conventional beam splitter can not deterministically generate photonic entanglement @xcite . in this paper , we propose a beam splitter consisting of a singly charged quantum dot ( qd ) strongly coupled to a double - sided microcavity .",
    "such a structure can act as an entanglement beam splitter(ebs ) which directly splits an initial product state of photon and spin into two entangled states via transmission and reflection in a deterministic way .    in this paper , we introduce the transmission and reflection operators for such an ebs as @xmath0 where @xmath1 , @xmath2 are right - circular and left - circular polarization states of photon and @xmath3 , @xmath4 are the electron spin - up and spin - down states .",
    "we note that the transmission or reflection operator for our splitter is the same as the entanglement filter recently demonstrated by okamoto et al @xcite .",
    "this entanglement filter is constructed from partially polarizing beam splitters and can be used for the creation and purification of photon - photon entanglement probabilistically ( with @xmath5 success probability)@xcite .",
    "however our ebs is in principle 100% efficient in converting the input photon - spin product state @xmath6 into the two constituent entangled states : @xmath7 in the transmission port and @xmath8 in the reflection port . besides the photon - spin entanglement",
    ", we show that the ebs can easily be configured to transfer the quantum state between a photon and a spin by measuring out the photon ( spin ) information in a suitable basis . similarly by sending two photons in a product state into the ebs ,",
    "all combinations of photon outputs can be shown to be deterministically entangled once the spin is measured out . as a result , the ebs can be widely applied in quantum information science and technology .    in our previous work",
    ", we introduced another photon - spin entangling gate @xcite .",
    "the current ebs and the previous gate are both deterministic for entanglement generation and are immune to the fine structure splitting in realistic semiconductor qds .",
    "the two quantum devices are both based on the giant circular birefringence induced by a single spin strongly coupled to an optical microcavity .",
    "the giant circular birefringence for such spin - cavity systems can manifest itself as the differences in e.g. , effective refractive index , phase , or reflection / transmission coefficients between the two circular polarizations .",
    "the previous gate works in the reflection geometry and is constructed from a single - sided cavity with one mirror partially reflective and another mirror @xmath9 reflective .",
    "such a spin - cavity system shows large phase difference between the uncoupled ( cold ) cavity and the coupled ( hot ) cavity , which induces the giant faraday rotation and is exploited to build the gate .",
    "this gate is fragile because it demands that the reflectance for the uncoupled and the coupled cavity should be balanced to get high fidelity .",
    "however , the ebs works in reflection / transmission geometry , and is constructed from a double - sided cavity with both mirrors partially reflective .",
    "such a spin - cavity shows large reflectance and transmittance difference between the uncoupled and the coupled cavity , which is exploited to build the ebs .",
    "the larger the spin - cavity coupling strength , the higher the ebs fidelity . therefore , the ebs is robust and flexible compared to the previous gate .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "ii , the photon - spin ebs is introduced , and we discuss the efficiency and the fidelity to generate the photon - spin entanglement .",
    "we also discuss how the photon - spin entanglement can be used for a single - shot quantum non - demolition measurement of a single spin . in sec .",
    "iii we show the ebs can be used to implement a photon - spin quantum interface . in sec .",
    "iv , we discuss another application of the ebs in entangling independent photons , and show how remote spin entanglement can be also generated by the ebs .",
    "finally , we present our conclusions and the outlook .",
    "we consider a singly charged qd ( e.g. , self - assembled in(ga)as qd , gaas interfacial qd , or semiconductor nanocrystal ) placed at the antinode of an double - sided optical microcavity . for example , fig .",
    "1(a ) shows a micropillar microcavity where two gaas / al(ga)as distributed bragg reflectors ( dbr ) and transverse index guiding provide three - dimensional confinement of light .",
    "in contrast to our previous work @xcite , the two dbrs are made partially reflective ( double - sided ) , symmetric , and low loss in order to achieve high on - resonance transmission .",
    "the cross section of the micropillar is made circular to make the cavity mode degenerate for circularly polarized light .",

    ", the in - plane anisotropy lifts the degeneracy of the bright neutral exciton , which is called fine structure splitting , via the anisotropic electron - hole exchange interactions , but induces no splitting for the charged exciton @xmath10 due to the quenched exchange interaction @xcite .",
    "therefore , the spin levels of @xmath10 are degenerate as shown in fig .",
    "however , the in - plane anisotropy could modify the hole states and thus affect the spin selection rule .",
    "the light - hole sub - band and the split - off sub - band are energetically far apart from the heavy - hole sub - band and can be neglected .",
    "the spin is quantized along the normal direction of the cavity , i.e. , the propagation direction of the input ( or output ) light .    for gaas - based or inas - based charged qds ,",
    "recent experiments have shown long electron spin coherence time ( @xmath19s ) after suppressing the nuclear spin fluctuations @xcite , and long electron spin relaxation time ( @xmath20ms ) @xcite due to the suppressed electron - phonon and spin - orbit interactions in qds .",
    "these results indicate that qd - confined spin is one of the promising solid - state quantum - bit ( qubit ) systems .      in the approximation of weak excitation where the charged qd is predominantly in the ground state , we take @xmath36 .",
    "the reflection and transmission coefficients in the steady state can be obtained @xmath37}{[i(\\omega_{x^-}-\\omega)+ \\frac{\\gamma}{2}][i(\\omega_c-\\omega)+\\kappa+\\frac{\\kappa_s}{2}]+\\text{g}^2}. \\end{split } \\label{eq2}\\ ] ] the weak excitation approximation demands that the intracavity photon number should be less than the critical photon number @xmath38 which measures the number of photons in the cavity required to saturate the qd response @xcite .",
    "this condition is satisfied if the input beam is a train of single photons with the photon rate less than @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is the cavity lifetime .",
    "this situation is what we consider in this work @xcite .",
    "moreover , for the high fidelity operation of the ebs , the spectral width of single photons should be much smaller than the linewidth of the cavity mode , i.e. , the coherence length of single photons should be much longer than the cavity lifetime .",
    "this means the photon is never completely localized in the cavity , therefore , the charged qd almost remains in the ground state all the time .",
    "although single photons as the input are discussed in this work and our previous work @xcite ( as single photons are robust ) , we have to emphasize here that all discussions can be extended to a weak laser as the input as long as the weak excitation condition is satisfied",
    ". this can be done by replacing the single photon state with the coherent state .",
    "details shall be discussed elsewhere @xcite .    instead of the dispersive interaction @xcite",
    ", we consider here the resonant interaction with @xmath41 . by taking @xmath42",
    ", we get the reflection and transmission coefficients @xmath43 , @xmath44 for a uncoupled cavity ( or cold cavity ) where the qd does not couple to the cavity @xcite : @xmath45    the reflection and transmission spectra versus the detuning @xmath46 are presented in fig .",
    "2(a ) for different coupling strength @xmath47 . with increasing @xmath47 ( e.g. by reducing the modal volume or increasing the @xmath10 oscillator strength ) ,",
    "the cavity mode splits into two peaks due to the quantum interference in the one - dimensional atomregime @xcite with @xmath48 ( which has been demonstrated recently @xcite ) , and the vacuum rabi splitting in the strong coupling regime @xcite with @xmath49 .",
    "we can see that the transmittance or reflectance are different between the uncoupled cavity with @xmath42 and the coupled cavity ( or hot cavity ) with @xmath50 .",

    "the difference in transmission and reflection , or even in the phase @xcite , between the right and left circular polarizations are all called the giant circular birefringence induced by a single spin .",
    "this enables us to make a quantum device - an entanglement beam splitter .",
    "for any quantum input we can define the transmission operator as @xmath55 and the reflection operator as @xmath56 where @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath57 , @xmath58 are the reflection and transmission coefficients of the uncoupled and coupled cavity , respectively .",
    "both operators include the contributions from the uncoupled and coupled cavity .    in the strong coupling regime @xmath49 and in the central frequency regime @xmath59 , we have @xmath60 and @xmath61 [ see fig .",

    "@xmath81 shows a weak dependence on the side leakage ( solid curve ) , but @xmath78 decreases rapidly ( dotted curve ) because @xmath82 when @xmath83 is significant .",
    "the spin selection rule is not perfect for a realistic qd due to the heavy - light hole mixing .",
    "this can reduce the entanglement fidelity by a few percent as the hole mixing in the valence band is in the order of a few percent @xcite [ e.g. , for self - assembled in(ga)as qds ] .",
    "the hole mixing could be reduced by engineering the shape and size of qds or choosing different types of qds .",
    "the exciton dephasing can also reduce the entanglement fidelity by amount of @xmath84 $ ] , where @xmath40 is the cavity photon lifetime and @xmath85 is the exciton coherence time .",
    "two kinds of dephasing processes should be mentioned here : the optical dephasing and the spin dephasing of @xmath10 .",
    "it is well - known that the optical coherence time of excitons in self - assembled in(ga)as qds can be as long as several hundred picoseconds @xcite , which is ten times longer than the cavity photon lifetime ( around tens of picoseconds in the strong coupling regime for cavity q - factor of @xmath86 ) .",
    "so the optical dephasing can only slightly reduce the entanglement fidelity by less than @xmath87 .",
    "the spin dephasing of the @xmath10 is mainly due to the hole - spin dephasing . in the absence of the contact hyperfine interaction that happens for holes @xcite ,",
    "the qd - hole spin is expected to have long coherence time , and @xmath88 ns has been reported recently @xcite .",
    "this spin coherence time is at least three orders of magnitude longer than the cavity photon lifetime , so the spin dephasing of the @xmath10 can be safely neglected in our considerations .",
    "the photon - spin entanglement enables us to make an ideal quantum measurement of the single spin by measuring the helicity of the transmitted or reflected photon .",
    "although the resonant interaction is considered here , the weak excitation condition implies the real excitation of @xmath10 transition is negligible . as a result ,",
    "the spin disturbance by the input photon is small .",

    "<S> we propose an entanglement beam splitter ( ebs ) using a quantum - dot spin in a double - sided optical microcavity . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast to the conventional optical beam splitter , the ebs can directly split a photon - spin product state into two constituent entangled states via transmission and reflection with high fidelity and high efficiency ( up to 100 percent ) . </S>",
    "<S> this device is based on giant optical circular birefringence induced by a single spin as a result of cavity quantum electrodynamics and the spin selection rule of trion transition ( pauli blocking ) . </S>",
    "<S> the ebs is robust and it is immune to the fine structure splitting in a realistic quantum dot . </S>",
    "<S> this quantum device can be used for deterministically creating photon - spin , photon - photon and spin - spin entanglement as well as a single - shot quantum non - demolition measurement of a single spin . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the ebs can find wide applications in quantum information science and technology . </S>"
