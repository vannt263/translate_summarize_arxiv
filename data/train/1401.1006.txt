    "the discovery of hundreds of extrasolar planets has hurled the topic of planetary studies into centerstage : planet formation , planetary dynamics , planetary geology , etc . ; among these studies , the question of planet habitability is of great interest , even if no hard data beyond earth exists , yet .",
    "the quest for life on other planets started long ago when in the 60 s , frank drake used the 85-foot radius telescope in west virginia , hoping to detect an extraterrestrial signal @xcite .",
    "however , extraterrestrial life , if it indeed exists in the neighborhood of the sun , is most likely of a basic type ( e.g. microbial ) .",
    "although a new emerging view is that planets very different to earth may have the right conditions for life , which increases future chances of discovering an inhabited world @xcite , it is a good first step along this endeavor to find out if conditions propitious to earth - like planetary life ( the only type we know for sure so far ) exists .    even in the case of earth ,",
    "life exists in many diverse environments , from scorching deserts to the eternal darkness of the ocean depths , and even deep within earth s crust . confronted with this bewildering diversity of environments",
    ", we must look for the most basic ingredients , like liquid water . on the other hand , our observational limitations to detect the most important habitability indicator : water vapor on terrestrial - like exoplanets , reduces our possibilities of finding habitable planets .",
    "up to now , we have been able to characterize habitable zones mainly around single stars , consequently , the quest for habitable worlds has been mostly limited to this type of stars . but given the fact that most stars appear to be part of binary and multiple systems , we must extend the habitable - zone concept to those cases .",
    "the condition for the existence of liquid water on the surface of a planet @xcite , is the usual defining condition for what is now called the circumstellar habitable zone ( chz ) .",
    "@xcite studied the limits of the chz in late type stars and concluded that k dwarfs have a narrow chz and later dwarfs have none at all .",
    "however , other studies that include among other things , atmospheric radiative transfer modeling , have come with a more optimistic and , rather complicated outlook ( e.g. @xcite ) . in this case",
    ", habitability seems to be a very planet - specific matter @xcite .",
    "for example , the habitable zone calculations defined for a dry rocky planet , with a minimum inner edge of about 0.5 au , for a solar - like host star ( @xcite ) , out to 10 au for a planet with an h2 atmosphere and no interior energy , around a solar - like host star @xcite , and even possibly out to free - floating habitable planets , with no host star , for planets with thick h2 atmospheres @xcite .    for the case of planets in binary stellar systems ,",
    "the usual radiative condition used to define habitable zones around single stars must be extended to the case of two sources of illumination whose relative positions change in time .",
    "additionally , a condition of dynamical stability must be added , as the more complex and time varying potential turns unstable whole swaths of phase space . for a planet to be a possible adobe of life",
    ", both conditions must be satisfied , and for a long time , enough for life to develop .    in the present work we will use @xcite definition of habitable zone around single stars and extend it to the case of binary stars . as such ,",
    "this is a simple definition of the habitable zone based on stellar flux limits .",
    "some of the more complicated ( and realistic ) effects that pertain to particular situations , can be incorporated into this simple criterion by the use of `` corrective factors '' applied to the stellar fluxes that define the limits of the habitable zones .",
    "an example of this is provided by e.g. @xcite , who introduce a factor called `` spectrally weighted flux '' .",
    "studies like the previous ones , have been applied traditionally to single stars or brown dwarfs , however , most low - mass main - sequence stars are members of binary or multiple systems ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , and in particular in the solar neighborhood , the fraction goes up to  50% ( @xcite @xcite ) .",
    "this suggests that binary formation is at least as probable as single star formation processes @xcite .",
    "additionally , several types of planets have been discovered in circumstellar orbits , even in close binary systems , where the effect of the stellar companion might be of great importance ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite , and also in circumbinary discs ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "for a review on the subject see @xcite ; and @xcite .",
    "we provide in this work a general theoretical formulation to calculate the equivalent of the @xcite habitable zone for single stars , but for binary systems ( see section [ sec : habzone ] ) .",
    "this formulation is expressed in formulae and interpolating tables that the reader can apply to any specific case .",
    "our work also considers binary systems with no restriction on the eccentricity of the binary orbits and guarantees that orbits within the computed habitable zones remain so , at all binary orbital phases .",
    "we only consider approximately circular habitable zones .",
    "for the dynamical stability condition , we use the work of @xcite and @xcite , who found the extent of stable , non - intersecting orbits around binary systems , based on the existence of sturdy structures in the extended phase - space of the system ( the so called `` invariant loops '' ) .",
    "we have then applied both conditions to a sample of main sequence binary systems in the solar neighborhood with known orbital parameters and present our results .",
    "these constitute regions where we think it is most likely to find planets suitable for life in these binary systems .",
    "several other interesting papers have been submitted on this subject recently , for circular binary systems ( @xcite ) , and for the general case of elliptical binary systems ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "however all these formulations take as the stability criterion that of @xcite .",
    "the empirical approximation of holman & wiegert to the stability problem in binaries , was an excellent and fundamental first approximation to the solution .",
    "their work was based on a detailed trial and error technique to find the most stable ( long - term ) orbits in disks around binaries .",
    "the authors defined as stable orbits mostly those that would keep in their orbits for about @xmath0 binary periods ( in general not enough to ensure life emergency and development though ) . on the other hand , and as the authors point out explicitly in their work , their formulation for stability regions breaks toward higher eccentricity binaries due to the rapidly increasing difficulty to recover stable orbits from this methodology .    in this paper , we rely on the invariant loops theory , which by definition are invariant structures in the extended phase - space of the system .",
    "the existence of invariant loops guarantees the stability of orbits for all times and not just during the integration span , as long as the binary parameters ( stellar masses , semi - major axis and orbital eccentricity ) do not change .",
    "their stability is given by the constants of motion that support them .",
    "the orbit integration is only used to identify these structures in extended phase - space ( for details see @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "because of its nature , this formulation has no restrictions in eccentricity or mass ratio .",
    "with this criterion we search for the intersection between the stable regions for planets and a short , straightforward , and also general formulation for habitability .",
    "additionally , it is relevant to mention here , that the use of the invariant loops criterion shows , for example in the circumbinary disks case , important differences in the position of stable regions @xcite with respect to previous work , that should be taken into account in habitability calculations .",
    "we explain this in detail along this paper .    in the second part of this work we also provide a sample of binary systems of the solar neighborhood ( the whole sample of binary stars , in the main sequence , with all orbital parameters known at the present time in literature ) , with their habitable zones computed using the approach in this work for habitability and planetary orbital stability .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : habzone ] the radiative condition for habitability is extended from the usual circumstellar case , and a detailed description of the formulation used to calculate the radiative safe zones is provided . in section [ sec : stabcrit ] we present the dynamical stability condition for habitability used in this work . [",
    "sec : partcases ] , the combined conditions are used to compute habitability zones for particular cases and the construction of a table of binaries , with known orbital parameters , for stars in the main sequence .",
    "finally , our conclusions are given in section [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "a common definition of the chz uses limits in the radiative stellar flux at the planet ( e.g. @xcite ) :        the chz thus defined is a thick spherical shell that surrounds the star , whose thickness and size depend on the star s luminosity .",
    "however , an important fraction of stars in the solar neighborhood are part of binary systems .",
    "the fact that planets have already been discovered within binary systems , makes it necessary to extend the simple definition of the chz to the stellar binary case .    in this section",
    "we extend the simple chz condition for single stars given by the previous equation , to the case of stellar binary systems . in this case we have two sources of luminosity at positions that change with the binary orbital phase .",
    "it may be thought that in this case it is simply a matter of applying the equation twice , once for each star .",
    "however , this naive approach is not correct , since there may be regions where , although within the individual chz for each star , the combined irradiance of both stars may push the region out of the combined habitable zone .",
    "additionally , it is fundamental to add the condition of orbital stability , as both , the correct irradiance and orbital stable regions should have a non - empty intersection during the entire binary orbital phase , for planets to be able to exist within a proper binary habitable zone . in figure",
    "[ fig : bhz_diagram ] , we present a schematic figure that shows the combined concept to construct habitable zones in a binary star : the radiative safe zone in gray circles ( upper half of the diagram ) , and the stable regions for orbits to settle down ( lower half of the diagram ) . notice how the demand that both conditions ( radiative and dynamical ) are met , severely restricts the resulting bhz .    since what matters is the total combined irradiance at a given point",
    ", we should add the individual stellar fluxes in the chz condition given by equation  ( [ eq : chzdef ] ) , to arrive at the condition for the radiative safe zone .",
    "the total stellar flux is given by : @xmath5 , \\label{eq : binirrad}\\ ] ] here @xmath6 is the total binary luminosity and @xmath7 is the fractional contribution of the secondary star to it . @xmath8 and @xmath9 are cartesian coordinates in the binary orbital plane and @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the primary and secondary star distances to their barycenter .",
    "the @xmath8-axis contains both stars .        to illustrate the concept of binary habitable zone",
    ", we show in fig .",
    "[ fig : bhz_diagram ] a schematic diagram that presents the radiative condition ( upper half ) and dynamical condition ( lower half ) .",
    "the stars are the black dots on the x - axis , whose size is proportional to the assumed luminosity ( upper half ) , or mass ( lower half ) . in the upper half ,",
    "isopleths of constant combined stellar flux are shown , with those corresponding to the boundaries of the raditaive safe zone shown with thick black lines .",
    "the raditaive safe zone is shaded in gray .",
    "likewise , in the lower half of the diagram , equipotentials are shown with the circumbinary and two circumstellar dynamical safe zones in gray .",
    "notice that the saddle point between the stars for isopleths and equipotentials does not coincide , as the former is set by the relative luminosities , whereas the latter by their mass ratio .",
    "we define our binary habitable zones ( bhz ) as the annular regions ( shown in green ) where both conditions are met . for the circumbinary habitable zone",
    ", it is an annular region centered at the barycenter of the system . for the circumstellar habitable zones",
    ", they are annular regions centered in the corresponding star .",
    "notice that in this particular example there is a circumbinary and a circumsecondary habitable zones , but not a circumprimary . in this section",
    "we will tackle the radiative condition alone , leaving the condition of dynamical stability for the next section and the combined effect for section 4 .",
    "the edges of the radiative safe zone are set by two stellar flux isopleths and the resulting shape is more complicated that that of the chz . figure ( [ fig : bhzillust ] ) illustrates a particular example : the gray region is the radiative safe zone .",
    "dashed lines indicate possible planetary orbits that are not fit for life , while solid lines indicate safe orbits ( we have approximated the planetary orbits as circles centered in either star , or the barycenter ) .",
    "notice that for an orbit to be safe , it must remain within the radiative safe zone at all times . in this particular case , there are safe circumprimary and circumsecondary planetary orbits , but no circumbinary ones .",
    "in addition to the above complication , the separation between the stars will vary for the general case of binaries with elliptical orbits .",
    "first we will tackle the simpler case of circular orbit binaries .",
    "the star distances to the barycenter are given by : : @xmath12 where the @xmath13 and @xmath14 subindexes refer to the primary and secondary stars , @xmath15 are the individual stellar masses and @xmath16 is the total mass .",
    "finally , @xmath17 is the constant distance between the stars .",
    "if we take the interstellar distance and total mass as units of length and mass , we can write the previous relation as : @xmath18 where @xmath19 is dimensionless distance and @xmath20 is the mass fraction due to the secondary .    a similar scaling in luminosity",
    "can be accomplished adopting @xmath6 as its unit .",
    "the dimensionless combined stellar flux is then : @xmath21 where @xmath22 are the corresponding dimensionless cartesian coordinates .",
    "notice that @xmath23 is completely set by the luminosity and mass ratios , its unit is @xmath24 .",
    "figure  ( [ fig : ic ] ) shows the value of the critical flux isopleth as a function of the secondary luminosity fraction .",
    "notice that @xmath27 does not depend on the mass ratio @xmath28 .",
    "this is because the latter only shifts the isopleths on the orbital plane ( see equations  [ eq : qshift ] ) .",
    "the curve is also symmetric with respect to @xmath29 .",
    "this is because @xmath30 can refer to either star ( the more massive star is not necessarily the most luminous one ) .",
    "so we drop the @xmath14 subindex from now on .",
    "depending on the value of the dimensionless stellar fluxes that define the chz ( equation  [ eq : chzdef ] ) with respect to the critical isopleth flux , the radiative safe zone may have three different configurations :    configuration i : ( @xmath32 ) .",
    ": :    this corresponds to 2 separate circumstellar radiative safe zones .",
    "configuration ii : ( @xmath33 ) .",
    ": :    this corresponds to a combined case , where we find a circumbinary    radiative safe zone with two inner holes around the stars .",
    "configuration iii : ( @xmath34 ) .",
    ": :    this corresponds to a single radiative safe zone with a single inner    hole .        in any of these configurations ,",
    "safer planetary orbits are the ones better contained within the safe radiative zone . in the most strict sense",
    ", this means that we must consider their shape , which introduces an added complexity we will not get into . since stable orbital planetary configurations in binaries have in general low eccentricities ( smaller to @xmath350.3 , @xcite ) , we will define a radiative binary habitable zone ( rbhz ) as the largest circular annular region that can fit entirely within the radiative safe zone .",
    "we consider two cases : circumstellar and circumbinary zones .",
    "orbits that are safe for life will lay most likely within these zones",
    ". we should remember that these zones are defined by the radiative condition only . in next section",
    "we will consider the dynamical condition and in section [ sec : partcases ] we will combined both conditions to define the combined binary habitable zone .",
    "now , a problem arises because the flux isopleths are not circles ( see figure  [ fig : isopleths ] ) , particularly close to the critical isopleth .",
    "our definition of bhz implies that the largest safe orbit must be entirely inscribed within the flux isopleth that defines the outer boundary of the safe zone .",
    "similarly , the smallest safe orbit must be entirely circumscribed outside the inner boundary flux isopleth .",
    "note that this condition is not over the planetary orbit itself but just in order to fix the boundaries for habitability , in such way that it is possible to ensure that a planet will remains all the time inside this zone .        in this case",
    "we have two separate circumstellar habitable zones .",
    "the orbital radius of the largest safe planetary orbit is given by the smallest distance between the outer boundary isopleth and the corresponding star .",
    "this ensures that the orbit will remain within the outer boundary isopleth .",
    "similarly , for the radius of the smallest , circumstellar safe orbit , we must now consider the maximum distance from either star to the corresponding inner boundary flux isopleth , so the orbit remains outside it at all times .",
    "the circumstellar isopleths are elongated along the @xmath36 axis in the direction of the other star , while they are squashed in the opposite direction .",
    "this means that both , the outer and inner circumstellar orbital radii ( @xmath37 and @xmath38 , respectively ) correspond to the respective boundary isopleth intersections with the @xmath36 axis ( see figure [ fig : cstellar ] ) .",
    "intersection opposite the other star ( left solid circle ) .",
    "if the isopleth is the inner boundary , the smallest safe orbit touches the isopleth at the opposite @xmath36 intersection ( right solid circle ) .",
    "the case shown is @xmath39 , @xmath40 and the isopleth depicted is @xmath41 .",
    "the primary star , which in this example is also the most luminous , is the one on the left . ]        where @xmath44 is the dimensionless flux value that defines the rbhz boundary and @xmath11 is either , the outer circumstellar orbital radius @xmath37 , or the inner one @xmath38 , depending on the solution we choose .",
    "unfortunately , although 4degree polynomials can always be solved by radicals , the solution in this case is quite cumbersome .",
    "we have decided instead , to list in table  [ tab : rs ] some solutions .",
    "the first value at each entry corresponds to @xmath37 ( smallest value ) , the second to @xmath38 .",
    "we list results from the critical isopleth up to thrice its value only , because for larger values , the circumstellar boundaries are very close to the star and the single star chz criterion ( equation  ( [ eq : chzdef ] ) ) is sufficient .",
    "this is shown in figure  [ fig : risapprox ] , where the fractional error made in using the chz criterion individually for each star , instead of the true value obtained by solving equation  ( [ eq : rs ] ) , is shown as a function of the flux value for the inner boundary .",
    "we can see that for values larger than those listed in table  [ tab : rs ] , the error drops well below 1% .",
    ", as a function of the inner boundary flux value ( in units of the critical flux value ) .",
    "the solid line is for the most luminous star ( @xmath45 ) , while the dashed line is for the less luminous star ( @xmath25 ) . ]           & @xmath53 equ & 4.73 & 0.42 & 1.66 & 1.59 & 0.66 & 0.64

    "<S> a general formulation to compute habitable zones around binary stars is presented . </S>",
    "<S> a habitable zone in this context must satisfy two separate conditions : a radiative one and one of dynamical stability . for the case of single stars , the usual concept of circumstellar habitable zone </S>",
    "<S> is based on the radiative condition only , as the dynamical stability condition is taken for granted ( assuming minimal perturbation from other planets ) . for the radiative condition , we extend the simple formulation of the circumstellar habitable zone for single stars , to the case of eccentric stellar binary systems , where two sources of luminosity at different orbital phases contribute to the irradiance of their planetary circumstellar and circumbinary regions . </S>",
    "<S> our approach considers binaries with eccentric orbits and guarantees that orbits in the computed habitable zone remain within it at all orbital phases . for the dynamical stability condition </S>",
    "<S> , we use the approach of invariant loops developed by pichardo et al . </S>",
    "<S> ( 2005 ) to find regions of stable , non - intersecting orbits , which is a robust method to find stable regions in binary stars , as it is based in the existence of integrals of motion . </S>",
    "<S> we apply the combined criteria to calculate habitable zones for 64 binary stars in the solar neighborhood with known orbital parameters , including some with discovered planets . </S>",
    "<S> formulae and interpolating tables are provided , so the reader can compute the boundaries of the habitable zones for an arbitrary binary system , using the stellar flux limits they prefer . </S>",
    "<S> together with the formulae provided for stable zones , these allow the computation of both regions of stability and habitability around any binary stellar system . </S>",
    "<S> we found 56% of the cases we consider can satisfy both restrictions , this is a very important constriction to binary systems . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , we conclude that these systems where a dynamical and radiative safe zone exists , must be considered strong candidates in the search for habitable planets .    </S>",
