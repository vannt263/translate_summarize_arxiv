    "it is thought that the critical phenomena of the anderson transition may be classified according to three universality classes ( orthogonal , unitary and symplectic ) depending on the symmetries of the hamiltonian , i.e. time reversal and spin rotation symmetries .",

    "affects the localization of electrons , e.g. , an even - odd system size dependence of the quasi-1d localization length is observed @xcite . here",
    "we investigate whether or not chiral symmetry also affects the critical exponent @xmath1 .",
    "a system belongs to the symplectic universality class if its hamiltonian commutes with a time reversal operator @xmath2 that satisfies @xmath3 , e.g. , systems with significant spin - orbit coupling . systems in this universality class exhibit an anderson transition even in 2d .",
    "recently we analysed the su(2 ) model with an on - site random potential ( diagonal disorder ) , which breaks chiral symmetry , and estimated the critical exponent @xmath4 @xcite .    here",
    "we study the su(2 ) model without an on - site random potential . in spite of the fact that there is no random potential",
    ", we find that there is an anderson transition at a critical energy @xmath5 .",
    "further this energy @xmath5 is far from the the band center and chiral symmetry does not affect the observed critical phenomena .",

    "we distribute hopping matrices randomly and independently with uniform probability on the group su(2 ) .",

    "we calculate the localization length @xmath17 on a quasi-1d strip whose width is @xmath18 with the transfer matrix method @xcite and analyse the dependence of the re - normalized localization length @xmath19 on the energy and the width of the strip @xcite .",
    "we also calculate the density of states with the green s function iteration method @xcite .",
    "in the course of our calculations we noticed a technical problem with the method described in @xcite . when fitting the numerical data it is important to have not only an estimate of the localization length @xmath17 but also an estimate @xmath20 of how accurately @xmath17 has been estimated .",
    "otherwise a reliable fitting of the data is not possible .",
    "we have found that the error @xmath20 is over estimated by the method of @xcite . to overcome this problem we divide the quasi-1d strip into blocks whose lengths are @xmath21 and calculate the quasi-1d localization length @xmath22(@xmath9 denotes the block ) in each block and accumulate @xmath22 . from the distribution of @xmath23",

    "[ fig : su2w0cp ] we show the result for the combined even and odd data .",
    "the lines cross at single point , indicating both that corrections to scaling due to irrelevant variables are negligible and also that an even - odd effect does not exist .",
