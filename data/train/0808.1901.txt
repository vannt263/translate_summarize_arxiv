    "the prediction of an attractive , quantum electrodynamic force between two electrically neutral metal plates in vacuum has been of great scientific interest since hendrik casimir originally proposed the effect in 1948 @xcite .",
    "a number of reviews describe various aspects of this and other effects resulting from the boundary conditions imposed on the quantized electromagnetic fields @xcite .",
    "the early work of derjaguin @xcite , sparnaay @xcite , and van blokland and overbeek @xcite demonstrated the effect ; however it was not until the experiment of lamoreaux @xcite that a precision measurement of the casimir force was made .",
    "several additional experiments further confirmed the effect using a variety of techniques @xcite .",
    "a more general theory was developed by lifshitz , dzyaloshinskii and pitaevskii , which takes into account the non - ideal reflectivity of real metals , and allows for the calculation of forces between bodies of arbitrary dielectric function separated by a medium , which need not be vacuum @xcite .",
    "this formalism , which is based on the fluctuation - dissipation theorem , completely describes the van der waals force at short range @xcite and simplifies to casimir s result for ideal metal plates separated by vacuum .",
    "recently , there has been interest in the measurement of long - range quantum electrodynamic forces between solids immersed in a fluid to test both the generality of lifshitz s theory as well as the technological feasibility of incorporating these forces into nano- and micro - devices .",
    "it is of theoretical interest to better understand the applicability of the electromagnetic stress tensor to dissipative media used for such calculations @xcite . from a technological viewpoint ,",
    "tailoring these forces could lead to methods for reducing stiction in microelectromechanical systems ( mems ) @xcite and to the development of ultralow friction devices and sensors @xcite .",
    "two of the current authors ( jnm and fc ) recently reported measurements of the casimir - lifshitz force between two metal surfaces in a fluid @xcite . in response to criticism that electrostatic effects were not adequately taken into account @xcite , we reported additional experiments that showed that residual electrostatic contributions to the total force were small and that they could not be due to work function differences alone between the metal films but were likely due to stray fields associated with trapped charges @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we describe in detail the origin of the electrostatic forces in our experiments , show how they can be reduced , and present detailed experimental procedures for conducting casimir - lifshitz force measurements between a metalized sphere and plate separated by fluid .",
    "the setup used for this experiment is shown schematically in fig .  [",
    "fig : expsetup ] and is described in ref .",
    "a 39.8 @xmath0 m diameter polystyrene sphere is attached to a commercially available cantilever ( mikromasch model csc38 ) using silver epoxy .",
    "a 5 nm titanium adhesion layer is evaporated onto the sphere and cantilever followed by a 100 nm gold layer .",
    "the cantilever chip is then inserted into a commercially available atomic force microscope ( afm ) @xcite with fluid chamber . one major difference in this setup over",
    "the one used previously @xcite is the addition of a conductive coating @xcite over the plastic cantilever chip holder ( fig .",
    "[ fig : expsetup ] ) .",
    "this was done to reduce the effect of stray electrostatic fields originating from static charge trapped on the plastic holder .",
    "this is discussed in detail in section iv .",
    "standard cleaning procedures are performed on all surfaces prior to measurements .",
    "the gold plate and fluid cell are ultrasonically cleaned in ethanol for 30 minutes followed by drying in nitrogen airflow .",
    "the cantilever chip is rinsed with ethanol without ultrasonic cleaning to avoid damage to the cantilever .",
    "for all experiments , the cantilever is completely submerged in ethanol ( sigma - aldrich ) , which is filtered through a 0.2 @xmath0 m ptfe filter .",
    "light from a superluminescent diode is reflected off the back of the cantilever and is detected by a four - quadrant photodetector , which is used to monitor the deflection of the cantilever , as in standard afm measurements .",
    "the difference signal between the top two quadrants and the bottom two quadrants is proportional to the vertical deflection of the cantilever .",
    "a piezoelectric column within the afm is used to advance the cantilever and sphere toward the plate , and the piezoelectric column s advance is detected using a linear variable differential transformer @xcite , which minimizes nonlinearities and hysteresis inherent in piezoelectrics . as the sphere approaches the plate , any force between the two will result in a deflection of the cantilever , which will then be detected in the difference signal from the four - quadrant detector .",
    "the sampling rate for data acquisition is chosen so that a minimum of 2 data points per nm are collected and varies from 2 to 8 khz .",
    "the photodetector difference signal is proportional to the distance the cantilever has bent , which obeys hooke s law : @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the distance the tip of the cantilever has bent and @xmath3 is the spring constant of the cantilever .",
    "the external force exerted on the sphere , and hence the cantilever , balances the elastic force @xmath4 and is therefore given by : @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the force constant which is used to convert the photodetector difference signal , @xmath7 , into a force signal . to determine @xmath6",
    ", a known force is applied between the plate and the sphere as the sphere approaches the plate , and @xmath6 is determined from a fit to this force .",
    "in order to average the data collected from consecutive runs ( typically @xmath850 data sets are acquired ) , vertical drift between the sample and the cantilever , which is common in afm measurements @xcite , is compensated by defining the zero of piezo displacement with reference to the surface of the plate as described below . figure  [ fig : alignment](a ) shows the photodetector difference signal versus piezo displacement for two runs with a piezo velocity of 45nm / s .",
    "the scans were performed approximately 1 min apart and show vertical drift , which is typical of all scans . for large piezo displacements , there is no force between the sphere and the plate .",
    "this corresponds to no deflection of the cantilever and @xmath9 . as the sphere approaches the plate , an attractive interaction between the sphere and plate results in a bending of the cantilever until contact is made . at contact , the cantilever is bent . as the piezo column continues to advance , the cantilever unbends ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : alignment](a ) ) .",
    "the point at which the sphere is in contact with the surface and the cantilever is in the unbent state corresponds again to @xmath9 .",
    "we define this contact point between the sphere and the plate , when the cantilever is unbent , to be a piezo displacement of zero .",
    "the experimental points , which were originally offset horizontally by 3 nm , now coincide at the point of contact ( fig .",
    "[ fig : alignment](b ) ) . in this way",
    ", a large number of data sets from different runs can be consistently averaged .",
    "the photodetector difference signal is proportional to the force exerted on the cantilever plus an additional offset , which is linear with piezo displacement but independent of the actual surface separation .",
    "this linear contribution to the signal is due to the relative motion of the cantilever with respect to the laser @xcite .",
    "we can write the total force signal as : @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the casimir - lifshitz force ( and possibly other non - velocity dependent forces , e.g. electrostatic forces as discussed in the next section ) , @xmath12 is the hydrodynamic force , and @xmath13 and @xmath14 are constants .",
    "the hydrodynamic force between a sphere of radius @xmath15 and a plate separated by a distance @xmath16 , in the limit @xmath17 , is given by @xcite : @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the fluid viscosity and @xmath20 is the velocity of the sphere relative to the plate ( the sign of the velocity is taken to be negative as the sphere approaches the plate ) .",
    "the fact that the sphere is attached to a cantilever does not influence this force because the distance between the cantilever and the plate is large compared to the separation between the sphere and the plate .",
    "thus , the hydrodynamic drag on the cantilever results in only a constant offset in the force signal , which does not depend on the surface separation .    the fluid viscosity , @xmath19 , is determined using a falling ball viscometer ( gilmont instruments ) at @xmath21 .",
    "the viscometer is calibrated to the data of ref .@xcite using deionized h@xmath22o . for ethanol , we find @xmath23 by averaging 10 sets of data . for ethanol solutions with salt ( see section iv ) , we find @xmath24 and @xmath25 for nai concentrations of 0.3 mm and 30 mm , respectively .     using the calibration methods described in section iii .",
