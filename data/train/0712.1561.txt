    "the diluted magnetic systems constitute an important field of research in solid - state and statistical physics .",
    "the description of such alloys involves different challenges , starting from the question of the electronic structure of inhomogenous systems lacking translational symmetry through the calculation of exchange interactions between spins and finally to the problem of magnetic ordering .",
    "another issue is the usual difference in the energy scales of magnetic and non - magnetic interactions between the ions in the alloy .",
    "studies of such substances have recently attracted attention owing to the interest in diluted magnetic semiconductors ( dms ) , important from the spintronics point of view .",
    "@xcite    the vital importance of disorder in description of dms has recently been emphasised by numerous theoretical works and stimulated by the experimental data showing the great sensitivity of the critical temperature and magnetic ordering in ga@xmath1mn@xmath2as samples to their treatment even though the concentration of magnetic impurities remains unchanged .",

    ", the effects of magnetic impurity clustering on the critical temperature of a model dms have been investigated ; for instance , by means of mc method in the work of priour and das sarma  @xcite , who found only a weak influence of magnetic ion aggregating on the phase transition . by contrast , bouzerar _ et al . _",
    "@xcite predicted a noticeable increase in curie temperature of the clustered impurities system for ga@xmath1mn@xmath2as and ga@xmath1mn@xmath2n .",

    "@xcite or raebiger _",

    "@xcite    various variants of _ ab initio _ methods , yielding the crystalline , electronic and magnetic structure , are believed to provide reliable estimations of critical temperatures for specific substances ( for example see ref .  ) . at the same time , however , it is difficult to extract from those methods the systematic analysis of the effect of particular factors on the final parameters of the system . here",
    "we see the importance of simplified , schematic models which could be extensively analysed , providing some detailed insight , for instance , into the general features of the influence of the disorder on the magnetic properties .",
    "our aim is to analyze a model diluted magnet with modified rkky interaction , focusing on the importance of structural correlations in distribution of magnetic moments on the lattice .",
    "we improve the virtual crystal approximation by taking into consideration the correlations of pairs and study its effect on the magnetic ground state phase diagrams as well as the critical temperature .",
    "moreover , we introduce a measure of magnetic frustration and discuss its sensivity to structural correlations .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in iind section the theoretical model is described in detail by a statistical - thermodynamical method . in particular ,",
