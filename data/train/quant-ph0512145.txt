    "superconducting quantum circuits can behave like natural atoms and are also promising candidates of qubits for scalable quantum computing.@xcite moreover , these circuits also show quantum optical effects and provide exciting opportunities for demonstrating quantum effects at macroscopic scales and for conducting atomic - physics experiments on a microelectronic chip ( see , e.g. , refs .  ) .",
    "because of its fundamental importance in quantum communications , single - photon sources are crucial in both quantum optics and quantum electronics.@xcite single - photon sources can be achieved using quantum - dot - based devices ( see , e.g. , ref .  ) , but their frequencies are not in the microwave regime required for superconducting qubits .",
    "recently , there have been efforts to generate single photons by coupling a superconducting qubit to a superconducting resonator.@xcite however , because of damping inside the resonator , the generated single photon can only persist for a very short time .",
    "here we show how to persistently produce steady microwave single photons by a _ tunable _ micromaser using a superconducting quantum circuit ( sqc ) .",
    "the physical mechanism is as follows : the sqc acts like a _ controllable _ artificial atom ( aa ) and is placed in a quantum electrodynamic cavity . by taking advantage of the externally controllable state transitions , one can pump the aa to produce state population inversion for the two working levels .",
    "this population inversion is preserved by turning off the transition to the ground state , but when needed this transition can be switched on to generate a photon . within the photon lifetime of the cavity , one can pump the superconducting aa to produce the state population inversion again for the next cycle of operations and then switch on the state transition when the photon generated in the previous cycle is decaying . by periodically repeating this cycle , one can generate single photons in a persistent way .",
    "steady - state photons can also be generated by a micromaser with natural atoms ( see , e.g. , refs .   and ) .",
    "however , in such a micromaser , there is a very small number of excited atoms among all atoms passing through the cavity and these excited atoms enter the cavity at _ random _ times .",
    "this will produce large fluctuations for the photon field of the cavity .",
    "for instance , an excited atom can enter the cavity long before or after the previously generated single photon decays . to overcome this problem ,",
    "a state population inversion is prepared for the superconducting aa in each cycle and all the cycles are repeated periodically .",
    "also , the cavity can be realized using an on - chip superconducting resonator so that both the sqc and the resonator can be fabricated on a chip .",
    "this might be helpful for transferring quantum information between superconducting qubits in future applications .",
    "moreover , in contrast to the fixed difference between the two working energy levels in a natural atom , the level difference for the superconducting aa is tunable , providing flexibility for producing a single - photon source over a wider frequency region .    in ref .",
    ", spontaneous and stimulated emission characteristics was investigated for a josephson - junction - cavity system , but here we focus on the quantum electrodynamic effects in the strong - coupling regime for a superconducting aa in the on - chip cavity .",

    "2(b ) and 2(e ) in this work .",
    "the longer relaxation time is due to a smaller transition matrix element @xmath36 . in fig .",
    "2(e ) , @xmath36 is about @xmath159 , when operating the flux qubit away from the degeneracy point ( e.g. , at @xmath46 ) ; in ref .",
    ", @xmath157 and @xmath36 should be even smaller .    in order to achieve a strong - coupling regime",
    ", we consider the case in figs .",
    "2(c ) and 2(f ) , where @xmath160 and @xmath36 becomes larger than @xmath161 at @xmath46 .",
    "now , @xmath36 increases by more than one order of magnitude .",
    "thus , because the relaxation time is proportional to @xmath162 , the relaxation time should be shortened by two orders of magnitude , from about @xmath156s to about @xmath163  ns . in this case , the strong coupling between the flux qubit and cavity mode can be achieved , but the value of the relaxation time is comparable to the interaction time @xmath164  ns used for emitting a photon in the cavity .",
    "therefore , in our approach , we can use a novel way to change the parameter @xmath165 by replacing the smaller junction with a tunable squid .",
    "only when coupling the flux qubit with the cavity mode , we shift @xmath165 to @xmath160 .",
    "when preparing the states of the flux qubit via realizing and preserving the state population inversion , we shift @xmath165 to a smaller value , where the relaxation time can be long enough , even ( in principle ) arbitrarily long ( in practice , it will not be infinitely long , but far longer than currently reachable ) .",
    "more importantly , we show that the process of changing @xmath165 can be simultaneously adiabatic ( so the state changes along the eigenstate ) and fast enough ( compared to the interaction time ) .",
    "this reveals its enhanced level of control and experimental feasibility .      in our proposal , the circuit design not only can either enhance or reduce the relaxation time for the transition from @xmath73 to @xmath72 , but can also switch on and off this transition by changing the externally applied magnetic flux inside the squid loop . in particular",
    ", a state population inversion can be created via the third level and preserved for a long time . moreover , when needed for generating a single photon , the sqc can be  turned on \" , by changing an externally applied magnetic flux , to strongly couple to the cavity mode .",
    "these properties show that the circuit design provides an enhanced level of control , as compared with ordinary two - level systems .",
    "if one wants to just observe the fundamental vacuum rabi oscillations , it is suitable to manipulate only the two lowest levels of the sqc . however ,",
    "when applied to the micromaser proposed here , it is very disadvantageous to only access the two lowest levels , since it is hard to maintain a state population inversion with only these two levels .",
    "if one uses the two lowest levels of the sqc , in order to strongly couple the sqc to the cavity mode , the resonance point should be near the degeneracy point of the sqc , where the transition between @xmath73 and @xmath72 is the strongest . as shown in ref .",
    ", one can first operate the sqc far from the resonance point and prepare it in the excited state @xmath73 by employing a @xmath166 pulse . then",
    ", the @xmath166 pulse is followed by a shift pulse , which brings the system into resonance with the cavity mode .",
    "it is required that the process for shifting the qubit from the operating point to the resonance point is adiabatic , so as to still keep the qubit at the eigenstate @xmath73 after this shifting process .",
    "therefore , due to the qubit - oscillation coupling , the excitation can be transferred to the cavity , resulting in a single photon . however",
    ", this does not occur ideally . as shown in fig .",
    "3(a ) , the quantity @xmath44 increases drastically when the reduced flux @xmath11 approaches the degeneracy point @xmath35 .",
    "this means that the process for shiting the qubit from the operating point to the resonance point should be very slow ( especially when approaching the resonance point ) to keep it adiabatic .",
    "if so , a problem arises because of the strong relaxation from @xmath73 to @xmath72 around the resonance point , greatly reducing the probability of the single photon in the cavity .",
    "alternatively , one might consider using a nonadiabatic process to fast shift the flux qubit from the operating point to the resonance point .",
    "however , at the resonance point , the qubit state is not anymore the target eigenstate @xmath73 , but instead a superposition state of @xmath73 and @xmath72 .",
    "this is problematic , also because it reduces the single - photon probability .",
    "however , as we have already shown , no such problems should occur in our proposal using three levels , because of the greatly enhanced level of control available when using three levels and controlling the @xmath167 transition strenght via the magnetic flux inside the squid loop .      a theoretical work in ref .",
    "considered a @xmath168-type three - level system , where _ no _",
    "transition occurs between the lowest two levels , but transitions are allowed between the other levels . together with the lowest two levels , the third level is used to indirectly achieve a one - qubit gate for the lowest two levels ( i.e. , the qubit levels ) .",
    "in that work , the circuit considered is an rf - squid consisting of a loop with one josephson junction .",
    "it is known that this can be used as a flux qubit , but it requires a relatively large loop inductance to produce a two - well potential .",
    "this makes the rf - squid more susceptible to flux noise .",
    "another theoretical work in ref .",
    "used the idea in ref .   to further show that a complete set of one - qubit gates could be achieved .",

    ", the lowest three levels of the circuit design in our approach can form a @xmath169-type three - level system , when operating away from the degeneracy point .",
    "most importantly , the transitions , particularly the transition between the lowest two levels can be _ tuned _ at will by simply changing the parameter @xmath165 via the magnetic flux inside the squid loop .",
    "therefore , this circuit can prepare and preserve the state population inversion between the lowest two levels , and can also trigger a strong transition between these two levels .",
    "moreover , these processes provide an enhanced level of control and can be manipulated both adiabatically and fast enough .",
    "these remarkable properties do not exist in the system considered in refs .   and .",
    "we have proposed a tunable on - chip micromaser using a sqc .",

    "<S> a state population inversion can be achieved and preserved for the two working levels of the sqc and , when needed , the sqc can generate a single photon . </S>",
    "<S> we can regularly repeat these processes in each cycle when the previously generated photon in the cavity is decaying , so that a periodic sequence of single photons can be produced persistently . </S>",
