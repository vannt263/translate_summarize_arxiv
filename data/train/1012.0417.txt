    "cosmology provides a set of interesting models in which similar dynamics occur  @xcite .",
    "still , the decay of vortex density in freely decaying turbulence has also been of interest  @xcite . in all these areas , there is considerable interest in the dynamics of defects once the phase transition has been crossed .    of special interest is the planar time - dependent ginzburg landau model with so(2 ) symmetry or its lattice counterpart the @xmath0 xy model .",
    "a static phase transition occurs at a finite critical temperature , @xmath1 , between a high-@xmath2 disordered paramagnet and a low-@xmath2 ferromagnetic phase with quasi - long range order . when the model is quenched from the high to the low temperature phase the continuous symmetry of the disordered phase",
    "is broken to the one of the ordered phase . in these systems",
    "the defects are singular vortices that carry topological charge and have logarithmic interactions . in the high-@xmath2 phase",

    "physical realizations are bidimensional planar ferromagnets  @xcite , superconducting films  @xcite , josephson - junction arrays  @xcite , especially tailored nematic liquid crystals  @xcite , and toy models for bidimensional turbulence  @xcite",
    ". the exponential singularity may also describe the critical properties of superfluid helium films  @xcite .",
    "phase ordering kinetics following an infinitely rapid quench through a thermal critical point have been extensively studied in the statistical physics literature  @xcite . in condensed matter applications the time spent close to the critical point is typically much shorter than the time spent far from it and ,",
    "therefore , the infinitely fast quench approximation is justified . a few studies where cooling rate dependencies have been taken into account are  @xcite .",
    "the study of cooling - rate dependencies in defect dynamics is , instead , central in cosmology .",
    "the goal in this case is to estimate the density of defects , @xmath3 , left over in the universe after it went through a number of potential ( second - order ) phase transitions .",
    "the importance lies on the fact that , initially , these were thought to act as seeds for matter clustering .",
    "this scenario seems to be excluded by observation data now but , still , the interest in predicting the density of topological defects remains due to other possible effects of these objects  @xcite . in the late 80s zurek derived a quantitative prediction for @xmath3 that is based on critical scaling in the disordered phase close to a second order phase transition .",
    "the proposal is based upon the hypothesis whereby the defect dynamics should be negligible below the transition . in consequence , @xmath3 is assumed to remain fixed to the value it takes at the control parameter at which the system falls out of equilibrium in the disordered phase . in his articles",
    "zurek proposed to check these predictions in condensed matter systems with the same symmetry properties as the cosmological models  @xcite .",
    "a vast experimental  @xcite and numerical  @xcite activity followed with variable results summarized in  @xcite .",
    "the fact that the annihilation of defects can be neglected in the out of equilibrium regime was questioned in  @xcite . in this paper , a scaling argument that includes the mechanism of defect annihilation in the low - temperature phase for systems with second - order phase transitions and dissipative dynamics was proposed .",
    "a scaling of the density of defects with cooling rate _ and _ time spent in the out of equilibrium evolution was derived .",

    "similar ideas about the importance of the dynamics below the transition were stressed in  @xcite .",
    "the treatment of all cases mentioned in the previous paragraph is classical . recently , pushed by the advent of powerful experimental techniques in cold atom systems , the extension of the kibble - zurek mechanism to quantum _ isolated _ systems was developed  @xcite .",
    "these claims have been critically revisited in  @xcite , as reviewed in  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we examine the density of vortices left over after going through the berezinskii - kosterlitz - thouless classical phase transition  @xcite with a finite speed .",
    "we revisit the kibble - zurek mechanism and we provide a theory of quenching rate dependence in systems with continuous symmetry and the bkt - type of ` infinite - order ' phase transition that goes beyond the equilibrium scaling arguments .",
    "we test it with a monte carlo numerical study of the @xmath0 xy model on a square lattice .",
    "we work in the canonical setting , in the sense that the system is coupled to an equilibrium environment that allows for energy dissipation . as a control parameter driving the phase transition we use the temperature of the heat - bath .",
    "for concreteness we use linear cooling procedures , characterized by a single parameter , the cooling rate . a previous numerical study of this problem with a different method that ignores the effects of free - vortices appeared in  @xcite .",

    "this fact is the reason for the failure of dynamic scaling when the length determined from the decay of the total density of vortices was used  @xcite .",
    "next , we studied cooling rate dependencies , we proposed a scaling form for the growing length under these circumstances , and we checked it numerically .",
    "we found that the density of free topological defects not only depends on the cooling rate used but does also on the time spent in the low temperature phase , where vortices and anti - vortices tend to bind or annihilate .",
