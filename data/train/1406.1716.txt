    "during the past decades , solutions of wave equations in relativistic and non - relativistic quantum mechanics have received great attention .",
    "whether in the relativistic or non - relativistic regimes , the exact solutions are only possible for some special cases of interactions due to the inverse square centrifugal term appearing in the realistic three - dimensional space .",
    "therefore , for many potential models one has to use some approximations for the centrifugal term . among these approximations",
    ", the frequently used pekeris approximation @xcite introduces an exponential approximation to the centrifugal barrier .",
    "the tw diatomic molecular potential is one of those potentials which can not be exactly solved .",
    "this potential was proposed as an intermolecular potential and is one of the best potential models considered to describe the vibrational energy of diatomic molecules @xcite .    in one of the interesting works of gordillo - vizquez and kunc @xcite , they derived radial probability distributions of diatomic molecules in excited rotational - vibrational states using the bohr - sommerfeld quantization rule and the hamilton - jacoby theory .",
    "they compared the obtained semiclassical distributions for the rotating morse and tw oscillators , in a broad range of rotational and vibrational quantum numbers , with one another and with quantum - mechanical distributions obtained from numerical solution of the schrdinger equation using a rydberg - klein - rees ( rkr ) potential . in the recent years",
    ", hamzavi et al @xcite have presented energy eigenvalues and corresponding eigenfunctions in closed form .",
    "the authors present some remarks and numerical results for some diatomic molecules . shortly thereafter",
    ", the bound state solutions of the relativistic klein - gordon equation with the tw diatomic molecular potential have been presented for the s wave by sun and dong @xcite .",
    "it is shown that the solutions can be expressed by the generalized hypergeometric functions .",
    "apart from the works done on tw diatomic molecular potential , many authors have solved the schrdinger equation in various potential fields @xcite-@xcite . despite all several worthy attempt in solving schrdinger equation with several model potentials ,",
    "the basic information - theoretic quantities remain to be computed .",
    "this is because of the lack of knowledge in the information - theoretic properties of special functions . in this paper ,",
    "our aim is to solve the nonrelativistic schrdinger equations under the tw diatomic molecular potential by via the aim , by considering the pekeris approximation .",
    "we have also calculated some expectation values corresponding to the tw diatomic molecular potential using the hellmann - feynman theorem .",
    "we proceed further to study the tw diatomic molecular potential within the framework of relativistic klein - gordon and dirac equation .",
    "it is worth to be noted that the klein - gordon equation correctly describes the spinless pion .",
    "the dirac equation provided a description of elementary spin-1/2 particles , such as electrons , consistent with both the principles of quantum mechanics and the theory of special relativity , and made relativistic corrections to quantum mechanics @xcite .",
    "these relativistic equations have received a lot of interest from several authors in both theoretical physics , nuclear physics and related areas . in this study , these relativistic equations with tw diatomic molecular potential shall be studied extensively .    furthermore , the probability distributions are analyzed by means of complementary information measures of a probability distribution called as the fishers information entropy . given a normalized - to - unity ( probability ) density @xmath4 on @xmath5",
    ", we can define several functions of @xmath4 measuring the uncertainty or information content associated with this density .",
    "thus , fisher s information is a derivative functional of the density , so that it is very sensitive to local rearrangements of @xmath4 .",
    "applications to a large variety of problems in theoretical physics have received a strong impulse when it was realized that the spatial distribution of the single - particle probability density @xmath6 of a many - particle system , which is the basic variable of the density functional theory @xcite can be quantitatively measured by its translationally invariant fisher information in a different and complementary manner as the shannon entropy .",
    "both quantities characterize the information theoretic content of the density @xmath6 which describes the physical state under consideration @xcite .",
    "the fisher information has been used in present study to analyze probability distribution of the approximate solution obtained for the tw diatomic molecular potential .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows : in the next section we briefly introduce faa , susyqm and aim . in section [ sec3 ] , the non - relativistic solutions of schrdinger equation with the tw diatomic molecular potential",
    "are presented and some expectation values are reported .",
    "we have obtained the energy eigenvalues and the wave functions of the klein - gordon and dirac equations in section [ sec4 ] .",
    "information - theoretic measures for tw diatomic molecular potential is given in section [ sec5 ] .",
    "section [ sec6 ] present the numerical discussions and finally , our conclusion is given in section [ sec3 ] .",
    "in quantum mechanics , while solving relativistic and nonrelativistic wave equation in the presence of some typical central or non central potential model , we do often come across differential equation of the form @xmath7 after which an appropriate coordinate transformation of the form @xmath8 has been used . in other to find energy eigenvalues and the wavefunction ( eigensolution ) of the second - order homogeneous linear differential equations of the above form , there have been several eigensolution techniques developed to exactly solve the quantum systems .",
    "some of this techniques include the aim @xcite-@xcite , feynman integral formalism @xcite , faa@xcite , exact quantization rule method @xcite , proper quantization rule @xcite , nikiforov - uvarov ( nu ) method @xcite , susyqm @xcite , the ansatz method @xcite , etc .",
    "the beauty about these techniques is that when they are apply to solve equation of the form ( [ e1 ] ) , they yield exactly the same eigensolution results , despite the fact that the calculation approaches varies from one technique to the other . in this work",
    "we focus our attention unto three of these techniques : faa , susyqm and aim .",
    "we apply aim to find the eigensolution of nonrelativistic schrdinger equation .",
    "furthermore , the eigensolutions of the relativistic klein - gordon and dirac equations are obtain via faa and susyqm respectively .",
    "we have demonstrated that the three techniques yield exactly the same results .",
    "faa also called the traditional method by some authors has been introduced for solving equation of the form ( [ e1 ] ) ever since the birth of quantum mechanics . in the approach , one transform the equation of form ( [ e1 ] ) to a form of hypergeometric equation @xmath9 via an appropriate transformation by considering the singularity points of the differential equation within the framework of the frebenius theorem .",
    "the eigensolutions are obtained from the properties of the hypergeometric functions on the condition that the series @xmath9 approaches infinity unless @xmath10 is a negative integer ( i.e @xmath11 ) .",
    "this method have been employed by alot of researchers to obtain eigensolution of quantum mechanical problems in both relativistic and non relativistic case @xcite    for some decades ago , the ideas of susyqm have been applied to alot of quantum mechanical problems ( both in the relativistic and nonrelativistic case ) . in 1982 , path integral formulation of susyqm was first given by salomonson and van holten @xcite . there after , by using susy methods , some authors reveal that the tunneling rate through double well barriers could be accurately determined @xcite . in the recent years , there has been alot of efforts to extend the ideas of susyqm to higher dimensional systems as well as to systems with large numbers of particles with a motivation of understanding the potential problems of widespread interest in nuclear , atomic , statistical and condensed matter physics @xcite .",
    "the concept of shape invariant potential was introduced within the framework of susyqm in 1983 by gendenshtein @xcite .",
    "gendenshtein shows that for any shape invariant potential , the energy eigenvalue spectra could be obtained algebraically .",
    "very recently , the bound - state spectra for some potentials with unbroken and broken supersymmetry are investigated by the quantization condition of aim @xcite .    the asymptotic iteration method ( aim ) to find eigensolution of equation of the form ( [ e1 ] ) was introduced by ciftci et al .",
    "@xcite in 2003 and 2005 .",
    "ever since then , it has been used in many physical systems to obtain the whole spectra [ 29 - 50 ] .",
    "the beauty about the method is that it reproduces exact solutions of many exactly solvable quantum systems and also gives accurate result for the non solvable potentials such as sextic oscillator , deformed coulomb potential , etc .    in the subsequent sections , we apply these three techniques to solve various quantum mechanical problems and shows that they yield exactly same results .",
    "it is well known that exact solutions play an important role in quantum mechanics since they contain all the necessary information regarding the quantum system under consideration . in this section",
    "we obtain the bound states solution of the schrdinger equation for the tw diatomic molecular potential . for this purpose",
    "we write the schrdinger equation in three dimension as @xmath12+v(r)-e\\right\\}\\psi(r,\\theta,\\phi)=0 , \\label{e2}\\ ] ] where @xmath13 and @xmath14 denote the radial and orbital angular momentum quantum numbers , @xmath15 is the internuclear separation of the diatomic molecules , and @xmath16 is the bound - state energy eigenvalues . the @xmath17 and @xmath18 represent the reduced mass and interaction potential respectively . by taking @xmath19 , we can separate the above schrdinger equation via the variable separable technique .",

    "these molecules are @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 in table ( [ tab3 ] ) and @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 in table ( [ tab4 ] ) . for the mentioned diatomic molecules , expectation values of @xmath281 , @xmath282 , @xmath283 , @xmath284 , @xmath285 are represented in tables ( [ tab5 ] ) and ( [ tab6 ] ) .",
    "we have shown the behavior of the energy of non - relativistic limit of tw potential as a function of @xmath23 , @xmath17 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 in figures ( [ fig2]-[fig6 ] ) .",

    "( [ tab7 ] ) , we can deduce that there are degeneracies between the eigenstates ( @xmath286 , @xmath287 ) , ( @xmath288 , @xmath289 ) , ( @xmath290 , @xmath291 ) , ( @xmath292 , @xmath293 ) , etc .",
    "it is worth mentioning that each of these eigenstates form a spin doublet .",

    "@xmath303 with @xmath304 is considered as the partner of @xmath305 with @xmath306 .",
    "thus , states that have pseudo orbital angular momentum @xmath167 quantum numbers , radial @xmath13 and @xmath307 with @xmath308 and @xmath309 , respectively , are degenerate .",
    "in this paper , we have shown the beauty about eigensolution techniques via an approximate bound state solutions of the schrdinger , klein - gordon and dirac equations for tw diatomic molecular potential .",
    "for each type of wave equations and by applying an approximation to the centrifugal term , we obtained the energy eigenvalues and the corresponding wave functions for any quantum state .",
    "for further guide to interested readers , we provided some numerical data and figures , which discuss the energy spectrum in each case .",
    "the probability distributions of tw diatomic molecular potential were also analyzed .",
