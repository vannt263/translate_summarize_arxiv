    "turbulent rayleigh - b ' enard convection ( rbc ) , the paradigm for studies in convective turbulence , remains a fascinating unresolved puzzle  @xcite . for a century , theories of turbulent rbc have focused on understanding the globally averaged heat transport through a layer of fluid .",
    "the development of models has been largely driven by improved experimental measurements of the heat current , which have time and again revealed unexplained discrepancies between experiment and theory . in response ,",
    "mathematical models have become increasingly sophisticated during the last five decades  @xcite . in recent years , ambitious experimental , theoretical and computational projects",
    "have been undertaken and the study of turbulent rbc has been considerably reinvigorated  @xcite .",
    "all this activity suggests some clear directions for future work .",
    "two recent experiments highlighted the crucial role of the system shape and lateral extent  @xcite . in this paper , we exploit the unique features of a system closely analogous to rbc , electrically driven convection in a thin annular film , to shed light on these features of turbulent convection .",
    "turbulent rbc is described phenomenologically in terms of several organizing structures which are experimentally observed .",
    "the convecting fluid has sharp thermal boundary layers at its top and bottom surfaces .",
    "plumes grow erratically from these surfaces and spontaneously organize into a noisy but coherent wind . this large scale circulation ( lsc ) , or turbulent wind , advects the plumes so that hot thermals rise along a laterally bounding wall while cold plumes sink along the diametrically opposite wall .",
    "the interior of the cell away from the lsc is typically assumed to be well - mixed , isotropic and homogeneous .",
    "this picture is partially corroborated by measurements using containers with approximately equal height and breadth . the extent to which this phenomenological picture , particularly of the lsc , is geometry and shape dependent is currently the most pressing question in the study of turbulent rbc .",
    "the aspect ratio @xmath5 , which is the ratio of the horizontal span to the vertical separation of an rbc apparatus , quantifies the geometry .",
    "it is important to perform experimental studies with a wide range of @xmath5 .",
    "these have been difficult to accomplish however , due to practical considerations .",
    "the requirement of strong forcing , which favors large vertical separation , is opposed by the constraint that the apparatus remain a manageable laboratory size , limiting its horizontal span .",

    "an applied electric potential difference between the inner and outer electrodes drives an electric current through the film .",
    "surface charges accumulate on the two free surfaces that separate the electrically conducting film from charge - free space .",
    "this inverted surface charge density is unstable to electric forcing in much the same manner as the inverted mass density distribution of rbc is unstable to buoyancy forces . when the applied voltage @xmath7 exceeds the critical voltage @xmath8 , the fluid is organized into convection vortices as shown in fig .",

    "finally , gl theory derives the dependence of @xmath0 on @xmath10 and @xmath11 by balancing the exact formulations for the total dissipations versus the dominant contributions from the bulk and/or boundary layer .",
