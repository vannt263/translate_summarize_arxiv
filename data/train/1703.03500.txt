    "all graphs in this paper are considered to be finite and simple .",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite for basic terminology and notation . in particular , we use @xmath10 and @xmath11 to denote the path and cycle on @xmath1 vertices , respectively .",
    "a graph is a _ cograph _ if it is @xmath0-free .",
    "a _ polar partition _ of a graph @xmath2 is a partition of the vertices of @xmath2 into parts @xmath3 and @xmath4 in such a way that the subgraph induced by @xmath3 is a complete multipartite graph and the subgraph induced by @xmath4 is a disjoint union of cliques , with no other edges . a graph @xmath2 is _ polar _ , if it admits a polar partition , and is @xmath12_-polar _ if it admits a polar partition @xmath13 in which @xmath3 has at most @xmath14 parts and @xmath4 at most @xmath1 parts . in particular ,",
    "when @xmath15 , we use the term @xmath1_-polar partition _ and @xmath1_-polar graph_. note that @xmath6-polar graphs are precisely split graphs .",
    "it was shown by foldes and hammer @xcite that a graph is split if and only if it does not contain @xmath16 or @xmath17 as an induced subgraph ; as a consequence , testing whether a given graph is split can be done in polynomial time .",
    "the concept of a matrix partition unifies many interesting graph partition problems , including @xmath12-partition . given a symmetric @xmath18 matrix @xmath19 , with entries in @xmath20 ,",
    "an @xmath19-_partition _ of a graph @xmath2 is a partition @xmath21 of @xmath22 such that , for every @xmath23 ,    * @xmath24 is completely adjacent to @xmath25 if @xmath26 , * @xmath24 is completely non - adjacent to @xmath25 if @xmath27 , * there are no restrictions if @xmath28 .",
    "it follows from the definition that , in particular , if @xmath29 ( @xmath30 ) , then @xmath24 is a stable set ( @xmath24 is a clique )",
    ". the @xmath19-_partition problem _ asks whether or not an input graph @xmath2 admits an @xmath19-partition .",
    "it is easy to verify that , e.g. , the @xmath1-colouring and split partition problems are matrix partition problems .",
    "see @xcite for a survey on the subject .",
    "it is also easy to see that an @xmath12-partition of @xmath2 is a matrix partition in which the matrix @xmath19 has @xmath31 rows and columns , the principal submatrix induced by the first @xmath14 rows is obtained from an identity matrix by exchanging @xmath32 s and @xmath6 s , the principal submatrix induced by the last @xmath1 rows is an identity matrix , and all other entries are @xmath33 .",
    "therefore , it follows from @xcite ( as explicitely observed in @xcite ) , that for any fixed @xmath14 and @xmath1 , the class of @xmath12-polar graphs can be recognized in polynomial time . on the other hand ,",
    "it was shown by chernyak and chernyak @xcite that the recognition of general polar graphs is @xmath34-complete .",
    "interestingly , the class of polar graphs that admit an @xmath12-partition with @xmath35 or @xmath5 ( sometimes called _ monopolar graphs _ ) , is also @xmath34-complete to recognize ( as proved by farrugia @xcite ) .",
    "it was shown recently that this remains true even in severely restricted graph classes , for instance le and nevries @xcite have shown that both @xmath34-completeness results hold for triangle - free planar graphs of maximum degree @xmath36 .",
    "notice that having an @xmath19-partition is a hereditary property , and hence , the family of @xmath19-partitionable graphs admits a characterization in terms of forbidden induced subgraphs .",
    "a minimal @xmath19_-obstruction _ is a graph which does not admit an @xmath19-partition , but such that every proper induced subgraph does .",
    "feder , hell and hochstttler proved in @xcite that , for any matrix @xmath19 , there are only finitely many minimal @xmath19-obstructions which are cographs .",
    "( this can also be derived from @xcite . ) in other words , when we restrict the @xmath19-partition problem to the class of cographs , there are only finitely minimal @xmath19-obstructions , and , consequently , any @xmath19-partition problem is solvable in polynomial time for cographs .",
    "thus , in particular , for any @xmath14 and @xmath1 , there are only finitely many minimal @xmath12-polar obstructions that are cographs . for @xmath37 ,",
    "an explicit list follows from the result of foldes and hammer mentioned above : only @xmath38 and its complement ( @xmath39 ) are cograph minimal @xmath6-polar obstructions . in this paper",
    "we provide a compact description of cograph minimal @xmath8-polar obstructions .",
    "we believe the ideas generated might yield at least some kind of description of all cograph minimal @xmath12-polar obstructions , and thus for a fairly wide class of matrix partition problems .",
    "moreover , we believe that knowing the minimal obstructions might lead to a certifying algorithm for the recognition of these graphs .",
    "it is worth noticing that ekim , mahadev and de werra proved in @xcite that it is possible to recognize polar and monopolar graphs in polynomial time in the class of cographs .",
    "moreover , they proved that there are only finitely many cograph minimal polar obstructions ( eight ) , and cograph minimal monopolar obstructions ( eighteen ) . in the same paper , they propose the problem of finding a characterization of @xmath8-polar cographs by forbidden subgraphs as a natural continuation of their work",
    ".    we will denote the complement of @xmath2 by @xmath40 .",
    "cographs can be characterized as those graphs @xmath2 such that they are either trivial , or one of @xmath2 or @xmath40 is disconnected , and its components are cographs .",
    "it follows from this characterization that if @xmath2 is a cograph , then so is @xmath40 .",
    "observe that @xmath2 is a @xmath1-polar cograph if and only if @xmath40 is a @xmath1-polar cograph as well .",
    "therefore , if @xmath41 is a cograph that is a minimal @xmath1-polar obstruction then so is @xmath42 .",
    "hence , we can focus our attention in disconnected cograph minimal @xmath1-polar obstructions @xmath41 .",
    "we denote the components of @xmath41 by @xmath43 .",
    "we say that a component of @xmath41 is _ trivial _ or an _ isolated vertex _ if it is isomorphic to @xmath44 .    given graphs @xmath2 and @xmath41 , the disjoint union of @xmath2 and @xmath41 is denoted by @xmath45 , and the join of @xmath2 and @xmath41 is denoted by @xmath46 .",

    "] , we present our conclusions and future lines of research .",
    "a minimal @xmath1-polar obstruction is _ extremal _ if it has exactly @xmath48 vertices ; the reason for this name will be clear from theorem [ upper ] in section [ sec : main ] .",
    "our first lemma states the possible number of components of a minimal @xmath1-obstruction , as well as some general facts about their structure .",
    "there is one argument that we will be using in many of our proofs .",
    "let @xmath41 be a minimal @xmath1-polar obstruction , and let @xmath49 be a vertex in @xmath41 .",
    "thus , @xmath50 has a @xmath1-polar partition @xmath51 .",
    "we will assume that @xmath52 induces a multipartite graph with parts @xmath53 .",
    "notice that , if at least two of these parts are non - empty , then all the vertices in @xmath3 are contained in a single component of @xmath50 .",
    "otherwise , either @xmath3 is empty , or only one of its parts is non - empty , but , since these two cases can be usually handled in a very similar way , we will often assume without loss of generality that one of these parts is non - empty .",
    "[ kp - genres ] let @xmath41 be a minimal @xmath1-polar obstruction .",
    "the following statements are true :    1 .",
    "@xmath41 has at most @xmath54 components ; 2 .",
    "@xmath41 has at least one non trivial component ; 3 .",
    "@xmath41 has at most @xmath55 trivial components ; 4 .   if @xmath41 has at least one trivial component , then @xmath41 has at most one non - complete component .",

    "_ , suppose , by contradiction , that @xmath41 has more than @xmath54 components . if there are isolated vertices in @xmath41 , consider @xmath49 , one of them .",
    "thus , @xmath57 has at least @xmath54 components , and by the minimality of @xmath41 , it has a @xmath1-polar partition @xmath58 .",
    "if there is a unique non empty stable set in this partition , then we can assume without loss of generality that this set is @xmath59 , and hence , @xmath60 is a @xmath1-polar partition of @xmath41 , a contradiction .",
    "thus , the subgraph induced by @xmath61 is connected , and hence contained in a single component of @xmath57 .",
    "but in this case , the rest of the @xmath55 components should be covered by @xmath1 cliques , which is impossible .    if there are no isolated vertices in @xmath41 , consider any vertex @xmath49 of @xmath41 .",
    "let @xmath62 be a @xmath1-polar partition of @xmath57 . note that @xmath57 has at least @xmath63 components of which at least @xmath54 are not trivial .",

    "since a @xmath1-polar partition @xmath67 of @xmath57 has necessarily two non - empty stable sets ( otherwise , if we add @xmath49 to the unique non - empty stable set of @xmath68 , or to any stable set of @xmath68 if all of them are empty , we would obtain a @xmath1-partition of @xmath41 , a contradiction ) , and @xmath65 and @xmath66 can not be covered only by cliques , @xmath61 belongs to one of @xmath65 or @xmath66 , let us say , @xmath65 .",
    "now , @xmath66 can not be covered only by cliques , since it is connected .",
    "but it also has no vertex belonging to @xmath69 . by consequence",

    "thus , @xmath74 , with @xmath75 for @xmath76 , else , we could place @xmath49 in one of the empty stable sets to obtain a @xmath1-polar partition of @xmath41 , a contradiction .",
    "now , all the other components of @xmath41 have to be complete , and can not have less than @xmath55 vertices , otherwise by covering @xmath65 by a clique and any smaller clique by @xmath1 completely adjacent stable sets would lead to a @xmath1-partition of @xmath41 , a contradiction . as a conclusion ,",
    "every other component is a complete graph with at least @xmath55 vertices and there are at least @xmath55 components , otherwise @xmath41 would be @xmath1-polar .",

    "let @xmath49 be an isolated vertex of @xmath41 .",
    "the graph @xmath57 admits a @xmath1-polar partition @xmath81 , such that , at least two of the stable sets are non - empty .",
    "otherwise , if we add @xmath49 to the only non - empty stable set of @xmath68 ( if any , otherwise place @xmath49 in @xmath59 ) , then the resulting partition would be a @xmath1-polar partition for @xmath41 .",
    "thus , all the stable sets of @xmath68 are contained in the same component of @xmath57 .",
    "now , the remaining @xmath1 components of @xmath57 should be covered by the @xmath1 cliques in @xmath68 . but",
    "this means that the component containing the stable sets of @xmath68 is a complete multipartite graph .",
    "thus , @xmath41 is the disjoint union of @xmath82 , @xmath83 non - trivial cliques , and a complete @xmath84-partite graph @xmath85 , with @xmath86 .",
    "now , let @xmath87 be a vertex in @xmath85 .",
    "again , @xmath88 has a @xmath1-polar partition @xmath89 .",
    "since @xmath88 has at least @xmath54 components , and the cliques of @xmath90 can cover at most @xmath1 different components , it must be the case that only one of the stable sets of @xmath90 is non - empty , say @xmath91 , and contains all the isolated vertices of @xmath41 .",
    "hence , @xmath92 must be a disjoint union of complete graphs , because it should be covered by the cliques of @xmath90 . but",
    "this means that @xmath93 is an independent set with at most @xmath94 vertices .",
    "thus , @xmath85 is a complete bipartite graph .",
    "it is easy to observe that if @xmath85 is smaller than @xmath95 , then @xmath41 admits a @xmath1-polar partition .",
    "finally , it follows from lemma [ kp - genres ] that the remaining @xmath83 non - trivial complete components are copies of @xmath56 .    for the final statement , it is easy to verify that @xmath96 is a minimal @xmath1-polar obstruction .",
    "thus , any graph with @xmath54 non - trivial components properly contains this obstruction .",
    "as we have mentioned in the introduction , @xmath1-polar cographs are a very convenient class of @xmath97-polar cographs in terms of forbidden induced subgraph characterization ; in order to find all the cograph minimal @xmath1-polar obstructions , it suffices to find only the disconnected ones .",
    "the family of @xmath8-polar cographs enjoys an additional property not shared by @xmath1-polar cographs with @xmath9 .",
    "specifically , there are two very natural operations preserving the @xmath8-polarity of a graph , which lead to a much more compact list of minimal obstructions , cf . theorem [ reducedobs ] .    given a graph @xmath41 and one of its vertices @xmath49",
    ", a graph @xmath98 can be obtained from @xmath41 by a _ switching _ on @xmath49 , that is , by making @xmath99 , while the rest of the graph remains unaltered . a _ partial complement _ of @xmath41",
    "is a graph obtained by splitting the components of @xmath41 into two graphs , @xmath98 and @xmath100 , and taking separately the complement of each of them .",
    "notice that if @xmath41 is connected , then one of @xmath98 or @xmath100 is empty , and the other one is @xmath41 ; in this case , the partial complement coincides with the complement .",
    "observe that a disconnected graph @xmath41 with three or more components has several different ways of taking partial complementation , but , as long as both @xmath98 and @xmath100 are non - empty the resulting graph will always be disconnected .",
    "notice that partial complementation can be defined in terms of switching and regular complementation in the following way .",
    "consider a disconnected graph @xmath41 , and split its components into two graphs @xmath98 and @xmath100 .",
    "now , perform switches on every vertex of @xmath98 ( this will leave us with a graph which has the same edges as @xmath41 , plus all the edges between @xmath98 and @xmath100 ) , and then , take the complement of the resulting graph .",
    "clearly , this procedure yields the same result as taking a partial complement with @xmath98 and @xmath100 .",
    "[ switch - pc ] if @xmath41 is a @xmath8-polar graph , and @xmath49 is a vertex in @xmath41 , then the graph obtained from @xmath41 by switching on @xmath49 is also @xmath8-polar .",
    "if additionally @xmath41 is a disconnected cograph , then any partial complement of @xmath41 is again a disconnected @xmath8-polar cograph .",
    "let @xmath101 be a @xmath8-polar partition of @xmath41 .",
    "we will assume that @xmath102 , the remaining cases can be dealt similarly .",
    "since @xmath103 induces a complete bipartite graph ( where @xmath104 is possibly empty ) , @xmath49 is adjacent to every vertex in @xmath104 and non - adjacent to every vertex in @xmath59 .",
    "thus , after switching on @xmath49 , it is clear that @xmath105 is a @xmath8-polar partition of the resulting graph .    for the second statement , split the components of @xmath41 into @xmath98 and @xmath100 . from the remark previous to this lemma , and the previous paragraph ,",
    "it is clear that taking the partial complement of @xmath41 with @xmath98 and @xmath100 yields a @xmath8-polar graph . since @xmath41 is a cograph , @xmath98 and @xmath100",
    "are also cographs , as well as their complements .",
    "thus , the partial complement of @xmath41 is a disjoint union of cographs , which is again a disconnected cograph .",
    "since in general switching does not preserve the property of being a cograph , but partial complementation does , we will restrict ourselves to the use of the latter .",
    "it follows from lemma [ switch - pc ] that if @xmath41 is a cograph minimal @xmath8-polar obstruction , then any partial complement of @xmath41 is also a cograph minimal @xmath8-polar obstruction . since partial complements are reversible",
    ", if we define two graphs to be related if one can be obtained by a sequence of partial complementations from the other , then this defines an equivalence relation .",
    "in particular , it follows by the previous remark that the family of cograph minimal @xmath8-polar obstructions admits a partition into equivalence classes under this relation .",
    "let @xmath106 and @xmath107 be the families of graphs depicted in figures [ ( 2,2)-obs7 ] , [ ( 2,2)-obs9 ] , [ ( 2,2)-obs8a ] , and [ ( 2,2)-obs8b ] , respectively , and together with their respective complements .",
    "[ closure ] the families @xmath108 and @xmath107 are families of cograph minimal @xmath8-polar obstructions closed under partial complementation .    it is a simple exercise to verify that each of the depicted graphs is a cograph minimal @xmath8-polar cograph , and , although it takes a while , it is simple as well to verify that every possible partial complement of every member of each of the families , belongs again to the same family .",
    "we will mention how to obtain the rest of the disconnected members of @xmath109 by a sequence of partial complementations from @xmath110 , the rest of the families can be dealt in a similar way .",
