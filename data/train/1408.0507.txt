    "the rate of heat released in the left ( right ) electrode with electrochemical potential @xmath61 is given by @xmath62 using eq .",
    "( 17 ) and ( 18 ) we obtain the rate of heat dissipated in left and right electrodes as @xmath63 thus total power ( heat per unit of time ) dissipated in the system is @xmath64 three limits allow simplifications of the above relation .",
    "first , is the limit that two electrodes to be of the same materials , @xmath65 , and the system is in equilibrium at zero bias and without loss of generality we set @xmath66 .",
    "moreover , we assume that the electrochemical potentials are shifted symmetrically with the bias voltage , i.e. @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",
    "second , is the limit of zero temperature , @xmath69 , where @xmath70 is the heaviside ( step ) function .",
    "the use of plus ( minus ) signs here arises from the positive ( negative ) bias .",
    "third , is the low bias limit , where we can neglect the transmission function s dependence on the bias , @xmath71 .",
    "applying these limits , we arrive @xmath72 if one concentrates on the bias polarity , it is easy to show that @xmath73 the above relation indicates that the power dissipated in one of the electrodes can be obtained from the power dissipated in the other one by simply inverting the bias .",
    "if one checks the behaviour of total heat dissipation with respect to the inversion of the bias voltage , one obtains @xmath74 thus , the total heat dissipation is a symmetric function with respect to the inversion of the bias voltage .",
    "also , for total heat we have @xmath75 this relation implies that the total power dissipated in the model is equal to the sum of the power dissipated for positive and negative bias in a given electrode . by inserting transmission function ( 12 ) in eq.(24 ) and taking the integral , we obtain the explicit expression for the total power dissipation in two - level model as    @xmath76 + \\frac{ev\\gamma_1}{h}c_1\\ln\\left[\\frac{\\gamma_1 ^ 2+(ev/2-\\varepsilon_1)^2}{\\gamma_1 ^ 2+(ev/2+\\varepsilon_1)^2}\\right ] \\\\   & + & \\mbox{first and second terms with } \\left\\{c\\leftrightarrow d , \\varepsilon_1\\leftrightarrow \\varepsilon_2 , \\gamma_1\\leftrightarrow\\gamma_2\\right\\}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]      here , we present our numerical results for the power dissipated of our two - level model between @xmath77-electrodes as a function of applied bias . based on which",
    "levels are dominated during the transmission we consider three cases : one of the levels is chosen from the highest occupied molecular orbital ( homo ) @xmath46 and the other one from the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital ( lumo ) @xmath45 with @xmath78 and @xmath79 , both levels are chosen from homos @xmath46 and @xmath47 below the fermi energy with @xmath80 and @xmath81 and both levels are chosen from lumos @xmath48 and @xmath82 abbove the fermi energy with @xmath83 and @xmath79 ( see fig.[fig3 ] a - b - c respectively ) .",
    "all the energies are measured with respect to the fermi energy of the system , which we set to zero ( @xmath84 ) .",
    "we have borrowed these parameters from table ii in ref@xcite .    in the all three cases the power dissipation in left and right electrodes is asymmetric and the condition ( 25 )",
    "is verified .",
    "a detailed elaboration of fig.[fig3]-a shows a cross point between the power dissipated in left and right electrodes @xmath85 which it does not happen in the other two cases .",
    "this cross point means that heat is equally dissipated in both electrodes . from eq.(22 ) and eq.(23 ) it is easy to show that the condition to have equal heat dissipation in both electrodes is that the transmission function fulfills @xmath86 .",
    "this means the transmission does not depend on the bias voltage and it is also energy independent in the transport window .",
    "this is the feature that occurs in any ballistic processes .",
    "another point we should stress out is that before the crossing point , more ( less ) heat is dissipated in the right electrode for positive ( negative ) bias , but after this point two electrodes change their roles and more(less ) heat is dissipated in the left electrode for positive ( negative ) bias ( see fig.[fig3]-a ) .",
    "this behavior can be related to the homo and lumo levels domination during the electron transmission processes . indeed , after turning bias voltage the electrochemical potentials of the left and the right electrodes are shifted and an energy window opens for electrons to cross the junction and it results in a net electron current in the junction .",
    "so for the energy - dependent transmission function which is higher in the lower part of the transport window , the more power is dissipated in the left electrode for positive bias ( case-2 and see fig.[fig3]-b ) . alternatively ,",
    "if the transmission is higher in the upper part of the transport window , more heat is dissipated in the right electrode for positive bias ( case-3 and see fig.[fig3]-c ) .",
    "a cartoon to present the scenario is depicted in fig.[fig3 - 1 ]    to further investigation of the portion of given electrode , i.e. , left electrode , in heat dissipation for our toy model , we plotted the @xmath87 as a function of the bias in fig.[fig4 ] .",
    "panel ( a ) of this figure shows that , there is a given positive bias about @xmath88 in which @xmath89 or @xmath90 , i.e. , symmetric heat dissipated in both electrodes .",
    "more precise , for positive bias when @xmath91 ( @xmath92 ) we find @xmath93 ( @xmath94 ) so the portion of left electrode in heat dissipation is less ( more ) than half of the total heat .",
    "this behavior is exactly reversed for negative bias .",
    "briefly , the main conclusion of these results reveals when we plot @xmath95 as a function of @xmath43 for both positive and negative biases in panel ( b ) .",
    "there is a point of intersection that in this point the heat dissipation in left lead is equal for positive and negative bias and after this point for positive ( negative ) bias the left electrode has a major ( minor ) portion in total heat dissipation , although before the intersection point , there is no significant difference between the heat dissipation for positive and negative bias .    . ]    . ]",
    "we consider a system consists of a @xmath0 molecule attached to one - dimensional gold ( @xmath77 ) electrodes .",
    "the whole system is described within a single electron picture by a tight - binding hamiltonian with nearest - neighbor hopping approximation .",
    "the hamiltonian representing the entire system can be written as @xmath96 where @xmath97 and @xmath98 represent the left / right electrode and the @xmath0 molecule , respectively .",
    "@xmath99 defines the coupling between left / right electrodes and the @xmath0 molecule . in our numerical calculation",
    "we used the well - konw newns - anderson model for gold ( @xmath77 ) electrodes , whose self - energies are given by @xmath100 , where @xmath101 is the surface green s function defined as @xmath102@xcite .",
    "@xmath103 is the nearest - neighboring hopping integral in the left / right electrodes .",
    "the hopping strength in @xmath0 molecule depends on the dimerization of the carbon - carbon bonds ; thus , we consider different hopping integral elements : @xmath104 for the single bonds and @xmath105 for the double bonds . in the numerical calculations we set @xmath106 and @xmath107",
    ".    results for one and five contacts have depicted in fig.([fig5 ] ) and fig.([fig6 ] ) , respectively . in fig.([fig5]-a ) we have plotted the logarithmic scale of transmission function versus energy of au-@xmath0-au junctions with one contact . for an electron with energy @xmath8 , that comes from the left connection",
    ", the probability of transmission function reaches its saturated value ( resonance peaks ) for the specific energy values . in order to verify heat dissipation feature in the junction , in fig.([fig5]-d ) we present the power dissipated in left lead as a function of the total power dissipated for negative and positive biases .",
    "our results are in good agreement with the simple two - level model .",
    "it can be seen that an intersection occurs between the power dissipated in left lead with negative and positive bias .",
    "a crossing point in which heat dissipation in leads , finds symmetric features and does not depend on the bias polarity . in fig.[fig6 ] we have considered @xmath108 molecule connected to the leads via its pentagon face .",
    "the result shows that the transmission function does not display any crossing point between the power dissipated in the left and right electrodes .",
    "therefore , in this case , the power dissipated in the electrodes shows the asymmetry feature in the whole range of applied bias .",
    "it shows how heat dissipation in the leads of a two - terminal molecular junction can be specified by its transmission characteristics and from it one can detect which molecular energy levels are more or less dominant in the transmission process .",
    "in summary , we have studied heat dissipation in single - molecule junctions . using the generalized green s function technique and the landauer formalism , we have presented a detailed theoretical and numerical analyses of heat dissipation in a simple two level system .",
    "we have shown how the transmission characteristics can affect on heat dissipation in the electrodes of a two - terminal junction .",
    "notably , we have found some points in which asymmetry characteristics of heat dissipation in the left and the right electrodes failed . in other words , at this point heat dissipation is free of bias polarity . to validate our results on the simple toy model ,",
    "we have chosen c60 molecule sandwiched between au electrodes .",
    "we have simulated a junction based on tight - binding model and landauer approach . in order to have a different transmission spectrum for an equal energy window",
    "we have considered both single and multi contacts cases .",
    "the results show how heat dissipation in the leads of a two - terminal molecular junction can be specified by its transmission characteristics and from it one can detect which molecular energy levels are more or less dominant in the transmission process",
