    ".1 cm    the story of the zero - field susceptibility @xmath10 of the two - dimensional ising model is a landmark saga of mathematical physics .",
    "a recent review of the highlights can be found in @xcite .",
    "while a closed form expression for the susceptibility still eludes us , we possess an enormous amount of exact or extremely precise numerical information .",
    "this largely derives from two complementary approaches .",
    "one approach involves studying the series expansion of the susceptibility . since the work of orrick @xcite we have had available a polynomial time algorithm , now of complexity o@xmath11 for a series of length @xmath12 terms . from the point of view of an algebraic combinatorialist , this comprises a solution , and many questions about the asymptotics , and about the scaling functions",
    "have been answered by analysis of the very long series we now have available  currently more than two thousand terms in length .",
    "the difficulty in proceeding further with this approach is that we have no idea what the underlying closed - form solution looks like , except that it is known , or more precisely universally believed , to be non - holonomic .",
    "the alternative approach is to express the susceptibility as a form - factor expansion .",
    "this approach was initiated more than 30 years ago by wu @xcite . in this representation ,",
    "the susceptibility is written @xmath13 for @xmath14 where @xmath15 for @xmath16 a similar expression with even superscripts prevails .",
    "the advantage of the form - factor approach is that each term in the sum _ is _ holonomic .",
    "this means that , with sufficient computational resources , and sufficient ingenuity , each term can be found . to date",
    ", the first six terms have been found , in the sense that their defining ode has been obtained , either totally , or _ modulo _ a prime .",
    "we also have precise integral representations for the form - factor terms , and a landau analysis of the integrands can provide information as to the distribution of singularities in the complex plane . indeed , it was just such a study by nickel @xcite that gave convincing evidence of a natural boundary in the _ total _ susceptibility , thus supporting an earlier but weaker argument of guttmann and enting @xcite that the total susceptibility was non - holonomic .    while an exact solution for the ising model susceptibility may be impossible and is certainly beyond reach at present , one might hope to obtain a complete picture of the singularities of the susceptibility .",
    "indeed , this more limited goal has been the main motivation of the recent studies of the individual form - factor terms . for this",
    "the ode and landau analysis approaches are complementary ; the landau analysis provides necessary but not sufficient conditions @xcite while the ode , even if only in mod prime representation , can show which landau singularities are to be excluded .",
    "the most detailed study in this regard is that of the five particle contribution @xmath17 to the susceptibility initiated by boukraa @xcite and followed by bostan @xcite .",
    "the present paper is an attempt to address a number of issues left unresolved in these papers .",
    "a brief summary of the parts of @xcite and @xcite relevant here is as follows . in boukraa",
    "@xcite series in @xmath18 modulo a prime to 10000 terms were given and shown to be adequate to find the order 33 fuchsian differential equation , modulo a prime , @xmath19 .",
    "subsequently in bostan  @xcite , the complexity of this ode was shown to be reducible to an inhomogeneous equation @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the linear combination of 5 , 3 and 1-particle contributions @xmath22 the right hand side of ( [ eq : l24 ] ) which satisfies @xmath23 is of the form @xmath24/(1 + 4w)^6/(1 - 16\\ , w^2)^\\kappa,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath25 and @xmath26 are complete elliptic integrals and the @xmath27 are polynomials .",
    "the degree of the polynomials and the denominator power @xmath28 in ( [ eq : e5 ] ) depend on the representation of @xmath0 in ( [ eq : l24 ] ) . in the case that @xmath0 is minimum order 24 , @xmath29 is of degree 888 , while the @xmath30 are then of degree ( at most ) 904 with @xmath31 . in  @xcite results",
    "were only reported for a non - minimum order representation modulo a prime .",
    "furthermore it was shown that @xmath0 could be factored into @xmath32 with @xmath33 being reducible into several smaller factors , all but one known in exact arithmetic .",
    "the question of whether @xmath7 could be factored was left unresolved .",
    "the results reported in  @xcite and  @xcite are an impressive example of what can be obtained by calculation modulo a prime .",
    "however there are limitations .",
    "knowing @xmath0 and @xmath34 modulo a prime enables one to deduce only possible local singularities of @xmath17 and not its global behaviour .",
    "for example , one can not determine the amplitudes of the singularities in @xmath17 at the ferromagnetic point at @xmath35 .",
    "the leading and first correction term amplitudes were estimated in  @xcite but this was based on an analysis of the 2000 term exact integer series that had been obtained from multiple modulo prime series by the chinese remainder theorem .    in the present paper",
    "we determine the minimum order @xmath0 and @xmath1 in exact arithmetic .",
    "the results can be found on the website  @xcite .",
    "we have also constructed the minimum order exact @xmath36 defined by @xmath37 from these results .",
    "we have not actually needed this operator but provide it nevertheless for those who might find it of interest and in addition we also report in  @xcite the exact integer coefficients of @xmath17 to 8000 terms that we generated directly from ( [ eq : l24 ] ) .",
    "the global information provided by ( [ eq : l24 ] ) enables us to prove that @xmath7 defined by @xmath38 @xmath32 can not be factored .",
    "we confirm the 500 digit amplitude of the leading ferromagnetic singularity of @xmath17 reported by bailey  @xcite and also some @xmath39 circle singularity amplitudes derived by nickel  @xcite .",
    "an important question left unresolved in  @xcite was whether the singularity of the ode for @xmath17 at the zero of the head polynomial at @xmath40 was in fact a singularity of @xmath17 on some branch of the function .",
    "appendix d in  @xcite provided an example for which not all the zeros of the head polynomial of the ode satisfied by an integral were landau singularities of the integral .",
    "however , the integral for @xmath17 was deemed too complicated in  @xcite to perform a complete landau singularity analysis leaving only the conclusion that @xmath40 was very likely not a landau singularity of @xmath17 .",
    "here we perform some analytic continuation of @xmath17 beyond the principal disk @xmath41 and onto other branches . our exploration , while not exhaustive , is complete enough to show @xmath17 has the singular behaviour ( @xmath42 with non - vanishing amplitude on an infinite number of branches .",
    "we have not made any progress in identifying the landau integrand singularities that give rise to this behaviour .",
    ".3 cm    in section [ ode ] we describe briefly how we can combine results reported in  @xcite with multiple modulo prime @xmath21 series of length at most 4000 terms to obtain the exact @xmath0 and @xmath1 in ( [ eq : l24 ] ) .",
    "this allows us to determine the series expansion of @xmath17 at the ferromagnetic point by numerical matching of solutions .",
    "the results are reported in [ ferro ] .",
    "section [ proof ] is the outline of the proof that @xmath7 defined by @xmath43 @xmath44 can not be factored .",
    "finally in section [ analyt ] we describe the analytic continuation of @xmath21 we have performed to obtain information on the behaviour of @xmath45 at @xmath46 .",
    ".1 cm    we are looking for the unique minimum order @xmath0 and associated @xmath34 satisfying ( [ eq : l24 ] ) for a given @xmath21 . this is to be done modulo a prime for enough primes that the exact integer @xmath0 and @xmath34 can be reconstructed by the chinese remainder theorem . to generate the required @xmath21 in ( [ eq : phi5 ] ) directly from the defining @xmath47 integrals",
    "is impractical as the minimum order @xmath0 is of degree 888 implying @xmath48 unknown coefficients in @xmath0 .",
    "added to this are the five polynomials of degree 904 in @xmath34 , i.e. another @xmath49 terms .",
    "finding all coefficients is a straightforward linear algebra problem but requires that we have each @xmath21 modulo prime series to about 26800 terms .",
    "the operator @xmath50 defined by @xmath51 for a given @xmath52 is not unique if one does not require @xmath53 to be of minimum order .",
    "the advantage of seeking a non - minimal order @xmath50 is that the number of unknown coefficients to be found can drop dramatically .",
    "for example , only about 6200 terms are needed to obtain the non - minimal @xmath54 of order 51 and degree 118 used in  @xcite .",
    "the analogous effect occurs for the inhomogeneous equation ( [ eq : l24 ] ) and we find that @xmath21 series of length only about 5300 terms are needed when @xmath0 is chosen of order 42 and degree 103 leading to polynomials of degree 155 in @xmath34 in ( [ eq : e5 ] ) with now @xmath55 .",
    "note however , as observed in  @xcite , that the integer coefficients in non - minimal order operators can be outrageously large and we expect that chinese remainder reconstruction of the non - minimal order @xmath0 would be nearly hopeless .",
    "instead , the utility of a modulo prime non - minimal @xmath0 lies in its use as a recursion device to extend directly generated ( short ) @xmath56 series to series of sufficient length , i.e. 26800 terms , so that the minimum order @xmath0 and associated @xmath34 can be found .",
    "such extension requires completely negligible computer resources .",
    "a useful variant of the above approach is to use the non - minimal @xmath0 found as described above to generate a long series for a solution @xmath57 satisfying @xmath58 .",
    "this series need only be about 22300 terms , long enough to enable reconstruction of the minimum order @xmath0 .",
    "finding the coefficients in @xmath1 from @xmath59 is then a separate and simpler problem .",
    "a further reduction in the length of the @xmath21 series to be directly generated can be obtained if one knows a factorization of @xmath0 with the right division operator in exact arithmetic .",
    "this situation can be realized given the four modulo prime series reported in  @xcite .",
    "we have @xmath60 . knowing @xmath33 in exact arithmetic allows one to obtain any non - minimal order representation of @xmath33 modulo any prime and then @xmath61 @xmath62 modulo a prime from the directly generated @xmath21 .",
    "if we choose our representation of the known @xmath33 as order 18 and degree 42 , and the unknown @xmath7 as order 32 and degree 89 , then the polynomials in @xmath63 are of degree 199 .",
    "this gives @xmath64 unknown coefficients in @xmath65 and @xmath7 to be determined implying that 4000 terms of the directly generated @xmath66 series is more than adequate .",
    "since the series generation of @xmath66 described in  @xcite is an @xmath67 process , this represents a 3-fold reduction in computer time from that needed using an unfactored @xmath0 or a 6-fold reduction relative to the unfactored @xmath54 approach .",
    "we have generated the @xmath17 series to a minimum @xmath68 for 90 primes @xmath69 and from these generated @xmath0 modulo a prime as described above . to obtain the exact @xmath0",
    "is then a problem of rational reconstruction but it is relatively easy from just a few terms to guess a normalization factor that converts the problem to integer reconstruction by the chinese remainder theorem .",
    "the integer coefficients in @xmath0 are observed to typically have very large powers of 2 as factors which one can determine by a process of trial division by @xmath70 .",
    "if @xmath71 is chosen too small , chinese remainder reconstruction with a fixed number of primes might fail because the unknown coefficient is too large while if @xmath72 is chosen too large there is failure because the coefficient is no longer an integer . with 84 primes",
    "we find an intermediate @xmath71 range that yields a consistent integer reconstruction for every coefficient in @xmath0 .",
    "with 90 primes we have a large number of consistency checks that leave no doubt that our reconstruction is exact .",
    "we have also confirmed the apparent singularity constraint equations ( a.8 ) in  @xcite are satisfied by our reconstructed @xmath0 in all cases , that is , 19849 satisfied conditions on 22202 non - vanishing coefficients in @xmath29 .    in view of the `` massive '' calculations",
    "required to find @xmath29 in exact arithmetic it is natural to ask for some further mathematical and numerical checks of the correctness of the operators @xmath0 and @xmath73 .",
    "first of all we have checked directly that @xmath74 does indeed right divide @xmath0 in exact arithmetic .",
    "secondly , we have confirmed that the exponents of the operators @xmath0 and @xmath73 are _ rational numbers _ and in agreement with our previous massive numerical calculations  @xcite .",
    "thirdly , the minimal order operator @xmath54 corresponds to an integral of an algebraic integrand , and it is therefore , as mathematicians say a _ period _ ( `` derived from geometry ''  @xcite ) : @xmath54 is thus , necessarily , _ globally nilpotent_. this is a stronger constraint than being a fuchsian operator ( with integer coefficients ) having only rational exponents . since @xmath0 is a factor of @xmath54 it must also be globally nilpotent , and likewise the left factor @xmath73 must be globally nilpotent .",
    "we have verified that @xmath0 , @xmath73 and @xmath74 are consistent with globally nilpotent operators .",
    "this is a very strong indication that our exact expressions for @xmath0 and @xmath73 are correct . to check global nilpotence",
    "numerically requires one to calculate the @xmath75-curvature and check that it is zero for almost all primes . in practice",
    "one can obviously only do this for the first few primes .",
    "the primes used for @xmath76 were those smaller than 30 while primes less than 10 were used for @xmath29 .",
    "as shown in  @xcite the calculation of a series for @xmath17 is a problem with computational complexity @xmath77 . in  @xcite we initially calculated @xmath17 to 10000 terms which required some 17000 cpu hours on an sgi altrix cluster with 1.6 ghz itanium2 processors . from this single series",
    "we could already exactly identify a simple right divisor of @xmath78 and using this factor we were able to find a solution modulo a second prime using a series of ` just ' 5600 terms . expanding",
    "the series to order 5600 took around 1560 cpu hours on the altrix cluster .",
    "the series modulo these two primes then sufficed to find a larger right divisor of @xmath36 in exact arithmetic , and using this factor we found that only 4800 terms would be required to find solutions for any subsequent primes .    shortly after these developments",
    "a new system was installed by the national computational infrastructrure ( nci ) whose national facility provides the national peak computing facility for australian researchers .",
    "this new system is an sgi xe cluster using quad - core 3.0ghz intel harpertown cpus .",
    "our code runs almost twice as fast on this facility compared to the altrix cluster .",
    "we then used this system to calculate the series for @xmath17 to order 4800 ( this took about 450 cpu hours ) for a third prime , which again allowed us to find an even larger right divisor of @xmath36 in exact arithmetic .",
    "this larger operator reduced the required number of terms to 4600 and we then calculated a series for a fourth prime to this order using some 380 cpu hours .",
    "these calculations gave us results for 4 different primes and allowed us to reconstruct the factor @xmath79 in exact arithmetic as begun in  @xcite and completed here in [ exactl1tilde ] .",
    "it was only after this that we realised that the inhomogenous equation ( [ eq : l24 ] ) could be used , as detailed above , to obtain simultaneous solutions for @xmath29 and @xmath1 using as few as 4000 terms .",
    "we then calculated series for @xmath17 to order 4000 for a further 86 primes with each prime requiring about 215 cpu hours .",
    "estimates @xmath80 for the number of primes required to reconstruct the coefficients @xmath81.,width=453 ]    the above timings make it clear that the reconstruction of @xmath29 and @xmath34 is a computationally expensive project . the main computational effort is the direct calculation of the series @xmath17 modulo the required number of primes .",
    "it is therefore of some practical interest to estimate the number of primes required for the exact reconstruction based only on some partial reconstruction .",
    "we focus here on the coefficients of the head - polynomial of @xmath29 and denote by @xmath81 the @xmath82th coefficient ( @xmath83 ) after stripping it of any factors of 2 as mentioned above .",
    "then @xmath80 is a rough measure of the number of primes needed to reconstruct @xmath81 . from our previous reconstruction of @xmath79 we noticed that the corresponding @xmath84 are given roughly by a quadratic function of @xmath82 .",
    "thus one can estimate the number of primes needed to reconstruct the full @xmath29 from a partial reconstruction since @xmath84 for @xmath82 near 0 or 888 can be obtained using many fewer primes . in fig .",
    "[ fig : l24 ] the lower ` curve ' is the actual data from the coefficients of the head - polynomial of @xmath29 , while the upper solid curves are quadratic fits to the data based on the part data set , from top to bottom , @xmath85 and @xmath86 .",
    "the pertinent point being that after doing the calculation for some 30 primes we estimated that the reconstruction was likely to succeed with no more than 100 primes and was therefore achievable in practice .",
    "with @xmath29 and @xmath34 known in exact arithmetic it is easy to use ( [ eq : l24 ] ) to calculate the exact series for @xmath87 to high order .",
    "specifically our reconstruction means that we know the coefficients @xmath88 of the polynomials in the operator @xmath29 and the coefficients of the polynomials @xmath89 of ( [ eq : e5 ] ) exactly .",
    "the latter allows us to easily calculate the coefficients @xmath90 of @xmath34 by using the ( simple ) recursive formulae for the elliptic integrals @xmath91 and @xmath92 . from ( [ eq : l24 ] ) we have explicitly , by equating the coefficients of @xmath93 , that ( recall that @xmath29 is expressed in terms of the differential operator @xmath94 ) @xmath95 where @xmath96 and @xmath97 are integers ( depending on @xmath82 ) .",
    "the coefficients @xmath81 of @xmath87 can thus be calculated recursively and from ( [ eq : phi5 ] ) we can calculate the coefficients of @xmath17 ( with the coefficients of @xmath98 calculated using the ode from @xcite ) .",
    "we have calculated the coefficients of @xmath17 up to order 8000 and they can be found in @xcite .",
    "finally we decided to calculate the minimal order operator @xmath36 explicitly ; it is given implicitly by ( [ eq : l24 ] ) .",
    "this can be done in a variety of ways .",
    "the most obvious way is to use ( [ eq : cn ] ) to extend the series for @xmath99 to high enough order ( @xmath100 , since the minimal order @xmath36 has degree 1237 ) and then use the matrix code of @xcite to calculate the ode corresponding to @xmath36 modulo a sufficient number of primes to reconstruct @xmath36 .",
    "however , computationally it is easier to first calculate modulo a prime the minimal operator @xmath101 annihilating @xmath1 and then form the product @xmath102 modulo a prime .",
    "the minimal order operator for @xmath101 has degree @xmath103 so @xmath104 terms of @xmath1 is required . obviously ,",
    "since the minimal order @xmath29 has degree 888 , the product @xmath102 has degree 5377 meaning that there is a common factor of degree 4140 , which we must discard in order to calculate the degree 1237 polynomials of @xmath36 .",
    "the minimal order @xmath101 was calculated ( for each prime ) using the matrix code of @xcite .",
    "the product @xmath102 was then calculated modulo a prime using maple and the common factor can then be divided out modulo a prime .",
    "the bottle - neck in this calculation is the use of the matrix code of @xcite which has computational complexity @xmath105 .",
    "it was for this reason that we chose the `` indirect '' route of going through @xmath101 to get @xmath36 .",
    ".1 cm    the factorization of @xmath36 defined by @xmath106 described in  @xcite relied mostly on the testing of series @xmath107 generated by @xmath108 modulo a prime around @xmath109 .",
    "if a particular series is annihilated by an @xmath110 for order @xmath111 then @xmath110 right divides @xmath36 . depending on the singularity exponents , a series solution @xmath112 @xmath113 with fixed @xmath114 ,",
    "might be uniquely determined by @xmath115 or might contain one or more arbitrary rational coefficients @xmath116 . in the latter case",
    "the series may be a generator for a right division operator only for a particular choice of constants @xmath116 and the problem then is how these particular values might be found . if there is only one arbitrary coefficient @xmath117 in the series @xmath107 an exhaustive search is possible in a modulo prime , @xmath118 , calculation because one need then only test @xmath118 separate series with @xmath119 an integer satisfying @xmath120 .",
    "if there is more than one arbitrary @xmath121 in the series @xmath107 such brute force `` guessing '' is no longer practical due to computational time constraints .",
    "it is this that prevented the authors of  @xcite from deciding whether @xmath7 is factorizable .",
    "let us also note that we were not able to perform a straight formal calculation factorization of @xmath7 using its expression in exact arithmetic and our attempted calculations failed on a computer with 48 gb of memory .    as pointed out in  @xcite",
    "there is nothing special about the singular point @xmath122 . and",
    "indeed , a series solution about a singular point @xmath123 might also lead to a right division operator .",
    "for example , the unique singular series @xmath124 with @xmath125 is annihilated by an order three operator . with @xmath126 ,",
    "the unique singular series @xmath127 yields an order 6 right division operator @xmath128 . by proceeding through a sequence of such solutions",
    ", one can eliminate much if not all of the @xmath75-fold searching described in  @xcite to achieve the factorization @xmath129 and the additional factorization of @xmath33 .",
    "the points chosen for series expansion need not be restricted to the rational head polynomial roots as in the equations ( [ 7over4 ] ) and ( [ 7over2 ] ) above . the factor @xmath130 , which appeared already in the head polynomial of the @xmath131 that annihilated @xmath132 , has `` accidental '' modulo prime factorizations for roughly half the primes close to @xmath133 .",
    "for example , with prime @xmath134 , one has @xmath135 modulo @xmath118 . we can write @xmath136 with @xmath137 either 8973 or 31925 and obtain solutions about @xmath138 satisfying @xmath139 modulo @xmath118 , where @xmath140 and @xmath141 are regular at @xmath142 and the series @xmath143 is unique .",
    "testing shows that @xmath144 is annihilated ( modulo @xmath118 ) by an order 3 operator @xmath145 . as we show in general in  [ rightdiv ]",
    ", one can obtain from @xmath145 a right division ( modulo @xmath75 ) operator @xmath146 and then from multiple modulo prime calculations , an exact right division @xmath146 by the chinese remainder theorem .",
    "this reconstructed @xmath146 has the factor @xmath147 in its head polynomial in spite of the fact that @xmath137 is clearly not one of the roots @xmath148 modulo @xmath118 , of @xmath149 .    testing at points other than @xmath109 also enables one to exclude certain series solutions as generators of right division operators .",
    "for example , the case 3 polynomial @xmath150 which is a factor of the head polynomial of @xmath0 has the modulo prime , @xmath151 , factorization @xmath152 .",
    "define @xmath153 .",
    "then the singular solution modulo @xmath154 about @xmath155 is @xmath156 with @xmath157 unique and @xmath158 regular at @xmath138 .",
    "testing the series  ( [ eq : lns ] ) shows there is no @xmath159 modulo @xmath160 for any @xmath161 .",
    "thus there is no operator of order less than 24 that has @xmath162 as a factor ( modulo @xmath160 ) of the head polynomial and more generally , @xmath150 as a factor .",
    "this also implies that any solution @xmath163 that is singular at some root of @xmath150 and satisfying @xmath164 , can not also be a solution of an operator of order less than 12 that right divides @xmath7 .",
    "the same conclusion is reached for the remaining case 3 and both case 4 polynomials for @xmath17 from appendix c in  @xcite .",
    "if we only knew @xmath0 or @xmath7 modulo prime for a few primes , the above information about singular solutions associated with case 3 and 4 polynomials would not be particularly useful for finding or excluding factorization .",
    "however , with the exact @xmath0 available one has global information and can match series solutions about @xmath165 to solutions about other singular points of @xmath0 .",
    "in particular , if one can show that every series solution @xmath107 about @xmath166 satisfying @xmath167 is singular at some root of the case 3 or 4 polynomials then one has proved that @xmath7 does not factorize .",
    "our demonstration that this is the case uses the singular point @xmath168 which is a root of @xmath150 .",
    "this is a particularly convenient point as it is the closest root of the head polynomial of @xmath0 to both @xmath166 and @xmath169 .",
    "we begin the demonstration by studying the two linearly independent solutions of the form @xmath170 plus terms with lower powers of @xmath171 .",
    "the two series @xmath172 @xmath173 satisfy @xmath174 _ but not _ @xmath175 and",
    "a ratio test shows they have radii of convergence @xmath176 .",
    "thus both @xmath177 and @xmath178 are singular at @xmath179 and can not be generators of an @xmath110 , @xmath180 , that right divides @xmath0 . whether a linear combination of @xmath177 and @xmath178 leads to a right division operator",
    "is now determined as follows .    near @xmath181 where @xmath182 the @xmath183 must be of the form @xmath184 where @xmath185 and the @xmath186 are all regular at @xmath187 .",
    "the series @xmath188 will be regular at @xmath179 and if the amplitude ratio @xmath189 is rational , then @xmath190 might be a candidate generator for a right division operator . in principle , the amplitudes @xmath191 could be found by matching series solutions about @xmath192 to those about @xmath193 but since we only need the @xmath189 ratio , a simpler procedure that utilizes only the coefficients in ( [ eq : a1],[eq : a2 ] ) is possible .",
    "we note that of the remaining singularities of @xmath194 , the nearest to @xmath193 are at @xmath195 .",
    "this implies that @xmath196 , a ratio of coefficients from ( [ eq : a1],[eq : a2 ] ) , to an accuracy of order @xmath197 .",
    "thus the problem reduces to searching for a ( small ) rational @xmath189 from a sequence that converges exponentially .",
    "this can be done by expressing @xmath198 as a continued fraction .",
    "we observe that , for @xmath5 greater than some fixed @xmath199 , a particular term in the continued fraction grows exponentially which is a clear indication that in the limit @xmath200 the continued fraction terminates and is the ( small ) rational @xmath201 .",
    "our result for the linear combination series is then @xmath202 which is confirmed to have a radius of convergence @xmath203 . however , testing the series ( [ aw ] ) shows it is not annihilated by any @xmath204 , @xmath205 , and thus we have eliminated the only possible linear combination candidate series for a right division operator .",
    "while direct testing is an easy way to exclude @xmath206 in ( [ aw ] ) , such direct testing is impractical as a general method for excluding the many possible series that arise in the remaining part of our proof .",

    "an incidental remark on the solution ( [ eq : s5 ] ) is that this is one of the few examples of a ( partial ) analytic solution of @xmath456 .",
    "other simple solutions are @xmath477 , @xmath478 and @xmath479 , @xmath480 associated with @xmath481 , @xmath482 and @xmath461 , respectively .",

    ".1 cm to find @xmath21 in the vicinity of the point @xmath287 where @xmath484 requires that we first find a solution to the inhomogeneous equation ( [ eq : l24 ] ) near @xmath287 .",
    "to this end we develop the elliptic integrals in ( [ eq : e5 ] ) as series in @xmath378 after which finding a particular integral by series recursion is straightforward .",
    "what remains is then the matching of the @xmath21 series about @xmath485 to this particular integral plus the 24 homogeneous solution series @xmath486 satisfying @xmath487 .",
    "this too is a straightforward exercise although clearly one must pay attention to potential errors arising both from numerical round - off and series length truncation .",
    "a useful remark in this regard is that it is very advantageous to work with @xmath87 series in @xmath368 rather than @xmath488 .",
    "this arises because of the non - linear relationship @xmath489 at the ferromagnetic critical point .    to understand the effect of the choice of series variable we note that in general the error resulting from truncation of a series in @xmath490 at @xmath491 terms when evaluated at @xmath492 scales roughly as @xmath493 where @xmath494 is the distance to the nearest singularity from @xmath495 . as an illustration , from @xmath21 series of @xmath496 terms and a matching point at @xmath497 ,",
    "the series truncation error is @xmath498 @xmath499 for small @xmath500 .",
    "now suppose the solution series @xmath486 have been evaluated to @xmath501 terms .",
    "the solutions with the smallest radius of convergence , @xmath502 , determine the truncation error which is @xmath503 .",
    "the optimal choice of matching point is where the errors are roughly equal , i.e. @xmath504 with @xmath505 and @xmath506 , condition ( [ a1 ] ) yields @xmath507 with a resulting truncation error @xmath508 .",
    "this estimate of 400 digit accuracy is overly optimistic since the @xmath21 matching requires the evaluation of 23 derivatives which invalidates our assumption of functions all of unit magnitude .",
    "consider now what happens if the matching is done using @xmath21 as a series in @xmath509 of @xmath510 terms .",
    "the truncation error is @xmath511 @xmath512 for small @xmath500 .",
    "the match point choice that replaces ( [ a1 ] ) is @xmath513 and with the same series lengths as above , @xmath514 with resulting truncation error @xmath515 . again",
    "this must be overly optimistic but it does illustrate the dramatic improvement achieved with no extra computational cost .",
    "our results for the behaviour of @xmath21 at the ferromagnetic point are as follows : we use throughout the definition @xmath516 as above .",
    "then , to @xmath517 , the 5-particle contribution is @xmath518 where the constant arrays @xmath257 and @xmath519 are only known as floating point values .",
    "truncated values are @xmath520 @xmath521 while values to about 800 digits can be found in  @xcite .",
    "the 3-particle function , to @xmath522 , is @xmath523 where @xmath524 is the polygamma function ( @xmath525 ) .",
    "the coefficient of @xmath526 in ( [ a5 ] ) was determined by tracy  @xcite while the higher order terms are recursively generated from the ode satisfied  @xcite by @xmath527 .",
    "finally , @xmath528 when these results are combined and expressed in terms of @xmath529 , i.e. @xmath530 , one confirms the low order result for @xmath531 in equation ( 48 ) of  @xcite .",
    "we also confirm the 500 digit expression for the @xmath531 amplitude @xmath532 given by bailey  @xcite .",
    "the explicit connection is @xmath533 with @xmath534 given in ( [ a4 ] ) .",
    "the 5-particle contribution ( [ a3 ] ) to @xmath522 can be extended to arbitrary order by a purely local analysis of the ode ( [ eq : l24 ] ) .",
    "this makes ( [ a3 ] ) particularly useful for those problems in which one wants to analytically continue @xmath21 beyond the ferromagnetic singularity . of the constants in ( [ a4 ] ) , only the fifteen @xmath535 and @xmath536 depend directly on solution matching .",
    "all higher order coefficients are fixed by recursion relations with rational coefficients .",
    "the rationals are quite large , even in the simplest example which reads @xmath537 with @xmath538 floating point recursion in @xmath539 is unstable to the extent that relative errors increase by about factor 40 per order in the @xmath539 series .",
    "if one wants , say , 1500 terms , one must start with 2400 digits more than the desired final accuracy .",
    "one must also use directly as starting values only the coefficients @xmath540 and @xmath541 from ( [ a4 ] ) .",
    "all other coefficients are to be obtained to the necessary higher accuracy directly from the ode ( [ eq : l24 ] ) locally around @xmath287 , now treating the starting values @xmath542 and @xmath543 as if exact .",
    "the problem of numerical instability in series generation around rational points can be avoided by generating all series in exact arithmetic . in that case",
    "the series coefficients are in general rational and our observation , admittedly rather limited , is that the growth of the denominators is at most exponential .",
    "an example of denominator growth is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : denom ] for all series in @xmath544 that we have generated for doing the ferromagnetic point series matching described above .",
    "a growth rate faster than exponential would make exact arithmetic series generation impractical so it is of some importance to know whether the observed exponential growth is a general feature .",
    "it is reminiscent of g - series @xcite but we are unaware of any theorem that guarantees this behaviour for expansions of integrals with algebraic integrands about singular points .",

    ".1 cm    we wish to determine a right division of a minimum order @xmath549 from solutions identified with the non - rational zeros of a factor @xmath550 of the head polynomial of @xmath551 .",
    "examples of @xmath550 treated in the text are @xmath552 and the case 3 and 4 polynomials from appendix  c in  @xcite .",
    "if such a polynomial has an `` accidental '' modulo prime @xmath118 factorization @xmath553 , we can still generate series solutions about @xmath554 where @xmath555 . furthermore , suppose the solution @xmath556 has been tested and is found to be annihilated by a minimum order @xmath557 operator .",
    "if the code used for the testing is that described in section  3 of  @xcite the result will be of the form @xmath558 where the head polynomial @xmath559 is normalized such that @xmath560 . note that @xmath561 is not the modulo @xmath118 representation of a root of @xmath562 and both it and @xmath490 have no meaning independent of the specific modulo @xmath118 factorization @xmath563 . consequently there does not exist any exact `` @xmath564 '' to be reconstructed from multiple @xmath564 generated using different primes . replacing @xmath490 by @xmath565 in ( [ b1 ] )",
    "generates an @xmath566 but only when this is correctly normalized to remove all dependence on the `` accidental '' @xmath561 can it be used for a reconstruction of an exact @xmath567 .",
    "the steps for doing this are as follows .    to begin , note that ( [ b1 ] ) can be expressed as a sum of polynomials times powers of @xmath568 .",
    "the head polynomial in this representation is clearly @xmath569 .",
    "the modulo @xmath118 factorization of this will contain as factors @xmath570^k$ ] , typically with @xmath571 .",
    "these factors can be written as @xmath572^k \\",

    "dependence on the `` accidental '' @xmath137 appears only in the factor @xmath573 and this can be divided out .",
    "so too can the @xmath193 normalization constant @xmath574 evaluated at @xmath575 .",
    "the result is the right division ( modulo @xmath75 ) operator which can be cast into the same form as ( [ b1 ] ) , namely @xmath576 where each @xmath577 is a polynomial and , by construction , @xmath578 .",
