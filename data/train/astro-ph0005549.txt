    "the discovery of afterglows from gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) has opened up a new era in the field . till the end of august 1999 ,",
    "x - ray , optical , and radio afterglows have been observed from about 16 , 11 , and 5 grbs respectively ( costa et al .",

    ". however , we are still far from resolving the puzzle of grbs , because their `` inner engines '' are well hidden from direct afterglow observations .",
    "most grbs localized by bepposax have indicated isotropic energies of @xmath9  @xmath10 ergs , well within the energy output from solar - mass compact stellar objects . however , grb 971214 , 980703 , 990123 , and 990510 have implied isotropic gamma - ray releases of @xmath11 ergs ( 0.17 @xmath12 , kulkarni et al .",
    "1998 ) , @xmath13 ergs ( 0.06 @xmath12 , bloom et al . 1998 ) , @xmath14 ergs ( 1.9 @xmath12 , kulkarni et al .",

    "1999 ) , and @xmath15 ergs ( 0.16 @xmath12 , harrison et al . 1999 ) respectively .",
    "moreover , if really located at a redshift of @xmath16 as suggested by reichart et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , grb 980329 would imply an isotropic gamma - ray energy of @xmath17 ergs ( 2.79 @xmath12 ) .",
    "such enormous energetics has forced some theorists to deduce that grb radiation must be highly collimated in these cases , with half opening angle @xmath18 , so that the intrinsic gamma - ray energy could be reduced by a factor of @xmath19  @xmath20 , and could still come from compact stellar objects ( pugliese , falcke & biermann 1999 ) . obviously , whether grbs are beamed or not is of fundamental importance to our understanding of their nature .",
    "for theorists , the degree of beaming can place severe constraints on grb models .",
    "how can we tell a jet from an isotropic fireball ?",
    "direct clues may come from afterglow light curves .",
    "as argued by panaitescu & mszros ( 1999 ) and kulkarni et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , when the lorentz factor of the ejecta drops to @xmath21 , the edge of the jet becomes visible .",
    "thus the light curve will steepen by @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the observed time .",
    "this is called the edge effect ( mszros & rees 1999 ) .",
    "another effect is called the lateral expansion effect .",
    "rhoads ( 1997 , 1999a , b ) has shown that the lateral expansion ( at sound speed ) of a relativistic jet ( @xmath24 ) will cause the blastwave to decelerate more quickly , leading to a sharp break in the afterglow light curve . the breaking point is again determined by @xmath25 .",
    "the power law decay indices of afterglows from grb 980326 and 980519 are anomalously large , @xmath26 ( groot et al .",
    "1998 ; owens et al . 1998",
    "; halpern et al . 1999 ) , and optical light curves of grb 990123 and 990510 even show obvious steepening at @xmath27  2 d ( kulkarni et al . 1999 ; harrison et al . 1999 ; castro - tirado et al .",
    "recently grb 970228 was also reported to have a large index of @xmath28 ( galama et al .",
    "these phenomena have been widely regarded as evidence for relativistic jets ( sari , piran & halpern 1999 ) .",
    "however , numerical studies of some other authors ( panaitescu & mszros 1998 ; moderski , sikora & bulik 1999 ) have shown that due to the increased swept - up matter and the time delay of the large angle emission , the sideway expansion of the jet does not lead to an obvious dimming of the afterglow .",
    "thus there are two opposite conclusions about the jet effect : the analytical solution predicts a sharp break , while the numerical calculation shows no such sharp breaks .",
    "the condition is quite confusing .",
    "we need to clarify this question urgently .    in a recent paper ( huang et al .",
    "1999c ) , we have developed a refined model to describe the evolution of jetted grb remnants . due to some crucial refinements in the dynamics",
    ", we can follow the overall evolution of a realistic jet till its expanding velocity is as small as @xmath29 .",
    "many new results were obtained in that paper , e.g. , ( i ) we found no obvious break in the optical light curve during _ the relativistic phase itself _ , i.e. the time determined by @xmath25 is not a breaking point .",
    "but in some cases , obvious breaks does appear at the relativistic - newtonian transition point .",
    "( ii ) generally speaking , the newtonian phase of jet evolution is characterized by a sharp decay of optical afterglows , with the power law timing index @xmath30  @xmath31 .",
    "the most interesting finding may be that whether the relativistic - newtonian break appears or not depends on @xmath3 , the parameter characterizing the energy equipartition between electrons and protons .",
    "this has given strong hints on the solution to the confusing problem mentioned just above : whether an obvious break appears or not may depend on parameters .",
    "in this paper , we go further to investigate what impact will other parameters have on the optical light curves , based on the model developed by huang et al .",
    "( 1999c ) .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows . for completeness",
    ", the model is briefly described in section 2 . in section 3",
    "we investigate various parameter effects and present our detailed numerical results , mainly in the form of optical light curves .",
    "we find that the light curve break is really affected by many other parameters .",
    "section 4 is our final conclusion , and section 5 is a brief discussion .",
    "we use the model developed by huang et al .",
    "( 1999c ) . this model has the following advantages : ( i ) it is applicable to both radiative and adiabatic blastwaves , and appropriate for both ultra - relativistic and non - relativistic stages .",
    "the model even allows the radiative efficiency @xmath32 to evolve with time , so that it can trace the evolution of a realistic grb remnant , which is believed to evolve from the highly radiative regime to the adiabatic one ( dai , huang & lu 1999 ) .",
    "( ii ) it takes the lateral expansion of the jet into account .",
    "the lateral speed is given by a reasonable expression .",
    "( iii ) it also takes many other effects into account , for example , the cooling of electrons , and the equal arrival time surfaces .",
    "the model is very convenient for numerical studies . here ,",
    "for completeness , we describe the model briefly . for details",
    "please see huang et al .",
    "( 1999c ) .",
    "let @xmath33 be the radial coordinate in the burster frame ; @xmath23 be the observer s time ; @xmath34 and @xmath35 be the initial lorentz factor and ejecta mass and @xmath36 the half opening angle of the ejecta .",
    "the burst energy is @xmath37 .",
    "the evolution of radius ( @xmath33 ) , the swept - up mass ( @xmath38 ) , the half opening angle ( @xmath36 ) and the lorentz factor ( @xmath8 ) is described by ( huang et al .",
    "1999c ) : @xmath39 @xmath40 @xmath41 @xmath42 where @xmath43 , @xmath6 is the number density of surrounding interstellar medium ( ism ) , @xmath44 is the mass of proton , @xmath45 is the co - moving lateral radius of the ejecta ( rhoads 1999a ; moderski , sikora & bulik 1999 ) , @xmath46 is the co - moving sound speed , and @xmath32 is the radiative efficiency .    a reasonable expression for @xmath46 is @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the adiabatic index . in the ultra - relativistic limit",
    "( @xmath49 ) , equation  ( [ cs5 ] ) gives @xmath50 ; and in the non - relativistic limit ( @xmath51 ) , we simply get @xmath52 .    as usual , we assume that the magnetic energy density in the co - moving frame is a fraction @xmath4 of the total thermal energy density ( dai , huang & lu 1999 ) , @xmath53 , and that the shock accelerated electrons carry a fraction @xmath3 of the proton energy",
    ". the minimum lorentz factor of the random motion of electrons in the co - moving frame is @xmath54 + 1 $ ] , where @xmath55 is the index characterizing the power law energy distribution of electrons , and @xmath56 is the electron mass .",
    "then the radiative efficiency of the ejecta is ( dai , huang & lu 1999 ) @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the co - moving frame expansion time , @xmath59 , and @xmath60 is the synchrotron cooling time , @xmath61 , with @xmath62 the thompson cross section . in this paper",
    ", we call the jet , whose radiative efficiency evolves according to equation  ( [ eps6 ] ) , a `` realistic '' one ( dai , huang & lu 1999 ) .      in the co - moving frame , synchrotron radiation power at frequency @xmath63 from electrons is given by ( rybicki & lightman 1979 ) @xmath64 where @xmath65 is electron charge , @xmath66 is the maximum lorentz factor of electrons , @xmath67 is electron distribution function , @xmath68 , and @xmath69 with @xmath70 being the bessel function .    in the absence of radiation loss ,",
    "the distribution of the shock accelerated electrons behind the blastwave is usually assumed to be a power law function of electron energy , @xmath71 .",
    "however , radiation loss may play an important role in the process .",
    "sari , piran & narayan ( 1998 ) have derived an equation for the critical electron lorentz factor , @xmath72 , above which synchrotron radiation is significant : @xmath73 . in our model",
    ", the actual electron distribution is given according to the following cases ( dai , huang & lu 1999 ; huang et al .",
    "1999c ) :    \\(i ) for @xmath74 , @xmath75    \\(ii ) for @xmath76 , @xmath77    \\(iii ) for @xmath78 , @xmath79    let @xmath80 be the luminosity distance , @xmath81 be the angle between the velocity of emitting material and the line of sight and define @xmath82 .",
    "then the observed flux density at frequency @xmath83 from this emitting point is @xmath84 in order to calculate the total observed flux density , we should integrate over the equal arrival time surface ( waxman 1997b ; sari 1997b ; panaitescu & mszros 1998 ) determined by @xmath85 within the jet boundaries ( moderski , sikora & bulik 1999 ; panaitescu & mszros 1999 ) .",
    "in this section , we follow the evolution of jetted grb remnants numerically to see what effects will those parameters ( such as @xmath86 ... , etc . )",
    "have on the optical light curves . for convenience ,",
    "let us define the following initial values or parameters as a set of `` standard '' parameters : initial energy per solid angle @xmath87 ergs/@xmath88 , @xmath89 ( i.e. , initial ejecta mass per solid angle @xmath90 ) , @xmath91 @xmath92 , @xmath93 , @xmath94 , @xmath95 kpc , @xmath96 , @xmath97 , where the observing angle @xmath98 is defined as the angle between the line of sight and the jet axis . for simplicity",
    ", we first assume that the expansion is completely adiabatic all the time ( i.e. @xmath99 , we call it an `` ideal '' jet , distinguishing it from the `` realistic '' jet defined in section 2.1 ) .    figure 1 shows the evolution of the lorentz factor for some exemplary jets . in the `` standard '' case , the ultra - relativistic phase lasts only for @xmath100 s , and the non - relativistic phase begins at about @xmath101 s. in short , the ejecta will cease to be highly relativistic at time @xmath102  @xmath103 s. this again gives strong support to our previous argument that we should be careful in discussing the fireball evolution under the simple assumption of ultra - relativistic limit ( huang et al .",
    "1998a , b , 1999a , b ) . in the case of a dense ism ( @xmath104 @xmath92 , the dash - dotted line ) ,",
    "the expansion will become non - relativistic as early as @xmath105 s. figure 2 is the evolution of the jet opening angle @xmath36 . during the ultra - relativistic phase , @xmath36 increases only slightly .",
    "but at the newtonian stage , the increase of @xmath36 is very quick .",
    "the effect of @xmath3 on the optical ( r - band ) light curves is illustrated in figure 3 , from which we can see clearly that : ( i ) in no case could we observe the theoretically predicted light curve steepening ( with the break point determined by @xmath106 ) during _ the relativistic stage itself _",
    ", this is consistent with the result of moderski , sikora & bulik ( 1999 ) .",
    "note that in this figure the relativistic phase is restricted by @xmath107 s. huang et al .",
    "( 1999c ) have given a reasonable explanation to this phenomena : the edge and the lateral expansion effects begin to take effect when @xmath25 ( in our calculation this occurs at @xmath108 s , however the blastwave is already in its mildly relativistic phase at that moment and it will become non - relativistic soon after that ( i.e. , when @xmath109 s , see figure 1 ) .",
    "so it is not surprising that we could not see any obvious breaks during the relativistic phase , they just do not have time to emerge .",
    "another possible reason is : at these stages , since @xmath8 is no longer much larger than 1 , we should be careful in using the analytic approximations ; ( ii ) when @xmath3 is small , an obvious break does appear in the light curve , but it is clearly due to the transition from the relativistic phase to the non - relativistic phase .",
    "the simulation by moderski , sikora & bulik ( 1999 ) does not show such breaks , because their model is not appropriate for non - relativistic expansion ( huang et al .",
    "1999c ) ; ( iii ) when @xmath3 is large , the break disappears .",
    "this is not difficult to understand ( huang et al .",
    "according to the analysis in the ultra - relativistic limit , the time that the light curve peaks scales as ( wijers & galama 1999 ; bttcher & dermer 1999 ; chevalier & li 1999 ) @xmath110 > from figure 3 we can also see that with the increase of @xmath3 , @xmath111 becomes larger and larger , consistent with equation  ( [ tm14 ] ) . in the case of @xmath112 , @xmath111 is as large as @xmath100 s. note that the expansion has already ceased to be ultra - relativistic at that moment",
    ". then we can not see the initial power law decay ( i.e. , with @xmath113 ) in the relativistic phase , and so it is not strange that the break due to the relativistic - newtonian transition does not appear ( huang et al .",
    "1999c ) ; ( iv ) in all cases , the light curves during the non - relativistic phase are characterized by quick decays , with @xmath7 .",
    "this is quite different from isotropic fireballs , whose light curves steepen only slightly after entering the non - relativistic phase ( wijers , rees & mszros 1997 ; huang , dai & lu 1998a ) .",
    "we thus suggest that the most obvious characteristic of jet effects is a sharp decay of afterglows at late stages ( with @xmath114 ) .",
    "this will be further proved by other figures followed .",
    "figure 4 illustrates the effect of @xmath4 on the optical light curves .",
    "again no break appears during _ the relativistic phase itself_. interestingly but not surprisingly , we see that @xmath4 has an effect similar to @xmath3 : for small values of @xmath4 , there are obvious breaks at the transition from relativistic stage to non - relativistic stage ( i.e. , at @xmath101 s ) ; but for large @xmath4 values , the break disappears , we could only observe a single steep line with @xmath7 .",
    "the reason is also similar to that of @xmath3 . with the increase of @xmath4 ,",
    "@xmath111 becomes larger and larger , as can be clearly seen from equation  ( [ tm14 ] ) .",
    "when @xmath111 is large enough ( i.e. , enters the mildly relativistic zone ) , the initial power law decaying segment ( with @xmath113 ) in the relativistic phase will be hidden completely . then we can only see the quick decay in the newtonian phase .",
    "the figure also shows that with the decrease of @xmath4 , the flux density decreases substantially .",
    "figure 5 illustrates the effect of @xmath5 on the light curves . for small @xmath5 values ,",
    "the breaks due to the relativistic - newtonian transition are very obvious , consistent with a recent analytic treatment by wei & lu ( 1999 ) . for large @xmath5 values , the breaks are not striking .",
    "the dotted line is drawn with @xmath115 , it in fact can be regarded as an isotropic fireball . the most notable difference between the solid line and the dotted line is their slope disparity in the non - relativistic phase .",
    "this is an important difference between jet and isotropic fireball , and may be useful in determining the degree of beaming .",
    "the effect of @xmath98 on the light curves is shown in figure 6 .",
    "the thick solid line is drawn with @xmath116 .",
    "the light curve with @xmath117 deviates the thick solid line only slightly .",
    "but for @xmath118 , the observed flux decreases severely . for @xmath119 ,",
    "the observed peak flux density is dimmer than that of @xmath116 by 5 mag .",
    "but fortunately , their late time behavior is very similar .",
    "so it is still possible for us to resort to systematic deep optical surveys , which are expected to find many faint afterglows not associated with any know grbs if grbs are highly collimated .",
    "figure 7 illustrates the effect of ism number density @xmath6 . according to analysis under ultra - relativistic assumption ,",
    "@xmath111 is not related to @xmath6 ( @xmath120 ) , and the peak flux density scales as : @xmath121 ( wijers & galama 1999 ; bttcher & dermer 1999 ) .",
    "figure 7 shows these patterns qualitatively .",
    "figure 7 also shows that @xmath6 affects the light curve steepening : with the increase of @xmath6 , the time that the ejecta enters the newtonian stage comes earlier , so that the light curve break becomes less and less striking .",
    "the effect of dense media on afterglows from isotropic fireballs has been discussed by dai & lu ( 1999a , b ) .",
    "figure 8 illustrates the effect of @xmath55 on the light curves . from equation  ( [ tm14 ] ) we know that @xmath111 is related to @xmath55 .",
    "our numerical results reflect the relation correctly . generally speaking ,",
    "although @xmath55 affects the slope of the light curve notably , it has minor effect on the light curve steepening .",
    "this again is very different from that of an isotropic fireball , whose timing index @xmath122 varies from @xmath123 in the relativistic phase to @xmath124 in the newtonian phase ( wijers , rees & mszros 1997 ; dai & lu 1999a , b ) , i.e. , the increment @xmath125 strongly depends on @xmath55 : @xmath126 .",
    "light curves in figure 9 are drawn under different assumptions .",
    "the solid line corresponds to a `` standard '' , `` ideal '' jet ( adiabatic ) , the dashed line corresponds to a `` realistic '' jet ( whose radiative efficiency @xmath32 evolves according to equation  ( [ eps6 ] ) ) , and the dash - dotted line corresponds to a jet without lateral expansion ( i.e. , @xmath127 ) .",
    "it is generally believed that the lateral expansion effect tends to make the light curve steepening more obvious .",
    "however , figure 9 has just shown the opposite tendency : the steepening of the dash - dotted line is obviously more striking than that of the solid line .",
    "in fact the numerical simulation by moderski , sikora & bulik ( 1999 ) also shows this tendency . from this",
    "we conclude that it is the jet edge effect that leads to the additional light curve steepening ( with respect to an isotropic fireball ) at the relativistic - newtonian transition point .",
    "the lateral expansion effect tends to reduce the steepening .",
    "figure 10 shows the evolution of the observed spectra for the `` standard '' jet . at early times",
    ", the spectrum can be divided into three segments .",
    "but at time of @xmath1 s , a fourth segment emerges .",
    "it may come from the edge effect in newtonian phase , and it is just this segment that leads to the light curve steepening .",
    "we have studied the evolution of jetted grb remnants numerically , following the convenient model developed by huang et al .",
    "( 1999c ) . in typical cases ,",
    "the remnant enters the mildly relativistic phase at time @xmath102  @xmath103 s ( i.e. , 1  10 d ) , and it will become non - relativistic at time @xmath109 s ( 37 d ) . in analytic approximation , it is usually assumed that the expansion is highly relativistic ( @xmath128 ) all the time .",
    "now we should note that these approximations are appropriate only for early afterglows ( huang et al .",
    "1998a , b , 1999a , b , c ) . due to lateral expansion , the half opening angle @xmath36 will increase with time .",
    "but the increment of @xmath36 is very small at the ultra - relativistic stage . after entering the newtonian stage ,",
    "the increase of @xmath36 is very quick .",
    "it has been predicted that due to the edge effect and the lateral expansion effect , the light curve of afterglows from jetted grb remnants should show obvious steepening during the relativistic phase , with the break point determined by @xmath25 .",
    "however , our numerical results show clearly that no steepening could be observed during _ the relativistic stage itself _ ( also see huang et al .",
    "but in many cases , a striking break does appear in the light curve at later stages , which is obviously due to the relativistic - newtonian transition .",
    "typically the power law timing index @xmath122 varies from @xmath129 to @xmath130 .",
    "the light curve break due to the relativistic - newtonian transition is affected by many parameters , such as @xmath131 and also @xmath6 .",
    "increase of any of them to a large enough value will make the break disappear .",
    "we have also demonstrated that it is the jet edge effect ( kulkarni et al .",
    "1999 ; mezros & rees 1999 ) that leads to the light curve break .",
    "the lateral expansion effect just tends to reduce the steepening ( see figure 9 ) , this may be completely unexpected to most researchers .",
    "although whether the break appears or not depends on parameters , afterglows from jetted grb remnants are uniformly characterized by a quick decay during the non - relativistic phase , with @xmath132 .",
    "this is quite different from isotropic fireballs , whose light curves steepen only slightly after entering the non - relativistic phase .",
    "it can be regarded as _ a fundamental characteristic of jets _ and may be used to judge the degree of beaming .",
    "the effect of @xmath55 on the light curve break is also very interesting . for an isotropic fireball ,",
    "if @xmath55 is as small as 2.1 , the light curve will steepen only slightly after entering the non - relativistic phase .",
    "but for a jet , if other parameters are properly assumed , we still can observe a steep break .",
    "in practical observations , if @xmath55 can be determined to be near 2 from spectral information , and if we observed a steep break in the light curve , then possibility is large that we were observing afterglows from a jet .",
    "we have shown that the afterglow from jetted grb remnant is characterized by a steep light curve ( with @xmath114 ) at late stages . however , beaming is not the only factor that leads to such a steep light curve .",
    "if the grb progenitor is a massive star , a stellar wind environment will be created , where the density scales as @xmath133 .",
    "then the afterglow light curve will also be quite steep ( chevalier & li 1999 ; halpern et al .",
    "1999 ; frail et al . 1999 ; dai & lu 1998a ) .",
    "this makes the problem even more complicated .    in practical afterglow observations",
    ", we may encounter four kinds of optical light curves : ( a ) a single flat line , with @xmath113 ; ( b ) a single steep line , with @xmath114 ; ( c ) a slightly broken curve , with @xmath122 evolves from @xmath134 to @xmath135 ; ( d ) a steeply broken curve , with @xmath122 evolves from @xmath134 to @xmath130 .",
    "let us discuss their meanings one by one :    * ( a ) * : :    * a single flat line , with @xmath113 .",
    "* in this    case , we can safely say that the ejecta is not highly beamed .",
    "grb    970508 , 971214 , 980329 and 980703 may be good examples . *",
    "( b ) * : :    * a single steep line , with @xmath114 . * this may be    due to either a highly collimated jet or an isotropic fireball in a    wind environment .",
    "we can not distinguish them solely by optical light    curve features .",
    "frail et al .",
    "( 1999 ) suggested that they can be    distinguished by radio afterglows .",
    "grb 980326 , 980519 and probably grb    970228 belong to this case . *",
    "( c ) * : :    * a slightly broken curve , with @xmath122 evolves from    @xmath134 to @xmath135 . * in this case the    ejecta should be isotropic , and the break is likely due to the    relativistic - newtonian transition of the remnant . * ( d ) * : :    * a steeply broken curve , with @xmath122 evolves from    @xmath134 to @xmath130 . * in this case , the    ejecta is probably highly collimated .",
    "the break is due to the    relativistic - newtonian transition of the jet .",
    "showing obvious breaks in the optical light curves , grb 990123 and 990510 are the most hopeful candidates for beaming . however their late time timing index are still not accurately determined , we can not definitely say that they belong to case ( c ) or ( d ) . to determine the late time index accurately , we need a well defined optical light curve with @xmath136 d. this is a difficult task .",
    "> from above discussions , we see that till now we have observed at least three kinds of optical light curves .",
    "they belong to case ( a ) , case ( b ) and case ( c ) or ( d ) respectively .",
    "this means that there are at least two kinds of grb afterglows : one corresponds to an isotropic fireball in a uniform medium ( i.e. , case ( a ) ) , the other corresponds to an isotropic fireball in a wind environment or a jet .",
    "these kinds of information can provide important clues to our understanding of grbs .",
    "for example , at least we know that @xmath8-ray emission in some grbs is isotropic , then the energy crisis is really a problem : grb 971214 and 980703 indicate isotropic energies of @xmath137 and @xmath138 respectively .",
    "systematic deep optical surveys may provide another way for determining the degree of beaming .",

    "<S> due to some refinements in the dynamics , we can follow the overall evolution of a realistic jet numerically till its bulk velocity being as small as @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> we find no obvious break in the optical light curve during the _ relativistic phase itself_. however , an obvious break does exist at the transition from the relativistic phase to the non - relativistic phase , which typically occurs at time @xmath1  @xmath2 s ( i.e. , 10  30 d ) . </S>",
    "<S> the break is affected by many parameters , such as the electron energy fraction @xmath3 , the magnetic energy fraction @xmath4 , the initial half opening angle @xmath5 , and the medium number density @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> increase of any of them to a large enough value will make the break disappear . </S>",
    "<S> although the break itself is parameter - dependent , afterglows from jetted grb remnants are uniformly characterized by a quick decay during the non - relativistic phase , with power law timing index @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> this is quite different from that of isotropic fireballs , and may be of fundamental importance for determining the degree of beaming in @xmath8-ray bursts observationally .    </S>",
