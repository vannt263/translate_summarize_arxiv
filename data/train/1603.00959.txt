    "living organisms encompass several levels of scaling / hierarchy . inside cells ,",
    "protein molecules are on the order of nanometers , and they cooperate or compete by activation or inhibition of specific biological activities .",
    "normal eukaryotic cells are on the order of @xmath6 m , and their activities are the consequence of interactions between the molecules inside of them . in multicellular systems ,",
    "each cell has a role on its own activity , and these combine to determine the interactions between the cells in the system . in nature , the number of individuals increases and decreases following the particular dynamics of that population , as characterized by their intrinsic physiologies and the interactions between the individuals .",
    "molecular biology and ecology have already elucidated certain roles for the hierarchies that are inherent in living organisms .",
    "therefore obviously it is important to know the common definition of species among different biological taxa , if we would like to compare dynamics of communities among the taxa . in particular , population , which is ranked just below the species in the hierarchy , is often defined both ecologically and demographically .",
    "krebs ( 1972)@xcite defines a population as `` a group of organisms of the same species occupying a particular space at a particular time . ''",
    "this is obviously a qualitative definition , and researchers utilize definitions of population that are appropriate in the context of their own studies . in contrast , a species has a long history for clarification of the definition .",
    "john ray had already produced a biological definition of species , in his _ historia plantarum _ ( 1686 ) : ... no surer criterion for determining species has occurred to me than the distinguishing features that perpetuate themselves in propagation from seed .",
    "thus , no matter what variations occur in the individuals or the species , if they spring from the seed of one and the same plant , they are accidental variations and not such as to distinguish a species ... animals likewise that differ specifically preserve their distinct species permanently ; one species never springs from the seed of another nor vice versa ( translated by e. silk)@xcite . although he considered species as a static image by creationism , it is important to regard his foresight to distinguish variation within species and difference between species .",
    "the idea is further expanded to a novel difference in discontinuity among spectra of selberg zeta function and zero points of riemann zeta function later in this manuscript .",
    "carl von @xmath7 described in his _ systema natur _",
    "( 1735)@xcite systematic definitions of biological taxa in different hierarchies , such as species , genus , order and class , later followed by family , phylum , kingdom and domain .",
    "he also established binomial nomenclature of scientific name . despite still in static image of species by creationism , these idea enabled qualitative estimation of relatedness among different living organisms systematically . the static image of creationism itself was doubted after the work of jean - baptiste de lamarck , _ philosophie zoologique _",
    "( 1809)@xcite , in which lamarckian inheritance was proposed .",
    "despite ignored until recent , it is re - evaluated by recent works of transgenerational epigenetic inheritance @xcite .",
    "the idea of ` evolution ' was further developed in alfred russel wallace s `` on the tendency of varieties to depart indefinitely from the original type '' ( 1858)@xcite and charles darwin s _ on the origin of species _",
    "( 1859)@xcite as natural and sexual selection .",
    "however , they still did not know what is the actual cause of speciation .",
    "gregor mendel proposed in his `` versuche @xmath8 pflanzenhybriden '' ( 1866 ) that genetic information might be important for plant hybridization and evolution@xcite , however , in the modern light the experiments he performed was achieved under hybridization of a plant species with different alleles , not actual hybrids of species .",
    "the modern definition of species is come as an evolutionary and reproductive concept , and was described by ernst mayr s _ systematics and the origin of species _ ( 1942)@xcite as follows : `` species are groups of actually or potentially interbreeding natural populations , which are reproductively isolated from other such groups '' . up until now",
    ", the essence of the difference between the concepts of population and species has been whether the concepts themselves are ecological / physical or evolutionary / genetic in nature . however",
    ", complex situations may arise in which a combined definition is required , and it may be difficult to determine whether the obtained data originated from populations or species , due to the ambiguities of the overlapping definitions @xcite @xcite . for example , ` ring species ' represent continuous phenotypic characteristics and reproductive viability between the physical neighbors , in contrast to the reproductive inviability between the physical edges of the species .",
    "this means reproductive isolation alone can not well define the proper differences in species , and it is a problem . in contrast , reports of sympatric speciation demonstrate metaphysical existence of species and speciation with discontinuity even in environmentally non - isolated situations ( e.g. barluenga et al .",
    "( 2006)@xcite ) .",
    "there is a claim that biological species concept is a mere concept that describes unification of individuals and their genotypes within the population and populations within the species , by gene exchange resulting from bisexual reproduction and migration .",
    "then the degree of this unification should be correlated with the presence of bisexual reproduction , though in reality this correlation is very low , and uniparental species often differ very little from their biparental relatives living in similar conditions .",
    "thus isolated populations of biparental species often retain their specific identity for a long time in spite of the absence of gene exchange and efficiency of migration @xcite .",
    "we partially solved the situation by decoupling short - term ecological time scale and long - term evolutionary time scale by the order of @xmath9 , at least in japanese dictyostelia @xcite .",
    "that is , populations can be `` neutral '' within themselves , but the assemblage of populations as a whole is not always neutral",
    ". therefore the time scale of species / gene flow is supposed to be entirely different from that of population / migration . in this manuscript",
    ", we would like to further clarify ` a metric ' useful for discriminating the dynamics of population / species and will use the following definitions in our analysis , which is based on actual data obtained from a natural environment .",
    "we define a population as _ a group of individuals of a sexually reproducing species inhabiting the same area and time _ , and a species as _ a sum of populations with genetically close relationships distinguishable by discontinuity of genetic distances among different species specific to each niche_. in this way , definition of species can not be disentangled from actual interactions of the constitutes of community .",
    "the history of social interactions in biology started from william donald hamilton s `` the genetical evolution of social behavior '' ( 1964)@xcite , john maynard smith s `` group selection and kin selection '' ( 1964)@xcite and george robert price s `` selection and covariance '' ( 1970)@xcite .",
    "they established genetic relatedness is important for maintaining cooperative phenotypes and evolution of living organisms .",
    "for co - evolvable non - relatives , it is important to consider reciprocal altruism to maintain the cooperations , as proposed in robert trivers s `` the evolution of reciprocal altruism '' ( 1971)@xcite . finally , multilevel selection theories , such as `` reintroducing group selection to the human behavioral sciences '' ( 1994)@xcite and _ unto others : the evolution and psychology of unselfish behavior _",
    "( 1998)@xcite , are proposed by elliott sober and david sloan wilson .",
    "the theories can explain actual cooperative selection process of individual genes distantly related within a cell / an individual as a reproduction unit .",
    "biological hierarchies are thus regarded as an important idea to analyze evolutionally process . in the other light , despite the lack of agreement among biologist , information theory ( not thermodynamics as usual ) can be used to analyze the dynamics of the concomitantly observed scales .",
    "however , the extent of ` genetically close relationships ' among species can not be distinguished easily from that of populations .",
    "therefore we would like to define a species in a newly introduced metric , especially in adaptive situation , and concluded that a geodesic @xmath2 is a successful candidate for discriminating adaptive species from chaotic population / species with @xmath3 .",
    "to this aim we need a model system for inspection .",
    "the theory of diffusion equations in population genetics by kimura ( 1964)@xcite is one of the candidate models . in the model ,",
    "genetic characteristics are used for demonstrating dynamics . despite the original genetic model , here",
    "we intend to use the ratio of the number of individuals to the whole population , instead of gene frequencies , to investigate the dynamics .",
    "this means the unification of genetic information and environmental effects to the number of individuals . in the light of the above mentions ,",
    "spatially distributed models that assume knowledge of underlying stochastic processes , usually drawn from birth / death , immigration / emigration , mutation / speciation and niche differentiation , were developed for further understanding the nature of observed populations / species ( e.g. leibold et al .",
    "( 2004)@xcite ) . in the unified neutral theory @xcite@xcite@xcite , a local community ( an ecological unit composed of a group of organisms or a population of different species occupying a particular area , usually interacting with each other and their environment ) exhibits domination of population by a few species and extinction of rarer species , compared with neutral logarithmic distribution . on the metacommunity ( a set of local communities that are linked by dispersal ) scale ,",
    "biological diversity is larger , and a nearly logarithmic distribution of population abundance in ranked species is observed .",
    "like the diffusion equation model in population genetics , the distributions depend not on individual adaptations but on random ecological drifts via a markov process @xcite@xcite , or in other words , maximizing information entropy / shannon index @xcite@xcite@xcite .",
    "idiosyncrasies @xcite seems to be involved in hubbell s theory ( see also adachi ( 2015)@xcite ) .",
    "there is also a proceeding report dealing with maxent of geographic distribution @xcite .",
    "thus the unified neutral theory is a part of information theory .",
    "the theory involves three characterizing parameters : population size , point mutation rate , and immigration rate .",
    "please note that we only utilize @xmath10 part of kimura s theory without any need of hardy - weinberg principle , independent of gene frequencies of different alleles .",
    "therefore the assumption of genetic equilibrium has nothing to do with our model",
    ". please also note that we only utilize hubbell s theory as a basis of calculating the extents of difference from ecologically neutral situations : the equilibrium here again has nothing to do with our assumptions . by modifying these theories",
    ", we were able to distinguish neutral populations with shorter time scale from adaptive species with longer time scale in a set of observed data for dictyostelia with significantly small value of immigration rate ( @xmath11)@xcite .",
    "furthermore , we are dealing only with population size of the above model , not mutation rate as in @xcite , @xcite , or immigration rate , for simplicity in order to grasp the actual dynamics in ecological time scale , not prolonged evolutionary time scale .",
    "we are also grasping the effects from both randomness of population dynamics and directionality of species dynamics in nature , not only theoretical randomness as in @xcite or theoretical directionality ( more specifically , only bose - einstein condensation ) in @xcite .",
    "later on for this introduction , the results and discussions described are entirely original ; so far as we know , there is no proceeding report dealing with the biological view proposed here . in this manuscript",
    ", we further distinguish populations and species by newly introduced parameter , ` small @xmath0 ' value that is high in a species and low in a population .",
    "first of all , we modify price equation proposed in `` selection and covariance '' ( 1970)@xcite to introduce ` small @xmath0 ' , which is based on @xmath12 theorem and weil s explicit formula in mathematics @xcite@xcite@xcite .",
    "the price equation , originally describes evolution and natural selection both in mathematics and in genetics , is here utilized in ecological way as replacing gene frequencies to proportion of the number of individuals in populations / species .",
    "the ` small @xmath0 ' is well related with covariance and expectation in the price equation .",
    "next , introducing riemann @xmath13 function leads to description of population burst / collapse as its non - trivial zero points , including typical bose - einstein condensation and non - typical types .",
    "the speciation is well related to prime numbers in this model .",
    "that is , a prime ideal stands for a status of a specific species in the system , and time - dependent multiplication of the fitness can be calculated by utilizing the primes .",
    "the border of fluctuating populations and ordered species is @xmath4 , which is proven both theoretically and by observation .",
    "then , we calculate unique equations of the model as maass form and examine spectra of the data .",
    "calculation of prime closed geodesics @xmath1 utilizing selberg zeta and hasse - weil @xmath14 leads out non - interacting adaptive species world ( an integrative space of time and other dimensions ) is in the mode @xmath2 , while interacting neutral populations is in the mode @xmath3 . combining the calculation with phylogenetical asymmetry , this discrimination gives the investigator whether the observed hierarchy of data represents chaotic populations / non - adaptive species or adaptive species in genuinely successful niche with a same regard in a particular environment .",
    "our model has also partially been successful for predicting transitions of biological phases ( adaptation / disadaptation ) at a unit time after . by utilizing schwarz equation",
    ", we also figured out the time - dependent fitness function that matches well with observations .",
    "furthermore , we will propose an original aspects of the model by different definitions of entropy from that of harte et al .",
    "( 2008)@xcite and a new definition of temperature : an integrative environmental parameter that determines the distribution of population / species deduced from logarithmic distribution of populations / species . in this manuscript , the unit of the parameter is set at cells / g as a half - intensive parameter as described in the sections of statistical mechanics .",
    "new metrics , which are based on statistical mechanics @xcite@xcite@xcite , are defined in order to distinguish and to invest significance of species from population counts of mixed communities , which is also the topic in actual eastern japanese dictyostelia community @xcite .",
    "basically the interpretations of biological systems by statistical mechanics had started from lotka ( 1922)@xcite to disastrous complexity of hamiltonian described in kerner ( 1957)@xcite , or lotka - volterra equations of n - interacting species in artificially noisy environment @xcite .",
    "kerner ( 1957)@xcite also showed an interesting model for time - developing system , however , it is not a topic for our model here with a static image mainly .",
    "his model and our model belong to different mathematical spaces , and a set of mathematically rigorous studies is required for describing their interrelationships precisely .",
    "this is different from time - dependent ecosystem assembly model that is restricted to finite markov chains proposed by @xcite or @xcite .",
    "note that we will describe non - random directionality of the model , as such based on the number theory or @xmath2 .",
    "importantly , here we were able to calculate the different sets of critical temperatures and weiss fields ( with bose - einstein condensation ) at which various natural first - order phase transitions take place among species or populations ( in definition , ` phase transitions ' here are a community moves from chaos caused by neutrality , non - adaptive situations of populations , to increase / domination by a particular species , and from increase / domination by a species to domination by a particular population within a species ) .",
    "the order parameter in this model is large @xmath15 .",

    "( 2010)@xcite as a part of relative entropy",
    ". the model can also deduce that the populations of some highly adapted species are much more stable than those of others .",
    "additionally , web - based formalism @xcite based on combination of supersymmetry and analogy to ` transactional interpretation ' of quantum mechanics leads to three - dimensional nature @xmath16 three - dimensional fluctuations = nine - dimensional nature of the model .",
    "idea of ` fitness space ' also leads out precise time - dependent ` hubble parameter ' of the space if the scale of time is properly selected .",
    "finally , introduction of hybrid inviability attributes the scale of the number of population to the hierarchies observed .",
    "recently rodrguez and colleagues reported physical frameworks of quantum principles applied to ecology ( e.g. rodrguez et al .",

    "the proposed model brings new understanding to the biological ideas of population and species based on information theory based on the data from nature ( not ` physical ' and theoretical thermodynamics as usual in bunch of papers such as @xcite , but genuinely informational ) .",
    "we named the model patch with zeta dominance ( pzdom ) model , and only by evaluating @xmath17 values will lead to distinction of chaotic population and species domination by the border @xmath4 .",
    "significance of biological hierarchies is also discussed .",

    "the methods for the observed data set were described in adachi ( 2015)@xcite . in brief , soil samples from two point quadrats of the washidu region of izu in japan were obtained . then the numbers of individual cellular slime molds per gram of soil were determined by counting the number of plaques cultivated from soil samples .",
