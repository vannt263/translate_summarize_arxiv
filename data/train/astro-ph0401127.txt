    "psr  j0205@xmath06449 was discovered in the heart of 3c  58 in _ chandra _  hrc data and immediately confirmed in archival _ rxte _ data by murray et al .",
    "camilo et al .",
    "@xcite soon thereafter found extremely faint radio pulsations from the pulsar using the new green bank telescope ( gbt ) .",
    "_ chandra _  acis - s observations taken by slane , helfand , & murray @xcite showed that the temperature of the neutron star ( ns ) is significantly below that predicted by standard ns cooling models given the very young age of the pulsar ( @xmath4yrs ) .",
    "measurement of the spin period ( 65.686ms ) and spin - down rate ( @xmath5 ) of the pulsar have allowed the estimation of several key parameters using the canonical expressions from pulsar theory :    * spin - down energy @xmath6 * surface magnetic field strength @xmath7 * characteristic age @xmath8    each of these parameters is typical for young pulsars .",
    "one unusual point is that if the pulsar really is 822yrs old and has been spinning down with the canonical braking index ( due to magnetic dipole braking ) of @xmath9 , then it must have been born spinning relatively slowly with @xmath10ms .",
    "interestingly , the 65-ms psr  j1811@xmath111925 in g11.2@xmath110.5 seems to be an identical twin in many respects ( see roberts et al . , these proceedings ) .",
    "we analyzed all available _ rxte _ pca data on 3c  58 , which totaled more than @xmath12410ks of on - source time .",
    "the data came from obsids p20259 ( @xmath1220ks ) , p60130 ( @xmath12100ks ) , and p70089 ( @xmath12300ks ) , and were taken in goodxenon mode which provided events with time resolutions of  @xmath12122@xmath13s and 256 energy channels in the energy range @xmath122@xmath1160kev .",
    "most observations were taken using 3  pcus .",
    "we processed the _",
    "rxte _ data using standard ftools in order to filter out non - level  1 events or those recorded outside of good time intervals and to convert their arrival times to the solar system barycenter ( using the de200 planetary ephemeris @xcite ) .",
    "we determined the x - ray pulse times - of - arrival ( toas ) with a maximum - likelihood technique that we developed which assumed a two - gaussian model of the x - ray pulse profile .",
    "a signal - to - noise ratio optimization procedure allowed us to determine that the best energy range to use for the timing analysis is @xmath122@xmath1116kev ( energy channels 4@xmath1139 inclusive ) , and so we filtered out events outside of this energy range ( see the profile in figure  [ fig : profile ] ) . a single time - of - arrival ( toa )",
    "typically comprised one or two _ rxte _ orbits depending on the background levels and the number of pcus on .",
    "since the observations consisted of between 4@xmath116 orbits , we measured 3@xmath114 toas each month with precisions of 100@xmath11200@xmath13s each .",
    "16kev pulse profile for psr  j0205@xmath06449 for _ rxte _ obsids p20259 , p60130 , and p70089 .",
    "the total integration time included over 400ks with 3 pcus and over 100ks with either 4 or 5 pcus .",
    "the solid grey bands show the portions of the pulse used for the phase - resolved spectroscopy described in  [ sec : spect ] with the pulse on the left and the interpulse on the right .",
    "the lightly hashed regions were used to compute the spectral background . ]",
    "the gbt data were taken with the berkeley - caltech pulsar machine ( bcpm ) backend at either 820mhz or 1400mhz .",
    "the bcpm is an analog / digital filterbank which samples each of 2@xmath1496 channels using 4-bits at flexible sampling rates and channel bandwidths @xcite .",
    "the data were recorded using 134mhz of bandwidth and 50@xmath13s samples for the 1400mhz observations or 50mhz of bandwidth and 72@xmath13s samples for the 820mhz observations .",
    "typical integrations lasted between 4@xmath118hrs .",
    "we de - dispersed and folded all of the data using the pulsar analysis package presto @xcite .",
    "each observation yielded 2@xmath113 toas which we measured by correlating ( in the frequency domain ) the folded pulse profile with a gaussian of fractional width 0.04 in phase .",
    "the typical precision of the radio toas was 200@xmath11400@xmath13s .",
    "the timing behavior and therefore the spin - down rate of psr  j0205@xmath06449 is extremely noisy .",
    "determining a phase - connected timing solution would have been impossible using the _ rxte _ or gbt data alone .",
    "thankfully , the cadence of the monthly observations in the radio and x - ray bands was sufficiently different such that the observations complemented each other and usually allowed unambiguous pulse numbering between observations .",
    "we applied time corrections to transform all the toas to utc at the solar system barycenter using faxbary and tempo for the _ rxte _ and gbt data respectively .",
    "this absolute timing shows that the x - ray main pulse is delayed relative to the radio pulse ( camilo et al .",
    ", in prep ) .",
    "we performed all timing model fits with tempo .    .",
    "the thin grey lines correspond to the average spin - down as measured during the @xmath12210 days before and after mjd  52555 .",
    "the fractional difference in spin frequency between the two timing solutions is @xmath151@xmath1410@xmath16 , which is comparable in magnitude to the glitches from the older and also `` cool '' vela pulsar . ]",
    "our data show that a `` giant '' glitch ( @xmath171@xmath1410@xmath16 ) occurred near mjd  52555 ( see figure  [ fig : glitch ] ) .",
    "the timing solution prior to the glitch consists of a 6 parameter fit ( spin frequency @xmath18 plus 5 frequency derivatives ) resulting in rms timing residuals of @xmath120.6ms .",
    "the post - glitch timing solution consists of the spin frequency plus 2 frequency derivatives resulting in rms timing residuals of @xmath121.2ms .",
    "additional frequency derivatives in the post - glitch solution improve the residuals but are not required for phase connection .",
    "the residuals from the gbt and _ rxte _ for both timing solutions are shown in figure  [ fig : resids ] .",
    "better with _",
    "( the `` x ' 's ) than with the gbt at 820mhz ( the circles ) at 1400mhz ( the squares ) per unit of telescope time .",
    "the obvious systematic trends are the result of very large levels of timing noise from the pulsar .",
    "we lost phase connection near mjd  52555 due the glitch shown in figure  [ fig : glitch ] . in both the pre- and post - glitch solutions ,",

    "figure  [ fig : spect ] shows the results of absorbed power - law fits to the phase - resolved spectra of the pulsar s main pulse and interpulse as determined using the ftool fasebin .",
    "we analyzed events from each pcu independently for each obsid , combined these for each ao , and then combined the three aos together .",
    "we fit the spectra with xspec after subtracting the average off - pulse background as shown in the hatched region in figure  [ fig : profile ] and freezing the value of @xmath19@xmath20 based on the recent _ chandra _ acis observation of 3c  58 ( slane et al .",
    ", in prep ) .",
    "fits made to the summed pcu data and simultaneously to the 5 pcus independently were consistent within the statistical errors to one another .",
    "the measured photon indices @xmath21 for the main pulse and @xmath22 for the interpulse are surprisingly hard .",
    "these values are difficult to reconcile with the @xmath23 photon index measured with _",
    "chandra _ for the central point source @xcite , although significant nebular emission within the selection region could explain some of the spectral softening .",
    "recent results from the 350ks chandra observation of 3c  58 place an approximate upper limit of @xmath24erg@xmath20s@xmath25 for any hard component in the range 0.5@xmath1110kev .",
    "but our fits to the main pulse alone predict fluxes in the same energy band at least one hundred times larger .",
    "we note that our measurements are consistent within the errors with the phase - resolved spectral fits of gotthelf @xcite ( @xmath26 for the pulsed emission ) based on the _ rxte _ data from p60130 .",

    "the best fit photon indices are surprisingly hard : @xmath29 for the main pulse and @xmath30 for the interpulse . ]",
    "with its young age , low temperature , very noisy spin - down , high @xmath31 , hard pulsed spectrum , and large glitches , the pulsar at the center of 3c  58 is certainly an object worth watching in the future . is the extremely high level of timing noise from the pulsar somehow related to its `` cool '' temperature ?",
    "are both of these strange properties related to a more fundamental characteristic of the neutron star such as its mass ?",
    "we are optimistic that continued monitoring of this unusual source will tell us something about the interior structure and internal dynamics of neutron stars .",
    "in addition , we note that the narrow pulse profile and hard spectrum of the pulsed emission from j0205@xmath06449 make it an ideal and possibly unique target for _ integral _ and other upcoming hard x - ray missions ."
