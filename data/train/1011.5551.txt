    "local models of shimura varieties are projective algebraic varieties over the spectrum of a discrete valuation ring . their singularities are supposed to model the singularities that arise in the reduction modulo @xmath0 of shimura varieties , in the cases where the level structure at @xmath0 is of parahoric type .",
    "the simplest case occurs for the modular curve with @xmath1-level structure . in this example",
    "the local model is obtained by blowing up the projective line @xmath2 over @xmath3 at the origin @xmath4 of the special fiber @xmath5 .",
    "local models for shimura varieties are defined in terms of linear algebra data inside the product of grassmann varieties , at least as far as type @xmath6 , or @xmath7 , or some cases of type @xmath8 are concerned .",
    "another version of these varieties arises as closures of schubert varieties inside the beilinson - drinfeld - gaitsgory deformation of affine flag varieties .",
    "it is the aim of this survey to discuss local models from various points of view , exhibit their connections to other classes of algebraic varieties , and give an overview of the results on them obtained in the last 15 years .",
    "why does such a survey have a place in the handbook of moduli ?",
    "the reason is that shimura varieties are often moduli spaces of abelian varieties with additional structure .",
    "therefore , determining the singularities of their reduction modulo @xmath0 is an inherent part of the theory of such moduli spaces .",
    "the archetypical example is the shimura variety attached to the group of symplectic similitudes ( and its canonical family of hodge structures ) . in this case",
    ", the shimura variety represents the moduli functor on @xmath9-schemes of isomorphism classes of principally polarized abelian varieties of a fixed dimension , equipped with a level structure . in case",
    "the @xmath0-component of this level structure is of parahoric type , there is an obvious way to extend the moduli functor to a moduli functor on @xmath10-schemes , which however will have bad reduction , unless the @xmath0-component of the level structure is _",
    "local models then serve to analyze the singularities in the special fibers of the @xmath10-models thus defined .",
    "for instance , natural questions of a local nature are whether the @xmath10-schemes that arise in this way are flat over @xmath10 , or cohen - macaulay , or what the set of branches through a point in the reduction is",
    ". all these questions , exactly because they are of a local nature , can be transferred to questions on the corresponding local models .",
    "we will not give a sketch of the historical development of the theory here .",
    "we only mention that the origin of these ideas lies in the work of deligne and pappas @xcite , of chai and norman @xcite , and of de jong @xcite on specific shimura varieties .",
    "the definitions of local models in the examples considered in these papers were formalized to some degree in the work of rapoport and zink in @xcite with the introduction of what were subsequently termed _ naive local models_. the paper @xcite of pappas pointed to the fact that naive local models are not always flat .",
    "whereas the examples of pappas arise due to the fact that the underlying group is non - split ( in fact , split only after a ramified extension ) , it was later pointed out by genestier @xcite that a similar phenomenon also occurs for split orthogonal groups .",
    "this then led to the definition of local models in the papers @xcite , as it is presented here .",
    "the local structure of local models was considered in papers by grtz @xcite , faltings @xcite , arzdorf @xcite , richarz @xcite , and others . at the same time , the combinatorics of the special fiber of local models ( in particular , the @xmath11-admissible set in the iwahori - weyl group ) , was considered in papers by kottwitz and rapoport @xcite , haines and ng @xcite , grtz @xcite , and smithling @xcite . finally , we mention the papers by gaitsgory @xcite , haines and ng @xcite , grtz @xcite , haines @xcite , and krmer @xcite , addressing the problem of determining the complex of nearby cycles for local models ( _ kottwitz conjecture _ ) .",
    "it is remarkable that local models also appear in the study of singularities of other moduli schemes . in @xcite kisin",
    "constructs a kind of birational modification scheme of the universal _ flat _ deformation of a finite flat group scheme over a discrete valuation ring of unequal characteristic @xmath12 , and shows that the singularities in characteristic @xmath0 of these schemes are modeled by certain local models that correspond to shimura varieties of type @xmath6 .",
    "another context in which local models appear is in the description of faltings @xcite of the singularities of the moduli space of vector bundles on semi - stable singular algebraic curves .",
    "the theory of local models falls fairly neatly into two parts .",
    "the first part is concerned with the local commutative algebra of local models , and the combinatorics of the natural stratification of their special fibers .",
    "this part of the theory is surveyed in the present paper .",
    "the second part is concerned with the cohomology of sheaves on local models , and will be presented in a sequel to this paper .",
    "more precisely , we will survey in a second installment the cohomology of coherent sheaves on local models ( and in particular will explain the coherence conjecture of @xcite ) , as well as the cohomology of @xmath13-adic sheaves on local models , and in particular the determination of the complex of nearby cycles .",
    "of course , both parts are interrelated by various links between them , and we will try to make this plain in the sequel to this first installment .",
    "this survey consists of three parts of a rather distinct nature . in the first part (  [ s : motivationalsection ] ) , we give two approaches to local models , each with a different audience in mind .",
    "it should be pointed out that only one of these approaches is the one with which we actually work , and which relates directly to the theory of shimura varieties , especially those which are of pel type .",
    "the other approach points to a more general theory and shows the ubiquity of local models in other contexts , but is not completely worked out at this stage ( although there is relevant work in preparation by pappas and zhu ) .    in the second part (   [ s : examples][s : combinatorics ] ) , we give an account of the results on local models that have been obtained in the last 15 years , and we highlight open questions in this area .    in the third part (   [ s : no][s : wc ] ) we explain the relation of local models to other classes of algebraic varieties , such as nilpotent orbit closures , matrix equation varieties , quiver grassmannians , and wonderful compactifications of symmetric spaces , that have been established in some cases . especially as concerns the last section , this is still largely uncharted territory , which explains why this part is of a more informal nature .",
    "we are happy to acknowledge the important contributions of k.  arzdorf ,  chai , p.  deligne , v.  drinfeld , g.  faltings , d.  gaitsgory , a.  genestier , u.  grtz , t.  haines , j.  de  jong , r.  kottwitz , l.  lafforgue , p.  norman , t.  richarz , and th .",
    "zink to the subject of the survey .",
    "in addition , we thank u.  grtz , t.  richarz , j.  schroer , and x.  zhu for their help with this survey , g.  farkas and i.  morrison for inviting us to include our text in their handbook of moduli and for putting on us just the right amount of pressure for a ( un)timely delivery , and the referee for his / her suggestions .",
    "in this motivational section , we sketch two possible approaches to local models .",
    "it is the first approach that is directly related to the original purpose of local models , which is to construct an elementary projective scheme over the ring of integers of a @xmath0-adic localization of the reflex field of a shimura variety , whose singularities model those of certain integral models of a shimura variety .",
    "unfortunately we can not make the corresponding definition in as great a generality as we would like .",
    "it is the second approach which is most easily related to the theory of algebraic groups .",
    "it is also the most elegant , in the sense that it is uniform . in a preliminary subsection we list the formal properties that we have come to expect from local models .",
    "the ideal situation presents itself as follows .",
    "let @xmath14 be a discretely valued field .",
    "we denote by @xmath15 its ring of integers and by @xmath16 its residue field which we assume to be perfect .",
    "let @xmath17 be a connected reductive group over @xmath14 , and let @xmath11 be a geometric conjugacy class of one - parameter subgroups of @xmath17 , defined over an algebraic closure @xmath18 of @xmath14 .",
    "let @xmath19 be the field of definition of @xmath11 , a finite extension of @xmath14 contained in @xmath18 ( the _ reflex field _ of the pair @xmath20 ) .",
    "finally , let @xmath21 be a parahoric subgroup of @xmath22 in the sense of @xcite , see also @xcite .",
    "these subgroups are (  up to connected component \" , see @xcite for a precise definition ) the stabilizers of points in the bruhat - tits building of the group @xmath22 .",
    "we denote by @xmath23 the smooth group scheme over @xmath24 with generic fiber @xmath17 and with connected special fiber such that @xmath25 .",
    "the existence of a canonical group scheme @xmath26 with these properties is one of the main results of @xcite .    to these data",

    "@xmath53 is the reflex field of @xmath54 .",
    "\\(iv ) let @xmath55 be a finite extension of @xmath14 contained in @xmath18 .",

    "let @xmath58 be a parahoric subgroup with @xmath59 .",
    "note that the reflex field of @xmath60 is equal to @xmath61 . under these circumstances",
    "one should expect a morphism of local models @xmath62 which induces the natural morphism @xmath63 in the generic fibers .",

    "we should point out that it is not clear that the above listed properties are enough to characterize the local models @xmath73 up to isomorphism .",
    "in fact , a general abstract ( i.e.   group theoretic \" ) definition of local models is still lacking , although , as we will explain in  1.3 , there is now some progress on this problem .",
    "we now sketch two different approaches to the concept of local models .",
    "let @xmath74 denote a shimura variety @xcite attached to the triple consisting of a connected reductive group @xmath75 over @xmath9 , a family of hodge structures @xmath76 and a compact open subgroup @xmath77 .",

    "it is then an interesting problem to define a suitable model @xmath91 of @xmath89 over @xmath92 .",
    "such a model should be projective if @xmath89 is ( which is the case when @xmath93 is @xmath9-anisotropic ) , and should always have manageable singularities . in particular , it should be flat over @xmath92 , and its local structure should only depend on the localized group @xmath94 , the geometric conjugacy class @xmath11 over @xmath95 , and the parahoric subgroup @xmath96 of @xmath97 . note that , due to the definition of a shimura variety , the conjugacy class @xmath11 is minuscule .    more precisely , we expect the local model @xmath98 to model the singularities of the model @xmath91 , in the following sense .",

    "then , in most cases , the ( non - naive ) local model is a @xmath119-invariant closed subscheme @xmath120 of @xmath116 with the same generic fiber which is brutally defined as the flat closure . the general idea then is that , from @xmath98 , one also obtains a good ( i.e at least flat ) integral model @xmath91 of the shimura variety via the cartesian diagram @xmath121 \\ar[d ]           & [ m^{\\rm loc }   /\\mathcal g_{\\mathcal o_{e_\\wp } } ] \\ar[d ] \\\\        \\mathcal s^{\\rm naive}_{\\bold k } \\ar[r ]           & [ m^{\\rm naive }   /\\mathcal g_{\\mathcal o_{e_\\wp } } ] .     } \\ ] ] unfortunately , in general , the schemes @xmath98 and @xmath91 , do not have a reasonable moduli theoretic interpretation . nevertheless , there are still ( proven or conjectural ) moduli descriptions in many interesting cases @xcite .",
    "all these issues are explained in more detail in  [ s : examples ] .",
    "we mention here that taking the expected functorialities ( i)(v ) of local models into account , we may , in constructing a local model for the data @xmath122 , make the following hypotheses .",
    "we may assume that the adjoint group of @xmath17 is simple ; we may extend scalars to an unramified extension @xmath14 of @xmath123 .",
    "if we insist that @xmath11 be minuscule , this reduces the number of possible cases to an essentially finite list .",
    "let us explain this in more detail .",
    "we assume @xmath124 is simple and denote by @xmath125 the corresponding minuscule cocharacter of @xmath126 .",
    "let @xmath127 be the completion of the maximal unramified extension of @xmath123 ; by steinberg s theorem every reductive group over @xmath127 is quasi - split .",

    "for example , see the case of @xmath184 in  [ s : examples].[ss : resgl_n ] below .",
    "however , we expect that most properties of local models for a group which is the restriction of scalars @xmath183 will only depend on @xmath129 , the degree of @xmath36 over @xmath127 , the combinatorial data describing @xmath185 and the type ( conjugacy class ) of the parahoric subgroup @xmath186 ( and not on the particular choice of the field @xmath36 )",

    "we will not attempt to fully reproduce his ( ingenious ! ) construction in this survey , but here is an idea .",
    "faltings starts with the following observation : if @xmath369 is a discrete valuation ring , then an @xmath369-valued point @xmath1602 of the local model @xmath33 gives a sequence of free @xmath369-modules @xmath1603 of rank @xmath363 .",

    "note that the local model @xmath33 and all its proper modifications @xmath736 that share the same generic fiber , also share the same set of @xmath369-valued points for a discrete valuation ring @xmath369 .",
    "we can now view the search for a suitable birational modification @xmath1604 as a search for a suitable parameter space of lattice arrangements as above .",
    "observe that to any such lattice arrangement we can associate its corresponding _",
    "deligne scheme _",
    "@xmath1605 over @xmath373 ( which is a type of local model on its own ) cf .",
    "@xcite , @xcite . a suitable blow - down of the deligne scheme",
    "gives a  minimal \" model @xmath1606 with toroidal singularities .",
    "now parameters for a space of lattice arrangements can be obtained by looking at moduli of these minimal deligne schemes .",
    "more specifically , faltings constructs a universal family of lattice arrangements that supports a universal minimal deligne scheme .",
    "the base of this family is a projective equivariant embedding of the homogeneous space @xmath1607 .",
    "it turns out that this embedding is of the kind considered by lafforgue .",
    "as explained in remark [ rem : lafforgue ] above , this can then be used to obtain modifications of the local models .",
    "for example , when @xmath1601 , the deligne scheme is a projective flat curve over @xmath373 with generic fiber @xmath1608 and special fiber a chain of @xmath1608 s intersecting transversely ( our first local model for @xmath1609 in example [ exn=2 ] is such an example of a deligne scheme ) .",
    "the minimal model @xmath1606 now gives a semi - stable curve over @xmath373 and we can parametrize the lattice arrangement by a corresponding point of the moduli space of genus @xmath4 semi - stable marked curves . in this case ,",
    "faltings construction produces a smooth compactification of @xmath1610 and hence also a regular equivariant modification of the corresponding local model for @xmath1611 and the periodic lattice chain with @xmath135 members .",
    "see also @xcite for some more recent developments in this circle of ideas .",
    "[ rem : wcsympl ] in @xcite , faltings gives a construction of resolutions of local models in some cases related to other groups .",
    "this is done by working with explicit schemes of matrices that give affine charts for @xmath33 , and relating those to wonderful completions .",
    "this then leads to resolutions for these affine charts .",
    "one can then obtain equivariant resolutions of the corresponding local models as in theorem [ thm : resolution ] ( note however that the special fibers of these resolutions are not always reduced ) .",
    "we conclude this section with a list of some matrix equations which are among those investigated by faltings @xcite . before doing so , we make two remarks .",
    "first of all , even though some of the matrix equations that faltings writes down are among the ones discussed in  [ s : matrix ] ( e.g. , @xmath1335 in appears in the middle of p.  194 in @xcite , and @xmath736 of , resp",
    ".   occurs in the middle of p.  195 in @xcite ) , and therefore are closely related to local models , this is less clear for others .",
    "in fact , his list arises from embedding symmetric spaces in projective spaces via homogeneous line bundles , and considering the singularities which occur in their closures ",
    "so there is a priori no connection to local models .",
    "secondly , faltings is less interested in questions of flatness , but rather allows himself to pass to the flat closure of the generic fiber , i.e. ,  to the affine variety with coordinate ring obtained by dividing out by @xmath101-torsion , and then tries to construct resolutions of those .",
    "again we fix @xmath314 with uniformizer @xmath101 .",
    "one matrix equation considered in @xcite is @xmath1612 where @xmath1613 is the adjoint of @xmath6 with respect to a symmetric or a symplectic form .",
    "faltings proves that , when @xmath138 is even , the flat closure of @xmath1614 inside @xmath1335 is cohen - macaulay with rational singularities .",
    "when @xmath138 is odd , the flat closure of @xmath1614 inside @xmath1335 is not cohen - macaulay , but its normalization is , with rational singularities .",
    "furthermore , he gives equivariant resolutions of these flat @xmath314-schemes which have a normal crossings divisor as their special fibers , and computes the multiplicities of the irreducible components .    in a similar vein ,",
    "faltings also analyzes the intersection of @xmath1335 with the locus where @xmath1615 , i.e.,@xmath1616 when @xmath1613 is the adjoint of @xmath6 for a symmetric form , this matrix equation relates to local models for the ramified unitary group , and the maximal parahoric subgroup fixing a selfdual lattice , comp . .",
