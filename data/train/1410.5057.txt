    "geometric phase originates due to cyclic time evolution of an hamiltonian .",
    "this phase can be distinguished from the usual dynamical phase by its dependence on the quantum level structure of the system and the form of the time evolution of the involved hamiltonian .",
    "although geometric phase depends on the quantum level structure , it is independent of the energy eigenvalues . therefore it is largely conceived as immune to external perturbations and hence a good quantum computation resource @xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite .",
    "any quantum computation at its basic level requires quantum gates for both single and two qubits . in order to perform reliably as a component of a quantum computation system , these quantum gates needs to have an error generation probability of @xmath0 , which is known as fault tolerant threshold ( ftt)@xcite . so far the only single qubit operation that has shown such kind of ftt is based on an ion trap experiment @xcite .",
    "@xcite proposed a protocol based on spin phonon interaction which has the potential to beat the ftt . however ,",
    "their analysis is specific to the proposed qubit system . geometric phase , being inherently robust to external field fluctuations , provide a likely resource which can be exploited to create quantum gates having such ftt . + in general",
    ", the robustness of geometric phase is an inherent property of the mechanics itself .",
    "therefore understanding the origin of such robustness in the context of geometric phase in spin system can allow more controllability on such geometric phase gates .",
    "any universal quantum computation will need single and two qubit gates which are both abelian and non - abelian in nature@xcite . in most cases , studies on geometric phases",
    "are restricted to either of these two regimes @xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite .",
    "here we put forward a study in which we can go from abelian to non - abelian regime in the same spin system by slowly breaking the symmetry of the system .",
    "analysis of such a system not only provides insights into the underlying physical processes governing each of the limits but also effectively probes the limits of the adiabatic theorem @xcite,@xcite and the relation of adiabaticity and non - abelian behaviour . this is relevant as most of the quantum states are operated in the super - adiabatic regime @xcite .",
    "our analysis also provides room for identifying the relevant parameters which influence the phase fluctuation in different regimes .",
    "in @xcite , berry formulated the form of geometric phase under adiabatic approximation as    @xmath1    for the @xmath2th eigenstate .",
    "the quantity @xmath3 is called the gauge of the evolution because it remains invariant under any similarity transformation , except those involving the variable of the evolution themselves .",
    "this definition of the scalar gauge holds only for non - degenerate levels . for degenerate levels ,",
    "the definition is generalized to a matrix gauge @xmath4 , where @xmath5 and @xmath2 belong to the degenerate subspace @xcite .",
    "+ the adiabatic form of geometric phase can also be derived from the adiabatic theorem .",
    "the probability amplitude of an eigenstate belonging to a time dependent hamiltonian varies as    @xmath6    where the states @xmath5 and @xmath2 are non - degenerate and @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the dynamical phases .",
    "the above equation governs the time dependence of the amplitudes of the states , beyond the dynamical contribution . under adiabatic approximation , @xmath9 and hence the second term in eq .",
    "[ basic_eq ] can be neglected in comparison to the first term .",
    "thus for adiabatic evolution , there is no mixing of the different eigenstates .",
    "however , as a consequence of the time dependence of the hamiltonian , there is an additional phase , on top of the dynamical phase , governed by @xmath10 . under the conditions of implicit time dependence",
    ", this term leads to the underlying gauge of geometric phase as derived by berry . in the following sections we expand the ideas of abelian and non - abelian evolution and their corresponding gauges . + * abelian : * abelian evolution corresponds to evolution without any population transfer .",
    "for a non - degenrate set of levels , under adiabatic condition , all evolutions are abelian , since adiabaticity guarantees lack of population transfer or mixings .",
    "degenerate levels can also have abelian evolutions , if the underlying gauge matrix corresponding to the degenerate subspace is diagonal . + * non - abelian : * on the contrary , non - abelian evolutions inherently introduces mixing of states or population transfer between the states . for a degenerate subspace ,",
    "if the off - diagonal elements of the gauge matrix are nonzero , then the evolution is considered as non - abelian @xcite .",
    "however , degeneracy itself does nt guarantee non - zero off diagonal elements .",
    "a subspace of non - degenerate levels , under certain evolutions can have non - zero off diagonal elements .",
    "however , conditions imposed by adiabaticity does nt leave room for population transfer in such cases and the off - diagonal elements have no physical significance under such conditions .",
    "this can be easily demonstrated from eq .",
    "[ basic_eq ] as the coupling term drops off because of finite strength of the oscillatory function and the relatively smaller coupling strength in the adiabatic limit . + * non - abelian to abelian transition : * the primary goal of this work is to see how a system responds if it is taken in a continuous manner from non - abelian to abelian evolution and vice versa . to achieve this , we need an evolution with degeneracies and focus on non - abelian degenerate subspaces .",
    "now , if we can introduce non - degeneracy into the system , without changing the underlying geometry and hence the gauge matrix of the evolution , then we can observe the physical significance of the off - diagonal elements slowly diminishing and vanishing in the abelian regime .",
    "thus the primary goal is to study the dynamics of the off - diagonal elements with respect to the symmetry breaking field .",
    "this also allows us to probe the adiabatic theorem the limits of which , under the influence of a symmetry breaking field has long been debated@xcite,@xcite + .",
    "the system we work with is a spin system interacting with electro - magnetic fields .",
    "even though we are interested in the @xmath11 state of ba@xmath12 ion interacting with a rotating electric field gradient @xcite , all the discussion made here holds true for any spin @xmath13 system .",
    "we choose the electric field to be zero to avoid monopolar interaction .",
    "the dipole moment of this state is zero because of the definite parity of the states and hence we choose the electric quadrupole moment . electric quadrupole moment interact with electric field gradient . to generate geometric phases , the electric field gradient",
    "is taken to be time dependent .",
    "the time dependence is such that the principle axes describe a conical path about the degeneracy point as shown in fig .",
    "the spin @xmath13 interacting with the electric field gradient maintains a time reversal symmetry and hence there are kramer s degeneracies in the system , i.e. , @xmath14 and @xmath15 states form two pairs of degenerate subspaces .",
    "the hamiltonian of quadrupole interaction has @xmath16 terms and hence couples the @xmath14 substates .",
    "thus the @xmath14 subspace undergoes non - abelian evolution .",
    "the hamiltonian however can not couple @xmath15 states , which have a @xmath17 and thus can not be coupled by the quadratic terms in angular momentum operator .",
    "hence the @xmath15 subspace undergoes abelian evolution .",
    "this however is true only for the quadrupole approximation which limits the field expansion to @xmath18 terms only .",
    "+ to induce the non - abelian to abelian transition , we now apply a time dependent magnetic field along with the electric field gradient .",
    "the magnetic field lifts the degeneracy of the system and hence drives the system away from non - abelian behaviour .",
    "however , for a true transition from non - abelian to abelian , the underlying gauge is required to be the same in the presence of the magnetic field .",
    "this is achieved by making the magnetic field rotate along with the electric field gradient .",
    "this preserves the geometry of the system even in the presence of the magnetic field as",
    "the quantization axis remains unchanged .",
    "geometry in this context implies the transformation which connects the diagonal basis of the hamiltonian with the stationary basis . because of this constancy of geometry , the underlying gauge of the evolution remains invariant . in the following sections a detailed theoretical description of the system s evolution under the influence of the time varying field",
    "will be derived .",

    "the hamiltonian for a quadrupole moment- electric field gradient interaction is given as    @xmath19    where @xmath20 is the @xmath21th component of the quadrupole moment and is defined for spin systems as @xmath22 .",

    "the two doubly degenerate subspaces consists of @xmath30 corresponding to eigenvalue @xmath27 and @xmath31 corresponding to eigenvalue @xmath32 . now to obtain the gauge matrices corresponding to these sets of states through the relation @xmath4 , the wavefunctions in the stationary frame are required .",
    "however , for the ease of calculation , we use the wigner d matrices to obtain the wavefunctions in the stationary basis from the rotating basis , which is also the diagonal basis for the hamiltonian .",
    "the wigner d matrices are the transformations which connect these two bases .",
    "the respective gauge matrices are-    @xmath33 and @xmath34 .    from the matrices",
    ", we can see that for the subspace @xmath31 , we have non - zero off - diagonal elements . hence the degenerate subspace @xmath31 follows non - abelian evolution . in the non - abelian regime ,",
    "the eigengauge is given by the eigenvalues of the gauge matrix , @xmath35 .",
    "* abelian regime : * to transfer the system from non - abelian regime to abelian regime , we apply a degeneracy lifting magnetic field . however , to make any comparison between the two situations , we require the geometry of the system to remain invariant in the presence of the magnetic field .",
    "more precisely , the connection between the diagonal basis and the stationary frame , which is the wigner d matrices , should remain the same in the presence or absence of magnetic field .",
    "the effective hamiltonian in the abelian regime is given by @xmath36    the eigenvalue of the @xmath31 subspace now becomes @xmath37 .",
    "however , the gauge matrix does not change , as the geometry is kept invariant . + in the abelian configuration ,",
    "the adiabatic theorem leads us to conclude that the off diagonal elements of the gauge matrix corresponding to these set of states , do not contribute in the physical manifestation of the phase . in this regime ,",
    "the underlying gauge is simply @xmath38 corresponding to the two states .    * non - abelian to abelian transition : * in the two regimes of evolution , the states , @xmath14 , are governed by two different underlying gauges given by @xmath39 for non - abelian and @xmath38 for abelian . the physical manifestation of the gauges is obtained through phase dependent energy shifts given by @xmath40 .",
    "thus the variation of the energy level shifts , on top of the energy eigenvalue , while going from non - abelian to abelian is the primary signature of such a transition .    in the true adiabatic regime ( @xmath41 ) , even the smallest value of @xmath42 will drive the system from non - abelian to abelian .",
    "however , for finite values of @xmath29 , the system is governed by two timescales , one depends on @xmath29 , the rotational frequency of the fields and the other depends on @xmath42 , which determines the splitting between the @xmath14 states . for @xmath29 finite , abelian regime",

    "unlike the systems studied so far , the system we constructed above allows us to move continuously between the non - abelian and abelian regimes . in the previous section we saw that by moving the system from non - abelian to abelian regime , the off - diagonal elements loses their physical significance .",
    "continuous tunability of our system allows us to investigate the dynamics of the off diagonal elements with respect to symmetry breaking field , in this case the magnetic field .",

    "in this work we have performed an extensive study of a system as it is continuously moved from abelian regime to non - abelian regime . although it was known that abelian regime is signified by non transfer of population and non - abelian system by population transfer , we have for the first time shown the dynamics of the system with respect to a symmetry breaking field , driving the system from one regime to another .",
    "+ the dressed state approach revealed the exact dynamics of the system and at the same time allowed us to probe the underlying mechanisms a play using the method of perturbation .",
    "+ the perturbative approach also helped us to gain insight into robustness of geometric phase to external parameter fluctuations .",
    "as can be seen the non - abelian limit is more susceptible to magnetic field fluctuations whereas abelian limit is prone to fluctuations arising from angular frequency fluctuations .",
    "thus a detailed understanding of abelian and non - abelian evolutions and the behaviour off the system in between can in turn lead to better designing of architecture for implementation of quantum computation protocols .",
