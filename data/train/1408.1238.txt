    "the problem of defining a proper notion of time in quantum gravity is one of its most puzzling questions , common to the different existing approaches @xcite . from a physical point of view",
    ", the relational approach @xcite appears very promising , especially when matter is included in quantum dynamics .",
    "in fact , as discussed in @xcite a dualism exists between a dust fluid and the time evolution of the quantum gravitational field .",
    "however , such a promising approach has a weak point , concerning the nonpositive character of the super - hamiltonian spectrum in comparison with the intrinsic positive energy density associated to a dust fluid .",
    "the possibility to interpret the super - hamiltonian eigenvalues as the comoving contribution @xmath0 ( @xmath1 being the dust energy density and @xmath2 the three - metric determinant ) allows interesting speculations @xcite on the role played in quantum gravity by a reference frame : no longer a simple gauge reparametrization of the dynamics , but a real source involved in the system evolution , _ i.e. _ a quantum violation of the general relativity principle @xcite .",
    "such a dualism between a dust fluid and a clock has a mandatory implementation in quantum cosmology , where the nonvanishing super - hamiltonian spectrum must provide , on the classical limit , a dustlike cosmological component of the universe , also investigated as a possible dark matter candidate @xcite .",
    "here we provide a self - consistent picture of the quantum evolution of the early universe , as described in the framework of evolutionary quantum gravity , showing how the resulting dust component has a positive energy density and its contribution to the universe critical parameter is redshifted by the inflationary scenario to unobservable values .",
    "we consider a homogeneous and isotropic flat universe , endowed with a negative cosmological constant and a massive scalar field , well mimicking the preinflationary behavior of the inflaton field @xcite in a model with a decay from a false vacuum ( see @xcite for the comparison of this scenario with experimental data ) .",
    "we analyze the quantum evolution of this cosmological model according to a revised wheeler - dewitt approach which allows for a time evolution of the universe wave function , as determined by a schrdinger prescription . by an adiabatic approximation",
    ", we show how the considered quantum dynamics has a well - defined classical limit and at early stages predicts a nonsingular behavior ( removing the initial singularity ) , in close analogy to a big - bounce structure in the limit of very small universe volumes .",
    "furthermore , we calculate the full spectrum of the super - hamiltonian , which is associated to a positive value of the dual dust energy density , but with the shortcoming of an unbounded - from - below profile of the eigenvalues .    to remove the unpleasant feature of an unstable quantum system which does not possess a ground state",
    ", we treat the universe volume as a discrete variable in the polymer quantum approach @xcite . as a result ,",
    "the positive nature of the spectrum is altered ( states corresponding to negative dust energy density appear ) , but a stable ground state emerges in correspondence to very high occupation numbers .",
    "such a ground ( vacuum ) state is associated to a positive dust energy density and it is suitable to implement a quasiclassical limit of the dynamics .",
    "in fact , in the limit @xmath3 , the high occupation number of this ground state ensures finite energy density , which is of planckian value if the discretization parameter of the polymer approach is taken of the planck length order .",
    "it is worth stressing how the value of the negative cosmological constant does not enter the ground state eigenvalue and it can be taken sufficiently small to ensure a turning point of the universe in the far future ( de facto the presented model describes a cyclic universe , possessing a future classical turning point and a bounce in the past ) .    in the proposed scheme ,",
    "the preinflationary universe emerges as the classical limit of an evolutionary quantum dynamics and it is endowed by a dust energy density ( relic of the quantum clock ) which is then redshifted to very small values by the subsequent de sitter phase .",
    "we stress how the dust contribution , differently from the ordinary matter , can not be restored by the inflaton decay during the reheating phase and its fate is an increasing dilution up to present unobservable amounts . in other words , the impossibility to observe today the matter counterpart of the evolutionary quantum gravity model is explained in the same spirit as the `` unwanted relic paradox '' is solved by inflation @xcite .",
    "therefore , we provide a very promising cosmological implementation of the evolutionary quantum gravity , thought as the intrinsic matter - time dualism , which relies on the existence of a regular ground state of the universe , endowed with appropriate properties for a regular classical limit . in summary",
    ", while the problem of introducing a reliable time variable in quantum gravity is clearly an open question , and many competitive approaches stand in literature @xcite , we emphasize how the present analysis enforces the idea that the time - fluid dualism admits intriguing cosmological applications , as already inferred in @xcite . in fact , the most significant difficulty of such a relational approach is the nonpositive nature of the super - hamiltonian spectrum , resulting in the nonpositive energy density of the fluid .",
    "we propose as solution the restriction of such a requirement to the ground state of the theory only . here",
    ", we achieve a positive regularized `` vacuum '' state for the model , via the introduction of a negative cosmological constant , but its validity can be more general . in this sense ,",
    "the matter - time dualism possesses a nice feature in the cosmological paradigm , which upgrades its reliability , making it of comparable impact to the well - known multitime approach @xcite , which is very powerful for characterizing the cosmological evolution in terms of the universe volume as time variable .",
    "the present paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ ii ] we present the framework of evolutionary quantum gravity in a minisuperspace context ; in sec .",
    "[ iibis ] we give some physical arguments on why we consider an evolutionary quantum cosmology and a negative cosmological constant ; in sec .",
    "[ iii ] we introduce the cosmological model and we solve the associated evolutionary schrdinger equation in the early- and late - time limits ; in sec .",
    "[ iv ] we perform polymer quantization as @xmath4 and we outline the emergence of a bounded - from - below energy spectrum . finally , in sec .",
    "[ v ] brief conclusions follow .",
    "one of the most promising approaches to the problem of time in quantum gravity relies on the dualism existing between a dust fluid and a physical clock @xcite . here",
    "we briefly discuss this correspondence in the framework of the minisuperspace , _",
    "i.e. _ as restricted to the case of homogeneous cosmological models",
    ".    the cosmological implementation of the wheeler - dewitt equation corresponds to dealing with a finite number of degrees of freedom , say @xmath5 ( @xmath6 ) generalized coordinates , representing scale factors of the universe and matter fields .",
    "the dynamics of the model is summarized by the classical system hamiltonian @xmath7 , @xmath8 being the conjugate momenta to the generalized coordinates . implementing an evolutionary quantum dynamics for the considered homogeneous model , in place of the standard wheeler - dewitt frozen formalism @xcite ,",
    "consists of assuming that the universe wave function @xmath9 evolves with respect to an external parameter @xmath10 , which plays the role of a physical clock ; _ i.e. _ we take @xmath11 .",
    "the evolution of the system is then naturally determined by the schrdinger equation @xmath12 where @xmath13 denotes the lapse function and @xmath14 is the operator version of the super - hamiltonian . by taking the wave function in the following integral representation @xmath15 the schrdinger equation above",
    "is associated to the time independent eigenvalue problem @xmath16 @xmath17 being the super - hamiltonian eigenvalue .",
    "as far as we take the classical limit , for @xmath18 , by setting the wave function as @xmath19 , the eigenvalue problem above takes the form of an hamilton - jacobi equation , containing an additional matter contribution @xmath20 , @xmath21 being the jacobi function .",
    "since the hamiltonian is a scalar density of weight @xmath22 , to get an energy density , we need to divide this new contribution by the universe volume @xmath23 ( @xmath2 being the three - metric determinant ) and hence we get @xmath24 , which clearly describes a dust comoving fluid .",
    "the clock - dust - fluid dualism is well expressed in quantum cosmology by the correspondence traced above between the super - hamiltonian spectrum and the energy density of the dust emerging in the classical limit of the evolutionary quantum picture .",
    "the limit of this analogy is in the nonpositive nature of the super - hamiltonian spectrum , which prevents us from ensuring an always positive dust energy density .",
    "indeed , we stress how , invoking a minimal energy principle for the quantum universe , the request of a positive dust fluid energy density must be transferred to such a ground ( vacuum ) state only . in this respect , we finally observe how the value of the emerging contribution @xmath25 depends directly on the boundary conditions , characterizing the considered cosmological model , which fixes the ground state eigenvalue . as a result , it is not immediately recognizable that the constraint ensuring that the emerging dust behaves as a test fluid . in this sense",
    ", the emerging energy density must be regarded as the physical substantiation of the comoving reference frame . in other words ,",
    "an evolutionary quantum cosmology predicts , in the classical limit , the existence of a natural preferred comoving reference frame , unavoidably affecting the quantum evolution of the system . despite the fact that the coordinate reparametrization of the adopted scheme is still allowed",
    ", the present scenario can be interpreted as quantum breaking of the general relativity principle @xcite .",
    "we now address two subtle features at the ground of our model , which are indeed intrinsically connected to each other , _ i.e. _ the implementation of an evolutionary quantum cosmology and the presence of a negative cosmological constant in the universe dynamics .",
    "clearly , the solution of the problem of time is one of the open questions in quantum gravity , both for what concerns the nature of the field , materializing the clock , and also for the properties time must possess on a classical regime , as well as on a quantum regime .",
    "this problem was interestingly addressed in @xcite , where the relation between defining a time and defining a reference frame in quantum gravity are related concepts .",
    "for some attempts to characterize the time variable as a relational clock having peculiar properties , like a monotonic behavior , see @xcite . however , one of the most interesting points of view on this topic , different from the one here proposed , is the so - called multitime approach @xcite , in which it is emphasized how the gravitational field has to be separated into its two real physical degrees of freedom , while the remaining part of the space geometry labels the evolution . for a review of the various viable approaches to the problem of time in quantum gravity and a discussion of their successes and shortcomings , see @xcite",
    "( see also @xcite ) . however , as discussed in the previous section , the dualism between an external time and the presence of a dust fluid in the quantum dynamics is a well - established fact .",
    "the physical nature of time depends on the details of the considered model and it relies on the link existing between the super - hamiltonian eigenvalue and the dust energy density @xcite . in the present analysis we avoid the specification of a particular framework , making essentially reference to the schrdinger - like dynamics of the universe wave function , because on a cosmological setting the physical output of an evolutionary approach is just the emergence of a new matter contribution to the thermal bath of the universe .",
    "such an additional matter density defines also a new reference frame , which is , to some extent , a preferred one , in view of its non - test - fluid character .",
    "hence , it is clear how the question concerning the positive value of the emerging dust energy density ( a central theme in the matter - time dualism in quantum gravity ) is crucial when reconstructing the universe thermal history @xcite .",
    "it is just the request to deal with a fully negative spectrum of the super - hamiltonian ( fully positive dust energy density ) which leads us to involve a negative cosmological constant in the dynamics . in",
    "so doing we get a contribution in the hamiltonian which corresponds to a harmonic oscillator energy , but with a global negative sign .",
    "such a feature has a rather general validity ( see sec . [ v ] ) since , even for a generic inhomogeneous cosmological model the kinetic contribution of the universe volume to the hamiltonian , together with the negative cosmological constant term , provides the same harmonic - oscillator structure .",
    "however , such a contribution implies an unstable behavior of the full hamiltonian operator , whose spectrum is unbounded from below .",
    "the regularization is performed via a polymer quantum treatment of the universe scale factor ( say the universe volume ) .",
    "such a regularization procedure provides a well - defined ground state , having the right negative eigenvalue for getting a viable phenomenology . in other words ,",
    "as proposed in @xcite , we are implementing the idea that , on a quantum level , it is enough to require that the dust energy density corresponding to the ground state be positive in order to get a reliable physical model .",
    "it is worth stressing how the ground state eigenvalue is surprisingly unaffected by the value of the negative cosmological constant [ see ] and , therefore , @xmath26 is freely available for the cosmological problem and it can be properly fixed to a very small value , whose dynamical role will be only to provide a turning point in the far future .",
    "the negative cosmological term , here considered , has no `` interference '' with the present phenomenon of universe acceleration @xcite , whose origin could be due to a positive cosmological constant @xcite , but also to other physical mechanisms ( as for instance quintessence paradigms @xcite ) .",
    "this effect is indeed a late evolutionary feature of the universe , almost uncorrelated with the domain of validity of this study .",
    "furthermore , a positive cosmological constant term would not guarantee the spectral features traced above .",
    "however , motivations for including a negative cosmological constant in the universe dynamics can be found in many modern fundamental theories , such as supersymmetry @xcite and ads / cft correspondence @xcite .    finally , we stress how , independently of the dust energy density origin ( a nonvanishing eigenvalue for the super - hamiltonian or a matter clock involved in the dynamics ) the corresponding cosmological evolution could have a deep phenomenological impact on the present universe .",
    "we demonstrate that this contribution , associated to the regularized ground state eigenvalue , admits a reliable classical limit and then it is redshifted by the inflation _ e_-folding , leaving no measurable trace on the observed universe .",
    "let us consider a preinflationary universe described by a flat friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) metric , whose metric is ( we work in units @xmath27 ) @xmath28 with @xmath29 and a massive noninteracting scalar field @xmath30 , modeling the inflaton trapped into a false vacuum .",

    "the evolutionary quantum equation associated with ( [ eq : wdw_initial ] ) reduces to an eigenvalue equation for the hamiltonian ( [ eq : h_rho ] ) @xmath44      let us address a born - oppenheimer approximation ( to be verified _ a posteriori _ ) , in which we construct the wave function as the product of the following two terms @xmath45 in which @xmath46 describes the scalar field wave function and depends parametrically on @xmath1 , while @xmath47 is the universe wave function .",

    "we must then impose that @xmath53 takes only odd values in @xmath60 , corresponding to a wave function node ( [ eq : psi ] ) in @xmath61 , and consider only the values @xmath62 . ]    in the same way , we impose @xmath63\\chi_{k}\\left(\\rho,\\,\\phi\\right)=\\frac{2\\rho^{2}}{\\hbar}e^\\phi_k\\chi_{k}\\left(\\rho,\\,\\phi\\right),\\label{eq : osc_arm_chi}\\ ] ] whose solution reads @xmath64 where @xmath65 with eigenvalues given by @xmath66 the solution of ( [ eq : h_rho ] ) is to be considered in the context of a theory of small oscillations of the scalar field around the minimum of its potential . in this way the scalar field can not explore the complete profile of the potential @xmath67 , and this makes the quantum number @xmath68 confined in a limited interval whose upper limit depends on the parameters of the model .    in the appendix",
    "we demonstrate that an approximated solution of the eigenvalue equation ( [ eq : wdw - evolutionary ] ) is given by the product of the functions ( [ eq : zeta_n ] ) and ( [ eq : chi_k ] ) for @xmath69 , _ i.e. _ @xmath70 with associated eigenvalue @xmath71 therefore , in the late - time limit @xmath69 , the born - oppenheimer approximation ( [ eq : psi ] ) is well grounded for energy eigenstates .",

    "the energy eigenvalues are @xmath163 it is worth noting how in our case the condition @xmath164 holds , since we have @xmath165 where we fixed the polymer scale @xmath166 .",
    "the condition above is an intrinsic consistency condition for our model , since if it was violated then the negative cosmological constant would drive the universe evolution from the planck time up to now .",
    "hence , we can expand the characteristic values in powers of @xmath155 near @xmath167 , so getting @xmath168 such that the energy spectrum becomes @xmath169 it is worth noting how the spectrum exhibits a minimum corresponding to @xmath170 therefore , the dynamical system is now endowed with a ground state , corresponding to the minimum energy eigenvalue , and one can assume the universe to dynamically relax into such a state .",
    "furthermore , the minimum eigenvalue is negative and the dual dust field energy density is positive ; thus it behaves as an ordinary dust field contribution .",
    "let us now estimate the additional term in ( [ eq : pqm - h ] ) . by performing the fourier transform of mathieu functions it is possible to describe the eigenfunctions ( [ matce ] ) and ( [ matse ] ) in the coordinate representation .",
    "we consider only the mathieu sine periodic functions , since the same estimate can be repeated for the cosine , and with odd index , since nothing changes for an even one . hence , @xmath171 can be expanded as follows @xmath172,\\label{eq : se_n dispari},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath173 are fourier coefficients for which @xmath174 the normalized energy eigenstates @xmath175 , for which @xmath176 , can thus be expanded in terms of @xmath177 as follows : @xmath178 inverse powers of @xmath1 can be regularized in polymer representation using the expression @xcite @xmath179 which provides for @xmath180 @xmath181 hence , the expectation value of the additional term in ( [ eq : pqm - h ] ) on energy eigenstates reads @xmath182 where we used the condition ( [ compl ] ) .",
    "let us note that @xmath183 and thus @xmath184 such that for the expression ( [ deltah ] ) one has @xmath185 the ratio @xmath186 of this term with the ground state energy eigenvalue reads @xmath187 and it tells us if the additional term is actually a small perturbation or not .",
    "for instance , we can require @xmath188 , so getting @xmath189    we see how the smaller the value of @xmath131 , the more accurate the energy spectrum we got in polymer representation .",
    "we presented a self - consistent cosmological picture , based on the implementation of an evolutionary quantum gravity approach to a reliable model of the primordial isotropic universe .",
    "indeed , we construct a nonsingular cosmology , corresponding to a cyclic universe , having a quantum big bounce in the past , associated to the details of its quantum dynamics , and a late turning point , due to the presence of a small negative cosmological constant .",
    "the main issue of the analysis above consists in determining , via a polymer quantum approach , a ground state of the universe , associated to a positive dust energy density and to a high occupation number .",
    "for such a vacuum state of the model , it is possible to construct a reliable classical limit , which reconciles the early evolutionary universe phase with a standard preinflationary scenario ( with a decay from a false vacuum ) .",
    "furthermore , the emerging dust energy density is strongly redshifted by the universe de sitter phase and thus , the postinflationary dynamics is indistinguishable from the standard model one .",
    "finally , we observe that the value of the negative cosmological constant does not enter the ground state energy of the universe and so it can be easily stated as an amount which is unable to affect the present universe dynamics",
    ". we can consequently conclude that an evolutionary quantum cosmology exists , able to solve the singular nature of the big bang , without any dynamical discrepancy with respect to a standard friedmann universe and with the additional feature of a natural picture of the model classical limit .    despite the fact that the present study offers an interesting cosmological paradigm for the matter - time dualism and the related evolutionary quantum gravity , we stress how the problem of a unique definition of a physical clock for the dynamics of the gravitational field in canonical quantum gravity remains one of the most challenging topics in this area and deserves attention for both its fundamental developments and specific applications .",
    "we conclude by observing how the relevance of the present model must be also recognized in its possibly very general character .",
    "in fact , the anisotropic universe degrees of freedom are dynamically equivalent to a scalar field and the associated potential ( due to the cosmological model spatial curvature ) is quadratic in the limit of a quasi - isotropic universe .",
    "then , we could first extend the present model to the homogeneous bianchi universe ( in particular to the bianchi ix model , generalizing the closed isotropic universe ) and then to a generic inhomogeneous universe , via a quantum version of the so - called belinski - lipschitz - kalatnikov conjecture @xcite .",
    "although , differently from the scalar field dynamics , there is no firm evidence that the limit of small anisotropies is prescribed by the universe evolution , the perspective to replace the scalar field with the cosmological gravitational field degrees of freedom , opens very general and intriguing scenarios for the implementation of the idea traced here .",
    "we demonstrate that the solutions of the evolutionary equation in the large @xmath1 limit can be constructed as the product of the two harmonic oscillator solutions and . in particular , by inserting the expression into eq .",
