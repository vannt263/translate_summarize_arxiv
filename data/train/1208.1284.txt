    "over the past decade , there has been tremendous progress in the experimental study and theoretical investigation of spin qubit manipulation and decoherence @xcite .",
    "an important advantage of electron spin qubits is that they can be coupled strongly via the exchange interaction @xcite , which allows fast two - spin gates . however , exchange interaction is short - ranged , and long - range quantum communication remains a significant open problem in the scale - up of spin qubit architectures .",
    "various ideas have been proposed to move spin information on chip , such as via spin - photon coupling @xcite , spin bus friesen2007 , and directly moving the electrons themselves barnes2000,skinner2003 , greentree2004 , taylor2005 .",
    "spin - photon conversion is difficult because the strongest estimated coupling strength is still only in the order of mhz @xcite , which is slower than or comparable to the spin dephasing rate in most materials .",
    "spin buses , on the other hand , are limited by the energy gap between the bus ground state(s ) and the excited states @xcite , and are most useful for short - distance ( up to a few microns ) quantum information transfer .",
    "comparatively , direct spin transport is attractive because of its conceptual simplicity and its similarity to the conventional charge - coupled devices . indeed ,",
    "several experimental groups have recently shown how a surface acoustic wave ( saw ) can controllably transport an electron over several microns @xcite .",
    "clearly , transferring spin information by directly moving its carrier is an intriguing and promising approach , and deserves further in - depth analysis .",
    "here we focus on the aspect of spin decoherence due to electron motion .",
    "the main decoherence channel for a confined electron spin in a finite field is the hyperfine ( hf ) interaction induced pure dephasing @xcite .",
    "spin relaxation due to spin - orbit ( so ) interaction is much slower @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "spin relaxation of free electrons and holes in semiconductors is dominated by so interaction meier1984,zutic2004 , while the effect of hyperfine interaction is strongly suppressed by motional narrowing @xcite . for a moving electron spin qubit with controlled motion ,",
    "an intriguing question is thus when decoherence due to so interaction becomes dominant .",
    "in this paper we study spin decoherence of a moving but confined electron due to static disorders in a semiconductor heterostructure .",
    "for example , in a modulation - doped gaas / al@xmath1ga@xmath2as structure , the ionized dopants produce a random electric potential at the gaas interface where the quantum dot ( qd ) is located . if the qd is moved along the interface , the electron spin can sense this random potential through the so interaction , and undergo decoherence .",
    "the static disorder has been considered in the problem of spin relaxation of 2d electrons @xcite , while we focus on its effect on confined ( albeit moving ) electrons . here",
    "we construct a theoretical description of this decoherence mechanism .",
    "we find that this is a longitudinal relaxation channel at the lowest order",
    ". its rate can be as fast as sub-@xmath0s in gaas or above ms in si , making it a significant decoherence channel .",
    "the model system we consider is a single electron in a gate - defined qd from a two - dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) . in general",
    "the growth - direction confinement is much stronger , so that the qd can only be moved in the in - plane direction by programming the top gate potentials .",
    "the electron remains confined while the qd is moved .",
    "indeed , we assume the qd motion is adiabatic so that the electron remains in the ground orbital state .    ) defined in the laboratory frame , with @xmath3 and @xmath4 along the [ @xmath5 and [ @xmath6 directions .",

    "[ random potential ] , we consider a uniform linear motion of the qd with a constant velocity @xmath7 ( the qd potential minimum is at @xmath8 $ ] ) .",
    "such a linear motion is possible in principle by programming the surface gate potential along the path of qd motion.@xcite alternatively , saw has been shown to be effective in moving a single electron from one qd to another at the speed of sound.@xcite . in both these cases , the qd motion is facilitated by an external agent ( external electrical control in the former , and the piezoelectric generator of the saw in the latter ) .",
    "as such , the complete problem of the electron dynamics in a moving quantum dot is that for an open system , where the reservoir ( or the external driving agent ) is complex and difficult to define completely and quantum mechanically . in the present study , in order to simplify the problem , we assume that the reservoir , or the external driving agent , is classical and markovian . in other words ,",
    "the driving agent is so large that it does not remember any energy exchange with the electron .",
    "the consequences of this assumption will be discussed later in the manuscript .",

    "second , eqs .",
    "( [ db ] ) shows that there can be _ only transverse fluctuations _ in the effective magnetic field since @xmath94 [ see fig .  [ random potential](b ) ] . due to this transverse nature",
    ", there is _ no pure dephasing _ at the lowest order approximation .",
    "to calculate the spin relaxation rate of the moving electron , we need to first obtain the temporal correlation functions @xmath95 of the random magnetic field that leads to the spin decoherence .",
    "recall that the random magnetic field , given by eqs .",
    "( [ db ] ) and ( [ omega ] ) , originates from the spin - orbit interaction and a random electric field , the latter from disorder in the substrate material .",
    "thus the temporal correlation of the magnetic fluctuations comes from the spatial correlation of the random electric field . here",
    "we choose an isotropic model for the random electrical field @xmath96where @xmath97 is the kronecker delta function ( @xmath98 or @xmath99 ) , @xmath100 is the standard deviation of the electric field , @xmath101 is the cutoff function as listed in table i , in which @xmath102 is the distance between @xmath103 and @xmath104 , and @xmath105 is the correlation length of the random field . here",
    ", the average @xmath106 could be the average among different segments of the path when the experiment is done in a straight line , or the average in different directions when the electron is moved that way .",
    "it could also be the result of uncertainty in the driving agent , so that the time and the position of the electron do not have a one - to - one correspondence , and this variation in the electron position at a particular time gives us a degree of freedom for the averaging among different paths .",
    "thus in the moving frame @xmath107where @xmath108 and @xmath109 is the correlation time .",
    "the spatially random electric field in the laboratory frame is now a temporally random electric field in the moving frame , which through eqs .",
    "( [ db ] ) and ( [ omega ] ) becomes a temporally random magnetic field .",
    "it is important to emphasize here that we assume the qd trajectories can not be reproduced identically over different runs , since in realistic situations one can not drag the electron exactly along the same path .",
    "most importantly , the moving electron is an open system , constantly exchanging energy with the external driving agent that allows the linear motion of the qd .",
    "since the external driver is assumed to be classical and markovian , the electron dynamics is dissipative instead of unitary .",
    "therefore , the resulting spin flip is not a predictable unitary spin rotation , and information is lost due to the exchange with the external reservoir .    .fourier transformation of different correlations . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     saw - trapped electrons can help determine the spin - orbit coupling strength in the underlying material .",
    "for example , in gaas the electrons and holes that are photoexcited can be picked up by an saw .",
    "the spatial distribution of electron spins can then be measured by photoluminescence ( specifically polarization of the emitted photons ) or magneto - optic kerr rotation stotz2005,sanada2011 . in terms of kerr rotation , for instance",
    ", the spin distribution is expressed as @xmath110 , where @xmath11 is the distance from the origin where the excitons are generated , @xmath111 is the spin decay length , and @xmath112 is the spatial precession frequency . in the absence of an applied magnetic field ,",
    "the spin precession frequency @xmath113 is completely determined by the motion - induced magnetic field @xmath71 , @xmath114this field has been measured to be sizable ( 25 mt in ref .   for gaas ) , because of the high speed of the qd motion . based on eq .",
    "( [ deltab_app ] ) and @xmath115 , one can determine the so coupling constants by measuring the spatial precession frequency @xmath116 experimentally @xcite .",
    "this leads to an upper limit of the dresselhaus so coupling constant at @xmath117 m / s , which is consistent with other recent experiments studer2010,sanada2011,zumbuhl2002 .",
    "however , this @xmath27 value is smaller than what was used in earlier theoretical calculations @xcite .",
    "more experimental studies would be needed to clarify this issue .",
    "as we have discussed in the main text , the main decoherence channel for a confined electron spin in a finite field is the hyperfine interaction induced pure dephasing @xcite , while spin relaxation of free electrons and holes in semiconductors is dominated by spin - orbit interaction @xcite .",
    "here we show how the effect of hyperfine interaction is strongly suppressed by motional narrowing for a moving electron spin qubit with controlled motion .",
    "the contact hyperfine interaction for the electron in a quantum dot can be written as @xmath118 where @xmath119 is the hyperfine coupling constant at lattice site @xmath120 [ with @xmath121 being the total hyperfine coupling strength and @xmath122 the electron envelope function in the quantum dot ] . in gaas , for example , @xmath123ev , @xmath124 is the electron spin , and @xmath125 is the nuclear spin at lattice site @xmath120 .",
    "since nuclear spin evolves much more slowly compared to the electron spin , we can treat it semiclassically as an overhauser field : @xmath126 in the presence of an external magnetic field along the @xmath127 direction , we can focus on the @xmath127 component of the overhauser field @xmath128 ( let @xmath129 ) : @xmath130 since nuclear spins are randomly oriented in a sample at any reasonable experimental temperature , the electron spin would experience a fluctuating magnetic field as it moves , and undergo dephasing accordingly in the off - diagonal element of the electron spin density matrix : @xmath131 . here",
    "the phase diffusion is given by @xmath132 here the nuclear field spectral density @xmath133 is @xmath134 for a moving quantum dot in gaas with a trajectory @xmath135 , and assuming that any two different nuclear spins are completely uncorrelated , we find @xmath136 where we have used @xmath137 for gaas , and @xmath138 is the volume of a lattice unit cell . for simplicity , we calculate the integral using a gaussian envelope wave function for the electron with radius @xmath139 , and obtain the spectral density as @xmath140 where @xmath139 is the radius of the quantum dot , and @xmath141 is the speed of qd motion .",
    "now the electron spin phase diffusion can be calculated : @xmath142 the integral here can be evaluated numerically given dot radius @xmath139 and dot speed @xmath141 . in fig .",
    "[ figoverhauser ] we plot the spin dephasing time @xmath143 as a function of the speed @xmath141 of a moving gaas qd . here",
    "@xmath144 is defined according to the equality @xmath145 .",
    "when the motion speed goes to zero , we obtain the inhomogeneous broadening for a fixed qd , with dephasing time between 10 and 100 ns . when the speed @xmath141 is large ( @xmath146 m / s ) , the dephasing becomes suppressed .",
    "the electron samples a larger number of nuclear spins as it moves faster , and the effect of the random nuclear field averages out , which is a typical manifestation of the motional narrowing effect . a close inspection of the high - speed results in fig .",
    "figoverhauser and eq .",
    "( [ eq : dephasing_overhauser ] ) shows that for large @xmath141 , the dephasing time @xmath144 due to hyperfine interaction is proportional to @xmath141 , so the dephasing rate is proportional to @xmath147 , while eq .",
    "( [ 1t1 ] ) shows that the spin relaxation rate due to spin - orbit interaction is proportional to @xmath141 . comparing numerical results given in figs .",
    "[ fig3gamma_v ] and [ figoverhauser ] , we can see that in gaas , when the dot speed exceeds 10 m / s to 100 m / s , the nuclear spin induced dephasing becomes less important than the spin - orbit and random potential induced relaxation .      in the discussion here about nuclear spin induced dephasing ,",
    "we have considered only the lowest order effect of the nuclear spins , i.e. , the inhomogeneous broadening induced by random but static nuclear polarization .",
    "we have not considered pure dephasing due to nuclear spin dynamics .",
    "how the nuclear spin dynamics is affected by the dot motion , and how the dynamics would feed back into the electron spin coherence / decoherence , remain open theoretical questions .",
    "qualitatively , nuclear spin dynamics induced electron spin decoherence is generally slower than dephasing due to inhomogeneous broadening .",
    "thus the cross - over we study here should be a reliable indication of the overall competition between hyperfine interaction and spin - orbit interaction ."
