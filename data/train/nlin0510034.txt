    "two dimensional billiards are systems consisting of a free point particle moving in a two dimensional region bounded by rigid walls .",
    "the billiards problem leads to both classical and quantum interesting and well studied class of hamiltonian systems such as the stadium @xcite and the sinai billiards @xcite .",
    "basically , from a classical point of view the problem consists in to find the trajectory of a particle which bounces elastically on the boundary walls . from the quantum point of view , the problem consists in solving the helmholtz equation by requiring that the wave function vanishes on the boundary . at the mesoscopic level , a question of great interest in the transport properties in open billiards , such as quantum dots is the influence of the shape of the boundary .",
    "in fact , it has been observed that coherent backscattering and conductance fluctuations are strongly shape dependent @xcite . due to the development of nanostructure devices @xcite ( in addition to the quantum dots we can mention the quantum wires ) ,",
    "the transport properties with both regular and irregular profiles is of current interest @xcite . as matter of fact",
    "it has been observed that when the nanotubes are elongated they present a pattern of regularity in the shape .",
    "many of these systems have been studied and show regular and chaotic dynamics @xcite .",
    "quantum and classical billiards systems , have been helpful in the understanding the quantum manifestation of classical chaos and quantum transport for large values of energy . at low temperatures , of order of few mk ,",
    "the mean free path of electrons is much larger than the size of the quantum devices , diffusive effects disappear and the electrons show a rather ballistic behavior . in this case",
    "a classical analysis is enough for studying the transport properties in these quantum and mesoscopic devices .    in this work",
    "we study a two dimensional rippled open channel .",
    "the profile of walls of the channel are sine - like but , in general , with different phases .",
    "the case of one rippled wall has been previously studied in ref .",
    "we investigate the dependence of the transport properties on the difference of phases as well as the dependence on the amplitude between the walls in the ballistic regime , we obtain an analytical approximation for reflexivity for small ripples .",
    "we observe that the chaotic regime appears faster when the difference of the phase between the walls is near to @xmath0 than when they are near to be in phase for a given amplitude .",
    "our results are corroborated by numerical calculations .",
    "let us consider an open channel with rough walls such as the shown in fig .",
    "[ figu1 ] .",
    "the upper and lower walls are determined , respectively , by @xmath1 where , instead of the physical size , we use dimensionless variables @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 with @xmath7 being the length of the period and @xmath8 the length of the channel , @xmath9 are respectively the separation between the walls and the amplitude .",
    "the variable @xmath10 denotes the difference of phase between the upper and lower walls and it is restricted to the values @xmath11 .",
    "the trajectory of each particle bouncing elastically inside the channel is define by the initial condition ( @xmath12 , @xmath13 ) , where @xmath12 denotes the high at which the particle was initially dropped and @xmath13 the initial angle .",
    "since the particles bounces elastically , it satisfies that the angle of incidence equals to the reflection angle , meseared from the tangent line to the curve . for our work",
    "an important transport property is the transmitivity , @xmath14 , that is defined by the flux of the transmitted particles divided by the incoming flux . to compute this numerically we dropped @xmath15 particles from the left side of the channel ( at @xmath16 ) , of length @xmath17 , by 10 sources uniformly distributed along the @xmath18 axis ( each source eject 1000 particles ) .",
    "we assume that the particles do not interact among themselves and that no multiple collision with the walls occurs before the particle leaves away the corresponding wall .",
    "the angular distribution ( for each source ) of the dropped particles is @xmath19 where @xmath20 is measured with respect to @xmath21 axis as is shown in fig .",
    "[ figu1 ] and @xmath22 is the total number of particles .",
    "let us discuss a channel whose walls are separated away by a distance @xmath23 . in order to obtain all the different types of trajectories in the phase space ( @xmath24,@xmath25 ) , were @xmath24 and @xmath25 are respectively the value of the @xmath21 coordinate at the @xmath26-th collision with the upper wall and @xmath25 the @xmath21 component of the momentum after the @xmath26-th collision .",
    "we throw particles with different initial conditions in the phase space .",
    "the @xmath21 component of the momentum is normalized by the velocity .",
    "the system can be carry out in practice if we identify the particles as electrons and resort to the ballistic regime which is realized at low temperatures in nanostructures where the size of the sample @xmath8 is such that @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the electron wavelength and @xmath29 is the mean free path @xcite .",
    "some poincar sections are shown in figs .",
    "[ figu3]-[figu8 ] .",
    "notice that poincar sections are moved along the @xmath21 direction by a quantity @xmath30 . for small values of @xmath31",
    "the corresponding poincar sections are similar to a pendulum phase space ( figs .",
    "[ figu5 ] and [ figu7 ] ) .",
    "when we go to higher amplitudes , the separatrix in @xmath32 of fig .",
    "[ figu3 ] becomes chaotic . for higher values of @xmath31",
    "we get a region of trapped particles ( ellipses or deformed ellipses ) surrounded by a chaotic sea ( fig .",
    "[ figu8 ] ) , this occurs when the last kam curve breaks and then all chaotic regions are connected . for small values of @xmath31 , the elliptic orbit indicates that the particles are trapped around the center of the ellipse ( not all of these points are fixed points ) .",
    "notice that for a fixed point @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the trajectory of the particle after the @xmath26-th collition .",
    "this leads to the condition @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is a fixed point , so in order to have a fixed point the phase @xmath10 must satisfies the relation @xmath37 .",
    "when the amplitude is small , the trapped particles execute librational motion ( similar to the pendulum oscillations around the stable equilibrium point ) , they move adiabatically forward and backward",
    ". the only change due to the phase , for small amplitudes , is that the center of the ellipses are moved in the @xmath21 direction but they maintain almost constant in the @xmath38 direction , near to @xmath39 ( see figs . [ figu5 ] and [ figu7 ] ) .    from our results",
    ", we observe that for values of the phase near to @xmath40 , whenever the amplitude is increased , the chaotic regime appears faster than for values near to @xmath41 .",
    "this behavior is observed as well for the last kam curves ; as we go near to @xmath40 the last kam curves break sooner . as an example",
    "when the walls are in phase the separatrix becomes chaotic until @xmath42 and the last kam curve breaks until @xmath43 .",
    "for @xmath44 the last kam curve breaks around @xmath45 and for greater values , for instance @xmath46 ( fig [ figu7 ] ) it appears a cluster of seven elliptical curves surrounding the principal first order resonance island .",
    "when @xmath47 the chaotic behavior appears around @xmath48 and the last kam curve breaks around @xmath49 .",
    "there is an appreciable difference between region of trapped particles when the profiles are in phase than when @xmath50 .",
    "for the same amplitude @xmath31 , we can see these differences from figs .",
    "[ figu3 ] and [ figu4 ] there are more trapped particles when the phase is @xmath50 than when the phase is @xmath41 .",
    "for small amplitudes ( e.g. @xmath51 ) and when the direction , at which the particles are dropped , is almost parallel to the vertical , the particles collide almost perpendicularly with the walls , this means that @xmath52 .",
    "as the particles bounces elastically the energy is conserved .",
    "if , in addition , we use the principle of adiabatic invariance we can show that the motion in the @xmath21-direction is described approximately by @xcite : @xmath53 where @xmath54 is a constant . in this case",
    "@xmath55 is the action , @xmath56 is the total energy and @xmath57 is the separation betwen the walls at the @xmath21 point , @xmath58 .",
    "the term @xmath59 can be interpreted as an effective potential .",
    "if @xmath60 , @xmath61 becomes @xmath62 for the case of @xmath40 , @xmath61 takes the form of pendulum - like potential and explain why the phase space in this instance has a pendulum - like form ( see fig .",
    "[ figu7 ] ) .",
    "we may label , in eq .",
    "( [ eq3 ] ) , the variable @xmath21 with the index @xmath26 to indicate the @xmath26-th collition at the @xmath21 point .",
    "let @xmath63 and @xmath64 be the @xmath21 velocity at the @xmath26-th collition and @xmath65-th collition respectively . from eq .",
    "( [ eq3 ] ) we can obtain a relation between @xmath66 and @xmath67 : @xmath68 where @xmath69 .",
    "let be @xmath70 , the angle that the trajectory makes with the vertical at the @xmath26-th collition so that @xmath71 is small and it becomes small and small as it reaches the turning point @xmath72 ( see fig .",
    "[ label ] ) , at this point @xmath73 .",
    "let be @xmath74 the critical angle at which the particle was dropped in @xmath16 and does not turn back .",
    "the trajectory corresponding to this initial condition is associated with the the largest amplitude of librational motion at the center of the ellipses .",
    "let us define @xmath75 as the point ( being bigger than @xmath16 ) for which the greatest ellipse crosses the @xmath21 axis .",
    "let @xmath76 , @xmath77 and @xmath78 , @xmath79 substituting these into eq .",
    "( [ eq4 ] ) and keeping only terms of the order of @xmath31 and @xmath80 we obtain : @xmath81 if @xmath40 , then @xmath82 and : @xmath83 this result is similar to the semiplane case , the only difference is that in this case the amplitude of the channel is twice bigger than the semiplane case @xcite .",
    "notice also for @xmath41 and @xmath84 and from eq .",
    "( [ aprx ] ) that @xmath74 is of order of zero . here",
    ", we can see why the great difference between @xmath41 and @xmath50 , even for small amplitudes . if @xmath85 , it can be seen from fig .",
    "[ figu5 ] that @xmath86 and then @xmath87 , this means that for the case of @xmath85 the channel has a higher value of resistivity than for case of @xmath40 .    for small amplitudes , we see numerically that @xmath74 is almost the same for different values of @xmath12 where @xmath12 , is the initial point for which the particle was dropped , this means that @xmath74 depends mainly on @xmath10 , @xmath88 and @xmath31 .",
    "we have seen numerically that for small amplitudes the phase space is dominated by kam tori in a pendulum - like manner , the motion of the particles with angles @xmath89 can be considered in the adiabatic approximation , thus the velocity in the @xmath21 direction @xmath90 , can be estimated as @xmath91 and produce a backward flux , such that the reflexivity , @xmath92 , is given @xmath93 using the approximation for @xmath74 given in ( [ eq4 ] ) , eq . ( [ eq9a ] ) becomes @xmath94 where the coefficient @xmath95 notice also from equation ( [ eq10a ] ) that for all phases the reflexivity is proportional to @xmath96 and the information of the phase is contained in the coefficient g because we have seen numerically that for small amplitudes @xmath75 varies very slow when @xmath31 is varied , this means that @xmath75 depends mainly on @xmath10 .",
    "an important measurable quantity is the resistivity @xmath97 of the channel that is related with the reflexivity through landauer s formula @xcite .",
    "@xmath98 since @xmath99 as @xmath100 and according to eqs ( [ eq10a ] ) and ( [ resis ] ) , we conclude that @xmath97 increases proportionally to @xmath96 independently of the phase @xmath10 .",
    "fig . [ figu11 ] shows reflexivity against amplitude for three different phases @xmath101 , @xmath85 and @xmath40 which correspond to the following numerical equations respectively @xmath102 , @xmath103 , @xmath104 .",
    "our analysis predicts @xmath105 ( eq . [ eq10a ] ) which gives a good agreement between the analytical and numerical results in powers of @xmath31 .",
    "the analytical coefficients @xmath106 for @xmath40 and @xmath85 are respectively @xmath107 and @xmath108 , the discrepancies in the coefficients , between the analytical and numerical results arise from the exponential grow of the numerical error since we made a fitting data as a function of a power law .    in fig .",
    "[ figu12 ] we show numerical values for resistivity against the phase keeping constant the amplitude .",
    "we can see that for @xmath41 the reflexivity vanishes ; a rather expected result since from eq .",
    "( [ aprx ] ) we obtain that @xmath109 .",
    "moreover when the phase ( @xmath10 ) is increased the reflexivity increases until it reaches its maximun value at approximately @xmath110 , then the reflexivity goes down to the value 0 at @xmath111 , which is the same geometrical situation that for @xmath41 .",
    "notice that there were significant change in reflexivity only when a change on the phase @xmath10 is more than @xmath112 .",
    "we have seen numerically that @xmath113 when @xmath41 if @xmath114 , this does not mean that all the particles are transmitted , but the critical angle is so small that makes the computer insensitive to this values of angles , this implies @xmath115 , using eq .",
    "( [ eq10a ] ) we see that @xmath116 this is in agreement with eq ( [ aprx ] ) that predicts @xmath117 , which implies @xmath118 .",

    "in general the numerical calculations are in agreement with the analytical results .",
    "we have analyzed a two dimensional channel with rough walls .",
    "we studied the poincar sections for different values of phase between the walls @xmath10 and the amplitude @xmath31 .",
    "we found that poincar section are pendulum - like for small values of @xmath31 .",
    "we also note that when the amplitude is increased the chaotic regime appears sooner when we are near to @xmath40 than when we are near to @xmath41 . based on analytical and numerical results we found that resistivity @xmath120 is independent of the parameter @xmath10 , such that the information about the phase is complete contained in the proportionality coefficient @xmath106 .",
    "our numerical results for small amplitudes , show that the system with the biggest reflexivity is around @xmath121 and the system with the smaller reflexivity is when the walls are in phase and resistivity is of order of @xmath122 .",
    "we have shown that the difference of phases between the walls play an important role in dynamic transport properties even for small values of the amplitude .",
