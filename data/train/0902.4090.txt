    "<S> we present very low temperature scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy ( stm / s ) measurements of a w based amorphous thin film grown with focused - ion - beam . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we address the superconducting properties close to the border , where the thickness of the superconducting film decreases , and the au substrate emerges . </S>",
    "<S> when approaching the au substrate , the superconducting tunneling conductance strongly increases around the fermi level , and the quasiparticle peaks do not significantly change its position . under magnetic fields , the vortex lattice is observed , with vortices positioned very close to the au substrate .    in a recent experiment </S>",
    "<S> we have shown that w based thin films grown using a precusor gas and a focused ion beam on top of a conducting au substrate are excellent superconducting systems for making stm / s down to atomic level and at very low temperatures@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the superconducting properties are very homogeneous , and the vortex lattice can be observed with beautiful detail . </S>",
    "<S> it is of interest to understand the behavior of the superconductor ( s ) close to its border , where the height of the thin film continuously decreases , and the normal substrate ( n ) appears . </S>",
    "<S> this gives a curious n - s hybrid system , where the superconducting properties must gradually disappear due to the proximity of the n metal , and where it is possible to follow the positions of the vortices close to the border of the thin film , when the magnetic field is applied perpendicular to the thin film . </S>",
    "<S> note that the situation is exactly the inverse as in refs.@xcite , where an au layer was deposited on top of a superconductor , and the local density of states ( ldos ) on the n layer measured as a function of its thickness . in those cases , </S>",
    "<S> the vortex lattice was not studied .    ]    ]    the thin films are grown as described elsewhere , have a concentration of w=40@xmath07% , c=43@xmath04% , ga=10@xmath03% and o=7@xmath02% , a thickness of 200 nm , and t@xmath1 = 4.15 k @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> measurements are made in a stm / s system in a dilution refrigerator , which cools sample and tip down to about 100 mk@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we position the tip at the border of the w deposit using an in - situ displacement mechanism . in fig.[fig0 ] we schematically describe our experiment . </S>",
    "<S> we focus on the border of the thin film , where topography is smooth , as well within the film @xcite , and there is a continuous height decrease towards au that disappears when reaching the au surface , which is essentially flat ( apart the characteristic surface rugosity of thin films of au , which are usually granular ) .    </S>",
    "<S> the tunneling spectroscopy as a function of the position at the border of the thin film is shown in fig.[fig1 ] . </S>",
    "<S> the superconducting gap is well developed within the deposit , and , around 20 nm from the border to au , the tunneling characteristics begin to show a significant increase of the low energy conductance , and become flat on top of the au sample . the position in energy of the quasiparticle peaks does not change when approaching the au substrate .    </S>",
    "<S> it is useful to compare this result with previous work on related structures . </S>",
    "<S> measurements on a normal layer in close contact with a superconductor ( as al or nb ) have shown the appearance of a minigap in the excitation spectrum when the characteristic dimensions of the normal layer are below the electron phase coherence length @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in other cases , the continuous reduction of the superconducting correlations due to the proximity to a normal metal results in a decrease of the position in energy of the quasiparticle peaks in the ldos and a strong increase in the low energy ldos@xcite . however , the behavior observed here is significantly different , as the position of the quasiparticle peaks does not appear to move when approaching the au sample . </S>",
    "<S> such a behavior can not be understood in terms of conventional quasiclassical theory@xcite , which reproduces well previously mentioned experiments . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , the geometry of our structure is rather 3d , with the superconductor becoming more and more thin when the tip approaches the au substrate . </S>",
    "<S> this may lead to effects not taken into account in quasiclassical theory , which is usually simplified to one dimension . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , we are measuring an amorphous superconducting system , with a strongly reduced mean free path . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , we should note that similar ldos variations have been observed in previous experiments in disordered tin films , with highly inhomogeneous superconducting properties@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it appears that in tin superconducting `` grains '' are separated by normal regions , of nominally the same material@xcite , an effect that has been associated to the closeness to a transition towards an insulating state when further increasing disorder in those systems@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it is clear that the w ion beam deposited thin film is a homogeneous superconductor@xcite , whereas the tin films are strongly inhomogeneous . in both cases </S>",
    "<S> the mean free path @xmath2 is strongly reduced , and not far to the localization limit ( located at @xmath3 ) . </S>",
    "<S> so the observed ldos variation may be related to an extremely low mean free path and could be a characteristic feature of n - s hybrid systems made of amorphous s.    , width=529 ]    in fig.[fig2]b we show a sts image made of the fermi level conductance as a function of the position , and in fig.[fig2]a the stm topography of the same area . </S>",
    "<S> as shown in ref.@xcite , the orientation of the vortex lattice follows the small linear surface depressions appearing in the topography . </S>",
    "<S> the dashed lines in fig.[fig2]a highlight the position of these features in the topography , which can be precisely identified in height profiles ( not shown ) . at the upper left corner of the sts image </S>",
    "<S> , we observe a hexagon whose orientation is determined by the linear surface depressions . when approaching the border , the vortex lattice becomes disordered , and many elongated patches appear in the sts image . </S>",
    "<S> these patches possibly signal vortex bunches or distorted vortex lines . </S>",
    "<S> exactly at the border , in between vortices , we observe qualitatively the same ldos behavior as in zero field ( fig.[fig1 ] ) , although with additional magnetic field induced pair breaking effects .    </S>",
    "<S> remarkably , in some places we observe vortices which are positioned very close to the au substrate . </S>",
    "<S> this occurs independently of the field history , as well in zero field cooled as in field cooled sts images . in the lower right part of fig.[fig2]b </S>",
    "<S> we see a single vortex located at about 15 nm from au . </S>",
    "<S> note that we observe a clear decrease of the fermi level density of states when leaving the vortex core towards the border , as shown by the color scale in fig.[fig2 ] . </S>",
    "<S> however , the distance between the vortex core and the border is much smaller than the intervortex distance at this field ( about 60 nm ) . </S>",
    "<S> the reason for having a vortex so close to the border must lie in a delicate balance between the different interactions playing a role in the vortex position . on the one hand , the magnetic field is relatively large ( 0.7 t ) , so that the vortex density is high and the energy gained by the vortex when being positioned at the border is small @xcite . on the other hand , this gain in energy can be compensated by a reduced vortex length due to the decrease in the thickness of the deposit towards au .    having a vortex so close to the au substrate also implies that there are significant dissipation free screening currents circulating in au . </S>",
    "<S> the geometry of the screening currents is determined by the london penetration depth @xmath4 , which is as high as 500 nm in this material@xcite . the phase coherent length in au is indeed expected to be pretty large at low temperatures @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we have increased the temperature close to t@xmath1 ( = 4.15 k here ) , and have observed no significant variations in the position of the vortices close to the border , showing that the decrease in the phase coherent length must remain above @xmath4 up to t@xmath1 , or that the screening currents make up only a small part of the energy balance that positions the vortex close to the border .    in summary </S>",
    "<S> , we have followed the superconducting ldos at the border of an amorphous w ion beam deposited thin film on top of an au substrate . </S>",
    "<S> remarkably , we observe vortices very close to the border of the w thin film .    </S>",

    "<S> the laboratorio de bajas temperaturas is associated to the icmm of the csic . </S>",
    "<S> this work was supported by the spanish mec ( consolider ingenio 2010 , mat and fis programs ) , by the comunidad de madrid through program `` science and technology in the millikelvin '' , and by nes and ecom programs of the esf . </S>",
    "<S> images have been rendered using @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> _ note added in proof _ : the effect of andreev interference on the ldos profiles in and around vortices as a consequence of a confined geometry , has been analyzed very recently@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it may produce a significant shift between the actual vortex center and the maximum in the ldos . within this scenario , </S>",
    "<S> actual vortex center would lie farther from the border , but the ldos would be peaked close to the border . </S>"
