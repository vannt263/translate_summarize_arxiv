    "the x - ray source grs 1915 + 105 discovered by granat observatory exhibits both the superluminal jet ( mirabel & rodriguez 1994 ) and very complex variability pattern ( belloni et al . 1997 ) .",
    "the outburst x - ray luminosity is about @xmath0 erg / s , being of the order of eddington luminosity in case of stellar mass black hole system .",
    "the spectral analysis reveals the domination of disk - like component during the outbursts , and therefore the variability of the source may be connected with disk evolution .",
    "the local time behaviour of an accretion disk at a given radius is determined by the stability curve , i.e. the log @xmath1 vs. log @xmath2 diagram constructed for a stationary disk , where @xmath1 is the accretion rate and @xmath2 is the disk surface density .",
    "the parts of the curve with a negative slope describe the unstable branch and indicate the range of accretion rates resulting in time dependent disk behaviour at this radius .",
    "the unstable part corresponds to the radiation pressure dominated region ; including the advection term results in stabilizing the solution .",
    "= 100 mm    the disc is unstable in the inner part . for the limited range of radii",
    "the limit cycle behaviour occurs and propagates outwards .",
    "the value of viscosity parameter does not change the outburst amplitude , but influences the duration of the limit cycle .",
    "the observations of microquasar outbursts require that the whole limit cycle should run between @xmath3 and @xmath4 . in the model ,",
    "the maximal disc luminosity is lowered under the assumption that jet ejected from the disc takes away a certain part of the total emitted power , depending on the @xmath5 ratio .",
    "we adopt a jet power parameterization similar to nayakshin et al .",
    "( 1999 )    we assume that the heat generated within the disk at any radius is either stored temporarily within it or removed by : ( i ) radiation ( ii ) advection ( iii ) jet . as the spectral observations show the presence of hard x - ray tail , we also assume the existence of hot corona , with moderate contribution to the energy dissipation ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "we adopt the mass supply to the inner part of the disk as a model parameter and follow the time evolution of the disk under the radiation pressure instability , as described in siemiginowska et al .",
    "the amplitude of the global outburst depends mostly on the shape of the stability curve in the innermost part of the disk .",
    "the duration of the limit cycle , on the other hand , is basically determined by the viscous timescale at the outer radius of the instability zone in a stationary model , i.e. on the stationary accretion rate , radial extension of the instability zone for that accretion rate and the viscosity parameter @xmath7 .",
    "we used a physically viable instability due to radiation pressure to model the time dependent behaviour of the optically thick disk itself .",
    "the presence of the hot optically thin medium was accounted for by assuming assuming that a certain part of gravitational energy ( @xmath6 ) is released in hot corona outside the disc .",
    "the mechanism operates for accretion rates above @xmath8 which is in agreement with the observations of grs 1915 + 105 - the source does not exhibit the outburst if the mean luminosity temporarily drops below @xmath9 erg / s .",
    "the viscosity coefficient of order of 0.01 is appropriate to model the typical outburst duration .",
    "we conclude that the radiation pressure instability is a promising model of the basic instability mechanism underlying the observed variability of this microquasar .",
