    "local magnetic moments resulting from partially filled localized orbitals can experience an indirect magnetic exchange coupling mediated via a system of conduction electrons .",
    "the prime example is the ruderman - kittel - kasuya - yoshida ( rkky ) effective interaction @xcite which has an oscillatory dependence on the distance between the magnetic impurities .",
    "@xcite in particular , the rkky mechanism in many cases explains the coupling of magnetic adatoms on non - magnetic metallic surfaces . due to the recent methodical advances in spin - resolved scanning tunneling microscopy techniques @xcite it is nowadays possible to map out the strength and the oscillatory distance dependence of the rkky interaction with atomic resolution .",
    "@xcite moreover , the possibility to manipulate the positions of individual magnetic atoms offers the exciting perspective to build artificial adatom magnetic nanostructures with tailored magnetic properties .",
    "@xcite in view of possible future applications for magnetic data storage , ferromagnetically ordered nanostructures deserve particular attention .",
    "the simplest theoretical model of correlated electrons on a lattice that may sustain ferromagnetism induced by indirect rkky coupling is the periodic anderson model .",
    "@xcite here , the magnetic impurities or the magnetic adatoms are described by sites with a non - zero on - site hubbard - type interaction of strength @xmath0 .",
    "the impurity sites are coupled via a hybridization term @xmath1 to a system of non - interacting conduction electrons which hop between the nearest - neighboring sites of a lattice with a hopping amplitude @xmath2 .",
    "local magnetic moments on the impurity sites are formed in the strong - coupling limit @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the conduction - electron density of states at the fermi energy .",
    "a local polarization of the conduction electrons is induced via the antiferromagnetic local kondo exchange @xcite @xmath5 and results in an effective interaction @xmath6 between the impurities coupling to lattice sites @xmath7 and @xmath8 that is given in terms of the non - local static magnetic susceptibility @xmath9 .",
    "consider the conceptually most simply case of a half - filled and particle - hole symmetric periodic anderson model on a bipartite @xmath10-dimensional lattice with @xmath11 conduction - electron sites . as the conduction - electron spin - spin correlations between nearest - neighbor sites",
    "are antiferromagnetic in this case , i.e.  @xmath12 , a _",
    "rkky coupling is only possible if impurities are placed at sites that are separated by two ( or generally by an even number ) of nearest - neighbor hops .",
    "therefore , a corresponding spin - depleted periodic anderson model with at most @xmath13 impurity spins is expected to sustain ferromagnetic order .",
    "apart from the perspectives in modeling artificial ferromagnetic nanostructures , the depleted periodic anderson as well as the related kondo model are interesting to describe the electronic structure of one - dimensional organic ferromagnets .",
    "@xcite the limit of strong kondo coupling @xmath14 is accessible to studies of ultracold alkali earth atoms trapped in optical lattices as has been discussed recently .",
    "@xcite    here , however , we would like to emphasize that the considered depleted models are in first place interesting from a more fundamental point of view .",
    "due to the geometrically regular removal of impurities , an insulating state is avoided , and _",
    "metallic _ ferromagnetism can be studied in a simple particle - hole symmetric model .",
    "this is a similar motivation as for the antiferromagnetic case studied in ref .  .",
    "another motivation for the present study is that there are several and conceptually very different theoretical approaches that apply to the case of the depleted anderson or kondo lattice and provide independent explanations for the emergence of ferromagnetic order : ( i ) first of all , beyond the regime of weak hybridization @xmath15 , the indirect exchange is expected to compete @xcite with the kondo screening @xcite of the impurity magnetic moments .",
    "( ii ) interestingly , in the limit of strongly coupled impurities ( strong @xmath15 or strong @xmath14 ) , the kondo effect has actually been seen to _ corroborate _ ferromagnetic ordering .",
    "namely , an `` inverse '' indirect magnetic exchange ( iime ) provides a coupling of local moments formed _ between _ almost localized kondo singlets .",
    "@xcite ( iii ) moreover , a variant @xcite of the lieb - mattis theorem @xcite may apply which predicts a ferro- or actually ferrimagnetic ground state in the entire @xmath15 or @xmath14 regime .",
    "this is compatible with a crossover from the rkky to the iime limit .",
    "( iv ) even the non - interacting ( @xmath16 ) limit is interesting : the lattice geometry inevitably leads a completely non - dispersive band right at the fermi energy . as a result",
    "there is a highly degenerate fermi sea where the configuration with a fully polarized flat band is one of the possible many - body ground states .",
    "this raises the question which characteristics of the interacting ferromagnet already derive from those of the fully polarized non - interacting ground state .",
    "moreover , the stoner criterion @xcite applies to the weakly interacting system , i.e.  the flat band makes the system extremely susceptible to magnetic ordering .",
    "( v ) another question is whether the ferromagnetic order can be understood within the concept of `` flat - band ferromagnetism '' @xcite as well .",
    "comparison of numerically exact data with standard hartree - fock theory may show whether the ground state is correlated at all and thus different from the fully polarized fermi sea that is predicted in the flat - band ferromagnetism scenario .",
    "finally , another motivation of the present paper is a methodical one : the physics of the models studied here are very well accessible to reliable numerical techniques .",
    "the density - matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) @xcite provides essentially exact results for the one - dimensional case .",
    "interestingly , dynamical mean - field theory ( dmft ) @xcite turns out as very reliable , too , even for @xmath17 , since the correlated sites are separated by 4 or more nearest - neighbor hops and thus the local approximation for the self - energy becomes rather accurate .",
    "this allows us to address the two - dimensional lattice as well and motivates us to analyze the low - energy part of the single - particle excitation spectrum to study the `` fate '' of the flat band for a strongly correlated system .",
    "results will be discussed mainly for the case of anderson but also for kondo impurities .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in the next section , we introduce the depleted anderson model .",
    "its properties in the non - interacting limit and in particular the emergence of a flat band are analyzed in sec .",
    "a study of the properties of the non - interacting state with a fully polarized flat band is given in sec .",

    "this not only demonstrates the limitations of the hartree - fock approach but also allows us to analyze the crossover from the weak-@xmath15 to the strong-@xmath15 limit .",

    "xii once more shifts and extends the perspective by considering the depleted kondo model in a regime where it is different from the related anderson model .",

    "consequently , @xmath34 with a @xmath35 hopping matrix for each wave vector @xmath36 : @xmath37 here , @xmath38 is the bare ( @xmath39 ) dispersion of the conduction - electron band .",

    "the @xmath47 band is dispersionless , i.e.  `` flat '' .",
    "the presence of the flat band originates from the ( i ) bipartite lattice structure , ( ii ) the restriction to inter - sublattice hopping , ( iii ) homogeneous on - site energies and ( iv ) from the fact that there are more a sites ( including impurity sites ) than b sites ( for the present discussion we have to regard the impurity sites as a sites as they are coupled to b sites only ) .",

    "namely , in the weak - coupling limit @xmath89 and for the particular system with @xmath124 and @xmath125 , exactly one of the impurity spins is kondo screened , and only the remaining ones are subjected to the ferromagnetic rkky interaction .",
    "the `` missing spin '' can be understood with the help of the _ original _ lieb - mattis theorem : using standard degenerate perturbation theory in first order in @xmath14 for the depleted kondo lattice , we obtain the following effective model : @xmath152 where @xmath153 is a spin @xmath85 at the impurity site @xmath26 , and @xmath154 is the spin of the conduction electron at the fermi energy . the effective exchange couplings @xmath155 are given in terms of its single - particle wave function @xmath156 and are all positive .",

    "as this has the topology of a bipartite lattice , the lieb - mattis theorem @xcite immediately predicts a unique ground state with @xmath150 .    in the opposite limit of strong hybridization @xmath130 , the electrons at the impurity and at the b sites form strongly localized and magnetically inert singlet bound states",
    "this implies that the total magnetic moment is no longer carried by the impurity sites .",
    "however , these `` anderson singlets '' tend to localize the electrons at the a sites , and this results in the formation of strong local a - site magnetic moments",
    ". there is an indirect coupling between the a - site moments which is ferromagnetic and induced via virtual excitations of the anderson singlets .",

    "a analogous construction of an effective low - energy model by employing strong - coupling perturbation theory is also possible in the anderson case ( and will be published elsewhere ) .",
