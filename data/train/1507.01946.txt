    "the decay rate ( i.e. , inverse lifetime ) of the quasiparticles along these arcs , once they are formed , is limited by collisions , and fermi s golden rule implies that this decay rate is of order @xmath211 ; this is the rate at which these features spread out in momentum space .",
    "thus there is a parametric separation in @xmath7 between the formation and decay rate of these peaks .",
    "the leading collisional process comes from cubic terms of the form @xmath212 ( plus appropriate conjugates ) in the hamiltonian .",
    "the golden rule rate for this particular process is    @xmath213    where @xmath214 is the accessible two - particle density of states . here , @xmath215 is the energy of an excitation with quasimomentum @xmath216 . on dimensional grounds",
    "this two - particle density of states must be inversely proportional to @xmath217 ; thus , the overall golden rule lifetime of a particular quasiparticle state will go as    @xmath218    up to a multiplicative constant .",
    "the ratio between the decay rate and the creation rate scales as @xmath219 .",
    "thus the decay rate of a mode is slower than the creation rate whenever the condensate amplitude is large compared with the population of the mode ( essentially because the matrix element is not bose - enhanced to the same degree ) .",
    "however , the decay rate is also suppressed with decreasing the interactions ( expected ) or increasing the drive amplitude . at short times ,",
    "when the condensate is not appreciably depleted , the wcca is therefore reliable ; however , when the depletion becomes large the wcca also fails .",
    "thus the regimes of validity of the wcca and bogoliubov theory in the parametrically unstable regime are essentially the same , although the wcca has the advantage of respecting particle number conservation _ exactly _ at all times .",
    "_ stable region .",
    "_ in the stable region there are two types of physical processes beyond the wcca .",
    "( 1 ) the excitations created by the original quench into the phase have finite collisional lifetimes , as discussed above .",
    "the momentum - space patterns in the stable region will dephase on this golden - rule timescale @xmath220 ; however , the condensate fraction will remain large and stable even after dephasing .",
    "( 2 ) eventually , the system will absorb energy from the drive .",
    "if the drive frequency is @xmath37 and the bandwidth of single - particle excitations is @xmath217 , then resonant absorption must involve at least @xmath221 quasiparticles .",
    "it is straightforward to check that the associated golden rule rate , at weak coupling , is of the form @xmath222 .",
    "when @xmath7 is sufficiently small , this heating timescale is much longer than the timescale on which the momentum - space patterns dephase ; thus the system should remain _ stable _ for extremely long times at high frequencies .",
    "_ dynamically unstable region .",
    "_ in this regime , the growth rates of unstable modes are of order @xmath223 , whereas the collision rates are of order @xmath224 at best , so at weak coupling we have a parametric window in @xmath7 where the wcca remains valid .",
    "in this appendix , we discuss the dynamics governed by the wcca close to the first zero of the bessel function , @xmath226 , where the dispersion of the @xmath227 hamiltonian becomes flat ( central grey region in fig .  1 , main text ) .",
    "for @xmath204 the dispersion of the free theory @xmath228 supports a stable minimum for @xmath62 , while for @xmath206 the stable minimum appears at @xmath63 . since the the two stable regions support different momentum modes , a phase transition occurs in between them .",
    "therefore , it is required that one allows for a macroscopic population of both the modes in the immediate vicinity of @xmath229 .",
    "this can be achieved by reducing the translational symmetry of the problem .",
    "intuitively , a condensate at @xmath230 with amplitude @xmath231 flips a sign on every other site .",
    "hence , one can choose to work in the original ( momentum - resolved ) basis @xmath232 , or in the site - resolved basis @xmath233 .",
    "the two are related by a rotation . in order allow for a dynamical population of the @xmath231 condensate , eqs .   and",
    "require that the initial condition for @xmath234 be nonzero . in the @xmath202-basis ,",
    "this is equivalent to saying that there is a slight difference in the condensate occupation on the two sublattices .",
    "physically , this imbalance is caused by spontaneous symmetry breaking .",
    "however , in the wcca one has to put in this imbalance by hand . in the following we refer to the small value @xmath235 as _",
    "seed_.    when the effective dispersion becomes flat @xmath236 [ fig  [ fig : osc_condensate ] ] , the condensate undergoes oscillations between the @xmath237 and @xmath21 modes , with a period @xmath238 for small @xmath7 .",
    "this behaviour is reminiscent of the collapse - and - revival effects seen for a bec that is suddenly quenched into the mott insulating phase@xcite , although the dynamics governed by wcca is classical .",
    "the period of the transfer oscillations is also seed - dependent and increases with @xmath239 . even though our approximation does not capture a true mott insulating phase , the nonlinearities included in the wcca are sufficient to give rise to these oscillations . physically speaking ,",
    "a quasiparticle - mediated channel is opened , through which particles flow from the condensate at @xmath14 to @xmath63 .",
    "although it is present at any @xmath29 , this channel is only effective when the dispersion is sufficiently flat since the amplitude for the phonon- mediated transition @xmath240 scales as @xmath241 .",
    "last , we briefly address the issue of heating . fig .",
    "[ fig : energy ] shows the excess total ( i.e. , condensate plus quasiparticle ) energy density in the system , relative to the non - driven state . due to the abrupt turn - on of the periodic circularly polarised modulation , the energy changes discontinuously at @xmath126 .",
    "as expected , the energy density increases due to heating in the parametrically unstable region , saturates in the stable region , and exhibits a small growth for @xmath242 .",
    "notice the different behaviour in the parametrically unstable region compared to the dynamically unstable one : while in the former the energy grows due to the population of modes lying on the high - energy surface , in the latter the dynamically unstable modes appear close enough to the origin [ cf .",
    "fig .  3 , panel ( c ) in main text ] so that the growth in energy density past the quench value is not substantial .",
    "note that the system does not heat up even at fairly long times whenever the parameters are chosen to be in the stable region of the stability diagram . although ergodic periodically - driven systems are expected to eventually heat up to infinite temperature@xcite , in the weak - coupling limit this heating timescale ( which is due to collisions between quasiparticles ) is parametrically slower in the `` stable '' regimes of our phase diagram than in the `` unstable '' regimes . thus , for a range of present - day experiments , we expect that in the stable high - frequency regime there is no significant heating on experimentally relevant timescales .",
    "for the time - evolution of the momentum distribution function , we refer to the three videos in the supplementary material .",
    "the lower left panel shows the quasiparticle momentum distribution over the first brillouin zone , while the upper left panel is a top view of the same .",
    "the upper right panel displays the time - evolution of the condensate fraction , while the lower right panel shows the energy density .",
    "the parameters for each simulation can be found in the title .",
    "the three movies correspond to the points in the stability diagram marked by ( a ) , ( b ) , ( c ) in fig .  1 ( main text ) ."
