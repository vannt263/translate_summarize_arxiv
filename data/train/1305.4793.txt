    "the effect of the second - harmonic ( sh ) generation by monochromatic light was first demonstrated in 1961 @xcite , and has been a topic of great interest ever since @xcite .",
    "the work on this theme includes many studies dealing with solitons supported by the quadratic ( @xmath2 ) nonlinearity @xcite .",
    "while the @xmath2 interactions between the fundamental - frequency ( ff ) and sh fields are sufficient for the creation of solitons , the competition between the @xmath2 nonlinearity and its cubic ( @xmath1 ) counterpart , either self - focusing or defocusing , may be an essential factor affecting the efficiency of the ff @xmath5 sh conversion .",
    "in addition to the material kerr effect , it was predicted @xcite and experimentally demonstrated @xcite that @xmath1 nonlinearity can be _ engineered _ by means of the quasi - phase - matching ( qpm ) technique , which makes it possible to control the modulational instability @xcite and pulse compression @xcite in the medium .",
    "the @xmath1 nonlinearity may also be induced by semiconductor dopants implanted into the @xmath2 material @xcite-@xcite .",
    "effects of competing @xmath6 nonlinearities on spatial solitons were analyzed in detail @xcite-@xcite .",
    "it was predicted that stable two - color solitons , built of the ff and sh components , exist in media with the self - defocusing sign of the cubic nonlinearity , where the solitons do not exist in the absence of the @xmath2 interactions @xcite .",
    "it has also been shown that the self - focusing @xmath1 term supports single - color solitary waves built solely of the sh  component , but they are prone to destabilization by the @xmath2 interactions . in fact , the single - color solitons are always unstable when they coexist with the two - color ones bang - kivshar - buryak-98 .    the soliton dynamics in symmetric dual - core systems , alias couplers , has also drawn a great deal of attention , starting from the analysis of solitons and their bifurcations in the model of twin - core optical fibers with the intra - core kerr nonlinearity @xcite-@xcite , which was recently followed by the consideration of the soliton stability in the coupler combining the kerr terms with the parity - time ( @xmath7 ) symmetry , represented by equal gain and loss coefficients in the coupled cores @xcite .",
    "a similar analysis was reported for spatial solitons in planar dual - core symmetric waveguides with intrinsic @xmath2 nonlinearity @xcite,@xcite . in all the cases ,",
    "the increase of the total energy or power of the soliton ( in the temporal or spatial domain , respectively ) leads to the symmetry - breaking bifurcation ( sbb ) , the difference being that the bifurcation is subcritical or supercritical in the couplers with the @xmath1 and @xmath2 nonlinear terms , respectively .",
    "these bifurcations are important examples of the phenomenology of the spontaneous symmetry breaking of localized modes in nonlinear media @xcite .",
    "these findings suggest one to consider dual - core systems with _ competing _ self - focusing and self - defocusing nonlinearities , where the increase of the total power may , at first , convert symmetric solitons into asymmetric ones through the sbb , which is followed , at larger powers , by an inverse symmetry - restoring bifurcation ( srb ) , if the self - defocusing dominates at high powers . a natural model of this type",
    "is based on the coupler with a combination of self - focusing cubic and self - defocusing quintic intra - core nonlinear terms @xcite .",
    "the analysis has demonstrated the existence of the corresponding _",
    "bifurcation loops_. a similar effect was demonstrated in an allied model , based on the nonlinear schrdinger equation including the combination of the cubic - quintic ( cq ) terms and a double - well potential , which represents a double - channel trapping structure built into the single waveguide @xcite .",
    "dynamical switching between channels in the latter system was studied too @xcite .",
    "these results suggest that couplers with competing nonlinearities have a potential for applications to all - optical data processing .",
    "saturable nonlinearity is somewhat similar to the combination of the competing cq terms . in this context",
    ", it is relevant to refer to earlier works which analyzed the sbb and dynamical switching of solitons in the coupler with the saturable intra - core nonlinearity @xcite-@xcite .",
    "however , that system does not give rise to bifurcation loops , as it does not feature a switch between the self - focusing and defocusing with the increase of power .",
    "the above - mentioned @xmath6 combination of interactions is another natural setting for the realization of the coupler with competing intra - core nonlinearities .",
    "in fact , this setting is more realistic for experimental realization , as it is not easy to find photonic materials demonstrating a dominant quintic term without conspicuous losses , while the self - defocusing @xmath1 terms may be induced by means of the above - mentioned techniques .",
    "the study of both two- and single - color solitons , their stability , bifurcations , and interactions in such a system is the subject of the present work .",
    "the model is formulated in section ii .",
    "the main results , in the form of bifurcation diagrams ( which feature the loops ) for two - color solitons in the model with the self - defocusing @xmath4 nonlinearity , are reported in section iii .",
    "in addition to systematic numerical results , we also propose a qualitative explanation of the existence of the loop , and its collapse which occurs with the increase of the strength of the linear coupling between the cores , based on the cascading approximation for the @xmath2 interaction , to which the @xmath3-induced xpm ( cross - phase - modulation ) interaction is added . in section iii , we also consider spontaneous transformation of unstable solitons into breathers , and collisions between moving ( spatially tilted ) stable ones .",
    "results for single - color ( sh ) solitons in the system with the self - focusing @xmath1 terms are produced in section iv .",
    "the paper is concluded by section v.",
    "we consider the co - propagation of the ff and sh fields , @xmath8 and @xmath9 , in the symmetric coupler ( subscripts @xmath10 and @xmath11 pertain to its two cores ) , with the combined @xmath6 nonlinearity in its cores .",
    "the setting , that does not include losses and spatial walkoff ( which are negligible for relatively short propagation distances available to the experiment ) , is described by the system of linearly - coupled propagation equations in the spatial domain , which can be readily derived as a combination of those introduced earlier in refs .",

    "these equations were solved  numerically by means of the newton - raphson method based on a finite - difference scheme .",
    "the asymmetry of solitons with unequal amplitudes in the two cores , @xmath27 and @xmath28 , is measured by @xmath29this parameter is defined in terms of the ff component only , as its amplitudes in the two - color solitons are always essentially larger than the sh amplitudes .",
    "the stability of the soliton solutions was investigated by means of direct simulations of the perturbed evolution within the framework of eqs .",
    "the simulations were carried out using the fourth - order runge - kutta algorithm .",
    "the bifurcation loops are produced in the next section for @xmath30 i.e. , the self - defocusing sign of the @xmath1 nonlinearity .",
    "this choice is necessary , once we aim to consider the competing nonlinear interactions , @xmath2 ( effectively self - focusing , in the cascading limit @xcite ) and @xmath1 .",
    "most results will be presented for @xmath31 , as this value of the mismatch adequately represents the generic situation .",
    "however , some essential findings ( the critical size of the coupling , @xmath32 , at which the bifurcation loop shrinks to zero ) are included too for other values of @xmath13 .",
    "the parameters are different in section iv dealing with single - color solitons .",
    "in particular , @xmath33 is fixed in that case , as such solitons exist only for the self - focusing @xmath1 nonlinearity .",
    "because the asymmetry of the solitons produced by the sbb , defined as per eq .",
    "( [ asymmetry - ratio ] ) , is their most important characteristic , the bifurcation diagrams were generated by varying propagation constant @xmath34 and plotting the respective results in the form of @xmath35 [ see eq .",
    "( [ asymmetry - ratio ] ) ] vs. the total power , @xmath36 , at fixed values of the ff coupling constant , @xmath17 , and for @xmath37 .",
    "the latter assumption is relevant , as the evanescent field , which accounts for the inter - core coupling , decays faster in the sh component .",
    "in fact , results were also obtained for @xmath38 showing slight additional shrinkage of the bifurcation loops displayed in figs .",
    "[ fig1 ] and [ fig2 ] .",
    "for instance , for the same values of @xmath39 and @xmath40 , which correspond to fig .",
    "[ fig1](b ) , the increase of @xmath18 from zero to @xmath41 leads to a decrease of the largest power at which the asymmetric solitons exist by @xmath42 .",
    "figures [ fig1 ] and [ fig2 ] demonstrate the bifurcation loops of two different types : concave and convex , at smaller and larger values of @xmath17 , respectively .",
    "the increase of @xmath17 leads to the shrinkage of the loop , which vanishes (  collapses \" ) , for @xmath40 , at @xmath43 .    , are displayed by means of the dependence of asymmetry measure ( asymmetry - ratio ) on the total power ( norm ) , @xmath36 : ( a ) @xmath44 , ( b ) @xmath45 , ( c ) @xmath46 , ( d ) @xmath47 . here and in the next figure , as well in fig .",

    "( d ) , the short unstable segment of the symmetric solitons inside the loops is not plotted . ]    we have also performed the analysis for other values of the mismatch . the results are summarized in fig .",
    "[ fig : num&anal ] , in the form of curve @xmath53 , which is displayed along with qualitative estimate ( [ q ] ) derived below .    ,",
    "at which the bifurcation loop collapses , versus the phase mismatch , @xmath54 .",
    "the dashed - dotted curve represents the crude analytical approximation for @xmath55 given by eq .",
    "( [ q ] ) . ]",
    "the concave bifurcation loop connects the symmetry - breaking and restoring bifurcations of the super- and subcritical types , respectively , while both bifurcations are supercritical if they are connected by a convex loop . in agreement with the general principles of the bifurcation theory book , springer , segments of the branches of asymmetric solitons in the concave loop , which connect the point of the supercritical sbb with the turning points , are stable , while the segments which link the turning points to the point of the subcritical srb are unstable . as might be expected too , the branches of the symmetric solitons , corresponding to @xmath56 in figs .",
    "[ fig1 ] and [ fig2 ] , are unstable inside the loop , and stable outside .",
    "basic properties of the bifurcation loop can be qualitatively explained by means of an extended form of the well - known cascading approximation , which is used to eliminate (  enslave \" ) the sh field in favor of the ff , when the mismatch is large and the diffraction term may be neglected in the equations for the sh @xcite ( a more sophisticated version of the cascading approximation , which makes use of the fourier decomposition of periodic structures , was developed in refs .",
    "a , f , c for systems based on qpm gratings ) .",
    "this approximation implies that the amplitude of the sh field is much smaller than its ff counterpart , hence , applying the approximation to the sh equations in system ( eqs - stationary - substitution ) , it is necessary to take the xpm term into account .",
    "thus , the cascading limit yields , in the present case,@xmath57 } , ~n=1,2,\\]]where , as said above , we set @xmath58 .",
    "then , the substitution of this expression into the ff equations of system ( [ eqs - stationary - substitution ] ) yields a pair of linearly coupled equations with an effective saturable nonlinearity:@xmath59    unlike the system of coupled equations with the cubic nonlinearity fibers1-@xcite , the sbb  point can not be found in an exact form in this model .",
    "however , for a crude estimate one may treat it as cubic system with effective coefficients@xmath60 , \\label{coeff}\\]]taken at the soliton s center .",
    "after that , the application of the well - known exact result for the sbb point in the cubic system @xcite to the system with coefficients ( [ coeff ] ) yields and equation which predicts the peak power of the symmetric solitons at the bifurcation points , @xmath61:@xmath62obviously , too roots of this quadratic equation correspond to the sbb and srb points bounding the bifurcation loop .",
    "further , in the framework of the present approximation , the above - mentioned critical value of the coupling constant , @xmath32 , at which the loop collapses , i.e. , the sbb  and srb points merge into one , is identified as a value of @xmath17 at which the discriminant of eq .",
    "( [ quadr ] ) vanishes .",
    "the latter condition readily leads to the following result:@xmath63    as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : num&anal ] , the analytical result strongly overestimates the actual values of @xmath32 ( which is not surprising , as the analysis is quite coarse ) , but , nevertheless , the approximation provides an explanation of the existence of the bifurcation loop , as well as the trend of @xmath32 to decrease with the increases of @xmath13 at @xmath64 .",
    "the decrease of the discrepancy with the increase of the mismatch , @xmath13 , is a natural feature of the cascading approximation .",
    "direct numerical simulations demonstrate that the unstable symmetric solitons evolve towards breathers oscillating around either of the stable asymmetric soliton existing at the same total power ( not shown here in detail , as the picture is similar to that observed in previously studied models ) .",
    "this transition gives rise to very little radiation loss , i.e. , the dynamical symmetry breaking practically keeps the initial total power .",
    "more interesting is the spontaneous transformation of asymmetric solitons belonging to the unstable segments of the concave loop , which is a specific feature of the present setting , see fig .",
    "an example , displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , demonstrates that these unstable solitons spontaneously evolve into breathers , which are symmetric on the average , with the fields in the two cores oscillating out of phase , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3_extra ] .",
    "overall , this effect may be considered as _",
    "dynamical resymmetrization _ of the solitons .",
    "this transition also conserves the initial power of the unstable soliton almost exactly , and the emerging breathers emit virtually no radiation waves .",

    "this invariance makes it natural to consider collisions between spatial solitons tilted in opposite directions .",
    "direct simulations of the collisions make it possible to draw the following conclusions .    at low powers , the collisions are , as might be expected , nearly elastic , and do not affect tracks of the  two beams , see an example in fig .",

    "therefore , we here fix @xmath70 and @xmath71 .",

    "the numerical investigation demonstrates that this transition occurs at @xmath72 @xmath73 @xmath74 .",
    "it has been inferred that the single - color solitons are stable _ precisely _ at those values of the propagation constant , @xmath21 [ see eq .",

    "[ fig7 ] . the instability results in a very fast transformation of the soliton into its stable two - color counterpart , practically without radiative loss of the total power .",
    "[ width=]unstable - v - type - asymmetric.jpg    thus , there are two possible causes for the destabilization of the single - color sh solitons .",
    "one is the coexistence with two - color ones , which triggers the parametric instability against excitation of ff perturbations .",
    "the other instability is caused by the sbb which transforms the symmetric single - color solitons into asymmetric ones ( which themselves are unstable , as shown in fig .",

    "the horizontal segment of the boundary corresponds to the sbb at @xmath83 , at which the destabilizing bifurcation happens ( see fig .",
    "[ fig6b ] ) .",
    "obviously , this critical power does not depend on @xmath13 , as the phase mismatch amounts to a trivial shift of the sh propagation constant when the ff field is absent . on the other hand ,",
    "the slanted segment with a nearly constant slope accounts for the parametric instability against the generation of the ff field , when the single - color soliton coexists with a two - color one . in all the cases ,",
