    "at the scale of the order of the debye and plasmon masses , gauge theories at high temperature can no longer be adequately described by ordinary thermal perturbation theory .",
    "a consistent approach requires the so - called hard thermal loop expansion @xcite .",
    "although successful in resolving many paradoxes , there still remain some fundamental problems in certain limits .",
    "a particular problem is that of the damping rate of a fast fermion , where self - consistent schemes outside of the hard thermal loop expansion have been used @xcite .",
    "another class of problems arises whenever soft external momenta are light - like .",
    "this is the case with the soft photon production rate estimates @xcite .",
    "basically , like the hard thermal loops themselves , the polarization tensor involved in the calculation of such processes develops collinear singularities . in the same context",
    ", a resummation of asymptotic thermal masses for hard modes , the so - called improved hard thermal loop scheme , leaves the gauge invariance of the effective action intact while screening the divergences @xcite .",
    "but in these cases , another candidate for the removal of the collinear singularities would be the damping term for hard modes .",
    "this was suggested for example in another estimate of the soft photon production rate @xcite .",
    "indeed , through the interactions with soft modes , the damping is anomalously large @xmath3 .",
    "however if @xmath4 has to be taken into account , modifying only the propagators violates the ward identities . in abelian theories",
    "the latter give @xmath5 , but it turns out that @xmath6 vertex corrections are necessary to restore gauge invariance and leads to a ladder resummation .",
    "the latter arise for instance in the context of the eikonal expansion of gauge theories @xcite . in the infrared limit of the polarization tensor in hot @xmath0 @xcite , using a constant damping , it was found that the damping term gets eliminated from all the components of @xmath7 .",
    "subsequent works @xcite in scalar @xmath0 have reached the same conclusion for specific limits . recently a general way to get the cancellation of the damping term , via simple algebraic compensations , has been put forward @xcite . besides the non - transversality of the polarization tensor mentioned above ,",
    "there is another argument concerning gauge invariance if the case of a non - constant damping is considered .",
    "it is known that when evaluating the damping rate , keeping the external line on mass - shell with a finite infrared cutoff leads to a gauge independent contribution @xcite . but with fermion propagators related to specific internal lines of the polarization tensor , the integration over the real axis usually leaves the momentum off mass - shell . for hard fermions",
    "there are gauge dependent pieces off mass - shell besides the factor @xmath8 , at least when going beyond a simple logarithmic approximation .",
    "a general compensation of the damping term seems therefore necessary .",
    "these considerations do not concern directly the estimates of the soft photon production rate .",
    "the definition of the latter ( in covariant gauges ) involves the trace @xmath9 .",
    "this term is subleading compared to the order of the hard thermal loops ( @xmath10 ) and requires more involved calculations .",
    "the approximations justified at the @xmath10 level and which are presented in the following are no longer valid in this case .",
    "nevertheless the soft photon rate calculations share basic features with the current analysis .",
    "the fact that ladders contribute , both in the infrared and the light - cone limit , at the same leading order as the @xmath10 is due to a resonance of denominators @xcite . the same resonance of denominators occurs for the soft photon rate and leads to a mechanism of enhancement when regularizing the collinear divergences with the fermion asymptotic mass @xcite .",
    "the bremsstrahlung processes dominate over previous estimates based on the soft fermion loop computations @xcite . now the bremsstrahlung diagrams can be seen as a first step towards a resummation of higher order graphs .",
    "this is highly expected , from the considerations above concerning @xmath7 at leading order on the light - cone , and also from semi - classical calculations taken into account the landau - pomeranchuk - migdal effect @xcite .",
    "finally the following study about the cancellation of damping terms casts doubt concerning attempts to regularize the photon rate in the manner proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite , even if a direct investigation remains to be done .",
    "therefore , already at the order of the @xmath10 , an important motivation is to make explicit the equivalence between the infrared and the light - cone limit . in that respect",
    "there are two technical new points compared to previous studies about ladders .",
    "the first one is that ref .",
    "@xcite left ambiguities with an ill - defined expression for the vertex solution of the bethe - salpeter equation .",
    "such ambiguities prevented a rigorous cancellation of damping terms .",
    "this problem can be overcome by reproducing a structure similar to the landau damping contributions at the @xmath10 level , _",
    "i.e. _ a separation between a positive energy and a negative energy part .",
    "the second point is that diagrammatically , in order to consider a compensation of a non - constant damping rate , it is necessary to go beyond a simple ladder resummation by taking into account at leading order a more general set of graphs .",
    "thus in the infrared region the usual @xmath10 term will be recovered , as it was already expected from arguments using simplified models ( constant damping ) and using also the kinetic approach @xcite .",
    "another motivation is to check the validity of the so - called improved @xmath10 resummation scheme on the light - cone .",
    "several works have been devoted to the cancellation of ladder graphs in an effective expansion .",
    "it is therefore not necessary to enter into details on this topic .",
    "but it is worth recalling , even very briefly , the power counting argument which leads to a ladder resummation .",
    "the retarded/ advanced formalism @xcite is used , since the structure of green functions as tree - like diagrams can easily be seen .",
    "however all the calculations could be performed using a different real time formalism , for example the schwinger - keldysh technique @xcite .",
    "an important point is that leading terms are given by trees associated with cut internal lines for the photons . for the simple one - loop @xmath11 vertex where @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 are respectively the photon momentum and the incoming and outgoing fermion momenta , and the particular example of an exchanged transverse photon of momentum @xmath15 , splitting the product of fermion propagators @xmath16 along the ways describes in ref .",
    "@xcite gives @xmath17 an estimate of the expression above can be done if the denominator @xmath18 is of the same order as @xmath19 @xmath20 under what circumstances this approximation can actually be made and the denominator extracted from the integral remains to be seen .",
    "the difference of the self - energies written above has the same order as the damping rate , namely @xmath21 .",
    "this is compensated by the factor @xmath22 from the term @xmath23 .",
    "the vertex is therefore of the same order as its tree - level counterpart and this implies a resummation of ladder diagrams    with the exchanges of both transverse and longitudinal soft photons .",
    "the reasoning above was made with bare fermion propagators , but when a hard electron or positron is close to its mass - shell , a resummation of its self - energy is necessary .",
    "the latter involves one - loop contributions with a bare fermion propagator for the longitudinal photon case and a resummed fermion propagator for the transverse photon exchange .",
    "it can be shown that the ladders cancel against the corresponding self - energies without vertex correction .",
    "this is due to a mechanism related to the ward identities .",
    "but with the landau damping part of the transverse photon spectral density and the absence of debye screening , the momenta can reach the very soft scale @xmath21 .",
    "this may change the estimate of multi - loop diagrams . if self - energies with vertex corrections contribute at leading order as well , as it was pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite , then graphs other than ladders might be relevant for consistency and it is necessary to go beyond what has been done in previous works @xcite .",
    "an estimate of the multi - loop graphs can be made using the simplified transverse spectral density introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite @xmath24 an evaluation of the imaginary part of the two - loop self - energy , with @xmath13 on - shell , yields @xmath25 where @xmath26 is a lower cutoff of order @xmath21 .",
    "this result can also be derived within a more complete and rigorous analysis @xcite using well known sum rules ( see for instance refs .",
    "it justifies the fact that , within a pure logarithmic accuracy , such graphs were discarded @xcite , but become necessary when going beyond this approximation in order to consider a general ( non - constant ) damping term .    for consistency",
    "this last remark implies that the vertex for a photon in the infrared region or near the light - cone must contain at least , not only ladders , but ladders with vertex corrections .",
    "it turns out that non - planar diagrams like the crossed graph    contribute also at the same leading order as the tree - level vertex .",
    "the crossed diagram is of the same order as the quantity @xmath27 and is therefore not suppressed by an extra factor @xmath28 contrary to what has been claimed in refs .",
    "@xcite . in this estimate @xmath26 and the plasma frequency @xmath29",
    "are respectively the lower ( of order @xmath21 ) and upper ( of order @xmath30 ) cutoffs , @xmath31 and @xmath32 the moduli of @xmath33 and @xmath34 .    as for graphs with hard photon exchanges",
    "non - trivial compensations between the trace and some denominators kill the mechanism of enhancement encountered before",
    ". therefore only diagrams with soft transverse photons have to be added and their resummation along with the ladder expansion is summarized in the bethe - salpeter equation with an infinite kernel .",
    "the latter is the sum of one ladder , the subset of two - loop graphs , three - loop graphs etc ... fermion propagators are resummed and , besides the one - loop diagrams mentioned above , a two - loop vertex correction with transverse photons , three - loop , etc ... must be added .",
    "this is consistent with the mechanism of cancellation of self - energies in the polarization tensor which now has to be investigated .",
    "a method for including the relevant diagrams when going beyond the logarithmic approximation must now be considered .",
    "this is summarized in the bethe - salpeter equation @xmath35 where @xmath36 which involves an infinite kernel of four - fermion amplitudes that can not be disconnected by cutting two fermion lines ( to avoid overcounting ) .",
    "the first term of this equation represents the simple ladder resummation with resummed fermion propagators and soft longitudinal and transverse photons .",
    "the second term contains the summation of the two - loop graphs , namely the crossed diagram and the two ladders with one vertex correction .",
    "these diagrams involve only ( very ) soft transverse photons , as the absence of debye screening allows to reach the scale @xmath21 which compensates the extra factor @xmath28 when adding a further loop .",
    "the subsequent contributions describe the resummation of the \" three - loop , four - loop graphs , etc ...    now the resummed fermion propagators involves the self - energy at leading order when @xmath37 is close to the mass - shell .",
    "first this leading order contribution includes the _ hard thermal loop _ term with the effective ( and constant ) asymptotic mass for a hard fermion @xmath38 second it must contain also all the exchanges with soft photons . it is then useful to define the quantity @xmath39 the imaginary part of which just corresponds to the ( general and non - constant ) damping rate .",
    "the propagator reads @xmath40 discarding the damping term would allow to recover the form advocated in ref .",
    "an important starting point is to decompose the resummed propagator into a positive energy part and its negative counterpart @xmath41 where @xmath42^{1/2}$ ] . keeping in mind this canonical decomposition ,",
    "an estimate @xcite enables to guess the expression of an _ improved _ vertex @xmath43 where new vectors can be defined @xmath44 in order for the above vertex to satisfy ward identities .",
    "these vectors are equal to the unit vectors @xmath45 and @xmath46 plus soft contributions unimportant in the determination of the leading order part of the polarization tensor .",
    "it is now necessary to check that for very soft external photons , this vertex is indeed the solution of the bethe - salpeter solution , even though more complicated diagrams than the ladders have been included .",
    "it is also important to see to what extent it is still a solution of ( [ betsal ] ) in the light - cone limit .",
    "the simple ladder resummation has been extensively considered in the litterature . here",
    "the additional input is the separation of the expression of the vertex between a positive energy part and its negative counterpart .",
    "this results from the canonical decomposition of the resummed fermion propagators and due to the basic assumption of an energetic fermion emitting or absorbing soft photons . sticking the expression ( [ completeform ] ) into the first term of the bethe - salpeter equation",
