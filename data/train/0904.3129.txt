    "in particular , @xmath18 is a finite group and moreover , @xmath19 , @xmath20 .    in the next section we study",
    "the orientation double cover of a nonorientable surface and we investigate relation between mapping class groups of the nonorientable surface and its orientation double cover .",
    "furthermore , we describe maximal abelian subgroups of the mapping class group of nonorientable surfaces and construct some special type of abelian subgroup of the mapping class group of nonorientable surface .    in section  [ dehn ] we characterize the dehn twists about circles on a closed nonorientable surface using the ideas of ivanov s analogous work on the orientable surface @xcite .    in section  [ outaut ] , we prove that the outer automorphism of @xmath21 injects into @xmath4 if @xmath22 , on the other hand , the outer automorphism of @xmath23 injects into the mapping class group of sphere with 4 holes if @xmath24",

    "let @xmath26 be the orientation double cover of the nonorientable surface @xmath6 with the deck transformation @xmath27 .",

    "moreover , if the euler characteristic of the surface is negative ( hence it carries a complete hyperbolic metric ) then any isotopy of orientation preserving diffeomorphisms of @xmath32 , whose end maps commute with the deck transformation @xmath41 , can be deformed into one which commutes with @xmath41 , and hence descends to an isotopy of @xmath39 ( c.f . lemma 5 in @xcite ) .",

    "indeed , in the orientable surface case , ivanov showed that any maximal abelian subgroup of @xmath69 is of this type ( @xcite ) .",

    "examples of pseudo - anosov mappings on the surfaces @xmath104 , @xmath105 and @xmath106 are well known . for the nonorientable surface @xmath107 ,",
