    "in the course of evolution , pathogens have developed various methods of evading the immune system of their hosts .",
    "whilst there are many contributing factors that determine individuals aspects of host - parasite interactions , from a more general perspectives strategies of immune escape can be divided into two major classes . in the first class , parasites remain largely invisible to the immune system of their host through an extended period latency when production of new viruses or bacteria inside the host organism is very small or absent . in this case , the pathogens do not trigger immune response , and thus are able to remain undetected in their hosts for long periods of time . notable examples of such pathogens include various viruses , such as members of herpes virus family @xcite and retroviruses @xcite .",
    "whilst this method of immune escape is largely unavailable to bacteria due to fundamental differences in replication strategies , several types of bacteria have shown persistence for long periods of time with little evident replication ; examples include mycobacteria and _ t. pallidum _ causing syphilis @xcite .",
    "another possible strategy of immune escape is that , in which pathogen is actively replicating in its host , but this replication is dynamically regulated by the host immune system .",
    "there are two ways how this regulation can be achieved : the pathogen can either reach a certain chronic state ( equilibrium ) through the balance of its proliferation and destruction ( see @xcite for _ trypanosoma cruzi _",
    "example ) , or it can go through the process of _ antigenic variation _ , whereby it keeps escaping immune response by constantly changing its surface proteins , thus going through a large number of antigenic variants . perhaps , the best studied pathogens relying on this strategy for immune escape are _ plasmodium falciparum _ and african trypanosoma exemplified by _ trypanosoma brucei _",
    ", with other examples including several families of viruses , bacteria and even fungi @xcite .    in the case of",
    "_ t. brucei _ , the organism that causes sleeping sickness , parasite covers itself with a dense homogeneous coat of variant surface glycoprotein ( vsg ) .",
    "genome of _ t.",
    "brucei _ has over 1000 genes that control the expression of vsg protein , and switching between them provides the mechanism of antigenic variation @xcite . what makes _ t. brucei _",
    "unique is the fact that unlike other pathogens , whose antigenic variation is typically mediated by dna rearrangements or transcriptional regulation , activation of vsgs requires recombination of vsg genes into an expression site ( es ) , which consists of a single _ vsg _ gene flanked by an upstream array of 70 base pair repeats and expression site associated genes ( esags ) .",
    "_ t. brucei _ expresses one vsg at any given time , and the active vsg can either be selected by activation of a previously silent es ( and there are up to 20 es sites ) , or by recombination of a vsg sequence into the active es .",
    "the precise mechanism of vsg switching has not been completely identified yet , but it has been suggested that the ordered appearance of different vsg variants is controlled by differential activation rates and density - dependent parasite differentiation @xcite .    for the malaria agent _",
    "p. falciparum _ , the main target of immune response is _ plasmodium falciparum _ erythrocyte membrane protein-1 ( pfemp1 ) , which is expressed from a diverse family of _ var _ genes , and each parasite genome contains approximately 60 _ var _ genes encoding different pfemp1 variants @xcite .",
    "the _ var _",
    "genes are expressed sequentially in a mutually exclusive manner , and this switching between expression of different _ var _ gene leads to the presentation of different variant surface antigens ( vsa ) on the surface of infected erythrocyte , thus providing a mechanism of antigenic variation @xcite . in all cases of antigenic variation ,",
    "host immune system has to go through a large repertoire of antigenic variants , and this provides parasites with enough time to get transmitted to another host or cause a subsequent infection with a different antigenic variant in the same host .    despite individual differences in the molecular implementation of antigenic variation , such as , gene conversion , site - specific dna inversions , hypermutation etc .",
    ", there are several features common to the dynamics of antigenic variation in all pathogens .",
    "these include ordered and often sequential appearance of parasitemia peaks corresponding to different antigenic variants , as well as certain degree of cross - reactivity .",
    "several mathematical models have been put forward that aim to explain various aspects of antigenic variation .",
    "_ @xcite have studied a model of antigenic variation of african trypanosomes which suggests that sequential appearance of different antigenic variants can be explained by fitness differences between single- and double - expressors - antigenic variants that express one or two vsgs . however , this idea is not supported by the experimental evidence arising from normal _ in vivo _ growth and reduced immunogenicity of artificially created double expressors @xcite .",
    "frank @xcite has suggested a model that highlights the importance of cross - reactivity between antigenic variants in facilitating optimal switching pattern that provides sequential dominance and extended infection .",
    "_ @xcite have considered variant - transcending immunity as a basis for competition between variants , which can promote oscillatory behaviour , but this failed to induce sequential expression .",
    "many other mathematical models of antigenic variation have been proposed and studied in the literature , but the discussion of their individuals merits and limitations is beyond the scope of this work .    in this paper",
    "we concentrate a model proposed by recker _",
    "@xcite ( to be referred to as recker model ) , which postulates that in addition to a highly variant - specific immune response , the dynamics of each variant is also affected by cross - reactive immune responses against a set of epitopes not unique to this variant .",
    "this assumption implies that each antigenic variant experiences two types of immune responses : a long - lasting immune response against epitopes unique to it , and a transient immune response against epitopes that it shares with other variants .",
    "the main impact of this model lies in its ability to explain a sequential appearance of antigenic variants purely on the basis of cross - reactive inhibitory immune responses between variants sharing some of their epitopes , without the need to resort to variable switch rates or growth rates ( see gupta @xcite for a discussion of several clinical studies in ghana , kenya and india , which support this theory ) .    from mathematical perspective",
    ", certain understanding has been achieved of various types of dynamics that can be obtained in the recker model . in the case when long - lasting immune responses do not decay",
    ", numerical simulations in the original paper @xcite showed that eventually all antigenic variants will be cleared by the immune system , with specific immune responses reaching protective levels preventing each of the variants from showing up again .",
    "blyuss and gupta @xcite have demonstrated that the sequential appearance of parasitemia peaks during such immune clearance can be explained by the existence of a hypersurface of equilibria in the phase space of the system , with individual trajectories approaching this hypersurface and then being pushed away along stable / unstable manifolds of the saddle - centres lying on the hypersurface .",
    "they also numerically analysed robustness of synchronization between individual variants . under assumption of perfect synchrony ,",
    "when all variants are identical to each other , recker and gupta @xcite have analysed peak dynamics and threshold for chronicity , while mitchell and carr @xcite have investigated the additional effect of time delay in the development of immune response . de",
    "leenheer and pilyugin @xcite have replaced linear growth of antigenic variants in the original model by the logistic growth , and have studied the effects of various types of cross - reactivity on the dynamics , ranging from no cross - reactivity to partial and complete cross - immunty .",
    "mitchell and carr @xcite have studied the appearance of synchronous and asynchronous oscillations in the case of global coupling between variants ( referred to as `` perfect cross immunity '' in @xcite ) .",
    "so far , mathematical analyses of the recker model have concentrated primarily on identifying and studying different types of behaviour in the model . whilst this has given a certain headway in the understanding of possible dynamics , symmetric properties of the model",
    "have remained largely unstudied , and yet they can provide important insights into the dynamics of the model allowing one to distinguish the interactions between variants and the immune system from the effects of topology of coupling between antigenic variants .",
    "the importance of this topology has been highlighted in recent works @xcite . in this paper",
    "we study recker model from the perspective of symmetric dynamical systems .",
    "this allows us to perform a systematic analysis of steady states and their stability , as well as to classify various periodic behaviours in terms of their symmetries .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows . in the next section",
    "we formalize the recker model and discuss some of its properties .",
    "section 3 reviews some concepts and techniques from equivariant bifurcation theory . in section 4",
    "we analyse steady states and their stability with account for symmetry properties of the system .",
    "section 5 is devoted to symmetry - based classification of different dynamical regimes .",
    "the paper concludes in section 6 with discussion of results .",
    "following recker _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , we assume that within a human host , the parasite population of _ p. falciparum _ consists of @xmath0 distinct antigenic variants , with each antigenic variant @xmath1 , @xmath2 , containing a single unique major epitope that elicits a long - lived ( specific ) immune response , and also several minor epitopes that are not unique to the variant . assuming that all variants have the same net growth rate @xmath3 , their temporal dynamics is described by the equation @xmath4 where @xmath5 and @xmath6 denote the rates of variant destruction by the long - lasting immune response @xmath7 ( specific to variant @xmath1 ) and by the transient immune response @xmath8 , respectively .",
    "the dynamics of the variant - specific immune response can be written in its simplest form as @xmath9 with @xmath10 being the proliferation rate and @xmath11 being the decay rate of the specific immune response .",
    "finally , the transient ( cross - reactive ) immune response can be described by the minor modification of the above equation ( [ zeq ] ) : @xmath12 where the sum is taken over all variants @xmath13 sharing the epitopes with the variant @xmath1 .",
    "we shall use the terms long - lasting and specific immune response interchangeably , likewise for transient and cross - reactive .",
    "the above system can be formalized with the help of adjacency or connectivity matrix @xmath14 whose entries @xmath15 are equal to one if the variants @xmath1 and @xmath13 share some of their minor epitopes and equal to zero otherwise @xcite .",
    "obviously , the matrix @xmath14 is always a symmetric matrix .",
    "prior to constructing this matrix it is important to introduce an ordering of the variants according to their epitopes . whilst this choice is pretty arbitrary",
    ", it has to be fixed before the analysis can be done . consider a system of antigenic variants with just two minor epitopes and two variants in each epitope . in this case , the total number of variants is four , and we enumerate them as follows @xmath16        after the ordering of variants has been fixed , it is straightforward to construct the connectivity matrix @xmath14 of variant interactions . for the particular system of variants ( [ var4 ] )",
    "illustrated in fig .",
    "[ vars ] , this matrix has the form @xmath17    with the help of lexicographic ordering , one can systematically construct matrix @xmath14 for an arbitrary number of minor epitopes @xcite .",
    "for the rest of the paper we will concentrate on the case of two minor epitopes , but the results can be generalized to larger systems of antigenic variants .",
    "using the connectivity matrix one can rewrite the system ( [ yeq])-([weq ] ) in a vector form @xmath18 where @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 denotes a vector of the length @xmath0 with all components equal to one , and in the right - hand side of the first equation multiplication is taken to be entry - wise , so that the output is a vector again .",
    "the above system has to be augmented by appropriate initial conditions , which are taken to be @xmath23 as it has been shown in @xcite , with these initial conditions the system ( [ vs ] ) is well - posed , so its solutions remain non - negative for all time .",
    "we will assume that cross - reactive immune responses develop at a slower rate than specific immune responses , have a shorter life time , and are less efficient in destroying the infection .",
    "this implies the following biologically realistic relations between the system parameters @xmath24",
    "before proceeding with the analysis of symmetry effects on the dynamics of systems of antigenic variants , we recall some concepts and results from equivariant bifurcation theory @xcite . let @xmath25 be a compact lie group acting on @xmath26 .",
    "we say that a system of odes @xmath27 is _ equivariant _ with respect to a symmetry group @xmath28 if the vector field @xmath29 commutes with the action of @xmath28 , i.e. if it satisfies an equivariance condition @xmath30 the main examples of the symmetry groups we are interested in are @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 ( of order @xmath34 , @xmath35 , and @xmath36 , respectively ) . here , @xmath37 denotes the symmetric group of all permutations in a network with an all - to - all coupling , i.e. all permutations on @xmath35 symbols .",

    "it is worth noting , however , that in a particular case when @xmath207 , the determinant of the system of linear equations that describes the steady states is equal to zero , and this results in the existence of a line of equilibria @xmath208 parameterized by an additional free parameter @xmath209 .",
    "this line is reminiscent of the hypersurface of equilibria in the case @xmath210 in that every point on each such line is a steady state of the system ( [ vs ] ) , and as one moves along the line of equilibria , stability of the steady states can change , as illustrated in fig .",
    "one can observe that as the decay rate of the specific immune responses increases , this leads to stabilization of such steady states , and provided this rate is sufficiently high , all steady states on lines of equilibria are stable .",
    "in the previous section we established that a fully symmetric steady state @xmath104 can undergo hopf bifurcation , giving rise to a stable anti - phase periodic solution . now we look at the evolution of this solution and its symmetries under changes in system parameters . for convenience",

    "figure ( c ) indicates that as @xmath6 increases , the periodic solution retains its symmetry but changes temporal profile , acquiring two peaks during a single period .",
    "when analysing other types of periodic behaviour in the model , one can note that according to the @xmath84 theorem ( see section  [ ebt ] ) , periodic states can have spatio - temporal symmetry group pairs @xmath214 only if @xmath84 is cyclic , and @xmath78 is an isotropy subgroup @xcite . in the case of @xmath114 symmetry group acting on four elements ,",
    "there are eleven pairs of subgroup @xmath77 and @xmath78 satisfying these requirements @xcite .",

    "( d ) and ( e ) .",
    "the solution shown in fig .",
    "( d ) has the symmetry @xmath215 and is a discrete travelling wave , also known as a `` splay state '' @xcite , `` periodic travelling ( or rotating ) wave '' @xcite , or `` ponies on a merry - go - round '' or poms @xcite in the studies of systems of coupled oscillators . in this dynamical regime",
    "all variants appear sequentially one after another along the diagramme ( [ vars ] ) with quarter of a period difference between two neighbouring variants . from the perspective of equvariant bifurcation theory ,",
    "this solution is generic since the group @xmath216 is always one of the subgroups of the @xmath33 group for the ring coupling , or the @xmath37 group for an all - to - all coupling , and its existence has already been extensively studied @xcite . from the immunological point of view",
    ", this is an extremely important observation that effectively such solution , which immunologically represents sequential appearance of parasitemia peaks corresponding to different antigenic variants , owes its existence not to the individual dynamics of antigenic variants , but rather to the particular symmetric nature of cross - reactive interactions between them .",
    "this immunological genericity ensures that the same conclusions hold for a wide variety of immune interactions between human host and parasites , which use antigenic variation as a mechanism of immune escape , as illustrated , for instance , by malaria , african trypanosomes , several members of _ neisseria _ family ( _ n . meningitidis _ and _ n. gonorrhoeae _ ) , _ borrelia hermsii _ etc . @xcite .",
    "another co - existing solution for the same value of @xmath6 is a state shown in fig .",
    "this solutions is characterized by the symmetry @xmath217 and corresponds to a situation , in which variants 1 and 3 are oscillating half a period out - of - phase with each other , and the variants 2 and 4 coincide and oscillate at twice the frequency of the pair ( 1,3 ) . as the value of @xmath6",
    "is increased further , the system demonstrates a state of deterministic chaos , when variants appear in arbitrary order and magnitude .",
    "these kinds of periodic and chaotic solutions have been previously identified as most relevant for the clinical analysis of blood - stage malarial infection @xcite .",
    "in this paper we have used techniques of equivariant bifurcation theory to perform a comprehensive analysis of steady states and periodic solutions in a model of antigenic variation in malaria . in the simplest case of two epitopes with two variants in each epitope ,",
    "the system is equivariant with respect to a @xmath114 symmetry group of the square . using isotypic decomposition of the phase space based on the irreducible representations of this symmetry group has allowed us to find a closed form expression for the boundary of hopf bifurcation of the fully symmetric steady state in terms of system parameters , as well as to show that for any parameter values this bifurcation leads to an anti - phase periodic solution .",
    "all other steady states have been classified in terms of their isotropy subgroups , and this has provided insights into their origin and relatedness . with the help of the @xmath84 theorem , we have classified various periodic states of the model in terms of their spatial and temporal symmetries .",
    "one of the important issues that have to be taken into account when applying methods of equivariant bifurcation theory to the models of realistic systems is the fact that these systems do not always fully preserve the assumed symmetry . in the context of modelling immune interactions between distinct antigenic variants , this means that not all variants cross - react in exactly the same quantitative manner . despite this limitation , due to the normal hyperbolicity , which is a generic property in such models , main phenomena associated with the symmetric model",
    "survive under perturbations , including symmetry - breaking perturbations .",
    "the discussion of this issue in the context of modelling sympatric speciation using a symmetric model can be found in @xcite .    whilst the analysis in this paper was constrained to the models of within - host dynamics antigenic variation , a similar approach can also be used for the population level mathematical models of multi - strain diseases .",
    "these models usually have a similar structure in that all strains / serotypes are assumed to be identical and have a certain degree of cross - protection or cross - enhancement based on antigenic distance between them @xcite .",
    "the fact that multiple strains are antigenically related introduces symmetry into a model , and this then transpires in different types of periodic behaviours observed in these models . to give one example ,",
    "almost all of these models support a solution in the form of discrete travelling wave having a symmetry @xmath218 , which represents sequential appearance of different strains @xcite . in a model studied by calvez _",
    "@xcite ( based on an earlier model of gupta _ et al . _",
    "@xcite ) , the authors study a multi - strain model having symmetry of a cube , and they find that the fully symmetric steady state can undergo hopf bifurcation and give rise to an antiphase solution with a tetrahedral symmetry , which was not expected _ a priori_. at the same time , if one looks at this system from the symmetry perspective , such periodic solution is to be expected as it has a @xmath114 symmetry , which corresponds to one of the three maximal isotropy subgroups and is therefore generically expected to arise at a hopf bifurcation @xcite .",
    "observations of this kind illustrate that taking into account symmetries of the underlying models of multi - strain diseases can help make significant inroads in understanding and classifying possible periodic behaviours in such systems .",
    "the results presented in this paper are quite generic , and the conclusions we obtained are valid for a wide range of mathematical models of antigenic variation .",
    "in fact , they are applicable to the analysis of within - host dynamics of any parasite , which exhibits similar qualitative features of immune interactions based on the degree of relatedness between its antigenic variants .",
    "the significance of this lies in the possibility to classify expected dynamical regimes of behaviour using very generic assumption regarding immune interactions , and they will still hold true provided the actual system preserves the underlying symmetries . in the model studied in this paper the degree of cross - reactivity between antigenic variants does not vary with the number of epitopes they share .",
    "it is straightforward , however , to introduce antigenic distance between antigenic variants in a manner similar to the hamming distance @xcite .",
    "such a modification would not alter the topology of the network of immune interactions but rather assign different weights to connections between different antigenic variants in such a network .",
