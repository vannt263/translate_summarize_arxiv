    "the rest of the three framed knots in the figure clearly constitute a legendrian link ( call it @xmath75 ) in @xmath76 such that each framing is one less than the thurston - bennequin number .",
    "theorem  @xcite thus tells that @xmath69 admits a stein structure .",
    "eliashberg - polterovich  @xcite proved that if a diffeomorphism @xmath77 stabilizes @xmath78 , then @xmath79 is isotopic to a self contactomorphism of @xmath76 .",

    "every @xmath3-manifold @xmath71 @xmath11 is a simply connected stein filling with @xmath0 of the same contact @xmath6-manifold @xmath85 , which is a homology 3-sphere .",

    "at least infinitely many of @xmath87 s are mutually non - diffeomorphic .",
    "@xmath15 the constructions in this paper clearly have many variations .",
    "for example , we can change link types and framings of the attaching circles of 2-handles of @xmath4 attached to @xmath70 .",
    "a more general construction in @xmath88 case and the non - simply connected case will be discussed in @xcite applying techniques in @xcite .",
    "+ @xmath18 modifying the above construction , we can easily construct many contact 3-manifolds such that each of them has infinitely many mutually non - homeomorphic stein fillings .",
    "the first such examples were given by ozbagci - stipsicz  @xcite and smith  @xcite .",
    "our construction is as follows .",
    "consider a legendrian knot @xmath89 in @xmath90 that is smoothly isotopic to @xmath91 in the first picture of figure  [ fig3 ] .",
    "let @xmath92 be the stein 4-manifold obtained by attaching a 2-handle to @xmath10 along @xmath89 with the contact @xmath81 framing .",
    "remove the obvious @xmath70 from @xmath92 and reglue it via the diffeomorphism @xmath67 .",
    "then , the resulting stein manifold @xmath93 and @xmath92 induce the same contact structure up to isomorphism . on the other hand , we see @xmath94 .",

    "there are clearly many variations .",
    "+ @xmath96 we can construct arbitrarily many mutually non - isomorphic stein fillable contact structures on a homology 3-sphere such that each of them has infinitely many simply connected exotic stein fillings with @xmath0 .",
    "the construction is roughly as follows .",
    "change framings of the attaching circles @xmath75 of 2-handles of @xmath69 attached to @xmath70 into large negative numbers .",
    "since there are many legendrian realizations of the link @xmath75 in @xmath76 , we get finitely many non - isomorphic stein fillable contact structures on @xmath97 , which can be detected by their @xmath98 invariants . similarly to the proof in this section , we obtain infinitely many exotic stein fillings for each of these contact structures .",
