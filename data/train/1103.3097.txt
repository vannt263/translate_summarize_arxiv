    "dynamics in strong ( color ) electromagnetic fields has been an interesting subject in theoretical physics @xcite .",
    "recently , this subject is being paid attention also in high - energy heavy - ion collision experiments . at the so - called glasma stage",
    "@xcite just after the collision , longitudinal color - electric and color - magnetic fields are expected to be produced in the context of the color glass condensate of order @xmath1@xmath2gev in rhic and @xmath3gev in lhc . in the peripheral collision , a strong magnetic field of order @xmath4 mev",
    "would be also induced .",
    "such strong fields will play important role of particle productions and thermalization to the quark gluon plasma . in this paper , we concentrate on how the strong fields decay into particles . for this purpose",
    ", we consider the schwinger mechanism for quarks in the coexistence of color - electric and color - magnetic fields .",
    "we will point out that , in the case of massless quarks , the vacuum immediately decays in general homogeneous ( color ) electromagnetic fields .",
    "to simplify the situation of particle creations , we consider _ covariantly constant _ color electromagnetic fields  @xcite of @xmath5=0 $ ] , i.e. , @xmath6=[d_\\mu,\\bm{b}]=\\bm{0}$ ] , where @xmath7 is the covariant derivative with the gauge field @xmath8 .",
    "we here set @xmath9 .",
    "the color electric and magnetic fields are defined as @xmath10 and @xmath11 with @xmath12/g$ ] .",
    "this is a gauge - covariant generalization of constant fields in qed , @xmath13 , to the non - abelian fields , and the translational invariance leads to this condition . for the covariantly constant fields ,",
    "all the components of @xmath14 and @xmath15 can be diagonalized to be constant matrices in color space by a gauge transformation . without loss of generality ,",
    "one can set @xmath16 and @xmath17 in a suitable lorentz frame . here",
    ", @xmath18 and @xmath19 can be written as lorentz scalar defined by @xmath20^{1/2}$ ] @xcite with @xmath21 and @xmath22 .    like the vacuum decay in qed  @xcite",
    ", we consider the vacuum persistency probability , @xmath23 where @xmath24 and @xmath25 are infinite space volume and time length . @xmath26 and @xmath27 are the in - vacuum and the out - vacuum defined at @xmath28 and @xmath29 , respectively .",
    "@xmath0 is called `` pair - creation rate '' , and denotes magnitude of the vacuum decay per unit space - time volume .",
    "the analytic formula of @xmath0 for the quark - pair creation with the quark mass @xmath30 in the covariantly constant color fields is obtained as @xcite @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the transverse energy , @xmath33 labels the landau level , and @xmath34 denotes the spin component .",
    "the trace is taken over the indices of color and flavor .",
    "this is the non - abelian extension of the formula for qed .",
    "( on the quark mass @xmath30 , chiral symmetry is restored by strong ( color ) electric field @xcite . )",
    "the lowest landau level ( lll ) with @xmath35 and @xmath36 gives @xmath37 , which is independent of @xmath18 , while @xmath38 of higher levels includes @xmath39 term .",
    "hence , the lll state gives the dominant contribution for @xmath40 .",
    "the lll contribution for small @xmath30 is @xmath41 as @xmath42 , @xmath0 diverges as @xmath43 .",
    "note that @xmath0 diverge , only when the ( color ) magnetic field coexists , and the landau quantization causes the divergence of @xmath0  @xcite .",
    "when the ( color ) magnetic field is strong enough , the lll dominates and hence the lll projected theory is applicable , because of large @xmath44 for higher landau levels . as a remarkable merit of the lll projected theory , we can take into account the back reaction of created particle pairs . in this section",
    ", we investigate the lll projected theory in qed or abelianized qcd , since the fermion - pair creation formalism in the covariantly constant fields in qcd has abelian nature and is similar to the schwinger mechanism in qed .",
    "the wave function of the fermion is projected to the lll state , and the lll wave function in a symmetric gauge of @xmath45 is @xmath46 where @xmath47 denotes the angular momentum in @xmath48 direction for the lll , and the energy is degenerate on @xmath49 .",
    "the projected wave function can be written as @xmath50 in a suitable representation , where @xmath51 is the two component dirac field in 1 + 1 dimensions .",
    "then the fermion action of qed in @xmath52 dimensions reduces to that of non - abelian gauge theory in @xmath53 dimensions : @xmath54 where @xmath55 and @xmath56 are the gamma matrices in @xmath53 dimensions and @xmath57 .",
    "the covariant derivative is defined by @xmath58 with @xmath59 @xmath60 turns out the gauge field in @xmath61 gauge theory with @xmath62 , since @xmath60 is an hermite matrix , @xmath63 , and the indices @xmath49 and @xmath64 run from @xmath65 to @xmath66 .",
    "@xmath67 is the volume of the transverse directions .",
    "while the original gauge field lives in 3 + 1 dimensions as abelian gauge field , the gauge field in the effective fermion action is reduced to non - abelian gauge field in 1 + 1 dimensions .",
    "the gauge field can be decomposed to @xmath68 and @xmath69 parts , which are @xmath70 , and @xmath71 , respectively . for the homogeneous system on the transverse directions ,",
    "@xmath72 and @xmath73 , @xmath74 and @xmath75 can be taken to be independent of @xmath72 and @xmath73 in a gauge , so that the non - abelian part vanishes .",
    "then , the effective fermion action in eq .",
    "( [ eq : action ] ) becomes @xmath76 where @xmath51 is rewritten as @xmath77 .",
    "this action is nothing but that in 1 + 1 qed , i.e. , the schwinger model .",
    "the exact solution of the effective action for the fermion is known as     ( left ) and the number density @xmath78 of created fermions ( right ) at @xmath79 plotted against time @xmath80 .",
    "both values are normalized by that at maximum values.,title=\"fig : \" ]   ( left ) and the number density @xmath78 of created fermions ( right ) at @xmath79 plotted against time @xmath80 .",
    "both values are normalized by that at maximum values.,title=\"fig : \" ]    @xmath81    where @xmath82 denotes for longitudinal directions , @xmath80 and @xmath48 .",
    "@xmath83 is the effective photon mass , @xmath84 .",
    "equation  ( [ eq : effectiveaction ] ) is manifestly gauge invariant . in the lorenz gauge",
    ", it reduces to the result by @xcite .",
    "the mass @xmath83 is induced by the axial anomaly , whose effect is called `` dynamical higgs effect . '' from eq .",
    "( [ eq : effectiveaction ] ) , the fermion and axial currents read @xmath85 where we choose the lorenz gauge , @xmath86 .",
    "the divergence of the axial current leads to the axial anomaly in @xmath53 dimensions except for the overall factor @xmath87 : @xmath88 this relation is nothing but axial anomaly in @xmath52 dimensions . since the effective action ( [ eq : effectiveaction ] ) has a quadratic form in @xmath89 , the equation of motion for the photon can be solved .",
    "for example , the electric field of @xmath48 direction is @xmath90 , with @xmath91 .",
    "the currents satisfy @xmath92 and @xmath93 .",
    "we show in fig .",
    "[ fig : dynamics ] the electric field @xmath19 and the particle number density @xmath94 as functions of time @xmath80 , for the spatially homogeneous case , @xmath95 .",
    "the electric field oscillates with a frequency @xmath96 . in this case , @xmath97 , but @xmath98 .",
    "the number density of created fermions is @xmath99 .",
    "these results agree with the previous works  @xcite . since @xmath100 is the only scale in this theory , the time scale of the particle decay is @xmath101 .",
    "the generalization to non - abelian theories is straightforward .",
    "the fermion determinant becomes the wess - zumino - witten action .",
    "in this paper , we have studied the vacuum decay in homogeneous color electromagnetic fields . when the fermion is massless , the vacuum persistency probability per unit space - time volume becomes zero , and hence @xmath0 diverges .",
    "this divergence originates from spectral discretization of transverse directions and the lowest landau level . with the lll projection ,",
    "we have analytically calculated the effective action in this situation .",
