    "recent studies on various confined systems  @xcite have shown the possibility of obtaining many different structures and phases depending on the range of interactions and commensurability of a microscopic length scale of the system with the length scale of confinement . since internal structures often play a crucial role in determining local dynamical properties like asymmetric diffusion , viscosity etc . and phase behavior  @xcite , such studies are of considerable practical interest . charged particles interacting via a screened coulomb potential when confined in a one dimensional parabolic well showed many zero temperature layering transitions  @xcite . at high temperatures this classical wigner crystal melts and the melting temperature shows oscillations as a function of density  @xcite .",
    "such oscillations are characteristic of confined systems , arising out of commensurability . in ref .",
    "@xcite a similar layering transition is found in which the number of layers in a confined liquid with smectic modulations changes discretely as the wall - to - wall separation is increased .",
    "the force between the walls oscillates as a function of this separation depending crucially on the ratio of the separation to the thickness of the smectic layers .",
    "confined crystals always align one of the lattice planes along the direction of confinement  @xcite and confining walls generate elongational asymmetry in the local density profile along the walls even for the slightest incommensuration  @xcite . for long ranged interactions , extreme localization of wall particles",
    "has been observed  @xcite .",
    "hard spheres confined within a two dimensional slit bounded by two parallel hard plates show a rich phase behavior  @xcite . for separations of one to five hard sphere",
    "diameters a phase diagram consisting of a dazzling array of up to @xmath2 distinct crystal structures has been obtained  @xcite .",
    "similarly confined systems with more general interactions also show a similar array of phases@xcite . in an earlier experiment on confined steel balls in quasi one",
    "dimensions ( q1d ) , i.e. a two dimensional system of particles confined in a narrow channel by parallel walls ( _ lines _ ) , vibrated to simulate the effect of temperature , layering transitions , phase coexistence and melting was observed  @xcite . a recent study on trapped q1d solid in contact of its own liquid showed layering transitions with increase in trapping potential@xcite .",
    "layering fluctuations in such a solid has crucial impact on the sound and heat transport across the system@xcite .    in this paper , we show that a q1d solid strip of length @xmath3 confined within parallel , hard , one dimensional walls separated by a distance @xmath1 has rather anomalous properties .",
    "these are quite different from bulk systems in one , two or three dimensions as well as from q1d solid strips with periodic boundary conditions ( pbcs ) .",
    "we list below the main characteristics of a q1d confined strip that we demonstrate and discuss in this paper :    1 .   _",
    "re - entrant layer transitions :  _ the nature of the system in q1d depends crucially on the density @xmath0 and width of the channel @xmath1 .",
    "the number of layers of particles depends on the ratio of the interlayer spacing ( fixed mainly by @xmath0 ) and @xmath1 . with increase in channel width @xmath1 at a fixed @xmath0 we find many re - entrant discontinuous transitions involving changes in the number of layers parallel to the confining direction .",
    "the _ phase diagram _ in the @xmath4 plane is calculated from monte carlo simulations of systems with finite size as well as mean field theory ( mft ) .",
    "while all the phases show density modulations in the direction perpendicular to the wall , we identify distinct analouges of the bulk phases viz .",
    "modulated liquid , smectic , triangular solid and buckled solid .",
    "anomalous elastic moduli :  _ a solid characterized by a periodic arrangement of particles offers resistance to elongation as well as shear .",
    "the q1d confined solid is shown to have a large young s modulus which offers resistance to tensile deformations . on the other hand",
    "the shear modulus of the system is vanishingly small so that layers of the solid parallel to the confinining wall may slide past each other without resistance .",
    "reversible failure :  _ under externally imposed tensile strain the deviatoric stress shows an initial linear rise up to a limiting value which depends on @xmath1 . on further extension",
    "the stress rapidly falls to zero accompanied by a reduction in the number of solid layers parallel to the hard walls by one .",
    "however , this failure is reversible and the system _ completely recovers the initial structure once the strain is reduced _ quite unlike a similar solid strip in presence of pbcs in both the directions .",
    "the critical strain for failure by this mechanism decreases with increasing @xmath1 so that thinner strips are _ more _ resistant to failure .",
    "we show that this reversibility is related to the anomalies mentioned above .",
    "namely , the confined solid , though possessing _ local _ crystalline order , retains the ability to flow and regenerate itself . in this manner portions of the q1d",
    "confined solid behave like coalescing liquid droplets .",
    "a preliminary study of this reversible failure mechanism was reported in ref.@xcite .",
    "displacement fluctuation and solid order :  _ long wavelength displacement fluctuations in q1d are expected to destabilize crystalline order beyond a certain length scale . while we always observe this predicted growth of fuctuations , in the case of confined system , the _ amplitude _ depends crucially on the wall separation . if @xmath1 is incommensurate with the interlayer spacing , then local crystalline order is destabilized .",
    "otherwise , fluctuations are kinetically suppressed in the confined system at high densities .",
    "finite size effects also tend to saturate the growth of fluctuations .",
    "solid strips of finite length therefore exhibit apparent crystalline order at high densities both in simulations as well as in experiments@xcite .",
    "we have used an idealized model solid to illustrate these phenomena .",
    "our model solid has particles ( disks ) which interact among themselves only through excluded volume or `` hard '' repulsion .",
    "we have reasons to believe , however , that for the questions dealt with in this paper , the detailed nature of the inter particle interactions are relatively irrelevant and system behavior is largely determined by the nature of confinement and the constraints .",
    "our results may be directly verified in experiments on sterically stabilized `` hard sphere '' colloids@xcite confined in glass channels and may also be relevant for similarly confined atomic systems interacting with more complex potentials .",
    "our results should hold , at least qualitatively , for systems with fairly steep repulsive interactions@xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    ", we introduce the model confined solid and discuss the geometry and basic definitions of various structural and thermodynamic parameters .",
    "we then introduce the various possible structures with their basic characteristics in section  [ phases ] . in section  [ results ] , this will be followed by the results of computer simulations , in the constant nat ( number , area , temperature ) ensemble , exploring the deformation and failure properties of this system and the relation of the various structures described in section  [ phases ] to one another . in section  [ phase - diagram ] , we provide a finite size phase diagram obtained from simulations and compare it with an mft calculation . in section  [ conclusion ] we discuss our results with emphasis on the role of long wave length fluctuations in the destruction of crystalline order in low dimensions and conclude giving some outlook for future work .",

    "periodic boundary conditions are assumed in the @xmath25 direction(fig.[wallpic ] ) .    before we go on to describe the various phases we observe in this model system , it is instructive to consider how a triangular lattice ( the ground state configuration ) may be accomodated within a pair of straight hard walls . for the channel to accommodate @xmath26 layers of a homogeneous , triangular lattice with lattice parameter @xmath27 of hard disks of diameter @xmath11 , ( fig.[order ] )",
    "it is required that , @xmath28 for a system of constant number of particles and @xmath1 , @xmath27 is a function of packing fraction @xmath29 alone .",

    ", title=\"fig:\",width=151 ]    anticipating some of the discussion in section [ results ] , we point out two different but equivalent `` pictures '' for studying the deformation behavior of confined narrow crystalline strips . in the first picture , the stress is regarded as a function of the `` external '' strain . using the initial triangular solid ( packing fraction @xmath41 ) as reference , the external strain associated with changing @xmath3 at a constant @xmath42 and @xmath1 is @xmath43 . in this case",
    "we obtain the stress as an oscillating non - monotonic function of @xmath44 . on the other hand , internally , the solid is , free to adjust @xmath32 to decrease its energy ( strain ) .",
    "therefore , one may , equivalently , calculate strains with respect to a reference , distortion - free , triangular lattice at @xmath29 . using the definition @xmath45 and the expressions for @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath46 we obtain , @xmath47 where the number of layers @xmath32 is the nearest integer to @xmath48 so that @xmath49 has a discontinuity at half  -integral values of @xmath48 . for large @xmath1",
    "this discontinuity and @xmath49 itself vanishes as @xmath50 for all @xmath29 .",
    "this `` internal '' strain @xmath49 is related non - linearly to @xmath44 and may remain small even if @xmath44 is large .",
    "the stress is always a monotonic function of @xmath49 .",
    "note that a pair of variables @xmath29 and @xmath1 ( or alternately @xmath44 and @xmath48 ) uniquely fixes the state of the system .    .",

    "the initial condition for our simulations is the perfectly commensurate triangular lattice with a fixed number of layers @xmath32 and at a fixed packing fraction @xmath54 .",
    "after equilibration for typically about @xmath55 monte carlo steps ( mcs ) , a strain @xmath56 is imposed by rescaling @xmath3 . since the walls are kept fixed , this strain reduces @xmath54 .",
    "the sequence of phases and the nature of the transitions among them induced by this strain is discussed below .",
    "in q1d long wavelength fluctuations@xcite are expected to destroy all possible order except for those imposed by _ explicit _ ( as opposed to spontaneous ) breaking of symmetry .",
    "the confining potential , in the case of a q1d system in a hard wall channel , explicitly breaks the continuous rotational symmetry down to a @xmath57 symmetry ( rotations by angle @xmath58 ) .",
    "this immediately leads to all @xmath59-atic bond orientational orders , like nematic ( @xmath60 ) , square ( @xmath61 ) , hexatic ( @xmath62 ) etc . which remain nonzero throughout the phase diagram",
    "this situation is therefore similar to a system in a periodic laser potential@xcite .",
    "apart from orientational symmetry , the confining potential explicitly breaks translational symmetry perpendicular to the walls leading to a density modulation in that direction .",
    "any fluctuation which leads to global changes in the direction of layering or in the layer spacing for fixed wall to wall separation is strongly suppressed .",
    "for finite systems ( and over finite - but very long - times ) of confined q1d strips one obtains long - lived , metastable ordered phases which are observable even in experiments@xcite .",
    "it is these ` phases ' that we describe in this section . for convenience in nomenclature",
    ", we continue to use the terms solid , modulated liquid and smectic to denote these phases , though keeping in mind that the distinctions are largely quantitative and not qualitative . for example , a weak solid - like local hexagonal modulation is present on top of the smectic layering order in what we call the smectic phase .",
    "the smectic develops continuously and smoothly from the modulated liquid .",
    "we also denote the sharp changes in observables ( eg . strength of diffraction peaks ) as `` phase transitions '' though they can never be classified as true phase transitions in the sense of equilibrium thermodynamics .",
    "we show , however , that these phase transitions may be described within mfts ( section [ phase - diagram ] ) although they might loose meaning when fluctuations are considered in the limit of infinite observation time .    in our description of the phases we make use of the structure factor s_*g * = , where @xmath12 with @xmath63 the position vector of particle @xmath5 .",
    "we shall use particularly the values of @xmath64 for the reciprocal lattice vectors @xmath65 and @xmath66 .",
    "notice that @xmath66 and @xmath67 as shown in fig.[wallpic ] are equivalent directions .",
    "a plot of @xmath64 for @xmath68 in the two dimensional plane gives the diffraction pattern observable in scattering experiments .",
    "for every phase discussed below , the diffraction pattern _ always _ shows at least two peaks corresponding to @xmath69 since they represent the density modulation imposed by the walls .",
    "the relative strengths of these peaks , of course , depend on the structure of the phase concerned .",
    "if the separation between the hard walls is kept commensurate such that @xmath70 , an integer , at high density we obtain a perfect two dimensional _ triangular solid _ ( fig.[sld ] ) .",
    "the solid shows a diffraction pattern which is typical for a two dimensional triangular crystal .",
    "we show later that appearances can be deceptive , however .",
    "this triangular `` solid '' is shown to have zero shear modulus which would mean that it can flow without resistance along the length of the channel like a liquid . stretching the solid strip lengthwise , on the other hand , costs energy and is resisted .",
    "the strength of the diffraction peaks decreases rapidly with the order of the diffraction . in strictly two dimensions",
    "this is governed by a non - universal exponent dependent on the elastic constants @xcite . in q1d",
    "this decay should be faster .",
    "however , larger system sizes and averaging over a large number of configurations would be required to observe this decay , since constraints placed by the hard walls make the system slow to equilibrate at high densities . for a general value of @xmath48",

    "each of these regions slide along close packed planes ( corresponding to the reciprocal directions @xmath71 or @xmath72 ) with respect to one another .",
    "this produces a buckling wave with displacement in @xmath52- direction travelling along the length of the solid . in conformity with the quasi two dimensional analog @xcite we call this the _ buckled solid _ and it interpolates continuously from @xmath75 to @xmath76 layers",

    "further lower densities the relative displacement fluctuations between neighbors diverges and the diffraction pattern shows a ring- like feature typical of a liquid which appears together with the smectic like peaks in the direction perpendicular to the walls .",

    "this phase is a _ modulated liquid _ ( fig.[lqd ] ) .",
    "the density modulation decays away from the walls and for large @xmath1 , the density profile in the middle of the channel becomes uniform . a clear structural difference between smectic and modulated liquid is the presence of the ring pattern in the structure factor of the latter , a characteristic of liquid phase ( compare fig.[smec ] and [ lqd ] ) .",
    "we must emphasize here again that the distinction between a modulated liquid and a smectic is mainly a question of degree of the layering modulation .",

    "<S> we show using computer simulations and mean field theory that a system of particles in two dimensions , when confined laterally by a pair of parallel hard walls within a quasi one dimensional channel , possesses several anomalous structural and mechanical properties not observed in the bulk . depending on the density @xmath0 and the distance between the walls @xmath1 , </S>",
    "<S> the system shows structural characteristics analogous to a weakly modulated liquid , a strongly modulated smectic , a triangular solid or a buckled phase . at fixed @xmath0 , </S>",
    "<S> a change in @xmath1 leads to many reentrant discontinuous transitions involving changes in the number of layers parallel to the confining walls depending crucially on the commensurability of inter - layer spacing with @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> the solid shows resistance to elongation but not to shear . </S>",
    "<S> when strained beyond the elastic limit it fails undergoing plastic deformation but surprisingly , as the strain is reversed , the material recovers completely and returns to its original undeformed state . </S>",
