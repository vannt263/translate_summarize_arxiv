    "it is clear that modeling x - ray reflection features is a very important method in understanding the physics of accreting compact objects ; however , such fundamental measurements are only possible by comparing the observed spectra to grids of models that are computed for the appropriate radiative conditions of the system under consideration .    here , we calculate ionized x - ray reflection models appropriate for accretion powered x - ray pulsars .",
    "x - ray pulsars are a class of x - ray binaries in which the neutron star has a strong magnetic field , so that accreting matter follows the field lines and falls into the magnetic poles , generating pulses as the magnetic poles rotate in and out of our line - of - sight ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "thus , for a given spectral shape , models can be described by an ionization parameter @xmath9 hydrogen and helium are assumed to be fully ionized ( i.e. , @xmath10 ) , and the treated metals ( c , n , o , mg , si , and fe ) have the abundances of @xcite .",
    "the slab has a constant thomson depth of @xmath11 ensuring that all x - ray photons interact several times even at the largest values of @xmath12 .",

    "si  xi  xv and fe  xvi  xxvii .",
    "the continua of x - ray pulsars can be described as a hard power - law with a high - energy cutoff : @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the photon flux per energy interval , @xmath15 is the photon index , @xmath16 is the cutoff energy , and @xmath17 is the e - folding energy .",

    "similarly , the photon indices of x - ray pulsars are @xmath20 , significantly harder than the reflection models calculated for fitting agns @xcite .",
    "these very hard continua also indicate that the reflection spectra will be insensitive to the 1  ev lower limit assumed in the calculation .",

    "the features in this spectra are qualitatively very similar to those used in modeling observations of agns . however , because of the high density in neutron star disks and the very hard illuminating power - law , the @xmath35 model predicts a strong bremsstrahlung dominated soft excess at energies @xmath36  kev from the hot surface of the x - ray heated disk .",
    "the thermal bremsstrahlung continuum is modified by comptonization in the hot atmosphere so that it approximately resembles the blackbody spectrum typically used to fit the observed soft excess .",

    "details of the data reduction and spectral extraction are presented in @xcite .",
    "phase - averaged spectra were extracted in the 0.510 kev energy range for the x - ray imaging spectrometer ( xis ) ccd detector , and the 1050 kev range for the pin instrument of the hard x - ray detector ( hxd ) , and the spectra fitted jointly for each observation .",
    "@xcite found that the broad - band _ suzaku _  spectra are well described by a hard power - law with a high - energy cutoff , a soft x - ray excess , and a strong iron emission line , similar to previous studies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "as discussed in @xcite , this behavior is consistent with the origin of the soft component as the illuminated inner region of the precessing accretion disk .",

    "in addition , the broadened fe  k@xmath1  line required by @xcite can be described by a redshifted and doppler broadened ionized fe  k@xmath1  line from the same reflector .",
    "the width of the ionized fe  k@xmath1  line ( @xmath97  kev ) is less than the one determined by @xcite ( @xmath98  kev ) because the line is naturally broadened due to comptonization ( see figure  [ fig : model ] ) .",
    "the low - ionization reflector self - consistently explains the narrow o  viii  and fe  k@xmath1  lines @xcite .",
    "however , the reflection components are a small fraction of the total observed flux .",
    "the low-@xmath12 reflector contributes only @xmath99% of the total flux for each observation , indicating that this emission region subtends a consistently small solid angle as seen from the pulsar , and therefore originates from the outer disk , the accretion stream , or the companion star .",
    "in contrast , the highly ionized reflector contributes @xmath100% of the broadband flux , but this increases to @xmath101% for observation 1 . as these observations were taken at different super - orbital periods , as the inner accretion disk precess around the pulsar , then this changing fraction strongly implies that the ionized reflector arises from the inner regions of the magnetically - truncated accretion disk , consistent with the origin of the broadened fe  k@xmath1  line .",
    "moreover , the change in flux ratio indicates that our view of the inner reflecting region evolves with the super - orbital period , as expected for a warped precessing disk @xcite .",
    "the fits require an additional , broad emission component between @xmath102 and 1  kev  that does not appear in the reflection model ( the best fit without this feature results in a @xmath103 ) .",
    "this emission is well modeled by a broad gaussian component with a centroid energy of @xmath104  kev , @xmath105  kev , and ew@xmath106  ev .",
    "these properties are significantly different than the weak , narrow line that @xcite needed at a similar energy and tentatively identified as arising from highly ionized ne . in this case , a narrow emission line is strongly rejected by the fit , and thus favors an interpretation that the gaussian component is modeling a smooth part of the continuum that is missing from the highly ionized reflection spectrum .",
    "the energy and width of this feature are very similar to a gaussian bump in the _ xmm - newton _  rgs spectra of lmc  x-4  analyzed by @xcite , who modeled the soft excess using a variety of different continua and persistently observed an additional gaussian component .",
    "thus , this feature is unlikely to be an instrumental artifact , but a true unmodeled component of the continuum ( a similar feature was also found in the spectrum of her x-1 ; @xcite ) .",
    "the energy range spanned by this emission feature encompasses many transitions of fe  xvii ",
    "xxiii ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which , for this value of @xmath12 , are expected to be weak . however , there will likely be a steep ionization gradient on the surface of the inner accretion disk that is being parameterized here by only a single ionization parameter .",
    "in this scenario , a single ionized reflection spectrum may not be able to account for all the spectral complexity at @xmath107  kev , a region which is very sensitive to the ionization parameter ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . whatever the origin of this feature , it only contributes @xmath108% of the soft excess flux ( measured between @xmath109 and @xmath110  kev ) , as compared to @xmath111% produced by the ionized reflector .",
    "therefore , this unmodeled emission does not alter the conclusion that the highly ionized reflector provides a good description of the soft excess in lmc  x-4 .",
    "the redshift and doppler broadening of the ionized reflecting gas indicates that it is subject to strong dynamical effects .",
    "one possibility is relativistic smearing from motions close to the neutron star ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "however , tests with the ` rdblur ' model show that good fits can only be obtained if the inner radius of the reflector was @xmath112@xmath113  @xmath31 from the star . identifying this radius with the magnetospheric radius implies a magnetic field strength of @xmath114  g @xcite , significantly smaller than the @xmath115  g field strength required to explain the stability of the lmc  x-4  pulse period @xcite . moreover , if the disk extended down to @xmath112@xmath113  @xmath31 the accretion luminosity from the disk would overwhelm the observed spectrum unless the accretion rate was @xmath116 of the eddington rate , which is problematic given the observed luminosity of @xmath117  erg  s@xmath3 .",
    "thus , as indicated by its low covering factor , this gas must originate much farther out from the neutron star , perhaps from the inner edge of the disk as it interacts with the magnetosphere . with a magnetic field strength of @xmath115  g , the magnetospheric radius of lmc  x-4  is @xmath118  cm which would have an orbital velocity of @xmath51  km  s@xmath3 @xcite , in good agreement with both the measured redshift and the velocity width at @xmath50  kev .",
    "this conclusion is supported by the results of @xcite who uncovered evidence in high resolution gratings spectra for multiple regions of high - speed ionized gas flows .",
    "it is clear that ionized reflection spectra not only explain the soft - excess of x - ray pulsars , but allows a probe of the complicated dynamics associated with the interaction of the magnetosphere and accretion disk .",
    "this letter presents new reflection models developed for accreting x - ray pulsars .",
    "thermal bremsstrahlung subject to comptonization from an ionized x - ray heated disk is found to be a natural explanation for the soft excess observed in the spectra of lmc  x-4 , and , presumably , other x - ray pulsars which exhibit fe  k@xmath1  lines and soft excesses .",
    "fitting the _ suzaku _  data of lmc  x-4  nicely illustrates the potential of reflection modeling for elucidating the physics of these systems .",
    "we found that the observed broad fe  k@xmath1  line could be explained as originating from a redshifted ( @xmath2  km",
    "s@xmath3 ) highly ionized reflector subject to doppler broadening .",
    "these velocities are consistent with those expected from the magnetospheric radius of @xmath119  cm @xcite .",
    "thus , applying this grid of reflection models to both archival and future x - ray pulsar spectra will provide important constraints on the ionization state , metallicity and dynamics at the inner edge of magnetically - truncated accretion disks .",
