    "the description of electronic structure and properties of strongly correlated systems presents a great challenge for _ ab initio _ electronic structure calculations .",
    "the main complexity of the problem is related with the fact that such electronic systems typically bear both localized and itinerant character , where most of conventional methods do not apply .",
    "a canonical example is the local-[spin]-density approximation ( l[s]da ) in the density - functional theory ( dft).@xcite    the dft , which is a ground - state theory , is based on the minimization of the total energy functional @xmath3 $ ] with respect to the electron density @xmath4 . in the kohn - sham ( ks ) scheme , which is typically employed for practical calculations , this procedure is formulated as the self - consistent solution of single - particle ks equations @xmath5 \\right ) \\psi_i[\\rho ] = \\varepsilon_i \\psi_i[\\rho ] , \\label{eqn : ks}\\ ] ] which are combined with the equation for the electron density : @xmath6 defined in terms of eigenfunctions ( @xmath7 ) , eigenvalues ( @xmath8 ) , and the occupation numbers ( @xmath9 ) of ks quasiparticles .",
    "the lsda provides an explicit expression for @xmath10 $ ] .",
    "however , it is based on the homogeneous electron gas model , and strictly speaking applicable only for itinerant electron compounds .    the recent progress , which gave rise to such directions as lda@xmath11 hubbard @xmath0 ( refs .  ) and lda+dmft ( dynamical mean - field theory ) ( refs .",
    ") , is based on the idea of partitioning of electronic states .",
    "it implies the validity of the following postulates : + ( 1 ) all solutions of ks equations ( [ eqn : ks ] ) in lda can be divided ( by introducing proper projection - operators ) into two subgroups : @xmath12@xmath13@xmath14 , for which lsda works reasonably well , and @xmath12@xmath13@xmath15 , for which lsda encounters serious difficulties and needs to be improved ( a typical example is the @xmath1 states in transition - metal oxides and some transition metals ) .",
    "+ ( 2 ) two orthogonal subspaces , @xmath14 and @xmath15 , are `` flexible '' in the sense that they can be defined for a wider class of electron densities , which can be different from the ground - state density in lda .",
    "this allows to `` improve '' lda by adding a proper correction @xmath16 ( generally , an @xmath17-dependent self - energy ) to the ks equations , which acts solely in the @xmath15-subspace but may also affect the @xmath14-states through the change of @xmath4 associated with this @xmath16 .",
    "thus , in the ks equations , the @xmath15- and @xmath14-states remain decoupled even after including @xmath16 : @xmath18 |(-\\nabla^2$]@xmath11@xmath10$]@xmath11@xmath19 \\rangle$]@xmath20@xmath21 . for many applications ,",
    "the @xmath15-states are atomic or wannier - type orbitals . in this case",
    ", the solution of the problem in the @xmath15-space becomes equivalent to the solution of a multi - orbital hubbard - type model , and the formulation of the lda@xmath11@xmath0 approach is basically a mapping of the electronic structure in lda onto this hubbard model . in the following , by referring to the lda@xmath11@xmath0 we will mean not only the static version of this method , originally proposed in ref .  ,",
    "but also its recent extensions designed to treat dynamics of correlated electrons and employing the same idea of partitioning of the electronic states.@xcite + ( 3 ) all physical interactions , which contribute to @xmath16 , can be formally derived from lda by introducing certain constraining fields @xmath22 in the subspace of @xmath15-states of the ks equations ( i.e. , in a way similar to @xmath16 ) .",
    "the purpose of including these @xmath22 is to simulate the change of the electron density , @xmath23 , and then to extract parameters of electronic interactions from the total energy difference @xmath24@xmath11@xmath25$]@xmath26@xmath3 $ ] , by doing a mapping onto the hubbard model .",
    "the total energy difference is typically evaluated in lda,@xcite and the method itself is called the constraint - lda ( clda).@xcite    however , despite a more than decade of rather successful history , the central question of lda@xmath11@xmath0 is not completely solved and continues to be the subject of various disputes and controversies.@xcite this question is how to define the parameter of the effective coulomb interaction @xmath0 .    to begin with ,",
    "the coulomb @xmath0 is _ not _ uniquely defined quantity , as it strongly depends on the property for the description of which we want to correct our lda scheme .",
    "one possible strategy is the excited - state properties , associated with the complete removal of an electron from ( or the addition of the new electron to ) the system , i.e. the processes which are described by koopman s theorem in hartree - fock calculations and which are corrected in the gw method by taking into account the relaxation of the wavefunctions onto the created electron hole ( or a new electron).@xcite however the goal which is typically pursued in lda@xmath11@xmath0 is somewhat different .",
    "namely , one would always like to stay as close as it is possible to the description of the ground - state properties .",
    "the necessary precondition for this , which should be taken into account in the definition of the coulomb @xmath0 and all other interactions which may contribute to @xmath27 is the conservation of the total number of particles . in principle",
    ", similar strategy can be applied for the analysis of neutral excitations ( e.g. , by considering the @xmath17-dependence of @xmath27 ) , for which the total number of electrons is conserved.@xcite the basic difference between these two processes is that the `` excited '' electron in the second case continues to stay in the system and may additionally screen the coulomb @xmath0 .",
    "this screening may also affect the relaxation effects.@xcite    the purpose of this paper is to clarify several questions related with the definition of the coulomb interaction @xmath0 in transition metals .",
    "we will discuss both the momentum ( @xmath28 ) and energy ( @xmath17 ) dependence of @xmath0 , corresponding to the response of the coulomb potential onto the site ( @xmath29 ) and time ( @xmath30 ) dependent perturbation @xmath31 , and present a comparative analysis of the existing methods of calculations of this interaction , like clda and gw . we will argue that , despite a common believe , the gw method does not take into account the major effect of screening of the effective coulomb interaction @xmath0 between the @xmath1 electrons by the ( itinerant ) @xmath2 electrons , which may also contribute to the @xmath28-dependence of @xmath0 .",
    "this channel of screening is included in clda , although under an additional approximation separating the @xmath1- and @xmath2-states , while in the gw approach , its absence can be compensated by an appropriate choice of the pseudo - wannier orbitals , simulating the basis of @xmath15-states . on the other hand ,",
    "clda is a static approach , which does not take into account the @xmath17-dependence of @xmath0.@xcite we will consider mainly the ferromagnetic ( fm ) fcc ni , although similar arguments can be applied for other metallic compounds .",
    "we start with the basic definition of @xmath0 for the systems with the conserving number of particles , which was originally introduced by herring,@xcite and then discuss the connection of this definition with the parameters which comes out from clda and gw calculations .",
    "according to herring,@xcite the coulomb @xmath0 is nothing but the energy cost for moving a @xmath15-electron between two atoms , located at @xmath29 and @xmath32 , and initially populated by @xmath33@xmath20@xmath34@xmath35@xmath36 electrons :",

    "\\label{eqn : herringu1ts}\\ ] ] the final definition @xmath42 which is typically used in clda calculations , is obtained after replacing the finite difference between two ks eigenvalues in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : herringu1ts ] ) by their derivative .",
    "the derivative depends on the path in the sublattice of occupation numbers along which it is calculated ( e.g. , @xmath33@xmath11@xmath34@xmath20@xmath43 ) .",
    "this dependence has a clear physical meaning and originates from the distance - dependence of intersite coulomb interactions , which contribute to the screening of @xmath38 . in the reciprocal ( fourier ) space ,",
    "this distance - dependence gives rise to the @xmath28-dependence of @xmath0 .",
    "owing to the existence of the second subsystem , @xmath14 , the reaction ( [ eqn : herringu1 ] ) may compete with another one @xmath44 - e [ n_{l{\\bf r}},n_{i{\\bf r}},n_{l{\\bf r}'},n_{i{\\bf r } ' }   ] , \\label{eqn : herringu2}\\ ] ] corresponding to independent  charge transfer  excitations at the sites @xmath29 and @xmath32.@xcite it can be also presented in the form ( [ eqn : herringu1tsd ] ) , but with the different constraint imposed on the numbers of @xmath15- and @xmath14-electrons : @xmath33@xmath11@xmath45@xmath20@xmath43 .",
    "generally , the definitions ( [ eqn : herringu1 ] ) and ( [ eqn : herringu2 ] ) will yield two different interaction parameters . since in the charge - transfer scenario",
    "any change of @xmath33 is totally screened by the change of @xmath45 located at the same site , the interaction ( [ eqn : herringu2 ] ) does not depend on @xmath29 .    in reality , both processes coexist and the proper interaction parameter is given by the following equation @xmath46 - e [ n_{l{\\bf r}},n_{i{\\bf r}},n_{l{\\bf r}'},n_{i{\\bf r } ' }   ] , \\ ] ] where the amount of charge @xmath47 redistributed between two subsystems is determined variationally to minimize @xmath38 . in the clda scheme , it is convenient to work in the reciprocal ( fourier ) space and calculate @xmath48 as the response to the @xmath28-dependent constraining field @xmath49 acting in the subspace of @xmath15-states under the general condition of conservation of the total number of particles .",
    "the results of these calculations will strongly depend on how well @xmath15-electrons are screened by the @xmath14-ones .",
    "in the case of perfect ( 100% ) screening , the reaction ( [ eqn : herringu2 ] ) will dominate , and the parameter @xmath0 will not depend on @xmath28 .",
    "if the screening is not perfect ( e.g. , the change of the number of @xmath1 electrons in the transition metals is screened to only about 50% by the @xmath2 electrons at the same atom  ref .  ) , it is reasonable to expect strong @xmath28-dependence of the effective @xmath0 , because two different channels of screening , given by eqs .",
    "( [ eqn : herringu1 ] ) and ( [ eqn : herringu2 ] ) , will work in a different way for different @xmath28 s .",
    "since the excess ( or deficiency ) of @xmath15-electrons caused by a uniform shift of the external potential @xmath31 can be only compensated from the system of @xmath14-electrons , the  charge transfer  mechanism ( [ eqn : herringu2 ] ) will always dominate for small @xmath28 .",
    "the mechanism ( [ eqn : herringu1 ] ) becomes increasingly important near the brillouin zone ( bz ) boundary , and will generally compete with the  charge transfer  excitations ( [ eqn : herringu2 ] ) , depending on the distribution of the @xmath14-electron density .",
    "it was recently suggested by several authors ( e.g. , in refs . , and ) that the coulomb @xmath0 in the lda@xmath11@xmath0 approach can be replaced by the screened coulomb interaction @xmath50 taken from the _ ab initio _ gw method .",
    "the latter is calculated in the random phase approximation ( rpa):@xcite @xmath51^{-1 } \\hat{u}. \\label{eqn : dyson}\\ ] ] we adopt the orthogonal atomic - like basis of linear - muffin - tin orbitals ( lmto ) @xmath52,@xcite which specifies all matrix notations in eq .",

    "@xmath59 describe non - spherical interactions , responsible for hund s rule .",
    "the first advantage of rpa is that it allows to handle the @xmath17-dependence of @xmath60 , which comes from the @xmath17-dependence of the polarization matrix @xmath61 .",
    "the most common approximation for @xmath61 , which is feasible for _ ab initio _ gw calculations , is that of non - interacting quasiparticles:@xcite @xmath62 which is typically evaluated starting with the electronic structure in lsda ( the spin indices are already included in the definition of @xmath12 and @xmath63 ) . generally speaking",
    ", the use of @xmath64 is an additional approximation , which yields a new interaction @xmath65 . at this stage , it is not clear whether it has the same meaning as the effective @xmath0 derived from clda and whether eq .",
    "( [ eqn : polarization ] ) includes all necessary channels of screening .",
    "it may also include some other effects , which should be excluded from the final definition of @xmath0 , in order to avoid the double - counting .",
    "one is the self - screening arising from local ( on - site ) interactions between the localized electrons .",
    "these interactions are not accurately treated in rpa.@xcite therefore , the basic idea is to exclude these effects from the definition of @xmath65 and to resort this part to the interaction term of the hubbard model.@xcite in this respect , the second important property of rpa is that it allows to easily partition different contribution to @xmath61 and @xmath60 . if @xmath61@xmath20@xmath66@xmath11@xmath67 and @xmath68 is the solution of eq .",
    "( [ eqn : dyson ] ) for @xmath61@xmath20@xmath66 , the total @xmath60 can be obtained from the same equation after substitution @xmath61@xmath69@xmath67 and @xmath70@xmath69@xmath68 in eq .",

    "there are three major problems:@xcite ( i ) the bandwidth is too large ( overestimated by @xmath7430% ) ; ( ii ) the exchange splitting is too large ( overestimated by @xmath7450% ) ; ( ii ) the absence of the 6 ev satellite",
    ". the _ ab initio _",
    "gw approach corrects only the bandwidth ( although with certain tendency to overcorrect ) , whereas the other two problems remain even in gw.@xcite therefore , before doing any extensions on the basis of gw method , it is very important to have a clear idea about its limitations . in this section",
    "we would like to clarify several confusing statements about screening of @xmath50 in gw .",
    "we argue that the main results of the _ ab initio _ gw method can be explained , even quantitatively , by retaining , instead of the full matrix @xmath70 in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : dyson ] ) , only the site - diagonal block @xmath75 of bare coulomb interactions between @xmath1 electrons , in the atomic - like lmto basis set .",
    "an intuitive reason behind this observation is the form of polarization matrix ( [ eqn : polarization ] ) , which can interact only with exchange matrix elements .",
    "the latter are small unless they are calculated between orbitals of the same type , corresponding to the self - interaction .",
    "the values of radial slater s integrals calculated in the basis of atomic @xmath1 orbitals are @xmath57@xmath20@xmath76 , @xmath58@xmath20@xmath77 , and @xmath59@xmath20@xmath78 ev , respectively .",
    "all other interactions are considerably smaller .",

    "( [ eqn : dyson ] ) only those matrix elements which are projected onto the atomic @xmath1 orbitals , in the lmto representation . in this sense",

    "note , however , that the lmto basis in the transition metals is generally different from the wannier basis , which should be used for the construction the hubbard hamiltonian . as it will become clear in sec .",

    "@xmath17 , the behavior of @xmath83 is well consistent with the strong coupling regime @xmath57@xmath69@xmath79 : namely , @xmath83@xmath74@xmath26@xmath84 , which is small ( @xmath741.8 ev at @xmath17@xmath20@xmath21 ) and _ does not depend on _ @xmath57 ( though it may depend on @xmath58 and @xmath59 ) .",
    "all these features are in a good semi - quantitative agreement with results of gw calculations.@xcite    the self - energy in gw is given by the convolution of @xmath60 with the one - particle green function @xmath85 : @xmath86 therefore , the @xmath17-dependence of @xmath87 should incorporate the main features of @xmath88 .",
    "indeed , the low - energy part of @xmath87 ( close to the fermi energy or the chemical potential @xmath89 ) is mainly controlled by @xmath90 .",
    "since the main poles of @xmath90 and @xmath91 are well separated on the @xmath17-axis ( the @xmath17-range of @xmath91 is limited by the @xmath1 bandwidth , @xmath744.5 ev in lsda for fcc ni , whereas the  plasmon peak  of @xmath92 is located only at @xmath7422 ev ) , one has the following relation : @xmath93 this yields the renormalization factor @xmath94@xmath20@xmath95@xmath26@xmath96^{-1}$]@xmath74@xmath97 , which readily explains the reduction of the @xmath1 bandwidth as well as of the intensity of the valence spectrum in _ ab initio _ gw calculations ( fig .",
    "[ fig.dos]).@xcite    away from the fermi energy ( i.e. , for energies @xmath98 which are much larger than the @xmath1 bandwidth ) , one has another relation @xmath99@xmath74@xmath26@xmath100 , which readily explains the existence of the deep minimum of @xmath99 near @xmath26@xmath101 ev as well as large transfer of the spectral weight into this region ( shown in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig.dos ] ) .",
    "therefore , it is not quite right to say that the satellite structure is missing in the _ ab initio _",
    "gw approach .",
    "it may exist , but only in the wrong region of @xmath17 .",
    "thus , even besides rpa , the major problem of the gw description for the transition metals is the _",
    "wrong energy scale , which is controlled by the bare on - site coulomb interaction _ @xmath57 ( @xmath74@xmath102-@xmath101 ev ) between the @xmath1 electrons . in summarizing this section",
    "we would like to stress again the following points : + ( 1 ) the major channel of screening of coulomb interaction in the gw method for the transition metals originates from the @xmath1@xmath69@xmath1 transitions in the polarization function calculated in the atomic - like lmto basis set .",
    "the screening by the @xmath2-electrons is practically absent ; + ( 2 ) at small @xmath17 , the deficiency of the @xmath1-@xmath2 screening is masked by the strong - coupling regime realized in rpa equations for screened coulomb interaction , which explains a small value of @xmath103 obtained in the gw calculations ; + ( 3 ) the main @xmath17-dependence of @xmath87 and @xmath60 in gw also comes from the @xmath1@xmath69@xmath1 transitions .",
    "different conclusions obtained in refs .   are related with the use of different partitioning into what is called the `` @xmath1 '' and `` non-@xmath1 '' ( pseudo- ) wannier orbitals.@xcite in the light of analysis presented in this section , the strong @xmath17-dependent screening by the `` non-@xmath1 '' wannier states obtained in refs .",

    "therefore , the effects of the charge redistribution can be taken into account by including the intra- as well as inter - site coulomb interactions in the hubbard hamiltonian .",
    "the latter can be evaluated in the gw approach , provided that the relaxation effect are not very sensitive to whether the excited electron is placed on another @xmath15-orbital of the same system , or completely removed from it , like in the gw method .",
    "the model employed in clda calculations is obtained after neglecting the hybridization between @xmath1- and @xmath2-states ( the so - called canonical - bands approximation  ref .  ) .",
    "it consists of the pure @xmath1-band , located near the fermi level and representing the @xmath15-states of the model , which is embedded into the free - electron - like @xmath2-band , representing the @xmath14-states.@xcite formally , these bands are decoupled and the free - electron - line @xmath2-band can be eliminated from the basis in the process of construction of the hubbard hamiltonian . however , in this case the definition of the screened coulomb interaction in the @xmath1 band should take into account the processes corresponding to redistribution of electrons between @xmath1- and @xmath2-band at the low - energy cost , which is traced back to herring s scenario of screening in the transition metals,@xcite and which is missing in the gw method .",
    "however , we would like to emphasize again that both considered models are _ approximations _ to the real electronic structure of fcc ni .",
    "even in the first case ( model ` a ' in fig .  [ fig.bands ] ) , the free - electron - like @xmath2-band lies near the fermi level ( especially around l - point of the brillouin zone ) . therefore , the charge redistribution effects are expected to play some role even in the basis of wannier orbitals . on the other hand , because of strong hybridization between @xmath1- and @xmath2-states in the transition metals , there is a substantial difference of electronic structure used in clda calculations ( model ` b ' in fig .",
    "[ fig.bands ] ) from the real lda electronic structure of fcc ni .",
    "strictly speaking , all partial contributions to the screening of coulomb interactions , which we will consider in the next section , will be evaluated for this particular model of the electronic structure .",
    "the values of these parameters can be revised to a certain extent after taking into account the hybridization between @xmath1- and @xmath2-states .",
    "for example , with the better choice of the wannier basis for the five @xmath1-electron - line bands in the model ` b ' one could possibly incorporate the main effects of the model ` a ' and merge these two approaches .",
    "how important are the relaxation of the wavefunctions and the change of the occupation numbers in the definition of the coulomb interaction @xmath0 ? for the transition metals , both contributions can be easily evaluated in clda . for these purposes",
    "it is convenient to use the hellman - feinman theorem , which relates the static @xmath0 with the expectation value of the ks potential @xmath138@xmath20@xmath139@xmath11@xmath140 :  @xcite @xmath141 then , the exchange - correlation ( xc ) part is small .",
    "@xmath142 can be expressed through @xmath143 .",
    "hence , the clda scheme provides the self - consistent solution for @xmath143 associated with the change of the number of @xmath1 electrons , @xmath144 .",
    "the latter is controlled by @xmath131 .",
    "therefore , the procedure is totally equivalent to the calculation of the polarization function @xmath125 and the screened coulomb interaction for @xmath17@xmath20@xmath21 .",
    "we use rather standard set up for the clda calculations .",
    "namely , the @xmath1 band of ni should be well separated from the rest of the spectrum ( otherwise , the lda@xmath11@xmath0 strategy discussed in the introduction does not apply ) .",
    "for fcc ni this is not the case .",
    "however , this property can be enforced by using the canonical bands approximation in the lmto method.@xcite we employ even cruder approximation and replace the @xmath1 band by the atomic @xmath1 levels embedded into the @xmath2 band ( in the other words , we switch off the hybridization between @xmath1 orbitals located at different atomic sites as well as the @xmath1 and @xmath2 states).@xcite then , each @xmath1 orbital can be assigned to a single atomic site . by changing the number of @xmath1-electrons at different atomic sites @xmath145 in supercell calculations , one can mimic the @xmath28-dependence of the external potential ( [ eqn : dvext ] ) .",
    "other atomic population ( of the @xmath2 states ) are allowed to relax self - consistently onto each change of the number of @xmath1 electrons .",
    "hence , the contribution of the charge - transfer excitation ( [ eqn : herringu2 ] ) to the screening of @xmath0 is unambiguously defined by the form of the external potential and details of the electronic structure of the @xmath2 states .",
    "some aspects of treating the @xmath1 states beyond the atomic approximation will be considered in sec .",
    "[ sec : oq ] .    the lmto method is supplemented with an additional spherical approximation for @xmath146 inside atomic spheres , which bars small exchange interactions between @xmath1 and @xmath2 electrons from the screening of @xmath0 . by paraphrasing this statement in terms of the polarization function in the gw method ,",
    "the spherical approximation for @xmath146 in the clda calculations is equivalent to retaining in @xmath133 only those contributions which are associated with transitions between states with the same angular momentum ( e.g. , @xmath1@xmath69@xmath113 , etc . ) .",
    "first , we evaluate the pure effect associated with the change of the occupation numbers , without relaxation of the wavefunctions .",
    "this mechanism is directly related with the conservation of the total number of particles , and simply means that the excess ( or deficiency ) of the @xmath1 electrons for @xmath28@xmath20@xmath21 is always compensated by the @xmath2 electrons , which participate in the screening of @xmath1 interactions .",
    "the corresponding contribution to the screening of @xmath57 is given by:@xcite @xmath148    in transition metals , @xmath149 is very large and takes into account more than 70% of screening of the bare coulomb interaction @xmath57 ( table  [ tab : u ] ) .",

    "it change the asymptotic behavior @xmath156 as well as the position and the intensity of the `` plasmon peak '' of @xmath157 , which is shifted to the lower - energies region and becomes substantially broader in comparison with the case of bare coulomb interactions considered in sec .",

    "the main effect of the @xmath2-screening onto the spectral function in rpa consists in somewhat milder reduction of the bandwidth , which is also related with the spectral weight transfer ( fig .",
    "[ fig.dos ] ) : the new renormalization factor is @xmath94@xmath74@xmath162 against @xmath94@xmath74@xmath97 obtained with bare coulomb interactions .",
    "however , the exchange splitting does not change and the 6 ev satellite structure does not emerge .",
    "we have considered several mechanisms of screening of the bare coulomb interactions between @xmath1 electrons in transition metals .",
    "we have also discussed different methods of calculations of the screened coulomb interactions .",
    "our main results can be summarized as follows .",
    "+ ( 1 ) the processes which mainly contribute to the screening of coulomb interactions between @xmath1 electrons are essentially local , meaning that the on - site coulomb interactions are most efficiently screened by the @xmath1 and @xmath2 electrons located at the same site.@xcite the most efficient mechanism of screening is basically the self - screening by the same @xmath1 electrons , evaluated in some appropriate atomic - like basis set , like that of the lmto method employed in the present work .",
    "the @xmath17-dependence of the effective coulomb interaction @xmath0 also originates mainly from the self - screening .",
    "+ ( 2 ) we have clarified a fundamental difference between constraint - lda and gw methods in calculating the effective coulomb interaction @xmath0 .",
    "the gw approximation does not take into account a screening of the on - site coulomb interactions by the itinerant @xmath2 electrons , taking place via redistribution of electrons between @xmath1 and @xmath2 bands .    in a number of cases ,",
    "the gw approach may be justified by using wannier basis functions , representing the bands near the fermi level .",
    "if these bands are well isolated from the other bands , the redistribution of electrons between wannier orbitals for the bands near the fermi level and those far from the fermi level must be negligible .",
    "then , the remote bands can participate in the screening of coulomb interactions in the `` near - fermi - level bands '' only via virtual excitations , which can be treated on the rpa level .",
    "however , in the case of ni , such separation of bands is not complete , and it is essential to consider additional mechanisms of screening beyond the gw approximation . in the present work , the @xmath2-screening is automatically taken into account in the clda approach , which is complementary to the gw method . due to the strong - coupling regime",
    "realized in rpa equations for the screened coulomb interaction , the static limit appears to be insensitive to the details of the @xmath2-screening .",
    "however , from the viewpoint of the present approach , the @xmath2-screening becomes increasingly important at finite @xmath17 and controls both the asymptotic behavior and the position of the plasmon peak of the screened coulomb interaction in rpa .",
    "the latter effect can be especially important as it predetermines the position of the satellite structure .",
    "finally , we would like to make several comments about implication of the parameters of screened coulomb interaction obtained in our work for the description of electronic structure and properties of transition metals . we will also discuss some future directions and make a comparison with already existing works .",
    "+ ( 1 ) our results clearly show that rpa is not an adequate approximation for the electronic structure of fcc ni . even after taking into account the additional screening of the @xmath1-@xmath1 interactions by the itinerant @xmath2 electrons , beyond the gw approximation , and the @xmath28-dependence of the effective @xmath0",
    ", we obtain only a partial agreement with the experimental data .",
    "namely , only the bandwidth is corrected in this `` renormalized gw approach '' , in a better agreement with the experimental data .",
    "however , there is only a tiny change of the spectral weight around 6 ev ( fig .",
    "[ fig.dos ] ) , i.e. in the region where the satellite structure is expected experimentally . even assuming that our parameters of coulomb interactions may be still overestimated ( due to the reasons which will be discussed below ) , and the satellite peak can emerge for some smaller values of @xmath0,@xcite one",
    "can hardly expect the strong spin - dependence of this satellite structure as well as the reduction of the exchange splitting , which are clearly seen in the experiment,@xcite on the level of rpa calculations .",
    "therefore , it is essential to go beyond .",
    "+ ( 2 ) even beyond lda , do the parameters of screened coulomb interaction @xmath0@xmath745.0 - 7.3 ev , obtained in the atomic approximation , provide a coherent description for the electronic structure and properties of fcc ni ? probably , this is still an open question because so far not all of the possibilities in this direction have been fully investigated .",
    "one new aspect suggested by our calculations is the @xmath28-dependence of the effective @xmath0 . on the other hand ,",
    "all previous calculations suggest that the coulomb interaction of the order of 5.0 - 7.3 ev is probably too large .",
    "for example , the value of @xmath0 , which provide a coherent description for a number of electronic and magnetic properties of fcc ni on the level of dmft calculations is about 3 ev,@xcite which is well consistent with the previous estimates based on the @xmath30-matrix approach.@xcite therefore , it is reasonable to ask if there is an additional mechanism , which further reduces the effective @xmath0 from 5.0 - 7.3 ev till 3.0 ev ?",
    "one possibility lies in the atomic approximation which neglects the hybridization effects between @xmath1 and @xmath2 states , and which is rather crude approximation for the transition metals.@xcite the hybridization will generally mix the states of the @xmath1 and @xmath2 character , and therefore will affect the form of the wannier orbitals constructed from the atomic wavefunctions . since the @xmath1 , @xmath163 , and @xmath164 states belong to different representations of point group of the cubic symmetry , they can not mix at the same site . however , the @xmath163 ( or @xmath164 ) orbital can have tails of the @xmath1 character at the neighboring sites ( and vice versa ) .",
    "these tails will additionally screen the coulomb interactions between the ( nominally ) @xmath1 electrons .",
    "the screening is expected to be very efficient because it operates between orbitals of the same ( @xmath1 ) type .",
    "it should explain further reduction of the static @xmath0 obtained in the atomic approximation .",
    "another feature of this screening is the @xmath17-dependence of the effective @xmath0 , which comes from the @xmath1@xmath69@xmath1 transitions in the polarization function ( namely between tails of the @xmath2-orbitals and the heads of the wavefunctions of the @xmath1 character ) . in rpa , this @xmath17-dependence is directly related with the static limit of screening via the kramers - kronig transformation.@xcite we believe that the screening by the tails of the wannier functions was the main physical mechanism underlying the calculations of effective coulomb interaction in refs .",
    ", in the framework of _ ab initio _ gw method , although this idea has not been clearly spelled out before .",
    "the effect of charge redistribution between different states located near the fermi level , which is not taken into account in the gw approximation , is also expected to be smaller with the proper choice of the wannier orbitals .",
    "another problem is that the @xmath1 and @xmath2 bands are strongly mixed in the case of pure transition metals .",
    "therefore , the construction of the separate wannier functions of the `` @xmath1 '' and `` non-@xmath1 '' type will always suffer from some ambiguities.@xcite in this sense , the transition - metal oxides , whose physical properties are mainly predetermined by the behavior of a limited number of @xmath1 bands , located near the fermi level and well separated from the rest of the spectrum , are much more interesting systems for the exploration of the idea of screening of coulomb interactions , formulated on the wannier basis .",
    "for example , based on the above argument , one can expect a very efficient screening of coulomb interactions in the @xmath1 band by the wannier states constructed from the oxygen @xmath165 orbitals , which have appreciable tails of the @xmath1 character at the transition - metal sites . the first attempt to consider this screening",
    "have been undertaken in ref .",
    ", on the basis of constraint - lda method .",
    "similar scheme can be formulated within rpa , which takes into account the @xmath17-dependence of the screened coulomb interaction @xmath0 .",

    "this probably explains why for many compounds lsda provides a reasonable estimate for the parameter @xmath0 ( though there is no solid justification why this is so ) .                                            the scheme proposed by kotani ( ref .  )",
    "was based on a special construction of the lmto basis set.@xcite in the process of calculations of the screened coulomb interaction @xmath73 , he excluded only the `` heads '' of the lmto @xmath1-basis functions , @xmath166 ( solutions of ks equations inside atomic spheres for a given energy @xmath167 ) , whereas the `` tails '' of the wavefunctions of the same @xmath1 character , given by the energy derivatives @xmath168 of @xmath166 , were allowed to screen @xmath73 .",
    "the idea was probably to go beyond the atomic approximation for the @xmath1 states and to mimic the behavior of the wannier functions .",
    "however , this procedure depends on the choice of @xmath169 and the lmto representation.@xcite for example in the ( most suitable for the construction of the hubbard model ) orthogonal representation , both @xmath166 and @xmath168 can contribute to the `` heads '' of the basis functions as well as their `` tails '' . on the other hand , aryasetiawan and co - workers in ref .   used the band picture and considered the screening of the `` @xmath1 '' band by the `` non-@xmath1 '' ( mainly @xmath2 ) ones .",
    "in reality , however , the @xmath2 band can carry a considerable weight of atomic @xmath1 states , due to the hybridization .",

    "since the energy distance between the @xmath1 and @xmath113 ( and higher ) bands is much larger than the @xmath1 bandwidth , one can neglect the dispersion of the @xmath1 bands and relate @xmath172@xmath69@xmath173 with the local density of @xmath104 states .",
