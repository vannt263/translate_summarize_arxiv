    "the high energy limit of qcd is one of the most important aspects of strong interactions .",
    "the abundance of precision data from high - energy colliders , like hera and tevatron , enables one to confront and check the theoretical predictions in qcd .",
    "the standard framework used to make the predictions in qcd is that of the collinear factorization . in this approach the hard matrix element",
    "is computed within the perturbative qcd .",
    "the collinear singularities are factorized into the parton densities which are then evolved using the renormalization group equations .",
    "these equations provide a tool for computing the change of the densities of quarks and gluons at the variable scale .",
    "although the parton distribution evolves , the total energy - momentum is conserved .",
    "this is reflected by the fact that the anomalous dimensions of the dglap equations vanish at @xmath1 @xmath2 and @xmath3 order by order in the perturbation theory .",
    "therefore parton distributions @xmath4 obey the momentum sum rule @xmath5 where @xmath0 is the fraction of the longitudinal momentum of the hadron carried by the parton , and @xmath6 is the scale of the dglap equation . in the distribution @xmath7 partons",
    "are _ on - shell _ and have zero transverse momentum .",
    "this by itself is already an approximation , since one does not observe free , on - shell quarks and in any hadronic process the target partons are always off - shell .",
    "an alternative approach is bfkl resummation @xcite , where gluon emission diagrams are summed in the regge limit @xmath8 .",
    "the amplitude computed perturbatively in this regime has the form @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the pomeron trajectory given by the integro - differential equation @xmath11  in ( [ eq : bfkl0 ] ) @xmath12 is the bfkl kernel which depends on the transverse momenta @xmath13 . in the leading logarithmic approximation",
    "the pomeron trajectory intercept equals @xmath14  the solution to eq .",

    "the distribution @xmath16 is for the _ off - shell _ gluons .",
    "the next - to - leading order corrections @xcite dominate the leading order .",
    "consequently , several methods on the resummation of the perturbative series were developed , to name @xcite-@xcite , @xcite-@xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "there is , as yet unfortunately , no unique resummation procedure at small @xmath0 .",
    "however , the major building blocks are common to all approaches , like the dglap anomalous dimension , kinematical constraints , running coupling and the momentum sum rule .",
    "the unique sum of the perturbation theory , if it exists , should contain the complete information about the anomalous dimensions .",
    "it is then legitimate to ask what is the strong coupling limit of such a sum .",
    "while one does not yet have a complete solution , one can still build models and explore them in the strong coupling limit . in @xcite a resummation procedure was proposed and it revealed that the intercept in the limit of the infinite coupling equals one . in this paper we investigate the details of the behavior of the bfkl eigenvalue restricted by the kinematical constraint and the momentum sum rule .",
    "we show that in the limit @xmath17 the intercept of the resummed pomeron becomes exactly one .",
    "this is consistent with the exchange of the ( possibly massless ) particle of spin two .",
    "the model proposed here explains the strong coupling limit but also allows to interpolate between small and large values of @xmath18 .",

    "our results may bear some relevance in the context of the string / gauge duality conjecture proposed by maldacena @xcite .",
    "recent string theory results @xcite ( see also @xcite ) showed that the scattering amplitudes in the regge regime at large n and for the vanishing beta function exhibit a diffusion in the fifth dimension of the curved @xmath19 space .",

    "therefore the diffusion properties of the bfkl pomeron are universal at all values of the strong coupling . we show that the resummed eigenvalue is consistent with the results of @xcite .",
