    "<S> inherently , the @xmath61-type topological charge @xmath62 also implies the wzw - term to be at level @xmath60 in the nl@xmath6 m . </S>",
    "<S> since this wzw - term has a topological character with a non - perturbative discrete coupling constant , gapless chiral modes have a topologically protected finite conductance , free from the anderson localization  @xcite . as the counterpart of the above results for nl@xmath6 m </S>",
    "<S> , the bbc can also be used to deduce the chern character ( cc ) term in the gauge response of @xmath2d chiral fermions from the chern - simons(cs ) term of the gauge response of @xmath1d tis , since the cs term is not gauge invariant on a manifold with boundary , leading to the boundary cc terms .    _ the coupling of disordered weyl fermions with a gauge field _ </S>",
    "<S> if @xmath63 , @xmath64 just corresponds to chiral fermions under disorders . according to the boundary - bulk correspondence , the nl@xmath6 m for a model @xmath65 with only one gapless point contains a wzw - term , @xmath66=\\frac{im}{128\\pi}\\int d\\tau d^{3}x\\;\\epsilon^{\\mu\\nu\\rho\\lambda}\\mathrm{tr}\\tilde{q}\\partial_{\\mu}\\tilde{q}\\partial_{\\nu}\\tilde{q}\\partial_{\\rho}\\tilde{q}\\partial_{\\lambda}\\tilde{q},\\ ] ] where @xmath67 is the topological charge of the gapless modes in the model , raising from @xmath68=\\int d^{3}x\\;\\chi^{\\dagger}\\left(\\omega-\\mathcal{h}+i\\eta\\tau_{3}^{ra}-v(\\mathbf{r})\\right)\\chi .\\ ] ] in the present case , @xmath69 correspond to the left and right - handed fermions , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> so it is clear that the wzw - terms are cancelled if ever @xmath63 , leading to vanishing topological terms and corresponding to a dirac hamiltonian under disorders . </S>",
    "<S> when @xmath7 is nonzero , we can regard it as a chiral gauge field coupling oppositely to the left- and right - handed fermions . </S>",
    "<S> let us consider @xmath70 coupled with a @xmath11 gauge field @xmath71 under disorders , noting that @xmath72 can be treated similarly . </S>",
    "<S> after application of the replica method , the lagrangian reads @xmath73 it is found that the @xmath11 gauge transformation can be made for each component of @xmath43 independently , namely the action is invariant under the transformation , @xmath74 and @xmath75 with the superscript ` @xmath76 ' being the index of the retarded - advanced space . accordingly in the non - linear sigma version , @xmath77 transforms under the gauge transformation as @xmath78 in the absence of gauge field , the nl@xmath6 </S>",
    "<S> m is @xmath79=\\frac{1}{\\lambda_+}\\int d^{3}x\\:\\mathrm{tr}(\\partial_{j}q\\partial_{j}q)+\\gamma_{+}[q],\\ ] ] where @xmath80 determined by the microscopic details of the weyl point is proportional to the longitudinal conductivity . </S>",
    "<S> our strategy is to find the minimal coupling of the nl@xmath6 m with the @xmath11 gauge field , which is invariant under the above gauge transformation . to simplify our calculation but without loss of generality </S>",
    "<S> , we consider a specific gauge transformation as @xmath81 and @xmath82 which are the opposite constants in advanced and retarded spaces , respectively . following a seminar work on current algebra of witten  @xcite </S>",
    "<S> , we highlight our derivations below . </S>",
    "<S> the infinitesimal variation of @xmath17 is @xmath83.\\ ] ] @xmath84 operates on retarded and advanced spaces , and hereafter we drop the superscript for simplicity . since the minimal coupling for the ordinary term is readily obtained by the substitution , @xmath85 $ ] , we thus focus only on the wzw - term . </S>",
    "<S> the variation of @xmath86 under the infinitesimal local gauge transformation is @xmath87 where the exterior derivative and wedge product have been used for brevity . </S>",
    "<S> thus we have @xmath88 we may expect that the coupling takes the form @xmath89 . however , since the current @xmath90 is not gauge invariant , additional terms are needed to cancel its variation under gauge transformation , which turns out to be @xmath91 . as a result , </S>",
    "<S> the total gauge invariant action for the @xmath92 case is given by @xmath93 _ opposite coupling _ we are now ready to obtain the nl@xmath6 m of the wsm . </S>",
    "<S> in the wsm @xmath94(@xmath95 ) is coupled with @xmath96(@xmath97 ) . </S>",
    "<S> thus from eqs.([sumrule ] ) and ( [ em ] ) , it is found that @xmath46=\\frac{1}{\\lambda}\\int d^{3}x\\:\\mathrm{tr}(\\partial_{j}q\\partial_{j}q)+s_{a\\theta}[q ] , \\label{seff}\\ ] ] where @xmath98 , recalling that @xmath99 , as our most main result , is given by eq.([atheta ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> also note that the first term in eq.([seff ] ) is actually a normal action that accounts for usual non - topological properties .    </S>",
    "<S> a physical meaning of the anisotropic @xmath0-term becomes clear if @xmath7 is constant . </S>",
    "<S> intuitively , a 2d slice at any @xmath100 along @xmath7 direction may be viewed as a 2d ti with unit chern number , which is accompanied with the bulk transverse conductivity and the edge chiral gapless modes ( see the latter discussion around eq.([2dtheta ] ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> it is interesting to note that the transverse conductivity in the plane perpendicular to @xmath7 is proportional to the magnitude of @xmath7 , being completely independent of the disorder strength @xmath101 . </S>",
    "<S> the anisotropic form in the bulk is also consistent with the edge currents traveling perpendicular to @xmath7 , enabling them to have topological protection similar to that of the wzw - term . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> it is seen from the derivation that the wzw - terms of two weyl points are cancelled , which relies only on the fact that the two weyl points have opposite topological charges , independent of their positions in the @xmath9-space . </S>",
    "<S> when the wzw - term is absent after the opposite coupling , its corresponding topological protection is lost , consistent with the fact that disorders may mix the two weyl points leading to localization@xcite . however , remarkabally , the new nontrivial anisotropic @xmath0-term emerges , such that it embodies the remaining anisotropic topological protection originated from topological charges after the global cancellation , analogous to the net electric field generated from an electric dipole .    </S>",
    "<S> at this stage , we elaborate how to derive the a - cs term in fig.([diagram ] ) ( see supplemental material for details  @xcite ) , from a trick of opposite coupling . treating @xmath7 as a gauge field coupling oppositely to the two weyl points </S>",
    "<S> , the corresponding lagrangian reads @xmath102 , where @xmath7 is promoted to be a space - time vector @xmath103 with @xmath104 corresponding to deviation in energy , and notations about dirac matrices are consistent with those in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> there are two types of vertexes , @xmath105 and @xmath106 . </S>",
    "<S> the a - cs term is given by the three - vertex diagrams with two s and one , shown in fig.([feynman ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> as the @xmath11 gauge symmetry is fundamental , we adopt the dimensional regularization scheme for the internal momentum @xmath107 in the loop . </S>",
    "<S> accordingly @xmath107 is decomposed as @xmath108 . in the above notations </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath109 is still in the four - dimensional spacetime , but @xmath110 is in the extended infinitesimal dimensions , anti - commuting with @xmath111 and commuting with @xmath112  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the three diagrams contribute equally , and after a dramatic cancellation only a finite term is left similar to the derivation of the axial anomaly  @xcite , leading to the anisotropic cs term , @xmath113    ]    _ dimension reduction _ the last arrow process to be established is the dimension reduction from @xmath2d csm to @xmath3d ti in class a. first it is observed that if @xmath7 is a constant vector in the model ( [ model ] ) , along the direction of @xmath7 , we may regard the 3d system as a collection of 2d systems perpendicular to @xmath7 in @xmath9 space , and thus the 2d systems gapped over @xmath100 are 2d tis with unit chern number and the others outside this range are trivial , except at the two gapless points . setting @xmath114 constant and all fields independent of @xmath115 in eqs.([atheta ] ) and ( [ acs ] ) , the dimension reduction gives @xmath116 and @xmath117 since @xmath118 correspond to a collection of unit topological insulators ( chern insulators ) , divided by the dimension constant @xmath119 , the above equations give the well - known @xmath0-term and cs term for 2d tis , @xmath120 since the above treatment is applicable for any integer @xmath121 , the dimension reduction(dr ) from @xmath2d csm to @xmath3d ti in fig.([diagram ] ) has been completed . </S>",
    "<S> the dimension reduction actually illustrates the correspondence between the anisotropic @xmath0-term of eq.([atheta ] ) , and the anisotropic cs term of eq.([acs ] ) , recalling that the cs term for 2d ti indicates the transverse conductivity and the @xmath0-term implies the stability of this transverse transportation under disorders .    </S>",
    "<S> _ remark _ we now make comments about the essence of emergent topological terms . in quantum field theory , this emergence is usually related to some quantum anomaly , where two regularization schemes with different symmetries are contradictory  @xcite . from a viewpoint of band theory , these contradictions are usually originated from nontrivial topological configurations of the berry fiber bundle . the coupling constant of a topological term can formally be expressed as a topological invariant of the berry fiber bundle , which affects directly the transport properties  @xcite , and thus its nontrivial topological configurations may account for anomalous transport in quantum anomalies .    </S>",
