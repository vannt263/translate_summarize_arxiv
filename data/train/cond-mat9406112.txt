    "the understanding of binary and ternary amphiphilic systems has made considerable progress over the last few years @xcite .",
    "one of the phases which has received particular attention is the microemulsion , a homogeneous , isotropic mixture of oil , water and amphiphile .",
    "it is by now well established that the microemulsion consists of homogeneous regions of oil and water , which form a complicated , intertwined network , with a typical length scale of a few hundred  .",
    "this is possible because the amphiphile forms a monolayer at the interface between these oil- and water - regions and thereby reduces the interfacial tension , so that a phase with an extensive amount of internal interface can become stable .",
    "the structure of the sponge phase in aqueous surfactant solutions is very similar @xcite . in this case",
    "an amphiphilic bilayer separates two multiply connected water networks .    in order to characterize the internal structure of a microemulsion ,",
    "several quantities have been proposed .",
    "most experiments and theoretical studies have concentrated on the water - water correlation function , or equivalently the scattering intensity in bulk contrast @xcite . however",
    ", a two - point correlation function gives little information about the connectivity and percolation of the oil- and water - networks in a microemulsion .",
    "the latter property can be probed by conductivity and diffusion experiments . from a theoretical point of view",
    ", the topology of a microemulsion can be characterized by its euler characteristic @xcite , a quantity which unfortunately is difficult to measure experimentally @xcite .",
    "we want to investigate here a simple ginzburg - landau model for oil - water - amphiphile mixtures @xcite .",
    "this model has been used previously to calculate the spectrum of capillary waves of an oil / water interface @xcite , to explain the wetting behavior of the microemulsion at the oil / water interface @xcite , to describe several ordered phases like a lamellar , a hexagonal and a cubic phase @xcite , and to study the behavior of amphiphilic systems in confined geometry @xcite . the same model has also been used to predict sound attenuation and dispersion in microemulsions @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite this model has been studied by monte carlo simulations .",
    "it has been shown that there is a region in the phase diagram , where the microemulsion is stabilized by thermal fluctuations .",
    "this is the part of the phase diagram we want to investigate here in more detail . in particular ,",
    "simulations are used to calculate the scattering intensity both in bulk and film contrast , and the geometrical quantities area , euler characteristic and the mean curvature squared .",
    "the results are then compared with the results obtained from a simple variational calculation and from a self - consistent perturbation theory .",
    "the variational approach has been applied recently to calculate the scattering intensity of an ensemble of random interfaces with bending rigidity @xcite . to make the random interface model accessible to the variational method , a mean - spherical approximation has been used as a first step . in comparison to that model",
    ", we are here in the unique position that we can directly compare the results obtained from the variational approach with the results of our monte carlo simulation , and thus check the quality of this approximation .",
    "our analysis is based on the free - energy functional @xcite @xmath5 for a single , scalar order parameter field @xmath6 , which is proportional to the local difference of the oil and water concentrations . here , @xmath7 is the chemical potential difference between oil and water .",
    "the amphiphile concentration does not appear explicitly in our model , and should be considered to be integrated out @xcite .",
    "the average amphiphile concentration enters the model ( [ gl ] ) via the parameters of the functions @xmath8 and @xmath9 , which are chosen to take the form @xcite @xmath10 with this choice for @xmath8 and @xmath9 , a three - phase coexistence between a oil - rich phase with @xmath11 , a water - rich phase with @xmath12 , and a microemulsion with @xmath13 can be described .",
    "we consider here only systems with oil - water symmetry , where @xmath14 .",
    "the constant @xmath15 in eq .",
    "( [ f ] ) is proportional to the chemical potential of the amphiphile , while @xmath16 decreases with increasing amphiphile strength or amphiphile concentration @xcite .",
    "the value of @xmath16 determines the behavior of correlation function @xmath17 , and of the scattering intensity in bulk contrast @xcite . for @xmath16",
    "sufficiently small or negative , the correlation function in the microemulsion decays with damped oscillations , while the scattering intensity has a peak at non - zero wavevector @xmath18 . to ensure a monotonic decay of @xmath19 in the oil - rich and water - rich phases , we choose @xmath20 the natural length scale of the model ( [ gl ] ) , ( [ f ] ) , ( [ g ] ) is @xcite @xmath21 for all explicit calculations , we use the parameter set @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , and @xmath25",
    "; this implies in particular @xmath26 .",
    "thus , we study the microemulsion structure as a function of the parameters @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "the same model can also be interpreted as a model for binary amphiphilic systems @xcite , if the amphiphilic molecules form bilayers without holes or seams .",
    "the bilayers separate space into an `` inside '' ( @xmath27 ) and an `` outside '' ( @xmath28 ) . in this case",
    ", the microemulsion phase corresponds to the symmetric sponge phase , and the oil - rich and water - rich phases to the asymmetric droplet phase .",
    "to study the field - theoretic model ( [ gl ] ) by monte carlo simulations , space has to be discretized by introducing a simple cubic @xmath29 lattice with lattice constant @xmath30 ( and periodic boundary conditions ) .",
    "however , the order parameter field @xmath31 at each lattice site @xmath32 is still a continuous , real variable .",
    "details about the simulation procedure , about the triangulation of the @xmath33 surface , and about the calculation of the area can be found in ref .",
    "in addition to the quantities @xcite studied in ref .",
    "@xcite , we also calculate here the mean curvature squared and the scattering intensity in film contrast .",

    "each triangle has a normal vector @xmath49 pointing towards the oil . for the calculation of the radius of curvature",
    ", we have to assume that the two triangles are approximately equilateral .",
    "the radius of the sphere , which touches both triangles in their centers of mass , is then taken to be the radius of curvature , @xmath50 the sign of @xmath51 is easily obtained from the two normal vectors , and the vector connecting the centers of mass of the two triangles .",
    "the mean curvature @xmath52 of the whole triangle @xmath43 is obtained by a sum over the contributions from the edges with the three neighboring triangles @xmath53 , @xmath54 , and @xmath55 , weighted with the lengths of these edges , @xmath56 we want to point out that it is essential to define the mean curvature on triangles rather than on edges , because only in this way can the mean curvature near saddle points be described correctly .    the total mean curvature and the total mean curvature squared are then sums over all triangles , @xmath57 where the integral is over the whole surface .",
    "the additional factor @xmath58 is obtained by triangulating the surface of a sphere and comparing the results ( [ curv ] ) and ( [ curv_square ] ) with the exact results in the limit of large sphere radius . a similar procedure has been used in refs . @xcite and @xcite .    in order to test the quality of these expressions , we have calculated the ( average ) mean curvature and mean curvature squared for spheres and cylinders , as a function of the radius @xmath59 . for @xmath60 , where @xmath30 is the lattice constant",
    ", the agreement with the exact results is very good , with deviations of only a few percent .",
    "we have also studied corrugated surfaces ( with saddle points ) , which are given by the monge parametrization @xmath61 . in this case , the deviations are less than a few percent for @xmath62 with @xmath63 , and for @xmath64 with @xmath65 .    an important question in any monte carlo simulation is if the system has reached thermal equilibrium . to answer this question ,",
    "we have calculated the auto - correlation function @xcite in thermal equilibrium , as a function of monte carlo time @xmath66 , @xmath67 } { n^3 \\left [ < \\phi(0 , 0)^2 > - < \\phi(0 , 0)>^2 \\right ] } \\ ] ] where @xmath68 is the number of lattice sites .",
