    "the importance of mass loss in the evolution of massive stars has been increasingly recognized over the past 20 years ( e.g. @xcite ) . however , the radiatively - driven winds @xcite of ob stars are host to a number of forms of instability ( e.g. @xcite ) and other competing physical processes which are not yet fully accounted for in models .",
    "thus an important piece of the puzzle is missing to achieve a global understanding of these stars and of their characteristically strong outflows .",
    "this is evidenced by different forms of spectral variability in wind - sensitive lines .",
    "first , there are stochastic variations , which can occur over very short timescales ( minutes ) .",
    "these are believed to be related to instability mechanisms , such as clumping , and can be found notably atop the broad emission lines of wolf - rayet stars ( e.g. @xcite ) .    on the other hand ,",
    "there are also cyclical ( or quasi - periodic ) variations which occur typically over longer timescales ( for a complete review of the various forms cyclical variations can take , see @xcite ) .",
    "one example consists of the so - called  periodic absorption modulations \" , or pams , observed in a number of ob stars ( e.g. @xcite ) and which manifest themselves as optical depth modulations in the absorption troughs of ultraviolet ( uv ) p cygni profiles .",
    "they can show a  phase - bowing \" , appearing at intermediate velocities and bending slightly upwards in the dynamic spectra , therefore occuring quasi - simultaneously at all velocities shortly thereafter ( as in hd  64760 , @xcite ) .",
    "pam variabilities occur on intermediate timescales ( hours ) and their physical cause is not known .    in parallel ,",
    "one of the most common forms of cyclical variability among ob stars is the presence of so - called  discrete absorption components \" ( dacs ) .",
    "these features are formed in the uv resonance lines of hot massive stars and appear as narrow , blueward - travelling absorption structures .",
    "their progression from low to near - terminal velocity over time distinguishes this form of variability from the aforementioned pams . as was first shown in time series of iue spectra @xcite",
    ", dacs recur cyclically on longer timescales ( days ) and at relatively well - constrained periods .",
    "these timescales were found to be correlated with the projected rotational velocity ( @xmath0 ) , suggesting that these variations are rotationally modulated @xcite .",
    "dacs are thought to be present in all ob stars .",
    "indeed , narrow absorption components ( nacs ; narrow absorption features typically found near terminal velocity ) , believed to be snapshots of dacs , are found in nearly all massive stars observed by iue @xcite .",
    "however , this does not mean that all dacs are identical .",
    "their depths vary from one star to another ( they can even be opaque ) , and it is possible to find more than one dac at a time in single observations @xcite . because they span the full range of velocities over time , it is believed that they are caused by large - scale azimuthal structures extending from the base of the wind all the way to its outer regions @xcite .",
    "@xcite showed that a perturbation in the photosphere could lead to co - rotating interaction regions ( cirs ) , although the physical nature of this perturbation is not yet known .",
    "this model seems consistent with the dac phenomenon and leads to promising simulated spectral signatures .",
    "the goal of this project is to determine what physical process constitutes the origin of dacs . obviously , there are far - reaching implications for the general study of massive stars , since dacs are believed to be common to all ob stars .",

    "@xcite claim this star to be magnetic , a result we do not reproduce here . although their nightly observations possess better individual error bars , their longitudinal field curve has an amplitude of roughly 120 g and implies a surface dipole field of at least 360 g , which seems inconsistent with the 224 g upper limit we place on @xmath7 . period analysis performed on our longitudinal field measurements",

    "the smallest nightly longitudinal field error bar calculated from these data is 4 g , and the derived dipolar field strength upper limit is 23 g , both of which are the best constraints obtained for any star in this sample .",
    "as shown in the previous sections , no large - scale dipolar magnetic field is detected in any of the 13 stars of this sample . however , in order to draw conclusions on whether such fields could be the cause for dacs , it is important to investigate the different possible interactions between weak , potentially undetected magnetic fields and stellar winds .",
    "one form of interaction that has been increasingly investigated in the past years is magnetic wind confinement .",
    "indeed , the magnetic field can channel the wind and closed loops can effectively `` confine '' it , leading to material trapped in a magnetosphere of closed magnetic loops .",
    "@xcite introduce the following  wind confinement \" parameter to characterize this interaction :    @xmath8    where @xmath9 corresponds to the strength of the magnetic field at the equator ( which equals half of the dipole polar field strength , @xmath7 ) , @xmath10 is the stellar radius , @xmath11 is the mass - loss rate and @xmath12 is the terminal velocity of the wind . in effect",
    ", this parameter corresponds to the ratio of the magnetic field energy density and the wind kinetic energy density at the stellar surface ; therefore , its value gives a sense of which of the two dominates . if @xmath13 , then the wind s momentum causes the magnetic field lines to stretch out radially and the outflow is essentially unperturbed . on the other hand ,",
    "if @xmath14 , then the strong magnetic field lines are perpendicular to the outflow at the star s magnetic equator , barring the passage of charged material . depending on the rotational parameters of the star , this can lead either to a centrifugal or a dynamical magnetosphere ( for a detailed description of both these cases , see @xcite ) .    in intermediate cases however , the effect of the magnetic field can be somewhat more subtle .",
    "an in - depth analysis of this regime is presented by @xcite and leads to two main thresholds :    * for @xmath15 , the wind is considered to be confined by the magnetic field ; * for @xmath16 , the wind is not confined , but its flow is significantly affected by the magnetic field .    therefore , we will consider that for @xmath17 , the dynamical effect of the magnetic field on the wind is likely to be too weak to cause dacs",
    ". an upper limit on the value of the @xmath18 parameter was computed for each star of the sample ( @xmath19 ) using the upper limit on @xmath7 derived from the bayesian inference , and the results are presented in table  [ tab : bp ] .",
    "it should be noted here that the wind parameter values used to compute these @xmath18 upper limits are determined empirically . for magnetic stars ,",
    "it is necessary to use theoretical mass - loss rates instead of observed values to represent the net surface driving force , since a significant part of the outflow can be confined by the magnetic field , and would then not be detected at larger radii @xcite .",
    "however , in the case of apparently non - magnetic stars , the picture is not so clear .",
    "furthermore , our empirical values are found to be systematically comparable to or smaller than theoretical values ; since we are deriving conservative constraints , it seemed more consistent to use the overall smaller empirical values . finally , while it might be argued that there are important uncertainties associated with empirical determinations of wind parameters , theoretical prescriptions ( such as @xcite ) propagate the rather sizeable uncertainties on masses and luminosities , so there is no obvious reason to choose one over the other based on such an argument .",
    "the value of @xmath19 ranges between 0.072 and 5.75 , with one star below a value of 0.1 ( 10 lac ) and a majority of the stars below a value of 1 ( 9/13 ) . as for the stars with @xmath20 , they all have very high projected rotational velocities , thus making it difficult to tightly constrain the field strength .",
    "these results are also illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : eta ] , where the x - axis corresponds loosely to the wind kinetic energy density and the y - axis corresponds to the magnetic energy density .",
    "the dashed lines represent our two chosen thresholds .",
    "given the fact that the represented values all correspond to upper limits , we can infer that at least a few of these stars do not have magnetic fields strong enough to dynamically affect the wind outflow on the equatorial plane ( as also evidenced by the 68.3% confidence interval upper limits ) .",
    "in addition to the upper limits , we use the pdfs to assess the sample s distribution of confinement , assuming that each star contributes probabilistically to various field strength bins according to its normalized probability density function ( constructing , in other words , a  probabilistic histogram \" of field strengths ) . in this way",
    ", we account for both the most probable field strength as well as the large - field tail of the distributions .",
    "the top panel of figure  [ fig : cum_pdfs ] shows this global cumulative pdf for the wind confinement parameter .",
    "we expect any star selected from the sample to have @xmath21 ( which is well below the threshold of @xmath22 ) with a probability of 50% , or in other words , we expect half of the sample to have a confinement parameter value below 0.02 . using this cumulative pdf",
    ", we can also calculate that 75.6% of the sample should have @xmath23 and 93.9% of the sample should have @xmath24 . assuming this small sample is representative of the larger population of stars displaying dacs",
    ", this implies that there is no significant dipolar magnetic dynamic influence on the wind for most of these stars . under these conditions ,",
    "wind confinement by a dipolar magnetic field does not seem to be a viable mechanism to produce dac - like variations in all stars .",
    "the derived values of @xmath18 are sensitive to uncertainties in the values of @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "while the last parameter is essentially identical in all studies , in some extreme cases values of @xmath10 can be up to 2 - 2.5 times larger than the adopted values , whereas @xmath11 can be up to 10 times larger .",
    "such differences would result respectively in a 6-fold increase and a 10-fold decrease in the inferred value of @xmath18 .",
    "however , studies that infer larger stellar radii also tend to infer larger mass loss rates ( e.g. @xcite , with @xmath1 per and hd 34656 ) .",
    "thus one effect approximately offsets the other . the largest potential increase",
    "in inferred @xmath18 for a star of our sample would occur for @xmath2 cam ; based on the values measured by @xcite ( about 1.5 times increase in radius , and half the mass - loss rate ) , we obtain an increase of @xmath18 by a factor of 4 . however , for typical combinations of @xmath10 and @xmath11 obtained from other studies , we obtain values of @xmath18 that are either comparable in magnitude , or smaller ( up to an order of magnitude ) than those inferred using the adopted parameters .",
    "do these results rule out dipolar fields altogether ?",
    "@xcite simply introduce bright spots on the surface of the star , with no particular attention to the mechanism creating these .",
    "while wind confinement is possibly the most obvious effect of a magnetic field on the ouflowing material driven from the surface of a massive star , there might also be more subtle interactions .",
    "for instance , the magnetic pressure at the poles of a weak large - scale dipolar field could lower the local gas pressure , thus reducing the gas density and leading to a lower optical depth . hence , light coming from the pole would actually probe hotter regions within the star .",
    "this could cause bright spots like those in the @xcite model . making a few assumptions ( closely modeled on the calculations of @xcite )",
    ", we can derive a simplified formula for the magnetic field ( @xmath25 ) required to produce a given brightness enhancement . indeed ,",
    "if we consider a flux tube at the photosphere , we can compare a zone outside of the tube ( @xmath26 ) to a zone inside the tube ( @xmath27 ) .",
    "furthermore , we assume a grey atmosphere :    @xmath28    where @xmath29 is the temperature and @xmath30 is the effective temperature ( corresponding to an optical depth , @xmath31 , of 2/3 ) . at equilibrium , the gas pressures ( @xmath32 ) inside and outside",
    "the tube only differ by the value of the magnetic pressure ( @xmath33 ) :    @xmath34    where primed variables refer to values inside the flux tube , by opposition to unprimed variables which refer to values outside the flux tube .",
    "the optical depth can be written as a function of gas pressure :    @xmath35    where @xmath36 is the mean rosseland opacity , and @xmath37 is the surface gravity . to determine the brightness enhancement , we need to find the temperature corresponding to an optical depth of 2/3 inside the flux tube ( assuming magneto - hydrostatic and temperature equilibrium at a given vertical depth ) :    @xmath38    finally ,",
    "since the flux is proportional to the fourth power of the temperature , the brightness enhancement can be expressed as :    @xmath39    now , using typical values for o dwarfs ( @xmath40 and @xmath41 ) , it is very simple to perform sample calculations .",
    "for instance , the main model used by @xcite uses a 50% enhancement .",
    "the field required to produce such an enhancement is of the order of 400 g , assuming a magnetic region surrounded by an adjacent non - magnetic region . on the other hand",
    ", the same paper shows that dac - like behaviour can arise with an enhancement as small as 10% .",
    "the associated field would be of the order of 180 g. the dipolar field upper limits shown in table  [ tab : bp ] are almost all ( 9/13 ) under that value . while models with smaller brightness enhancements are not tested in their study , this mechanism associated with dipolar magnetic fields does not provide a viable way of producing dacs given the observational constraints obtained in this study .",
    "once again , in very much the same way as we did for @xmath18 , we can compile a global cumulative pdf for @xmath7 ( bottom panel of figure  [ fig : cum_pdfs ] ) .",
    "the results are quite telling : 50% of the sample should have @xmath42 23 g , and 95.8% ( 99.0% ) of the sample should have a smaller dipolar field strength value than that required to produce a 10% ( 50% ) local brightness enhancement .",
    "even if dipolar fields seem to be an unlikely cause for dacs , the general case for magnetism is not settled .",
    "indeed , structured small - scale magnetic fields could arise as a consequence of the subsurface convection zone caused by the iron opacity bump at @xmath43 @xcite .",
    "then , magnetic spots at the surface of the star could possibly give rise to cirs ( e.g. @xcite ) , even though they are expected to be relatively weak ( to have a surface field of at least 160 g , we need a 40 + @xmath44 star ) .",
    "while the detection of such fields is an arduous task @xcite , proving their existence and understanding their structure might hold the key to this old problem , as well as other similar problems ( e.g. in ba supergiants , see @xcite ) .",
    "good candidates for follow - up deep magnetometry might be @xmath4 ori and 10 lac .",
    "the former has the advantage of being very bright and having a relatively low value of @xmath0 , while the latter has very low projected rotational velocity ( for an o star ) .",
    "lac already has decent time coverage , but could benefit from obtaining more observations per night .    in parallel to observational efforts , theoretical investigations are required in order to probe the parameter space of magnetic field strengths and configurations to find out which types of fields can give rise to dac - like phenomena .",
    "numerical simulations can also be used to investigate mechanisms other than magnetism , as well as constrain the required brightness enhancement in a @xcite model analog to create cirs in the first place .",
    "the next paper of this series will explore the magnetic spot hypothesis and hopefully place constraints on how likely such a mechanism is to cause dacs .",

    "<S> ob stars exhibit various types of spectral variability associated with wind structures , including the apparently ubiquitous discrete absorption components ( dacs ) . </S>",
    "<S> these are proposed to be caused by either magnetic fields or non - radial pulsations ( nrps ) . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> , we evaluate the possible relation between large - scale , dipolar magnetic fields and the dac phenomenon by investigating the magnetic properties of a sample of 13 ob stars exhibiting well - documented dac behaviour .    using high - precision spectropolarimetric data acquired in part in the context of the magnetism in massive stars ( mimes ) project </S>",
    "<S> , we find no evidence for surface dipolar magnetic fields in any of these stars . </S>",
    "<S> using bayesian inference , we compute upper limits on the strengths of the fields and use these limits to assess two potential mechanisms by which the field may influence wind outflow : magnetic wind confinement and local photospheric brightness enhancements . within the limits we derive , both mechanisms fail to provide a systematic process capable of producing dacs in all of the stars of our sample . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , this implies that dipolar fields are highly unlikely to be responsible for these structures in all massive stars , meaning that some other mechanism must come into play .    </S>",
