    "the phenomenon of bragg scattering , where a wave interacts with an extended periodic structure , was first observed by w. h. and w. l. bragg @xcite in experiments scattering x - rays from crystal planes . in 1988 martin et al .",
    "@xcite demonstrated the matter wave equivalent using an atomic beam of neutral atoms interacting with a light grating , and subsequently , bragg scattering has been widely used in atomic optics and interferometry ( e.g see @xcite ) .",
    "bose condensates , with their extended spatial coherence , offer significantly enhanced scope for the application of this technique , and it has already become an important tool in the investigation and manipulation of this new state of matter . in recent experiments",
    "bragg scattering has been used on condensates to engineer the meanfield wavefunction @xcite , to measure coherence and correlations @xcite , and act as a beam - splitter @xcite .",
    "most of the existing theory of atomic bragg scattering has concentrated on treating plane - wave single atom states ( e.g see @xcite ) , and while this captures some key behaviour , it does not account for some distinctive properties of condensates , such as nonlinear collisional self interaction and nonuniform spatial distribution .",
    "zhang and walls @xcite have developed a theory of bragg scattering for cold atom beams which includes some effects of atomic interactions , although the resulting nonlinear interaction term they derive is of an unconventional form .",
    "their accompanying numerical calculation for a beam - splitter process shows that the inclusion of nonlinearity can give rise to qualitatively new effects .    in this paper , we present a unified semi - classical treatment of bragg scattering from condensates , in which the condensate is described in the meanfield limit , and the applied laser fields",
    "are treated as classical fields . beginning with gross - pitaevskii equations we obtain a single component equation describing the interaction of a condensate with a light field grating formed at the intersection of two far detuned laser beams .",
    "the lasers may be pulsed or cw , and arbitrary geometries are allowed .",
    "this formalism is sufficiently general to include diffraction ( where the light grating has rapid transverse spatial variation or the interaction time is short ) and channeling ( where the lasers have high intensity ) , but in this paper we concentrate on the regime of bragg scattering , for which the output state has momentum components only in a single narrow range .",
    "accordingly we consider only those cases for which the transverse spatial laser profiles vary slowly in comparison to the condensate , and the interaction time is long .    in order to characterise the effect of nonlinearity and spatial nonuniformity , we have numerically simulated our single component equation in three dimensions .",
    "we consider the case where the light fields are applied immediately after the condensate is released from a trap , and also the case where the condensate remains trapped .",
    "some aspects of the behaviour , notably the shift of the bragg resonance condition , are due directly to the nonlinearity .",
    "however , we also find that over a usefully wide parameter range , much of the behaviour can be understood in terms of a framework provided by the linear results .",
    "to facilitate comparison with the linear case , we present a novel treatment of linear bragg scattering for a released condensate , which conveniently incorporates spatial nonuniformity . this model is based on a partitioned representation of momentum space and under appropriate validity conditions , reduces to a set of two state systems , allowing simple expressions to be found for the dynamical behaviour of momentum wave packets , and the momentum transition linewidth .",
    "we determine the validity range over which the linear treatment accurately describes bragg scattering of nonlinear released condensates , and identify two main mechanisms responsible for the failure of the linear model ; meanfield expansion and nonlinear dispersion .",
    "we verify our analysis by numerical simulation of the full nonlinear equations , and also investigate numerically the nonlinear shift of the bragg resonance in a trapped condensate .",
    "the paper is organised as follows . in section",
    "ii we begin with gross - pitaevskii equations and derive the one component equation that is the basis for the rest of the paper . in section",
    "iii we present an analytic treatment of linear bragg scattering from a released condensate , based on a partitioned representation of the momentum wavefunction , and formulate the treatment as a tridiagonal matrix equation . under well defined approximations , this reduces to a two - state form which is easily solved , and in section iv we examine the properties of the solution and introduce dispersion curve plots to help visualise the implications of our approximations .",
    "in section v we consider in detail the effects of nonlinearity on bragg scattering from released condensates , and finally in section vi , we consider momentum spectroscopy from condensates in harmonic traps .",
    "we consider as our model a coherent system of atoms in a light field grating provided by two crossed laser beams .",
    "the laser fields are treated as plane - wave classical fields with wave - vectors and frequencies @xmath0 and @xmath1 respectively . for convenience",
    "we shall assume the electric fields are of equal intensity , and so the total field is given by @xmath2 where @xmath3.\\ ] ] we have neglected any spatial variation of the slowly varying amplitude @xmath4 ( although it would be trivial to include ) , but include a time dependence to allow for the possibility of pulsed fields .",
    "the condensate is treated in the meanfield limit and has two internal states @xmath5 and @xmath6 separated by a bohr frequency @xmath7 and with a dipole matrix element @xmath8 .",
    "the coupling of theses two states by an electric field is characterised by the rabi frequency , @xmath9 .",
    "the meanfield equations for the ground and excited state wavefunctions @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the time dependent gross - pitaevskii equations    @xmath12    where @xmath13 and @xmath14 characterise the intra - species collisional interactions , and @xmath15 the interspecies interaction .",
    "the functions @xmath16 represent the trapping potentials for the respective internal states , and we include time dependence in order that they can be dynamically altered .",
    "we assume the laser frequencies @xmath1 are sufficiently off resonant from the @xmath17 transition that the laser field undergoes negligible modification in propagating through the condensate , and furthermore that spontaneous emission ( and its effect on condensate coherence ) can be ignored . in this large detuning limit",
    "it is also permissible to adiabatically eliminate the excited state from eq .",
    "( [ full_evolve_eq ] ) , leaving only an equation for @xmath10 .",
    "details of this procedure are given in the appendix [ adiaelimsec ] , where it is shown that provided the detuning @xmath18 ( @xmath19 ) is sufficiently large that the energy @xmath20 exceeds all other external energies associated with the excited state , we obtain the one component equation for the ground state wavefunction @xmath21 the wavefunction @xmath22 is the ground state wavefunction in an interaction picture , and for clarity we have written @xmath23 for @xmath13 and @xmath24 for @xmath25 , and have defined the quantities    @xmath26    where @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "the function @xmath29 contains the periodic spatial and temporal evolution of the optical potential , and arises by neglecting certain rapidly rotating terms in the adiabatic elimination ( see appendix [ adiaelimsec ] for details ) .    for the coupled system described by eq .",
    "( [ spatial - evolution - equation ] ) the duration of the grating amplitude @xmath30 is a key factor in determining the nature of the system response . for bragg scattering",
    "the pulse duration @xmath31 must be of order @xcite @xmath32    in most of this paper ( sections [ analytictreatmentsec]-[appnonlinear ] ) we will consider the case of bragg scattering from a condensate released from a harmonic trapping potential ( i.e. the trapping potential is set to @xmath33 at @xmath34 ) .",
    "it is also possible to have the trap on during the bragg pulses , and obtain a result qualitatively similar to scattering from a released condensate , provided the trap does not remain on too long .",
    "the time duration should be less than a trap period , ( so that the trap itself does not significantly alter momentum components ) and less than the characteristic time of momentum spreading of a released condensate ( which occurs due to mean field expansion , see section [ appnonlinear ] ) .",
    "equation ( [ spatial - evolution - equation ] ) is the basic equation for this paper and is familiar in atom optics .",
    "in general it is difficult to solve because of the nonlinear term and in order to explore the types of behaviour that can occur , we have obtained numerical solutions for a range of parameters .",
    "our solutions are in three dimensions , but restricted ( by computational resources ) to the case of cylindrical symmetry , a choice which requires @xmath35 to be in the axial direction ( i.e. @xmath36 ) .",
    "we present in fig .",
    "[ complex_density_fig ] a sequence of images showing the density of a condensate evolving in the presence of a light grating , and illustrating the complexity that can typically occur .",
    "the condensate was released from a spherical harmonic trap at time @xmath34 , and the light grating applied immediately after . during this simulation",
    "we can see fringes developing in the density profile , which is characteristic of interference between a stationary and a moving wavepacket . as time",
    "progresses the spatial distribution extends in the @xmath37 direction at a much faster rate than spreading occurs in the perpendicular directions , and the density distribution becomes less uniform ( see fig .",

    "are given in dimensionless units .",
    "since the initial states for the simulations we discuss in this paper are related to eigenstates of harmonic traps , we have chosen to use harmonic oscillator units for the problem .",
    "the transformation between s.i ( @xmath38 ) and harmonic oscillator units ( @xmath39 ) is    @xmath40    where @xmath41 is the trap frequency , @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "it is evident that the simplified treatment of bragg scattering of condensates encompassed in eq .",
    "( [ spatial - evolution - equation ] ) can give rise to quite complex behaviour . here",
    "we derive an analytic treatment of the model that will provide a simple understanding of the behaviour over a wide parameter regime .",
    "we begin by transforming the equation into momentum space , where the momentum space wavefunction @xmath44 is defined as the spatial fourier transform    @xmath45    henceforth , for the sake of notational clarity , we will suppress the explicit time dependence of the momentum wavefunction , and simply write * @xmath46 * , for * @xmath47*. straightforward manipulation of eq .",
