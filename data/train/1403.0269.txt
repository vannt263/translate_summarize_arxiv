    "the spinel vanadates ( @xmath3 ) are an important model family for the study of orbital order , and notable for the frustrated pyrochlore network of spin and orbitally - active vanadium cations therein@xcite .",
    "the major outstanding question in the study of these compounds is the nature of the orbital ordered state at low temperatures , and scattering studies are playing an important role in determining the relative importance of sub - dominate interaction and crystal field terms in the magnetic hamiltonian . here",
    ", we present inelastic neutron scattering data on @xmath0 which contribute to this important conversation .",
    "@xmath0 is a ferrimagnetic spinel , characterized by two orbitally active cation sites , and shown by previous diffraction studies to have three structural and two magnetic transitions@xcite .",
    "we report on the existence of two inelastic spin - wave modes in the low temperature magnetic phases whose dispersions are well described by a model that assumes significant trigonal crystal fields at the vanadium site .",
    "our data further show that the spin gap has a temperature dependence that reflects both magnetic transitions , and suggests that a full description of magnetism in this material requires consideration of the orbital order which exists on both cation sites .",
    "spinel vanadates with divalent transition metal atoms on the a - site are mott insulators , and the octahedrally coordinated vanadium ( @xmath4 ) cations on the pyrochlore sublattice have s=1 spin and orbital triplet degrees - of - freedom in the ideal cubic phase . nearly without exception , each exhibits a cubic - to - tetragonal structural transition with decreasing temperature , which partially lifts the orbital degeneracy and alters magnetic properties . in materials with non - magnetic a - site cations ( @xmath5 ) , the cubic - tetragonal transition precedes the onset of @xmath6 antiferromagnetic order at lower temperature@xcite .",
    "the ferrimagnetic materials @xmath1 and @xmath0 are observed to have successive collinear neel and canted antiferromagnetic transitions@xcite , where the spin canting is coincident with the onset of the low - temperature tetragonal structure . though generally associated with orbital order , the nature of these structural transitions and the exact configuration of electron orbitals at low temperatures are issues of active interest .",
    "discussions of orbital order have largely focused on the relative importance of two proposed patterns : a form of antiferro - orbital order ( afo ) containing an alternating pattern of real orbitals in the @xmath7-plane @xcite , and a form of ferro - orbital order ( foo ) where each site is occupied by a complex superposition of orbitals@xcite .",
    "the two patterns are associated with slightly different tetragonal space groups , with the foo pattern containing an additional glide plane symmetry ( space group @xmath8 , rather than @xmath9 ) , but both were derived assuming a tetragonally distorted cubic crystal field environment .",
    "recent developments , however , have indicated that a full understanding of the orbital ground state might require a proper treatment of the _ trigonal _ crystal fields which exist in the spinel structure when the fractional coordinate , @xmath10 , deviates from its ideal value of 0.25@xcite .",
    "trigonal fields have been invoked to explain neutron scattering data in @xmath11@xcite and the existence of a high field transition in @xmath12@xcite .",

    "one possible explanation for their absence is that they exist at energies above our measurement range ; as shown in the supplementary information@xcite , spin - wave curves associated with the parameters in table  1 indeed predict the four remaining modes reside in the energy range 30 - 60 mev .",

    "a strong counter - argument to this conclusion is the different tetragonal space groups reported for @xmath1 and @xmath0 .",
    "in fact , the @xmath8 space group reported for @xmath0@xcite contains a glide - plane symmetry that is expected to be broken in the quantum 120@xmath18 model , and normal mode analysis of recent x - ray diffraction data suggests fundamentally different orbitally ordered states for the mn and fe compounds@xcite .",

    "<S> the spinel vanadates have become a model family for exploring orbital order on the frustrated pyrochlore lattice , and recent debate has focused on the symmetry of local crystal fields at the cation sites . here , we present neutron scattering measurements of the magnetic excitation spectrum in @xmath0 , a recent example of a ferrimagnetic spinel vanadate which is available in single crystal form . </S>",
    "<S> we report the existence of two emergent magnon modes at low temperatures , which draw strong parallels with the closely related material , @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> we were able to reproduce the essential elements of both the magnetic ordering pattern and the dispersion of the inelastic modes with semiclassical spin wave calculations , using a minimal model that implies a sizeable single - ion anisotropy on the vanadium sublattice . </S>",
    "<S> taking into account the direction of ordered spins , we associate this anisotropy with the large trigonal distortion of @xmath2 octahedra , previously observed via neutron powder diffraction measurements . </S>",
    "<S> we further report on the spin gap , which is an order - of - magnitude larger than that observed in @xmath1 . by looking at the overall temperature dependence </S>",
    "<S> , we were able to show that the gap magnitude is largely associated with the ferro - orbital order known to exist on the iron sublattice , but the contribution to the gap from the vanadium sublattice is in fact comparable to what is reported in the mn compound . </S>",
    "<S> this reinforces the conclusion that the spin canting transition is associated with the ordering of vanadium orbitals in this system , and closer analysis indicates closely related physics underlying orbital transitions in @xmath0 and @xmath1 . </S>"
