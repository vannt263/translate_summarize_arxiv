    "atomic and molecular ultracold gases offer many advantages for studying quantum phenomena , especially within the realm of many - body physics , due to the high degree of tunability of inter - atomic interactions @xcite .",
    "in particular , dipolar quantum gases of atoms and molecules have received much attention in recent years , as the anisotropic and long - range nature of the magnetic or electric dipole - dipole interaction ( ddi ) gives rise to a rich spectrum of novel properties in such systems @xcite .",
    "such systems include those made up of ultracold atoms , as well as those consisting of heteronuclear molecules with large dipole - dipole interactions .",
    "furthermore , in the recent theoretical and experimental research  @xcite a novel kind of strongly dipolar quantum gas was introduced .",
    "these are weakly bound polar molecules produced from atoms with large magnetic dipole moments , such as erbium and other lanthanides .",
    "these molecules can have a very large magnetic moment , which amounts to twice that of its individual atoms @xcite .    in 2005",
    "an anisotropic deformation of the expanding dipolar bosonic chromium condensate due to ddi was observed @xcite . in the recent experiment @xcite ,",
    "also the rosensweig instability was detected in a @xmath0dy bose - einstein condensate , which represents a quantum ferrofluid due to the large atomic magnetic dipole moments .",
    "namely , after a sudden decrease of the scattering length , the dipolar quantum gas creates self - ordered surface structures in form of droplet crystals , which can only be understood by taking into account ddi @xcite and the corresponding quantum fluctuations @xcite .    for dipolar fermi gases",
    "it was predicted that the long - range and anisotropic ddi leads in equilibrium to an anisotropic deformation of the fermi surface from a sphere to an ellipsoid @xcite .",
    "a recent time - of - flight ( tof ) expansion experiment has now unambiguously detected such an ellipsoidal fermi surface ( fs ) deformation in a dipolar quantum gas of fermionic erbium atoms , which turns out to be of the order of a few percent @xcite . within the hartree - fock mean - field theory for a many - body system , first - order contributions of ddi to the total energy of the system taken into account are in terms of both the hartree direct interaction and the fock exchange interaction @xcite . in the case of a fermi gas with isotropic interaction ,",
    "the hartree and the fock interactions cancel out @xcite , thus leading to a spherically symmetric fs .",
    "but in the case of a fermi gas with anisotropic ddi the hartree term gives rise to a distortion in real space @xcite , whereas the fock term gives rise to a distortion in momentum space , i.e. , to an ellipsoidal deformation of the fermi sphere .",
    "note in this context that the fock exchange term in dipolar fermi gases is the consequence of a combined effect of the ddi and the pauli exclusion principle . in the current experimentally relevant range of dipolar interactions",
    "the theory beyond hartree - fock , where the total energy is determined up to second - order in the ddi , yields only small differences , which can not yet be resolved experimentally .",
    "therefore , the hartree - fock mean - field approximation yields already quantitatively accurate results for present - day experiments @xcite .    the investigations of collective oscillations and tof dynamics of dipolar fermi gases have so far focused on either the collisionless ( cl ) regime @xcite , where collisions can be neglected , or on the hydrodynamic ( hd ) regime @xcite , where collisions occur so often that local equilibrium can be assumed .",
    "the recent paper of wchtler _ et al . _",
    "@xcite studied even the behavior of collective oscillations when the system undergoes a crossover from one regime to the other .    motivated by the experimental observation of the ellipsoidal fs deformation in the tof experiment @xcite , we continue here the analytical analysis along the lines of reference  @xcite and investigate in detail the expansion dynamics for the collisional regime , which represents the transition zone between the limiting cl and hd regimes .",
    "we also extend previous approaches based on the relaxation - time approximation by introducing a self - consistently determined relaxation time , and study how this quantitatively affects the tof dynamics .",
    "the paper is structured as follows . in section  [ sec : amdfg ] we introduce our notation and summarize recent experiments on atomic and molecular dipolar fermi gases . in section  [ sec : ge ] we analyze the global equilibrium of the system by minimizing the hartree - fock total energy in order to obtain the thomas - fermi radii and momenta .",
    "afterwards , in order to study the dynamics , in section  [ sec : bve ] we follow reference  @xcite and introduce the boltzmann - vlasov equation for dipolar fermi gases as well as an approximative solution , which is based on a suitable rescaling ansatz for the equilibrium wigner function . in section  [ sec : tof ] we study in detail the tof expansion dynamics of an initially trapped fermi gas . to this end",
    "we present our analytical and numerical results of the tof analysis all the way from the collisionless to the hydrodynamic regime and reveal how the expanding cloud bears the signature of the underlying ddi .",
    "finally , section  [ sec : con ] gathers our concluding remarks and gives an outlook for future research .",
    "we consider a trapped ultracold quantum degenerate dipolar gas of single - component fermions of mass @xmath1 and magnetic dipole moment @xmath2 or electric dipole moment @xmath3 at zero temperature .",
    "the system is then described by the second - quantized hamiltonian @xmath4\\hat{\\psi } ( \\mathbf{r})\\nonumber\\\\ \\hspace*{10mm}+\\frac{1}{2 } \\int d\\mathbf{r}\\int d\\mathbf{r'}\\ , \\hat{\\psi}^\\dagger(\\mathbf{r'})\\hat{\\psi}^\\dagger(\\mathbf{r } ) v_\\mathrm{int}({\\bf r}-{\\bf r'})\\hat{\\psi } ( \\mathbf{r})\\hat{\\psi } ( \\mathbf{r'})\\ , .",

    "namely , for electric dipoles it is defined as @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the vacuum permittivity , while for magnetic dipoles one has @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the vacuum permeability .",
    "magnetic dipolar moments are usually measured in units of bohr magneton ( @xmath13 ) , and electric dipolar moments in units of debye ( @xmath14 ) .",

    "we consider the parameters of a recent innsbruck experiment @xcite performed with the fermionic erbium atoms @xmath27er in the collisionless regime , which are confined into a three - dimensional optical dipole trap with frequencies @xmath28 .",
    "it contained @xmath29 atoms at a temperature @xmath30 of @xmath31 , with the fermi temperature being @xmath32 .",

    "we restrict ourselves to the general geometry of the anisotropic trap , where the dipoles are oriented in the direction of one of the trap axis , which reflects the experimental situation at the two limiting cases @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "previous theoretical works have predicted that the degree of deformation of the fs depends on the fermi energy and the strength of the dipole moment @xcite , therefore we use a relative interaction strength of the ddi when comparing its effect on different species of ultracold fermi gases .",
    "the relative interaction strength is given by @xmath40 where @xmath41 denotes the geometric mean of the trap frequencies .",

    "later on , a degenerate fermi gas of erbium atoms @xcite and molecules @xcite was also realized .",
    "a dipolar fermi sea of degenerate @xmath44cr , together with a bec of @xmath45cr was produced in 2015 @xcite .",
    "few years ago a molecular dipolar gas of @xmath46k@xmath47rb was realized using a single step of stirap @xcite ( stimulated raman adiabatic passage ) with two - frequency laser irradiation @xcite , and with the same technique a new ultracold dipolar gas of fermionic molecules of @xmath48na@xmath46k was created in a recent experiment @xcite .",
    "the same technique can be also used for thermal @xcite and ultracold dipolar bose gases @xcite of heteronuclear molecues .",
    "we will consider the experimentally available range of relative strengths of the ddi and atom or molecule species given in table i in the following sections .",
    "therefore , the presented results are directly applicable to current and future experiments .",
    "a quantum many - body system can be described in terms of a wigner function @xmath49 , as it represents the wigner - weyl transform of the density matrix of the system and is equivalent to a quantum - mechanical wave function @xcite .",
    "the wigner function is a quasiprobability distribution function , and integrating it over the space or the momentum variables leads to the respective probability distribution functions .",
    "the quantum - mechanical expectation values of observables @xcite can be obtained as their phase - space averages , weighted by the wigner function .",
    "considering a trapped ultracold dipolar fermi gas , the equilibrium distribution function in the phase space will rapidly decrease to zero outside a certain closed surface , due to a combined effect of the pauli exclusion principle , which is responsible for a formation of the fs in the momentum space , and the trapping in real space .",
    "therefore , in order to model the global equilibrium distribution of the dipolar fermi gas we use an ansatz for the semiclassical wigner function , which resembles the form of the wigner - transformed fermi - dirac distribution of a noninteracting fermi gas .",
