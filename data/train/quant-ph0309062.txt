    "in the past decade it was demonstrated that for certain computational tasks , quantum algorithms are more efficient than classical algorithms .",
    "two examples of this effect are provided by shor s factorization algorithm @xcite and grover s search algorithm @xcite .",
    "while the understanding of quantum algorithms is still incomplete , there are indications that quantum entanglement plays a crucial role in making them powerful . quantum algorithms generate entangled states that involve large numbers of qubits . to assess the role of entanglement in the algorithms it would be useful to develop ways to quantify it , which are based on operational considerations .",
    "such considerations in the context of quantum communication between two parties were successfully applied to develop measures of entanglement for bi - partite systems @xcite .",
    "it is thus expected that operational considerations in the context of quantum computation , that involves multiple qubits , may lead to useful entanglement measures for multi - partite systems .",
    "recent work based on axiomatic considerations has provided a set of properties that entanglement measures should satisfy @xcite .",
    "these properties include the requirement that any entanglement measure should vanish for product states , it should be invariant under local unitary operations and should not increase as a result of any sequence of local operations complemented by only classical communication between the parties .",
    "these properties provide useful guidelines in the search for operational measures of entanglement based on quantum algorithms .",
    "measures that satisfy the properties specified above are called entanglement monotones .",
    "recently , it was shown that the entanglement of a pure quantum state @xmath1 of @xmath2 qubits can be quantified by the utility of this state as an initial state for grover s search algorithm @xcite .",
    "suppose that a given state @xmath1 is used as the initial state .",
    "however , before starting the search , one is allowed to perform local unitary operations on each qubit in order to maximize the probability , @xmath4 , of having a successful quantum search .",
    "it was shown that if @xmath1 can by transformed to some other state @xmath5 by local operations and classical communication then @xmath6 .",
    "this observation was used in order to construct the groverian entanglement measure @xmath0 of pure states .",
    "the groverian measure is an entanglement monotone , and is equivalent to an entanglement measure proposed previously in refs .",
    "@xcite , which is based on distance measures between @xmath1 and the nearest disentangled state .",
    "in this paper we present an explicit representation of @xmath0 and calculate it for a variety of pure entangled states using a combination of analytical and numerical methods .",
    "the difficulty is that the calculation of the groverian measure is based on the maximization of a multi - variable function .",
    "the number of variables over which the maximization is taken increases with the number of qubits , @xmath2 , in the state @xmath1 .",
    "the measure @xmath0 is calculated analytically for various quantum states that exhibit high symmetry , such as the greenberger - horne - zeilinger state @xcite and the w state @xcite of @xmath2 qubits .",
    "the numerical procedure is applied to the calculation of @xmath0 for the states that are produced by grover s algorithm as a function of the number of iterations , @xmath3 , when the initial state is either a product state or an entangled state and for different sets of marked states .",
    "finally , random states of @xmath2 qubits are also examined .",
    "it is found that homogeneous random sampling of pure states of @xmath2 qubits produces highly entangled states for which @xmath0 approaches 1 for large @xmath2 .",

    "we first introduce a register , @xmath18 , of @xmath2 qubits , and an _ ancilla _ qubit , @xmath19 , to be used in the computation .",
    "we also introduce a _ quantum oracle _ , a unitary operator @xmath20 which functions as a black box with the ability to _ recognize _ solutions to the search problem .",

    "the ancilla qubit is initially set to the state    @xmath29    with this choice , the action of the oracle is :    @xmath30    thus , the only effect of the oracle is to apply a phase of @xmath31 if @xmath32 is a marked basis state , and no phase change if @xmath32 is unmarked . since the state of the ancilla does not change , one my omit it and write the action of the oracle as @xmath33 .",
    "the original algorithm , as introduced by grover , includes an initialization stage in which the @xmath34 qubits of the register and the ancilla are prepared in the state @xmath35 .",

    "draws @xmath8 numbers , @xmath127 , @xmath10 , independently from a gaussian distribution centered at 0 , with a standard deviation @xmath232 .",
    "these numbers are then normalized according to    @xmath233    the moduli @xmath234 , @xmath10 are then obtained as the absolute values of the @xmath127 s .",
    "the arguments @xmath235 , @xmath10 are drawn from a homogeneous distribution in the range @xmath236 . due to the properties of the gaussian distribution ,",
    "the resulting states are distributed randomly and isotropically in the hilbert space that consists of all the pure states of @xmath2 qubits .    from the normalization condition",
    "we obtain that the second moment of the distribution of the moduli of the amplitudes ,    @xmath237    satisfies @xmath238 , namely , its square root is of order @xmath125 . in the case of the randomly chosen states , due to the random phases , the average amplitude @xmath239 [ given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : abar ] ) ] will be of the order of @xmath240 .",
    "therefore , the probability of success @xmath65 of grover s algorithm using a random state as the initial state will vanish like @xmath241 .",
    "our analysis of these states using the numerical procedure shows that for the random states the effect of the optimization procedure is negligible . as a result",
    ", @xmath84 also vanishes like @xmath241 .",
    "thus , the entanglement measure @xmath242 as the number of qubits increases indicating that the vast majority of the states of multiple qubits are very highly entangled .",
    "the groverian entanglement measure was applied to characterize a variety of pure quantum states of multiple qubits . for certain classes of states of high symmetry",
    ", the groverian measure was calculated analytically . in order to evaluate it for arbitrary states with complex amplitudes ,",
    "a numerical minimization procedure , based on the steepest descent algorithm was developed .",
    "it was used in order to evaluate the amount of entanglement generated by grover s algorithm for different initial states and for different sets of marked states .",
    "it was also shown that the typical pure states of @xmath2 qubits obtained by random sampling are highly entangled , namely for these states @xmath243 up to corrections of order @xmath241 .    in recent years",
    "several entanglement monotones were proposed as measures of entanglement of multiple qubits @xcite . unlike the case of pure states of two qubits ,",
    "in which the von neumann entropy provides a complete characterization of the entanglement , multiple qubit states support a large number of different measures . as a result",
    "there is no meaningful way to compare between the different measures .",
    "it seems that the issue of what measure is relevant depends on the specific physical or operational context .",
    "the actual evaluation of entanglement measures turns out to be a difficult computational problem .",
    "this is due to the fact that these measures are typically defined as an extremum of some multi - variable function .",
    "a singular result in this context is the explicit formula for the entanglement of formation of mixed states of two qubits , obtained in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the groverian measure was originally introduced for the case of a single marked state .",
    "recently , it was shown that the same result for @xmath84 is obtained in the case of @xmath11 marked states , up to a correction of order @xmath67 @xcite , thus removing the restriction of a single marked state .",
    "grover s algorithm can be generalized by replacing the hadamard transform by an arbitrary unitary operator @xmath244 on the @xmath2 qubits @xcite . using the generalized algorithm to evaluate @xmath84",
    ", one observes that the same result is obtained as long as the operator @xmath244 is a tensor product of @xmath2 unitary single qubit operators . in case that the operator @xmath244 creates entanglement between the qubits in the register",
    "it can not be used to evaluate the groverian measure .",
    "interestingly , the groverian measure coincides for pure states with the measure proposed by vedral , plenio , rippin and knight @xcite .",
    "while that measure also applies in the case of mixed states of multiple qubits , we have not been able to extend the operational interpretation of the groverian measure beyond the case of pure states @xcite .",
    "it would be interesting to examine the relevance of the groverian measure to other quantum algorithms such as shor s algorithm .",
    "further studies of the groverian measure and related concepts will hopefully contribute to the understanding of the role of entanglement in making quantum algorithms powerful ."
