    "after integrating out all mediator qubits in the perturbative gadgets , we arrived at a first effective hamiltonian @xmath100 describing four - qubit stabilizer operators of the toric code coupled to the fm .",
    "let us now study the interactions between the effective stabilizer operators @xmath13 which are mediated by the ordered heisenberg fm @xmath39 , to which they are coupled over the operators @xmath101 .",

    "the presence of the 3d system is necessary to mediate long - range interactions between the stabilizers .",

    "[ fig : numerics ] .",
    "however , we show below that backaction effects become eventually important for the fm spins _ close _ to the memory .",
    "here we analyze in detail the conditions of validity of our effective theory .    as we discussed in ref .  , the thermal stability of the toric code protected by the effective hamiltonian @xmath40 in eq",
    "is due to the fact that the cost for inverting a stabilizer @xmath13 ( creating an anyon ) grows without bounds as a function of @xmath6 .",
    "indeed , assume that initially all stabilizers have a @xmath168 eigenvalue ( @xmath169 ) .",

    "the assumption @xmath171",
    ". this seems to be in contradiction to the fact that our original hamiltonian @xmath172 is a sum of bounded local terms , such that the energy cost for a local change certainly is bounded and does not grow with system size .",
    "however , in the case where the effective hamiltonian ( [ eq : effectivecoupling ] ) emerges from a system with two - body interactions , it describes the system correctly in the _ long - wavelength _ and _ low - energy limit _ only .",
    "we first note that the schrieffer - wolff transformation employed in the derivation of @xmath40 , followed by tracing out the degrees of freedom of the mediator qubits and the ferromagnet is not a unitary operation .",
    "hence , the spectra of @xmath173 and @xmath40 are , in general , not identical .",
    "they match only in the low - energy sector where @xmath174 leads to bounded results .",
    "indeed , when the quantum memory is in contact with a thermal heat bath at inverse temperature @xmath81 , the expected anyon density ( fraction of stabilizer operators @xmath13 with a @xmath175 value ) is approximately @xmath176 ( cf .",
    "iv in ref .   for a more careful discussion , taking inter - anyonic interactions into account ) .",
    "the thermal energy of the code system is thus @xmath177 which vanishes exponentially as @xmath178 .",
    "the thermal density of anyons is self - consistently suppressed by the effective anyon chemical potential @xmath179 .",
    "the total thermal energy @xmath180 remains thus finite and small even for large @xmath6 .",
    "the fact that @xmath179 diverges as a function of @xmath6 therefore does not invalidate our effective theory when its full effects are taken into account .",
    "the effective description breaks down in the high - temperature limit , @xmath181 , which corresponds to populating high - energetic states with finite probability , _",
    "i.e. _ , the anyon density becomes of order unity .",
    "indeed , in this limit , we get @xmath182 , which is clearly in contradiction with a finite upper bound on the energy density @xmath183 .",
    "this breakdown of the low - energy effective theory is of course not surprising , since in this regime the perturbative gadgets no longer work and the magnon expansion for the fm becomes invalid .",
    "( for @xmath184 , the fraction of excited mediator qubits and the magnon occupation numbers become of order unity . )",
    "thus , our effective long - wave length and low - energy description is self - consistent for sufficiently low temperatures @xmath115 and sufficiently large code sizes @xmath6 .",

    "this is the reason why we introduced the external field @xmath105 ; it stabilizes the fm against the transverse effective magnetic field induced by the toric code and forbids energetically the turning of the total magnetization . however , backaction effects are substantial for the fm spins close to the code and it is interesting to study the dynamics of the fm spins in contact to the toric code .",
