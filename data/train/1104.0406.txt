    "hypersurfaces in @xmath2 of either _ constant scalar curvature _ or _ constant mean curvature _",
    "( including minimal hypersurfaces ) have been extensively studied in the literature . for example , for constant scalar curvature , the pioneering work of cheng",
    " yau  @xcite says that if a hypersurface @xmath3 in @xmath2 has constant scalar curvature which is greater than or equal to @xmath1 and nonnegative sectional curvature , then @xmath3 is either an @xmath4-sphere or a riemannian product of a @xmath5-sphere and an @xmath6-sphere .",
    "they introduced a self - adjoint operator  @xcite which has been used by many other people to study hypersurfaces of constant scalar curvature , under various additional conditions ( see , for example , @xcite ) .    in this paper , we consider hypersurfaces @xmath3 in @xmath2 whose scalar curvature @xmath7 is bounded below by @xmath1 , namely , @xmath8 .",
    "we do _ not _ assume constant scalar curvature nor constant mean curvature .",
    "we would like to prove the rigidity of @xmath3 under certain boundary condition .",
    "first , the boundary condition is necessary to derive rigidity results , because small spheres and their slight perturbation have sufficiently large scalar curvature .",
    "furthermore , the lower bound @xmath1 is critical because , by the gauss equation , @xmath9 implies that @xmath10 .",
    "thus , the mean curvature @xmath11 may change signs locally through the _ geodesic _ points , i.e. , the points where the second fundamental form @xmath12 vanishes . from the analytic aspect , the geometric operators , such as cheng  yau s operator , the linearized scalar curvature operator , and the scalar curvature flow , are no longer globally elliptic nor parabolic . also , these operators are totally degenerate at the geodesic points .",
    "therefore , the theory of maximum principle can not be applied directly .",
    "( we remark that , if one assumes that @xmath3 is contained in the hemisphere and that @xmath3 has constant scalar curvature , then the desired ellipticity automatically holds ; and hence , @xmath3 is a sphere by applying the alexandrov reflection principle ( see korevaar  @xcite ) . )",
    "rather than sticking to these geometric operators , we develop a different approach using some new geometric inequalities , motivated by our recent work  @xcite .",

    "the conjecture states that @xmath3 is isometric to the hemisphere @xmath15 .",
    "there have been many interesting results related to the conjecture .",
    "for example , hang ",
    "wang @xcite proved the conjecture under the condition that , either @xmath16 is conformal to the standard sphere metric , or the ricci curvature satisfies @xmath17 . by assuming positive ricci curvature on @xmath3 and an isoperimetric condition on @xmath13 , eichmair",
