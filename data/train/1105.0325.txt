    "based on the plenty of observational evidences @xcite , in the present time , it is accepted that the universe is undergoing a phase of accelerated expansion due to the presence of an unknown agent namely the  dark energy \" ( de ) .",
    "identifying the origin and nature of this unknown agent has been one of the great challenges in modern theoretical cosmology .",
    "many different approaches have been proposed to solve the de problem .",
    "these approaches can be mainly categorized in two distinct groups .",
    "first group are the modified gravity models which propose some serious modifications to einstein s theory of gravity such as @xmath0 gravity @xcite , scalar - tensor theories @xcite , quintessence model @xcite and so on .",
    "the second category are those support the idea of the existence of a strange type of energy whose gravity is repulsive and consist an un - clustered component through the universe . the first and simplest candidate for de",
    "is the cosmological constant @xmath1 which has constant equation of state ( eos ) parameter @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "although this model has a good agreement with observational data but it suffers several difficulties such as _ fine tuning _ and _ coincidence _ problem @xcite .",
    "further observations detect a small variation in the eos parameter of de in favor of a dynamic de .",
    "these observations show that the eos of de @xmath3 is likely to cross the cosmological constant boundary -1 ( or phantom divide ) , i.e. @xmath3 is larger than @xmath4 in the recent past and less than @xmath4 today @xcite . the conventional scalar - field model , the quintessence with a canonical kinetic term , can only evolve in the region of @xmath5 , whereas the model of phantom with negative kinetic term can always lead to @xmath6 . neither the quintessence nor the phantom alone can realize the transition of @xmath3 from @xmath5 to @xmath7 or vice versa . a comprehensive review on de models can be seen in a very recent paper by m. li , et al .",
    "@xcite .    an interesting model of de , called  ghost dark energy \" ( gde ) was recently proposed @xcite .",
    "the so called  veneziano ghost field \" is presented as a solution to @xmath8 problem in effective low energy @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "the ghost field seems to be un - physical and has no contribution to the vacuum energy in the minkowski spacetime .",
    "however , in a dynamic background or a spacetime with non - trivial topology the ghost field contribute to the vacuum energy proportional to @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the hubble parameter and @xmath12 is @xmath9 mass scale @xcite .",
    "actually the de models based on the ghost field consider this vacuum energy density as a dynamical cosmological constant to investigate its role as an alternative to resolve the de puzzle @xcite .",
    "the ghost de model can also categorized to the class of inhomogeneous fluid de models @xcite .",
    "one of the most important advantages of the ghost de model is that this model comes from the standard model of particle physics and we do not need to introduce any new degree of freedom .    on the other hands ,",
    "the tachyon field has been proposed as a possible candidate for de .",
    "a rolling tachyon has an interesting equation of state whose parameter smoothly interpolates between @xmath4 and @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "thus , tachyon can be realized as a suitable candidate for the inflation at high energy @xcite as well as a source of dark energy depending on the form of the tachyon potential @xcite .",
    "these motivate us to reconstruct tachyon potential @xmath14 from gde model .",
    "the correspondence between tachyon field and various dark energy models such as holographic dark energy @xcite and agegraphic dark energy @xcite has been already established .",
    "the extension has also been done to the entropy corrected holographic and agegraphic dark energy models @xcite .",
    "the effective lagrangian for the tachyon field is given by @xcite @xmath15 where @xmath14 is the tachyon potential .",
    "the corresponding energy momentum tensor for the tachyon field can be written in a perfect fluid form @xmath16 where @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the energy density and pressure of the tachyon , respectively .",
    "the velocity @xmath19 is @xmath20 it was demonstrated that dark energy driven by tachyon , decays to cold dark matter in the late accelerated universe and this phenomenon yields a solution to cosmic coincidence problem @xcite .",
    "choosing different self - interaction potentials in the tachyon field model leads different consequences for the resulted de model .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows .",
    "the next section includes the relations and discussions about the reconstructed tachyon gde model . in section iii",
    "we extend the study to the interacting gde model .",
    "the summary and conclusion are given in section iv .",
    "consider a flat friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) which its dynamics is governed by the friedmann equation @xmath21 where @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the energy densities of pressureless matter and gde , respectively . the ghost energy density is proportional to the hubble parameter @xcite @xmath24 where @xmath25 is a constant of order @xmath26 and @xmath27 is qcd mass scale .",

    "here we have taken @xmath43 ]     for ghost dark energy where again we have taken @xmath44 . ]",
    "next we suggest a correspondence between ghost energy density and tachyon field .",
    "the energy density and pressure of tachyon field are given by @xmath45 @xmath46 thus the equation of state parameter of tachyon field is given by @xmath47 to establish the correspondence between gde and tachyon field , we equate @xmath40 with @xmath48 . from eqs .",

    "unfortunately , the analytical form of the potential in terms of the ghost tachyon field can not be determined due to the complexity of the equations involved .",

    "[ fig3 ] we can see the dynamics of the scalar field explicitly . in this figure",
    "we can see that the scalar field @xmath59 increases from below to zero at the present time which is not similar to other reconstructed models of de .",
    "[ fig4 ] , indicates that the reconstructed scalar potential shows a nonzero minima which reminds the cosmological constant behavior of the model in the present time .",
    "in this section we extend our study to the interacting case .",
    "we shall assume the two dark components namely dark matter and gde interact to each other thus , @xmath60 and @xmath61 do not conserve separately and evolve according to their semi conservation laws @xmath62 where @xmath63 represents the interaction term which can be , in general , an arbitrary function of cosmological parameters like the hubble parameter and energy densities , @xmath64 .",
    "the simplest choice is @xmath65 with @xmath66 is a coupling constant @xcite .",
    "the positive @xmath66 is responsible for the energy transition from dark energy to dark matter .",
    "sometimes this constant is taken in the range @xmath67 $ ] @xcite .",
    "note that if @xmath68 then it represents the non - interacting frw model while @xmath69 yields complete transfer of energy from dark energy to dark matter .",
    "recently , it is reported that this interaction is observed in the abell cluster a586 showing a transition of dark energy into dark matter and vice versa @xcite .",
    "observations of cosmic microwave background and galactic clusters show that the coupling parameter @xmath70 , i.e. a small but positive constant of order unity @xcite , a negative coupling parameter is avoided due to violation of thermodynamical laws . therefore the theoretical interacting models are phenomenologically consistent with the observations .",
    "it should be noted that the ideal interaction term must be motivated from the theory of quantum gravity . in the absence of such a theory ,",
    "we rely on pure dimensional basis for choosing an interaction @xmath63 .",

    "( 24 ) and ( 25 ) at hand , we are in a position to implement a correspondence between interacting ghost energy density and tachyon scalar field model , by comparing the ghost density with the tachyon field model and equating the equation of state parameter of this model with the equation of state parameter of interacting gde obtained in ( [ wd2 ] ) . to this end",

    "settles down in the minima .",
    "the oscillation around the minima for @xmath82-like potentials ( with suitable choice of @xmath66 ) is completely harmonic and can acts as pressureless fluid during the oscillation period of the scalar file as an alternative to cold dark matter .     as a function of redshift for interacting tachyon ghost dark energy and different coupling parameter @xmath66 . ]     for interacting tachyon ghost dark energy and different coupling parameter @xmath66 . ]",

    "a suitable choice of the @xmath11 and @xmath83 leads to right value of @xmath84 .",
    "the advantages of this new proposal compared to the previous dark energy models is that it totally embedded in standard model so that one does not need to introduce any new parameter , new degree of freedom or to modify general relativity .    on the other hand , we know that the scalar field models of dark energy can be considered as an effective theory of the underlying theory of dark energy .",
    "this point motivated us to reconstruct the tachyon model of dark energy based on the ghost energy density . to this end , we have constructed a version of tachyon dark energy which mimics the behavior of the ghost model of dark energy in the early epoches and late time .",
    "different quantities are plotted and evolution of the model is shown in different epoches . due to importance of correspondence between these models ( gde and tachyon )",
