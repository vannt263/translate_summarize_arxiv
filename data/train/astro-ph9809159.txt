    "the abundance of virialised clusters and groups of galaxies can provide a sensitive probe of the amplitude of density fluctuations on different scales and , hence , can be used to determine cosmological parameters .",
    "this requires , however , a theoretical framework for relating observable quantities such as the x - ray luminosity ( l ) and temperature ( t ) of the intra - cluster or intra - group medium ( hereafter referred to as the icm in both cases , for simplicity ) to the total mass of the structure .",
    "the most commonly applied model assumes that the gas has been shock heated to the virial temperature of the isothermal mass .",
    "this results in a scaling relation @xmath2 @xcite , which does not match the observed relation for clusters , ( approximately @xmath3 @xcite ) or that of groups , which may be even steeper @xcite .",
    "it is also true that the @xmath4 scaling does not _ require _ isothermal gas ; we develop such a model in appendix [ sec - appendix ] .",
    "it was originally shown by kaiser ( 1991 ) that , if the gas was pre - heated ( for example by supernova explosions ) before falling into the dark matter potential , the observed cluster l ",
    "t relation can be more accurately reproduced . assuming adiabatic collapse under these conditions , kaiser s self - similar model predicts @xmath5 . however , in this case , the radial extent of the gas depends strongly on the size of the potential ; for low mass groups , the gas will extend well beyond the virial radius and , for high mass clusters , it will be concentrated in the centre .",
    "this may result in unreasonable gas mass fractions within the virial radius .",
    "other authors have attempted variations on the self - similar model .",
    "bower ( 1994 ) explored arbitrary scaling relations of the form @xmath6 , where s and p are free parameters , in an attempt to reduce the predicted evolution of the x - ray luminosity function .",
    "a special case of this treatment is the model of evrard & henry ( 1991 ) , which yields the relation @xmath7 .",
    "both of these models are based on the assumption that the core gas possesses a minimum entropy , the value of which is determined by the entropy of the initially pre - heated gas . outside this core , it is assumed that the gas is distributed isothermally",
    ". however , the physical reality of a gas core has not yet been demonstrated , and the assumption of a largely isothermal profile may not be supported by observations @xcite . furthermore , as noted by ponman et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , this relation , when extrapolated to lower mass scales , does not fit the x - ray data of galaxy groups .    recently , cavaliere , menci & tozzi ( 1997 ; 1998 ) , have constructed a model in which the observed l  t relation on both cluster and group scales can be reproduced by varying the gas density at the virial radius , according to the accretion - shock strength , as determined by the temperature difference between the infalling and virialised gases . in the present work ,",
    "we explore the case in which pre - heated gas is assumed to collapse adiabatically , with the effect of shocks neglected .",
    "this is somewhat similar to the model of cavaliere et al . on group scales , where shocks are expected to be weak , although we put physical constraints on the total gas mass within virialised haloes and do not require an isothermal distribution .",
    "the paper is organised as follows . in   [ sec - theory ] , our cosmological and structure formation parameters are defined .",
    "the specific models for the gas distributions are presented in   [ sec - models ] : in particular the isothermal model in   [ sec - isothermal ] and the isentropic model in   [ sec - adiabat ] .",
    "the luminosity  temperature  mass relations and the temperature / luminosity functions are presented in   [ sec - results ] . the models are discussed in terms of their evolutionary predictions , energy requirements and failures in   [ sec - discuss ] .",

    "we will restrict our analysis in the present work to two simple cosmologies : a standard cold dark matter ( cdm ) model with @xmath8 , @xmath9 , and an open model with @xmath10 , @xmath11 .",
    "the values of @xmath12 are chosen so that the age of the universe is equal to about 13 gyr in both models .",
    "unless otherwise specified , the baryon fraction of the universe , @xmath13 , will be given by the big bang nucleosynthesis value @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "a simple function is fit to the @xmath15 variance of mass fluctuations , @xmath16 , from the cdm power spectrum @xcite for the two cosmological models : @xmath17 where the normalisation of the power spectrum is determined by the constant @xmath18 , and @xmath19 is the mass within an @xmath20 mpc sphere , with @xmath21 representing the critical density at @xmath15 .",

    "is related to the shape and the depth of the gravitational potential , with the latter depending on the epoch of halo formation ; haloes of a given mass that form at an earlier epoch are denser , and more compact .",
    "this effect has often been neglected in the past , but has been treated recently by kitayama & suto ( 1996a , 1996b ) .",
    "numerical simulations @xcite suggest that the depth of the potential well , as traced by the circular velocity @xmath31 , remains relatively unchanged after 75 per cent of the cluster mass is in place , since the rest will be accreted in minor merger events that do not significantly disrupt the mass already in place .",
    "thus motivated , we will define the redshift of halo formation as the redshift at which 75 per cent of the mass has been assembled ; the x - ray temperature of the gas corresponding to a halo of mass @xmath32 at the epoch of observation will then be determined by the circular velocity of that halo when its mass was equal to @xmath33 .",
    "we will assume that both gas and dark matter components of merging haloes mix thoroughly and that the mixed gas immediately settles into hydrostatic equilibrium after a merger event .",

    "the distribution of formation times , assuming f=0.75 , is shown in figure [ fig - pz ] for three representative mass scales at the present epoch , in both cosmological models .",
    "lower mass haloes have a broader distribution of formation epochs , and haloes in the low density universe model form at earlier times , on average , than those in the critical density model .",

    "a simple model of this type is described by evrard & henry ( 1991 ) , and is represented by @xmath180 when normalised to the cluster data .",
    "this model is shown here as the straight , solid line , which our isentropic model approaches asymptotically .",
    "the evrard & henry model matches the slope of the cluster data quite well , but underpredicts the temperature of most groups and the lowest mass clusters .",
    "it has been shown @xcite that the dispersion in the l ",
    "t relation can be reduced to a very small value ( an r.m.s .",
    "dispersion of about 0.11 in log l at a given t ) by excluding cooling flow regions from the observed x - ray data .",
    "the predicted ( @xmath162 ) range in log l for a given t for high mass clusters under the assumptions of the isothermal model , due to the distribution of halo formation times , is 0.07 - 0.14 , consistent with this data ( though , of course , the slope is wrong ) .",
    "the isentropic model predicts a larger range of about 0.3 for low luminosity clusters and groups , and this range encompasses most of the group data shown in figure [ fig - lt ] .",
    "this suggests that the observed dispersion in the l ",
    "t relation may be primarily due to the distribution of halo formation times .",
    "the mass derived from the x - ray temperature of group - scale structures is strongly dependent on the thermal history of the gas , as shown in figure [ fig - mt ] , where the mass  temperature relation is plotted for the isothermal and isentropic models ; as in figure [ fig - lt ] , the hatched region represents the dispersion in the relation due to the distribution of halo formation times . at low masses , @xmath181 ,",
    "the gas mass corresponding to a given temperature is about an order of magnitude smaller in the isentropic model than in the isothermal model : the mass of haloes with @xmath182 kev will be greatly overestimated by assuming the gas has been accretion - shocked to the virial temperature .",
    "furthermore , the dispersion of the m ",
    "t relation is significantly larger in the isentropic model ; thus it will be difficult to determine the mass of individual , low temperature structures to better than a factor of ten or so from the x - ray observations alone . in the isothermal case , for high temperature clusters ,",
    "the relation is much tighter , and the mass corresponding to a given temperature can be determined to within a factor of two .",
    "the most readily observable , independent parameter related to the halo mass is the line of sight velocity dispersion , @xmath183 .",
    "assuming isotropic orbits , we use the relation @xmath184 to compare our model predictions with observations .",
    "we show , in figure [ fig - tsig ] , the relation between @xmath183 and gas temperature predicted by the isothermal and isentropic models for @xmath10 .",
    "the group data plotted are the same as in figure [ fig - lt ] ; velocity dispersions for the mulchaey & zabludoff ( 1998 ) are taken from zabludoff & mulchaey ( 1998 ) . for the cluster data , velocity dispersions (",
    "not available for all of the data ) are taken from fadda et al .",
    "( 1996 ) and various sources within the compilation of white et al .",
    "( 1997 ) . in the rare cases where uncertainties are not quoted ,",
    "we assume 20% errors .",
    "the lowest temperature group data generally lie well below the isothermal model prediction ; however , there is a great deal of scatter , and insufficient data below @xmath185 kev to provide a convincing test of our isentropic model prediction .",
    "furthermore , even the massive cluster data tend to lie toward higher temperatures at a given @xmath183 , which may indicate that the galaxy orbits are not exactly isotropic .",
    "the most discrepant point is the cluster awm4 , which seems to have an unusually low velocity dispersion of 119 km / s ( fadda et al . 1996 ) for its temperature of 3.7 kev .",
    "nonetheless , the data suggest a strong drop in @xmath183 , relative to the isothermal model , for haloes with temperatures below about 0.8 kev , in accord with our isentropic model .",
    "the notable exception to this trend is hcg 15 , which has kt=0.44 kev and @xmath183=457 km s@xmath169 ( ponman et al .",
    "( 1996 ) .",
    "the difference between the isothermal and isentropic models in figures [ fig - mt ] and [ fig - tsig ] is somewhat sensitive to the mass accretion rate @xmath186 we have assumed in equation [ eqn - abr ]",
    ". a lower accretion rate ( i.e. @xmath187 ) will preserve the slope of the m ",
    "t relation , while altering the normalisation , as the total gas mass within a halo of a given mass will be lower than we have assumed here . in this case , the temperature will drop .",
    "our choice of @xmath132 is the critical value determined by bondi ( 1951 ) for the case of spherical , adiabatic accretion by a point source ; we are currently exploring a more realistic accretion model , and indications are that the proper @xmath186 may be somewhat lower than we have used here .",
    "the cumulative temperature functions for the two models are shown in figure [ fig - n > t ] .",
    "the @xmath8 cosmology is shown in the top panel , and the @xmath10 results in the bottom panel .",
    "the @xmath15 model is shown as the solid line , and the dashed lines represent the results at redshifts of 0.3 and 0.5 .",

    "this data consists of the 25 x - ray brightest clusters in the _",

    "the _ r.m.s . _ mass fluctuation in spheres of size @xmath20 mpc , @xmath189 , is determined by requiring the cumulative temperature function at z=0 to match the observations at @xmath190 kev , where the errors are smallest . for the isothermal model , @xmath191 for @xmath10 , and @xmath192 for @xmath8 .",
    "these values are lower than those found by eke et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , primarily as a result of including the distribution of formation times . neglecting this ( i.e. , assuming each cluster formed at the redshift at which it is observed ) overestimates @xmath189 by 1020 per cent , depending on cosmology ( a larger effect for @xmath10 ) .",
    "the effects of using a slightly different point of normalisation and mass  temperature relation are much weaker , affecting the results by about 1 per cent .",
    "the isentropic model is shown in figure [ fig - n > t ] for the same three redshifts . for this model , @xmath189",
    "can not be calculated in the same way , as the model breaks down for temperatures greater than 12 kev , so the values determined above for the isothermal model are used . in this case , evolution is mildly _ positive _ ; i.e. , there are more objects of a given temperature at z=0.5 than at z=0 , by a small amount that is roughly independent of cosmology .",
    "relative to the isothermal temperature function , the isentropic model predicts about ten times more objects with temperatures less than 1 kev .",
    "this is also evident from figure [ fig - mt ] : the masses of haloes with a given x - ray temperature are much smaller in the isentropic model , and less massive objects are more numerous .",
    "although temperature data do not yet exist for a complete sample in the low mass regime , a differential luminosity function is available from the _ rosat _ deep cluster survey ( rdcs , rosati et al .",
    "1998 ) to luminosities as low as @xmath193 ergs s@xmath169 .",
    "we correct these 0.52 kev band luminosities to bolometric luminosities by dividing them by the factor @xmath194 , where the temperature is estimated from the evrard & henry ( 1991 ) relation shown in figure [ fig - lt ] .",
    "the lowest redshift data from the rdcs ( @xmath195 ) are shown as the open squares in figure [ fig - ldif ] ; the solid squares plotted on this figure are from henry & arnaud ( 1991 ) .",
    "the isothermal and isentropic models are shown for both cosmologies .",
    "for each model , the solid line is the @xmath15 model , while the dashed lines represent the results at @xmath196 and @xmath197 ; very little evolution is exhibited in either cosmology by either model .",
    "this is consistent with the rdcs survey results , which show no evolution of the luminosity function out to z=0.8 .",
    "the slope of the luminosity function corresponding to the isothermal model is too steep to match the data in the high luminosity regime , especially for the @xmath198 cosmology .",
    "as discussed earlier , the normalisation difference between the models and the data is mostly sensitive to @xmath12 .",
    "the flattening of this slope at low luminosities is due to the fact that we do not include haloes in which the gas has had sufficient time to cool since the formation of the halo ; efficient cooling in low mass objects restricts luminosities to those greater than about @xmath168 ergs s@xmath169 .    the isentropic model , on the other hand , reproduces the flat slope ( @xmath199 ) of the rdcs data well , though the normalisation is too high .",
    "however , the major success of the l ",
    "t relation predicted by this model occurs at luminosities lower than those probed by the rdcs ( @xmath200 ergs s@xmath169 ) where the gas mass fraction is proportional to the total mass (   [ sec - adiabat ] ) .",
    "we predict that the slope of the luminosity function in this mass range will flatten to @xmath201 .",
    "recently , henry ( 1997 ) published a detection of mild negative evolution of the cluster temperature function out to z=0.3 , particularly at the hot end , @xmath202 kev .",
    "this is marginally inconsistent with the isothermal model in both cosmologies in figure [ fig - n > t ] , as the @xmath10 temperature function shows too little evolution , while the evolution predicted by the @xmath8 model is too strong .",
    "for this reason , henry ( 1997 ) claims @xmath203 fits the data best , but there are few points and the error bars are large .",
    "the isentropic model predicts very little evolution in both cosmological models , but it is only valid at low temperatures for which there is currently no data . since the redshift evolution in this case has such a weak cosmological dependence , estimations of cosmological parameters from x - ray abundances will best be made from the number evolution of the most massive clusters , and not from the abundance of lower mass clusters and groups .",
    "it is still important , however , to firmly establish the thermal history of the icm before observed evolution in x - ray luminosity or temperature can be used to determine cosmological parameters .    the direction of evolution of the l ",
    "t relation , shown in figure [ fig - ltz ] , depends on the gas physics involved . in the isentropic model , clusters of a given temperature",
    "are significantly less luminous at z=0.5 than they are at z=0 , whereas , in the isothermal case , they are somewhat more luminous .",
    "the work of henry ( 1997 ) shows little or no evolution in the l ",
    "t relation for @xmath204 kev , in confirmation of earlier work @xcite .",
    "the prediction of moderate evolution in the isothermal model was part of the impetus for considering models with pre - heated gas @xcite ; unfortunately , again , our isentropic model is not valid at these temperatures .",
    "since errors in temperature tend to dominate observations , it is unlikely that the predicted evolution of the l ",
    "t relation on group scales will be easily observed .",
    "many observations have suggested that the contribution of x - ray gas to the total mass in galaxy clusters is 1020 per cent , significantly larger than the big bang nucleosynthesis value assumed here @xcite .",
    "increasing the baryon density of the universe allows the application of our isentropic model to more massive haloes , as the limits in equations [ eqn - vcrit ] and [ eqn - vmax ] are increased .",
    "we explore , in figure [ fig - lt_hib ] , the luminosity  temperature relation assuming @xmath205 .",
    "( below our critical mass , equation [ eqn - vcrit ] , the gas mass fraction is still given by equation [ eqn - bondi ] and , hence , less than @xmath205 , in qualitative accord with observations @xcite ) .",
    "this requires a slight modification of the entropy constant to @xmath206 for @xmath8 and @xmath207 for @xmath10 .",
    "the improvement of the fit to the data is quite noticeable in the @xmath8 case , and is due primarily to the increase of the upper mass limit at which the gas fraction reaches @xmath208 .",
    "= 8.4 cm    the isentropic model requires that the infalling gas have an initial entropy given by @xmath209 .",
    "this is consistent , with about 1@xmath188 confidence , with the observed value recently published by ponman , cannon , navarro ( 1998 ) , @xmath210 . to generate",
    "this entropy requires some mechanism for heating the gas ( at the turnaround time ) from the background temperature of @xmath211 k to about @xmath212 k ( see   [ sec - lt ] ) ; the energy required to heat a total mass of gas @xmath213 from @xmath214 k to this temperature is @xmath215 ergs .",
    "if the amount of energy of a single sn event is about @xmath216 ergs , 10 per cent of this is converted into thermal energy of the hot gas @xcite , and the mass in stars is about 10 percent of the mass in gas , @xcite , this requires a sn rate of @xmath217 events in the lifetime of a galaxy with stellar mass @xmath218 . over the likely timescales of galaxy formation ,",
    "this is probably an unreasonably high rate .",
    "both models explored here fail to reproduce the temperature function , luminosity function and l ",
    "t relation for the majority of massive clusters .",
    "this mass range is successfully described in some aspects by the model of evrard & henry ( 1991 ) , in which only the core gas retains its initial entropy , and the possibility of mergers stirring up and mixing the gas is ignored . an alternative model which may be at least equally successful",
    "is one in which the gas is more thoroughly mixed , and behaves like a polytrope with @xmath95 varying from 5/3 on group scales to 1.11.2 on cluster scales , and approaching unity as the systems grow increasingly massive .",
    "such a model has been postulated as an explanation of numerical simulation results ( lewis et al .",
    ", in preparation ) , observed temperature gradients @xcite and the discrepancy between x - ray determined masses and those obtained from lensing observations @xcite .",
    "we are currently exploring the predictions of such a model under the present formalism .",
    "two extreme models of hot intra - cluster and intra - group gas have been considered in detail . in the first model ,",
    "the gas is distributed isothermally at the virial temperature of the mass . in the isentropic model , the adiabatic collapse of pre - heated gas onto an isothermal potential",
    "is considered , with the gas content of the halo constrained by the physics of adiabatic bondi accretion . in both models",
    "we incorporate the lacey & cole ( 1993 ; 1994 ) distribution of halo formation times , and also the contribution of recombination radiation to the gas temperature and luminosity .",
    "the important conclusions are the following :    * neglecting the distribution of halo formation times leads to a 1020 per cent overestimate of the normalisation parameter @xmath189 * neglecting the contribution from recombination radiation has a significant effect on the slope of the luminosity  temperature relation , for @xmath67 kev .",
    "* in the isentropic model , we assume the entropy of the pre - infall gas has been increased by some , unspecified mechanism . for haloes with x - ray gas temperatures @xmath219 kev ,",
    "the luminosity  temperature relation in this model is @xmath175 .",
    "both the slope and dispersion ( due to the distribution of formation times ) of this model are a good match to the available x - ray observations .",
    "the fit is improved , especially for @xmath8 , if we assume a baryon fraction of @xmath205 . *",
    "the isentropic model predicts that the gas temperature in haloes with @xmath220 will be significantly higher than the virial temperature ; thus , making the assumption that the gas is at @xmath75 will lead to an overestimation of the mass by more than an order of magnitude .",
    "this discrepancy can be reduced somewhat if the gas accretion rate is lower than the critical adiabatic bondi rate we have assumed here ; however , we still predict that the gas fraction will increase proportionally to the halo mass in this regime . *",
    "the amount of heating required at @xmath221 in the isentropic model is equivalent to heating halo gas at the turnaround epoch to @xmath212 k for @xmath8 and @xmath222 k for @xmath10 . *",
    "the slope of the observed luminosity function is well matched by the isentropic model for @xmath223 ergs s@xmath169 * the isentropic model fails for more massive clusters , where the gas entropy becomes increasingly dominated by shocks .    as better x - ray observations become available for less luminous , cooler groups of galaxies , the observed slope of the l ",

    "mlb is also supported by an nserc postgraduate scholarship .      in this appendix we will discuss two different models in which pre - heated gas collapses adiabatically .",
    "we will make two assumptions about the behaviour of @xmath125 and @xmath96 that are different from those which we make for our isentropic model , discussed in   [ sec - adiabat ] . in both cases , we assume that @xmath127 , as in the isothermal model .    first , we can assume that @xmath96 is a universal constant , independent of halo mass .",
    "then , from equations [ eqn - a ] and [ eqn - mratios ] , the ratio of gas to dark matter mass within @xmath49 will vary strongly with @xmath31 , in the sense that more massive clusters will have smaller gas fractions .",
    "the gas mass fraction in this case would vary by two orders of magnitude between haloes with @xmath225 km s@xmath169 and those with @xmath226 km s@xmath169 .",
    "however , both observations and theory suggest that the baryon fraction in clusters may be greater than the universal mean , but do not deviate from this value by more than a factor of a few @xcite .",
    "thus , we reject this model as improbable on physical grounds .    alternatively",
    ", we can constrain the ratio of gas mass to dark matter mass to be a constant equal to the universal value , @xmath227 . then from equation [ eqn - mratios ] , a=1.03 is independent of mass and @xmath35 , which requires the entropy constant to scale as @xmath228 ( from equation [ eqn - a ] ) .",
    "the entropy of the gas will still be constant for any given cluster , but will be higher for larger haloes ; this requires a mechanism for pre - heating the gas that is more efficient for more massive haloes . in this case , since the parameter a is constant , @xmath229 from equations [ eqn - to ] and [ eqn - totem ] and , thus , the isothermal mass  temperature relation ( @xmath230 , equation [ eqn - mtiso ] ) still holds , apart from the normalisation .",
    "furthermore , from equation [ eqn - alum ] , recalling that @xmath228 , it holds that @xmath231 when bremsstrahlung radiation is the dominant emission mechanism and @xmath232 when recombination radiation dominates ; consequently , @xmath4 and @xmath233 for the two cases , respectively .",
    "interestingly , the above scaling relations are exactly the same as those derived in the isothermal case (   [ sec - isothermal ] ) .",
    "the relationships are _ not unique _ to the isothermal model .",
