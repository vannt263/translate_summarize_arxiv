    "note that for the al / bi set , the direction of the stark shift must be such that the @xmath51 transition frequency , already reduced by a relatively small @xmath136 to lift the multiplet degeneracy , is further reduced to avoid exciting the higher frequency multiplet transitions . in this detuned qubit control regime ,",

    "<S> we report on the challenges and limitations of direct coupling of the magnetic field from a circuit resonator to an electron spin bound to a donor potential . </S>",
    "<S> we propose a device consisting of a lumped - element superconducting resonator and a single donor implanted in enriched @xmath0si . </S>",
    "<S> the resonator , in contrast to coplanar waveguide resonators , includes a nano - scale spiral inductor to spatially focus the magnetic field from the photons within . </S>",
    "<S> the design promises approximately two orders of magnitude increase in the local magnetic field , and thus the spin to photon coupling rate @xmath1 , compared to the estimated coupling rate to coplanar transmission - line resonators . </S>",
    "<S> we show that by using niobium ( aluminum ) as the resonator s superconductor and a single phosphorous ( bismuth ) atom as the donor , a coupling rate of @xmath2=0.24 mhz ( 0.39 mhz ) can be achieved in the small photon limit . for this truly linear cavity quantum electrodynamic system , </S>",
    "<S> such enhancement in @xmath1 is sufficient to enter the strong coupling regime .    </S>",
    "<S> silicon - based spin qubits , including gate - defined quantum dot @xcite and single - atom @xcite devices , use the spin degree of freedom to store and process quantum information , and are promising candidates for future quantum electronic circuits . </S>",
    "<S> the electronic or nuclear spin is well decoupled from the noisy environment , resulting in extremely long coherence times @xcite desirable for fault - tolerant quantum computing . </S>",
    "<S> single - atom spin qubits offer additional advantages over quantum dot qubits such as longer coherence due to strong confinement potentials , and are expected to have better reproducibility by nature . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , it is no surprise that silicon - based single - atom spin qubits hold the record coherence times of any solid state single qubit @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , this attractive isolation from sources of decoherence comes at the price of relatively poor coupling to the control and readout units . </S>",
    "<S> this causes relatively long qubit initialization times , degraded readout fidelity , and weak spin - spin coupling for multi - qubit gate operations @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> one simple way to increase the coupling rate is to increase the ac field from the external circuit . in this </S>",
    "<S> regard , superconducting circuit resonators are attractive due to their relatively large quality factors , ease of coupling to other circuits , their capability of generating ac fields by carrying relatively large currents and monolithic integration with semiconductor devices .    for many years , superconducting microwave resonators have had extensive applications that range from superconducting qubit manipulation @xcite and inter - qubit coupling @xcite to dielectric characterization @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> one of the most commonly used superconducting quantum computing architectures is one based on cavity quantum electrodynamics ( cqed ) @xcite , in which a 2d ( circuit based ) or 3d cavity is employed to initialize , manipulate and readout the superconducting qubit . </S>",
    "<S> superconducting circuit cavities have not yet found a similar prevalence in spin qubit circuits due to the fact that the magnetic field of a typical superconducting resonator and the spin magnetic moment are relatively small , leading to an insufficient spin - photon coupling strength for practical purposes .    </S>",
    "<S> several methods have been proposed to enhance the coupling of a single spin to a photon within a superconducting circuit resonator . </S>",
    "<S> it is easier to couple a photon to quantum dot spin qubits than to single - atom spins because in the former , the spin dynamics can be translated into an electric dipole interacting with resonator s electric field @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> such architectures , however , require hybridization of the spin states with charge states , imposing charge noise on the spin and thus affecting its coherence . on the other hand , direct magnetic coupling of coplanar transmission - line resonators to donor electrons in silicon @xcite and diamond nitrogen - vacancy centers @xcite can only achieve a maximum single - spin coupling rate of a few khz . </S>",
    "<S> this relatively weak coupling makes practical spin qubit initialization , manipulation and readout very challenging . for the single - atom spin qubits , indirect coupling to a resonator via superconducting qubits @xcite can enhance the coupling , but imposes nonlinearity on the circuit complicating cqed analysis , and also introduces loss from josephson junction tunnel barriers @xcite and magnetic flux noise @xcite .        in this paper , we show that replacing the coplanar resonator with a lumped - element circuit resonator that includes a spiral inductor , can lead to a dramatic enhancement in the spin - photon magnetic coupling rate @xmath1 of approximately two orders of magnitude . as we will discuss , this improvement is a result of employing a lumped - element trilayer design along with nano - scale spiral loops which effectively localize the resonator s magnetic field at the location of the spin , eliminating the need for an oersted line @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we also show that this coupling rate is enough to take the spin - resonator hybrid system to the strong coupling regime , where @xmath1 is larger than or approximately equal to the resonator decay rate @xmath3 . due to the relatively small total inductance @xmath4 in this device , </S>",
    "<S> coplanar interdigitated capacitances are insufficient to achieve the desired operation frequency @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the proposed device geometry , compatible with standard micro- and nanofabrication techniques , includes a trilayer ( parallel - plate ) capacitor with a deposited insulating layer . </S>",
    "<S> trilayer capacitors , however , give rise to a lower resonator @xmath6 than that of a typical coplanar geometry . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , as our calculations show , the increase in @xmath1 resulted from employing a trilayer lumped - element design is large enough to overcome the limited @xmath6 , allowing for strong spin - photon coupling .    </S>",
    "<S> the lossless dynamics of a spin-@xmath7 system with spin transition frequency @xmath8 coupled with rate @xmath1 to a cavity resonant at @xmath9 , is described by the jaynes - cummings hamiltonian , @xmath10 @xcite . here , </S>",
    "<S> @xmath11 and @xmath12 are photon and spin operators , respectively . </S>",

    "<S> finally , the spin rotation speed can be enhanced with a larger local rms magnetic field @xmath20 for any arbitrary @xmath21 .    </S>",
    "<S> the schematic and layout of the proposed circuit are shown in figs . </S>",
    "<S> [ layout](a ) and [ layout](b ) , respectively , where a lc resonator is capacitively coupled to a coplanar waveguide ( cpw ) and the donor is within the resonator s deliberate inductor . </S>",
    "<S> the capacitance is provided using a trilayer capacitor . </S>",
    "<S> the rms current through the inductor at an average photon number @xmath22 on resonance is @xmath23 , where @xmath9 is the resonance frequency and @xmath4 denotes the total inductance within the resonator circuit . </S>",
    "<S> since the desired ac magnetic field from the loop(s ) is proportional to @xmath24 , it is clear that the inductance must be minimized and photon frequency must be maximized for the maximum magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , it is necessary to study the sources of inductance and obtain operation frequency limitations .    </S>",
    "<S> the total inductance within the resonator circuit is obtained as @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the geometric inductance of the spiral inductor and is the only inductance within the circuit that gives rise to the rms magnetic field @xmath27 localized at the spin . </S>",
    "<S> the parasitic inductance @xmath28 arises from the kinetic inductance , coupling inductance , self - inductance of the capacitor , inductance of the uncovered areas of the capacitor plates and the kinetic inductance within the capacitor plates . </S>",
    "<S> since @xmath28 does not create any magnetic fields at the location of the spin and only limits @xmath24 through @xmath4 , we want to minimize it . for a better understanding of the dependence of @xmath1 on the number @xmath29 of the spiral loops </S>",
    "<S> , a naive picture may be helpful to the reader . </S>",
    "<S> to the first order for @xmath30 , @xmath31 , and @xmath32 , and @xmath33 , but @xmath28 is a weaker function of @xmath29 than @xmath26 . </S>",
    "<S> this suggest that by increasing @xmath29 , @xmath34 and hence @xmath1 increase up to a point where @xmath26 approaches @xmath28 , and @xmath24 begins to drop as @xmath35 , with @xmath36 . employing a lumped element design provides the required flexibility to reach this optimum @xmath26 and the corresponding @xmath29 . in order to obtain an accurate estimation of @xmath26 and @xmath28 </S>",
    "<S> , we performed calculations as well as software simulations . </S>",
    "<S> the details of our analysis is included in the supplementary material . </S>",

    "<S> these splittings arise from the strong hyperfine interaction between the electron ( @xmath46 ) and bi nuclear spin ( @xmath47 ) @xcite , leading to a total spin @xmath48 and its projection @xmath49 along @xmath50 . by employing the @xmath51 transition corresponding to the largest @xmath52 matrix element ( 0.47 ) , and a static magnetic field of @xmath53 mt </S>",
    "<S> , the multiplet degeneracy at @xmath54 is lifted by more than 20 mhz , enough to decouple the nearby transitions @xcite .    </S>",

    "<S> @xmath62 where @xmath63 is defined as a characteristic radius which accounts for the spin location with respect to the center of the loops and @xmath64 denotes the spin displacement from this center ( see figs . </S>",
    "<S> [ layout](c)-(d ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> note that the assumption of current flowing in the center of the spiral conductor underestimates @xmath27 , @xmath34 and @xmath1 , because in reality the majority of current will flow closer to the superconductor - silicon interface due to the relatively large electric permittivity ( @xmath65 ) of silicon .    </S>",
    "<S> increasing @xmath29 from 1 to 2 increases @xmath34 , but , for @xmath66 , the competing effect of larger @xmath4 and @xmath67 suppresses @xmath24 and lowers @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> this effect is clearly demonstrated in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ plots](c ) as the optimum @xmath37 for all four configurations , where the vacuum fluctuation s coupling rates for the al / bi-2s and nb / p-2s configurations are obtained as @xmath68 mhz and 0.24 mhz , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> to the knowledge of the authors , these values are approximately two orders of magnitude larger than a previously proposed architecture @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> as we will discuss in the remainder of this paper , this new regime of @xmath1 can lead to significant improvements in spin qubit manipulation rates and readout fidelities , and potentially enables new experiments such as individual spin spectroscopy .    from the experimental point of view , </S>",
    "<S> a relatively simple first step is to implant one ( or a few ) donors inside the spiral and measure the spectrum in the small photon limit while the electron spin transitions are tuned across the resonator bandwidth . </S>",
    "<S> the advantage of incorporating @xmath69 spins is that the collective coupling rate @xmath70 @xcite yields more clear spin - resonator interaction features in the spectra for the first iteration of the device , as observed in other two - level system ensembles @xcite . in our proposed device , tuning of the spin(s ) </S>",
    "<S> can be performed using magnetic ( zeeman ) or electric ( stark , see fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ layout ] ) fields , or a combination of both . </S>",
    "<S> the spectroscopy measurement can serve as a simple proof for entering the strong coupling regime . furthermore , using the spectra and a theoretical model @xcite based on the jaynes - cummings model , the spin - resonator coupling rate , spin coherence time and the resonator decay rate , as well as the spin electric field and magnetic field tunability can be extracted .    </S>",
    "<S> the condition for the system to enter the strong coupling regime in the small photon limit is @xmath71 , where @xmath72 and @xmath3 are resonator s total quality factor and total photon decay rate , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> thanks to the relatively large spin - photon coupling rate , resonator @xmath6 s in the range of @xmath73s are enough to take the system to the strong coupling regime for all four configurations ( see fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ plots](d ) ) . in general , in the limit of low drive power and low temperature , trilayer resonators are significantly lossier than the coplanar resonators due to the fact that almost all the photon electric energy is stored within the parallel - plate capacitor dielectric containing defects . </S>",
    "<S> these defects act as lossy two - level fluctuators at small powers and low temperatures , and limit the resonator @xmath6 @xcite . however , loss tangents as small as @xmath74 have been measured for deposited amorphous hydrogenated silicon ( a - si : h ) at single photon energies @xcite promising resonator @xmath6 s of approximately @xmath75 . </S>",
    "<S> more recently , elastic measurements have indicated the absence of tunneling states in a hydrogen - free amorphous silicon film suggesting the possibility of depositing `` perfect '' silicon @xcite , promising even higher @xmath6 trilayer resonators using silicon as capacitor dielectric . </S>",
    "<S> note that amorphous or polycrystalline si , which have similar permittivities to crystalline si , will only have to serve the purpose of confining electric field to avoid a large capacitor , and it is strongly preferred to implant the donor within the crystalline @xmath0si to avoid fast decoherence @xcite . from the fabrication point of view , it is easiest to use the same @xmath0si film as the capacitor dielectric which , in general , will be in the polycrystalline form when deposited on the bottom capacitor plate ( see fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ layout](c - d ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> it is noteworthy that using a trilayer design makes the resonator quality factor @xmath6 independent from the surrounding material as almost all the electric field is confined within the capacitor dielectric . </S>",
    "<S> this is useful for the integration of single electron devices that require lossy oxide layers .    </S>",
    "<S> we next briefly report the major single qubit gate operation parameters for the nb / p-2s configuration ( details of parameter derivations and qubit operation are included in the supplementary material ) . </S>",
    "<S> we can rapidly initialize by using the purcell - limited zero - detuning relaxation time of @xmath76s , many orders of magnitude shorter than the free spin relaxation . </S>",
    "<S> effective initialization of spin systems using resonator coupling has been previously observed @xcite , and the 2-order of magnitude increase in @xmath1 in our device promises a much faster initialization . for spin manipulation , </S>",
    "<S> we operate in a detuned regime , where the rotation speed with the maximum possible drive power is @xmath77 mhz , corresponding to @xmath78 coherent @xmath79-rotations . in this regime </S>",
    "<S> , the spiral inductor s current density stays below @xmath80 , similar to fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ plots](b ) . for the spin readout , </S>",
    "<S> also performed in the detuned regime , a @xmath81 transmission phase difference depending on the spin state can be achieved . </S>",
    "<S> this phase difference is well above the measurement sensitivity usually considered to be @xmath82 , and suggests an extremely high - fidelity readout .    in summary , </S>",
    "<S> we have proposed and designed a novel device that enhances the coupling of a single atom spin to the magnetic field of a circuit resonator by approximately 100 times compared to the previously proposed architectures that use coplanar transmission line resonators . </S>",
    "<S> this dramatic improvement is a result of using a lumped element resonator design and a spiral inductor geometry . </S>",
    "<S> we showed the possibility of entering the strong coupling regime necessary for practical purposes , _ </S>",
    "<S> i.e. _ , spectroscopic measurements and qubit realization . using the principles of cavity quantum electrodynamics </S>",
    "<S> , we showed that this large @xmath1 can lead to a significantly enhanced spin relaxation rate desired for qubit initialization , tens of megahertz spin rotation speed during manipulation without the need for an oersted line , and superb dispersive readout sensitivity . </S>",
