    "globular cluster spectra provide an excellent means to study the kinematics and metallicities of old stellar populations , and to probe the mass distributions of their parent galaxies ( see brodie 1993 and zepf 1995 for recent reviews ) .",
    "globular clusters and planetary nebulae ( pne ) bridge the gap between the inner regions of ellipticals and early - type spirals , where masses and m / l ratios can be determined from rotation curve work or integrated light techniques , and the outermost regions which can be studied via x - ray emission from hot gas .    in our galaxy",
    ", it is well - known that two globular cluster populations exist  a rapidly rotating , metal - rich disk , and a slowly rotating and metal - poor halo ( zinn 1985 ; armandroff & zinn 1988 ; armandroff 1989 ) .",
    "the same situation appears to hold in m31 , though this is more controversial ( huchra 1993 ; ashman & bird 1993 ) . in m33 , there is no significant rotation in the old , metal - poor clusters ( schommer et al .",
    "1991 ) . to date",
    ", m81 is the only late - type galaxy outside the local group with measured cluster velocities .",
    "perelmuter , brodie & huchra ( 1995 ) obtained velocities for 25 clusters out to 20 kpc from the galaxy center , and found a mass of @xmath0 3 @xmath1 10@xmath2 m@xmath3 for m81 within the same radius using the projected mass estimator ( pme ) . their data  can not be used to demonstrate rotation \" in the cluster system , though the cluster velocities are consistent with the hi rotation curve .",
    "there exist a handful of ellipticals with measured cluster velocities : ngc 5128 ( 87 : harris , harris & hesser 1988 ) , ngc 1399 ( 47 : grillmair et al .",
    "1994 ) , m87 ( 44 ) , and m49 ( 26 ) ( mould et al . 1987 , 1990 ) . for m87 and m49 ,",
    "the cluster system has a rotation of @xmath0 200 km / sec ( for _ all _ clusters combined  no separation has been done by colour / metallicity ) .",
    "there is _ no _ rotation seen in the metal - poor clusters in ngc 5128 and ngc 1399 , while there is significant rotation seen in their pne at a level of 100300 km / sec ( hui et al .",
    "1995 , arnaboldi et al .",
    "1994 ) . in ngc 5128 ,",
    "the _ metal - rich _ cluster population identified by zepf & ashman ( 1993 ) is observed to rotate like the pne .",
    "such kinematical differences between clusters and pne are extremely provocative , and we will return to this point later .",
    "m104 ( ngc 4594 ; the sombrero ) has been well - studied spectroscopically in its inner regions ( see table 1 for basic properties of m104 ) .",
    "faber et al ( 1977 ) and schweizer ( 1978 ) derived major axis rotation curves from ionized gas , stellar absorption lines and 21 cm emission .",
    "schweizer found a rotation velocity of @xmath0 300350 km / sec between 515 kpc , and a total mass of 3.3 @xmath1 10@xmath2 m@xmath3 and a m / l@xmath10 of 4.9 @xmath9 1.2 within 15 kpc .",
    "these values are all in reasonable agreement with those found by faber et al .",
    "kormendy & illingworth ( 1982 ) obtained the velocity and velocity dispersion profiles along the m104 major axis from optical absorption lines , finding that v flattens out at @xmath0 250 km / sec between 40120@xmath4 from the galaxy center , while @xmath11 flattens out to @xmath0 100 km / sec at the same distance .",
    "these values are in good agreement with those found by kormendy ( 1988 ) , jarvis & dubath ( 1988 ) , and he s & peletier ( 1993 ) , although these authors were more interested in the behavior very near the galaxy center .",
    "most authors have not found any rotation around the minor axis , with the exception of he s & peletier who did find some minor axis rotation .",
    "kormendy & westpfahl ( 1989 ) showed that 2 @xmath12 m / l@xmath7 @xmath12 4 between 0.5 @xmath12 r @xmath12 180@xmath4 .",
    "he s & peletier found absorption - line strength gradients along the major axis , and concluded on the basis of these gradients and the central kinematics that the m104 bulge is similar in many respects to a giant elliptical .",
    "jarvis & freeman ( 1985 ) constructed models which showed that the surface brightness profiles and kinematics are consistent with the m104 bulge being an isotropic oblate spheroid , flattened mostly by rotation , _ unlike _ the case for ellipticals of the same luminosity .",
    "jarvis & freeman found a m / l@xmath7 = 3.6 within @xmath0 80@xmath4 , and a disk / bulge ratio of @xmath0 0.25 for m104 .",
    "finally , burkhead ( 1986 ) has carried out a major photometric study and decomposition of m104 .",
    "previous photometric studies of the m104 globular clusters include wakamatsu ( 1977 ) , harris et al .",
    "( 1984 ) , and bridges & hanes ( 1992 ) .",
    "the last two studies found a cluster specific frequency s@xmath13 of 23 , while bridges et al .",
    "estimated the clusters to have [ fe / h ] @xmath14 @xmath80.8 from b@xmath8v colours , a metallicity higher than that found for the clusters in the milky way and other nearby spirals .",
    "globular cluster candidates for spectroscopic analysis were selected in two ways .",
    "first , the cosmos team carried out astrometry and crude photometry on ` v ' ( aat 1853 , iiad + gg485 ) and ` b ' ( aat 1859 , iiiaj + gg385 ) aat plates , giving internal positions for thousands of objects . the hst guide star catalogue was then used to identify a set of several dozen stars which were picked by cosmos , allowing a transformation to absolute coordinates to better than 0.2@xmath4 rms .",
    "cosmos had trouble detecting and measuring objects close to the galaxy bulge , but we also had b , v ccd photometry covering three small patches of the m104 bulge ( bridges & hanes 1992 ) .",
    "these photometrically calibrated data then allowed us to crudely calibrate the cosmos data by magnitude and colour , and to establish the astrometric scales in the ccd data so that we could add a few near - central objects to our target lists .",
    "final object selection was made on the basis of stellar appearance , and by cuts in magnitude and colour . in all , 103 candidates in 3 fields were obtained , extending in radius between 0.8 to 6.2 arcmin from the galaxy center . the lext package was used to produce input x , y files which were then used to produce the punched masks . a slit width of 1.5@xmath4",
    "was used , and the slit length varied between 1060 arcsec .",
    "spectra for 76 cluster candidates in two of these fields were obtained with the low dispersion survey spectrograph ( ldss-2 ) in april 1994 ; see table 2 for further details of the observing .",
    "dome and twilight flats were taken at the beginning and end of each night , and cuar arcs were taken throughout each night .",
    "finally , long - slit spectra of m13 , m92 , ngc 6356 , and radial velocity standard stars were taken for velocity and metallicity calibration . except where indicated",
    ", the lext package was used for all data reduction .",
    "first , the makeff task was used to produce a domeflat of mean unity , which was then divided into all of the program frames . after checking to ensure that there were no spatial or spectral shifts between the program frames , the lccdstack program ( kindly supplied by karl glazebrook )",
    "was used to combine the program frames for each mask in an optimal way ; all cosmic rays were removed during the stacking .",
    "wavelength calibration was then done using the arc task on the cuar exposures ; a 3rd order polynomial was found to give a satisfactory fit with residuals typically @xmath12 0.1 @xmath15 .",
    "finally , the spectra were optimally extracted and sky subtracted , generally with linear fits for the background sky .",
    "71 spectra were extracted in total , though many of the spectra are of low s / n .",
    "figure 1 shows representative spectra ranging from low to high s /",
    "n for three confirmed globular clusters .",
    ".basic and derived information about m104 . [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     much of the recent discussion about a possible relationship between galaxy luminosity and mean cluster metallicity has focussed on elliptical galaxies .",
    "it is instructive to see if there is any such relationship for spirals alone .",
    "figure 5 shows the data for the 6 spirals in table 4 . over the small magnitude range @xmath821 @xmath12 m@xmath7 @xmath12 @xmath822 ,",
    "there does seem to be a trend , though this is largely driven by our new data for m104 .",
    "by contrast , there seems to be considerably more scatter about any possible relationship for e / ge galaxies ( cf .",
    "secker et al 1995 ) .",
    "this difference between spirals and ellipticals would be expected if most ellipticals are created by mergers . during a merger a new generation of clusters of higher metallicity may be created ( az ) , and the galaxy luminosity will change , creating more scatter in both m@xmath7 and cluster [ fe / h ] .",
    "spirals , however , have presumably not experienced major merger events , and will adhere more closely to any  primordial \" m@xmath7[fe / h ] relation . however , m104 is not a typical spiral : it is very bright and its disk is a minor component ; it is thus not clear if it should be included in figure 4 .",
    "m33 is also unusual in the other extreme , since it has very little stellar bulge yet has managed to produce a significant cluster population ( e.g. bothun 1992 ) .",
    "more metallicities for globular clusters in spiral galaxies are urgently needed .",
    "we have obtained spectra for 76 globular cluster candidates in m104 .",
    "34 of these objects have been confirmed as m104 globular clusters from their spectra and radial velocities ; this sample extends out to @xmath0 5.5 arcmin in projected radius ( 14 kpc for our adopted distance of d=8.55 mpc ) .",
    "our main conclusions are as follows :    * ( 1 ) :  * the cluster velocity dispersion is 255 ( 210 , 295 ) km / sec , after correction for possible rotation of the cluster system .",
    "this result confirms that m104 is a very massive spiral , as would be inferred from its luminosity .    *",
    "( 2 ) :  * the projected mass estimator yields a mass of 5.0 ( 3.5 , 6.7 ) @xmath1 10@xmath2 m@xmath16 for m104 , within a projected radius of 5.5 arcmin ( 14 kpc ) . the corresponding mass - to - light ratio is m / l@xmath17 = 22@xmath18 ( m / l@xmath5= 16@xmath6 ) , assuming isotropic orbits and a central point mass for m104 .",
    "although there are considerable uncertainties in this m / l determination , we believe that our quoted value is at the low end of the allowed range . comparing to the m / l@xmath7 @xmath12 4 found from stellar and hi rotation curves within 200@xmath4 ,",
    "our best estimate is that the m / l ratio of m104 increases with radius , as would be expected if the galaxy was surrounded by a dark matter halo .    *",
    "( 3 ) :  * there is a marginal detection of rotation in the m104 globular cluster system at the 92.5% confidence level .",
    "however , many more cluster velocities are required to conclusively establish rotation .",
    "the kinematics of the clusters are roughly consistent with preliminary results of freeman et al . for the m104 pne .    *",
    "( 4 ) :  * the mean globular cluster metallicity as determined from the g - band equivalent width of the composite cluster spectrum is [ fe / h]= @xmath80.70 @xmath9 0.3 , using the calibration of brodie & huchra ( 1990 ) .",
    "this metallicity is higher than that of clusters in other spiral galaxies , but comparable to that of e / ge galaxies of similar luminosity to m104 .",
    "we would like to acknowledge harvey macgillivray for doing the cosmos scans , and dave malin for expediting the delivery ofthe m104 plates to edinburgh .",
    "we thank ken freeman and his collaborators for sharing preliminary results from their m104 pne data .",
