    "<S> * 32 * 389 - 397 ) analysed the motion of asymmetric rolling rigid bodies on a horizontal plane . </S>",
    "<S> these papers addressed the common misconception that the instantaneous point of contact of the rolling body with the plane can be used to evaluate the angular momentum @xmath0 and the torque @xmath1 in the equation of motion @xmath2 . to obtain the correct equation of motion , </S>",
    "<S> the  phantom torque \" or various rules that depend on the motion of the point about which @xmath3 and @xmath1 are evaluated were discussed . in this paper , </S>",
    "<S> i consider asymmetric disks rolling down an inclined plane and describe the most basic way of obtaining the correct equation of motion ; that is , to choose the point about which @xmath0 and @xmath1 are evaluated that is stationary in an inertial frame .    in a recent papers , turner and turner @xcite and jensen @xcite discussed the dynamics of a rolling body which is not azimuthally symmetric on a horizontal plane and the standard technique described in introductory physics textbooks for obtaining the equation of motion , which is to use @xmath4 , where @xmath0 is the angular momentum and @xmath1 is the torque with respect to the contact point of the rolling body with the plane , gives incorrect results . </S>",
    "<S> they derived the correct equation of motion , either by introducing an additional term which they refer to as a phantom torque @xcite or by using rules @xcite that depend on the motion of the point about which @xmath0 and @xmath1 are evaluated .    the phantom torque in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite was needed because the point about which the torques and the angular momenta were evaluated , the contact point between the hoop and the plane , was assumed to be attached to the semicircular hoop ( see fig .  2 in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) , and hence it accelerates as the hoop rolls . </S>",
    "<S> the equation of motion @xmath5 , is in general invalid when this point is accelerating respect to an inertial frame , since it is based on newton s second law which is valid only in an inertial frame . </S>",
    "<S> however , in the same way that the validity of newton s second law can be restored in an accelerating ( non - rotating ) frame of reference by inclusion of a fictitious inertial force term , so can that of @xmath4 be with a phantom torque term as described in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , as mentioned in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , the phantom torque eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( 14 ) in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite can be obtained from the fictitious inertial force of an accelerated frame . </S>",
    "<S> namely , in the frame of reference of a point @xmath6 , the mass elements on an object , @xmath7 , experience a fictitious force @xmath8 , where @xmath9 , is the acceleration of @xmath6 with respect to an inertial frame @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this results in a phantom torque @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the total mass of the object and @xmath12 is the position of its center of mass with respect to @xmath6 , since @xmath13 </S>",
    "<S> .    ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite introduces two different rules to take into account the motion of the point of reference about which @xmath3 and @xmath1 are evaluated . </S>",
    "<S> the second rules , given in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( 10 ) of ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite is equivalent to the phantom torque technique of ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> this leads naturally to the question , why not simply solve the problem using the most basic method ; that is , using the equation of motion @xmath2 where @xmath0 and @xmath1 are evaluated about a point @xmath6 that is stationary with respect to an inertial frame ? </S>",
    "<S> i consider this method in this note , for the more general case than in refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite and @xcite , that of a planar disk of radius @xmath14 and mass @xmath11 rolling down an inclined plane , which is tilted at an angle @xmath15 relative to horizontal . </S>",
    "<S> the disk does not necessarily have uniform density , and has a center of mass that is a distance @xmath16 from the geometric center of the disk ( where @xmath17 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the friction of the inclined plane is sufficient to prevent the disk from slipping . </S>",
    "<S> let @xmath18 be the angle of the angle of rotation of the cylinder in the counter - clockwise direction , and @xmath19 correspond to the case where the center of mass , @xmath20 , the point of contact of the cylinder with the inclined plane , @xmath6 , and the geometric center of the cylinder , @xmath21 , are co - linear . </S>",
    "<S> define @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 to be the unit vectors in the directions of motion of the disk , perpendicular to the inclined plane , and perpendicular to the surface of the disk , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> let the unit vector @xmath25 to be in the direction from @xmath21 to @xmath20 , and @xmath26 to be the unit vector perpendicular to @xmath25 , as shown in the fig .  1 . in this note , </S>",
    "<S> i use double subscripts in variables to denote  with respect to \" . </S>",
    "<S> for example , @xmath27 is the position of @xmath20 with respect to @xmath6 .    </S>",
    "<S> the point @xmath6 is assumed to be _ attached to the plane on which the disk is rolling _ , and hence is stationary with respect to an inertial frame . </S>",
    "<S> the angular momentum of the object with respect to a point @xmath6 can be separated @xcite into an  orbital \" part @xmath28 , the angular momentum of the center of mass with respect to @xmath6 and a  spin \" part @xmath29 , the angular momentum relative to the center of mass of the object , @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the velocity of the center of mass with respect to @xmath6 , @xmath32 is the moment of inertia tensor relative to the center of mass and @xmath33 is the angular velocity vector . using eqs .  </S>",
    "<S> ( 1 ) in the equation of motion @xmath2 , for the case considered here @xcite , gives @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the acceleration of the center of mass relative to an inertial frame .    </S>",
    "<S> the first term on the left hand side of eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq:2 ] ) is simply @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is the moment of inertia through @xmath20 in the @xmath38-direction . to determine the second term , we need to find @xmath39 as a function of @xmath18 . the position of the center of mass @xmath20 relative to the @xmath19 point of the contact of the disk and the inclined plane is @xmath40 ; _ i.e. _ , the position of @xmath21 relative to the point of contact for @xmath19 plus the position of @xmath20 relative to @xmath21 . </S>",
    "<S> taking the second derivative with respect to time , and using the result for the angular and centripetal accelerations for circular motion @xcite , gives @xmath41 this , together with @xmath42 , gives @xmath43 & = mr^2 \\left [ ( 1 + \\beta^2 - 2\\beta\\cos\\theta ) \\ddot\\theta +   \\beta\\sin\\theta \\dot\\theta^2 \\right]\\hbz , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath44 and @xmath45 is used to evaluate the cross products . </S>",
    "<S> the direction of the weight force , in the case of an inclined plane that is tilted with an angle of @xmath15 , is @xmath46 and therefore the torque with respect to @xmath6 is @xmath47\\hbz.\\ ] ] ( the normal and frictional force of the inclined plane on the disk act through point @xmath6 , so do not contribute to the torque with respect to @xmath6 . ) </S>",
    "<S> thus , eq .  ( [ eq:2 ] ) can be written as @xmath48,\\label{eq:5}\\ ] ] where @xmath49 is the moment of inertia about point @xmath6 by the parallel axis theorem , since @xmath50 . </S>",
    "<S> for the case of a uniform semicircular hoop on a level plane , where @xmath51 , @xmath52 and @xmath53 , eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq:5 ] ) reproduces the results obtained in refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite and @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the approach typically adopted by introductory texts is to use @xmath2 where @xmath0 and @xmath1 are evaluated with respect to @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> however , typically the approach incorrectly mixes two methods  the point @xmath6 is assumed to be stationary in an inertial frame , but in evaluating @xmath54 , the point @xmath6 is assumed to be attached to the disk , giving in general the incorrect equation of motion @xmath55 . </S>",
    "<S> it misses the term @xmath56 , which can be generated by including a phantom torque term that arises from the acceleration of point @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> when the point @xmath6 is compelled to be stationary with respect to an inertial frame , the phantom torque vanishes </S>",
    "<S> . nevertheless , the @xmath56 still appears , coming instead from the centripetal acceleration of @xmath20 of the disk relative to @xmath21 . </S>",
    "<S> this term vanishes when @xmath21 and @xmath20 are coincident , as in the standard case discussed in introductory physics textbooks , which is why this error has escaped detection . in a sense , </S>",
    "<S> the error is a subtle case of the standard freshman - level mistake of confusing zero velocity with zero acceleration . </S>",
    "<S> just because the point of contact between the disk and the plane is instantaneously stationary does not mean that it can be used as a point of reference for the equation of motion @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> the point of reference must either have a zero acceleration with respect to an inertial frame , as in this note , or if it has non - zero acceleration , as discussed in in refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite and @xcite , additional terms must be introduced . </S>"
