    "disk accretion is a fundamental astrophysical process , responsible for such diverse phenomena as the immensely luminous , distant quasars and the formation and evolution of protostellar systems .",
    "this process requires removing angular momentum from the orbiting gas , and from the beginnings of disk theory it has been clear that microphysical viscosity is orders of magnitude too small to account for observed accretion rates .",
    "it is now understood that accretion is driven by magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) turbulent stresses arising from a robust and powerful instability known as the magnetorotational instability ( mri ) @xcite .",
    "analytic investigations of the mri have proven to be very insightful ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but they can offer only limited guidance to the behavior of the mri in the fully turbulent saturated state .",
    "numerical simulations have become the essential tool for investigating how the mri operates in accretion disks , and in particular , local shearing box simulations ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) have proven to be especially useful in such studies .",
    "the shearing box system solves the equations of mhd in a local , co - rotating patch of an accretion disk .",
    "the size of this patch is assumed to be small compared to its radial distance from the central star , allowing one to use cartesian geometry while retaining the essential dynamics of differential rotation .",
    "shearing box simulations have led to an improved understanding of mri turbulence while addressing some basic questions about accretion disks .",
    "one such question is , what sets the saturation level of mri - driven turbulence and the angular momentum transport rate ?",
    "this is usually phrased as `` what is @xmath7 ? '' following @xcite who made the ansatz that the @xmath13 component of the turbulent stress , @xmath14 , is proportional to the pressure , @xmath15 .",
    "previous shearing box simulations have found substantial evidence that mri - driven stress does not behave in a manner consistent with how @xmath7 is often applied in disk theory .",
    "the early studies of @xcite showed that the stress is proportional to the _ magnetic _ pressure , but the magnetic pressure is not itself directly determined by the gas pressure , a result that holds over a wide range of shearing box simulations @xcite .",
    "@xcite performed an extensive survey and observed , at best , only a very weak gas pressure dependence for turbulent stress .",
    "more recently , vertically stratified local simulations of radiation - dominated disks @xcite have shown that while there is a correlation between the mri stress and total ( gas plus radiation ) pressure , it has the opposite causal relationship from that normally assumed in the @xmath7 model : the stress determines the pressure , not the other way around . increased stress can lead to increased pressure through turbulent heating , but an increase in pressure does not feed back into the stress .",
    "what then does determine the saturation level of the mri ? we know that viscosity and resistivity can significantly affect the properties of the linear mri by reducing growth rates and altering the stability limits .",
    "recently , the influence of the viscous and ohmic dissipation on mri - induced turbulence has become a focus of shearing box simulations .",
    "previous investigations into the effect of ohmic resistivity on the saturated state @xcite found that angular momentum transport decreases as the resistivity is increased , but it was not until the very recent work of @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite that the influence of physical dissipation in numerical simulations was fully appreciated .",
    "@xcite and @xcite found that for shearing box simulations without a net magnetic flux and without explicit dissipation terms , the turbulent saturation level decreases with increasing numerical resolution without any sign of convergence .",
    "this surprising result was subsequently confirmed with different numerical codes ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in a second paper",
    ", @xcite demonstrated that the saturation level of the mri in shearing boxes depends strongly on the magnetic prandtl number , i.e. , the ratio of viscosity to resistivity ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "specifically , for local simulations without a net magnetic flux , the turbulent stresses increase nearly linearly with @xmath9 and for @xmath16 , the turbulence decays .",
    "@xcite subsequently showed that at a fixed @xmath9 , the presence of even a small viscosity and resistivity is sufficient to provide convergence in the zero - net field case .",
    "the increase in stress with @xmath9 is also present for net vertical fields @xcite and net toroidal fields @xcite ; for these field geometries , the @xmath9 dependence is weaker and turbulence is maintained even for @xmath17 .",
    "for the net toroidal field model , only a sufficiently high resistivity could actually kill the turbulence completely @xcite .",
    "most of these viscosity and resistivity studies used the unstratified shearing box model where vertical gravity is ignored and periodic boundary conditions are assumed for the vertical direction .",
    "shearing box models that include vertical stratification are more realistic however , and interesting new effects arise when vertical gravity is included .",
    "for example , in most such simulations , net toroidal field is generated near the mid - plane via mri turbulence , buoyantly rises upwards , and is replaced with a field of the opposite sign in the mid - plane region .",
    "this behavior happens on a timescale of @xmath18 orbits and appears to be indicative of an mhd dynamo operating within the disk ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "furthermore , the vertical structure of the disk consists of mri - turbulent gas that is marginally stable to buoyancy within @xmath6 , whereas outside of this region , the gas is magnetically dominated , significantly less turbulent , and buoyantly unstable ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the effects of resistivity on the mri in vertically stratified shearing boxes has been studied ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but many of these calculations are designed with protostellar systems in mind and employ a very large resistivity to completely quench the mri and create a `` dead zone '' near the midplane ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "the effects of smaller resistivities and of @xmath0 and @xmath9 on vertically stratified turbulence has barely been examined . recently",
    ", however , @xcite investigated how the results of @xcite and @xcite might change in the presence of vertical stratification .",
    "@xcite considered the zero - net magnetic flux case and employed vertically periodic boundary conditions to ensure that zero net flux was maintained throughout the simulation .",
    "they found that without physical dissipation , the volume - averaged stress level reaches a constant value as numerical resolution is increased , in contrast to unstratified simulations where the stress declines .",
    "they further examined three @xmath0 and @xmath1 values that lead to a decay of turbulence in unstratified boxes . with vertical gravity , however , these @xmath0 and @xmath1 values lead to large , long timescale fluctuations in the volume averaged stress level ; the turbulence saturates at a relatively high level for @xmath19 100 orbits , then decreases to a lower saturation level for another @xmath19 100 orbits , and then increases again .",
    "the primary goal of this work is to extend these first results and investigate in more detail how @xmath0 and @xmath1 affect mri turbulence in vertically stratified shearing boxes .",
    "in particular , we consider the origin of the long - term fluctuations seen in @xcite , and whether that effect might be relevant to real accretion disks .",
    "since stratification can alter the saturation levels of mri - induced turbulence , we also investigate whether increasing @xmath9 still leads to increased stress levels and how @xmath9 affects the dynamo process previously observed in stratified simulations .",
    "finally , these simulations will also serve as an essential starting point for future studies that include more realistic physics , such as temperature- and density - dependent @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows . in ",
    "[ method ] , we describe our evolution equations , parameters , and initial conditions . in   [ unstrat_sims ] , we present a series of unstratified shearing box simulations to calibrate the effects of physical dissipation and serve as controls for the vertically stratified shearing boxes with constant @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "we discuss our vertically stratified simulations in   [ strat_sims ] , which are the primary focus of this paper .",
    "the first set of these simulations contain no physical dissipation , and we carry out several analyses to improve our understanding of vertically stratified mri turbulence .",
    "the second set of simulations then includes physical dissipation to study the @xmath9 effect .",
    "we wrap up with a discussion and our general conclusions in   [ discussion ] .",
    "we also present a detailed description of our numerical algorithm in an appendix .",
    "in this study , we use _ athena _ , a second - order accurate godunov flux - conservative code for solving the equations of mhd . _",
    "athena _ uses the dimensionally unsplit corner transport upwind ( ctu ) method of @xcite coupled with the third - order in space piecewise parabolic method ( ppm ) of @xcite and a constrained transport ( ct ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) algorithm for preserving the @xmath20  =  0 constraint .",
    "we use the hlld riemann solver to calculate the numerical fluxes @xcite .",
    "a detailed description of the _ athena _ algorithm and the results of various test problems are given in @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "our simulations utilize the shearing box approximation , a model for a local co - rotating disk patch whose size is small compared to the radial distance from the central object , @xmath21 .",
    "we construct a local cartesian frame , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , and @xmath24 , co - rotating with an angular velocity @xmath8 corresponding to the orbital frequency at @xmath21 , the center of the box . in this frame , the equations of motion become @xcite :    @xmath25    @xmath26    @xmath27    where @xmath28 is the mass density , @xmath29 is the momentum density , @xmath30 is the magnetic field , @xmath31 is the gas pressure , and @xmath32 is the shear parameter , defined as @xmath33ln@xmath34ln@xmath35 .",

    "we assume an isothermal equation of state @xmath37 , where @xmath11 is the isothermal sound speed . from left to right , the source terms in equation  ( [ momentum_eqn ] ) correspond to radial tidal forces ( gravity and centrifugal ) , vertical gravity , the coriolis force , and the divergence of the viscous stress tensor , @xmath38 , defined as    @xmath39    where the indices refer to the spatial components @xcite , and @xmath0 is the shear viscosity .",
    "we neglect bulk viscosity . the source term in equation  ( [ induction_eqn ] )",
    "is the effect of ohmic resistivity , @xmath1 , on the magnetic field evolution .",
    "note that our system of units has the magnetic permeability @xmath40 .",
    "details about the numerical integration of these equations are presented in the appendix .    for unstratified shearing box simulations , the boundary conditions are periodic for @xmath41 and @xmath24 , and shearing - periodic for @xmath42 .",

    "are parameterized in terms of reynolds numbers . at a scale height , @xmath4 ,",
    "away from the radial center of the shearing box , the fluid velocity is @xmath43 .",
    "thus , the sound speed is a representative velocity for the fluid , and we define the reynolds numbers as    @xmath44    similarly we define the magnetic reynolds number ,    @xmath45    and their ratio , the magnetic prandtl number ,    @xmath46    because resistivity affects the mri directly , another useful dimensionless quantity is the elsasser number    @xmath47    @xmath48 can be computed on a zone - by - zone basis , but it is also helpful to calculate an average @xmath48 for a simulation .",
    "thus , we can write the characteristic @xmath49 speed in direction @xmath50 via the averaged magnetic field in that direction ,    @xmath51    where the angled brackets denote a volume average , and the subscript @xmath52 depending on the direction of interest . in the above definition of @xmath48 ,",
    "all three components are used in calculating the @xmath49 speed .",
    "as the elsasser number approaches unity , resistivity becomes more dominant , stabilizing the mri .",
    "@xcite found that turbulence decayed in net toroidal field , unstratified shearing boxes when the elsasser number was @xmath53 .",
    "although we focus on physical dissipation , there is numerical dissipation as well .",
    "one way to characterize the effects of finite resolution is to compare the characteristic mri wavelength , @xmath54 to the grid zone size .",

    "the growth of the mri can be reduced @xcite and the mri is under - resolved , although this number has some uncertainty and should be taken only as an estimate .",
    "one can also calculate a volume - averaged @xmath49 speed rather than an @xmath49 speed determined by the averaged field , i.e. , @xmath59    for convenience , most of our analysis uses equation  ( [ alfven_q ] ) , as the volume - averaged history data and the one - dimensional , horizontally averaged quantities are routinely computed at high time resolution for use in creating , e.g. , space - time plots . as a check , we have calculated the volume - averaged @xmath49 speed via equation  ( [ alfven_q_alternate ] ) for several hundreds of orbits in a few of our vertically stratified simulations ( the volume average is done within @xmath12 of the mid - plane ) .",
    "we found that @xmath60 from equation  ( [ alfven_q_alternate ] ) is roughly 1 - 1.5 times larger than that from equation  ( [ alfven_q ] ) .",
    "we have run shearing box simulations with different field geometries , dissipation values and resolutions , both with and without vertical gravity . here",

    "5 ) while in the low state , the continued action of the dynamo can raise the toroidal field to a level at which the mid - plane mri is reactivated , switching the disk back to a `` high '' state .    the first two of these results are consistent with previous stratified shearing box simulations and do not appear to be altered by the inclusion of physical dissipation .",

    "* ) and global simulations @xcite , we found a strong 10 orbital period variability in the mean magnetic field within the mid - plane region .",
    "this variability is characterized by the buoyant rise of predominantly toroidal field from the mid - plane region , after which a field of opposite sign takes its place at the mid - plane .",
    "the evolution of this toroidal field can be well - modeled by a simple @xmath7@xmath8 mean field dynamo where the shear of radial field into toroidal field and the subsequent buoyant removal of toroidal field from the mid - plane dominate the evolution .",
    "in addition to the dynamo period of roughly 10 orbits , we also observe a longer @xmath196 orbit timescale variability .",
    "this behavior has not previously been reported , and while we do not know its origin , there is evidence that it plays a role in another novel effect resulting from vertical gravity : high and low states . for disks that are sufficiently resistive , i.e. , have low enough @xmath72",
    ", mri turbulence decays near the mid - plane leading to a quiescent period that is eventually followed by regrowth of the mri in this region .",
    "the period of this variability is on a similar timescale to the long - period variability seen in all the stratified simulations .",
    "the transition to a low state occurs when the mean toroidal field in the mid - plane region is reduced below some critical value , presumably by buoyancy .",
    "resistivity dominates over the mri and the turbulence decays .",
    "an extremely weak mean radial field remains however .",
    "although this mean radial field itself can vary during the low state , it creates toroidal field through shear .",
    "shear amplification is largely unaffected by resistivity .",
    "once the toroidal field reaches a particular strength , the mid - plane mri is re - energized , and the disk becomes fully turbulent again , returning to the high state .",
    "this behavior is not particularly sensitive to @xmath9 and appears to be the same as that reported by @xcite .",
    "thus , it is not likely to be related to the dynamo issue of @xmath227 in zero net magnetic flux shearing boxes , which @xcite specifically investigated .",
    "instead , it appears to be a robust behavior that emerges whenever the disk is sufficiently resistive .",
    "the critical @xmath72 below which the high - low variability exists is @xmath228 . if @xmath229 , the turbulence remains sustained for the dissipation parameters explored here , and averaged stress increases with @xmath9 for all @xmath24 , though with a less steep dependence of @xmath7 on @xmath9 compared to unstratified simulations .    because we are dealing with the decay of turbulence and the behaviors of weak magnetic fields , the values of properties such as @xmath230",
    "may well be resolution dependent .",
    "however , given the long evolution times probed here , it was necessary to limit the resolution to 32 grid zones per @xmath4 . before running the vertically stratified simulations , we executed a series of unstratified calculations at this resolution to test whether or not the mri and the effects of physical dissipation would likely be resolved .",
    "we found that the effect of physical dissipation on mri saturation is reasonably well converged at 32 zones per @xmath4 : @xmath7 increases with @xmath9 at this resolution , although with a steeper dependence than at higher resolution , and @xmath7 is roughly constant with resolution above 32 zones per @xmath4 for a given set of @xmath119 , @xmath72 , and @xmath9 values .",
    "this in itself is an interesting result since it shows that the higher resolutions used in @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite may not be necessary to capture the general effects of physical dissipation .",
    "it is also in agreement with the recent vertically stratified shearing boxes of @xcite that included radiation physics ; they found that only @xmath120 zones per @xmath4 in the vertical dimension are required to gain a reasonable representation of the turbulent saturation level .",
    "thus , while the exact value of @xmath230 may change at higher resolution , the general effects of physical dissipation on the vertically stratified mri are likely captured at the resolutions we used .    what do these results imply for the mri and its application to astrophysical disks ?",
    "first , it had been previously appreciated that sufficient resistivity could cause a transition from a turbulent ( `` high '' ) state to a non - turbulent ( `` low '' ) state .",
    "here we have found that a process resembling an @xmath7@xmath8 dynamo can accomplish the reverse and re - establish the high state .",
    "the transition occurs on longer timescales than the @xmath18 orbit associated with the dynamo .",
    "this temporal variability could have potential applications for several types of accretion disks .",
    "protoplanetary disks have large regions of low ionization gas , including a dead zone layer @xcite where resistivity is too high to sustain the mri .",
    "dwarf nova disks also contain regions of partial ionization , and it is intriguing that the @xmath72 values in these systems are on the same order as the critical @xmath231 for the decay / regrowth behavior @xcite .",
    "even some regions of agn disks may have moderately high resistivity , though typical @xmath72 values are probably larger than those in dwarf nova systems because of the larger disk scale height @xcite .",
    "it is tempting to associate the peaks and dips of turbulent activity in our simulations with the outbursts and variability observed in these systems .",
    "of course , there remains much work before such a connection can be substantiated .",
    "in particular , more realistic simulations will have @xmath1 ( and @xmath0 ) that depend on temperature and density , rather than being constant throughout the disk .",
    "furthermore , the influence of other non - ideal mhd effects on the mri needs more work .",
    "the hall effect is often times just as important as ohmic resistivity in astrophysical environments @xcite , and while simulations including both hall and ohmic terms have been carried out by @xcite and @xcite , there remains more parameter space to explore and physics to include .",
    "lastly , we note that if @xmath1 is so large that no mri modes are present , there would be no temporal variability and the turbulence would be completely quenched .    in disks that have @xmath72 above the critical value",
    ", the mri - driven turbulence operates continuously .",
    "nevertheless , as previously seen in unstratified simulations , dissipation terms can have an impact : the stress level increases with increasing @xmath9 .",
    "this may be relevant to hot , fully ionized disk gas such as in x - ray binaries and some regions of agn disks where @xmath9 has a strong temperature dependence @xcite . while our simulations show that angular momentum transport increases with @xmath9 , the @xmath119 and @xmath72 values of such disks are significantly larger than the values probed here . whether or not the @xmath9 effect continues into the large @xmath119/@xmath72 regime remains very much an open area of research .    finally , one particular field geometry that has not been explored here or in most vertically stratified local simulations is that of a net vertical field .",
    "these simulations are quite challenging ; the channel mode dominates the solution @xcite , leading to very strongly magnetized regions of the disk that can often times cause the numerical integration techniques to fail ( but see @xcite , in which a stable evolution was produced ) .    in summary",
    ", we have explored the spatial and temporal behavior of the mri in the presence of both vertical gravity and physical dissipation .",
    "we find that for moderately resistive simulations , the disk cycles between states of low and high turbulent stresses , and that orbital shear of radial field into toroidal field is essential to both this behavior as well as the temporal variability of sustained turbulence .",
