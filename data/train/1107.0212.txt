    "it is generally accepted that the elements of mean pulsar profiles can be divided into core and conal components ( @xcite , rankin ( 1990 , hereafter @xcite ) , @xcite ) .",
    "the core component usually occupies central parts of the profile and is often flanked by one or two pairs of conal components .",
    "the importance of the conal profile components was recently studied statistically by maciesiak , gil & ribeiro ( 2011 ; hereafter @xcite ) .",
    "these authors used recently large data sets of pulsar periods , profile widths and inclination angles resulted from large pulsar surveys conducted in recent years .",
    "they also compiled the largest ever database of pulsars with interpulses ( ip ) , divided into the double  pole ( dp  ip ) and single  pole ( sp  ip ) cases ( see table [ tab.1 ] in this paper ) .",
    "the ip pulsars constitute about 3 percent ( 2 and 1 percent for dp  ip and sp  ip cases , respectively ) of the pulsar population .",
    "the dp  ip pulsars ( almost orthogonal rotators ) tend to be younger or middle aged , while sp  ip pulsars tend to be older ( see figure 6 in @xcite ) .",
    "this suggest a secular alignment of the magnetic axis towards the spin axis over a timescale of about @xmath4 years .",
    "the interpulse emission is important also for the statistics of the core profile components in pulsars .",
    "rankin ( 1990 ; hereafter r90 ) measured the half - power ( 50% of the maximum intensity ) widths of core components in a number of pulsars ( about 100 ) , including those showing the interpulse emission .",
    "she found that the distribution of pulse  widths has a clear lower bound @xmath5 populated by dp ",
    "ip cases , in which the inclination angle @xmath3 must be close to @xmath6 . the rest of pulsars including sp ",
    "ip cases lied in a swarm of data points above the lower bound .",
    "@xcite described this distribution by a simple mathematical expression @xmath7 indicating that the core component widths depend only upon the pulsar period @xmath8 and the inclination angle @xmath3 between the rotation and magnetic axes of the neutron star and they are almost insensitive to the impact angle @xmath9 of the closest approach of the observer s line  of  sight to the magnetic axis ( for description of pulsar geometry see paper i or figure [ figure.b1 ] in the on - line appendix [ appendix.b ] ) .",
    "the above equation represents a useful method of estimation of the inclination angle @xmath3 in pulsars with core component in the mean profile . in this paper",
    "we attempt to revisit and verify these important and intriguing results , using a more abundant database that we compiled in @xcite ) .",

    "however , one can ask the question how would this figure look like if one used all @xmath110 measurements available in the atnf database ( without distinctions into core and conal components ) .",
    "some of the measurements corresponding to profiles dominated by prominent core components would just reproduce the figure [ figure.2 ] . however , those measurements which correspond to the conal profiles should lie above the lower boundary line @xmath146 ( lbl hereafter ) , which should still appear as the prominent feature .",
    "figure [ figure.3 ] presents a plot of all 1522 values of @xmath110 versus pulsar period , which were available in the atnf database ( excluding millisecond and other recycled pulsars ) .",
    "apparently , the bulk of the measurements lies above the lbl ( @xmath147 after rescaling to 1.37 ghz ) .",
    "the widths of dp  ip ( red symbols with error bars ) and sp  ip ( green symbols ) were added for the reference and comparison with figure [ figure.2 ] .",
    "it is natural why the absolute majority of points lies above the lower boundary line . indeed ,",
    "if these are core components and/or conal components surrounding the core ones , then they must obey the lower boundary limit as discussed in this paper ( for geometry of conal components see @xcite , @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , the real question is why there is a small number of points below the lbl ( assuming that these measurements are not erroneous ) ?",
    "taking into account the scatter of red data points and their errors in figure [ figure.3 ] it is instructive to introduce the lower boundary belt @xmath148 ( lbb hereafter ; marked by two grey dashed lines ) , which should not be mistaken with the formal fit expressed by equation ( [ eq.2 ] ) .",
    "we took every effort to identify points lying below or within the lbb ( table [ tab.2 ] ) .",
    "it is extremely interesting that most of these points were rotating radio transients ( rrats ; @xcite ) marked by orange stars , or other sporadically emitting pulsars .",
    "rrats are repeating sources with pulsar underlying periodicity , detectable via their extremely strong sporadic single pulses .",
    "a good example is the case of j@xmath130 marked by the orange error bar in figure [ figure.3 ] , whose length represents individual measurements of different events @xcite , with the average value of @xmath149 ( table [ tab.2 ] ) .",
    "interestingly , the width of the mean profile obtained by folding of large number of individual events of this relatively frequent rrat is about @xmath150 , well above the lbb .",
    "the most interesting fact is that the width of the central component of this profile is about @xmath151 ( figure 1 . in @xcite ) , which fits to the lbl / lbb @xmath152 very well .",
    "this strongly suggest that most of data points below the lbb in figure [ figure.3 ] represent a single events of rrats activity , whose pulse  widths are much smaller than their underlying pulse windows .",
    "another small group of three data points below the lbb represents the single pulse ( sp ) detected pulsars ( green stars ) in the arecibo palfa survey @xcite .",
    "one of them j@xmath140 has the narrowest ever measured width of @xmath153 ( table [ tab.2 ] ) , which corresponds to the lowest known duty cycle of about 0.01 percent ( compared to the typical value of about 5 percent ) .",
    "yet another group of data points below the lbb represents the young energetic psrs ( table [ tab.2 ] ) marked in magenta .",
    "it is interesting that the main pulse of the crab pulsar ( marked by diamond ) seems to belong to this category as well .",
    "it is well known that the precursor of the main pulse in the profile of b@xmath11 behaves like typical core component , while the main - pulse and the interpulse show rather untypical properties ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "we also checked the group of pulsars with partial cone profiles but no single case was found below the lbb in figure [ figure.3 ] . in the long list of such pulsars recently published by @xcite",
    "we identified only four cases ( table [ tab.2 ] ) lying within the lbb ( blue circles ) .",
    "this paradoxical at first sight result means that the opening angles of core and conal beams are about the same .    in summary , the lower boundary with the slope following @xmath154 is a prominent feature in the distribution of pulse ",
    "width @xmath110 versus pulsar period @xmath8 , especially if extended to the concept of narrow lower boundary belt ( figure [ figure.3 ] ) with the width determined by scatter and errors of @xmath110 measurements of core components in dp  ip pulsars ( red data points ) .",
    "there is a small number of data points below the lbb but all of them represent some unusual species , mostly transients and intermittent pulsars , whose sporadic emission is much narrower than their underlying pulse windows .",
    "finally , it is worth noting that the existence of lbl or even lbb is not depending neither on the method@xmath155 nor on the accuracy of the measurements of core widths in dp  ip pulsars .",
    "indeed , the lbl is still apparent when the red symbols are removed from figure [ figure.3 ] , as clearly visible in figure [ figure.8 ] .",
    "the period dependent lower boundary in @xmath110 pulse  widths revealed in pulsar data , translates into the period dependent lower limit for the half - power beam widths of the transversal structures in the overall pulsar beam .",
    "geometry of pulsar emission is described by the well known formula @xmath156 \\;\\sin\\left[\\left(\\rho_{50}-\\beta\\right ) /2\\right]}{\\sin\\alpha\\ \\ ; sin\\left(\\alpha+\\beta\\right)}\\right]^{1/2 } , \\label{eq.3}\\ ] ] ( @xcite , gil , kijak & seiradakis ( 1993 ) ; hereafter gks93 ) , where @xmath3 is the inclination angle ( of the magnetic axis to the rotation axis ) , @xmath9 is the impact angle ( of the closest approach of the line  of  sight to the magnetic axis ) and @xmath157 is the opening angle of the pulsar beam corresponding to half - power maximum beam width ( fwhm ) .",
    "this equation holds generally on the sphere centered on the pulsar and the only assumption about the pulsar beam that has to be satisfied is the phase symmetry about the fiducial plane @xmath158 containing both pulsar axes and the observer s direction ( figure [ figure.b1 ] in the on - line appendix b ) .",
    "one should realise that the illustration of circular beam presented in figure [ figure.b1 ] represents only a cross - section of a certain intensity level of the beam with the pulsar centered celestial hemisphere .",
    "it says nothing about the internal structure of the beam , neither the angular nor the radial intensity distribution .",
    "the core pulsar beam can be modelled by a gaussian distribution of the mean intensity @xmath159 , symmetric about the magnetic axis ( beam axis ) .",
    "thus , it can be described by the function @xmath160 , \\label{eq.4}\\ ] ] where @xmath161 , @xmath162 and @xmath163 is an arbitrary steepness parameter . for a certain impact angle @xmath164",
    "the observer will detect a local intensity maximum @xmath165\\ ] ] and thus we can write equation ( [ eq.4 ] ) in the form @xmath166 , \\label{eq.5}\\ ] ] where @xmath167 is the local peak intensity which can be determined from observations .",
    "r90 used slightly different approach and assumed that the angular distribution of the core pulsar beam is well approximated by a bivariate gaussian function @xmath168,\\ ] ] whose breadth ( fwhm ) is invariant along any set of parallel paths .",
    "thus , she concludes ,  the angular width of core beams can only be weakly dependent on the centrality of traverse and the effect of the impact angle @xmath9 on the observed width of the core components may be quite weak  .",
    "however , one should realise that approximation described by the above equation is a true representation of gaussian intensity distribution of the pulsar beam only in a special case when @xmath169 , that is @xmath170 and @xmath171 ( equation [ eq.3 ] ) .",
    "only then the above function @xmath172 is equivalent to @xmath173 expressed by our exact equation ( [ eq.5 ] ) . in general , although the projection of the line  of  sight cut through the gaussian beam is indeed independent of the impact angle @xmath9 , the observed pulse  width ( not a beam width ) @xmath174 may depend on both @xmath3 and @xmath9 . to examine this problem",
    "exactly we will use equation ( [ eq.3 ] ) equipped with the relationship @xmath175 valid only for a gaussian beam shape ( see figure [ figure.b2 ] for illustration ) . here",
    "@xmath176 is the half - power beam width , while @xmath177 is the opening angle of pulsar beam measured at fwhm level by the observer with the impact angle @xmath9 .",
    "following figures [ figure.1 ] and [ figure.2 ] it is quite reasonable to adopt for the half - power width of the core beam @xmath178 which seems quite well established observationally ) is just a half of the 2.45 factor from equation ( [ eq.1 ] ) .",
    "of course such a four significant figures accuracy is not important , we nevertheless used it in our numerical calculations . ] .",
    "the natural @xmath179 factor undoubtedly means that the radiation associated with @xmath110 of core components is emitted tangentially to dipolar magnetic field lines , but the value of the numerical factor close to @xmath180 is not yet clear ( see conclusion section ) .",
    "the results of calculations of @xmath181 for different values of the pulsar period @xmath8 are presented in figure [ figure.4 ] .",
    "three different panels correspond to different periods @xmath8 equal to 1 , 0.1 and 0.01 seconds , respectively .",
    "four solid lines in each panel correspond to different values of the impact @xmath9 and opening @xmath177 angles marked by red , green , dark blue and light blue colours ( the latter corresponds to the value of about @xmath182 ) .",
    "the dashed orange line represents the maximum difference between the solid lines ( red and light blue ) .",
    "as one can see for @xmath183s a significant residual occur only for very small inclination angles @xmath184 ( almost aligned rotators ) . for shorter periods the residuals are larger",
    ". however , even for 10 millisecond periods the errors made due to neglecting @xmath9 are negligible for inclinations angles @xmath185 .",
    "thus , one can generally state that neglecting @xmath9 in estimating the core width is quite well justified by results of strict calculations , especially for larger inclinations angles . for orthogonal rotators ( dp  ip )",
    "it can be treated as an exact result .",
    "thus , equation ( [ eq.1 ] ) proposed by @xcite should be regarded as a very good tool for estimating the inclination angles using the core pulse  widths . in figure [ figure.5 ]",
    "we superposed on the data from figure [ figure.2 ] the results of simulations of @xmath110 performed using a technique developed in paper i applied to core emission ( see on - line appendix [ appendix.a ] ) .",
    "although these were strict calculations , including simulations of both inclination angle @xmath3 ( different ranges of this angle are marked with different colours ) and impact angle @xmath9 , their results are fully consistent with equation ( [ eq.1 ] ) .",
    "this equation was derived by @xcite assuming @xmath186 , based on the claim that the core width is almost completely insensitive of the value of the impact angle @xmath9 .",

    "the blue line represents the maximum relative difference between scattered points ( in the same scale as for @xmath3 axes but expressed in percents ) , thus it describes an accuracy of determination of @xmath3 . as one can see , for almost orthogonal rotators the difference between the two methods is about 10 percent .",

    "versus period @xmath8 for 1495 normal pulsars from the atnf database . [ figure.8 ] ]",
    "the most important result of our paper is a clear confirmation of the lower limit in the distribution of half - power pulse ",
    "width @xmath110 in core components of pulsar profiles when presented versus the pulsar period @xmath8 using much bigger database than that used originally by @xcite .",
    "as illustrated in figures [ figure.1 ] , [ figure.2 ] , [ figure.3 ] and [ figure.8 ] this limit is represented by the line @xmath194 at 1 ghz and @xmath147 at 1.4 ghz .",
    "it seems that more appropriate description of the lower boundary limit is the lower boundary belt ( lbb ) @xmath148 , which accounts for scatter and errors in @xmath110 measurements .",
    "strictly speaking , the widths of the lbb was determined by the scatter and errors of dp - ip cases marked as red symbols in figure 3 . however , the normal data points seem to populate the belt marked in figure 8 in similar manner as the dp - ip cases do in figure 3 .",
    "the concept of lbb is based not only on core widths of dp  ip pulsars ( like in @xcite ) but here it is based on all @xmath110 measurements of normal pulsars available in the atnf database , without distinctions into core and conal components , of course .",
    "this is dramatically illustrated in figure [ figure.8 ] containing 1495 data points .",
    "this figure is a reproduction of figure [ figure.3 ] with all special points described in the legend omitted .",
    "apparently , the existence of the lower boundary limit in the pulse  width measurements discovered by rankin ( 1990 ) does not depend neither on the method nor on the errors of measurements of the core widths in dp - ip pulsars .",
    "the unweighted formal fit to the points within lbb ( between dashed lines ) is @xmath195 .",
    "the existence of the lower bound in the distribution of @xmath110 versus pulsar period @xmath8 is very intriguing and requires solid and convincing explanation .",
    "the exponent @xmath196 is evidently related to the geometry of dipolar field lines in the radio emission region , while the value of the numerical factor about @xmath197 is a little more mysterious .",
    "@xcite argued that the core component widths are intimately related to the polar cap geometry at the stellar surface , whose bundle of the last open dipolar field lines have an angular extent ( opening angle @xmath198 ) very close to @xmath199 .",
    "although this natural and very appealing explanation is commonly accepted , it is not free from theoretical and interpretational problems .",
    "first of all , the coherent radio emission can not originate at or very near the polar cap , because there are no plasma instabilities available in this region .",
    "recently , a modern version of this idea is discussed , with arguments that the core emission originates below the conal one but the former is emitted well above the polar cap surface .",
    "for example , @xcite argued that in psr b@xmath200 the emission of its core component originates over a range of altitudes ( up to about 100 km ) above the star surface ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "this broadens the required opening angle by a factor of about square root of the normalised emission altitude , that is about 3 .",
    "if this is a case then one has to conclude that the core radio emission is related to an innermost subset of the open dipolar magnetic field lines .",
    "the problem therefore is to identify structures within the overall pulsar beam with an angular extent corresponding to the observed lower boundary limit .",
    "we plan to devote to this problem the forthcoming paper iii of this series .",
    "the interpretational problems mentioned above do not affect the approximate method of estimating the inclination angle @xmath3 in any pulsar with a core component proposed by @xcite .",
    "we have shown by means of monte carlo simulations based on the strict geometrical calculations that this method offers quite good an approximation with the accuracy of 5 , 10 , 20 and 50 percent for @xmath171 , @xmath201 , @xmath202 and @xmath203 , respectively ( figure [ figure.7 ] ) .",
    "this method can not be used in almost aligned cases with very small values of @xmath3 .",
