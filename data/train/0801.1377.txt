    "this equation is solved numerically to obtain the behavior of the density correlation function .",
    "it is clear that the dynamics of the density correlation function @xmath116 is driven here by the memory function @xmath118 which is expressed in terms of @xmath100 itself .",
    "this constitutes a nonlinear feed back mechanism @xcite causing a dynamic transition of the liquid to a nonergodic state in which the long time limit of the density correlation function @xmath119 .",

    "2 we display the phase diagram with @xmath104 and @xmath105 showing the ideal glass transition line .",
    "though this dynamic transition is finally cutoff due to ergodicity restoring mechanisms , it marks a cross over in the dynamical behavior of supercooled liquid .",
    "the liquid state is characterized by the density correlation function following initial power law relaxations , followed by a final stretched exponential decay @xmath122 $ ] @xcite . in the glassy state",
    "the density correlation function decays to a nonzero value equal to the non - ergodicity parameter . in fig .",
    "2 we have also shown the values of @xmath123 and @xmath124 corresponding to the nonergodic states in which the dynamics is studied in this paper ( to be explained below ) . for presenting our results in the following ,",
    "we express time in units of @xmath125 where @xmath126 is the bare longitudinal viscosity of the liquid related to its short time dynamics .",
    "we keep the @xmath127 appearing in the expression ( [ const ] ) for the coupling constants of the memory function fixed at a constant value ( = .4 ) throughout the calculation .",
    "this numerical value is reached by treating @xmath127 as an adjustable parameter here for comparison of the results of the present model with experimental data .",
    "this essentially implies that the cutoff @xmath115 of wave vector integration is being treated as an adjustable parameter in the coarse grained model we present here .",
    "a key quantity of interest in the present analysis is the fragility parameter @xmath0 which by definition is related to the final relaxation behavior of the supercooled liquid near @xmath3 .",
    "but over this temperature range , the mct approach has not been very successfull@xcite in explaining the relaxation behavior .",
    "a useful observation@xcite in this respect is that the slope of the viscosity vs. inverse - temperature plot in the high temperature range can be linked with the fragility .",
    "this is justified as follows : for very fragile systems ( large @xmath0 ) the slope of the @xmath2 vs. @xmath128 curve at temperatures near @xmath3 is large and hence it must be correspondingly small at the other end of the angell plot , _",
    "i.e. _ , for temperatures much higher than @xmath3 .",
    "this is because the curves for different @xmath0 meet at both ends on the @xmath128 axis . by examining experimental data ,",
    "it was pointed out @xcite that the slope of the @xmath2 vs. @xmath128 curve on the high temperature side is inversely related to the fragility @xmath0 .",
    "since mct is a valid theory for the slow dynamics well above @xmath3 , we have investigated the relaxation behavior which follows from the present model in this high temperature range .",
    "we focus on the growth of the relaxation time @xmath129 instead of that of the viscosity @xmath2 . in our model , increasing the parameter @xmath130 brings the system closer to the ideal transition ( since it results in an increase of @xmath129 ) and hence this parameter is treated like the inverse of temperature , @xmath131 .",
    "the dependence of the relaxation time @xmath129 on @xmath130 at various ( fixed ) @xmath1 values is displayed in fig .",
    "3 . for large @xmath1",
    "the observed variation is similar to the @xmath2 vs. @xmath128 curve of a fragile liquid .",
    "although according to mct model the power law behavior describes the relaxation time data in this range better , we fit @xmath129 , following ref .",
    "@xcite , to an arrhenius form with activation energy @xmath132 , _",
    "i.e. , _ @xmath133 . by the property of the angell plot referred to above",
    ", we assume @xmath134 to be proportional to the fragility @xmath0 .",
    "@xmath130 is proportional to @xmath128 with the proportionality constant being independent of @xmath1 .",
    "thus we assume that constants @xmath39 and @xmath40 in the expression ( [ free - en ] ) for the free energy are only functions of temperature and the two elastic constants @xmath135 and @xmath136 are to be treated as independent entities .",
    "4 displays @xmath137 against the variation of @xmath1 showing an approximately linear behavior .",
    "therefore the present model agrees qualitatively with the linear correlation predicted by novikov and sokolov .",
    "it should be noted that the inverse nature of the relations between fragility and the slope of the viscosity vs. inverse - temperature plot respectively at the high and low temperature sides is a property of the angell plot itself .",
    "however the reciprocal relation _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath138 as used above can only be justified in a qualitative manner . in order to demonstrate the sensitivity of the results on the values of the parameters @xmath130 and @xmath127 we display in fig 4 . the @xmath137 vs @xmath139 g curves for different values of @xmath140 ranging from @xmath141 to @xmath142 .",
    "the nature of the curves are qualitatively similar to what the best fit value for @xmath127 obtains .",
    "next we consider the dynamics on the other side of the transition when the density correlation function freezes to a constant until ergodicity restoring processes take over . in the glassy state ,",
    "the nep @xmath120 is estimated from the plateau which @xmath116 reaches over long time .",
    "5 displays the variation of @xmath120 with the ratio @xmath1 .",
    "the nonergodic behavior and the elastic response of the supercooled liquid as seen here are valid over initial time scales for which the system is frozen and is solid like .",
    "however estimating the fragility parameter @xmath0 directly involves computing the temperature dependence of viscosity or relaxation time near @xmath3 .",
    "as already pointed out , the long time dynamics in the deeply supercooled state close to @xmath3 is still beyond the scope of mct .",
    "our calculation of the nep at low temperatures here only refer to intermediate time scales up to which the present description in terms of the supercooled liquid is valid . therefore in order to link fragility @xmath0 with the elastic properties of the supercooled liquid we make use of the dependence of the fragility @xmath0 on the nep @xmath120 as inferred from analysis of experimental data @xcite . in fig .",
    "6 the data points and best fit curve for the experimental results linking nep @xmath120 with the fragility @xmath0 , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath143 , is shown .",
    "the nep values noted here are taken at the glass transition temperature @xmath3 @xcite . to test this empirical relation",
    "further we compare the @xmath144 vs. @xmath0 in the inset of fig . 6 with another set of experimental data @xcite from x - ray brillouin scattering .",
    "similar qualitative behavior is seen validating the link between the nep with the fragility .",
    "the dependence of @xmath0 on the ratio @xmath1 of elastic constants is then obtained through their common dependence on the nep @xmath120 .",
    "the variation of @xmath0 with @xmath1 is shown in fig .",
    "we also display the experimental data ( from which the linear relation of ref .",
    "@xcite was proposed ) in the same figure , showing reasonable agreement with the predictions of the present model . in reaching this agreement between the theoretical model and experimental data we adjust the temperature dependent parameter @xmath130 to the value 1.7 . as argued above @xmath130",
    "is proportional to @xmath128 and hence if we assume near @xmath3 , @xmath145 , then @xmath146 obtains the best fit of the present model s predictions with results of ref .",
    "@xcite . to demonstrate the sensitivity of the results on the values of the adjusted parameters we display in fig 7 .",
    "( as in fig 4 for @xmath137 ) the fragility @xmath0 vs @xmath139 g curve for different values of @xmath140 ranging from @xmath141 to @xmath142 .",
    "@xmath147 value is kept same for all the curves _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath148 .",
    "usually fragility index measurements refer to the slope of the viscosity vs. inverse temperature plot at the calorimetric glass transition temperature @xmath3 .",
    "hence the parameter @xmath130 has been kept fixed here .",
    "the roughly linear behavior of the @xmath0 vs. @xmath1 curve is retained over the whole range of the value of the parameter @xmath140 .",
    "the variations of @xmath120 and @xmath0 with @xmath1 as displayed in the fig . 5 and 7 respectively are obtained at this same fixed value for @xmath130 . with the variation of @xmath1 ,",

    "increasing value of @xmath1 we move to regions of small values of the couplings @xmath104 and @xmath105 .",
    "finally we make two predictions using the proposed model linking the elastic behavior with relaxation properties in the glassy systems .",
    "according to the present model the density correlation function @xmath116 has a complex relaxation behavior .",
    "on the ergodic side of the transition line , the initial power law relaxations change over to a stretched exponential decay with a stretching exponent @xmath149 . as a further illustration of the present model",
    ", we display in fig .",
    "8 the variation of the stretching exponent @xmath149 with the poisson s ratio @xmath110 $ ] . for the results shown here we keep @xmath130 fixed at a typical liquid state value @xmath150 .",
    "it should be noted that following the discussion above the @xmath149 presented here corresponds to temperatures much above @xmath3 .",
    "on the other hand for computing the fragility @xmath0 vs. poisson s ratio @xmath109 in terms of the non ergodicity parameter @xmath120 , as described above in fig . 5 - 7 , we work on the nonergodic side of the transition line , _ i.e. _ in the glassy phase where the freezing of the density correlation function is clearly visible ( @xmath151 ) .",
    "we do not have in the present mode coupling model a way of computing the @xmath149 in this low temperature regime which will require taking into account the role of ergodicity restoring mechanisms in the long time dynamics .",
    "hence the predicted behavior of the stretching exponent should be tested at higher temperatures away from @xmath3 .",
    "another suitable quantity is the power law exponent of relaxation near @xmath3 . on the nonergodic side of transition line , the system",
    "is dynamically frozen initially until the ergodicity restoring processes take over . for initial time scales ( beyond the microscopic times )",
    "the density correlation function develops a plateau @xmath120 with a power law form @xmath152 decay . from the present model we are able to predict the dependence of the power law exponent @xmath153 on the @xmath1 ratio .",
    "9 displays the dependence of the exponent @xmath153 on @xmath1 .",
    "the inset shows the nature of the power law behavior at a particular value of @xmath154 .",
    "the curve is obtained at @xmath155 .",
    "according to the predictions of the present model the power law exponent grows sharply for less fragile systems indicating a sharper freezing of the system over intermediate time scales for strong liquids .",
    "the present model for the amorphous system is constructed in terms of an extended set of slow modes . the approximations which go into the present formulation of the dynamics for the solid like state are well known and standard . in order to define the slow variable which accounts for the solid like nature of the amorphous state , we require reference to a rigid lattice . on the other hand",
    "the ergodicity restoring process in the system invalidates the existence of any such rigid structure over longest time scales .",
    "therefore the elastic description of the liquid is only valid up to the time scale of structural relaxation . a self - consistent treatment with dynamic connections between the elastic and viscous behavior of the system",
    "will possibly provide a way to make a unified description including both of the above two aspects of the glassy state .",
    "furthermore , the atoms in the solid vibrate around the random lattice sites over intermediate time scales . generally strong glassy systems have a higher network forming tendency than the highly fragile systems @xcite . in the latter structural degradation",
    "occurs more easily .",
    "thus for systems with very high @xmath0 values the underlying assumptions of the present model hold for shorter time scales .",
    "the present model which considers the relation of the fragility of the liquid to its elastic properties brings out some basic characteristics of the dynamics . in fig .",
    "7 we se that the increase in the fragility @xmath0 corresponds to higher values of the ratio @xmath1 while from fig .",
    "2 it follows that coupling @xmath104 and @xmath105 between the slow modes is weaker for larger values of this ratio .",
    "therefore the trend of the experimental data indicates that in a more fragile system there is a weaker coupling of the hydrodynamic modes .",
    "this is particularly relevant since the coupling between the slow modes constitutes ( through the formulation of the mode coupling theories ) the basic mechanism for slow dynamics in supercooled liquids . also , since it follows from the present theory that larger values of @xmath1 give rise to lower values of the nonergodicity parameter , the strength of the freezing or jamming of the system is weaker in more fragile systems .",
    "it is important to note that the present model is formulated for the case of simple liquids and accordingly it is expected to apply to only specific types of systems .",
    "the relation between @xmath0 and @xmath1 stated by sokolov and novikov is based on the data analysis of non metallic and non -polymeric systems@xcite .",
    "efforts to apply this scaling to a wider group including metallic glasses or multi component systems fail @xcite for obvious reasons .",
    "polymeric materials also clearly deviate from this linear relation .",
    "monomers follow similar correlations , but increase in the chain length in some polymers leads to the deviations @xcite .",
    "the model similar to the one used here having the memory kernel with both linear and quadratic terms has been initially proposed in ref .",
    "however the present form of the @xmath118 ( having direct relation to the elastic constants ) is only justified by including the displacement variable for the amorphous solid @xcite in the theoretical description . in this regard",
    "it is useful to note that the past literature on mct can be broadly divided into two different groups . in one approach the dynamics of a supercooled liquid",
    "is studied starting from the basic equations which apply to the liquid state or crystalline state of matter .",
    "this is the scheme we have followed in our analysis here .",
    "the set of nonlinear equations we have considered for constructing the mode coupling equations in the present context are a ) the conservation laws for the mass and momentum and b ) the dynamical equation for the extra slow modes for the solid like state .",
    "the resulting model linking the non ergodic behavior to the elastic properties then follows through a careful consideration of the nonlinearities in the dynamics .",
    "the present model thus extends the standard mct in a physically relevant manner to include the solid like nature of the supercooled state .",
    "on the other hand the mct literature also have schematic models in which ad - hoc forms of memory functions are simply assumed in order to consider different types of possible relaxation scenarios which follow from the nonlinear feed back mechanism .",
    "it is only in this respect the present model is technically similar to the schematic @xmath156 mct studied by gtze .",
    "finally , we have ignored here the wave vector dependence of the model to focus on the basic feed back mechanism .",
    "the parameter @xmath130 has been treated as a temperature dependent parameter ( @xmath157 ) in the model .",
    "the temperature and density dependence of the results should follow in a natural way when such extensions of the model are considered .",
    "this calculation will require implementing the proper structure factor of the liquid in the formulation and will be considered elsewhere .",
