    "powerful outflows from star  forming galaxies have been detected throughout the history of the universe ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) , providing , perhaps , the mechanism to transport metals from the interstellar medium ( ism ) of galaxies to the low density intergalactic medium ( igm ) .",
    "this could at least partially explain the widespread level of chemical enrichment observed in the spectra of quasars ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the energy necessary to power outflows on galactic scales is supplied by supernova explosions and winds from young massive stars in ob associations .",
    "any episode of star formation may create a superbubble in the ism and , if the rate of energy input is large enough , the superbubble can blow out of the ism and create a wind . in local starbursts ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) , winds",
    "have been observed to extend to at least 10 kpc from their host galaxies .",
    "@xcite claim that winds can reach even larger distances , but are unobservable because of the low emissivity of the outflowing gas .    at present",
    ", it is difficult to predict which galaxies are responsible for seeding the igm with metals or to establish the effects that supernova  driven blastwaves have on the galaxy formation process . while gravity does not influence the evolution of superbubbles in the ism , it is crucial for determining the long term fate of winds .",
    "since winds from dwarf galaxies form in shallower potential wells , they are the most likely to be able to disperse their metal content into the igm .",
    "on the other hand , @xcite suggest that most of the energy from winds resides in a hot ( @xmath7 k ) low density component that can escape the galaxies even when the bulk of the outflowing mass is retained .",
    "@xcite demonstrate that metals are easily accelerated to velocities larger than the escape velocity , implying that a galaxy can lose a high fraction of its metals even with a relatively low mass ejection efficiency .",
    "although winds may occur more frequently in dwarf galaxies , the metals ejected by massive galaxies may dominate the total budget .",
    "it is therefore not a trivial problem to assess which galaxies have been responsible for the pollution of the igm and when the enrichment occurred .",
    "several groups have applied simple phenomenological prescriptions to simulations in order to investigate the effects of winds on the igm and some important results have emerged .",
    "for example , @xcite find that pregalactic outflows are an efficient mechanism for distributing the metals produced in stars over large cosmological volumes , prior to the reionisation epoch .",
    "@xcite argue that radiation pressure ejection or winds from relatively large galaxies at lower redshifts can account for the observed metallicity of the igm and the intracluster medium . @xcite and @xcite",
    "demonstrate that cavities evacuated by winds in the outskirts of galaxies may leave characteristic signatures in the ly@xmath6 forest .",
    "in contrast , @xcite find that winds have little effect on the statistics of h i absorption lines and produce c iv absorption lines in reasonable agreement with observations .",
    "the significance of galactic winds for the evolution of the igm is still not fully established , however .",
    "both hydrodynamic and semi ",
    "analytic simulations use phenomenological prescriptions for the physics of galactic winds and new parameters have to be introduced to account for the uncertainties that derive from a still uncomplete observational picture .",
    "in particular , no well founded relation is available to link the properties of the ism and the morphology of its host galaxy to the structure and evolution of the outflows .",
    "because of insufficient resolution and incomplete physics , numerical results often disagree with each other and the effects of winds on the ly@xmath6 forest remain controversial , leaving the way open for further studies .    in this paper , we present a new implementation of the physics of galactic winds within the semi  analytic galaxy formation model of @xcite , and we apply it to a set of high resolution n  body simulations of structure formation in a @xmath0cdm universe ( @xcite , @xcite ) . by using a high resolution simulation of a spherical region of diameter 52 @xmath8 mpc , we investigate the long term evolution of winds and their effects on a typical region of the igm .",
    "we solve the equation of motion for a spherical astrophysical blastwave to follow the evolution of winds after they escape the visible regions of galaxies .",
    "our phenomenological model for winds uses the initial conditions proposed by @xcite , which parameterise the mass loss and the initial velocity of winds as a function of the star formation rate of the galaxy . here",
    "we follow the evolution of galactic winds throughout most of the history of the universe and we outline their impact on the igm by estimating the fraction of volume and mass of the igm which they affect as a function of time and model parameters .",
    "this paper is organised as follows : in section [ due ] we present our set of high resolution n - body simulations and the semi  analytic prescriptions we adopt to model the physics of galactic winds ; in section [ tre ] we outline some global properties of winds as a function of the model parameters ; in sections [ quattro ] and [ budget ] we present the results for the volume filling factor and the fraction of mass affected by winds and in section [ ejection ] our findings for the ejection of metals into the igm ; finally , in section [ mares ] we discuss the dependence of our results on the numerical resolution of the simulations and we draw our conclusions in section [ cinque ] .",
    "here we describe our set of high resolution n  body simulations .",
    "later subsections present the prescriptions we adopt for the physics of galactic winds and their numerical implementation .",
    "we assume a @xmath0cdm cosmology with matter density @xmath9 , dark energy density @xmath10 , hubble constant @xmath11 , primordial spectral index @xmath12 and normalisation @xmath13 .",
    "the use of pure n  body simulations allows us to find a good compromise between high mass resolution and a large simulated volume , although this choice implies that the physics of baryons can not be followed directly .",
    "a high resolution in mass is crucial to determine the role of galaxies with different masses in polluting the igm with metals , while a large region is necessary to study the effects of winds in their proper cosmological context .",
    "our simulations are resimulations at higher resolution of a `` typical '' spherical region with a diameter of approximately 52 @xmath8 mpc and average density close to the cosmic mean .",
    "about half of the enclosed galaxies at @xmath14 are field galaxies , while the rest are in groups and poor clusters .",
    "the simulated region was identified within the much larger cosmological `` vls '' simulation run by the virgo consortium ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "it was resimulated four times with increasing internal mass resolution and decreased external resolution .",
    "the effects of the large scale gravity field on the region of interest are thus correctly retained .",
    "the mass of the dark matter particles in the high resolution region of `` m3 '' is @xmath15 m@xmath3 and the number of particles about @xmath16 .",
    "the initial conditions were generated with zic @xcite and the simulations were performed using the parallel treecode gadget @xcite .",
    "the dark matter evolution was followed from redshift @xmath17 down to redshift @xmath14 and 52 simulation outputs were stored between @xmath18 and @xmath14 .",
    "the formation and evolution of galaxies is modelled with the semi  analytic technique proposed by @xcite in the new implementation by @xcite .",
    "merging trees extracted from the simulations are used to follow the galaxy population in time , while simple prescriptions for gas cooling , star formation and galaxy merging model the processes involving the baryonic component of the galaxies .",
    "both the spectrophotometric evolution of the stellar population and the morphological evolution of the galaxies can thus be modelled in detail .",
    "dark matter haloes and subhaloes are identified with the algorithm subfind @xcite and a catalogue is compiled with all the groups and subhaloes that contain at least ten particles , meaning that for m3 the minimum dark matter mass of a subhalo is @xmath19 m@xmath3 . at @xmath4 a total of about four hundred thousand galaxies are identified and about three hundred fifty thousand are present at @xmath14 .",
    "the two largest clusters , each with a total mass of about @xmath20 m@xmath3 , assemble most of their mass after @xmath21 .",
    "the convergence of the star formation history in the `` m '' series of simulations has been investigated by @xcite .",
    "they show that the lower the mass resolution , the later in time the simulations are able to account for all the star formation in the region , since at redshifts higher than @xmath22 the major contribution comes from objects with total masses of order @xmath23 m@xmath3 , while only at lower redshifts do more massive objects appear and become dominant . by comparing the results of the star formation history of m3 with a higher resolution cluster simulation by @xcite , ciardi and collaborators estimate that m3 is able to account for most of the star formation at @xmath24 .      in our model ,",
    "new recipes for mechanical feedback from supernovae are introduced in order to include the physics of galactic winds .",
    "@xcite and @xcite find that a simple recipe for feedback , implemented in the so  called `` ejection '' scheme , is sufficient to give reasonable predictions for some observed properties of galaxies , e.g. the suppression of star formation in low mass haloes and the slope of the tully  fisher relation .",
    "however , the simplicity of this prescription makes it impossible to follow in detail the evolution of galactic winds .",
    "in particular , the scheme does not describe the diffusion of the matter and metals lost by galaxies , because there are no recipes for following the evolution of wind ejecta .",
    "this is what we aim to provide in this paper .",
    "here we use the semi  analytic model of @xcite with the implementation of the ejection scheme , to follow the evolution of the cold gas and the stellar component of the galaxies .",
    "we add our recipes for winds on top of this pre  existing scheme , without modifying its prescriptions .",
    "this is not fully consistent , because we do not modify the cooling and the infall prescriptions in the semi  analytic code to match our new model for the immediate surroundings of galaxies .",
    "one consequence of this is that the total metal and gas mass in our simulated region is not exactly conserved .",
    "however , violations are minor",
    ".    since we want to investigate the effects of winds on the igm by applying our model to a large simulated region , we are neither able nor interested to resolve the details of the first phases of wind evolution , when the superbubbles blow out of the ism of galaxies . nor do we model the impact of the outflow on the physical conditions of the ism in the host galaxy . here",
    ", we are concerned with the long  term evolution of the winds once they have escaped the visible regions of galaxies .",
    "we make the simplifying assumption of spherical symmetry for the wind evolution .",
    "galactic outflows observed in nearby galaxies appear to be mostly bipolar @xcite , with the gas escaping preferentially along the direction where the gravitational potential gradient is steeper .",
    "however , observations of high redshift objects ( @xcite , @xcite ) suggest that most galaxies are affected by large scale winds implying near spherical outflows . together with the fact that an initially nonspherical bubble approaches sphericity at later times @xcite , this suggests that our symmetry assumption may be appropriate .    the thermal energy injected by supernova explosions is converted to kinetic energy and the outflow remains approximately adiabatic until radiative losses become substantial . during the adiabatic phase of the evolution , radiative losses are negligible and the expansion of the bubble is driven by the pressure of the hot plasma , which acts as a piston on the surrounding medium .",
    "the outflow can be described as an adiabatic blastwave expanding into a cosmologically structured context , and its dynamics obeys a virial theorem as stated by @xcite .",
    "this phase typically happens during the early evolution of winds immediately after blow out , when a newly formed bubble starts expanding into the galactic halo , the mass of ejecta is larger or comparable to the mass of the swept up gas and the cooling time of the hot gas within the bubble is longer than the age of the wind .",
    "observationally , @xcite and @xcite have proved that the energy lost through radiative cooling of the coronal ( @xmath25 k ) and the hot ( @xmath26 k ) phases of the wind in the starburst galaxy m82 is small , supporting the idea that the early evolution of this wind is nearly adiabatic .",
    "the interior of a hot bubble is made up of two phases : a hot phase which we assume to have roughly uniform temperature and pressure , and dense gas falling in from surrounding `` filaments '' . in our model ,",
    "the hot phase is a mixture of shocked wind gas , of shocked low density ambient gas and of denser ambient gas stripped from the infalling gas clouds .",
    "the shocked wind gas is in turn made up of sn ejecta and of entrained interstellar medium outflowing from the galaxy . in their sph simulations ,",
    "@xcite find that winds expand anisotropically into low density regions and that although a significant fraction of the gas from infalling filaments is `` entrained '' ( i.e. mixed into the hot phase ) most remains cool and dense .",
    "@xcite also find no clear radial stratification of the phases within the bubble : the supersonic outflow region of the wind fills a very small volume near the galaxy and there is no clear separation between shocked wind gas , shocked diffuse ambient gas , and initially denser ambient gas `` entrained '' into the hot phase after filaments are engulfed by the bubble .",
    "no significant cool , dense shell forms near the outer shock radius .",
    "the adiabatic phase is terminated when the loss of energy by radiation becomes substantial , that is most of the energy transferred to the swept up gas is radiated away and the total energy content of the hot bubble decreases .",
    "this phase sets in when the cooling time of the hot bubble becomes shorter than the age of the wind . at this point",
    ", a thin shell of cooled gas forms near the bubble s outer boundary and continues to expand pushed by the momentum input from the wind .    in our simulations , we model galactic winds as uniform pressure  driven bubbles of hot gas emerging from star forming galaxies , which evolve adiabatically until their cooling time becomes shorter than their dynamical expansion time . after this moment",
    ", we switch to a momentum  driven approximation and we assume that the mass swept up by the wind accumulates in a thin cooled shell pushed by the momentum accreted from the wind . during this second phase , both the thin shell and the bubble interior",
    "are cool .",
    "according to @xcite , under the assumption of negligible energy losses , the equation for the conservation of energy of a spherical bubble with energy injection at the origin is @xmath27 \\left ( v_s - v_o \\right ) - v_o p_o \\right\\ } .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    here @xmath28 and @xmath29 are the radius and the velocity of the shock , @xmath30 and @xmath31 the mass outflow rate and the outflow velocity of the wind , @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 the density , the pressure and the outward velocity of the surrounding medium , @xmath35 the total mass internal to the shock radius and @xmath36 a parameter , the entrainment fraction , defining the fraction of mass that the bubble sweeps up while crossing the ambient medium .",
    "the first term on the right hand side is the energy injected by the starburst , while the terms in brackets represent the energy variation due to the accretion of gas onto the bubble .",
    "the newly entrained gas mass contributes its kinetic ( @xmath37 ) , internal ( @xmath38 ) and potential ( @xmath39 ) energy to the total energy in the bubble , but it requires work to be accelerated against the pressure forces of the surrounding medium ( @xmath40 ) .",
    "we neglect the gravitational energy transfer to the dark matter component , which is small and does not significantly change the energy budget . for the conservation of mass law ,",
    "the total mass in the bubble @xmath41 is the sum of the outflowing wind mass plus the swept  up mass : @xmath42 the radius of the shocked bubble is given by @xmath43 .    at blow out ,",
    "that is when the wind escapes the galactic disk or spheroid , we assume that a bubble is formed initially with a radius equal to the galaxy radius @xmath44 ( @xmath45 ) , no mass ( @xmath46 ) and velocity equal to the wind velocity ( @xmath47 ) . after blow out ,",
    "the bubble starts to accumulate gas . since our semi  analytic model",
    "does not follow the internal structure of galaxies , we have to make a further assumption for the galaxy radius , in order to link it to the properties of the dark matter halo in which the galaxy is embedded .",
    "thus we fix @xmath44 to be a given fraction of the virial radius of the dm halo , e.g. @xmath48 .",
    "this choice gives values in rough agreement with the observed radii of galaxies at all redshifts .",
    "equations for the evolution of winds in the thin shell approximation have previously been used in similar work by @xcite and @xcite . as noted by @xcite ,",
    "the approximation of a thin shell holds for radiatively cooled blastwaves and for blastwaves expanding in the hubble flow , but it is not applicable to adiabatic blastwaves evolving in a static or infalling medium . beside the different formalism",
    "used to describe the winds , we make different assumptions for the initialisation of the bubble properties , which we think are more realistic than those of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "@xcite fix the initial conditions at the virial radius and assume that the initial shell mass is equal to @xmath49 .",
    "this choice implies that winds blow out all the baryonic mass of the galaxy , including its stars .",
    "the evolution of winds in the outskirts of galaxies immediately after blow out is crucial for determining their ability to escape the gravitational attraction of haloes .",
    "thus , following the evolution of winds only for @xmath50 may neglect an important stage in their formation which could significantly affect the reliability of the final results .",
    "@xcite set initial conditions for the shell mass by choosing a radius @xmath51 to include a fixed fraction @xmath52 of the galaxy mass .",
    "the initial shell mass is therefore @xmath53 , but it is not clear why , when computing wind evolution , a significant fraction of the galaxy mass should be assumed to be already in the shell when the wind emerges from the galaxy .    during the phase of adiabatic expansion , the pressure of the hot shocked bubble can be expressed as a function of the bubble energy , that is @xmath54 given the bubble pressure @xmath55 , a simple estimate of the bubble temperature is then @xmath56 with @xmath57 the mean molecular weight , @xmath58 the mass of atomic hydrogen and @xmath59 the boltzmann constant . at blow out ,",
    "most of the bubbles have temperatures in excess of @xmath60 k. during the subsequent adiabatic evolution , the bubble temperature is determined by two competing processes : it decreases because of the adiabatic expansion of the bubble and it increases because of the energy injected by the starburst .",
    "the adiabatic expansion continues until the cooling time of the hot shocked bubble becomes shorter than the age of the wind .",
    "we calculate the cooling time of bubbles as a function of their temperature @xmath61 , mean density @xmath62 and metallicity @xmath63 as : @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the total ion density and @xmath66 is the metal dependent cooling function of @xcite . for most bubbles at blow out ,",
    "the cooling time is at least one order of magnitude larger than the age .",
    "when the wind expands into a high density environment , the cooling time decreases steadily with time and soon the wind makes the transition to a momentum driven shell .",
    "this happens particularly often at high redshift , where the mean density of the universe is higher and the energy provided by star formation smaller .",
    "another important factor that determines the shortening of the cooling time is the mass loading of winds : the higher the mass loading efficiency , the higher the bubble density , the shorter the cooling time . we find that the cooling time of a bubble normally becomes shorter than the dynamical expansion time after the swept - up mass exceeds the mass of wind ejecta .",
    "when a bubble becomes radiative , the expansion work done on the ambient medium is radiated away , at the expenses of the total energy of the bubble . from this point",
    "onward , the dynamics of the wind is dominated by the momentum imparted onto the thin shell of cooled material by the outflowing hot gas .",
    "the equation of motion for the spherically symmetric thin shell that accumulates mass at the shock radius is given by the conservation of momentum : @xmath67,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath68 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 the mass , the radius and the velocity of the shell respectively .",
    "the first term on the right  hand side of the equation represents the momentum injected by the starburst , the second term takes into account the gravitational attraction of the dark matter halo and the two final terms represent the thermal and the ram pressure of the surrounding medium .",
    "the conservation of mass law gives @xmath69 while the radius of the shell is again given by the equation @xmath43 .      at present , both semi ",
    "analytic and sph simulations use empirical prescriptions for the physics of galactic winds and the velocity and the mass outflow rate are assumed as parameters ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "this approach has proved useful , although the simulated results depend sensitively and in a complex fashion on the choice of the parameters .",
    "@xcite proposed a more detailed model that links the wind to the star formation properties of galaxies .",
    "they start from two observational facts : ( i ) the outflow rate in galaxies at every redshift is of the order of the star formation rate @xcite and ( ii ) the initial wind velocities seem to be independent of the galaxy morphologies ( @xcite , @xcite ) and lie in the range 1001500 km s@xmath70 . by using the theoretical models of @xcite and @xcite , they predict the mass outflow rate @xmath30 and the wind velocity @xmath31 at blow out as a function of the star formation rate @xmath71 of the host galaxy , @xmath72    @xmath73    where @xmath74 is a constant that takes into account various properties of the ism .",
    "it depends on the efficiency of conduction relative to the thermal conductivity of clouds , on the minimum radius of clouds in the ism and on the dimensions of star  forming regions ( see @xcite for a comprehensive discussion ) . in the following",
    ", we will call the ratio between the wind mass loss rate and the star formation rate the `` ejection rate '' @xmath75 of the wind .",
    "note that the momentum input @xmath76 in this model is only weakly dependent on @xmath74 ( @xmath77 ) , with a stronger dependence on the star formation rate ( @xmath78 ) .",
    "the energy input per unit of star formation rate is completely independent of @xmath74 and therefore of all other galaxy properties .",
    "@xcite give a number of arguments in support of this very simple model which is quite similar to the earlier model of @xcite .",
    "the theoretical predictions can be fine  tuned to reproduce the observations with reasonable accuracy both for the mass loss rate and the wind velocity . in order to make our predictions consistent with the observations of @xcite",
    ", we fix a maximum value for the ejection rate of @xmath79 .",
    "equations ( [ cond1 ] ) and ( [ cond2 ] ) tend to overestimate @xmath80 for low values of the star formation rate . in the following ,",
    "we choose as our fiducial value @xmath81 and we investigate two more models with @xmath82 and @xmath83 . since the overall effect of @xmath74 on the results is mostly weaker than the one of the entrainment fraction , we concentrate our analysis on the other parameter . however , we remind the reader that variations in @xmath74 do produce an appreciable degeneracy in the results .",
    "the metallicity of the wind fluid depends both on the amount of metals ejected by supernovae and on the metallicity of the ism .",
    "in fact , the mass ejected by winds is the sum of two components : the metal enriched stellar ejecta from supernova explosions and the shocked ism entrained in the outflow .",
    "the latter represents the major fraction of the mass lost by the galaxy , constituting about 90% of the ejecta , for a mass loss rate comparable to the star formation rate . assuming for star formation a mass yield @xmath84 , corresponding to the fraction of mass converted into stars that is returned to the ism by supernova explosions , then the mass of outflowing gas which is entrained ism is @xmath85",
    "similarly , the metal mass in the wind fluid is the sum of the metals ejected by supernovae , whose metal yield is @xmath86 , and the metals in the shocked ism @xmath87,\\ ] ] where @xmath88 is the metallicity of the ism . in our semi  analytic model ,",
    "galaxies are schematically represented as a disc of cold gas , which constitutes the ism of the galaxy , surrounded by a halo of hot gas .",
    "the total mass of metals accreted by a bubble during its adiabatic expansion reflects the form of the mass conservation equation ( [ monster1 ] ) and is the sum of the metals accreted from the wind fluid and the metals accreted from the ambient medium : @xmath89 with @xmath90 the metallicity of the hot gas .",
    "the second term indicates the amount of metals swept up by the wind in the halo of the galaxy or of the galaxy group and does not give any contribution for bubbles that are expanding far into the igm , since the igm itself is assumed to contain no metals .",
    "the metal mass accreted by a shell during the momentum driven expansion reflects the form of equation ( [ monster2 ] ) and contains one more multiplicative factor that takes into account the actual amount of wind material that is accreted onto the shell : @xmath91      once a wind is formed , it expands through the halo of its host galaxy and , if it is energetic enough , it can escape the gravitational attraction of the halo and break out into the igm .",
    "the winds attached to galaxies in groups are subject to the gravitational field of the group and the closer a galaxy lies to the centre of a massive group , the more energetic the wind has to be to be able to escape the potential well .    when simulating the evolution of the winds , it is therefore important to know the density distribution of the gas into which the winds expand .",
    "our semi  analytic prescriptions provide this information by assuming that inside dark matter haloes the gas follows the distribution of the dark matter .",
    "we model the gravitational field of haloes and their gas distribution by using @xcite profiles ( nfw ) @xmath92 where the characteristic overdensity @xmath93 is given by : @xmath94 and where we choose the concentration parameter @xmath95 as our fiducial value .",
    "the scale radius @xmath96 is the ratio @xmath97 and the function @xmath98 is given by : @xmath99    inside haloes , the gas density is normalised to the total amount of hot gas given by the semi  analytic recipes of @xcite , that is @xmath100 . for galaxies in groups or clusters ,",
    "we follow the density profile of the galactic halo until its density equals the density of the parent halo , where the dynamics of the group becomes dominant .",
    "similarly , the density profile of the group is followed until the wind reaches the point where the dark matter halo density becomes equal to a fixed fraction of the mean universal density .",
    "after this point , the gas density is assumed to be constant and equal to 0.8 times the baryonic mean density .",
    "the velocity of the surrounding medium @xmath34 is calculated assuming that the gas dynamics is dominated by infall close to galaxies and by the hubble flow at larger distances .",
    "the outward @xmath34 is therefore given by the sum of two contributions : @xmath101 where the escape velocity @xmath102 at a radius @xmath28 for a nfw profile is @xmath103    when the velocity of the shock front equals the velocity of the intergalactic gas , the dynamics of the wind joins the hubble flow and no more mass is accreted .    for winds expanding into the igm",
    ", the pressure of the ambient medium @xmath33 is given by the equation of state for an adiabatic gas , @xmath104 , where @xmath105 is the sound speed of the igm and @xmath106 is the adiabatic index for a monoatomic gas .",
    "for winds expanding inside haloes , we make the assumption that the gas behaves like an isothermal gas sphere with temperature @xcite @xmath107 where @xmath57 is the molecular weight , @xmath58 the hydrogen mass , @xmath108 the virial velocity of the halo and @xmath59 the boltzmann constant .",
    "the pressure of the intracluster gas at radius @xmath28 can then be recovered from the equation of state , which gives @xmath109    the entrainment fraction @xmath36 represents the fraction of the medium surrounding the bubbles that is swept up by the wind and mixed into the bubble fluid or accreted onto the shell .",
    "@xmath36 is treated here as a constant free parameter for simplicity , but in principle there is no reason why it should not vary during the evolution of the winds .",
    "what we are calling `` entrained '' gas is not the entrained ism which loads observed winds near their base , but is rather ambient gas which has mixed into the hot bubble phase either through turbulent mixing of shocked diffuse ambient gas or by evaporation and ablation of the filament gas , most of which continues falling onto the galaxy .",
    "the latter process is similar to that which is thought to load ism mass onto stellar winds and supernova blastwaves . both observations ( e.g. @xcite ) and simulations @xcite suggest that the entrained mass may be the dominant contribution to the hot gas mass within a wind bubble .    the remaining fraction of mass @xmath110 is assumed to be in dense clouds which are not entrained by the outflow .",
    "a low value @xmath111 may reflect either a clumpy ambient medium or a heavily fragmented wind , while @xmath112 describes a near  homogeneous medium , which can be entirely swept up .",
    "this parameter is of particular relevance because it plays a key role in determining the fate of the wind : the mass accretion rate depends on @xmath36 and the larger the mass accreted onto the wind , the bigger the energy required to accelerate it .",
    "the ram pressure increases linearly with @xmath36 , again influencing the energetics of the winds .",
    "the net effect of an increase in the entrainment fraction is thus a decrease in the shock velocity , which may lead to the collapse of the wind if the energy input from the starburst is not sufficiently large .",
    "since the shock velocity is what ultimately determines how far into the igm the winds travel , a large variation of the volume filling factor is expected as @xmath36 varies .",
    "we will analyse this aspect further in section [ quattro ] .",
    "when two galaxies merge , we assume that also their winds `` merge '' .",
    "if only one galaxy is blowing a wind , then its wind will be attached to the merged galaxy without modifications .",
    "the merging of bubbles and shells is realised by assuming conservation of volume , mass , momentum and energy .",
    "conservation of mass requires the final mass @xmath68 of the new bubble ( shell ) to be the sum of the masses @xmath113 and @xmath114 of the two merging winds , that is @xmath115 .",
    "similarly , the metal mass in the merged wind is @xmath116 and the total energy @xmath117 .",
    "conservation of volume requires that the total volume @xmath118 of the final wind cavity is equal to the sum of the volumes of the two single cavities @xmath119 .",
    "since winds are spherical , the new shock radius is @xmath120 .",
    "the shock velocity is given by the conservation of momentum : @xmath121",
    "in this section we will discuss the evolution of winds and how our results depend on our model parameters . in subsection [ onegal ]",
    "we show the evolution of a wind emerging from a dwarf field galaxy and in subsection [ allg ] we focus on the population of wind bubbles and shells . in subsection",
    "[ trends ] we discuss the general results and in subsection [ pm ] we deal with bubbles and shells .",
    "born winds expand initially inside the dark matter haloes in which their host galaxies reside . since the amount of gas in haloes depends on the efficiency of cooling and",

    "such a wind has thus a higher probability to overcome the gravitational pull and break free from the halo than more mass loaded winds . when the mass loading is substantial ,",
    "a significant part of the wind energy is consumed to accelerate the entrained gas and the expansion slows down . if the amount of energy spent to accelerate the swept up mass is large compared to the total energy in the wind , the shock velocity may become lower than the escape velocity of the galaxy . in this case",
    ", the wind can not escape and collapses back onto the galaxy .    in models with efficient mass loading",

    "to make the situation worse , the energy input in low mass galaxies is often not as large as in more massive ones , due to a less intense star formation activity .",

    "these merged winds may receive a strong kick from the burst of star formation that follows the merger and the resulting wind energy may be high enough to allow the wind to escape the gravitational pull of the central galaxy .",
    "it is likely that if a massive galaxy is blowing a wind , then that wind started before most of the halo mass was accreted and the wind was expelled to a large radius at early times . on the other hand ,",
    "winds from massive galaxies may reach large distances in relatively short times if they are powered by an intense burst of star formation .",
    "we now want to investigate how pressure driven bubbles and momentum driven shells coexist in our simulations and under which conditions a bubble evolves into a shell .",

    "although this result is strongly parameter dependent , it is clear that at @xmath179 a significant fraction of the metals resides in a hot gas that would leave no footprint in the ly@xmath6  forest .",
    "this result may support the idea that the igm is enriched to a higher level than ly@xmath6  observations can prove , but that the metals blown out of galaxies by galactic winds are in many cases too hot to produce any detectable absorption in the spectra of quasars .",

    "heated by galactic winds as well as from the process of structure formation or jets from active galaxies .",

    "we want now to investigate the effect of the resolution in mass of our n ",
    "body simulations in determining the volume filling factor and the fraction of igm mass affected by winds . to do this ,",
    "we compare the results obtained from our four sets of simulations with increasing mass resolution .",
    "while a large population of dwarf galaxies is already forming at @xmath181 in m3 , only a few objects are assembling in m2 at the same epoch and in the lower resolution runs m1 and m0 the first galaxies appear only at @xmath182 and @xmath183 , respectively .",
    "the total number of galaxies in m3 is five times as large as in m2 at @xmath14 and the number of galaxies with winds two times as large .    in fig .",
    "[ mfilling ] we show the volume filling factor ( top panel ) and the fraction of mass affected by winds ( lower panel ) in the m1 , m2 and m3 simulation sets .",
    "the results are shown for a model with parameters @xmath184 and @xmath130 .",
    "we find that at high redshift @xmath143 and @xmath153 strongly depend on the mass resolution and on the ability to resolve galaxies which form in haloes with total masses of about @xmath185 m@xmath3 .",
    "these galaxies , only resolved in m3 , include galaxies with both low and intermediate stellar masses , field galaxies and satellites .",
    "( upper panel ) and of the fraction of mass affected by winds @xmath153 ( lower panel ) on the mass resolution of the dark matter n  body simulations .",
    "the results are for a model with parameters @xmath184 and @xmath130 and the lines represent respectively three of our simulation sets : ( 1 ) solid line : m3 , @xmath186 m@xmath3 ; ( 2 ) dotted line : m2 , @xmath187 m@xmath3 ; ( 3 ) dashed line : m1 , @xmath188 m@xmath3 .",
    "the large galaxies resolved in m0 do not give any significant contribution at any redshift.,width=8 ]    at @xmath189 the results for the different sets of simulations converge .",
    "this is an indication of the fact that dwarf galaxies are mainly responsible for the pollution of the igm at high redshift , but that their relative contribution becomes smaller at very low redshift , when more massive galaxies become the main sources of powerful winds and can account for most of the mass and metals ejected into the igm .    despite the convergence of the global star formation in our simulated region ( cfr .",
    "subsection [ sfhistory ] ) , the star formation history of single objects may vary from m2 to m3 .",
    "this determines a different evolution of winds with time : in m2 bubbles tend to form at later times and expand faster than in m3 , as a consequence of a more intense star formation activity concentrated at later times and triggered by a faster accretion of gas onto the fewer galaxies .",
    "when bubbles form in m2 , the dark matter haloes in which they expand already possess total masses larger than the haloes in m3 , but the larger energy provided by star formation often compensates for the increased gravitational attraction .",
    "this is why the convergence of the curves in fig .",
    "[ mfilling ] is not exact , but may differ by a small factor , generally not larger than a few percent .    one may ask if objects with stellar masses lower than about @xmath180@xmath168 m@xmath3 might give a substantial contribution to the pollution of the igm at redshifts where larger objects have not yet assembled . indeed , @xcite claim that the igm has been polluted by outflows from pregalactic objects , with total masses well below @xmath190 m@xmath3 . in principle , winds may escape very easily the shallow potential wells of such objects , if the energy input from star formation is high enough to accelerate the accreted mass to velocities larger than the escape velocities of their haloes . at lower redshifts ,",
    "the evolution of objects with total masses lower than @xmath23 m@xmath3 may be affected by feedback effects that inhibite their star formation activity ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite ) . as a result",
    ", these objects would be unable to blow winds , making their contribution to the pollution of the low redshift igm negligible with respect to other galaxy populations with higher stellar masses .",
    "unfortunately , our simulations do not have sufficient resolution to follow the evolution of these objects .",
    "however , in the light of the results displayed in fig .",
    "[ mfilling ] , we believe that such low stellar mass galaxies would not significantly change our conclusions .",
    "we have presented semi  analytic simulations of galaxy formation in a cosmological context , which include the physics of galactic winds .",
    "the semi - analytic prescriptions are applied to high resolution n  body simulations of a typical `` field '' region of the universe .",
    "the results of our model can be quite accurately interpreted as a consequence of the mass loading efficiency of winds .",
    "the mass accumulated in bubbles is directly linked to the amount of mass entrained from the ambient medium , set by the parameter @xmath36 , and the ultimate fate of winds is strongly dependent on this swept  up mass .",
    "bubbles that load little mass from the surrounding medium can escape the gravitational potential well of their host haloes more efficiently at every redshift .",
    "these bubbles are mostly composed of metal rich supernova ejecta and shocked ism and need to spend little of their energy to accelerate the accreted gas .",
    "since most of the energy injected by the starburst is available to power the expansion of the bubble , these winds have the highest probability to escape the gravitational attraction of haloes and expand into the igm .",
    "the formation of highly mass loaded winds is instead suppressed in all kinds of galaxies , although the suppression is particularly strong in galaxies with @xmath191 m@xmath3 .",
    "this is because the energy provided by star formation is not sufficient to overcome the ram pressure of the infalling material which adds to the gravitational pull of the galaxy .",
    "our estimates of the volume filling factor of winds ( section [ quattro ] ) and of the fraction of igm mass affected by winds ( section [ budget ] ) suggest that galactic outflows are unlikely to significantly modify the properties of the ly@xmath6 forest .",
    "no obvious correlation is found between @xmath153 and @xmath143 .",
    "the volume filling factor is clearly dependent on the mass loading efficiency of bubbles , with low values of @xmath143 associated with highly mass loaded bubbles and viceversa .",
    "the fraction of igm mass affected by winds is usually comparable to the volume filling factor . only in models with high mass loading efficiency",
    "we find that @xmath192 , which implies that the actual fraction of intergalactic mass affected by outflows may be large even when the winds physically fill a small region of space .",
    "this is a consequence of the clustering of matter on large scales and of the fact that galaxies form in high density regions , where their winds can sweep up a larger amount of material than they would if they were expanding inside a low density region .",
    "the efficiency of winds in seeding the igm with metals is investigated in section [ ejection ] .",
    "galaxies with @xmath191 m@xmath3 play a role in the chemical enrichment of the igm only at very high redshifts , when larger objects have not yet assembled . at @xmath4",
    "most of the metals are ejected by galaxies with @xmath193 m@xmath3 , while galaxies with @xmath194 m@xmath3 contribute only about 10%20% of the ejected metals .",
    "the result that metals are mostly ejected by relatively small galaxies qualitatively agrees with the predictions of e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "our estimates of the mean metallicity of the igm are significantly higher than the observed values at @xmath21 to @xmath195 and we have argued that metals in the igm might not be observable in absorption in the spectra of quasars because of the high temperatures of winds . in a forthcoming paper",
