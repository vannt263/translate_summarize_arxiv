    "gravitational lensing has become a valuable probe of dark matter substructure in distant galaxies ( see  b.8 of @xcite , and references therein ) .",
    "a growing body of evidence suggests that anomalous flux ratios , which are observed in many four - image quasar lenses @xcite , can be explained if a few percent of the projected mass within each lens galaxy s einstein angle ( which sets the spatial scale for lensing ) is contained in cold dark matter ( cdm ) `` clumps '' @xcite .",
    "it is then natural to ask whether it is possible to use lensing to measure properties beyond the mean substructure mass fraction .",
    "of particular interest is the clump mass function , because the discrepancy between the observed number of local group satellite galaxies and the theoretically predicted abundance of dark matter clumps varies strongly with mass ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "unfortunately , it is difficult to constrain the mass function with anomalous flux ratios , because there is a degeneracy such that a small clump near a lensed image ( in projected distance ) can produce the same flux perturbation as a large clump farther away ( see * ? ? ?",
    "one possible solution to this problem is to measure flux ratios at multiple wavelengths .",
    "quasar emission regions are believed to have different sizes at different wavelengths .",
    "roughly speaking , only clumps with einstein radii ( einstein angles translated into units of length ) larger than the size of the source can produce flux ratio anomalies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; clumps with small einstein radii act collectively as a smooth mass component .",
    "since the einstein radius depends on mass , the source size effectively translates into a mass threshold .",
    "the net effect is that multi - wavelength observations provide a way to study clumps with different mass ranges .",
    "for example , continuum @xcite and broad - line @xcite optical emission regions in quasars can be perturbed by objects of stellar mass and larger .",
    "radio emission regions , by contrast , are large enough that only objects with masses @xmath1 are important @xcite . if a flux - ratio anomaly is observed at optical wavelengths but not at radio wavelengths , it is likely that microlensing by stars in the lens galaxy is the culprit . to avoid contamination by microlensing , @xcite focused on radio anomalies in their study .",
    "infrared emission regions are intermediate in size , so observations in this band provide a way to probe objects with mass scales between stars and clumps .",
    "recent mid - ir observations with the spitzer @xcite and subaru @xcite telescopes have achieved the spatial resolution necessary for strong lensing studies . in particular",
    ", @xcite found evidence for subhalos of @xmath2 in the lens system b1422 + 231 , and possibly in pg 1115 + 080 as well .",
    "in addition , @xcite recently found evidence of a clump with mass @xmath3 in the lens mg 0414 + 0534 . a related way to study the substructure mass function is to compare continuum and broad - line emission in optical lenses @xcite , which originate from the central accretion disk and an extended distribution of fast - moving clouds , respectively .",
    "these two regions differ in length scale by a factor of @xmath4100 , whence their utility for substructure lensing .",
    "this technique has been employed to study the four - image lenses he  0435@xmath01223 @xcite , sdss j0924 + 0219 @xcite , sdss j1004 + 4112 @xcite , rx  j1131@xmath01231 @xcite , and q2237 + 0305 @xcite , along with several two - image lenses @xcite    while the method of probing substructure with differential source size effects is promising , this approach does have some limitations .",
    "for one thing , the mass threshold defined by the source size and einstein radius does not represent a sharp cutoff ( see * ? ? ? * ) , so it is difficult to obtain tight constraints on the clump mass .",
    "in addition , it may not be possible to measure flux ratios at enough wavelengths to sample the mass function well .",
    "finally , lensing constraints on the mass function will only be as accurate as the mapping of wavelength to source size .",
    "while the model of @xcite has been quite successful in explaining the observed properties of accretion disks , and gives a relation between wavelength and source size , it does not apply to the full range of wavelengths relevant to strong lensing .",
    "a second possible approach to constrain the substructure mass function is to use flux ratios in combination with other lens observables .",
    "although they are smaller in amplitude than flux ratio perturbations , substructure effects on both image positions @xcite and time delays @xcite should be detectable .",
    "combining different observables will be valuable because they depend on the lens potential in different ways : time delays , image positions , and flux ratios depend on the potential and its first and second derivatives , respectively .",
    "the different observables , in other words , contain different information about the substructure population .",
    "for example , @xcite showed that time delays are sensitive to the slope and dynamic range of the substructure mass function , which suggests that precise time delay measurements may provide a way to constrain these properties .",
    "before we can use this method , we need to determine whether observed time delays differ from the predictions for smooth mass models in a way that may indicate the presence of substructure . developing a method to identify such `` time delay anomalies '' is the focus of this paper .    in particular , we wish to understand the range of time delays that can be produced by reasonable smooth models .",
    "we can then classify any outlier as `` anomalous '' and use it as evidence of complexity in the lens potential",
    ". we must be careful when interpreting anomalies , however , because dark matter substructure may not be the only relevant source of complexity in the lens galaxy .",
    "stars also constitute complex structure that is important when interpreting flux ratios ( due to microlensing ) , but they have essentially no effect on time delays @xcite .",
    "this means that time delays should not depend on wavelength , so we do not need to distinguish between radio and optical time delays . ) . ] finally , extinction by dust in the lens galaxy can perturb flux ratios , but it will not have any effect on time delays , which are measured through flux variability alone and do not depend on color information .    the other main source of complexity we need to consider is the environment of the lens galaxy .",
    "many lens galaxies lie in groups or clusters of galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "to lowest order , such an environment contributes a tidal shear to the lens potential ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and we therefore include shear in our analysis , but there may be higher - order terms that are non - negligible .",
    "extreme examples of this situation include the lens b1608 + 656 , which has two galaxies inside the einstein angle @xcite , and the lens sdss j1004 + 4112 , which is produced by a cluster of galaxies @xcite . in general , time delay anomalies in close pairs of images",
    "potentially provide the strongest evidence of dark matter substructure , because environmental effects are fairly large - scale and should not produce dramatic differences between images separated by a distance much less than the einstein angle . with time delay anomalies in image pairs that have larger separations , by contrast , we will need to take more care to consider environmental effects as well as substructure .",
    "our approach follows that of @xcite , who employed analytic flux - ratio relations that are generic for all lenses with fold and cusp configurations produced by smooth mass models . to be more specific",
    ", a fold lens contains a bright pair of images whose fluxes @xmath5 and @xmath6 should satisfy the relation @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the image separation and @xmath9 depends on properties of the lens potential . a cusp lens contains a triplet of bright images whose fluxes should satisfy the relation @xmath10 where @xmath8 is the distance between the closest pair of images and @xmath11 depends on properties of the lens potential ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "( note that @xmath12 and @xmath13 vanish in the limit @xmath14 . )",
    "if these relations are violated , we may conclude that the mass distribution of the lens galaxy can not be smooth and must contain additional structure , most likely in the form of cdm substructure or a complex lens environment . determining in practice that a given lens is anomalous requires some care .",
    "equations ( [ eqn : rfold ] ) and ( [ eqn : rcusp ] ) show that @xmath12 and @xmath13 increase with the distance between the images , so a non - zero value for one of these quantities does not automatically imply a flux ratio anomaly .",
    "making such an identification would require knowledge of @xmath9 and @xmath11 , which depend on the exact form of the lens potential . since these quantities are not directly observable , @xcite performed monte carlo simulations to determine distributions for @xmath12 and @xmath13 at fixed @xmath8 using parameter values appropriate for a realistic population of lens galaxies . with this information , it is possible to determine the probability that an observed lens is anomalous and hence contains small - scale structure .",
    "@xcite employed a method similar to that of @xcite to study time delays , although his emphasis was different from ours .",
    "while both studies are based on time delay distributions , oguri s emphasis was on determining the hubble constant , whereas we focus on small - scale structure in lens galaxies .",
    "in fact , we explicitly remove the hubble constant from our analysis by working with scaled time delays and time delay ratios .",
    "another difference is that we concentrate our attention mainly on cusp and fold lenses , which are most relevant to the questions we seek to answer .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in  [ sec : hcaus ] we consider how the differential time delay depends on the parameters of the lens potential , and on the shape of the associated ( astroid ) caustic .",
    "the results we present there motivate our monte carlo simulations , which we describe in  [ sec : distributions ] .",
    "we apply our formalism to the 25 known four - image lenses in  [ sec : results ]",
    ". finally , we present our conclusions in  [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "in @xcite we showed that the time delay between a close pair of images in a fold lens scales with the cube of the image separation , @xmath8 , i.e. , @xmath15 ( see eq .  [ 25 ] of @xcite , and pp .",
    "190191 of @xcite ) , where @xmath16 is a cosmology - dependent scale factor ( see eq .  [ [ eq : tau0 ] ] below ) .",
    "the coefficient @xmath17 comes from a taylor expansion of the lens potential , @xmath18 , and can be written as a particular third derivative : @xmath19 , where the subscript `` 2 '' indicates differentiation with respect to the coordinate in the image plane that corresponds to the direction perpendicular to the caustic in the source plane , and is evaluated at the point on the critical curve that serves as the coordinate origin ( see  3.2 of @xcite ) . in this section",
    "we study how the time delay for a fold pair depends on the lens potential and the distance between the fold point and the nearest cusp point .",
    "this is equivalent to studying the variation of @xmath17 along the caustic , since , for fixed @xmath8 , the time delay is given solely in terms of this coefficient . because @xmath20 , we find it more convenient to work with its absolute value .",
    "most lens galaxies are of early type and have density profiles close to isothermal , i.e. , the three dimensional density scales with radius as @xmath21 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , so we compute @xmath22 for a singular isothermal ellipsoid ( sie ) lens . to determine an appropriate value for the ellipticity parameter @xmath23 ,",
    "where @xmath24 is the minor - to - major axis ratio , we turn to the observed galaxy samples of @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "these samples have mean ellipticities and dispersions of @xmath25 , and @xmath26 respectively .",
    "note that these values measure the distribution of light rather than mass , so it is possible that the dark matter halo in which the galaxy presumably resides is rounder or flatter than the observed isophotes .     at various points on the caustic for a singular isothermal ellipsoid lens with different values of the ellipticity .",
    "insets show close - up views of the upper and right - hand cusp points .",
    "the coefficient @xmath17 should vanish at a cusp point ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but for computational reasons we do not necessarily have points that lie precisely at the cusps .",
    "the axes are in units of the einstein angle .",

    "fig : hcaus],title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=32.0% ]    figure [ fig : hcaus ] shows @xmath22 at various points on the caustic , for ellipticities of 0.1 , 0.3 , and 0.5 . we see that @xmath22 remains roughly constant along the caustic for points away from the cusps .",
    "this suggests that lenses whose fold pairs have comparable separations will have similar time delays as well , at least for galaxies with similar ellipticities .",
    "testing this prediction will require large samples of fold lenses , for which both the differential time delay between the fold pair and the ellipticity of the lens galaxy are known . for points near a cusp",
    ", @xmath22 decreases rapidly and vanishes right at the cusp point ( as it must ; see  2 of @xcite ) . finally , we see that @xmath22 depends on the size of the caustic . it is not yet clear whether this merely reflects a simple correlation between @xmath22 and @xmath27 or is indicative of a more subtle relationship between caustic size and the time delay for a fold pair .",
    "in addition to ellipticity , @xcite and @xcite find that many early - type galaxies have small departures from elliptical symmetry .",
    "`` disky '' or `` boxy '' isophotes can be represented by an @xmath28 multipole mode , with coefficient @xmath29 for disky isophotes and @xmath30 for boxy isophotes . in terms of the ( two - dimensional ) lens potential ,",
    "the @xmath28 mode for an isothermal galaxy can be written as ( e.g. , @xcite ) @xmath31 the coefficient @xmath32 is defined in terms of surface brightness rather than potential , so we must convert from @xmath33 to @xmath32 : @xmath34 where @xmath35 . for typical values of @xmath36 , 0 , 0.01 , and 0.02 ( e.g. , @xcite ) and ellipticity @xmath37",
    ", we find maximum @xmath22-values of 0.07 , 0.07 , 0.08 , and 0.09 , respectively .",
    "we therefore conclude that @xmath28 multipole terms have fairly small effects on the time delay for a fold pair , regardless of whether the isophote is disky or boxy .",
    "we nevertheless include @xmath28 modes in our simulations (  [ sec : distributions ] ) given that this is both simple and observationally motivated .    since many lens galaxies lie within groups or clusters ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , a nonzero tidal shear is common . using numerical simulations and semianalytic models of galaxy formation",
    ", @xcite find that shear can be described by a lognormal distribution with median @xmath38 and dispersion @xmath39 dex . for such shear amplitudes ,",
    "the caustic structure is qualitatively similar to what is seen in figure [ fig : hcaus ] , so we do not show it explicitly .",
    "we return to shear when we consider realistic lens populations in the following section .",
    "for any given lens galaxy , we could estimate @xmath17 ( or more generally the smooth model time delays ) directly , by fitting a lens model and inferring the lens potential .",
    "however , we would like to avoid any dependence on models and modeling as much as possible .",
    "we therefore elect to examine the full probability distributions for time delays given a realistic population of lens galaxies , using monte carlo methods to construct the time delay distributions .",
    "we follow the approach of @xcite and create lens galaxies with model parameters drawn from the galaxy samples of @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "although the mean ellipticities and dispersions are similar for the three samples , the underlying galaxy populations are not the same . @xcite and @xcite include galaxies within clusters ,",
    "while @xcite use bright , nearby galaxies to construct their sample .",
    "in addition , @xcite and @xcite report @xmath32 measurements , while @xcite do not . in order to determine the extent to which our conclusions depend on the input data , we carry out the numerical method described below separately for each of the three galaxy samples . to model the environment of a lens galaxy , we add tidal shear based on the simulations of @xcite that we discussed at the end of the previous section . for the sample of @xcite we pick 2000",
    "ellipticities from their observed distribution , and assign a random shear to each . for the samples of @xcite and @xcite , we use the actual @xmath40 pairs for the observed galaxies ( 87 in the @xcite sample , and 54 in the @xcite sample ) in order to retain any correlation between the parameters ; and for each galaxy we use 100 different realizations of the shear .    for each model lens potential , we use an updated version of the _ gravlens _ softwarekeeton / gravlens ] @xcite to solve the lens equation numerically and obtain the image positions and time delays for a large set of random source positions that are uniformly distributed in the four - image region . using a uniform distribution",
    "has several consequences .",
    "first , it means that each model lens potential is automatically weighted by its four - image cross section , which seems like the proper statistical approach .",
    "second , it means that we neglect magnification bias .",
    "while lensing magnification bias is quite important when comparing statistical samples of four - image and two - image lenses , it is less dramatic within a sample of four - image lenses , and still less so within the subset of four - image lenses that have a particular image configuration . generally speaking , including",
    "magnification bias would give more weight to sources that lie closer to the lensing caustic , which tend to produce shorter time delays , so it would shift the time delay distributions we derive to somewhat shorter values .",
    "the effect is not strong , however , and we checked that it does not change any of our conclusions about time delay anomalies .",
    "all told , our simulations based on the galaxy samples from @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite contain 1,267,555 , 2,205,515 , and 851,261 mock four - image lens systems , respectively .",
    "the time delay of an image at angular position @xmath41 relative to an unlensed light ray from the true source with position @xmath42 is given by @xmath43 , \\ ] ] where the time scale is @xmath44 here @xmath45 , and @xmath46 are the angular - diameter distances from the observer to lens , observer to source , and lens to source , respectively . for our mock lenses we focus on the dimensionless , scaled time delay @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the einstein angle . ) .",
    "although there is no unique definition for the einstein angle of an elliptical lens , different definitions result in values consistent to within a factor of order unity . in practice ,",
    "such concerns are rendered moot by the 5% astrometric uncertainties we allow for when comparing observed lenses with our mock catalog ( see text for details ) . ]",
    "the advantage of working with the scaled time delay is that our analysis of the mock lenses is independent of cosmology , and of the lens and source redshifts .",
    "it does mean that we need to convert all observed time delays from physical to dimensionless units before we can compare them to our mock lens catalog ( see  [ sec : results ] ) . for convenience ,",
    "we quote distances ( e.g. , @xmath8 and @xmath49 below ) in units of the einstein angle as well .    our analytic time delay relation ( eq .  25 of @xcite ) specifically applies to fold image pairs , so they are the most obvious targets for anomaly searches .",
    "however , we do not actually use the analytic relation to make predictions for our mock lenses , so it is reasonable to consider non - fold image pairs , as well as cusp and cross lenses , in our comparisons between observed lenses and monte carlo simulations .",
    "there are six distinct image pairs in a four - image lens .",
    "we are interested in the subset of pairs that contain one image of positive parity ( which lies at a minimum of the time delay surface ) and one of negative parity ( which lies at a saddlepoint ) . in this way",
    ", we consider only adjacent images .",
    "the effect is to make our analysis local approaches order unity . ] rather than global , which is appropriate for studying small - scale structure .",
    "there are four such mixed - parity image pairs in each four - image lens .",
    "we characterize each image pair by the separation between the two images , @xmath8 .",
    "we also use the distance to the next - nearest image , @xmath49 , we consider the distance between each image of a given pair and its next - nearest image of opposite parity . we define @xmath49 to be the smaller of these two distances . ] because it helps specify the lens morphology : a fold lens has @xmath50 ; a cusp lens has @xmath51 ; a cross lens has @xmath52 .",
    "another reason to use @xmath49 is that it allows us to take ratios of time delays ( see below ) .",
    "while @xmath8 and @xmath49 technically define an image triplet , we will use the term `` pair '' to refer to the two images defined by @xmath8 , since this is the image pair of primary interest .",
    "we seek to understand the full range of time delays that can be produced by smooth lens models that are consistent with the positions of an observed image pair .",
    "we consider a mock lens image pair to `` match '' an observed pair if two conditions are satisfied .",
    "first , we require that the @xmath8 and @xmath49 values of the mock and observed pairs agree within a tolerance of @xmath530.05 .",
    "this criterion is conservative in the sense that we are using minimal information from quantities that are observable and local ; using additional information would only narrow the range of smooth models that are considered to be consistent with an observed image pair .",
    "the distance - based matching criterion does have one limitation , which is illustrated in figure [ fig : sampcusp ] : it may allow not only mock pairs with the same parities as the observed images , but also pairs with the opposite parities .",
    "we could avoid this problem by adding information about the fourth image .",
    "we do not want to do that , however , because the fourth image is always `` far '' from the pair in question ( i.e. , 12 einstein angles away ) ; including it would make our analysis more sensitive to global properties of the lens potential and countermand our goal of using a local analysis to search for substructure .",
    "instead , we add the image parities to the matching criterion . specifically , we insist that the parities of the three images defined by @xmath8 and @xmath49 are the same for an observed lens and its simulated counterpart .",
    "this is straightfoward to do since the image parities are known for the mock lenses , and they can be determined unambiguously for observed lenses ( by measuring time delays or just analyzing the image configuration ; see , e.g. , @xcite ) . since the two images in each pair we consider have opposite parities ( by construction ) , the parity cut represents only one additional bit of information .        for each image pair",
    "we compute the differential scaled time delay between the two images , which we call @xmath54 . for the second differential time delay we use the image pair characterized by the distance @xmath49 , and we call this @xmath55",
    ". we then adopt the following sign convention . by construction",
    ", any image pair we consider will consist of a minimum image ( positive parity , labeled @xmath56 ) and a saddle image ( negative parity , labeled @xmath57 ) .",
    "if the next - nearest image is a minimum ( labeled @xmath58 ) , we have a triplet consisting of a saddle flanked by two minima .",
    "we define the two differential time delays to be @xmath59 since saddles have larger time delays than minima , both @xmath54 and @xmath55 are negative . in the case that the next - nearest image is a saddle ( labeled @xmath60 ) , we have a triplet consisting of a minimum flanked by two saddles .",
    "we then define the differential time delays to be @xmath61 now both @xmath54 and @xmath55 are positive .",
    "it is also useful to compute the ratio of the differential time delays for two image pairs .",
    "time delay ratios are attractive because they do not depend on cosmology ( @xmath16 factors out ) , and they are largely immune to the radial - profile degeneracy ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "our sign convention ensures that @xmath62 is always positive since @xmath54 and @xmath55 have the same sign .    to reprise",
    ", we define the two time delays relative to the `` middle '' of the three images we use to determine @xmath8 and @xmath49 .",
    "this means the scaled time delays can be either positive or negative , but the time delay ratio is always positive .",
    "note that regardless of the sign , when labeling image pairs we always list the minimum first .    from the set of mock lenses that match an observed image pair ,",
    "we construct histograms of the scaled time delay and the time delay ratio .",
    "these represent the range of values that can be produced by realistic smooth mass distributions .",
    "we can then use these predicted distributions to assess whether observed time delays are or are not consistent with lensing by a smooth mass distribution .",

    "we analyze the lenses with known time delays and make predictions for the remainder .",

    "the panels are arranged such that @xmath8 increases from left to right . as a check for systematic effects , we plot histograms of the time delays and time delay ratios produced by monte carlo simulations using galaxy samples from @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite ( see  [ sec : distributions ] ) .",
    "we first consider histograms of the scaled time delays , which are shown in figures [ fig : tdel - fold]-[fig : tdel - cross ] .",

    "the histograms are not highly sensitive to the input galaxy sample , especially in the tails ( which are most important for identifying anomalies )",
    ". the histograms are somewhat asymmetric with a longer tail on the side away from zero , which presumably reflects the fact that the histograms are bounded by zero by construction .",
    "many of the histograms have a large width relative to the mean / median , which is not too surprising because we have been quite generous in matching mock lenses to observed lenses on the basis of minimal information ( just @xmath8 , @xmath49 , and parity ) .",
    "this is consistent with our goal of being conservative in identifying time delay anomalies .",
    "next , we consider histograms of the time delay ratios , which are shown in figures [ fig : trat - fold][fig : trat - cross ] . these histograms are skewed to the right , presumably because the time delay ratios are positive and hence the histograms are bounded by zero on the left but unbounded on the right .",
    "the overall structure of the time delay ratio histograms does not vary much from one lens to another , or between image pairs of a given lens .",
    "this suggests that conclusions drawn from time delay ratios are not terribly sensitive to the lens morphology ( fold , cusp , or cross ) , which may prove quite useful .",

    "this statement is quantified by the statistical p - value , which gives the fraction of matching mock lenses whose time delays ( or ratios ) are smaller than the observed value ; either @xmath69 or @xmath70 , for example , would indicate that a time delay is anomalous at more than 99% confidence .",
    "we consider @xmath69 or @xmath70 to indicate a strong anomaly , and @xmath71 or @xmath72 to indicate a marginal anomaly .",

    "this is a simple task for time delays , but for time delay ratios we first need to propagate errors from the time delays into the ratios . for time delay errors that are symmetric , we assume they are gaussian and propagate them using the standard formula for a quotient . if the errorbars are asymmetric , we conservatively take the larger errorbar as the gaussian standard deviation , @xmath74 . while this approach is not strictly correct , it is the best we can do without knowing the full error distribution , and it is conservative in the sense that it should overestimate the uncertainties in the time delay ratio .",
    "it turns out that our identifications of anomalies are not affected by the observational errors in most cases ( see tables [ tab : pval - scaled ] and [ tab : pval - rat ] , and the following discussions of individual lenses ) .",
    "this does not mean , however , that there is no need to measure time delays more precisely .",
    "rather , it reflects the fact that our predicted time delay distributions are quite broad because we have deliberately chosen to be generous in matching observed and mock lenses .",
    "when it comes to analyzing time delay anomalies to extract physical information ( about the substructure mass function , for example ) , it will be necessary to do detailed modeling for which precise image positions and time delays will be vital ( see @xcite and @xcite for more discussion ) .",

    "this is the only quad lens whose maximum ( doubly - negative parity ) image has been observed , so we have not included maxima in our analysis .",
    "the time delays are known for the image pairs ba and ca , so we can examine the corresponding scaled time delays and also the time delay ratio for the pair ca ; but the other time delays and ratios have not yet been determined .",
    "the p - values for the known time delays do not indicate anomalies ( according to our 95% confidence criterion ) .",
    "this seems surprising , because the actual lens potential is presumably very different from our assumed model of an isothermal galaxy with shear : clusters are not expected to have isothermal profiles ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and the galaxies in the cluster create significant complexity in the potential .",
    "we believe the results for 1004 indicate that our method for finding time delay anomalies is conservative . for the fold lens 2033 ,",
    "@xcite report the time delays between images b and c and between b and the combination of the close images a1 and a2 .",
    "the time delay between a1 and a2 was too small to be measured ; it is expected to be short enough that we can assume a1 and a2 have effectively the same light travel time for the purpose of determining the time delays for the image pairs a1c and ba2 . among the distant image pairs , the bc pair has the largest separation and also a strong time delay anomaly , while the two pairs with smaller distances are not anomalous . the nominal value of the time delay ratio for the bc pair does not indicate an anomaly , although the uncertainties are large enough that the situation is not conclusive at present .",
    "the time delay in bc may be affected by the group of galaxies of which the main lens is a member @xcite .",
    "we find two lines of evidence supporting this hypothesis .",
    "first , the time delays become more anomalous as the image separation increases .",
    "second , our predicted time delays are longer than the observed time delays ; adding environmental effects to the lens model would generally reduce the predicted time delays . a group would contribute a non - negative convergence @xmath76 to the lens potential , which would rescale the predicted time delays by a factor @xmath77 , and it could also create higher - order effects that may be more complicated @xcite .",
    "this and alternative hypotheses that the time delays are affected by a change in the radial profile of the lens galaxy or even the global value of the hubble constant are discussed below .",
    "all of the differential time delays are known for the fold lens 1608 @xcite . because there are two galaxies inside the einstein angle , this lens is not necessarily expected to be well described by our models .",
    "indeed , it is extremely hard for single - galaxy models ( even with shear ) to reproduce the @xmath8 and @xmath49 values for the image pair bd : we find only one mock image pair that matches the observed values .",
    "we are therefore unable to compute p - values for the bd time delay ( cf .",
    "table [ tab : pval - scaled ] ) .    among the other image pairs ,",
    "the fold pair ac and the distant pair ad are anomalous in terms of their scaled time delays .",
    "all of these anomalies are very strong ; in fact , the ad scaled time delay and its @xmath73 values have p - values that are strictly zero , meaning there are no matching mock lenses whose time delays are more extreme than the observed values .",
    "we note that these anomalies do not necessarily reveal cdm substructure , because the presence of two lens galaxies makes the lens potential more complicated than we have allowed for here .",
    "inferences about substructure need to be done in the context of models that treat this complex lens in more detail ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we now turn to the cusp lenses .",
    "@xcite report the time delays between each of the three cusp images ( a , b , and c ) and the fourth image ( d ) for 0911 .",
    "we find clear evidence of time delay anomalies in the dc and da image pairs , which are the two pairs with the largest separations .",
    "since the lens galaxy in 0911 is part of a cluster @xcite , it is possible that these anomalies are due to environmental effects . pinning down the origin of the anomalies ( i.e. , the environment of the lens , or substructure ) will require that the time delays among the cusp images be precisely measured .",
    "although the close time delays can be inferred from current data , the p - values they predict span the range ( 0 , 1 ) when 3@xmath74 measurement uncertainties are included . at this point",
    "we conclude that the 0911 time delays are very intriguing and warrant further study .",
    "@xcite report the time delays among the close images a , b , and c for the cusp lens 1131 , along with an estimate of the time delay to the distant image d. they note that the time delays among the close images are much longer than expected for a smooth mass distribution , and suggest that the time delays indicate the presence of a massive @xmath78 clump near image a. @xcite highlight a second peculiarity of the 1131 time delays , namely that the minimum image b is observed to lead the minimum image c , whereas smooth models predict the reverse .",
    "they suggest that a population of clumps could reverse the temporal ordering of the two minimum images in a cusp lens .",
    "we can not directly address the issue of the temporal ordering of images b and c , because we do not consider the time delay between images with the same parity .",
    "however , we can offer a more model - independent assessment of the time delays for the other image pairs .",
    "we find that the time delays for the cusp pairs ba and ca are anomalous : accounting for 3@xmath74 errorbars , the p - value for ba is strictly zero , while the pair ca falls just short of a strong anomaly ( 0.006 compared with the threshold of 0.005 ) .",
    "this strengthens the conclusion by @xcite that the observed time delays are not at all consistent with lensing by a reasonable smooth mass distribution .",
    "interestingly , we also find that the distant image pair bd has an ( almost strongly ) anomalous time - delay ratio , even though its scaled time delay is not anomalous .",
    "we note that this anomaly is caused by the observed value being smaller than most of the predicted values ; this might be understood in terms of the ba time delay , which appears in the denominator of the bd time - delay ratio , being anomalously longer ( in absolute value ) than expected .",
    "our main conclusion is that the 1131 time delays are highly anomalous , and this general conclusion together with the specific analyses of @xcite and @xcite strongly suggests that this lens contains significant substructure .",
    "we also note , however , that we must be careful when interpreting time - delay ratios , since an anomaly may result from the denominator being anomalous rather than the pair of interest . for 1422",
    ", the nominal values of the time delays @xcite among the three cusp images a , b , and c indicate strong anomalies .",
    "the uncertainties in the claimed time delays are not much smaller than the time delays themselves , so conclusive statements are impossible at this point .",
    "( notice , for example , that the range of p - values for the ab pair spans 0 to 1.00 given the uncertainties . )",
    "the system clearly warrants further study , especially since it is well - known to have anomalous flux ratios @xcite .",
    "finally , we consider the cross lens 0435 , whose time delays were measured by @xcite .",
    "the cross image configuration features no close pairs of images , so all the time delays could be affected by substructure or large - scale complexity in the lens potential , or both .",
    "we do not find anomalies in any of the image pairs , suggesting that the anomalous fluxes at the @xmath40.2 mag level in images a and c are most likely due to microlensing @xcite rather than substructure @xcite .",
    "given our goal of being conservative , it is reassuring to find that a cross lens like 0435 has perfectly reasonable time delays . in the preceding discussion of individual lenses we have interpreted time delay anomalies as evidence for complex structure in the lens potential . here",
    "we briefly consider three alternative interpretations .",
    "one possibility is that the hubble constant , which is needed to compare observed and predicted time delays , differs from our assumed value of @xmath66 km s@xmath67 mpc@xmath67 .",
    "a second possibility is that a lens has a mass sheet , or external convergence @xmath79 , whose effects we have neglected @xcite .",
    "the apparent anomalies in 2033 and 0911 arise because the model predictions are longer than the observed time delays . since predicted time delays scale as @xmath80",
    ", we would need either to have a strong _ negative _ mass sheet or to increase @xmath81 in order to eliminate the anomalies .",
    "focusing on the @xmath81 possibility , in order to reduce the predicted time delays such that the 95% confidence intervals overlap the observed values in 2033 and 0911 , we would require an @xmath81 value in excess of 100 km s@xmath67 mpc@xmath67 , which does not seem like a viable option .",
    "the lens 1131 is a bit different , because the predicted time delays are shorter than the observed values , which would imply a positive mass sheet or a smaller hubble constant than we have assumed .",
    "regardless of whether the required mass sheet or @xmath81 value is reasonable , however , the existing evidence strongly implies that 1131 does contain substructure @xcite .",
    "a third possibility is that the radial density profiles of the lens galaxies differ from the isothermal profile we have assumed . changing the radial profile has more complicated effects on the predicted time delays , but @xcite argues that to leading order the changes can be approximated with the scaling @xmath82 , where @xmath83 is the mean convergence in the vicinity of the einstein angle ( specifically , in the annulus spanned by the images ) . using this scaling",
    ", we can estimate the radial profile that would be required if we wanted to reduce the predicted time delays so the 95% confidence intervals overlap the observed values .",
    "( this analysis only yields an estimate , because the scaling is only approximate and does not include the full complexity of ellipsoidal mass distributions ; but it is still instructive . ) if we write the 3-d density profile as @xmath84 , we estimate that we would need @xmath85 for 2033 , and @xmath86 for 0911 , compared to @xmath87 for an isothermal distribution . for comparison ,",
    "@xcite find that lens galaxies have a mean power law index of @xmath88 , with an rms scatter of 0.12 .",
    "again , the simple analysis here needs to be interpreted with some care , but it does suggest that changing the radial profile does not provide a compelling explanation for the apparent time delay anomalies .      to complete our analysis , we present predictions of the scaled time delays ( table [ tab : tdel - scaled ] ) and time delay ratios ( table [ tab : tdel - rat ] ) for all mixed - parity image pairs in all 25 known four - image lenses .",
    "specifically , we use the simulations based on the galaxy sample of @xcite to compute the median value , 95% confidence interval , and 99% confidence interval for each quantity for each image pair .",
    "these results give a sense of what the time delays should be for lenses that are adequately described as ellipsoidal mass distributions with tidal shear .",
    "( see @xcite for a complementary approach based on fitting pixellated mass models to individual lenses . )",
    "there is currently great interest in lens monitoring ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and we hope our predictions will be useful in planning observational campaigns to measure time delays . furthermore , as new time delays are measured , it will be a simple matter to compare them with our predictions to determine whether the time delays are anomalous in a way that indicates a complex lens potential ( due either to substructure or to the lens environment ) .",
    "we have introduced a new method to use gravitational lens time delays to detect complex structure in the lens potential .",
    "the complexity may be associated with cdm substructure , in which case time delays offer the chance to learn more about the substructure population than is possible with lens flux ratios ; or it may be associated with the lens environment , such as a group or cluster of galaxies surrounding the lens .",
    "the basic approach is to determine the range of time delays that can be produced by reasonable smooth lens models , so that we can identify outliers as being anomalous . to get a sense of how this could work , we first studied the dependence of the time delay between the close pair of images in a fold lens on the position of the source and the form of the lens potential . for a source near a fold point",
    ", we have found that the time delay remains approximately constant as the source moves along the caustic . for a lens modeled by an elliptical galaxy with @xmath28 multipole perturbations and",
    "tidal shear , the time delay increases with ellipticity and shear , but is not very sensitive to @xmath28 modes .    using monte carlo simulations",
    ", we then constructed distributions of the time delays in four - image lenses .",
    "this approach can handle fold , cusp , and cross lenses , which comprise the three canonical four - image lens morphologies . by constructing a catalog of mock lenses based on observed populations of elliptical galaxies , we computed the range of time delays and time delay ratios that would be expected for a smooth lens potential ( i.e. , one with ellipticity , shear , and @xmath28 multipoles ) . by comparing",
    "observed time delays with the predicted ranges , we have found time delay anomalies in the systems rx j0911 + 0551 , rx j1131@xmath01231 , b1422 + 231 , b1608 + 656 , and wfi 2033@xmath04723 .",
    "it is unlikely that these anomalies can be explained by errors in our assumed values of the hubble constant or the slope of the density profile : the hubble constant would have to be unreasonably high or the density profile surprisingly shallow in order to explain some of the apparent anomalies ( we specifically discussed rx j0911 + 0551 and wfi 2033@xmath04723 ) , and neither possibility could explain rx j1131@xmath01231 .",
    "it is possible to further reduce sensitivity to the hubble constant and density profile by working with time delay ratios , although in general we have found that time delay ratios have less power to reveal anomalies .",
    "part of the problem is that there are fewer time delay ratios known than time delays themselves , and a large uncertainty in a given time delay will lead to a correspondingly large uncertainty in the ratio , making definitive conclusions difficult .    in general , anomalies between close pairs of images in fold and cusp lenses",
    "should provide the cleanest evidence of substructure .",
    "the cusp lens rx j1131@xmath01231 contains such anomalies , which is consistent with conclusions based on more detailed modeling by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the cusp lenses b1422 + 231 and rx",
    "j0911 + 0551 show evidence of time delay anomalies in the cusp triplet , but the large uncertainties in the measured time delays prevent firm conclusions at present .",
    "the only fold pair that is clearly anomalous is in b1608 + 656 , but the peculiar nature of this system ( with two lens galaxies inside the einstein angle ) makes it difficult to draw a definitive conclusion about substructure from our analysis . among larger - separation image pairs",
    "we have found time delay anomalies in the fold lens wfi 2033@xmath04723 and the cusp lens rx j0911 + 0551 .",
    "both lenses show evidence of a complex environment , but in order to distinguish between that and substructure as the origin of the time delay anomalies it will be necessary to precisely measure the time delays between the close images ( the fold pair in wfi 2033@xmath04723 , and the cusp triplet in rx j0911 + 0551 ) .    in the hope that the sample of observed precision time delays will continue to grow ,",
    "we have predicted the time delays for all mixed - parity image pairs in all 25 known four - image lenses . as new time delays",
    "are measured , it will be a simple matter to compare them with our predicted confidence intervals to determine whether they are anomalous .",
    "if a lens galaxy contains complex structure , time delays should help reveal it .",
    "flux ratios provide a powerful way to find small - scale structure , but they are not unique in this ; time delays hold great promise for contributing to our understanding of the role played by dark matter in the universe , especially when combined with other lensing observables .",

    "<S> here we show that the proportionality constant increases with the quadrupole moment of the lens potential , and depends only weakly on the position of the source along the caustic . </S>",
    "<S> we use monte carlo simulations to determine the range of time delays that can be produced by realistic smooth lens models consisting of isothermal ellipsoid galaxies with tidal shear . </S>",
    "<S> we can then identify outliers as `` time delay anomalies . '' </S>",

    "<S> the anomalies in rx j1131@xmath01231 provide strong evidence for substructure in the lens potential , while at this point the apparent anomalies in b1422 + 231 mainly indicate that the time delay measurements need to be improved . </S>",
    "<S> we also find evidence for time delay anomalies in larger - separation image pairs in the fold lenses , b1608 + 656 and wfi 2033@xmath04723 , and the cusp lens rx j0911 + 0551 . </S>",
    "<S> we suggest that these anomalies are caused by some combination of substructure and a complex lens environment . finally , to assist future monitoring campaigns we use our smooth models with shear to predict the time delays for all known four - image lenses . </S>"
