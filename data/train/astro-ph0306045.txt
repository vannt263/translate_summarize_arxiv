    "the number of known gravitational lens systems has grown steadily since their initial discovery ( walsh et al .",
    "1979 ) , amounting now to nearly a hundred systems .",
    "in addition to the pure theoretical interests in certain properties of gravitational lensing ( e.g. scaling relations , image multiplicities , catastrophe theory , etc . ) gravitational lenses have proven extremely valuable for a variety of applications : ( i ) the determination of cosmological parameters via lens statistics of well - defined samples ( e.g. turner , ostriker & gott 1984 ; fukugita et al .",
    "1992 ; kochanek 1996 ; falco , kochanek & munoz 1998 ; helbig et al . 2000 ; sarbu , rusin & ma 2001 ; chae et al .",
    "2002 ) , ( ii ) the study of the evolution of the stellar populations of early - type galaxies ( keeton , kochanek & falco 1998 ; kochanek et al .",
    "2000 ; rusin et al .  2003 ; treu & koopmans 2002 ; koopmans & treu 2003 ; van de ven , van dokkum & franx 2003 ) , ( iii ) the determination of the hubble constant ( h@xmath13 ) from gravitational time - delays ( e.g. kundic et al .",
    "1997 ; schechter et al.1997 ; koopmans & fassnacht 1999 ; fassnacht et al .  1999 ; koopmans et al .",
    "2000 ; burud et al .  2002a , 2002b ; hjorth et al .",
    "2002 ) .",
    "unfortunately , the sample of known lenses is still plagued by incomplete information on the redshift of the lens ( @xmath14 ) or of the source ( @xmath15 ) , which set the physical scale of the system and is therefore vital for most astrophysical applications of gravitational - lens systems .",
    "this has motivated dedicated efforts on large telescopes to complete the determination of redshifts of the sample of known lenses ( e.g. fassnacht & cohen 1998 ; lubin et al .",
    "2000 ; tonry & kochanek 2000 ; cohen , blandford & lawrence 2002 ; mckean et al .",
    "2003 , submitted ) .    here , we present the redshift of the einstein ring in mg1549 + 305 .",
    "the redshift @xmath16 of the extremely red object ( ero ) source of the radio ring was obtained at the keck ",
    "ii telescope as part of the lenses structure and dynamics survey ( koopmans & treu 2002 , 2003 ; treu & koopmans 2002a ; hereafter kt02 , kt03 , tk02a ) .",
    "the currently ongoing lsd survey aims at studying the mass distribution of intermediate redshift ( @xmath17 ) e / s0 galaxies by combining lensing and dynamical analysis . the joint analysis  based on hst images and deep keck spectroscopy  allows us to remove degeneracies inherent to each method alone and therefore to probe the mass distribution with greater accuracy than is possible with either method individually ( e.g. treu & koopmans 2002b ) .",
    "the gravitational lens system mg1549 + 305 is potentially very useful for studying the structure of early - type galaxies : the radio ring ( lehr et al .",
    "1993 )  one of the handful of rings known  provides a wealth of information on the inner mass distribution of the lens .",
    "furthermore , the lens is relatively nearby ( @xmath18 ; lehr et al .",
    "1993 ) and extended and is therefore ideally suited to study in great detail the structure of the lens galaxy .",
    "unfortunately , the redshift of the extremely red source has proven hard to measure , preventing the use of this system in detailed analyses of early - type lens galaxies ( e.g. van de ven et al .",
    "2003 did not include it in their sample ) . to allow for a prompt scientific exploitation of this lens system we publish the redshift before our full lensing and dynamical analyses of this system .    throughout the paper , we use @xmath19  kms@xmath8mpc@xmath8 , and we assume @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "spectroscopy of mg1549 + 305 ( figure  1 ) was performed on july 2122 2001 , using the echelle spectrograph and imager ( esi ; sheinis et al.2002 ) at the keck - ii telescope in echelle mode .",
    "the slit ( @xmath22 ) was centered on the lens galaxy g1 ( the notation of lehr et al .",
    "1993 is adopted throughout this paper ) , at position angle pa@xmath23 , i.e. aligned with the bar .",
    "this choice of pa yielded at the same time spectra of galaxies g2  an intervening late - type galaxy  and of the source of the radio ring , galaxy g3 .",
    "five exposures totalling 7800s were obtained , dithering along the slit by @xmath24 after each exposure . the seeing was @xmath25 and the nights were photometric .",
    "the spectra were reduced using the esi two - dimensional reduction iraf package easi2d developed by d.  j.  sand and t.  treu ( sand , treu , ellis 2002 ; sand et al .",
    "2003 , in preparation ) .",
    "relevant parts of the spectra of galaxies g2 and g3 are shown in figures  2 and 3 .",
    "several features yield unambiguously the redshift of g2 ( @xmath26 ; also [ oiii ] and h@xmath27 emission lines are detected at the appropriate wavelengths ) .",
    "in contrast , only one feature is detected for g3 in the entire spectral range 3,90010,500  . since the line is a doublet with the correct separation",
    "we identify it as [ oii]3726,3729  at @xmath28 .    to cross - check the redshift of g3 we measured the photometric properties of galaxy g3 .",
    "to this aim hubble space telescope ( hst ) images of mg1549 + 305 were taken from the hst archive and reduced as described in kt02a . the near infrared camera and multiple object spectrograph ( nicmos ; camera 2 ) image through filter f160w ( hereafter h@xmath29 ; total exposure time 1111.58s ; go7495 ; pi : falco ) is shown in figure  1 .",
    "photometry on the nicmos image was measured using sextractor ( bertin & arnouts 1996 ) , yielding a total magnitude ( mag_auto ) of the source of the radio ring ( galaxy g3 ) of h@xmath30 ( random+systematic errors ) .",
    "unfortunately , the wide field and planetary camera 2 ( wfpc2 ) images through filters f555w and f814w ( total exposure time 640s on the planetary camera ; go7495 ; pi : falco ) are rather shallow and galaxy g3 is undetected .",
    ".coordinates and redshifts of the galaxies in the mg1549 + 305 system .",
    "offsets are relative to the position of g3 , ra=15:49:12.87 dec=30:47:12.90 ( j2000 ) .",
    "uncertainties are @xmath31 on offsets and 0.001 on redshifts . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     we obtained deeper v and i band images using esi in imaging mode on july 26 2001 .",
    "the seeing was @xmath32 fwhm , conditions were photometric , and the exposure time totaled 300s per filter .",
    "photometric calibration , accurate to 0.05 mags , was obtained by imaging photometric standards ( landolt 1992 ) .",
    "the images were reduced in a standard manner . after matching the resolution of the nicmos image to the resolution of the ground based images , we measured the colors of g3 to be v ",
    "h@xmath33 and i ",
    "h@xmath34 ( @xmath35 total systematic uncertainty on the zero point calibration of nicmos and esi ) . the luminosity and",
    "colors of g3 are typical of radio galaxies at @xmath36 ( e.g. best et al .  1998 ;",
    "de breuck at al.2002 ) supporting the redshift identification .",
    "with the redshift of the source ( @xmath37 ) , we can derive some basic physical properties of the lens galaxy g1 . adopting the einstein radius by lehr et al .",
    "( 1993 ; @xmath38 ; see also rusin et al .",
    "2003 ) , the projected mass enclosed by the einstein radius is @xmath39  m@xmath40 and a singular isothermal ellipsoid ( sie ) velocity dispersion of @xmath41  kms@xmath8  is derived ( kormann et al .",
    "note that g2 is at an intermediate redshift between the lens and the source and a detailed lens model should therefore be done with at least two lens planes .",
    "however , g2 is a relatively faint late - type galaxy @xmath104@xmath42 away from g1 and can , for modeling purposes , be regarded as a minor perturber at the redshift of g1 ( kochanek & apostolakis 1988 ) .    using the effective radius ( @xmath43 ) , total magnitude and colors tabulated by rusin et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , we derive the magnitudes of the lens galaxy within the einstein radius , f814w=@xmath44 and f555w=@xmath45 , assuming an @xmath46 surface brightness profile . correcting to rest frame ( treu et al .",
    "2001 ) and for foreground extinction ( schlegel et al .",
    "1998 ) , the luminosity within the einstein radius is @xmath47  l@xmath12 .    the mass  to  light ratio enclosed by the einstein ring is then m@xmath48/l@xmath49@xmath50  m@xmath6/l@xmath12 , in the upper range of the typical stellar values for local early - type galaxies [ ( @xmath51  m@xmath6/l@xmath12  ; tk02a and references therein ] , but not dramatically larger .",
    "this suggests that dark matter is not dominant within the einstein radius , as expected given that it is similar to the effective radius ( e.g. kt02b ) . to show the presence of dark - matter inside the einstein radius more sophisticated dynamical and lens models are required",
    "nevertheless , it is already remarkable that despite the complex morphological inner structure of the barred lens galaxy g1 , the stellar velocity dispersion measured by lehr et al .",
    "( 1996 ) @xmath9 kms@xmath8 is in such good agreement with the equivalent singular isothermal ellipsoid velocity dispersion @xmath7kms@xmath8 .",
    "the system mg1549 + 305  with its detailed multi - colors hst images , a radio einstein ring and extended kinematic profiles along major and minor axes  is an ideal case to explore how this `` coincidence '' arises .",
    "the structure of the radio einstein ring provides unique information on the projected mass distribution while its relatively large angular size and luminosity makes it possible to derive accurate and spatially extended kinematic information along more then one axis .",
    "the combination of these constraints should allow us to accurately measure its internal mass distribution and orbital structure .",
    "a more detailed model of this system is being developed as part of the lsd survey .",
    "based on observations collected with the nasa / esa hst , obtained at stsci , which is operated by aura , under nasa contract nas5 - 26555 and at the w.m .",
