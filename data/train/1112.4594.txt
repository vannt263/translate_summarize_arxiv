    "we routinely produce bose - einstein condensates ( bec ) of rubidium 87 in the low field seeking @xmath75 hyperfine state with an experimental cycle time of approximately @xmath76s . before the final evaporation ramp in an optical trap we turn up a 1-dimensional optical lattice slicing the atomic cloud into eight pieces .",
    "since the lattice potential does not allow for tunneling between different sites on the experimental timescale , we start with eight independent samples with different mean total atom number @xmath38 per site on which the spin dynamics experiment is done in parallel .",
    "+ first we transfer the atoms to the @xmath77 state by a radio frequency ( rf ) @xmath78 pulse",
    ". a homogeneous magnetic offset field of approximately @xmath79 g is applied such that the second - order zeeman shift is sufficient to resolve the different rf transitions in the @xmath80 hyperfine multiplet .",
    "afterwards we remove spurious population in the @xmath81 states by a stern - gerlach technique .",
    "care is taken to adiabatically ramp down the offset field to its final value of @xmath82 g where we actively stabilize it by a fluxgate sensor based feedback loop  @xcite .",
    "the offset field is chosen such that both , state selective two - photon pulses between the @xmath83 and the @xmath52 states , as well as power broadened symmetric rf coupling between the @xmath49 and the @xmath84 states are possible . for the homodyning of single - mode quadratures local oscillators in @xmath81 are necessary , which we prepare by transferring a part of the population via symmetric rf coupling .",
    "the next step is a microwave @xmath78 pulse from @xmath77 to @xmath49 .",
    "+ spin dynamics is initiated by compensating the second - order zeeman and mean field shift ( in total @xmath85hz ) with microwave dressing of the @xmath49 level  @xcite .",
    "the dressing field is @xmath86khz blue detuned to the @xmath87 transition with a resonant microwave rabi frequency of @xmath88khz .",
    "this selective technique has the advantage that only spin dynamics between the @xmath89 states is resonant . in all experiments we allow for @xmath28ms of spin evolution in which the @xmath90 states become populated via spin changing collisions .",
    "+ for the measurement of the single - mode quadratures we now apply a two - photon @xmath91 pulse resonant with the @xmath92 transitions , where changing the phase of these pulses is equivalent to a change of the local oscillator phase .",
    "+ in order to realize the three - port beamsplitter scheme , i.e. to measure the two - mode quadratures after the spin evolution , we apply a single rf field for @xmath93s , which couples the @xmath49 and @xmath84 states .",
    "this corresponds to a @xmath94 coupling pulse , where the pulse angle is restricted by experimental considerations described below .",
    "for control of the local oscillator phase @xmath10 ( of the @xmath95 state ) we switch off the dressing field for a variable time @xmath96 ( between @xmath97ms and @xmath98ms ) before the coupling pulse , such that @xmath99 . in the case of the measurement of population difference @xmath43 no coupling is applied after the spin changing collisions .",
    "+ after the experimental sequences described above the population in the different zeeman states is measured .",
    "state and site selective imaging is achieved by a combination of the stern - gerlach technique and a high spatial resolution imaging system  @xcite .",
    "the stern - gerlach pulse , which separates the @xmath100 states , is aligned carefully with the magnetic offset field such that the following absorption imaging is a projective measurement of the population in the zeeman states @xmath101 defined with the quantization axis along the direction of the offset field .",
    "( * a * ) and @xmath102 ( * b * ) multiplet .",
    "the counting boxes for regions with atomic signal are shown in red , the boxes for technical noise measurement in green .",
    "the numbers indicate the zeeman sub state , which is the same in each row . due to the opposite sign of the magnetic moments",
    "these numbers are inverted between @xmath80 and @xmath102 .",
    "the size of the image in real space is given .",
    "note that the clouds for @xmath80 atoms are more extended in vertical direction due to the imaging sequence  @xcite . ]",
    "imaging is done in the high intensity regime and the column density ( atom number per pixel ) is calculated from the raw absorption data following the recipe in  @xcite .",
    "care is taken to assure a linear and well calibrated imaging system  @xcite . to obtain the atom number per state and lattice site",
    "we define counting boxes in which the column density is integrated .",
    "figure  [ figrawpic ] shows a typical single run picture with counting boxes indicated .",
    "two types of technical noise add to the atomic signal in the imaging process .",
    "the first is unavoidable photon shot noise ( @xmath103 atoms per box ) which we deduce from the data in each experimental run  @xcite .",
    "however , interference fringes due to the coherence of the imaging light make absorption imaging very sensitive to mechanical vibrations and cause excess noise .",
    "even though we discard images which show obviously strong interference fringes in the regions with no atomic signal ( one picture out of @xmath104 ) , the remaining ones still have a finite noise contribution due to large scale interference structures .",
    "these are very hard to avoid , but on an ensemble of pictures their contribution to the detected variance can be well measured .",
    "hence we define counting boxes in regions without atoms of the same size as those used to extract the atom numbers ( see fig .",
    "[ figrawpic ] ) and measure the excess variance .",
    "it corresponds typically to a noise level of @xmath105 atoms per box where we checked for the spatial homogeneity of the fringe noise over the relevant regions of the picture .",
    "the technical noise is gaussian and not correlated with the atomic noise to be measured .",
    "therefore we can subtract the independently measured noise contributions from the measured atom number variances .",
    "note that this subtraction is crucial for the reported results since the total background noise level corresponds to a variance of @xmath106 . without the noise correction we would measure sub - shot - noise fluctuations only for @xmath107 where @xmath108 ( see figure 2 of the main text ) .",
    "here it is important to note that the uncertainties on the experimental data given in this manuscript include the statistical uncertainty due to the noise subtraction . as a test for our noise calibration we analyzed pictures without atoms in the counting boxes and found possible systematic errors smaller than the statistical uncertainties .",
    "+ the dependence of all presented observables on the total atom number @xmath38 is obtained by binning the data in intervals of size @xmath109 .",
    "the use of a single site resolved optical lattice in our experiments has various advantages .",
    "two of them are rather obvious , the boost in statistics due to the parallel realization of eight experiments and the increased local confinement which is important for the validity of the single mode approximation . here",
    "we point out that inter - site correlations between the observables can be used to extract phase noise contributions stemming from environmental fluctuations .",
    "+ at a finite magnetic field @xmath110 the energy of the different zeeman states shifts differentially with @xmath110 which leads to phase noise in ramsey type experiments  @xcite , in which the integrated phase difference is mapped onto an observable population difference .",
    "the homodyning experiments reported in this manuscript are of similar type and the observed atom number differences are in principle sensitive to environmentally induced phase noise .",
    "magnetic field or microwave phase fluctuations in our experiment are mainly low frequency and homogeneous over a spatial region much bigger than the size of the entire lattice system",
    ". therefore they result in shot - to - shot fluctuations which are correlated between different lattice sites @xmath4 .",
    "+ figure  [ figcorr]a shows the measured inter - site correlations for a reference homodyning experiment with the local oscillator in the @xmath83 zeeman state and a coherently prepared state in the @xmath52 zeeman state .",
    "the inter - site correlations @xmath111 are calculated for the observed atom number differences @xmath112 ( @xmath26 and @xmath113 label the two zeeman states involved ) @xmath114 where @xmath115 is the atom number difference in site @xmath4 corrected for its mean and @xmath116 the standard deviation of @xmath117 .",
    "the experimental sequence is similar to the spin - changing collision evolution described above but spin dynamics was suppressed by tuning the process off resonance . since the relative phases are in this case initially defined by the coherent preparation ( corresponding to a non - vanishing mean of the single - mode quadrature ) , finite inter - site correlations @xmath118 are observed .",
    "their strength and sign depend on the difference in the total population per site @xmath119 which is due to the @xmath120 dependent mean field shift . in our experiment @xmath120 fluctuates little from shot to shot .",
    "thus , this population dependent energy offset results in a fixed difference in the integrated relative phases in different sites which causes correlations or anti - correlations depending on its magnitude . using the inter - site correlations to remove these technically induced phase fluctuations",
    "we reduce the observed fluctuations @xmath121 from approximately @xmath104 to @xmath122 times the noise limit of two coherent states .",
    "this shows that almost all environmental phase noise in our experiment is of common mode type and can be detected by the inter - site correlations .",
    "+ in contrast , for a quantum state with initially vanishing coherences such inter - site correlations can not build up such that one expects @xmath123 . in figure",
    "[ figcorr]b we plot the inter - site correlations for the signal mode homodyning experiment . here",
    "the @xmath124 zeeman state was populated by spin evolution .",
    "no statistically significant correlations are observed , excluding that the phase is randomized by environmental noise .",
    "we also tested for inter - site correlations in the signal - idler mode entanglement measurements ( fig .",
    "3a , b and 4 of the main text ) and found a vanishing signal @xmath123 excluding a significant influence of environmental noise .",
    "+ we emphasize that this characterization of classical de - phasing is crucial for the results presented in figure  4b of the main text , since we use different local oscillators to deduce the single- and two - mode quadratures .",
    "stronger classical de - phasing in the single - mode quadrature measurement compared to the two - mode measurement would result in a false bound for two - mode inseparability .",
    "the two - mode quadratures of signal ( @xmath125 ) and idler ( @xmath126 ) modes are measured by simultaneous symmetric radio - frequency coupling to the pump mode @xmath127 which serves as the local oscillator .",
    "this process is described by a unitary rotation @xmath128 in the three mode system generated by the hamiltonian @xmath129 where @xmath130 is planck s constant .",
    "experimentally the coupling is switched on and off non - adiabatically with a total pulse duration @xmath131 .",
    "the rotation ( mixing ) angle of the pulse is given by @xmath132 , which is defined such that a @xmath133 pulse transfers all population from the @xmath95 state to the @xmath90 states ( assuming they are initially empty ) .",
    "+ we choose a mixing angle of @xmath134 , since we have to make a tradeoff between signal - to - noise ratio ( optimal for @xmath135 ) and an unwanted spurious coupling between the @xmath136 and @xmath137 states , favoring a smaller mixing angle @xmath138 .",
    "the unitary transformation generated by the coupling hamiltonian ( [ eq.hcpl ] ) is described by the matrix @xmath139 with @xmath140 , @xmath141 .",
    "the mode operators @xmath142 in the heisenberg - picture after the coupling pulse are obtained by applying the matrix @xmath143 to @xmath144 .",
    "the phase shift @xmath10 of the local oscillator before the pulse is described by the substitution @xmath145 . for the sake of clarity this abbreviation",
    "is used in the following without the explicit phase dependence .      for the experimentally measured population difference @xmath146 in the @xmath90 states we find @xmath147 the second term is , up to a @xmath55 phase shift of the @xmath148 mode , proportional to the generalized two - mode quadratures @xmath149 in the limit of a large local oscillator ( @xmath150 ) the generalized two - mode quadratures correspond to the canonical ones  @xcite . with the normalization factor @xmath151 and by using @xmath152 and @xmath153 we obtain the measured upper bound @xmath154 the symbol @xmath155 indicates the variance of the subsequent variable .",
    "the local oscillator phase independent variance offset ( second term ) which is proportional to the variance of the population difference @xmath156 is small ( approximately @xmath157 ) for small total atom numbers ( @xmath158 ) and increases to approximately @xmath159 for @xmath160 .",
    "the terms in the last line vanish due to their strong sensitivity to magnetic field fluctuations ( @xmath161hz / mg ) . at this sensitivity",
    "the coherence time in our experiment is approximately @xmath162ms which results in @xmath163 after @xmath28ms of spin evolution .",
    "+      the second important two - mode quadrature @xmath164 i.e. , the sum of the two single mode quadratures , can be measured less precise in the current scheme , however , an upper bound for its variance can be obtained .",
    "for the sum of the population in the @xmath90 states @xmath165 we obtain @xmath166 the third term @xmath167 is proportional to the two - mode quadrature @xmath168 , which is the only local oscillator phase dependent term .",
    "covariance terms between this one and the three other terms in equation ( [ eq.sumquad ] ) vanish due to their strong sensitivity to magnetic field fluctuations ( see above ) .",
    "hence , one obtains the upper bound for the two - mode quadrature sum @xmath169 where the constant offset due to the variance of the phase independent terms in equation ( [ eq.sumquad ] ) limits the obtainable precision when deducing @xmath170 from our measurements . note that the normalisations for @xmath171 and @xmath172 are different . a future extension of this scheme to measure also the sum of the single mode quadratures with high precision and therefore both quadrature einstein - podolsky - rosen variables  @xcite would require the splitting of the local oscillator prior to the coupling , such that the phase of the two coupling fields can be tuned independently  @xcite .",
