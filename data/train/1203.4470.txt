    "neutron - rich isotopes have become increasingly more accessible to experiments requiring accelerated beams or trapped ions in recent years , and regions long unexplored are now being probed . penning",
    "trap mass spectrometers are taking advantage of stopped fission and reaction products from gas catchers  @xcite and isol facilities  @xcite to give direct measurements of these nuclidic masses to high precision .",
    "the masses of nuclides far from stability are of interest for a variety of fields , including astrophysics and nuclear structure  @xcite .    in particular , the rapid neutron - capture process ( @xmath2 process )  @xcite path",
    "is predicted to lie mostly in the region of unmeasured neutron - rich nuclides which is beginning to come into reach of precision study .",
    "determination of neutron separation energies ( @xmath5 ) from nuclear masses is critical for establishing the path of the @xmath2 process , which is thought to lie near the line @xmath6  mev , and is important for numerical simulations of @xmath2-process dynamics in different environments  @xcite .",
    "much of the path is still inaccessible to experiment , but extending mass measurements closer to it provides information to better constrain mass models and extrapolations to the proposed @xmath2-process path and further still to the neutron dripline .",
    "additionally , the appearance of neutron sub - shells , regions of deformation  @xcite , and shell quenching  @xcite could be discovered via examination of @xmath7 trends .",
    "continuing a previous program of fission fragment mass measurements  @xcite , the canadian penning trap ( cpt ) at argonne national laboratory has measured the masses of 40 neutron - rich nuclides from z=51 to 64 near the target precision of @xmath8 , or .",
    "this paper reports on the results and techniques of those measurements , and compares the results to previous measurements and the mass models on which @xmath2-process simulations depend .",
    "the cpt and associated equipment have been described elsewhere  @xcite , but details emphasizing recent additions relevant to these measurements will be presented here . the system , illustrated in fig .  [ fig : system ] , consists of a gas catcher for stopping reaction products , a radio frequency quadrupole ( rfq ) cooler and buncher , an isotope separator penning trap , and a linear paul trap for accumulation and staging of ions before injection in the precision penning trap .",
    "upgrades since the last cpt measurements in the neutron - rich region  @xcite include a larger - volume gas catcher with a stronger fission source and a higher - resolution isotope separator in a superconducting magnet .",
    "the gas catcher @xcite was designed to stop and cool ions produced either from an internal spontaneous fission source or from reactions using beams from the argonne tandem - linac accelerator system ( atlas ) .",
    "this work was performed with fission fragments from a @xmath1cf source placed behind a gold degrader foil with thickness optimized for collection of fragments in the heavy peak .",
    "the @xmath9  m - length cylindrical gas catcher is filled with @xmath10@xmath11  torr of purified helium gas which stops the fission products through collision and ionization .",
    "a large fraction , roughly @xmath12@xmath10% , of these fission products stop as singly- or doubly - charged ions in the helium gas .",
    "an electrostatic gradient placed along the catcher axis pushes the ions toward the exit nozzle , while an rf ion guide  @xcite keeps the ions from touching the walls and neutralizing . at the downstream end",
    "the ion guide forms an rf funnel leading to the exit nozzle , where gas flow pushes the ions into the next stage .",
    "ions are carried away from the gas catcher nozzle by an rfq ion guide  @xcite , and are separated from the helium gas by the combined effects of electric fields and differential pumping .",
    "the ions are accumulated and bunched in a linear paul trap at the end of the rfq , where they are cooled further in @xmath13  torr room - temperature helium gas . for these measurements ,",
    "after @xmath14  ms of accumulation the ion bunch is ejected from the trap into the beamline to the rest of the system .",
    "next , the ions are transferred to the isotope separator , where the ion bunches are purified .",
    "the isotope separator is a gas - filled cylindrical penning trap  @xcite with a superconducting magnet . penning traps",
    "allow two orbital motions of the trapped ions : the modified cyclotron motion with frequency @xmath15 and the much slower magnetron motion with frequency @xmath16 , which are coupled by a cyclotron excitation @xmath17 . in the isotope separator ,",
    "all ions are pushed outward by a mass - insensitive rf dipole field driven at @xmath16 while the ions of interest are re - centered in the trap by the application of a mass - sensitive rf quadrupole field at the @xmath18 frequency of those ions .",
    "the result is the accumulation of a purified sample of the desired ions with a mass resolving power of approximately @xmath19 over the mass range studied here .",
    "this is sufficient to remove ions of different mass number as well as any hydrocarbon contaminants that may be at the same mass number . in cases where remaining molecular contamination is suspected ,",
    "a strong dipole excitation at the reduced cyclotron frequency is applied to break up the molecules via gas collisions during the cleaning process .",
    "after cleaning , ions are transferred to a second linear paul trap where multiple bunches from the isotope separator are accumulated and cooled before transfer to the precision penning trap .",
    "the cpt mass spectrometer consists of a hyperbolic penning trap  @xcite in a highly stable magnetic field and ultra - high vacuum , where masses are measured using the time - of - flight technique  @xcite .",
    "the main electrodes approximate hyperboloids of revolution , with apertures in the endcaps for ion entry and ejection and a splitting of the ring electrode into quadrants so that quadrupole excitations may be applied .",
    "additional electrodes are placed between the endcaps and the ring to correct for the finite extent of the trap , and correction electrodes placed outside the endcaps prevent field penetration through the endcap apertures  @xcite .",
    "after an ion bunch is captured in this trap , the highest energy ions are evaporated away by briefly lowering the voltage of a correction tube and allowing them to escape .",
    "this is done both to keep only those ions which are in the region of the trap with the most homogeneous magnetic field and to decrease the ion time - of - flight spread .",
    "any contaminants suspected to survive the isotope separator are then removed by a @xmath14- to @xmath20-ms dipole excitation at the @xmath15 of those ions .",
    "next , a dipole excitation at @xmath16 is applied for @xmath21  ms to position the ions in an orbit with the desired radius .",
    "the last step inside the penning trap is the application of a quadrupole excitation at a candidate cyclotron frequency for @xmath22 to @xmath23  ms .",
    "if the frequency applied matches the actual cyclotron frequency , the slow magnetron motion previously induced is converted to the much faster modified cyclotron motion at the same orbital radius  @xcite .",
    "a typical @xmath24 ratio is @xmath25 , thus the orbital kinetic energy increases by a factor of @xmath26 . after this final excitation",
    "the ion bunch is ejected from the trap and drifts down a long beam line to either an mcp or channeltron time - of - flight detector outside the magnet .",
    "as the ions travel through the gradient of the main magnetic field , the orbital motion is converted adiabatically to linear motion , accelerating the ions down the line .",
    "thus an application of a quadrupole field closer to the ion s true @xmath18 will result in a lower time of flight than a frequency farther away . by scanning frequencies over successive bunches of ions , the minimum in time of flight can be found , and a measurement of the the ion s @xmath18 made . because the frequency is applied with a square amplitude envelope ,",
    "the time - of - flight spectrum reflects that envelope s fourier transform : a sinc function .",
    "the cyclotron frequency of a calibrant ion of well - known mass is measured in the same manner , and the ratio of the frequencies is taken to cancel out the magnetic field term .",
    "the mass of the neutral atom is then given by the calibrant mass and frequency ratio , with additional terms to compensate for the charge states and the masses of electrons not present given the charge states : @xmath27 where the subscript ` cal ' refers to the calibrant , @xmath28 is the integer charge state , and @xmath29 is the mass of the electron . alternatively ,",
    "if multiple calibrant species are used , those frequency measurements can be combined as a single magnetic field strength measurement via @xmath30 , which can then be used to determine the unknown masses from their cyclotron frequency measurements . in either case , the calibrations need to be taken only as frequently as is required to monitor magnetic field drift , rather than after every measurement of an unknown ion .",
    "atomic binding energies are small enough to be neglected for these measurements .",
    "example time - of - flight scans are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : resonances ] .",
    "following fission - fragment measurements made with a smaller gas catcher and source and a previous isotope separator  @xcite , a new series of measurements in the @xmath1cf fission heavy peak began in april 2008 .",
    "the nuclides studied , identified in fig .",
    "[ fig : chart ] , can be divided into two components : the heaviest nuclides , from pr to gd , were measured in the @xmath31 charge state over @xmath32weeks from april to july 2008 ; the lighter nuclides in the heavy peak , from sb to cs , were measured in the @xmath33 charge state over 4  weeks in february and march 2009 .",
    "high charge states are advantageous for mass measurements because their higher cyclotron frequencies lead to lower uncertainties in mass for the same uncertainty in frequency . however , due to interactions with the helium gas used to stop and cool the ions in preparation for the precision penning trap , they are limited to only @xmath33 or @xmath31 in practice . the division of charge states in these measurements is due to the high ionization potential at the xe electron shell closure , which allows the fission fragments with @xmath34 to survive as @xmath31 , but not those with @xmath35 .",
    "excitation times used for candidate cyclotron frequencies range from 200 to 2000  ms , depending on the lifetime of the nuclide being studied and the conditions inside the trap .",
    "the total duration of each measurement  typically 1 to 30  h  was dictated by the target precision of one part in @xmath36 , the yield of ions out of the gas catcher , and the ultimate purity of the sample in the penning trap . to calibrate the @xmath31 measurements , which range in mass - to - charge ratio from @xmath37 to @xmath38 , the cyclotron frequencies of @xmath39c@xmath40h@xmath41 , @xmath42kr@xmath43 , and @xmath44kr@xmath43 were measured approximately once per measurement week , and all of the calibration measurements were combined to give a single value for the magnetic field . for the @xmath33 measurements ,",
    "@xmath45xe@xmath43 was measured at least once per measurement week . in all weeks",
    "but one , at least one calibration resonance was taken with identical excitation time as used in that period to determine the fitting - function parameters to be used . for @xmath45i ,",
    "no calibration was taken with the same excitation time as the measurement because of an unplanned interruption in the experiment . to calibrate this measurement ,",
    "the results of a calibration were used , and the width of the resonance was scaled from that calibration fit .",
    "table  [ tbl : calibrants ] lists the mass values used for each calibrant , and tables  [ tbl:1+_cal ] and [ tbl:2+_cal ] list the cyclotron frequency ratios of each measured ion to each calibration ion .",
    ".mass values used for magnetic field calibrations . for the molecule , the mass listed is that of the ion plus the mass of an electron .",
    "the noble gas masses are those of neutral atoms .",
    "relative weights are given for the influence of each calibrant s mass on the corresponding set of measurements : @xmath45xe@xmath43 for the @xmath33 and the others for @xmath31 . [ cols=\"^,>,<,^,^ \" , ]     after the first week of @xmath33 measurements , an electrical discharge occurred in or near the precision penning trap .",
    "a lasting result of this discharge was an additional trap imperfection , possibly due to some surface charge deposited on a trap electrode .",
    "resonances taken under these conditions show an asymmetry , the effect of which had to be mitigated in the analysis as described below . a study undertaken with various stable xe isotopes  @xcite found a systematic effect of only @xmath46 under these conditions , which is well below the statistical uncertainties in these measurements .",
    "most time - of - flight spectra were fit with a modified sinc function , which includes a parameter accounting for the possible over- or under - conversion from the @xmath16 to @xmath15 motions  @xcite .",
    "for the data taken in the week following the discharge the time - of - flight spectrum showed an asymmetry in the side bands , pulling the modified sinc fit to the low - frequency side .",
    "a gaussian function was used to fit that week s data to minimize this problem , and the uncertainties were appropriately inflated due to the increased @xmath47 of these fits . in all cases cuts",
    "were placed on the number of detected ions from a single ion bunch to minimize systematic effects discussed below .",
    "there are several possible sources of systematic error , the largest of which are listed here .",
    "as the magnetic field drifts , @xmath18 will change , but the superconducting magnet is extremely stable ( fig .  [",
    "fig : calibrants_time ] ) , with the field drift measured to be @xmath48  ppb / day over a two - month period .",
    "effects of trap misalignment and electric field imperfections are suppressed to high order  @xcite . in the weeks following the aforementioned discharge ,",
    "the measured @xmath18 value for @xmath45xe@xmath43 drifted up @xmath49  ppb / day as the trap recovered .",
    "this small potential source of error during this time was mitigated by using a calibration taken within one week of each measurement to calculate the mass .",
    "the ion cloud s charge alters the electric field of the trap , but the effect on the @xmath18 value has been measured to be @xmath50  ppb per detected ion under normal conditions  @xcite , and @xmath51  ppb per detected ion with the post - discharge effect during these measurements .",
    "this effect will be suppressed if the trap population during measurement and calibration are kept low , as was the case here with the average number of detected ions per ejection ranging from 0.03 to 3.1 for the ions of interest , and below 7 for the calibration ions .",
    "contaminant ions of similar mass can have a separate effect as the ion motions interfere with each other .",
    "based on a 100 ppb limit at 15  ions  @xcite , we estimate the effect to have an upper limit of @xmath52  ppb for the 3-ion maximum rate here . the reference frequency used by the @xmath18 signal generator",
    "was compared to a rb frequency standard and measured to be stable to @xmath53  ppb over a two - week period .",
    "mass - dependent effects in the precision penning trap were investigated as part of a very high precision study of xe isotopes  @xcite .",
    "a frequency - dependent attenuation of the applied @xmath18 amplitude was found at @xmath54/khz over the frequency range corresponding to @xmath55 from 113 to 165 .",
    "this , combined with a measured @xmath18 centroid dependence on amplitude due to the dodecapole moment of the trap , gives a variation of @xmath56 , which is again mitigated by using calibrants of similar mass .",
