    "the investigation of non - classical correlations in mixed states of composite quantum systems has attracted strong attention in recent years . while in pure states",
    "such correlations can be identified with entanglement @xcite , in the case of mixed states , separable ( unentangled ) states , defined in general as convex mixtures of product states @xcite , i.e. , as states which can be generated by local operations and classical communication ( locc ) , may still exhibit non - classical features .",
    "the latter emerge from the possible non - commutativity of the different products and lead , for instance , to a finite value of the quantum discord @xcite and other recently introduced related quantifiers of quantum correlations @xcite .",
    "these quantifiers include the one - way information deficit @xcite , the geometric discord @xcite , generalized entropic measures @xcite and more recently the local quantum uncertainty @xcite and the trace distance discord @xcite . while entanglement is certainly necessary for quantum teleportation @xcite and for an exponential speed - up in pure state based quantum computation @xcite , interest on these new measures has been triggered by the existence of mixed state based quantum algorithms like that of @xcite , able to achieve an exponential speedup over the best classical algorithms for a certain task , with vanishing entanglement @xcite but finite quantum discord @xcite . and various operational interpretations of the quantum discord and other related measures",
    "have been provided @xcite .    in this article",
    "we will concentrate on the quantum discord @xcite and the generalized entropic measures of @xcite , which include as particular cases the von neumann based one - way information deficit @xcite and the geometric discord @xcite , and which represent a generalized information deficit .",
    "the quantum discord as well as all other related measures require a rather complex minimization over a local measurement or operation which has limited their applicability to small systems or special states .",
    "the optimization problem for the quantum discord was in fact recently shown to be np complete @xcite .",
    "the advantage of the generalized entropic formalism is , first , the possibility of using simpler entropic forms like the linear entropy , which , as will be discussed in section 2 , enables an easier evaluation ( it does not require the diagonalization of the density matrix ) and a more direct experimental access ( it can be determined without a full state tomography ) .",
    "this entails that an explicit solution of the associated optimization problem for certain states can be achieved .",
    "the generalized formalism also allows to identify some universal properties , i.e.  valid for any entropic form ( and not just for a particular choice of entropy ) satisfied by the post - measurement state .",
    "we first provide in section 2 an overview of the main concepts and properties associated with these measures .",
    "we then apply these measures to examine the quantum correlations of spin pairs in the exact ground state of finite spin @xmath1 chains with @xmath0-type couplings in a transverse magnetic field , through their entanglement , quantum discord and information deficit .",
    "all separations between the pairs are considered .",
    "several important studies of the quantum discord in spins chains have been made @xcite , but the relation with the generalized information deficit and the differences between their optimizing measurements in these spin pairs have not yet been analyzed in detail .",
    "we have recently investigated these aspects for an @xmath2 spin chain in @xcite , and will here extend this analysis to the anisotropic @xmath0 case .",
    "it is first shown that in contrast with the pair entanglement , the quantum discord and the information deficit exhibit , for the exact ground state of these chains , common features such as an appreciable finite value below the critical field , for all separations .",
    "moreover , they approach a finite _ common non - zero value _ @xcite at the remarkable factorizing field @xcite that these chains can exhibit in the anisotropic case . on the other hand , we will also show that important differences between the quantum discord on the one side , and the standard and generalized information deficit on the other side , do arise in the minimizing local spin measurement that defines them . while in the quantum discord the direction of the latter is always orthogonal to the transverse field , in the other measures it exhibits a perpendicular to parallel transition as the field increases , which is present for all separations and which reflects significant qualitative changes in the reduced state of the pair .",
    "this difference indicates a distinct response of the minimizing measurement of these quantities to the onset of quantum correlations .",
    "we start by providing a brief overview of the basic notions . a pure state @xmath3 of a bipartite system @xmath4 is separable iff ( if and only if ) it is a product state @xmath5 .",
    "otherwise it is entangled .",
    "the schmidt decomposition @xcite @xmath6 where @xmath7 denote orthonormal states for subsystem @xmath8 and @xmath9 , @xmath10 , allows to easily distinguish separable pure states ( @xmath11 ) from entangled states ( @xmath12 ) .",
    "here @xmath13 is the schmidt rank of @xmath3 ( @xmath14 $ ] , with @xmath15 the hilbert space dimensions of @xmath8 ) .",
    "pure sate entanglement can be measured by the entanglement entropy @xcite @xmath16 where @xmath17 , are the reduced states of @xmath8 and @xmath18 is the von neumann entropy .",
    "we will set in what follows @xmath19 , such that @xmath20 for a maximally entangled two - qubit state ( @xmath21 , @xmath22 ) .    on the other hand , a general mixed state @xmath23 ( @xmath24 , @xmath25 ) of a bipartite system @xmath4",
    "is separable iff it can be expressed as a _",
    "convex mixture _ of product states @xcite : @xmath26 where @xmath27 and @xmath28 denote mixed states for subsystem @xmath29 .",
    "otherwise , it is entangled .",
    "the meaning is that a separable state can be created by locc , i.e. , alice prepares a state @xmath30 with probability @xmath31 and tells bob to prepare a partner state @xmath32 .    for pure states @xmath33 , eq.([3s ] )",
    "is equivalent to the previous definition ( @xmath34 ) , but in the case of mixed states , product states @xmath35 are just a very particular case of separable states .",
    "the latter also include : a ) _ classically correlated states _ , i.e. states diagonal in a standard product basis @xmath36 , @xmath37 where @xmath38 and @xmath39 are orthonormal states of @xmath8 , b ) _ classically correlated states from one of the subsystems _ , say @xmath40 , which are of the form @xmath41 where @xmath42 and @xmath43 are states of @xmath44 , and which are then diagonal in a _",

    "the latter typically possess entangled eigenstates .",
    "for this reason , it is much more difficult to determine whether a mixed state is separable or entangled .",
    "the well known positive partial transpose criterion @xcite ( @xmath47 , with @xmath48 for @xmath49 ) provides a necessary criterion for separability , which is sufficient for two - qubit or qubit - qutrit states .    for mixed states , the marginal entropies",
    "@xmath50 , @xmath51 no longer provide a measure of entanglement .",
    "instead , it is possible to use the entanglement of formation @xcite , defined through the convex roof extension of the pure state definition : @xmath52 where the minimization is over all decompositions of @xmath23 as convex mixtures of pure states ( @xmath53 , @xmath27 ) and @xmath54 is the entanglement entropy of the pure state @xmath55 .",

    "its evaluation is , however , difficult in general .",

    "this is not the case for entangled states nor for separable states not of the form ( [ 4cc ] ) or ( [ 5cc ] ) .",

    "<S> we examine the behavior of quantum correlations of spin pairs in a finite anisotropic @xmath0 spin chain immersed in a transverse magnetic field , through the analysis of the quantum discord and the conventional and quadratic one way - information deficits . </S>",
    "<S> we first provide a brief review of these measures , showing that the last ones can be obtained as particular cases of a generalized information deficit based on general entropic forms . </S>",
    "<S> all these measures coincide with an entanglement entropy in the case of pure states , but can be non - zero in separable mixed states , vanishing just for classically correlated states . </S>",
    "<S> it is then shown that their behavior in the exact ground state of the chain exhibits similar features , deviating significantly from that of the pair entanglement below the critical field . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast with entanglement , they reach full range in this region , becoming independent of the pair separation and coupling range in the immediate vicinity of the factorizing field . </S>",
    "<S> it is also shown , however , that significant differences between the quantum discord and the information deficits arise in the local minimizing measurement that defines them . </S>",
    "<S> both analytical and numerical results are provided . </S>"
