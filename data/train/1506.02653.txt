    "the local white dwarf population preserves detailed information on the galactic star formation history .",
    "nearly 95% of all stars will end their lives as white dwarfs , and most @xmath1 stars ever formed are now stellar remnants .",
    "white dwarf cooling is well understood in terms of the underlying physics @xcite , and has been used to estimate the age of the galactic disc ( e.g. @xcite ) , individual open clusters ( e.g. @xcite ) , and the halo @xcite .    broader application of this method has been prevented so far by the small and incomplete samples of known white dwarfs . because of their small radii , white dwarfs are intrinsically faint , requiring moderately large telescope apertures for their study .",
    "consequently the currently available luminosity functions contain at best a few thousand stars @xcite , based on white dwarfs identified by sdss .",
    "however , incompleteness and selection biases severely limit the constraints that can be drawn from these studies .",
    "@xcite demonstrated the potential of a complete and well - characterised white dwarf sample to derive the local star formation history and initial mass function , using only the 117 white dwarfs known within 20pc of the sun , though obviously limited by small number statistics .    combining parallax , apparent magnitude , proper motion and bp / rp colour",
    ", gaia will overcome all the traditional limitations in the discovery of white dwarfs .",
    "the @xmath2 white dwarfs that gaia will identify ( fig.[f : gaia_wds ] ) will be 100% complete within @xmath3pc , and @xmath3% out to 300pc @xcite",
    ". the sample of gaia white dwarfs will be sufficiently large to reconstruct the stellar formation history and initial mass function for the thin / thick disc and halo separately and assess the ages of these three components individually .",
    "however , while gaia will identify the entire local white dwarf population , it will not provide the data that is necessary to determine accurate masses and temperatures , which are the key parameters for measuring the white dwarf cooling ages .",
    "the spectral resolution of the bp / rp spectra is too low to apply the standard method for measuring temperatures and surface gravities from the stark - broadened balmer line profiles ( fig.[f : sdss1228 ] ; e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "this implies that ground - based follow - up is essential to unlock the diagnostic potential that the gaia white dwarfs have for investigating the galactic star formation history . to break",
    "the degeneracy between temperature and surface gravity requires spectroscopy covering the higher balmer lines down to @xmath4 nm ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which are most sensitive to surface gravity , and hence mass .",
    "several of the forthcoming wide - area mos instruments are perfectly suited for this goal , including desi , weave , and 4most .",
    "gaia will also not obtain radial velocities of white dwarfs , as they typically have no spectral features in the rvs wavelength range , and are too faint for rvs spectroscopy anyway . to establish the galactic orbits , and hence thin / thick disc or halo membership , radial velocities of the gaia white dwarfs have to be obtained from the ground .",
    "this is most efficiently done by intermediate - resolution ( @xmath5 ) spectroscopy of the sharp nlte core in h@xmath6 @xcite .",
    "_ the initial - to - final mass ( ifm ) relation . _",
    "the physics of mass loss on the rgb / agb is still poorly understood , and lacks stringent observational constraints .",
    "yet , it is of crucial importance for the galactic lifecycle of matter , and for the chemical evolution of galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "traditionally , the ifm relation has been investigated using white dwarfs in open clusters @xcite , and gaia will significantly add to the known population of white dwarfs in open clusters .",
    "gaia , coupled with ground - based spectroscopy will also fully enable the potential of wide binaries to constrain the low - mass end of the ifm relation @xcite .",
    "_ the mass - radius ( m - r ) relation . _ despite its fundamental importance , from predicting white dwarf masses to understanding the nature of snia , this relation is very poorly constrained by observations @xcite .",
    "spectroscopic observations of white dwarfs can not directly determine both mass and radius , and therefore parallaxes are needed to independently determine the radius .",
    "currently only a handful of white dwarfs have parallaxes accurate to better than 5% , but gaia will improve this situation dramatically , both in terms of raw numbers of white dwarf parallaxes , as well as their accuracy .",
    "spectroscopic follow - up covering the higher balmer lines is essential to reach a few percent precision on both mass and radius .",
    "the internal stratification of white dwarfs can then be constrained by comparing the observed m - r relation with theoretical relations assuming different interior compositions ( 35% effect on the m - r relation ) .",
    "accurate knowledge of the core compositions will also vastly improve the derived cooling ages , which are essential for the galactic archeology applications .",
    "_ rare white dwarfs .",
    "_ sdss has thoroughly demonstrated the _ huge _ discovery potential of a large spectroscopic survey of white dwarfs .",
    "follow - up of the gaia white dwarfs will be essential to improve our understanding of rare evolution channels such as c / o - atmosphere white dwarfs , that may be remnants of s - agb stars ( e.g. @xcite ) , strongly magnetic white dwarfs that can be used as laboratories for physics under extreme conditions @xcite , and dynamically active evolved planetary systems ( e.g. @xcite , see fig.[f : sdss1228 ] ) . throughout the last decade ,",
    "it has become clear that white dwarfs serve not only as tracers of stellar evolution and star formation , but provide equally important information on the formation , structure , and evolution of planetary systems .",
    "many white dwarfs ( @xmath7% ) show signatures of planetary systems in the form of metal - pollution of their otherwise gravitationally settled pure - h / he atmospheres ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "these metals , accreted from disrupted planetary bodies , provide the only method to directly measure the bulk composition of extra - solar planetary systems , including the detection of water - rich planetesimals ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "gaia follow - up spectroscopy will be essential to increase the known sample of metal - polluted white dwarfs .",
    "the strongest tracer of planetary debris is the cah / k doublet , again requiring blue coverage down to @xmath4 nm at intermediate - resolution to detect the most polluted objects .",
    "_ snia progenitors . _",
    "although double - degenerate white dwarf binaries are one of the likely populations to produce snia , the current census of these stars is utterly inadequate to test population models and predictions of snia rates and delay time distributions @xcite .",
    "the largest dedicated search for double - degenerates covered only a few hundred stars @xcite , and found a close binary fraction of @xmath8% .",
    "time - resolved spectroscopy of the gaia white dwarfs using desi / weave/4most sub - spectra has the potential to identify 1000s of close double - degenerates , spanning the entire parameter space in mass , mass ratio , and orbital period .",
    "the key goal is to obtain low resolution ( @xmath5 ) spectroscopy of the entire local white dwarf population identified by gaia to maximize the number of thick disk and halo white dwarfs , as well as massive ( @xmath9 ) white dwarfs in the thin disk .",
    "massive white dwarfs make up @xmath10% of the population ( e.g. @xcite ) , and a luminosity function of @xmath11 of these stars will determine the star formation rate of short - lived a / b stars to within @xmath12% throughout the age of the thin disk with a time resolution of a few 100myr @xcite .",
    "the necessary number of fibres is small , @xmath13 ( fig.[f : gaia_wds ] ) , only @xmath14% of the fibres available in each desi , weave , or 4most field .",
    "white dwarfs are intrinsically faint , and hence to zeroth order isotropically distributed , and should be multiplexed into all wide - area spectroscopic surveys to maximise the total survey area / number of observed targets .",
    "the bulk of the gaia white dwarf population will have @xmath15 .",
    "given the proximity of most white dwarfs , even at the faint end , the gaia parallaxes will still be spectacularly good ( 5% at 100pc for the faintest white dwarfs in the sample ) . based on our experience with sdss ( 2.5 m aperture ) , a mos on a 4 m aperture",
    "should deliver a signal - to - noise ratio of @xmath16 in a typical 1h exposure , which is amply sufficient for the stellar parameter determination . also based on sdss ( @xmath17 ) ,",
    "we expect a radial velocity uncertainty from the @xmath18 line cores measured from desi , weave , or 4most low - res spectra to be @xmath19km / s , well sufficient to determine the galactic population membership .",
    "the gaia - based selection of white dwarfs relies on the second data release ( positions , proper motions , parallaxes , integrated xp photometry , and @xmath20-magnitudes ) expected in early 2017 .",
    "because of their small radii ( @xmath21 ) , white dwarfs will be extreme outliers in the gaia hertzsprung - russell diagram , and their identification will be trivial and free of contaminants .",
    "should there be a delay in this data release , we will fall back onto an efficient multi - colour plus reduced proper motion selection that works very well in the sdss footprint @xcite .",
    "we are in the process of extending this selection to the southern hemisphere making use of the vst / atlas survey , as well as panstarrs 3pi and skymapper in the near future .",
    "higher - resolution ( @xmath22 ) weave and 4most spectroscopy of the brightest gaia white dwarfs ( @xmath23 ) would help to increase the radial velocity resolution obtained from h@xmath6 , and to improve the sensitivity to metal pollution in cah / k , or mgii 447 nm ( fig.[f : sdss1228 ] ) ."
