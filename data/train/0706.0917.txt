    "the exciting suggestion@xcite that @xmath1 supergravity ( sugra ) might be perturbatively finite in four dimensions ( @xmath4 ) raises several possibilities .    1 .",
    "if it is not perturbatively finite then @xmath1 sugra can only be considered in the context of the compactification of string theory , with the string theory serving as regulator .",
    "2 .   if @xmath4 , @xmath1 sugra is perturbatively finite then there are three possibilities 1 .",
    "it is a finite theory of quantum gravity , distinct from string theory , or 2 .",
    "@xmath1 sugra in @xmath4 is not a new quantum theory of gravity distinct from string theory . if this is the case , at least in principle one should be able to exhibit all the phenomenon expected of the zero - slope limit of string theory , including the infinite number of zero - mass or low - mass states discussed by green , et .",
    "@xcite , or 3 .",
    "the theory could be perturbatively finite , but non - perturbatively inconsistent .",
    "that is , the thoery could lack a non - perturbative completion . as such , the theory could be in `` swampland '' @xcite .    in previous work",
    "@xcite it was shown that all of the elementary fields of non - abelian gauge theories lie on regge trajectories , with an important example being the gluon and quarks of qcd .",
    "it was also shown that the elementary fields of @xmath1 sugra lie on regge trajectories as well@xcite . exploiting the klt relations@xcite , which imply a close relationship between @xmath1 sugra and @xmath0 ym theory , it was then shown @xcite that the factorization conditions for the reggeization of the gluon of @xmath0 ym theory implies the reggeization of the graviton of @xmath1 sugra if the latter theory is perturbatively finite or , at most logarithmically divergent .",
    "supersymmetry and flavor symmetry then imply that all the elementary fields should reggeize . thus ,",
    "if @xmath1 sugra is perturbatively finite , it contains regge trajectories with slope of @xmath5 , consistent with the view that @xmath1 sugra could produce the regge trajectories of perturbative string states .    in @xcite analyticity and mandelstam counting @xcite imply that the reggeization is valid to all orders in perturbation theory , though there is no information on the global properties of the trajectories from perturbative calculations , e.g. the existence of recurrences .",
    "the methods of @xcite only give the regge trajectory and residue to leading order in couplings , though this does not detract from the all - order existence of reggeization mentioned above .",
    "it is believed that these leading order results should also be obtainable from the sum of an infinite subclass of diagrams , analogous to the sum of ladder graphs of @xmath6 scalar field theory , keeping only the leading logarithm contributions in the regge limit .",
    "one of the objectives of this paper is to consider the sum of analogous diagrams in leading logarithm approximation for @xmath1 sugra and @xmath0 ym theory .",
    "it is known that the gluon - gluon scattering amplitude of @xmath0 ym theory and graviton - graviton scattering of @xmath1 sugra can be expressed schematically as ( kinematical factors)@xmath7(graphs of scalar field theory)@xcite . in both cases",
    "one particular infinite subset of graphs is that of @xmath6 ladder graphs . in the limit of large mandelstam @xmath8 , fixed @xmath9 ( the regge limit ) , we show in this paper that in the leading logarithm approximation , one finds @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the regge trajectory function to leading order , which passes through @xmath12 for the graviton , in perfect agreement with @xcite .",
    "the discussion of the gluon trajectory , which is more delicate , depending on details of the ir cutoff , is presented in section 2 . also in section 2 , we consider the implications of the bern , dixon , smirnov ( bds)@xcite , conjecture for the regge limit of planar gluon - gluon scattering in @xmath0 ym theory .",
    "in theories with regge poles , there are also moving regge cuts .",
    "such regge cuts can not appear from sums of planar graphs @xcite , so that any regge cuts are suppressed by at least @xmath13 in large n , su(n ) , @xmath0 ym theory .",
    "there is no such suppression , however , in @xmath1 sugra , so there _ must _ be regge cuts on the same footing as the regge poles of @xmath1 sugra .",
    "what is their interpretation in terms of the zero - slope limit of string theory , if any ? in section 3 we discuss reggeization of @xmath1 sugra in the context of ladder sums for graviton - graviton scattering .",
    "the possible structure of the moving regge cuts of the theory is contained in section 4 .",
    "we then make the _ speculation _ that the moving regge cuts of @xmath1 sugra are related to the infinite number of zero - mass states discussed by green et .",

    "the issue of the first daughter becomes important when we consider regge trajectories for graviton - graviton scattering in @xmath1 sugra .",

    "this procedure generates a sequence of singularities at positions@xcite @xmath73 which all pass through @xmath36 when @xmath2 .",
    "since @xmath74 in this example , the singularities ( [ 44 ] ) only extend a finite distance to the right for any fixed @xmath9 , in units of @xmath75 for @xmath1 sugra .",
    "the existence of regge poles in @xmath1 sugra thus suggests the existence of an infinite number of regge cuts in theory , each with singularities @xmath76 .",

    "it was shown that the graviton lies on a moving regge trajectory passing through @xmath12 , in agreement with the analyticity analysis of @xcite .",
    "however , the issue of the reggeization of the gluon is more delicate , as discussed in section 2 . accepting the bds conjecture@xcite for planar gluon - gluon scattering",
    ", we argued that the ladder sum gives the regge limit for the amplitude , but with the replacement of the coupling in the regge trajectory function by the cusp anomalous dimension .",
    "the implications of the reggeization of the graviton and other fundamental fields of @xmath1 sugra is that the perturbative states of string theory can plausibly emerge within the context of the sum of graphs of @xmath1 sugra . among these graphs",
    "are also infinite sums of non - planar graphs , which will lead to regge cuts .",
    "multiple exchange of regge poles or cuts can give an infinite number of moving regge cuts in scattering processes , both charged and uncharged , which accumulate near @xmath2 .",
    "we conjecture that these are related to the infinite number of massless or low - mass states discussed by green et .",
    "al.@xcite    if @xmath1 sugra is indeed perturbatively finite , the central issue pivots on possibilities ( 2b ) or ( 2c ) of the introduction .",
    "that is , can all the phenomena of the compactified string theory be plausibly exhibited ( at least qualitatively ) starting with @xmath1 sugra , and is such a theory non - perturbatively consistent ?",
    "these are important questions which deserve further consideration .",
    "we wish to thank jacques distler , mike duff , albion lawrence , steve naculich , warren siegel , kelly stelle , paul townsend , and edward witten for conversations and oren elrad for help in preparing the manuscript .",
