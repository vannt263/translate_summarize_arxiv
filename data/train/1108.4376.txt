    "symmetry of the physical process in our universe and particular mechanisms of its violation is golden mind of the modern physics . since pioneering lee and yang investigations of the parity symmetry in the weak interaction , the principle of symmetry is deeply incorporated into the modern particle physics , including the higgs mechanism of symmetry breaking , in chemistry , in physics of condensed matter and , in general , in the theory of the phase transition .",
    "passing from the microscopic physics to the properties of the space and time at large , we have to admit that the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) radiation anisotropy provides invaluable test for the investigation of parity at the megascopic scales above the scale of inhomogeneity @xmath3mpc .",
    "the problem of the parity asymmetry of the cmb has been investigated in @xcite , showing significant dominance of the power spectrum stored in the odd multipoles over the even ones .",
    "recently , in @xcite it was shown that the odd multipole preferences tidily connected with the anomalies of the two - point correlation function , in particular , the lack of correlations at @xmath4 @xcite , and newly discovered anomaly of the correlations at @xmath5 @xcite . in combination with the widely discussed anomalies of the cmb map and the power spectrum @xcite ( see for review @xcite ) , investigation of the origin of these anomalies could put a new light on the physics of the early universe , the methods of the foregrounds reductions and calibration of the cmb data sets , improving our knowledge of the most fundamental cosmological parameters and the theory of inflation .",
    "the local motion of an observer through the cmb frame produces the so - called kinematic dipole ( kd ) anisotropy of the cmb , which is the most powerful component of the signal and fitted out from the cmb data before cosmological analysis . in this paper",
    ", we are going to show that some of the discovered features of the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap ) cmb tt anisotropy , including the odd - parity preference of the power spectrum , could have common origin associated with the kd of the cmb .",
    "previously , the possible contamination of the cmb by kd has been assessed by multipole vector statistic ( alignment of the quadrupole and octupole components ) @xcite .",
    "additionally , we will show that the low multipole anomalies are associated with other anomalies such as the lack of angular correlation , the even / odd - parity asymmetry and the planarity of the multipole @xmath6 .",
    "first , we will focus on the properties of the cmb tt correlation function @xmath7 at angle @xmath8 and show that @xmath9 is connected to the parity parameter @xmath10 .",
    "we will estimate the power spectrum without the @xmath0 mode so that the rotational invariance of the angular power spectrum may not be automatically satisfied .",
    "as well known , these @xmath0 modes pick up a certain direction ( i.e. the @xmath11-axis direction in the spherical coordinate system where @xmath12 are defined @xcite ) . using these estimators",
    ", we will investigate the possible preferred direction in the cmb field .",
    "if our universe is , indeed , statistically homogeneous and isotropic with gaussian seed perturbations , we should have no or little parity preference , given for our estimators associated with the angular power spectrum . using the wmap 7-yr internal linear combination ( ilc7 ) map , we compute the parity parameters for coordinates of various orientations .",
    "we find some level of alignment between the kd direction and the orientation , in which the parity asymmetry is greatest .",
    "therefore , the cmb parity asymmetry may be related to the systematics associated with kd , which may be also responsible for the alignment problem of quadrupole and octupole @xcite .",
    "the outline of the paper is the following . in section 2",
    "we introduce the basic characteristics of the cmb parity asymmetry . in section 3",
    ", we investigate the orientations of maximum parity asymmetry and compare them with the cmb kinematic dipole . in section 4 , we summarize our investigation .",
    "the temperature fluctuations of cmb anisotropy , can be conveniently decomposed as follows : @xmath13 where @xmath12 are the coefficients of decomposition : @xmath14 , with @xmath15 as the phase . under the assumption of total gaussian randomness , as predicted by the large class of inflationary models , the amplitudes @xmath16 are distributed according to rayleigh s probability distribution function and the phases of @xmath12 are supposed to be evenly distributed in the range @xmath17 $ ] @xcite .    for any signals",
    "@xmath18 defined on the sphere , one can extract symmetric ( @xmath19 ) ) and antisymmetric ( @xmath20 ) components , where @xmath21 and @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 .",
    "naive expectation , where the concordant @xmath25cdm cosmological model with initial statistically isotropic and gaussian adiabatic perturbations is assumed , is the absence of any features distinct between even and odd multipoles .",
    "however , in reality this statement needs more accurate clarification .",
    "in particular , for the curvature perturbations beyond the present horizon the power spectrum is given by @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the spectral index of the primordial density perturbations @xcite .",
    "thus , the variance of the metric perturbations @xmath28 has very weak power - law ( @xmath29 ) or logarithmic divergence ( @xmath30 ) , if @xmath31 .",
    "since the low multipole range of the cmb temperature anisotropy is determined by the ordinary and integrated sachs - wolfe effects , these peculiarity of the power spectrum of metric perturbations are crucial for the two - point correlation function : @xmath32 where @xmath33 are the theoretical power spectrum , @xmath34 are the legendre polynomials , @xmath35 , and @xmath36 denotes the average over the statistical ensemble of realizations . using eq .",
    "( [ corf ] ) , we may easily show , for the largest angular distance : @xmath37 as clear in eq .",
    "( [ corf ] ) , the natural way to estimate the relative contribution of even and odd multipoles to the correlation function is to define the statistic @xmath38 where @xmath39 or @xmath40 ( see discussion in the forthcoming sections ) .",
    "note that this statistic differs from the @xmath10 , widely used in @xcite , in the sense that @xmath41 is replaced by @xmath42 .",
    "then , from eqs .",
    "( [ corpi ] ) and ( [ est ] ) we get the estimator of the quantity @xmath43 : @xmath44,\\nonumber\\\\ p^{\\pm}(l)= \\sum_{l'=l'_{\\min}}^{l}\\frac{2l'+1}{4\\pi}c(l')\\gamma^{\\pm}(l ' ) .",
    "\\label{est1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] thus , if @xmath45 , the corresponding correlation function is @xmath46 . in reality , the theoretical correlation function shows some parity asymmetry . for instance , the dipole component naturally contributes the odd parity , while the quadrupole contributes the even parity .",
    "when the background cosmological parameters correspond to the concordant @xmath25cdm model , the properties of theoretical correlation function @xmath43 depends on the value of @xmath47 , which is clearly shown in fig .",
    "we find that the odd parity is perferred when the odd @xmath48 is chosen , while the even parity is perferred when the even @xmath48 is chosen .",
    "however , the observed data show the different tendency for the parity asymmetry , i.e. the parity violation comparing with the theoretical predictions . from fig .",
    "[ com2 ] , we find that the odd parity is always perferred for all the cases with @xmath49 .    usually , the dipole component of @xmath43 is not included in eq .",
    "( [ corf ] ) , and the lower limit is set to @xmath50 . in fig .",
    "[ corfunc ] we carefully calculate the wmap7 observational correlation functions by considering the kq75 mask and a theoretical prediction with 1@xmath51 interval , where the cosmic variance effect is taken into account .",
    "consistent with fig .",
    "[ com2 ] , we expect the theoretical value of @xmath52 is positive , and the zero value is included at @xmath53 c.l .",
    "therefore the universe has tendency to be parity asymmetric @xmath54 by choosing @xmath55 , with very low chance of @xmath56 .",
    "however , the wmap7 data show that @xmath57 at @xmath58 c.l . , and our universe belongs to the very rare realizations of the @xmath25cdm cosmological models with given by the wmap7 cosmological parameters .",
    "if the parity violation has the cosmological origin , we should also see the similar parity violation in te , ee and bb components of the polarized signal .",
    "however , in the curret wmap data , the noises of the polarization data , including the te cross - correlation data are quite large .",
    "so we can not get any solid results on the parity asymmetry by using the wmap polarization data , when taking into account the large error bars .",
    "it is expected that the forthcoming planck data would provide the much better chance to study the parity asymmetry in the polarization data , and be helpful to reveal of the origin of the parity violation .",
    "as shown in the previous section , for the random gaussian statistically isotropic and homogeneous perturbations of the cmb , the correlation function @xmath59 is fully determined by the power spectrum @xmath60 , which is rotationally invariant .",
    "statistical invariance means that for any rotations of the reference system of coordinate , the power spectrum and the correlation function are invariant .",
    "the idea of the method , proposed in this section , is to replace the power spectrum @xmath60 in eq .",
    "( [ corf ] ) by a rotationally variant power spectrum @xmath61 , defined as @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the kroneker symbol .    as it is seen from the definition given by eq .",
    "( [ dpow ] ) , the relative difference between @xmath61 and @xmath60 is given by @xmath64 .",
    "so we have @xmath65 for random gaussian cmb field .",
    "thus , the major difference @xmath66 comes from @xmath67 and @xmath68 modes , while for @xmath69 their contributions are smaller than @xmath70 .",
    "now , we can study the power spectrum @xmath61 in any coordinate system . imagining the galactic coordinate system is rotated by the euler angle @xmath71 , and the coefficients @xmath72 in this new coordinate system",
    "can be calculated by @xmath73 where @xmath74 are the coefficients defined in the galactic coordinate system , and @xmath75 is the wigner rotation matrix @xcite .",
    "similar to eq .",
    "( [ dpow ] ) , we can define the power spectrum @xmath76 .",
    "it is easy to find that @xmath76 is independent of the angle @xmath77 , so in this paper we only consider two euler angle @xmath78 and set @xmath79 .",
    "if we consider @xmath80 as a vector , which labels the @xmath11-axis direction in the rotated coordinate system , then @xmath81 is the polar coordinate of this direction in the galactic system . in the galactic system , which relates to the galactic coordinate ( @xmath82 , @xmath83 ) by @xmath84 and @xmath85 . ]",
    "now , we can define the rotationally variable parity parameter @xmath86 by replacing @xmath60 in eq .",
    "( [ est ] ) with @xmath87 , and estimate the maxima and minima of @xmath86 for different euler angles @xmath80 . by the definition ,",
    "the parity parameter @xmath86 depends on the coefficients @xmath88 as follows : @xmath89 where @xmath90 , and @xmath91 so the cross - term @xmath92 is responsible for the angular dependency of the parity parameter @xmath93 .",
    "we can also calculate the difference between @xmath93 and @xmath10 by @xmath94 from the relation @xmath95 , we know that @xmath96 , and @xmath97 for @xmath98 .",
    "so , we conclude that @xmath93 mainly stands for the amplitude of the original parity parameter @xmath10 . at the same time , due to the rotational variance of @xmath93 , we can study the possible preferred direction , which may reveal hints on the origin of the observed parity asymmetry in cmb field .",
    "let us show that @xmath93 map depends on the angular @xmath99 .",
    "as we have mentioned , @xmath80 labels the @xmath11-axis direction in the rotated coordinate system , and @xmath81 is just the polar coordinate of this direction in galactic coordinate .",
    "we plotted the parameter @xmath93 as a function of @xmath99 for @xmath100 , and found that @xmath93 have the similar morphology for @xmath101 , which is clearly shown in fig .",
    "( note that , the morphology of @xmath68 map is different , which may relate to the unsolved low quadrupole problem as well as the alignment of quadrupole and octupole @xcite . ) in table [ table1 ] , we list the preferred directions @xmath80 , where the parity parameter @xmath86 for each @xmath82 is minimized ( note that different from the problem in @xcite , here as the widely discussed aligment problem of quadrupole and octupole in @xcite , the uncertainties of the preferred directions are difficult to be defined ) , which are very close with each other for @xmath102 .",
    "so , we can choose the special direction @xmath80 ( note that @xmath103 is another equivalent preferred direction ) , where all the parameters @xmath93 are minimized or maximized .",
    "we picked out these regions , and plotted them in the galactic coordinate system in fig .",
    "it is interesting to find that the preferred directions @xmath80 , where parity violation is largest , are coincident with the wmap7 kd direction @xcite , while the preferred directions @xmath80 , where parity asymmetry is smallest , are nearly perpendicular to the kd direction . if we assume the parity asymmetry in the cmb has the cosmological origin , it is very hard to explain these coincidences .",
    "so , the coincidence of the preferred direction @xmath80 with the wmap7 kd direction implies that the cmb parity asymmetry may relate to the possible contamination of residual wmap kd component .",
    "although we will not detailedly study the physical mechanism in this paper , we could provide some possible explanations for this coincidence problem .",
    "it is noticed that there is not a great deal of residual dipole in the wmap data , so a possible explanation could be connected to the use of the dipole as a photemetric calibrator in the wmap data set .",
    "another possible explanation is related to the contaminations generated by the collective emission of kuiper belt objects ( kbos ) and other minor bodies in the solar system where the kd direction is localized .",
    "since the emission of kbos is nearly independent of the frequency in the wmap frequency range , this contamination is very hard to be removed in the wmap data analysis . in @xcite",
    ", it was discussed that this foreground residual could leave significant parity asymmetry in the cmb data .",
    "besides , the explanation may also relate to the measure deviation of the wmap kinematic dipole , which could be caused by the measure error in dipole direction , antenna pointing direction , sidelobe pickup contamination , and so on . in @xcite",
    ", it was found that this kd deviation could generate the artificial cmb anisotropies in the low multipoles .",
    "if this is true , these artificial components may account for the cmb parity violation .    in order to cross - check this result , we consider another rotationally variant estimator , which is proposed by @xcite @xmath104 if our universe is statistically isotropic , the ensemble average of this estimator is related to the power spectrum as follows : @xmath105 as well discussed , this statistic has also chosen the preferred direction , i.e. the @xmath11-axis direction .",
    "in addition , this statistic favors high @xmath106s and so it works well in searches for planarity . in a quantum mechanical system",
    ", this quantity also corresponds to the angular momentum along the @xmath11-axis direction @xcite . due to the rotational variance of this quantity",
    ", we can define @xmath107 and the corresponding parity parameter @xmath108 , where @xmath80 is the euler rotation angle .",
    "we notice that in the definition of @xmath108 , due to the factor @xmath109 in @xmath110 , the weight of higher multipoles are much greater than the lower ones .",
    "so in this paper , we only consider the parity parameter @xmath108 for @xmath111 , where the parity violation is obvious .",
    "we plot the quantity @xmath108 as a function of @xmath80 for low multipoles in fig .",
    "[ gglq ] , and find that these maps have the quite similar morphology , especially for @xmath112 .",
    "the preferred directions @xmath80 ( similar , @xmath103 is another equivalent preferred direction ) , where the parity parameter @xmath108 for each @xmath82 is minimized , are also listed in table [ table2 ] . again",
    ", we find the similar results : for @xmath113 , the bluer regions ( larger parity violation ) are excellently coincident to the wmap7 kd direction , while the redder regions ( smaller parity asymmetry ) are nearly perpendicular to the kd direction .",
    "so this cross - check agrees with our previous finding : the cmb parity asymmetry in the low multipoles may connect with the possible contamination of wmap kd component .",
    "in this paper , we have investigated the directional properties of cmb parity asymmetry . in order to break the rotational invariance of the cmb power spectrum , we defined two different power spectrum estimators so that a special direction is picked out . by rotating these estimators with respect to the galactic coordinate system , we studied the corresponding parity parameters as functions of the preferred directions @xmath80 , where the parity parameters are minimized or maximized .",
    "we found that these preferred directions are aligned ( parallel or perpendicular ) with the wmap7 kinematic dipole direction , which implies that the cmb parity asymmetry may be produced by the systematics associated with kinematic dipole .",
    "this study also shows that the effect of the wmap kinematic dipole may extend to the higher multipoles @xmath2 .",
    "the planck surveyor possesses wide frequency coverage and systematics distinct from the wmap .",
    "in particular , it may take advantage of both cobe and wmap results for the dipole calibration and meanwhile planck satellite will have high signal - to - noise ratio in polarization data .",
    "therefore , we may apply the similar tests on the cmb te and ee data from the planck surveyor , and hope to resolve the association between the parity asymmetry and kinematic dipole .",
    "we appreciate useful discussions with p. coles .",
