    "low - mass galaxies are arguably the best places to test dark matter ( dm ) models since they are dynamically dominated by the dm haloes they are embedded in well within their inner regions . the kinematical information that is inferred from low surface brightness galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , nearby field dwarf galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and milky way ( mw ) dwarf spheroidals ( dsphs ) ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , seem to favour the presence of @xmath6 dark matter cores with different degrees of certainty .",
    "the former two cases are more strongly established while the latter is still controversial ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which is unfortunate since the mw dsphs have the largest dynamical mass - to - light ratios and are thus particularly relevant to test the dm nature .",
    "although not necessarily related to the existence of cores , it has also been pointed out that the population of dark satellites obtained in cdm @xmath7body simulations , are too centrally dense to be consistent with the kinematics of the mw dsphs @xcite .",
    "this problem possibly also extends to isolated galaxies @xcite .    the increasing evidence of lower than expected central dm densities among dm - dominated systems is a lasting challenge to the prevalent collisionless cold dark matter ( cdm ) paradigm . on the other hand ,",
    "the low stellar - to - dm content of dwarf galaxies represents a challenge for galaxy formation models since these have to explain the low efficiency of conversion of baryons into stars in dwarf galaxies .",
    "it is possible that these two outstanding issues share a common solution rooted in our incomplete knowledge of processes that are key to understand how low - mass galaxies form and evolve : gas cooling , star formation and energetic feedback from supernovae ( sne ) . in particular , episodic high - redshift gas outflows driven by sne have been proposed as a mechanism to suppress subsequent star formation and lower , irreversibly , the central dm densities ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "although such mechanism seemingly produces intermediate mass galaxies ( halo mass @xmath8 ) with realistic cores and stellar - to - halo mass ratios @xcite , it is questionable if it is energetically viable for lower mass galaxies @xcite .",
    "even though environmental effects such as tidal stripping might alleviate this stringent energetic condition in the case of satellite galaxies @xcite , the issue of low central dm densities seems relevant even for isolated galaxies @xcite .",
    "this seems to indicate that sne - driven outflows can only act as a solution to this problem if they occur very early , when the halo progenitors of present - day dwarfs were less massive @xcite .",
    "it remains unclear if such systems can avoid regenerating a density cusp once they merge with smaller , cuspier , haloes .",
    "it is also far from a consensus that the implementation of strong `` bursty '' star formation recipes in simulations , a key ingredient to reduce central dm densities , is either realistic or required to actually produce consistent stellar - to - halo mass ratios ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and other observed properties .",
    "it is therefore desirable , but challenging , to identify observables that could unambiguously determine whether bursty star formation histories with a strong energy injection efficiency ( into the dm particles ) are realistic or not .",
    "an exciting alternative solution to the problems of cdm at the scale of dwarfs is that of self - interacting dark matter ( sidm ) .",
    "originally introduced by @xcite , it goes beyond the cdm model by introducing significant self - collisions between dm particles .",
    "the currently allowed limit to the self - scattering cross section is imposed more stringently by observations of the shapes and mass distribution of elliptical galaxies and galaxy clusters @xcite , and is set at : @xmath9 .",
    "dm particles colliding with roughly this cross section naturally produce an isothermal core with a @xmath6 size in low - mass galaxies , close to what is apparently observed .",
    "sidm is well - motivated by particle physics models that introduce new force carriers in a hidden dm sector ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which predict velocity - dependent self - scattering cross sections .",
    "in the case of massless bosons for instance , the cross section scales as @xmath10 as in rutherford scattering .",
    "the renewed interest in sidm has triggered a new era of high resolution dm - only sidm simulations : velocity - dependent in @xcite ( vzl hereafter ) , and velocity - independent in @xcite , that hint at a solution to the cdm problems in low - mass galaxies .",
    "in particular for the mw dsphs , it has been established that the resultant dark satellites of a mw - size halo are consistent with the dynamics of the mw dsphs , have cores of @xmath6 and avoid cluster constraints only if @xmath11 , or if the cross section is velocity - dependent @xcite .",
    "recently , simulations of sidm models with new light mediators have shown that is possible to also suppress the abundance of dwarf galaxies due to the modified early - universe power spectrum caused by the interactions of the dm with the dark radiation @xcite .",
    "given the recent success of sidm , a natural step is to elevate its status to that of cdm by studying the synergy between baryonic physics and dm collisionality in a suitable galaxy formation model .",
    "so far , this has been studied only analytically @xcite , with a focus in more massive galaxies where baryons dominate the central potential .",
    "interestingly , in this case , the dm core size is reduced and the central densities are higher compared to sidm simulations without the effect of baryons . in this paper",
    "we concentrate on the regime of dwarf galaxies by pioneering cosmological hydrodynamical simulations that include the physics of galaxy formation within a sidm cosmology .",
    "we compare them with their counterparts ( under the same initial conditions ) in the cdm model with the main objective of understanding the impact of sidm on the formation and evolution of dwarf galaxies .",
    ".dm models considered in this paper .",
    "cdm is the standard collisionless model without any self - interaction .",
    "sidm10 is a reference model with a constant cross section an order of magnitude larger than allowed by current observational constraints .",
    "we note that such a model could still be realized in nature if this large cross section would only hold over a limited relative velocity range .",
    "sidm1 is also a model with constant cross section , which is potentially in the allowed range .",
    "vdsidma and vdsidmb have a velocity - dependent cross section motivated by the particle physics model presented in @xcite .",
    "these two models are allowed by all astrophysical constraints , and solve the `` too big to fail '' problem ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) as demonstrated in vzl .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     in this case the fit is poor in the inner regions ( @xmath12 ) , and thus , we use only the exponential gas profile instead of the two - component model as in the other cases .",
    "the lower right panel of figure  [ fig : halo_profiles ] demonstrates that the feedback associated with sne does not alter the dm density distribution in our model .",
    "this is not surprising since we do not employ a very bursty star formation model , but a rather smooth star formation prescription . as a consequence",
    ", the dm density profile is not affected at all by the formation of the baryonic galaxy and the related feedback processes for the cdm case .",
    "the sidm models lead to core formation due to self - interactions of dm particles .",
    "such core makes it easier for sne feedback to drive gas outwards , which should cause some effect on the dm distribution .",
    "in fact , the lower right panel of figure  [ fig : halo_profiles ] demonstrates that the dm density is slightly reduced in the cored region even with a smooth feedback model like ours .",
    "however , this effect is rather small and at maximum @xmath13 relative to the sidm10 simulation without baryons .",
    "this effect is therefore small compared to the effect of self - interactions , which reduce the central dm density much more significantly .",
    "so far we have discussed the relative differences between the different profiles . to quantify the spatial distribution of the dm and the baryons , gas and stars , in more detail",
    ", we now find analytical fits to the spherically averaged density distributions .",
    "we have found that the different dm models require different density profiles profiles to achieve a reasonable quality of the fits .",
    ", are stated for each fit .",
    "the fits were performed over the full radial range .",
    "all models lead to essentially perfect exponential profiles with no significant bulge components . the largest cross section models ( sidm1 , sidm10 ) produce a stellar core in the center.,scaledwidth=49.0% ]    we start with the dm profile for the cdm case .",
    "it is well - known that cdm haloes have spherically averaged density profiles that are well described by nfw @xcite or einasto profiles @xcite .",
    "we therefore fit the dm profile of the cdm model with the two - parameter nfw profile : @xmath14 on the other hand , the sidm haloes are well fitted by cored - like profiles that vary according to the amplitude of the self - scattering cross section at the typical velocities of the halo . in the case of the strongest cross section , sidm10 ,",
    "a good fit is obtained with the following three - parameter profile : @xmath15 while for intermediate cross sections , sidm1 and vdsidma , a burkert - like three - parameter formula provides a better fit : @xmath16 finally , for the weakest cross section , vdsidmb , a good fit is given by : @xmath17 next we consider the profiles of the baryonic components . for the stars and the gas",
    ", we use a two component density profile : an exponential profile in the outer region , which is a good approximation except for the gas beyond @xmath18 , and a cored profile in the inner region , analogous to eq .",
    "( [ sidm10_rho ] ) : @xmath19 where we find that @xmath20 provides a good fit in all cases except for the gas distribution in the sidm1 case .    for each profile ( dm , gas , and stars )",
    ", we find the best fit parameters by minimising the following estimate of the goodness of the fit : @xmath21 where the sum goes over all radial bins .",
    "we summarise the best fit parameters for each component in table  [ table : fits ] .",
    "we stress again that we need distinct parametric density profiles to better describe the spatial dm structure of the halo for the different dm models . for instance , in the case of sidm10 , the value of @xmath22 for the best fit using eq .",
    "( [ sidm10_rho ] ) is @xmath23 , whereas using eqs .",
    "( [ burkert]-[burkert_2 ] ) is @xmath24 and @xmath25 , respectively . on the other hand , for sidm1 , the values of @xmath22 using eqs .",
    "( [ sidm10_rho]-[burkert_2 ] ) , are , respectively : 0.020 , 0.003 , 0.021 .",
    "clearly , in this case , eq .  ( [ burkert ] ) is the best fit .        for the stars we can also inspect the stellar surface density profiles , which are closely related to the measured stellar surface brightness profiles .",
    "the stellar surface density profiles of the da dwarfs for the different dm models are shown in figure  [ fig : stellar_profiles ] .",
    "the exponential scale length , @xmath26 , of the different models is quoted for each model , and the dashed lines show the actual exponential fits for each model . for the cdm case , we find over a large radial range an exponential profile and no significant bulge contribution , similar to what is observed for most dwarfs .",
    "we have checked that the surface density profiles do not vary much if the orientation of the galaxy changes .",
    "the reason for this is that the dwarfs do not form thin disks , but rather extended puffed up ellipsoidal distributions similar to , for example , the stellar population of the isolated dwarf wlm .",
    "the scale length values we find are in reasonable agreement with other recent simulation of dwarf galaxies at this mass scale ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "in the case of sidm1 and sidm10 , the presence of a small stellar core is visible in figure  [ fig : stellar_profiles ] .",
    "the scale length does not change significantly as a function of the underlying dm model .",
    "however , it can clearly be seen that dm self - interactions lead to slightly larger exponential scale radii .",
    "we note that , contrary to previous studies , we achieve exponential stellar surface density profiles without a bursty star formation model or a high density thresholds for star formation .",
    "we therefore find that our quiescent , smooth star formation model leads to non - exponential star formation histories , and to exponential stellar surface density profiles .",
    "it has been argued that these characteristics are intimately connected to `` bursty '' star formation rates  ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "as a corollary , it was argued that the formation of a dm core is then naturally expected .",
    "however , we find that this is is not necessarily the case .",
    "we should note that @xcite simulated an isolated dwarf of a similar halo mass and stellar mass as our dwarf da but with a considerably bursty star formation model that produced a @xmath27 core .",
    "this is in clear contrast to our simulation where baryonic effects are unable to create a dm core despite of the high global efficiency of star formation .",
    "the key is then , once more , in the time scales and efficiency of energy injection during sne - driven outflows .",
    "it remains to be seen if star formation histories in real dwarf galaxies occur in bursts with a timescale much shorter than the local dm dynamical timescale , and with an effective energy injection into the dm particles that is sufficient to significantly alter the dm distribution .",
    "as we have shown above , halo da is in relative isolation and has a quiet merger history .",
    "we therefore expect that the final stellar and dm configuration is nearly in equilibrium . in the case of sidm , once the isothermal core forms , further collisions are not relevant anymore in changing the dm phase - space distribution .",
    "we can then ignore the collisional term in the boltzmann equation and test the equilibrium hypothesis by solving the jeans equation for the radial velocity dispersion profile using as input the density and anisotropy profiles : @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the total enclosed mass .",
    "we solve eq .",
    "( [ jeans_eq ] ) independently for the collisionless components , dm and stars , using the fits to the density profiles with the analytic formulae introduced above .",
    "in addition , we also fit the corresponding radial anisotropy profiles for both the dm and the stars with the following five - parameter formula : @xmath30 the best fit parameters for this relation for each dm model are listed in table  [ table : fits ] .",
    "the result obtained by solving the jeans equation for the cdm and sidm10 cases is seen in figure [ fig : sigma_jeans ] . here",
    "we show the predicted dispersion profiles with dashed lines for dm ( thick lines ) and stars ( thin lines ) .",
    "the solid lines show the actual simulation results .",
    "although the agreement between the velocity dispersion predicted by the jeans analysis and the simulation is not perfect , the comparison still indicates that halo da is roughly in equilibrium and that the spherical approximations assumed above are partially correct . in the sidm10 case , this would suggest that the dark matter core formed in the past and that any subsequent scattering does not affect the final equilibrium configuration once the galaxy forms .",
    "this would justify the use of the jeans equation without considering a collisional term .",
    "we will consider a more detailed dynamical analysis in a subsequent paper analysing the different sidm cases , having a closer look at the velocity anisotropies , and also investigating departures from spherical symmetry ( zavala & vogelsberger , in prep ) .     for dm ( top ) and stellar mass ( bottom ) for halo da .",
    "the enclosed dm mass is for all times and for all models significantly larger than the stellar mass , and therefore dynamically dominates the center of the dwarf .",
    "the central dm mass is substantially reduced for the sidm1 and sidm10 models , but only slightly for the vdsidm models .",
    "similarly , the stellar mass is only reduced for the models with constant cross section , whereas the stellar mass growth of vdsidm closely follows that of the cdm case.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=49.0% ]   for dm ( top ) and stellar mass ( bottom ) for halo da .",

    "similarly , the stellar mass is only reduced for the models with constant cross section , whereas the stellar mass growth of vdsidm closely follows that of the cdm case.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=49.0% ]",
    "in this section we study in more detail the matter content and structure of the simulated dwarf da within the central region , @xmath31 , which roughly encloses the dm core size for all models .",
    "we start with figure  [ fig : histories1000 ] , which shows the mass buildup of dm ( top ) and stars ( bottom ) within @xmath4 as a function of time . in the cases with a constant scattering cross section ,",
    "it is clear that there is a significant amount of dark matter mass expelled from the central kiloparsec . in the case of sidm1 for example ,",
    "about @xmath32 have been removed by @xmath2 . for the vdsidm models",
    "however , there is only a minimal deviation from the evolution of the base cdm model .",
    "in fact , the vdsidmb model mass evolution follows the cdm result very closely and shows a nearly constant central mass after early times @xmath33 .",
    "the vdsidma model leads to a small depletion of dm in the central @xmath4 of about @xmath34 .",
    "the largest depletion can be seen for the sidm10 model , where the central mass is reduced by nearly a factor @xmath35 .    the central stellar mass on the other hand grows steadily with time but it is at all times , and for all dm models , sub - dominant compared to the inner dm mass . for all models the central stellar mass is below @xmath36 at @xmath2 , which is a factor @xmath37 lower than the central dm mass at that time .",
    "the stellar mass in sidm1 and sidm10 grows more slowly than in the cdm and vdsidm cases .",
    "the vdsidm models behave very similar to the cdm case , where the stellar mass grows nearly linearly with time reaching a mass of about @xmath38 .",
    "the stellar mass within @xmath4 grows initially similar sidm10 ( sidm1 ) , however , after @xmath39 ( @xmath40 ) the stellar mass growth is slowed down for sidm10 ( sidm1 ) .",
    "after that time the growth is still linear but with a significantly shallower slope compared to the cdm and vdsidm cases .",
    "we note that sidm1 is an allowed model , and it is striking how different its stellar mass is growing compared to the other allowed vdsidm models .    to quantify this in more detail we present a closer look of the density profiles of dm ( solid lines ) and stars ( dashed lines ) in figure  [ fig : rho_inner ] .",
    "this reveals a tight correlation between the shape of the dm and stellar density distributions .",
    "the stars within the core react to the change in the potential of the dominant dm component due to self - interactions .",
    "the size of the stellar core is therefore tied , to certain degree , to the core sizes of the dm distribution . in the cases where the scattering cross section has a velocity dependence , although the creation of a dm core is evident , the impact is minimal in the stellar distribution compared to the models with a constant cross section .",
    "this is mainly because even in the cdm case , the stellar distribution forms a core which is roughly the size of the dm core observed in the vdsidm cases .",
    "we conclude that self - interactions drive the sizes of the cores in dm and stars to track each other . for sidm1 ,",
    "the density within the core is a factor of @xmath41 smaller than in cdm .",
    "the central distribution of stars can therefore probe the nature of dm and can potentially be used to distinguish different sidm models .    the strong correlation between dm and stars that we are finding is similar to the one suggested recently by @xcite using analytical arguments , but the regimes and interpretations are quite different .",
    "whereas these authors investigated the response of sidm to a dominant stellar component , we are investigating a system where dm still dominates dynamically .",
    "thus in the former , the dm cores sizes are reduced relative to expectations from dm - only simulations due to the formation of the galaxy , while in the latter , the stellar distribution of the galaxy responds to the formation of the sidm core by increasing its own stellar core relative to the cdm case .",
    "this regime is therefore more promising to derive constraints for the nature of dm .     for the different dm models .",
    "the stars trace the evolution of dm and also form a core .",
    "the size of the stellar core is closely related to the size of the dm core .",
    "this can be seen most prominently for the sidm1 and sidm10 models.,scaledwidth=49.0% ]    next we are interested in the time evolution of the core radii .",
    "it was already obvious from figure  [ fig : histories1000 ] that for the largest cross section cases , the core should already be present early on during the formation history of the galaxy .",
    "this is indeed the case as we demonstrate more clearly in figure  [ fig : coresize ] , where the evolution of the core sizes are shown as a function of time . as a measure of core radius ,",
    "we fit burkert profiles  @xcite at each time , for each of the models , to extract the core size @xmath42 : @xmath43 we note that we use this two - parameter fit for simplicity to fit all sidm models and give a measure of the core size .",
    "as we explored in detail above , the different sidm models are actually better fitted by different radial profiles . however",
    ", our purpose here is not to rigorously define a core size but simply to present an evolutionary trend for the different models .",
    "this trend is clearly visible in the figure as well as the dependence of the amplitude of the core size on the scattering cross section .",
    "figure  [ fig : coresize ] shows the core radii determined by these two - parametric burkert fits for all dm models with ( solid lines ) and without ( dashed lines ) the effects baryons .",
    ", in the dm - only simulations ( dashed ) with the simulations including baryons ( solid ) .",
    "baryons have only a tiny effect on the evolution and size of the cores .",
    "the largest effect can be seen for sidm10 , where the shallow dm profile allows sne feedback to expand the core a bit more compared to the dm - only case.,scaledwidth=49.0% ]    figure  [ fig : coresize ] also demonstrates that the actual impact of baryons on the dm distribution relative to the dm - only case is minor , as we discussed already above ( see lower right panel of figure  [ fig : halo_profiles ] ) . in the case of cdm this is not surprising since : ( i ) our star formation model is less bursty compared to models where the cusp - core transformation is efficient and ( ii ) for the mass scale we are considering , halo mass @xmath3 for halo da , the energy released by sne is not expected to be sufficient to create sizeable dm cores @xcite , although see @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : coresize ] demonstrates that our star formation and feedback model creates only a slightly larger core for the sidm10 model .",
    "this is because expelling gas in this case is easier due to the reduced potential well caused by dm collisions .",
    "we stress again that these results are sensitive to the model used for sne - driven energy injection into the dm particles ( both efficiency and time scales ) .",
    "larger efficiencies of energy injection into shorter timescales would result in a larger removal of dm mass from the inner halo .",
    "according to figure  [ fig : coresize ] a sizeable core is already present very early on .",
    "by @xmath44 all the models already have cores more than half of their present day size .",
    "furthermore , figure  [ fig : coresize ] also demonstrates , that none of our sidm models lead to the gravothermal catastrophe where the core collapses following the outward flux of energy caused by collisions .",
    "this is consistent with the findings in vzl , where only one subhalo , with similar total dark matter mass as halo da , of the analogous sidm10 mw - size simulation was found to enter that regime towards @xmath2 .    .",
    "the vdsidm models have a weaker impact.,scaledwidth=49.0% ]    as a consequence of the dm core settling early on in the formation history of the galaxy , the star formation rate within the central @xmath4 is reduced significantly at late times in the cases with constant cross section .",
    "this results in a stellar population that is in average older than in the case of cdm .",
    "this is clearly shown in figure  [ fig : metals ] , where we plot the time evolution of the ratio of the metallicity averaged within the central @xmath4 , relative to the cdm case .",
    "the difference today is @xmath45 .",
    "interestingly , in the vdsidm cases , there is an excess in star formation within @xmath4 in the last stages of the evolution resulting in a younger stellar population since the last @xmath46 ( see also figure  [ fig : coresize ] ) .",
    "we will investigate this issue , and in general the properties of the central @xmath47 region , in a follow - up paper using simulations with increased resolution ( zavala & vogelsberger , in prep ) .     as a function of total stellar mass .",

    "we compare both to observational estimates using samples of dwarf galaxies compiled in  @xcite ( top ) and from the things survey ( bottom , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . at these small radii ,",
    "the change in the enclosed mass is still more dramatic for the constant cross section sidm models having a deficit in mass by a factor @xmath49 relative to the cdm case , while the vdsidm cases , although close to cdm , still deviate visibly .",
    "the logarithmic slope of the density profile at this radius varies between @xmath50 ( sidm10 ) and @xmath51 ( cdm ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : encmass500 ] shows that given the large dispersion in the data , all dm models are essentially consistent with observations .",
    "there is however some tension with the cdm simulation of halo da having a slightly too large total mass , and a slightly too steep dm density slope at @xmath52 . on the other hand",
    ", the sidm10 case might be to cored for the stellar mass of halo db ( @xmath53 ) .",
    "taking both haloes into account , and looking at the two relations of figure  [ fig : encmass500 ] only , it seems that sidm1 agrees best with these observations .",
    "we stress however , that our dwarf sample is far to small to draw any conclusions based on this result and these observations are in any case , too uncertain to use them as constraints .",
    "self - interacting dark matter ( sidm ) is one the most viable alternatives to the prevailing cold dark matter ( cdm ) paradigm .",
    "current limits on the elastic scattering cross section between dm particles are set at @xmath54  @xcite . at this level ,",
    "the dm phase space distribution is altered significantly relative to cdm in the centre of dm haloes .",
    "the impact of dm self - interactions on the baryonic component of galaxies that form and evolve in sidm haloes has not been explored so far .",
    "recently , @xcite analytically estimated the dm equilibrium configuration that results from a stellar distribution added to the centre of a halo in the case of sidm .",
    "these authors studied the regime where the stellar component dominates the gravitational potential and concluded that the dm core sizes ( densities ) are smaller ( higher ) than observed in dm - only sidm simulations .",
    "this might have important consequences on current constraints of sidm models since they have been derived precisely in the baryon - dominated regime . in this paper",
    "we explore the opposite regime , that of dwarf galaxies where dm dominates the gravitational potential even in the innermost regions .",
    "our analysis is based on the first hydrodynamical simulations performed in a sidm cosmology .",
    "we focus most of the analysis on a single dwarf with a halo mass @xmath55 .",
    "we study two cases with a constant cross section : sidm1 and sidm10 , @xmath56 , respectively , and two cases with a velocity - dependent cross section : vdsidma - b , that were also studied in detail in vzl and @xcite . except for sidm10 ,",
    "all these models are consistent with astrophysical constraints , solve the `` too big to fail '' problem and create @xmath57(1  kpc ) cores in dwarf - scale haloes .",
    "our simulations include baryonic physics using the implementation described in @xcite employing the moving mesh code arepo @xcite .",
    "we use the same model that was set up to reproduce the properties of galaxies at slightly larger mass - scales .",
    "our intention in this first analysis is not to match the properties of dwarf galaxies precisely , but rather to compare sidm and cdm with a single prescription for the baryonic physics , which has been thoroughly tested on larger scales .",
    "our most important findings are :    * impact of sidm on global baryonic properties of dwarf galaxies : * the stellar and gas content of our simulated dwarfs agree reasonably well with various observations including the stellar mass as a function of halo mass , the luminosity metallicity relation , the neutral hydrogen content , and the cumulative star formation histories .",
    "the latter are similar to those of local isolated group dwarf galaxies with similar stellar masses .",
    "we find that the stellar mass , the gas content , the stellar metallicities and star formation rates are only minimally affected by dm collisions in allowed sidm models .",
    "the allowed elastic cross sections are too small to have a significant global impact on these quantities , and the relative differences between the different dm models are typically less than @xmath58 . in most cases",
    "these changes are not systematic as a function of the employed dm model .",
    "the modifications in the global baryonic component of the galaxies can therefore not be used to constrain sidm models since the effects are too small and not systematic .",
    "* impact of sidm on the inner halo region : * within @xmath31 , we find substantial differences driven by the collisional nature of sidm . besides the well - known effect of sidm on the dm density profiles",
    ", we also find that at these scales the distribution of baryons is significantly affected by dm self - interactions . both stars and gas show relative differences up to @xmath59 in the density , the velocity dispersion , and the gas temperature .",
    "most of the effects increase with the size of the cross section in the central region . the strongest correlation with the cross section can be found for the stellar profiles , where the central stellar density profile clearly correlates with the central cross section leading to lower central densities for dm models with larger central cross sections .",
    "* impact of baryons on the inner halo region : * we find that the impact of baryons on the dm density profile is small for the dm - dominated dwarf ( @xmath60 ) studied here .",
    "however , this result is also connected to our smooth star formation model , which is not as bursty as models where a significant core formation is observed due to baryonic feedback .",
    "the size of the dm core and the central density are therefore essentially the same as in our simulations that have no baryons , although the core size is slightly larger in the former than in the latter .    * disentangling different sidm models : * for the cases where the scattering cross section is constant , the combination of two key processes : ( i ) an early dm core formation such that by @xmath44 , the dm cores already have half of their size today ; and ( ii ) a star formation history dominated by the period after the formation of the dm core , result in the following characteristics of the stellar distribution of sidm galaxies : ( a ) the development of a central stellar core with a size that correlates with the amplitude of the scattering cross section .",
    "for instance , for the sidm1 case with @xmath61 , the density within the stellar core is a factor of @xmath41 smaller than for the cdm case .",
    "( b ) a reduced stellar mass in the sub - kpc region ( @xmath62 ) as a byproduct of the reduced dm gravitational potential due to self - scattering .",
    "( c ) a reduced central stellar metallicity ; by @xmath45 at @xmath2 compared to the cdm case . around @xmath63",
    "the metallicity can be reduced by up to @xmath64 .    for the cases where the scattering cross section is velocity - dependent ,",
    "even though a sizeable dm core can still be created ( @xmath65 ) , the effect in the stellar distribution at all scales is minimal relative to cdm .",
    "this is likely because the amplitude of the cross section within the inner region of the dwarf is not large enough to produce a dm core that is larger than the stellar core that forms in the cdm case . whether the latter could be the result of numerical resolution is something we will investigate in a forthcoming paper .",
    "any changes that we found in the vdsidm cases seem to be only related to the stochastic nature of the simulated star formation and galactic wind processes .",
    "these conclusions are key predictions of sidm that can in principle be tested to either constrain currently allowed models , particularly constant cross section models , or to find signatures of dm collisions in the properties of the central stellar distributions of dwarf galaxies . in future works",
    "we will explore these possibilities in more detail .",
