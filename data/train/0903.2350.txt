    "the reliable characterization and scientific exploitation of the polarized cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) anisotropy signal is one of the main challenges facing the cmb research at the present .",
    "the challenge is aimed at by an entire slew of the experimental efforts which are currently on - going  @xcite , being deployed  @xcite or planned  @xcite . the majority , if not all , of these experiments will effectively observe only part of the sky .",
    "this is either due to observational / hardware limitations , particularly for ground - based and balloon - borne experiments , or the presence of foregrounds , or both .",
    "the resulting so - called cut - sky effects will therefore have to be taken into account in the data analysis of most of these experiments .",
    "the focus of this paper is on the cmb power spectrum estimation via the pseudo - spectrum technique  @xcite .",
    "the power spectrum is the most fundamental statistics considered in the context of the cmb fluctuations , which are thought of as being gaussian or nearly gaussian distributed .",
    "the pseudo spectrum approach provides a computationally quick and flexible framework for estimating the power spectra , which has been extensively and successfully employed in past analyses of the cmb data sets ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "however , it has been long recognized  @xcite that a straightforward application of the pseudo spectrum technique to cut - sky polarized cmb maps leads to the so - called `` @xmath4-to-@xmath2 '' leakage , or power aliasing , as a consequence of which the cosmologically important information contained in the cmb @xmath2-modes is overwhelmed by the statistical uncertainty of the ( much larger ) @xmath4-modes . to date two techniques alleviating the problem",
    "have been proposed : one correcting the leakage on the correlation function level  @xcite and the other attempting to do so directly on the maps  @xcite .",
    "the latter approach relies on a suitably chosen sky apodization to remove from the map harmonic modes which are neither solely @xmath4 nor @xmath2 .",
    "in a recent paper  @xcite it has been suggested that the apodization can be appropriately optimized to bring down the resulting @xmath2-mode spectrum uncertainty in - line with the optimal methods , building up a strong case in favor of this approach . in this paper",
    "we extend the original formalism of  @xcite to incorporate it within the framework of the cross - spectra computations and discuss a number of implementation issues , related to derivative computation and apodization choices in actual applications .",
    "later , in this context we discuss the performance of the approach .",
    "we note here that other approaches to the polarized power spectrum , which do not suffer from the leakage problem , exist but are however hampered either by numerical efficiency  @xcite or convergence  @xcite issues in particular for the high resolution observations ( but see  @xcite for a potential resolution of this problem ) .",
    "consequently , the pure pseudo - spectrum approach stands out as an important alternative potentially capable of addressing successfully the needs of the future cmb b - mode polarization experiments .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows . in sect .",
    "[ sect : formalism ] we start from presenting the standard pseudo - power - spectrum technique and the @xmath0-leakage problem .",
    "we also summarize the original approach of smith ( 2006 )  @xcite and describe its specific variant as proposed in this paper and which invokes harmonic domain derivatives and the cross - spectrum idea .",
    "we conclude that section with an overview of the numerical implementation of the method . in sect .",
    "[ sect : apodizations ] we elaborate on the issues related to the proper sky apodizations . in sect .",
    "[ sect : applications ] we consider the performance of the formalism focusing on the role of the apodization and its impact on the quality of the final results , as expressed by the level of the remaining residual @xmath0 leakage and the uncertainty of the estimated power spectra . we summarize the main results of this work in sect .",
    "[ sect : concl ] .    for definiteness ,",
    "hereafter , we will reserve the term mask to a binary , pixelized map of a sky assuming only two values 1 and 0 , corresponding to an observed or unobserved ( or just not to be taken into the analysis ) sky pixel respectively .",
    "the pixel weights which can assume any nonzero value will be referred to as either apodizations or windows . in this language",
    "a mask just defines an observed sky",
    ". we will also refer to aliasing involving different spin harmonics as leakage , reserving the term aliasing solely to mixing between different modes of the same type of the same basis functions .",
    "though not strictly precise such differentiations will be useful in the following discussion .",
    "the cmb ( linear ) polarization field is completely described by two stokes parameters , @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "those can be combined into two spin-2 and spin-(-2 ) fields defined as , @xmath7 for the full sky , the spin fields can be expressed in the harmonic space making use of the spin - weighted spherical harmonic basis @xmath8 alternatively , the polarization field can be decomposed into a gradient , @xmath4 , and a curl , @xmath2 , part , both of which are coordinate independent . in the harmonic space ,",
    "these two approaches are related via the following relations , @xmath9 from a point of view of physics , the @xmath0 decomposition of cmb polarization may seem more natural as it is directly linked to the primordial cosmological perturbations leading to the presently observed cmb anisotropies .",
    "in particular , only primordial gravity waves , and not density perturbations , can create @xmath2-type polarization  @xcite . as a consequence constraining the amplitude of such modes could allow us to study the character of the primordial cosmological perturbations .",
    "this simple picture is spoilt somewhat by a presence of an additional @xmath2-mode type contribution generated by the gravitational lensing of the @xmath4-mode polarization  @xcite and which needs to be accounted for if the primordial component is to be recovered .",
    "a computation of polarized angular power spectra makes use of spin - weighted spherical harmonics .",
    "those functions , a natural harmonic basis for spin-@xmath10 fields on the sphere , are derived from the standard ( or spin-0 ) spherical harmonics by applying the spin - raising ( @xmath11 ) or spin - lowering ( @xmath12 ) operators  @xcite , @xmath13 where hereafter @xmath14 . in the following",
    ", we will always assume that @xmath10 is nonnegative .",
    "the main properties of the spin - weighted spherical harmonics under different transformation can be found elsewhere , e.g. ,  @xcite .    any complex , spin-@xmath10 field , with @xmath15 is completely characterized by its projection on the spin-@xmath10 spherical harmonics , defining its harmonic representation , @xmath16 just as is the case for spin-2 polarization fields a spin-@xmath10 field can be also fully described by its @xmath0 harmonic decomposition . adopting a vectorial notation , @xmath17 \\\\ \\mathrm{im}\\left[{}_{s}\\phi\\right ] \\end{array } \\right),\\ ] ] we can define the @xmath4 and @xmath2 spherical harmonic basis as , @xmath18 and @xmath19 here we have defined two differential operators @xmath20 which generalize to arbitrary spin the operators used in @xcite .",
    "the harmonic representation of the field @xmath21 in the @xmath0 subspace then reads , @xmath22 where @xmath23 or @xmath2 and we have introduced an arbitrary ( scalar ) weight , @xmath24 , which we will later need to account either for the noise present in the data , @xmath21 , or the cut - sky effects .",
    "the dot denotes a standard componentwise dot product . in the special case of cmb polarization ,",
    "the vector @xmath21 is simply the polarization vector defined as , @xmath25 it can be easily verified that introducing the polarization vector , @xmath26 into eq .",
    "and setting @xmath27 and @xmath28 over the full sphere , leads to the standard definition of the @xmath4 and @xmath2 multipoles .",
    "the pseudo-@xmath29 estimator , _ e.g. _",
    "@xcite , in a given bandpower @xmath30 with a width @xmath31 , is then based on the multipole decomposition eq .   and defined as , @xmath32 where @xmath33 stands for @xmath4 or @xmath2 and @xmath34 and @xmath35 distinguish two sets of measurements ( maps ) of the sky for which the harmonic coefficients have been computed . throughout this paper",
    ", we use @xmath36 as @xmath37-weighting while computing the bandpowers .",
    "though , this may not be the most natural choice from the @xmath2 mode power spectrum perspective , the results presented hereafter are expected to be largely independent on it , given the relatively narrow @xmath37bins used in this work and the fact that the @xmath2-mode power spectrum is nearly structure free . for definiteness",
    "we will be assuming hereafter that the two different sets of data always refer to the same sky area , though we will allow for different ( nonzero ) weights assigned to each of them .",
    "the pseudo - spectrum formalism can be used to estimate @xmath38 and @xmath39 as well as @xmath40 spectra .",
    "hereafter , we will use a calligraphic typeface , @xmath41 , for the estimated and a roman one , @xmath42 , for the true underlying cmb power spectrum .    because of the limited sky coverage , and nonuniform , pixel - dependent weights , the above estimator is biased and its average over cmb realizations , @xmath43 , involves a mixing between different @xmath37 modes ( or bins ) and polarization states .",
    "the latter can be described by a so - called _ mixing kernel _ which we will denote as @xmath44 .",
    "the unbiased estimator @xmath45 is thus obtained by inverting the following linear system , @xmath46 here @xmath47 is the noise contribution to the estimated pseudo - spectra and vanishes , whenever the noise in the two data sets is not correlated , as for example , in a case of two data sets produced by two different experiments or two uncorelated detectors of a single experiment .",
    "in fact , we will always assume that @xmath48 , whenever @xmath49 , and refer to the latter cases as pseudo cross - spectra .",
    "we will call a pseudo - spectrum computed from a single data set , i.e. , @xmath50 , a pseudo autospectrum .",
    "we note that in this case the noise term is usually nonvanishing and has to be estimated from the data and/or our knowledge of the experiment to allow the estimator in eq .   to be correctly unbiased .",
    "this emphasizes one of the biggest advantages of the cross - spectrum based estimators , which do not need such a correction .",
    "however , the mixing kernel , @xmath44 will depend on the window functions applied to each of the data sets and therefore be somewhat more cumbersome to calculate in the cross - spectrum case .",
    "moreover , as we will discuss that later on , some of the most appealing choices for the window function will often require the knowledge of the noise in the data .",
    "nevertheless , as the latter will be used only for the power spectrum error estimation and not for the computations of the spectral estimates , lower precision in modeling the noise may be sufficient . in the very least , in a case of real data",
    "the cross - spectra provide a useful and handy diagnostic in the analysis of any data set  @xcite , while for a discussion as the one presented here the cross - spectra allow to simplify the analysis by avoiding any explicit treatment of the noise bias , while retaining all the other aspects essentially unchanged .",
    "the mixing matrix can be computed as ,    @xmath51    where @xmath52 denotes a position of an @xmath34-th pixel .",
    "the above expression is fully general , as @xmath53 can be any function used to project the stokes parameters maps into the harmonic @xmath4 and @xmath2 subspaces . in particular , for the standard spectra the windowing of the data with a window @xmath24 can be taken into account by setting , @xmath54 the specific expressions for @xmath44 relevant for the case of standard pseudo spectra can be found elsewhere @xcite .",
    "the @xmath55 matrix is a convolution kernel relating the pixel - domain correlation functions of the @xmath5 and @xmath6 stokes parameters to the @xmath4 and @xmath2 angular power spectrum ( the explicit link between two - point correlation functions and power spectra for polarization fields can be found in the appendix of  @xcite ) .",
    "we point out that in some applications considered in the following the window , @xmath24 , and therefore also the functions @xmath53 will all depend on the bin number , @xmath30 , ( see eq .  ) .",
    "in general , the kernel , @xmath56 , will mix different @xmath37-modes as well as @xmath4 and @xmath2 polarization types .",
    "the consequences of this fact and the conditions , which ensure the diagonality of the kernel in the polarization states are discussed in the following sections .",
    "the operators defined in sect .",
    "[ subsec : harmdec ] , valid for any spin-@xmath10 complex field , define two orthogonal subspaces as , @xmath57 however , the @xmath0 subspaces defined by @xmath58 are orthogonal ( in the sense of eq .  )",
    "only on the full sky .",
    "this means that if the polarization field is known on a limited part of the celestial sphere , the reconstruction of @xmath4 and @xmath2 modes by projecting the measured polarization on the @xmath59 basis is `` nonpure '' , i.e. , the estimated @xmath4 or @xmath2 multipoles receive a contribution from both @xmath4 and @xmath2 modes .",
    "this applies in particular to the pseudo - power spectra , @xmath60 and @xmath61 , as defined in eq .",
    ", each of which will include a contribution from the other mode .",
    "though such a mixing can be removed on average , the leaked modes will still contribute to the variance of the estimated power spectra .",
    "therefore , if the power contained in one of the polarization states is much higher than in the other , as is the case of , for example , the cmb anisotropies , the error bars estimated for the mode with lower power will be drastically exaggerated due to sample variance of the leaked contribution .",
    "the same conclusion can be arrived at by starting from eq .   which can be viewed as a harmonic decomposition of the @xmath62 field .",
    "multiplication by the window function , @xmath24 , is a convolution not only in the harmonic space but also in the @xmath0 subspace , turning thus @xmath63 into a mixture of the true @xmath2 and @xmath4 cmb multipoles .",
    "this last observation highlights the fact that the standard pseudo-@xmath29 technique may be in practice unable to provide good estimates of the @xmath2-mode angular power spectra in particular from data sets coming from small - scale cmb experiments .",
    "moreover , even for satellite experiments for which angular power spectra can be estimated from a significant fraction of the sky , the discussed effects may be significant enough not to be negligible .",
    "we can look at the @xmath0 leakage problem also from the mixing matrix perspective .",
    "the lack of orthogonality of @xmath4 and @xmath2 type of spherical harmonics results in the coupling between the @xmath4 and @xmath2 pseudo power spectra .",
    "for this reason the inversion in eq .",
    "needs to be performed simultaneously for both @xmath4 and @xmath2 spectra to allow for unscrambling the modes with the help of nonvanishing off - diagonal @xmath40 and @xmath64 blocks of the mixing matrix .",
    "the resulting expression for the power spectrum estimate , derived in the case of the @xmath2-mode spectrum reads now , @xmath65 .",
    "\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in the ensemble average sense the above expression is unbiased as a result of a subtle cancellation of the @xmath4 mode power present in the pseudo- @xmath2 and @xmath4 spectra .",
    "such a cancellation does not however apply to the variance of the estimator and as a result the variance of the spectra of one type will include a contribution from the other .    in the following we will quantify the @xmath0 leakage using both these perspectives , i.e. , either looking at an excess variance of the estimated @xmath2-mode power spectrum or at the magnitude of nonvanishing , off - diagonal blocks of the mixing matrix .",
    "pseudo-@xmath29 estimators of the polarization power spectra which do not mix @xmath4 and @xmath2 modes can be constructed in projecting the polarization fields on the `` pure '' @xmath4 and @xmath2 subspaces  @xcite .",
    "pure @xmath4 and @xmath2 multipoles on a partial sky are defined as follows ( the vector @xmath26 now represents the polarization signal as measured on the sky ) @xcite : @xmath66^\\dag\\cdot\\mathbf{p}(x ) , \\label{aetilde } \\\\ { } _ b\\tilde{a}^b_{\\ell{m}}&=&\\displaystyle\\int{dx}\\,\\left[\\mathbf{d}^b_2\\left(w(x)y_{\\ell{m}}(x)\\right)\\right]^\\dag\\cdot\\mathbf{p}(x ) .",
    "\\label{abtilde}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath24 a spin-0 window function satisfying the dirichlet and neumann conditions on the boundary of the observed sky region .",
    "such conditions on the window function are mandatory for the estimated multipoles to be free of a @xmath0 leakage due to partial sky .",
    "this can be easily shown in the pixel - domain .",
    "on applying an integration by parts twice to eqs .   & and taking into account the boundary properties of @xmath24 , we can rewrite the estimated multipoles as  @xcite , @xmath67 given that the operator @xmath68 filters out all the @xmath69 modes , the multipole decomposition defined above indeed should be free of any @xmath0 mixing .",
    "( we point out that the above harmonic decomposition corresponds to the decomposition on a partial sky of the so - called @xmath70 fields defined in  @xcite . ) a simple way to understand this point is to notice that applying @xmath71 to the polarization field corresponds to a local filtering of the @xmath4 modes whereas projecting on the @xmath72 basis corresponds to a global filtering . because of this difference",
    ", the latter of these two techniques suffers from partial sky effects whereas the former one does not .",
    "in other words , if the window , @xmath24 , satisfies the dirichlet and neumann boundary conditions , the multipoles estimated in eqs .   and are pure and the mixing kernel , @xmath44 , is a block diagonal matrix in the @xmath0 subspace , i.e. , @xmath73 this last condition , intuitively obvious given our previous discussion , can be formally derived from eq .   defining , @xmath74 a more detailed discussion of the mixing matrix and related issues is presented in the next section and appendix  [ app : mixkernel ] .

    "we rather calculate the pure multipoles using eqs .   & .",
    "we refer hereafter to this way of performing calculations as the spin - weighted approach .",
    "consequently , @xmath75 operators need to be applied directly only to products of the spherical harmonics times the window function .",
    "this is an approach also adopted in @xcite .",
    "our numerical implementation proceeds in two steps .",
    "first , we define two spin - weighted windows , @xmath76 and construct three new fields , @xmath77 @xmath78 is a spin-@xmath10 field , since @xmath79 has spin @xmath80 and @xmath81  spin 2 . then , on the second step , we calculate the pure multipoles as linear combinations of the @xmath4 and @xmath2 multipoles of the three new fields .",
    "the latter can be derived from eqs .   &   with the help of eqs .   &  .",
    "for instance , in the case of the @xmath2-modes , the pure estimated multipoles read , @xmath82 with @xmath83 denoting the @xmath2-type multipoles of the @xmath78 field as in eq .  .",
    "numerically the entire computation comes down to an efficient calculation of the spin spherical harmonic transforms .",
    "we comment on those in more detail later in this section .",
    "equation offers another insight into the pure estimator formalism . the first term on the _ rhs _ of this equation corresponds to the standard estimator , while the two following ones act as counter - terms removing the leaked @xmath4-mode .",
    "indeed we have found that they are anticorrelated with the first term as expected in such an interpretation .",
    "[ [ numerical - derivatives . ] ] numerical derivatives .",
    "+ + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    the knowledge of the three spin window functions is needed for numerically computing the pure multipoles . as will be clear in the next section , there are cases where only the spin-0 window is known .",
    "therefore , we need an efficient way to derive the spin-1 and spin-2 windows from the spin-0 one , which in turn requires a numerical calculation of window derivatives",
    ". hereafter we will perform this computation in the harmonic space , @xmath84 the final spin-1 and spin-2 windows are then obtained by transforming back to the pixel - domain .",
    "this technique allows us to use simple analytic window functions on complicated sky coverage , for which only the spin-0 part can be easily computed .",
    "it also ensures that the conditions given in eq .   are fulfilled . by doing this computation in harmonic space",
    ", we may introduce some ringing due to the pixelization ( or gridding ) of the sphere .",
    "indeed , we have found some minor artefacts of this sort when comparing numerically computed windows with the respective analytic expressions in cases when the latter could be calculated , e.g. , in cases with apodizations as in eqs .   &   and for simple observed sky patches .",
    "it appears , however , that such ringing does not seem to affect our ability to control the @xmath0 leakage at scales where this control is mandatory .",
    "for instance , for a @xmath85 degree square patch pixelized with healpix pixels with @xmath86 , the residual , leaked @xmath4-modes calculated using the numerical spin windows reproduce closely those obtained analytically all the way up to @xmath87 . for higher values of @xmath37",
    ", the use of numerical computation leads to a slight increase of the residual leakage .",
    "we expect that to be always the case , independently of the apodization length as long as it is sufficiently greater than the pixel size",
    ".    in general the discrepancy between the exact and numerical spin windows depends on patch geometry .",
    "for example , the discrepancy is reduced for a spherical cap as compared to a square patch .",
    "its magnitude will also in general depend on the assumed pixelization and in particular may be greatly enhanced if the considered region is in a particular position and/or orientation with respect to the pixelization scheme . however , whenever necessary , such a discrepancy can be reduced or at least shifted to higher @xmath37-values by going to a higher resolution .",

    "we utilize here a publicly available , scalable spherical harmonic transforms ( s@xmath94hat ) library  @xcite .",
    "this parallel library allows for an efficient computation of arbitrary spin transforms for a general class of sky griddings and pixelization in which the pixels ( grid points ) are distributed along the constant declination lines .",
    "these include therefore the most frequently used in the cmb work , e.g. , healpix  @xcite , glesp  @xcite , ecp  @xcite as well as some others .",
    "the spin spherical harmonics are computed using the recurrence relations as listed in  @xcite , which are appropriately rescaled to avoid numerical under- and overflows .",
    "the library is designed to treat optimally the cases with only a partial sky coverage and is therefore particularly suitable for our purposes here .",
    "it is parallelized using the message passing interface ( mpi ) and distributes over the processors both the pixel ( maps ) and harmonic ( harmonic coefficients ) domain objects permitting to achieve high resolutions with modest memory resources available per single processor .",
    "performance and in a result applicability of the pure ( cross ) spectra formalism is clearly dependent on our ability to compute a suitable apodization for any specific cmb polarization experiment . in this section",
    "we introduce a number of proposal functions , which could be used as apodizations in calculations of the pure ( cross ) spectra .",
    "the discussed functions range from ones derived as a result of optimization procedures and therefore often numerically involved , to ones proposed somewhat _ ad hoc _ but quick and easy to calculate .",
    "we will discuss their relative merit only briefly here , postponing a more thorough comparison of their performance to the following sections .      in realistic applications we would like to have an apodization function which would ensure that the total ( i.e. , noise plus sample variance ) uncertainty of the recovered power spectra is ( nearly ) minimal . in the case of the auto pure pseudo",
    "spectra a general ansatz for such optimized weighting has been proposed recently by smith and zaldarriaga  @xcite .",
    "it is derived as a condition on the apodization window required to minimize the difference between the auto pseudo - spectrum of a map and its optimal counterpart .",
    "those authors have obtained a following relation for the ( nearly ) optimal weights , @xmath95 here the summation is made over the @xmath96 observed pixels .",
    "the matrix @xmath97 is the covariance matrix of the data and @xmath26 is a geometrical matrix which comes from the projection on harmonic space ( for example the legendre polynomials matrix in the case of temperature ) .",
    "the optimized weight function can be then obtained by a numerical inversion of the above linear system for each bin @xmath30 .",
    "it can be shown  @xcite that such optimized windows converge towards inverse square - noise weighting in the noise - dominated case .",
    "this is a regime usually reached at the high-@xmath37 end of the estimated power spectrum .",
    "we refer the reader for more details about the derivation of this relation to  @xcite .    for the computation of the cross - spectrum we need to compute an apodization for each of the available maps .",
    "the approach of  @xcite has to be therefore extended to accommodate such cases .",
    "this can be done in a number of ways .",
    "for instance , using eq .",
    "we can compute an apodization for each map considering them separately or together .",
    "alternately , we could apply a reasoning similar to that of  @xcite but in the context of the cross - spectrum to derive a relation analogous to eq .",
    "but applicable to the cross - spectra . though this last approach may seem the most appropriate for the case at hand it unfortunately results in an expression , eq .",
    ", which is computationally rather involved .",
    "the two first options mentioned above are numerically more tractable , though they produce windows , which minimize the difference between the pure pseudo - spectrum estimator and its optimal counter - part on the auto spectrum level .",
    "the first of these two approaches uses for that purpose the auto spectrum of the map for which the apodization is sought , while the second one  the single auto spectrum of all the maps considered .",
    "clearly , which one of the two methods is more appropriate will depend on the specific goals of the entire estimation procedure .",
    "we note for example that in the case of two maps with the same noise properties the difference between the two optimization approaches is limited only to a different overall factor determining the level of the noise with respect to the sky signal ( see appendix  [ app : crossoptwin ] for more details ) .",
    "hereafter , we will utilize the first option and solve eq .   as in the pure pseudo auto spectrum case for each of the two maps .",
    "we will support this choice in the following sections with the help of numerical experiments .",
    "equation can be specialized to a particular case of polarization when the input data used are composed of the stokes @xmath5 and @xmath6 maps .",
    "the geometrical matrix @xmath98 needs to be then extended into the spin subspaces and nonzero spin windows introduced .",
    "their implicit definition consequently reads , @xmath99 where an additional summation over spins of the windows is added .",
    "the geometrical matrix , @xmath100 , describing the projection on spin - weighted spherical harmonics , is now explicitly dependent on the spin value , @xmath10 , and in general is not diagonal in the spin subspace .",
    "the vector @xmath101 is a @xmath102 vector whose first @xmath96 entries are equal to one , corresponding to the normalization of the spin-0 component , and all the others",
    "are set to zero  @xcite .",
    "the approach can be also looked at as an attempt to minimize the total , signal plus noise , power aliased to a given bin either from the other adjacent bins or the other modes ( e.g. , @xmath0 leakage ) .",
    "this viewpoint is referred to as the variational interpretation in  @xcite .",
    "consequently , in general there is always a different window function calculated for each bin as a result of this procedure .",
    "this has two consequences .",
    "first of all , one has to deal with a set of windows optimized for each bin .",
    "second , this means that one has to define each bin parameters before performing the optimization procedure .    below we discuss implementation of this kind of optimization procedure in both pixel and harmonic domains .",
    "the matrix operations in eq .   should be done preferably in a pixel - domain .",
    "that allows to consider a full potential complexity of the map noise properties as well as arbitrary masks with complicated boundaries and/or holes due to point - sources extraction , rendering such an implementation very flexible .    , but computed assuming numerically optimized pixel - domain window functions and a more realistic sky patch as could be observed by cmb b - mode balloon - borne experiments , such ebex , ( see fig .",

    "however , hereafter following @xcite , we relax these constraints in the numerical implementation of the procedure .",
    "this allows for greater flexibility and therefore enables finding window functions better suited for our needs .",
    "nevertheless , this simplification has a major consequence : the pure pseudo-@xmath29 estimator is not perfectly pure and will unavoidably introduce some @xmath0 leakage in addition to the one induced by the pixelization itself .",
    "this residual leakage may become problematic in the low-@xmath37 region where sampling variance is the major contribution to the error bars .",
    "we note however that in the high signal - to - noise ratio regime the resulting windows are expected to nearly fulfill all the constraints , even if those are not explicitly imposed .",
    "this is because the total variance minimization approach used in  @xcite to derive eq .",
    "implies that the solution for which the counter - terms in eq .   nearly cancel the leaked signal included in the first term is preferred over those for which three terms are independent , which unavoidably boosts the variance . in the noise - dominated regime",
    ", the leaked @xmath0 signal is quickly becoming subdominant and therefore it will be the noise variance , not the leaked @xmath4 signal , which will be the major target of the optimization . in this case",
    ", the perfect apodization of the window , i.e. , as required by the pure formalism , may not be the best solution , which should gradually , with a decreasing signal - to - noise ratio , approach the standard inverse noise weighting .",
    "we point out here that the window function satisfying eq",
    ".   ensures only that the uncertainty is minimized on the pseudo - spectrum not on the power spectrum level .",
    "in particular , if the mixing matrix is not block diagonal , i.e. , some residual @xmath0 leakage allowed , the final power spectrum uncertainty may not be strictly at its minimum . nevertheless ,",
    "though some @xmath0 leakage may be indeed present , it will be correctly accounted for in our calculation of the mixing matrix , and therefore consistently treated in the presented method .",
    "we show in fig .",
    "[ fig : mixmatpcgebex ] that the computational approach to the calculation of the mixing matrix proposed here , and already discussed in the case of a simple sky patch and analytic window , fares indeed very well also in the case with the nearly optimized window functions",
    ".    the fact that eq .   is solved relaxing the derivative constraints between the spin-@xmath10 and spin-0 components does not reduce it to a set of three independent equations ",
    "one for each spin - weighted window .",
    "this is because the geometrical matrix @xmath98 is not diagonal in the spin subspace .",
    "consequently all three windows have to be solved for simultaneously .",
    "in order to do so , following @xcite we have implemented an iterative preconditioned conjugate gradient ( pcg ) solver  @xcite .",
    "the numerical cost of such an operation is high and on order of @xmath103 , if no symmetries are present .",
    "a number of the iterations , @xmath104 , is usually as high as a few hundreds and it is strongly dependent on a dynamic range spanned by the pixel noise amplitudes .",
    "nonetheless , for small - scale experiments with the help of a proper thresholding the computational load is clearly within the limits of available presentday ( super)computers .",
    "we note that for the high signal - to - noise cases imposing explicitly the constraints on the window functions could reduce the number of iterations required for the procedure to converge .",

    "it contains all the pixels for which a number of observations is not smaller than @xmath175 , reducing the dynamical range of the noise levels from roughly @xmath178 to @xmath179 .",
    "this has an unavoidable and unfortunate impact on a observed sky area , which in the studied case decreases from @xmath180% down to @xmath181% of the total sky .",
    "we set the noise level per sample in such a way that average noise level for the full patch corresponds to that used in the homogeneous noise cases studied earlier .    in fig .",
    "[ inhomo - analytic ] we show the variances of the @xmath2-mode spectra computed using full ( left panel ) and only well - observed part of the patch ( right panel ) .",
    "the gain with respect to the noise variance largely compensates for the loss in terms of sample variance due to removal of the very noisy pixels close to the edge of the full survey area .",
    "this is especially apparent for @xmath182 .",
    "when analyzing the full sky survey , long apodization lengths are preferred as underlined by the red crosses displaying the minimal variance achieved for each bin .",
    "this is because a long apodization length allows us better to mitigate the influence of the noisiest pixels at the edge and thus to lower the noise variance .",
    "this also explains why small apodization lengths are suboptimal for the entire range of considered @xmath37-modes .",
    "however , once the noisiest pixels are removed ( top - right panel ) , the situation changes drastically .",
    "moderate apodizations are preferred at large angular scales ( @xmath154 degrees for @xmath183 ) .",
    "this value of the optimized apodization length is the same as for the homogeneous case .",
    "nevertheless , at small angular scales , the behavior of the variance with respect to the apodization length for the inhomogeneous noise differs from the homogeneous noise case . for the latter",
    ", small , @xmath3 degrees , apodizations are preferred at small angular scales whereas long apodizations should be used at small scales , @xmath184 degrees for @xmath185 , for the former .",
    "such a modification is due to the noise variance ( we remind that with analytic windows , the @xmath4-to-@xmath2 leakage is sufficently lowered below the noise level ) . in this part of the spectrum",
    ", windowing should converge towards inverse - noise weighting for the estimation to be close to optimal . in the homogeneous noise case , this requires to lower as much as possible the apodization length . in the inhomogeneous case",
    ", however , this means that windowing should be as close as possible to the actual noise distribution . for our realistic example , the noise distribution as shown on fig .",
    "[ nhit ] , exhibits a relatively high apodization length , which translates into a large apodization needed for the window to be optimal .         in a more general case",
    "the question if any given analytic window can produce the results close to the optimal is more complex and will depend on both the window and the noise distribution .",
    "in fact , at high @xmath37 , the near optimality can be reached only if the adopted window function approximates the inverse noise weighting .    our discussion and results derived above show that the analytic windows introduced in this paper can indeed be appropriate for noise patterns similar to ebex .",
    "a more general approach , applicable to other noise inhomogeneity patterns is also however possible .",
    "we first note that multiplying any of the analytic apodization studied here by some smooth function of the sky position will result in a proper apodization , which suppresses the @xmath0 leakage .",
    "we emphasize that this observation is indeed strictly true only for nonpixelized skies and as usual a care has to be exercised whenever pixelization is introduced . in general , for pixelized skies the smooth function",
    "needs also to be sufficiently flat at the boundary not to lead to some uncontrolled level of leakage . in the case at hand",
    "we derive the new spin-0 window by multipling the analytic windows by a pixel - dependent weight corresponding to the inverse squared noise weighting , @xmath186 , where , @xmath187 is the estimated noise variance at pixel @xmath188 .",
    "we then numerically compute the spin-1 and spin-2 components from it .",

    "[ inhomo - analytic ] for the full survey ( left panel ) and its well - observed part ( right panel ) , where colors refer to the value of the apodization length of @xmath123 .",
    "the results show that using this inverse - noise weighting significanlty reduces the total variance , particularly for small apodization length .",
    "this explains the origin of the extra - variance at low-@xmath37 end seen in the upper panels of fig .",
    "[ inhomo - analytic ] relating it to the noise of the noisy pixels present at the map boundary .",

    "we note however that this fact is related to the specific noise distribution considered here and will be applicable in general only to the cases with a sufficient , noise - induced apodization present at the patch edges , which , as shown here , are however of a practical interest . at the high-@xmath37 part , this is because the near optimality is reached thanks to the inverse - noise weighting and therefore the small apodization length of the analytic part of the window is preferred , as it affects the total window shape to the least extent . at the low-@xmath37 part of the spectrum , without the extra noise - weighting an apodization length of 4 degrees",
    "was needed for the analytic weighting alone . the effective , noise - induced apodization is larger than that and the apodization length for the analytic part of the window can be therefore smaller as the latter is needed only to fulfill the boundary conditions and reduce the @xmath0 leakage .",
    "somewhat counter - intuitively the numerically derived estimates of the power spectrum uncertainties are seen in fig .",
    "[ inhomo - analytic ] to be superior to the forecasts based on the fisher formalism .",
    "this is due to the fact that the latter are based on the average noise level computed assuming the same number of observed samples as in the actual case , but now homogeneously distributed over the entire observed sky area , and the numerical calculations benefit , thanks to either noise - weighting or appropriate @xmath37-bin dependent apodization , from the very low noise core of the patch , which dominates the constraints at the high-@xmath37 end of the spectrum .",
    "a comparison of the best estimates of the spectral variance derived with different analytic windows is shown in fig .",
    "[ inhomo - analytic - resume ] .",
    "it demonstrates the importance of the down - weighting of the very noisy pixels for the full patch analysis ( left panel ) , which is needed to achieve a variance level lower than the input @xmath2-mode at large angular scales .",
    "this effect is particularly prominent for the @xmath134-window , which by construction is less smooth towards the patch boundary than the @xmath124-window , and adding inverse noise weighting is here mandatory .",
    "if the noisiest pixels are removed from the analysis ( right panel ) , using inverse - noise weighting performs the same as analytic windows alone except for @xmath190 , where inverse - noise weighting is somewhat suboptimal as compared to analytic windowing alone .",
    "this effect is analogous to the usual loss of precision in the signal - dominated regime also seen in the standard pseudo power spectrum cases .",
    "however , as noted previously , the results derived with the explicit inverse - noise weighting have not required any mc - based optimization in the case studied here . therefore though suboptimal for @xmath190 they can certainly be used to provide a first and reliable estimate of the @xmath2-mode power spectrum , at least in the cases whenever the noise distribution complies with the assumptions as already spelled out earlier .",

    "the apodization length of the analytic windows ( which include no noise - weighting here ) has been optimized in each bin in order to minimize the variance . clearly , the windows optimized numerically in the pixel - domain display very similar levels of the uncertainty on the recovered power spectrum level as derived with the analytic apodizations .",
    "the harmonic space optimized window shows however an excess of variance in the entire range of considered @xmath37-modes .",
    "this is because it has been calculated using the average noise level , which in all bins has incorporated all the pixels , including those close to the patch boundary , therefore it does not benefit from the low - variance of the pixels in the very center of the patch . at the high-@xmath37",
    "end the variance obtained with the harmonic domain window follows closely the fisher matrix estimate , which has been derived using the same approximation for the adopted noise level .",
    "we have implemented the pure pseudo - spectrum formalism of @xcite extending it to incorporate the cross - spectrum approach and discussed practical issues related to its implementation . in particular , we have presented a quick , efficient way to compute pure multipoles and their respective mode mixing kernels utilizing harmonic domain derivatives , and demonstrated its overall consistency .",

    "we have considered the role of the sky priors in the apodization optimization procedures , as well as proposed an iterative , prior - free approach to the @xmath2-mode power spectrum estimation .",
    "our results support the assertion of  @xcite and show that the pure pseudo spectrum approach not only can successfully resolve the @xmath0 leakage problem but , if properly applied , it also allows to bring down the total variance of the estimated power spectrum to levels comparable with those derived from the optimal approaches . and it can do that at the significantly lower computational costs .",
    "in fact , we usually find that the power spectrum variance derived with the pure approach is within a factor of @xmath165 away from the reference variance based on the fisher matrix approach , which neglects the @xmath0 leakage and assumes no apodization ( but a binary mask ) .",

    "the numerical window optimization as proposed in  @xcite have been shown to provide an efficient framework for the optimized window computation applicable to a wide variety of the problems .",

    "the complexity of the problem can be reduced by assuming that the integral of the spin-0 and the spin-1 windows on the contour have to vanish , leading to only two additional constraints @xmath255 here @xmath256 is the harmonic representation of the contour .",
    "the second equation above corresponds to the spin-1 constraint as @xmath257 .",
    "the optimized spin-0 window can be then derived by applying the standard lagrange multiplier techniques , resulting in , @xmath258 the two constants , @xmath120 and @xmath121 , are derived by plugging the above solution into the constraints . defining the following total power ,",
    "@xmath259 the two constants read , @xmath260 .",
    "\\label{eqn : mudef}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    in this derivation the boundary constraints have been partially relaxed , making the window only partially optimize .",
    "the numerical experiments , however , show that the resulting power spectra uncertainties are at the same level as the ones obtained using the exact , pixel - domain computation of the optimized window ( see fig .",
    "[ variance - optimal ] ) .",
    "this demonstrates that the proposed boundary constraint simplification does not compromise the performances of this fast computed , optimized window .",
    "we point out that the above approach is general and does not apply only to the @xmath2-mode fields .",
    "for instance , we can use it to calculate optimized windows for a temperature ( scalar ) map .",
    "it suffices then to replace @xmath261 in eq .   by the total ( signal plus noise ) power spectra ,",
    "i.e. , @xmath262 , of the map . moreover , we can straightforwardly relax some of the boundary requirements .",
    "for example , if no boundary conditions are to be imposed , we just need to replace eqs .  - with , @xmath263 while in a case when only the dirichlet boundary condition is to be imposed , the two constants are given by : @xmath264    99 bicep : http://www.astro.caltech.edu/@xmath1lgg/ + bicep_front.htm planck : http://www.esa.int/esasc/ + 120398_index_0_m.html polarbear : http://bolo.berkeley.edu/polarbear/ + science / science.html quiet : http://quiet.uchicago.edu/ clover : http://www-astro.physics.ox.ac.uk/research/ + expcosmology / groupclover.html ebex : http://groups.physics.umn.edu/cosmology + /ebex/ spider : http://www.astro.caltech.edu/@xmath1lgg/ + spider_front.htm brain : http://www.apc.univ-paris7.fr/apc_cs/ + experiences / brain/ b - pol : http://www.b-pol.org/index.php m.g .",

    "<S> we extend the pure pseudo - power - spectrum formalism proposed recently in the context of the cosmic microwave background polarized power spectra estimation by smith ( 2006 ) to incorporate cross - spectra computed for multiple maps of the same sky area . </S>",
    "<S> we present an implementation of such a technique , paying particular attention to a calculation of the relevant window functions and mixing ( mode - coupling ) matrices . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss the relevance and treatment of the residual @xmath0 leakage for a number of considered sky apodizations as well as compromises and assumptions involved in an optimization of the resulting power spectrum uncertainty . in particular , we investigate the importance of a pixelization scheme , patch geometry , and sky signal priors used in apodization optimization procedures . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , we also present results derived for more realistic sky scans as motivated by the proposed balloon borne experiment ebex . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that the presented formalism thanks to its speed and efficiency can provide an interesting alternative to the cmb polarized power spectra estimators based on the optimal methods at least on angular scales smaller than @xmath110 degrees . in this regime </S>",
    "<S> , we find that it is capable of suppressing the total variance of the estimated @xmath2-mode spectrum to within a factor of @xmath3 of the variance due to only the sampling and noise uncertainty of the @xmath2-modes alone , as derived from the fisher matrix approach . </S>"
