    "a set @xmath0 of points in @xmath1 is said to be in * general position * if every set of @xmath9 or fewer points of @xmath0 is affinely independent , or , in other words , if any @xmath10-flat in @xmath1 ( @xmath11 ) contains at most @xmath12 points of @xmath0 .",
    "this condition can be simplified :    @xmath13 is in general position if either @xmath14 and @xmath0 is affinely independent , or @xmath15 and every @xmath9 points of @xmath0 are affinely independent .",
    "general position is a rather weak property .",
    "e.g. , the vertices of a regular @xmath16-gon @xmath17 are in general position , even though the main diagonals of @xmath18 cross in a common point , and , moreover , opposite edges span parallel lines .    in this paper we consider a stronger property , called * strong general position * ( sgp ) .",
    "a finite set @xmath19 is said to be in sgp if , for any collection @xmath2 of @xmath3 pairwise disjoint subsets of @xmath4 , the affine hulls @xmath20 intersect as if they were flats chosen at random .",
    "the formal condition is : @xmath21    as we shall see , this condition implies ( ordinary ) general position .    if we want to check whether a given large set @xmath13 is in sgp , we are faced with a huge number of conditions of the form @xmath22 .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to reduce this number , i.e. , to find a much smaller , essentially minimal set of conditions that will ensure that a given finite set @xmath23 is in sgp .",
    "this reduction could be of use to anyone who wishes to work seriously with the notion of sgp .",
    "we use it in @xcite to show that points chosen on the moment curve @xmath24 in @xmath25 ( @xmath26 ) are `` usually '' in sgp .",
    "the notion of strong general position has been used ( under the name `` strong independence '' ) by reay in @xcite and by doignon and valette in @xcite .",
    "strong general position plays an important role in connection with tverberg s theorem :    [ thm : tverberg ] ( h. tverberg , 1966 ) let @xmath27 be points in @xmath28 . if @xmath29 , then the set @xmath30 of indices can be partitioned into r disjoint parts @xmath31 in such a way that the r convex hulls @xmath32 have a point in common .",
    "( this formulation covers also the case where the points @xmath27 are not all distinct . )",
    "the original proof ( see @xcite ) was quite difficult . in 1981",
    "tverberg published another proof , much simpler than the original one ( see @xcite ) .",
    "sarkaria @xcite gave a quite accessible proof , with some algebraic flavor .",
    "it seems that the simplest proof so far is due to roudneff @xcite .",
    "see @xcite  8.3 for further information .",
    "the numbers @xmath33 are known as tverberg numbers .",
    "the condition @xmath34 in tverberg s theorem is extremely tight .",
    "if @xmath35 , and the points @xmath27 are in sgp , then for any @xmath3-partition @xmath31 of the set @xmath36 , even the intersection of the * affine * hulls @xmath37 is empty .",
    "( see details in the next section . )    our reduction ( see theorem @xmath38 below ) will show that if @xmath39 is a finite set in general position , then @xmath0 is in sgp iff , for any collection @xmath40 of pairwise disjoint non - empty subsets of @xmath0 ( with @xmath41 for all @xmath42 of total size @xmath43 , the intersection @xmath44 is a single point if @xmath45 , or empty if @xmath46 .",
    "as we shall see in section @xmath47 , finite subsets of @xmath1 are `` usually '' in sgp , in the following strong sense : given @xmath48 and @xmath49 , there exists a polynomial @xmath50 , not identically zero , in @xmath51 scalar variables : @xmath52 , such that any @xmath49 points @xmath53 are ( distinct and ) in sgp unless @xmath54 .",
    "there are notions of independence that are even stronger than sgp .",
    "in fact , the first proof of tverberg s theorem in @xcite runs under the assumption that the points @xmath55 are * algebraically independent * , i.e. , that the @xmath51 coordinates @xmath56 are algebraically independent over the field of rational numbers .",
    "a limiting argument then establishes tverberg s theorem for all @xmath55 .",
    "a @xmath57-dimensional flat in @xmath58 is the set of solutions of a system of @xmath10 linearly independent linear equations ( not necessarily homogeneous ) in @xmath48 variables .",
    "it follows that if @xmath59 are flats in @xmath1 , and @xmath60 for @xmath61 , then the intersection @xmath62 will `` usually '' be a flat of dimension @xmath63 ( when @xmath64 , or @xmath65 ( when @xmath66 the dimension of the empty set @xmath67 is , by definition , @xmath68 .",
