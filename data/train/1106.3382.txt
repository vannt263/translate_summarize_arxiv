    "in recent years , a great deal of attention has been focused on the study of regular arrays of magnetic particles produced by nano - imprint lithography . besides the basic scientific interest in the magnetic properties of these systems",
    ", there is evidence that they might be used in the production of new magnetic devices , or as media for high density magnetic recording @xcite .",
    "one of the main points in the study of such systems concerns the internal magnetic structure of the nanoparticles as a function of their shape and size .",
    "for example , in the case of cylindrically shaped particles produced by electrodeposition , the internal arrangements of the magnetic moments have been identified as been close to one of the following three ( idealized ) characteristic configurations , namely ferromagnetic with the magnetization parallel to the basis of the cylinder ( @xmath1 ) , ferromagnetic with the magnetization parallel to the cylinder axis ( @xmath2 ) , and a vortex state , in which most of the magnetic moments lie parallel to the basis of the cylinder ( @xmath3 ) @xcite .",
    "the occurrence of each of these configurations depends on geometrical factors , such as the linear dimensions of the cylinders and their aspect ratio .",
    "clearly , for the development of magnetic devices based on those arrays , knowledge of the internal magnetic structure of the particles is of fundamental importance .",
    "experimentally , attempts have been made to determine , from the analysis of hysteresis curves@xcite , the range of values of diameter @xmath4 and height @xmath5 of cylindrically shaped particles for which the internal arrangement of the magnetic moments is close to either one of the two ferromagnetic configurations ( @xmath1 or @xmath2 ) or  to the vortex one ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "however , such approach does not allow a clear description of the magnetic structure of individual cylinders , since in many cases the internal magnetic configurations are not readily identifiable from magnetization curves .",
    "on the other hand , theoretical determination of the configuration of lowest energy of particles in the size range of those currently produced , based on a microscopic approach and using present standard computational facilities , is out of reach .",
    "the reason is the exceedingly large number of magnetic moments within such particles , which may exceed 10@xmath6 recently , dalbuquerque e castro _ _ et al.__@xcite have proposed a scaling technique for determining the phase diagram giving the configuration of lowest energy among the three above mentioned characteristic magnetic configurations .",
    "they have shown that such diagram can be obtained from those for much smaller particles , in which the exchange interaction @xmath7 has been scaled down by a factor @xmath8 , i.e. for @xmath9 .",
    "the diagram for the full strength of the exchange interaction is then obtained by scaling up the @xmath10 and @xmath11 axes in the phase diagram for @xmath12 by a factor @xmath13 . in their work",
    ", the exponent @xmath0 has been determined numerically from the position , as a function of @xmath14 , of a triple point @xmath15 in the phase diagram where the three configurations have equal energy .",
    "the scaling technique has been applied to the determination of the phase diagram of cylindrically shaped @xcite and truncated conical@xcite particles . in both cases , @xmath0 turned out to be approximately equal to @xmath16 .",
    "we recall that the vortex configuration exhibits a core region within which the magnetic moments have a non - zero component parallel to the axis of either the cylinder or the truncated cone .",
    "we remark that the determination of the geometry of the core ( i.e. its shape and size ) , on the basis of a microscopic model in which the individual magnetic moments are considered , would require a prohibitively large computational effort . for this reason , dalbuquerque e castro _ _ et al.__@xcite and escrig _ _",
    "et al.__@xcite adopted a simplified representation of the vortex core , consisting of a single line of magnetic moments along the axis of either the cylinders or the truncated cones .",
    "the phase diagrams thus obtained are in good agreement with experimental data , provided appropriate values of the exchange are considered .",
    "the scaling technique represents a useful tool for studying the magnetic properties of nanosized particles .",
    "it is conceptually simple and rather interesting from the theoretical point of view .",
    "its implementation depends on the determination of the exponent @xmath0 in the scaling factor , which so far has been done numerically .",
    "the agreement , within error bars , between the values of @xmath0 for cylinders and truncated conical particles suggests that this parameter does not depend on the shape of the particles .",
    "however , there still remains the question regarding the possible dependence of @xmath0 on the geometry of the vortex core .",
    "the present work aims precisely at clarifying this point .",
    "we focus on cylindrically shaped particles , for which a large amount of experimental data is available .",
    "we adopt a continuous model for the internal magnetic structure of the particles , on the basis of which analytical results for the total energy in each configuration can be obtained .",
    "we use these results to investigate the behavior of the phase diagrams under scaling transformation , from which the value of @xmath0 can be determined .",
    "we find that the value of @xmath0 does depend on the geometry of the vortex core .",
    "this point is discussed at length below .",
    "we adopt a simplified description of the system , in which the discrete distribution of magnetic moments is replaced with a continuous one , defined by a function @xmath17 such that @xmath18 gives the total magnetization within the element of volume @xmath19 centered at @xmath20 .",
    "this model provides a fairly good basis for the discussion of the magnetic properties of nanosized particles . for cylindrically shaped particles",
    ", the magnetization density @xmath21 in the two ferromagnetic configurations , @xmath1 and @xmath22 is given by @xmath23 and @xmath24 , respectively . here",
    "@xmath25  is the saturation magnetization density , and @xmath26 and @xmath27 are unit vectors parallel to the basis and to the axis of the cylinders , respectively . for the vortex configuration , we assume that the magnetization density has the form@xmath28 where @xmath27 and @xmath29 are unit vectors in cylindrical coordinates , and @xmath30 and @xmath31 satisfy the relation @xmath32 . thus , the profile of the vortex core is fully specified by just giving the function @xmath33 .",
    "it is worth pointing out that the functional form in eq.([mv ] ) does not take into account the possibility of a dependence of the core shape on coordinate @xmath34 .",
    "we then look at the total energy of the three configurations under consideration , from which the magnetic phase diagram can be obtained and its behavior under scaling investigated .",
    "we restrict our discussion to arrays in which the separation between cylinders is sufficiently large for the interaction between them to be ignored.@xcite    the internal energy per unit of volume , @xmath35 of a single cylinder is given by the sum  of three terms corresponding to the magnetostatic ( @xmath36 ) , the exchange ( @xmath37 ) , and the anisotropy ( @xmath38 ) contributions .",
    "however , in the case of particles produced by electrodeposition , the crystalline anisotropy term is much smaller than the other two@xcite , so its inclusion has little effect on the phase diagram . in view of that",
    ", it will be neglected in our calculations .",
    "since the exchange term depends only on the relative orientation of the magnetic moments , it has the same value @xmath39 in the two ferromagnetic configurations .",
    "since it also appears as an additive term in the expression for exchange energy in the vortex configuration , it can be simply left out in our calculations .    the magnetostatic term is generally given by@xcite @xmath40where @xmath41 is the magnetostatic potential . in the above expression ,",
    "an additive term independent of the configuration has been left out . for the ferromagnetic configurations we find that@xmath42where @xmath43 , @xmath2 , and @xmath44 are the demagnetizing factors , given in si unities by@xcite @xmath45 -\\frac{2d}{3\\pi h } ,   \\label{nf1}\\]]and @xmath46 + \\frac{4d}{3\\pi h}.   \\label{nf2}\\]]in the above two equations",
    ", @xmath47 is a hypergeometric function .",
    "notice that demagnetizing factors depend on just the ratio @xmath48 .",
    "assuming that @xmath49 varies slowly on the scale of the lattice parameter , the exchange term for this configuration can be approximated by@xcite@xmath50where @xmath51 is the exchange stiffness constant , and @xmath52 , for @xmath53 .",
    "we recall that @xmath51 is proportional to the exchange interaction energy @xmath7 between the magnetic moments.@xcite making use of the expression for @xmath54 in eq.([mv ] ) , we find @xmath55where @xmath56 , and @xmath57 , with @xmath58 .",
    "the additive term @xmath39 on the r.h.s . of the above equation has been omitted .",
    "the magnetostatic term can be also written in terms of @xmath49 . in the vortex configuration , the magnetostatic potential is given by@xmath59where @xmath60 and @xmath61 are the surfaces of the top and bottom basis of the cylinder , respectively .",
    "after some manipulations , the expression for @xmath62  reduces to@xmath63where @xmath64 is the cylindrical bessel function of order zero . taking this result into eq.([edip ] ) , we find@xcite@xmath65",
    "at this point , it is necessary to specify the function @xmath66 .",
    "since no rigorous result regarding the shape of the vortex core is available , we resort to a simple but physically plausible approximation , given by@xmath67where @xmath68 and @xmath69 is a non - negative constant .",
    "alternative expressions for @xmath66 have been proposed in the literature.@xcite    the above functional form for @xmath66 allows us to evaluate the energy integrals in eqs .",
    "( [ eexv ] ) and ( [ edipv ] ) analytically .",
    "then , for integer values of @xmath69 , the expression for @xmath70 in eq.(eexv ) reduces to    @xmath71    where @xmath72",

    "having evaluated all relevant contributions to the total energy in the three cases of interest , we are in a position to investigate the magnetic phase diagram for cylinders",
    ". in particular , we can look at the position of the triple point @xmath15 as a function of the factor @xmath14 which scales the stiffness constant @xmath51 ( or exchange interaction @xmath7 ) .",
    "we notice that since the energy of the two ferromagnetic configurations , @xmath80 and @xmath81 , are equal at the triple point , we immediately get the equation @xmath82whose solution is @xmath83 ( independent of @xmath51 or @xmath84).@xcite as a consequence , @xmath85 and @xmath86 are proportional and must exhibit the same functional dependence on @xmath14 ( or equivalently , on @xmath87 ) .",
    "we proceed in our analysis by looking at the case considered by dalbuquerque e castro _ _ et al.,__@xcite in which the core radius is independent of @xmath14 , and of the order of the lattice spacing ( first core model ) .",
    "this corresponds to taking the limit @xmath88 in the expressions for the total energy . in this limit",
    ", @xmath89 becomes much larger in modulus than @xmath90 , so that the latter can be safely neglected in eq.([eexvm ] ) .",
    "then , eqs .",
    "( [ edipf ] ) , ( [ eexvm ] ) , and ( [ edipvm ] ) give the following equation for @xmath91 @xmath92where @xmath93 is either @xmath1 or @xmath2 . now , if we scale down the exchange interaction by a factor @xmath8 , that is to say , if we consider a reduced exchange stiffness @xmath94 , and assume that @xmath91 and the new radius at the triple point @xmath95 are related according to @xmath96 we find @xmath97this expression gives us the following equation for @xmath0@xmath98    it is clear from this equation that @xmath0 must in all cases be greater than 0.5 .",
    "it approaches this lower bound only when @xmath91 is much larger than the lattice spacing ( _ i.e. _ @xmath99 , in other words , when the particles have macroscopic sizes .     given by eq.([etha ] ) plotted as a function of @xmath91 , for @xmath14=0.1 ( solid line ) and 0.2 ( dashed line ) ( a ) , and as a function of @xmath100 for @xmath91=44 nm ( b ) .",

    ", title=\"fig:\",width=302][fig1b ]    the behavior of @xmath0 in eq.([etha ] ) is presented in fig.(1 ) .",
    "( 1a ) shows @xmath0 as a function of @xmath91 , for 20 nm @xmath101 100 nm , and @xmath102 nm .",
    "we notice that in this range of @xmath91 , @xmath103 .",
    "it is also interesting to look at the behavior of @xmath0 as a function of @xmath14 .",
    "( 1b ) shows @xmath0 as a function of @xmath14 , for @xmath104 , @xmath105 nm , and @xmath106 @xmath107 nm . from the curves in figs .",
    "( 1a ) and ( 1b ) , we find that for @xmath108 , @xmath0 turns out to be close to 0.55 , as numerically obtained by dalbuquerque e castro _ _ et al.__@xcite    it is worth commenting on the effect of using a single value of @xmath0 , say 0.55 , to scale phase diagrams for the core model considered just above .",
    "as already pointed out , the diagram for the full strength of the exchange interaction can be obtained from the one corresponding to a reduced interaction @xmath9 ( with @xmath8 ) by multiplying the axes @xmath109 and @xmath10 of the latter by @xmath13 .",
    "thus , an inaccuracy @xmath110 in the value of @xmath0 results in inaccuracies @xmath111 and @xmath112 in the coordinates in the scaled diagram . indeed , if we write @xmath113 , with @xmath114/@xmath115 , we immediately get@xmath116where @xmath117 .",
    "since @xmath118 and @xmath119 ( estimated from fig.(1a ) ) , we find that , even for @xmath14 as small as 0.05 , the relative error @xmath120 is smaller than 2  % .",
    "thus , we do not expect large discrepancies between the calculated phase diagram and the experimental data resulting from such inaccuracy in @xmath0 since a relative error of 2% should not exceed the experimental error .",
    "we remark that the above results for @xmath0 hold also when the core radius corresponds to several interatomic distances and is kept fixed as the exchange interaction is scaled up or down .",
    "we next consider the case in which @xmath121 is adjusted so as to minimize the energy of the vortex configuration ( second core model ) . from  eqs.and",

    "we remark that for the core model under consideration , @xmath124 does not depend on the radius @xmath125 .",
    "this follows from the fact that the outer region of the cylinder does not interact with the core ( apart from the exchange interaction across the interface between the two regions ) . as a consequence , for a given value of @xmath121 ,",
    "the difference between the total energy of two cylinders of the same height but different radii does not depend on @xmath126 , hence it does not contribute to the derivative of @xmath127 with respect to @xmath121 .",
    "that is to say , the equation for @xmath121 which minimizes the total energy of the vortex configuration is independent of @xmath125 .",

    "we have carried out a detailed analysis of scaling technique recently proposed by dalbuquerque e castro _ _ et al__@xcite to investigate the magnetic phase diagram of nanoparticles . as already pointed out",

    "the scaling technique is easily implemented and represents a rather useful tool for dealing with nanoparticle systems .",
    "in addition , the existence of scaling relations and their connection with the model adopted to describe the magnetic particles bring about interesting theoretical considerations .",
    "the present work sheds light on a very interesting feature of the scaling relations , namely the dependence of the exponent @xmath0 on the model adopted for describing the core of the vortex configuration .",
    "based on a continuous magnetization model , we were able to derive analytical expressions for the total energy in each configuration , which allowed us to determine the exponent @xmath0 .",
    "we found that in the case of nanoparticles for which the core dimensions , and consequently its contribution to the total energy , can be either neglected or do not change much upon scaling of @xmath87 , @xmath0 turns out to be weakly dependent on @xmath14 and quite close to 0.55 .",
    "nevertheless , when the contribution from the core is relevant and its size upon scaling of @xmath51 changes so as to minimize the total energy in the vortex configuration , then @xmath0 becomes exactly equal to 0.5 .",
