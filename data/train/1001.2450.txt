    "here we summarize our main results on our campaign on sax  j1818.61703 , obtained as a response of a _ swift _ cycle 5 gi trigger ; further details are in @xcite .",
    "we followed the evolution of the whole may 6 outburst of sax  j1818.61703 and its declining phase with _ swift_/xrt .",
    "the source displays a dynamical range of more than 3000 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , left ) and a multiple - flaring behaviour as also observed in other sfxts @xcite .",
    "temporally resolved spectroscopy of the xrt data did not reveal variability in the spectral parameters within the uncertainties , except for the change in the blackbody radius , when fitting the soft x ",
    "rays with a single absorbed blackbody .",
    "we also did not find variability in the absorbing column density during the outburst .",
    "we obtained , for the first time for this source , broad - band spectroscopy from soft to hard x  rays .",

    "swift_/xrt@xmath0bat joint spectrum during the outburst obtained from strictly simultaneous data ( only the blue xrt points in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] left were considered ) .",
    "the broad - band spectrum can be characterized by either a very high absorption , a flat power law ( @xmath10.10.5 ) with a cut - off at about 712 kev , or by comptonized emission from a cold and optically thick corona , with an electron temperature @xmath27kev , a hot seed photon temperature , @xmath31.4kev , and an optical depth for the comptonizing plasma @xmath4 .",
    "the inferred 1100kev luminosity is @xmath5 erg s@xmath6 ( at 2.5 kpc ; @xcite ) .",
    "these broad - band properties are reminiscent of the x  ray spectral shape of the prototype of the sfxt class , xte j1739302 @xcite : similarly high absorption , x  ray luminosities , energy cutoff values , and hot seed photon temperatures .",
    "these spectral parameters indicate the presence of a cold and optically thick corona .",
