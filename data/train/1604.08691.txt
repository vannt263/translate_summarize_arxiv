    "in fact , the graphlet orbit degree signature has been successfully used for protein function prediction  @xcite and cancer gene identification  @xcite by identifying groups ( or clusters ) of topologically similar nodes in biological networks .",
    "in addition to biological networks , graphlet orbit degree is also used for link prediction  @xcite and node classification  @xcite in online social networks , and hyponym relation extraction from wikipedia hyperlinks  @xcite .",
    "however , it is computationally intensive to enumerate and compute graphlet orbit degrees for large graphs due to the combinatorial explosion of the problem . to solve this challenge , approximate methods such as sampling",
    "could be used in place of the brute - force enumeration approach . despite recent progress in counting specific graphlets such as triangles  @xcite and 4-node motifs  @xcite that appear in a large graph ,",
    "little attention has been given to developing fast tools for computing graphlet orbit degrees .",
    "existing methods of estimating global graphlet counts are customized to sample all cises in a large graph , but not tailored to meet the need of sampling cises that include * a given node*.    to solve this problem , we propose a new method to estimate graphlet orbit degrees and to detect orbits with the largest graphlet orbit degrees for large graphs .",

    "\\2 ) based on the series of sampling methods , we design scalable and computationally efficient methods , sand and sand-3d , to estimate graphlet orbit degrees for undirected and directed graphs respectively , and we also derive expressions for the variances of our estimates , which is of great value in practice since the variances can be used to bound the estimates errors and determine the smallest necessary sampling budget for a desired accuracy .",
