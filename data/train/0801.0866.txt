    "table  [ tab : mc ] summarizes the cross - section of the simulated processes . at @xmath10",
    "gev the dominant background processes involve top quarks .",
    "they are simulated , as well as final states with two and three bosons .",
    "305 hhz events are expected for an estimated background three orders of magnitude above .",
    "the detector is simulated through a parametric monte carlo ,  @xcite in which the subdetectors are characterized by their acceptance angles , resolutions and energy thresholds .",
    "the intrinsic energy resolutions , @xmath11 , of the electromagnetic ( ecal ) and hadronic ( hcal ) calorimeters are respectively of 10.2% and 40.5% .",
    "the efficiency and @xmath12-jet contamination are parametrized according to the full reconstruction  @xcite . in this study ,",

    "the @xmath2-content of the event is obtained from an estimation of the number of the @xmath2-like jets in the event .",
    "the hhz final state is sorted into three channels that correspond to the three z decay modes @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 . in order to define the three samples representing these three channels ,",
    "a preselection is applied on the signal and the background events , based on the following criteria :    r0.5        * global @xmath2 content : only events with a minimal @xmath2-content are selected .",
    "the criteria value used to select hh@xmath18 events ( six jets topology ) is different from the one used to select hh@xmath19 or hh@xmath20 events ( four jets topology ) , * the visible energy is used to define two exclusive samples which correspond to hh@xmath19 events ( visible energy below @xmath21 ) and hh@xmath18 + @xmath22 events ( visible energy higher then @xmath21 ) , * the identification of two isolated leptons compatible with a z boson mass allows to separate hh@xmath20 from hh@xmath18 events .",
    "two variables are used to select the hhz final state : a neural network ( nn )  @xcite and the global event .",
    "three kinds of inputs are used to feed the nn :    * event shape variables as , for instance , charged multiplicity , sphericity or thrust values , * combinations of the different di - jet masses assuming a given final state , * global @xmath2-flavor content of the event .",
    "a neural network is designed for each of the hh@xmath18 , hh@xmath19 and hh@xmath20 final states .",
    "the neural networks are trained on large preselected samples of simulated events including all expected processes listed in section  [ sec : montecarlo ] .",
    "the output of the neural network for the hh@xmath19 selection is displayed on figure  [ fig : nnplot ] .    for each channel ,",
    "the cuts on nn and global are defined in order to maximize the figure of merit @xmath23 .",
    "the combination of the three selections leads to 128 events expected from the background processes considered and 72 events from hhz process corresponding to a @xmath24 value of 5.2 .    in order to extract the cross section of the hhz creation process",
    ", a likelihood maximization method is used .",
    "it is based on the two dimensional nn @xmath25 distribution .",
    "the expected precision on the cross - section measurement is 16% .",
    "therefore , the expected precision on is 28% .",
    "this result is obtained for a particle flow resolution of @xmath26 and a of 90% . a better working point for the efficiency",
    "may be found , as it will be shown in next section .",
    "two parameters have been investigated : the particle flow resolution and the . the full analysis described in section  [ sec : mesure ] has been performed and optimized for each hypothesis on the detector performance .",
    "the selection has been performed with different neural networks which combine the same input variables with adapted weights and re - optimized cuts .",
    "r0.5          the particle flow uncertainty influences the jet pairing ( based on di - jet masses ) and propagates to the energies and momenta of the reconstructed bosons and then to the selection inputs . then different efficiencies of the event selection are observed .",
    "a fast simulation is used in order to determine the impact of the particle flow resolution on @xmath27 .    for each event , the stable and visible particles ( i.e. all stable except neutrinos ) are considered with their generated energies and momenta with no detector simulation .",
    "they are clusterized in jets . a jet by jet smearing of the calorimeter cluster energies",
    "is then applied in order to simulate the combined effect of the detector resolution and the particle flow algorithms .",

    "the best measurement is @xmath36 when a perfect particle flow is assumed while for higher resolution on particle flow the precision increases to @xmath37 .",
    "the improvement of the particle flow enhances the precision on the trilinear coupling by a factor @xmath38 .",
    "this gain is equivalent to a factor @xmath39 on the required luminosity .",
