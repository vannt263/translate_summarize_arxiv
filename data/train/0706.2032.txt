    "heegaard floer homology was introduced by ozsvth and szab in @xcite .",
    "this theory contains a package of invariants for closed 3manifolds .",
    "a filtered version of these invariants , called knot floer homology , was defined by ozsvth  szab @xcite and rasmussen @xcite for null - homologous knots .",
    "this theory turns out to be very powerful .",
    "for example , it detects the thurston norm @xcite , and a result due to ghiggini @xcite and the author @xcite states that knot floer homology detects fibred knots .",
    "in fact , given a compact manifold with boundary , the information from knot floer homology tells you whether this manifold is fibred .",
    "( see the proof of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* corollary 1.2 ) . )",
    "now it is natural to ask whether a similar result can be proved for closed manifolds . in the current paper",
    ", we will answer this question affirmatively .",
    "our main theorem is :    [ closedfibre ] suppose @xmath1 is a closed irreducible @xmath0manifold , @xmath2 is a closed connected surface of genus @xmath3 .",

    "the converse of this theorem is already known , see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 5.2 ) .    when @xmath7 , there is no chance for @xmath4,0)$ ] to be @xmath8 ; some arguments in this paper also break down .",
    "nevertheless , it is reasonable to expect that heegaard floer homology still detects fibrations in the case of @xmath7 .",
    "as suggested by ozsvth and szab , in this case one may use some variants of heegaard floer homology , for instance , heegaard floer homology with twisted coefficients ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 8) or with coefficients in the novikov ring @xcite , @xcite .",
    "this paper is closely related to the previous works of ghiggini @xcite and of the author @xcite .",
    "we briefly recall the main ingredients in the proof of the case of knots from those two papers .",
    "there are three main ingredients :    ( i)the construction of two different taut foliations under certain conditions .",
    "this part is contained in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 6 ) and the proof uses an argument due to gabai @xcite .",
    "this part was also obtained by ian agol by a different method , and the genus 1 case was proved in @xcite .",
    "( ii)the existence of a taut foliation implies the nontriviality of the corresponding ozsvth ",
    "szab contact invariant .",
    "this part was almost proved by ozsvth and szab @xcite .",
    "but there are some technical restrictions in the cases established by ozsvth and szab .",
    "for example , one needs the condition @xmath9 or the use of twisted coefficients .",
    "the case that is used in @xcite was proved by ghiggini in @xcite .",
    "basically , he proved a result in contact topology , which , combined with some results of ozsvth and szab , implies the desired nontriviality theorem .",
    "( iii)two decomposition formulas for knot floer homology , one in the case of horizontal decomposition ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 4.1 ) , the other in the case of decomposition along a separating product annulus ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 5.1 ) .",
    "the second formula is essential and more technical .",
    "the proof of this part uses the techniques introduced in @xcite .",
    "now if ( i ) can be done , then ( ii ) implies that the two distinct taut foliations give rise to two linearly independent contact invariants in the topmost term of the heegaard floer homology , so the floer homology is not monic . if ( i ) can not be done , then the topology of the knot complement is very restricted .",
    "one can then use ( iii ) to reduce the general case to the known case .    as we will find in this paper , the above ingredients ( i ) and ( ii )",
    "can be applied to the case of closed manifolds without essential changes .",
    "however , we are not able to prove an analogue of ( * ? ? ? * theorem  5.1 ) for closed manifolds .",
    "instead , we will construct a knot @xmath10 in a new manifold @xmath11 , and show that the pair @xmath12 has monic knot floer homology by using twisted coefficients and a simple argument in homological algebra .",
    "then we can apply ( * ? ? ? * theorem 1.1 ) to get our conclusion .",
    "juhsz @xcite proved a very general decomposition formula for the floer homology of balanced sutured manifolds , based on the techniques introduced by sarkar and wang @xcite .",
    "in the case of knots , the above ingredients ( ii ) and ( iii ) can be deduced from this formula .",
    "this approach avoids the use of contact and symplectic topology , but it is not clear to the author how to use it to study closed manifolds .",
