    "the study of multiple production of particles at high energies has been a subject of intense theoretical and experimental interest .",
    "its importance lies in the fact that the multiplicity distributions of charged hadrons provide central information on the mechanism of production of the particles @xcite .",
    "existing models for particle production are usually based on qcd since the production of hadrons can , at the microscopic level , be associated with the copious creation of color partons through gluon radiation . however , this approach also contains a phenomenological component as the hadronization , the transition of the quark - gluon system to hadrons , involves a soft scale , and therefore purely perturbative techniques do not apply @xcite .",
    "the non - perturbative character of the qcd is also manifest in the elastic channel since at high energies the soft and the semihard components of the scattering amplitude are closely related @xcite .",
    "thus , in considering the forward scattering amplitude for elastic hadron - hadron collisions , it becomes important to distinguish between semihard gluons , which participate in hard parton - parton scattering , and soft gluons , emitted in any given parton - parton qcd radiation process .",
    "fortunately , our task of describing hadron - hadron observables in both elastic and inelastic channels , bringing up information about the infrared properties of qcd , can be properly addressed by considering the possibility that the non - perturbative dynamics of qcd generate an effective gluon mass .",
    "this dynamical gluon mass is intrinsically related to an infrared finite strong coupling constant , and its existence is strongly supported by recent qcd lattice simulations @xcite as well as by phenomenological results @xcite .",
    "more specifically , a global description of elastic and inelastic hadronic observables can succeed in a consistent way by introducing a non - perturbative qcd effective charge in the calculation of the gluon - gluon total cross section , which dominates at high energy and determines the asymptotic behavior of hadron - hadron cross sections , and by exploring the unitarity condition of the @xmath0-matrix in impact parameter space , which relates the elastic scattering amplitudes to the inelastic overlap function @xmath2 .    with this background in mind ,",
    "the main purpose of this paper is to explore the non - perturbative dynamics of qcd in order to describe in a connected way hadron - hadron observables in both elastic and inelastic channels , assuming the eikonal representation and the unitarity condition of the scattering matrix , and compare the results with the @xmath3 and @xmath4 experimental data of total and elastic differential cross sections , the parameter @xmath5 and the inclusive multiplicity distributions in full phase space .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in the next section we introduce a qcd - based eikonal model where the onset of the dominance of semihard gluons in the interaction of high - energy hadrons is managed by the dynamical gluon mass . motivated by the recent totem measurement of the @xmath3 total cross section , @xmath6 , at lhc , we perform a detailed analysis of @xmath3 and @xmath4 forward scattering data and elastic differential cross sections using our eikonal model , and obtain predictions for @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 at tevatron and cern - lhc energies .",
    "we evaluate the theoretical uncertainty associated with the dynamical mass scale and obtain predictions with uncertainty bands for @xmath7 and @xmath8 . in sec .",
    "iii we present the basic formalism , as well as the underlying physical picture , of multiplicity distributions associated with charged hadron production , and introduce the theoretical prescription for connecting the elastic and inelastic channels . with the parameters of the eikonal fixed from the elastic fit , we calculate the multiplicity distribution @xmath10 in @xmath3 and @xmath4 collisions over a large range of energies , and",
    "study the effect of the mass scale uncertainty on high multiplicities . in the sequence",
    "we calculate the @xmath1 moments of the multiplicity distributions at high energies , where we observe that our results reproduce the oscillatory behavior predict by qcd . in sec .",
    "iv we draw our conclusions .",
    "qcd - inspired models are at present one of the main theoretical approaches to explain the observed increase of hadron - hadron total cross sections @xcite . these models incorporate soft and semihard processes in the treatment of high - energy hadron - hadron interactions using a formulation compatible with analyticity and unitarity constraints . in the eikonal representation the total and inelastic cross sections are given by @xmath11 , \\label{eq01}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath12 , \\label{eq02}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] respectively , where @xmath13 is the square of the total center - of - mass energy , @xmath14 is the impact parameter , @xmath15 is the inelastic overlap function and @xmath16 is the eikonal function . in this picture",
    "the probability that neither hadron is broken up in a collision at impact parameter @xmath14 is therefore given by @xmath17 .",
    "the eikonal function can be written in terms of even and odd eikonal parts connected by crossing symmetry .",
    "thus , in the case of the proton - proton ( @xmath3 ) and antiproton - proton ( @xmath4 ) scatterings , this combination reads @xmath18 .    in the so called dynamical gluon mass model @xcite ( henceforth referred to as dgm model )",
    "the increase of the total cross sections is associated with semihard scatterings of partons in the hadrons , and the high - energy dependence of the cross sections is driven mainly by gluon - gluon scattering processes . in this qcd - inspired model",
    "the even eikonal is written as the sum of gluon - gluon , quark - gluon , and quark - quark contributions : @xmath19 , \\label{eq22}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath20 is the overlap density for the partons at impact parameter space @xmath14 and @xmath21 are the elementary subprocess cross sections of colliding quarks and gluons ( @xmath22 ) . the overlap density is associated with the fourier transform of a dipole form factor , @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the modified bessel function of second kind .",
    "the contributions @xmath25 and @xmath26 are parametrized with terms dictated by the regge phenomenology : @xmath27 @xmath28 \\ , w(b;\\mu_{qg}),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 are fitting parameters .",
    "the @xmath34 factor is defined as @xmath35 , where @xmath36 and @xmath37 are non - perturbative quantities which will be defined in the ensuing text . since the role of the odd eikonal @xmath38 is to account for the difference between @xmath3 and @xmath4 channels at low energies , it is simply written as @xmath39 , where @xmath40 and @xmath41 are constants to be fitted .",
    "the details concerning the analyticity properties of the model amplitudes are given in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the last term of the expression ( [ eq22 ] ) , the gluon contribution @xmath42 , deserves a more detailed comment : it gives the main contribution to the asymptotic behavior of hadron - hadron total cross sections ; its energy dependence comes from the gluon - gluon cross section @xmath43 where @xmath44 . here",
    "@xmath45(\\tau)=\\int_{\\tau}^{1 } \\frac{dx}{x}\\ , g(x)\\ , g\\left ( \\frac{\\tau}{x}\\right)$ ] is the convoluted structure function for pair gluon - gluon ( @xmath46 ) , @xmath47 is the total cross section for the subprocess @xmath48 , and @xmath49 is a free parameter .",
    "note that since @xmath50 the dominant contribution to the integration comes from the small-@xmath51 region .",
    "in addition , the dynamical gluon mass scale is a natural regulator for the infrared divergences associated with the gluon - gluon cross section . since in the model",
    "the small-@xmath51 semihard gluons play a central role , a phenomenological gluon distribution is introduced , namely @xmath52 , where @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "note that the gluon distribution reduces to @xmath55 in the limit @xmath56 , as expected by dimensional counting rules .",
    "the total cross section @xmath57 is given by @xcite @xmath58^{2 } }   -      3      \\ln      \\left (     \\frac{\\hat{s }      -    3m_{g}^{2}}{m_{g}^{2}}\\right ) \\right ] ; \\label{h6}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in the above expression @xmath36 and @xmath59 are the qcd effective charge and the dynamical gluon mass , respectively , obtained ( through the use of the pinch technique ) as solutions of the schwinger - dyson equations for the gluon propagator and the triple gluon vertex @xcite .",
    "these non - perturbative effective quantities are given by @xmath60 } ,   \\label{eq11}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath61^{- 12/11 } , \\label{mdyna } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath62(@xmath63 ) is the qcd scale parameter , @xmath64 ( @xmath65 is the number of flavors ) , and @xmath37 is an infrared mass scale to be adjusted in order to provide reliable results concerning calculations of strongly interacting processes . as mentioned in the earlier section , the existence of a gluon mass scale is strongly supported by qcd lattice simulations @xcite , and its value is typically found to be of the order @xmath66 mev @xcite .",
    "it is worth noting that in all these phenomenological studies the mass scale @xmath37 is used as an input parameter .",
    "however , it was recently obtained , for the first time , a value for the mass scale @xmath37 from the analysis of the proton structure function @xmath67 at small-@xmath51 @xcite . in that work",
    "the hera data on @xmath68 is interpreted in terms of the generalized double - asymptotic - scaling approximation with a qcd effective charge , and at leading order ( lo ) the value @xmath69 mev arises naturally from the analysis .",
    "this 90% confidence level uncertainty result , obtained from a global fit to @xmath67 data sets through a @xmath70 fitting procedure , sets up the stage for making an assessment of the mass scale uncertainty for the hadron - hadron observable to be calculated , as discussed in what follows .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     the theoretical prediction to @xmath10 at lhc energies can be computed by fitting the energy behavior of @xmath71 through an appropriate function @xmath72 .",
    "as can be seen from the figure 2 , the parameter increases rapidly with @xmath13 , being its energy dependence described in a consistent way through the use of the function @xmath73 where @xmath74=0.189 , @xmath14=0.00197 and @xmath75=1.536 ; these values were obtained by a @xmath70 analysis . from the curve depicted in fig .",
    "2 it is possible to extract the values of @xmath71 at 7 and 14 tev shown in the table ii . in the same way , the values of the hadronic average multiplicity at lhc energies can be estimated using the equation introduced by troshin and tyurin @xcite @xmath76 which is in very good agreement with experimental data .",
    "the results of the fits to @xmath10 data are displayed in figs .",
    "3 and 4 , together with the experimental data . in figure 4 the hatched areas",
    "correspond to the uncertainties in the predictions due to the gluon mass error .",
    "notice that , since at isr energies gluon - gluon processes are not dominant , the widths of uncertainties bands in figure 3 are very narrow . in figure 5",
    "we show the theoretical predictions for the full - phase - space multiplicity distribution at @xmath77 and 14 tev , together with data , from cms , on fully corrected charged hadron multiplicity spectrum for @xmath78 , 1.0 , 1.5 , 2.0 and 2.4 at @xmath77 tev @xcite .",
    "information about multi - particle correlations can be extracted directly from the shape of the multiplicity distribution @xmath10 .",
    "as first indicated in the section iii , independent production of the particles in the final state leads to a poissonian multiplicity distribution .",
    "however , deviations from this poisson shape reveal correlations among the produced particles and unveil many details about the underlying dynamics .    the shape of a distribution can be analyzed by studying its moments . in the case of the multiplicity distribution @xmath10 , its factorial moments @xmath79 as well as its cumulant factorial moments @xmath80 are powerful tools to investigate multiplicity fluctuations @xcite",
    "the normalized factorial moment of rank @xmath81 is defined by @xmath82 where @xmath83 is the average multiplicity and @xmath81 is the rank of the moment .",
    "thus @xmath79 , that reflects correlations among up to @xmath81 produced particles , is sensitive to the tail of the distribution , i.e. to large @xmath84 values . for independent production of particles",
    "the moment @xmath79 is equal to unity for all rank @xmath81 . on the other hand ,",
    "if the produced particles are correlated ( anti - correlated ) , the distribution is broader ( narrower ) than the poisson one , and , as a consequence , @xmath79 is greater ( less ) than unity .",
    "the normalized factorial cumulants @xmath80 , obtained from the recursive relation @xmath85 with @xmath86 , measure genuine @xmath81-particle correlations , more specifically correlations of rank @xmath81 which are not a consequence of lower - order correlation functions .",
    "it is observed that the factorial and cumulant moments increase rapidly with @xmath81 and , therefore , the ratio @xcite @xmath87 turns out to be a convenient quantity to work with since it have a flatter behavior with @xmath81 over a large range .",
    "moreover , higher - order qcd calculations predict that the cumulant and @xmath1 moments oscillate as a function of @xmath81 @xcite .",
    "these predictions have been fully confirmed by high - energy scattering experiments in @xmath88 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 , hadron - nucleus and nucleus - nucleus collisions @xcite .",
    "namely , qcd results are concerned with partons , not with hadrons .",
    "in fact , the @xmath1 moments of _ parton _ multiplicity distributions are predicted to oscillate .",
    "however , @xmath1 moments of experimental data on _ hadron _ multiplicity distributions exhibit the same oscillatory behavior .",
    "this experimental observation strongly suggests the validity of the local parton hadron duality ( lphd ) hypothesis @xcite , which asserts that parton multiplicity distributions , calculated using perturbative qcd , must be related to the hadronic distributions , implying that the hadronization phase transition does not affect in an essential way the observed final - state hadron distributions .    we have analyzed the @xmath1 moments over a large range of the rank @xmath81 .",
    "first , the theoretical values of @xmath10 are obtained from the eqs .",
    "( [ distrib03])-([xi002 ] ) . then the @xmath79 , @xmath80 and @xmath1 moments are determined from both the theoretical and the experimental values of @xmath10 according to eqs .",
    "( [ fatorial])-([hq ] ) .",
    "the results are displayed in figs .",
    "our prediction for the @xmath1 moment at the lhc energy @xmath89 tev is presented in fig .",
    "all these results are in good agreement with the experimental points up to @xmath81=16 , i.e. , are reliable even on the tail of the distribution .",
    "in this paper we have explored the unitarity condition of the @xmath0-matrix in impact parameter space to describe , in a connected way , hadron - hadron observables in both elastic and inelastic channels . in the elastic channel",
    "we have performed a global fit to the @xmath3 and @xmath4 forward quantities @xmath90 and @xmath5 , including in the dataset the @xmath4 differential cross section at @xmath91 gev and @xmath92 tev as well as the new totem datum on @xmath6 at @xmath77 tev .",
    "the analysis was carried out using the dgm eikonal model , where non - perturbative effects are naturally included via a qcd effective charge dependent on the dynamical gluon mass . with the dynamical gluon mass set at @xmath93 mev ,",
    "the dgm model allows us to describe successfully all experimental data .",
    "namely , the @xmath94 for the global fit was 0.98 for 320 degrees of freedom .",
    "this good statistical result shows that the dgm model is well suited for detailed predictions of the forward quantities to be measured at higher energies . in particular , for the total cross sections to be measured at cern - lhc energies ,",
    "the model predicts the values @xmath95 mb , @xmath96 mb and @xmath97 mb , at @xmath77 , 8 and 14 tev , respectively .",
    "the uncertainty in these total cross sections have been estimated by varying the gluon mass scale within error while keeping all other model parameters constant .",
    "note that this procedure does not determines the _ formal _ uncertainty in the @xmath90 prediction , since the variance - covariance matrix method , necessary for proving this quantity , was not employed .",
    "however , at high energies the total cross sections are dominated by gluon - gluon interactions represented by the eikonal term @xmath98 , containing only 2 free parameters ( @xmath49 and @xmath99 ) .",
    "it is seen from our @xmath70 analysis that the correlation coefficients of these parameters are small .",
    "moreover , the values of the total cross sections are actually more sensitive to the gluon mass scale than to variations of others parameters of the model . hence , despite the simplicity of the procedure , it clearly provides a good estimate of the full systematic uncertainty in @xmath90 .    in order to compute multiplicity distributions in @xmath3 and @xmath4 collisions",
    "we have adopted the string approach , which enables linkage between the elastic and inelastic channels .",
    "this phenomenological approach asserts that @xmath10 in full phase space can be constructed by summing contributions from parton - parton collisions , occurring at @xmath14 and @xmath13 .",
    "these collisions give rise to the formation of strings and its subsequent fragmentation into hadrons .",
    "more specifically , the semihard partons produced at the interaction point fly away from each other yielding a color string which breaks up producing the observed hadrons , a process well described by the conventional lund model @xcite .",
    "thus in this picture the multiplicity distribution @xmath10 can be constructed in terms of the eikonal @xmath100 , which contains the gluon semihard contribution @xmath98 , and of the parameters @xmath101 and @xmath71 , characterizing the dimensionless length of string - like objects and the _ strength _ of the kno scaling violation , respectively .",
    "in fact , the parameter @xmath71 is approximately constant at isr energies , increasing rapidly with @xmath13 from isr to lhc energies : this behavior is consistent with kno scaling hypothesis at @xmath102 gev and it s violation at higher energies .",
    "we call attention in particular to the fact that the multiplicity distribution data are fitted adequately using only one free parameter , since the @xmath101 as well as the elastic parameters are all fixed .",
    "we point out that the bumpy structure in @xmath103 data at higher energies , which appears in the region of low multiplicities , can be described by our model by means of a moment analysis which separates the semihard and soft components of the multiplicity distributions . in this analysis",
    "the bumpy structure is reproduced after an appropriate convolution of the soft and the semihard components of the eikonal . however , at least one more free parameter is needed . since our approach aims to achieve a description of the data relying on the smallest number of parameters possible , the description of the bumpy structure is out of the scope of this work .",
    "concerning the moments and cumulants , we see that our approach describes very well the energy dependence of the @xmath104-moments , and reproduce the @xmath1 versus @xmath81 oscillations observed in the experimental data .",
    "more importantly , we observe that the semihard portion of the eikonal is in fact the responsible for the @xmath1 oscillations since it gives the main contribution to high multiplicities , as qualitatively predicted by qcd .",
    "it is worth noting that the unitarity condition of the @xmath0-matrix can be also associated with low-@xmath51 saturation effects of @xmath105 , the @xmath14-dependent integrated gluon distribution @xcite .",
    "these saturation effects appears in a functional integral approach to high - energy scattering in the eikonal representation , and the @xmath0-matrix unitarity is preserved as the result of a matrix cumulant expansion and the gaussian approximation of the functional integrals . in this non - perturbative approach",
    "an _ effective _ gluon mass is introduced , indicating that the underlying physics is similar to that of the dgm model .",
    "it corroborates the idea that the non - perturbative dynamics of qcd generate an effective gluon mass at very low @xmath106 region .",
