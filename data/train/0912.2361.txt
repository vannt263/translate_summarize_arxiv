    "there is no other explicit dependence on @xmath87 in the action .",
    "in fact , if we put @xmath108 it is easy to realize that the old coupling constant @xmath87 has been already replaced by @xmath93 in the free action of eq .",
    "( [ szeroafterrescaling ] ) and in the interaction term of eq .",

    "course we have to remember that , after the time rescaling of eq .",

    "( [ doppioquadrato ] ) and ( [ triploquadrato])([triplocerchio ] ) , the only left dependence on @xmath87 is in the rescaled time @xmath122 contained in the current term . in the limit @xmath41 , of course , @xmath123 , i. e. : @xmath124 since by definition @xmath125 , where @xmath45 is the partition function of eq .",
    "( [ sfhsdjfh ] ) , we have shown that @xmath45 does not depend on the value of the parameter @xmath87 .",
    "this concludes our proof .",
    "in order to proceed , we treat the @xmath70 fields in a mean field theory approximation , i.  e. assuming that the density of these fields exhibits only little deviations from the average value . exploiting the fact that only the correlator @xmath126 is different from zero , where @xmath127 , it is easy to check that the mean field effective action is given by : @xmath128 with @xmath129 \\label{s0deltamft}\\ ] ] and @xmath130\\label{cutreg}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the presence of the dirac delta function in the last term requires the computation of the propagator @xmath131 at coinciding points @xmath132 . since @xmath133 is divergent when @xmath134 , we regularize this singularity using the dimensional regularization .",
    "after a few computations one finds : @xmath135 where @xmath136 is the gamma function . in the case @xmath137 in which the scalar field @xmath1 becomes massless , @xmath133 vanishes identically , so that the introduction of counterterms is not necessary . for @xmath138 and odd dimensions , the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ counterterm ] ) does not vanish , but it is regular and once again no counterterms are needed .",
    "singularities appear only when the scalar field is massive and the number of dimensions is odd .",
    "for instance , if @xmath139 , we obtain from eq .",
    "( [ counterterm ] ) : @xmath140 this singularity gives rise in the action @xmath141 to the term @xmath142 that can be reabsorbed by adding a suitable mass conterterm for the fields @xmath13 in the free action @xmath143 .",
    "in this letter we have considered a class of massive scalar field theories with potentials of the kind given in eq .",
    "( [ vecpotfouref ] ) .",
    "it has been shown that these theories , which appear to be intractable with the usual techniques , see for instance the potential in eq .",
    "( [ exaone ] ) , can be casted in a form that resembles that of a standard field theory . indeed , the partition function defined in eqs .",
    "( [ sfhsdjfh][fsdfsdfsdf ] ) is that of an usual complex scalar field theory coupled to the vector fields @xmath70 .",
    "we have treated here only the partition function of the scalar fields @xmath1 , but it is not difficult to extend our result also to their generating functional .",
    "the only difference is that in this case one should add to the current @xmath59 of eq .",
    "( [ extcurr ] ) also the external current of the fields @xmath1 .",
    "of course , given the complexity of the original field theories discussed here , one can not expect that they become exactly solvable after the mapping explained in section ii . however , if the potential @xmath0 is small , for instance because it is multiplied by an overall small constant @xmath144 , then perturbation theory may be attempted .",
    "in fact , the fourier transform @xmath145 of that potential , which is small too , is only present in the current @xmath146 , see eq .",
    "( [ curcho ] ) . for this reason , the terms of @xmath147th order in the perturbative expansion in the coupling constant @xmath144 simply coincides with the power @xmath148 of the currents @xmath149 in the series of eq .",
    "( [ expansion ] ) .",
    "this perturbative strategy was clearly not possible in the starting partition function of the scalar fields of eq .",
    "( [ partfun ] ) , because in the potential @xmath0 contains in the most general case an infinite number of powers of @xmath1 , see the example of eq .",
    "( [ exaone ] ) . in a similar way , for large values of the coupling constant , one may use a strong coupling expansion , as explained for instance in refs .",
    "one should instead resist the temptation of using as a perturbative parameter the fictitious coupling constant @xmath87 which is present in the action @xmath76 .",
    "as mentioned in the previous section , in fact , this parameter disappears from the theory after performing the limit @xmath82 .",
    "this is understandable , because @xmath87 was not the original scalar field theory .",
    "we have also explored a nonperturbative approach , in which the original scalar fields are integrated out exactly and a mean field approach is applied to the resulting vector fields @xmath70 . in doing that , one finds that the theory is affected by singularities which are cured using the dimensional regularization .",
    "the form of the counterterm which is necessary to absorb these singularities has been computed .",
    "let us note that this counterterm does not exhaust all the renormalizability issues of the theory expressed by the action @xmath150 given by eqs .",
    "( [ effactmft][cutreg ] ) .",
    "first of all , there are still divergences that may come from the interactions of the fields @xmath13 .",
    "moreover , there are also the singularities connected with the presence of the potential @xmath0 .",
    "these divergences are apparently hidden due to the fact that , thanks to the methods of section ii , it has been possible to confine to the current @xmath151 of eq .",
    "( [ curcho ] ) all the dependencies on the potential .",
    "this does not mean however that this interaction has now become harmless . to convince oneself that this is not the case , it is sufficient to give a glance to at the expansion of the partition function @xmath45 given in eq .",
    "( [ expansion ] ) .",
    "there , the convergence of the integrations over the variables @xmath152 strongly depends on the form of the potential @xmath145 that appears inside the currents @xmath153 .",
    "it is impossible to formulate a renormalization theory like that of usual field theories with polynomial interactions in the case of general @xmath4dimensional models such as those discussed in this work .",
    "for this reason , in the future it will be necessary to identify particular examples of potentials that are physically relevant and to investigate renormalization issues in those special cases .",
    "in this appendix we shot that the inverse determinant @xmath154=\\int{\\cal d}\\psi^*{\\cal d}\\psi\\exp\\left\\ { -i\\int dbdtd^dx\\left [ i\\psi^*\\frac{\\partial\\psi}{\\partial t}-g|(\\nabla+ib\\nabla\\phi)\\psi|^2 \\right ] \\right\\ } \\label{detdef}\\ ] ] is trivial . to this purpose ,",
