    "cosmological hydrodynamic simulations have strongly suggested that most of the previously  missing `` baryons may be in a gaseous phase in the temperature range @xmath11k and at moderate overdensity ( cen & ostriker 1999 , hereafter ' ' co \" ; dav 2001 ) , called the warm - hot intergalactic medium ( whim ) , with the primary heating process being hydrodynamic shocks from the formation of large - scale structure at scales currently becoming nonlinear .",
    "the reality of the whim has now been quite convincingly confirmed by a number of observations from hst , fuse , chandra and xmm - newton ( tripp , savage , & jenkins 2000 ; tripp & savage 2000 ; oegerle et al .",

    "in addition to shock heating , feedback processes following star formation in galaxies can heat gas to the same whim temperature range .",
    "what is lacking theoretically is a satisfactory understanding of the known feedback processes on the whim and how the whim may be used to understand and calibrate the feedback processes .",
    "another unsettled issue is how the predicted results will change if one has a more accurate , non - equilibrium calculation of the major metal species , such as o vi , o vii and o viii , since time scales for ionization and recombination are not widely separated from the hubble time scale . in a companion paper ( cen & ostriker 2005 )",
    "we have studied the effects of galactic superwinds on the igm , and in particular on whim .",
    "additional improvements include significantly larger dynamic ranges of the simulation , a wmap normalized cosmological model and an improved radiative transfer treatment .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to present additional effects due to non - equilibrium calculations on major observable metal species , such as o vi , o vii and o viii .",

    "the outline of this paper is as follows : the simulation details are given in  2 ; in  3 we give detailed results and discussion and conclusions are presented in  4 .",
    "the reader should refer to cen & ostriker ( 2005 ) for a detailed description of the computation method . here",
    "we will only briefly explain the basic hydrodynamic code , explain the cosmological model that we use , the simulation box parameters and relevant treatment details on how major oxygen species are computed .",
    "the results reported on here are based on new simulations of a _ wmap_-normalized ( spergel et al .  2003 ; tegmark et al .",
    "2004 ) cold dark matter model with a cosmological constant , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "the adopted box size is @xmath18mpc / h comoving and with a number of cells of @xmath19 , the cell size is @xmath20kpc / h comoving , with dark matter particle mass equal to @xmath21 . given a lower bound of the temperature for almost all the gas in the simulation ( @xmath22  k ) , the jeans mass @xmath23 for mean density gas , which is comfortably larger than our mass resolution .",
    "as described in cen & ostriker ( 2005 ) , we have made simulations with and without galactic superwinds ( gsw ) .",
    "metals are produced self - consistently from star formation by adopting a specific efficiency of metal formation , a  yield \" ( arnett 1996 ) , @xmath24 , the percentage of stellar mass that is ejected back into igm as metals for type ii supernovae ( sne ii ) , which we follow accurately in the simulation .",
    "on the other hand , accurately following the evolution of metal ejection ( approximately half of the iron ) from type i supernovae ( sne i ) is difficult in large part due to the uncertainties in theoretical modeling of sne i. since oxygen is predominantly produced by sne ii , our results on oxygen related quantities are very insensitive to the lack of treatment of sne i. metals produced by sne ii are followed as a separate variable ( analogous to the total gas density ) with the same hydrocode . in addition , we implement another density variable to keep track of the reprocessed , i.e. , secondary metals in the ejecta ( such as s process elements ) , which is proportional to the metallicity of the gas from which the star was formed .",
    "there are two adjustable parameters with regard to overall metal production , namely , @xmath25 from sne ii and @xmath26 from sne i in terms of metal contribution .",
    "these two parameters are uncertain theoretically but may be normalized by observed oxygen and iron abundances in icm .",
    "the oxygen and iron abundance is @xmath27 and @xmath28 solar in the icm of observed clusters ( e.g. , mushotzky et al .",
    "1996 ; tamura et al .",
    "2004 ) and there is indication that there is about an equal amount of contribution to the iron mass in icm from sne ia and sne ii ( e.g. , ettori 2005 ) . following tsujimoto et al .",
    "( 1995 ) , using metal yield patterns for sne ia and sne ii with salpeter imf , we find that in order to match the observed iron metallicity of @xmath28 solar in icm , we need a sne ii metal yield @xmath29 instead of the value @xmath30 adopted , taking into account that one half of the iron in icm would have been contributed by sne ia .",
    "however , this still leaves us with an oxygen abundance in the computed icm of @xmath31 solar ( using @xmath29 ) versus the observed value of @xmath27 solar ( mushotzky et al .",
    "1996 ; tamura et al .",
    "this deficit in oxygen mass in icm can not be made up by sne ia in any reasonable abundance , because they do not produce a significant amount of oxygen mass .",
    "we do not yet know the actual solution to this problem .",
    "possible solutions may include an imf that is significant flatter than the adopted salpeter imf , which would produce more sne ii and more hypernovae , which are prime producers of oxygen .",
    "alternatively , one may increase the star formation efficiency by some factor , say , @xmath32 , to bring oxygen abundance into better agreement with observations , which would then require some adjustment on the contribution to iron mass in icm from sne ia .",
    "this is a very complex issue and there may be hints that a simple combination of sne ii and sne ia with the standard imf may not be adequate ( e.g. , dupke & white 2000 ; portinari et al .",
    "2004 ; baumgartner et al .",
    "2005 ) , and it is beyond the scope of this paper to attempt to address this issue .",
    "what we must do , however , is to normalize the simulated abundances of both iron and oxygen to the observed values in icm as closely as we can .",
    "this requirement translates to an enhancement of oxygen abundance by a factor of @xmath33 , where the factor @xmath34 is needed to normalize to icm iron abundance ( see figure 15 below ) and the factor @xmath35 is to further normalize to icm oxygen abundance ; we stress again that the underlying cause for the factor @xmath35 is unclear at present . aside from this unknown scaling factor",
    ", oxygen is known to be predominantly produced by sne ii and hence the computed spatial and temporal evolution of oxygen distribution should remain accurate ; we simply multiply the oxygen abundance at every spatial point in the simulation by a factor of @xmath36 .",
    "once this re - normalization procedure is done , we have no further freedom to make any other adjustment with regard to metallicity , specifically , oxygen abundances , in any other regions of the igm , which are the focus of this study .",
    "we have adopted a solar oxygen abundance of @xmath37 dex , which is close to but about 20% higher than recently determined values ( allende prieto , lambert , & asplund 2001 ; asplund et al .  2004 ) .",
    "the implementation of the major oxygen species is done as follows .",
    "we follow the evolution of o iv to o ix simultaneously by directly integrating five rate equations for each cell in a non - equilibrium fashion .",
    "each oxygen species is followed as a separate variable and each conservation equation ( without the source terms ) is solved using the same tvd hydrodynamics code , taking into account recombination ( shull & van steenberg 1982 ) , collisional ionization ( aldrovandi & pequignot 1973 ; shull & van steenberg 1982 ; arnaud & rothenflug 1985 ; arnaud & raymond 1992 ; verner & ferland 1996 ; voronov 1997 ) and photoionization ( clark , cowan , & bobrowicz 1986 ; verner et al .",
    "1996 ) processes for a non - uniform cosmological density field .",
    "relevant coefficients for these processes and equations are enclosed in the appendix for completeness .",
    "we present and compare simulations with and without galactic superwinds ( gsw ; cen & ostriker 2005 ) and between calculations that assume ionization - equilibrium and detailed non - equilibrium calculations .",
    "we present detailed results on major absorption lines , including o vi ( @xmath381032 , 1038 ) , o vii ( @xmath3921.6 ) and o viii ( @xmath3919.0 ) .",
    "the detailed evolution of all these major metal species is followed in a non - equilibrium fashion , by solving rate equations for each cell at each timestep explicitly .",
    "the evolution also depends on the detailed background radiation field as a function of redshift , which we compute in a self - consistent way in our simulations taking into account both sources and sink computed directly in simulations , shown in figure 1 .",
    "all our results presented below are at @xmath40 and hence the z=0 radiation field is used when we compute metal abundances for some species based on cloudy ( equilibrium ) method .",
    "we note that the computed @xmath41 radiation field is consistent with observations ( shull et al .",
    "1999 ) and so is the radiation field at higher redshifts ( rauch et al .  1997 ;",
    "bolton et al .",
    "2005 ) and with observationally derived evolution of the background radiation field ( haardt & madau 1999 ) .",
    "figure 2 shows the number of o vi absorption lines per unit redshift as a function of equivalent width from simulations with and without gsw , from the case based on the simulation using cloudy program based on the simulation with gsw , all compared to observations ( symbols ) .",
    "first , we note that the simulation with appropriate gsw and non - equilibrium calculation ( solid curve ) is in excellent agreement with direct observations ( symbols ) .",
    "this is quite remarkable considering that we have not attempted to make any fine - tuning on model parameters and the only two major parameters that have significant effects are @xmath42 and @xmath43 , where the latter is normalized to observed x - ray cluster gas abundance and the former is chosen to match the observed galactic superwinds ( e.g. , pettini et al .",
    "in other words , our model is basically free of adjustable parameters other than overall yield and @xmath42 and it is fair to say that the excellent agreement between our calculation and observations is a strong indication that our cosmological model is a faithful representation of the true universe in this regard .",
    "however , the excellent agreement would not have been found , had the gsw effect not been included ( dotted curve ) or if we had adopted the equilibrium ( cloudy ) treatment is performed ( dashed curve ) .",
    "both gsw feedback and non - equilibrium method produce significant errors for abundances of low equivalent widths absorption lines ( @xmath44 ) .",
    "fortuitously , one may obtain an apparently reasonable agreement between theoretical calculations and observations if both errors in modeling are simultaneously made , i.e. , an equilibrium cloudy treatment on a simulation with no significant gsw feedback ; this is a mere coincidence .",
    "the physical reason why the equilibrium treatment produced more o vi than non - equilibrium simulation is that collisional ionization time scales are longer than the time scale on which gas is shock heated , especially for low density regions ; for the very high density regions , the two approaches should agree , as figure 2 indicates .",
    "results obtained here are broadly consistent with with earlier simulations ( cen et al .",
    "2001 ; fang & bryan 2001 ; chen et al .  2003 ) and with analytic work ( furlanetto et al .",
    "2005b ) with regard to o vi absorption line abundance , taking into account various uncertainties about cosmological model parameters , different treatments of metallicity and assumptions about ionization equilibrium .",
    "figure 3 shows the number of o vii absorption lines per unit redshift as a function of equivalent width from simulations with ( solid curve ) and without ( dotted curve ) gsw .",
    "also included as a dashed curve is what one would obtain using cloudy program based on the simulation with gsw .",
    "somewhat different from the case for o vi , we see here that the feedback and non - equilibrium effects each produce a @xmath45 change in the opposite direction in the predicted number of o vii absorption lines for the entire range of width .",
    "figure 4 is similar to figure 3 but for o viii absorption lines and comparable effects due to gsw and equilibrium treatment are seen . in both cases for o vii and o viii absorption lines",
    "the agreement between observations and our detailed non - equilibrium calculations with gsw are not as good as that for the o vi absorption line see in figure 2",
    ". however , the observational errorbars for the abundances of these two absorption lines are currently very large due to a very small observational sample . the physical reason behind the results that the equilibrium treatment produced more o vii and o viii than non - equilibrium simulation is similar to that given for the case of o vi , except that the collisional ionization time scales are still longer in the case of o vii and o viii and the times scales on which gas is shock heated are still shorter than for o vi . as figure 2 indicates .",
    "it will be of great importance to enlarge observational samples for both o vii and o viii absorption lines to make more statistically sound comparisons .",
    "since our model has no adjustable parameters except yield and @xmath42 , the outcome from such comparisons will provide critical tests of yield , @xmath42 and the underlying cosmological model .    to summarize the relative abundances of these major species , figure 5 displays results for all three absorption lines in terms of equivalent widths in units of @xmath46 to indicate the relative abundances of the three major species .",
    "the conversion between ew in m  and ew in km / s is : @xmath47 , which is equal to @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath50 , for o vi , o vii and o viii , respectively .",
    "the expected abundances for these three lines are in the range @xmath3 per unit redshift at @xmath4km / s decreasing to @xmath5 per unit redshift at @xmath6km / s ; the rate of decrease of the line abundance at higher @xmath51 then becomes significantly higher .",
    "the number of o vi absorption lines with @xmath7km / s is very small , while there are about @xmath8 lines per unit redshift for o vii and o viii absorption lines at @xmath9km / s .",
    "the computed o vii and o viii absorption line abundances are in reasonable agreement with chen et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , in particular , for their  scatter \" metallicity model ( dashed curve in figure 7 of chen et al .",
    "2003 ) , considering large uncertainties on metallicity distribution and ionization equilibrium assumption .",
    "figure 6 shows the average metallicity ( with scatter ) of o vi , o vi and o viii absorption lines as a function of equivalent widths .",
    "we see two clear trends , albeit with significant scatter : ( 1 ) at low ew on average o vi absorption lines have lowest metallicity , while o viii absorption lines have highest metallicity .",
    "( 2 ) for each absorption line higher ew lines have higher metallicity .",
    "overall , on average , o vi lines have a metallicity range of @xmath52 with a large scatter at the low end .",
    "the o vii absorption lines have a mean metallicity range @xmath53 with a somewhat larger scatter at the low end than the o vi line . the o viii absorption lines , quite interestingly , display a nearly constant mean metallicity of @xmath54 over the entire ew range .",
    "all three absorption lines converge to a mean metallicity of @xmath55 at the high ew end with a scatter of about @xmath56 . these figures , ( 19)-(24 ) , present one of the two primary observational predictions of this paper .",
    "figure 7 shows the doppler width @xmath57 as a function of equivalent width @xmath51 for o vi , o vii and o viii , from top to bottom panel .",
    "we see that the doppler widths for the three species all have a concentration broadly in the range of @xmath58  km / s at the low @xmath51 end .",
    "this suggests that peculiar velocity effect plays a very important role here .",
    "it should be noted that peculiar velocities affects widths in complex ways , either broadening or narrowing , depending on detailed velocity and shock structures . in some cases ,",
    "hubble expansion could counter the effect of peculiar velocities of enclosing double shocks .",
    "most of the very low @xmath57 structures are likely photo - ionized and overall velocity broadening effect is minimal . on the high @xmath51 end ,",
    "the trend is somewhat more clear .",
    "there , values of @xmath57 of o vi , o vii and o viii appear to increase more or less monotonically in that order .",
    "this is due to the fact that higher ionization species are closer to center of potential wells , thus have , on average , higher temperatures and velocities .",
    "finally , figures 8,9,10 show in detail three randomly chosen lines of sight through the simulation boxes that have significant absorption features .",
    "noticeable features in these figures are : ( 1 ) gsw in most cases tend to broaden the absorption line profiles .",
    "( 2 ) gsw may alter absorption profile in complex ways as clearly seen in the bottom two panels of figure 8 for o vii and o viii lines , caused by a combination of separate effects on the gas velocity , temperature , metallicity and density .",
    "( 3 ) the typical gas density of the absorption features seen is in the range of @xmath59 times the mean gas density .",
    "( 4 ) the typical metallicity of gas producing the prominent uv absorption lines is in the range @xmath60 .",
    "( 5 ) the significant absorption features are usually enclosed by double shocks with velocity in the range @xmath61km / s , i.e. , we are seeing the outer edges of a cooling ",
    "zeldovich pancake \" .",
    "in fact , such pattern has been detected in a cluster of multiphase absorbers along the sightline toward pks  2155 - 304 ( shull al .",
    "we note that multiphase medium , while common , most often does not spatially co - exist ; rather , complex velocity , density , and metallicity structure mask their appearances when observed in hubble space .",
    "( 6 ) the doppler line widths for deep lines have @xmath62km / s , while for more abundant small lines the widths are small , in the range of @xmath63km / s .",
    "( 7 ) the relative absorption strengths of the three considered lines vary and no particular order is visible , as expected , since the line strengths are functions of several physical variables .",
    "more detailed studies will be defered to a subsequent paper .      in order to map out directly the whim structure in 3 dimensions ,",
    "detailed emission measurements are invaluable , because of their potential for continuous coverage and a lack of a dependence on the sparsely distributed background sources as required for absorption studies .",
    "we will focus on three metal emission lines , o vi , o vii and o viii as well as the ly@xmath2 emission line .",
    "emission tables were generated using a software package called chianti ( http://wwwsolar.nrl.navy.mil/chianti.html ) , based on electron density and density of a specific metal species .",
    "figure 11 shows the cumulative number of o vi and ly@xmath2 lines in uv per unit redshift as a function of surface brightness .",
    "the red curves show results from the simulation with gsw and the green curve from the simulation without gsw .",
    "the black curve ( for o vi line only ) is computed using cloudy code on the assumption of ionization equilibrium based on the density , temperature and metallicity information from the simulation with gsw .",
    "the results found with regard to ly@xmath2 emission may be compared to figure 8 of furlanetto et al .",
    "( 2005a ) .",
    "their figure has a different units for the ordinate , while the abscissa has the same units . in order to convert the values of the ordinates in their figure 8 to @xmath64 displayed here",
    ", we need to multiply their value in the vertical axis by @xmath65 , where @xmath66mpc is their pixel depth and @xmath67mpc is the length per unit redshift at @xmath41 .",
    "good agreements are found between their results and ours .",
    "for example ,",
    "at surface brightness of @xmath68 photons  @xmath69  s@xmath70  sr@xmath70 , we find @xmath71 ( thin solid curve in figure 11 ) , while their values range from @xmath72 ( panel b of their figure 8) to @xmath73 ( panels a and c of their figure 8) .",
    "also , we may compare the results found with regard to o vi emission to figure 9 of furlanetto et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , which shows the pdf ( defined as @xmath74 for @xmath75 ) of o vi emission . integrating , for example , the dotted curve in panel ( c ) of their figure 9 , we find their @xmath76 at surface brightness of @xmath68 photons  @xmath69  s@xmath70  sr@xmath70 , which should be compared to our value of @xmath77 ( thick solid curve in figure 11 ) . at face value ,",
    "their emission estimate is somewhat lower than ours but the difference should be considered to be small , given many physical and numerical factors involved .",
    "therefore , we instead consider this a good agreement .",
    "figure 12 shows a similar plot for o vii and o viii lines in soft x - rays .",
    "note that future planned uv missions ( for o vi and ly@xmath2 lines ) may be able to achieve a sensitivity in the range @xmath78 in the displayed units and the proposed soft x - ray missions ( for o vii and o viii lines ; dios  yoshikawa et al .",
    "2003 ; mbe  fang et al .",
    "2005 ) is expected to be able to achieve a sensitivity of order @xmath79 in the displayed units for a reasonable amount of exposure time .",
    "we see that both uv emission lines such as ly@xmath2 , o vi and soft x - ray emission lines such as o vii and o viii have comparable abundance . the number of emission lines per unit redshift that may be detectable by planned uv and soft x - ray missions are in the order of @xmath10 .",
    "therefore , it is highly desirable to be able to map out emission in both uv and x - ray bands , because they often probe complimentary physical regions .",
    "how large a fraction of the baryons may be probed by these metal emission lines ?",
    "figures 13,14 show the total amount of baryons that can be probed by emission lines as a function of the surface brightness . for the quoted sensitivities in the range @xmath78 in the displayed units ,",
    "we see that o vi line may be able to probe about @xmath80 of all baryons or @xmath81 of whim , while the ly@xmath2 emission line may be able to probe about @xmath82 of whim .",
    "the dios and mbe x - ray mission is expected to be able to detect @xmath83 and @xmath84 of whim , using o vii and o viii lines , respectively , which may be compared to calculations by yoshikawa et al .",
    "( 2004b ) who found that at @xmath85 erg  s@xmath70  @xmath69  sr@xmath70 ( which corresponds to our adopted dios and mbe sensitivity of @xmath86 photons  @xmath69  s@xmath70",
    "sr@xmath70 ) the whim mass fractions probed o vii and o viii are @xmath87 and @xmath84 , respectively .",
    "given the difference in the treatments between ours and theirs the agreement is to be considered good and this also suggest that the local universe , as they simulated , represents a fair sample of the universe with regard to whim . since metal enrichment of the igm is quite inhomogeneous , these emission lines , being in overdense regions , should be able to track a larger fraction of metals produced in star formation .",
    "figures 15,16 show that the o vi emission line will be able to probe about @xmath88 of all metals in the igm , while the o vii and o viii emission lines will be able to probe about @xmath89 of all metals in the igm . in all the above figures ( figures 11 - 16 )",
    "we show that gsw affect quantitative results dramatically ; omission of gsw effect could cause errors @xmath90 with regard to line abundances , baryonic densities and metal densities .",

    "the red contours are the underlying gas density distribution .",
    "it is quite clear that , while detectable regions by these uv and soft x - ray emission lines can not continuously cover the entire filamentary network , they provide a faithful representation of the underlying density structure , especially the filaments .",
    "it may be noted that o vi and ly@xmath2 lines provide rather poor tracer for some the of the larger red contour concentrations , because the latter are sites of hotter gas in the whim temperature range , too hot to be traceable by these uv emission lines ; o vii and o viii x - ray emission lines provide a relatively better set of probers for this hot gas .",
    "figures 21,22,23,24 zoom in to a smaller region of figure 17,18,19,20 respectively , to better display the detailed correspondence between detectable regions and the underlying density structure .",
    "we see that both o vi and ly@xmath2 lines tend to avoid the larger density knots and often appear to be off - centered , i.e. , located in the outskirts of large density concentrations . in contrast , the o vii and o viii emission lines most often directly overlap with the larger density concentrations and do not probe the outskirts of them .",
    "this clearly illustrates the complimentarity of uv and x - ray emission missions , dictated by the complex physical structure of the whim in the vicinity of galaxies and groups of galaxies .",
    "the physical variables that play important roles here are gas temperature , gas density , gas metallicity and gas peculiar velocity .",
    "none of these can be tracked simply but all of them are expected to be influenced significantly by gsw . therefore , detailed comparisons between simulations and observations , when becoming available , may provide an extremely valuable tool to probe galaxy formation and its all important feedback processes .",
    "in cen & ostriker ( 2005 ) we show that our significantly improved simulations confirm previous conclusions based on earlier simulations : _ nearly one half of all baryons at the present epoch should be found in the whim _ - a filamentary network in the temperature range of @xmath11  k. there , we also presented significant effects due to feedback from star formation .    here",
    "we investigate detailed ionization distributions of oxygen , computed explicitly in a non - equilibrium way , and present results related to important uv and soft x - ray lines and how their observations may shed light on whim and galaxy formation processes .",
    "our finding are : ( 1 ) non - equilibrium calculations produce significantly different results from equilibrium calculations , and the differences are complex and difficult to characterize simply .",
    "( 2 ) the abundance of o vi absorption lines based on non - equilibrium simulations with galactic superwinds is in remarkably good agreement with latest observations , implying the validity of our model , while the predicted abundances for o vii and o viii absorption lines appear to be lower than observed but the observational errorbars are currently very large . the expected abundances for o vi ( as well as ly@xmath2 ) , o vii and o viii lines are in the range @xmath3 per unit redshift at @xmath4km / s decreasing to @xmath5 per unit redshift at @xmath6km / s .",
    "the number of o vi absorption lines with @xmath7km / s is very small , while there are about @xmath8 lines per unit redshift for o vii and o viii absorption lines at @xmath9km / s .",
    "( 3 ) emission lines , primarily o vi and ly@xmath2 in the uv and o vii and o viii in the soft x - rays are potentially observable by future missions and they provide complimentary probes of the whim in often different domains in the temperature - density - metallicity phase space as well as in different spatial locations ; however , sometimes they overlap spatially and in phase space , making joint analyses very useful . the number of emission lines per unit redshift that may be detectable by planned uv and soft x - ray missions are in the order of @xmath10 .",
    "we expect that future missions in uv and x - ray should be able to provide much more accurate characterization of the whim through two complimentary approaches : major uv and soft x - ray absorption lines and emission lines .",
    "the former will be able to trace out bulk of the mass as well as volume occupied by the whim , whereas the latter will be able to probe higher density regions .",
    "together they may allow us to construct a coherent picture of the evolution of the igm .",
    "in addition , detailed useful information may be obtained by investigating relations between galaxies and properties of the whim , keeping in mind that gsw play an essential role exchanging mass , metals and energy between them .",
    "we stress that proper comparisons between observations and simulations in the vicinity of galaxies where gsw effects originate and are strongest may provide one of the most useful ways to probe star formation and its all important feedback processes .",
