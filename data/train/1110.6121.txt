    "here we give a bit more background to the main motivations and goals of this project .    _ the standard approaches as ` expectation value settings'._ one of the main goals of this investigation is to relate and compare the ` standard ' approaches to work extraction and information erasure with the single - shot setting , and to argue that the latter quantifies the useful energy content of systems in a way that is closer to our intuitive notion of work as ordered energy . as mentioned in the main text , the standard approaches can in some sense be regarded as ` expectation value settings ' . by this",
    "we mean that work extraction , information erasure , as well as other transformations , are often directly or indirectly analyzed in terms of expectation values , and limits on the costs of these operations are often expressed in terms of expectation values @xcite . in the quantum case , there are several investigations where work in some sense is expressed in terms of combinations of expectation values with respect to quantum states of the system ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . in these quantum cases",
    "it is of course not clear to what extent one can ( or whether one should ) associate an underlying random work variable to the expectation value , unless explicit measurements are included in the model",
    ". we will not consider this issue here , but rather use an essentially discrete classical model , as detailed in sec .",
    "[ model ] .",
    "it is maybe worth to point out that the above comments are not meant to imply that work can , or generally is , treated as an observable @xcite .",
    "rather , it is often defined in terms of differences or changes of expectation values , e.g. , accumulated over a path , akin to what we do in sec .",
    "[ itr ] .    _ non - trivial hamiltonians in the single - shot setting._ for a general treatment of equilibrium and non - equilibrium statistical mechanics it is certainly vital to allow systems to carry non - trivial hamiltonians .",
    "one goal of this investigation is to incorporate this component into the single - shot analysis of work extraction and information erasure .",
    "while fairly straightforward in the standard ( expectation value ) setting , this is more challenging in a single - shot analysis .",
    "the main reason why the case of completely degenerate hamiltonians is easier to handle is because then one can argue that arbitrary unitary operations ( in the quantum case ) or arbitrary permutations ( in the classical case ) come ` for free ' from a thermodynamic point of view , as they do not change the energy distribution of the system .",
    "this freedom opens up the entire toolbox of classical and quantum information theory , which was utilized in previous single - shot analyses @xcite . in the non - degenerate case",
    "it becomes less clear how to use such techniques ( concepts like energy and hamiltonians are somewhat alien to the typical information theoretic setting ) .",
    "the main problem is that we must account for the changes in energy induced by state transformations , as to not manipulate the overall thermodynamic balance sheet in some dubious manner . in this investigation",
    "we handle this issue by making sure that all changes of the state distribution of the system always goes towards thermal equilibrium .",
    "( we are even so brutal as to put the system directly in the equilibrium distribution at each contact with the heat bath .",
    "see sec .  [ model ] . ) for alternative approaches to handle non - trivial hamiltonians in the singe - shot setting , see @xcite and @xcite .",
    "_ work extraction and information erasure as optimization problems._ a further goal of this investigation is to formulate work extraction ( and information erasure ) as an optimization problem over a well defined physical model .",
    "in contrast to many heuristic approaches , we here formulate a model that clearly specifies the rules of the game , and we optimize over _ all _ processes that are allowed within this thermodynamic toy universe . needless to say , we have to strike a balance with tractability , why we settle with a rather simple model .",
    "section  [ model ] introduces this model and defines the set of processes over which we optimize .",
    "to each such process is , by construction , associated a probability distribution of possible work costs . to obtain a well defined optimization problem it is of course not enough to define the set over which to optimize",
    "; we must also specify a cost function . in our case",
    "these cost functions are functionals on the space of probability distributions .",
    "in other words , we assign a value to the probability distribution of work costs of the process , rather than to particular outcomes in each single run .",
    "( furthermore , we do not strictly speaking minimize this cost function in the sense of finding a minimizing element , but we rather determine the infimum over all allowed processes . )",
    "each choice of cost function potentially corresponds to a different formalization of what ` work content ' is supposed to be . in this investigation we compare two cost functions : the expectation value and the @xmath29-deterministic value ( to be defined in sec .",
    "[ properties ] ) .",
    "the former case leads to standard results on work extraction and information erasure , while the latter defines the @xmath10-deterministic work yield or cost of these tasks .    _",
    "@xmath10-deterministic energy vs.  other energy concepts._ as stated earlier , one of the main goals of this investigation is to characterize the essentially noise - free energy content of non - equilibrium states .",
    "it is maybe worth repeating that this study is not necessarily restricted to a nano - scale regime , but rather strives to generally define in a quantitative manner what we mean by ` useful energy ' , irrespective of scale ( although the effects certainly would be relevant in a microscopic regime ) .",
    "moreover , in analogy with other ideal thermodynamic concepts , e.g. , the carnot efficiency , we do not here concern with questions of practical achievability , but rather regard the @xmath10-deterministic work content as ideal quantity to which all realistic implementations can be compared . in this idealized setting it appears natural to capture the notion of ordered energy by demanding that the energy source always produces a predefined energy with almost perfect certainty , as we do with the @xmath10-deterministic values .",
    "undoubtedly there are many alternative definitions of work content that potentially could capture other relevant aspects of energy extraction .",
    "for example , in some applications it might be sufficient to know that the energy yield is beyond a given threshold energy ( e.g. to drive a chemical reaction ) .",
    "such a threshold quantity has been considered in @xcite . however , since it is not a priori clear that such threshold quantities do capture the idea of almost perfectly ordered energy we do not consider that approach here ( see sec .",
    "[ othercostfcns ] for a discussion on this , where we also discuss the possibility that the @xmath10-deterministic work content might be close to the threshold quantities ) .",
    "since we wish to characterize ordered energy it furthermore appears natural to focus on the regime of small failure probabilities @xmath10 .",
    "however , technically speaking our results are valid in the regime @xmath83 ( see corollaries [ almostdetermworkcont ] and [ almostdetermereasurecost ] ) although the maybe more relevant aspect is that we determine the @xmath10-deterministic work content up to an error of the size @xmath46 .",
    "to go beyond our present focus of noise - free energy , it would certainly be interesting to pinpoint the exact value of the @xmath10-deterministic work content for all @xmath84 , i.e. , we could consider different risk tolerance regimes , akin to @xcite .",
    "however , as discussed above , the assumption of non - trivial hamiltonians appears to prohibit a direct application of the techniques of the latter approach . to approach",
    "this question in the present optimization setting with non - trivial hamiltonians goes beyond the tools developed in this investigation and will not be considered here",
    ". however , see recent results in @xcite that uses other techniques to combine non - trivial hamiltonians with arbitrary success probabilities .    as a technical side remark",
    "one may note that the error bound @xmath46 goes to zero as the failure probability @xmath10 goes to zero .",
    "this could be compared to the ( at the time of writing ) typical single - shot information theoretic error terms , as in @xcite , which are of the form @xmath85 and thus diverge with a decreasing @xmath10 .",
    "furthermore , @xmath46 has an interpretation as the size of a thermal equilibrium fluctuation ( see sec .",
    "[ thermfluct ] ) and is thus in a thermodynamic sense ` small ' .",
    "however , beyond the purely aesthetic aspects , it is far from clear what significance such differences concerning error terms have in the thermodynamic setting .",
    "( in information theoretic applications , the divergent error terms are usually unproblematic . )    _ single - shot vs.  the ` multi - copy ' iid setting._ as mentioned in the main text , the single - shot scenario can ( like for the information - theoretic counterparts @xcite ) be regarded as more ` fundamental ' than the ` multi - copy ' scenario of iid states and identical non - interacting hamiltonians , in the sense that the latter can be derived form the former as a special case .",
    "the crucial question is maybe rather to what extent the more general single - shot scenario is relevant . in the multi - copy case",
    "we have seen that the @xmath10-deterministic work content is to the leading order equal to the expected work content .",
    "( note , however , the difference between the single - shot iid case and the expectation value setting .",
    "see sec .",
    "[ expecvssingleshotiid ] . ) in view of standard equilibrium statistical mechanics one could thus suspect that many realistic systems would have states and hamiltonians close to this regime .",
    "however , one should keep in mind that we here consider _ non - equilibrium _ statistical mechanics , where we allow states arbitrarily far from equilibrium .",
    "there is thus no particular reason why we should assume the states to be near iid , irrespective of the structure of the underlying hamiltonian .    on a more broad level",
    "one can view this investigation as a step towards a better understanding of the foundations of statistical mechanics .",
    "for such a purpose it appears more satisfying with a formalism that has the capacity to handle arbitrary states and hamiltonians ; not being restricted to special cases like iid assumptions or non - interacting hamiltonians . furthermore , since realistic physical systems in general neither are perfectly iid nor perfectly non - interacting , this immediately spurs the question of the quality of the approximation we implicitly invoke by assuming an analysis based on a multi - copy setting .",
    "the single - shot setting can be used to answer such questions .    _",
    "not a study on the emergence of thermodynamics._ as mentioned , this investigation , together with @xcite can be regarded as the first steps toward a single - shot statistical mechanics .",
    "it is certainly a relevant question how the issues considered here relate to the countless of studies on the foundations of thermodynamics and statistical mechanics , the emergence of irreversibility , the second law , and other aspects of standard thermodynamics and statistical mechanics . as an illustrative ( but very small )",
    "selection one can mention studies of emergence of thermodynamics in closed quantum systems @xcite , the efforts to understand the existence of canonical equilibrium states via entanglement @xcite , or the relation between entanglement and the thermodynamic arrow of time @xcite .",
    "in contrast to these studies we do not here strive to analyze the very emergence of thermodynamics per se .",
    "we essentially put in irreversibility , the second law , and canonical thermal states by hand when we model the contact with the heat bath as replacement maps that put the system in the gibbs distribution ( see sec .  [ model ] ) .",
    "this investigation should rather be understood as an approach towards a more fine - tuned quantitative characterization of the consequences of the second law , where we , e.g. , ask how ordered energy should be characterized in a consistent manner for arbitrary distributions and hamiltonians .",
    "_ to avoid confusion : auxiliary comments on the technical scope and terminology._ for the sake of simplicity and conceptual clarity we have in the main text focused on the work extraction problem .",
    "however , due to the close relation between these two tasks , we here also treat the work cost of information erasure . moreover , rather than assuming that these processes begin and end in the very same collection of energy levels @xmath4 ( as we did in the main text ) we allow an initial set of energy levels @xmath86 and final set of energy levels @xmath87 .",
    "this makes it easier to use these processes as building blocks in a composition of processes .",
    "furthermore , for convenience , and to underline the similarities between work extraction and information erasure , we will often express the former in terms of its _ work cost _ rather than its work yield as we did in the main text .",
    "for example , in sec .",
    "[ sec : optimalexpected ] we introduce @xmath88 as the minimal expected work cost of transforming the system from the set of energy levels @xmath86 to the new levels @xmath89 , assuming the initial state is distributed @xmath2 .",

    "the choice of model in this investigation is a compromise between simplicity for tractable optimization problems , and the need to capture some essential aspects of the effects of a heat bath .",
    "similar types of models have bee considered in @xcite .      _",
    "the setting : probability distributions over energy levels._ we assume that the system can be in a finite set of states @xmath91 , where @xmath92 is a fixed number . to each such state @xmath13",
    "we associate an energy level @xmath93 . in other words ,",

    "here , @xmath96 denotes the probability simplex over @xmath92 objects @xmath97 by @xmath98 we denote the subset of all distributions with full support , i.e. , @xmath99 for @xmath100 .",
    "_ elementary operations : energy level transformations and thermalizations._ our model includes two elementary operations that allow us to change the energy levels and the state of the system , respectively .",
    "the first type of elementary operation allows us to change the collection of energy levels @xmath101 into a new configuration @xmath102 of our choice .",
    "we refer to this as a _ level transformation _ ( lt ) .",
    "note that we assume that an lt always transforms an element @xmath103 to an element @xmath104 .",
    "in particular , the underlying number of states does not change , and we do not allow ` infinite energies ' , like @xmath105 or @xmath106 . ( the latter is not a particularly severe restriction as we can use limits to essentially the same effect . ) the lts do not affect the state of the system , and thus the random variable @xmath107 describing the state after the lt is identical to the state @xmath16 before the transformation , i.e. , @xmath108 .    via the lts",
    "we furthermore define what ` work ' is in this model .",
    "given an lt that takes @xmath4 to @xmath12 , operating on the initial state @xmath16 , we define the _ work cost _ as @xmath109 we refer to @xmath110 as the _ work yield _ or _ work gain_.",
    "the second elementary operation changes the state of the system , and models the thermalization by a heat bath of temperature @xmath0 .",
    "we will throughout this investigation assume that this temperature is fixed and given .",
    "the thermalization does not change the energy levels @xmath4 , but replaces the state @xmath16 with a new _ independent _ random variable @xmath111 that is gibbs distributed with respect to @xmath4 , i.e. , @xmath112 where @xmath113 and where @xmath5 is boltzmann s constant .",
    "we denote @xmath114 .",
    "that @xmath107 is ` independent ' is to be understood such that if we make a sequence of thermalizations , the resulting family of random variables are all independent of each other and of the initial state .",
    "the thermalization has no work cost .",
    "_ processes as arbitrary combinations of elementary operations._ when we speak of a _ process _ @xmath23 we mean a finite sequence of lts and thermalizations ( at one fixed temperature @xmath0 ) .",
    "the work cost of a process @xmath23 is defined as the sum of the work costs of all the lts in the process .",
    "we denote the work cost of a process @xmath23 as @xmath115 , where @xmath16 is the initial state .",
    "we let @xmath116 denote the collection of all processes that starts in the energy levels @xmath117 and ends with the energy levels @xmath89 .",
    "note that the work cost of two lts are independent only if they are separated by a thermalization .",
    "since two consecutive lt processes can be combined into one single ( adding their work costs ) , and since two consecutive thermalizations have the same effect as one single , we may without loss of generality regard every process in @xmath116 as an alternating sequence of thermalizations and lts . if the system initially is in state @xmath16 , with distribution @xmath2 , and if @xmath118 is the sequence of energy level configurations , we may thus in general write the work cost of the process as @xmath119 where each @xmath120 is an independent random variable . here",
    "@xmath121 , and @xmath120 is gibbs distributed @xmath122 for each @xmath123 .",
    "we let @xmath124 denote the final state of the process @xmath125 that operates on the initial state @xmath16 .",
    "note that @xmath124 depends on @xmath16 only in the case that @xmath23 does not contain any thermalization , due to the assumed independence of subsequent states separated by thermalizations . in the case",
    "that @xmath23 does contain a thermalization , then @xmath124 is distributed according to gibbs distribution of the last thermalization in the process .      here",
    "we briefly consider possible physical interpretations of the elementary operations in the model , and also discuss some of the inherent limitations .    _ lt s as adiabatic transformations._ as suggested by our use of phrases such as ` energy levels ' the most immediate interpretation of this model would be in terms of a quantum system .",
    "the lts would then correspond to adiabatic passage . by this",
    "we intend hamiltonian evolution as a closed quantum system , where the hamiltonian depends on external parameters ( e.g , classical fields ) that we change by a much slower rate than the characteristic time - scales of the hamiltonian .",
    "( we may need to take some extra care at possible level crossings . )",
    "_ ideal complete thermalizations._ the application of the thermalization operation corresponds to turning on the interactions to a heat bath , let the system thermalize , and finally de - connect the system . especially for small systems",
    ", it is certainly a relevant question to what extent it in practice is possible to implement such procedures in a controlled fashion .",
    "however , this investigation aims at understanding the theoretical limitations of ideal thermodynamics , and we do not consider practical issues .",
    "moreover , like in all ideal thermodynamic considerations we do not concern ourselves with questions about kinetics .",
    "in other words , we impose no constraints on how much time can be spent on implementing the thermalization procedure ( or the adiabatic transformations implementing the lt s ) .",
    "this is much in spirit with standard thermodynamic considerations where optimal efficiency ( e.g. in a carnot cycle ) typically is reached only in the limit of infinitely slow operations . under these idealized assumptions , the thermalization model",
    "we employ appears a reasonable choice .",
    "it is maybe worth noticing that the way we model the effect of a heat bath is a special case of the detailed balance condition as employed , e.g. , in @xcite for a derivation of the jarzynski equality , or in @xcite for landauer s principle .",
    "while the detailed balance condition allows a partial or gradual thermalization of the system , our model is somewhat more brutal in that it directly puts the entire system in the gibbs distribution .",
    "_ hidden costs of time - dependent operations ?",
    "_ our model includes time dependent transformations : the lts as well as the connection and disconnection to the heat bath .",
    "the question is if these time - dependent operations implicitly require hidden resources for their implementations .",
    "this time - dependence could be put in contrast to the time - independent constructions of , e.g. , minimal refrigerators and heat pumps @xcite .",
    "however , those schemes operate in a steady state regime , quite the opposite to the single - shot setting we consider here .",
    "one could imagine to ` embed ' our time - dependent single - shot scheme into a time - independent construction .",
    "this would require us to explicitly model the control systems that implements the time - dependence , and one potentially relevant resource would be the quality and stability of the clock that times the evolution @xcite .",
    "it does not seem unreasonable that considerations of this type could add new layers to the work extraction and information erasure problem .",
    "however , it also appears reasonable that the essence of the findings of the present investigation would remain , e.g. , in some ideal limit .",
    "_ in essence a discrete classical model._ if we regard our system as a quantum system , our treatment corresponds to the case that the initial density operator is diagonal in an energy eigenbasis .",
    "( strictly speaking , we should also include an energy measurement to obtain a random variable from the underlying quantum state at each lt .",
    "however , as the state already is assumed to be diagonal in an energy eigenbasis , this is more of a technicality . ) hence , even though our model indeed can be phrased in terms of a quantum system , it in essence is a classical discrete model . as such we can neither analyze the effects of superpositions of energy levels , nor quantum correlations to an observer with a quantum memory as in @xcite .",
    "such a quantum generalization is likely to require an explicit treatment of the degrees of freedom that carries the extracted energy . as a remark",
    "we note that the discrete classical setting of course allows us to investigate effects of purely classical correlations with an observer . however , to avoid further technical complications we do not consider this question here .",
    "isothermal reversible process takes an equilibrium configuration to another , where the work cost is given by the free energy difference of the final and initial system .",
    "these processes are generally quasi - static ( i.e. , at each point along the process , the system is essentially in equilibrium with the heat bath ) .",
    "here we consider the counterpart of this in our model , which will serve as an important building block in the rest of this investigation .    given an initial configuration of energy levels @xmath117 and a final set of energy levels @xmath87 we consider a path in the space of energy level configurations along which we move by incremental steps of lt processes sandwiched between thermalizations . in the limit of infinitely small steps we find that the expected work cost converges toward the free energy difference of the final and initial energy configuration .",
    "however , by an argument very similar to the weak law of large numbers , we make the observation that the work cost essentially becomes deterministic .",
    "consider a bounded and sufficiently smooth path @xmath126\\rightarrow\\mathbb{r}^{n}$ ] , such that @xmath127 and @xmath128 .",
    "we make an @xmath129-step discretization of this path , as @xmath130 , for @xmath131 , where @xmath132 . given this discretization",

    "if we define @xmath139 one can see that the expectation value of the work cost is @xmath140 where @xmath141 denotes the free energy of @xmath4 .    by using the assumed independence of the state variables",

    ", @xmath926 is a kind of threshold quantity that asks for the minimal bound on the work cost that is violated with a probability at most @xmath10 .",

    "it is not clear how noisy an extraction process that yields the optimal value @xmath926 could be .",
    "( analogous to what we did in sec .",
    "[ fluctuations ] for the optimal expected work extraction , we could ask for the noise properties of processes that achieve @xmath926 . )",
    "the problem is that the distribution of the work cost potentially could have a tail extending far below the threshold , which corresponds to some degree of unpredictability of this energy source .    by eq .",
    "( [ ineqdeltamax ] ) we can conclude that @xmath927 one could speculate whether @xmath926 has almost the same value as @xmath675 in general thermodynamic models .",
    "( whether they have the same value in the particular model we employ here is not clear . )",
    "the intuition is that we could ` waste ' energy in order to make the work cost variable more concentrated .",
    "more precisely , imagine that we have found a process @xmath23 such that @xmath928 , for some @xmath495 .",
    "conditioned on the case that @xmath929 , i.e. , that the work cost is _ less _ than @xmath495 , one could imagine to make an additional dissipation of size @xmath930 . by this , all the weight of the probability distribution below @xmath495 is ` shuffled ' into a single peak at @xmath495 .",
    "this would make @xmath495 into an @xmath10-deterministic value .",
    "however , this ` wasting of energy ' is conditional , i.e. , the choice of process depends on the actual value of @xmath931 ( as opposed to the processes generally considered in this investigation , which do not depend on the values of the random work variables per se ) .",
    "the analysis of such conditional processes would reasonably entail an explicit modeling of the control mechanisms that implements these conditional processes ( regarding the conditional process as an unconditional process on a larger system ) .",
    "in view of landauer s principle , we should not expect the resetting of this control mechanism to come for free .",
    "the question is , what does it cost us to ` waste ' energy ?",
    "another way to phrase the very same question would be to focus on the system that carries the extracted energy ( which we do not model explicitly in this investigation ) .",
    "the ` shuffling ' of the work value described above , corresponds to a many - to - one map on the states of the energy reservoir , which again is an erasure process .",
    "loosely speaking , the question whether @xmath926 coincides with @xmath675 or not , can be rephrased as the question whether the removal of the excess energy matches the cost of its own erasure .",
    "there are certainly many cases where systems appear to have this ` self - erasure ' property .",
    "when the typical energy scale is much larger than @xmath870 , one can imagine scenarios when the system on a short time - scale more or less perfectly relaxes to some meta - stable state , thus implementing the above mentioned concentration of the distribution .",

    "<S> the work content of non - equilibrium systems in relation to a heat bath is often analyzed in terms of expectation values of an underlying random work variable . </S>",
    "<S> however , we show that when optimizing the expectation value of the extracted work , the resulting extraction process is subject to intrinsic fluctuations , uniquely determined by the hamiltonian and the initial distribution of the system . these fluctuations can be of the same order as the expected work content per se , in which case the extracted energy is unpredictable , thus intuitively more heat - like than work - like . </S>",
    "<S> this raises the question of the ` truly ' work - like energy that can extracted . </S>",
    "<S> here we consider an alternative that corresponds to an essentially fluctuation - free extraction . </S>",
    "<S> we show that this quantity can be expressed in terms of a non - equilibrium generalization of the free energy , or equivalently in terms of a one - shot relative entropy measure introduced in information theory .    </S>",
    "<S> the amount of useful energy that can be harvested from non - equilibrium systems not only characterizes practical energy extraction and storage , but is also a fundamental thermodynamic quantity . </S>",
    "<S> intuitively , we wish to extract ordered and predictable energy , i.e. , ` work ' , as opposed to disordered random energy in the form of ` heat ' . </S>",
    "<S> the catch is that , in statistical systems , the work cost or yield of a given transformation is typically a random variable @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this raises the question of a quantitative notion of work content that truly reflects the idea of work as ordered energy . </S>",
    "<S> here we show that standard expressions for the work content @xcite can correspond to a very noisy and thus heat - like energy , but we also introduce an alternative that quantifies the amount of ordered energy that can be extracted . </S>",
    "<S> the latter can be expressed in terms of a non - equilibrium generalization of the free energy , or equivalently in terms of a one - shot relative entropy introduced in information theory . </S>",
    "<S> the work extraction problem is linked to information theory via concepts like szilard engines , landauer s principle , and maxwell s demon @xcite , with recent contributions in connection to one - shot information theory @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a direct consequence of the present investigation is that the latter is brought into a more physical setting , allowing , e.g. , systems with non - trivial hamiltonians , proof of near - optimality , as well as a connection to fluctuation theorems @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> similar results as in this study have been obtained independently in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> see also recent results in @xcite based on ideas in @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the amount of work that a system can perform while it equilibrates with respect to an environment of temperature @xmath0 is often @xcite expressed as @xmath1 here @xmath2 is the state of the system , @xmath3 its equilibrium state , @xmath4 the system hamiltonian , and @xmath5 boltzmann s constant . for the simple model we employ here </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath2 is a probability distribution over a finite set of energy levels , and @xmath6 is the relative shannon entropy ( kullback - leibler divergence ) @xcite , and @xmath7 denotes the base @xmath8 logarithm .    the quantity @xmath9 , and the closely related cost of information erasure ( landauer s principle ) , is often understood as an expectation value of an underlying random work yield ( see e.g.  @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> however , this tells us very little about the fluctuations , and thus the ` quality ' of the extracted energy . </S>",
    "<S> here we show that optimizing the expected gain leads to intrinsic fluctuations . these can be of the same order as the expected work content @xmath9 per se , in which case the work extraction does not act as a truly ordered energy source . as an alternative </S>",
    "<S> , we introduce the _ </S>",
    "<S> @xmath10-deterministic work content _ , which quantifies the maximal amount of energy that can be extracted if we demand to always get precisely this energy each single time we run the extraction process , apart from a small probability of failure @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> this quantity formalizes the idea of an almost perfectly ordered energy source .    </S>",
    "<S> our analysis is based on a very simple model of a system interacting with a heat bath of fixed temperature @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> akin to , e.g. , @xcite , we model the hamiltonian of the system as finite set of energy levels @xmath11 , and the state @xmath2 as a probability distribution over these </S>",
    "<S> . we can raise or lower the energy levels at will , which we refer to as _ level transformations _ ( lt ) . </S>",
    "<S> ( for a quantum system this would essentially correspond to adiabatic evolution with respect to some external control parameters . ) via the lts we define what ` work ' is in our model . </S>",
    "<S> if we perform an lt that changes @xmath4 to @xmath12 , and if the system is in state @xmath13 , then this results in a work gain @xmath14 ( or work cost @xmath15 ) . to model the thermalization , we put the system into the random state @xmath16 described by the gibbs distribution , @xmath17 , where @xmath18 , @xmath19 , and @xmath20 is the partition function . </S>",
    "<S> it is furthermore assumed that the state ( regarded as a random variable ) after a thermalization is independent of the state before . </S>",
    "<S> we combine sequences of lts and thermalizations to construct processes . </S>",
    "<S> an example is given in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1 ] , where we construct the analogue of isothermal reversible ( itr ) processes , which serve as a building block in our analysis . </S>",
    "<S> as opposed to other processes we will consider , the itrs have essentially fluctuation - free work costs .    </S>",
    "<S> given an initial state @xmath16 with distribution @xmath2 , we can reproduce eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ optimalexpectedextractionmain ] ) within our model . a cyclic three - step process , as described in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ fig2 ] ) , gives the random work yield @xmath21 by taking the expectation value we obtain eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ optimalexpectedextractionmain ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> the positivity of relative entropy , @xmath22 , can be used to show that no process can give a better expected work yield ( proposition [ optimalexpectedwork ] in appendix [ sec : optimalexpected ] ) .    </S>",
    "<S> how large are the fluctuations for a process that maximizes the expected work extraction , and thus achieves @xmath9 ? </S>",
    "<S> equation ( [ optyieldvariable ] ) determines the noise of the specific process in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2 ] , but it turns out that it actually specifies the fluctuations for all processes that optimize the expected work extraction . </S>",
    "<S> we can phrase this result more precisely as follows . for a process @xmath23 that operates on an initial state @xmath16 with distribution @xmath2 , we let @xmath24 denote the corresponding random work yield . </S>",
    "<S> we here consider cyclic processes that starts and ends in the energy levels @xmath4 . if @xmath25 is a family of processes such that @xmath26 , then @xmath27 in probability . </S>",
    "<S> ( for a proof see sec .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fluctuations ] in the appendix . ) </S>",
    "<S> we can conclude that to analyze the noise in the optimal expected work extraction , it is enough to consider eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ optyieldvariable ] ) . as we will confirm later </S>",
    "<S> , these fluctuations can be of the same order as @xmath9 itself .    </S>",
    "<S> since the optimal expected work extraction suffers from fluctuations , a natural question is how much ( essentially ) noise - free energy can be extracted . </S>",
    "<S> we say that a random variable @xmath28 has the @xmath29-deterministic value @xmath30 , if the probability to find @xmath28 in the interval @xmath31 $ ] is larger than @xmath32 . </S>",
    "<S> hence , @xmath33 is the precision by which the value @xmath30 is taken , and @xmath10 the largest probability by which this fails . </S>",
    "<S> we define @xmath34 as the highest possible @xmath29-deterministic work yield among all processes that operate on the initial distribution @xmath2 with initial and final energy levels @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> next , we define the @xmath10-deterministic work content as @xmath35 , i.e. , we take the limit of infinite precision , thus formalizing the idea of an energy extraction that is essentially free from fluctuations .    </S>",
    "<S> @xmath36 can be expressed in terms of the _ @xmath10-free energy _ , which is defined via restrictions to sufficiently likely subsets of energy levels . </S>",
    "<S> given a subset @xmath37 , we define @xmath38 . </S>",
    "<S> we minimize @xmath39 among all subsets @xmath37 such that @xmath40 . </S>",
    "<S> if @xmath41 is such a minimizing set , then the @xmath10-free energy is defined as @xmath42 . </S>",
    "<S> the concept of one - shot free energy has been introduced independently in @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the distribution of fluctuations is clearly important for determining the value of @xmath36 . </S>",
    "<S> it is thus maybe not surprising that a fluctuation theorem plays an important role to show the following bound on the @xmath10-deterministic work content @xmath43 in other words , for small @xmath10 we have @xmath44 in the case of completely degenerate energy levels @xmath45 , eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ bound ] ) reduces to the result in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we obtain the lower bound in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ bound ] ) by the process described in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3 ] . </S>",
    "<S> the upper bound is obtained by a combination of a version ( lemma [ crooks ] ) on crook s fluctuation theorem @xcite and a work bound for lts ( sec .  </S>",
    "<S> [ proofofmain ] in the appendix ) . </S>",
    "<S> see also sec .  </S>",
    "<S> [ sec : almdeter ] for the @xmath10-deterministic work cost of information erasure </S>",
    "<S> .    one can show ( sec .  </S>",
    "<S> [ thermfluct ] ) that @xmath46 is an upper bound to the @xmath10-deterministic work content of equilibrium systems . equation ( [ bound ] ) thus determines the value of @xmath36 up to an error with the size of a sufficiently probable equilibrium fluctuation .    </S>",
    "<S> the above result can be reformulated in terms of an @xmath10-smoothed relative rnyi @xmath47-entropy , defined as @xmath48 . </S>",
    "<S> this relative entropy was ( up to some technical differences ) introduced in @xcite in the context of one - shot information theory . </S>",
    "<S> ( see @xcite for quantum versions . ) </S>",
    "<S> one can see that @xmath49    an immediate question is how @xmath9 compares with @xmath36 , and with the fluctuations in the optimal expected work extraction . </S>",
    "<S> the latter we measure by the standard deviation of @xmath50 in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ optyieldvariable ] ) , @xmath51 . </S>",
    "<S> we compare how these three quantities scale with increasing system size ( e.g. , in number of spins , or other units ) .    </S>",
    "<S> our first example is a collection of @xmath52 systems whose state distributions are independent and identical , @xmath53 , and which have non - interacting identical hamiltonians , corresponding to energy levels @xmath54 . in this case @xmath55 , and @xmath56 , where @xmath57 ^ 2 -d(q\\vert r)^2 $ ] . </S>",
    "<S> one can show that @xmath58 is equal to @xmath59 to the leading order in @xmath52 ( see @xcite for a similar result in a resource theory framework ) . </S>",
    "<S> more precisely , @xmath60 where @xmath61 is a correction term that grows slower than @xmath62 , and @xmath63 is the inverse of the cumulative distribution function of the standard normal distribution . </S>",
    "<S> the smaller our error tolerance @xmath10 , the more the correction term lowers the value of @xmath64 as compared to @xmath65 . </S>",
    "<S> this expansion is proved via berry - esseen s theorem @xcite , which determines the convergence rate in the central limit theorem ( see sec .  </S>",
    "<S> [ indepidentical ] in the appendix ) .    as seen from eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ expansion ] ) the difference between the expected and the @xmath10-deterministic work content only appears at the next to leading order . </S>",
    "<S> hence , in these particular systems the fluctuations are comparably small , and the dominant contribution to @xmath58 is @xmath66 . </S>",
    "<S> it appears reasonable to expect similar results for non - equilibrium systems with sufficiently fast spatial decay of both correlations and interactions , which may explain why issues concerning @xmath67 as a measure of work content appear to have gone largely unnoticed .    a simple modification of the state distribution in the previous example results in a system with large fluctuations . with probability @xmath32 ( independent of @xmath52 ) </S>",
    "<S> the system is prepared in the joint ground state @xmath68 , and with probability @xmath10 in the gibbs distribution . </S>",
    "<S> this results in @xmath69 , and yields @xmath70 , @xmath71 , and @xmath72 . </S>",
    "<S> hence , all three quantities grow proportionally to @xmath52 .    </S>",
    "<S> for second case of large fluctuations we choose the distribution @xmath73 , for a collection of @xmath74-level systems . </S>",
    "<S> for large @xmath52 we assume that the energy levels are dense enough that they can be replaced by a spectral density . </S>",
    "<S> one example is wigner s semi - circle law , where @xmath75 $ ] for @xmath76 . with @xmath77 </S>",
    "<S> this is the asymptotic energy level distribution of large random matrices from the gaussian unitary ensemble @xcite . for the semi - circle distribution @xmath78 , @xmath79 , and @xmath80 , where @xmath81 is independent of @xmath52 .    </S>",
    "<S> we have here employed what one could refer to as a discrete classical model . </S>",
    "<S> relevant extensions include a classical phase - space picture , as well as a quantum setting that allows superpositions between different energy eigenstates ( e.g. , in the spirit of @xcite ) and where the work - extractor can possess quantum information about the system @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> an operational approach , based on what ` work ' is supposed to achieve , rather than ad hoc definitions , may yield deeper insights to the question of the truly work - like energy content .    </S>",
    "<S> it is certainly justified to ask for the relevance of the effects we have considered here . </S>",
    "<S> the evident role of fluctuations suggests that the noise in the expected work extraction should become noticeable in the same nano - regimes as where fluctuation theorems are relevant . </S>",
    "<S> the considerable experimental progress on the latter ( see e.g.  @xcite ) should reasonably be applicable also to the former . </S>",
    "<S> also the theoretical aspects of the link to fluctuation theorems merits further investigations .    in principle </S>",
    "<S> , the fluctuations in the expected work extraction can be large also outside the microscopic regime , as this only requires a sufficiently ` violent ' relation between the non - equilibrium state and the hamiltonian of the system . as opposed to the expected work content </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath82 retains its interpretation as the ordered energy . </S>",
    "<S> it is no coincidence that this is much analogous to how single - shot information theory generalizes ` standard ' information theory @xcite . in this spirit , </S>",
    "<S> the present study , along with @xcite , can be viewed as the first glimpse of a ` single - shot statistical mechanics ' .    </S>",
