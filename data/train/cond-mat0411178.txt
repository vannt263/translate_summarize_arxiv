    "these domain walls can be considered as elastic objects , whose surface tends to be minimized in order to decrease the total wall energy .",
    "however , such elastic objects may meander from an optimal flat configuration in order to take advantage of particularly favorable regions of the potential landscape , which can vary due to disorder in the ferroelectric film , as well as the commensurate potential of the crystal lattice itself .",

    "once again , the domain structures remained completely stable @xcite .",
    "moreover , similar linear domains heated to 440@xmath26c did not show any change when imaged after subsequent cooling @xcite .",
    "it is therefore likely that pre - written ferroelectric domain structures in thin films can subsequently be incorporated into further processing steps up to , and possibly well beyond this temperature . as shall be explained in more detail , such high stability in zero applied field",
    "is in fact inherent to the glassy behavior of an elastic disordered system .    4 nm error of the experiment .",
    "the local control of ferrolectric polarization provided by afm , together with its nanometer resolution , also make it a powerful tool for fundamental studies of domain dynamics and dependence on writing parameters such as the writing time . as previously reported @xcite",
    ", we observed a strong dependence of domain radius on the writing time for times longer than @xmath2520 @xmath4s . for shorter times",
    ", domain radii appeared to saturate at @xmath2520 nm , a size we relate to the 25  50 nm nominal radius of curvature of the afm tip used for these experiments .",
    "for each writing time , 16- or 25-domain arrays were written with 12 v pulses , and the domain radius was calculated by averaging over the measured domain radii along their vertical and horizontal axes , with a rms error of @xmath2510% .",
    "all imaged domains appeared homogeneous and well defined and no randomly nucleated domains were observed .",
    "these data suggest a two - step switching process : first , rapid nucleation and forward growth across the thickness of the sample occur under the afm tip ; this event is followed by slower radial motion of the domain wall outwards , perpendicular to the polarization direction , in order to increase domain size .",
    "we analyzed this radial domain wall motion in the framework of a pinned elastic system by comparing the velocity and the driving force exerted on the wall , in our case due to the electric field @xmath37 applied by the tip .",
    "we considered arrays written with consecutive pulse durations , extracting the domain wall velocity as @xmath38 , the difference in domain radii at the two subsequent writing times divided by the difference in the writing times themselves .",
    "the electric field distribution was obtained by modelling the tip as a charged sphere , with radius @xmath39 taken as equal to the domain saturation size of 20 nm . applying a voltage @xmath40 to the tip at the surface of the ferroelectric film with dielectric constant",

    "the domain radii remain comparable to the size of the tip , so further simplification can be obtained by considering only the first order of image charge reflections in the film and the substrate . since the voltage drop @xmath40 across the film is simply the integral of this field over the film thickness @xmath48 we can define the average field across the film @xmath49 , which shows a @xmath50 dependence in this first order approximation . as one moves further away from the tip , a crossover to higher orders of @xmath45 dependence in the denominator",
    "is expected for the field .",
    "this simplified model shows reasonable agreement with a more accurate numerical simulation of a hyperbolic tip in contact with a ferroelectric film grown on a metallic substrate . here ,",

    "although the field @xmath54 is highly inhomogeneous at large length scales , it can be taken as constant over the very small thickness ( on the order of a lattice spacing ) of the ferroelectric domain wall .",

    "it is also important to note that if the creep consists of motion in a periodic potential the creep exponent is constrained to be @xmath18 .",

    "@xcite ] we note that random bond disorder exponents have been confirmed by measurements of domain wall creep and roughness in an ultrathin magnetic film @xcite . in a random field scenario , in which defects locally asymmetrize the ferroelectric double well potential , @xmath124 @xcite , giving @xmath125 for all dimensionalities of the manifold between 1 and 4 .",

    "for @xmath14 , however , the force is not large enough to overcome the barriers and the motion proceeds by thermal activation .",
    "this is the creep regime , leading to a small and non - linear response . in our case ,",
    "a rough estimate of the values of @xmath129 may thus be obtained by extrapolating the linear behavior of the velocity , which occurs at high field values .",
    "although we were unable to extend our measurement significantly into this region , we can nonetheless at least place a lower bound on the value of @xmath129 of 180 mv / m , as indicated on fig .",
    "[ e_crit ] for one of our thinner films , where higher values of the field could be implemented .",
    "taking @xmath131 to be of the order of a unit cell , we can use the field data to extract an approximate value of @xmath132 nm , below the limit of resolution of our measurement .     to be estimated as 100 mv / m .",
    "]    in the creep regime , we can rewrite ( [ eq : energy ] ) . for simplicity",
    "we write formulas for the isotropic case . using the scaling @xmath133 one obtains @xmath134 where @xmath135 . minimizing the energy with respect to the external field @xmath37 ,",
    "we obtain the size of the minimal nucleus capable of moving to a lower energy state as @xmath136 with @xmath137 .",
    "the minimal barrier height to be passed by thermal activation thus corresponds to the length @xmath138 , leading to a velocity of the form @xmath139 if one assumes an arrhenius law in passing the barriers .",
    "the very slow ( creep ) response is due to the fact that for a small force the system would have to rearrange large portions of the interface to be able to find a new metastable state of low enough energy .",
    "the barriers a domain wall must pass to make such a rearrangement therefore diverge as the force goes to zero .",
    "this divergence could inherently explain the very high stability of domain structures we have observed in our films , in the limit of zero electric fields , even at relatively high temperatures .    the expression ( [ eq : nucreep ] )",
    "gives the critical nucleus size @xmath140 as a function of the applied field @xmath37 and @xmath112 .",
    "we note that this expression is independent of the dimensionality of the film , and that the applied and critical fields are present as a ratio , thus removing the uncertainty associated with the correction of the field in the afm tip - ferroelectric thin film configuration . as for the case of the periodic potential ,",
    "these expressions are valid if the size of the nucleus is smaller than the thickness of the sample .",
    "otherwise one of the dimensions of the nucleus should be replaced by the thickness , transforming a two - dimensional interface into a one - dimensional line . a crucial difference between the periodic and the disordered cases",
    "is that creep due to disorder can still exist in the one - dimensional situation , contrary to the periodic case .",
    "note that the question of whether the films should be considered as one- or two - dimensional depends on which mechanism controls the nucleus .",
    "a film could thus be in the one - dimensional limit for the periodic potential , thereby invalidating the periodic potential as a possible origin for the creep process , and still be in the two - dimensional limit for the disorder provided that the size of the nucleus due to disorder remains smaller than the thickness of the film .",
    "although creep is still present in the one - dimensional disordered case , the value of the exponent @xmath4 depends on the dimension . using the values for @xmath129 and @xmath112 we had obtained",
    ", we can estimate the size of the critical nucleus for the creep process and compare it with that found for the miller - weinreich formulation . in our system ,",
    "the applied field is a function of the distance @xmath45 away from the tip center . using the largest possible ( random field ) value of @xmath21 we find @xmath140 to vary between 0.2 and 1 nm in the thinnest films ( 29.0  51.0 nm ) , and 0.2 and 2.5 nm in the thickest films ( 95.0  130.0 nm ) .",
    "note that in all cases @xmath141 , where @xmath45 is the radius of the domain , so the approximation of a linear domain wall is quite reasonable at that scale + .",
    "interestingly , the anomalously large size of the nucleus given by the miller - weinreich model has previously been remarked on by landauer @xcite .",
    "moreover , studies of the piezoelectric effect and dielectric permittivity in pzt films @xcite have shown non - linear features which can not be described by a simple phenomenological model , but which could be described by the pinning of domain walls at randomly distributed pinning centers.m ) ceramic and sol - gel films , where the presence of multiple grain boundaries and differently oriented domain walls provides a much more complex disorder landscape compared to the epitaxially grown films used for this study . ]",
    "the scenario of weak pinning of elastic interfaces in disordered media was also invoked as a possible explanation for the dielectric dispersion observed in the ferroelectric rbh@xmath24po@xmath142 @xcite .",
    "the present study , investigating the static and dynamic behavior of individual ferroelectric domains with nanoscale resolution therefore provides an important clarification of this issue from the microscopic point of view .",
    "another way to approach the question of ferroelectric domain wall creep , and its microscopic origins , is to investigate the effects of changing the disorder in the film .",
    "we studied two different types of defects : columnar tracks of amorphous material introduced by heavy ion irradiation ( carried out by c. simon and a. ruyter at ganil ) , and planar a - axis oriented inclusions introduced in thicker films during growth . for the irradiated films , samples",
    "51.0 to 116.0 nm thick were half - shielded by metallic plates before irradiation , in order to directly compare domain dynamics in non - irradiated and irradiated regions of the same sample . as shown in the afm topography scan in fig .",
    "[ irr](a ) , the tracks are 6  13 nm in diameter at the point of entry , and appear as small white `` bumps '' , since the amorphous material is less dense than the crystalline form surrounding the tracks . as shown in the corresponding piezoresponse image ( fig .",
    "[ irr](b ) ) , these are exactly the regions which remain unaffected by attempts to uniformly polarize the area by scanning with a constant negative voltage , appearing as dots with dark phase contrast , as opposed to the lighter phase contrast of the rest of the image .",
    "thus , irradiation defects can be distinguished from merely topographic features like the large white `` bump '' in the middle of the topographical scan , which switches under the application of an electric field and does not appear as a corresponding dark area in the piezoresponse image .",
    "the density of defects observed in this image ( @xmath143 /cm@xmath30 ) agrees reasonably with the nominal irradiation density @xmath144 /cm@xmath30 used , considering the small area ( @xmath145 nm@xmath30 ) over which the poisson distribution is observed . to ensure continuous tracks throughout the sample , with the ions lodging deep in the substrate , measurements from other experiments on similar oxides carried out at ganil were used to determine irradiation energies @xcite .",
    "to produce the planar a - axis inclusion , we grew relatively thick films , slightly varying the temperature from its optimal range , which generally results in the presence of a - axis , as shown in the afm topography ( fig .",
    "[ axe_a](a ) ) . once again",
    ", the a - axis oriented regions do not respond to switching attempts , as shown in the piezoresponse image in fig .",
    "[ axe_a](b ) , since the applied field is perpendicular to the polarization axis .",
    "these defects are approximately 25 nm wide , extending for hundreds of nanometers in the crystallographic a and b axis directions , and inclined at 45@xmath26 to the c - axis of the film @xcite . in all films ,",
    "25 domain arrays were written , and the domain dynamics extracted as described previously @xcite . in the a - axis films , domains were written adjacent to , but not right on top of the a - axis inclusions .     is applied across the film , once again appearing as dark contrast lines against a uniformly polarized background . ]    as shown in fig .",
    "[ def_r_t](a ) for a 95.4 nm film , we find that domain sizes are comparable in both the irradiated and normal regions of the sample .",
    "however , for longer writing times , domains in the irradiated part of the sample appear somewhat larger that those written in the normal regions of the same sample . when comparing pure c - axis film 95.4 and 130.0 nm thick to a film of similar thickness ( 108.9 nm ) with a - axis inclusions ( fig .",
    "[ def_r_t](b ) ) this increase in domain size for longer writing times in the presence of defects is also observed .",
    "the effect of the irradiation tracks and a - axis inclusions becomes more evident when the arrhenius plot of velocity vs the inverse field is compared for the same films ( fig .",
    "[ def_v_e](a ) and ( b ) ) .",
    "we find a decrease in the values of the dynamical exponent in the irradiated regions , as compared to the normal regions , from a range of 0.62  0.69 to one of 0.38  0.5 .",
    "this decrease is even more marked for films containing a - axis inclusions , with @xmath4 values of 0.31 and 0.19 @xcite . that this is not a thickness effect can be seen by comparing the a - axis - containing films to pure c - axis films of similar thickness , in which @xmath4 values of 0.69 and 0.78 ( for 95.4 and 130.0 nm thick films , respectively ) are observed .",
    "it is interesting to note that both these types of defects are large compared to the thickness of the wall itself , occur at a relatively low density , and are either columnar or planar , as opposed to point - like .",
    "the mechanism by which they affect the dynamics of the domain wall is therefore unlikely to be a direct weak collective pinning effect , and thus the marked decrease observed in the dynamical exponent is somewhat surprising .",
    "possibly , the relaxation of strain in the film caused by these macroscopic `` defects '' changes the density or pinning force of the inherent , weak point defects present in the film , thus affecting the disorder potential experienced by the domain wall .",
    "since a large amount of energy is dissipated within the substrate by the heavy ion during irradiation , with possible deformation as strain induced in the substrate @xcite , this could result in additional strain effects on the ferroelectric film .",
    "alternatively , the presence of defects which penetrate through the entire thickness of the film might act to make the wall more rigid  and therefore more one - dimensional .",
    "a more detailed investigation of domain walls in the presence of these defects , perhaps looking at their specific individual interaction , is needed to ascertain the microscopic nature of this behavior .    .",
    "in the presence of defects , the values of the creep exponent @xmath4 decrease from 0.69 to 0.38 and from 0.69 and 0.78 to 0.31 in the half - irradiated film , and the pure c - axis films vs the film with a - axis inclusions , respectively . ]",
    "using the unprecedented control and precision provided by afm , we were able to study the growth of individual nanoscale ferroelectric domains in epitaxial thin films , investigating both the fundamental physics of domain wall motion , and its consequences for possible afm - ferroelectric applications .",
    "our studies demonstrate that domain wall motion in ferroelectric thin films is a creep process in which @xmath146 , with a dynamical exponent @xmath4 between @xmath25 0.7 and 1.0 .",
    "this process controls the lateral growth of domains in low electric fields applied by an afm tip .",
    "a detailed analysis of the possible microscopic origins of the observed domain wall creep suggests that it is the result of competition between elastic behavior and pinning in a disorder potential .",
    "the reduced dimensionality of our thin films compared to the size of the critical nucleus precludes pinning in the commensurate potential of the crystal itself as the mechanism for the non - linear field dependence of the velocity .",
    "we have also observed that the presence of artificially introduced defects , such as irradiation tracks or a - axis inclusions , strongly decreases the dynamical exponent for domain wall creep , from @xmath147 ",
    "@xmath148 to @xmath149  @xmath150 and @xmath151 .",
    "all the domains show high stability ( up to 4 months for the longest duration experiments ) , inherently explained by the physics of a system in which elasticity and pinning by a disorder potential compete , leading to glassy behavior in the presence of low electric fields .",
    "this high stability is important for applications such as information storage or surface acoustic wave devices based on ferroelectric domain structures .",
    "our studies have also identified the key parameters controlling domain size as the writing time , the applied voltage , and the confinement of the electric field , with encouraging results for novel tip geometries using carbon nanotube bundles .    the authors would like to thank m. dawber and c. h. ahn for enriching discussions .",
