    "the density functional theory ( dft ) of hohenberg , kohn , and sham is the method of choice for describing the ground - state properties of materials @xcite .",
    "however , in the initial derivation of the dft , the eigenvalues are lagrange multipliers introduced to orthogonalize the eigenvectors , which in their turn are used to compute the total energy and the charge density . in this formulation",
    "the eigenvalues have therefore no physical meaning and should not be considered as excited states .",
    "nevertheless , the dft in the local density approximation ( lda ) or in its spin resolved local density formulation ( lsda ) , has been used successfully to compute the excited states , namely , optical and magneto - optical properties , x - ray absorption and magnetic dichroism spectra .",
    "the lda or lsda were indeed intended to compute the ground - state properties of materials , and their use during the last two decades has produced an excellent track record in the computation of these properties for a wide variety of materials , ranging from simple metals to complex semiconductor superlattices .",
    "however , it is now believed that the dft can do more than computing the ground state properties .",
    "this is because the kohn  sham equations could be viewed as deriving form a simplified quasi - particle ( qp ) theory where the self - energy is local and time averaged , i.e. , @xmath1 , here @xmath2 is the local exchange and correlation potential as , for example , parameterized by von barth and hedin @xcite .",
    "viewed in this way , the ks eigenvalues are then approximate qp energies and could be compared to experimental data .",
    "this argument is supported by quasiparticle calculations within the so called gw approximation of hedin @xcite showing that the valence qp energies of semiconductors are in good agreement with these obtained using lda , and the conduction qp energies differ by approximately a rigid energy shift @xcite . in the literature",
    "this shift is often called `` scissors - operator '' shift @xcite .    in the last few years",
    "spectroscopy is becoming the standard tool for measuring excited states of materials .",
    "its owes its impressive advances to the availability of synchrotron tunable highly polarized radiation .",
    "in particular , the measurement of optical , magneto - optical properties as well as magnetic x - ray dichroism are now becoming routine tasks for probing the structural and magnetic properties of materials .",
    "considerable attention has been focused on transition - metal surfaces and and thin films due to their novel physical properties different from that of bulk materials and due to potential industrial applications such as magneto - optical recording , sensors , or technology based on giant magneto - resistance . in this respect",
    ", theory is falling far behind experiment and it is becoming hard to give a basic interpretation of experimental data .",
    "this paper , which is far from being a review paper about calculated excited states , tries to bridge the gap between experiment and theory by describing a rather quantitative method for computing excited states of materials .",
    "this method uses the local density approximation and the linear muffin - tin orbital ( lmto ) method . in the first part of this paper",
    "we introduce the density functional theory and the local density approximation and justify the use of lda eigenvalues as approximate excited states and relate them to quasiparticle energies .",
    "in the second part we describe the construction of the lmto basis set within an all - electron full - potential approach @xcite which will be used to determine the momentum matrix elements .",
    "we devote the third part to the determination of the momentum matrix elements . in the first part of the application section we present some examples of computation of semiconductors optical spectra @xcite , and leave out the optical properties of metals and magneto - optical properties of materials and refer the reader to ref . @xcite . in the second part of the applications we show some examples of x - ray magnetic dichroism calculations @xcite .",
    "the density functional method of hohenberg and kohn @xcite which states that the ground state total energy of a system of n interacting electrons in an external potential @xmath3 is a functional of the electron density @xmath4 does not provide an analytical form of the functional @xcite .",
    "this method remains numerically intractable without the kohn and sham introduction of the so called local density approximation @xcite in which the exchange and correlation functional @xmath5 appearing in the total energy :    @xmath6    is given by @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the exchange - correlation energy of a uniform electron gas of density @xmath9 .",
    "thus , kohn and sham constructed a set of self - consistent single - particle equations :    @xmath10    where the density @xmath11 is given by :    @xmath12    and @xmath13    @xmath14    instead of the true kinetic energy of the electron gas , kohn and sham used the homogeneous electron kinetic energy :    @xmath15    this use of homogeneous - electron kinetic energy in the kohn  sham equations redefined the exchange - correlation function to be :",
    "@xmath16    it is then crucial to use a good basis - set for the description of the electronic structure of realistic systems . the augmented plane wave @xcite ( apw ) , and the korringa - kohn - rostoker @xcite ( kkr ) methods can be used , in principle , to solve exactly the kohn ",
    "sham equations , however these methods are numerically involved and their linearization , introduced by andersen is much preferable .",
    "andersen linearization , has not only made the techniques for solving the band - structure problem transparent by reducing it essentially to the diagonalization of one - electron hamiltonian , and cuts the cost of computation by at least one order of magnitude .",
    "the linearized versions of these two powerful methods are the linear augmented plane wave ( lapw ) and linear muffin - tin orbital ( lmto ) methods , respectively @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we will only use the lmto method to study excited states of solids .",
    "the reason for this choice is that the lmto method is the mostly used method in computational electronic structure .",
    "this is due primarily to the use of atomic - sphere approximation ( asa ) which made the lmto method run fast even on today s cheap personal computers . due to this reduced computational cost ,",
    "the lmto asa method became the method of choice of researchers without access to supercomputers .",
    "the quasiparticle ( qp ) electronic structure of an interacting many - body system is described by the single - particle eigenstates resulting from the interaction of this single particle with the many - body electron gas of the system .",
    "the single - particle eigenstate energies are the results of solving a schroedinger like equation containing the non - local and energy - dependent self - energy instead of the exchange - correlation potential appearing in kohn  sham like equations :    @xmath17    thus the self - energy @xmath18 contains all many - body effects .",
    "almost all ab - initio qp studies were performed within the so - called @xmath19 approximation , where the self - energy @xmath18 is calculated within hedin s @xmath19 approximation .",
    "this method consists of approximating the self - energy as the convolution of the lda self - consistent green function @xmath20 and the screened coulomb interaction @xmath21 within the random - phase approximation .",
    "the qp eigenvalues are often obtained using first - order perturbation theory starting from lda eigenvalues and eigenvectors @xcite .",
    "although there are early calculations starting from hartree - fock @xcite or tight - binding @xcite methods . nevertheless , the best results are based on a lda starting point @xcite .",
    "thus the @xmath19 predicted optical excitations energies of semiconductors are within 0.1 ev form the experimental results and the surprizing fact is that the qp wave functions are almost identical to these produced within the lda @xcite ( the wave function overlap is more than 99% ) . for a general review of gw calculations",
    "see the review by araysetianwan and gunnarsson @xcite or by aulbur , jnsson and wilkins @xcite .",
    "it is clear that the quasiparticle schroedinger equation resembles to the kohn  sham equation .",
    "both equations describe a fictitious electron moving in a effective potential .",
    "the difference is that the self - energy is nonlocal and energy dependent whereas the lda potential is local and averaged over time .",
    "this resemblance can be further pushed by noticing that the dft can be used to obtain excitation energies .",
    "for example , the ionization energy , @xmath22 , and the electron affinity , @xmath23 , are difference between ground state energies :    @xmath24    were @xmath25 is the number of electrons of the system . and",
    "since the dft gives the correct ground state energies it should produce , in principle , the correct ionization and electron affinity energies .",
    "for metals , the addition or removal of an electron from the system costs the same energy , and hence the ionization energy is equal to the electron affinity . for insulators , the energy gap makes all the difference and hence breaks this symmetry . thus the energy band gap is given by :    @xmath26    in practice , however , the calculation is often obtained within the lda and the energy band gap is calculated as the difference between the lowest conduction band and the highest valence band .",
    "it was shown by sham and schlter @xcite and perdew and levy @xcite that the calculated energy gap differ from the true band gap by an amount @xmath27 even when the dft is used without the lda .",
    "the @xmath27 value could range from @xmath28 in the case of silicon to @xmath29 in the case of germanium .",
    "for most of the semiconductors , the @xmath19 calculations show that the lda eigenvalues differ form the @xmath19 quasiparticle energy by a constant @xmath27 which is almost independent of the @xmath30-point .",
    "this finding is important and shows that the lda eigenvalues have some meaning and could be used to calculate excited states . so as stated in the introduction , the kohn ",
    "sham equations could be viewed as deriving form a simplified quasi - particle ( qp ) theory where the self - energy is made local and time averaged , i.e. , @xmath1 .",
    "this approximation is certainly good for metals where we have a good data base for excited state calculated within the lda @xcite and where the agreement with experiment is good . for semiconductors ,",
    "this approximation is not bad either , provided we know the value of the discontinuity of the exchange and correlation .",
    "usually , this value is provided by @xmath19 calculations or by experiment .",
    "in this section we describe the lmto basis - set used to calculate the excited states of solids .",
    "we discuss the basis used for an all electron calculation where the potential is not supposed to be spherically symmetric nor of muffin - tin type .",
    "the use of a general potential makes the study of open structures possible without having to resort to the so - called `` empty - sphere '' approximation . to define the basis - set , we divide the space into non overlapping spheres called `` muffin - tin '' spheres and a region between these spheres which we call interstitial region . inside the muffin - tin spheres",
    "the schroedinger equation is solved at a fixed energy for each angular momentum @xmath31 and variational parameter @xmath32 ( which is defined later )",
    ". the linearization amounts to the use of a linear combination of the solution @xmath33 of the schroedinger equation for a fixed energy and its energy derivative @xmath34 inside the muffin - tin spheres .",
    "these linear combinations matche continuously and differentiably to an envelop function ( spherical function ) in the interstitial region .",
    "the bloch wave function in the interstitial region is given by a linear combination of these hankel functions centered at each site :    @xmath35    where @xmath36 stands for the number of the basis function quantum numbers ( these numbers are @xmath37 ) , where @xmath38 is the site number , @xmath39 groups the two angular quantum numbers , and @xmath40 is the linearization energy for a particular atom type @xmath41 and angular momentum number @xmath31 .",
    "the envelop functions are defined as @xmath42 .",
    "@xmath43    here @xmath44 is the neumann function and @xmath45 bessel function for the angular momentum @xmath31 , and @xmath46 are the spherical harmonics .    to get the differentiability of the wave - function at the boundary of the muffin - tin spheres , we write the envelope function inside the muffin - tin spheres .",
    "the envelope function for a muffin - tin sphere @xmath47 is given by :    @xmath48    to produce smooth basis functions we require that the basis function is differentiable at the boundary of each muffin - tin sphere , i.e. , that a linear combination of @xmath49 and @xmath50 matches continuously and differentiably @xmath51 and @xmath52 at the boundary of the parent sphere and other spheres , respectively .",
    "using these matching conditions at the muffin - tin spheres , the bloch wave function inside a muffin - tin sphere @xmath53 of the unit cell at the origin is given by @xcite :    @xmath54    where    @xmath55",
    "@xmath56    @xmath57    to add the spin dependence to the basis - set , the bloch wave function is multiplied by the eigenvector of the pauli spin operator @xmath58 :    @xmath59    such that :    @xmath60    where @xmath61 is the quantization axis chosen in advance .",
    "here we give a review of the determination of the dielectric response of a semiconductor due to the application of an electric field .",
    "we expend the description of our published work @xcite by giving more details concerning the calculation of the momentum matrix elements .",

    "this is not surprising because the higher excited states which are free electrons like are most probably well described within lda and need no scissors - operator shift .",

    "et al._. ]    to compare the results with experiment we have to take into account the effect of the core hole and the experimental resolution .",
    "this is done by convoluting the calculated spectra by a lorentzian of widths of 0.9 ev and 1.4 ev for the l@xmath163 and l@xmath149 edges , respectively , in addition a gaussian broadening of 0.4 ev is added to take into account the experimental resolution .",
    "the calculation of the x - ray magnetic circular dichroic signal ignoring the electron - hole recombination effect provides a semi - quantitative agreement with the experimental spectra .",
    "hence , we believe that the core hole effect represented here by a lorentzian broadening plays a significant role in determining the correct l@xmath164 branching ratio for 3@xmath165 transition metals . the underestimation of the @xmath166 branching ratio remains a challenge for theorists and further theoretical development along the line proposed by schwitalla and ebert @xcite is needed to bring the theory at the level of the experiment .    for the 4@xmath165-transition metals ,",
    "the core hole is deeper , and the agreement with experiment of the xmcd is satisfactory .",
    "figure 6 shows the calculated xmcd at the site of pt of the copt ordered alloy .",
    "-edge of pt compared to the experimental spectrum of grange _",
    "et al._. ]    in contrast to what is obtained for co , the results for the pt site show a much better agreement with experiment , due to the fact that the core hole effect is less intense ( core hole much deeper than that of co ) . for the pt atom we used both a lorentzian ( 1 ev ) and a gaussian ( 1 ev ) to represent the core hole effect and a gaussian of 1 ev width for the experimental resolution .",
    "the experimental and theoretical @xmath167 and @xmath168 edges are separated by a spin - orbit splitting of the @xmath160 core states of @xmath169 and @xmath170 ev respectively .",
    "the width of both @xmath167 and @xmath168 edges is comparable to experiment , but the calculated @xmath167 edge is much larger .",
    "this produces a calculated integrated branching ratio of 1.49 which is much smaller than the experimental ratio of 2.66 . here",
    "again the theory is underestimating the branching ratio .",
    "we have reviewed the fp - lmto method and the implementation of the optical properties and x - ray magnetic dichroism within the local density approximation .",
    "we have showed that the momentum matrix elements can be evaluated as a muffin - tin contribution and a surface term .",
    "the method has been successfully used to compute the optical properties of metals @xcite , semiconductors @xcite and magneto - optical properties @xcite of transition metals alloys , as well as x - ray magnetic circular dichroism @xcite with high precision .    for small - gap semiconductors",
    "a scissors - operator shift should be used to reproduce the static and dynamic dielectric function @xcite .",
    "excitonic effects seem to be important in reproducing the correct optical energy gap @xcite . for wide - gap semiconductors the local - density approximation ( lda )",
    "static dielectric function is in good agreement with experiment and no scissors - operator shift is required despite the underestimation of the band gap by lda @xcite .    for the computation of the x - ray magnetic circular dichroism the agreement with experiment",
    "is rather good @xcite .",
    "however , the so called branching ratio is underestimated by the theory . more theoretical work where the electron core - hole interaction is taken into account",
    "is needed to bring the theory at the quality level of experiment @xcite .",
