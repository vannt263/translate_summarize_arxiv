    "the advantages to studying the compact object content of the magellanic clouds are well known : a relatively small angular size , at a reasonably close and known distance , located at a high galactic latitude with little obscuration by the interstellar medium of the galaxy .",
    "in addition , there is evidence for recent star formation in the smc over the last few 10 s of millions of years which creates an environment in which x - ray pulsars are expected to be plentiful ( haberl & sasaki 2000 , maragoudaki et al .",
    "this expectation is borne out by recent discoveries of more than a score of previously unknown x - ray pulsars in the smc based on observations from the asca , rosat , rxte , and chandra x - ray missions .",
    "recent reviews of these discoveries are presented in yokogawa et al .",

    "this discovery continues our program of routinely evaluating the pulsar content of archival data from the smc .",
    "this monitoring has revealed eight previously undiscovered x - ray pulsars ( macomb et al .",

    "characteristics which support its likely identity as an axp are presented . in the section 2",
    "we present the x - ray observations and spectral analysis relating to the 202 s pulsar and the possible axp as well as detailed pulse phase spectroscopy of the recently discovered 263 s pulsar ( haberl & pietsch 2004 ) . in section 3",
    "we present evidence relating to the optical identification of the 202 and 263 s pulsars , followed by a discussion , in section 4 , of these pulsars as well as the possible axp ,    x - ray binaries are conventionally divided into two distinct classes : high mass ( companion stars with masses @xmath1 8 solar masses ) and low mass ( companion masses @xmath2 1 solar mass ) with relatively few x - ray binaries having companions with masses in the intermediate range .",
    "the division into the two classes makes sense , since their evolution is quite different . for the high mass x - ray binaries ( hmxbs ) ,",
    "the maximum lifetime for their existence is set by the nuclear burning time of an 8 solar mass star , which is @xmath3 yr ( verbunt & van den heuvel 1995 ) . whereas low - mass x - ray binaries have lifetimes of @xmath4 yr or more .",

    "we note ( as other authors have noted ) that virtually all of are located in young ( ages @xmath5 years ) star forming regions as expected on the basis of binary evolution models ( verbunt & van den heuvel 1995 ) .",
    "we note a significant inverse correlation between period and maximum x - ray flux density for those hmxbs with be companions .",
    "( this anti - correlation has been previously noted for all x - ray binaries by stella , white & rosner 1986 . )",
    "the anti - correlation may be a reflection of the fact that for such objects spin period is correlated with orbital period ( corbet 1986 ) and longer period be hmxbs have lower maximum accretion rates .",
    "we note a similar correlation between x - ray luminosity and spin period for the be hmxb pulsars of the milky way .",
    "we find no significant difference between the distribution of periods from the hmxbs of the smc compared with that of the milky way , except for a slight deficit for smc pulsars with periods longer than @xmath6200s .",

    "there are absorption and sky coverage effects that may diminish the number of detected hmxbs for the milky way , nevertheless , on the face of it the smc population of hmxbs is overabundant relative to the milky way by a factor of @xmath38 .",
    "this points to a spectacular episode of star formation in the smc beginning approximately 30 million years ago .",
    "one of the advantages of population studies with the smc is its well known distance .",
    "thus fluxes are proportional to luminosity , a fundamental parameter of each binary system .",
    "we have investigated the possibility of a correlation between the spin period of the neutron star and its luminosity using the maximum reported flux density .",
    "we have restricted this investigation to the subset of the hmxbs in table 5 which are firmly identified with be companions .",
    "on the basis of a simple model of the accretion process for such objects , discussed below , one might expect that rapid rotation leads to greater maximum luminosity .",
    "we find empirically that notion is supported by the observations .    in figure 8(a )",
    "we have plotted the maximum x - ray flux density versus spin period for the be hmxbs .",
    "( note : we have added four be hmxb pulsars from the lmc and multiplied their flux densities by 0.727 to account for the difference between the distance to the lmc and to the smc .",
    "the lmc sources are : 0535 - 668 , j0544.1 - 7100 , j0502.9 - 6626 and j0529.8 - 6556 . )",
    "the maximum flux densities are anti - correlated with spin periods , having a correlation coefficient of -0.75 .",
    "the probability that there is no correlation between spin period and maximum flux density is @xmath39 .",
    "the solid line in figure 8(a ) , a least square fit to the points , has a slope of -0.73@xmath40 .",
    "a similar anti - correlation for all x - ray binary pulsars was noted by stella , white & rosner ( 1986 ) and interpreted as the result of centrifugal inhibition of accretion .",
    "we note that if the 202 and 263 s pulsars are also be hmxbs , and if we take the fluxes determined in this observation as maximum ( certainly a lower limit ) , they may be located as well on the plot of figure 8 ( a ) . doing this , we find that the point for the 263 s pulsar lies below the best fit straight line of figure 8 ( a ) by a factor of two ; the 202 s pulsar lies somewhat lower by about a factor of 6 . in view of the scatter of points shown in figure 8 ( a )",
    "these differences are relatively minor .",
    "we find that a similar correlation exists for the be hmxb pulsars of the milky way .",
    "haberl & sasaki ( 2000 ) list the spin period and maximum luminosity of 27 hmxb pulsars of the milky way ( their table 3 ) .",
    "we have plotted these data in figure 8(b ) .",
    "the data are strongly correlated , correlation coefficient of -0.69 , with a probability of @xmath41 that the correlation is by chance , and a fitted slope of -1.01@xmath42 .",
    "we have combined the data for the milky way and for the magellanic clouds into a single plot , shown in figure 9 .",
    "we have scaled the magellanic cloud data to an smc distance of 60 kpc .",
    "the correlation coefficient for this combined data , milky way plus the magellanic clouds ( 46 points ) , is -0.71 with a probability that it is due to chance of 2.9@xmath43 .",
    "the fitted slope has a value of -0.95@xmath44 .",
    "many hmxbs are transients with large variation in flux .",
    "this fact undoubtedly contributes to the scatter of the points of figure 8 and 9 .",
    "nevertheless there is a significant inverse correlation between maximum x - ray flux density and period .",
    "this correlation should be understandable in terms of the physics of the accretion process . in a simple model of accretion from the stellar wind of",
    "the be companion , the rate of accretion onto the neutron star is proportional to the density of the wind , which depends on 1/r@xmath45 where r is the distance between the companion and the neutron star .",
    "`` n '' is found to range from 2 to 4 , but mostly between 2.5 and 3 ( waters & van kerkwijk 1989 ) .",
    "we take n=3 . by",
    "kepler s law , r goes as p@xmath46 of the neutron star .",
    "empirically spin period for be hmxbs is proportional to p@xmath47 ( corbet 1986 ) .",
    "thus luminosity should scale roughly as p@xmath48 , implying a slope of -1 for the correlation of the data points of figures 8 and 9 in rough agreement with what is observed .",
    "note that only four of the be systems listed in table 5 have measured orbital periods .",
    "p@xmath49 , because of the corbet relation , thus becomes a surrogate for p@xmath50 .",
    "of course there are many complications to this very simple analysis .",
    "one complication is that , for highly elliptic orbits , mass transfer from the companion to the neutron star will occur near periastron and thus the appropriate scaling distance is significantly less than r. nevertheless , further work on this demonstrable correlation between spin period and x - ray luminosity may be fruitful .",
    "it could be that a suitably improved relation would serve as a distance indicator .",
    "we have found that the maximum degree of correlation between the magellanic clouds and the milky way is achieved if the luminosities are reduced by roughly 2/3 of their value , which would imply a distance reduced by @xmath618% . since we believe that the distances to the lmc and the smc are rather well determined",
    "a more likely possibility is that the magellanic be hmxbs are perhaps more luminous that those of the milky way .",
    "another possibility is that the estimates of the distances of the milky way sources are inaccurate , and their luminosities in general need to be increased .",
    "we have compared the period distribution of smc population of hmxb pulsars to that of the milky way . in figure 10 ,",
    "the cumulative distributions of pulse periods are shown for the hmxbs for both galaxies .",
    "for the milky way the distribution is compiled from the catalog of liu et al .",
    "( 2000 ) . for the smc",
    "the distribution is compiled from table 5 .",
    "the distributions are normalized to the total number of hmxbs of each kind .",
    "the two distributions are virtually identical for periods less than 200 s , however for longer periods there is a slight deficit of smc hmxbs relative to the milky way .",
    "if the smc population is indeed younger than the milky way population , a preference for short - period pulsars in the smc could be construed as evidence that high - mass binaries spin - down over time on average .",
    "since our data does not currently support such a difference , the interpretation is that significant changes of pulse period distributions occur only over timescales longer than the difference in average age between the smc and milky way populations .",
    "( this discussion will need to be amended if a significant number of the pulsars in table 6 should turn out to be hmxbs , since their periods are predominately short period .",
    "for example , 12 of the 14 pulsars in table 6 have periods less than 100s , whereas only 11 of 24 of the pulsars in table 5 have periods less than 100s . )",
    "the slight deficit of long period smc pulsars seen in figure 10 may be due to their relative faintness compared to their more rapidly spinning cousins ( see figure 8(a ) ) .",
    "this argues for even deeper surveys of the smc to establish a complete catalog of such objects .",
