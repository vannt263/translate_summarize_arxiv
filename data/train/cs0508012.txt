    "the problem of choosing @xmath18 and @xmath85 such that certain entropy constraints are not violated is independent of the assignment problem and deferred to section  [ sec : optq ] .",

    "before we outline the design procedure for constructing an optimal index assignment we remark that in order to minimize the wspsd between a fixed @xmath108 and the set of points @xmath109 it is required that @xmath86 forms a sphere centered at @xmath108 .    1 .   center a sphere @xmath86 at each @xmath90 and construct all possible @xmath29-tuples @xmath110 where @xmath111 and @xmath112 .",
