    "some of the observed galactic microlensing events show a signature of a binary lens . the first such event discovered was macho lmc#1 , where its binary nature has been discussed by dominik & hirshfeld ( @xcite , @xcite ) and by rhie ( @xcite ) and rhie & bennett ( @xcite ) .",
    "an explanation with a binary lens has also been proposed for ogle#6 by mao & di stefano ( @xcite ) .",
    "neither of these events involves crossings of the source trajectory with the caustics , which would result in sharp spikes in the light curves , which are a clear characteristic of a binary ( or multiple ) lens .",
    "for this reason , these events are called weak binary lens events ( according to mao & paczyski ( @xcite ) ) .",
    "in contrast , the events ogle#7 ( udalski et al .",
    "@xcite ) , duo#2 ( alard et al .",
    "@xcite ) , and macho lmc#9 ( bennett et al .",
    "@xcite ) involve such caustic crossings , and are therefore called strong binary lens events .",
    "the macho collaboration claims at least 5 additional binary lens events in their data obtained with the alert system , namely 95-blg-12 , 96-blg-3 , 97-blg-1 , 97-blg-28 , and 97-blg-41 ( stubbs et al .",
    "additional data for these events have been obtained by the macho collaboration for the ogle#7 event ( bennett et al .",
    "@xcite , @xcite ; alcock et al .",
    "@xcite ) and by the planet collaboration for the events 95-blg-12 , 97-blg-28 , and 97-blg-41 ( albrow et al .",
    "1998a , b ) .",
    "it is a general feature that ambiguities may occur if the data has poor quality , where poor quality means a bad sampling rate and an insufficient photometric accuracy .",
    "however , except for the discussion of the macho lmc#1 event ( dominik & hirshfeld 1996 ) , only one model has been presented for the binary lens microlensing events . in this paper",
    ", it is shown that several binary lens models can fit the observed data for the events ogle#7 and duo#2 showing that these possible ambiguities exist among the observed events . to draw the right conclusions from the observed data it is necessary to find all models which fit the data .",
    "therefore it is interesting to see which types of configurations produce which types of light curves .",
    "for the macho lmc#1 event , 6 different configurations have been found which can produce an asymmetric light curve of the desired form , so that whenever an event of this form occurs , one should check for ( at least ) this 6 configurations .",
    "in fact , light curves of the type bl and of the type ba can differ by less than 0.3% which is much less than the photometric accuracy actually achieved by the observing teams , so that this ambiguity remains even with a perfect sampling of the data .",
    "the arising ambiguities for binary lens events have also been addressed in a recent paper by di  stefano & perna ( @xcite ) .    in this paper , configurations are shown which produce a double caustic crossing ( ogle#7 ) and a double caustic crossing with a following peak ( duo#2 ) .",
    "though this paper deals with specific events , the types of light curves discussed here are expected to appear more frequently in the data .",
    "the configurations shown should be checked as possible solutions for the fit whenever an event of this type occurs .",
    "therefore , this analysis for specific events is instructive in general , even if additional observations show that some of the models can be ruled out for these specific events .",
    "better than what can be done by a simulation , the observed events show the actual quality of the data .    to extract the underlying physical quantities like the masses of the lens objects , it is of interest to see how well the observed data constrains the fit parameters .",
    "except for macho lmc#1 ( dominik & hirshfeld  @xcite , @xcite ) , no error bounds on the fit parameters have been given for binary lens events .",
    "in this paper , these error bounds are given for most of the fits for ogle#7 and duo#2 .",

    "3 gives the discussion of the ogle#7 event , while the duo#2 event is discussed in sect .",
    "4 . in sect .  5",
    "the results are summarized .",
    "consider a lens at a distance @xmath2 from the observer , a source at a distance @xmath3 from the observer , and let @xmath4 be the lens - source distance .",
    "the einstein radius for a lens of mass @xmath5 is then given by @xmath6 further consider an optical axis through observer and lens center and planes perpendicular to it at the position of the lens ( lens plane ) and the source ( source plane ) centered at the optical axis .",
    "let the source be located at @xmath7 in the source plane and let a light ray pass from the source to the observer through the lens plane at @xmath8 .    for a binary lens consisting of a mass with fraction @xmath9 of the total mass @xmath5 at @xmath10 and a mass with fraction @xmath11 at @xmath12 , where @xmath13 , the coordinates @xmath14 and @xmath15 are related by the lens equation @xmath16 which gives the true source position as a function of the observed image position . for a given source position , there are either 3 or 5 images . to obtain the images for a given source position @xmath15 one has to solve the lens equation numerically .",
    "the magnification @xmath17 of an image at @xmath14 is given by the inverse of the jacobian determinant of the mapping , i.e. @xmath18 and the total magnification of a ( point ) source @xmath19 is given as the sum of the magnifications of the individual images .",
    "a ( point ) source is located on a caustic if @xmath20 diverges for at least one image @xmath14 .",
    "the magnification of an extended source is obtained by integrating over the point source magnifications .",
    "let the source move on a straight line with a velocity @xmath21 projected onto the lens plane transverse to the line - of - sight between observer and lens , so that it moves one einstein radius in the lens plane in the time @xmath22 . into the opposite direction .",
    "further note that if the fixed source is on the right side of the lens trajectory , a corresponding fixed lens is on the right side of the source trajectory . ] for the fits , a timescale @xmath23 is used .",
    "in addition , the following parameters are used ( see fig .",
    "[ confgfigure ] ) : the source trajectory projected to the lens plane has the closest approach to the origin at the time @xmath24 and the distance @xmath25 . the angle @xmath26 is measured between the @xmath27-direction and the direction of motion of the source . to get uniqueness in parameter space ,",
    "the sign of the velocity of the source is chosen so that the midpoint of the lens system is on the right hand side of the line traced in time by the source and the parameter ranges are @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "the observed amplification of the source object as a function of time @xmath31 has been calculated efficiently by solving the lens equation for the whole source trajectory simultaneously ( dominik  @xcite ) and by determining the magnification from the images with eq .",
    "( [ mageq ] ) .",
    "another parametrization for binary lenses has been used by mao & di stefano ( @xcite ) .",
    "the main difference is that they refer the closest approach of the source to the center of mass of the lens system and not to the midpoint .",
    "the translation between the parameter sets is shown in table  [ maodomtrans ] .",

    "it gives the contribution of the light of the unlensed source to the total light .",
    "if @xmath31 denotes the amplification of the source , the observed amplification is given by @xmath46",
    "the ogle#7 event ( udalski et al .  @xcite , hereafter usm ) is the first event observed which shows the signature of a strong binary lens .",
    "in contrast to the macho lmc#1 event , it is clear that a single lens can not explain the data , because it will produce neither spikes nor a plateau formed like a u , irrespective of whether the source is a binary or not or whether the objects are extended . a first fit to the data has been presented in  usm .",
    "however , several binary lens fits for these data are possible . in tables",
    "[ ogle7fits1 ] and  [ ogle7fits2 ] , i present the results of 8 different fits .",
    "the @xmath47 corresponds to the original errors given by the ogle collaboration .",
    "the errors on the parameters correspond to projections of the hypersurface @xmath48 onto the axes in parameter space .",
    "the characteristic time ranges from @xmath49 ( bl0 ) to @xmath50 ( bl6 ) which means that the expected total mass ( @xmath51 ) varies by a factor of 80 .",
    "the mass ratio ranges from about 1 ( bl0 , bl6 , bl7 ) to 16 ( bl ) .",
    "the contribution of external light ( blending ) at the mimimum light ranges from 17  % ( bl9 ) to 94  % ( bl ) . note that some of the errors on @xmath52 are large : for bl2 the 1-@xmath1 error is about 25  % of the value , for bl7 , bl1 , bl3 , and bl9 the 1-@xmath1 errors are also about 1020  % of the value of @xmath52 .",
    "the second pair of caustic crossings for the bl - fit and the caustic crossings on the triangle shaped caustic for the bl6-fit posed additional problems for the calculation of the error bounds , so that no error bounds are shown for these fits .",
    "the fit of usm corresponds to the bl0-fit .",
    "table  [ o7ogle ] shows the parameters of the bl0-fit in the parametrization used in usm and the parameters quoted there .",
    "note that their @xmath53 is the magnitude of the lensed component , while @xmath54 corresponds to the minimum light observed , i.e. the light from the lensed and the unlensed component .",
    "these quantities are therefore related by @xmath55    if one accepts the given error bars of the data points , one sees that the values of @xmath56 are very bad ( see table  [ ogle7probu ] ) .",
    "if one adapts the size of the error bars to the tail data points in the same way as for the macho lmc#1 event ( dominik & hirshfeld  @xcite ) , but with gaussian errors , defining all data points for @xmath57 as belonging to the tail , one obtains a scaling factor of @xmath58 , which means that the errors are enlarged by about 60  % .",
    "the probabilities for the fits become @xmath59 for all fits and @xmath60 for all fits except for bl3 and bl9 .",
    "if one looks carefully at the light curve and the data , one sees that the data point in the tail at @xmath61 and @xmath62 contributes about 33 to the total @xmath47 .",
    "if one omits this discrepant point , one gets a rescaling factor of @xmath63 and the results shown in table  [ ogle7probnpt ] .",
    "if one assumes that the discrepant point in the tail is due to a measurement error , and taking into account that the error bars may be about 15 - 25  % too small , one can accept all 8 models ( see table  [ ogle7probnpt ] ) .",
    "if one does not ascribe the discrepant point to a measurement error , one has to accept the large rescaling factor to allow the tail to be constant .",
    "also in this case , all the fits are acceptable .",
    "note that the errors may show some non - gaussian behaviour .",
    "this behaviour is effectively absorbed into the rescaling factor in my analysis .",

    ".    while ambiguities for duo#2 are due to the bad sampling rate , the light curves for the different models are much more similar for ogle#7 and macho lmc#1 , so that even for a good ( or perfect ) sampling , ambiguities may occur due to the limited photometric precision . whether there are ambiguities or not for a given photometric precision depends on the distinctive features that are present in the light curve .",
