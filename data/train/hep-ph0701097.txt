    "considerable effort is made in the study of the energy loss of hard partons in the hot and dense medium created in ultrarelativistic heavy - ion collisions . in particular medium tomography ( i.e. gaining information about the medium density evolution ) by studying the nuclear suppression factor @xmath0 , the observed transverse momentum spectrum of hard hadrons divided by the scaled expectation from p - p collisions @xcite . however , as argued in @xcite , @xmath0 exhibits very limited sensitivity to the energy loss mechanism or properties of the medium beyond the fact that the quenching is substantial .",
    "if one makes the ansatz that the local quenching power @xmath3 of the medium can be written as a function of the local energy density @xmath4 as @xcite @xmath5^{3/4}$ ] where @xmath6 is evolution proper time , @xmath7 spacetime rapidity and @xmath8 radius of the medium , adjusting the scale parameter @xmath9 parametrizes both the coupling strength of the parton to the medium and uncertainties in the determination of the medium evolution ( see @xcite ) . in @xcite",
    "it was shown that there is about 50% uncertainty in the extraction of the medium quenching power ( given by @xmath9 ) from @xmath0 even for model evolutions which describe bulk soft matter properties ; a 2 + 1d hydrodynamical evolution @xcite , a 3 + 1d hydrodynamical evolution @xcite and a parametrized evolution @xcite .",
    "greater sensitivity to the medium density evolution can hence only be gained in more differential probes such as @xmath10-hadron correlations @xcite , @xmath0 for non - central collisions @xcite or back - to - back hadron correlations @xcite , here we focus on the latter .",
    "we make a monte carlo ( mc ) simulation of hard back - to - back processes in a medium in order to calculate the induced hard hadronic correlation pattern . the model is described in detail in @xcite .",
    "there are three main elements : 1 ) the primary hard pqcd process 2 ) the description of the soft medium and 3 ) the energy loss from hard to soft degrees of freedom coupling 1 ) and 2 ) .",
    "the energy loss for a given parton path is described in a probabilistic language . in order to determine the probability @xmath11 for a hard parton with energy @xmath12 to lose the energy @xmath13 while traversing the medium on its trajectory , we make use of a scaling law @xcite which allows to relate the dynamical scenario to a static equivalent one for each trajectory @xmath14 by calculating    @xmath15    as a function of the jet production vertex @xmath16 and its angular orientation @xmath17 .",
    "we set @xmath18 whenever the decoupling temperature of the medium @xmath19 is reached . using the numerical results of @xcite",
    ", we obtain @xmath20 for @xmath21 and @xmath22 as a function of jet production vertex and the angle @xmath17 .    from this , the probability distribution of energy loss reflected in single hadron observables ( such as @xmath0 )",
    "can be computed by averaging over all possible production points determined by the nuclear overlap as    @xmath23    the averaged energy loss probability underlying dihadron correlations involves a conditional probability of observing a high @xmath1 trigger hadron , hence it is more complicated and must be computed in the full mc simulation .",
    "we do the simulation generating hard pqcd back - to - back events inside the evolving bulk matter model , using eq .",
    "( [ e - omega ] ) to determine @xmath20 for each parton , followed by leading and next to leading fragmentation once the parton emerges from the medium @xcite . in all simulations ,",
    "the scale parameter @xmath9 is adjusted such that the measured @xmath0 is described well , thus we are only interested in information beyond what can be extracted from single hadron observables .",
    "we test six different spacetime evolution scenarios : 1 ) a 2 + 1d bjorken hydrodynamics simulation ( hydrodynamics ) 2 ) a 2 + 1 d bjorken hydrodynamics evolution in which quenching occurs only in the quark - gluon plasma phase ( black core ) , 3 ) a parametrized non - bjorken expansion with box density 4 ) a parametrized non - bjorken expansion with nuclear profile @xmath24 density 5 ) a bjorken expansion with box density and 6 ) a bjorken expansion with @xmath24 density @xcite . in this way",
    ", we represent a selection of different longitudinal and transverse dynamics .",
    "we compare the computed yield of associated hadrons as a function of momentum bin per trigger in the range @xmath25 gev on near and away side with the star data @xcite in fig .",
    "[ f - ypt8 ] .",
    "the near side is described well and there is broad agreement across all different medium models .",
    "the reason is that in all cases @xmath26 is dominated by either transmission without energy loss or complete absorption , the kinematic window to observe shifts in parton energy is very narrow .",
    "however , the probability distribution of experiencing a shift @xmath13 in energy is where tomographical information resides , thus , all scenarios appear similar for a small difference between trigger and associate @xmath1 .",
    "since the away side yield is determined by a different ( conditional ) probability @xmath27 the models exhibit more pronounced differences .",
    "all models fail in the momentum window between 4 and 6 gev to describe the data .",
    "this is presumably due to the fact that pqcd and fragmentation is not the dominant mechanism of hadron production in this momentum regime . within errors ,",
    "all scenarios except the black core one agree with the data above 6 gev associate momentum .",
    "the black core scenario is characterized by a very high quenching power ( 48 gev@xmath28/fm at @xmath6 = 1 fm / c ) in the center and a large halo out of which partons can escape unhindered . on the other hand",
    ", the hydrodynamics scenario shows less quenching power ( 11 gev@xmath28/fm at @xmath6 = 1 fm / c ) but has a larger extension .",
    "we show the origin of dihadrons in each model in fig .",
    "[ f - geo ] .",
    "it is evident that dihadron production in the black core scenario is peripheral while in the hydrodynamics scenario it occurs in the whole medium . from the fact that only one of these scenarios ( hydrodynamics ) describes the data",
    ", we can infer that the produced matter is not characterized by an opaque core and a dilute halo and that dihadron emission is not peripheral but probes indeed the central region of the medium .",
    "while this is some promising start , a larger lever arm in trigger @xmath1 would be needed to be sensitive to shifts in parton energy instead of just absorption and to get more tomographical information @xcite . recently",
    ", elastic energy loss has been suggested as an additional ingredient to describe the nuclear suppression @xcite . to the degree that the magnitude of this contribution is parametrically given by @xmath29 , these results place tight limits on the importance of collisional energy loss : since the integral has virtually no contribution from later times ( long paths ) , elastic energy loss can not resolve spatial structures larger than @xmath30 fm whereas the observed difference between near and away side yield relies on the fact that pathlength differences of the order of 5 fm or more are resolved .",
