    "direct - production of two hard photons in nucleon - nucleon collisions ( @xmath9 ) at intermediate energies , unlike production of single photons ( @xmath10 bremsstrahlung ) , is one of those fundamental processes which are still poorly explored both theoretically and experimentally .",
    "however , a study of this process can yield new important information on the underlying mechanisms of the @xmath10 interaction that is complementary to that obtained from investigations of other processes .",
    "in particular , the @xmath9 process can be used as a sensitive probe for experimental verification of the possible existence of @xmath10-decoupled nonstrange dibaryon resonances .",
    "these are two - baryon states @xmath11 with zero strangeness and exotic quantum numbers , for which the strong decay @xmath12 is either strictly forbidden by the pauli principle ( for the states with the isospin @xmath13 and with an even sum @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the orbital momentum and @xmath16 is the spin ) , or is strongly suppressed by the isospin selection rules ( for the states with @xmath17)@xcite .",
    "such dibaryon states can not be simple bound systems of two color - singlet nucleons , and a proof of their existence would have consequences of fundamental significance for the theory of strong interactions .",
    "the @xmath10-decoupled dibaryon states are predicted in a series of @xmath18-inspired models@xcite . among the predicted dibaryons ,",
    "there are those with masses both below and above the pion production ( @xmath19 ) threshold .",
    "the @xmath10-decoupled dibaryons with masses below the @xmath19 threshold are of special interest , since they may decay mainly into the @xmath20 state , and consequently , their widths should be very narrow ( @xmath21 ) .",
    "narrow dibaryon states have been searched for in a number of experiments@xcite , but none has provided any convincing evidence for their existence . most of the past searches , however , were limited to dibaryons coupled to the @xmath10 channel , and , to our knowledge , only a few were dedicated to the @xmath10-decoupled dibaryons@xcite . at the same time , since the dibaryons we are interested in do not couple to the @xmath10-channel , then , depending on their production and decay modes , they may have escaped detection up to now and may naturally appear in dedicated experiments .",
    "+ if the @xmath10-decoupled dibaryons exist in nature , then the @xmath9 process may proceed , at least partly , through the mechanism that directly involves the radiative excitation @xmath22 and decay @xmath23 modes of these states . in @xmath10 collisions at energies below the @xmath19 threshold ,",
    "these production and decay modes of the @xmath10-decoupled dibaryon resonances with masses @xmath24 would be unique or dominant .",
    "the simplest and clear way of revealing them is to measure the photon energy spectrum of the reaction @xmath9 .",
    "the presence of an @xmath10-decoupled dibaryon resonance would reveal itself in this energy spectrum as a narrow line associated with the formation of this resonance and a relatively broad peak originating from its three - particle decay .",
    "in the center - of - mass system , the position of the narrow line(@xmath25 ) is determined by the energy of colliding nucleons ( @xmath26 ) and the mass of this dibaryon resonance as @xmath27 .",
    "an essential feature of the two - photon production in @xmath10 collisions at an energy below the pion production threshold is that , apart from the resonant mechanism in question , there should only be one more source of photon pairs .",
    "this is the double @xmath10-bremsstrahlung reaction . but",
    "this reaction is expected to play a minor role .",
    "indeed , it involves two electromagnetic vertices , so that one may expect that the @xmath9-to-@xmath20 cross section ratio should be of the order of the fine structure constant @xmath28 .",
    "however , the cross section for @xmath20 is already small ( for example , the total @xmath29-bremsstrahlung cross section at energies of interest is a few @xmath30 ) .",
    "+ the process @xmath31 at an energy below the pion production threshold provides an unique possibility of searching for the @xmath10-decoupled dibaryon resonances in the mass region @xmath32 with quantum numbers @xmath33 ) or those with @xmath17 ( @xmath34 is the total spin , and @xmath35 is the parity of a dibaryon ) .",
    "the preliminary experimental studies of the reaction @xmath36 at an incident proton energy of about 200 mev@xcite showed that the photon energy spectrum of this reaction had a peculiar structure ranging from about 20 mev to about 60 mev .",
    "this structure was interpreted as an indication of the possible existence of an @xmath10-decoupled dibaryon resonance(later called @xmath6 ) that is produced in the process @xmath7 and subsequently decays via the @xmath8 channel .",
    "unfortunately , a relatively coarse energy resolution and low statistics did not allow us to distinguish the narrow @xmath0-peak associated with the @xmath6 production from the broad @xmath0-peak due to the decay of this resonance and , hence , to determine the resonance mass exactly . to get a rough estimate of the @xmath6 mass",
    ", we admitted that the expected narrow @xmath0-peak is positioned at the center of the observed structure and thus obtained @xmath37 mev .",
    "however , if the uncertainty in the position of the narrow @xmath0-peak in the structure is taken into account , the actual @xmath6 mass might be considerably different from such a crude estimate .",
    "the possible existence of this dibaryon resonance was also probed in the proton - proton bremsstrahlung data taken by the wasa / promice collaboration at the celsius accelerator@xcite for proton energies of 200 and 310 mev .",
    "however , the trigger used in those experimental studies to select events was designed and optimized for investigating the usual @xmath38 bremsstrahlung .",
    "the selected events were those corresponding to two simultaneously detected protons emerging in the forward direction at angles between @xmath39 and @xmath40 with respect to the beam axis , each of which had a kinetic energy exceeding the present threshold ( 40 mev ) .",
    "the analysis of those data resulted only in upper limits on the dibaryon production cross section in the mass range from 1900 to 1960 mev .",
    "therefore , to clarify the situation with the dibaryon resonance @xmath6 , we have decided to measure the energy spectrum of the @xmath41 reaction more carefully .",
    "the experiment was performed using the variable energy proton beam from the phasotron at the joint institute for nuclear research(jinr ) . the schematic layout of the experimental setup is shown in fig . 1 .",
    "is the monitor of the incident beam , @xmath42 is the target , @xmath43 and @xmath44 are the @xmath0-ray detectors , @xmath45 and @xmath46 are the plastic scintillators , @xmath47 and @xmath48 are the lead collimators , @xmath49 and @xmath50 are the polyethylene bars . at the top right of the figure the cross section of the @xmath0-ray detector @xmath43 is shown .",
    "@xmath51 is the central detector module and @xmath52 ( ring ) are the detector modules surrounding the detector module @xmath51.,width=80 ]    the pulsed proton beam ( bursts of about 7 ns fwhm separated by 70 ns ) with an energy of about 216 mev and an energy spread of about 1.5% bombarded a liquid hydrogen target ( @xmath42 ) .",
    "the average beam intensity was on the order of @xmath53 protons / s and was monitored by an ionization chamber ( @xmath54 ) .",
    "the liquid hydrogen target was a cylindrical cryogenic vessel with a length of about 5 cm ( @xmath55 ) and a diameter of 4.5 cm , which had thin entrance and exit windows made from 100 @xmath56 thick mylar foil .",
    "both @xmath0-quanta of the reaction @xmath57 were detected by two @xmath0-ray detectors ( @xmath43 and @xmath44 ) placed in a horizontal plane , symmetrically on either side of the beam at a laboratory angle of @xmath3 with respect to the beam direction .",
    "the @xmath0-detector @xmath43 was an array of seven individual detector modules ( see fig .",
    "1 ) : the central detector module ( @xmath51 ) and six detector modules ( @xmath58 ) surrounding the central detector module . each detector module was a 15 cm thick @xmath59 crystal having a hexagonal cross section with an outer diameter of 10 cm .",
    "the detector modules @xmath52 ( ring ) were designed to measure the energy of secondary particles and photons leaving the central detector module @xmath51 .",
    "thus , the energy of each photon detected by the detector @xmath43 was determined by summing up the energy deposited in the central detector module and the energies deposited in the detector modules of the ring . besides , the ring was used as an active shielding from cosmic ray muons .",
    "the shielding was based on the fact that a cosmic ray muon that passed through the detector @xmath43 should deposit an energy at least greater than 50 mev in the ring .",
    "the energy resolution of a single @xmath59 crystal was measured to be about 13% for @xmath60 mev .",
    "the second @xmath0-ray detector @xmath44 was a cylindrical @xmath61 crystal 15 cm in diameter and 10 cm in length .",
    "compared to the detector @xmath43 , it had a poorer energy resolution for @xmath0-rays with energies @xmath62 mev .",
    "the detector @xmath44 was mainly designed to select @xmath4 coincidence events . to reject events induced by charged particles , plastic scintillators ( @xmath45 and @xmath46 ) were put in front of each @xmath0-detector .",
    "both @xmath0-ray detectors were placed in lead houses with walls 10 cm thick which were in turn surrounded by a 5 cm borated parafin shield .",
    "the front wall of every lead house had an opening that served as a collimator ( @xmath47 and @xmath48 ) limiting the angle acceptance of the @xmath0-detector .",
    "the solid angles covered by the detectors @xmath43 and @xmath44 were 43 msr and 76 msr , respectively . to attenuate prompt particles coming from the target ,",
    "15 cm polyethylene bars ( @xmath49 and @xmath50 ) were placed in between the target and each @xmath0-detector .",
    "+ the electronics associated with the @xmath0-detectors and the plastic scintillators provided amplitude and time signals suitable for digitizing by an @xmath63 and a @xmath64 . the energy threshold for both the detector module @xmath51 and the @xmath0-detector @xmath44 was set at about 7 mev .",
    "the amplitude signals from the @xmath0-detectors were sent to the @xmath65 .",
    "the time signals from the @xmath0-detectors and the plastic scintillators were sent to the @xmath66 .",
    "in addition , the radio - frequency ( rf ) signals from the accelerator were also sent to the tdc .",
    "each of these signals was related with the time of arrival of the proton beam burst at the target .",
    "therefore , the time spectrum of the rf - signals provided the means to select those events which correlate with proton bursts .",
    "the time signal from the detector module @xmath51 started all the @xmath66 and opened the @xmath63 gates . in parallel , the time signals from the detector module @xmath51 and the @xmath0-detector @xmath44 were sent to a coincidence circuit to select those events which had signals from both the @xmath0-detectors within a 250 ns time interval .",
    "the data acquisition system was triggered by signals from the coincidence circuit and the corresponding events were recorded in the event - by - event mode on the hard disk of the computer .",
    "a further selection of @xmath4 coincidence candidate events was done during off - line data processing .",
    "the time interval of 250 ns was chosen to record two different types of events , `` prompt '' and `` delayed '' . a prompt event",
    "is that in which both photons are due to the same beam burst .",
    "such events may be attributed to either real @xmath4 events or to random coincidences .",
    "a delayed event is that in which photons are due to two different beam bursts , and , therefore , it must be attributed to a random coincidence .",
    "this type of events permits one to derive the component of random coincidences mixed with real prompt @xmath4 events .",
    "data were taken for the target filled with liquid hydrogen and for the empty one .",
    "the off - line analysis of both data sets was done in exactly the same way . the selection procedure for events associated with the process @xmath67 included the following main operations :    * rejection of events induced by charge particles coming from the target . for this purpose",
    ", all events having appropriate time information from any plastic scintillators were rejected .",
    "* rejection of events induced by cosmic ray muons .",
    "these events were rejected by a requirement that in every event the energy detected by the ring should not exceed 30 mev .",
    "the number of events induced by cosmic ray muons was found to be insignificant . *",
    "selection of events which are caused by proton beam bursts .",
    "this procedure was done with the help of a time spectrum of rf - signals .",
    "an example of this spectrum for a measurement with the full target is shown in fig .",
    "the time spectrum of rf - signals consisted of a peak of useful events superimposed on a background of events due to random coincidences .",
    "the time region confining the peak of useful events was determined , and events outside of this region were considered as a background and were rejected .",
    "+    * selection of events associated with @xmath4 coincidences . to do this",
    ", a spectrum of time signals from the detector @xmath44 ( coincidence time spectrum ) was used .",
    "a part of this spectrum for a measurement with the full target including the peak of prompt events and one of the peaks of delayed events is shown in fig .",
    "3 . the coincidence time spectrum consisted of the peak of prompt events and a few peaks of delayed events .",
    "the time region confining the prompt peak was determined , and events associated with it were considered as @xmath4 coincidence events and were accepted .",
    "data for the full and empty target were taken in two successive runs for @xmath6831 h and @xmath6821 h , respectively .",
    "the integrated luminosity of about @xmath69 was accumulated for the measurement with the full target .",
    "the resulting energy spectra of prompt @xmath4 events as a function of the photon energy measured by the detector @xmath43 for the full and the empty target are presented in fig .",
    "apart from real @xmath4 events , these spectra also contain the contributions due to random coincidences which were determined by using delayed events .",
    "such contributions to the full- and empty - target spectra were found to be identical within the statistical errors .",
    "the contribution of the random coincidence background to the empty - target spectrum of prompt @xmath4 events was less than 20% .",
    "the behavior of the empty - target spectrum is determined by photon pairs produced in collisions of protons with the mylar windows of the target vessel .",
    "since carbon is the major component of mylar , we also performed the measurement with the carbon target to make sure that the observed shape of the empty - target spectrum is due to the process @xmath70 .",
    "it was found that the empty- and carbon - target spectra have the same shape .",
    "the photon energy spectrum of the process @xmath67 obtained after subtraction of the empty target contribution is shown in fig .",
    "5 . as can be seen , this spectrum consists of a narrow peak at a photon energy of about 24 mev and a relatively broad peak in the energy range from about 50 to about 70 mev . the statistical significance expressed in the number of standard deviations ( n.s.d . ) was calculated for both the sharp and the broad peak using the expression @xmath71 , where @xmath72 and @xmath73 are the number of events and the error bar at the energy @xmath74 , respectively . as a result",
    ", we found that the number of standard deviations is equal to 5.3 for the narrow peak and to 3.5 for the broad peak .",
    "the width ( fwhm ) of the narrow peak was found to be about 8 mev .",
    "this width is comparable with that of the energy resolution of the experimental setup .",
    "it is important to note that the number of events in the narrow peak ( @xmath68 130 ) is approximately equal to half the total number of events in the spectrum ( @xmath68 250 ) .",
    "the observed behavior of the photon energy spectrum agrees with a characteristic signature of the sought dibaryon resonance @xmath6 that is formed and decays in the radiative process @xmath75 . in that case",
    "the narrow peak should be attributed to the formation of this dibaryon , while the broad peak should be assigned to its three - particle decay . using the value for the energy of the narrow peak @xmath76 mev",
    ", we obtained the @xmath6 mass @xmath77 mev .",
    "the uncertainty of the given value is primarily due to the uncertainties in the value of the proton beam momentum and the energy of the narrow @xmath0-peak .",
    "we estimate the total uncertainty in the @xmath6 mass to be @xmath78 mev .",
    "in such a way we obtain @xmath79 mev .",
    "this result is inconsistent with the rough estimate of the @xmath6 mass @xmath37 mev we obtained earlier@xcite .",
    "the results of the present experiment enable us to estimate the differential cross section of the resonance production of two photons in the process @xmath75 by the formula : @xmath80 where @xmath81 is the total number of events observed , @xmath15 is the luminosity , and @xmath82 and @xmath83 are the solid angles covered by the @xmath0-ray detectors .",
    "we found that at an energy of 216 mev this cross section for photons emitted symmetrically at @xmath84 is @xmath68 9 nb / sr@xmath85 .",
    "having assumed that the @xmath86 process with the @xmath6 mass of 1956 mev is the only mechanism of the reaction @xmath87 , we calculated the photon energy spectra of this reaction for a proton energy of 216 mev .",
    "it was also assumed that the radiative decay of the @xmath6 is a dipole @xmath88 transition from the two - baryon resonance state to a @xmath29-state in the continuum .",
    "the calculations were carried out with the help of monte carlo simulations which included the geometry and the energy resolution of the actual experimental setup .",
    "the photon energy spectra were calculated for two different scenarios of the @xmath6 decay .",
    "the difference between them was that one of these scenarios took into account the final state interaction ( @xmath89 ) of two outgoing protons whereas in the other that interaction was switched off .",
    "each of the scenarios imposed some restrictions on possible quantum numbers of the dibaryon state in question .",
    "the scenario including the @xmath89 implies that the final @xmath29-system is in the singlet @xmath90 state and consequently it should take place , in particular , for the isovector @xmath91 dibaryon state ( the simplest exotic quantum numbers ) , namely , @xmath92 .",
    "moreover such a scenario can take place for any isotensor dibaryon state with the exception of the @xmath93 or @xmath94 state . at the same time",
    ", the scenario in which the @xmath89 is switched off , is most likely to occur for the isotensor @xmath95 dibaryon state .",
    "the spectra calculated for these two decay scenarios and normalized to the total number of @xmath4 events observed in the present experiment are shown in fig.5 .",
    "comparison of these spectra with the experimental spectrum indicates that both the calculated spectra are in reasonable agreement with the experimental one within experimental uncertainties . in other words ,",
    "the statistics of the experiment is insufficient to draw any firm conclusions in favor of one of these scenarios and thereby to limit possible quantum numbers of the observed dibaryon state . in this connection",
    ", we would like to emphasize that the experimental data on the process @xmath96 can shed some light on the properties of the dibaryon state we have observed .",
    "the point is that the @xmath6 dibaryon can in principle be excited in this process via the mode @xmath97 .",
    "however , excitation of the dibaryon @xmath98 with isospin @xmath99 is allowed by the isospin selection rules , whereas excitation of the isotensor @xmath100 resonance is expected to be strongly suppressed@xcite .",
    "therefore , the preliminary results of the study of the reaction @xmath96 carried out by the rmc collaboration at triumf@xcite indicating no enhancement of the two - photon yield in the process @xmath101 compared to the usual one - nucleon mechanism @xmath102 on the proton bound in the deuteron may imply that the @xmath98 dibaryon has isospin 2 .    finally ,",
    "as we have already mentioned in the introduction , the presence of the @xmath103 process was sought in the uppsala @xmath29-bremsstrahlung data@xcite .",
    "based on the detailed data analysis the authors@xcite conclude that they have found no evidence for a dibaryon in the mass range from 1900 to 1960 mev .",
    "there is , however , one important feature of the process in question which was omitted in ref.@xcite .",
    "it is related to the angular distribution of protons from the dibaryon decay @xmath104 .",
    "the authors@xcite assumed that such a distribution is isotropic in the center - of - mass system of the reaction .",
    "however , that is not the case . to understand the angular distribution of the protons from the process",
    "@xmath105 we performed phase space calculations using the cern code@xcite .",
    "the calculations were done for two possible decay modes of the dibaryon .",
    "one is the dibaryon decay to the singlet @xmath90 two - proton state ( @xmath106 ) .",
    "it is allowed , for instance , for @xmath6 with quantum numbers @xmath107 or @xmath108 .",
    "the second implies that the dibaryon decays to any other two - proton state .",
    "it was also assumed that the @xmath0-radiation from the given process has a dipole character .",
    "the results of the calculations ( in the laboratory ) for an incident energy of 310 mev and for the case when the polar angle of observed photons was constrained to the range between @xmath109 and @xmath3 ( @xmath0-ray detector arrangement in the uppsala experiment ) are shown in fig.6 .",
    "the same calculations done at 200 mev led to similar results .",
    "as can be seen from fig.6 , the protons from the process @xmath110 are mainly concentrated in a narrow angular cone at @xmath111 . since in the uppsala experiment events",
    "were only accepted if the polar angle of each proton fell within a forward cone between @xmath39 and @xmath40 , the dominant portion of events associated with the given process was beyond this angular range and , hence , were not present in the analyzed data@xcite .",
    "in other words , if we assume that the @xmath112 has quantum numbers such as @xmath107 or @xmath108 , then these data can contain only such events from the process @xmath113 in which both final protons are associated with the tail of the angular distribution presented in fig.6 .",
    "our naive estimations have shown that the fraction of these events in the data@xcite for 200 mev and 310 mev with respect to the corresponding total number of events from the process of interest are approximately smaller than 20% and 2% , respectively .",
    "these estimates together with the differential cross section ( @xmath114 obtained in the present experiment permitted us , in turn , to estimate the expected number of events in the uppsala experiment .",
    "the corresponding values for the measurements at 200 mev and 310 mev are equal to @xmath682 and @xmath68130 , respectively .",
    "it was assumed in those calculations that the energy dependence of the cross section is @xmath115 ( dipole radiation ) , where @xmath116 .",
    "our estimate for 200 mev is in agreement with the corresponding null result obtained in the uppsala measurements . as for the result at 310 mev , we would like to note the following .",
    "first , the experimental sensitivity of the data@xcite at 310 mev to the process in question was limited by a large background stemming from @xmath117 decays .",
    "we found that cuts applied in ref.@xcite to remove this background reduced the number of dibaryon candidates observed by a factor of @xmath683 .",
    "second , the presence of a narrow dibaryon should appear in the @xmath118 invariant mass spectrum as a sharp peak and a wider one ( mirror ) that arises because of the @xmath118 invariant mass calculation with a photon originating from a dibaryon production .",
    "the authors@xcite believed that inside a range of dibaryon masses from 1900 to 1960 mev these peaks would be well separated from one another .",
    "therefore , as a signal for dibaryon production they hoped to observe a sharp peak @xmath685 mev wide . to find the invariant mass distribution of @xmath118 events from the @xmath105 process at 310 mev we performed a monte carlo simulation of the wasa / promice experimental setup .",
    "it appeared that a broad mirror and a sharp peak merge in this distribution and it consists of one wide peak extending from @xmath681943 to @xmath681968 mev .",
    "we think that in ref.@xcite such a peak could be overlooked .",
    "of course , the estimates obtained for the expected number of events in the uppsala experiment are very approximate . to make more precise estimates it is desirable to have a consistent description of the @xmath119 process .",
    "the @xmath0-ray energy spectrum for the @xmath67 reaction at a proton energy below the pion production threshold has been measured for the first time . the spectrum measured at an energy of about 216 mev for coincident photons emitted at an angle of @xmath3 in the laboratory frame clearly evidences the existence of the @xmath10-decoupled dibaryon resonance @xmath6 with a mass of @xmath120 mev that is formed and decays in the process @xmath75 .",
    "the data we have obtained , however , are still incomplete , and additional careful studies of the reaction @xmath121 are needed to get proper parameters ( mass , width , spin , etc . ) of the observed dibaryon state",

    "<S> the energy spectrum for high energy @xmath0-rays ( @xmath1 mev ) from the process @xmath2 emitted at @xmath3 in the laboratory frame has been measured at an energy below the pion production threshold , namely , at 216 mev . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting photon energy spectrum extracted from @xmath4 coincidence events consists of a narrow peak at a photon energy of about 24 mev and a relatively broad peak in the energy range of ( 50 - 70 ) mev . </S>",
    "<S> the statistical significances for the narrow and broad peaks are 5.3@xmath5 and 3.5@xmath5 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> this behavior of the photon energy spectrum is interpreted as a signature of the exotic dibaryon resonance @xmath6 with a mass of about 1956 mev which is assumed to be formed in the radiative process @xmath7 followed by its electromagnetic decay via the @xmath8 mode . </S>",
    "<S> the experimental spectrum is compared with those obtained by means of monte carlo simulations . </S>"
