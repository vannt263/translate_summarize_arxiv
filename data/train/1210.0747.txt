    "this advantage allows us to describe the motion of micro - robots in greater depth .    in this paper",
    ", we study the self - propulsion of a triangular three - sphere micro - robot ( we call it @xmath0-robot ) , see the figure .",
    "we formulate the problem for a @xmath0-robot with arbitrary sides , but the final expressions are presented only for the case when all mean sides are equal .",
    "our calculations show that the @xmath0-robot rotates with constant angular velocity @xmath1 around its centroid , while the centroid itself moves along a circle with the same angular velocity @xmath1 .",
    "the important special case of @xmath2 represents rectilinear translational self - propulsion with constant velocities . to obtain these results",
    "we employ the two - timing method and distinguished limit arguments , which lead to a simple and rigorous analytical procedure .",
    "our approach is technically different from all previous methods employed in the studies of micro - robots ( except @xcite ) .",
    "the possibility to describe explicitly any motion of a @xmath0-robot shows the strength of our method .",
    "the used version of the two - timing method has been developed in @xcite .",
    "[ 3-robot ]",
    "we consider the @xmath0-robot consisting of three rigid spheres of equal radii @xmath3 connected by three rods of different lengths @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and @xmath6 . in plane cartesian",
    "coordinates @xmath7 the centers of the spheres are @xmath8 , @xmath9 and the triangle ( with vertices in centres of spheres ) is composed of vectors @xmath10 , @xmath11 , and @xmath12 , see the figure .",
    "we describe the centers of the spheres as @xmath13 where @xmath14 is a centroid radius - vector such that vectors @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , unit vectors @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and angles @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 are introduced as @xmath24 well - known relations between the sides and medians of a triangle yield @xmath25 see @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0-robot moves due to the prescribed oscillations of the sides @xmath26 where @xmath27 @xmath28 ; @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 are mean lengths , and @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 are @xmath35-periodic functions of @xmath36 with zero average values .",
    "the spheres experience external friction forces @xmath37 , while the rods are so thin in comparison with @xmath3 , that their interaction with a fluid is negligible .",
    "the considered problem contains three characteristic lengths : the length of rods @xmath38 , the radius of spheres @xmath3 , and the amplitude of rod s oscillations @xmath39 .",
    "the characteristic time - scale is @xmath40 and the characteristic force is @xmath41 .",
    "we have chosen @xmath42 where @xmath43 is viscosity of a fluid .",
    "two independent small parameters are @xmath44 the dimensionless variables ( marked with asterisks ) are chosen as @xmath45 below we use only dimensionless variables , however all asterisks are omitted .",
    "the form of a triangle is completely prescribed by three lengths @xmath46 or , alternatively , by three lengths @xmath47 ( [ abc - units]),([klmabc ] ) .",
    "we choose generalised coordinates as @xmath48 the choice @xmath47 as generalised coordinates drastically simplifies further calculations .",
    "the motion of the @xmath0-robot is described by the lagrangian function @xmath49 , which includes constraints ( [ constraints ] ) with lagrangian multipliers @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 @xmath53 where subscript @xmath54 stands for @xmath55 , given functions @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath58",
    "correspond to @xmath59 , @xmath59 , @xmath60 in ( [ constraints]),([klmabc ] ) , and @xmath61 is kinetic energy of a robot .",
    "lagrangian multipliers represent additional unknown functions of time .",
    "the lagrange equations are @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the generalized external force , exerted by a fluid on the @xmath0-robot .",
    "as one can see , we use latin subscripts ( @xmath64 ) for cartesian components of vectors and tensors , subscript @xmath65 for generalised coordinates , and subscripts ( or superscripts ) @xmath66 to identify the spheres . the fluid flow past the @xmath0-robot",
    "is described by the stokes equations , where all inertial effects are neglected . since masses of spheres and rods",
    "are negligible , then @xmath67 .",
    "hence , ( [ lagr - contstr]),([lagr - eqns]),([abc]),([abc - units ] ) produce the system of equations @xmath68_\\bot=0\\label{sum - torques}\\\\ & & { \\boldsymbol{a}}\\cdot{\\boldsymbol{f}}^{(1)}=-\\alpha\\ , a,\\quad { \\boldsymbol{b}}\\cdot{\\boldsymbol{f}}^{(2)}=-\\beta\\ , b,\\quad { \\boldsymbol{c}}\\cdot{\\boldsymbol{f}}^{(3)}=-\\gamma\\ , c\\label{eqns - reactions}\\\\ & & a=\\breve{a},\\quad b=\\breve{b},\\quad c=\\breve{c}\\label{eqns - constrs}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the subscript @xmath69 stands for a perpendicular to @xmath7-plane component of a vector .",
    "one can see that for chosen generalised coordinates the lagrangian equations appear as zero total force ( [ sum - forces ] ) and zero total torque ( [ sum - torques ] ) .",
    "the explicit expressions for @xmath70 are @xmath71 each force @xmath70 represents the first approximation for the stokes friction force exerted on a sphere moving in the flow generated by other two spheres . to construct ( [ forces - stokes ] )",
    "we use a classical explicit formula for fluid velocity past a moving sphere , see @xcite .",
    "the equations ( [ sum - forces])-([forces - stokes ] ) represent a system of nine equations for nine unknown functions of time :  @xmath72 , @xmath73 , @xmath21 , @xmath39 , @xmath74 , @xmath75 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 , and @xmath52 .",
    "it is well known from analytical mechanics that lagrangian multipliers represent the reactions of constraints ; hence the equations ( [ eqns - reactions ] ) can be kept out of consideration if we are not interested in the forces exerted by rods .",
    "since the explicit form of system ( [ sum - forces])-([forces - stokes ] ) is rather cumbersome , we restrict ourselves to the special case of an equilateral mean triangle @xmath76 . using ( [ abc ] )",

    "a unique decomposition @xmath91 is valid .",
    "the introduction of fast time variable @xmath36 and slow time variable @xmath78 represents a crucial step in our asymptotic procedure .",
    "we choose @xmath92 and @xmath93 .",
    "this choice can be justified by the same distinguished limit arguments as in @xcite . here",
    "we present this choice without proof , however the most important part of this proof ( that this choice leads to a valid asymptotic procedure ) is exposed and exploited below .",
    "we use the chain rule @xmath94 and then we accept ( temporarily ) that @xmath36 and @xmath78 represent two independent variables . in",
    "further consideration we consider series in small parameter @xmath95 and restrict our attention to the terms @xmath96 .",
    "simultaneously we keep at most linear terms in @xmath97 . in our theory @xmath97",
    "appears not separately but as products such as @xmath98 .",
    "we do not specify the dependence of unknown functions on @xmath97 ; such dependence reveals itself naturally during calculations .",
    "unknown functions are taken as regular series @xmath99 and similar series for @xmath21 , @xmath39 , @xmath74 , @xmath75 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 , and @xmath52 .",
    "we take @xmath100 which express the basic property of our solutions : long distances of self - swimming and large angles of rotations are caused by small oscillations .",
    "we also have accepted @xmath101 for an equilateral triangle .",
    "after the application of ( [ chain ] ) to ( [ x - f - ser ] ) we have @xmath102 and similar expression for @xmath21 . in calculations below all the bar functions",
    "belong to the zero approximation and all the tilde - functions belong to the first approximation , therefore we omit the related subscripts .",
    "the successive approximations of equations ( [ forces - iso]),([torq - iso ] ) yield :    _ terms _ @xmath103 give identities @xmath104 .",
    "_ terms _ @xmath105 lead to @xmath106 where the second equation follows from @xmath107_\\bot=0 \\label{torq - iso-1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and definitions ( [ abc - units ] ) .",
    "the integration of ( [ first - order ] ) in the class of periodic functions yields @xmath108 from the law of cosines one can derive that @xmath109 and @xmath110 , then ( [ first - order-1 ] ) gives @xmath111 _ terms _ @xmath112 : these terms do not vanish and can be easily calculated .",
    "however , ( as one can see below ) they do not participate in the leading terms of average motion that appear in the order @xmath96 .",
    "_ terms _ @xmath96 : eqns.([forces - iso]),([torq - iso ] ) give @xmath113_\\bot= \\langle\\left[\\widetilde{{\\boldsymbol{a}}}\\times\\widetilde{{\\boldsymbol{a}}}_{\\tau}+\\widetilde{{\\boldsymbol{b}}}\\times\\widetilde{{\\boldsymbol{b}}}_{\\tau}+ \\widetilde{{\\boldsymbol{c}}}\\times\\widetilde{{\\boldsymbol{c}}}_{\\tau}\\right]_\\bot\\rangle \\label{eqn - theta-2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] from these equations one can already see that the leading terms @xmath114 and @xmath115 . in further calculations",
    "all tilde - functions , say , @xmath116 should be expressed in terms of @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 with the use of ( [ abc]),([abc - units ] ) .",
    "then straightforward but rather cumbersome transformations of ( [ eqn - x-2 ] ) yield @xmath117 where unit vectors @xmath118 , @xmath119 , and @xmath120 correspond to @xmath21-derivatives of @xmath18 , @xmath19 , and @xmath20 , say , @xmath121 one can check that expressions ( [ eqn - x-3]),([eqn - theta-3 ] ) possess a relabeling invariance @xmath122 , _ etc_. the final expressions are @xmath123 with constants @xmath124 , @xmath125 , and @xmath1 .",
    "it is also useful to exclude @xmath6 by introducing the angle @xmath126 between the sides @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "the law of cosines gives @xmath127 ; its substitution to ( [ a - b]),([d ] ) yields @xmath128 both equations ( [ eqn - x - theta ] ) can be immediately integrated as @xmath129 with constants of integration @xmath130 , @xmath131 , and @xmath132 .",
    "finally , we should recall that @xmath78 is slow time variable , hence physical translational velocity and angular velocity are @xmath133 for dimensional velocities @xmath134 and @xmath1 one has to add multipliers @xmath135 and @xmath136 correspondingly ( see ( [ scales ] ) ) .",
    "it is noticeable that @xmath134 and @xmath1 have different amplitudes : @xmath137 , but @xmath138 .",
    "it corresponds to an important physical fact : translational self - propulsion of a @xmath0-robot takes place due to hydrodynamic interactions between spheres , while rotational self - propulsion does exist without taking such interactions into account .",
    "eqns.([circle ] ) show that the @xmath0-robot rotates with constant angular velocity @xmath1 around its own centroid and simultaneously moves with the same angular velocity @xmath1 in a circular orbit of radius @xmath139 and centered at the point @xmath140 , which can be defined from the initial data .",
    "the condition for motion ( [ eqn - x - theta ] ) to be purely translational is @xmath141 ; it could be really useful for practical applications .",
    "the related absolute value of translational velocity is @xmath142 provides options for purely translational ( rectilinear ) motion .",
    "the simplest cases correspond to isosceles oscillations , when @xmath143 or @xmath144 or @xmath145 .",
    "for example , @xmath143 gives @xmath146 which coincides with the translational self - swimming of a @xmath147-robot by @xcite .",
    "however , in @xcite the mean angle between the arms of a @xmath147-robot is arbitrary , while everywhere in this paper it is @xmath148 .",
    "hence , the results of @xcite are complementary to the study done in this paper .",
    "it is also worth to emphasise that variables and the method of calculation in @xcite are different , hence the obtaining of the same result strongly suggests that the calculations of this paper do not contain mistakes .",
    "another case of rectilinear motion is @xmath149 , which corresponds to a fixed angle between the sides @xmath4 and @xmath5 , while @xmath150 and @xmath151 . from ( [ d1 ] )",
    "one can see that in this case @xmath152 , @xmath153 , and @xmath154 .",
    "it gives velocity @xmath155 , which shows that the @xmath0-robot is not rotating but propagating in direction @xmath156 .",
    "this example can be seen as generalization of the micro - swimmer by @xcite for a fixed angle @xmath148 between the arms .",
    "similarly , the examples of pure rotation ( without translation ) can be build .",
    "\\(i ) we have derived that for any oscillations of three sides of the considered @xmath0-robot the averaged paths of each sphere represent circles with centers that move in circles ( [ circle ] ) .",
    "that is , the paths of each sphere are epicycloids .",
    "following other examples in fluid dynamics ( see @xcite ) one can call these paths _ ptolemaic solutions_.",
    "\\(ii ) the magnitude @xmath157 of translational velocity in terms of small parameters ( [ eqn - x - final]),([v ] ) is the same as the result by @xcite for linear micro - robots . at the same time",
    ", our choice of slow time @xmath93 ( [ chain ] ) agrees with classical studies of self - propulsion for low reynolds numbers , see @xcite , as well as the geometric studies of @xcite .",
    "\\(iii ) the magnitude @xmath96 for angular velocity ( [ eqn - x - final ] ) represents a novel result .",
    "it corresponds to an important physical fact : rotational self - propulsion does exist without taking hydrodynamic interactions between spheres into account ; it caused by standard stokes drag force in an infinite fluid and the reactions of constraints .",
    "\\(iv ) we have built an asymptotic procedure with two small parameters : @xmath158 and @xmath159 .",
    "such a setting usually requires the consideration of different asymptotic paths on the plane @xmath160 when , say @xmath161 . in our case",
    "we can avoid it , since @xmath97 does not appear separately , but only in combinations such as @xmath98 .",
    "\\(v ) the mathematical justification of the presented results can be performed by the estimation of an error in the original equation , as in @xcite .",
    "it is also possible to derive the higher approximations of @xmath134 and @xmath1 , as it has been done by @xcite for different cases .",
    "these approximations can be useful to study the cases when self - propulsion in the main order vanishes .",
    "\\(vi ) in order to compare velocities of micro - robots and micro - organisms we use dimensional variables , where @xmath162 ; it shows that a @xmath0-robot can move itself with the speed about @xmath163 of its own size per second ( we have taken @xmath164 and @xmath165 ; the value of @xmath136 can be found in @xcite . from these papers",
    "we also can see that this estimation of self - propulsion velocity is about @xmath166 times lower than a similar value for natural micro - swimmers .",
