    "linear polarization of starlight provides a powerful technique for investigating the nature of the interstellar medium .",
    "interstellar dust particles aligned to the galactic magnetic field produce interstellar polarization , which is one of the main sources of stellar linear polarization .",
    "studies of this polarization provide information on the dust distribution and magnetic field structure ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and on the nature and size of the dust particles @xcite .",
    "studies of the polarization of stars close to the sun have been made by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "they found very little polarization in neraby stars .",
    "@xcite found only 25 stars with definite polarization in a survey of 1000 stars within 50pc .",
    "subsequent analysis showed that almost all of these polarized stars were actually at greater distances when more accurate hipparcos parallaxes became available @xcite , and that significant interstellar polarization became detectable at distances of about 70pc in some directions and at 150pc in others .",
    "@xcite have also reported observations of polarization of southern hemisphere stars , that they attribute to the wall of the local bubble at @xmath0100 pc distance .",
    "all of these studies used polarization measurements with accuracies of , at best , @xmath010@xmath6 in fractional polarization .",
    "recently we have built and tested a new polarimeter , planetpol , @xcite capable of measuring stellar linear polarization at the parts per million level .",
    "here we report observations of a sample of nearby bright stars measured to sensitivies of generally better than 3 @xmath7 10@xmath8 and in some cases to better than 1 @xmath4 in fractional polarization .",
    "this represents an improvement of a factor of 20 to 100 on previous measurements .",
    "in addition to the use of polarization to probe the interstellar medium , it is of interest to know at what level normal stars show intrinsic polarization . there is currently considerable interest in using polarization to study extrasolar planets .",
    "polarization can be used to directly detect unresolved hot - jupiter type planets @xcite , as a differential technique to detect planets in imaging observations @xcite , and as a means of characterizing extrasolar planet atmospheres @xcite .",
    "significant polarization from the host star could complicate such observations . in the case of the quiet sun direct observations by @xcite show linear polarization of @xmath9 .",
    "however , more active stars could show higher polarizations , and polarization might also result from exozodiacal disks around the stars .",
    "[ cols= \" < , < , > , < , > , > , > , > , > , > \" , ]     [ tab_spc ]      the spatial distribution of the observed polarizations is shown in figures [ fig_pos ] and [ fig_radec ] .",
    "the distribution is quite striking .",
    "figure [ fig_pos ] shows that there is very little polarization in the ra range 10 to 16 hours , and that most of the high polarizations are found in the range 16 to 20 hours . within this ra range",
    "there is a strong correlation with distance , with the highest polarizations being found at the greatest distances .    in figure [ fig_radec ]",
    "it can be seen that the high polarizations correspond to lower galactic latitudes .",
    "stars around the galactic pole have generally low polarizations and substantial polarizations begin to appear for galactic latitudes below about 40 degrees .",
    "it is also apparent from the polarization vectors that the position angles are not random , but show a tendency for the polarization direction to be along lines of galactic latitude .",
    "this implies a galactic magnetic field in the solar vicinity that lies in the galactic plane .",
    "these correlations with position strongly suggest that the bulk of the polarization being observed is interstellar in origin , and not intrinsic to the stars .",
    "17h and open symbols are stars with ra @xmath2 17h .",
    "the dot - dash line shows the polarization versus distance relation for distant stars and the dash and dotted lines are relationships with 10 and a 100 times less polarization per parsec .",
    "the lower panel is an expanded view of the data for stars with ra @xmath217h .",
    "the solid line is the least squares fit to the data excluding regulus and bs 6092,width=317 ]    figure [ fig_dist ] shows the variation of polarization with distance",
    ". studies of the interstellar polarization of more distant stars have shown that fractional polarization increases with distance at about 2 @xmath7 10@xmath10 pc@xmath11 @xcite .",
    "the studies of @xcite and @xcite have shown that the polarization of nearby stars is less than would be expected from this relationship .",
    "figure [ fig_dist ] shows just how low polarizations near the sun are compared with this relationship .",
    "the open circles on this figure , which represent stars at ra less than 17h and corresponds to regions around the north galactic pole , actually fit a relationship of about 2 @xmath7 10@xmath12 pc@xmath11 , about 100 times less than that for distant stars .",
    "this indicates that the interstellar medium in this direction has about a factor of 100 less dust than the typical value for the interstellar medium in the galactic plane .",
    "the lower panel of figure [ fig_dist ] shows an expanded view of the polarization data for ra @xmath217h .",
    "the polarization data used in figure 4 have been debiased by plotting @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the error in polarization given in table [ tab_results ] .",
    "this is a standard method of correcting for the fact that polarization values are always positive and can therefore be significantly biased toward larger values where p is comparable with @xmath14 . even at these low polarization levels",
    "there is an indication that polarization increases with distance .",
    "the solid line in the lower panel of figure 4 is the least squares fit to the data ( excluding regulus and bs 6092 ) .",
    "the correlation coefficient is 0.469 and the probability of this occurring by chance is less than 2% .",
    "this demonstrates that even in this low polarization region we are seeing a contribution from interstellar polarization .",
    "it does not rule out small amounts of polarization from other sources , but neither are other mechanisms required .",
    "an imperfect correlation with distance is expected due to the patchy nature of the density of the interstellar medium .    in the region nearer the galactic plane shown by the solid symbols in figure [ fig_dist ] the polarizations are higher and some measurements fit an increase with distance of about 2 @xmath7 10@xmath8 pc@xmath11 about a factor 10 less than the value for distant stars .",
    "however , many points fall well below this line suggesting that the dust in this region is very clumpy .",
    "polarization is related to the amount of interstellar dust along the line of sight .",
    "however , the degree of polarization will also depend on the efficiency of grain alignment , and on the angle of the magnetic field to the line of sight .",
    "the relationship between polarization and extinction @xmath15 for more distant stars , shows that the maximum polarization is given by @xmath16 @xcite , corresponding to maximum grain alignment , but actual values show a great deal of scatter and can fall well below this maximum value . @xcite",
    "give a mean relationship of @xmath17 .",
    "if we apply this relationship to the two lower lines shown on figure [ fig_dist ] , then the lines correspond to a @xmath15 = 0.00157 at 100 pc for the line that roughly fits the galactic plane polarizations , and @xmath15 = 0.000037 at 100 pc for the lower line that fits the galactic pole polarizations .",
    "these @xmath15 values are well below those that can actually be measured by photometry",
    ".    the relationship between polarization and angle to the line of sight should lead to a polarization that depends on galactic longitude .",
    "this is difficult to test with our data , since the stars near the galactic plane are restricted to a small range of galactic longitude .",
    "a more extensive survey , might reveal such effects .",
    "the distribution of polarization we observe is consistent with other data on the local interstellar medium that shows the presence of a local cavity or local bubble in the solar vicinity @xcite .",
    "for example , studies of the 3d distribution of interstellar gas using na i d line absorption @xcite , show little interstellar gas near the sun and towards the north galactic pole , but show that significant gas is detected quite close to the sun ( @xmath050 pc ) in the galactic plane between galactic longitudes 0 and 90 , the direction in which we see the largest polarizations .",
    "this suggests that the distribution of dust shown by the polarization is similar to the gas distribution revealed by the na i absorption measurements .",
    "a similar distribution of interstellar material is shown in the local hot bubble ( lhb ) revealed in soft x - ray background observations @xcite which appears to lie within the cavity seen in na i absorption .",
    "our polarization observations confirm the presence of a local cavity with little interstellar material within 100pc of the sun , but nevertheless suggest that there is some interstellar dust within this region that can be detected by high - sensitivity polarimetry .",
    "it is less clear whether the polarization observations define a sharp edge to the local cavity .",
    "the large polarizations observed for bs 7405 and bs 6092 , two of the most distant stars in our sample , may be indicative of such an edge , but there are too few stars at this distance to determine if such polarizations are typical of this distance ( @xmath090 pc ) .",
    "we are also unable to directly look at correlations between polarization and sodium absorption on an individual sight line basis , as there is only one star common to our sample and the na i observations of @xcite and @xcite , and this star has both small polarization and no significant d line absorption .",
    "while we can not directly compare with na i d line absorption , there are a number of measurements of ca ii h&k absorption for nearby early - type stars included in our sample .",
    "ca ii absorption is seen in sight lines towards nearby stars that do not show significant neutral gas as seen in na i absorption .",
    "the ca ii absorption is thought to result from warmer gas present in the local cavity . in many cases",
    "there are several distinct velocity components seen in the caii absorption indicating the presence of discrete clouds . in figure [ fig_ca2 ]",
    "we show ca ii column density for nine stars from our sample .",
    "the caii data are taken from @xcite and are originally from @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite . where multiple velocity components are observed , the column density has been summed over all components .",
    "figure [ fig_ca2 ] shows a slight tendency for higher ca ii column densities at higher polarizations , but there is much scatter and no strong correlation .",
    "this suggests that the dust responsible for the polarization is not located in the clouds responsible for the ca ii absorption .",
    "bs 3982 ( regulus ) stands out as having a high polarization compared with stars in its ra range despite being at a relatively small distance of 23.8pc .",
    "two observations of its polarization in 2005 april and 2006 february are in excellent agreement .",
    "regulus is known to be a rapidly rotating b star , and its rotational flattening has been measured directly by interferometry . @xcite",
    "used the chara array to determine the rotational flattening of regulus and derive a position angle of the minor axis of 85.5 @xmath18 2.8 degrees .",
    "this is in agreement with our measured polarization position angle of 78.9 @xmath180.8 degrees .",
    "a rotationally flattened early type star is expected to show polarization as a result of electron scattering in its non - spherically symmetric atmosphere .",
    "@xcite calculates the polarization expected in rapidly rotating b stars .",
    "the polarization is parallel to the rotation axis at red wavelengths as observed for regulus .",
    "the degree of polarization decreases with spectral subclass from about 0.01% ( 100 @xmath7 10@xmath8 ) at b2 to about 0.005% ( 50 @xmath7 10@xmath8 ) at b5 , the latest spectral class modelled .",
    "our measured polarization for regulus ( b7 ) of 36.7 @xmath7 10@xmath8 is therefore in good agreement with these calculations .",
    "however , @xcite calculates the polarization for a star rotating with 95% of its critical velocity for break - up , whereas according to @xcite regulus is only rotating at 86% of its critical velocity .",
    "it is therefore important to carry out polarization calculations for rapidly rotating stars that include a wider range of parameters .",
    "however , the fact that we see unusual polarization for regulus , and this star stands out in our sample as having both rapid rotation and an early spectral type ( needed to give an electron scattering atmosphere ) , strongly suggests that the polarization arises from rotational flattening .",
    "if this interpretation is correct it would be the first observation of this effect .",
    "bs 7001 ( vega ) shows a polarization of 17.2 @xmath18 1.0 @xmath7 10@xmath8 at a position angle of 34.5 @xmath18 1.4 degrees .",
    "vega is known to possess a debris disk detected by its infrared excess @xcite .",
    "scattering of light from dust in the disk is therefore a potential source of polarization , as has been observed in the case of the beta pictoris disk @xcite .",
    "however , the vega disk is large .",
    "spitzer observations show it extending out to 105 arc seconds at 160 @xmath19 m @xcite and it is circular indicating that the disk is seen face - on .",
    "the spitzer observations also indicate an inner radius for the disk of 11 @xmath18 2 arc seconds .",
    "since the planetpol observations used an aperture of 5 arc seconds this would mean that the observations did not include the disk .",
    "however , there is also evidence for circumstellar material within 1 arc second of vega @xcite .",
    "the face - on nature of the system is supported by interferometric observations of vega that show it to be a rapidly rotating star seen almost pole - on @xcite , with an inclination measured to be 4.7 @xmath18 0.3 @xcite or 4.55 @xmath18 0.33 degrees @xcite .",
    "there have been no detections of the vega disk in scattered light .",
    "@xcite attempted to detect scattered light through polarization at distances of 7 to 30 arc seconds for the star , and detected no polarization with limits about 200 times lower than the disk of beta pic .",
    "a face - on disk with material symmetrically distributed around the star would not be expected to show any polarization in observations centered on the star .",
    "thus our observed polarization could only result from the circumstellar disk if there is an asymmetric distribution of circumstellar material close to the star .",
    "an alternative explanation of the vega polarization is that it is interstellar in origin .",
    "this may seem unlikely for a star at a distance of only 7.8 pc .",
    "however , vega is located in the region of the sky where we see the largest interstellar polarizations .",
    "the polarization would correspond to 2.2 @xmath7 10@xmath8 pc@xmath11 , which is similar to that seen in more distant stars in this ra range , as seen in figure [ fig_dist ] .",
    "the position angle of 35 degrees is similar to that of other stars in the region .",
    "@xcite has argued that the weak polarization of nearby stars observed by @xcite could be due to interstellar dust entrained in the magnetic wall of the heliosphere .",
    "this was based on the presence of a spatial distribution of polarization that was related to ecliptic coordinates , and the absence of a significant distance dependence of the polarization .",
    "our results do not support this interpretation for polarization of nearby stars .",
    "figures [ fig_pos ] and [ fig_dist ] show clearly that polarization is correlated with distance and that the dust responsible must therefore be widely distributed over the 100 pc scale covered by our observations .",
    "polarization measurements of a sample of 49 nearby bright stars have been measured to accuracies about 20 to 100 times better than those of any previous measurements .",
    "in contrast to previous observations which have generally been unable to detect many polarized stars at these distances , we find significant polarization in many of the stars . the polarization increases with distance and shows much higher values at low galactic latitudes than towards the galactic pole .",
    "the distribution of polarization strongly suggests that the high polarization stars and probably most of the lower polarization stars , are showing interstellar polarization .",
    "the results indicate that polarization measured at the parts per million level provides a very sensitive probe of the interstellar medium in the solar vicinity .",
    "the polarization observed near the sun is much less than would be expected based on the polarization of distant stars , thus confirming the presence of the local cavity or bubble seen in absorption line measurements and in the soft x - ray background .",
    "polarization shows litle correlation with caii absorption due to warm interstellar gas .",
    "the data is not consistent with the hypothesis of @xcite that polarization in nearby stars is due to interstellar dust entrained in the heliospere .",
    "regulus shows a larger polarization than expected for its position .",
    "regulus is known to be a rapidly rotating star , and the polarization direction agrees with the minor axis of the rotational flattening as measured by interferometry .",
    "the polarization is reasonably consistent with that expected due to electron scattering in the atmosphere of the flattened star .",
    "we acknowledge the award of a pparc grant to build the planetpol polarimeter .",
    "we thank the staff of the isaac newton group for their support when using planetpol on the wht .",
    "we thank edwin hirst and david harrison for their support of the planetpol instrument during the observing runs .",
