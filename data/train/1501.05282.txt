    "consider the energy level diagram with three states we will label @xmath22 in energy order with respective zero field energy values @xmath23 and we use the notation @xmath24 .",

    "@xmath28 are three orthogonal unit vectors forming a right handed coordinate system .",
    "we define rabi frequencies as @xmath29 , and @xmath30 .",
    "we also define detunings @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "the detuning of the @xmath33 transition is @xmath34 .",
    "we write the time dependent wavefunction in the hilbert spaced spanned by these three states as : @xmath35 the time dependent schrdinger equation , after making the `` rotating wave '' approximation of neglecting far - off resonance terms , gives for the time dependence for the amplitudes : @xmath36 which is the same as for the wavefunction coefficients with a time independent `` dressed state ''  @xcite hamiltonian matrix , @xmath37 .",
    "note that if we had not imposed the constraint that @xmath38 , we would not have eliminated all the explicit time dependent terms in @xmath37 .",
    "if we apply third order perturbation theory to the eigenstates of @xmath37 ( and correct for the energy shifts implied by the explicit time dependence in the definition of the @xmath39 s ) , we get ac stark shifts of the energy levels : @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the real part of @xmath42 . the last term in each case comes in third order and the real apart arises from the two time reversed paths through the intermediate states , i.e. for state @xmath4 we can go @xmath2 and @xmath43 .",
    "these give the same denominators but numerators that are complex conjugates of each other .",
    "if one observes a transition from any of the three levels @xmath44 to a forth level , @xmath45 , one will find this transition shifted by the ac stark effect of the initial state , assuming that the nonresonant stark shifts of state @xmath45 can be neglected .    except for a chiral molecule of @xmath3 symmetry ( i.e. no symmetry elements except the identity operation )",
    ", we can not have a closed loop of three electric dipole allowed transitions such as @xmath2 .",
    "this is due to the fact that each symmetry element besides the identity implies that at least one component of the electric dipole projected onto the inertial axes must be zero . for a pair of enantiomers ,",
    "the product @xmath46 will be of opposite sign for the same sets of transitions .",
    "for the case where the three coupled transitions are all rotational transition in a given vibronic state , each transition will have a sign determined by the sign of one of the components of the permanent electrical dipole moment projection onto a different principle axis of the inertial tensor . in assigning the inertial axes to the molecule ,",
    "one is free to pick the sign of two of the components of the permanent dipole moment to be positive , but then the sign of the third component will be fixed by the requirement that one has a right handed coordinate system .",
    "thus , if we have a mixture of a pair of enantiomers , there will be a different sign of the third order ac stark shifts of the energy levels while they are driven by the fields with the properties we invoked .",
    "the ac stark effect proposed here , will produce a pair of peaks that are shifted in equal and opposite directions from the positions of the peaks without the closed cycle .",
    "for example , if one is observing the frequency of the @xmath47 transition , then the third order stark shift of state @xmath4 can be observed by a shift in this resonance frequency when the field at @xmath48 is switched on . note that @xmath48 is far from resonance with any transition coming directly from state @xmath4 .",
    "the second order stark terms can be expected to be larger than the third for the case where perturbation theory is reasonably accurate .",
    "however , by selecting the signs of the two detunings to the two virtual levels from a state of interest , one can , for this simple three state model , arrange to cancel the second order shifts .",
    "for example , if we select detunings and field amplitudes such that @xmath49 , the net second order ac stark shift of state @xmath4 will be zero , leaving only the enantiometric distinguishing third order terms .",
    "as will be demonstrated below , this does not hold when the @xmath50 spatial degeneracy of states is considered .",
    "going to 5th order in perturbation theory , we can write the energy of dressed state @xmath4 as :    @xmath51    thus , the 4th order terms are the same for the two enantiomers and that selecting @xmath49 , cancels both the 2nd and 4th order terms .",
    "the 5th order terms are , like the 3rd order terms , of opposite sign for a pair of enantiomers .",
    "if we select parameters to cancel out the 2nd order term , then @xmath52 and the 5th order term will cancel part of the 3rd order contribution .",

    ", this degeneracy will be at least partially lifted by the second and third order , chiral ac stark effects . in general , to account for this effect , we must use degenerate perturbation theory and diagonalize the @xmath65 matrix of @xmath66 values for the level with total rotational angular momentum quantum number @xmath19 .",
    "if we probe the spectrum of a transition @xmath67 where we can neglect the ac stark effect in state @xmath68 , the ac stark shift and splitting pattern of state @xmath19 will be directly observed in the spectrum .",

    "transforming to the asymmetric top eigenfunction basis gives matrix elements : @xmath87 an allowed rotational transition will have only one nonzero @xmath88 transition component  @xcite and to have a closed cycle of three transitions , the three principle axes directions are each represented once .",
    "the triple product of rabi frequencies that contribute to the chiral ac stark effect can be written : @xmath89 to be nonzero , @xmath90 or @xmath91 .",

    "the chiral sensitive ac stark shifts become large compare to the shifts when @xmath149 .",
    "this can be understood to be a consequence of the largest resonant ( and thus first order ) stark shift of the components of the mixed @xmath60 and @xmath5 state shifting into near resonance with the dressed state energies of the components of state @xmath4 . for @xmath150 , the lowest states that arise from the two @xmath151 states are at 104.5 and 106.5 , i.e. , have ac stark shifts of 90% of the splittings without stark shifts .    if we keep everything else the same and change @xmath152 we get the variation of dress state eigenenergies shown in figure [ j211_100_m100 ] .",

    "again , the resonance enhancement is evident . in this case , three of the five states are strongly shifted , which matches the number of states of the @xmath157 resonance that are strongly shifted down towards the energy of @xmath94 .",

    "this is lifted for @xmath165 but it is symmetric for simultaneous change in the signs of @xmath164 and @xmath55 .",

    "the spectra are offset for clarity , with ( from bottom to top ) @xmath163,width=377 ]    it may not be obvious to the reader why i have selected the three excitation polarizations perpendicular to one another .",
    "if two were parallel , we get dressed state energies that are invariant to sign change of any of the @xmath136 values and thus the same for a pair of enantiomers .",
    "a way to rationalize this result is to note that to distinguish between the enantiomers , we need to determine if the vectors formed by the projection of the dipole moment onto three principle axes of the moment of inertia tensor form a right or left handed coordinate system . since interactions in the electric dipole approximation involve projections of the molecular frame dipole components onto the laboratory field components , these have to be nonplaner to distinguish between right and left handed systems .",
    "in the discussion above , i have implicitly assumed that the magnitudes of the electric fields , @xmath172 are fixed and that the relative phases ( @xmath173 ) are also fixed .",
    "any dispersion of these across the sample that is probed by the @xmath174 transition will lead to an inhomogeneous distribution of ac stark shifts . because of the change of phase with propagation of the fields , we can only exactly satisfy the condition of constant relative phases if the three waves co - propagate , but this is not possible given the requirement that the three fields are all mutually perpendicular .",
    "this is analogous to the fact that one can not achieve phase matching in the case of the 3-wave mixing version of the experiment of patterson and doyle .",
    "@xcite this effect can be minimized by taking transitions @xmath175 and @xmath176 to be close in frequency and co - propagating .",
    "this means that @xmath177 will be relatively small and can be applied as a quasi - dc field , polarized in the direction of the propagation of the other two fields . in practice , this can be realized if the transition @xmath33 is an asymmetry doublet of the chiral asymmetric top .",
    "another important consideration is if sufficient electric field amplitudes can be realized in practice .",
    "the rabi frequency of a transition is given by @xmath178s@xmath179 .",
    "values of @xmath180 will typically be about half the corresponding permanent dipole moment projection along the relevant axis . if we suppose that we apply 1000 v across 10 cm gap for the low frequency @xmath181 , we will have @xmath182s@xmath183 .",
    "the plots of ac stark shifts given above are for the angular frequencies and thus need to be reduced by @xmath184 to put in units of hz . referring to figure  [ spec_plot_1200 ] , where the chiral differential spectral shift is a few percent of the largest rabi frequency suggests that we can realize chiral differential shifts on the order of a few mhz . though complicating the experiment , it should be possible to use resonant cavities to enhance the fields .",
    "for the patterson and doyle type 3-wave mixing experiment , the use of a `` regular '' cavity ( without birefringence ) is ruled out as one could not expect to simultaneously have cavity resonance for both the two necessarily resonant waves .",
    "however , for the ac stark shift , one has the waves off resonant and these detuning values can be adjusted to allow simultaneous resonance of the two driving waves in the same cavity ( with perpendicular polarization ) .",
    "the third driving wave for the ac stark effect can resonated in a cavity oriented at 90 degrees to the first , so one can in principle build up all three waves .",
    "a disadvantage of the use of microwave cavities is that one will have standing wave fields , not traveling ones , and so the problem of inhomogeneous stark shifts will be exacerbated .",
    "it is interesting to compare the chiral dependent ac stark shift with the methods developed by patterson _ et .",
    "@xcite where one creates and then detects a net polarization in a chiral sample that is perpendicular to two other fields that are applied to the sample . in the first published version ,  @xcite",
    "one field is a dc stark field ( which is switched off before detection ) and the other is a resonant excitation field . in the second",
    ",  @xcite two resonant excitation fields are applied . in both of these cases ,",
    "the magnitude of the signal is proportional to the enantiomeric excess ( ee ) of the sample , i.e. the difference in molecular density of a pair of enantiomers .",
    "in such an experiment , signal to noise will be maximized for samples with large @xmath16 s , but it will be difficult to make an accurate measurement of the @xmath16 since there is only a single signal . while one can observe the regular free induction decay of the same transition for normalization , the loss of signal strength from phase mismatching makes it difficult to use such a normalization without having a reference sample of known @xmath16 . in many potential applications of these methods ,",
    "one will seek to quantify a small relative concentration of one enantiomer compared to another and this would appear challenging . for a sample with a small @xmath16 , the chiral signals will be small but proportional to the @xmath16 and thus one can hope to make an accurate determination of @xmath16 .    if one observes the chiral dependent ac stark effect , then one can determine the @xmath16 by comparing the areas of two peaks shifted from one another . by phase",
    "reversing one the excitation fields by @xmath15 , the resonant frequencies of a pair of enantiomers will interchange , so one can compare molecular absorption or emission at the same frequency to determine the ratio of the enantiomers .",
    "assuming that one can get good separation of the peaks , this should provide a more accurate way to determine the @xmath16 of a sample , assuming it is not so large that signal from the minor enantiomer is buried in the wing of the transition from the dominant one . for a sample with small @xmath16 ,",
    "the ac stark measurement will give signal strengths only reduced a factor of @xmath185 compared to an equivalent measurement sample with a single enantiomer .",
    "however , the determination of the @xmath16 will require accurate measurement of a small change in signal strength .",
    "thus , the two measurement methods can be considered complimentary to some degree .",
    "the ac stark measurement does require the application of four distinct frequencies to to the sample , compared to two for the three wave mixing method introduced by paterson and doyle , i.e. it is formally a five wave mixing experiment instead of three wave mixing .",
    "another potential practical difficulty with the ac stark effect detection method is that the three driving fields producing the ac stark effect must be present when detecting the molecular absorption or free induction decay of the @xmath186 transition .",
    "this will require that the frequency of this transition to be sufficiently separated that one can use filters to selectively attenuate these driving fields .",
    "another potential concern of the ac stark measurement is that one will split the zero field peak into multiple @xmath20 components , and this will reduce the signal to noise ratio .",
    "the author would like to thank brooks pate for encouragement and helpful discussions ."

    "<S> sans tiny parity violating interactions , a pair of enantiomers have identical thermodynamic properties , and most physical and spectroscopic ones as well . </S>",
    "<S> one - well known exception is that they interact differently with circular polarized light ( which itself has a handedness and thus is chiral ) leading to optical rotation and circular dichroism which are proportional to the differences in the respectively real and imaginary dielectric constants of chiral samples . </S>",
    "<S> these difference arises from an interference of contributions of electric and magnetic dipole components of transitions . </S>",
    "<S> since magnetic dipole matrix elements are typically much smaller than electric dipole ones , these effects are weak and difficult to observe in the gas phase . as one goes to longer wavelengths ( corresponding to slower motions ) , allowed magnetic dipole transition moments become even smaller relative to electric dipole transition moments , and as a result , more difficult to observe . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , optical activity has not been observed in the rotational spectroscopy of molecules . </S>",
    "<S> this is unfortunate as rotational spectroscopy provide the greatest selectivity in distinguishing complex molecules of any method that can be applied in the gas phase .    </S>",
    "<S> kral _ _ et . </S>",
    "<S> al.__@xcite pointed out that chiral molecules have a unique spectroscopic property . as a consequence of their lack of definite parity </S>",
    "<S> , they have closed cycles of three electric dipole allowed transitions of the form @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the product of the three transition dipole moments will be of opposite sign for a pair of enantiomers . following publications of the same group@xcite examined use of such cycles to achieve enantiomeric selection , though they explicitly assumed that two of the levels were such that they could be accessed by both l and r forms of the molecule , which requires that they be in a state with no or a low barrier to isomerization . </S>",
    "<S> hirota@xcite exploited the same principle of existence of cycles of three transitions but for excitation of chiral , @xmath3 symmetry asymmetric top molecules in their ground state . in this case , the three allowed transition moments are proportional to the projection of the permanent dipole moment ( in the molecular frame ) projected onto a different inertial axis of the molecule . </S>",
    "<S> even though the individual transition dipole matrix elements depends upon choices for directions for molecular axis and state phase conventions , the triple product of matrix elements is invariant and of opposite sign for a pair of enantiomers . </S>",
    "<S> the sign of this triple product can be determined by the interference of amplitude transferred between states @xmath4 and @xmath5 by the direct @xmath6 transition and the indirect @xmath7 pair of transitions . </S>",
    "<S> hirota proposed that such a scheme can be used to spectroscopically distinguish between a pair of enantiomers . </S>",
    "<S> hirota s theoretical work was followed by an experiment by patterson , schnell , and doyle  @xcite where they demonstrated chiral sensitivity using rotational spectroscopy . in the initial experiment , </S>",
    "<S> a chiral molecule was excited with pulsed @xmath8 polarized radiation in the presence of a @xmath9 polarized dc stark field . when the stark field was rapidly shorted to zero after the excitation pulse </S>",
    "<S> , the sample produced @xmath10 polarized emission that was of opposite sign for the @xmath0 and @xmath1 enantiomers and zero ( by interference of the emission ) for a racemic mixture . </S>",
    "<S> this effect can be understood as arising from the interference of two components of the electric transition dipole , with one induced by stark mixing . </S>",
    "<S> this work was soon followed by a second paper by patterson and doyle ,  @xcite where the dc stark field was replaced by an rf field that was tuned on resonance , producing coherent electric dipole emission at the frequency of the @xmath11 transition induced by two photon excitation of the @xmath12 and @xmath13 transitions . </S>",
    "<S> the emitted field was polarized perpendicular to the fields driving the @xmath14 and @xmath13 transitions . </S>",
    "<S> again , there was observed a @xmath15 phase shift between the emissions from the @xmath0 and @xmath1 enantiomers and thus zero emission intensity for a racemic mixture .    </S>",
    "<S> both of these experimental approaches produce a signal that is proportional to the enantiomeric excess ( @xmath16 ) of the sample and thus can be expected to produce weak signals for sample with small _ ee_. in this paper , i propose a method to produce a differential splitting of @xmath0 and @xmath1 rotational transitions produced by a chiral selective ac stark shift . </S>",
    "<S> this ac stark shift is produced in third order by the interaction of three mutually perpendicularly polarized electric fields that drive the three transitions in a @xmath2 cycle . for a simple three state model </S>",
    "<S> , one can arrange the experimental conditions such that the second order ac stark shifts cancel and only the chiral selective third order ac stark shift remains , leading to opposite sign spectral shifts for an @xmath17 pair . </S>",
    "<S> this situation is worked out and the optimal driving condition explored . </S>",
    "<S> i then turn attention to a more realistic model that accounts for the @xmath18 degeneracy of rotational states with total angular momentum quantum number @xmath19 . </S>",
    "<S> it is found that one can not `` tune out '' the second order ac stark shift of more than one @xmath20 component of the transition due to the requirement that the excitation fields be perpendicularly polarized . despite this , </S>",
    "<S> simulation of the absorption of the `` dressed states '' in the presence of three fields produces substantial chiral differential shifts . based upon this analysis </S>",
    "<S> , i consider this a promising approach to chiral analysis of complex molecules . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , one should be able to make accurate relative intensity measurements of the spectrally resolved signals from the @xmath0 and @xmath1 isomers and this could lead to accurate measurement of the @xmath21 of an enantio - enriched sample , perhaps even when the magnitude of the @xmath16 is only slightly less than unity . </S>"
