    "quantum systems , ranging from atomic systems to field modes and mechanical devices are useful precision probes for a variety of physical properties and phenomena @xcite .",
    "when we deal with a single quantum system , we must take into account that the measurements by which we extract information about its evolution yield random results and that they cause a measurement back action on the system .",
    "for some problems this back action may be favorable as it randomly quenches the system and thus triggers a transient evolution with temporal signal correlations and these may depend more strongly than the steady state on the desired physical properties @xcite .",
    "for too strong or too frequent measurements , however , the back action may completely dominate the evolution .",
    "this is manifested in the quantum zeno effect ( qze ) @xcite , named after zeno s arrow paradox , which inhibits population transfer between discrete states in a quantum system due to frequent observations .",
    "the effect was first illustrated in ion trap experiments @xcite and has since been used to account for experiments on many other systems , e.g @xcite .",
    "the intuition behind the quantum zeno effect has stimulated proposals for application in quantum information processing @xcite , e.g. for entanglement protection @xcite , preservation of systems in decoherence free subspaces @xcite and error suppression in quantum computing @xcite . in many of these studies",
    "the measurement back action is actually not unambiguously identified as the crucial element , but experiments and calculations have clearly established the intuition behind the quantum zeno effect as a useful and inspirational source for new ideas and proposals .    in this study , we focus on information retrieved directly by the measurements and , closer to the original zeno paradox , we ask to what extent frequent measurements on a quantum system prevent the observation - through the same measurements - of its dynamical evolution .",
    "this analysis is pertinent for the use of quantum systems as sensitive probes , and we shall quantify the information content in measurement records and derive theoretical expressions for the fisher information @xcite , to reveal the extent to which high precision probing is inhibited by the quantum zeno effect in the limit of strong frequent measurements .",
    "the fisher information quantifies the asymptotic precision in any estimate and has in recent works been applied to analyze quantum parameter estimation in various schemes of repetitive and continuous measurements , see e.g. @xcite .    as our main example",
    ", we consider the estimation of the rabi frequency @xmath0 of a driven two - level system subject to projective eigenstate measurements . a similar setup is considered in ref .",
    "looking at  [ fig : zenoeffect ] , it is intuitively clear that the rabi oscillation dynamics is prevented as the interval @xmath1 between measurements decreases , and if we measure too often , the signal holds no information about @xmath0 .",
    "if , on the other hand , we measures too rarely we may obtain very little data in any finite probing time @xmath2 .",
    "so , what is the optimal value of @xmath1 for the purpose of parameter estimation ?",
    "our expression for the fisher information provides the @xmath1 maximizing the information in any record obtained in a finite time , and by employing a bayesian inference protocol @xcite to the measurement outcomes we discuss further the convergence of parameter estimation based on such optimal probing intervals .",
