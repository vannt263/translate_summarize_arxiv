    "neutrino physics has become one of the important areas of intense theoretical and experimental efforts .",
    "this is because neutrinos are instrumental in giving answer to some of the basic questions in cosmology , astro- , nuclear , and particle physics .",
    "the @xmath1 scattering processes have been studied by several authors for the quasielastic , 1 pion production and for deep - inelastic scattering processes  @xcite-@xcite . however , there are very few works where neutrino induced strange particle production have been been studied  @xcite-@xcite .",
    "these processes are important for the analysis of the precise determination of neutrino oscillation parameters . in the few - gev region",
    "it allows the detailed study of the strange - quark content of the nucleon and gives some important information about the structure of the hadronic weak current .",
    "apart from that in the atmospheric neutrino analysis these processes gives @xmath2 backgrounds for nucleon - decay searches .",
    "the antineutrino induced @xmath3 single - hyperon production can give us useful information about the weak form - factors . a precise measurement of the hyperon cross - section specially @xmath4 distribution will be useful in the determination of axial form factors",
    ". a better understanding of these processes will give more strength to the basic understanding of v - a and cabibbo theories .",
    "recently miner@xmath0a is taking data in its first phase of experiment with high statistics to explore the strange physics .",
    "there is also probability of getting events of single kaons in the various beta - beam experiments in the energy region of  1gev .",
    "also t2k is planning to run phase - ii in antineutrino mode and the no@xmath0a experiments where the information about the single hyperon and single kaon production may be obtained .",
    "strange particle production via the weak interaction were initially studied by shrock  @xcite , mecklenburg  @xcite and dewan  @xcite .",
    "shrock  @xcite and mecklenburg  @xcite independently studied the associated production of charged current ( cc ) reactions by employing the cabibbo theory with su(3 ) symmetry .",
    "amer  @xcite used harmonic oscillator quark model to estimate cross section for some of the associated production process .",
    "dewan  @xcite studied the cc and strangeness changing ( @xmath5s = 1 ) strange particle production reactions . recently singh and vicente vacas  @xcite have studied hyperon production induced by antineutrinos from nucleons and nuclei , rafi alam et al .",
    "@xcite have studied single kaon production and adera et al .",
    "@xcite have studied differential cross section for @xmath0 induced c. c. associated particle production .",
    "most of the earlier neutrino experiments ( 1970 s and 80s ) were performed using bubble chambers where cross - sections for many associated - production and @xmath6 reactions were obtained using bubble chambers filled with freon and/or propane or with deuterium . however , the data are statistically limited with large error bars@xcite-@xcite .    in this work ,",
    "we have presented the results of our calculations for single kaon produced induced by neutrino / antineutrino reactions . in sect.ii , we present the formalism in brief and in sect.iii , the results and discussions are presented .",
    "the basic reaction for the @xmath7 induced charged current kaon production is @xmath8 where @xmath9 and @xmath10=n , p .",
    "the expression for the differential cross section in lab frame for the above process is given by , @xmath11 where @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the 3-momenta of the incoming and outgoing leptons in the lab frame with energy @xmath14 and @xmath15 respectively .",
    "the kaon lab momentum is @xmath16 having energy @xmath17 , @xmath18 is the nucleon mass , @xmath19 is the square of the transition amplitude matrix element averaged(summed ) over the spins of the initial(final ) state . at low energies , this amplitude can be written in the usual form as @xmath20 where @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the leptonic and hadronic currents respectively , @xmath23 is the fermi constant and @xmath24 is the gauge coupling . the leptonic current can be readily obtained from the standard model lagrangian coupling the @xmath25 bosons to the leptons @xmath26\\ ] ]    , scaledwidth=80.0% ]    , scaledwidth=80.0% ]    in the case of neutrino induced kaon production process , we have considered four different channels that contribute to the hadronic current .",

    "[ fig : feynman_neutrino ] .",
    "there is a contact term ( ct ) , a kaon pole ( kp ) term , a u - channel process with a @xmath27 or @xmath28 hyperon in the intermediate state and finally a meson ( @xmath29 ) exchange term . for the specific reactions under consideration",
    ", there is no s - channel contributions given the absence of @xmath30 baryonic resonances .",
    "kp term is proportional lepton mass and therefore its contribution is very small . while in the case of antineutrino induced kaon production process , besides the processes mentioned for the neutrino case , there are contributions from s - channel @xmath31 propagator , s - channel @xmath32 resonance terms(fig .",
    "[ fig : feynman_antineutrino ] ) .    the contribution of the different terms can be obtained in a systematic manner using chiral perturbation theory ( @xmath33pt ) .",

    "the kaon pole contributions are negligible at the studied energies and are not shown in the figures although they are included in the full model curves .",
    "we observe the relevance of the contact term , not included in previous calculations .",
    "we find that the contact term is in fact dominant , followed by the u - channel diagram with a @xmath28 intermediate state and the @xmath64 exchange term .",
    "as observed by dewan  @xcite the u - channel @xmath27 contribution is much less important , basically because of the larger coupling ( @xmath65 ) of the strong vertex .",
    "the curve labeled as full model has been calculated with a dipole form factor with a mass of 1 gev .",

    "the suppression of @xmath27 as the intermediate state is due to the difference in the coupling strength @xmath67 and in the @xmath68 in flight due to @xmath69 .",

    "the reactions are always forward peaked ( for the final lepton ) , even in the absence of any form factor ( @xmath75 ) , favoring relatively small values of the momentum transfer . on the right panel of the fig .",
    "( [ fig : xsec_dq2_genie ] ) , we have compared our results for the @xmath76 process with the values for the associated production obtained by means of the genie monte carlo program  @xcite .",
    "we observe that , due to the difference between the energy thresholds , single kaon production for the @xmath77 is clearly dominant for neutrinos of energies below 1.5 gev . for the other two channels associated production becomes comparable at lower energies .",
    "still , single @xmath78 production off neutrons is larger than the associated production up to 1.3 gev and even the much smaller @xmath79 production off neutrons is larger than the associated production up to 1.1 gev .",
    "the consideration of these @xmath3 channels is therefore important for the description of strangeness production for all low energy neutrino spectra and should be incorporated in the experimental analysis .",
