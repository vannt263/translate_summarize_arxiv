    "the goal of this lecture is to present a physical picture of the process of continuous quantum measurement of a qubit in the circuit quantum electrodynamics ( cqed ) setup @xcite ( fig .  1 ) , extending or reformulating the previous theoretical descriptions @xcite .",
    "understanding of the qubit evolution in the process of measurement is important for developing an intuition , which is useful in many cases , in particular in designing various schemes of the quantum feedback @xcite .",
    "when a quantum measurement is discussed @xcite , there are usually two different types of questions to answer : we can either focus on obtaining information on the initial state ( before measurement ) or focus on the quantum state after the measurement ( i.e.  evolution in the process of measurement ) .",
    "let us emphasize that we consider the latter problem here and essentially extend the collapse postulate by describing continuous evolution `` inside '' the collapse timescale .    in the cqed setup ( fig .",
    "1 ) a qubit interacts with a ghz - range microwave resonator , whose frequency slightly changes depending on whether the qubit is in the state @xmath0 or @xmath1 @xcite . in turn",
    ", this frequency shift affects the phase ( and in general amplitude ) of a probing microwave , which is transmitted through the resonator ( in another setup the microwave is reflected from the resonator , but the difference is not important ) .",
    "the outgoing microwave is amplified , and after that the rf signal is downconverted by mixing it with the original microwave tone , so that the low - frequency ( @xmath2 mhz ) output of the iq mixer provides information on the qubit state .",
    "the output noise is mainly determined by the first amplifying stage , the pre - amplifier . with recent development of nearly quantum - limited superconducting parametric amplifiers @xcite ,",
    "it is natural to use them as pre - amplifiers @xcite instead of cryogenic high - electron - mobility transistors ( hemts ) @xcite , which usually have noise temperature above 3 k.     is transmitted through ( or reflected from ) the resonator of frequency @xmath3 , which slightly changes , @xmath4 , depending on the qubit state .",
    "after amplification the microwave is sent to the iq mixer , which produces two quadrature signals : @xmath5 and @xmath6 . for a phase - preserving amplifier we define @xmath5 as the quadrature carrying information on the qubit state , while for a phase - sensitive amplifier we define @xmath5 as corresponding to the amplified quadrature.,width=321 ]    continuous quantum measurement in the cqed setup in some sense falls in between a qubit measurement by a quantum point contact ( qpc ) or a single - electron transistor ( set ) , the theory of which has been developed over a decade ago @xcite , and continuous quantum measurement in optics , for which the theory of quantum trajectories has been developed even earlier @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the cqed setup differs from both these cases , and this is probably the reason why there is still a confusion about the proper physical description of the measurement process .",
    "the measurement by the qpc or set is of the broadband type , meaning that the monitored frequency band starts from zero .",
    "in contrast , the cqed setup is of the narrowband type : we deal only with a relatively narrow band around the probing microwave frequency @xmath7 .",
    "this necessarily involves two orthogonal quadratures @xcite : we work with rf signals of the type @xmath8 , and there are essentially two signals @xmath9 and @xmath10 instead of only one in the broadband case . in this sense",
    "the cqed setup is similar to the optical ( especially cavity qed ) setup @xcite ; however , there is an important difference : in the cqed case the outgoing microwave is amplified ( fig .",
    "1 ) before being mixed with the original microwave , while there is no amplification stage in the standard optical setup . the operation will obviously depend on whether a phase - sensitive or a phase - preserving amplifier is used , since a phase - preserving amplifier necessarily adds the half quantum of noise into any quadrature @xcite .",
    "notice that the quantum trajectory theory for the cqed setup was developed in @xcite ; however , the amplifier stage was essentially missing in the analyzed model .",
    "in this lecture we consider the simplest cqed case , assuming dispersive regime @xcite , exactly resonant microwave frequency , absence of the rabi drive , and sufficiently wide resonator and amplifier bandwidths for the markov approximation .",
    "some generalizations are rather straightforward ; however , our goal is a simple picture in a simple case .",
    "a description of continuous qubit measurement is essentially a description of the quantum back - action .",
    "following the same quantum bayesian framework as for the measurement by qpc / set @xcite ( see @xcite for review ) , we will discuss two kinds of measurement back - action onto the qubit , which we name here as `` spooky '' and `` realistic '' .",
    "_ the `` spooky '' ( or `` quantum '' , `` informational '' , `` non - unitary '' ) back - action does not have a physical mechanism _ and therefore can not be described by the schrdinger equation ( in contrast to what people often think , trying to find a mechanism for the quantum collapse ) ; however , _ it is a common - sense consequence of acquiring information _ on the qubit state in the process of measurement .",
    "this is essentially the same back - action which is discussed in the epr paradox @xcite and bell inequality violation @xcite ; the only difference is that in our case the information is incomplete and therefore we have to use the quantum bayes rule @xcite instead of the projective collapse rule .",
    "in contrast , the `` realistic '' ( or `` classical '' , `` unitary '' ) back - action has a physical mechanism : in the cqed case it is a fluctuation of the number of photons in the resonator , which affects the phase of the qubit state .",
    "the `` realistic '' back - action is usually discussed in the standard theories of the cqed measurement @xcite .",
    "actually , there is a certain spookiness even in the `` realistic '' back - action ( it may be affected by a delayed choice , as discussed in conclusion ) ; however , we do not want to emphasize it to keep the picture simple .",
    "when we measure the @xmath11-coordinate of the qubit state on the bloch sphere ( the basis states @xmath1 and @xmath0 correspond to the north and south poles ) , then the `` spooky '' back - action changes the @xmath11-coordinate and leads to the state evolution along the meridian lines , while the `` realistic '' back - action leads to the evolution around the @xmath11-axis , i.e.  along the parallels .",
    "it is important to notice that when the probing microwave leaves the resonator after interaction with the qubit , one quadrature of the microwave carries information about the qubit state , while the orthogonal quadrature carries information on the fluctuating number of photons in the resonator @xcite .",
    "therefore , if a phase - preserving amplifier is used , then the `` spooky '' and `` realistic '' back - actions are fully separated and correspond to two orthogonal quadratures @xmath5 and @xmath6 measured after the mixer ( it is trivial to choose the proper linear combinations of the i / q mixer outputs ) .",
    "the signals @xmath5 and @xmath6 are necessarily noisy , and the measurement back - actions are stochastic ; however , there is a correlation ( full correlation in the ideal case ) between the output noise and the back - action noise in both channels . as a result ( derived later ) , for a quantum - limited phase - preserving amplifier and absence of extra decoherence , the measured quadratures @xmath5 and @xmath6 give us _",
    "full information about the back - action _ , so that a _ random evolution of the qubit wavefunction can be monitored precisely _ ( a useful analogy is with a brownian particle under a microscope : we can not predict its motion , but we can monitor it ) .",
    "this is what is needed , in particular , for arranging a perfect quantum feedback control of the qubit state .",
    "it is interesting to notice that for an ensemble - averaged evolution ( in which the random but monitorable qubit evolution is replaced by dephasing ) , exactly one half of the ensemble dephasing @xmath12 comes from the `` spooky '' back - action , and the other half comes from the `` realistic '' back - action .    in the case of a phase - sensitive amplifier",
    "it is sufficient to measure after the mixer only the quadrature which was amplified ; let us still denote it as @xmath5 , though now its phase is determined by the amplifier instead of the microwave - qubit interaction .",
    "in this case the `` spooky '' and `` realistic '' back - actions are in general mixed ( not separated ) , because there is only one output signal @xmath5 .",
    "this situation exactly corresponds to the broadband measurement by the qpc / set with a correlation between the output and `` realistic '' back - action noises @xcite .",
    "the situation simplifies when the amplified quadrature is the one which carries information about the qubit state ( @xmath11-coordinate ) .",
    "then in the quantum - limited case the `` realistic '' back - action is fully absent : we can not measure the photon number fluctuation and correspondingly it does not fluctuate ( in the imperfect case the effect of the remaining `` realistic '' back - action can be described by an extra dephasing ) .",
    "so we are left with only the `` spooky '' back - action , and the quantum measurement description coincides with the simpler theory of measurement by a symmetric qpc @xcite , which does not produce the `` realistic '' back - action . in contrast , in the case when the photon - number quadrature is amplified , we do not obtain any information on the qubit @xmath11-coordinate , and therefore there is no `` spooky '' back - action , but only the `` realistic '' one . in a general case ,",
    "when the amplified quadrature makes an arbitrary angle @xmath13 with the qubit - information quadrature , both types of the back - action are present , and their strength depends on @xmath13 .",
    "it is important to mention that the ensemble dephasing rate @xmath12 does not depend on @xmath13 , as required by causality .",
    "in particular , in the quantum - limited case the contribution @xmath14 comes from the `` spooky '' back - action , while @xmath15 comes from the `` realistic '' back - action .",
    "let us emphasize that both the phase - sensitive and phase - preserving amplifiers permit exact monitoring of the qubit state and therefore a perfect quantum feedback .",
    "the necessary condition in both cases is that the detection system is quantum - limited .    in the following sections a formal description of the above discussed results is presented .",
    "we start with reviewing the bayesian approach for the broadband qubit measurement , then briefly discuss the difference between phase - preserving and phase - sensitive amplifiers , and then present the formalism of the narrowband continuous measurement of a qubit in the cqed setup . in conclusion",
    "we briefly discuss generalizations of the formalism , quantum feedback , and the causality principle .",
    "we note that our approach can be converted into the formal language of the positive - operator - valued - measure(povm)-type generalized quantum measurement @xcite ( then separation of the `` spooky '' and `` realistic '' back - actions corresponds to the decomposition of the measurement operator into diagonal and unitary parts  see later ) , and our results for the case of a phase - sensitive amplifier are very similar to the results of ref .",
    "in this section we review the bayesian formalism @xcite for the broadband measurement of a qubit , considering only the simple case without additional evolution , and thus emphasizing the main physical idea of the formalism .",
    "we start with the broadband formalism because it is simpler than for the narrowband ( cqed ) measurement and it can be used as a natural step in understanding the cqed setup .    for definiteness",
    "let us assume that the qubit is a double quantum dot populated with one electron ( fig .",
    "2 ) , and the states @xmath0 and @xmath1 correspond to the electron localized in one or the other dot .",
    "the qubit is measured by a small - transparency tunnel junction ( model of qpc ) , whose barrier height depends on the electron location , so that the two qubit states correspond to different average currents @xmath16 and @xmath17 through the qpc .",
    "the voltage across the qpc is sufficiently large to make the detector output classical ( markov approximation ) , and @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the response and @xmath20 is the mean value ; this weak response assumption allows us to consider the qpc current @xmath5 as a quasicontinuous noisy signal ( see @xcite for the detailed discussion of required assumptions ; the formalism needs only a minor change if @xmath21 ) .",
    "then the output signal of the detector is i(t)=i_c + ( i/2 ) z(t ) + ( t ) , s _",
    "( ) = s , where @xmath22 is the @xmath11-component of the bloch sphere representation of the qubit density matrix @xmath23 , and @xmath24 is the white shot noise with spectral density @xmath25 ( we use the single - sided definition for the spectral density , in which the signal variance ( `` power '' ) corresponds to @xmath26 ; the definition of @xmath27 is twice smaller in ref .",
    "@xcite and @xmath28 times smaller in refs.@xcite ) .",
    "we emphasize that the detector signal @xmath5 is classical , and the qubit state @xmath23 is practically unentangled from the detector , but obviously depends on @xmath5 .",
    "is the qpc current . , width=188 ]    the detector hamiltonian and the qubit - detector interaction hamiltonian are given in refs .",
    "@xcite , they are not really important for our discussion here . for simplicity",
    "let us assume that the qubit hamiltonian is zero , @xmath29 , so that the qubit evolution is due to the measurement only . in this case the qubit evolution during time @xmath30 happens to be determined only by the time - averaged value of the measured detector output _ m ( t ) = _ 0^t i(t ) dt , which would contain full information for a classical measurement .",
    "because of the correspondence principle , the evolution of the diagonal elements of the qubit density matrix @xmath31 ( @xmath32 ) should correspond to the classical evolution of probabilities , which are given by the classical bayes rule .",
    "the bayes rule says that an updated ( a posteriori ) probability of a system state is proportional to the initial ( a priori ) probability and the probability ( likelihood ) of the obtained measurement result assuming this particular state . in our case",
    "@xmath33 is the measurement result , and its probability for the qubit in the basis state @xmath34 has the gaussian distribution p_|j(_m)= , d= , [ gaussian ] where @xmath35 is the variance , which decreases with the measurement time @xmath30",
    ". therefore the correspondence principle demands the bayesian evolution = , [ rho - diag]which in our terminology is due to the `` spooky '' back - action ; it can not be described by the schrdinger equation , but follows from common sense .",
    "if the phase of qubit state is not affected by the measurement process ( no `` realistic '' back - action ) , then an arbitrary initial wavefunction @xmath36 ; therefore for an arbitrary mixed state we get _ 01(t)= _ 01(0 ) .",
    "[ rho - off]equations ( [ rho - diag ] ) and ( [ rho - off ] ) describe the `` spooky '' back - action .",
    "now assume that due to the qubit - detector interaction ( e.g.coulomb interaction ) , each electron passing through the detector rotates the qubit phase @xmath37 by a small amount @xmath38 . from the measured result @xmath33",
    "we know exactly how many electrons passed through [ @xmath39 with @xmath40 being the electron charge ] , and can easily introduce the corresponding phase factor into eq .",
    "( [ rho - off ] ) : _ 01(t)= _ 01(0 ) , [ rho - off-2]where @xmath41 . the non - stochastic factor @xmath42",
    "can be obviously ascribed to the qubit hamiltonian ; however , this is not important here .",
    "the factor @xmath43 $ ] in eq.([rho - off-2 ] ) is the effect of the `` realistic '' back - action .",
    "it may or may not be present in a particular physical situation ; for example , @xmath44 for measurement by a symmetric qpc , while @xmath45 in an asymmetric qpc or set case .",
    "finally , if there is an extra pure dephasing of a qubit with rate @xmath46 , then eq .  ( [ rho - off-2 ] ) becomes _ 01(t)= _ 01(0 ) e^-t .",
    "[ rho - off-3]equations ( [ rho - diag ] ) and ( [ rho - off-3 ] ) is _ the main starting point of the bayesian formalism _",
    "it is then easy to include non - zero qubit hamiltonian @xmath47 by differentiating eqs .",
    "( [ rho - diag ] ) and ( [ rho - off-3 ] ) over time ( paying attention to whether the stratonovich or it definition of the derivative is used ) and adding terms due to @xmath47 . energy relaxation and other mechanisms of the qubit state evolution can be included in the same way .",
    "actually , there are many ways to derive the bayesian equations ( [ rho - diag ] ) and ( [ rho - off-3 ] ) @xcite , but we focus here only on their meaning , not on their derivation .    notice that averaging of eqs .",
    "( [ rho - diag ] ) and ( [ rho - off-3 ] ) over the measurement result @xmath48 ( i.e.  ensemble averaging ) with the probability distribution p(_m)=_00(0)p_|0(_m)+ _ 11(0)p_|1(_m ) [ p(i ) ] gives the same evolution as for a pure dephasing : the diagonal matrix elements of @xmath31 do not evolve , while the off - diagonal element @xmath49 decays as @xmath50 with the ensemble dephasing rate @xcite = + + , [ gamma]which has clear contributions from the `` spooky '' back - action , `` realistic '' back - action , and additional dephasing .    in the case",
    "@xmath51 an initially pure qubit state remains pure ; in other words we can monitor evolution of a qubit wavefunction .",
    "this property can be used as the definition of a quantum - limited detector @xcite .",
    "the quantum efficiency @xmath52 can then be naturally defined as @xmath53 .",
    "if by some reason the `` realistic '' back - action is considered as dephasing ( i.e.  only in the averaged way ) , then the quantum efficiency can be defined as @xmath54 ( here the definitions of @xmath55 and @xmath52 are exchanged compared with the definitions in @xcite ) . in other words , @xmath56 is the relative contribution of only the `` spooky '' back - action in the ensemble dephasing @xmath12 . in particular , this definition is relevant to the peak - to - pedestal ratio of the rabi spectral peak @xcite , which is equal to @xmath57 . as an example , if @xmath51 and contributions in eq .",
    "( [ gamma ] ) from the `` spooky '' and `` realistic '' back - actions are equal to each other ( as in the cqed setup with a phase - preserving amplifier ) , then @xmath58 but @xmath59 .",
    "a non - ideal detector ( @xmath60 ) can be modeled in two equivalent ways @xcite : we either add an extra dephasing @xmath46 to the qubit or we add an extra noise to the output of the ideal detector .",
    "only the total dephasing @xmath12 , response @xmath61 , total output noise @xmath27 , and correlation factor @xmath62 are the physical ( i.e.  experimentally measurable ) parameters , while distribution of the non - ideality between the extra dephasing and additional output noise is a matter of convenience [ here @xmath63 , and notation @xmath64 reminds about averaging over additional classical noise at the output ] .",
    "we emphasize that the bayesian formalism deals only with the experimentally measurable parameters @xmath61 , @xmath27 , @xmath65 , @xmath12 , and the output signal @xmath5 .",
    "in the ideal case ( @xmath58 ) the evolution equations ( [ rho - diag ] ) and ( [ rho - off-2 ] ) can be translated into the language of povm - type generalized measurement . in this approach",
    "the effect of measurement is described as @xcite |(t)= , ( t)= , where @xmath66 is the so - called measurement ( kraus ) operator , corresponding to the result @xmath67 .",
    "the probability of the result @xmath67 is @xmath68 using wavefunctions or @xmath69 $ ] using density matrices ; therefore the povm elements @xmath70 should satisfy the completeness condition @xmath71 .",
    "the relation between this approach and the quantum bayesian approach can be understood via the operator decomposition m_r = u_r , where @xmath72 is unitary and the square root of the positive operator @xmath70 is defined in the natural way in the diagonalizing basis .",
    "it is easy to see that @xmath73 is essentially the quantum bayes rule ( in the diagonalizing basis ) ; in our terminology it corresponds to the `` spooky '' back - action , while @xmath72 corresponds to the `` realistic '' back - action .",
    "for the discussed setup the result @xmath67 is @xmath33 , the `` spooky '' back - action @xmath74^{1/2}$ ] should be determined by the probabilities @xmath75 given by eq .",
    "( [ gaussian ] ) , and the `` realistic '' back - action @xmath72 is given by the phase factor in eq .",
    "( [ rho - off-2 ] ) .",
    "therefore the corresponding measurement operator is @xmath76 where @xmath77 is the pauli matrix .",
    "before discussing microwave amplifiers , let us consider a measurement of an oscillator , for example , a mechanical resonator with frequency @xmath3 and mass @xmath78 . this is a very well studied problem @xcite , so we will only discuss a way to understand the results . a classical resonator position @xmath79 oscillates as @xmath80 ( in this section @xmath79 stands for the usual spatial coordinate , not for the bloch sphere coordinate ) .",
    "the corresponding quantum state is called the `` coherent state '' in the optical language ; it is represented by the wavefunction @xmath81\\exp(i",
    "p_c x/\\hbar)$ ] , where @xmath82 is the ground state and @xmath83 is the classical momentum .",
    "so the coherent state is essentially the ground state with oscillating center position .",
    "notice that continuous quantum measurement of a resonator position can be described in the same bayesian way @xcite as in the previous section ; for example the `` spooky '' back - action gives the evolution @xmath84/{\\rm norm}$ ] , where @xmath85 is the average detector signal for the resonator position @xmath79 , and @xmath86 is normalization [ see eqs.([rho - diag ] ) and ( [ rho - off ] ) ] .",
    "the time step @xmath30 in this case should be chosen much shorter than @xmath87 so that the unitary evolution and evolution due to measurement may be simply added .",
    "let us consider the following game : charlie prepares an oscillator in a coherent state with quadratures @xmath88 and @xmath89 , gives it to david , and david s goal is to find @xmath88 as accurately as possible .",
    "an optimal strategy is rather obvious : david should make a projective measurement of @xmath79 at time @xmath90 with any integer @xmath91 ( to avoid contribution from the @xmath89-term ) , and the measurement result is the best estimate of @xmath88 [ if the measurement is done at @xmath92 , then the result should be multiplied by @xmath93 .",
    "even though the strategy is optimal , the inaccuracy of david s result is obviously the width ( standard deviation ) @xmath94 of the ground state shape @xmath95 ; in energy units this inaccuracy corresponds to one half of the energy quantum .",
    "now assume that david can not make projective measurements , but only `` finite - strength '' ( i.e.  imprecise ) measurements .",
    "the best accuracy @xmath96 can still be achieved if the measurement is done in the simple but very clever `` quantum non - demolition '' ( qnd ) way : many finite - strength measurements are made at times @xmath97 ; this is called `` stroboscopic '' measurement @xcite . since the oscillator returns to the same state after the period @xmath98 , the unitary evolution is not important , and many finite - strength measurements ( described by the bayesian equation above ) are `` stacked '' to produce a strong , essentially projective measurement .",
    "more generally , the necessary condition to have the best accuracy @xmath96 for @xmath88 is that the measurement is not sensitive to the quadrature @xmath89 .",
    "now assume that david is only allowed to make a continuous measurement with unmodulated weak strength ( so that the inaccuracy achieved after @xmath87 is much larger than @xmath96 ) .",
    "then the `` spooky '' back - action gets mixed with the unitary evolution , essentially adding noise into the monitored evolution , so that after a while the resonator state becomes mostly determined by the back - action and almost not dependent on the initial state . as the result ,",
    "the best accuracy for measurement of @xmath88 becomes @xmath99 , which in energy units corresponds to two half - quanta @xcite , that is twice worse than for the projective or stroboscopic measurement .",
    "however , the continuous monitoring gives us an information about @xmath89 in the same way as for @xmath88 , so the accuracy of @xmath89-measurement is also @xmath100 .",
    "therefore , in some sense continuous phase - insensitive measurement brings the same total information as the phase - sensitive ( e.g.  stroboscopic ) measurement ; however , in our game only half of this information is useful for the david s goal .",
    "after discussing measurement of the resonator state it is easy to understand the quantum limits for the high - gain microwave amplifiers .",
    "now suppose charlie prepares a coherent state of a microwave resonator with quadratures @xmath88 and @xmath89 , gives it to david to find @xmath88 , and david uses an amplifier for amplification of the microwave field , which slowly leaks from the resonator until it is empty .",
    "there is only classical signal processing after the amplifier , so amplification is essentially the quantum measurement .",
    "the results are the same as above @xcite : a phase - sensitive amplifier , which amplifies only @xmath88-quadrature and `` de - amplifies '' ( attenuates ) @xmath89-quadrature can measure @xmath88 with accuracy @xmath96 , while a phase - preserving amplifier can measure @xmath88 only with accuracy @xmath99 ( and also measures @xmath89 with the same accuracy @xmath99 ) .",
    "technically , the accuracy is limited by the noise at the amplifier output , so this noise should forbid measuring of @xmath88 with accuracy better than @xmath96 by a phase - sensitive amplifier , and better than @xmath99 by a phase - preserving amplifier .",
    "therefore in the quantum - limited case the output noise power of a phase - preserving amplifier ( per quadrature ) is twice larger than for a phase - sensitive amplifier with the same gain ; this is often called an `` additional noise '' , corresponding to one half of the energy quantum ( one more half - quantum is present in both cases ) @xcite",
    ". it may be somewhat confusing why this result does not depend on the rate with which the microwave leaks from the resonator .",
    "so let us check the scaling : for @xmath101 times slower leakage ( @xmath101 times larger @xmath102-factor ) the microwave amplitude is @xmath103 times smaller , but accumulation time is @xmath101 times longer , therefore the measured signal for the quadrature @xmath88 is @xmath103 times larger , which is the same factor as for the noise accumulation .",
    "therefore , the signal - to - noise ratio which determines the @xmath88-accuracy does not depend on the leakage rate ( resonator bandwidth ) .",
    "using the above discussion of microwave amplifiers , it is easy to extend the bayesian approach for a broadband quantum measurement to the narrowband cqed setup .",
    "we consider the standard cqed setup @xcite , in which a qubit interacts with a microwave resonator , and assume the dispersive regime with the hamiltonian @xmath104 where @xmath105 is the lamb - shifted qubit frequency with no photons in the resonator , @xmath106 is the effective coupling with @xmath107 being the jaynes - cummings coupling , @xmath3 is the bare resonator frequency , pauli operator @xmath77 acts on the qubit state in the energy basis @xmath108 , and the resonator creation / annihilation operators are @xmath109 and @xmath110 .",
    "notice that the resonator frequency increases by @xmath111 when the qubit state changes from @xmath0 to @xmath1 ; conversely , the qubit frequency increases by @xmath111 per each additional photon in the resonator . to measure the qubit state , a microwave field with frequency @xmath7 is either transmitted through or reflected from the resonator , then amplified and sent to the iq mixer , which measures both quadratures relative to the original microwave tone ( fig .  1 ) .",
    "the qubit state affects the resonator frequency and therefore affects the phase ( and in general amplitude ) of the outgoing microwave .",
    "an elementary fabry - prot analysis gives the classical ( complex ) microwave field @xmath112 inside the resonator : f_r = , [ fabry - perot]where @xmath113 is the applied incident field , @xmath114 is the transmission amplitude of the barrier from the incident side , @xmath115 is the resonator bandwidth due to the microwave leakage from the both sides ( the @xmath102-factor is @xmath116 ) , and the round - trip time is @xmath117 for a half - wavelength resonator and @xmath118 for a quarter - wavelength resonator . a similar formula with the same denominator describes a lumped resonator . in presence of the qubit , the resonator frequency @xmath3 in this formula",
    "is substituted by @xmath119 , depending on the qubit state .",
    "notice that for the quantum measurement analysis _ there is no difference between the cases of transmission and reflection _ for the same @xmath112 and @xmath115 , because the field leaking from the resonator is determined only by @xmath112 and @xmath115 .",
    "( the reflection case has a technical advantage of dealing with a twice smaller outgoing microwave field for the same measured signal . )",
    "however , an important parameter is the collected fraction @xmath120 of the leaking microwave power ; we will often assume the ideal case @xmath121 ( for the transmission setup this requires strongly asymmetric coupling , @xmath122 ) .    for simplicity",
    "we assume the resonant case , @xmath123 , then the ensemble qubit dephasing due to measurement is @xcite = 8 ^ 2|n/ , [ gamma - cqed]where @xmath124 is the average number of photons in the resonator .",
    "it is easy to include rabi oscillations into the model ; however , we do not do it for simplicity and also for more transparent analogy with sec .",
    "[ broadband ] , in which we considered a qubit with zero hamiltonian , evolving only due to measurement ; this case exactly corresponds to the cqed hamiltonian ( [ h - dispersive ] ) in the rotating frame .",
    "we will need several assumptions to describe the qubit state evolution in the process of measurement .",
    "first , for the validity of the dispersive approximation ( [ h - dispersive ] ) we need sufficiently large qubit - resonator detuning , @xmath125 , and not too many photons in the resonator , @xmath126 ( we do not consider the recently discovered nonlinear regime @xcite ) .",
    "second , to use the markov approximation for the evolution we need the so - called `` bad cavity '' assumption : @xmath127 ( if the qubit evolves due to rabi oscillations with frequency @xmath128 , we also need @xmath129 ) .",
    "this assumption means that the photons leave the resonator much faster than evolution of the qubit state , and therefore there is practically no entanglement between the qubit and unmeasured microwave field .",
    "this assumption also implies that the two resonator states for the qubit states @xmath0 and @xmath1 are almost indistinguishable , @xmath130 .",
    "third , we use the `` weak response '' assumption , which requires a small phase difference between the two resonator states , @xmath131 .",

    "when the microwave leaves the resonator , it does not yet `` know '' in which way it will be measured ( phase - preserving or phase - sensitive , which angle @xmath13 , etc . ) .",
    "moreover , when a circulator is used for the outgoing microwave , the field in the resonator and the qubit can never `` know '' in a realistic way which method of measurement is used .",
    "nevertheless , the qubit evolution strongly depends on the measurement method .",
    "as we discussed , the `` spooky '' evolution moves the qubit state along the meridians of the bloch sphere , the `` realistic '' back - action moves the state along the parallels , and the measurement method determines whether the qubit experiences the `` spooky '' or `` realistic '' back - action ( or their combination ) . in this sense",
    "the `` realistic '' back - action is not fully realistic : it has the physical mechanism , but whether this mechanism works or not is determined in a spooky way .",
    "the causality requires that we can not pass a `` useful '' information to the qubit by choosing the measurement method .",
    "this means that _ the ensemble - averaged evolution of the qubit can not depend on the measurement method ( this is the general requirement of causality in quantum mechanics)_. it is surely satisfied in our cqed setup .",
