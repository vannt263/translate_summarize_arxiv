    "during the last decade intensive debates have centered around the question what happens when a system evolves from a band to a mott insulator  @xcite in the context of different models in different dimensions  @xcite . like the extended hubbard model  @xcite and the ionic hubbard model  @xcite in one dimension , or the ionic hubbard model  @xcite in two dimensions .",
    "a model that has gained a lot of attention in recent years is the bilayer hubbard model on a square lattice .",
    "the discovery of bilayer band splitting in angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy experiments  @xcite for yba@xmath13cu@xmath14o@xmath15 ( ybco )  @xcite suggested the consideration of such a model as a minimal model for describing double - layered ybco compounds .",
    "in fact , the bilayer hubbard model ( see fig .  [ fig1:model ] ) was investigated by several groups within the dynamical mean field theory approximation ( dmft )  @xcite and cellular dmft  @xcite .",

    "only a small cluster size of @xmath16 ( two sites in one layer and two sites in another layer ) was used in previous cellular dmft calculations for the bilayer hubbard model  @xcite . for such sizes , the @xmath17 rotational symmetry of the square lattice",

    "we observe a transition from a mott to a band insulating state with tiny intralayer spin - spin correlations .",

    "as the interaction @xmath12 becomes larger than the critical value of the mott metal - to - insulator transition , the opening of a gap at the fermi level indicates @xmath98 , which requires large scattering rates at the positions of the poles .",

    "[ fig3:momentum ] ( b ) ) , pseudogaps exist in both heavily doped and nearly half - filled cases , indicating that a strong scattering rate is not a necessary condition for the appearance of non - fermi liquid behavior ; rather the short - range af correlations alone can be responsible for the non - fermi liquid behavior .",
    "furthermore , in order to confirm the transitions from the fermi liquid to mott insulator via non - fermi liquid as a function of electron doping ( or chemical potential ) , we plot the @xmath108 at the lower temperature @xmath109 and @xmath103 for @xmath20 in fig .",

    "in conclusion , we investigated a two - dimensional bilayer hubbard model on the square lattice as a function of band splitting and doping at a large interaction value @xmath20 by means of the dynamical cluster approximation with a @xmath21 site cluster with short - range spatial as well as quantum fluctuations .",
    "the scattering rate , which indicates the degree of mott physics , rapidly disappears in the momentum sectors ( @xmath6 ) and ( @xmath117 ) with increasing interlayer hopping @xmath4 .",
    "in fact we find a momentum - selective phase reentrant behavior from band insulating states at weak interlayer hopping @xmath118 to mott insulating behavior at @xmath119 and then from mott insulating to band insulating behavior at strong interlayer hopping @xmath120 .",
    "these transitions are identified from the scattering rates in the ( @xmath9 ) momentum sector of the bonding band and the ( @xmath10 ) momentum sector of the anti - bonding band at half filling .",
    "interesting phases are established with two consecutive phase transitions from a monolayer plaquette singlet mott insulator ( m - psmi ) to a band insulator through an intermediate phase , called bilayer plaquette singlet mott insulator ( b - psmi ) , where mott physics is more present in the @xmath27 sector of the bonding band and the @xmath86 of the anti - bonding band , rather than in the @xmath25 and @xmath121 sectors as usually observed in an antiferromagnetic mott insulator .",
    "we attribute the unusual consecutive phases to competition and cooperation between short - range spatial correlations with quantum fluctuations and interlayer hopping @xmath4 .",
    "the transition of mott to band insulator with the absence of large scattering rates in all momentum sectors is found at large interlayer hopping @xmath11 .",
    "furthermore , since the momentum - dependent evolution of the insulating behavior with @xmath4 is strongly controlled by the evolution of the fermi surface in the weak - coupling limit , we expect that consideration of larger clusters and different geometries in dca wo nt change this scenario qualitatively .",
    "finally we also find that away from half filling , non - fermi liquid behavior is dominated by antiferromagnetic correlations rather than the finite scattering rate at the fermi level .",
    "we suggest that this non - fermi liquid behavior might be related to anomalous phenomena like the fermi arc or hole pocket .",
    "we expect that momentum - selective phenomena may exist in many cases which calls for further studies in various models and real materials where the short - range spatial fluctuations are emphasized .",

    "<S> we investigate the nature of the insulating phases in a bilayer hubbard model with intralayer coupling @xmath0 and interlayer coupling @xmath1 at large interaction strength @xmath2 and half - filling . </S>",
    "<S> we consider a dynamical cluster approximation with a cluster size of @xmath3 , where short - range spatial fluctuations as well as on - site dynamical fluctuations are emphasized . by varying the band splitting ( @xmath4 ) </S>",
    "<S> , we find that at @xmath5 the mott behavior is rapidly suppressed in the momentum sectors ( @xmath6 ) and ( @xmath7 ) . at @xmath8 mott features dominate in the momentum sectors ( @xmath9 ) of the bonding band and ( @xmath10 ) of the anti - bonding band and at @xmath11 a tiny scattering rate is observed in all momentum sectors at the fermi level , indicating a transition from a mott to a band insulator . </S>",
    "<S> we attribute such a momentum - dependent evolution of the insulating behavior to the competition and cooperation between short - range spatial fluctuations and interlayer coupling @xmath1 with the help of the coulomb interaction @xmath12 . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we also discuss the possible appearance of non - fermi liquid behavior away from half - filling . </S>"
