    "during the last thirty years , a number of papers have been devoted to limit theorems for nonlinear transformations of gaussian processes and random fields .",
    "the pioneering results are those of taqqu  @xcite and dobrushin and major  @xcite , for convergence to gaussian and non - gaussian distributions , under long - range dependence , in terms of hermite expansions , as well as breuer and major  @xcite , ivanov and leonenko  @xcite , chambers and slud  @xcite , on convergence to the gaussian distribution by using diagram formulas or graphical methods .",
    "this line of research continues to be of interest today ; see berman  @xcite for @xmath0-dependent approximation approach , ho and hsing  @xcite for martingale approach , nualart and peccati  @xcite ( see also peccati and tudor  @xcite ) for the application of malliavin calculus , nourdin and peccati  @xcite in relation to stein s method and exact berry  esseen asymptotics for functionals of gaussian fields , avram , leonenko and sakhno  @xcite for an extension of graphical method for random fields , to name only a few papers .",
    "the volume of doukhan , oppenheim and taqqu  @xcite contains outstanding surveys of the field .",
    "limit theorems for weighted functionals of stochastic processes , and for processes with seasonalities were considered by a number of authors , including rosenblatt  @xcite , oppenheim , ould  haye and viano  r37 , haye  @xcite , and their references .",
    "limit theorems for nonlinear transformations of vector gaussian processes have been obtained by arcones  @xcite ; see also his references .",

    "some limiting distributions for the case when the two spectral point sets @xmath20 and @xmath27 are in fact overlapped , in discrete time , can be derived from the papers by rosenblatt  @xcite , arcones  @xcite , oppenheim , ould  haye and viano  @xcite and haye  @xcite . in continuous time , the limiting distributions for nonempty set , @xmath28 can be obtained from the paper of ivanov and leonenko  @xcite , and the book by ivanov and leonenko @xcite .",
