    "<S> this paper proposes a frequency domain approach to test the hypothesis that a complex - valued vector time series is proper , i.e. , for testing whether the vector time series is uncorrelated with its complex conjugate . </S>",
    "<S> if the hypothesis is rejected , frequency bands causing the rejection will be identified and might usefully be related to known properties of the physical processes . </S>",
    "<S> the test needs the associated spectral matrix which can be estimated by multitaper methods using , say , @xmath0 tapers . </S>",
    "<S> standard asymptotic distributions for the test statistic are of no use since they would require @xmath1 but , as @xmath0 increases so does resolution bandwidth which causes spectral blurring . in many analyses @xmath0 </S>",
    "<S> is necessarily kept small , and hence our efforts are directed at practical and accurate methodology for hypothesis testing for small @xmath2 our generalized likelihood ratio statistic combined with exact cumulant matching gives very accurate rejection percentages and outperforms other methods . </S>",
    "<S> we also prove that the statistic on which the test is based is comprised of canonical coherencies arising from our complex - valued vector time series . </S>",
    "<S> our methodology is demonstrated on ocean current data collected at different depths in the labrador sea .    </S>",
    "<S> overall this work extends results on propriety testing for complex - valued vectors to the complex - valued vector time series setting </S>",
