    "also similar laplace transforms may be considered for calabi - yau varieties such as complete intersections in grassmanians , and in particular for the 4th order differential operators of calabi - yau type classified in @xcite . however , in such generalizations , landau - ginzburg theories become less clear than for the hypersurface case .",
    "0.5 cm in the rest of this section , we present an interpretation of our stokes matrices from the perspective of mirror symmetry between @xmath254 and @xmath149 .",
    "0.5 cm    in the papers @xcite , the parameter @xmath148 in the stokes matrices has been set to @xmath344 for @xmath345 , respectively .",
    "this parameter is directly related to the ambiguity in the quadratic term of the prepotential ( the gererating function of the gromov - witten invariants ) and hence plays no role in the study of gromov - witten invariants . from our viewpoint of vanishing cycles , however , we should be able to fix this parameter by defining and integrating periods over the symplectic cycles @xmath346 . here , from table 1",
    ", we simply observe that by choosing @xmath347 for @xmath345 , respectively , the stokes matrix @xmath206 simplifies .",
    "furthermore , we may identify the form of the stokes matrices in terms of the invariants of @xmath254 as follows @xmath348 where @xmath349 and @xmath350 represent the structure sheaf of @xmath0 and a skyscraper sheaf on a point @xmath351 of @xmath0 , respectively , and @xmath352 , with @xmath353 the ample line bundle which generates the picard group @xmath354 .",
    "also , for coherent sheaves @xmath355 on @xmath0 @xmath356 by the riemann - roch theorem , one may easily verify that @xmath357 for @xmath358 , respectively .",
    "the fact that the entry @xmath359 in @xmath258 is common for all @xmath149 suggests a similar invariant interpretation , but we shall defer this to future studies . clearly , these invariant expressions are explained by the homological mirror symmetry conjecture , which implies the correspondence of @xmath349 and @xmath350 with the vanishing cycle @xmath232 and the torus cycle @xmath360 , respectively @xcite .",
    "then , @xmath248 represents the picard - lefschetz transform for the vanishing cycle @xmath239 , while @xmath206 corresponds to the case where the torus cycle @xmath238 vanishes .",
    "we can see these degenerations at the critical loci in @xmath33 and @xmath32 , respectively , of the the landau - ginzburg potential @xmath361 in @xmath33 , we see that the cycle @xmath362 vanishes and observe the picard - lefshetz transformation in the stokes matrix @xmath207 . on the other hand",
    ", @xmath32 has a degeneration charaterized by maximal unipotent monodromy . near this degeneration ,",
    "a torus fibration , called the syz fibration @xcite , has been constructed in @xcite using the amoeba picture @xcite of a suitable moment map image of @xmath363 .",
    "when @xmath364 goes to zero , the moment map image @xmath365 converges to the boundary of a four dimensional simplex which roughly describes the cycle @xmath366 .",
    "the dual cycle @xmath367 vanishes at each point on the ( five ) faces of the simplex , which explains the number @xmath368 in @xmath206 . in this picture",
    ", the ` picard - lefshetz ' transform @xmath206 represents a twisting of the zero section @xmath239 ( cf .",
    "our missing cycles @xmath346 in the symplectic basis should be found in the geometry of @xmath32 in a similar way .",
    "it is worthwhile reproducing here the well - known stokes matrices @xmath140 of the differential equation ( [ eqn : qdiff - ip4 ] ) for the quantum cohomology of the projective space @xmath369 @xcite . under a suitable choice of basis",
    ", the stokes matrices are calculated in @xcite and found to be @xmath370 and @xmath142 in terms of the coherent sheaves @xmath371 on @xmath369 . in this case , the landau - ginzburg potential @xmath372 in ( [ eqn : lg - f ] ) has five isolated critical points of ordinary double points , and each is considered to be the mirror of @xmath373 under a suitable ordering .",
