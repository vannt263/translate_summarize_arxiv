    "in the past , classical game theory has been extensively used to study problems such as stock market development , human as well as animal behavior or even the evolution of viruses at the microbiological level myerson1991,fudenberg1991,turner1999 .",
    "quantum versions meyer1999,eisert1999,benjamin2001 of existing games offer additional strategies to the players - and resolve dilemmas that occur in the classical versions . as it is possible to recast any algorithm ( classical or quantum ) as a game characterized by strategies and rules , it is reasonable to believe that the quantum mechanical formulation of existing games can also be helpful in gathering a deeper understanding of quantum algorithms and quantum information processing .",
    "it has even been argued that performing experiments in physics can be viewed as simply playing a game \" against nature in which the observer tries to maximize the information obtained from the system under consideration .",
    "eventually , such studies may even shed light on the great divide between classical and quantum physics @xcite .",
    "the prisoner s dilemma is a widely known example in classical game theory .",
    "it is a two players non - zero sum game where the players may benefit from unknowing cooperation . due to the interesting nature of the game and the fact that communication is forbidden ,",
    "defection turns out to be the unilateral best strategy , making it a",
    "_ nash_-equilibrium myerson1991 .",
    "the dilemma arises because this strategy does not provide both players with the collective best payoff ( which would be cooperation ) .",
    "however , extending the game into the quantum domain resolves the dilemma , as was first pointed out by eisert _",
    "_ @xcite . in the quantum version of the game",
    ", entanglement introduces some sort of cooperativity between the players and changes the nash - equilibrium , so that the collective best choice for both players and the best individual choices are equal .",
    "the quantum version of the prisoner s dilemma has recently been experimentally demonstrated using a nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) quantum computer @xcite . here we present the first optical implementation within the one - way model of quantum computation . by employing an all - optical system where the qubits are encoded in the polarization degree of freedom of the photons ,",
    "the quantum states are subject to negligible decoherence and can easily be distributed among distant players . moreover ,",
    "in stark contrast to nmr quantum computing @xcite , in an all - optical implementation the observed entanglement can always be described as pure - and since the introduction of entanglement gives rise to the interesting features of quantum games we consider it important to report on an experimental realization which is free of any ambiguity in this respect .",
    "our implementation of the quantum version of the prisoner s dilemma follows a recent proposal @xcite which uses optical cluster states to realize the quantum game s circuit . since cluster states are the resource states for one - way quantum computing briegel01,nielsen04b , raussendorf01,raussendorf03 , our demonstration is equivalent to playing the game on a quantum computer .",
    "the choice of a photonic system guarantees the externally - controlled implementation of the player s strategy to a high degree .",
    "additionally , the underlying principles of one - way quantum computing along with demonstrations of simple quantum algorithms @xcite as well as the generation of cluster states @xcite have recently been successfully demonstrated using linear optics .",
    "the subsequent parts of the paper are structured as follows . a brief explanation of the prisoner s dilemma in the classical as well as in the quantum domain is given in section [ ch_pris ] . a succinct introduction into the paradigm of one - way quantum computing and the formulation of the game in its context follows in section [ ch_owqc ] .",
    "the description of our experimental demonstration as well as the results of our investigation can be found in section [ ch_exp ] while the concluding discussion is in section [ ch_disc ] .",
    "the prisoner s dilemma is a non zero - sum two players game . in the classical version ,",
    "each player @xmath0 independently chooses a strategy @xmath1 which is a binary choice @xmath2 .",
    "the choices are sent to a supervising referee who computes the payoff of each player @xmath3 according to a payoff table .",
    "since both players aim to maximize their individual payoff , the game is known to have a non - cooperative and selfish character .",
    "the payoff table for player a is shown in table [ payoff_table ] and as it is a symmetric game , player b s payoffs are given by the transposed table . with the strategy profile @xmath4 neither player can increase his / her individual payoff regardless of the opposition , making it a _ nash equilibrium _ @xcite",
    ". however the cooperative profile @xmath5 is _ pareto - optimal _",
    "@xcite since no player can increase their payoff by changing strategy , without reducing the payoff of the opponent .",
    "classically , the dilemma arises since @xmath4 is a dominant profile ( rational reasoning causes both players to choose this strategy ) but the associated payoff is not the overall best available to them",
