    "one of the major components of the physics program at the lhc will be a detailed study of the properties of the top quark . in this talk",
    ", we report on recent theoretical work on how to observe spin correlations in the production and decay of top quark pairs via gluon fusion@xcite .",
    "the top quark is unique among the quarks in the standard model in that its decay lifetime is so short that it is predicted to decay before spin decorrelation takes place@xcite .",
    "thus , top quarks produced in a particular spin state will pass information about that state on to its decay products , and an investigation of the angular correlations among the decay products in select @xmath4 events can shed light on the details of the production and decay mechanisms .",
    "the mere observation of @xmath4 spin correlations would provide an upper limit on the top quark lifetime ; conversely , the observation of a lack of significant @xmath4 spin correlations would indicate the participation of the top quark in some sort of new strong interaction that causes spin decorrelation to occur more quickly than predicted by the standard model considerations of ref .",
    "thus , in the near - term , establishing the presence or absence of these correlations is a worthwhile physics goal . in the longer term , a detailed study of as many aspects of the correlations as possible will provide a series of additional wide - ranging tests of the standard model .",
    "the outline of this talk is as follows .",
    "we will begin with a detailed examination of the spin structure of the main top pair production mechanisms at the tevatron ( @xmath0 ) and lhc ( @xmath5 ) , with a particular emphasis on elucidating the spin state(s ) of the final @xmath4 pairs . in sec .  [",
    "sec : decays ] we will examine the angular distributions associated with the decay of polarized top quarks . combining the production properties with the decays will lead us to the strategies for observing the spin correlations .",
    "these strategies will be different for the tevatron ( sec .",
    "[ sec : fnal ] ) and lhc ( sec .",
    "[ sec : lhc ] ) . in sec .",
    "[ sec : future ] we will briefly consider some of the physics that could be accomplished with @xmath6 @xmath4 pairs at our disposal . finally , sec .  [ sec : conclusions ] contains a summary and our conclusions .",
    "additional details may be found in ref .",
    "the main two top quark pair production mechanisms at hadron colliders are @xmath0 , which dominates at the fermilab tevatron , and @xmath3 , which dominates at the lhc . in this section ,",
    "we examine the spin structure of each of these processes in some detail .",
    "the process @xmath0 proceeds through an @xmath7-channel gluon ; in order to couple to this gluon , the incoming @xmath8 pair must possess opposite helicities .",
    "the initial state is thus either @xmath9 or @xmath10 .",
    "we will focus our discussion on @xmath9 : results for @xmath10 may be generated by flipping all of the spins in the initial and final states .",
    "the top quark pairs produced from the @xmath9 are well - described by the off - diagonal spin basis@xcite ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : qqspins ] ) : at leading order the top quarks have opposite spins ( @xmath11 or @xmath12 ) 100% of the time using this spin quantization axis . at threshold ,",
    "the off - diagonal basis coincides with the beamline basis@xcite , the appropriate choice of quantization axis in the @xmath13 limit@xcite . at the other extreme ( @xmath14 ) , the off - diagonal basis coincides with the helicity basis . between these two extremes ,",
    "the off - diagonal basis smoothly interpolates from the beamline basis at small @xmath15 to the helicity basis in the ultra - relativistic limit while maintaining a spin state consisting of 100% opposite spin @xmath4 pairs .",
    "are best described by the off - diagonal basis .",
    "the angle between the top quark momentum and the spin vector in the zero momentum frame is given by @xmath16 where @xmath15 is the speed of the top quark in the zmf .",
    "the ratio of @xmath17 to @xmath18 production is @xmath19 .",
    "the results for the @xmath10 initial state may be obtained by reversing all of the spins in the diagram .",
    "the same spin structure also applies to @xmath3 with opposite helicity gluons . ]",
    "the gluon fusion top pair production mechanism possesses a very rich spin structure : the spin state of the @xmath4 is different for different gluon helicities .",
    "when the initial gluons have opposite helicity , the @xmath4 spin state is the same as for @xmath8 production ( fig .",
    "[ fig : qqspins ] ) .",
    "thus , the off - diagonal basis provides the description with the maximum @xmath4 spin correlation in this case .",
    "opposite helicity gluon pairs form the dominant contribution to @xmath3 when @xmath20 , or , equivalently , when @xmath21 .    on the other hand , when @xmath22 , like - helicity gluon pairs form the dominant contribution . in this case , it turns out that the helicity basis provides the best description of the @xmath4 spin correlations , no matter what the value of @xmath15 . like",
    "helicity gluons produce like - helicity @xmath4 pairs .",
    "the ratio of @xmath23 to @xmath24 production from a @xmath25 initial state is given by @xmath26 .",
    "we now consider the angular distributions associated with the decay of spin up top quarks .",
    "we define the decay angles in the top quark rest frame ; we will denote the angle between the @xmath27th particle and the top quark spin direction by @xmath28 .",
    "then , the decay angular distribution takes the simple form@xcite @xmath29 the analyzing power @xmath30 depends on which decay product we consider ; the values of @xmath30 at next - to - leading order@xcite are collected in table  [ tab : alphas ] .",

    "\\label{eq : doublediff}\\ ] ] eq .",
    "( [ eq : doublediff ] ) clearly displays the dependence on production ( @xmath44 is the number of events with like - spin @xmath4 pairs ; @xmath45 is the number of events with opposite - spin @xmath4 pairs ) and decay ( @xmath46 refer to the @xmath1 side of the event ; @xmath47 refer to the @xmath2 side of the event ; the angles are measured in the respective rest frames of the @xmath1 and @xmath2 ) .",
    "the next - to - leading - order corrections to this distribution have been presented in refs .",
    "@xcite ; these corrections will play an important role in future precision measurements of the correlations .",
    "at the fermilab tevatron , the strategy for observing the spin correlations in @xmath4 production and decay consists of reconstructing the double decay angular distribution eq .",
    "( [ eq : doublediff ] ) from the data .",
    "an examination of eq .",
    "( [ eq : doublediff ] ) indicates how to maximize the size of the correlations .",
    "first , one should choose a spin quantization axis that maximizes the asymmetry @xmath48 .",
    "since the dominant process at the tevatron is @xmath49 , this means using the off - diagonal basis , although in the long term it will be worthwhile to do the measurement using the helicity and beamline bases as well .",
    "measurements with multiple spin bases probe different aspects of the @xmath0 matrix element and provide a cross - check on the analysis .",
    "furthermore , the sources of systematic uncertainty are likely to vary greatly for different spin bases .",
    "second , one should choose @xmath1 and @xmath2 decay products with large analyzing powers (  the charged lepton or @xmath50-type quark ) .",
    "this consideration suggests looking in the dilepton or lepton+jets modes .",
    "the dilepton mode has the advantage of the maximum possible analyzing power , but suffers from a small branching ratio and the complications associated with the two ( unobserved ) neutrinos in the final state .",
    "the lepton+jets mode couples higher statistics with a much better ability to reconstruct the @xmath1 and @xmath2 rest frames , but has a lower analyzing power since the jet associated with the @xmath50-type quark must be selected probabilistically .",
    "eventually , given sufficient statistics , it will be useful to measure the correlations for as many different combinations of decay products as possible .",
    "although this is a very difficult analysis , both cdf and d0 have reported initial attempts to observe these correlations despite the limited data set currently available . at present , with only about half of the approximately 7  fb@xmath51 delivered by the tevatron analyzed so far , no unambiguous ( @xmath52 ) sign of the correlations has been seen ; however , both cdf and d0 plan on updates as well as a combined result in the near future@xcite .",
    "the dominant top quark pair production mechanism at the lhc is gluon fusion .",
    "the detailed study of this process using an arbitrary spin axis performed in ref .",
    "@xcite leads us to the following two conclusions : when @xmath53 , the best spin basis is the one which maximizes the like - spin fraction ( like - helicity gluons dominate in this region ) . on the other hand , when @xmath54 , the best spin basis is the one which maximizes the opposite - spin fraction ( opposite - helicity gluons dominate in this region ) . because the lhc will be a copious source of @xmath4 pairs ( about @xmath55 @xmath4 pairs per fb@xmath51 at full beam energy ; even at reduced energy there will be @xmath56 to @xmath57 pairs per fb@xmath51 ) , there will be room to implement significant cuts on the data before statistical uncertainties become comparable to the systematic uncertainties .",
    "thus , we will focus on the @xmath53 region . in this region , like - helicity gluons to like - helicity @xmath4 pairs dominate .",
    "since @xmath15 is restricted to fairly moderate values in most of this region , the spin correlations wo nt be masked by large boosts , and one could , in principle , employ the same analysis as has been used at the tevatron .",
    "another option exists , however .    in order to motivate this alternative",
    ", we will examine the ratio @xmath58 which compares the sum of the squares of the like - helicity amplitudes for the fully - correlated @xmath3 matrix elements to the same sum for matrix elements calculated with a toy model employing top quark decays which are spherical in their rest frames ( but with all other decays  the @xmath59 s  fully correlated ) . in terms of the cosines of the angles in the zmf between various pairs of particles and the zmf speed of the top quarks , @xmath60 \\biggl [ { { ( 1+\\beta^2 )    + ( 1-\\beta^2)c_{\\bar{e}\\mu }    -2\\beta^2 c_{t\\bar{e } } c_{\\bar{t}\\mu } } \\over { ( 1-\\beta c_{t\\bar{e } } )    ( 1-\\beta c_{\\bar{t}\\mu } } ) } \\biggr],\\ ] ] which reduces to @xmath61 for @xmath62 .",
    "so , at smallish values of @xmath15 , the difference between the correlated and uncorrelated versions of the matrix elements is sensitive to the angle between the two charged leptons , suggesting that we examine @xmath63 , @xmath64 , and @xmath65 for these two particles . of these three distributions",
    ", @xmath63 turns out to be the most sensitive to the presence or absence of @xmath4 spin correlations .",
    "this distribution also enjoys the advantage of being invariant under longitudinal boosts ; once the event sample has been selected , this measurement can be made in the laboratory frame without the complications associated with the reconstruction of and boost to some special frame of reference distribution in @xmath0 is insensitive to the presence or absence of spin correlations .",
    "thus , this observable is not particularly interesting at the tevatron . ] .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : dphi ] , we present a comparison of the correlated and uncorrelated distributions in @xmath63 for the two leptons in a sample of dilepton events . in the plot on the left , the events were required to have a @xmath4 invariant mass of less than 400 gev to ensure that they sample the like - helicity - gluon - dominated @xmath66 region of phase space .",
    "clearly this distribution has significant sensitivity to the presence or absence of spin correlations .",
    "unfortunately , the pair of neutrinos in these events makes a full reconstruction of the event impossible and @xmath67 4-momenta , two of these constraints are quadratic , leading to up to 4 distinct solutions for each of the two possible pairings of @xmath59-bosons ( leptons ) with @xmath40 jets .",
    "thus , there are up to 8 distinct values of @xmath68 generated by the reconstruction program . ] , and we must look for an alternate means of selecting the @xmath66 region . in the plot on the right ,",
    "the event selection is based on the value of the ( nave ) unweighted average of the various @xmath68 values produced by the neutrino reconstruction routine .",
    "cutting on this quantity has the unfortunate side - effect of producing a systematic depletion of events near @xmath69 ; however , this depletion affects both models in a similar fashion and significant discriminating power remains .",
    "what we have here is a proof - of - concept : to do the actual measurement it will be necessary to understand the detector systematics and nlo corrections to the @xmath63 distribution very well .",
    "left open are the questions of whether a better substitute for the true value of @xmath68 exists as well as the optimal maximum value of @xmath68 to use in selecting the data .",
    ", @xmath70 .",
    "the solid curve is for the fully correlated case whereas the dashed curve assumes that the top quarks decay spherically in their respective rest frames . in the plot on the left , a cut restricting the ( true ) invariant mass of the @xmath4 pairs to a maximum of 400",
    "gev has been applied to the distributions ; in the plot on the right , the cut restricts the ( nave ) unweighted average of all of the reconstructed values of @xmath68 for each event to a maximum of 400  gev . ]",
    "we now turn to the lepton+jets mode .",
    "this channel has the advantage of larger statistics than dilepton mode , and only a single , over - constrained , neutrino to be reconstructed .",
    "thus , it is possible to do a good job of locating the zmf and calculating @xmath68 .",
    "this mode has one disadvantage , however : it is not possible to know with 100% certainty which of the two @xmath59-decay jets corresponds to the @xmath50-type quark .",
    "thus , it is necessary to use our best informed guess to select this jet on a probabilistic basis .",
    "the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite suggest using the jet which has the smallest spatial separation from the @xmath40 jet in the @xmath59 rest frame ; this is equivalent to selecting the jet with the lowest energy in the @xmath1 rest frame@xcite .",
    "although this is the correct choice only about 60% of the time , it is good enough to provide an analyzing power of 0.4734 to 0.4736 at nlo@xcite , depending on what jet reconstruction algorithm is used .    because the zmf is well - determined in lepton+jets mode , it is possible to examine the actual opening angle between the lepton and the @xmath50-jet candidate ( fig .",
    "[ fig : cth ] ) .    , @xmath71 , where @xmath72 is the zmf angle between the charged lepton and the @xmath50-quark jet ( defined to be the jet which is spatially closest to the @xmath40-tagged jet in the @xmath59 rest frame ; this is also the jet with the lowest energy in the top quark rest frame ) .",
    "the solid curve is for the fully - correlated case whereas the dashed curve assumes that the top quarks decay spherically in their respective rest frames .",
    "a cut restricting the invariant mass of the @xmath4 pairs to a maximum of 400  gev has been applied to these distributions . ]    taking half of the area between the correlated and uncorrelated curves to be a measure of the potential sensitivity of this observable , we note that this half - area is equal to 0.07 for the @xmath73 distribution , as compared to a value of 0.11 for the @xmath74 distribution .",
    "however , this somewhat reduced sensitivity could easily be offset by the higher statistics of the lepton+jets mode .",
    "furthermore , the systematics of this measurement are certainly very different than those associated with the @xmath63 distribution ; thus , further investigation of this variable by the experimental collaborations is warranted .    before closing this section on the lhc , we present fig .",
    "[ fig : energydep ] , which summarizes the effect of running the lhc at reduced energy on the ability to observe @xmath4 spin correlations .",
    "the conclusion to be drawn from the three plots in fig .",
    "[ fig : energydep ] is that the biggest penalty of running at reduced energy comes from the much smaller @xmath4 production cross section : the size of the spin correlations is essentially unchanged as one reduces @xmath75 from 14  tev to 7  tev .",
    "thus , the prospects of observing these correlations with the data collected during the early stages of running are good .    .",
    "( a ) total leading order cross section for @xmath76 .",
    "these values should be multiplied by the branching fraction to dileptons ( 4.6% ) or lepton - plus - jets ( 29% ) , as appropriate .",
    "we include only the @xmath77 and @xmath78 channels .",
    "( b ) fraction of dilepton and lepton plus jets events with @xmath79  gev . for dilepton events ( crosses )",
    "we employ the unweighted average of the up to 8 solutions for the @xmath4 invariant mass . for lepton+jets events ( diamonds )",
    "the true value of @xmath68 may be reconstructed and used in event selection .",
    "( c ) half of the area between the appropriate unit - normalized angular distributions for the fully correlated and spherical cases . for leptons+jets events ( crosses )",
    ", we use the distribution in @xmath80 , where @xmath72 is the angle between the charged lepton and the @xmath50-jet candidate in the zero momentum frame of the event . for dilepton events ( diamonds )",
    ", we use the azimuthal opening angle @xmath63 between the two charged leptons . ]",
    "before concluding , let us take a moment or two to comment on the sorts of precision tests of the standard model that could be done with the few million @xmath4 pairs that will ultimately be available at the lhc , beginning with the couplings between gluons and the top quark .",
    "all 3 of the diagrams for @xmath3 influence the spin correlations ; these diagrams are related in a very specific manner to satisfy su(3 ) gauge - invariance .",
    "thus , a test of the spin correlations can be viewed as a test of qcd gauge - invariance .",
    "the time scale for the top quark is expected to be much shorter than the spin decorrelation time scale .",
    "this fact offers us the opportunity to perform a direct test of the predicted @xmath81 structure of the @xmath82 vertex , the only quark for which such a test is possible . by measuring the size of the correlations for different combinations of decay products , it will be possible , with sufficient data , to perform measurements of the analyzing powers of all of the top quark decay products listed in table  [ tab : alphas ]",
    "may be possible , and a detailed feasibility study should be performed to investigate this possibility . ]",
    "in addition , one ought to look for non - standard model couplings and/or couplings to new particles , such as kaluza - klein gluons , `` extra '' higgs bosons , or `` extra '' @xmath83-bosons .",
    "should a new particle that couples strongly to the top quark be observed as a resonance in the @xmath4 channel , then the spin correlations of the @xmath4 pairs produced in the resonance region of phase space would bear the imprint of the spin and parity of the new particle and serve as a useful diagnostic in identifying the nature of the new physics .",
    "in summary , we have seen that the tevatron and lhc probe two different aspects of spin correlations in top quark pair production and decay . at the tevatron ,",
    "the production cross section is dominated by @xmath49 . for this process",
    ", the off - diagonal spin basis provides the largest signal of spin correlations .",
    "the strategy for observing the correlations at the tevatron involves extracting a joint decay distribution utilizing decay angles in the @xmath1 and @xmath2 rest frames . at present , this challenging measurement is limited by low statistics .    at the lhc ,",
    "the production cross section is dominated by @xmath5 . at high values of the @xmath4 invariant",
    "mass , opposite helicity gluons to opposite spin @xmath4 pairs dominate the cross section ; the correlations involved are the same as for @xmath0 . at low values of the @xmath4 invariant mass , like helicity gluons",
    "dominate the cross section ; these gluons primarily produce like - helicity @xmath4 pairs . by cutting on the value of @xmath68 ,",
    "it is possible to enhance the contributions from either like or opposite helicity gluon pairs .",
    "in addition to a repeat of a tevatron - style analysis , promising observables for observing spin correlations include the azimuthal opening angle between the two leptons in dilepton events and the cosine of the angle between the lepton and @xmath50-jet candidate in the zmf in lepton+jets mode . with millions of @xmath4 pairs on the horizon , precision ( % -level ) measurements of the various correlation parameters",
    "should be possible during the next decade .",
