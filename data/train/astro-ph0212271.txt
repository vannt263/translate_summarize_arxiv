    "ngc  253 is a nearby ( @xmath4  mpc ; @xcite ) , nearly edge - on ( @xmath5 , @xcite ) , isolated starburst galaxy with the starburst strongly concentrated at the nucleus .",
    "based on the distribution of the 1030  @xmath6 m continuum , the bulk of ngc  253 s starburst is confined to a @xmath7  pc region centered just south - west of the dynamical nucleus @xcite .",
    "the 1300  @xmath6 m luminosity within about 30@xmath8  is @xmath9 @xcite while the total ir luminosity of ngc  253 detected by iras is @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "there is a clear bar in the 2mass image of the galaxy , and the kinematics show evidence for orbits in a bar potential ( @xcite ; ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) ) .",
    "the bar likely plays a role in transporting gas to the nucleus and thus supporting the starburst .",
    "current estimates of the neutral gas mass in the central @xmath11 range from @xmath12 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter hhr99 ) to @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "as is the case in many of the nearby starburst galaxies , much of the molecular gas in ngc  253 appears to be highly excited @xcite .",
    "observations of  and  transitions of co @xcite , as well as  and transitions of hcn @xcite suggest that a large fraction of the molecular gas in the nucleus of ngc 253 has @xmath14 and @xmath15 or higher .",
    "observations of higher - j co transitions are critical to measure this warm molecular gas component , and probe its physical conditions . in our galaxy ,",
    "the warm , dense molecular gas conditions which excite the mid - j co lines ( j  =  48 ) are typically associated with molecular cloud surfaces exposed to stellar far - uv radiation . in these photodissociation regions ( pdrs ) , the uv dissociates and ionizes the gas as it enters the cloud and is absorbed by dust .",
    "the result is a layered geometry based on the extinction of uv ; the progression from the exterior inward is ionized , neutral atomic , warm molecular , and finally cool molecular gas on the interior @xcite .",
    "several of these regions have been studied in star formation sites within the galaxy @xcite , and they have been discussed in the context of starburst nuclei @xcite .",
    "other potential molecular gas heating sources are outflows and cloud - cloud collisions in which shocks convert dynamical energy to thermal energy of the gas , such as in the circumnuclear disk of the galactic center , and in the massive star formation sites w  51 and dr  21 @xcite .",
    "finally , it has been proposed that much of the molecular gas heating in starburst nuclei may be due to cosmic rays ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter sah ) . to better understand the energy balance of the molecular gas in the starburst nucleus of ngc 253 ,",
    "we have observed the co  transition with our submillimeter imaging spectrometer , spifi on the jcmt .",
    "ngc  253 was observed in april 1999 during the commissioning run of the south pole imaging fabry - perot interferometer ( spifi ) @xcite at the james clerk maxwell telescope ( jcmt ) on mauna kea , hawaii .",
    "the fabry - perot interferometer ( fpi ) was set to a velocity resolution of 70  km  s@xmath16 and was scanned over 620  km  s@xmath16 with the center wavelength of the scan set to the redshifted ( 250  km  s@xmath16 ) co  rotational transition .",
    "the fpi scan length was measured with interference fringes of a he - ne laser , and absolute frequency reference was an absorption spectrum of the @xmath17 co transition from gas in a cell against a hot load . on this observing campaign",
    "the bolometer array was equipped with 12 functioning detectors arranged on a @xmath18 grid with four blanks .",
    "because of a figuring error in the polyethylene lenses used as a f - converter , the main beam as measured with mars had a size of @xmath19 ( fwhm ) , 1.6 times bigger than the diffraction - limited beam size of @xmath20 per pixel .",
    "mars was also used for flux calibration assuming a brightness temperature of 201  k @xcite .",
    "flat - fielding of the array was accomplished by rastering mars around the array . for the period of the observations , the zenith atmospheric transmission was between 0.22 and 0.29 , giving a transmission to the source between 0.050.12 .",
    "this low and variable atmospheric transmission provided the greatest calibration uncertainty , which we estimate to be about 30% .",
    "for the observation of ngc  253 the array was centered at the ir nucleus at @xmath21 , @xmath22 ( 1950 ) ( ( 0,0)-position ) .",
    "we estimate our pointing accuracy to be 5@xmath8 .",
    "the data were obtained by chopping and nodding the telescope and the data presented here were obtained with 20 minutes on - source integration . the 50 minute duration of the observations resulted in a field rotation of 18@xmath23about the center of the array , producing a total travel of 7@xmath8  ( @xmath243.5@xmath8  about the mean ) for the corners of the array . because this is comparable to the pointing uncertainty , and is substantial only for the corner pixels , we neglect the rotation and adopt the mean position angle .",
    "figure  [ fig : point253 ] shows the spectra obtained in this single array pointing toward the nucleus of ngc  253 .",
    "the data are plotted in main beam brightness temperature units , correcting for beam efficiency , atmospheric transmission , and source coupling .",
    "typical spectra peak at 35  k , with a single spectrum showing a peak of 12  k ; integrated intensities are between 400 and 1200  k  km  s@xmath16 . the integrated intensities in k  km  s@xmath16 are roughly half of the co  intensities of @xcite , when the  antenna temperatures are corrected to a @xmath25 main beam .",
    "the peak temperature of 12 k at @xmath26  km  s@xmath16 in the spectrum just northeast of the nucleus has a similar peak above the gaussian profile in the spectrum toward the nucleus .",
    "in addition to the bright spectra near the nucleus , we detect emission at 3040% of the nuclear value at positions 10@xmath820@xmath8  offset from the nucleus . @xcite also detect strong co  emission at offset positions .",
    "they measure an integrated intensity 60% of the nuclear value as far as @xmath27 offset , consistent with our observations .",
    "interferometric observations of millimeter wave cs @xcite , co @xcite , and sio @xcite transitions show evidence for a nuclear bar with major axis oriented 70@xmath28 east of north .",
    "the velocity field of this bar shows a 100@xmath29  shift from the northeast to the southwest .",
    "though the  map does not have the resolution or sampling to spatially resolve the bar , it also shows the velocity shifting from 150 - 200  @xmath29  in the northeast to 250 - 300  @xmath29  in the southwest , showing the overall kinematics of gas in the bar , in good agreement with the interferometric observations . the observed line widths are between 200 and 300@xmath29 , consistent with the 150 to 240  @xmath29  line widths observed in the lower - j co lines with 12 to 15@xmath8  beams ( @xcite ; hhr99 ) , convolved with our 70  @xmath29  lorentzian instrumental profile .      to make quantitative estimates of the physical parameters of the nuclear molecular gas",
    "we have compiled all co rotational transitions observed toward the central 15@xmath8  available in the literature to compare with predictions of an escape probability , large velocity gradient model for co line excitation .",
    "in contrast with previous studies of the molecular material in starburst galaxies which invoke two components ( hhr99 ) or complex pdr models @xcite , _ our modeling suggests that the observed @xmath30 and @xmath31 intensities can be reproduced with the bulk of the gas mass at fairly high excitation .",
    "_ the line ratios can be fit with a range in conditions from @xmath32 , @xmath33 to @xmath34 , @xmath35 .",

    "combining the @xmath38co transitions constrains the column density to be only slightly larger than that measured by hhr99 in a 23@xmath8  beam .",
    "to reproduce the observed intensities with the lvg formalism requires large velocity gradients ( @xmath39 ) , which are much higher than is traditionally used , but nevertheless plausible for the starburst nucleus .",

    "in addition to the @xmath40co intensity ratios , the optically - thin isotopes can be useful in constraining the @xmath40co optical depths , which are greater than unity for the lines of interest . in order to concentrate on the nuclear gas ,",
    "we do not put much emphasis on the transition . since it connects the ground state and and",
    "the @xmath57 level is only 6 k above ground , the  transition traces any molecular material in the beam .",
    "a related and more confusing problem is the potential for self - absorption by quiescent material along the line of sight but exterior to the nucleus , a particular concern for nearly edge - on systems such as ngc  253 .",
    "this may be the reason that any model which fits the  and higher transitions over predict . in an approach similar to that of hhr99",

    "we have assumed a co abundance @xmath62  of @xmath63 , the value measured for galactic clouds @xcite . while the metallicity in the nucleus of ngc  253 is as much as 3 @xmath64 solar @xcite",
    ", the large observed [ ci ] intensities suggest that , relative to the galaxy , the gas - phase carbon budget includes a much larger neutral carbon fraction , and smaller co fraction @xcite , thus the co abundance is not clearly much higher in spite of the large metallicity .",
    "intensity ratio calculations for a higher co abundance are identical to those with the canonical @xmath62value , but with the velocity gradient decreased by the same ratio . raising the co abundance or lowering the velocity gradient increases the the optical depth in the lines .",
    "figure  [ fig : ntplot ] plots the results of lvg calculations of diagnostic line ratios as a function of gas temperature , density , and velocity gradient .",
    "we have found that the  to  intensity ratio is a good measure of the overall excitation , and that matching this ratio typically satisfies all the lines above  to within the observational uncertainties . as can be seen from the solid contours in figure  [ fig : ntplot ] , the @xmath40co to  intensity ratio of 7.7 means that the gas is of high excitation . because the run of line intensity with j is increasing up to",
    ", there is no unique solution , nor even upper limits to the temperature or density .",
    "lower limits , however , are strong . for temperatures",
    "less than 300  k , the density must be greater than @xmath65 . a temperature less than 150 k requires a density greater than @xmath66 , clearly different from the typical galactic molecular cloud .",
    "to first order , these results are independent of the velocity gradient and co abundance because the lines are optically thick , even at velocity gradients as large as 80 @xmath67 .",
    "if their abundances relative to the main isotope are known , the intensities in the @xmath38co transitions can be used to determine the @xmath40co optical depths .",
    "this is the approach taken by hhr99 in their study of the nuclear regions of ngc  253 with the lower - j lines .",
    "the key to their analysis is the assumption of a @xmath40co to @xmath38co abundance ratio of 4050 , originating from analysis by @xcite .",
    "our results are consistent with a ratio on the upper end of this range , and we have chosen 50 as a value to use in the model plots .",
    "included in figure  [ fig : ntplot ] as dashed lines are the @xmath40co to @xmath38co  intensity ratios predicted by the lvg models",
    ". the observed ratio of 12 is plotted as a thick dashed line . to correctly obtain the line intensity ratios between the two isotopes",
    "requires running the full lvg model for the optically thin species , since radiative trapping is important in determining the level populations of @xmath40co but is much less so for the optically thin species .",
    "because the @xmath38co transitions are optically thin for all relevant conditions , the values plotted in figure  [ fig : ntplot ] can be shifted to accommodate a different isotope ratio . in the density - temperature plane ,",
    "a larger isotope ratio is considered by choosing a line ratio contour with a value decreased from the observed 12 by the same factor .    in the panels of figure  [ fig : ntplot ] ,",
    "the temperature and density at which the two observed line ratios meet is the regime of possible solutions .",
    "it is evident that small velocity gradients are unable to generate the observed line ratios . at these small velocity gradients ,",
    "the conditions which excite upper - j lines generate large optical depths in the @xmath40co lines , and their fluxes are too small compared with the optically thin isotope . increasing the velocity gradient does provide possible solutions , again , with high excitation conditions in both temperature ( t@xmath68100 k ) and density ( @xmath69 ) . though unconventional in lvg analyses ,",
    "the large velocity gradient is plausible for the starburst nucleus , and is discussed in section  [ sec : velocity - dispersion ] .      even though the @xmath40co lines are optically thick , their observed intensities put lower limits on the co column density independent of the optically thin isotopes .",
    "the intensity in a line is determined by the product of column density in the upper level and the optical depth factor @xmath70 , hence a lower optical depth ( larger velocity gradient ) generates more emission for a given co column density .",
    "the curves in figure  [ fig : cdplot ] show the column density required by the lvg model to reproduce the observed intensities . for each velocity gradient ,",
    "the curve is parametrized in terms of temperature , with the density determined according to the observed @xmath40co line ratio shown in figure  [ fig : ntplot ] .",
    "examination of figure  [ fig : cdplot ] indicates that the column density of warm gas must be substantial .",
    "for example , if the gas has a temperature below 200  k and velocity gradient below 40 @xmath67 , the column density must be larger than @xmath71 , a lower limit which is comparable to the @xmath72 estimated in the central 23@xmath8  with the  and lower transitions ( hhr99 ) .    to improve upon the lower limits provided by the @xmath40co transitions alone , we incorporate the @xmath38co intensities .",
    "the boxes in figure  [ fig : cdplot ] show the column densities required by the lvg model under the conditions corresponding to the intersections of the two diagnostic line ratio curves in the panels of figure  [ fig : ntplot ] .",
    "boxes are plotted for values of @xmath73  = 10 , 20 , 40 and 80 @xmath67 , as velocity gradients less than 10 @xmath67  do not allow reasonable solutions .",
    "the sizes of the boxes correspond to a @xmath2430% uncertainty in temperature , and an corresponding uncertainty in column density given by local slope of the t-@xmath74 relation .",
    "the locus of these regions indicates that the co column density is between 37@xmath75 , for all allowed values of the excitation .",
    "this is consistent with the @xmath40co upper limits , and is comparable to the value derived by hhr99 for the central 23@xmath8 .",
    "the results of our lvg analysis can be summarized as follows : the molecular gas in the central 180 pc of ngc  253 is much more highly excited than that traced with only the lower - j lines in a larger 280 pc beam .",
    "the gas is warmer than 100  k , and has a density greater than @xmath76 .",
    "the @xmath40co lines have optical depths not larger than 24 , requiring velocity gradients @xmath77 @xmath67 , larger than traditionally employed in lvg studies . even larger velocity gradients ( @xmath78 @xmath67 )",
    "are required if the temperature is constrained to be below 200  k. the co column density is well - determined by the @xmath38co lines : @xmath7937@xmath80 , only slightly larger than the values estimated in a larger beam .",
    "finally , while the @xmath38co  transition requires an additional component of cool and/or diffuse gas , this component is small by mass , negligible energetically , and may not even be associated with the nuclear region .",
    "there is no reason to invoke a large component of cool gas as would be required , for example , in a study of the central regions of the milky way .",
    "previous lvg studies of ngc  253 and m82 have employed a velocity gradient of around 1  @xmath67 , which is approximately the ratio of the total observed velocity width to the size of the observed region ( hhr99 ; @xcite ) , and comparable to the values used in studies of galactic molecular clouds .",
    "this is a lower limit to the true velocity gradient in the material , appropriate if it were only subject to the central potential of the galaxy with no local motion . in reality ,",
    "clouds and clumps will be subject to their own gravity as well as that of the stars around them .",
    "the escape velocity of a self gravitating cloud of radius r , and density @xmath81 determines a velocity gradient given by @xmath82 , which gives 10 @xmath67 , for a density of @xmath83 .",
    "models on the low end of the allowed temperature range , e.g. t  @xmath1  120 k require a velocity gradient of order 40  @xmath67 , a factor of 4 larger than this escape velocity .",
    "this is not implausible ; if the star - forming clouds in ngc  253 are similar to the orion molecular cloud core , then one might expect the stellar mass density to be about 4 times the gas density @xcite , which would double the effective escape velocity . furthermore , @xcite find the pressure of the ionized gas in the central 45 \" of ngc  253 is @xmath84 - larger than the thermal pressure within our modeled molecular gas .",
    "this high pressure ionized gas has a large volume filling factor ( 0.01 to 0.3 ) within their much larger ( 45@xmath8 ) beams .",
    "it is thus quite plausible that within our 15@xmath8  modeled region the ionized gas place a important role in cloud confinement , further increasing the velocity dispersion in the gas . in short ,",
    "the large velocity gradients required for a good model fit are very plausible given the dynamics in the nucleus of ngc  253 .",
    "because the  transition is not high enough to see the turn - over in co excitation , the co analysis does not provide a good upper limit to the gas temperature .",
    "fortunately , we can use the iso h@xmath3  pure rotational line observations to provide an important temperature constraint .",
    "@xcite have recently reported iso sws observations of the pure rotational lines of h@xmath3  from the central 14@xmath8  @xmath64  20@xmath8  regions of ngc  253 .",
    "these quadrupole h@xmath3  lines have low radiative rates , so they are easily thermalized and optically thin . in principle",
    "the lines can be used to measure temperature and column density . however , even the lowest h@xmath3  rotational transition energy is 515  k , thus the observed line emission is heavily biased toward the very warmest regions ( which may be negligible by mass ) , and each observed transition is an exponential function of gas temperature . not surprisingly , the line intensities are not consistent with a single excitation temperature .",
    "based on the s(0 ) , s(1 ) , s(2 ) , s(5 ) , and s(7 ) lines , @xcite conclude that there must be a substantial mass of warm , dense gas in the nucleus of ngc  253 , broadly consistent with our results .",
    "more specifically , the modeled molecular hydrogen column density of @xmath8548@xmath86 is consistent with the s(0 ) data presented by @xcite for gas temperatures in the range of 95120  k. we therefore favor models on the low end of the temperature range allowed by co analysis . because of the exponential dependence on temperature , this h@xmath3  temperature constraint is a rather weak function of h@xmath3  column density , hence also a weak function of co column density and co abundance .",
    "we combine this h@xmath3  result with the parameter ranges allowed by the lvg analysis , and the physical constraint of a small velocity gradient to arrive at our preferred model , shown in figure  [ fig : fit253 ] .",
    "this model uses @xmath73  = 40 @xmath67 , toward the bottom of the range allowed by the low temperature and the observed @xmath38co intensity . as described above",
    ", the lower velocity gradients are more consistent with gravitationally bounds clouds .",
    "the modeled conditions are @xmath87 , @xmath88 , and the co column density required to generate the observed line intensities is @xmath89 . at this temperature , about 40@xmath90 of the observed h@xmath3  s(1 ) flux is generated in the bulk component , and the contributions to the higher - j h@xmath3  lines ( which require excitation of levels with @xmath91 ) are less than 10% of the observed line fluxes . as an estimate of the uncertainties , we note that even with the temperature constrained , a larger velocity gradient still allows a smaller column density .",
    "decreasing the velocity gradient , or increasing the co abundance can permit a larger column density , but this quickly becomes inconsistent with the @xmath38co observations unless the @xmath38co relative abundance is decreased below our adopted 1/50 . combining all the uncertainties in the abundance ratio , modeling , and observations",
    ", we estimate an uncertainty of 40% for the final adoped column density : @xmath92 .",
    "our model parameters are summarized in table  [ tab : props ] .      with the assumed co abundance relative to h@xmath3  of @xmath63",
    ", the co column density corresponds to a mass of excited molecular gas in the central 15@xmath8  of 2.55.1@xmath93 . in reality , the co abundance is not well - known .",
    "the abundance may be larger than the canonical galactic value , given the 3@xmath64 solar metallicity ( but see discussion above ) , and this would result in a smaller gas mass by as much as a factor of 3 . based on an assumed carbon gas to dust ratio and the measured fractions of gaseous carbon bearing species , hhr99 infer a co abundance relative to h@xmath3of @xmath94 , that is , about the factor of 3 larger than our adopted value . with this abundance",
    ", the gas mass would be smaller : 0.91.8@xmath93 .",
    "we do note a larger co abundance demands even larger velocity gradients ( more than 30 @xmath67 ) to allow working solutions . for comparison ,",
    "the most recent estimate of the gas mass based on 1.3 mm dust continuum is @xmath95 ( hhr99 , @xcite ) .",
    "since the 1.3 mm continuum has a half - power size of only 16@xmath8  @xmath64 11@xmath8 much of this flux arises within our within our 15@xmath8  beam , and traces the same material .",
    "the agreement with our derived gas mass suggests that while our co abundance may be slightly high , it is not off by more than a factor of 2 .",
    "it is traditionally thought that mid - j co emission originates in the pdr surfaces of molecular clouds exposed to uv starlight . in this scenario , the warm excited gas is separate from the bulk of the molecular gas , and usually represents a small fraction of the total mass .",
    "observations of several pdr regions in the galaxy have motivated modeling which includes detailed pdr chemistry and radiative transfer to predict the line emission . @xcite",
    "have constructed detailed models of pdrs on the surfaces of small clumps to predict @xmath40co and @xmath38co line intensities in star - formation regions .",
    "relative to a simple plane - parallel model , the clumpy geometry allows an increase in local gas density , and allows uv photons to penetrate to a greater fraction of the gas , increasing the overall molecular excitation level .",
    "while such models are successful in reproducing the intensity ratios between @xmath40co lines , they fail to account for both the large integrated intensities and the large @xmath40co to @xmath38co intensity ratios observed in a starburst nucleus such as ngc  253 . for example , @xcite model slabs with thickness given by @xmath96 , illuminated from both sides , including chemistry of both @xmath40c- and @xmath38c - bearing species .",
    "the ratios among the @xmath40co lines are well - fit with @xmath97 , @xmath98 habing ( @xmath99 ) , but to generate the observed  flux in the central 15@xmath8of ngc  253 with a superposition of these regions would require between 5 and 20 times the co column density estimated with our lvg analysis .",
    "the @xmath38co lines show the same effect  the predicted  @xmath40co to @xmath38co intensity ratio is around 3 , compared with the observed value in 15@xmath8  of @xmath100 ( hhr99 ) .",
    "thus the existing pdr models are not appropriate for the global properties of a starburst nucleus .",
    "the key problem is the high optical depth in the pdr models , resulting from the small assumed velocity width per gas column .",
    "the effective velocity gradient of the clumpy pdr model is around 9  @xmath67 , too low as we have discovered in section  [ sec : model - fit ] .    to consider a pdr scenario with the appropriate optical depths in the lines for ngc  253 , we have examined lvg models with two distinct gas components . though this approach is not as rigorous as a full treatment of the chemistry and uv penetration used by the galactic pdr models , to first order it accounts for the combination of warm uv - exposed surfaces and cool cloud interiors which together would generate the observed co emission . for ngc  253",
    ", we have found that while it is possible to fit the observed intensities without the full mass of gas being highly excited , the warm fraction must be substantial . to reproduce the observed  and  transitions ,",
    "at least 30% of the total column density estimated with the @xmath38co ratio must have high excitation conditions .",
    "furthermore , the curves in figure  [ fig : cdplot ] shows that this scenario requires an extremely large velocity gradient ( @xmath1100  @xmath67 ) and/or very high temperatures ( @xmath1300 k ) in this 1/3 warm fraction in order to reproduce the observed intensities .",
    "moreover , as we outline in section  [ sec : uv - energy - sources ] , even with only 1/3 of the total column density accounting for the high - j line emission , the amount of warm molecular gas would still be 710@xmath64 greater than the pdr - associated atomic gas , so the uv heating is not a viable origin of the observed co emission .",
    "independent of the details of the excitation and radiative transfer model , the general shape of the co intensity vs. j curve measures the luminosity of the molecular gas in the central 15@xmath8  of ncg 253 .",
    "taking our favored model plotted in figure  [ fig : fit253 ] as a guide , the total flux in the co lines from the modeled region is @xmath101 .",
    "this is 25% of the [ c  ii ] 158  @xmath6 m and [ o  i ] 63  @xmath6 m intensities from the entire inner @xmath102 @xcite , and a substantial @xmath103 fraction of the total ir luminosity of the galaxy . at a distance of 2.5 mpc",
    ", this molecular gas flux corresponds to a luminosity of @xmath104 , giving a luminosity to mass ratio of @xmath105 for the gas containing co based on the mass estimates of section  [ sec : warm - gas - mass-1 ] .",
    "the large luminosity in the co lines is a simple consequence of the fact that such a large fraction of the gas mass is highly excited . in what follows ,",
    "we examine potential heating sources to generate the large luminosity .",
    "simple arguments show that traditional heating sources for warm molecular gas  far - uv photons and cloud - cloud collisions  are unlikely to contribute substantially .",
    "_ in contrast , the enhanced cosmic ray flux of the starburst nucleus can easily match the observed cooling in the co lines , and is likely responsible for the high excitation conditions inferred for the bulk of the molecular ism .",
    "_    for completeness we note that the co lines are a good measure of the total cooling of the molecular gas .",
    "the five h@xmath3  lines observed by @xcite suggest that all the rotational lines combine to produce a flux of at most @xmath106 , less than the co lines .",
    "another potential coolant is c@xmath107 , which can have an abundance comparable to that of co. however , it only has two transitions each of which could be comparable to a single co line if optically thick and thermalized ; thus c@xmath107 can not be a dominant coolant .",
    "also , we note that though the modeling described above carries uncertainties as great as 40% in the derived parameters , the discussion below typically concerns factors of 330 , and the general arguments hold independent of the modeling details .",
    "lc + co abundance ( x@xmath108 ) & @xmath63 + @xmath40co / @xmath38co abundance ratio & 50 +   + n@xmath109 & 3.57@xmath110 + gas density ( @xmath111 ) & 36@xmath112 + temperature ( @xmath113 ) & 100140 k + velocity gradient & @xmath114 + dense gas mass & 2.55@xmath93 +   + dense gas filling factor ( @xmath115 ) & @xmath116 + cloud radius & 2.0 pc + number of clouds & 330 +      in galactic starformation regions , warm co is typically produced by uv impinging on the surfaces of molecular clouds . as it penetrates a cloud , the uv is attenuated , producing in turn ionized , atomic , and warm molecular layers before it is extinguished @xcite .",
    "the thermal pressure implied by our model fit to the co lines is @xmath117 , similar to the pressure derived with atomic pdr line ratios of @xmath118 @xcite .",
    "this is consistent with a model in which the pdr gas forms the surface of the warm molecular clouds .",
    "the penetration of uv into a cloud is determined by the dust opacity , proportional to the gas column density according to @xmath119 here we have assumed solar dust abundance .",
    "( this is not unreasonable  though the metallicity in the nucleus of ngc  253 may be 3@xmath64 solar @xcite , there is evidence for substantial destruction of dust grains in an unusually large gas - phase si abundance @xcite ) . in standard galactic pdrs , the first @xmath1 3 magnitudes from the surface of the cloud are photodissociated and cool through the atomic lines , while the warm molecular gas exists from @xmath120  36 .",
    "to first order , the masses of these two components are comparable . yet in the nucleus of ngc  253 , @xcite measure @xmath121m@xmath122  of photodissociated gas traced by the 158@xmath123 [ cii ] line in a large ( 45@xmath8 ) beam . scaling by the observed molecular and far - ir continuum morphology @xcite , @xcite , we estimate only 56% of the photodissociated gas traced with the large beam falls within our 15@xmath8  beam .",
    "therefore , the photodissociated gas mass is about a factor of 2030 smaller than the 25@xmath124 m@xmath122  of warm molecular gas .",
    "there is no reasonable geometry in which two layers of comparable thickness can have volumes different an order of magnitude .",
    "it is possible that the distribution of heating between the molecular and atomic components could be made to favor the molecular gas with soft or weak uv fields relative to standard pdr templates .",
    "however , the conditions derived with the atomic lines are consistent with standard photodissociation region ( pdr ) models  the uv field can be understood as arising from o  7.5 stars with an effective temperature of 34,500  k @xcite , so scenarios invoking soft or weak uv fields are unlikely .    as pointed out in section  [ sec : suit - two - comp ] , as little as 30% of the total co could provide the line luminosities in a warm component , emitting more efficiently lower opacity in the lines .",
    "the remaining 70% of the molecular gas would then be in a cool , more diffuse component , possibly the uv - shielded cloud cores .",
    "this scenario is attractive because uv - shielded regions are required to host the hcn observed toward the nucleus @xcite , which has a low dissociation energy ( @xmath1 5  ev ) .",
    "however , a factor of 3 reduction in warm co - containing gas mass would still leave a factor of 710 more warm molecular gas than atomic gas .",
    "thus standard pdr models which invoke stellar far - uv photons to heat the surface of molecular clouds are not a good match for the heating of the bulk of the molecular gas in the nucleus of ngc  253 .",
    "another potential explanation for the large molecular luminosity is dynamical energy sources . by heating molecular gas over large velocity widths , shocks",
    "can dramatically increase the efficiency of co radiation .",
    "one source of shocks are outflows from young stars or star associations , examples in our galaxy include the w  51 , w  49 and dr  21 regions @xcite , in which bright co  emission is observed with @xmath12050  @xmath29  linewidths . in these sources ,",
    "the co luminosity in the broad - line shock - heated outflow components dominates that of the narrow - line pdr component .",
    "another clue is the bright sio observed in the central 150  pc of ngc  253 @xcite ; the large implied abundance of sio is attributed to outflows from massive young stars in a manner similar to the galactic regions w  51 and dr  21 .",
    "however , the comparison can not apply globally in the nucleus of ngc 253 .",
    "first , the excitation conditions in these galactic shock regions are much higher that what we observe for the average properties of the nucleus of ngc  253",
    ". observations of co ,  and  toward w  51 irs  2 , for example , indicate that the gas temperature are 5001000  k , unlikely for the bulk of the gas in ngc  253 given the rotational h@xmath3  observations suggesting lower temperatures .",
    "more importantly , in ngc  253 , the near - ir h@xmath3  emission is characteristic of uv fluorescence , rather than the thermal spectrum produced by shock heating @xcite found in the galactic outflow sources .",
    "shocks can also be generated with large - scale gas motions : supernova blast waves or spiral density waves .",
    "the nuclear starburst in ngc  253 is approximately bounded by an inner molecular ring with diameter 120  pc which corresponds to the inner inner linblad resonance ( iilr ) of the galaxy s bar .",
    "the large non - circular motions observed ( as much as 4050  @xmath29 ) are attributed to gas accumulation and orbit crowding ( see @xcite ) , in the deep potential of the stellar mass , and it is plausible imagine that shocks from cloud collisions would be common .",
    "however , the difficulty again is that if the majority of the co luminosity is to come from cloud collision shocks , they must be slow ( @xmath125  km  s@xmath16 ) , non - dissociative shocks in order to reproduce the observed co line ratios , and not excite the ro - vibrational h@xmath3  lines with a thermal spectrum . at these velocities ,",
    "the collision timescale and energy available for collisions between clumps becomes small .",
    "considering the molecular gas to come from assumed r@xmath126 , @xmath127 clumps , the mean separation of clumps @xmath128 is around 25 pc . with a relative velocity of 10  @xmath29 collisions",
    "will occur on timescales of @xmath129 with an available energy @xmath130 .",
    "such collisions , then , could in principle result in a luminosity to mass ratio of @xmath131 which is much smaller than the mass to luminosity relation implied by the model fit to the co intensities ( @xmath132 ) .",
    "lower densities and smaller clumps sizes mean more numerous clumps and a smaller mean separation .",
    "this can increase the luminosity by a factor of only 1020 , but it is still several orders of magnitude too small .",
    "thus it is unlikely that a substantial fraction of the co luminosity in the central @xmath1100  pc may be due to shocks from cloud - cloud collisions .",
    "again , while higher - velocity shocks could provide much more energy , and the @xmath140  @xmath29  non - circular velocities are suggestive that such shocks could exist , the h@xmath133 ro - vibrational lines are inconsistent with any significant heating in fast shocks . thus while some amount of shock heating is required to produce the high sio abundance , it is not likely to be a dominant factor in heating the bulk of the molecular gas .",
    "it is widely believed that low energy cosmic - ray protons dominate the heating of the quiescent , uv - shielded molecular cloud cores in the disk of the galaxy , keeping the gas temperature above that of the cmb ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) . a much larger cosmic ray density generated by massive star formation has also been invoked to explain the 50150  k measured molecular gas temperatures in the central regions of m82 ( sah ) .",
    "since the h@xmath3cosmic ray dissociation cross sections are so small ( @xmath134 ) , cosmic rays easily penetrate molecular cloud cores .",
    "the heating rate for cosmic rays can be characterized by a ionization rate @xmath135 per h@xmath3  molecule , and an average @xmath136 deposited as thermal energy per ionization , that is : @xmath137 @xcite adopt values for @xmath136 between 17 ev and 20 ev . for the ionization rate",
    "we solve eq .",
    "3 of sah which scales the cosmic ray density from that of the galactic disk according to the supernova rate per unit area @xmath138 and a typical wind velocity @xmath139 by which cosmic rays are removed from the disk of a galaxy : @xmath140 the galactic ionization rate @xmath141 is between @xmath142 @xcite and @xmath143 @xcite , ( see also @xcite ) . for the supernova rate in ngc  253 @xmath144 , we take the lower limit derived for the central 360@xmath6490 pc of 0.1 yr@xmath16 @xcite , giving @xmath145 . to compare with the galaxy ,",
    "we take a rate of 5.8 per century over the entire disk ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) , or @xmath146 .",
    "the diffusion velocity in the galactic disk is 10@xmath29  ( sah ) , and the superwind velocity in ngc  253 is @xmath1500 @xmath29 , @xcite .",
    "the ionization rate can then be scaled from that of the galaxy : @xmath147 with a @xmath136 of 20 ev per ionization , the power deposited per h@xmath3  molecule is then 518  @xmath148 .",
    "this estimate represents a lower limit to the cosmic ray heating , yet it is very close to the measured luminosity per h@xmath3  molecule in all of the co lines , @xmath149 with our assumed co abundance .    to check that the increased cr flux does not destroy h@xmath3  and other molecular constituents , we compare our derived ionization rate with eq .",
    "10 of sah .",
    "this requires that the ionization rate be less than the h@xmath3  formation rate : @xmath150 where @xmath151 is the total hydrogen density . for our parameters , this requires @xmath152 , a factor of 50 from our lower limit of @xmath153 .",
    "it is conceivable the increased cr density would dissociate the co in the cloud core .",
    "@xcite have constructed a chemical model of dark clouds to investigate the effects of cosmic rays ionization on the ion - neutral chemistry . for steady state models , with cloud density @xmath154 and visual extinction @xmath155",
    "they find co remains the dominant reservoir for carbon for the entire range of cosmic ray ionization rates investigated , @xmath156 .",
    "the neutral carbon abundance grows sharply as @xmath157 grows to @xmath158 approaching 25% of the co abundance at the largest cosmic ray fluxes investigated .",
    "these results are consistent with the large @xmath159 abundance ratios observed in the nuclei of both ngc 253 @xcite , and m82 @xcite . since cosmic ray heating provides the necessary molecular gas luminosity and naturally accounts for the large observed neutral carbon abundance , while other heating sources are insufficient by large factors , we favor favor the cosmic rays as the dominant heating source for the bulk of the molecular gas in the nucleus of ngc  253 .",
    "our analysis is fairly general , and we note that similar arguments could be made for other starburst nuclei where the rate of supernovae explosions approaches 0.1 per year in a @xmath1100 pc region .",
    "the total gas mass in a region compared with the derived density determines a volume filling factor of clouds . for our modeled dense component , the result is @xmath160 .",
    "the physical size of the clouds , however , is not constrained by our observations . the existence of hcn in dense cores @xcite indicates that many clouds must be large enough to shield their interiors from uv , approximately @xmath161 for the cloud radius .",
    "this puts a lower limit on the cloud size according to eq  ( [ eq : av ] ) .",
    "if we assume that the photodissociated gas , as traced through its [ cii ] and [ oi ] line emission forms a surface layer on the molecular cloud interiors , then we can estimate the cloud sizes .",
    "as discussed in section  [ sec : uv - energy - sources ] , such a layer would have a thickness such that @xmath162 , and the atomic to molecular gas mass ratio requires that the atomic surface constitute @xmath163 of the total cloud mass .",
    "for spherical clouds , this implies a cloud radius corresponding to @xmath164 . converting to physical sizes ,",
    "these arguments then give @xmath165 , at our modeled density and solar dust abundance . in a plane - parallel geometry ,",
    "appropriate for clouds illuminated from a single direction , the geometric argument would suggest a cloud thickness corresponding to @xmath166 , or 0.7  pc . adopting the 2  pc spherical clouds for argument , each has a mass of @xmath167 m@xmath122 , and there about 330 such clouds in the central 180  pc region . for reference , we note that increasing the co abundance does not change the arguments above regarding the individual cloud geometry , but would correspond to a smaller molecular gas mass , lower volume filling factor , and fewer number of clouds .",
    "table  [ tab : props ] summarizes the parameters for our adopted model .",
    "we have detected bright co  emission from the nucleus of ngc  253 .",
    "we combine our observations with lower - j measurements of both @xmath30 and @xmath31 and an lvg model to estimate the co column density and physical conditions of the molecular gas in the starburst nucleus .",
    "the column density of co we infer based on the transitions above  is slightly larger than but similar to the estimates made by hhr99 for the central 23@xmath8 .",
    "however , we find that the excitation conditions of this gas must be very high to reproduce the observed  and  intensities .",
    "a single component with @xmath168 , and @xmath169 provides the best fit to all the observed transitions above  for both @xmath40co and @xmath38co , and is consistent with the iso molecular h@xmath3  observations .",
    "we adopt this as the favored model .",
    "while a smaller additional mass of cool gas is required to account for the @xmath38co  intensity , and more cool gas may be present , the co column density of warm molecular gas can not be much less than our derived values .",
    "the large mass of warm gas is very difficult to explain with a photodissociation region scenario .",
    "the molecular gas mass is a factor of 1030 greater than the atomic gas mass , while the two should be comparable if heated with stellar uv as in the galactic pdr templates .",
    "dynamical heating of molecular gas from shocks is also unlikely based on energetic considerations , and given the lack of evidence for significant heating in fast shocks . on the other hand , the very large cosmic ray flux in the starburst nucleus of ngc  253 readily provides the necessary energy to heat the gas , and a means to deliver energy throughout the volume of large , uv - shielded clouds .",
    "it is likely the dominant heating term in the molecular ism energy budget .",
    "while some of the warm molecular gas that we observe is likely heated by the far - uv radiation and shocks , our results strongly support the conjecture by @xcite that the bulk of molecular gas in starburst nuclei is held at high excitation by the enhanced cosmic ray flux .",
