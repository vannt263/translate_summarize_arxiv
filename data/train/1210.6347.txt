    "understanding the link between supermassive black holes ( smbhs ) and their host galaxies is essential for deciphering the formation and evolution of galaxies .",
    "galaxy / smbh co - evolution is expected given the observed correlations between smbh mass and galaxy properties ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "a key prediction from this framework is that a galaxy experiencing rapid inflow of cold gas can evolve through various classes of starbursts and active galactic nuclei ( agn ) , such as ultra - luminous infrared galaxies ( ulirgs ) and quasars ( qsos ) , and that these phases are connected in an evolutionary sequence ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "with such a model , both a starburst and a heavily obscured agn can co - exist @xcite .    testing this picture",
    "requires not only finding signatures of obscured agn activity within starburst galaxies , but also interpreting them in the context of galaxy / smbh co - evolution .",
    "locally , the most extreme starbursts are the ulirgs ( @xmath4 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which are almost exclusively the result of a recent / ongoing major merger @xcite , which triggers both starburst and obscured agn activity . to evaluate smbh growth and the role of feedback during this critical phase",
    ", it is necessary to robustly estimate the agn power during all observed phases . a primary challenge to determine the fraction of flux attributable to the agn is the reprocessing of its photons by the host galaxy s interstellar medium ( ism ) . in essence",
    ", most diagnostics focus on finding signatures that are directly associated with the agn output : narrow - line region ( nlr ) emission , x - rays , torus emission , or radio emission .    a popular approach to study , in particular , dust - obscured agn utilizes the mid - infrared ( mid - ir ) regime , loosely defined as 3 - 30@xmath5 , where typical starbursts have a spectral energy distribution ( sed ) with a minimum in continuum emission , while continuum emission from dust surrounding agn rises toward longer wavelengths owing to hot dust emission , potentially from a torus ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "it is also when lirgs and ulirgs ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for a review ) make a significant contribution to the global averaged luminosity density and to the cosmic infrared background @xcite .",
    "other findings on high-@xmath7 ir - luminous galaxies suggest that high - redshift ulirgs may be unlike local ulirgs in that they may not all be late - stage mergers .",
    "for example , @xmath7@xmath82 sources tend to be more starburst - dominated than @xmath9 sources of comparable mid - ir  luminosity @xcite .",
    "differences in both the spectral energy distributions ( seds ) and morphologies of high redshift ulirgs , as compared with local ( @xmath10 ) sources , do suggest that they are not analogous ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter s12 ) .",
    "furthermore , submillimetre galaxies , a subset of high - redshift ulirgs , may be a mix of early - stage quiescently star - forming mergers , late - stage merger - induced starbursts , and isolated disk galaxies @xcite .",
    "the typically greater gas fractions @xcite imply that fueling both star - formation and black hole accretion is relatively easier , and therefore not necessarily analogous to what we see in local ulirgs .    in both the local and high - redshift work",
    ", it is not clear to what extent common diagnostics miss the crucial evolutionary stage when the agn is most deeply obscured .",
    "it is possible that we can only detect the presence of an agn once sufficiently many unobscured lines of sight to the agn exist .",
    "moreover , while ir diagnostics generally follow the expected agn / starburst fractions , the evolution of ir sed properties reflects a complex mix of these components which may be difficult to interpret for individual sources or samples ( * ? ? ? * hereafter v09 ) .",
    "therefore it is desirable to search for signposts of agn powering that may suffer minimally from these complexities .    to analyze this issue ,",
    "numerical calculations have been used to capture the complex geometries and radiation sources relevant for disentangling agn activity from star formation .",
    "originally restricted to simplified geometries ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , calculations of dust attenuation and reprocessing are now tenable for three - dimensional dynamical simulations on galactic scales including starbursts and smbh emission ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "studies of hydrodynamical simulations with dust radiative transfer in postprocessing have found that agn signatures , such as a power - law sed or warm ir colors in ulirgs , are generally associated with smbh activity @xcite but may also be caused by intense starbursts @xcite . analyzing the predicted far - ir emission from such simulations , @xcite and @xcite found that the ir signatures of star formation vary depending on whether the activity occurs in a quiescent or bursty mode , potentially complicating discriminators of agn and star formation activity .",
    "one challenge raised by this body of work is how to interface the modeled smbh with the host galaxy when it is not feasible to model the central engine fully self - consistently , a problem similar to the one described by , e.g. , @xcite for modeling young star clusters .    in this paper",
    "we combine the high diagnostic power of mid - ir features , such as pah emission and the @xmath3 silicate feature ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "we then use mid - ir  diagnostics to gain insight regarding agn activity when dust in the host galaxy may be important , and also to highlight areas in which such modeling techniques might be improved . in section  [",
    "s : simulations ] we describe simulations of two representative starbursts meant to bracket the level of obscuration in ulirgs , from which we compute and analyze the mid - ir  seds as described in section  [ s : diagnostics ] .",
    "in section  [ s : results ] , we show how these features depend on agn power , evolutionary stage , viewing direction , intrinsic agn sed , and assumptions about the dust and ism . in section  [ s : comparison ] we construct commonly used diagnostic diagrams and evaluate their ability to estimate the agn luminosity fraction .",
    "we consider implications of this work for future agn modeling and studies of the evolution of ir - luminous galaxies in section  [ s : implications ] , and we conclude in section  [ s : conclusions ] .",

    ", we used the same scale estimator @xmath15 defined in section [ ss : angle ] , which is generally insensitive to outliers . in both cases , @xmath16 and each @xmath17 predict @xmath18 with roughly the same median scatter , @xmath19 .",
    "however , we find that @xmath16 experiences a failure rate ( @xmath20 ) two to three times higher than @xmath17 in the highly obscured calculation .",
    "both quantities predict @xmath18 equally well under the alternate ism treatment and for the less obscured candidate ( not shown ) , with @xmath21 and failure rates @xmath22 .",
    "several simulated points at @xmath23 fail in both @xmath24  and @xmath13 . in these cases",
    ", corresponding to the most highly obscured lines of sight in our @xmath25 calculation from figure  [ fig : cameraseds ] , the mid - ir  is so heavily attenuated that no @xmath26  signature from the central source survives in the observed sed ( see also section  [ ss : angle ] ) .",
    "diagnostic @xmath17 requires information about the galaxy s stellar mass ( rest - frame @xmath27 ) , limiting its immediate application to large new samples .",
    "however , the rest - frame wavelength range @xmath17 requires will be covered by the _ james webb space telescope _  ( _ jwst _ ) , an observatory whose mid - infrared instrument ( miri ) ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) permits measurements of @xmath28 and @xmath29 for sources at @xmath30 .",
    "the tight correlation we find between @xmath17 and @xmath18 reflects the possible benefit in combining information about @xmath29 and @xmath28 with near - ir color diagnotics from _ jwst _  itself ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , or by matching to sources from other ir surveys ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "for the two example seds in figure  [ fig : datased ] , whose known agn fractions are both @xmath31 , this procedure estimates @xmath32 and @xmath33 ( uncertainties are from the minimum theoretical scatter in the correlations ) for the high and low obscuration examples , respectively .    .",
    "[ fig : datased],width=307 ]      [ ss : limitations ]    a concern with the present method is that we can not be sure how our few idealized simulations fit into a cosmological context .",
    "we have mitigated this issue by presenting two rather different ulirg candidates , by varying the relative power between the agn and star formation , and by varying the assumptions acting on dust obscuration and emission .",
    "we are planning to build a library of model seds for a much wider variety of systems , enabling more robust studies across ir - luminous galaxy populations .",
    "moreover , we have focused here on agn signatures at mid - infrared wavelengths , and information at longer wavelengths ( c.f .",
    "* ) , such as the location of the far - ir peak , could further constrain the agn fractions in such sources ( e.g. , s12 ) . in an upcoming paper ( e.  roebuck et al .  in prep . ) , we include the far - ir peak predictions from these simulations in interpreting the properties of @xmath34 starbursts and quasars ( the s12 sample ) .",
    "the simplest interpretation of figure  [ fig : data_comparison ] is that analogues of our `` highly obscured '' and `` less obscured '' examples are both realized in observed sources , in addition to both mw and smc dust : all four models are required to cover the wide observed distributions of mid - ir  color , pah emission , and silicate absorption",
    ". a higher ratio of silicate to carbonaceous dust grains increases @xmath29 while shrinking @xmath28 ( figures  [ fig : time_evolution_dust ] ) , without changing @xmath35 ( figure  [ fig : combo_diagram ] ) , permitting estimates of @xmath36  under a variety of physical conditions , dust models , and optical depths . although different ism or dust models can produce broadly similar mid - ir  trends , a separate measure of the agn power , such as x - ray flux , is essential to further constrain these models",
    "furthermore , the recent discovery of high - redshift , hyper - luminous , hot - dust ulirgs @xcite suggests that we may lack a key phase in these few simulations , in which feedback initiates a transition between scenarios represented by our `` highly obscured '' and `` less obscured '' sed models .",
    "several assumptions regarding the dust radiative transfer may lead to discrepancies between our model sources and real sources .",
    "in particular , from figure  [ fig : data_comparison ] we have identified two failures to which these assumptions likely contribute : 1 ) the mid - ir  colors of the most agn - dominated highly obscured sources are redder than their real counterparts ( although bluer at @xmath37 ; see figure  [ fig : combo_diagram ] ) , and 2 ) we do not simulate enough sources with little signs of pah emission or silicate absorption : @xmath38 _ and _ @xmath39 .    the ir calculation in sunrise  distributes the energy absorbed by small pah grains equally between emission in thermal equilibrium and in modes giving rise to the distinctive mid - ir  pah lines @xcite . therefore , any change to this assumption or more sophisticated calculation , such as thermally fluctuating small grains ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , will affect the dust continuum shape and pah strength .",
    "in addition , we do not currently model dust destruction , and our model for dust production is crude , both key areas where near - future progress may be tenable . by not allowing our radiation to destroy dust grains or alter the dust grain distribution ( or changing more generally the gas distribution owing to realistic feedback ) , we may be preventing ourselves from obtaining truly `` power - law '' agn seds with no mid - ir  dust features that may arise after agn feedback disrupts the ism .",
    "we have purposefully focused on how galaxy dust can affect the fixed smbh source sed ( with minor variations in section  [ ss : torus ] ) , rather than how the physics on smaller scales play out in observations of ulirgs .",
    "while high levels of galaxy dust can reproduce a number of properties of obscured quasars , the evolution of the central regions during these times of maximum obscuration will depend on the behavior of gas structures very close to the smbh .",
    "this behavior may set the minimum scatter to be observed in correlations between these indicators .",
    "using multiscale simulations , @xcite showed how gravitational instabilities propagate down to scales of @xmath40 pc during large - scale gas inflows .",
    "they demonstrated that a number of properties of obscured agn attributed to a torus are explained by such dynamically - evolving accretion structures .",
    "furthermore , these simulations suggest that the angular momentum vector of the small - scale `` torus '' can often be misaligned with the angular momentum of gas on galaxy scales , and the relative orientations can vary significantly in time @xcite .",
    "thus , the attenuation from the host galaxy may vary more significantly than our current simulations suggest .",
    "therefore we are motivated to develop methods of integrating knowledge of the impact of these different scales on the emergent seds as a means for further interpreting the evolution of ir - luminous galaxies .",
    "recent work on merger simulations at higher resolution @xcite and with different hydrodynamics solvers ( e.g. , arepo : @xcite , c.  hayward et al .  in prep . ) shows that the average global evolution in simulations like the ones we analyze here , and hence conclusions made based on them , are robust .",
    "however , such advances will enable more sophisticated treatments of feedback processes and hydrodynamics in gas with a complex phase structure and at smaller scales ; therefore future sed modeling could exploit these improvements to produce ever more detailed comparison libraries .",

    "this is attenuated by a foreground screen such that the flux at infinity is @xmath69 . for the starburst component , @xmath70 ,",
    "energy is absorbed by dust and re - emitted at ir wavelengths .",

    "suppose that the attenuation curve is such that the attenuation on either side of the deep silicate feature is @xmath72 , but in the feature , the attenuation is @xmath73 where @xmath74 .",
    "@xmath75 represents the ratio of the peak of the full extinction curve at @xmath76 to that arising without the silicate absorption ; here we analyze @xmath77 , which roughly matches the behavior we see in the simulations as expected with an extinction curve for mw - like dust @xcite .",
    "as in section  [ ss : simdiagnostics ] , @xmath78 .",
    "we define the intrinsic monochromatic agn fraction @xmath79 .",
    "this quantity is closely related to , but not directly proportional to , the bolometric agn fraction @xmath36  used throughout the rest of this paper and defined in section  [ ss : agnfractiondefinition ] .",
    "we estimate the conversion between these quantities in equation  [ eq : bolcorrect ] . by deriving toy diagnostics as a function of @xmath80",
    "we can controllably analyze their behavior in much the same way that we explored the simulations in sections  [ s : results ] , [ s : comparison ] , and [ s : implications ] using the agnx0 , agnx1 , and agnx10 models defined in sections  [ ss : alternatemodels ] and [ ss : galaxymodels ] . expanding @xmath26 , we find , @xmath81 where @xmath82 is a new parameter that characterizes the silicate absorption feature imprinted on the ir energy emitted from star formation . in the rt calculations ,",
    "we obtain @xmath83 since @xmath84 when @xmath85 ( figure  [ fig : time_evolution ] ) ; this corresponds to an effective optical depth to the star forming regions of @xmath86 .",
    "since the sf gas is spatially extended , @xmath87 will change less with viewing angle than @xmath88 , allowing us to keep this parameter @xmath82 fixed .",
    "the pah fraction @xmath28 is defined to be @xmath89 . add new variables @xmath90 and @xmath91 for the pah emission luminosity , and assume that the pah emission is some fixed factor @xmath92 times the continuum emission for either agn or star formation .",
    "we expand to find , @xmath93 the true behavior is somewhat more complex than this , since in figure  [ fig : time_evolution ] we see that @xmath28 varies quickly at high agn fractions and obscuration levels , but since both the numerator and denominator have a similar dependence on @xmath94 , there is minimal scatter with viewing angle at all times .",
    "now , if we ignore sf by setting @xmath95 , we get @xmath96 , or @xmath97 for all @xmath98 .",
    "the magnitude of this pre - factor ( @xmath99 ) implies that the depth of the silicate feature varies more strongly with optical depth , and thus viewing angle and time , than does the continuum .",
    "its negative sign gives rise to the intuitive behavior that the silicate absorption feature becomes more apparent ( @xmath29 shrinks ) with increasing optical depth .",
    "however , this trend fails in , e.g. , figure 6 , and the d points scattered low in figure  [ fig : d_v_lagn ] .    for simplicity , in the case of",
    "mixed sf and agn , let @xmath100 and @xmath101 , but let @xmath102 vary .",
    "when @xmath102 is very small , then the agn terms dominate , yielding @xmath103 , the same behavior as the no - sf case .",
    "when @xmath102 is large enough that the agn term in the numerator of equation  [ eq : tausi ] can be safely ignored , then we have @xmath104 .",
    "this simplifies depending on @xmath102 :      therefore , for powerful agn , @xmath29 depends strongly on @xmath102 , until @xmath102 gets too far above 1 , giving rise to the strong viewing - angle scatter we noticed in the simulations in section  [ ss : angle ] . in figure",
    "[ fig : appendixfig ] , we plot example curves showing how @xmath29 and @xmath28 depend on @xmath106 and @xmath102 in this toy model , which generally match the behavior we find in the simulations .    the qualitative behavior of diagnostic @xmath13 can be derived in the same fashion . for this , we seek a similar type of model for @xmath35 .",
    "roughly speaking ( figure  [ fig : diagram ] ) , the pure - agn sed is such that @xmath107 , and the stellar sed is @xmath108 .",
    "the added complication in this situation is the attenuation of the agn source depends on wavelength , roughly speaking as @xmath109 ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "we can use the same correction when combining @xmath29 and @xmath35 to model the @xmath13 diagnostic .",

    "a final difference between the simulated quantities and these toy models is that we derived these models as a function of a monochromatic agn fraction , while the quantity @xmath36  used in the rest of this paper is the bolometric agn fraction .",
    "the correction depends on the sed shape of the various components , which we parametrize as @xmath112 , @xmath113 .",
    "the agn bolometric correction factor @xmath114 is fixed since our input template has a fixed sed shape over the wavelengths used by sunrise , while the sf correction @xmath115 varies ; we find that @xmath116 in our rt calculations , and so we derive : @xmath117 figure  [ fig : appendixfig ] shows @xmath26 , @xmath111 , and @xmath13 from these idealized formulae for a sampling of agn fractions and optical depths , confirming much of the behavior we observed in the results of the rt calculations .",
    ", @xmath35 , and @xmath13 as a function of near - ir optical depth and agn fraction .",
    "these simple models consist of an agn source buried behind a simple obscuring screen ( `` galaxy dust '' ) , plus an extended region of star formation that has a fixed spectral shape that does not depend on the optical depth to the agn . in the upper left panel",
    ", @xmath118 has a strong dependence on @xmath102 , even at low levels of obscuration , giving rise to the large viewing angle scatter of @xmath29 in the simulations of section  [ ss : angle ] : since the agn is a point source , its final sed depends only on attenuation along a single line of sight , which can vary widely , while indicators of activity over a larger spatial region ( such as @xmath28 ) have their attenuation averaged over many lines of sight .",
    "several other phenomena from the simulations are demonstrated by these models : 1 ) generally , the silicate feature is enhanced as the agn fraction increases and as @xmath102 increases , up until the sf gas begins to dominate the attenuated agn sed , at which point the dependence of @xmath29 on @xmath102 reverses ; 2 ) the near - ir color @xmath35 effectively selects powerful agn when @xmath102 is small enough ( in our units , @xmath119 ) ; and 3 ) at larger @xmath102 , @xmath120 decreases and @xmath121 increases in such a way that the combination of these diagnostics , @xmath13 , remains roughly constant for a fixed agn fraction .",
    "this constancy is shown in the bottom left panel , and gives rise to the tight correlation between agn fraction and @xmath13 in the bottom right panel .",
    "these simple arguments roughly verify the rt calculations and motivate the behavior of the empirically defined indicator @xmath13 ( section  [ ss : idealindicators ] ) .",
