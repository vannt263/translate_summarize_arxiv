    "helium is the second most abundant element in the universe , having been produced by big bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) with a universal mass fraction of @xmath6 0.24 ( steigman 2007 ) ; after that , successive stellar generations synthesize metals ( @xmath7 ) and an additional amount of helium @xmath8 .",
    "the characteristic helium  to  metal enrichment rate @xmath2 is estimated to be around 2 , both observationally from hii regions ( e.g.  fukugita & kawasaki 2006 ; peimbert 2007 ; izotov , thuan & stasinska 2007 ) and theoretically , from models of stellar nucleosynthesis and chemical evolution of the galactic disc ( e.g.  chiosi & matteucci 1982 ; maeder 1992 ; carigi & peimbert 2008 ; casagrande 2008 )    in spite of its large abundance , helium is an elusive element .",
    "it can be measured directly , from spectroscopic lines , only in stars hotter than @xmath9  k : young , massive stars ( or their surrounding hii regions ) or blue horizontal branch stars ( where though , apart from a small temperature range , the surface abundance may not trace the original one , due to helium sedimentation and metal levitation : michaud , vauclair & vauclair 1983 ; michaud , richer & richard 2008 ; villanova , piotto & gratton 2009 and references therein ) .",
    "only indirect methods can be used for stars of lower mass and cooler temperatures , which constitute the bulk of the galaxy s stellar population .",
    "one such method relies on the broadening of the lower main sequence ( ms ) : in fact the location of low  mass , long  lived stars in the hr diagram depends on their metallicity @xmath7 and their helium content @xmath10  or equivalently , on @xmath2 .",
    "concomitant increases in @xmath7 and @xmath10 shift the ms in opposite directions , so for a given variation @xmath11 the two mss are more spread apart ( the metal rich being cooler at a given luminosity ) if the corresponding @xmath8 is lower ; conversely , if @xmath8 is large `` enough '' , the mss may even invert , with the more metal ( and helium ) rich being bluer ( i.e.  hotter ; e.g.  fernandes 1996 ) .",
    "this method dates back to faulkner ( 1967 ) ; early studies based on ground  based parallaxes deduced a large and quite uncertain value of @xmath12 from the apparent overlap of mss of all metallicities ( e.g.  perrin 1977 ; fernandes 1996 ) .",
    "the situation greatly improved with hipparcos parallaxes , so that a net separation of the ms as a function of @xmath7 could be detected in the hr diagram .",
    "studies based on hipparcos distances concluded @xmath13 ( pagel & portinari 1998 ; jimenez 2003 ) .",
    "more recently , casagrande ( 2006 , 2007 ) further improved the analysis by compiling a much larger sample of k dwarfs with homogeneous multi  band photometry , for which bolometric magnitudes and effective temperatures were derived with the infrared flux method ( irfm ) .",
    "the interpretation of the broadening of the lower ms could thus be performed in the theoretical hr diagram ( @xmath14 vs.  @xmath15 ) where comparison to stellar models is more straightforward and the effects of @xmath2 more prominent ( castellani , deglinnocenti & marconi 1999 ) . around solar metallicities",
    "this analysis yielded @xmath16 ; but at lower @xmath7 casagrande ( 2007 ) found that the observed main sequence is narrower than expected from stellar models computed under the standard assumption @xmath0 , thus implying a very steep @xmath17 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : yzfield ] ) .",
    "this change in slope is at odds with galactic chemical evolution models , that predict a ratio substantially constant with @xmath7 ( carigi & peimbert 2008 ; casagrande 2008 ) ; a constant @xmath0 is also found for both metal - rich ( e.g.  peimbert 2003 ; balser 2006 ) and metal - poor ( e.g.  fukugita & kawasaki 2006 ; peimbert 2007 ; izotoz 2007 ) hii regions .",
    "more importantly , @xmath17 at low metallicities implies a helium content for nearby subdwarfs much lower than @xmath18 , in awkward constrast with the cosmological floor set by standard bbn .",
    "a combination of small sample size and @xmath7dependent bolometric corrections in the observational hr diagram had masked this effect in previous studies of @xmath2 , although very low @xmath10 values had already been noticed in a handful of low metallicity stars with available irfm @xmath19 and @xmath20 ( fernandes 1998 ; lebreton 1999 ) .",
    "this result points toward inadequacies in main sequence stellar models of low metallicity , and we now plan to investigate the issue further , as this may lead to reconsideration of the problem of the helium enrichment in globular clusters .    in fact , at absolute magnitudes comparable to those of the local stars studied in casagrande ( 2007 , @xmath21 ) , multiple main sequences have been discovered in some globular clusters and interpreted as evidence for huge helium enhancement in a sub - population ( bedin 2004 ; norris 2004 ; piotto 2005 , 2007 ) ; see fig .",
    "[ fig : wcen ] .",
    "the required @xmath22 is extremely difficult to explain with stellar nucleosynthesis and chemical evolution models ( karakas 2006 ; prantzos & charbonnel 2006 ; maeder & meynet 2006 ; choi & yi 2007 , 2008 ; romano 2007 , 2009 ; renzini 2008 ; yi 2009 ; marcolini 2009 ; peng & nagai 2009 ) .",
    "the helium content of the sub - population also has a major role in shaping other regions of the hr diagram ( catelan , valcarce & sweigart 2009a and references therein ) ; in particular it is reflected in the morphology of the horizontal branch ( dantona & caloi 2004 ; caloi & dantona 2005 , 2007 ; lee 2005 ) .",
    "while it is likely that a significant helium enhancement is present in those stellar populations , the purpose of this work is to show that the revision of low metallicity ms stellar models , needed to cure the problem of the high @xmath2 and sub - primordial @xmath10 deduced in nearby k dwarfs , may significantly reduce current estimates of @xmath2 in globular clusters with multiple mss , easing their theoretical interpretation .",
    "we show this by means of an exercise based on homology relations .",
    "theoretical homology relations , describing how the location of the low ms in the hr diagram depends on metallicity and helium content , are briefly recalled in section  [ sec : homology ] . in section  3 , we apply homology relations to interpret the split of multiple mss in globular clusters , and show that the inferred helium enrichment for the blue population(s ) agrees with the results of detailed isochrone analysis . in section  4",
    "we confirm that , in general , homology relations render very well the behaviour of stellar models as a function of the helium content .",
    "however , both isochrones and homology relations fail the interpretation of the low ms of nearby stars  as we can not accept sub  primordial helium contents for low metallicity stars . therefore ,",
    "in section  5 we proceed to calibrate _ empirical _ homology relations , that return the expected @xmath23 for the low ms of nearby stars with @xmath24 .",
    "such empirically calibrated homology relations also return , for the helium  rich subpopulations of globular clusters , a helium content @xmath25 , rather than the much higher @xmath26 of standard analysis . this lower value of helium enrichment can be reconciled far more easily with present chemical evolution models ( karakas 2006 ; renzini 2008 ; yi 2009 ) .",

    "this was also noticed by pagel & portinari ( 1998 ) ; the corresponding parameter in their formalism was @xmath134 , with @xmath135 from the theoretical homology relations and @xmath136 from isochrone fitting .",
    "the discrepancy was mostly imputed to a difference between the observational and the theoretical hr diagram ( castellani 1999 ) while here we confirm it also in the purely theoretical plane .",
    "the parameter @xmath133 describes the metallicity dependence of the opacity coefficient @xmath137 ( see the appendix ) so it is no surprise that it may differ between detailed stellar structure models and simplified descriptions of @xmath137 .",
    "opacity throughout the star ( at least for largely radiative structures like low mass ms stars , where the convective envelope is extended in radius but not so prominent in mass , and most importantly , energy production occurs in radiative regions ) is the main factor determining its luminosity and henceforth its whole structure ; so a significant difference in the parameter @xmath133 implies a significant difference in structure ( or , better to say , in its metallicity dependence ) between actual stellar models and homologous stars .",
    "however , @xmath133 is unrelated to @xmath10 or @xmath2 and , since the other parameters ( @xmath138 and @xmath139 ) are similar to the expected values , in essence homology relations render very well the dependence of theoretical isochrones on variations of the helium content  as our experiment on @xmath3cen and ngc  2808 had already suggested .",
    "in the previous sections we have shown that theoretical homology relations agree very well with the isochrone  based interpretation of the ms splits observed in @xmath3cen and ngc  2808 , and adequately reproduce the behaviour of isochrones in general , as a function of @xmath2 .",
    "however , isochrones are known to fail the interpretation of the hr diagram of nearby metal  poor low ms stars ( e.g.  lebreton 1999 ; torres 2002 ; casagrande 2007 ; boyajian 2008 ) . therefore ,",
    "in this section we define `` empirical '' homology relations , calibrated to reproduce the broadening of the local ms , and extrapolate the consequences for the interpretation of globular clusters .",
    "casagrande ( 2007 ) have shown that , while for @xmath140 the broadening of the main sequence is well reproduced with the standard @xmath0 , with current isochrones a much higher @xmath17 is needed to fit lower metallicities ( fig .",
    "[ fig : yzfield ] ) . while in principle",
    "@xmath2 may not necessarily be constant , fig .",
    "[ fig : yzfield ] , taken at face value , also implies a helium content in local metal poor stars as low as @xmath141 .",
    "such a striking contrast with bbn is to be ascribed to inadequacies of low metallicity stellar models .",
    "while awaiting for a solution to this problem by improved stellar physics ( see our final discussion ) , here we adopt a very pragmatic approach : we _ assume _ that @xmath0 also for any @xmath142 , and empirically calibrate homology relations so that this result is returned for nearby stars .",
    "our assumption is very reasonable , since hii region measurements and chemical evolution models support a constant @xmath0 down to very low @xmath7 ( e.g.  peimbert 2007 ; carigi & peimbert 2008 ) , as does the following simple argument : taking the solar bulk abundances ( asplund 2009 ) and the primordial @xmath143 ( steigman 2007 ) , one derives @xmath144 for @xmath24 .    to define our empirical homology relations ,",
    "let s first inspect the form of the relations ( eq .  [ eq : dlogteff_param ] ) .",
    "the first term includes the effects of the helium content , while the second term ( stemming essentially from the metallicity dependence of opacity ) is independent of @xmath2 .",

    "z ms is the response of stellar structure to @xmath2 , and consequently recalibrate the first term in the homology relations , the estimated @xmath8 for the subpopulations of gc s is drastically reduced .",

    "[ fig : yzpoor ] there is now considerable scatter and many stars remain with uncomfortably low helium abundances .",

    "but when operating on @xmath172 to obtain the @xmath146 . ]",
    "notice that the cause of the discrepancy is entirely ascribed to some sort of metallicity dependence now .",
    "for instance , the variation of the mixing - length with @xmath7 suggested in casagrande ( 2007 ) to avoid low helium abundances , in the framework of the homology relations can be formally described by the second term .",
    "the same can be said for any change in stellar models that would only respond to metallicity differences and not to differences in the helium content : it would have no impact on the interpretation of the multiple main sequences of globular clusters .",
    "in this paper we draw attention on the possible connection between the hr diagram of globular clusters with multiple main sequences ( @xmath3cen and ngc  2808 ) and the broadening of the low ms defined by nearby stars . although not `` inverted '' as in @xmath3cen , where the metal - rich main sequence is bluer than the metal - poor one ,",
    "the broadening defined by nearby subdwarfs is much narrower than expected for a standard helium content and helium  to  metal enrichment law @xmath0 . at low metallicities , @xmath17 is formally necessary to reproduce the observed broadening , but this is unacceptable as it implies helium fractions much lower than the cosmological bbn floor .",
    "it is worth remarking here that the results by casagrande ( 2007 ) on the broadening of the low ms were corroborated by the analysis of a number of binary stars , whose masses were well reproduced by theoretical isochrones  again at the expense of assuming , for some low z binaries , sub - primordial helium abundances . also , one may argue that the problem lies in an incorrect @xmath20 scale for low z stars . without entering here a detailed discussion on the robustness of the irfm scale by casagrande ( 2006 , 2010 ) ,",
    "suffice here to mention that this is one of the hottest scales available ( as discussed in the original papers and in sousa et al .",
    "it is hotter by 100  k than other irfm renditions ( the now superseded scales by alonso , arribas & martinez  roger 1996 and ramrez & melndez 2005 ) , and it is comparable within @xmath17350  k to various spectroscopic scales in the metallicity range relevant for this work .    therefore , any other @xmath20 scale will just worsen the k dwarf problem , with real stars even cooler than the models . also , it does not seem plausible that all the ( independent ) scales available are systematically offset by @xmath174  k , which is what is needed to bring the k dwarfs of casagrande et al .",
    "( 2007 ) in line with stellar models .",
    "we estimate the possible extent of the required revision of low ms stellar models on the base of homology relations .",
    "first we show that theoretical homology relations properly reproduce the response of stellar models to the helium content : in particular , analyzing the split of the multiple ms in @xmath3cen and ngc  2808 by homology relations yields the same conclusions as full isochrone analysis ( i.e.a helium content @xmath175 0.4 for the blue subpopulations ) .",
    "then , since both isochrones and theoretical homology relations fail the interpretation of the nearby low  z main sequence , we calibrate _ empirical _ homology relations to yield consistently @xmath0 for nearby stars , and inspect the consequences for the ms splits in globular clusters .",
    "_ if _ we entirely impute the failure of the low - ms stellar models to a wrong response to the helium abundance ( and correspondingly re - calibrate the helium  sensitive term of the homology relations ) , the consequences for globular clusters are highly significant : the helium content of the blue sub - populations is reduced from 40% to 30% , which is far easier to explain with chemical evolution models ( renzini 2008 ; yi 2009 ) .    alternatively , if stellar models for the low ms are assumed to fail in their metallicity dependence ( i.e.  we re - calibrate only the homology term expressing the metallicity dependence of opacity ) the consequences for globular clusters are negligible  as the metallicity differences between the subpopulations are minimal or vanishing .",
    "as the solution for k dwarf models can be intermediate between these two extreme assumptions , we suggest that the helium rich populations in globular clusters are likely to have a helium content @xmath10 in between 0.30.4 ; but altogether , there is room to decrease their estimated helium content from the extreme @xmath176 that is the commonly quoted value .    in summary , the purpose of this exercise is to draw the attention of model ",
    "makers to the problem of the hr diagram of nearby low  z stars : improvements in this respect are potentially important also for the riddle of the helium self - enrichment in globular clusters .",
    "we remind indeed that , while a helium content as high as @xmath26 seems to nicely account for the multiple main sequences and the morphology of the horizontal branch ( hb ) , other observations provide some counter - evidence for such a helium rich sub - population . in @xmath3cen ,",
    "the location of the rgb bumps of the metal  poor and metal  intermediate populations is consistent with a maximum @xmath177 , less than what is derived from ms and hb analysis ( sollima 2005 ) .",
    "sollima ( 2006 ) have also identified rr lyr  stars with metallicity corresponding to that of the blue ms , but normal helium content  which would require the metal  intermediate population to be further split into a helium rich and a helium normal subcomponents .",
    "ngc 6752 is another cluster suspected to host a helium enriched population , due to the morphology of its hb and the presence of a broadened , possible multiple ms ( milone et al .",
    "2010 ) ; however , villanova ( 2009 ) did not detect large helium abundances in the spectra of blue hb stars in the ( narrow but crucial ) temperature range @xmath178 , hot enough to produce helium lines but still unaffected by helium sedimentation .",
    "other studies of clusters suspected to host helium rich sub - populations have not confirmed their presence ( e.g.  lee 2009 for ngc 1851 ; catelan 2009b for m3 ) .",
    "while awaiting for independent proof of high helium abundances from direct spectral measurements or other features in the hr diagram ( see the recent review by catelan 2009a ) , we remark that the helium abundances obtained by our proposed revision , @xmath179 , are consistent with all of the above  mentioned constraints .",
    "the need for sub - primordial helium abundances to fit a handful of nearby subdwarfs on the hr diagram was first noticed by fernandes ( 1998 ) and lebreton ( 1999 ) who advocated the inclusion of additional physical processes not implemented in standard stellar evolutionary calculations . in the following ,",
    "we discuss a number of possible solutions to the problem .",
    "broadly speaking , we can classify them as metallicity  dependent solutions , which shall not concern the helium rich populations of globular clusters , and helium  dependent solutions , which we expect also to impact the interpretation of globular clusters .",
    "we may add that , considering the nice agreement between the multiple ms and the hb morpology in @xmath3 cen and ngc  2808 , the optimal helium  dependent solution should preferably preserve this relation ; this can be achieved if the new stellar models will not just shift the low metallicity zams to lower effective temperatures , but also affect the luminosity of individual stars and accelerate their evolution , which helps to populate the blue side of the hb .",
    "casagrande ( 2007 ) discussed a number of possible solutions ( all in the metallicity  dependent class ) .",
    "we briefly recall them and discuss a few more here below .    [",
    "[ mixing - length ] ] mixing length + + + + + + + + + + + + +    a mixing length parameter decreasing with metallicity would make low z models redder ; for the isochrones we used , the variation should be from the reference solar value @xmath180=1.68 to @xmath180=1.0 at low z. while any dependence of @xmath180 on metallicity , mass or other physical parameters is still highly disputed ( casagrande 2007 and references therein ) this solution would have no consequence for the helium content of globular clusters , as it is metallicity dependent and does not significantly affect the luminosity and lifetime of the stellar models .    [",
    "[ diffusion - nonlte - effects ] ] diffusion + non  lte effects + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    element diffusion affects the location of low ms stars in the hr diagram : it makes stellar models redder , and moreover it lowers the measured surface metallicity with respect to the real intrinsic one . in this scenario ,",
    "low z subdwarfs look redder than we expect , mostly because they are actually more metal rich than we measure .",
    "casagrande ( 2007 ) discussed this possibility resorting to literature models with fully efficient ( `` maximal '' ) diffusion , and found that it does not completely solve the problem , unless it is combined with additional errors on the observed metallicity due to non  lte effects .",
    "( this solution also would have no effect on globular clusters , since it is metallicity and age dependent , and the gap in both is small for the multiple populations of globular clusters . )    however , as discussed in that paper , there is evidence that both of these mechanisms are not fully efficient in real stars , as one would need to solve the k dwarf problem .",
    "for diffusion in particular , observations of field and cluster metal - poor dwarfs point toward inhibited efficiency and additional  yet ad hoc  processes are nowadays invoked to contrast diffusion ( e.g.  chaboyer 2001 ; richard , michaud & richer 2002 , 2005 ; korn 2007 ) .",
    "[ [ boundary - conditions ] ] boundary conditions + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    also play a role in stellar evolutionary tracks .",
    "a solar scaled @xmath181 relation provides a good description of the atmospheric structure also in metal - poor stars , and may contribute to improve low z models with respect to gray atmosphere boundary conditions .",
    "however , the effect appears to be quite small for ms stars , when each set of isochrones consistently adopts a mixing length parameter calibrated on the solar model ( vandenberg 2008 ) .    besides",
    ", boundary conditions are expected to become more relevant at lower stellar masses and luminosities ( due to the deeper surface convection ) , while in casagrande ( 2007 ) we verified that there is no systematic trend of the derived @xmath2 with @xmath182 .",
    "also this solution relies on a metallicity  dependent effect and would not bring substantial revisions to the helium content in the multiple ms of gcs .",
    "[ [ convection ] ] convection + + + + + + + + + +    one can always consider changing the boundary of convective regions as a viable working hypothesis .",
    "( in fact , the very presence of a convective envelope renders real k dwarfs not rigorously representable by homology relations . )",
    "considering that the convective envelope gets thinner at lower metallicities , any change in the convection scheme ( e.g. extra - mixing , or undershooting ) is expected to affect solar metallicity objects more , creating a differential effect in metallicity that could change the relative location of the low ms as a function of z. also this solution falls in the metallicity - dependent category and is not expected to impact on the gc analysis .    [ [ opacity ] ] opacity + + + + + + +    as k dwarfs are largely radiative structures , in particular in the regions where nuclear energy is produced , opacity is a leading ingredient in determining their luminosity .",
    "an incorrect metallicity dependence of opacity would seriously affect the broadening of the low ms .",
    "the idea is tempting , as the `` break '' in the estimated @xmath2 occurs close to @xmath135 , which is the classic divide between free - free and bound - free dominated opacity in stellar interiors ( cox & giuli 2004 ) .",
    "the parameter @xmath133 in the original homology relations is related to this characteristic metallicity as @xmath134 ( section  [ sec : homology_num ] and appendix ) and we have seen that modern isochrones are better described by @xmath183 rather than 100 , effectively reducing @xmath184 to 0.0015 ( section  [ sec : homology_num ] ; pagel & portinari 1998 ) .",
    "however , optimizing empirical homology relations on the opacity term , restores a value for @xmath133 or @xmath185 closer to the theoretical one ( @xmath172 or @xmath186 ) .",
    "this suggests that the culprit might be the metallicity dependence of opacity ( which would then be irrelevant for globular clusters ) .",
    "it is easier to figure errors in the bound - free contribution to opacity , rather than in the free - free component , at least for the bulk of the star wher h and he are completely ionized .",
    "lowering the bound - free contribution to opacity would imply a recalibration of solar metallicity isochrones , after which high z ( bound - free dominated ) and low z ( free - free dominated ) model ms may fall closer to each other , thus reducing the broadening . however , we wonder if there is much room for profound changes in opacity , given the excellent agreement between the major current , independent databases ( opacity project , seaton 2005 and references therein ; and opal , iglesias & rogers 1996 and references therein ) and keeping in mind that improvement in atomic data , input physics etc .",
    "most often leads to an increase in the opacity , as more and more opacity sources are taken into account .",
    "helioseismology has shown extant opal and op opacities to be fully adequate for solar models with the `` classic '' solar composition ; while an increase in opacity by 1020% in a suitable temperature range has been invoked for the solar model with new , lower metallicity  possibly in connection with increased neon abundance ( basu & antia 2008 ; asplund et  al .",
    "2009 ; serenelli et  al .",
    "2009 ; and references therein ) . how these or other fundamental changes of the solar model , to recover agreement with helioseismological constraints , will impact low z subdwarfs and the _ relative _ location of ms of subsolar metallicity on the hr diagram , remains to be explored .",
    "finally , we notice that the `` helium problem '' may not be limited to k dwarfs : systematic temperature offsets from the theoretical main sequence at low z have been highlighted for fg dwarfs in the geneva  copenhagen survey ( nrdstrom et  al .",
    "2004 ) ; and a helium content y=0.230.24 ( i.e.  slightly sub - cosmological ) has been recently suggested for a slighly metal - poor f dwarf binary ( [ fe / h]=0.25 ; clausen et  al .",
    "if the problem indeed extends to fg dwarfs , clearly some of the suggested solutions ( for instance , those related to diffusion ) are not viable .",
    "all of the solutions suggested above rely , more or less indirectly , on metallicity dependence ; this is the standard way we think of stellar models .",
    "however , our exercise in this paper highlights that it is worth thinking of other possible systematics in the stellar models , especially connected to the helium abundance , for their interesting impact on the multiple ms of globular clusters .",
    "as mentioned above , opacity has a key role in the structure of lower ms stars , so we may wonder whether the issue can be the helium dependence of opacity .",
    "this can be hardly modified in regions of complete ionization ; more promising are regions where he is partially recombined and contributes to the boud - free opacity .",
    "other helium  dependent effects may be considered , such as diffusion mechanisms that would act differently for helium as for metals .",

    "possibly , other of the above mentioned solutions ( mixing length , convection etc . ) can be recast and explored in terms of helium dependence , rather than metallicity dependence .",

    "an excellent introduction of the homology relations used in this paper is given by fernandes ( 1996 ) , which we follow .",
    "a family of permanently homologous stars ( i.e. , stars with the same relative mass distribution , that are in hydrodynamical and thermal equilibrium ) can be obtained in the hypothesis that the equation of state is the perfect gas law , and that opacity and energy generation rate follow laws of the kind : @xmath187 @xmath188 ( cox & giuli 1968 ) .",
    "other underlying assumptions are that the energy transport occurs via radiative diffusion over most of the interior ( in particular , over the energy generation region , as is the case for the low ms ) and that the radial profile of chemical composition differs , in different stars , just by a scale factor .",
    "the latter assumption holds in particular for stars on the zams , with internally uniform chemical composition .    for low ",
    "mass ms stars , opacity is dominated by bound ",
    "free and free - free processes and well approximated by kramer s law : @xmath189 ; while the energy generation rate via pp chain approximately follows @xmath190 . with these dependencies on @xmath191 and @xmath192 , homology transformations yield the following relation for the luminosity and effective temperature of the star @xmath193 @xmath194 as a function of mass @xmath34 and molecular weight @xmath195 . eliminating mass ,",
    "one derives : @xmath196 the last factor indicates the slope of the zams for a given chemical composition : about 10 mag per dex in log(@xmath20 )  flatter than , but not so far from , the slope obtained with detailed stellar structure computations ( 17 mag per dex , section  [ sec : homology ] ) .",
    "here we are mostly interested in the broadening of the zams in luminosity as a function of chemical composition , at a fixed @xmath20 ; such broadening is expressed by the first three factors . since h ",
    "burning occurs via the p - p chain : @xmath197 the molecular weight @xmath195 , throughout most of the star where complete ionization applies , is given by : @xmath198 for bound  free and free  free opacity , approximately : @xmath199 , @xmath200 ( cox & giuli 2004 ) , so that @xmath201 notice that @xmath202 is where opacity drifts from free - free dominated ( @xmath203 ) to bound - free dominated ( @xmath204 ) .",
    "altogether , we can write the homology relation  ( [ eq : lteff ] ) as : @xmath205 with @xmath206 the first factor in the @xmath207 function is related to the energy generation rate , the second factor to the molecular weight , and the last two factors to opacity .",
    "it is then straightforward to derive eq .",

    "however this linearized approximation holds only for @xmath213 and does not recover very well the original homology relations for @xmath214 ( see fig .",

    "as applies to the case of @xmath3cen , it is worth using the original formulation of the homology relations ( eq .  [ eq : dlogteff ] ) , which indeed we showed in section  [ sec : homology_gc ] to yield excellent results when applied to the multiple ms of @xmath3cen amd ngc 2808 .",

    "b1 we show that the effect of the revised parallaxes is minimal : the sample only slightly changes ( 3 stars are now rejected by the parallax limit 6% , while 5 new stars are included , for a total of 88 objects ) and the trend toward significantly sub - cosmological y values is confirmed . nor it appears to be due to low metallicity stars being systematically more distant than the solar metallicity ones ( with systematically intrinsic bluer colours due to neglected reddening ) : though a slight distance  metallicity trend is present as expected , most of the stars lie within 30 pc for all metallicities ( fig .",
    "b2 ) . also , in fig .",
    "[ fig : wcen ] we show that the reddening / extinction correction needed to reconcile metal - poor stars with isochrones would correspond to @xmath228=0.10 , which is certainly too extreme for so nearby stars .",

    "carlo simulations performed in 2007 to estimate realistic errorbars ( shown in fig .",
