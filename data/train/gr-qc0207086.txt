    "there is a remarkable recent interest in the physical foundations of computability theory and the church ",
    "turing thesis .",
    "it turned out that algorithm and complexity theory , previously considered as very pure mathematical subjects , have a deep link with basic concepts of physics . at one hand",
    "now we can see that our deep and apparently pure mathematical notion of a turing machine involves indirect preconceptions on space , time , motion and measurement .",
    "hence it is straightforward to ask whether different choices of physical theories for modeling these things have some effect on our notions of computability or not . at the recent stage of affairs",
    "it seems there are striking changes on the whole structure of complexity and even computability theory if we move from classical physics to quantum or relativistic theories .",
    "even variants of the church  turing thesis cease to be valid in certain cases .",
    "for instance , by taking quantum mechanics as our background theory , calude and pavlov have claimed in their recent paper that the famous chaitin s omega number , a typical non - computable real number , is enumerable via an advanced quantum computer @xcite while kieu has recently proposed an adiabatic quantum algorithm to attack hilbert s tenth problem @xcite .    in the same fashion",
    "if we use general relativity theory , powerful gravitational computers can be built up which are also capable to break turing s barrier .",
    "malament and hogarth proposed a class of space - times , now called as malament  hogarth space - times , admitting gravitational computers for non - turing computations @xcite @xcite .",
    "hogarth construction uses anti - de sitter space - time which is in the focus of recent investigations in high energy physics . in the same spirit",
    "the author and nmeti have constructed another example by exploiting properties of the kerr ",
    "newman space - time @xcite .",
    "this space - time is also relevant as the only possible final state of a collapsed , massive , slowly rotating star of small electric charge .",
    "a general introduction to the field is chapter 4 of earman s book @xcite .    on the other hand",
    "it is conjectured that these generalized computational methods are not significant from a computational viewpoint only but , in the case of quantum computers at least , they are also in connection with our most fundamental physical concepts such as the standard model and string theory @xcite @xcite",
    ".    the natural question arises if the same is true for gravitational computers i.e. , is there any pure physical characterization of the above mentioned malament  hogarth space - times ? in this short paper we try to argue that these space - times also appear naturally in the strong cosmic censorship scenario .",
    "namely we claim that space - times possessing powerful gravitational computers form the unstable borderline separating the allowed and not - allowed space - times by the strong cosmic censor conjecture ( but these space - times are still considered as `` physically relevant '' i.e. , are not ruled out by the strong cosmic censor ) .",
    "if our considerations are correct then we can establish a hidden link betwix non - turing computability and the most exciting open problem of classical general relativity .",
    "in this section we introduce the concept of a malament  hogarth space - time . as a motivation we mention that in these space - times , at least in theory , one can construct powerful gravitational computers capable for computations beyond the turing barrier . a typical example for such a computation is checking of consistency of zfc set theory",
    ".    then we prove a basic property of malament  hogarth space - times namely they lack global hyperbolicity and distinguish the two main subclasses of them .",
    "finally we provide three physically relevant examples possessing the malament  hogarth property .",
    "remember that the length of a non - spacelike , once continuously differentiable curve @xmath0 in a pseudo - riemannian manifold @xmath1 is the integral @xmath2 if exists .",
    "if this integral is unbounded we shall write @xmath3 . furthermore we will be using the following standard terminology .",
    "let @xmath4 be a space - time which is a solution to einstein s equation with a matter source represented by a stress - energy tensor @xmath5 obeying the dominant energy condition on @xmath6 .",
    "we will suppose this matter is _ fundamental _ in the sense that the associated einstein s equation ( derived as a variation of @xmath5 with respect to the metric @xmath7 ) can be put into the form of a quasilinear , diagonal , second order , hyperbolic system of partial differential equations .",
    "it is well - known that in this case @xmath4 admits a well - posed initial value formulation @xmath8 @xcite @xcite . here",
    "@xmath9 is a connected , spacelike hypersurface , @xmath10 is the restricted riemannian metric on @xmath9 while @xmath11 is the second fundamental form of @xmath12 as embedded in @xmath4 .",
    "now consider the following class of space - times ( cf .",
    "@xcite but also @xcite@xcite ) :    let @xmath8 be an initial data set for einstein s equation , with @xmath12 a complete riemannian manifold .",
    "suppose a fundamental matter field is given represented by its stress - energy tensor @xmath5 satisfying the dominant energy condition .",
    "let @xmath4 be a maximal analytical extension ( if exists ) of the unique maximal cauchy development of the above initial data set .",
    "then @xmath4 is called a _ malament  hogarth space - time _ if there is a future - directed timelike half - curve @xmath13 such that @xmath14 and there is a point @xmath15 satisfying @xmath16 . the event @xmath15 is called a _ malament  hogarth event_. @xmath17    note that if @xmath4 is a malament  hogarth space - time , then there is a future - directed timelike curve @xmath18\\rightarrow m$ ] from a point @xmath19 to @xmath20 satisfying @xmath21 .",
    "the point @xmath22 can be chosen to lie in the causal future of the past endpoint of @xmath23 .",
    "moreover the reason we require fundamental matter fields obeying the dominant energy condition , geodesically complete initial surfaces etc .",
    ", is that we want to exclude the very artificial examples for malament  hogarth space - times .",
    "the motivation is the following ( for details we refer to @xcite ) .",
    "consider a turing machine realized by a physical computer @xmath24 moving along the curve @xmath23 of _ infinite _ proper time .",
    "hence the physical computer ( identified with @xmath23 ) can perform arbitrarily long calculations in the ordinary sense .",
    "being @xmath4 a malament  hogarth space - time , there is an observer @xmath25 following the curve @xmath26 ( hence denoted by @xmath27 of _ finite _ proper time such that he touches the malament  hogarth event @xmath15 in finite proper time . but by definition @xmath16 therefore in @xmath20 he can receive the answer for a _ yes or no question _ as the result of an _ arbitrarily long _ calculation carried out by the physical computer @xmath23 .",
    "this is because @xmath23 can send a light beam at arbitrarily late proper time to @xmath26 .",
    "clearly the pair @xmath28 is an _ artificial computing system _ i.e. , a generalized computer in the sense of @xcite .",
    "imagine the following situation as an example .",
    "@xmath23 is asked to check all theorems of our usual set theory ( zfc ) in order to check consistency of mathematics .",
    "this task can be carried out by @xmath23 since its world line has infinite proper time .",
    "if @xmath23 finds a contradiction , it can send a message ( for example a light beam ) to @xmath26 .",
    "hence if @xmath26 receives a signal from @xmath23 _ before _ the malament  hogarth event @xmath20 he can be sure that zfc set theory is not consistent . on the other hand , if @xmath26 does not receive any signal before @xmath20 then , _",
    "@xmath20 , @xmath26 can conclude that zfc set theory is consistent .",
    "note that @xmath26 having finite proper time between the events @xmath29 ( starting with the experiment ) and @xmath30 ( touching the malament  hogarth event ) , he can be sure about the consistency of zfc set theory in finite ( possibly very short ) time .",
    "this shows that certain very general formulations of the church  turing thesis can not be valid in the framework of classical general relativity @xcite .    one can raise the question if malament ",
    "hogarth space - times are relevant or not from a physical viewpoint .",
    "we put off this very important question for a few moments ; instead we prove basic properties of malament  hogarth space - times by evoking lemma 4.1 and lemma 4.3 from @xcite .",
    "these characteristics are also helpful in looking for realistic examples .",
    "let @xmath4 be a malament  hogarth space - time with a timelike curve @xmath23 as above .",
    "then @xmath4 is not globally hyperbolic . moreover ,",
    "if @xmath15 is a malament  hogarth event and @xmath31 is a connected spacelike hypersurface such that @xmath32 then @xmath20 is on or beyond @xmath33 , the future cauchy horizon of @xmath9 .",
    "_ consider the point @xmath22 such that @xmath34 .",
    "if @xmath4 was globally hyperbolic then @xmath4 would be strongly causal and in particular @xmath35 compact .",
    "we know that im@xmath36 hence in fact im@xmath37 .",
    "consequently its future ( and of course , past ) endpoint are contained in @xmath38 ( cf .",
    "lemma 8.2.1 in @xcite ) .",
    "however @xmath23 is a causal curve with @xmath39 hence it is future inextendible i.e. , has no future endpoint .",
    "but this is impossible hence @xmath38 can not be compact or strong causality must be violated within this set leading us to a contradiction .",
    "secondly , assume @xmath40 i.e. , @xmath20 is an interior point of the future domain of dependence of @xmath9 .",
    "then there is an @xmath41 chronologically preceded by @xmath20 ( with respect to some time function assigned to the cauchy foliation of @xmath42 ) . letting @xmath43 then @xmath44 hence @xmath45 is a globally hyperbolic space - time containing the malament  hogarth event @xmath20 and the curve @xmath23 .",
    "consequently we can proceed as above to arrive at a contradiction again .",
    "@xmath17    the proof of this proposition provides us a characterization of malament  hogarth space - times .",
    "let @xmath4 be a malament  hogarth space - time with @xmath46 a malament  hogarth event .",
    "consider a timelike curve @xmath23 as above with _",
    "then either @xmath48 is non - compact or strong causality is violated at @xmath15 .",
    "[ mhosztalyozas ]    _ proof .",
    "_ we just have to repeat the pattern of the proof of the previous proposition .",
    "assume @xmath48 is compact .",
    "then this set is bounded with respect to @xmath49 in the geodesically complete @xmath12 .",
    "as we have seen , there always exists a timelike curve @xmath50\\rightarrow m$ ] of finite proper time with @xmath51 and @xmath30 ( `` observer '' ) .",
    "hence by boundedness all points of @xmath48 can be joined with @xmath20 by a causal curve of finite length therefore our assumption implies that @xmath52 is compact , too .",
    "but the complete timelike curve @xmath53 with @xmath54 is future inextendible and satisfies im@xmath55 hence there must exist a point @xmath56 at which strong causality is violated ( again by lemma 8.2.1 of @xcite ) .",
    "but this point can not exists in the interior of @xmath57 because this part is globally hyperbolic therefore must have @xmath58 and it is a malament  hogarth event in this case as easily seen .",
    "consequently @xmath59 holds .    in the opposite way",
    "if strong causality is valid in @xmath4 then the same is true for the portion @xmath60 with im@xmath55 .",
    "but in this case this set can not be compact implying @xmath48 is non - compact taking into account geodesic completeness of @xmath12 .",
    "@xmath17    now we can turn our attention to the existence of physically relevant examples of space - times containing gravitational computers .",
    "proposition [ mhosztalyozas ] indicates that the class of malament  hogarth space - times can be divided into two major subclasses : the first one contains space - times in which an infinite , non - compact portion of a spacelike submanifold is visible from some event .",
    "the question is if certain members of these space - times obey some energy condition or not with some standard matter content ( in this case a space - time is considered as `` physical '' ) .",
    "the answer is yes : examples for such space - times are provided by the following proposition .",
    "kerr space - time and the universal covering space of anti - de sitter space - time are malament  hogarth space - times .    _ proof .",
    "_ in the case of the universal cover of anti - de sitter space - time ( which is a vacuum space with non - vanishing cosmological constant ) this has been proved in @xcite while the case of kerr space - time ( this is a vacuum space - time with vanishing cosmological constant ) has been worked out in @xcite .",
    "@xmath17    ( we remark that reissner  nordstrm space - time , very similar to the kerr one , also admits malament  hogarth events ) .",
    "the second subclass consists of those space - times which violate strong causality in a suitable way .",
    "a typical example is presented in the next proposition .",
    "consider a particular maximal analytical extension of taub  nut space - time .",
    "then this space - time possesses the malament ",
    "hogarth property and malament  hogarth events are situated along the cauchy horizons of this space - time .",
    "_ take the space @xmath61 equipped with the taub ",
    "nut metric @xmath7 on it ( cf .",
    "@xcite , pp .",
    "170 - 178 ) : @xmath62 this is a spherically symmetric vacuum metric and @xmath63",
    "moreover @xmath64 are the euler angles on @xmath65 i.e. , @xmath66 , @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",
    "the metric is singular at the zeros of @xmath69 equal to @xmath70 hence apparently we have to make the restriction @xmath71 .",
    "the time orientation is fixed such that @xmath72 increases . however introducing the new variable @xmath73 we can rewrite the metric ( also denoted by @xmath7 ) as @xmath74 and now we can allow @xmath75 without difficulty but the resulting analytical extension lacks global hyperbolicity . indeed",
    ", the surfaces given by @xmath76 , diffeomorphic to @xmath65 , represent cauchy horizons ( and coincide if @xmath77 ) .",
    "there is another analytical extension of taub  nut space , too .",
    "for details see @xcite .",
    "now we can proceed as follows .",
    "consider a smooth curve @xmath78 given by @xmath79 with respect to the coordinate system ( [ kiterjesztes ] ) .",
    "the constants @xmath80 are fixed .",
    "this curve is clearly future directed and runs in the region @xmath81 which is inside the original globally hyperbolic region @xmath71 if @xmath82 .",
    "its tangent vector field is @xmath83 of pointwise length @xmath84 by using ( [ kiterjesztes ] ) .",
    "but for @xmath85 that is , for @xmath86 this is clearly negative showing that our curve is not only future directed but @xmath87 that is , timelike as well .",
    "its length is @xmath88 hence is complete",
    ". clearly , @xmath89 spirals around the cauchy surface @xmath90 infinitely many times while approaching it .",
    "furthermore this @xmath89 can be deformed into a future directed , timelike complete geodesic , too . to see this ,",
    "consider the sequence of points @xmath91 for a suitable monotonly increasing sequence of points @xmath92 .",
    "since the portion of the extended taub  nut space - time containing @xmath89 is globally hyperbolic and @xmath93 if @xmath94 we can find future directed timelike geodesic segments @xmath95 connecting @xmath96 with @xmath97 . if the partition is dense enough , @xmath95 s are close to @xmath98 s where @xmath99\\}$ ] .",
    "because geodesics have extremal length among curves , we can write for an at least piecewise smooth geodesic @xmath100 that @xmath101 in other words our future directed timelike geodesic @xmath23 just constructed is complete and spirals around the hopf - circle @xmath102 ( here @xmath103 and @xmath104 coincide with constants chosen in ( [ betagorbe ] ) ) .",
    "this circle is on the cauchy horizon @xmath90 of the maximally extended taub  nut space - time .",
    "now it is straightforward that at all the events @xmath105 strong causality is violated by @xmath23 ( or @xmath89 ) .    finally consider an even more simple smooth curve @xmath106\\rightarrow s^3\\times\\r$ ] which is given with respect to ( [ kiterjesztes ] ) as @xmath107 hence @xmath108 yielding @xmath109 via ( [ kiterjesztes ] ) .",
    "consequently for @xmath110 i.e. , for @xmath111 one again has @xmath112 if @xmath113 demonstrating that this curve is also future directed and timelike of finite length : @xmath114 proceeding as above we can deform this curve into an at least piecewise smooth timelike geodesic @xmath26 also of finite length .",
    "one can see that @xmath115 furthermore @xmath26 intersects @xmath23 infinitely many times hence the point @xmath116 is a malament  hogarth event .",
    "consequently we can interpret @xmath23 as a `` computer '' required in the definition of malament  hogarth space - times moreover @xmath26 as an `` observer '' .",
    "this shows the malament ",
    "hogarth property of taub  nut space ( together with the technical condition @xmath117 but this is certainly avoidable by using better curves ) .",
    "@xmath17    after getting the feel of malament  hogarth space - times we move to the next section where their relation with the strong cosmic censorship is pointed out .",
    "cosmic censorship is being used to rule out space - times where causality is violated because of the presence of `` naked singularities '' . since nowadays we are unable to grasp the notion of a naked singularity in its full generality we are forced to use some other indirect characteristics to remove those space - times where causality breaks down from the class of physically relevant ones .",
    "the most straightforward notion is global hyperbolicity because in this case all events can be predicted from an initial data set fixed in advance along a cauchy surface . however this restriction is too strong : physically relevant examples like anti - de sitter , taub  nut and even the kerr  newman space - times would considered as `` wrong '' by requiring simply global hyperbolicity .",
    "consequently the recent versions of the strong cosmic censor conjecture are formulated by postulating global hyperbolicity for `` physically relevant '' space - times but also providing a `` list '' of sporadic examples lacking global hyperbolicity nevertheless considered as `` physically relevant '' .",
    "a more or less up - to - date formulation is given in @xcite on p. 305 .    _",
    "( standard formulation of the strong cosmic censor conjecture ) _ let @xmath8 be an initial data set for einstein s equation , with @xmath12 a complete riemannian manifold .",
    "suppose a fundamental matter field is given represented by its stress - energy tensor @xmath5 satisfying the dominant energy condition .",
    "then , if the maximal cauchy development of this initial data set is extendible , for each @xmath118 in any extension , either strong causality is violated at @xmath20 or @xmath48 is non - compact .",
    "it is quite surprising that in light of proposition [ mhosztalyozas ] malament  hogarth events have exactly the same properties as points have on the cauchy horizons in the above formulation .",
    "in other words the content of proposition [ mhosztalyozas ] is that malament ",
    "hogarth property implies the behaviour for the cauchy horizon required by the strong cosmic censor conjecture .    to see precise equivalence",
    "we should establish a converse to proposition [ mhosztalyozas ] .",
    "that is , if a space - time is non - globally hyperbolic and for its events @xmath118 either @xmath48 is non - compact or strong causality is violated at @xmath20 then is @xmath4 a malament  hogarth space - time ?",
    "the answer is certainly no because the conditions are insufficient .",
    "for instance we should know something on the length of the cauchy development in question .",
    "however the statement `` for each @xmath118 in any extension , either strong causality is violated at @xmath20 or @xmath48 is non - compact '' is being used only to incorporate the classical examples like kerr  newman or taub  nut into the allowed class of space - times .",
    "but we have seen that these examples possess the malament  hogarth property . in other words the malament ",
    "hogarth property appears as a unifying way to enumerate the important and known sporadic examples in the strong cosmic censor conjecture considered as `` still physically relevant '' although they are non - globally hyperbolic i.e. , which posses an initial value formulation but their maximal cauchy developments are extendible .",
    "hence we can not resist the temptation to reformulate the above conjecture as follows .",
    "_ ( reformulation of the strong cosmic censor conjecture ) _ let @xmath8 be an initial data set for einstein s equation , with @xmath12 a complete riemannian manifold .",
    "suppose a fundamental matter field is given represented by its stress - energy tensor @xmath5 satisfying the dominant energy condition .",
    "then , if the maximal cauchy development of this initial data set is extendible , this extension is a malament  hogarth space - time .",
    "we can examine the strong cosmic censor scenario from a naive stability point of view as well .",
    "it is well - known ( cf .",
    "theorem 8.3.14 of @xcite ) that a globally hyperbolic space - time is stable causal .",
    "but stable causality is a stable property under small perturbations of the metric ( here `` small '' is understood as follows : if @xmath7 is the original metric and @xmath119 is its perturbation then for the tensor field @xmath49 we have @xmath120 small in an appropriate sobolev norm on the space of metrics over a fixed manifold @xmath6 ) .",
    "consequently global hyperbolicity seems to be a stable property hence globally hyperbolic space - times apparently form the `` interior '' of the set of `` physically reasonable '' space - times allowed by the strong cosmic censor .    on the other hand ,",
    "it is known or at least conjectured that space - times like ( maximal extensions of ) kerr or taub  nut are unstable in the sense that small perturbations of these metrics deform the cauchy horizons of these space - times into a real curvature singularity . in the case of black holes",
    "this is called mass inflation ( e.g. cf .",
    "@xcite ) . therefore these space - times may be considered as unstable in an appropriate fashion . or",
    ", turning the coin , we can intuitively say that the malament ",
    "hogarth property is an unstable property of `` physically relevant '' space - times and form the `` borderline '' between allowed and non - allowed space - times by the strong cosmic censorship .",
    "it is quite interesting that exactly this unstable thin class admits gravitational computers providing non - turing computations .",
    "the whole conjectured situation is sketched in the following figure",
    ".    * figure 1 . * the strong cosmic censorship scenario",
    "as a conclusion we have to emphasize again that our considerations require future work for example it is important to understand if other marginal space - times ( from the point of view of the strong cosmic censor ) admit the malament  hogarth property or not .",
    "another important problem is to understand the stability properties of malament  hogarth space - times mentioned above and see if these indeed form a kind of boundary in a strict functional analytic sense for physically relevant metrics over a fixed manifold ."
