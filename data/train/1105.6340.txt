    "derivation of macroscopic transport laws _ ab initio _ from microscopic laws of motion is still one of the hot topics in modern mathematical physics .",
    "the main question usually investigated is what type of transport emerges from microscopic laws , the two extreme cases being ballistic or diffusive transport . yet",
    ", such classification seems elusive , especially in the field of strongly correlated quantum systems . to nevertheless explain the emergence of macroscopic transport laws , phenomenological approaches , viable under certain assumptions , are often used .",
    "one such approach is based on the well - known kinetic theory of gases,@xcite devised by boltzmann , where macroscopic transport laws emerge due to ( quasi)particle scattering .",
    "also routinely used is linear - response theory , which gives a direct method of calculating transport coefficients using variants of green - kubo formulas,@xcite assuming local quasiequilibrium .",
    "our approach here is different .",
    "starting from the equations of motion ( schr \" odinger equation or master equation ) we use extensive numerical simulations to study transport in the one - dimensional heisenberg model .",
    "low - dimensional spin models have been studied from the very beginning of quantum mechanics .",
    "the heisenberg model , suggested  @xcite by w.  heisenberg in 1928 , was initially proposed to explain a high phase transition temperature in ferromagnets that could not be accounted for by any other known direct interaction .",
    "interaction between nearest neighbor atoms , described by the heisenberg model , the so - called exchange interaction , is an effective one and comes about due to the pauli exclusion principle .",
    "another important source of motivation to study such simple one - dimensional ( 1d ) models , in particular antiferromagnetic ones , comes due to the fact that they represent simplest models of strongly correlated electronic systems , much studied in past decades .",
    "in addition , one - dimensional spin systems are realized in real so - called spin - chain materials.@xcite experiments have shown , see e.g. ref .  , that 1d spin chains found in such materials , for instance the isotropic heisenberg one , have a pronounced effect on transport properties , giving additional boost to theoretical studies . a great deal of research",
    "was devoted to the transport properties of the anisotropic heisenberg model ( _ xxz _ model ) .",
    "although it is one of the simplest 1d spin models , being even solvable by the bethe ansatz,@xcite there are still many open questions concerning its transport properties , including whether finite - temperature spin transport is ballistic or diffusive .",
    "classification of transport regimes was the main motivation for our work .",
    "let us briefly review known facts about transport in the 1d heisenberg model ; for more extensive reviews see refs .  .",
    "as forementioned , one of the standard approaches for studying transport properties of quantum systems is linear - response theory .",
    "ballistic and diffusive transport can be distinguished via an observation of the drude weight , the prefactor of a @xmath0 function at zero frequency in the frequency - dependent transport coefficient .",
    "nonzero drude weight signals ballistic transport in the linear - response regime .",
    "the question of energy transport in the _ xxz _ model is simple : energy current is a conserved quantity  @xcite and therefore energy transport is ballistic .",
    "for the dependence of the thermal drude weight on parameters , see ref .   and references therein .    in the present work ,",
    "we shall focus on magnetization ( spin ) transport , which is much less understood , with only few rigorous results .",
    "it has been shown that the spin drude weight is nonzero ( i.e. , magnetization transport is ballistic ) at zero temperature  @xcite in the gapless phase for @xmath1 as well as at infinite temperature  @xcite for @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the anisotropy .",
    "it is reasonable to expect , and also supported by quantum monte carlo calculations,@xcite that transport is ballistic also at finite temperatures . on general grounds ,",
    "a lot of attention has been devoted to the connection between integrability and the nature of transport  @xcite being either ballistic or diffusive .",
    "a recent solvable diffusive model  @xcite shows that solvability does not necessarily imply ballistic transport .",
    "while the spin transport in the gapless phase is relatively well understood , the behavior at the isotropic point @xmath4 and in the gapped phase @xmath5 is hotly debated .",
    "the main difficulty is that numerically it is very hard to access behavior in the thermodynamic limit , while there are only few analytical approaches . a notable one is in terms of mazur s inequality  @xcite , which can be used to bound the drude weight away from zero if a conserved quantity exists that has a nonzero overlap with the magnetization current.@xcite unfortunately , in the half - filled case ( zero total magnetization ) and @xmath5 of interest here , no such quantity is known .",
    "numerical methods like exact diagonalization  @xcite or the lanczos method  @xcite are all limited to small systems of few @xmath6 spins , making thermodynamic extrapolation difficult .",
    "a relatively recent method is a time - dependent density - matrix renormalization - group ( tdmrg ) procedure that enables simulation of 1d nearest - neighbor systems of several @xmath7 spins .",
    "it has been used successfully to study the spreading of wavepackets in the _ xxz _ model.@xcite particularly useful is its master equation variant , where one has a genuine nonequilibrium setting , enabling one to study also far from equilibrium situations .",
    "it has been used to show a diffusive transport in the gapped phase at infinite temperature,@xcite which has been also confirmed using correlation functions  @xcite and the projector operator method.@xcite analytical studies of the master equation describing nonequilibrium _",
    "xxz _ model in the gapped phase frequently have difficulties .",
    "one problem is that perturbative treatments often have zero convergence radius in the thermodynamic limit , for instance , a perturbative series in the coupling to the reservoirs  @xcite for @xmath8 or a perturbative series  @xcite in @xmath3 , or they have a finite convergence radius but are difficult to obtain in the thermodynamic limit , as is the case for large @xmath3 in the gapped phase.@xcite perturbative studies in @xmath9 suggest that the diffusion constant decreases as @xmath3 increases.@xcite    because most spin - chain materials realize the isotropic heisenberg model , the point @xmath4 is of particular interest .",
    "it is also the most controversial one .",
    "analytical bethe ansatz calculations give contradictory results , indicating zero  @xcite or a nonzero drude weight,@xcite with the problem being how to properly account for all states important at a nonzero temperature .",
    "quantum monte carlo calculations,@xcite bosonization,@xcite and exact diagonalization  @xcite predict a nonzero drude weight at finite temperatures for @xmath4 .",
    "based on bosonization  @xcite and numerically calculated current autocorrelation function using a tdmrg method , a zero ( or small ) drude weight at nonzero temperature is advocated in refs .  , whose results are also supported by quantum monte carlo calculation in ref .",
    ". a recent result,@xcite on the other hand predicts anomalous magnetization transport at infinite temperature and @xmath4 , with the diffusion constant diverging as @xmath10 with the system size .",
    "an interesting future possibility to study 1d strongly correlated systems is via controlled experiments with cold atoms .",
    "experimental quantum optical techniques have advanced to the point where it is possible to realize such models in a controlled environment of optical latices or ion traps .",
    "an advantage of such an approach is that one can choose the values of system s parameters at will .",
    "first realizations of exchange interaction or of simple spin systems have already been achieved.@xcite    the main goal of the present paper is to study the magnetization transport at finite temperatures in the gapped phase of the anisotropic spin-@xmath11 heisenberg model .",
    "two numerical approaches , both based on the tdmrg method , will be used : one is based on observation of time evolution of magnetization profiles for initial nonequilibrium pure states , while the second one is based on studying the magnetization current in the nonequilibrium steady state of an open quantum system described by a quantum master equation . by the first method ,",
    "we could , in principle , discriminate between the ballistic or diffusive behavior by comparing the evolution of expectation values of magnetization ( @xmath12-spin component at each chain site ) to that expected from macroscopic transport laws , provided we would be able to simulate very long chains for a very long time .",
    "unfortunately , this is not the case and the results for pure state evolution are rather inconclusive , showing a mixture of ballistic and diffusive characteristics . in the master equation approach",
    "though , performed at higher energy densities , one can give a quantitative prediction about the transport by studying the scaling of the magnetization current with the system size at a fixed driving .",
    "the two methods work best in the complementary temperature regimes .",
    "the one for pure states is best at low temperatures , where a state only locally deviates from the ground state and its entanglement is small , while the master equation simulation with density matrices works best at high temperatures where the operator - space entanglement of a density matrix is small .",
    "both methods have been used before to study the magnetization transport in the _ xxz _ model , pure - state method in ref .   and master equation in ref .",
    ", however not in the temperature regime considered in the present paper .",
    "we also point out that with a pure - state evolution at very low temperatures one is not able to access the asymptotic transport regime with present computers , so some care has to be taken making statements about the transport .",

    "is thus equivalent to a transport of particles in eq .  .",

    "both descriptions can therefore be used interchangeably .",
    "total magnetization @xmath27 is conserved quantity in the _ xxz _ model ; in fermionic picture , it corresponds to the conservation of the total number of particles , @xmath28 .",
    "we have used two closely related variants of the time - dependent density - matrix renormalization - group ( tdmrg ) method : one for the evolution of pure quantum states and another for the evolution of a density matrix describing a system coupled to reservoirs .",
    "both methods are based on writing expansion coefficients of a state in terms of products of matrices , the so - called matrix product state ( mps ) ansatz for pure states and matrix product operator ( mpo ) ansatz for density matrices . in the following",
    ", we will only briefly overview the tdmrg method . for a more complete presentation",
    "see original references.@xcite    for the determination of a profile evolution from a given initial state , a time - dependent schrdinger equation has to be solved , @xmath29 state vector @xmath30 , spanned by the tensor product of local hilbert spaces for each site , can be written as @xmath31 where @xmath32 enumerates all basis vectors of the hilbert space @xmath33 with @xmath34 for the spin - down / up states .",
    "the dimension of hilbert space for the spin chain of length @xmath19 is @xmath35 .",
    "solving the schrdinger equation using exact diagonalization is thus possible only for very small systems .",
    "however , it turns out that often not the whole hilbert space is relevant for the solution and much larger systems can be solved by a clever choice of basis vectors , for instance , as is done in the tdmrg method . in mps formulation ,",
    "expansion coefficients @xmath36 are expressed as traces of product of @xmath19 matrices @xmath37 , @xmath38 , of dimension @xmath39 , @xmath40 time evolution of the system is therefore described by time - dependent matrices @xmath41 , which can be efficiently calculated if the propagator @xmath42 can be factorized into a product of unitaries that act only on two nearest - neighbor sites of a chain .",
    "this can be approximately done for short time - step propagation @xmath43 using suzuki - trotter expansion .",
    "the system hamiltonian is separated into two parts , @xmath44 , where all terms grouped inside each @xmath45 and @xmath46 mutually commute .",
    "general suzuki - trotter expansion can be written@xcite as @xmath47 , where the order @xmath48 depends on the actual scheme used .",
    "the @xmath49 contribution gives rise to suzuki - trotter error , which can be reduced by either using expansions of higher order ( having larger @xmath48 ) or reducing the step size @xmath50 .",
    "after each time step , the mps form of the state has to be restored using the svd algorithm . in the process",
    "the matrices @xmath37 are enlarged and to prevent an exponential growth of their dimension they must be truncated back to dimension @xmath51 .",
    "this produces a truncation error @xmath52 which depends on the entanglement of the state being described .",
    "a cumulative truncation error due to truncations at each time step can serve as a very rough estimate of the precision . a more robust method to check accuracy though is to simply increase @xmath51 and check that the results do not change . by using imaginary time step @xmath53 ,",
    "the tdmrg method can also be used for obtaining a ground state of a given hamiltonian .    the tdmrg method for evolution of pure - states",
    "can be extended to the evolution of mixed states by introducing a @xmath54-dimensional hilbert space of operators , with arbitrary operator given by @xmath55 where @xmath56 , @xmath33 , and @xmath57 , with @xmath58 , @xmath59 , @xmath60 , @xmath61 , while lower indices denote a site along a chain . following the reasoning of the mps formulation for pure state evolution ,",

    "the time evolution of density matrix @xmath63 is governed by the lindblad equation , with a formal solution @xmath64 , where @xmath65 is a liouvillian superoperator .",
    "thus the propagator for time step @xmath50 can be again factorized as a product of local propagators using suzuki - trotter expansion , providing an efficient numerical scheme for the time evolution of a density operator .",
    "because @xmath65 also contains dissipative terms due to a coupling with reservoirs , some care must be taken to ensure that one has a schmidt - decomposed form of mpo at each step .",
    "details of our implementation can be found in the appendix of ref .  .",
    "in the simulations of pure states , the suzuki - trotter expansion of second order was used ( @xmath66 ) , mostly with the time step of size @xmath67 .",
    "the dimensions of the decomposition @xmath51 were chosen such that the truncation error on each time step during the evolution did not exceed @xmath68 ( required dimensions of decomposition @xmath51 were of the order of @xmath69 ) . for master - equation simulations",
    "a fourth - order method with a time step @xmath67 has been used .",
    "the results were also verified by repeating simulations at somewhat higher decomposition sizes @xmath51 and smaller time steps , showing no deviation in results .",
    "the main goal is to study magnetization transport in the heisenberg model at low energies , particularly for @xmath5 , where magnetization transport looks diffusive at an infinite temperature.@xcite we shall use two methods , one will be spreading of localized packets and the other the dependence of the spin current on the system size in the stationary nonequilibrium state of a chain coupled to different reservoirs at chain ends .",
    "it is useful to have a `` thermometer '' with which we will be able to determine the temperature to which respective simulations correspond . in the thermodynamic limit of stationary states of a master equation under weak driving",
    "the state is in a local quasiequilibrium and the temperature is a well defined concept . in the wavepacket simulations",
    "though , in which packets are initially far from equilibrium , we prefer to speak about energy density instead , as there is no local quasi - equilibrium and the temperature is not well defined . another important scale in the gapped regime of @xmath5 is the size of the energy gap between the ground and the first excited state .    in this section",

    "parts with higher energy are `` overtaken '' by lower - energy excitations , visible as the stretching of the energy - density profile in front of the main peak .",
    "all these simulations of the spreading of localized packets of magnetization show signs of ballistic spreading , either in terms of ballistic jets , or ballistically propagating wavefronts .",
    "one should be careful though about concluding that the transport is also ballistic at large times and in the thermodynamic limit , as these features could exhibit a nontrivial long - time behavior .",
    "as mentioned before , there could be a large time scale @xmath144 , so that only for times larger than @xmath144 transport starts to show purely diffusive character .",

    "we define the variance of the spin profile @xmath157 and summarize our observations about the influence of the initial state preparation on the variance and overall evolution .",
    "time dependence of variance , defined in the fermionic picture of the _ xxz _ model as @xmath162 was extensively studied in ref .  . there ,",
    "a ballistic spreading was established for @xmath163 , while for @xmath164 and @xmath74 a diffusive transport was advocated based on linear growth of @xmath165 at intermediate times .",
    "for @xmath158 it was shown  @xcite that one gets @xmath166 .",
    "linear growth of variance in the case of diffusive transport follows from the macroscopic diffusion law for magnetization transport , @xmath167 .",
    "we were able to confirm the ballistic growth of variance for @xmath2 .",

    "depending on the details of the preparation of the initial state , more complex dynamics emerges , which can result in a linear variance growth for intermediate times  @xcite ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : variance ] at @xmath168 ) .",
    "the actual shape of the central magnetization packet though does not follow the behavior that is expected from the macroscopic diffusion equation as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : sig5b2_s0 ] .    while in the case of @xmath2 the details of the initial state preparation do not have pronounced effects on the evolution ( either by observing @xmath157 or the profile directly , both show a ballistic behavior ) , the effects are stronger in the case of @xmath169 . for states with @xmath150 ( fig .  [",

    "[ fig : variance ] ) seem purely ballistic , at least at attainable time scales . for the @xmath74 states on the other hand , while the profile evolution still contains ballistic features ( fig .",
    "[ fig : sig5b2_s0 ] ) , the variance does not grow as @xmath170 but instead has a nontrivial time dependence .",
    "while this nonballistic growth of variance may be taken as a hint of transition to a diffusive behavior , a detailed analysis of spin profiles reveals that observed behavior can be attributed to the negative magnetization `` bumps '' on the outer edges of spreading disturbance as seen on fig .",
    "[ fig : sig5b2_s0 ] for times @xmath171 . as the value of the variance @xmath157 strongly depends on the profile values further away from the middle of the chain , such bumps have a strong impact on the variance .",
    "the occurrence of the bumps in the profile can be attributed to the emergence of a nonequilibrium magnetization plateau in the central region of the chain , between the packets traveling in opposite directions . due to the conservation of total magnetization @xmath103 ,",
    "this nonequilibrium plateau of magnetization is compensated by an opposite deviation of magnetization on the edge of disturbance .",
    "variance of the profile therefore should not be taken as a sole criteria for the determination of transport regime .",

    "there are therefore 16 lindblad operators @xmath174 at each end .",
    "they are chosen in such a way that they would induce a grandcanonical state @xmath176 on these two spins in the absence of hamiltonian evolution by @xmath77 .",
    "because in our case the evolution by @xmath77 is present it introduces some boundary resistance effects that also affect the efficiency of the method . due to these boundary effects",
    "it is rather difficult to cool the chain to very low temperatures  @xcite .",
    "we use reservoirs with the same temperature @xmath177 at the left and @xmath178 on the right end of the chain , while the chemical potential is @xmath179 at the left and @xmath180 at the right end . because of this symmetric driving the average magnetization in the ness is zero , as is also the energy current . to calculate @xmath181 , and",
    "therefore also ness given by @xmath182 , we use the tdmrg method with a matrix product operator ansatz . after long time @xmath181 converges to a stationary nonequilibrium state",
    "whose expectation values then give us transport properties .",
    "due to boundary resistance the temperature in the bulk of the chain is not the same as the imposed temperature of the `` reservoir '' lindblad operators . to determine the actual temperature in the system in the nonequilibrium steady state we use the expectation value of the energy density as a `` thermometer'',@xcite equating it to the canonical one , and thereby determining the effective temperature , as described at the beginning of this section .",
    "because one has to simulate evolution of density operators instead of pure states , open system formulation is computationally more demanding than pure - state simulation .",
    "this typically means that somewhat smaller chains can be simulated .",
    "in addition , simulation at low energy ( temperature ) is more demanding because the operator - space entanglement of the ness increases with decreasing temperature.@xcite for instance , at an infinite temperature the ness , being proportional to @xmath183 , is separable with no entanglement .",
    "therefore , due to computational constraints , we had to focus on somewhat higher energies than in the wavepacket simulations .",
    "once we determine ness for a given driving and length @xmath19 we calculate the expectation value of local magnetization , obtaining the difference in magnetization between left and right ends @xmath184 , local spin current @xmath185 ( which is independent of @xmath17 ) , and local energy density . because the deviation from the equilibrium zero magnetization is small , around @xmath186 in high energy simulations and @xmath187 at the lowest energy , and",
    "the imposed temperature is the same at both ends , the energy density in the ness is constant along the chain . the effective temperature in the bulk of the chain",

    "[ fig : kappa ] , one can clearly see that the diffusion constant increases at lower energies , the increase being perhaps exponential in the inverse temperature @xmath195 , as indicated by a dashed line . at low temperatures",

    "[ fig : sig5b2_s0 ] , and we take the average temperature @xmath196 as a crude estimate , the diffusion constant would be @xmath197 .",
    "this means that to really observe a diffusive behavior in a wavepacket simulation one would have to simulate chain up to times of the order @xmath198 , demanding also chains of a similar size .",
    "we expect that ballistic jet , visible at short times , will disappear after this long time scale .",
    "all these results mean that with the tdmrg , being limited to few @xmath7 spins , one probably can not conclusively say whether the spin transport is diffusive or ballistic at such low energies .    with an open - system tdmrg version we have nevertheless obtained strong indications that at not too low temperatures , @xmath199 , the anisotropic heisenberg model is diffusive .",

    "<S> we study finite - temperature magnetization transport in a one - dimensional anisotropic heisenberg model , focusing in particular on the gapped phase . using numerical simulations by two different methods , a propagation of localized wavepackets and a study of nonequilibrium steady states of a master equation in a linear - response regime , </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that the transport at finite temperatures is diffusive . with decreasing temperature the diffusion constant increases , possibly exponentially fast . </S>",
    "<S> this means that at low temperatures the transition from ballistic to asymptotic diffusive behavior happens at very long times . </S>",
    "<S> we also study dynamics of initial domain wall like states , showing that on the attainable time scales they remain localized . </S>"
