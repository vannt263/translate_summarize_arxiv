    "the density fluctuations of the optional values bring the change of the internal energy at the interface of the two different clusters composed of single spin value .",
    "it changes the possible configurations of the occupation simultaneously , which is exactly the entropy .",
    "the first order phase transition occurs with the replacement of the optional spin values related to the successive spontaneous breaking , which is irrelevant for the value of spin value @xmath1 .",
    "the interval of @xmath1 is always @xmath44 no matter that it is the integer or half - integer case , which induces the same internal energy difference .",
    "the balance of the free energy is the same for the different spin - s cases . for these low temperature transition points , the relative boltzmann weight @xmath106 due to",

    "the gap of @xmath107 is @xmath128 for all the first order phase transitions and @xmath44 for the last continuous phase transition respectively .",

    "it is tricky to locate the position of the critical point by the step of @xmath107 because of the subtlety of @xmath107 due to the cutoff in the contraction process , however , the integer platform of @xmath107 associated to the degeneracy of the system is intrinsic , which comes from the deep insight that the fix - point of the tensor representation corresponds to the fix point of rg flow associated to the phase transition . it does open the new window to observe the phase transition .",
    "the improvement and exploration about the visualization like @xmath107 from the tensor itself is still on the way .    in summary",
    ", we discuss the phase transitions of the blume - capel model on the square lattice using the recently developed tensor network renormalization group scheme .",
