    "despite persuasive indirect evidence for the existence of dark matter in the universe and in galaxies , the direct detection of dark matter remains one of the outstanding experimental challenges of present - day physics and cosmology .",
    "a plausible candidate for the dark matter is the weakly interacting massive particle ( wimp ) and it is possible that it can be detected by laboratory experiments , particularly using cryogenic methods , which are well adapted to the small energy deposit anticipated  @xcite .",
    "supersymmetry provides a well motivated wimp candidate in the form of the lightest supersymmetric particle .",
    "wimps @xcite are expected to be gravitationally bound in a roughly isothermal halo around the visible part of our galaxy with a density of about 0.3gev/@xmath11 at the position of the earth  @xcite .",
    "interaction with ordinary matter is expected via elastic scattering on nuclei .",
    "the elastic nuclear scattering can occur via coherent ( `` spin independent '' ) or spin - dependent interactions .",
    "for the coherent case , a factor @xmath12 is expected in the cross section , favoring heavy nuclei  @xcite .",
    "we present our wimp limits in terms of this possibility .    in the cresst experiment we attempt to detect the wimp - nucleus scattering using cryogenic methods .",
    "results from the first phase of cresst using sapphire ( @xmath13 ) detectors have been previously reported , see ref .",
    "@xcite . for the second phase  @xcite presently in preparation , cresst - ii ,",
    "we have developed cryogenic detectors based on scintillating cawo@xmath0 crystals . when supplemented with a light detector",
    "these provide very efficient discrimination of nuclear recoils from radioactive @xmath14 and @xmath15 backgrounds , down to recoil energies of about 10  kev .",
    "the heaviest nucleus in our crystal is tungsten , for which the recoil energy is expected to reach up to about 40  kev , with rates below 1 event/(kg day ) .",
    "the mass of each crystal is about 300 g .",
    "data were accumulated with two of these prototype detector modules for 53 days starting january 31 2004 at the laboratori nazionali del gran sasso ( lngs ) .",
    "passive background suppression is achieved with a low background installation and the deep underground location .",
    "the overburden of 3500 meter water equivalent at the lngs leads to a reduction of the surface muon flux by @xmath16 to about 1/(m@xmath17 h ) , while the detectors themselves are shielded against ambient radioactivity by thicknesses of 14 cm of low background copper and 20 cm of low background lead . a neutron shield and a muon veto , to be installed for cresst - ii ,",
    "were not present for the data presented here .",
    "the setup for the run reported here is the same as in cresst - i , described in more detail in ref .",
    "a four channel squid system allowed the simultaneous operation of two phonon / light modules .",
    "the measurements were halted on march 23 2004 to proceed with the upgrade , which in addition to the neutron shield and the muon veto , will involve a 66 channel squid readout system to enable operation of 33 detector modules @xcite .",
    "a single detector module consists of a scintillating cawo@xmath0 `` target '' crystal , operated as a cryogenic calorimeter ( the `` phonon channel '' ) , and a nearby but separate cryogenic detector optimized for the detection of scintillation photons ( the `` light channel '' ) .",
    "the phonon channel is designed to measure the energy transfer to a nucleus of the cawo@xmath0 crystal in a wimp - nucleus elastic scattering . since a nucleus and an electron or gamma of the same energy differ substantially in the yield of scintillation light ,",
    "an effective background discrimination against gammas and electrons is obtained by a simultaneous measurement of the phonon and light signals . among different scintillating crystals ,",
    "cawo@xmath0 was selected because of its high light yield at low temperatures and the absence of a noticeable degradation of the light yield for events near the crystal surface @xcite .",
    "such a degradation , often found in coincident phonon - charge measurements and some scintillators , can cause difficulties as it may lead to a misidentification of electron / photon surface events as nuclear recoils .",
    "in addition , the large atomic mass ( a=183.86 ) of tungsten makes cawo@xmath0 a very favorable target for wimps with coherent interactions .",
    "the prototype detector modules used here @xcite consist of a 300 g cylindrical cawo@xmath0 crystal with 40 mm diameter and height , and an associated cryogenic light detector . the light detector is mounted close to a flat surface of the cawo@xmath0 crystal , and both detectors are enclosed in a housing of highly reflective polymeric multilayer foil @xcite .",
    "an important improvement of the energy resolution of the light channel was achieved by roughening the flat surface of the cawo@xmath0 facing the light detector to a roughness of about 10@xmath18 m .",
    "this reduces internal total reflection and facilitates the escape of the scintillation photons to the light detector .",
    "both detectors are read out by optimized tungsten superconducting phase transition thermometers .",
    "the arrangement is shown schematically in fig .",
    "[ fig : detector_scheme ] . the polymeric foil was measured to have a reflectivity of about 99% at the wave length of the scintillation maximum ( 420 nm ) of cawo@xmath0 .",
    "in addition we have discovered that the carrier foil onto which the reflecting foil is grown is itself scintillating at low temperatures .",
    "we mounted the reflector with the carrier foil inside , facing the detectors .",
    "this is very useful in discriminating backgrounds from @xmath19 decays on the crystal or reflector surfaces where the @xmath19 particle goes away from the crystal and only the recoil nucleus enters the cawo@xmath0 crystal , with little light emission .",
    "the additional light from the @xmath19 particle as it is absorbed on the facing surface of the foil allows the rejection of such events .",
    "an early problem of no - light events induced by stress on the crystal was eliminated by replacing teflon supports with copper beryllium springs to hold the crystal .",
    "these springs were silver coated and other elements for holding the reflecting foil were made of sintered teflon .",
    "both materials are highly reflective in the wavelength range of interest , but do not scintillate . in future designs",
    "these elements will be coated with an organic scintillator .",
    "the two cawo@xmath0 crystals used in this work were called `` julia '' and `` daisy '' , and the associated light detectors were denoted as `` be 14 '' and `` be 13 '' respectively .",
    "the detectors are operated at a temperature of about 10mk where the tungsten thermometer is in the middle of its transition between the superconducting and the normal conducting state , so that a small temperature rise of the thermometer leads to a relatively large rise of its resistance .",
    "the thermal response of the thermometer film can be described by a model @xcite which leads to a pulse described by a rise time and two decay times .",
    "roughly speaking , the initial high frequency phonons created by a particle or photon interaction are reflected many times at the free crystal surface to form a `` hot '' ( relative to the initial temperature ) `` gas '' of phonons .",
    "these athermal phonons are readily absorbed by the electrons of the thermometer . however , after thermalization of their energy in the metal the resulting thermal phonons are very weakly coupled back to the crystal .",
    "this is a kind of `` greenhouse effect '' due to the strongly decreasing thermal electron - phonon coupling at low temperature , @xmath20 .",
    "this effective thermal decoupling of the crystal is important for the `` thermal tuning '' of the detectors in that it permits the relaxation time of the thermometer to be determined essentially by the heat capacity of the thermometer and the thermal conductance to the heat bath . the thermal time",
    "constant of the thermometer is thus adjusted via a normal conducting metallic link to the copper crystal holder , which plays the role of the `` heat bath '' .",
    "the thermometer of the cawo@xmath0 crystals is a 6@xmath218  mm@xmath17 , 200 nm thick superconducting tungsten film evaporated on the surface .",
    "in addition there is a buffer layer of sio@xmath22 between the tungsten film and the cawo@xmath0 to prevent inter - diffusion between the tungsten film and the cawo@xmath0 crystal .",
    "the quite low superconducting transition temperatures of 7mk and 9mk for the present cawo@xmath0 detectors were achieved using the buffer layer and a deposition temperature of 480@xmath23c . for the tungsten etching",
    ", a dilute mixture of nah@xmath22po@xmath0 , naoh , and na@xmath24fe(cn)@xmath25 was used instead of conventional potassium based etchants to avoid radioactive contamination by @xmath26 .",
    "the electrical and thermal connections of the thermometer are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - connect ] .",
    "thermal connection and grounding of the detector is provided by two gold bond wires of 25@xmath18 m diameter , connecting a gold contact pad in the middle of the tungsten film with the copper detector holder .",
    "the holder in turn is thermally connected to the mixing chamber of the dilution refrigerator , which is stabilized at 6mk .",
    "electrical connection to the read out circuit is made by superconducting aluminum wires .",
    "these are bonded from the aluminum pads on each end of the thermometer to electrically insulated contact pads on the copper holder .",
    "superconducting wires connect the contact pads to the squid readout circuit .",
    "these connections are screwed and not soldered to avoid the radioactivity of solder joints .",
    "the resistance of the tungsten thermometer ( @xmath270.3@xmath28 ) is measured by means of a two - armed parallel circuit also shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - connect ] .",
    "a bias current of a few @xmath29 is supplied by a floating current source .",
    "one arm of the circuit is given by the superconducting film and the other consists of the input coil of a squid in series with a reference resistor ( 50  m@xmath28 ) , which provides a sensitive measurement of current changes .",
    "the squid is operated in flux locked loop mode .",
    "a rise in the thermometer resistance and so an increase in current through the squid coil is then observed as a rise in squid output voltage .",
    "a heater for controlling the temperature of the thermometer and for injecting the test pulses is provided by a 25@xmath18 m diameter gold wire bonded to a gold pad in the center of the thermometer and to small aluminum pads on either side of the thermometer ( fig .",
    "[ fig - connect ] ) . superconducting aluminum bond wires , with negligible thermal conductance at the low operating temperature , link these aluminum pads to insulated pads on the copper holder for electrical connection to the heater circuit .",
    "the external heater circuit also shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - connect ] sums the voltages u@xmath30 for controlling the temperature and the voltage u@xmath31 from a pulser module and computes the square root of the sum so that the test pulse always deliver a known heating proportional to u@xmath31 .",
    "the differential output of the heater circuit is connected via 43  k@xmath28 series resistors to the heater .      at the operating temperature ,",
    "1% or less of the energy deposited in the cawo@xmath0 is detected as scintillation light .",
    "the cryogenic light detector used to detect these scintillation photons consists of a silicon wafer ( @xmath32  mm@xmath33 ) with a tungsten thermometer . to improve the efficiency for collecting the energy of the few photons , the thermometer is supplemented by aluminum phonon collectors .",
    "this sensor , consisting of the thermometer and phonon collectors , is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - light - detector ] . in making these sensors ,",
    "an original tungsten film is covered by a superconducting 1@xmath34 thick aluminum layer on two sides ( 0.5  mm@xmath17 each ) , leaving a small uncovered tungsten film in the middle .",
    "this small uncovered region serves as the thermometer .",
    "the remaining aluminum / tungsten bilayer is superconducting with a transition temperature close to that of pure aluminum ( 1.2 k ) and so has a negligible heat capacity at the operating temperature .",
    "these phonon collectors absorb high frequency athermal phonons with an efficiency similar to that of the tungsten thermometer , leading to the creation of long lived quasi - particles , which in turn efficiently deliver their energy to the tungsten thermometer @xcite . in this way",
    "we obtain a large collecting area while maintaining a thermometer of small heat capacity @xmath35 .    in cawo@xmath0",
    "the time constant for the emission of the scintillation photons is on the order of milliseconds at mk temperatures  @xcite .",
    "thus to integrate the energy of the scintillation photons a long thermal relaxation time @xmath36 is required for the light detector .",
    "a sufficiently small thermal coupling @xmath37 of the thermometer to the heat bath is obtained by a 50 nm thick , 1.5@xmath210.1mm@xmath17 gold film overlapping the tungsten film at one end ( lower end in the figure [ fig - light - detector ] ) , which is connected to the heat bath via a 25 @xmath18 m gold wire bonded to an electrically insulated pad on the detector holder .",
    "the electrical insulation of this pad aids in the immunity of the detector against electronic interference .",
    "this thermal coupling scheme gives the desired thermal relaxation time on the order of several milliseconds .",
    "for the temperature regulation and for the heating test pulses , a second small gold film partially overlaps the tungsten thermometer on the other end ( upper end in figure [ fig - light - detector ] ) .",
    "this film is connected via aluminum bond wires to two contact pads on the detector holder .",
    "apart from the larger series resistors of 1  m@xmath28 in the heater lines , heater and squid circuits for the light channels are the same as for the phonon channels .      for the data acquisition system",
    "the output voltage of the squid electronics is split into two branches . in one branch",
    "the pulse is shaped and ac - coupled to a trigger unit , while in the other the signal is passed through an anti - aliasing filter and dc - coupled to a 16-bit transient digitizer .",
    "the time base of the transient digitizer was chosen to be @xmath38s , providing about 30 samples for the rising part of the pulse in the phonon channel .",
    "the total record length of 4096 time bins includes a `` pre - trigger '' region of 1024 samples to record the baseline before the event , while the `` post - trigger '' region of 3072 samples contains the pulse itself .",
    "the phonon and light channels were read out together , whenever one or both triggered .",
    "the transient digitizer data was then written to disk for off - line analysis .",
    "after each trigger there is a dead time of @xmath39ms to allow for the readout and the sampling of the next pre - trigger region .",
    "pulses from the other module which arrive within half of the post - trigger period are also recorded together with the time delay with respect to the first trigger .",
    "this discarding of triggers in the other module arriving after half of the post trigger period contributes a dead time of 102.4 ms per event for this other module .",
    "the accumulated dead time is measured with separate clocks for each channel .",
    "in addition to pulses from particle interactions , the data acquisition system also records the response to the periodic test pulses which are applied to each thermometer in order to monitor the behavior of the detectors .",
    "although the width of the transition from superconducting to normal resistance for a detector film is on the order of a mk , for highly stable detector response the operating point on the transition curve and so the temperature must be constant to within a few @xmath18k .",
    "short term temperature control was maintained by using the baseline of the squid output voltage between pulses as the temperature indicator and then regulating the current to the heater on the thermometer .",
    "the baseline sampling rate was 10 hz , and during a pulse the sampling was interrupted and the heater current kept constant .",
    "these processes were run under computer control with a pi - algorithm capable of recognizing pulses .",
    "this system deals with flux quantum losses in the squid by not responding to large ( @xmath40 ) jumps in squid baseline if they occur very quickly , namely in one sampling period .    to take care of the very rare instances when a true temperature jump has taken place in a short time",
    ", a second independent control loop provides for long term stability by checking for deviations from the desired operating point , as follows .",
    "every two seconds , large heater pulses ( @xmath27 1.5 mev equivalent in phonon channels ) , which partially saturate the detectors are injected .",
    "the energy of these pulses is large enough to drive the superconducting film near to the top of the transition , where it is almost normal - conducting .",
    "the resulting squid output voltage will thus depend on how far the operating point was from the top of the transition and a possible shift of the operating point can be recognized and corrected .",
    "hence for each thermometer there is effectively a temperature standard given by the response of the film to a large heater pulse .",
    "the few short periods with noticeable deviations from the operating point are cut from the data . in table",
    "[ tab : times ] this is called the `` stability cut '' .    the heater used for temperature regulation",
    "is also used to inject the periodic heater test pulses monitoring the long term stability of the energy calibration and testing the trigger efficiency close to threshold .",
    "these heater pulses are produced by exponential voltage pulses from a pulser module , with the decay time adjusted to create detector pulses resembling true particle pulses .",
    "as previously remarked , the voltage for regulating the temperature and the heater test pulses are added and passed through an analog square - root circuit to obtain a linear dependence of the injected heater energy vs. the amplitude of the pulser voltage .",
    "the test pulses have a number of discrete energies spanning the energy range of interest and were sent every 30s during both dark matter and calibration runs .",
    "[ fig - ch4_stability ] shows the stability of the light detector be 13 during the entire dark matter run .",
    "the energy corresponding to a pulse is determined by the pulse height .",
    "this in turn is found by a template fit procedure .",
    "for each detector a template is made by averaging many measured pulses of a given type , i.e. test pulses or pulses from 122  kev @xmath14 s from the calibration source in the case of the cawo@xmath0 phonon detector .",
    "the pulse height of a given signal is then found by fitting the template with an amplitude scale factor , base line and onset time as free fit parameters .",
    "the amplitude scale factor then yields the pulse height .",
    "finally , a calibration translates the pulse height into an energy .",
    "the cawo@xmath0 phonon detector , providing the energy of an event , is calibrated with an external source to give an absolute energy determination . a @xmath41co source ( 122  kev and 136  kev @xmath14 lines )",
    "is inserted into the shielding via a removable plug , illuminating the detector modules from below .",
    "comparison of the pulse heights of the 122  kev photons with heater pulses of similar energy provides an absolute calibration for the voltage of the heater pulses in terms of an equivalent @xmath14 energy . the calibration is transferred to the lower energies needed for the wimp analysis by means of the heater test pulses .    the accuracy of the energy calibration from 10 to 40  kev , as relevant for the wimp search , is in the range of a few percent .",
    "this can be inferred from a peak at 47.1  kev shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - daisy - pb210 ] , which appeared in the energy spectrum of the phonon channel during the dark matter run with a rate of ( 3.2 @xmath42 0.5 ) counts / day .",
    "if we associate this peak with the 46.54  kev @xmath14 s from an external @xmath43pb contamination , the calibration with the heater pulses puts it 1.2% too high .",
    "this accuracy of the calibration is consistent with the accuracy of about 1% of the analog square - root circuit used to inject the heater pulses .",
    "the tendency to slightly overestimate the energy of the events will put our dark matter limits on the conservative side .",
    "the width of the 47  kev peak is 1.0  kev ( fwhm ) , identical with that for the heater pulses .",
    "this good resolution over 53 days again confirms the stability of the response during the dark matter run .    for small deposited energies",
    "the temperature rise is considerably smaller than the width of the film s superconducting transition and so we obtain an approximately linear relation between pulse amplitude and energy up to at least 170  kev in all detector channels . to deal with larger pulses",
    "we have developed an new method where we exclude that part of the pulse where non - linearity sets in , and then perform the fit on the thus truncated pulse .",
    "essentially , this means that large pulse heights are determined by the duration of the signal .",
    "we find this method quite effective and that the pulse heights obtained from such a truncated fit are approximately linear in energy up to several mev .",
    "[ fig - th - calibration ] shows results obtained with a @xmath44th calibration source .",
    "the pulse height obtained from the truncated fit procedure is plotted as a function of @xmath14 energy for a number of @xmath14 peaks of known energy .",
    "the straight line connecting the highest point with the origin serves to visualize the good linearity .",
    "a refined variant of the truncated fit method was applied for a detailed study of the @xmath19 background of the detectors .",
    "these results are presented in a separate paper @xcite , where the @xmath19 decay of @xmath45w is definitively established for the first time .",
    "we note that the low recoil energy data used in the present dark matter analysis do not involve this truncation procedure .",
    "the hardware threshold of the detectors was set to a recoil energy of about 5  kev , and 100% trigger efficiency was confirmed throughout the dark matter run by means of the lowest energy heater pulses , corresponding to 8.5  kev and 10  kev in the phonon channels for julia and daisy respectively .",
    "as mentioned , we obtain good energy resolution : @xmath46e = 1  kev ( fwhm ) for 46.5  kev @xmath14 rays and @xmath46e = 7  kev for 2.3  mev @xmath19 s .",
    "typical pulse shape parameters are @xmath47 = 1.1  ms for the rise time and @xmath48 = 15  ms for the fast decay time . at energies of a few tens of kev where the wimp signal is expected ,",
    "a background count rate of @xmath27 6 electron / photon events / ( kg kev day ) , before rejection by the light signal , is obtained .",
    "the calibration of the light detectors follows the same procedure .",
    "however , since we are not concerned with an absolute energy determination , the calibration is provided by the light output of the main detector with incident 122 kev @xmath14 s . thus the pulse height produced in the light detector with 122  kev photons incident on the main detector",
    "is assigned the nominal value ( `` electron equivalents -ee '' ) of 122  kev .",
    "given this normalization , the response of the light detector thermometer may then be linearized by using the heater pulses applied to the thermometer , the heater pulses being adjusted to deposit known fractions of the energy necessary to give the 122  kev pulse height .",
    "there remains the question of a possible non - linear relation between the energy deposit in the main detector and its light output , as is commonly observed in scintillators .",
    "this deviation from linearity would show up as a curvature of the @xmath14 band in fig .",
    "[ fig - daisy_2d ]",
    ". however , no curvature is evident .",
    "more quantitatively , for the daisy / be13 module , the light output with 10 kev and 40 kev in the main detector is 3.8  % and 2.8  % below the expectation from the above procedure of normalizing at 122  kev and linearizing with the heater pulses .",
    "for the module julia / be14 , which has a somewhat poorer light resolution , these numbers are 9.4  % and 6.7  % .      the energy resolution of the light channel plays an important role in the analysis .",
    "it reflects not only the performance of the thermometer system but also fluctuations in light production and collection . in fig .",
    "[ fig - daisy_2d ] a scatter plot with energy in the light channel vs. energy in the phonon channel over a wide energy range from daisy / be13 in the dark matter run is shown .",
    "besides the continuous @xmath14 band a series of discrete @xmath19 lines is visible in a band with lower light yield .",
    "these @xmath19 peaks are identified and discussed in detail in @xcite .",
    "an increasing width with energy of the @xmath14 band , is seen in fig .",
    "[ fig - daisy_2d ] , arising from an almost linear energy dependence of the light channel resolution .",
    "this may result from a slight dependence of the light output with respect to the position of the energy deposition within the cawo@xmath0 crystal .",
    "therefore we use data from the @xmath44th calibration to extract the energy dependence of the resolution , since in these data the low energy continuum originates from compton scattered high energy @xmath14 s , which interact uniformly in the volume of the crystal and so are spatially distributed as expected for neutron or wimp - induced events . the resolution in the light channel for this thorium data",
    "was modeled by a power series @xmath49 for energies between zero and 300kev , yielding the coefficients listed in table [ tab : light - resolution ] .",
    "we observe that be13 has the better resolution at low energy as indicated by the smaller value of @xmath50 .",
    "the electronic noise of the better light detector and hence its energy resolution when extrapolated to zero energy , is about 2kev ( fwhm ) , slighly worse than the energy resolution of 1.5kev ( fwhm ) for the heater pulses .",
    "this compares favorably with photomultipliers , which reach about the same performance with the best scintillating crystals of nai(tl ) .",

    "the points with negative energy arise in the pulse fitting procedure when a negative amplitude results for small pulses close to the noise .",
    "the determination of a nuclear recoil acceptance region in the phonon - light plane is based on a knowledge of the quenching factor . for this calculation",
    "we use the quenching factor @xmath51=7.4 , as discussed in section  [ sect : qf ] .",
    "as mentioned there , somewhat higher values have been obtained in other measurements , but using the smaller value of @xmath51=7.4 will put our dark matter limits on the conservative side . using this quenching factor and assuming gaussian fluctuations parameterized with the energy resolution of the light and phonon channels , we obtain the dashed lines on the plots of fig .",
    "[ fig - ratio_12_34 ] .",
    "the upper dashed line gives the boundary below which 90% of the nuclear recoils are expected .",
    "we also show the boundary below which 10% of the recoils for @xmath52 are expected .",
    "this is indicated by the lower dashed lines .",
    "since @xmath52 refers to incident neutrons , the area between the 90% and 10% lines will give an impression of where the neutron background is expected to lie .",
    "this 10% line does not enter into the calculation of the wimp limits themselves , however .",
    "since these calculations used the light channel resolutions from table [ tab : light - resolution ] , determined with photons on the cawo@xmath0 detector , they also involve the assumption that the resolution of the light channel does not depend on how the energy was deposited .",
    "we can check this assumption by comparing the light channel resolution in the two bands of fig .",
    "[ fig - daisy_2d ] at the same value of the light output .",
    "if we do this at the nominal light output of 484kev@xmath53 , corresponding to the @xmath19 line at 2.31 mev , we find @xmath54kev in the @xmath19 band and @xmath55kev in the electron / photon band ; so within errors the resolutions are consistent .",
    "finally , an analysis threshold of 12  kev was chosen in order to stay well above the energy where electron and nuclear recoil bands intersect .",
    "the upper energy for the analysis was chosen to be 40  kev , since due to the suppression of higher energy recoils by form factor effects , more than 95% of all wimp induced tungsten recoils are expected below this energy for any wimp mass .",

[ rate ] represents simply the statistical error . to check on systematic effects due to the uncertainty of the quenching factor we find upon varying @xmath51 that the number of recoils below the 90  % acceptance line for daisy / be13 remains the same 7 counts for quenching factors in the range from 6.7 to 11.1 . for julia / be14",
    "the result is stable for quenching factors from 6 to 9.3 .",
    "higher values of @xmath51 will of course lead to stronger limits .",
    "we note that most of these events lie between the 90% and 10% curves for @xmath52 and so are in the region expected for neutron - induced recoils .",
    "furthermore , monte carlo simulations for our setup without neutron shielding @xcite yield an estimate for the neutron background of about 0.6 events/(kg day ) for 12  kev @xmath59 40  kev , in reasonable agreement with eq .",

    "double scattering events are possible for neutrons , but none of these 16 events involved coincidences between the two detector modules . however this may be understood as due to the fact that the detectors were mounted at a relatively large separation , with about 10  cm between centers .",
    "we estimate that if the 16 events were all neutron events there should be less than 0.1 double scatters , consistent with the observation of none .",
    "( many double comptons are of course seen in the electron / photon band . )",
    "if we now nevertheless ignore the neutron background and attribute all 16 events to wimp interactions , we can set a conservative upper limit for the wimp scattering cross section .",
    "we calculate such a limit for coherent ( `` spin independent '' ) interactions , assuming a standard halo model ( isothermal halo , wimp characteristic velocity : 220 km / s , mean earth velocity : 232 km / s , local wimp density : 0.3 gev / c@xmath17/@xmath11 ) .",
    "the helm spin - independent form factor is used for the nucleus @xcite with the parameterization suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite and a@xmath17 scaling for coherence . the full line in fig .",
    "[ fig - exclusion ] shows this limit calculated with the optimum interval method of ref .",
    "@xcite , together with the dama ( 1 - 4 ) 3 @xmath60 signal region  @xcite and exclusion limits from edelweiss @xcite and cdms @xcite .",
    "essentially identical results are obtained when using the data of each module separately .      in the above discussion",
    "we simply imposed a global limit on the light yield to identify nuclear recoils .",
    "further important improvements in our technique are to be anticipated if it were possible to use the information from the phonon - light output to identify which particular nucleus is recoiling . for neutrons in this",
    "recoil energy range our monte carlo simulation shows that the dominant scattering in the cawo@xmath0 is on the oxygen , with less than 5% of the nuclear recoils due to tungsten . hence the @xmath51 value derived from the neutron scattering experiments",
    "is essentially determined by oxygen recoils . on the other hand for coherently interacting wimps the scattering",
    "is dominated by the tungsten , and a much higher value of @xmath51 applies .",
    "as discused in section  [ sect : qf ] we shall adopt @xmath51 = 40 for tungsten . with this value",
    "we expect 90% of the tungsten recoils to be below the full lines in fig .",
    "[ fig - ratio_12_34 ] .",
    "one of the two modules ( bottom in fig .",
    "[ fig - ratio_12_34 ] ) has no recoil events below this full line in the energy range from 12 to 40  kev , while the other module has 3 events .",
    "this difference between the two modules corresponds to the better resolution in the light channel for the module with no events .",
    "the better resolution will inhibit `` leakage '' of neutron - induced recoils into the region of the tungsten events .",
    "this may occur , for example , when a statistical fluctuation in the light channel produces a low light value for a neutron - induced recoil .",
    "we can check the plausibility of this explanation with an estimate of the `` leakage '' : using the resolutions determined for the light channel and gaussian fluctuations we calculate the probability , for each event in the neutron band , that it would have appeared below the tungsten line .",
    "this procedure leads to the following estimate for the  leakage \" : for the module daisy / be13 , 1.1 events ; and for the module julia / be14 , 3.6 events .",
    "most of this leakage occurs at the lower energies where the tungsten acceptance line ( solid line ) lies above the 10% boundary for the neutron recoils .",
    "if we were to move the analysis threshold from 12 to 25  kev the leakage would become much smaller , 0.092 and 0.62 events , respectively .",
    "`` leakage '' thus does appear to give a plausible explanation for the difference in the behavior of the two modules .",
    "we now use the better module daisy / be13 , where there are no tungsten events , to set a wimp limit .",
    "we obtain the thick dashed line in fig .",
    "[ fig - exclusion ] . to check systematic effects due to choice of the acceptance region we can lower the threshold to 10  kev to include the two events at 10.5  kev and 11.3  kev below the tungsten line for daisy / be13 in fig .",
    "[ fig - ratio_12_34 ] .",
    "this leads to essentially the same curve on the exclusion plot and confirms the stability of the results against a variation of the analysis threshold .    as a second check on systematics we can lower the quenching factor for tungsten  that is",
    "weaken the rejection power of the light channel . the number of events below the solid curve in fig .",
    "[ fig - ratio_12_34 ] ( daisy ) remains at zero for quenching factors down to @xmath51 = 35.8 , where an event at 22.2 kev enters .",
    "this single event would move the minimum of the exclusion curve from 1.6@xmath2110@xmath61  pb to 2.3@xmath2110@xmath61  pb .",
    "the result is then stable until @xmath51=23.4 , where a second event at 13.5 kev enters .",
    "this would move the minimum of the exclusion curve to 3.8@xmath2110@xmath61 pb . this confirms the stability of the results at about @xmath62  pb against uncertainties in the value of @xmath51 for tungsten .    at a wimp mass of 60  gev / c@xmath17 these tungsten limits , obtained without neutron shielding ,",
    "are identical to the limits set by edelweiss @xcite also assuming coherent interactions .",
    "recent results from cdms at the soudan underground laboratory @xcite have improved these limits by a further factor of four .",
    "the present results were obtained without a neutron shield and the wimp sensitivity appears to be limited by the neutron background when all nuclear recoil events in the cawo@xmath0 are naively attributed to wimp interactions .",
    "however , we expect that the background neutrons , scattering predominantly on the light elements of the detector , lead to events distinguishable by light yield from coherently scattering wimps , which scatter predominantly on the tungsten . thus if we exploit the high quenching factor for tungsten , the tungsten recoils can be separated . on this basis",
    "we have no tungsten recoils for the better of the two modules in the acceptance range of 12 to 40  kev . for the efficiency of this separation , the resolution of the light channel is crucial and the difference in the behavior of the two modules can be traced to different resolutions in the light channel .",
    "we observe that the coherent scattering hypothesis enters doubly in our analysis .",
    "once , as for all types of detectors , in enhancing the rate on a heavy nucleus , given a certain wimp - nucleon cross section .",
    "but secondly in a manner particular to the present method in that it leads to distinctly different anticipated light yields for neutron background and wimp - induced recoils .",
    "finally , we note that the method of identifying the recoil nucleus by the location of the signal in the phonon - light plane seems very promising , not only for the suppression of background but also for the verification of a possible positive wimp signal  @xcite and for unraveling the quantum numbers of a wimp candidate  @xcite . to this end further study of quenching factors and improvement of the light detectors",
    "are being actively pursued .",
