    "the problem of strong electron correlation is one of the most challenging problems in condensed matter physics .",
    "it is interesting because many materials with important properties for applications derive those properties from the delicate balance between minimizing the kinetic and the potential energies in strongly correlated materials .",
    "most theoretical work on this problem has focused on equilibrium properties and linear response , with only limited work available on the nonequilibrium system ( which is most easily attained when driven by an external electric field ) .",
    "two commonly studied models of strong electron correlation are the hubbard model@xcite and the falicov - kimball model@xcite ( equivalent to the hubbard model with zero hopping parameter for the down spin electrons ) . despite tremendous efforts , the exact equilibrium solution of these models",
    "is known only in some limiting cases like one dimension , where the bethe anzatz technique@xcite can be successfully applied to the hubbard model , and in the infinite - dimensional case where both models can be solved@xcite with dynamical mean - field theory ( dmft ) .",
    "since the exact solution of these problems is challenging to attain , exact results in the form of sum rules can be quite valuable in determining the fidelity of different approximation techniques ( be they analytic , variational , perturbative , or numerical approximations ) .",
    "this problem was analyzed in equilibrium for the hubbard model by steve white@xcite and used to check the accuracy of a quantum monte carlo solution to the two - dimensional hubbard model .",
    "can similar results be found for nonequilibrium situations , like the case of a strongly correlated material in an uniform external electric field ( with arbitrary time dependence ) ?",
    "the answer to this question has , surprisingly , not been discussed much in the literature .",
    "it is well known that the canonical anticommutation relation for fermion creation and annihilation operators leads to the integral of the spectral function being 1 in both equilibrium and nonequilibrium situations .",
    "it is also well known that the conventional proof that the spectral function is nonnegative in equilibrium ( arising from a lehmann representation ) , does not apply to the nonequilibrium case , so the spectral function can be negative .",
    "it is also known that in the limit of a steady state , the spectral function recovers its nonnegativity . in this work ,",
    "we examine the theoretical problem of the first few moments of the spectral functions in the presence of an external electric field .",
    "it turns out that the equilibrium results for the first few moments are quite similar to the nonequilibrium results , implying they can be used effectively to determine the accuracy of different approximation techniques in solving nonequilibrium problems .",
    "dynamical mean - field theory has been employed to solve many of the models of strongly correlated electrons . to date , most of this work has focused on equilibrium properties .",
    "schmidt and monien@xcite , made a first attempt to solve nonequilibrium dmft via second - order perturbation theory for the hubbard model .",
    "their theoretical formulation evaluated the case of a spatially uniform , but time dependent scalar potential , which unfortunately does not correspond to any electric field .",
    "more recently , a generalization of the brandt - urbanek solution@xcite for the localized electron spectral function allows for an exact numerical solution of the nonequilibrium problem for the falicov - kimball model@xcite within the dmft framework .",
    "the procedure works directly in time by discretizing the continuous matrix operators and solving the nonlinear equations by iterating matrix operations on the discretized operators .",
    "the approach has been tested against the equilibrium solution@xcite , and nonequilibrium results for the quenching of bloch oscillations will be presented elsewhere .    in this contribution , we derive operator identities for the first two spectral moments of the nonequilibrium green s functions when the strongly correlated material is in the presence of a spatially uniform electric field with arbitrary time dependence .",
    "these identities are found for both the falicov - kimball and the hubbard model .",
    "our results are valid for any spatial dimensionality . in the general case ,",
    "the moments depend on time , which is expected because the field can be turned on at any time ; surprisingly , the first two moments of the local retarded green s function are time independent , and have the same form as in equilibrium .",
    "this last result is particularly surprising because the local retarded green s function is a nontrivial oscillating function of time in the noninteracting case@xcite .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we derive analytical expressions for the spectral moments for the falicov - kimball model and the hubbard model in section ii .",
    "the application of nonequilibrium dmft to the falicov - kimball model follows in section iii .",
    "section iv contains results for the green s functions and spectral moments in this case .",
    "a summary of our results and our conclusions appear in section v.",
    "we begin our formal developments with a derivation of exact expressions for the zeroth , first and second spectral moments of the retarded and lesser green s functions ; the analysis is performed for the spinless falicov - kimball model and the spin one - half hubbard model in an external arbitrary time - dependent spatially uniform electric field .",
