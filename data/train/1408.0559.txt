    "random @xmath0-regular graph , a random graph obtained by sampling uniformly a @xmath0-regular vertex labeled simple graph on @xmath1 vertices ( for even @xmath2 ) , is an important random graph model . while for @xmath3",
    "the resulting graph is a union of disjoint cycles ( and in particular disconnected with high probability ) , for @xmath4 the random regular graph , with probability converging to 1 ( as @xmath5 ) is connected , and even has hamiltonian cycles .",
    "furthermore , for @xmath4 it looks fundamentally different from a @xmath0-dimensional torus , in particular it is an expander , locally tree - like and has bounded number of cycles of fixed length ( for more properties , proofs and references to the original work see @xcite ) .",
    "one of the main tools used for both generating and studying random regular graphs is the configuration model introduced by bollobs in @xcite .",
    "this is an algorithm which can be described as follows .",
    "start with @xmath1 disconnected labeled vertices each equipped with @xmath0 half - edges . select an arbitrary vertex and mark it and it s half - edges as active , and label all other vertices and half - edges as inactive . at each stage of the algorithm",
    "choose in some way a labeled half - edge @xmath6 and connect it with a uniformly selected half - edge @xmath7 ( active or not ) , and mark them both as used .",
    "if @xmath7 corresponds to an inactive vertex , also label this vertex and all its half - edges ( except @xmath7 ) as active .",
    "when all half - edges are connected , collapse the connected half - edges to edges .",
    "the algorithm generates a random graph which might not be simple if two half - edges incident to the same vertex get connected , or there are two connections of half - edges incident to the same pair of vertices",
    ". however , conditioned on the event that the random graph is simple , it has the distribution of the random regular graph .",
    "moreover , the probability that the graph produced by the configuration model is simple , is bounded away from zero as @xmath5 and @xmath0 is fixed ( see @xcite , and an earlier related work @xcite ) .",
    "denote by @xmath8 and @xmath9 the number of active and inactive half - edges after the @xmath1-th step respectively ( the number of used half - edges is clearly @xmath10 ) .",
    "then it is easy to see that when @xmath11 , @xmath12 @xmath13 and @xmath14 therefore the process @xmath15 is an urn model with the replacement matrix @xmath16 in the present paper we will give precise estimates on the behavior of the process @xmath17 .",
    "the results will be indispensable for the analysis of a competing multi - type version of a first passage percolation process on random regular graphs performed in @xcite . to analyze the process @xmath17",
    "we will consider a more general urn model with the replacement matrix @xmath18 for real valued @xmath19 .",
    "the corresponding urn process @xmath20 ( which has the same distribution as @xmath15 for @xmath21 and @xmath22 ) is a markov chain with the transition probabilities @xmath23 the process stops at a random time @xmath24 defined as the first time @xmath1 such that @xmath25 or @xmath26 or @xmath27 , where @xmath28 ( @xmath29 , @xmath30 for @xmath31 ) .",
    "observe that @xmath24 is a stopping time with respect to the natural filtration @xmath32 induced by the outcomes of the first @xmath1 draws .",
    "when @xmath33 and @xmath34 are integers it can be described as follows .",
    "start with @xmath35 blue and @xmath36 red balls in an urn .",
    "draw a ball from the urn uniformly at random .",
    "if the drawn ball is blue return it into the urn and then add @xmath37 red balls into the urn and remove @xmath34 blue balls .",
    "if the drawn ball is red return it into the urn and remove @xmath33 red balls from the urn .",
    "stop when the urn contains no more balls , or when the number of balls of some type in the urn becomes `` negative '' .",
    "then @xmath38 and @xmath39 stand for the number of blue and red balls in the urn after @xmath1 draws . in the discussion that follows we will use `` the ball terminology '' even when dealing with non - integer values of @xmath33 and @xmath34 .    since the number of blue balls @xmath38 can decrease only by @xmath34",
    ", we will always assume that @xmath35 is a multiple of @xmath34 ( this in particular holds in the configuration model where @xmath40 is divisible by @xmath0 ) .",
    "having this assumption , the value of @xmath38 can not become negative , and then @xmath24 is the smallest integer @xmath1 such that either @xmath26 or @xmath41 . observe that at each step the sum @xmath42 decreases by @xmath33 ( we remove exactly @xmath33 balls ) , that is @xmath43 , so a natural assumption could be that @xmath44 is a multiple of @xmath33 .",
    "however , as corollary [ cor : estimates_on_stopping ] shows with probability converging to 1 ( as @xmath45 and @xmath33 and @xmath34 stay fixed ) blue balls indeed get exhausted before the red ones , after which the process is deterministic and consists of removing the leftover red balls . therefore , with probability converging to 1 we have @xmath46 and then the assumption that @xmath47 is a multiple of @xmath33 only affects the final number of balls @xmath48 by being either equal to zero or negative . for these reasons we will not assume that @xmath47 is a multiple of @xmath33 .",
    "the configuration model does not satisfy the assumption that @xmath49 is a multiple of @xmath21 anyway .",
    "furthermore , the discussion above shows that the process is most interesting when the initial number of blue balls @xmath35 is large .    using the notation and terminology described above we state our results . our first result concerns with the number of blue balls in the urn .",
    "it provides estimates on the time when the blue balls are exhausted , as well as the number of balls except shortly before the exhaustion time .",
    "in particular it shows that blue blue balls get exhausted when the number of leftover red balls is @xmath50 .",
    "furthermore , as long as the number of blue balls @xmath38 is large , it behaves as @xmath51 . in the rest of the paper",
