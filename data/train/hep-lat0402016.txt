    "major experimental efforts are currently aimed at determining the possible existence of exotic mesons ; mesons having quantum numbers that can not be carried by the minimal fock space component of a quark - antiquark pair . of particular mention",
    "is the proposed program of the gluex collaboration associated with the forthcoming upgrade of the jefferson laboratory facility .",
    "the observation of exotic states and the determination of their properties would elucidate aspects of qcd which are relatively unexplored .",
    "the quantum numbers @xmath1 etc . can not be carried by a quark - antiquark pair in a ground - state @xmath2-wave .",
    "lattice qcd calculations exploring the non - trivial role of explicit gluon degrees of freedom in carrying the quantum numbers of the meson suggest that exotic meson states do indeed exist and have a mass the order of 2  gev @xcite .",
    "these findings are further supported here .",
    "operators carrying exotic quantum numbers can be constructed by merging standard local interpolating fields @xmath3 with chromo - electric , @xmath4 , or chromo - magnetic fields , @xmath5 .",
    "the @xmath6 quantum numbers of the interpolator are derived from the direct product of those associated with the quark bilinear and @xmath7 or @xmath8 .",
    "for example , combining the vector current of the @xmath9 meson with a chromo - magnetic field , @xmath10 provides @xmath11 with the @xmath12 : @xmath13 ( @xmath14 meson ) and the @xmath0 : @xmath15 ( * exotic * ) .",
    "we restrict ourselves to the lowest energy - dimension operators , as these provide better signal with smaller statistical errors .",
    "table [ interpolators ] summarizes the standard and hybrid interpolating fields explored herein .",
    "cccc @xmath16 & @xmath17 & @xmath12 & @xmath18 + @xmath19 & @xmath20 & @xmath21 & @xmath22 + @xmath23 & @xmath24 & @xmath25 + @xmath26 & & @xmath27 + @xmath28 & & @xmath29 + @xmath30 & @xmath31 & @xmath0 & @xmath32 + @xmath33 & @xmath34 & @xmath35 & @xmath36 + @xmath37 & @xmath38 & @xmath39 & @xmath40 + @xmath41 & @xmath42 & @xmath43 & @xmath44 + @xmath45 & @xmath46 & @xmath47 & @xmath48 +    the formulation of effective interpolating fields for the creation and annihilation of exotic meson states continues to be an active area of research .",
    "for example , one can generalize the structure of the interpolating fields further to include nonlocal components where link paths are incorporated to maintain gauge invariance and carry the nontrivial quantum numbers of the gluon fields . in this case , numerous quark propagators are required for each gauge field configuration rendering the approach computationally expensive .    here",
    "we consider local interpolating fields .",
    "gauge - invariant gaussian smearing @xcite is applied at the fermion source ( @xmath49 ) , and local sinks are used to maintain strong signal in the two - point correlation functions .",
    "chromo - electric and -magnetic fields are created from ape - smeared links @xcite at both the source and sink using the highly - improved @xmath50-improved lattice field strength tensor @xcite . in this study , the smearing fraction @xmath51 ( keeping 0.3 of the original link ) and the process of smearing and @xmath52 link projection is iterated four times @xcite .",
    "this amount of smearing is sufficient to provide a meaningful topological charge and appears to be suitable for the creation of exotic mesons . as such , the results presented here supersede an earlier presentation of hybrid meson masses @xcite .",
    "propagators are generated using the fat - link irrelevant clover ( flic ) fermion action @xcite where the irrelevant wilson and clover operators of the fermion action are constructed using fat links while the relevant operators use the untouched ( thin ) gauge links .",
    "flic fermions provide a new form of nonperturbative @xmath53 improvement @xcite where near - continuum results are obtained at finite lattice spacing .",
    "access to the light quark mass regime is enabled by the improved chiral properties of the lattice fermion action @xcite .",
    "excited states are extracted using a variational technique , corresponding to a construction of optimal linear combinations of the original operators . for the sake of completeness , we shall discuss this here , in direct analogy to the procedure described in @xcite .",
    "consider the momentum - space meson two - point function for @xmath54 , @xmath55 where the @xmath56 are a complete set of hadronic states .",
    "@xmath57 we can make use of translational invariance to write this as @xmath58 it is convenient in the following discussion to label the states which have the @xmath59 interpolating field quantum numbers as @xmath60 for @xmath61 .",
    "in general the number of states , @xmath62 , in this tower of excited states may be infinite , but we will only ever need to consider a finite set of the lowest such states here . after selecting zero momentum , @xmath63 , @xmath64 where @xmath65 and @xmath66 are coefficients denoting the couplings of the interpolating fields @xmath67 and @xmath68 , respectively , to the state @xmath69 .",
    "if we use identical source and sink interpolating fields then it follows from the definition of the coupling strength that @xmath70 and from eq .",
    "( [ eqn : gijequation ] ) we see that @xmath71^*$ ] , i.e. , @xmath72 is a hermitian matrix .",
    "if , in addition , we use only real coefficients in the link products , then @xmath72 is a real symmetric matrix . for",
    "the correlation matrices that we construct we have real link coefficients but we use smeared sources and point sinks and so in our calculations @xmath72 is a real but non - symmetric matrix . since @xmath72 is a real matrix for the infinite number of possible choices of interpolating fields with real coefficients , then we can take @xmath65 and @xmath66 to be real coefficients here without loss of generality . in constructing correlation functions ,",
    "we effectively average over @xmath73 and @xmath74 configurations to ensure @xmath65 is purely real , even on a finite ensemble of gauge field configurations @xcite .",
    "now , let us consider the ideal case where we have @xmath62 interpolating fields with the same quantum numbers , but which give rise to @xmath62 linearly independent states when acting on the vacuum .",
    "in this case we can construct @xmath62 ideal interpolating source and sink fields which perfectly isolate the @xmath62 individual hadron states @xmath75 , i.e. , @xmath76 [ lincomif ] such that @xmath77 where @xmath78 and @xmath79 are the coupling strengths of @xmath80 and @xmath81 to the state @xmath75 .",

    "( [ lincomif ] ) may differ when the source and sink have different smearing prescriptions , again indicated by the differentiation between @xmath78 and @xmath79 ( recall @xmath84 is real ) .",
    "for notational convenience for the remainder of this discussion repeated indices @xmath85 are to be understood as being summed over , whereas @xmath86 denoting a particular state is not . at @xmath87",
    ", it follows that , @xmath88 the @xmath89-dependence in this expression is purely in the exponential term , leading to the recurrence relationship @xmath90 which can be rewritten as @xmath91_{ki}^{-1 } g_{ij } ( t ) \\ ,",

    "( [ phiexpressiona ] ) and ( [ phiexpressionb ] ) imply @xmath98 indicating the eigenvectors may be used to construct a correlation function in which a single state mass @xmath99is isolated and which can be analyzed using the methods of section  ii .",

    "( [ preprojection ] ) and ( [ projection ] ) leads us to the result @xmath100 by extracting all @xmath101 such ratios , we can exactly recover all of the real couplings @xmath102 and @xmath103 of @xmath67 and @xmath68 respectively to the state @xmath75 .",
    "note that throughout this section no assumptions have been made about the symmetry properties of @xmath104 .",
    "this is essential due to our use of smeared sources and point sinks .    in practice",
    "we will only have a relatively small number , @xmath105 , of interpolating fields in any given analysis .",
    "these @xmath106 interpolators should be chosen to have good overlap with the lowest @xmath106 excited states in the tower and we should attempt to study the ratios in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : ratios ] ) at early to intermediate euclidean times , where the contribution of the @xmath107 higher mass states will be suppressed but where there is still sufficient signal to allow the lowest @xmath106 states to be seen .",
    "this procedure will lead to an estimate for the masses of each of the lowest @xmath106 states in the tower of excited states .",
    "of these @xmath106 predicted masses , the highest will in general have the largest systematic error while the lower masses will be the most reliably determined . repeating the analysis with varying @xmath106 and different combinations of interpolating fields will give an objective measure of the reliability of the extraction of these masses .",
    "in our case of a modest @xmath108 correlation matrix ( @xmath109 ) we take a cautious approach to the selection of the eigenvalue analysis time .",
    "as already explained , we perform the eigenvalue analysis at an early to moderate euclidean time where statistical noise is suppressed and yet contributions from at least the lowest two mass states is still present .",
    "one must exercise caution in performing the analysis at too early a time , as more than the desired @xmath109 states may be contributing to the @xmath110 matrix of correlation functions .",
