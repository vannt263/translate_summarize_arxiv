    "the standard thin accretion disc ( @xcite ) has been extensively applied to a variety of astrophysical systems , such as active galactic nuclei , x - ray binaries , and cataclysmic variable stars .",
    "the theory of the standard thin disc , which is based on the @xmath0 stress prescription , predicts that the disc will suffer both thermal and viscous instability when the pressure is dominated by radiation pressure .",
    "however , observations of x - ray binaries show little evidence for such instabilities except for grs 1915 + 105 ( hereafter grs 1915 ) . since the stability is related to the description of stress , the standard @xmath0 stress prescription was modified in some previous works to assure the disc to be stable no matter whether gas or radiation pressure dominates .",
    "for instance , @xcite introduced a so - called @xmath1 stress prescription , i.e. , the stress is proportional to the gas pressure rather than the sum of the gas and radiation pressure . with the @xmath1 stress ,",
    "the disc will remain stable even for the case that radiation pressure dominates over gas pressure .",
    "furthermore , some other stress prescriptions were introduced by assuming that the stress is relevant to both the total pressure and the gas pressure ( e.g. , @xcite , p.  108 ) . as pointed out by @xcite ,",
    "however , the @xmath1 stress would be in conflict with observations as follows .",
    "observations show that the colour temperature correction remains stable for a wide range of luminosity , whereas discs with @xmath1 stress should have a colour temperature correction that changes from @xmath2 to @xmath3 as the accretion rate increases .",
    "conversely , the standard @xmath0 prescription may predict that the correction should remain stable at @xmath2 for varying accretion rates .",
    "moreover , some recent simulations ( e.g. , @xcite ) showed that the stress is roughly proportional to the sum of gas and radiation pressure .",
    "thus , the standard @xmath0 prescription seems to be more acceptable than other prescriptions such as the @xmath1 stress .",
    "the slim disc model was introduced by @xcite , in which it was predicted that the thermal instability of the radiation - pressure - dominated thin disc will trigger a limit cycle behaviour between the thin disc and the slim disc .",
    "such a limit cycle was confirmed by time - dependent numerical calculations ( e.g. , szuszkiewicz & miller 2001 ; @xcite ) . on the other hand",
    ", @xcite applied the limit cycle theory to interpret the observational quasi - periodic variability of grs 1915 . recently",
    ", such limit cycle has also been applied to young radio galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ) . comparing the numerical results with the observational ones ,",
    "however , we can find the following inconsistency between the theory and the observation .",
    "the numerical results of li et al .",
    "( 2007 ) showed that the duration of the outburst phase @xmath4 is less than 5 percent of the duration of the quiescent phase @xmath5 , and the luminosity of the outburst phase @xmath6 is around two orders of magnitude larger than that of the quiescent phase @xmath7 ; whereas observations of grs 1915 showed that , @xmath4 is comparable to @xmath5 and @xmath6 is only 3 - 20 times larger than @xmath7 ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "some efforts have been made to improve the theory in order to explain observations either by some artifical viscosity prescription ( e.g. , @xcite ) or by additional assumption of the energy exchange between the disc and corona ( janiuk et al .",
    "2002 ) .    in the present paper",
    ", we will investigate this issue through another way by taking the stress evolution process into account .",
    "our paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    ", we describe the basic assumption for the stress evolution process .",
    "the time - dependent equations and linear stability analysis are presented in sections 3 and 4 , respectively .",
    "conclusions and discussion are made in section 5 .",
    "the stress in mhd accretion discs can be expressed as ( e.g. , balbus & papaloizou 1999 ) @xmath8 where @xmath9(@xmath10 ) and @xmath11(@xmath12 ) are the fluctuating components of the velocity ( the magnetic field ) in @xmath13 and @xmath14 direction , respectively .",
    "the angled bracket notation denotes the azimuthal average .",
    "the above formula is a general form and is complicated for calculation . in the study of accretion discs , a more practical formula , i.e.",
    ", the @xmath0 stress prescription ( @xcite ) , is widely adopted : @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the total pressure , and @xmath0 is regarded as a constant less than unity . with the above simple form , the @xmath0 stress prescription has been extensively applied to the research of accretion discs , even in the disc stability analysis .",
    "but in the real system , when the pressure varies , it will take a certain period for the stress to adjust . as mentioned in   1",
    ", the stability is sensitive to the description of stress , thus the stress evolution process may have essential effects on the stability . in this paper , we will modify the standard @xmath0 stress prescription by taking the stress delay into account .",
    "generally , the growth rate of the stress should be related to @xmath17 and @xmath18 , where @xmath17 is the expected stress and @xmath18 is the current stress .",
    "thus we have the following general function for the evolution of stress : @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the radial velocity . in a quasi - stationary state",
    ", the function @xmath21 should match the following conditions : @xmath22 in the present paper , we adopt a simple form as follows : @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the timescale of stress delay for varying pressure .",
    "we further adopt @xmath25 according to the @xmath0 prescription , where @xmath0 is a constant . combining equations ( 3 ) and ( 5 ) ,",
    "the evolution equation of the stress tensor is @xmath26",
    "we first present the time - dependent equations of accretion discs for stability analysis .",
    "we consider an axisymmetric , keplerian rotating disc ( @xmath27 ) under cylindrical coordinates ( @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath28 ) .",
    "the basic vertically integrated equations are described as follows ( e.g. , kato et al .  2008 ) :",
    "@xmath30 @xmath31 @xmath32 @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the surface mass density , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , and @xmath37 are the vertically integrated pressure , stress , and internal energy , respectively .",
    "@xmath38 is the temperature , @xmath39 is the half - thickness of the disc , @xmath40 is boltzmann constant , @xmath41 is the mean molecular weight , @xmath42 is the hydrogen mass , and @xmath43 is radiation constant .",
    "the quantities @xmath44 , @xmath45 , and @xmath46 represent the viscous heating , advective cooling , and radiative cooling rates , respectively .",
    "the expressions of @xmath37 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 , and @xmath46 are the following : @xmath47 \\pi \\ , \\ ] ] @xmath48 @xmath49 \\ , \\ ] ] @xmath50 where @xmath1 is defined as the ratio of the gas pressure to the total pressure , i.e. , @xmath51 , @xmath52 is the ratio of specific heating , and @xmath53 is the opacity .",
    "since the timescale for establishment of vertical equilibrium is the dynamic timescale , which is much shorter than the thermal timescale , we modify the stress evolution process ( eq .  [ 6 ] ) as @xmath54",
    "now we have the set of six equations , i.e. , eqs .",
    "( 7)-(12 ) for linear stability analysis , and the corresponding six physical quantities are @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath20 , @xmath39 , @xmath38 , and @xmath57 . with subscript 0 denoting the quasi - stationary solution , and subscript 1 denoting perturbation quantities , we define the following dimensionless variables : @xmath58 with the assumption that all the perturbation quantities are proportional to @xmath59 , the perturbed equations corresponding to eqs .",

    "( [ growthrate ] ) is reduced to @xmath103 the above growth rate is exactly the same as that in the @xmath0 stress case , in which the growing timescale of thermal instability is around @xmath95 .",
    "figure  2 shows the variation of the growth rate of the thermally unstable mode in the long - wavelength limit with @xmath24 for @xmath104 , 0.1 , and 0.3 .",
    "the figure clearly illustrates that , for the case of @xmath105 , the stress evolution process will have essential effects on the thermal instability since the growth rate is significantly decreased .",
    "in this paper , the stress evolution process , which was ignored in previous works , is taken into account in the linear stability analysis of standard thin accretion discs .",
    "we show the variation of the growth rate of thermally unstable modes with the wavelength of perturbations for two cases : with and without stress delay .",
    "we find that the growth rate with stress delay can be apparently lower than that without stress delay .",
    "we also make some analytical approximation for the growth rate in long - wavelength limit , and present the relationship between the specific growth rate and the timescale of stress delay . in conclusion , the stress evolution process may have essential influence on the thermal instability by significantly decreasing the growth rate , in particular for the case in which the timescale of stress delay is comparable to or even larger than the thermal timescale .    in a real system",
    "the timescale of stress delay remains unclear .",
    "we would argue that this timescale is possibly comparable to the thermal timescale as follows . in simulations with an initially weak toroidal or poloidal magnetic field",
    ", the magnetic energy may first experience an exponential growth during the first few orbits due to the linear instability , and then will be followed by the nonlinear evolution .",
    "finally , a saturated quasi - steady state phase may form . totally",
    ", it will take @xmath106 orbits for the system to enter a fully turbulent state ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "this implies that the evolution timescale of the magnetoturbulence is around @xmath106 times of the dynamical timescale @xmath107 , which can be regarded as a duration around the thermal timescale @xmath95 ( e.g. , @xmath108 and @xmath90 ) .",
    "as mentioned in the first section , when the theory of the limit cycle behaviour between the standard thin disc and the slim disc is applied to the observational quasi - periodic variability of grs 1915 , there exists some conflict between the theory and the observation on the duration ratio @xmath109 and the luminosity ratio @xmath110 . in our opinion",
    ", the stress evolution process may improve the theory to explain observations due to the following reasons .",
    "when the flow suffers thermal instability , the growth rate of @xmath111 can be significantly decreased by the stress delay .",
    "we therefore can expect a relatively lower @xmath111 for the outburst phase , thus a corresponding lower @xmath110 . as a consequence , for a certain fixed mass accretion rate supply at outer boundary ,",
    "if @xmath111 at outburst phase drops , the duration of this phase will therefore become longer , thus a moderate value of @xmath109 should appear .",
    "in other words , the influence of the stress delay on the growth rate may result in moderate ratios of duration and luminosity of the outburst phase to the quiescent one , which will be more likely to explain the observational results than previous calculations .",
    "the further investigation on this issue may require time - dependent numerical calculations including the stress evolution process .",
    "moreover , we would point out the possible application of the stress evolution process to another geometrically thin disc , namely the shapiro - lightman - eardley disc ( the sle disc , shapiro et al .  1976 ) , which was originally introduced as the inner region of a thin disc to provide hard x - ray emission .",
    "however , it is known that the sle disc is viscously stable but suffers thermal instability .",
    "if the stress evolution process is taken into consideration in the sle model , and the timescale of stress delay is comparable to the thermal timescale , we can therefore expect the existence of a quasi - stable sle disc since the decreased growth rate of thermal instability may not completely destroy the disc and the viscous stability may help to suppress the thermal instability in the viscous timescale .",
