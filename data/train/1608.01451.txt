    "many of the biological fluids in which these cells and organisms swim are non - newtonian , hence modelling swimming in such fluids is of interest .",
    "the present study is motivated by the fibrous nature of many biological media , for example the cervical mucus encountered by the spermatozoa of many internally - fertilising species and active suspensions of elongated cells . throughout the menstrual cycle , the rheology of cervical mucus changes due to hormonally - induced variations in hydration and associated changes in the glycofilament mucin structure . during ovulation",

    "@xcite initially extended the model to incorporate viscoelastic fluids ; it was found that the properties of the fluid leads to an increased steady swimming velocity for lower reynolds numbers .",
    "this problem was reconsidered more recently by @xcite , who deduced that the mean swimming velocity in a nonlinear viscoelastic fluid is reduced relative to that in a newtonian fluid , in certain cases the swimming direction is reversed @xcite , also see @xcite .",

    "<S> taylor s swimming sheet is a classical model of microscale propulsion and pumping . </S>",
    "<S> many biological fluids and substances are fibrous , having a preferred direction in their microstructure ; for example cervical mucus is formed of polymer molecules which create an oriented fibrous network . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , suspensions of elongated motile cells produce a form of active oriented matter . to understand how these effects modify viscous propulsion , we extend taylor s classical model of small - amplitude zero - reynolds - number propulsion of a ` swimming sheet ' via the transversely - isotropic fluid model of ericksen , which is linear in strain rate and possesses a distinguished direction . </S>",
    "<S> the energetic costs of swimming are significantly altered by all rheological parameters and the initial fibre angle . </S>",
    "<S> propulsion in a passive transversely - isotropic fluid produces an enhanced mean rate of working , independent of the initial fibre orientation , with an approximately linear dependence of energetic cost on the extensional and shear enhancements to the viscosity caused by fibres . in this regime </S>",
    "<S> the mean swimming velocity is unchanged from the newtonian case . </S>",
    "<S> the effect of the constant term in ericksen s model for the stress , which can be identified as a fibre tension or alternatively a stresslet characterising an active fluid , is also considered . </S>",
    "<S> this stress introduces an angular dependence and dramatically changes the streamlines and flow field ; fibres aligned with the swimming direction increase the energetic demands of the sheet . </S>",
    "<S> the constant fibre stress may result in a reversal of the mean swimming velocity and a negative mean rate of working if sufficiently large relative to the other rheological parameters . </S>"
