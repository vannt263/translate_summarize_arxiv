    "cataclysmic variables ( cvs ) are compact binaries in which a low - mass late type main - sequence star transfers matter to a white dwarf ( wd ) due to roche lobe overflow . magnetic cvs ( mcvs ) are systems in which the wd possesses a strong magnetic field that controls the dynamics of the accretion flow near the wd .",
    "mcvs are divided into two subclasses : am her systems ( i.e. , polars ) @xcite and dq her systems ( i.e. , intermediate polars ) @xcite . the typical magnetic field on the wd surface of polars and intermediate polars ranges from 5 - 100  mg and 0.1 - 10  mg , respectively .",
    "the wd spin of polars is synchronised with the orbital period , and the magnetic field prevents the formation of an accretion disc @xcite .",
    "the magnetic pressure overcomes the accretion flow pressure at the alfvn radius . in this so - called coupling region ,",
    "the flow from the secondary star leaves the ballistic trajectory and turns to a magnetically driven stream to the wd surface , thereby forming an accretion column .",
    "near the wd , the material reaches a supersonic velocity , and a shock front is formed .",
    "the region between the shock front and the wd surface is called the post - shock region @xcite . as a result of the shock , this region is hot , with temperatures greater than 10 kev .",
    "the region cools down via cyclotron and bremsstrahlung emissions , which dominate the optical and x - ray ranges , respectively .",
    "the cyclotron emission from the post - shock region accounts for the orbital variation of the optical flux and the polarisation of polars .",
    "recently , we developed a code to reproduce the optical emission of mcvs : cyclops @xcite .",
    "this code adopts a 3d - representation of the accretion column and wd , which allows us to study the complex physics and geometry of mcvs .",
    "this code calculates the cyclotron emission from inhomogeneous post - shock regions and the attenuation from the pre - shock region by considering the thomson scattering .",
    "@xcite briefly review previous models .",
    "the x - ray emission of polars is consistent with hot plasma emission @xcite .",
    "the raymond - smith and meka models @xcite can reproduce this emission .",
    "initially , the x - ray data of mcvs were modelled using a single temperature hot plasma continuum and gaussian profiles to represent the few iron emission lines observed in the spectra @xcite . however , the x - ray spectra of certain mcvs can not be fit with a single bremsstrahlung component , which indicates the presence of multi - temperature plasma in the post - shock region @xcite .",
    "the radiative cooling in the post - shock region generates the temperature structure @xcite .",
    "absorption is necessary to reproduce the spectral energy dependence of mcvs ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . on one hand , interstellar absorption in the 0.1 - 2  kev region with typical column densities of 1@xmath0@xmath1 is observed in the x - ray mcv spectra ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "moreover , an additional absorption variable in the orbital cycle has been observed in certain systems @xcite .",
    "a partial occultation of the emitting region by the neutral material in the pre - shock region causes this absorption .",
    "absorption models adopt an ad - hoc representation of these geometrical effects @xcite .",
    "in addition to absorption , the occultation of the emitting region behind the wd limb can produce orbital variations in the emission of mcvs @xcite .",
    "for instance , @xcite discussed these two processes in the context of the phase - dependent effects observed in the intermediate polar ex hya .",
    "both effects are possible in am  her systems @xcite .",
    "the absorption by the accretion column can produce narrow dips due to the material located near the coupling region , broad dips due to the material near the post - shock region , or both @xcite .",
    "the x - ray fits of polars are usually conducted without considering the optical data , partially because distinct codes are used to model each spectral range .",
    "one exception is the polar rx  j2115 - 5840 model @xcite . in this case , the cyclotron 2d - emitting region , obtained from the optical data fit using the methodology of @xcite , is used to define the location of the x - ray emission .",
    "however , the density and temperature profiles adopted when fitting each energy band are not identical .",
    "cp  tuc is a polar that presents energy - dependent orbital x - ray modulations in the high state of brightness @xcite .",
    "satellite discovered cp  tuc in february 1995 @xcite .",
    "two suggestions have been made regarding the nature of this modulation ( as for ex hya ) .",
    "@xcite fit the phase - resolved spectra using a partial - covering absorption model .",
    "alternatively , @xcite argued that accretion stream absorption was an unusual mechanism to modulate the x - ray light curves of polars and considered a self - eclipse scenario to be more likely .",
    "these authors fit the optical polarimetry data using one self - eclipsed region and suggested that a gradually eclipsed , extended inhomogeneous region can explain qualitatively x - ray modulation .",
    "this paper presents new optical polarimetric data from cp  tuc and extends cyclops to model optical and x - ray data together . this new version of cyclops",
    "is then used to study the spectral signature of the x - ray modulation via absorption or self - eclipse as well as how these situations can be distinguished using high - energy observations of polars .",
    "subsequently , cyclops was specifically applied to cp  tuc .",
    "this work is organised as follows : section [ modeld ] details the modifications conducted on cyclops .",

    "a detailed description of cyclops is presented in @xcite .",
    "this section describes the implementation of the x - ray emission in cyclops .",
    "initially , we present an overview of the code ( section [ cyc ] ) .",
    "subsequently , we outline the implementation of the bremsstrahlung emission ( section [ emi ] ) , the absorption that occurs in the accretion column ( section [ abs ] ) , and the procedure for simultaneously fitting optical and x - ray data ( section [ fit ] ) .",
    "cyclops builds a 3d grid to represent the entire accretion column from the threading region to the white dwarf surface .",
    "the entire column is divided into several volume elements ( voxels ) according to the chosen spatial resolution .",
    "the lines of a centred dipolar magnetic field define the geometry of the accretion column .",
    "the magnetic axis has an arbitrary direction relative to the white dwarf rotation axis .",
    "two footprints ( northern and southern ) are on the wd surface .",
    "this paper considers only one of these emitting regions .",
    "we defined the post - shock region from the wd surface to the height of the shock front .",
    "the emission comes from this region .",
    "the pre - shock region extends from the shock front to the threading region .",
    "the phase - dependent absorption is produced in the pre - shock region ( see section [ abs ] ) .",
    "the functions described below define the electron density and temperature of each voxel of the post - shock region .",
    "the magnetic field strength in each voxel was calculated using the magnetic dipole .",
    "a cartesian frame was defined for each orbital phase in which the emission was calculated .",
    "the z - direction of this frame was the observers line of sight .",
    "therefore , the observer views the accretion column as a 2d set of sight lines .",
    "the radiative transfer for each line of sight was solved by considering the emission and absorption processes that were implemented in the code .",
    "the cyclops input parameters are as follows :    * @xmath2 is the inclination of the orbital plane of the system relative to the observer .",
    "* @xmath3 is the angle between the rotation axis and the centre of the northern region .",
    "* @xmath4 defines the tangential location of the maxima of the density and temperature .",
    "it ranges from 0 to 1 .",
    "@xmath5 stands for a central location . *",
    "@xmath6 and @xmath7 define the size of the coupling region and , therefore , the footprint of the emitting region on the wd surface .",
    "the coupling region is defined as a 2d region that contains a reference point located at a radius @xmath8 from the wd surface and at longitude @xmath9 .",
    "@xmath8 and @xmath9 are defined by @xmath3 and the magnetic field geometry , see description of the geometry of the emitting region in @xcite .",
    "the coupling region radial length is 1 @xmath10 @xmath6 @xmath8 , therefore @xmath6 varies from 0 to 1 .",

    "however , equations [ eq_t ] and [ eq_n ] do not represent shock solutions and are not necessarily consistent with other model parameters .    with regard to the density and temperature profiles perpendicular to the radial direction , the code allows us to consider a constant profile or modify @xmath20 and @xmath21 using the following expressions :    @xmath22    and    @xmath23    where @xmath24 is the distance from the voxel to the reference point in which the temperature and density values are greatest .",
    "these expressions are plausible representations of the tangential decay of temperature and density in the accretion column .",
    "they are useful for testing whether the tangential variation of density and temperature affects the mcv emissions .",
    "the first version of cyclops only considered the cyclotron emission and bremsstrahlung absorption processes ; moreover , it was used to reproduce the optical and infrared polarisation of v834  cen @xcite .",
    "the bremsstrahlung emissivity of a fully ionised magnetised hydrogen plasma ( @xmath25 ) was calculated for each voxel ( k ) according to @xcite :    @xmath26    where @xmath27 ( @xmath28 ) is the electron number density , @xmath29 is energy , @xmath30 is temperature , and @xmath31 is the non - relativistic gaunt factor @xcite .",
    "the emission of a given orbital phase is the sum of the fluxes from all optical paths ( see section [ cyc ] ) .",
    "the radiative transport is calculated for each optical path from the farthest to nearest voxels by considering the incident radiation from the previous voxels .",
    "physical quantities vary along the optical path following the equations for density and temperature presented above .",
    "this variation naturally incorporates the shock structure and optical depth effects , which are important to correctly calculate the emerging flux ( see @xcite ) .",
    "these opacity effects in x - ray wavelengths are important when the column density is greater than @xmath32  @xmath1 .",
    "the x - ray models use at least 64 voxels in the radial direction to avoid under - sampling the temperature and density functions .    considering the thermal case , which is appropriated to mcvs ,",
    "the specific intensity for a given energy @xmath29 from each line of sight @xmath33 at orbital phase @xmath34 is    @xmath35    where @xmath36 is the plank function and @xmath37 is the number of voxels @xmath38 at line of sight @xmath33 .",
    "@xmath39 is the optical depth of a specific voxel , which is calculated as    @xmath40    where @xmath41 is the optical path equal to the voxel length .",
    "@xmath42 can be used to construct the image of the post - shock region in a given orbital phase using the frequency selected . in the absence of absorption , the total observed flux at the orbital phase @xmath34 is    @xmath43    where @xmath44 is a constant , @xmath45 is the emitting area , and @xmath46 is the distance to the system .",
    "cyclops can account for two sources of absorption : from the interstellar medium ( ism ) and from the pre - shock region .    to calculate the photo - absorption cross section for both situations",
    ", we used the idl routine _ bamabs _ @xcite .",
    "this absorption cross section is a function of temperature and abundances .",
    "we considered a homogeneous material with solar abundance and temperature equal to 10000  k.    the interstellar absorption is constant along the orbital cycle and depends on the quantity of the interstellar material in the direction of the source .",
    "the interstellar column density , @xmath47 ( @xmath1 ) , was estimated using ftool @xmath48 .",
    "@xmath47 was used as the upper limit of the interstellar column density of hydrogen in the fit .",
    "the pre - shock region followed the magnetic field lines from the post - shock to the threading regions .",
    "all the voxels in the pre - shock region were assumed to have the same density and an upper limit set by the minimum density of the post - shock region ( see below ) .",
    "the temperature was also constant .",
    "the pre - shock material absorption is phase dependent .",
    "this absorption was considered for the phases in which the pre - shock region fell between the observer and the post - shock region .",
    "cyclops included the absorption for each line of sight @xmath33 , which were summed to produce the total flux coming from the object in a given orbital phase @xmath2 .",
    "in particular , each line of sight has an absorption rate that is proportional to the column density of the pre - shock region .    considering the absorption from the ism and the upper portion of the column , the flux observed in each orbital phase",
    "@xmath2 is    @xmath49    where @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 is the photo - absorption cross section , @xmath53 is the minimum number density in the post - shock region , and @xmath54 is the number of voxels in the pre - shock region for each @xmath33 .",
    "the constants @xmath55 and @xmath56 are values between 0 and 1 that defines the fractions of @xmath53 and @xmath47 , which are used to fit the data .",
    "our aim is to simultaneously fit the x - ray and optical data of mcvs . to determine the model parameters that best fit the observational dataset",
    ", we used the least value of the figure of merit , @xmath57 , which was defined as    @xmath58    where @xmath59 measures the agreement between a given parameter set and the optical data , and @xmath60 plays the same role for high - energy data .",
    "we used light and polarisation curves in the optical regime , and we used spectra for the x - ray energies .",
    "the factor @xmath61 allowed us to choose the relative contributions of the optical or x - ray data in the fitting procedure .",
    "this flexibility is important for achieving a satisfactory fit in both energy ranges .",
    "the code automatically defined the wavelengths and the @xmath34 orbital phases for which the model should be calculated using the input datasets .",
    "usually , the orbital resolution of optical data is superior than that of the x - ray spectra .",
    "consequently , a x - ray spectrum was produced for all @xmath34 orbital phases of the optical dataset .",
    "these spectra were summed over specific orbital phase intervals to obtain the spectra in the @xmath62 interval phases that correspond to the observed x - ray spectra .",
    "the figures of merit slightly differ in the two spectral domains . specifically , we calculated the functions @xmath63 and @xmath64 using :    @xmath65 ^ 2 , \\label{eq_fluxo_optico}\\ ] ]    and    @xmath66 ^ 2,\\ ] ]    where @xmath67 and @xmath68 are the energy in optical and x - rays wavelengths , respectively , @xmath69 and @xmath70 are the fluxes calculated using the core of the code , and @xmath71 and @xmath72 are the observed ( total or polarised ) fluxes .",
    "the multiplicative value @xmath73 was used to normalise the model to compare with the data .",

    "this emission originates from the stellar components of the system .",
    "each frequency has a different @xmath74 value because this component is energy dependent .",
    "the superscript @xmath75 in the x - ray flux is explained below .",
    "the x - ray flux , as calculated by cyclops , @xmath76 , can not be directly compared with the data ; we must consider the response of the detection system to fit x - ray data . during the data reduction",
    ", we obtained two files : the detector redistribution matrix file ( @xmath77 ) , which accounts for detector gain and energy resolution , and the ancillary response file ( @xmath78 ) , which accounts for the effective area of the telescope / collimator ( including vignetting ) , filter transmission , detector window transmission , detector efficiency and any additional energy dependent effects ( see ogip calibration memo cal / gen/92 - 002 ) .",
    "we used the idl routine conv@xmath79 @xcite to convolve the original flux from cyclops , @xmath76 , with the response matrices to obtain the flux for observation comparisons , @xmath80 :    @xmath81    in addition , three other internal parameters were automatically optimised during the fitting procedure :    * an offset in the model orbital phase , @xmath82 ; * the fraction of the upper limit of the electron density in the attenuation region , @xmath55 ( see section [ abs ] ) ; * the fraction of the upper limit of the extinction due to ism , @xmath56 ( see section [ abs ] ) .",
    "as in the original code @xcite , the function @xmath57 was minimised using two algorithms .",
    "first , we used the pikaia algorithm @xcite with a broad range of parameters .",
    "then , the best solutions were refined using the amoeba algorithm ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the orbital variation of high - energy spectra is a common feature in polars ( see the introduction ) .",
    "cp  tuc presents this type of variation and our primary aim was to reproduce its x - ray spectra ( see section [ aplication ] ) .",
    "however , before presenting our results regarding cp  tuc modelling , some general results of cyclops should be discussed .",
    "the process of x - ray emission in polars is isotropic , and the emitting region is optically thin ; therefore , unlike the optical emission , the emitted flux does not change based on the viewing angle .",
    "the orbital variations of the x - ray spectra are explained by the temporary obscuration of the post - shock region .",
    "this obscuration might be due to the accretion column or the white dwarf . in the first case , the region that intercepts",
    "the sight line is cooler than the post - shock region ; therefore , it acts as an absorber .",
    "this absorption is most likely the origin of the broad dip observed in certain polars . in the second case , the flux is completely blocked ( i.e.",
    ", the flux from the portion of the post - shock region that is located behind the limb of the white dwarf is not observed ) .",
    "the geometry of the mass flux and the orbital inclination completely define both cases .",
    "hence , cyclops is a suitable tool for studying these effects because it incorporates a 3d representation of the system .",
    "we chose three sets of parameters to illustrate the two configurations that can produce spectral orbital variations ( see table [ model_generic ] ) . to simplify the discussion",
    ", we refer to them as _ absorption _ , _ self - eclipse i _ , and _ self - eclipse ii_. figure [ fig_mod5 ] shows the system in four orbital phases for each model : 0.0 , 0.3 , 0.5 , and 0.8 . figure [ fig_mod4 ] ( left ) shows the _ radial _ variations in density and temperature in the models .",
    "figure [ fig_mod4 ] ( right ) shows the _ longitudinal _ variations in the model _ self - eclipse ii_. these models are discussed in the following sections .",
    ".parameters of the generic models . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     @xmath83 @xmath84 : magnetic field range in the post - shock region .",
    "@xmath85 @xmath86 : mean temperature weighted using the square density , see section [ discussion ] for details .",
    "@xmath87 @xmath55 : the fraction of the maximum possible electron density in the attenuation region .",
    "@xmath88 @xmath89 : mean column density of the pre - shock region ( 10@xmath90@xmath1 ) .",
    "[ cvr_tab ]      we begin the discussion of our cp  tuc models by comparing certain parameters with previous estimates .",
    "zeeman tomography indicated that @xmath12 = 19.8  mg ( in the bipolar case ) and that the most frequent magnetic field in the photosphere was 10  mg @xcite .",
    "this technique probes the magnetic field on the entire wd surface .",
    "we found that @xmath12 = 6  mg and 7.6 mg for abs2 and abs3 , respectively .",
    "table [ cvr_tab ] shows the range of magnetic fields in the post - shock region ( @xmath84 ) for each model .",
    "for instance , abs3 has a range of 3.87.4  mg .",
    "therefore , the magnetic field found using cyclops was smaller that that found by @xcite .",
    "the cyclops emitting region reached a height of @xmath91 , which corresponds to a decrease greater than 30% in the magnetic field relative to the value in the photosphere .",
    "therefore , the radial extension of the emitting region can explain the difference .",
    "zeeman tomography indicated that the cp  tuc magnetic field configuration is an offset dipole or a multipole @xcite .",
    "as the cyclops emitting region covers a small fraction of the wd surface , our technique is not sensitive to distinct large - scale magnetic field configurations .",
    "@xcite estimated a temperature of 17  kev for the post - shock region .",
    "maximum _ temperature of abs2 and abs3 were 60 and 89  kev , respectively .",
    "however , the mean temperature weighted by the square density , @xmath86 , is a more proper comparison with @xcite s single - temperature model .",
    "it is 10  kev for abs2 and 15  kev for abs3 .",
    "thus , although we used @xmath15 to define the temperature profile , the hottest regions did not dominate the x - ray emission .",
    "given that all the gravitational energy is converted to x - ray radiation in the post - shock region , we estimated the lower limit for the wd mass in cp  tuc using the wd mass - radius relationship from @xcite .",
    "we found 0.38 and 0.47  @xmath92 for abs2 and abs3 , respectively .",
    "the secondary mass was 0.08  @xmath92 from the orbital period versus the secondary mass relation ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the resulting mass ratios were 0.21 and 0.17 for abs2 and abs3 , respectively .",
    "optical spectroscopy fo cp  tuc @xcite is one observational constraint that can help to distinguish abs2 from abs3 .",
    "the radial velocity of the broad component of the optical emission lines displays sinusoidal behaviour with a maximum redshift during phase 0.9 .",
    "hence , the base of the accretion column must be observed from the smallest angle at phase 0.9 .",
    "figure [ fig_res1 ] shows the system configuration for abs2 and abs3 for phases 0.2 , 0.4 , 0.6 , 0.8 and 0.9 . the curved red line threaded through the emitting region is a magnetic field line , which aids the visualisation of the flow direction in the emitting region .",
    "the right panels show the entire accretion column and illustrate the pre - shock region geometry .",
    "the system configuration of abs3 has matched the spectroscopy .",
    "we observe the region from the top in phase 0.9 .",
    "thus , the post - shock emission has a maximum redshift .",
    "the region is pointing away from the observer and has the maximum blueshift at approximately phase 0.4 .",
    "in abs2 , the field line points to the observer at approximately phase 0.2 ( maximum redshift ) and is in the opposite direction during phase 0.8 ( maximum blueshift ) , which has not matched the spectroscopy .    despite the better agreement between abs3 and the spectroscopy",
    ", we should take this result with caution because it is qualitative .",
    "moreover , the model did not account for certain effects that might improve the fit .",
    "the abs2 model presents the best fit of the x - ray spectra ( see figure [ cptuc_abs ] , long - dashed line ) and an acceptable fit of the optical data ( see figures [ fig_flx ] and [ fig_pol ] , long - dashed line ) .",
    "its linear polarisation and cyclotron flux modulation were lower than observed .",
    "a better agreement between the optical data and abs2 might be achieved by including an ellipsoidal variation component in the model , because this emission has the proper phasing and colour .",
    "the elipsoidal variation was not accounted for in the model .    the abs3 model ( solid lines in figures",
    "[ fig_flx ] , [ fig_pol ] and [ cptuc_abs ] ) provides the best fit to the optical data , with linear polarisation and flux modulation consistent with the observations .",
    "it also presented an acceptable fit to the high - energy x - ray spectrum , but it overestimated the absorption at low energies .",
    "this excess absorption might be due to the adopted approximations of the pre - shock material , which was cold , homogeneous , and had solar abundance .",
    "a warmer absorber with smaller abundance might have less photoabsorption .",
    "a decrement in the density of regions farther from the wd might also account for the smaller net absorption .",
    "importantly , cyclops only includes the bremsstrahlung continuum emission in the x - ray range , which is the dominant process .",
    "however , other processes might also contribute including compton scattering in the post - shock region @xcite , heating of the wd surface , and emission lines .",
    "taking into account all of the above considerations , small differences between the observed data and the model were expected . on the other hand , the quantity and quality of the dataset might be not enough to justify the inclusion of these `` second - order '' processes in the models .",
    "however , we argue that these data are enough to restrict the correct viewing aspect of this system , which has phase - resolved absorption in x - rays .",
    "we extended the cyclops code to study the x - ray and optical continua emission of polars .",
    "we included bremsstrahlung x - ray emission , the dominant radiative process in the post - shock region , and photo - absorption by the pre - shock accretion column .",
    "cyclotron emission and self - eclipse by the white dwarf were already available in the previous version of the code .",
    "the new version allowed us to simultaneously model x - ray and optical data .",
    "the calculated spectra accounted for the temperature and density structure in the post - shock region in both radial and tangential directions .",
    "although the x - ray emission of polars is usually optically thin , our radiative transfer solution adequately treated optically thick and thin regions .",
    "the magnetic field lines in the 3d space defined the accretion column geometry .",
    "this approach resulted in a consistent representation of the geometrical effects of the white dwarf occultation and the pre - shock region absorption .",
    "moreover , the code provided phase - resolved x - ray spectra .",
    "we showed that phase - resolved x - ray spectra have distinct signatures in cases of self - eclipse and absorption .",
    "absorption causes a clear variation of the spectral index along the orbital cycle , whereas these differences are barely distinguished in the self - eclipse case , even when we consider the inhomogeneous distribution of the temperature and density in the emitting region .",
    "we chose cp  tuc to explore the differences between self - eclipse and absorption in the x - ray spectra of polars because it is a polar with two diverging explanations for its x - ray data , and each one is consistent with one of the above scenarios .",
    "we modelled cp  tuc using the x - ray and optical data from the literature as well as new optical @xmath93 and @xmath94 polarimetry and photometry data .",
    "our cp  tuc models indicated a single accretion region object in which cyclotron beaming generated the optical modulation and photo - absorption generated the x - ray modulation , in agreement with @xcite .",
    "we could not create a model that described the x - ray spectra using the self - eclipse scenario .",
    "the magnetic field intensity of our best fittings was consistent with previous zeeman tomography estimates @xcite .",
    "the temperature structure matched the single - temperature model of the x - ray continuum @xcite .",
    "one of the best fittings had the correct phasing to account for the radial velocity curve of the broad component of the optical emission lines @xcite .",
    "future improvements to the code are a more physically consistent description of the pre - shock and post - shock density and temperature distributions and inclusion of other emitting process . with regard to cp  tuc , a more detailed model requires more quality data in high - energy range .",

    "<S> the viewing geometry of the polar cp  tuc that better explains its optical and x - ray light curves is controversial . </S>",
    "<S> previous modelling of white - light polarimetric data considered the partial self - eclipse of an extended inhomogeneous emitting region . </S>",
    "<S> alternatively , phase - dependent absorption has been used to reproduce the x - ray data . </S>",
    "<S> this paper presents new optical polarimetric data of cp  tuc and a model that consistently explains its optical and x - ray data . </S>",
    "<S> the model was based on an extension of the cyclops code that added x - ray bremsstrahlung emission and pre - shock region absorption to the original version , which only accounted for cyclotron emission . </S>",
    "<S> the new code creates the possibility of simultaneous optical and x - ray fitting . </S>",
    "<S> we show that self - eclipse and absorption data have distinct signatures on the x - ray spectra . </S>",
    "<S> although we were able to reasonably fit the cp  tuc optical data to cases of absorption and self - eclipse , we were only able to reproduce the x - ray orbital modulation after considering the absorption in the pre - shock region . specifically , we were unable to reproduce the x - ray observations in the self - eclipse case . </S>",
    "<S> we found that the primary emitting region in cp  tuc is located near the rotation pole that approximately points to the observer .    </S>",
