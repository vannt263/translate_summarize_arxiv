    "secondary structures can be interpreted as ( partial ) matchings in a graph of permissible base pairs @xcite .",

    "sparsification has been applied in the context of rna - rna interaction structures @xcite as well as rna pseudoknot structures @xcite . in difference to rna secondary structures , however , not every decomposition rule in the dp - folding of rna pseudoknot structures is amendable to sparsification . by construction ,",

    "the polymer - zeta property is theoretically justified by means of modeling the 2d folding of a polymer chain as a self - avoiding walk ( saw ) in a 2d lattice @xcite .",
    "more evidence of the polymer - zeta property for rna secondary structures has been collected via the ncbi database @xcite of mfe - rna structures .    in this paper",

    "our paper provides a combinatorial framework to quantify the effects of sparsifying the @xmath0-decomposition rule .",
    "we shall prove that the candidate set @xcite is indeed small .",
    "our argument is based on assuming a specific distribution of irreducible structures within mfe - structures .",
    "namely we assume these irreducibles to appear with probability @xmath24 , where we assume @xmath25 to be a fixed parameter and @xmath26 to be a bivariate ( energy - filtered ) generating function whose associated generation function of irreducibles is @xmath27 .",
    "while this energy - filtration seems to be reparameterization of the notion of `` stickiness '' @xcite , it is really fundamentally different .",
    "this becomes clear when considering loop - based energies which distinguishes energy and arcs .",
    "clearly when folding random sequences one weights the latter around @xmath28 , reminiscent of the probability of two given positions to be compatible .",
    "the energy however is fairly independent as it really depends on the particular loop - type .",
    "we obtain these energy - filtered gfs also for rna pseudoknot structures of fixed topological genus .",
    "this provides new insights into the improvements of the sparsification of the concatenation - rule @xmath0 in the presence of cross serial interactions .",
    "our observations complement the detailed analysis of backofen @xcite .",
    "we show that although for pseudoknot structures of fixed topological genus @xcite the effect of sparsification on the global time complexity is still unclear , the decomposition rule that splits an interval can be sped up significantly .",
    "the general idea of sparsification @xcite is following : let @xmath29 be a set whose elements @xmath30 are unions of pairwise disjoint intervals . let furthermore @xmath31 denote an optimal solution ( a positive number or score ) of the dp - routine over @xmath32",

    "this optimal solution allows to construct a non - unique arc - configuration ( sub - structure ) over @xmath32 @xcite and the above @xmath40-splitting consequently translates into a splitting of this sub - structure .",
    "this connects the notion of @xmath40-candidates with that of sub - structures and shows that a @xmath40-candidate implies an sub - structure that is @xmath40-irreducible .    in the case of sparsification of rna",

    "we proceed by comparing the expected number of candidates of a sequence with length @xmath126 with @xmath216 , @xmath217 for sufficient large @xmath218 , @xmath219 .",
    "furthermore @xmath220 from which we can conclude @xmath221 and the theorem is proved .      in this section",
    "we discuss the more realistic loop - based energy model of rna secondary structure folding .",
    "to be precise we evoke here instead of two trivariate gfs @xmath222 and @xmath223 counting secondary structures over @xmath126 vertices that filter energy and arcs .",
    "this becomes necessary since the loop - based model distinguishes between arcs and energy .",
    "the `` cancelation '' effect or reparameterization of stickiness @xcite to which we referred to before does not appear in this context .",
    "thus we need both an arc- as well as an energy - filtration .",
    "a further complication emerges . in difference to the gfs @xmath224 and @xmath168 the new gfs are not simply obtained by formally substituting @xmath225 into the power series @xmath129 and @xmath144 as bivariate terms .",
    "the more complicated energy model requires a specific recursion for irreducible secondary structures .",
    "the energy model used in prediction secondary structure is more complicated than the simple arc - based energy model .",
    "loops which are formed by arcs as well as isolated vertexes between the arcs are considered to give energy contribution .",
    "loops are categorized as hairpin loops ( no nested arcs ) , interior loops ( including bulge loops and stacks ) and multi - loops ( more than two arc nested ) , see figure  [ f : loops ] .",
    "an arbitrary secondary structure can be uniquely decomposed into a collection of mutually disjoint loops . a result of the particular energy parameters",
    "@xcite is that the energy model prefers interior loops , in particular stacks ( no isolated vertex between two parallel arc ) , and disfavors multi - loops .",
    "base on this observation , we give a simplified energy model for a loop @xmath226 contained in secondary structure by    * @xmath227 if @xmath104 is a hairpin loop , * @xmath228 if @xmath104 is an interior loop , * @xmath229 if @xmath104 is a multi - loop ,    where @xmath226 is a loop .",
    "the weight for a secondary structure @xmath230 accordingly is given by @xmath231        let @xmath232 and @xmath233 be the gfs obtained by setting @xmath234 and @xmath235 in @xmath223 and @xmath222 , where @xmath25 is the euler number .",
    "this means we find a suitable parameterization which brings us back to a simple univariate gf .    [ l : eumel3 ] the weight function of rna secondary structures , @xmath232 , satisfies @xmath236 and @xmath237 is uniquely determined by the above equation .",
    "furthermore @xmath238    we first consider the gf @xmath232 whose coefficient of @xmath239 denotes the total weight of irreducible secondary structures over @xmath126 vertexes , where @xmath240 is an arc .",
    "thus it gives a term @xmath241 .",
    "isolated vertex lead to the term @xmath242 where @xmath243 denotes the minimum number of isolated vertexes to be inserted . depending on the types of loops formed by @xmath244",
    ", we have    * hairpin loops : @xmath245 , * interior loops : @xmath246 , * multi - loops : there are at least two irreducible substructures , as well as isolated vertices , thus @xmath247    we compute @xmath248 which establishes the recursion . the uniqueness of the solution as a power series follows from the fact that each coefficient can evidently be recursively computed .    an arbitrary secondary structure can be considered as a sequence of irreducible substructure with certain intervals of isolated vertexes .",
    "thus @xmath249    [ l : eumel33 ] @xmath232 and @xmath233 have the same singular expansion .",
    "@xmath250 where @xmath251 and @xmath252 are constants and @xmath253    solving eq .",
    "[ e : sec_rec_loop ] we obtain a unique solution for @xmath232 whose coefficient are all positive . observing the dominant singularity of @xmath232",
    "it is @xmath254 .",

    "furthermore , @xmath232 and @xmath233 have the same sub - exponential factor @xmath257 , hence the lemma .",
    "[ t : eumel22 ] suppose an mfe secondary structure over an interval of length @xmath4 is irreducible with probability @xmath258 , then the expected number of candidates for sequences of lengths @xmath126 is @xmath259 and furthermore , setting @xmath260 , we have @xmath261 where @xmath262 .    by lemma",

    "in this paper we quantify the effect of sparsification of the particular decomposition rule @xmath0 .",
    "this rule splits and interval and thereby separates concatenated substructures .",
    "the sparsification of @xmath0 alone is claimed to provide a speed up of up to a linear factor of the dp - folding of rna secondary structures @xcite .",
    "a similar conclusion is drawn in @xcite where the sparsification of rna - rna interaction structures is shown to experience also a linear reduction in time complexity .",
    "both papers @xcite base their conclusion on the validity of the polymer - zeta property discussed in section  * sparsification*.    for the folding of pseudoknot structures there may however exist non - sparsifiable rules in which case the overall time complexity is not reduced .",
    "the key object here is the _ set of candidates _ and we provide an analysis of @xmath0-candidates by combinatorial means . in general , the connection between candidates , i.e.  unions of disjoint intervals and the combinatorics of structures is actually established by the algorithm itself via backtracking : at the end of the dp - algorithm a structure is being generated that realizes the previously computed energy as mfe - structure .",
    "this connects intervals and sub - structures .",
    "so , does polymer - zeta apply in the context of rna structures ?",
    "in fact polymer - zeta would follow _ if _ the intervals in question are distributed as in uniformly sampled structures .",
    "this however , is far from reasonable , due to the fact that the mfe - algorithm deliberately designs some mfe structure over the given interval . what the algorithm produces is in fact antagonistic to uniform sampling .",
    "we here wish to acknowledge the help of one anonymous referee in clarifying this point .",

    "the theoretical findings from self - avoiding walks @xcite unfortunately do not allow to quantify the expected number of candidates of the @xmath0-rule in rna folding .    that the polymer - zeta property does not hold for rna",
    "has also been observed in the context of the limit distribution of the 5-3 distances of rna secondary structures @xcite .",
    "here it is observed that long arcs , to be precise arcs of lengths @xmath20 _ always _ exist .",
    "this is of course a contradiction to eq .",
    "( [ e : mmn ] ) .",
    "the key to quantification of the expected number of candidates is the singularity analysis of a pair of energy - filtered gf , namely that of a class of structures and that of the subclass of all such structures that are irreducible .",
    "we show that for various energy models the singular expansions of both these functions are essentially _ equal_modulo some constant .",
    "this implies that the expected number of candidates is @xmath5 and all constants can explicitly be computed from a detailed singularity analysis .",
    "the good news is that depending on the energy model , a significant constant reduction , around @xmath6 can be obtained .",
    "this is in accordance with data produced in @xcite for the mfe - folding of random sequences .",
    "there a reduction by @xmath3 is reported for sequences of length @xmath266 .",
    "our findings are of relevance for numerous results , that are formulated in terms of sizes of candidate sets @xcite",
    ". these can now be quantified .",
    "it is certainly of interest to devise a full fledged analysis of the loop - based energy model .",
    "while these computations are far from easy our framework shows how to perform such an analysis .    using the paradigm of gap - matrices backofen",
    "has shown @xcite that the sparsification of the dp - folding of rna pseudoknot structures exhibits additional instances , where sparsification can be applied , see fig .",
    "[ f : spar_g ] ( b ) .",
