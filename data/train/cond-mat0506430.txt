    "in the last fifteen years , after the discovery of high - temperature superconductivity in cuprates , there has been an upsurge of renewed interest in the electronic properties of transition metal oxides.@xcite among the different techniques applied to investigate such materials , resonant x - ray scattering ( rxs ) has proved to be a powerful tool to extract direct informations about magnetic@xcite and electronic @xcite distributions : no other methods have the same flexibility to detect lattice , orbital and magnetic anisotropies within the same experimental setup.@xcite yet , a general theoretical comprehension of some important implications of this technique is still lacking , and this circumstance has sometimes led to incorrect conclusions about the origin of the anomalous signals.@xcite this is particularly true for magnetic rxs , where the absence of numerical _ ab - initio _ simulations has strongly limited the possibility of quantitative investigations .",
    "only recently few papers have appeared dealing with this matter .",
    "in particular takahashi _",
    "et al._@xcite have used the _ ab initio _ local density approximation ( lda ) + @xmath4 scheme , taking also into account spin - orbit interaction , to describe such phenomena . in this way they were able to calculate the magnetic rxs in the energy region of the @xmath5 conduction band in kcuf@xmath1 .",
    "one of the purposes of this paper is to present an alternative method to deal with magnetic phenomena , which we believe physically more intuitive , based on a relativistic extension of the schrdinger equation and the multiple scattering theory ( mst ) .",
    "this extension is obtained by eliminating the small component of the relativistic wave - function in the dirac equation and working only with the upper component,@xcite thereby using the more intuitive non relativistic set of quantum numbers @xmath6 for the angular and spin momenta . in order to take into account spin - polarized potentials and spin - orbit interaction in the framework of mst",
    "we solve a two - channel problem , in each atomic sphere , for the two spin components of the wave - function coupled by the spin - orbit interaction .",
    "the condition @xmath7 must be satisfied , due to the local conservation of the @xmath8-projection of total angular momentum @xmath9 . we have implemented the computer code to calculate magnetic rxs into the fdmnes package.@xcite    secondly and more important , we present here the first application of this method to deal with the case of v@xmath0o@xmath1 , which has attracted considerable attention in the past four years , @xcite due to the peculiar interplay of magnetic and orbital ordering . by performing a quantitative analysis of the recent rxs experiments carried out by paolasini _",
    "et al._@xcite at the vanadium k edge , we shall try to establish the magnetic space group of the monoclinic phase , in the endeavor to resolve some controversies that are still going on in the scientific community .",
    "a brief history of the most recent findings about v@xmath0o@xmath1 will motivate our work .",
    "this compound is a mott - hubbard system showing a metal - insulator transition at around 150 k from a paramagnetic metallic ( pm ) to an anti - ferromagnetic insulating ( afi ) phase due to the interplay between band formation and electron coulomb correlation.@xcite a structural phase transition takes place , at the same temperature , from corundum to monoclinic crystal class . in recent years , on the basis of an old theoretical model by castellani _",
    "et al._,@xcite fabrizio _",
    "et al._@xcite suggested that a direct observation of orbital ordering ( oo ) could have been possible by means of rxs .",
    "soon after paolasini _ et al._@xcite interpreted the forbidden ( 111 ) monoclinic bragg - forbidden reflection as an evidence of such oo .",
    "all this gave rise to an intense debate @xcite whose main achievement was to prove the incorrectness of the old castellani _",
    "et al . _ model .",
    "in fact , non - resonant x - ray magnetic scattering experiments @xcite and absorption linear dichroism@xcite showed that the atomic spin on vanadium ions is s=1 , and not s=1/2 , as supposed in ref .",
    "yet , none of the attempts to explain the origin of the ( 111 ) monoclinic reflection@xcite can be considered satisfactory , for reasons that will be clearer in the following .",
    "here we just recall that many different physical mechanisms have been proposed , from the antiferro - quadrupolar ordering of the 3@xmath10 orbitals , @xcite to the combined action of the ordered orbital and magnetic degrees of freedom;@xcite from an orbital ordering associated with a reduction of the magnetic symmetry,@xcite to the anisotropies in the magnetic octupolar@xcite or toroidal distribution.@xcite    in this paper we shall focus on a series of bragg - forbidden reflections measured by paolasini and collaborators.@xcite of particular interest , from a theoretical point of view , is the set of data of ref .",
    "[ ] , where the different reflections have been collected with particular care on their relative intensities , and energy and azimuthal scans have been performed in both the rotated ( @xmath11 ) and unrotated ( @xmath12 ) channels .",
    "thanks to the wide information content of these data , we are able to demonstrate that the signal can not be due to any kind of orbital ordering or charge anisotropy and it must be magnetic .",
    "moreover we can show that both mechanisms suggested in refs .",
    "[ ] can be at work for the ( 1,1,1 ) reflection , as there is no extinction rule for either dipole - quadrupole or quadrupole - quadrupole transitions . which of the two contributions dominates depends strongly on the kind of reflection and on the azimuthal angle .",
    "to reach this conclusion _ ab initio _ calculations have proved necessary .",
    "the next section is devoted to the description of our method to deal with magnetic phenomena without resorting to the dirac equation .",
    "we shall work in the framework of mst with muffin - tin approximation or within the finite difference method ( fdm),@xcite ie , without approximation on the geometrical shape of the potential . in sec .",
    "iii we introduce the crystal and electronic properties of v@xmath0o@xmath1 and compare our results with the experimental data , discussing the physical mechanism behind each reflection .",
    "finally we draw some conclusions on the possibility of gaining information about orbital and magnetic degrees of freedom by means of rxs .",
    "core resonant spectroscopies are described by the virtual processes that promote a core electron to some empty energy levels .",
    "they all depend on the transition matrix elements of the operator @xmath13 expressing the interaction of electromagnetic radiation with matter :    @xmath14    here @xmath15 is the ground state and @xmath16 the photo - excited state . in the x - ray regime , the operator @xmath13 is usually written through the multipolar expansion of the photon field up to the electric quadrupole term@xcite :    @xmath17    where @xmath18 is the electron position measured from the absorbing ion , @xmath19 is the polarization of the incoming ( outgoing ) photon and @xmath20 its corresponding wave vector . in the following dipole and quadrupole",
    "will refer to electric dipole and electric quadrupole . in rxs the global process of photon absorption ,",
    "virtual excitation of the photoelectron , and subsequent decay with re - emission of a photon , is coherent throughout the crystal .",
    "such a coherence gives rise to the usual bragg diffraction condition , that can be expressed , at resonance , as :    @xmath21    where @xmath22 stands for the position of the scattering ion @xmath23 , @xmath24 is the diffraction vector and @xmath25 is the usual thomson factor",
    ". the resonant part , @xmath26 , is the anomalous atomic scattering factor ( asf ) , given by the expression@xcite :    @xmath27    here @xmath28 is the photon energy , @xmath29 the electron mass , @xmath30 the ground state energy , and @xmath31 and @xmath32 are the energy and inverse lifetime of the excited states . in practice ,",
    "the intermediate states @xmath16 are in the continuum , normalized to one state per rydberg .",
    "for this reason it is useful to label them by their energy @xmath33 and re - express eq .",
    "( [ eq_arxs ] ) as :    @xmath34    using the fact that , at resonance , @xmath35 .",
    "@xmath36 is the fermi energy . in eq .",
    "( [ eq_arxs2 ] ) the summation over @xmath37 is now limited to states having the energy @xmath33 .",
    "it is now straightforward to make the connection with another spectroscopic technique : x - ray near edge absorption ( xanes ) . in this case",
    "the cross - section simply corresponds to the imaginary part of the asf when @xmath38 ( forward scattering ) .",
    "choosing prefactors in order to have @xmath39 in units of the classical electron radius , @xmath40 m , and the absorption cross section @xmath41 in megabarn , we have the relation :    @xmath42    where @xmath43 is the bohr radius , @xmath44 is the fine structure constant and @xmath45 is the speed of light .",
    "the close connection between the two spectroscopies is thus evident .",
    "the use of rxs can have some advantages in exploring electronic properties compared to the absorption techniques .",
    "first , with rxs it is possible to select different relative conditions in incoming and outgoing polarizations and wave vectors , and this gives more opportunities to probe the magnetic and electronic anisotropies of the material .",
    "secondly , rxs can be more site selective than xanes , due to the bragg factor ( [ eq_f ] ) .",
    "for instance , it is possible , in magnetite , to be sensitive only to octahedral fe@xmath46-sites and not to tetrahedral fe@xmath47-sites @xcite or , in manganites , to probe only mn@xmath46-ions and not mn@xmath48-ions.@xcite this can be achieved at reflections that are bragg - forbidden off - resonance , but become detectable , in resonant conditions , because of non - symmorphic symmetry elements ( glide planes , screw axes ) in the crystal space group.@xcite in these cases the thomson factors @xmath25 ( eq . [ eq_f ] ) drop out and one is just sensitive to the changes of the asf ( eq . ( [ eq_arxs ] ) ) that depend on the relative electronic and magnetic anisotropies on the ions related by such non - symmorphic symmetry elements .",
    "it is indeed in such kinds of reflections that orbital ordering or magnetic scattering were reported and they will be the main subject of the present study .      in sec .",
    "iii we shall deal with the symmetry operations of the crystal space group of v@xmath0o@xmath1 , in order to evaluate the structure factor for rxs . because of this , it is very useful to write explicitly the dipole and quadrupole components of the matrix elements in eq .",
    "( [ eq_arxs2 ] ) . remembering that incoming and outgoing x - rays can have different polarizations and wave vectors , we get :    @xmath49    where @xmath44 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 and @xmath52 are cartesian coordinate labels and @xmath53 , @xmath54 and @xmath55 ,",
    "the dipole - dipole ( dd ) , dipole - quadrupole ( dq ) and quadrupole - quadrupole ( qq ) contributions , respectively . their explicit expression is given by :    @xmath56    note that at a k - edge , in absence of spin - orbit interaction and time - reversal breaking potentials , @xmath57 , @xmath58 and @xmath59 are all real .",
    "the main difficulty in the _ ab - initio _ evaluation of the asf is the determination of the excited states .",
    "two different procedures , mst and fdm , have already been developed for non - magnetic cases , and the corresponding packages@xcite used in some xanes@xcite and rxs@xcite applications . in the following",
    "we introduce a relativistic extension of the _ ab initio _ cluster approach , for both mst and fdm , that is still mono - electronic but includes the spin - orbit interaction and allows to handle magnetic processes .",
    "the importance of the fdm procedure to avoid the muffin - tin approximation has already been reported@xcite and will not be detailed here again .",
    "note only that with fdm the intermediate states are calculated by solving the schrdinger equation without any approximation on the geometrical shape of the potential , ie , we do not need to use , as usually in mst approaches , a spherically averaged potential in the atomic spheres and a constant among them .",
    "this point is essential to study orbitally ordered materials , where an anisotropic orbital distribution is the key - feature of the system and no spherically averaged potentials would be adequate for its description .",
    "unfortunately , large cluster calculations with fdm are prohibitively long in computing time and require a lot of computer memory : that s why , when appropriate , mst is preferred .    in order to treat magnetic effects in mst",
    "we have considered the relativistic extension of schrdinger equation obtained by solving dirac equation exactly for the upper component of the wave - function , as described by wood and boring.@xcite this approach ensures that the singularity of the potential at the nuclear center is of centrifugal type ( @xmath60 ) even in the presence of spin - orbit terms ( so that the usual fuchsian method of solution can be used ) .",
    "it also allows us to work with the usual non relativistic set of quantum numbers ( @xmath2 ) of angular and spin momenta , which we find much more intuitive than the relativistic set .",
    "our one particle basis will therefore comprise spin - orbit coupled core states of the form : @xmath61 and valence excited states which are multiple scattering solutions of the schrdinger equation with spin - polarized potentials . in atomic units",
    ":    @xmath62    @xmath63    these latters are supplemented by the scattered wave boundary conditions : @xmath64    in eq .",
    "( [ boh1 ] ) @xmath65 are the clebsch - gordan coefficients . in eq .",
    "( [ e0 ] ) @xmath66 is the average of spin up and spin down potentials , @xmath67 their difference and @xmath68 the usual spin - orbit term .",
    "such potentials already embody the relativistic corrections due to the reduction of the upper dirac component of the wave function to an effective schrdinger equation.@xcite    in the muffin - tin approximation the solution inside the _ i - th _ atomic muffin - tin sphere can be written as : @xmath69    @xmath70    where at the muffin - tin radius @xmath71 the radial functions @xmath72 match smoothly to the following combination of bessel and hankel functions via the atomic @xmath73 matrices ( defined below ) : @xmath74    with a proper normalization of these radial functions to one state per rydberg , the scattering amplitudes @xmath75 obey the equations ( writing @xmath76 for @xmath77 ) : @xmath78 where @xmath79 is the usual multiple scattering matrix , generalized to spin variables , and @xmath80 denotes the position of the _ i - th _ atom in the cluster with respect to the origin of the coordinates .",
    "the atomic @xmath81-matrix @xmath73 describes the scattering amplitude of an electron impinging the atomic potential with angular momentum @xmath82 , azimuthal component @xmath83 and spin @xmath41 into a state with quantum numbers @xmath84 .",
    "the conservation of the total angular momentum @xmath85 and its @xmath8-projection implies the constraint @xmath86 .",
    "note that also @xmath82 is unchanged in the scattering process , since in the muffin - tin approximation the potential has spherical symmetry .",
    "by introducing as usual@xcite the scattering path operator @xmath87 as the inverse of @xmath88 , the solution for the scattering amplitudes @xmath89 is given by : @xmath90 the scattering path operator @xmath91 represents the probability amplitude for the excited photoelectron to propagate from site @xmath92 , with angular momentum @xmath76 and spin @xmath41 , to site @xmath93 with angular momentum @xmath94 and spin @xmath95 .",
    "it is the obvious generalization of the corresponding spin - independent quantity.@xcite    we now have all the ingredients to perform the intermediate sum in eq .",
    "( [ eq_arxs2 ] ) . using the expression given eq .",
    "( [ e1 ] ) for the state @xmath96 in the matrix elements of the numerator , the sum over @xmath37 becomes an integral over the escape direction of the photoelectron , @xmath97 , at fixed energy , @xmath98 .",
    "when we perform the integral over the energy , we get the product of two smoothly varying radial matrix elements of the type @xmath99 times the appropriate angular ( gaunt ) coefficient .",
    "the exponent @xmath100 is determined by the polar order of the transition .",
    "this is further multiplied by the angular integral of the product of the two scattering amplitudes @xmath89 , @xmath101 centered on the absorbing sites .",
    "this latter can be simplified by the use of a generalized optical theorem@xcite : @xmath102 as a consequence , the knowledge of @xmath103 at all relevant energies , and of the radial solutions @xmath104 on the photoabsorber are sufficient to calculate the asf .    in the case of v@xmath105o@xmath106 , in order to construct the spin - polarized atomic potentials ,",
    "we have used the prescription by von barth and hedin@xcite : they were derived from the non - self - consistent spin - polarized charge density obtained by superimposing the atomic charge densities with two magnetic electrons on each vanadium ion , as suggested by the experimental data.@xcite we believe that this approximation is not far from reality , as shown _ a posteriori _ by the goodness of the results . given the potential , it is straightforward to calculate the atomic spin dependent @xmath81-matrix : we just solve the two - channel problem arising from the schrdinger equation ( [ e0 ] ) due to the presence of the spin - orbit potential . in this way",
    "this latter is treated on the same footing as the other potentials and not in perturbation theory as usually done .",
    "the relativistic extension in the fdm scheme follows closely the previous treatment for mst .",
    "the space is partioned , as in the multiple scattering approach , in three regions@xcite : _ i ) _ an outer sphere surrounding the cluster where one impose the scattering behaviour of the wave function given in eq .",
    "( [ e00 ] ) .",
    "_ ii ) _ an atomic region made up of spheres , around each atom , with radii much smaller than the muffin - tin radii ( of the order of 1 a.u . or less ) . here",
    "the charge density is to a very good approximation spherically symmetric , due to the presence of the core electrons . _",
    "iii ) _ finally , an interstitial region where the laplacian operator of the schrdinger equation ( [ e0 ] ) is discretized and the solution is generated on a greed without any approximation on the geometrical shape of the potential . by imposing a smooth continuity of the overall wave function across the boundaries of the three regions",
    ", one can determine both the expansion amplitudes of the wave function inside each atom and the scattering t - matrix of the whole cluster in eq .",
    "( [ e00 ] ) .",
    "@xcite note that in this case the spin - orbit potential is not spherically symmetric .",
    "we have checked that for a small cluster with close - packed geometry , this approach and the multiple scattering approach with muffin - tin approximation provide almost identical cross sections .",
    "since v@xmath105o@xmath106 is a close - packed structure , if one neglects vanadium voids , we have used mst in the muffin - tin approximation for the magnetic calculations .",
    "the fdm scheme was instead used in the calculation of the asf in the case of orbital ordering .",
    "in this section we specialize to the case of v@xmath0o@xmath1 , to investigate whether the rxs reflections observed by paolasini and collaborators @xcite are of magnetic or orbital nature .",
    "our result is that magnetic ordering can explain the experimental data with a reasonably good agreement ( even if not perfect , for reasons that will be discussed below ) .",
    "on the other hand , we are able to demonstrate that any oo origin of the signal has to be excluded , as it would not fit the energy scan at dipolar energies .",
    "next subsection is devoted to the description of the magnetic space group in the afi phase , as well as the derivation of the anomalous rxs amplitude . in subsection",
    "b we analyze the _ ab - initio _",
    "calculations for the magnetic rxs , through the procedure previously developed . finally , in the last part we show that the consequences of a time - reversal breaking oo are not compatible with the experimental data , thus putting a severe constraint on the possible oo theories for v@xmath0o@xmath1 .      as a first step we shall try to establish the magnetic symmetry group in the afi phase .",
    "our starting point is the crystallographic structure , as given by dernier and marezio@xcite together with the magnetic data given by moon@xcite and later confirmed by wei bao _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite    referring to the frame and the numbering of vanadium atoms of fig .",
    "[ fig_1 ] , we can divide the eight atoms of the monoclinic unit cell into two groups of four , @xmath107 and @xmath108 , @xmath109 , @xmath110 , @xmath111 , with opposite orientations of the magnetic moment .",
    "the two groups are related by a body - centered translation .",
    "vanadium - ion magnetic moments , indicated by arrows in the figure , lie perpendicular to the @xmath112-axis at an angle of 138@xmath113 away from the monoclinic @xmath114-axis . neglecting the magnetic moments , the previous two groups of four atoms with their oxygen environments are translationally equivalent",
    ".    we can infer from these data that the magnetic space group can be written as @xmath115 , where @xmath116 is the time - reversal operator and @xmath117 the body - centered translation .",
    "the monoclinic group @xmath118 contains four symmetry operations : the identity @xmath119 , the inversion @xmath120 , the two - fold rotation about the monoclinic @xmath112 axis @xmath121 and the reflection @xmath122 with respect to the plane perpendicular to this axis .",
    "all these operations are associated to the appropriate translations , as shown in the following table :    @xmath123    table i.    here @xmath124 are the fractional coordinates of the atoms in unit of the monoclinic axis .",

    "all the recorded reflections have the same incoming polarization , @xmath41 ( electric field perpendicular to the diffraction plane ) , whereas the outgoing polarization is analyzed both in the @xmath41 and @xmath126 channels ( this latter with the electric field in the diffraction plane ) .",
    "the azimuthal scans are then registered by rotating the sample around the diffraction vector .",

    "of course , no @xmath12 magnetic scattering is allowed.@xcite these facts explain why the experimental spectrum for the @xmath142 shows structures at the @xmath5 edge , contrary to the @xmath143 reflection and to the @xmath144 and @xmath145 reflections for both polarization conditions .",
    "notice that these results had been already derived with similar methods .",
    "@xcite    these remarks do not apply for qq and dq tensors .",
    "they always contribute , for all the investigated reflections , in both @xmath12 and @xmath11 channels , except at some very specific azimuthal angles . at the k edge",

    "we performed such calculations for the crystal and magnetic structures given in table i. thus , we do not neglect the small @xmath147 value but we shall see that the conclusion given in the previous subsection is not modified .",
    "the potential is calculated using a superposition of atomic densities obtained from an atomic , self - consistent hartree - fock calculation , with a @xmath148 , spin 1 , configuration .",
    "the mst approach is used with different cluster radii from 3.0 up to 7.2  , ie , from a @xmath149 molecule to a cluster containing 153 atoms .",
    "we find that , in order to get the shoulder at 5475 ev in both xanes and @xmath142 spectra , as well as the 5487 ev shoulder in the @xmath142 , we need the biggest cluster radius ( 7.2  - see fig . [ figure3_conv ] ) .",
    "nevertheless the main features are present for all bragg peaks even for the @xmath149 molecule calculation .",
    "the behaviour of the azimuthal scans against the cluster radius looks more complex .",
    "the agreement improves up to the 4.3  , corresponding to 33 atoms , and then decreases when the cluster radius is further increased .",
    "the reason for this is discussed below . for the moment we keep the 4.3  radius and compare such energy and azimuthal spectra with the experimental ones , as shown in figs .",
    "[ figure4_spectre ] and [ figure5_scan ] .",
    "looking at the spectra shown in fig .",
    "[ figure4_spectre ] , we can claim a satisfactory experiment - theory agreement for the different reflections .",
    "in particular we get the very thin resonance in the @xmath150 energy range at the @xmath144 and @xmath145 peaks for both @xmath12 and @xmath11 polarization conditions and for the @xmath143 reflection .",
    "the broad intensity in the @xmath5 energy range in the @xmath142 is also reproduced .",
    "the intensity ratio between @xmath12 and @xmath11 channels and between the various reflections are also quite good considering the difficulties on both experimental and theoretical sides , even if for the @xmath151 reflection an extra factor improves the agreement with the experiment .",
    "note that , differently from all other reflections , the @xmath142 can contain some non - resonant component not taken into account in our calculation .",
    "moreover , a non - zero offset seems to be present at @xmath143 on the experimental side , and this is probably responsible for the discrepancy in the corresponding energy and azimuthal scans .",
    "the azimuthal scans , shown in fig .",
    "[ figure5_scan ] , are reasonable for all @xmath11 reflections .",
    "only the @xmath151 is much less satisfying : yet , the corresponding data belong to the first experiment ( ref . , while the others belong to ref . ) , and this does not allow to be sure about the relative intensity as in the other cases . finally , we are also able to reproduce the @xmath126 and @xmath152 periodicity , expected from the low symmetry of the compound , for the @xmath12 and @xmath11 channels , respectively .",
    "we judge the agreement between theory and experiment quite satisfactory .",
    "indeed the interference between the dd , dq and qq parts makes the problem really tricky .",
    "foe example , @xmath153 orbitals are far more delocalized than @xmath10 ones . for this reason they react in a different way to the core hole screening . in a first approximation @xmath10 states",
    "are more shifted towards lower energy than @xmath153 states .",
    "thus , the dq terms , which probe the hybridization between @xmath153 and @xmath10 orbitals , are strongly influenced by the details of the electronic structure around the photo - absorbing ion . if we consider that v@xmath0o@xmath1 is a strongly correlated electron system , with a quantum - entangled ground - state wave function,@xcite we find quite surprising that we have reached such a good agreement in the @xmath146 energy region with a one - electron calculation .",
    "our idea is that this can help understanding which features can be explained in terms of an independent particle approach and which can not ( see below ) .",
    "note that the localization of the @xmath10 orbitals also explains why the azimuthal scans look better when the calculations are performed using the smaller 4.3  cluster radius . to end this discussion",
    "we stress that energy spectra profiles around 5464 ev are very sensitive to the azimuthal angle and , vice - versa , azimuthal profiles are very sensitive to the energy .",
    "this is due to the fact that qq and dq components have both strong ( and different ) angular and energy dependence .",
    "there are some angles where the calculated profiles appear doubled , with about 1 ev between the two peaks .",
    "for instance , this is what happens at the experimental azimuth of the @xmath154 energy spectrum : a simple shoulder appears at 5465 ev , well described by our calculation .",
    "finally , we want to comment about the two papers ( by lovesey _",
    "_ @xcite and by tanaka.@xcite ) that have already pointed out the magnetic origin of the @xmath3odd reflections .",
    "these works disagree on the physical mechanism of the signal , as for tanaka only dq terms contribute , while lovesey and coworkers attribute the signal to a pure qq reflection .",
    "our results on this point show that both dq and qq channels can contribute to the global intensity depending on the reflections ( whether @xmath155odd or @xmath155even ) and on the azimuthal angle ( see fig .",
    "[ figure6_dp ] ) . at the prepeak energy , e=5465 ev",
    ", the dq term represents the strongest contribution for the @xmath144 and @xmath145 reflections , even if the qq term is not completely negligeable . for the @xmath143 , on the contrary",
    ", the qq contribution is clearly the dominating one .",
    "finally , it is interesting to note that for the @xmath142 reflection the dd term plays the major role even at the @xmath146 energies .",
    "anyway the qq contribution has always a non - negligeable influence on the total signal . comparing our findings with those of refs .",
    "we can state that there are no strict extinction rules regarding dq and qq terms for all these reflections .",
    "nonetheless , the main contribution to @xmath3odd , @xmath155odd reflections comes from the dq channel ( as in ref . ) , while the main term in @xmath3odd , @xmath155even reflections is of qq origin ( as in ref . ) .",
    "such a tensor analysis allows also to identify a feature that is not correclty described by our one - electron calculations , ie , the direction of the magnetic moment .",
    "indeed , a small @xmath156 component ( about @xmath157 the global moment ) is found to contribute to the @xmath155odd signal ( see fig . [ figure6_dp ] ) , contrary to what expected by our previous theoretical analysis .",
    "this result can be explained by noticing that in order to obtain the correct direction of the magnetic moment a molecular , correlated ground - state wave function is needed,@xcite which is far beyond the possibilities of our monoelectronic approach .      in this subsection",
    ", we analyze the effect of a time - reversal breaking oo on the signal , in order to determine whether it can affect our previous results .",
    "this is not a secondary issue since the original experimental interpretation suggested that the ( 111)-monoclinic reflection was due to the oo@xcite and a big controversy around this point arose in the literature.@xcite the reason why we focus on a `` time - reversal breaking '' oo is that , for @xmath3odd , the signal is proportional to @xmath158 , as clear from eq .",
    "( [ eq_t ] ) , so that a non - magnetic signal is allowed only when the time - reversal symmetry is broken .",
    "this is obtained , for example , when v@xmath159 and v@xmath160 have a different orbital occupancy,@xcite and we call such a situation time - reversal breaking oo . different types of orbitally - ordered ground states have been suggested in the literature,@xcite but none of them possesses such a feature . as a consequence ,",
    "non - magnetic signals at the ( 111)@xmath161 reflection are not expected , unless some _ ad hoc _ hypoteses are made , as recognized in the discussion of sec .",
    "vii.d of ref .",
    "one possible way to get a signal of oo origin is to consider the first excited state found in ref .",
    "[ ] , which has a magnetoelectric ( me ) symmetry .",
    "it is very close to the ground state ( @xmath162 mev ) and , because of this , it could be partly occupied . independently of this , if we consider the two maximal me subgroups of the full space groups , ie , p2/a ( with symmetry elements @xmath163 , @xmath164 , @xmath165 , @xmath166 ) and p2/a ( with symmetry elements @xmath163 , @xmath164 , @xmath167 , @xmath168 ) , it is in principle possible to get a non - magnetic signal at the ( 111)@xmath161 reflection .",
    "in fact , in both cases there are two subgroups of four ions whose electronic densities have anisotropies not connected by time - reversal nor any other symmetry operation .",
    "consider , for example , the case of p2/a , that could be responsible for non - reciprocal dichroism@xcite : the two groups of atoms ( @xmath169 ) and ( @xmath108 , @xmath170 , @xmath110 , @xmath171 ) are independent and the structure factor , eq .",
    "[ eq_t ] , becomes    @xmath172    the analogous of eq .",
    "[ eq_d ] for reflections with @xmath3odd is now :    @xmath173    thus , the breakdown of time - reversal symmetry , with the introduction of the two asf @xmath133 and @xmath174 , has made possible also non - magnetic scattering , through the real part of the tensor components .",
    "notice that , due to the magnetic space group , both magnetic and non - magnetic scattering can in principle interfere at particular polarization conditions and reflections .    in order to calculate the signal explicitly",
    ", we need to express the orbital wave functions of v@xmath175 and v@xmath176 ions . starting from the orbital occupancy of refs . , we get , in the reference frame of fig .",
    "[ fig_1 ] :    @xmath177    @xmath178    from this orbital occupancy , we can calculate the electron density .",
    "then , solving poisson s equation , we get the coulomb potential .",
    "the energy - dependent exchange - correlation potential is then obtained with conventional procedures.@xcite the calculation of the asf is performed for the @xmath131 and @xmath108 atoms with the fdm option .",
    "we kept a rather small cluster radius ( 3.0  ) , but included the oxygen octahedra as well as the first shell of four vanadium neighbors .",
    "the asf of the other atoms are then deduced by means of the magnetic symmetries of table i for the two separate subgroups ( see also ref . [ ] , sec .",
    "vii.d , for a derivation ) and the total scattering amplitude is obtained using eq .",
    "( [ eq_f ] ) .",
    "our results for the @xmath179 reflection are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_2 ] . as in the experiment,@xcite",
    "a structure is obtained at the 3d - energy level . yet , a much bigger signal is present at the 4p edge where the experimental intensity shows no features .",
    "such a disagreement is the proof that the oo can not be responsible of the signal : the time - reversal breaking oo makes the @xmath180 reflection allowed not only at the 3d - energy level , but also at the 4p - energies .",
    "note that this result remains valid for any time - reversal breaking oo , not only the one proposed in eq .",
    "( [ eq_phi ] ) , as should have been qualitatively expected .",
    "indeed , it has already been shown@xcite that the 3d-4p hybridization , even if small , must give a contribution to the dipolar k edge signal . in fact",
    ", previous numerical simulations in another compound , lamno@xmath1 , have shown that the effect of a symmetry - breaking oo of 3d orbitals produces a signal also at the 4p - energy levels . in this latter case",
    "the contribution coming from the jahn - teller distortion overwhelms the oo signal .",
    "however in the present case , since v@xmath175 and v@xmath176 have the same local distortion , such a signal should have been detected , as clear from our numerical simulation shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_2 ] .",
    "thus , the experimental evidence of absence of any signal at the 4p energies proves two facts : first , there is no time - reversal breaking oo ; second , the ( 111)@xmath161 can not be due to oo .",
    "a direct consequence of the previous analysis is that no magnetoelectric s ubgroups are compatible with the ( 111)@xmath161 energy scan , as they all break the time - reversal symmetry , in keeping with the negative experimental evidence for magnetoelectricity in v@xmath0o@xmath1.@xcite this strongly supports the results of ref .",
    "notice that a previous study@xcite on the same reflection in v@xmath0o@xmath1 ended up with the conclusion that the oo was responsible of the signal .",
    "unfortunately that calculation was performed only around the 3d - energy range , where the agreement in the azimuthal scan was quite good and the big feature at the 4p energies was not detected .",
    "the lesson to be drawn from this fact is that the azimuthal scan around the diffraction vector is not always a fundamental feature in determining the origin of the reflection . in fact , it usually reflects more the geometry than the electronic properties of the material .",
    "this is a rather general comment , not limited to v@xmath0o@xmath1 : when there are only one or two _ ab initio _ independent factors ( the tensor components ) , the angular properties are much more determined by the geometry ( ie , the symmetries ) than by the dynamics ( ie , the relative weight of the radial matrix elements ) . in this situation only the combined analysis of both energy and azimuthal scans is a reliable tool to investigate the electronic origin of rxs phenomena .",
    "the main results of the present paper can be inferred from the conclusions of the last two subsections discussing the results appeared in the literature . in fact , up to now , it was possible to classify the interpretations of the forbidden bragg reflections with @xmath3odd and @xmath155odd along two main lines of thought : those who explained such reflections in terms of orbital ordering , both associated@xcite or not@xcite with a reduction of the magnetic symmetry , and those who were inclined to a magnetic origin.@xcite a third explanation , that of the antiferroquadrupolar ordering proposed in ref .",
    "[ ] had already been ruled out in ref .",
    "[ ] . whether the former or the latter interpretations were correct , was not simple to decide on the basis of the azimuthal scans , only . in fact , such scans , for a given multipolar channel , measure the crystal symmetry , rather than the electronic origin of the reflections .",
    "the proof of such a statement is that three different mechanisms ( magnetic in the qq channel@xcite , magnetic in the dq channel@xcite and non - magnetic , via orbital ordering@xcite ) gave all a rather good agreement in the azimuthal scan at the pre - k edge .",
    "what definitively rules out the oo origin of such reflections is the energy scan shown in fig .",
    "6 . as noted previously , a direct consequence of this result is that no reduction of the magnetic space group @xmath115 is present .",
    "@xcite    the second important result of the present paper lies in the fact that we were able to make a complete _ ab - initio _ analysis of all @xmath3odd reflections , starting from the crystal and magnetic structure , only .",
    "we showed that their origin ( whether dd , dq or qq ) strongly depends on the kind of reflection ( ie , @xmath155even or @xmath155odd ) , photon energy and azimuthal angle . for @xmath155odd ,",
    "the dq channel is predominant , in keeping with the cluster calculations of tanaka.@xcite in spite of this particular agreement , we believe that it is important to stress that our approach goes beyond the cluster calculations performed in ref .",
    "[ ] as well as the simple fitting procedure of ref .",
    "[ ] . in fact only by means of an _",
    "ab - initio _ procedure it is possible to cover all the main experimental evidence , ie , the azimuthal behaviour , the energy profiles , and the order of magnitude of the intensity , that is well in keeping with the rough estimate given in ref .",
