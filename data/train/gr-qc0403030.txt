    "perturbations of black holes are dominated , over intermediate timescales , by characteristic modes known as quasinormal modes .",
    "they are similar to normal modes of a closed system , but since the field can fall into the black hole or radiate to infinity , the modes decay and the corresponding frequencies are complex @xcite .",
    "they have been extensively studied in asymptotically flat spacetimes and good reviews on the topic can be found in @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the study of quasinormal modes in anti - de sitter space was first done in @xcite .",
    "more recently quasinormal frequencies have been investigated in the context of string theory in anti - de sitter space @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "there is a suggestion , known as @xmath1 correspondence , that string theory in anti - de sitter space is equivalent to a conformal field theory in one dimension fewer @xcite . in the framework of this conjecture the study of @xmath0 black holes",
    "has a direct interpretation in terms of the dual conformal field theory on its boundary .",
    "the duality predicts that the retarded @xmath5 correlation functions are in one to one correspondence with green s functions on anti - de sitter space with appropriate boundary conditions @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "furthermore , as mentioned in @xcite , it is assumed that a large static black hole in @xmath0 space corresponds to a thermal state in the @xmath5 on the boundary .",
    "perturbing the black hole is equivalent to perturbing this thermal state .",
    "the perturbed system is expected , at late times , to approach equilibrium exponentially with a characteristic time - scale .",
    "this time - scale is inversely proportional to the imaginary part of the poles of the correlators of the perturbation operator .",
    "it seems that these relaxation time - scales are quite complicated to calculate in the @xmath5 , therefore their computation is conveniently replaced by the evaluation of the quasinormal frequencies in the @xmath0 bulk space . in @xcite and @xcite , the authors went beyond the scalar perturbation treated in @xcite and they considered electromagnetic and gravitational perturbations . in one of the most recent works on the subject , berti and kokkotas @xcite confirm and extend previous results on scalar , electromagnetic and gravitational perturbations of static @xmath0 black holes and analyse , for the first time , reissner - nordstrom anti - de sitter black holes and calculate their quasinormal frequencies .",
    "the interaction of a dirac field with a black hole has been studied by finster and his collaborators in a series of papers . while they have found stable particle - like solutions in the einstein - dirac- maxwell system @xcite , they have also proved the non - existence of time - periodic solutions in various black hole space - times @xcite .",
    "this means that dirac particles , including electrons and neutrinos , can not remain on a periodic orbit around a black hole . in @xcite",
    ", they also showed that there are no spherical symmetric black hole solutions in the einstein - dirac - maxwell system other than the reissner - nordstrm one .",
    "this suggests that if a cloud of dirac particles undergoes gravitational collapse , the fermionic particles either vanish inside the event horizon of a black hole or escape to infinity .",
    "the quasinormal frequencies related to the evolution of a massless dirac field in a schwarzschild black hole space - time , were studied in @xcite .",
    "the quasinormal modes of the reissner - nordstrm de sitter black hole for dirac fields were studied by using the pshl - teller potential approximation in ref . @xcite . in this paper",
    "we are interested in the analysis of the modes of vibration of a massless dirac field in a schwarzschild anti - de sitter background space and it is for this reason that we compute the related quasinormal mode frequencies .",
    "this calculation is relevant to the @xmath1 correspondence between m - theory on @xmath6 and @xmath7 super yang - mills theory on @xmath3 , and it also serves to fill in a gap in the literature , which , in @xmath0 spaces , has only been concerned with particles of integral spin @xmath8",
    "the metric for a schwarzschild anti - de sitter black hole can be written as @xmath9 with @xmath10 where the parameters @xmath11 , and @xmath12 represent the black hole mass , and the negative cosmological constant , respectively .",
    "the dirac equation in a general background space - time can be written , according to @xcite , as @xmath13\\psi=0.\\ ] ] here , @xmath14 are the dirac matrices , @xmath15 while @xmath16 are the pauli matrices , @xmath17 the four - vectors @xmath18 represent the inverse of the tetrad @xmath18 defined by the metric @xmath19 as , @xmath20 with @xmath21 being the minkowski metric .",

    "@xmath41 equations [ di2 ] can be written in the simplified matrix form @xmath42 these equations can be thought of as equations referring to the radial functions @xmath43 or @xmath44 depending on the original choice made in the ansatz of equation [ c5an ] . on the other hand",
    "it can be proved that the radial differential equations related to the two different sets of functions are exactly the same . in other words",
    ", we have a unique equation for @xmath45 and another equation for @xmath46 .",
    "for this reason we will avoid from now on specifying if we are referring to the spin up or spin down components when talking about @xmath45 and @xmath46 and we will simply call these functions @xmath47 and @xmath48 . consequently the two decoupled equations can be expressed in the form @xmath49 with @xmath50 in a similar way to the integer spin case in @xcite , the two potentials @xmath51 and @xmath52 , are super - symmetric partners derived from the same super - potential . in the asymptotically flat case , it has been shown that potentials related in this way possess the same spectra of quasinormal mode frequencies @xcite . in the @xmath0 case , this is still true provided that the boundary conditions are mapped between the two cases in a consistent way .",
    "we shall concentrate just on eq .",
    "[ even ] with potential @xmath51 in evaluating the quasinormal mode frequencies in the next section .",
    "in this section we evaluate the quasinormal frequencies for the massless dirac field using the frobenius series solution method .",
    "we start defining @xmath53 as @xmath54 where @xmath55 .",
    "this implies that the function @xmath56 in [ even ] can be re - written as @xmath57 .",
    "next , rescale @xmath47 as @xmath58 which allows us to scale out the behaviour of the function at the black hole event horizon .",

    "we obtain @xmath76 expanding the coefficients of equation [ tredici ] as taylor series around @xmath77 , which is the same than performing a series expansion around the black hole event horizon , we obtain @xmath78 where @xmath79 with @xmath80 @xmath81 and @xmath82 the differential equation in @xmath59 can be now solved by series by exploiting frobenius method , which consists in looking for a solution of the form @xmath83 the main difference between the spin @xmath84 case and the integer spin case is the non - polynomial term @xmath85 .",
    "this function can be taylor expanded as @xmath86 leaving aside for the moment the problem of deriving the coefficients of this last series .",
    "the two possible values for the index @xmath87 at @xmath77 of our series solution [ c5s ] can be easily calculated and they are given by @xmath88 and @xmath89 .",

    "having separated dirac equations in anti - de sitter schwarzschild black hole background spaces and obtained two radial second order differential equations , [ even ] and [ odd ] , we have argued that those two equations are related .",
    "they can be physically identified as the equations governing the axial and polar perturbations of the dirac field , respectively .",
    "we have also mentioned the fact that the two potentials [ v1 ] and [ v2 ] possess the same quasinormal mode frequency spectra if the boundary conditions are mapped consistently .    according to cooper @xcite , equation [ even ] describes axial perturbations and equation [ odd ] describes polar perturbations of the dirac field .",
    "suppose we are interested in investigating further the @xmath1 conjecture and want to relate the spinor field and its quasinormal frequencies to the calculation of the correlation functions on the boundary conformal field theory .",
    "more precisely , let us suppose that we are interested in evaluating the correlators of a polar quantity in the @xmath5 on the boundary , which corresponds to the polar part of the spinor field in the bulk of @xmath0 space - time .",
    "accordingly we must set the _ axial _ spinor field perturbation to vanish on the boundary .    in terms of what we have done until now",
    ", we must take our series solution [ diciassette ] to the axial equation [ even ] , and impose on this dirichlet boundary conditions @xmath121 as @xmath122 .",
    "taking the limit of the left hand side gives us the identity @xmath123 this is an implicit equation for the computation of quasinormal frequencies related to the spinor field .",
    "the computer program which performs the numerical calculation is organized in the following way .",
    "an independent routine evaluates the coefficients @xmath95 associated to the taylor expansion of @xmath85 .",
    "these results are then exploited within a recursive routine which iterates the recurrence relation to evaluate the coefficients @xmath106 of the series solution .",
    "finally , an ordinary newton - raphson root - finding routine seeks for solutions to the equation [ mainbc ] .",
    "the choice of boundary conditions is related to the axial or polar character of the spinor field at infinity and to its interpretation in terms of the @xmath1 conjecture . on the other hand",
    "the consistency of the boundary conditions can be checked by the shape of the effective potential in the differential equation [ even ] we are solving .    in fig .",
    "[ figu1 ] ,    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     we list the first ten quasinormal mode frequencies corresponding to massless spinor perturbations of intermediate schwarzschild - ads black holes @xmath124 .",
    "the values of the frequencies are shown for @xmath125 and @xmath126 . for large values of the overtone number @xmath93 ,",
    "the modes become evenly spaced and the spacing , which is independent of @xmath127 , is given by @xmath128 once again this is a result that , for the intermediate black hole regime , resembles those obtained in @xcite for different kinds of perturbation fields . in fig .",

    "the parameters @xmath131 and @xmath132 represent , respectively , the black hole surface gravity evaluated at the event horizon and the anti - de sitter radius .",
    "both the real and imaginary parts of the frequencies seem to depend linearly on the black hole surface gravity and therefore on the black hole temperature for @xmath133 .",
    "this is a result that has already been found in @xcite for gravitational perturbations of schwarzschild @xmath0 black holes .",

    "[ fig3 ] and @xmath135 for the plots in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] .    for small black holes",
    "@xmath136 , it is very difficult to evaluate the corresponding quasinormal frequencies , or to go high in mode number .",
    "the error associated in estimating the frequencies in this regime is too high , and we can not be completely sure of the results . in the case of other perturbation fields",
    "@xcite , it was found that small black holes have quasinormal frequencies that are very close to the pure @xmath0 values . in the case of the dirac field considered in this paper , after setting @xmath137 ,",
    "we have been able to evaluate the fundamental frequency , at most , down to the value of @xmath138 ( see table [ table1 ] ) .",
    "further investigations and more powerful numerical tools are needed to outline the behaviour of the spin-@xmath139 frequencies in the limit of @xmath140 .",
    "in this paper we have investigated the quasinormal modes frequencies of a spinor field interacting with a schwarzschild black hole in four dimensional anti - de sitter space - time . after solving the related axial perturbative equation we have imposed on this solution dirichlet boundary conditions and evaluated the corresponding quasinormal frequencies .",
    "this choice of boundary conditions is physically justified in the contest of the @xmath1 correspondence , in which it is suggested to exploit these frequencies in the evaluation of poles of correlation functions associated to the conformal field theory on the boundary .    for large black holes ,",
    "we have numerically confirmed that the imaginary part of the frequency scales with the temperature .",
    "we have also shown that both the real and imaginary components of the frequencies are evenly spaced in mode number .",
    "the spacing between consecutive modes , which is independent of the angular quantum number @xmath127 , behaves as in the case of scalar , electromagnetic and gravitational perturbations .",
    "the quasinormal frequencies have a number of first overtones with pure imaginary parts .    for intermediate black holes",
    ", we have found that both the real and imaginary part of the frequency scale linearly with the surface gravity .",
    "the modes are evenly spaced and the spacing , which is independent of the angular quantum number @xmath127 , resembles the one related to other kinds of perturbations .    our purpose is to extend this project imposing different boundary conditions on the axial or the polar dirac equations .",
    "we could be interested , for instance , in calculating the correlation functions and associated poles of a quantity related to the axial part of the spinor field .",
    "that would suggest we set the polar component of the spinor field perturbation to vanish on the boundary and consequently we could solve either the odd parity differential equation with dirichlet boundary conditions or the even parity equation with mixed boundary conditions due to the transformation theory between polar and axial functions .",
