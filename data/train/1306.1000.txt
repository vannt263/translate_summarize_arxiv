    "the study of gravity waves at the surface of a homogeneous layer of fluid has attracted a lot of interests in a broad range of scientific communities .",
    "we let the reader refer to  @xcite for a comprehensive survey of the state of the art concerning this problem , and its many interesting aspects , and we quickly discuss here some known results and methods , relevant to the present work .",
    "while the equations governing the motion of a homogeneous layer of ideal , incompressible , irrotationnal fluid under the only influence of gravity , that we name _ full euler system _ , are relatively easy to derive , their theoretical study is extremely challenging .",
    "this explains why the rigorous , mathematical analysis of the governing equations is quite recent , and still enjoys present - day improvements from an active community .",
    "in particular , the well - posedness of the cauchy problem outside of the analytical framework has been discussed among others by nalimov  @xcite , yosihara  @xcite , craig  @xcite , wu  @xcite and lannes  @xcite .",
    "such results are regularly improved ( time of existence , regularity of the initial data , _ etc . _ ) ; see  @xcite and references therein .    nevertheless , the solutions of these equations are very difficult to describe , and the relevant hydrodynamic processes are not easily visible in these equations . at this point ,",
    "a classical method is to select an asymptotic regime ( described by dimensionless parameters of the domain and of the flow ) , in which we look for approximate models and hence for approximate solutions .",
    "many such asymptotic models have been derived , going back to the late 19^th^ century .",
    "for example , saint - venant  @xcite derived the classical shallow - water equation , by assuming that the depth of the layer of fluid is small , so that the horizontal velocity across the layer may be averaged as a constant ; while boussinesq  @xcite derived the model which bears his name , describing the propagation of gravity - waves of small amplitude and long wavelength . later on , serre  @xcite and green , naghdi  @xcite introduced a higher order model , which has since been widely used in coastal oceanography , as it takes into account the dispersive effects neglected by the shallow - water ( saint - venant ) model and allows waves of greater amplitude than the boussinesq model .",
    "however , the previously mentioned works are restricted to the formal level , and the rigorous , mathematical justification of asymptotic models received a satisfactory answer only recently .",
    "we say that a model is _ fully justified _",
    "( using the terminology of  @xcite ) if the cauchy problem for both the full euler system and the asymptotic model is well - posed for a given class of initial data , and over the relevant time scale ; and if the solutions with corresponding initial data remain close .",
    "the full justification of a system ( s ) follows from :    * ( consistency ) one proves that families of solutions to the asymptotic model , existing and controlled over the relevant time scale satisfies the full euler system up to a small residual . *",
    "( existence ) one proves that solutions of the full euler system and solutions of the the model  ( s ) with corresponding initial data do exist . * ( convergence ) one proves that the solutions of the full euler system , and the ones of the asymptotic model , with corresponding initial data , remain close over the relevant time scale .",
    "a result of alvarez - samaniego and lannes  @xcite provides the existence and uniqueness of a solution to the full euler system over the relevant time scale , uniformly with respect to the dimensionless parameters at stake , as well as a stability result with respect to perturbation of the equations . as a consequence ,",
    "any consistent and well - posed asymptotic model is automatically justified in the sense described above .",
    "this strategy may be applied to the ( quasilinear , hyperbolic ) shallow - water model , to various boussinesq models  @xcite and to green - naghdi models  @xcite .",
    "we let the reader refer to  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* appendix c ) for a reader s digest of the numerous known results on this aspect .",
    "all the aforementioned models coincide at the lower order of precision as a simple wave equation , which in dimension @xmath1 predicts that any initial perturbation of the free surface will split up into two counter - propagating waves .",
    "an important family of models is dedicated to the precise study of the evolution of one of the two waves when higher order terms are included .",
    "the most famous example of such model is the korteweg - de vries@xcite equation , but various extensions and generalizations have been proposed ; see  @xcite and references therein .",
    "again , the full justification of such models is recent : see  @xcite .",
    "all the aforementioned works are concerned with the case of a single layer of homogeneous fluid .",
    "such assumption of may seem too crude for applications to oceanographic problems , as variations of salinity induce variation of density . in the present work , we are interested in the simplest setting that models such a variation of density : we consider a system of two layers of homogeneous , immiscible fluid , and we are interested in the evolution of the interface between the two layers . a considerable amount of interests has been given to such bi - fluidic systems ; see  @xcite for a comprehensive review of the ins and outs on this topic .",
    "the governing equations of the bi - fluidic systems share many aspects and properties of the aforementioned water - wave system , and its study has often been carried out in parallel . in particular , one can derive asymptotic models in analogy with the ones presented above .",
    "it is out of the scope of this introduction to present an exhaustive review of all the different models , as many settings are of interests . here , and in the present work , we restrict ourselves to the case of a surface delimited by a flat , rigid lid ( as deformation of the surface is in practice small compared to the deformation of the interface ) , and to the so - called shallow water / shallow water regime . in this regime ,",
    "the two layers are assumed to be of comparable depth , and both small when compared to the typical horizontal wavelength of the flow . in that case , the models corresponding to the shallow water and boussinesq systems have been derived in  @xcite , and justified in the sense of consistency in  @xcite ( where , incidentally , a much larger range of scaling regimes are studied ) .",
    "green - naghdi type models where obtained in the one - dimensional case in  @xcite , and in the two - dimensional in  @xcite .",
    "an extensive study of scalar models has been provided by one of the authors in  @xcite .",
    "let us note that all the aforementioned works are restricted to the case of a flat bottom , contrarily to the present work .    as attested earlier , bi - fluidic models have a similar structure as the ones in the one - layer case . as a matter of fact , one recovers the latter from the former when we assume that the mass density of the top layer is zero .",
    "yet a few remarkable differences arise , that originate interesting questions and mathematical challenges . among them",
    ", we would like to emphasize    1 .   _",
    "the role of surface tension . _ contrarily to the water wave case , the cauchy problem for the full euler system is ill - posed in sobolev spaces in the absence of surface tension .",
    "however , surface tension is very small in practical cases , so that its effect is systematically negligible in all present asymptotic models . in  @xcite",
    ", lannes shows that a small amount of surface tension is sufficient to guarantee the well - posedness over times consistent with observations , provided that a stability estimate holds ; see the somewhat more precise description in section  [ sec : wpfulleuler ] .",
    "absence of stability result .",
    "_ an equivalent result as the stability result ( with respect to perturbations of the equation ) for the full euler system as described above is not known in the bi - fluidic case , partly due to the difficulties described in the previous item . in order to deal with this ,",
    "a strategy consists in proving such stability result on the model itself .",
    "thus the full justification of the model is a consequence of its well - posedness , and the full euler system s consistency with the asymptotic model ( and not the other way around ) .",
    "this strategy has been applied by the authors in  @xcite , and we recall these results in section  [ sec : serre ] .",
    "3 .   _ a non - local operator . _",
    "as noticed in  @xcite , shallow water models for internal waves with a rigid lid contain a non - local operator , which involves in particular the projection into the space of gradient functions ; see definition  [ defv ] in section  [ sec : gn ] .",
    "this operator appears only in the case @xmath0 , and under the rigid - lid configuration ( see  @xcite for shallow water / shallow water models with a free surface ) .",
    "the precise effect and meaning of this non - local term is yet to be fully understood .",
    "4 .   _ a critical - ratio .",
    "_ there exists a critical ratio for the depth of the two layers for which the first order ( quadratic ) nonlinearities vanish ; @xmath2 in , _",
    "e.g. _ ,  .",
    "this phenomenon does not occur in the one - layer case , and motivates a precise study of unidirectional asymptotic models with stronger nonlinearities than in the classical long wave regime , and especially in the camassa - holm regime , for which first order dispersion and nonlinearities are formally of same magnitude in the critical case .",
    "this study has been carried out in  @xcite , completed in  @xcite , and the results are presented in section  [ sec : scalar ] .    in the present work ,",
    "we report and complete recent mathematical results concerning the bi - fluidic system under the rigid lid assumption ; from the well - posedness of the full euler system to the justification of various models in the shallow water regime .",
    "our aim is to provide a unified and comprehensive exposition of the existing theory .",
    "the above concerns and remarks appear spontaneously in the course of the study .",
    "we would like to mention the work of saut , which pursues similar objectives than ourselves in  @xcite .",

    "this result , in dimension @xmath0 , and allowing non - flat topography , is new to our knowledge .",

    "altogether , the governing equations of our problem are given by the following @xmath88 where @xmath89 denotes the unit upward normal vector at the surface at stake .",
    "the next step consists in _ nondimensionalizing the system_. thanks to an appropriate scaling , the two - layer full euler system   can be written in dimensionless form .",

    "@xmath91 ) be the maximum amplitude of the deformation of the interface .",
    "we denote by @xmath92 a characteristic horizontal length ( that we assume to be identical in any of the directions if @xmath0 ; see  @xcite for a treatment of the anisotropic case when @xmath0 ) , say the wavelength of the interface .",
    "then the typical velocity of small propagating internal waves ( or wave celerity ) is given by @xmath93 consequently , we introduce the dimensionless variables as the reference vertical length .",

    "earlier results showed that the problem was ill - posed in the absence of surface tension , outside of the analytic framework .",
    "it was subsequently proved that taking into account the surface tension restores the local well - posedness of the equations , but with a very small existence time of the solution when the surface tension is small , which is the case in the oceanographic setting .",
    "it has to be noted that none of the asymptotic models presented in the following sections ( and as a matter of fact , no asymptotic model known to us ) share the same property , and that the surface tension term could be withdrawn from the equations ( by setting @xmath116 ) without hurting their well - posedness .",
    "the reason for this apparent paradox is that the positive role of surface tension is to regularize kelvin - helmholtz instabilities that appear at high frequencies , while the main part of the wave , which is captured by the asymptotic models , is located at low frequencies and is thus unaffected by surface tension .    in  @xcite",

    "<S> anterior models such as the shallow water and boussinesq systems , as well as unidirectional models of camassa - holm type , are shown to descend from a broad green - naghdi model , that we introduce and justify in the sense of consistency . </S>",
    "<S> contrarily to earlier works , our green - naghdi model allows a non - flat topography , and horizontal dimension @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> its derivation follows directly from classical results concerning the one - layer case , and we believe such strategy may be used to construct interesting models in different regimes than the shallow - water / shallow - water studied in the present work . </S>"
