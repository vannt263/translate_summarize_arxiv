    "this paper is dedicated to manuel cardona , on the occasion of his 75th birthday .",
    "manuel cardona is world - famous not only for being an outstanding and creative experimentalist , but also for having deep theoretical insights , in particular into the band structures of solids .",
    "his book  @xcite with peter yu on fundamentals of semiconductors , now a classic of solid - state physics , devotes a large part to the explanation of theory in simple , accessible language . for our contribution to the present _ festschrift _",
    ", we have chosen a topic off the main line of this special issue , but we hope that manuel and others will appreciate our effort to follow his example and make a complicated problem more transparent .",
    "we started working on superconductivity in the iron pnictides , and the later discovered chalchogenides , not only because we felt that this phenomenon would create the same kind of excitement as high - temperature superconductivity in cuprates had done two decades earlier , an excitement that the senior author had experienced under the leadership of manuel cardona , but also because we like many other researchers had hoped that this would provide a shortcut to understanding high - temperature superconductivity .",
    "in fact , these new iron - based superconductors and the cuprates ( as well as heavy - fermion systems ) share the most important property of having a superconducting phase close to or even coexisting with an antiferromagnetic phase . in the iron - based superconductors , however ,",
    "the latter is metallic rather than insulating , and these superconductors may therefore lack the complications of strong - correlation mott - hubbard physics . in both iron - based superconductors and cuprates ,",
    "phonons seem to play a minor role for the coupling , although the debate is still alive  @xcite .",
    "after two and a half years with enormous theoretical and experimental effort , published in over 2000 papers ,  @xcite it has become clear that , although superconductivity in the iron - based superconductors could turn out to be simpler than in the cuprates , the former are in many respects more complicated than the latter their band structures , for example , are considerably more intricate and our present understanding is far from complete .    trying to swim upwards through this cascade of papers has blinded at least the senior author and made him focus on finally publishing our own results . encouraged by manuel cardona , to whom this could never have happened , we now take the opportunity to publish a pedagogical , self - contained account of the band structures and itinerant magnetism in the iron - based superconductors , stressing the role of symmetry and , as far as possible , reducing problems to that of diagonalizing a @xmath17 matrix .",
    "the first report of superconductivity in an iron pnictide , specifically in f - doped laofep below 5@xmath18k in 2006  @xcite , was hardly noticed and only two years later , when f - doped laofeas was reported to superconduct below 28 k , the potential of iron pnictides as high - temperature superconducing materials was realized .",
    "@xcite following this discovery , more than 50 new iron superconductors with the same basic structure were discovered  @xcite with @xmath19 reaching up to 56 k.  @xcite this structure is shown in fig .",
    "[ figlayer ] for the case of laofeas .",
    "the common motive is a planar feas layer in which the fe atoms form a square lattice , tetrahedrally coordinated with as atoms placed alternatingly above and below the hollow centers of the squares .",
    "instead of as , the ligand could be another pnictogen ( p ) or a chalcogen ( x = se or te ) , but for simplicity , in this paper we shall refer to it as as .",
    "these superconductors are divided in four main families depending on their 3d crystal structure  @xcite : the iron chalcogenides are simple tetragonal ( st ) with the fex layers stacked on top of each other ( @xmath20 family ) .",
    "the iron pnictides have the feas layers separated by alkali metals ( @xmath21 family ) , or by rare - earth oxygen / fluoride blocking layers ( @xmath22 family as in fig.@xmath18[figlayer ] ) , in st stacking , or by alkali - earth metals ( @xmath23 family ) in body - centered tetragonal ( bct ) stacking .",
    "the layered structure of simple tetragonal laofeas .",
    "the 3d primitive cell contains one fe@xmath6as@xmath6 and one la@xmath6o@xmath6 layer , each containing three sheets : a square planar fe ( red ) or o ( blue ) sheet sandwiched between two planar as ( green ) or la ( yellow ) sheets .",
    "the coordination of fe with as , or o with la , is tetrahedral . @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the vectors between the fe - fe or o - o nearest neighbors ( separated by @xmath27=285@xmath18pm ) and @xmath28 and @xmath29 are those between as - as or la - la nearest neighbors in the same sheet .",
    "the directions of those vectors we shall denote @xmath30and @xmath31 . ]    iron - based superconductors share some general physical properties , although the details are often specific to families , or even to compounds . with the exception of lifeas ,",
    "the undoped compounds are spin - density wave ( sdw ) metals at low temperature with the fe spins ordered anti - ferromagnetically between nearest neighbors in the one direction and ferromagnetically in the other , thus forming stripe or double - stripe ( fete ) patterns .",
    "the values of the measured magnetic moments range from 0.4@xmath32/fe in laofeas  @xcite , to @xmath33 in bafe@xmath7as@xmath6 compounds , to over 2@xmath34 in doped tellurides .",
    "fesc : paglionegreene , fesc : johnston , fesc : otherreviews at a temperature above or at the neel temperature , which is of order 100@xmath18k , there is a tetragonal - to - orthorhombic phase transition in which the in - plane lattice constant contracts by 0.5 - 1.0% in the direction of ferromagnetic order .",
    "superconductivity sets in when the magnetic order is suppressed by pressure , electron or hole doping , or even isovalent doping on the as site , and at a much lower temperature .",
    "both superconductivity and magnetism are found to depend crucially on the details of the crystal structure ; for example is it often observed that the highest @xmath19s occur in those compounds where the feas@xmath4 tetrahedra are regular .",
    "@xcite critical temperatures range from a few k in iron - phosphides to 56 k in smofeas .",
    "the variations in the phonon spectra are , however , small and seem uncorrelated with @xmath35 this , together with the proximity of magnetism and superconductivity in the phase diagram , was a first indication that the superconductivity is unconventional .",
    "a stronger indication seems to come from the symmetry of the superconducting gap , which is currently a strongly debated issue .",
    "nodes depending on the sample , and on the experimental technique , multiple gaps with @xmath36 symmetry and various degrees of anisotropy but also of nodes have been reported .",
    "@xcite it now seems as if the gap symmetry is not universal , but material specific in these compounds .",
    "current understanding of the basic electronic structure has been reached mainly by angle - resolved photoemission ( arpes )  , quantum oscillation , and de - haas - van - alphen ( dhva ) experiments   in combination with density - functional ( dft ) calculations .",
    "all parent compounds have the electronic configuration fe @xmath3 and are metallic . in",
    "all known cases , the fermi surface ( fs ) in the paramagnetic tetragonal phase has two concentric hole pockets with dominant @xmath37 character and two equivalent electron pockets with respectively @xmath38 and @xmath39 character .",
    "a third hole pocket may also be present , but its character , @xmath40 or @xmath41 as well as the sizes and shapes of all sheets , vary among different families of compounds , and , within the same family , with chemical composition and pressure . in all stoichiometric compounds ,",
    "the volumes of the hole sheets compensate those of the electron sheets .",
    "the magnetically stripe - ordered phase remains metallic , but the fs becomes much smaller and takes the shape of a propeller  @xcite plus , possibly , tiny pockets.@xcite    given the strong tendency to magnetism , and the low value of the calculated electron - phonon interaction ,  @xcite spin fluctuations are the strongest candidate for mediating the superconductivity .",
    "alternative scenarios have been proposed , in which superconductivity is due to magnetic interactions in the strong - coupling limit , polarons , or orbital fluctuations .",
    "@xcite models for spin fluctuations are based on the weak - coupling , itinerant limit , with superconductivity related to the presence of strong nesting between hole and electron sheets of the paramagnetic fermi surface , which is also held responsible for the instability towards magnetism .",
    "@xcite this possibility has been investigated using more ore less sound models of the band structure , combined with different many - body methods ( rpa , flex , frg , model me calculations ) which do seem to agree on a picture with competing instabilities towards magnetism and superconductivity .",
    "fesc : mazin : first , lfao : dft : arita , fesc : graser : first , fesc : eremin : first , benfatto08,kuroki09,tesanovic09,ummarino09,wang09,thomale09,thomale10,kemper10,ikeda10,popovic10 the superconducting phase should be characterized by multiple gaps , with @xmath42 and @xmath0 symmetries almost degenerate . modifying the shape and orbital characters of the different sheets of the fermi surface by doping , pressure , or chemistry can influence the leading instability and affect the structure of the gap . as a result , a reasonable , qualitative picture of the materials trend , such as the dependence of @xmath19 and",
    "gap symmetry on the tetrahedral angle , has evolved .",
    "@xcite most experimental evidence seems to support this picture , but several points remain controversial . a badly understood issue is how to include 3d effects , which is particularly serious for the bct @xmath23 compounds .",
    "another problem concerns the magnetism : while it is true that spin - polarized dft ( sdft ) calculations reproduce the correct atomic coordinates and stripe - order of the moment , the magnitude of the moment is , except in doped fete , at least two times larger than what is measured by neutron scattering , or inferred from the gaps measured by arpes ,  @xcite , dhva , and optics ,  @xcite albeit much smaller than the saturation moment of 4 @xmath43/fe . suppressing the too large moments in the calculations will , however , ruin the good agreement for the structure and the phonon spectra .",
    "@xcite this over - estimation of the moment is opposite to what was found 25 years ago for the superconducting cuprates where the sdft gave no moment , but is typical for itinerant magnets close to a magnetic quantum critical point ( qcp ) .",
    "@xcite the magnetic fluctuations in time and space have been described 08nematicorderinfeaskivelson using a localized heisenberg model with competing ferro- and antiferromagnetic interactions between respectively first and second - nearest neighbors , but to reconcile this model with the partly metallic band structure is a problem .",
    "yaresko,0807alulaofeasafsuperexch , weiku,09antropov,10lowmagnbasconesprl another possible solution of the moment problem in sdft is that moments of the predicted size are present , but fluctuate on a time scale faster than what is probed by the experiments .",
    "@xcite in fact , two recent studies of realistic , dft - derived multi - band hubbard models solved in the _ dynamical _ mean - field approximation ( dmft ) show that the magnetism has two different energy scales .",
    "@xcite it is therefore possible that the electronic correlations after all do play a role in these multi - band , multi - orbital materials .",
    "aichhorn , voll09    experiments and calculations have revealed a marked interplay between the details of the band structure and the superconducting properties .",
    "most of these observations are empirical and we feel that there is a need to explain the origin of such details . in this paper , we therefore attempt to give a self - contained , pedagogical description of the paramagnetic and spin - polarized band structures . specifically , we discuss the fe@xmath44 as@xmath45 band - structure topology , causing the pseudogap at @xmath3 as well as numerous dirac cones , the interlayer hopping in the simple - tetragonal and body - centered - tetragonal structures , the spin - spiral band structures , and the band - resolved magnetic energies . in all of this , the covalency between fe@xmath44 and as@xmath45 is found to play a crucial role .",

    "@xcite the crucial role of the as @xmath1 orbitals for the low - energy band structure , the electron bands in particular , and the presence of a @xmath51 pseudogap is emphasized .",

    "[ figbz ] we show the factorization of the bloch waves along the lines and points of high symmetry in the large bz . the high symmetry of the single",
    ", tetragonal layer allows many bands to cross and leads to linear dispersions , and even to dirac cones .",
    "our understanding of this generic band structure of a single layer then allows us to discuss standard dft calculations for specific materials .",
    "this is done in sect.@xmath18[3dbands ] , where we first see that increasing the as height moves an antibonding @xmath52 level down towards the degenerate top of the @xmath53 hole bands , with which it can not cross , and thereby causes the inner , longitudinal band to develop a linear dispersion .",
    "interlayer hopping is shown to proceed mainly via the as @xmath54 orbital and to have a strength and @xmath55-dependence which depends on the material family .",
    "this hopping is strongest for the bct structure where the as atoms in neighboring layers face each other . in st smofeas and for @xmath56at the edge of the 3d bz",
    ", the antibonding @xmath52 level reaches the top of the hole bands and forms a dirac cone together with the longitudinal hole band . in lifeas and fete the dirac point is inside the bz . the interlayer hopping not only causes the as @xmath57-like 2d bands to disperse with @xmath58 but also folds the bands into the conventional , small bz , i.e. it couples @xmath2 and @xmath59 .",

    "the low - moment solution maybe fortuitously resembles the behaviour of the observed moment as a function of doping and @xmath9 .",
    "we then discuss the electronic origin of the magnetic energies and first show how the magnetic energy may be interpreted as the difference between double - counting - corrected magnetic and non - magnetic band - structure energies .",
    "this directly relates the magnetism to the band structure and we specifically look at the origin of the magnetic energy . we find that the magnetic energy gain is caused by the coupling of the paramagnetic @xmath40 hole and @xmath87 electron bands , as well as by that of the @xmath92 parts of the two other electron and hole bands .",
    "the fermi - surface contributions to the magnetic energy are comparatively small .",
    "we can then explain why increasing the distance between the as and fe sheets increases the stripe - ordered moment , and vice versa .    at the end",

    "this interlayer hopping simply modulates the energy of the @xmath147 orbital , @xmath331 now we see something very interesting : for @xmath8 near @xmath332 the upper @xmath219 band has come so close to the top of the @xmath123-centered hole pockets that the inner , _ longitudinal _ band takes the shape of a dirac cone over an energy region of 0.4 ev around the fermi level .",
    "the inner hole cylinder , as well as its radius , thus become warped due to this incipient dirac cone .",
    "this is even more pronounced for smofeas because here , the @xmath219 band lies nearly 0.3 ev lower than in laofeas , in fact so low that the 2d band in the @xmath333 plane is nearly a complete dirac cone at 0.2 @xmath18ev and with slope @xmath334ev@xmath244 ( see expression ( [ dirac ] ) ) . to bring the fermi level up to the cusp would , however , require electron doping beyond 30% .",

    "the band which at @xmath123 has longitudinal @xmath289 character disperses upwards and the other band , which at @xmath123 has @xmath219 character , downwards .",

    "this is in fact the reason for the 2 ev dispersion seen along @xmath300z in the band structure of bafe@xmath6as@xmath6 on the right - hand side of fig.[figlasmba ] . since @xmath358 for bafe@xmath6as@xmath60 the position of this @xmath147-like band is not as low as in fete , but more like in smofeas . at @xmath359",

    "this repulsion is substantial and causes another , but merely incipient dirac point at @xmath325 ev at z. however , as we now depart from the @xmath442 plane , also the @xmath418 band hybridizes with the longitudinal @xmath289 band proportional to @xmath443 and to the horizontal distance from @xmath123 and this causes a dirac cone to be formed at the crossing of the upper @xmath147-like and the degenerate @xmath444 bands at @xmath445 and 0.25@xmath18ev . at the bottom four panels of fig .",

    "[ figba ] , the upper @xmath147-like band moves above the @xmath289 band at @xmath123 to 1.0 ev , whereby the longitudinal branch of the latter curves downwards , like the transversal branch . for @xmath456",
    "the behaviour can be seen near @xmath123 in the four bottom panels : the upper @xmath147-like band is now at 2.1 ev and has no @xmath410 but only @xmath219 character .",
    "the repulsion from this band steepens the longitudinal , inner @xmath289 hole band .",

    "the hole part of the fermi surface thus has a strongly warped , cylindrical sheet , centered around the vertical @xmath64z line ( see fig .",

    "also this cylinder is centered along @xmath300z , but it does not hybridize with the two @xmath123@xmath459cylinders and it is as narrow as the dirac neck of the longitudinal @xmath289 cylinder .",
    "next , we turn to the _ electron _ sheets , which in 2d are the @xmath71 and @xmath128-centered super - ellipses pointing towards @xmath123 ( fig.figbz ) .",
    "they are formed by the @xmath135-like band together with the transverse @xmath137-like band for the @xmath71 sheet and with the transverse @xmath225-like band for the @xmath128 sheet ( see eq.@xmath18([electron ] ) ) .",
    "figs.figpdfatbands and [ figfatfs ] show that the only part which has as @xmath147 character and may therefore disperse with @xmath58 is the one pointing towards @xmath123 .",
    "the corresponding band is the @xmath219 band which we studied above and which at @xmath123 was found to disperse by 3 ev , from 2.1 ev ( @xmath64 ) to @xmath421 ev ( z ) .",
    "being centered at respectively @xmath71 and @xmath128 , the electron cylinders are however far away from @xmath123 , and since the @xmath135 band can have _ no _ @xmath147 character _ at _ @xmath71 and @xmath128 ,",
    "it hardly disperses with @xmath8 there .",
    "but the @xmath147 character increases linearly with the distance @xmath86 from @xmath71 and with the distance @xmath460 from @xmath128 towards @xmath123 , and so does the upwards @xmath8-dispersion . as a consequence ,",
    "the latter is strongest towards @xmath461 and weakest towards z = ( @xmath123,0 ) , where the @xmath219 band eventually bends over and becomes part of the longitudinal @xmath289 band dispersing upwards from z ( see bottom panels of fig.@xmath18[figba ] ) .",
    "this diagonal interlayer coupling ( [ diag ] ) thus modulates the long axis , @xmath462 of the super - ellisoidal cross section such that it becomes minimal towards @xmath64 and maximal towards z ( see fig .",

    "specifically , for the long axis of the @xmath128 cylinder : @xmath463 and the same for the long axis of the @xmath71 cylinder , @xmath464 taking then the coupling of the @xmath71 and @xmath128 cylinders into account , we first translate the @xmath71 cylinder to the @xmath128 site and upwards by @xmath332 and then couple the two cylinders by the matrix elements ( [ off ] ) .",
    "the coupling has no effect in the @xmath465 planes containing the @xmath368 x , and z points , but in the @xmath466 planes containing the p and n points , the two cross sections mix to become identical around p , as can be seen in the last two top panels of fig.@xmath18[figba ] . as a result ,",
    "the double cylinder twists and follows the shape of the string of x - centered rhombic bz faces ( fig.[figbz ] ) , i.e. it stretches out towards the @xmath324-bulge around z of the longitudinal hole sheet .",
    "finally we should mention that the other part of the electron double cylinder is made up of the @xmath71 @xmath214 and @xmath128 @xmath252 bands which have no @xmath147 character and no @xmath8-dispersion .    in the two last two top panels of fig.@xmath18[figba ] ,",
    "we observe a dirac point at p and @xmath467ev .",
    "its upper cone in this @xmath151 plane stays intact over an energy range of nearly 1.5 ev and over a distance of almost @xmath468 ( @xmath469ev@xmath244 ) whereafter it develops into the 4 neighboring maxima of the mixed @xmath123@xmath470-longitudinal and @xmath471 hole band .",
    "the lower cone cone extends merely over 0.2 ev .",
    "in addition , the dirac point has a second , upper cone which slopes by as much as @xmath472ev@xmath244 and extends several ev above the fermi level , but is truncated slightly below .",
    "this is the @xmath218 electron band . from the cross sections of the band structure with the planes shifted by multiples of @xmath473 in fig.@xmath18[figba ]",

    "the reason for the small @xmath8-dispersion along xpx , compared with that along @xmath64z , is simply that xpx is at the zone boundary where interlayer coupling is between the _ degenerate _ @xmath71 and @xmath128 states .",
    "hence , to first order in @xmath426 the two degenerate @xmath203 levels split by @xmath485 which is _ independent _ of @xmath486 but if @xmath379 were as large as 2@xmath18ev , first order might not suffice . therefore ,",
    "once again , we first consult the caption to fig .",
    "[ figbz ] to learn that at @xmath71 , @xmath147 may only mix with _",
    "one _ other state , @xmath487 which is the bottom of the @xmath123 longitudinal @xmath289 band .",
    "the interlayer coupling of @xmath71 with @xmath128 therefore requires merely the solution of a @xmath16 matrix , which after exact lwdin downfolding of the @xmath0 block reduces to:@xmath488these two second - order equations for @xmath489 can be solved exactly _ and give no _ @xmath8__-dependence . _ _ the above - mentioned 0.2 ev @xmath8-dependence seen in fig.@xmath18[figba ] must therefore be due to interlayer hopping via orbitals other than as @xmath235 but this is negligible .",
    "secondly , we confirm from fig.@xmath18figpdfatbands that at @xmath71 , there is essentially only one level with @xmath147 character ( because @xmath490 = 0.1@xmath18ev ) .",
    "this level is at @xmath2162.1 ev and is non - bonding between nearest neighbors separated by @xmath491 or @xmath492 .",

    "we therefore seek the lower @xmath147-level along xpx in bafe@xmath7as@xmath6 and find that it is dispersionless and lies 2.0 ev below the upper @xmath147 level ( and below the frame of the figure ) .",
    "hence @xmath498ev , assuming a 20% bymixing of @xmath225 character to the upper @xmath147-like level due to the level separation of merely 0.4@xmath18ev in bafe@xmath6as@xmath7 .",
    "we remark that although the bands do not disperse along xpx , the wave - function characters of course do , e.g. in the @xmath442 planes , the upper and lower @xmath147-like levels have respectively purely @xmath71 @xmath499 and @xmath128 @xmath500 characters , while in the @xmath151 plane , they are completely mixed .",
    "secondly , we remind that the @xmath147 states along xpx are intra - layer non - bonding and interlayer @xmath380 bonding and antibonding .",
    "going away from the xpx line , the upper @xmath147-like band hybridizes linearly with the nearby @xmath324 and @xmath219 bands and thereby form the p - centered dirac cones discussed above . that the cones are centered at the @xmath501 plane , i.e. the one containing the high - symmetry points n and p ( see fig.@xmath18[figbctbz ] ) , is due to the fact that , in this plane , the bct bands are periodic for @xmath370 in the _ small _ bz , whereby the bands along @xmath63@xmath71 equal those along @xmath123@xmath128 , which by tetragonality equal those along @xmath123@xmath71 . this higher symmetry is clearly seen in the last two top panels of fig [ figbands ] .",

    "that gapping , which causes the small moment of 0.3 @xmath588fe , takes place as follows :    the side of the @xmath71-centered electron superellipse which is normal to the @xmath589 direction , i.e. which points towards @xmath145 matches the inner , longitudinal @xmath123-centered hole pocket both in fermi - surface dimension ( nesting ) and in orbital character , @xmath590 those two bands therefore gap around the fermi level , while the outer , transversal @xmath591 hole sheet stays intact . near the @xmath171 and @xmath31 directions , the @xmath71 electron sheet however matches the outer , transversal hole sheet in size and orbital character , @xmath273 and @xmath592 respectively .",

    "the sdft value of the stoner parameter is @xmath597ev and the moment is @xmath598 compared with the maximum moment of @xmath599 for the @xmath3 configuration , the value @xmath600 is intermediate .",

    "[ figstripebands ] , the paramagnetic and the spin - spiral band structures are lined up with respect to the common paramagnetic potential , i.e. @xmath2 in the tb stoner calculation .",
    "we see , as was pointed out before , that bands with @xmath0 character split irrespective of their position relatively to the fermi level , but those in the lower half the @xmath0-band structure generally shift downwards ( dark blue ) while those in the upper generally half shift upwards ( light blue ) .",
    "we recall that the shift upon an increase of the exchange potential is the negative of the spin - polarization : @xmath603 by 1st - order perturbation theory .",
    "in fact , there happens to be a fairly well - defined dividing line between positively and negatively spin - polarized bands around 0 ev .",
    "moreover , _ on _ this dividing line , the non - hybridizing @xmath225 and @xmath604 bands along @xmath63@xmath128 are nearly degenerate and dispersionless , so increasing @xmath14 beyond 1.8ev will open up a gap which extends throughout the bz and makes any correponding @xmath605 material ( e.g. laomnas or laofen @xcite ) an antiferromagnetic insulator .",
    "we now discuss the intermediate - moment stripe bands for 2d laofeas in detail .",
    "starting again on the left - hand side of fig.@xmath18[figstripebands ] with the crossing of the paramagnetic , nearly pure @xmath135 band with itself , halfway between @xmath63 and @xmath128 at @xmath606 ev , we see the bands split to the energies @xmath607 around the fermi level , which has now moved up to 0.5@xmath18ev , with the lower and upper bands fully spin - polarized .",
    "this gap extends in a large region around the @xmath63@xmath128-line .",
    "so , whereas for small @xmath12 the @xmath291 @xmath135 hole and @xmath128 @xmath135-@xmath225 electron sheets did not gap at all , for intermediate @xmath12 these two fs sheets no longer exist .",
    "it is however only the @xmath135-parts which are gapped away : due to strong @xmath252 hybridization , the @xmath225-like bands near @xmath608 ( green ) has no partner at @xmath609 ( grey ) within the @xmath610-range with which it can couple .",
    "this band therefore only splits midways between @xmath63 and @xmath128 , i.e. near @xmath611@xmath128 , but hardly closer to @xmath63 and towards @xmath71 ( grey ) .",
    "hence , the reason for the disappearance of the @xmath225-part of the superellipse at @xmath128 is not gapping , but the 0.5 ev upwards shift of the fermi level .",

    "we used the stoner approximation to sdft , because it is simple and allows one to calculate the spin - spiral band structures as functions of the strength , @xmath12 of the exchange potential and impose the selfconsisteny condition , @xmath812 at a later stage .",
    "we limited ourselves to using this formalism to explain the 2d band structures for stripe order as a function of @xmath12 but in quite some depth , often using simple analytical theory .",
    "what complicates the magnetic band structure is the simultaneous presence of as - fe covalency and stoner - exchange coupling . that the latter is only between _ like _ fe @xmath0 orbitals , gave the structure of the small - moment sdw - gapping of the paramagnetic fs as well as the intermediate - moment propeller - shaped fs . with the goal of eventually understanding and possibly simplifying the calculation of the spin spiral energy dispersions",
    ", we expressed the magnetic energy as the difference between magnetic and nonmagnetic band - structure energies , whereby the magnetic band structure should be the one corrected for double counting of the exchange interaction .",
    "this formalism was then applied to the large - moment stripe order and we found its stabilization energy to have two main sources ( 1 ) the coupling of the paramagnetic @xmath135 hole and @xmath218 electron bands and ( 2 ) the coupling of the other electron band and the @xmath137 part of the doubly degenerate hole band .",
    "the fermi - surface contributions to the magnetic energy were found to be comparatively small , and that gave some hope for developing a suitable heisenberg hamiltonian .",
    "we also explained the much discussed coupling in sdft between the stripe moment and the as height above the fe plane . in the end , we showed and discussed the self - consistent spin - spiral moment and energy dispersion obtained from a sdft calculation , co - authored by one of us .",
    "we would like to thank alexander yaresko for pointing out to us the beauty of spin spirals .",
    "dmytro inosov convinced us about the non - triviality of interlayer coupling in bafe@xmath6as@xmath6 .",
    "maciej zwierzycki provided us with computer programs using the overlapping - muffin - tin - approximation ( omta ) .",
    "@xcite we are grateful to claudia hagemann for proof - reading the manuscript , and to ove jepsen for being extremely helpful , as usual , and for pointing out an error in the manuscript .",
    "thanks to guo - qiang liu for discussions of his spin - orbit coupled calculations . l.b . would like to thank alessandro toschi for many useful discussions .",
