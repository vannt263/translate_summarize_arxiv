    "photometry of all sources in the field was extracted with a flux threshold of three sigma above the background , and three source extraction iterations were performed .",
    "in addition to the deep images , starfinder was run on each of the three auxiliary images in each epoch . as these three images are independent , a repeated flux and position measurement is obtained for each star , albeit at the cost of photometric sensitivity and astrometric precision due to the fact that each subset contains only one - third of the images combined in each deep image .",
    "stars are required to be detected in at least two auxiliary images in addition to the deep science image . for stars detected in all three auxiliary images , the uncertainty in the position and magnitude of each star",
    "is derived as the root - mean - square ( rms ) deviation from the mean of the three subsets divided by the square root of the number of independent measurements , here @xmath28 , which compensates for the lack of photometric depth in the auxiliary images as compared to the deep science image . in the case",

    "the use of the same starfinder algorithms ensured that the relative astrometric uncertainty between naco and nirc2 was minimized . matching the naco 2003 source list with the nirc2 2008 and 2009 photometry provided a catalogue of 226 sources of which 119 had 3-epoch measurements suitable for linear - motion fitting ( see sec .",
    "[ motionsec ] ) .",
    "this catalogue provides the highest astrometric accuracy available in the quintuplet cluster center .    for the extraction of the wider field of view with substanially increased source counts",
    ", the anisoplanatic effects in both the naco 2003 and 2008 data sets could not be ignored . the daophot psf package with a spatially varying psf was therefore used to perform the photometry on these data sets . while the 2s combined images in 2003 and 2008 could be well modelled with a quadratically varying psf , the anisoplanatic effects across the 20s exposures proved neither linear nor quadratic . to minimize the residual positional errors from anisoplanatism ,",
    "the 2003 20s combined image was split into four quadrants and the psf fitting was performed on each quadrant separately . a linearly varying psf across each quadrant image provided the lowest flux residuals after psf subtraction .",
    "the astrometric and photometric source lists of all quadrant images were re - combined and matched with the 2s 2003 photometry to replace saturated stars with @xmath32 mag in the deep observations .",
    "the combined 2003 @xmath10 source list was then matched with the naco 2008 daophot photometry to yield 2134 sources with proper motion uncertainties of less than 3 mas / yr and @xmath33 mag suitable for fitting the cluster motion .",
    "the three auxiliary images providing the photometric and astrometric uncertainties were treated in the same way as the deep image , and uncertainties were derived as in the case of the nirc2 data discussed above .",

    "the larger naco field of view is used to identify semi - isolated stars with reliable fluxes in the ukidss gps survey .",
    "the zeropoint was derived for the combined naco image with the short 2.0s individual exposure time to avoid saturation effects .",
    "magnitudes reported in the gps are derived from aperture fluxes within the fwhm resolution of @xmath35 . in order to mitigate a systematic error in the zeropoint due to the difference in spatial resolution",
    ", the flux of stars detected in the naco frame within the @xmath35 radius from each calibration source was added prior to the zeropoint derivation .",
    "this is particularly crucial as the flux is systematically brighter for ukidss stars where the aperture contains several fainter sources next to the calibration star . as a consequence ,",
    "the uncorrected flux zeropoint is 0.2 mag larger than the zeropoint after correcting for the sum of resolved stars in each aperture . to avoid stars partially contributing to each @xmath35 circular aperture ,",
    "stars located closer than one fwhm ( 3.2 pixel or @xmath36 ) from the aperture edge were excluded , such that only stars within @xmath37 contribute to the total flux of psf - fitted stars in each aperture . for most calibration sources , corrections due to flux adding are below 0.1 mag , yet the maximum correction reaches 0.3 mag in two cases .",
    "this constructed aperture flux on the naco 2.0s image is then compared to the ukidss photometric catalogue for zeropoint calibration .",
    "the sample of local , reddened stars used as calibrators ensures that color effects are minimized , and no color terms were found between the mauna kea @xmath7 and vlt @xmath10 filters .",
    "a total of 15 non - saturated stars with @xmath38 mag provided a zeropoint of @xmath39 mag .",
    "after calibrating the @xmath10 2.0s source list to ukidss , the 20.0s naco catalogue was referenced to the 2.0s calibrated catalogue using a total of 860 stars in the common linear regime , @xmath40 mag .",
    "the deeper nirc2 2009 observations were calibrated with respect to the naco 2.0s 2003 observations using @xmath41 stars in the range @xmath42 mag , and the shallower nirc2 2008 observations were then calibrated against the nirc2 2009 observations with @xmath43 stars with @xmath44 mag .",
    "the three auxiliary frames of each data set were calibrated with respect to their respective deep image in all cases .",
    "the high number of available calibration sources between each high - resolution 2003/2008/2009 data set led to a zeropoint error of less than @xmath45 mag for each calibration , which is consistent with the deviation between all cross - matched data sets after zeropointing .",
    "the absolute accuracy of the final photometry is therefore limited by the calibration with respect to the ukidss sample with a zeropoint uncertainty of @xmath46 mag .",

    "the contribution of the geometric transformation to the proper motion uncertainty is 0.27 mas / yr when referencing the nirc2 2008 to the nirc2 2009 positions , and 0.80 mas/5.78 yrs @xmath50 mas / yr when referencing the naco 2003 epoch to nirc2 2009 .",

    "the two components can not be separated .",
    "the overestimated uncertainties in each motion fit is likely caused by this combination of transformation residual error with the individual astrometric uncertainties in the transformed epochs . in the standard procedure when deriving the velocity dispersion from proper motions , the mean astrometric uncertainty would be subtracted in quadrature .",

    "the pillars and fringes at the cloud edge in front of the cluster s motion indicate that the ionising radiation and wind pressure from the wolf - rayet cluster members is eating into the cloud towards which the cluster is presently moving .",
    "three - dimensional hydrodynamic simulations of clumpy cloud surfaces exposed to ionising radiation from a single nearby o - type star result in pillared structures on timescales of 2 to @xmath116 yrs ( mackey & lim 2010 ) . comparing the radial velocity of the quintuplet , @xmath117 km / s , with the cloud velocity of @xmath118 km / s at the location of the sickle ( molinari et al .",
    "2011 , see their fig .  4 ) , the cluster would move 15 pc for a relative velocity of @xmath119 km / s within @xmath120 yrs .",
    "however , the quintuplet is located only 2 - 3 pc from the illuminated cloud rim in projection at the present epoch . the higher radiation and wind pressure of @xmath5 o - type and wolf - rayet stars ( liermann et al .  2009 , humann et al .",
    "2012 ) might accelerate the carving of the pillars , and the fact that no ionised rims are observed behind the direction of motion of the quintuplet , where the cluster might have cleared its path , corroborates the suggestion that the cluster is moving towards the ionisation rim .",
    "the increasing flux incident on the cloud rim during the cluster s approach might cause additional instabilities aiding in the formation of the pillars .",
    "such a scenario was suggested for the individual , rapidly moving star @xmath121 per ( elmegreen & elmegreen 1978 ) , and will be enhanced for the large number of high - mass stars in the quintuplet .",
    "these authors already suggested a shortened formation timescale for pillared structures in the case of relative motion between the ionising star and the cloud , accelerated further by instabilities forming at the cloud rim .",
    "it would be interesting to probe whether the cluster - cloud interaction is capable of triggering the next generation of star formation .",
    "right now , however , there is no direct evidence for young stellar objects in the compressed cloud .",
    "the interaction provides stringent evidence that the quintuplet cluster is indeed moving through the cmz , implying a location at a radial distance of less than 200 pc from the gc at the present time and a non - circular motion of the quintuplet with significant differences between the cluster s apocenter and pericenter passages .      a revised version of the arches orbits for a proper motion of 172 km / s for the cluster with respect to the field ( clarkson et al .",
    "2012 ) is shown in fig .",
    "[ archquin_orbits ] . only orbits where the arches is located in front of the gc today are directly compared with the respective orbits of the quintuplet cluster .",
    "the orbits where the arches cluster is behind the gc today are very similar albeit less chaotic and even more regularly nested than the orbits of the quintuplet cluster shown for a location behind the gc today in fig .",
    "[ orbits ] . for a location behind the gc today",
    ", both clusters would have to be on retrograde orbits , and orbiting against the rotation direction of the galactic bar .",
    "however , the ionisation rim near the quintuplet along the galactic plane in the direction of motion as well as the apparent interaction of the arches moving into a nearby cloud observed in the radio regime ( lang et al .",
    "2003 ) suggest that both clusters are comoving .",
    "a formation scenario for massive clusters on retrograde orbits would be even harder to find .",
    "while the arches velocities suggest a family of self - similar , nested orbits , the quintuplet orbital family displays more intersection points .",
    "it is striking that especially the approach of the arches and quintuplet clusters to the supermassive black hole is very sensitive to the differences in their 3d orbital velocities . in the case of the arches",
    ", the simulations forced us to conclude that the cluster is not able to reach the central parsec before it disperses into the gc field ( @xmath122 pc at all times and for all line - of - sight distances , see also the discussion in stolte et al .",
    "the particular motion vectors of the quintuplet , on the other hand , and its location on the galactic plane , promote extreme orbits for line - of - sight distances of 20 - 30 pc behind the gc today , where the cluster approaches the center of gravity to within 2 - 4 pc at closest approach . yet , as discussed above , this would require the quintuplet to be on a retrograde orbit .",
    "the fact that both the quintuplet and the arches cluster appear far from a circular orbit solution has severe implications for their dynamical evolution .",
    "n - body simulations treating self - consistently the stellar component of the inner galaxy and the internal dynamics of a dense star cluster have recently shown that clusters on eccentric orbits develop chaotic tidal tails ( fujii et al .",
    "2008 , see especially their fig .  2 ) .",
    "according to kim & morris ( 2003 ) and fujii et al .",
    "( 2008 ) , clusters on eccentric orbits migrate faster towards the center than the clusters in earlier circular orbit models ( e.g. , kim et al .",
    "2000 , portegies zwart et al .",
    "the development of chaotic tidal tails additionally implies that tidally stripped stars can end up in positions far away from the position of the cluster orbit , as might be evidenced in the population of dispersed wolf - rayet stars in the gc ( mauerhan et al .  2010b , m. habibi et al .",
    "2014 ) .",
    "because of the more chaotic behaviour of the quintuplet orbital family as compared to the arches orbits and because of its older age , the location of the quintuplet s origin is less constrained . for the arches , the orbit simulations suggest that the cluster likely emerged toward the upper left quadrant of the motion plane or close to the x2 orbital family ( red ellipse in fig .",
    "[ archquin_orbits ] ) .",
    "a similar origin close to the outermost x2 orbit is likely for the quintuplet if it is located at a line - of - sight distance of -50 to -200 pc in front of the gc today . especially near a present line - of - sight distance of -150 to -200 pc ,",
    "the origin of the quintuplet was close to the tangent point of the x2 orbital zone indicated as the solid ellipse in figs .",
    "[ orbits ] and [ archquin_orbits ] . as we already noted in the discussion of the arches orbit ( stolte et al .",
    "2008 ) , a location near the outermost x2 orbit is consistent with a formation region between the x1 and x2 orbits of the galactic bar .",
    "this transition region is located at the outer edge of the central molecular zone , where instreaming and circumnuclear clouds are prone to collisions .",
    "this formation scenario is also consistent with both clusters being on prograde orbits , which implies a location of both clusters in front of the gc today .    both on orbits located further inward and on orbits where the quintuplet is located behind the gc today",
    ", the cluster would have emerged from its natal cloud at vastly different locations from the most likely place of birth of the arches .",
    "one should keep in mind , however , that these conclusions are sensitive to the assumed quintuplet cluster age of 4.0 myr ( one to a few orbital periods for outer and inner orbits , respectively ) , and that the embedded phase during which the cloud fragmented and the cluster contracted into its current dynamical state are not accounted for .",
    "most of the orbits where the cluster is located in front of the gc today , with the exception of the innermost cases , would be consistent with a formation locus near one of the x1/x2 transition points if the cluster were slightly older ( @xmath123 myr ) .",
    "for the case that both clusters have emerged at one of the end - points of the x2 orbital family ( see fig .  [ archquin_orbits ] ) , a consistent formation scenario of these two massive clusters is presented in the next section .      the close proximity of the arches and quintuplet clusters in the central molecular zone , at a projected spatial separation of only 12 pc from each other , and their similar motion parallel to the galactic plane , raise the question of whether these two clusters have a common origin , or , at least , have originated in a similar fashion .",
    "it is striking that the arches and the quintuplet are the only _ compact , massive _",
    "young clusters in the central region outside the nucleus .",
    "previously , with cluster ages of @xmath124 myr for the arches and @xmath125 myr for quintuplet , the age discrepancy was considered too large for both clusters to originate from the same molecular cloud . at the time when the arches must have formed ,",
    "the quintuplet s most massive stars would already have excavated the native cloud substantially , such that the formation of a second , equally massive twin would seem unlikely .",
    "this argument is somewhat diminished by the recent age dating of five hydrogen - rich quintuplet wn stars by liermann et al .",
    "( 2010 ) , suggesting that these stars have ages between 2.4 and 3.6 myr , and that the main sequence ob population is in the age range of 3.3 - 3.6 myr ( liermann et al .",
    "such ages would bring both clusters much closer in their evolution , and hence would render a common origin more likely .",
    "nevertheless , one has to bear in mind that wolf - rayet evolutionary models still harbour significant uncertainties .",
    "in addition , the luminosity of these objects might be biased if the wns are located in binary systems ( liermann et al .",
    "2010 ) , as is the case for the quintuplet wc members ( tuthill et al .  2006 ) . in this case",
    ", the wns would be affected by binary mass transfer and hence appear rejuvenated as compared to the main sequence population ( see liermann et al .",
    "2012 for a discussion ) . despite the known uncertainties in the age determination of wolf - rayet stars , the fact that the carbon - rich variety of wc stars is already heavily present in the quintuplet cluster , and in fact led to its early discovery by okuda et al .",
    "( 1990 ) and nagata et al .",
    "( 1990 ) , suggests a more evolved evolutionary stage than the arches population .",
    "the wc evolutionary stage is expected to follow the wn phase after a brief hydrogen - free wn period ( crowther 2007 , martins et al .",
    "especially the dust - rich interacting - wind binaries resolved into spectacular spiral patterns by tuthill et al .",
    "( 2006 ) are entirely absent in the arches cluster .",
    "indeed , spectral analysis suggests that all of the arches wn population are of types wnh6 - 7 close to or on the high - mass main sequence , with strong hydrogen emission line spectra ( martins et al .",
    "2008 ) . hence , while the exact age difference between the arches and quintuplet clusters is still not well established , there is strong evidence that both clusters did not form at the same time , but at least 0.5 to 1 myr apart .",
    "even if the arches and quintuplet did not emerge from the same cloud , we may be able to identify a consistent formation scenario for both clusters that might explain their similar orbits and their present - day proximity .",
    "in extragalactic circumnuclear rings , the endpoints of the inner bar were shown recently to bring forth star clusters at regular intervals .",
    "especially striking is the case of the spiral galaxy ngc 613 , where a string of circumnuclear clusters with ages between 2 - 10 myr is found emerging from both fueling points of the inner ring of circumnuclear clouds ( bker et al .",
    "this ring of young star clusters displays a continuous age sequence of clusters being formed every 2 - 3 myr on each side of the inner bar . at these points ,",
    "n - body simulations show strong cloud - cloud collisions after gas has efficiently streamed in through the outer bar potential ( regan & teuben 2003 , rodriguez - fernandez & combes 2008 , kim et al .",
    "2011 , see also the early gas flow models by athanassoula 1992 ) . in these simulations , dust lanes form along the inner x1 orbit , and",
    "meet infalling clouds in the circumnuclear ring at the contact points between the x1 and x2 orbital families .",
    "the efficiency of this mechanism suggests that this scenario should be present in most , if not all , gas - rich barred spirals , at least in the case that an inner bar , or circumnuclear ring , is formed from the in - streaming material . in fact , numerous galaxies are found to have circumnuclear rings lined with young star clusters ( mazzuca et al .",
    "2008 , and references therein ) , with 50% of their sample displaying a systematic age sequence . as pointed out in the detailed discussion of mazzuca et al .",
    "( 2008 ) , the youngest hii regions frequently emerge near the contact points between the observed dust lanes and the circumnuclear rings , as expected from the simulations .    in the milky way , the existence of an inner bar is still disputed , as such characteristics are much more difficult to corroborate by observations through the dense galactic plane ( see the discussion in rodriguez - fernandez & combes 2008 ) .",
    "nevertheless , the circumnuclear ring of molecular clouds observed in extragalactic systems can be identified with the central molecular zone , which is comparable in its spatial dimensions ( @xmath126 pc ) to the circumnuclear rings in other spiral galaxies ( see table 1 in mazzuca et al .",
    "in addition , the presence of a star - forming ring was recently postulated by molinari et al .",
    "( 2011 ) , and several of the dense , compact clouds along this ring are expected to form massive clusters comparable to the arches and quintuplet systems ( longmore et al .",
    "2012 , 2013 ) .",
    "if the large outer bar is responsible for fueling the central molecular zone , the points where infalling clouds are colliding with the existing circumnuclear ring at a radius of about 200 pc would be a pre - destined place for cluster formation . in this scenario",
    ", the most massive clusters would form in pseudo - regular intervals , whenever a cloud having a sufficient mass reservoir collides with material in the central molecular zone .",
    "this would naturally explain how both clusters could have inherited similar velocities and orbital motions .",
    "in addition , if an inner bar exists , the endpoints of this bar would be the places where gas is channeled in .",
    "as seen in extragalactic systems , in - streaming clouds collide with the circumnuclear ring of molecular clouds at these contact points ( mazzuca et al .",
    "2008 ) , rendering them preferred cluster - formation loci . following the discussion in molinari et al .",
    "( 2011 ) and longmore et al .",
    "( 2013 ) , sgr b2 and sgr c represent the overdensities at the endpoints of the _ star - forming ring _ , which would then trace the cluster formation loci in the milky way s cmz .",
    "the approximate starting points of the orbits ( thick triangles in fig .",
    "[ orbits ] and fig .",
    "[ archquin_orbits ] ) suggest that both clusters formed at different loci near the outer boundary of the cmz . in this case",
    ", the spatial proximity of the clusters would be a coincidence , but would be reconciled by the fact that they formed at similar galactocentric radii , and hence again are found on similar orbits .    while the recent observations support cluster formation from dense cmz clouds",
    ", it remains an open question how these clouds migrate into the central region .",
    "one possibility to channel gas into the cmz , and possibly to smaller radii , is provided by models of nested bars . a nested bar model with a 3.5 kpc outer bar and a nested 150",
    "pc inner bar can explain several of the kinematic features in the longitude - velocity diagram towards the inner galaxy in a self - consistent gas flow model ( rodriguez - fernandez & combes 2008 , see also namekata et al .",
    "in particular , the @xmath127 molecular cloud complex corresponds in this model to the far branch of an inner two - arm spiral pattern that channels gas from the 300 - 800 pc hi ring into the central molecular zone .",
    "the lack of a counterpart of the @xmath127 complex is interpreted as only one of the two theoretically predicted spiral arms being active at the present time .",
    "intriguingly , this complex is located in the same quadrant where the quintuplet and arches orbit simulations suggest a possible formation locus of these star clusters .",
    "the projected distance of the complex from the galactic center is 180 pc , consistent with the formation of the star clusters at the edge of the x2 orbital zone .",
    "the present set of large - scale simulations of the fueling of the central molecular zone in the framework of barred potentials can not trace particles down to the spatial scales required to probe star formation . due to efficiency and the large spatial scales involved , self - gravity and feedback effects",
    "have so far been ignored .",
    "recent high - resolution simulations of the inner few hundred parsecs conducted by kim et al .",
    "( 2011 ) include self - gravity and feedback for the first time",
    ". it will be intriguing to see whether these n - body simulations of infalling cloud particles can account for the formation of massive clusters on non - circular orbits , such as suggested from the arches and quintuplet orbital solutions .",
    "we obtained the proper motion of stars in the quintuplet cluster and the field population along the line of sight towards the galactic center from three epochs of high - spatial resolution near - infrared imaging with keck and vlt .",
    "the relative proper motion of the cluster with respect to the field is derived to be @xmath0 km / s from two - dimensional fits to the proper motion density distribution .",
    "the motion axis is consistent with the quintuplet cluster moving along the galactic plane , while the motion perpendicular to the plane is negligible . combining the proper motion with the known radial velocity leads to a 3d orbital motion of @xmath1 km / s , with the cluster moving outwards from the galactic center and receding from the sun .",
    "this orbital motion is surprisingly similar to the orbital motion of the arches cluster ( stolte et al .",
    "2008 , clarkson et al .",
    "2012 ) .",
    "simulations of the cluster orbit in a multi - component potential of the inner galaxy suggest that the orbit of the cluster is non - circular if the cluster is located in the central molecular zone ( @xmath102 pc ) .",
    "a revised orbit solution for the arches cluster is also presented .",
    "tracing the orbital motion of both clusters back for 2.5 and 4.0 myr to the possible points of origin , a common cluster formation scenario for the arches and quintuplet clusters is identified if the quintuplet is at a line - of - sight position in front of the gc today . in this scenario ,",
    "the cluster - forming clouds are located inside the inner 200 pc of the cmz and at the far side of the galactic center , towards increasing galactic longitudes . when compared to simulations fueling the central molecular zone with nested bar potentials , this location is intriguingly similar to the tentative collision point of the rearward spiral arm of the inner bar .",
    "today , the @xmath128  molecular complex has accumulated a total mass of @xmath129 at this position ( oka et al .",
    "although there are presently no signposts of star formation in the form of hii regions in this complex , it is conceivable that the next compact , massive cluster will be forged in the near future at this exceptional locus .",
    "further simulations might provide insight as to whether the collisional properties of the infalling gas into the central molecular zone are sufficient to explain the high velocities of the arches and quintuplet clusters , and their non - circular orbits .",
    "the current velocity measurement provides the basis for a new set of simulations to reconstruct the tidal losses over each cluster s lifetime .",
    "especially the diffusion of high - mass stars from the young population might have given rise to the population of apparently isolated young , high - mass stars in the gc .",
    "these simulations would solve the mystery of apparently isolated high - mass star formation in the gc environment .",
    "observationally , increasing the proper motion accuracy with more epochs over a longer time baseline will lead to the measurement of the internal velocity dispersion of the quintuplet cluster , for which we obtain an upper limit of @xmath130 km / s .",
    "an accurate measurement of the internal velocity dispersion will additionally constrain the virial state and the long - term dynamical stability of the young star cluster in the galactic center tidal field .",

    "<S> we investigate the orbital motion of the quintuplet cluster near the galactic center with the aim of constraining formation scenarios of young , massive star clusters in nuclear environments . </S>",
    "<S> three epochs of adaptive optics high - angular resolution imaging with the keck / nirc2 and vlt / naos - conica systems were obtained over a time baseline of 5.8 years , delivering an astrometric accuracy of 0.5 - 1 mas / yr . proper motions were derived in the cluster reference frame and were used to distinguish cluster members from the majority of the dense field star population toward the inner bulge . fitting the cluster and field proper motion distributions with 2d gaussian models , </S>",
    "<S> we derive the orbital motion of the cluster for the first time . </S>",
    "<S> the quintuplet is moving with a 2d velocity of @xmath0 km / s with respect to the field along the galactic plane , which yields a 3d orbital velocity of @xmath1 km / s when combined with the previously known radial velocity . from a sample of 119 stars measured in three epochs </S>",
    "<S> , we derive an upper limit to the velocity dispersion in the core of the quintuplet cluster of @xmath2 km / s . </S>",
    "<S> knowledge of the three velocity components of the quintuplet allows us to model the cluster orbit in the potential of the inner galaxy . under the assumption that the quintuplet is located in the central 200 pc at the present time , </S>",
    "<S> these simulations exclude the possibility that the cluster is moving on a circular orbit . comparing the quintuplet s orbit with our earlier measurements of the arches orbit , </S>",
    "<S> we discuss the possibility that both clusters originated in the same area of the central molecular zone . </S>",
    "<S> according to the model of binney et al .  </S>",
    "<S> ( 1991 ) , two families of stable cloud orbits are located along the major and minor axes of the galactic bar , named x1 and x2 orbits , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the formation locus of these clusters is consistent with the outermost x2 orbit and might hint at cloud collisions at the transition region between the x1 and x2 orbital families located at the tip of the minor axis of the galactic bar . </S>",
    "<S> the formation of young , massive star clusters in circumnuclear rings is discussed in the framework of the channeling in of dense gas by the bar potential . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that the existence of a large - scale bar plays a major role in supporting ongoing star and cluster formation , not only in nearby spiral galaxies with circumnuclear rings , but also in the milky way s central molecular zone . </S>"
