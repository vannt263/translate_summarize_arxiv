    "superconductivity above 20 k in iron pnictides was reported two years ago.@xcite since then the number of iron - pnictide phases has grown considerably , but the highest critical temperature has remained below 60 k. however , the value falls short only of that of the high-@xmath2 superconductive cuprates .",
    "nonetheless , fe as a natural constituent in superconductive materials is fascinating and somewhat unexpected . in none of these iron - pnictide phases",
    "does iron order magnetically in the superconductive state , though some non - superconductive parent phases exhibit antiferromagnetic spin - density waves.@xcite some of the superconductive iron phases have simple structures , e.g. the chalcogenide phase fese.@xcite like the high-@xmath7 cuprate superconductors fe - based phases also have layered structures , in which the superconducting charge carriers reside at edge - shared fe@xmath8 ( @xmath9 group 15 or 16 element ) tetrahedra .",
    "the geometry is important for both types of superconductive phases .",
    "cuprate superconductors with puckered cuo@xmath10 layers have generally lower @xmath7 values than those with flat ones , whereas for the fe - based superconductors the highest @xmath7 values occur when the tetrahedra are closest to the regular shape.@xcite in a recent work which incorporates also fese the distance between the @xmath11 atom and the nearest fe layer seems to be a crucial geometrical parameter for determining the @xmath7 value.@xcite however , the actual mechanism behind the superconductivity transition is not known yet .    the presence of fe has opened the possibility to perform @xmath1fe - mssbauer - spectroscopy measurements and thereby to determine the spin and valence state of the fe atoms .",
    "various spectra from superconductive samples have established that the spin state of fe is zero or close to zero.@xcite this is true at least within the characteristic time - scale of @xmath12  ns of the @xmath1fe transition",
    ". however , presence of antiferromagnetic fluctuations has been suggested@xcite but may be difficult to be detected by mssbauer spectroscopy .",
    "a recent high - pressure experiment on the lafeaso phase showed that there is a strong connection between the spin - density - wave type magnetism of the non - superconducting state and the seemingly zero - fe - spin spectra of the superconducting state.@xcite    in this work we report findings of the mssbauer and seebeck measurements performed on both sides of the critical temperature of fese@xmath0te@xmath0 to record possible changes in the hyperfine parameters upon passing @xmath2 .",
    "samples of the fese@xmath0te@xmath0 phase were synthesized from stoichiometric ratios of high - purity se ( 99.99% ) , fe ( 99.9% ) and te ( 99.8% ) powders .",
    "the powders were sealed under vacuum in a quartz tube and fired for 20 h at 600 @xmath13c . after an intermediate grinding the samples were fired again at 650 @xmath13c for 20 h and furnace - cooled down to 300 k.    bulk superconductivity was confirmed by measuring the diamagnetic signal from approximately 20 mg of the sample with a superconducting quantum interference device ( squid : quantum design , mpms - xl ) in both the zero field - cooled and field - cooled ( 10 oe ) regimes .",

    "additional measurements using maximum doppler velocities of 8 and 10  mm / s were done to check the presence of magnetic impurities .",

    "seebeck measurements were done ( using a self - made equipment ) upon heating the sample from 4.0 to 300 k in steps of @xmath24  k. a sintered sample specimen was ground into shape of a thin parallelepiped of @xmath25  mm@xmath26 and inserted between two cu sample holders using ag paste .",
