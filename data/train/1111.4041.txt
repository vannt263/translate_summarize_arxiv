    "while the physics of wetting and spreading on ideally smooth solid surfaces has meanwhile reached a status of mature textbook knowledge , a whole range of wetting phenomena on randomly rough substrates are still elusive .",
    "this is particularly annoying , as almost all surfaces of practical interest bear considerable roughness , be it due to weathering , wear , or on purpose as , e.g. , in the case of sand - blasted surfaces . clearly , this has substantial impact in many situations .",
    "for example , a drop of liquid deposited on a rough substrate will spread or not , depending on the morphology of the liquid film which develops in the troughs of the roughness .",
    "as it accommodates its free surface to the substrate topography , it may percolate across the sample .",
    "the drop will then gradually spread over the entire sample . on the contrary , if the film rather tends to form isolated domains , the drop will stay in place . similarly , the redistribution of liquid within a granular pile , such as in humid soil or sand , may proceed along the grain surfaces only if the liquid wetting film on the grains forms a percolated structure .",
    "the morphology of a liquid water film deposited from humid air onto the surface of an electric isolator will strongly affect the performance of the latter , for analogous reasons .",
    "there has been already a lot of research on the adsorption of liquids on rough surfaces [ 1 - 15 ] , but this was concerned either with roughness amplitudes as small as the ( nanometer ) range of van der waals forces @xcite or with rather artificial substrate topographies in the context of super - hydrophobicity @xcite , or with completely wetting liquids ( zero contact angle ) @xcite .",
    "the most frequently encountered , customary case , however , is characterized by a finite contact angle , and a random roughness with typical length scales at least in the micron range . in the present paper",
    ", we consider surfaces which exhibit a random topography on scales large as compared to molecules , and are subject to adsorption of a liquid which forms a small but finite contact angle with the substrate material .",
    "since we consider macroscopic roughness , we adopt the view that all interfaces are infinitely sharp on the length scale of consideration ( sharp kink approximation @xcite ) .",
    "as the typical length scales considered here are still small as compared to the capillary length of the liquid ( 2.7 mm for water ) , gravity will be neglected as regards its effect on the liquid surface morphologies to be described . as opposed to earlier studies which concentrated on the macroscopic contact angle and contact line @xcite",
    ", we will try to derive the wetting phase diagram and other characteristics connected to the adsorption of a liquid film .",
    "the first systematic study of wetting on a randomly rough substrate at finite contact angle owes to wenzel @xcite .",
    "he characterized the roughness by a single parameter , @xmath0 , which he defined as the ratio of the total substrate area divided by the projected area .",
    "obviously , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 corresponds to a perfectly smooth surface .",
    "the free energy which is gained per unit area when the rough substrate is covered with a liquid is then given by @xmath3 , where @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the solid - liquid and solid - gas interfacial tension , respectively . if this is larger than the surface tension of the liquid , @xmath6 , we expect a vanishing macroscopic contact angle , because covering the substrate with liquid releases more energy than is required for the formation of a free liquid surface of the same ( projected ) area . more specifically , force balance at the three - phase contact line yields @xmath7 for the macroscopic contact angle on the rough surface .",
    "@xmath8 is the microscopic contact angle according to young and dupr . when the microscopic contact angle is reduced to @xmath9 , which we will henceforth call wenzel s angle , @xmath10 vanishes , and the substrate is covered with an infinitely thick liquid film . as we will see below , however , there are imprortant ramifications which are sensitive to the kind of roughness of the substrate .",
    "furthermore , even minute deviations from liquid - vapour coexistence , as they are omnipresent in practical situations , unveil a rather complex scenario which goes well beyond eq .",
    "( [ eq : wenzel ] ) .",
    "we describe the topography of the rough solid substrate by @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is a vector in the plane . the ( randomly varying ) function @xmath13 is normalized such that @xmath14 , where the angular brackets denote averaging over the entire sample area , @xmath15 .",
    "it is assumed that the substrate is homogeneous and isotropic , in the sense that the statistical parameters of @xmath13 are the same everywhere on the sample , and independent of rotation of the sample about the normal axis of the sample .",
    "a small amount of liquid deposited on this substrate will make an interface with the surrounding gas , which can be described by a second function , @xmath16 .",
    "the support of @xmath17 is the set @xmath18 , which denotes the wetted area .",
    "continuity of the liquid surface assures that @xmath19 on the boundary of @xmath20 , i.e. , at the three - phase contact line , where the solid substrate , the liquid , and the gas phase meet .",
    "this line will henceforth be denoted by @xmath21 .",
    "information on @xmath16 can be obtained from the total free energy functional of the system , which is given by @xmath22 \\ { \\rm d}x \\",
    "{ \\rm d}y \\label{eq : totalfreeenergy}\\ ] ] minimization of @xmath23 yields two important properties of @xmath17 .",
    "first of all , the mean curvature of the liquid surface , which can be written as @xcite @xmath24 assumes the same value everywhere on @xmath20 .",
    "second , the two surfaces described by @xmath11 and @xmath16 make the same ( young - dupr ) angle @xmath8 everywhere on @xmath21 .",
    "this reflects the local force balance at the three - phase contact line . while surface roughness gives rise to substantial contact angle hysteresis on macroscopic scales , the microscopic contact angle , @xmath8 ,",
    "is known to be well defined on the typical ( micrometer to nanometer ) scale @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , we should be aware that even on small scales , equilibration will take time , be it by transport through the gas phase or through an adsorbed layer of molecular thickness @xcite ( which we disregard in the present study ) .",
    "the question we shall ask is the following . given the substrate topography , @xmath11 , the equilibrium microscopic contact angle , @xmath8 , and the mean curvature of the liquid surface , @xmath25 , what can we predict on the function @xmath16 and the shape of the wetted area , @xmath20 ?",
    "in particular , we shall be interested whether @xmath20 forms a percolated set in the plane .    based on the observation that the amplitude of most natural roughness is much smaller than its dominant lateral length scale , we assume for the present study that @xmath26 which allows for substantial simplifications .",
    "expanding then the mean curvature according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : meancurvature ] ) , we obtain to first order in @xmath27 @xmath28 similarly , the contact angle with the substrate yields the boundary condition @xmath29 on @xmath21 , to first order in @xmath30 and @xmath27 .",
    "we can now immediately write down a useful identity concerning these quantities .",
    "green s theorem tells us that @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the distance along @xmath21 , @xmath33 its unit normal vector , and @xmath34 . since @xmath19 on @xmath21,@xmath35 is everywhere perpendicular to @xmath21 .",

    "since for most quantities of interest we could come up with closed analytic expressions , these results may be particularly useful for practical applications .",
    "the range of validity of the present theory extends from a few nanomeres up to roughly a millimeter , well below the capillary length of the liquid .",
    "the field of such applications is vast , including almost all situations in which a liquid comes into contact with a naturally rough surface . in particular , ramifications of wetting phase transitions , which inherently involve small contact angles , are to be expected and can now be accounted for in closed form .      1 .",
    "we have assumed the substrate to be chemically homogeneous .",
    "we have assumed shallow profiles ; eqs .",
    "( [ eq : flatapprox ] ) and ( [ eq : meancurvappprox ] ) .",
    "we have neglected higher correlations in the shape of @xmath21 ; eqs .",
    "( [ eq : mcapprox ] ) , ( [ eq : laplaceapprox ] ) , and the paragraph before .",
    "we have assumed the curvature of the roughness characteristic @xmath114 to be small ; eq .",
    "( [ eq : sppsmall ] ) .",
    "we have assumed isotropy of the roughness ; eq .",
    "( [ eq : cexpansion ] ) .",
    "the last two are probably the simplest to tackle , while the first one appears as the most difficult to overcome .",
    "it should finally be noted that in experiments , one has to reckon with quite long relaxation times for the measured quantities , because at all levels of the roughness there are saddle points @xcite , which act as effective pinning sites for @xmath69 .",
    "equilibration will nevertheless proceed within manageable time , either via the vapour phase or via the molecularly thin adsorbed film @xcite .",

    "<S> the wetting properties of solid substrates with customary ( i.e. , macroscopic ) random roughness are considered as a function of the microscopic contact angle of the wetting liquid and its partial pressure in the surrounding gas phase . </S>",
    "<S> analytic expressions are derived which allow for any given lateral correlation function and height distribution of the roughness to calculate the wetting phase diagram , the adsorption isotherms , and to locate the percolation transition in the adsorbed liquid film . </S>",
    "<S> most features turn out to depend only on a few key parameters of the roughness , which can be clearly identified . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that a first order transition in the adsorbed film thickness , which we term wenzel prewetting , occurs generically on typical roughness topographies , but is absent on purely gaussian roughness . </S>",
    "<S> it is thereby shown that even subtle deviations from gaussian roughness characteristics may be essential for correctly predicting even qualitative aspects of wetting . </S>"
