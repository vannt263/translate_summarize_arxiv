    "by generalizing the classical sampling theorem to multiple dimensions , it has been proven that the nyquist rate for isotropically bandlimited signals , i.e. , the lowest sampling rate that allows error - free reconstruction , is determined by the densest sphere - packing lattice @xcite . in three dimensions , for example , the body - centered cubic ( bcc ) lattice is optimal for sampling , because its dual , the face - centered cubic ( fcc ) lattice , is the optimal sphere packing ( * ? ? ?",

    "in particular , the vertices of the voronoi cells , which determine the covering radius @xmath72 , resemble narrow `` spikes '' and account for a negligible fraction of the total volume in high dimensions ( * ? ? ?",
    "to address this problem , we generated random vectors uniformly on a @xmath9-dimensional sphere of a given radius @xmath75 and decoded these vectors using well - known lattice decoding algorithms @xcite to determine the fraction of the vectors that belonged to @xmath30 . repeating this process for an appropriately chosen sequence of @xmath75 values enabled accurate estimation of @xmath73 for a given @xmath12 , also for bandwidths @xmath21 near @xmath65 and @xmath72 .",
