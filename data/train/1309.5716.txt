    "the fully quantized treatment we put forward allows us to investigate work extraction and refrigeration by the tools of quantum - optical amplifier and dissipation theory @xcite , particularly , by the analysis of amplified or dissipated phase - plane quasiprobability distributions @xcite .",
    "explicit results are obtained here for a minimal design : it consists of a `` working - fluid '' realized by a single two - level system ( tls ) that is permanently coupled to two thermal baths with _ distinct spectra _ and temperatures and is driven by a quantum mechanical harmonic oscillator acting as a piston . we stress that both the tls and the piston - oscillator are _ essential _ if the design is to be self - contained , i.e. , autonomous : the tls allows heat flow to or from the baths , i.e. , it mediates between the two baths , and the piston extracts the work in an engine or provides the energy input in a refrigerator .",

    "denoting @xmath180 , we find for a coherent state    @xmath181    \\(ii ) for an initial number ( fock ) state @xmath182 , the cop may _ surpass that of a coherent state with the same _ @xmath183 _ ( fig .",
    "[ fig : copfin]a _ ) .",
    "the reason is that a fock state _ is much more prone to thermalization _",
    "[ fig : copfin]b ) .",
    "this allows it to both deliver power and absorb heat ( fig .",
    "[ fig : copfin]b ) to a higher degree than a coherent state , as discussed following .",
    "contrary to work extraction , cooling requires the maximization of heat absorption ( @xmath15 ) . among all the pure states , fock state has the largest heat absorption capacity , as can be seem from eq . .",
    "\\(iii ) other types of nonclassical initial states , such as schroedinger - cat states @xcite yield a cop ( fig .",
    "[ fig : copfin]a ) that is _ below that of a fock state _ with the same @xmath183 , but above that of the corresponding coherent state",
    ".    _ b ) in an initial thermal state , _ since the work capacity is zero , using for qr action implies that @xmath184 : p should then be hotter than h. in the course of its evolution , p will remain in a thermal state , but @xmath185 will decrease until it attains @xmath186 and stops cooling .",
    "explicitly , an initial thermal state yields    @xmath187    the corresponding maximal @xmath188 conforms to that of an absorption refrigerator , which is always lower than the cop of a power ( work ) driven refrigerator @xcite .      the coupling of the two - level system ( tls ) _ to spectrally separated baths _ ( as in fig .",
    "[ fig : work]b ) is achievable by _ spectrally filtered , local _ heat - pump and heat - dump .",
    "the filter can be realized by coupling the tls through a harmonic - oscillator mode of frequency @xmath189 ( @xmath190 ) ( `` the filter '' ) to the bath . in this way",
    "the tls becomes _ effectively _ coupled to two baths with response spectra @xcite ( fig 4(c ) )    @xmath191    where @xmath192 is the coupling rate of the tls to the filter mode , @xmath193 is the original coupling spectrum ( without the filter ) , and    @xmath194    p being the principal value , is the respective bath - induced lamb shift @xcite .",
    "thus , for any given spectrum @xmath193 we obtain the effective response spectrum which is a `` skewed lorentzian '' with controllable width and center .",
    "these parameters may thus be chosen to avoid unwarranted overlap between the coupling spectra of the two baths .",
    "the fully quantum autonomous heat engine whose work extraction is determined by nonpassivity should be able to reproduce in the semiclassical limit the power extraction of an externally ( _ parametrically _ ) modulated heat engine ( proposed in @xcite ) that obeys the cyclic work definition [ 14 ] ( eq.(1 ) ) , and is governed , instead of @xmath195 in and by the hamiltoninan    @xmath196    while the coupling to the baths is still given by    the two descriptions coincide when the initial state of the quantum piston is a large - amplitude coherent state @xmath197 .",
    "the extracted power by a piston in an initially coherent state piston is ( eq .",
    "( 35 ) ) @xmath198 . for an externally modulated engine , ( governed by ) ,",
    "it is @xmath199 @xcite .",
    "thus , a parametric modulation amplitude @xmath200 provides the same power extraction as the nonpassive coherent state @xmath201 .",
    "it is instructive to compare our analysis to that of the maser , which has long been treated as a heat machine @xcite : its thermodynamic efficiency is given by the ratio of the output ( signal ) and pump frequencies , which is the same as the carnot bound . in our scenario there is no population inversion in the system , and instead the gain is provided by the hot bath , but the analogy is complete .",
    "we may recover the maser - gain result for quasiclassical coherent - state preparation of the piston , which is the counterpart of the maser - output ( signal ) mode , upon substituting the hot bath for the maser - pump mode . yet there is currently no analysis of the maser efficiency dependence on its initial state , let alone",
    "any indication that it may lead to above - carnot efficiency , since such analysis should rely on the use of nonpassivity for work capacity , as detailed above .    for an initial coherent state with large @xmath202 ( semiclassical limit ) and spectrally separated baths , such that only @xmath203 and @xmath204 are",
    "non - zero , we find for @xmath205 ,    @xmath206    where    @xmath207    the corresponding efficiency bound becomes @xmath208    which is the same as in the maser model @xcite .    ) for different initial piston states : coherent ( continuous ) , fock ( dot - dashed ) and thermal ( dashed ) . the carnot cop bound ( dotted , thin ) is slightly below the coherent - state cop .",
    "both thermal - state and fock - state cop asymptotically coincide to the the absorption bound at @xmath209 .",
    "while at short times the fock state has the largest cop , the coherent state outperforms it at long times , with a cop above the carnot efficiency .",
    "( b ) entropy ( in units of @xmath210 ) of the same states as a function of time .",
    "the initially rapid entropy increase of the fock state explains its high cop at short times , while for the coherent state the entropy increase is slow but steady , resulting in the highest cop at large times .",
    "( c ) phase - plane plots of the distribution evolution illustrate that the high resilience of a coherent state against thermalization , as opposed to the low resilience ( fragility ) of fock and schroedinger - cat states , explains the cop evolution .",
    "the spectral separation conditions are as in fig .",
    "[ fig : work]b , but the piston frequency is chosen to ensure cooling , ( @xmath111 ) . the initial mean energy complies with eq .",
    "the present paper has formulated a comprehensive , unified framework for the analysis of heat - engine and refrigerator thermodynamics under the hitherto unexplored quantized - piston drive , both generally and for the simplest ( minimal ) autonomous model consisting of a two - level system coupled to a quantized - oscillator piston :    1)_work - extraction capacity by a quantum piston _ is described in terms of its _ deviation from a passive state_. we stress that work extraction as defined by the nonpassivity of the piston state , is the only rigorously justifiable measure of work under _ time - independent _ hamiltonian action @xcite .",

    "it shows that the piston may serve as a _ low - entropy resource _ excluded by the standard ( classical - parametric ) limit of work extraction .",
    "the cost of such preparation in terms of energy and entropy _ does not invalidate _ the extra efficiency obtained quantum mechanically in the gain regime . as a consistency check",
    "we have shown that the nonpassive work - capacity rate ( power ) coincides in the semiclassical limit with that of a parametrically - driven engine @xcite that obeys the standard cyclic - work definition ( sec .",
    "one should keep in mind that the carnot bound of a two - bath heat machine strictly applies only for a zero - entropy piston @xcite .",
    "by contrast , the efficiency derived by us is valid upon allowing for the inevitable but commonly ignored piston entropy growth and its linear amplification at finite times , at the steady - state of the system coupled to the baths .",
    "this efficiency is both practically and conceptually important for elucidating heat - engine principles in the quantum domain : in this domain , the initial _ `` charging '' of the piston _ by quantum state - preparation ( fig .",
    "1c ) is sought to be maximally efficient . in this respect",
    ", our analysis has yielded nontrivial results : ( a ) in particular , it is remarkable _ that as the initial coherent amplitude of the piston decreases , the resulting efficiency increases _ , although the _ entropy growth _ of the piston might then be expected to reduce ( rather than enhance ) the efficiency .",
    "( b ) work extraction obtained from an initial coherent - state has been found to be superior that of other states , because of its larger sustainable nonpassivity , conditioned on its low entropy production : equivalently , this reflects the fact that the coherent state is the `` pointer - state '' of the evolution @xcite .",
    "\\2 ) our analysis has also produced several important conclusions concerning _ autonomous quantized refrigerators _",
    ", both generally and in the same setup as the heat engine analyzed above :    \\(a ) while the semiclassical limit of piston dynamics coincides with that of an externally ( classically ) driven qr , once the piston is also quantized , the qr action is dramatically modified : it proves _",
    "advantageous for the quantum piston to increase its temperature and entropy _ during the process , so that its energy exchange with the system is a combination of heat and work production .",
    "the instability ( rapid entropy increase ) of an initial fock state compared to an initial coherent state makes fock states temporarily superior in terms of cooling .",
    "remarkably , the cop for an initial fock state exceeds the classical ( carnot ) cop , albeit at short times ( fig .",
    "[ fig : copfin]a ) .",
    "\\(b ) the quantized piston , once charged , does not require any external energy source to drive the qr , until it runs out of energy .",
    "this could be relevant in situations where external power is scarce or where miniaturization of the power source is an advantage .",
    "\\(c ) this autonomous qr may act in dual mode : the work stored in an initial pure state of the piston may be used to run the machine as a carnot qr ( driven by work ) , as long as the piston is below the critical temperature .",
