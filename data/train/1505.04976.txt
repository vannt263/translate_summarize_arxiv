    "quantum coherent control of photo - induced processes  @xcite directs a quantum system from its initial state to desired final state(s ) by manipulating interferences among coherent excitation pathways . when using strong femtosecond laser pulses , control can be realized  based on the broad spectrum , high intensity and ultrashort duration of the pulses  by tailoring their temporal shape  @xcite .",
    "coherent control using tailored short pulses is nowadays successfully employed in many different areas of quantum physics , including photoionization and fragmentation , nuclear magnetic resonance and quantum information processing .",
    "however , the dream of coherently controlling photo - induced bimolecular chemical reactions  @xcite which was at the origin of coherent control , still stands open .",
    "for example , it is not yet understood under which conditions a bimolecular reaction can be controlled and which reaction mechanisms are particularly susceptible to control .",
    "this dream has attracted significant interest over the years including that of moshe shapiro  @xcite since it holds the promise of creating a new type of photochemistry .",
    "two possible scenarios for the coherent control of a bimolecular reaction have been discussed in the literature .",
    "the first one relies on preparing coherent superposition states , in order to determine the outcome of the reaction  @xcite . realizing this scenario requires control over reactive collisions which currently seems to be extremely challenging .",
    "given , however , recent advances with cold  @xcite and ultracold molecules  @xcite , we may witness the advent of such a coherent chemistry in the not too distant future .",
    "the second scenario utilizes interference in time rather than frequency domain , i.e. , it is built on short , shaped pulses to induce bond making ( photoassociation ) and breaking ( photodissociation )  @xcite .",
    "the coherence of the reactants required for controlling bond making must then be prepared during the photo - induced process .",
    "this is the reason why coherent control of a binary reaction has proven so difficult .",
    "the quantumness of an ensemble of reaction partners can be measured in terms of the purity , @xmath0 $ ] , where @xmath1 describes the state of the reaction partners , initially a thermal ensemble , @xmath2 $ ] .",
    "note that the purity is closely related to the entropy of the sample ; and thus the coherent interaction of the reaction partners with the laser light does not change the purity .",
    "preparation of coherence can still be achieved by addressing a subensemble of reactants .",
    "one possibility is given by filtering out collision pairs in a small franck - condon window close to the repulsive barrier of the potential , as demonstrated by us in multi - photon femtosecond photoassociation of hot magnesium atoms  @xcite .",
    "the selected collision pairs are correlated due to the strong interaction close to the barrier .",
    "correspondingly , the subensemble of photoassociated , electronically excited molecules shows coherent transient vibrational and rotational dynamics that were identified using pump - probe femtosecond spectroscopy  @xcite .",
    "the generation of molecular coherence was shown to be possible , even though the thermal ensemble of atoms was completely incoherent , with an initial purity of essentially zero .",
    "the generated coherences are amenable to coherent control , as demonstrated by us very recently  @xcite : the yield of detected magnesium dimers is enhanced by positively chirped pulses and suppressed by negatively chirped pulses . our _ ab initio _ model has revealed that control is achieved by purification combined with chirp - dependent raman transitions .",
    "then , in closed - loop optimization experiments , an improved pulse was obtained that displays an effective temporal linear chirp and is composed of two sub - pulses .",
    "the latter allows for utilizing coherent vibrational dynamics in addition to the chirp - dependent raman transitions  @xcite .    here",
    ", we utilize the insight gained earlier  @xcite and demonstrate an even higher degree of coherent control over bond making in femtosecond photoassociation of hot magnesium atoms , achieving up to an order - of - magnitude enhancement of the yield compared to the unshaped transform - limited pulse .",
    "the highly performing phase - shaped pulses all display an overall temporally increasing instantaneous frequency and are composed of several overlapping sub - pulses , where the time separation between the first two sub - pulses almost perfectly fits the vibrational frequency of the generated intermediate wavepacket .",

    "<S> we find up to an order of magnitude enhancement of the yield compared to the unshaped transform - limited pulse . </S>",
    "<S> the highly performing pulses all display an overall temporally increasing instantaneous frequency and are composed of several overlapping sub - pulses . </S>",
    "<S> the time delay between the first two sub - pulses almost perfectly fits the vibrational frequency of the generated intermediate wavepacket . </S>",
    "<S> these findings are in agreement with chirp - dependent raman transitions and exploitation of vibrational dynamics as underlying control mechanisms . </S>"
