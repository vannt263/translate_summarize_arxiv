    "in four years of data taking , icecube has observed high energy starting events ( hese ) with deposited energies between 60 tev and 2 pev @xcite .",
    "the scientific debate about the origin of these events is extremely lively .",
    "there is little doubt that cosmic neutrinos have been seen , but their origin is not yet understood .    in this work ,",
    "we focus our attention on two specific classes of events , not yet observed , that can give us precious information on the extra terrestrial component of neutrinos flux : the so - called double pulse events , due to tau - neutrinos @xcite , and the cascades above 2 pev that include events due to electron antineutrinos interacting at the glashow resonance .",
    "the @xmath0 are not expected to be produced in astrophysical sources ( nor in the atmosphere ) but they are predicted to be a non negligible component of the cosmic neutrino flux due to flavor oscillations @xcite and thus represent a distinctive signature of a cosmic population . at low energy , it is impossible to distinguish cascades produced by charged current ( cc ) interactions of @xmath0 from those produced by cc - interactions of @xmath7 and neutral current ( nc ) interactions of all neutrino flavors .",
    "the only way to tag @xmath0 is to observe a double pulse in the detector @xcite , which is produced by the cc - interaction of @xmath0 , when @xmath8 is produced , followed by a second energy release , when the @xmath8 decays . a very recent analyses from icecube @xcite , dedicated to the search of these events with different topology with respect to tracks and cascades , reported a null result .",
    "we discuss the implications of this result and the perspective for future @xmath0 detection .    the second class of events considered in this paper are cascades with deposited energy above 2 pev ; these events can be produced by deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) of high energy @xmath7 and @xmath0 and by @xmath1 interacting with electrons through glashow resonance @xcite . as already discussed in @xcite , the rate of these events",
    "depends on the neutrino production mechanisms .",
    "in particular , since glashow resonance is only possible for @xmath1 , a larger signal is expected if neutrinos are produced by @xmath3 collisions with respect to the case of @xmath9 interactions ( see @xcite for a review on the spectra of secondary particles produced in @xmath3 and @xmath4 interaction ) , being indeed the antineutrino fraction larger in the first case .",
    "the possibility to discriminate among the two mechanisms depends on the relative contributions of events produced by dis and glashow resonance .",
    "we perform a realistic calculation of these contributions . differently from previous work on the subject @xcite",
    ", we discuss the role of leptonic channels in glashow resonance that can be correctly evaluated only if the difference between the incoming neutrino energy and the energy deposited in the detector is taken into account .",
    "the expected rates of both classes of events depend on the assumed neutrino energy distribution .",
    "our nominal hypothesis is that the cosmic neutrino spectra are described by single power law that extends until 10 pev .",
    "we consider the neutrino spectral index as a free parameter and we fix the normalization of fluxes by requiring that they produce the events observed by icecube at low energies ( i.e. below 2 pev ) .",
    "we thus obtain the expected rates of double pulse and cascades above 2 pev as a function of the slope of the neutrino spectrum .",
    "this permits us to discuss the relevance of the assumed neutrino energy distribution for future @xmath0 detection , for the discrimination of @xmath3 or @xmath9 production mechanism and/or for the observation of high energy cutoff , automatically implementing the present information provided by icecube at low energy .",
    "the plan of the paper is the following : in sec.[sec1 ] we describe our assumptions on the cosmic neutrino flux , in sec.[sec2 ] we calculate the expected number of double pulse events in icecube and in sec.[sec3 ] the expected number of cascades with deposited energy avove 2 pev . in sec.[sec4 ]",
    "we made a comparison between our results and previous works on these subjects and finally , in sec.[sec5 ] , we draw our conclusions .",
    "we assume that the total flux of cosmic neutrinos ( and antineutrinos ) has an isotropic distribution and that the spectrum can be described by a power law @xmath10 that extends till @xmath11 . recalling that neutrinos take about 1/20 of the energy of the parent proton in cosmic ray interactions",
    ", this means that we are considering protons with energies up to 200 pev in their sources .",
    "it is generally expected that , due to flavor oscillations , a cosmic neutrino population is characterized by a flavor content @xmath12 independently on the specific production mechanism . in reality , a certain imprint of the neutrino production mechanism does remain , as it is discussed e.g. in @xcite .",
    "the fluxes divided per flavors can be generally given as : @xmath13 where @xmath14 and @xmath15 are ( small ) parameters described in @xcite that are determined by the neutrino flavor content at the source ( i.e. before oscillations ) .",
    "in the following , we consider the case of neutrino produced by charged pion decays for which @xmath16 , @xmath17 ; the errors are obtained by propagating uncertainties in neutrino oscillation parameters .",
    "the normalization of the flux @xmath18 is obtained by requiring that the number of events , due to cosmic neutrinos , reproduces the results obtained by icecube at low energies ( i.e. between 60 tev and 2 pev ) . in three years of data taking",
    ", icecube has observed @xmath19 events against an expected background of @xmath20 events from atmospheric muons and neutrinos .",
    "we require that the number of events from astrophysical neutrinos , calculated as : @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the observation time and @xmath23 are the _ effective areas _ for the various neutrino flavors given in @xcite , is equal to @xmath24 .",
    "we introduced an upper integration limit to mimic the effect of the icecube observation threshold at 2 pev . by following the above procedure",
    ", we obtain the flux normalization : @xmath25 \\label{fa}\\ ] ] note that the coefficient @xmath18 determines the flux of cosmic neutrinos at 1 pev . in the power law assumption , see eq.([pl ] ) , this quantity is relatively well constrained being equal to @xmath26 for @xmath27 and @xmath28 for @xmath29 .",
    "as stated in the introduction , one of the goals of this work is to discuss the detection of the @xmath0 component of the high energy ( he ) neutrino flux providing the proof of existence of a cosmic population .",
    "we are interested to investigate the dependence of the expected number of double pulse events from the energy distribution of cosmic neutrinos and from the icecube observation time .    in order to perform this calculation",
    "we need the effective area for double pulse events , @xmath30 , recently published by the icecube collaboration @xcite .",
    "following the icecube prescription , the expected number of double pulse events in the observation time @xmath22 is @xmath31 where the differential flux of the @xmath0 component , @xmath32 is normalized to reproduce the hese events observed by icecube ( see previous section ) .    in order to discuss the dependence of @xmath33 from the spectral index @xmath34 , it is useful to give an analytical description of the icecube effective area . considering that double pulse events are a _ subset _ of the events caused by cc tau neutrino interactions , we describe the effective area as , @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the effective area for @xmath0 calculated in @xcite , the factor @xmath37 gives the fraction of @xmath0 interactions that are due to cc processes and the constant @xmath38 describes the effect of geometrical and quality cuts implemented by icecube for the search of these events .",
    "the function @xmath39 describes the probability that a neutrino with energy @xmath40 produces a tau traveling more than @xmath41 before it decays , where @xmath41 is the minimum distance to give rise to an observable double pulse in the detector .",
    "we expect that @xmath41 is of the order of tens of meters with @xmath42 km ; we checked that the changes are not conspicuous in the range of energies of interest .",
    "] , that is the typical distance between the doms @xcite .",
    "the taus produced in cc - dis have an average energy equal to : @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the mean inelasticity which is nearly constant in the energy range that we are considering @xcite . if we neglect @xmath8 energy dispersion and assume the one - to - one relationship between @xmath45 and @xmath46 expressed by eq.([etau ] ) , the probability @xmath39 is given by : @xmath47\\ ] ] where @xmath48 represents the minimum neutrino energy which is necessary to produce a tau with decay length larger than @xmath41 .",
    "this can be calculated as : @xmath49 with @xmath50 and @xmath51 .    using the expression in eq.([2p ] ) , we find that the effective area of icecube , in the energy region from 0.1 to 10 pev , is reasonably well described setting @xmath52 that corresponds to @xmath53 m. in other words the following parameterized expression for the effective area can be used : @xmath54 \\beta=0.455\\\\[1ex ]   e_{\\mbox{\\tiny min}}=0.5\\mbox { pev}\\end{array } \\right\\},\\ ] ] as showed in fig.[2bangeff ] for a direct comparison of the icecube effective area .",
    "using the previous expression it is possible to obtain an accurate analytical formula for the expected number of double pulse events @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the incomplete gamma function and the normalization of @xmath57 flux is assumed to be @xmath58 , as it is expected for neutrinos produced by charged pions decays with few @xmath2 uncertainty due to errors in the neutrino oscillation parameters ( see previous section for details ) . to check our result , we compare with icecube calculations in @xcite finding agreement at the level of few percents .",
    "the above expression allows us to investigate the dependences of the expected number of double pulse events on the spectral index @xmath34 and on the high energy cutoff @xmath59 of the neutrino spectrum .",
    "in particular , it permits us to show that our knowledge of the neutrino spectrum is already sufficient to make significative predictions .",
    "the number of double pulse events expected in 4 years of data taking is 0.66 , 0.53 , 0.41 , 0.31 for @xmath60 and @xmath61 , so it is not surprising that icecube have not seen double pulse events so far .",
    "our calculations are done by adopting the nominal cutoff energy @xmath62 pev .",
    "however , the predicted values are not strongly dependent on the assumed high energy cutoff . for @xmath63 ,",
    "the counting rate varies indeed by only @xmath64 when the cutoff energy is varied within the decade @xmath65 pev . for larger values of @xmath34 ,",
    "the dependence of @xmath66 on @xmath59 is considerably weaker .",
    "the dependence of @xmath66 on the spectral index mainly arises from the normalization @xmath18 of the cosmic neutrino flux at @xmath67 , see eq.([pl ] ) .",
    "the residual dependence on @xmath34 is relatively weak and affects the final results at the few @xmath2 level when @xmath68 .",
    "a good approximation for the predicted number of double pulses is thus given by : @xmath69 we remind that the normalization @xmath18 is constrained within a factor of @xmath70 for @xmath71 . this can be better appreciated from fig.[parental ] , where we show with a yellow line the integrand @xmath72 of calculated for @xmath73.the function @xmath74 is peaked around 0.5 pev and approximately one half of the double pulse signal is due to neutrinos with initial energy below 2 pev , i.e. to the energy region already probed by hese observations in icecube .",
    "finally , we show in figure [ 2bang ] the probability to observe at least one double pulse as a function of spectral index and number of years .        to observe a double pulse in icecube with a probability greater than 90 @xmath2 we must wait about 10 years in the most favorable case ( @xmath27 ) , about 15 years in the case @xmath73 and much more if the spectral index is close to @xmath29 .",
    "in this section we estimate the number of cascade events with deposited energy above @xmath75 in icecube .",
    "two types of cascade events are described : those from deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) and those produced by the glashow resonance @xcite .",
    "cascades from dis are mostly given by cc - interactions of @xmath7 and @xmath0 with a negligible contribution from nc interactions of neutrinos of all flavors , as discussed in the following .",
    "the expected number of cascades from dis , , is given by : @xmath76 \\label{dis}\\ ] ] where : + - @xmath77 and @xmath78 are the effective area for dis of @xmath7 and @xmath0 , which are calculated in sect . [ disentangling ] ; + - the factor @xmath79 is given in the previous section ; + - the function @xmath80 represents the probability that a cc - dis event produced by neutrino @xmath81 of energy @xmath82 has a visible energy above @xmath83 .      .__branching ratio of @xmath84 decay _ _ [ cols=\"^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ default ]    the ratios of the last two columns decreases with @xmath34 , because glashow resonance and deep inelastic scattering are more affected by a change of the slope with respect to the number of double pulse events , as we can see in the eqs.([prox1],[prox2],[prox3 ] ) . in order to clarify what is the relevant energy region of the parental neutrino flux giving a contribution to expected events discussed in this work , we show in fig.[parental ] the integrands @xmath85 of eqs.([tau1]-[dis]-[gr ] ) multiplied by an extra factor @xmath46 for the three channels analyzed in this paper for a spectral index @xmath73 .",
    "it is interesting to remark that also @xmath0 of about 0.5 pev can give rise to a `` double pulse '' event , because there is a compensation between the flux power law decrease and the probability to not decay that increases exponentially with the energy .",
    "for the three types of processes analyzed in the paper , under the hypothesis @xmath73 in the neutrino spectra .",
    "_ _ ]    the difference between @xmath3 and @xmath9 interaction at the source is already discussed in other works .",
    "we compare here with some of them , that are important and well - known , namely @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we point out the reasons why our analysis is different and show that , although results could seem to be incompatible , there are no contradictions .",
    "our analysis of the events with deposited energy above 2 pev shows that the rate in the case of @xmath9 interaction at the source is about 75 @xmath2 of the rate given by @xmath3 interaction .",
    "in fact , the difference is due to events produced by glashow resonance , but in this region of energy , the rate of dis events is large and this reduces the difference between the two types of mechanism .",
    "this is not in contradiction with what is written in the paper @xcite , in which the ratio between resonant and non resonant event above 2 pev , is about one half . in that analysis , in fact , _ the energy of incoming neutrino and not the deposited energy into the detector _",
    "is considered . when the deposited energy is considered instead , the neutral current interaction of all type of neutrinos and the charged current interaction of @xmath86 give a negligible contribution to cascade above 2 pev : this explain the difference between the results of the two papers .",
    "our analysis uses the deposited energy , since this is observable , and it is not simple ( or possible ) to reconstruct the energy of incoming neutrinos .",
    "that explain also the difference with respect to @xcite .    the comparison with @xcite concerns another important remark . even in this work , the difference between @xmath3 and @xmath9 interaction at the source is discussed and their conclusion is that the number of glashow events , in the case of @xmath3 mechanism , is about 6 times greater than what expected in the case of @xmath9 mechanism . again , this statement is not in contradiction with our statement , because _ they compare models with the same flux of protons at the source _ whereas we take into account the observed flux of neutrinos at the earth . in other words ,",
    "we ask ourselves what is the fraction of electron antineutrinos with respect to the _ observed _ total flux of neutrinos and , as a consequence , only the difference due to neutrinos oscillations is relevant for these considerations .",
    "the oscillations produce a difference of about a factor of 2 between the two mechanisms of production , and the additional difference found by @xcite is due to the different fraction of energy that neutrinos receive in the @xmath3 and @xmath9 production mechanism .",
    "the last remark concerns a hypothesis proposed in @xcite and @xcite , where it was suggested that the events observed above pev could be due to glashow resonance .",
    "if this was true , were caused by leptonic decay , since the energy resolution is incompatible with a visible energy being 6.32 pev .",
    "now , the ratio between hadronic and leptonic branching ratios is , @xmath87 and the same neutrino flux leads to leptonic and hadronic decays . to date",
    "there are three events with energy below 2 pev , so in the above assumption , we expect to have also 6 hadronic events .",
    "the probability to observe none is given by the poissonian pdf , @xmath88 , which is disfavored at 3 @xmath89 .",
    "in this paper we have considered two categories of very high energy events in icecube that can help to diagnose cosmic neutrinos : the double pulse events , that may allow us to clearly discriminate the cosmic component of @xmath0 ; the cascades with deposited energy above 2 pev , including events produced by @xmath1 at the glashow resonance , that can be used to investigate the cosmic neutrino production mechanisms .",
    "as stated in the introduction , we estimated the rate of these high energy events with the important constraint provided by the data already observed by icecube , i.e. we used the data collected in the low - energy region below @xmath70pev to normalize our calculations . in this way",
    ", we obtained the expected rates of high energy events as a function of the neutrino spectral index @xmath34 , that we varied in the range @xmath90 .",
    "we found that the non - observation of double pulse events does not contradict the hyphotesis of a cosmic neutrino population .",
    "this conclusion is only marginally dependent on the assumed cosmic neutrino spectrum .",
    "in fact , we have shown that : + _ i ) _ one half of the expected signal is due to neutrinos with energy below @xmath91 pev , i.e. _ from a spectral region that is already observed in the hese data _ ( see fig . [ parental ] and discussion in the section [ sec2 ] ) + _ ii ) _ in the most favorable case , with spectral index @xmath27 _ we need to wait about 10 more years to observe a double pulse with a probability greater than 90 @xmath2_.    concerning the cascades with deposited energy above 2 pev , we have shown that : + _ i ) _ due to the difference between the energy deposited in the detector and the energy of the interacting neutrino , the contribution of leptonic channels to glashow resonance events is suppressed by 75@xmath2 .",
    "this implies that hadronic modes account for 90@xmath2 of the total signal produced by glashow resonance above 2 pev ; + _ ii ) _ this class of events can be used to probe the high energy tail of the cosmic neutrino spectrum .",
    "the absence of cascades above 2 pev disfavours a neutrino spectral index @xmath27 ( with a cutoff @xmath92pev ) at about 2@xmath89 considering that 3 events are expected in the worst scenario ( @xmath9 interaction ) .",
    "an unbroken power law with @xmath29 is instead still compatible at 1@xmath89 with the present results .",
    "the absence of events close to the glashow resonance energy @xmath93pev is not problematic under this hypothesis , since only 0.4 events are expected due to glashow resonance after 4 years ( see the table [ sommario ] ) ; + _ iii ) _ the difference between the event rates produced by @xmath3 or @xmath4 neutrino production mechanisms is not large enough to distinguish among the two options , even if we assume that the parent neutrino spectrum is known .",
    "an observation time @xmath94 years would be required to obtain a @xmath5 discrimination , if the neutrino spectral index is @xmath73 .",

    "<S> we show that one half of the double pulse signal is due to the neutrinos spectral region already probed by icecube . by normalizing to hese data </S>",
    "<S> , we find that 10 more years are required to obtain 90@xmath2 probability to observe a double pulse . </S>",
    "<S> the cascades above 2 pev provide us a sensitive probe of the high energy tail of the neutrino spectrum and are potentially observable , but even in this case , the dependence on type of the source is mild . </S>",
    "<S> in fact we find that @xmath3 or @xmath4 mechanisms give a difference in the number of cascades above 2 pev of about 25 @xmath2 that can be discriminated at @xmath5 in @xmath6 years of data taking . </S>"
