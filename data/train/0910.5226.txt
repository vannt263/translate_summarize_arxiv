    "the optimization problem of packing regular tetrahedra densely in space has seen invigorated interest over the last few years @xcite .",
    "this interest has helped drive up the packing fraction of the densest - known such packings from @xmath2 in 2006 @xcite to @xmath3 @xcite most recently ( see table 3 ) .",
    "these improved packing fractions have been obtained from more and more complex packings , with larger and larger repeating units .",
    "this trend has led some to conjecture that the densest packing of tetrahedra might have inherent disorder @xcite .",
    "the more restrictive problem of packing tetrahedra transitively  that is , so that all tetrahedra in the packing are equivalent ( a more rigorous definition is given below )  has been less extensively studied and the densest previously - reported transitive packing of regular tetrahedra fills only @xmath4 of space @xcite . here",
    "we present a one - parameter family of transitive but dense packings of tetrahedra with the packing fraction @xmath0 .",
    "the discovery of this family of dense packings was inspired by the results of a numerical search , which yielded a dense packing with similar structural properties to the packing we present .",
    "the numerical method used was adapted from the _ divide and concur _ approach to constraint satisfaction problems @xcite .",
    "the _ divide and concur _ formalism enables us to set up an efficient search through the parameter space consisting of the positions and orientations of tetrahedra inside the repeating unit and the translation vectors governing its lattice repetition , subject to the constraint that no two tetrahedra overlap .",
    "the dynamics involved in the _ divide and concur _ search are highly non - physical , which might explain why our method was able to discover this dense packing , while earlier methods involving more physical dynamics were not @xcite . in this note",
    "we present only the analytically constructed packing without a full explication of the numerical method , which will be forthcoming .",
    "the construction of the dimer - double - lattice family of packings in terms of the parameter @xmath5 in a general monoclinic coordinate basis ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "the packing is generated starting from the fundamental tetrahedron by the action of the space group .",
    "a packing of regular tetrahedra is obtained when the general monoclinic coordinate basis reduces to the specified orthogonal coordinate basis .",
    "[ cols= \" < , < \" , ]",
    "in table 3 , we compare the packings presented here to other studied packings of regular tetrahedra .",
    "both packings are denser than the densest previously - reported transitive packing , a double lattice presented by conway and torquato ( which we call the `` warp - and - weft '' packing due to the interweaving arrangement of its tetrahedra ) @xcite , and the dimer double lattice is denser than any previously - reported packing .",
    "the results presented go against the recent trend of ever - growing repeating units in densest - known packings and demonstrate that a large repeating unit is not a necessary property of a dense packing of regular tetrahedra .",
    "it is curious that previous simulations , utilizing a more physical search dynamic @xcite , yielded dense packings that were either disordered , had quasicrytalline order , or had crystalline order characterized by a very large repeating unit , and were not able to find the denser class of structures presented here , ( reminiscent perhaps of kurt vonnegut s ice - nine , a fictional phase of water that is more stable , but kinetically unreachable ) .",
    "our results yield the surprising situation wherein the densest - known packing of icosahedra is now sparser than the corresponding packing of tetrahedra , a solid which just four years ago was a prime candidate for a counterexample of a conjecture by ulam that the sphere is the sparsest - packing convex solid @xcite .",
    "as the packing can be generally extended to any tetrahedron in a three - parameter family generated by deformations of the monoclinic coordinate basis , if any tetrahedron provides a counterexample of ulam s conjecture , it is not a tetrahedron of that family .",
    "the regular tetrahedron is no longer outcast , as it long was , from the respectable family of convex polyhedra whose largest - achieved packing density is realized by a transitive arrangement . while there are some convex solids whose maximum packing density clearly can not be achieved by a transitive arrangement ( the convex schmitt - conway - danzer polyhedron can tile space , but only in aperiodic and non - transitive ways @xcite ) , the majority of regular and semi - regular polyhedra have been to - date packed most densely in transitive packings @xcite . whether this situation is accidental , the result of bias favoring the discovery of transitive packings , or a more fundamental property governing",
    "the packing of a certain class of solids is still an open question ."
