    "theoretical analysis of strong interaction processes rests on the quantum non - abelian gauge field theory , namely , quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) .",

    "the former are the constituents of hadrons , while the latter are quanta of a massless gauge vector field , which provides interaction between quarks .",
    "gluons and quarks carry a specific quantum number , which plays a key role in hadron physics .",
    "it was first introduced in the mid 1960s in ref .",
    ", and later it was named@xcite `` color '' .",
    "the comprehensive theoretical and experimental investigations revealed that the strong interaction possesses two distinctive features .",
    "first , the interaction between quarks inside the hadrons weakens with increasing the characteristic energy of a process . in other words , the invariant charge",
    "is also called the ( strong ) running coupling of  qcd . ]",
    "vanishes at large momenta transferred , representing the so - called asymptotic freedom of the theory .",
    "second , free quarks and gluons have not been observed , at least until the present time . here",
    "we are dealing with the color confinement .",
    "these two phenomena are related to hadron dynamics at different energy scales .",
    "the asymptotic freedom takes place at large values of energies , or in the so - called ultraviolet ( uv ) region .",
    "it corresponds to small ( @xmath1fm ) quark separations . on the contrary",
    ", the color confinement is related to the low - energy , or infrared ( ir ) domain , that corresponds to large quark separations , namely , @xmath2fm .",
    "theoretical description of the asymptotic freedom was first performed in the mid 1970s in refs .  .",
    "these papers gave rise to wide employment of perturbative calculations in quantum chromodynamics .",
    "indeed , if the value of invariant charge is small , then one can parameterize unknown quantities by perturbative power series in the running coupling . on the one hand , this drastically simplifies analysis of hadron interactions in the uv region . on the other hand ,",
    "the hadron dynamics at low energies , in particular , the quark confinement , entirely remains beyond the scope of perturbation theory . as a rule , description of the qcd experimental data in the ir region requires invoking other nonperturbative approaches , for instance , phenomenological potential models ( refs .   ) , sum rules method ( refs .   ) , string models,@xcite bag models,@xcite variational perturbation theory ( refs .   ) , and lattice simulations ( refs .   ) .",
    "the renormalization group ( rg ) method plays a fundamental role in the framework of quantum field theory ( qft ) and its applications .",
    "it was developed almost half a century ago in refs .   and",

    "theoretical analysis of hadron dynamics relies , in main part , upon the rg method .",
    "meanwhile , the construction of exact solutions to the renormalization group equation , which is a rather nontrivial mathematical problem itself , is still far from being feasible .",
    "usually , in order to describe the strong interaction processes in asymptotical uv region , one applies the rg method together with perturbative calculations . in this case",
    ", the _ a priori _ unknown renormalization group functions are parameterized by the power series in the qcd running coupling .",
    "ultimately , this leads to approximate solutions of rg equation , which are commonly used for quantitative analysis of experimental data",
    ". however , employment of perturbation theory in the framework of renormalization group method generates unphysical singularities of such solutions .",
    "the latter are in contradiction with the basic principles of local quantum field theory .",
    "for example , solution to rg equation for invariant charge gains unphysical singularities due to perturbative approximation of the @xmath0  function . at the one - loop level",
    "there is the so - called landau pole , and account of the higher - loop corrections just introduces additional singularities of the cut type into expression for the running coupling ( see  [ sect : rcpert ] ) .",
    "an effective way to overcome such difficulties was proposed@xcite in the late 1950s by p.j .",
    "it consists in invoking into consideration the analyticity requirement , which follows from the general principles of local qft .",

    "the latter implies the definite analytic properties in @xmath3  variable for the invariant charge .",

    "semiaxis of real  @xmath3 .    in the general case the qcd invariant charge",
    "is defined as a product of propagators and a vertex function ( see , e.g. , ref .  ) .",
    "therefore , one might pose a question concerning the analytic properties of this quantity .",
    "this matter has been examined in ref .  , and it was shown therein that in this case the integral representation of the type holds for the running coupling ,  too . proceeding from these motivations , the analytic approach was lately extended@xcite to quantum chromodynamics by d.v .",

    "the description of hadron interaction at low energies remains a long  standing challenge of quantum chromodynamics .",
    "some insight into many basic problems of elementary particle physics can be gained form constructing the models , which adequately account both the perturbative and intrinsically nonperturbative traits of hadron dynamics .",
    "certainly , such studies are useful for further development of the strong interaction theory . besides",
    ", the description and interpretation of many experimental data can be performed only by invoking such models .",
    "thus , the results obtained in this field could expand our scope of knowledge concerning the nature of fundamental interactions .",

    "the model is formulated in detail with a specific attention to the properties of the analytic running coupling and to verification of the model s self - consistency .",
    "the principally new way of involving the analyticity condition into the rg formalism is a distinguishing feature of this model .",
    "namely , the analyticity requirement is imposed on the perturbative expansion of the renormalization group @xmath0  function .",
    "eventually it leads to a number of profitable traits of this running coupling , that enables one to describe a wide range of the strong interaction processes both of perturbative and intrinsically nonperturbative nature .",

    "further , the developed approach is applied to description of gluon condensate , inclusive @xmath7  lepton decay , and electron  positron annihilation into hadrons .",
    "the congruity of estimated values of the scale parameter testifies that the analytic invariant charge substantially incorporates , in a consistent way , both perturbative and intrinsically nonperturbative aspects of quantum chromodynamics .    in the conclusions ( section  [ sect : concl ] ) the properties of the analytic invariant charge are summarized and the basic results are formulated in a compact way .",
    "the auxiliary materials are collected in the appendixes . in  [ sect : rcpert ] the perturbative solutions to the rg equation for qcd running coupling are derived at different loop levels . in  [ sect : lambw ] the lambert  @xmath8 function is briefly described .",

    "the solution to the renormalization group equation  ( [ rggen ] ) gains unphysical singularities due to perturbative approximation of the @xmath0  function  ( [ betapert ] ) .",
    "such a representation of the right - hand side of the rg equation proves to be justified in the ultraviolet region , where the asymptotic freedom takes place .",

    "in fact , since the strong running coupling @xmath19 is of a fixed sign , the condition that invariant charge has the only left cut in  @xmath3 means that the right - hand side of the rg equation  ( [ rggen ] ) , as a function of @xmath3 , has no singularities in the region of positive  @xmath3 .",

    "thus , the prescription proposed ultimately leads to elimination of the landau pole in a multiplicative way .",

    "it turns out that for the consistency of involving the analyticity requirement with the definition of the invariant charge  ( [ invchrgdef ] ) , one has to apply the analytization procedure  ( [ defan ] ) to the logarithmic derivative of the green function @xmath55 .",
    "really , if the spectral function of the representation for the green function @xmath52 is of a fixed sign ( that is true for the leading orders of perturbation theory ) , then @xmath52 has no zeros in the complex @xmath3plane .",

    "<S> this paper gives an overview of recently developed model for the qcd analytic invariant charge . </S>",
    "<S> its underlying idea is to bring the analyticity condition , which follows from the general principles of local quantum field theory , in perturbative approach to renormalization group ( rg ) method . </S>",
    "<S> the concrete realization of the latter consists in explicit imposition of analyticity requirement on the perturbative expansion of @xmath0  function for the strong running coupling , with subsequent solution of the corresponding rg equation . in turn , this allows one to avoid the known difficulties originated in perturbative approximation of the rg functions . ultimately , the proposed approach results in qualitatively new properties of the qcd invariant charge . </S>",
    "<S> the latter enables one to describe a wide range of the strong interaction processes both of perturbative and intrinsically nonperturbative nature .    </S>",
