    "in this work we provide a complete and rigorous description of phase transitions in a general class of kinetic models describing self - propelled particles interacting through alignment .",
    "these models have broad applications in physics , biology and social sciences for instance for the description of animal swarming behavior or opinion consensus formation .",
    "their essential feature is the competition between the alignment process which provides self - organization , and noise which destroys it .",
    "an important point is that both the alignment frequency and noise intensity depend on a measure of the local alignment denoted by  @xmath0 . the phase transition behavior in the spatially homogeneous case is totally encoded in the ratio between these two functions denoted by  @xmath1 .",
    "namely we have the following features :    * the function  @xmath2 gives rise to an algebraic compatibility relation whose roots provide the different branches of equilibria of the kinetic model .",
    "one distinguished branch is given by isotropic or uniform distributions which correspond to no alignment at all , i.e.  @xmath3 .",
    "the other branches are associated to non - isotropic von mises  fisher distributions associated to non - zero  @xmath0 . *",
    "the stability of these various equilibria is completely determined by the monotonicity of a function derived from  @xmath2 around these roots and there exists an exponential rate of local convergence of the solution to one of these stable equilibria . *",
    "the global shape of this function  @xmath2 provides the phase diagram which encodes the order of the associated phase transitions . according to its monotonicity",
    ", these can be second - order phase transitions , first - order phase transitions with hysteresis behavior or even be more complex . for second - order phase transition",
    ", we give an explicit formula for the critical exponent in terms of the local behavior of  @xmath2 .",
    "the involved phase transitions are spontaneous symmetry breaking phase transitions between isotropic and non - isotropic equilibria .",
    "such phase transitions appear in many branches of physics , such as spontaneous magnetization in ferromagnetism , nematic phase transition in liquid crystals and polymers , higgs mechanism of mass generation for the elementary particles .",
    "* in the spatially inhomogeneous case , we can derive the hydrodynamic equations associated to both the isotropic and non - isotropic stable equilibria ( the former leading to diffusion behavior , the latter to hyperbolic models ) .",
    "the hyperbolicity is again completely determined by this function , and is linked to the critical exponent in the case of a second - order phase transition .    to our knowledge , this is the first time that a complete mathematical theory of phase transitions in a physics system can be rigorously derived and related to one single object with high physical significance : this function  @xmath2 .",
    "one of the main achievement of this work is theorem  [ thm - strong - stability - anisotropic ] , which provides part of point  @xmath4 above , namely the nonlinear stability of the non - isotropic equilibria ( the von mises  fisher distributions ) when the function associated to  @xmath2 is increasing . to be more precise ,",
    "let us write this set of equilibria as  @xmath5 ( it has the same symmetries as the unit sphere  @xmath6 of  @xmath7 ,  @xmath8 being the dimension of the model ) .",
    "then , we have a rate of convergence  @xmath9 and two positive constants  @xmath10 and  @xmath11 such that , if the initial condition  @xmath12 satisfies  @xmath13 for some  @xmath14 , then there exist  @xmath15 such that for all  @xmath16 , the solution  @xmath17 of the spatially homogeneous model satisfies @xmath18 this stability result takes place in the sobolev space  @xmath19 as long as  @xmath20 . in previous works ( in the case where the function  @xmath2 is linear ) such as  @xcite or  @xcite ( for the kuramoto model in dimension  @xmath21 , where a precise study of the attractor is performed ) , the exponential convergence with rate  @xmath22 was only proven for all  @xmath23 , and the existence of such a constant  @xmath11 independent of  @xmath12 was lacking .",
    "self - propelled particle systems interacting through alignment have been widely used in the modeling of animal swarms ( see e.g. the review  @xcite and  @xcite )",
    ". kinetic models of self - propelled particles have been introduced and studied in  @xcite . here , specifically , we are interested in understanding phase transitions and continuum models associated to the vicsek particle system  @xcite .",
    "phase transitions in the vicsek system have been widely studied in the physics literature  @xcite .",
    "there have been some controversies whether the involved phase transitions were first or second order . in some sense",
    ", this paper provides a complete answer to this question , at least in the kinetic framework .",
    "the passage from the kinetic to macroscopic descriptions of the vicsek system has first been proposed in  @xcite .",
    "further elaboration of the model can be found in  @xcite .",
    "the resulting continuum model is now referred to as the self - organized hydrodynamic ( soh ) model . in these derivations of the soh ,",
    "the noise and alignment intensities are functions of the local densities and not of the local alignment .",
    "no phase transition results from this choice but the resulting soh models are hyperbolic . in  @xcite , alignment intensity has been made proportional to the local alignment .",
    "second - order phase transition have been obtained .",
    "however , the resulting soh model is not hyperbolic . in the present paper ,",
    "we investigate general relations between the noise and alignment intensities upon the local alignment  @xmath0 .",
    "as described above , the phase diagram becomes extremely complex and its complexity is fully deciphered here .",
    "the kind of alignment phase transition that we find here is similar to nematic phase transitions in liquid crystals , polymer dynamics and ferromagnetism  @xcite .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows . in section",
    "[ sec - kinetic ] , we derive the kinetic model from the particle system and determine its equilibria . in section  [ sec - rates - convergence ] , we study the stability of these equilibria in the spatially homogeneous case and find the rates of convergences of the solution to the stable ones .",
    "then , in section  [ sec - phase - transition ] , we use these results to study two examples respectively leading to second order and first order phase transitions , and in the case of first order phase transitions , to the hysteresis phenomenon .",
    "finally , in section  [ sec - macro - models ] , we return to the spatially inhomogeneous case and investigate the macroscopic limit of the kinetic model towards hydrodynamic or diffusion models according to the considered type of equilibrium . for the hydrodynamic limit , we provide conditions for the model to by hyperbolic .",
    "finally , a conclusion is drawn in section  [ sec - conclu ] .",
    "we supplement this paper with appendix  [ sec - numeric ] which provides elements on the numerical simulation of the hysteresis phenomenon .",
    "in this section , we derive the mean - field kinetic model from the particle system , and determine its equilibria .",
    "we begin with the particle model in the next section .",
    "then , in section  [ subsec - mean - field ] we derive the mean - field limit .",
    "the space - homogeneous case will be highlighted in section  [ subsec - space - homogeneous ] and the equilibria will be determined in section  [ subsec - equilibria ] .",
    "we consider a system of a large number  @xmath24 of socially interacting agents defined by their positions  @xmath25 and the directions of their velocities  @xmath26 ( where  @xmath6 is the unit sphere of  @xmath7 ) .",
    "they obey the following rules , which are a time continuous version of those of the vicsek model  @xcite :    * they move at constant speed  @xmath27 , * they align with the average direction of their neighbors , as a consequence of the social interaction . *",
    "the directions of their velocities are subject to independent random noises , which expresses either some inaccuracy in the computation of the social force by the subject , or some trend to move away from the group in order to explore the surrounding environment .",
    "these rules are expressed by the following system of stochastic differential equations : @xmath28 eq",
    ".   simply translates that particle  @xmath29 moves with velocity  @xmath30 .",
    "the first term at the right - hand side of   is the social force , which takes the form of a relaxation of the velocity direction towards the mean direction of the neighbors  @xmath31 , with relaxation rate  @xmath32 ( the operator  @xmath33 is the projection on the tangent space orthogonal to  @xmath34 , ensuring that  @xmath34 remains a unit vector ) .",
    "states that the mean direction is obtained through the normalization of the average current  @xmath35 , itself computed as the average of the velocities of the particles .",
    "this average is weighted by the observation kernel  @xmath36 , which is a function of the distance between the test particle  @xmath29 and its considered partner  @xmath37 . without loss of generality , we can assume that  @xmath38 .",
    "the second term of   models the noise in the velocity direction .",
    "eq .   must be understood in the stratonovich sense ( as indicated by the symbol  @xmath39 ) , with  @xmath24 independent standard brownian motions  @xmath40 in  @xmath7 .",
    "the quantity  @xmath41 is the variance of the brownian processes .    in this paper",
    ", we assume that the relaxation rate  @xmath32 and the noise intensity  @xmath42 are functions of the norm of the current  @xmath43 .",
    "the present hypothesis constitutes a major difference with previous works .",
    "indeed , the case where  @xmath32 and  @xmath42 are constant has been investigated in  @xcite , while the case where  @xmath44 and  @xmath45 has been treated in  @xcite .",
    "we recall that no phase transition appears at the macroscopic level in the first case while in the second case , a phase transition appears .",
    "this phase transition corresponds to a change in the number of equilibria as the density crosses a certain threshold called critical density .",
    "the critical exponent is  @xmath46 in this case . here",
    ", we investigate the more general case of almost arbitrary dependences of  @xmath32 and  @xmath42 upon  @xmath43 , and show that the phase transition patterns can be much more complex than those found in  @xcite . for later convenience",
    ", we will denote by  @xmath47 the value of  @xmath48 .    to understand why  @xmath43 is the crucial parameter in this discussion ,",
    "let us introduce the local density  @xmath49 and order parameter ( or mean alignment )  @xmath50 as follows : @xmath51 and we note that  @xmath52 .",
    "the value  @xmath53 corresponds to disorganized motion , with an almost isotropic distribution of velocity directions , while  @xmath54 characterizes a fully organized system where particles are all aligned",
    ". therefore  @xmath55 appears as the `` density of alignment '' and increases with both particle density and order parameter .",
    "this paper highlights that the dependence of  @xmath32 and  @xmath42 upon  @xmath55 acts as a positive feedback which triggers the phase transition . besides",
    ", in  @xcite , it has been shown that making  @xmath32 and  @xmath42 depend on the density  @xmath56 only does not produce any phase transition , and that the recovered situation is qualitatively similar to that of  @xcite .",
    "the present work could be extended to  @xmath32 and  @xmath42 depending on both  @xmath56 and  @xmath43 at the expense of an increased technicality , which will be omitted here .",
    "the present framework is sufficient to cover all interesting situations that can be desirable at the macroscopic scale .",
    "the first step in the study of the macroscopic behaviour of this system consists in considering a large number of particles . in this limit",
    ", we aim at describing the evolution of the density probability function  @xmath57 of finding a particle with direction  @xmath58 at position  @xmath59 .",
    "this has been studied in  @xcite in the case where  @xmath44 and  @xmath45 .",
    "it is nearly straightforward to perform the same study in our more general case .    for convenience",
    ", we will use the following notation for the first moment of a function  @xmath17 with respect to the variable  @xmath58 ( the measure on the sphere is the uniform measure such that  @xmath60 ) : @xmath61 for the following , we will assume that :     [ hyp - prop - chaos ]    1 .",
    "the function  @xmath36 is a lipschitz bounded function with finite second moment .",
    "2 .   the functions  @xmath62 and  @xmath63 are lipschitz and bounded .    in these conditions",
    "the mean - field limit of the particle model is the following kinetic equation , called kolmogorov ",

    "more precisely , the following statements hold :    [ prop - meanfield - limit ] if  @xmath12 is a probability measure on  @xmath68 with finite second moment in  @xmath69 , and if  @xmath70 are  @xmath24 independent variables with law  @xmath12 , then :    1 .",

    "3 .   the law  @xmath72 at time  @xmath73 of any of one of the processes  @xmath74 converges to  @xmath17 as  @xmath75 .",
    "the proof of this proposition follows exactly the study performed in  @xcite , using auxiliary coupling processes as in the classical sznitman s theory ( see  @xcite ) , and is omitted here .",
    "let us make some comment on the structure of the kinetic equation  .",

    "the last term of the left hand side corresponds to the alignment mechanism towards the target orientation  @xmath77 , with intensity  @xmath78 , while the term at the right hand side is a diffusion term in the velocity variable , with intensity  @xmath79 .",
    "these two terms correspond to   in the particle model .",
    "we will see in   and   that these two terms , under certain assumptions ( spatially homogeneous case , or expansion in terms of a scaling parameter  @xmath80 ) , behave as a local collision operator  @xmath81 , only acting on the velocity variable  @xmath58 .",
    "finally , the convolution with  @xmath36 in   expresses the fact that  @xmath82 is a spatial averaging of the local momentum  @xmath83 defined in  , it corresponds to the definition   in the particle model .",
    "the hydrodynamic limit involves an expansion of the solution around a local equilibrium ( see section  [ subsec - hydro - scaling ] ) .",
    "therefore , local equilibria of the collision operator  @xmath81 are of key importance .",
    "we will see that such equilibria are not unique .",
    "the existence of multiple equilibria requires an a priori selection of those equilibria which make sense for the hydrodynamic limit .",
    "obviously , unstable equilibria have to be ignored because no actual solution will be close to them . in order to make this selection , in the present section , we consider the spatially homogeneous problem .",
    "to the most possible exhaustive way , in section  [ sec - rates - convergence ] , we will determine the stable equilibria and characterize the convergence rate of the solution of the space - homogeneous problem to one of these equilibria . in section",
    "[ sec - phase - transition ] , we will illustrate these results on two examples . finally , in section  [ sec - macro - models ] , we will deal with the spatially non - homogeneous case and apply the conclusions of the spatially homogeneous study .",
    "the spatially homogeneous version of this model consists in looking for solutions of the kinetic equation   depending only on  @xmath58 and  @xmath73 .",
    "obviously , such solutions can not be probability measures on  @xmath84 any more , so we are looking for solutions which are positive measures on  @xmath6 .",
    "in that case ,  @xmath85 , and ( up to writing  @xmath86 and  @xmath87 ) the kinetic equation   reduces to @xmath88 where the operator  @xmath81 is defined by @xmath89 where  @xmath90 and where we have dropped the `` hats '' for the sake of clarity .",
    "let us remark that by hypothesis  [ hyp - prop - chaos ] , we do not have any problem of singularity of  @xmath81 as  @xmath91 : if  @xmath92 , we simply have  @xmath93 .",

    "let us remark that here we do not need the bounds on  @xmath111 and on  @xmath42 provided by hypothesis  [ hyp - prop - chaos ] , since the positivity ensures that  @xmath0 takes values in  @xmath112 $ ] , where  @xmath113 is the total mass of  @xmath12 ( a conserved quantity ) .",

    ". it would be easy to remove it at the price of an increased technicality .",
    "additionally , it means that when the alignment of the particles is increased , the relative intensity of the social force compared to the noise is increased as well .",
    "this can be biologically motivated by the existence of some social reinforcement mechanism .",
    "it bears analogies with diffusion limited aggregation  ( see  @xcite ) , in which the noise intensity is decreased with larger particle density .",
    "this can also be related with what is called `` extrinsic noise '' in  @xcite , where the noise corresponds to some uncertainty in the particle - particle communication mechanism . indeed in this case ,",
    "the intensity of the noise increases when  @xmath0 decreases .",

    "this gives a practical example of a second order phase transition with the minimal critical exponent such that the associated soh model is hyperbolic in the neighborhood of the threshold  @xmath154 ( indeed , in that case , thanks to proposition  , we must have  @xmath937 ) .",
    "in this work , we have provided a comprehensive and rigorous description of phase transitions for kinetic models describing self - propelled particles interacting through alignment .",
    "we have highlighted how their behavior results from the competition between alignment and noise .",
    "we have considered a general framework , where both the alignment frequency and noise intensity depend on a measure of the local alignment .",
    "we have shown that , in the spatially homogeneous case , the phase transition features ( number and nature of equilibria , stability , convergence rate , phase diagram , hysteresis ) are totally encoded in the function obtained by taking the quotient of the alignment and noise intensities as functions of the local alignment .",
    "the phase transitions dealt with in this paper belong to the class of spontaneous symmetry - breaking phase transitions that also appear in many physics systems such as ferromagnetism , liquid crystals , polymers , etc .",
    "we have also provided the derivation of the macroscopic models ( of hydrodynamic or diffusion types ) that can be obtained from the knowledge of the stable equilibria and classified their hyperbolicity . in particular , we have provided a strong link between the critical exponent in the second order phase transition and the hyperbolicity of the hydrodynamic model . in the future , we will investigate how the hydrodynamic and diffusion regimes can be spatially connected through domain walls and find the dynamic of these domain walls .",
    "in this appendix , we give more details on the computation of the hysteresis loop provided in section  [ subsec - first ] . in order to highlight the role of the density  @xmath56 as the key parameter for the phase transition",
    ", we introduce the probability measure  @xmath938 and we rewrite the homogeneous kinetic equation   in terms of  @xmath939 .",
    "we get @xmath940 when  @xmath56 is constant , this equation is equivalent to",
    ". we will now consider  @xmath56 as a parameter of the equation ( and not anymore a parameter for the mass of initial condition , since  @xmath939 is now a probability measure ) , but the long time behavior ( equilibria , stability , convergence ) is still given by this parameter  @xmath56 .",
    "finally , we let  @xmath56 vary slowly with time ( compared to the time scale of convergence to equilibrium , given by figure  [ fig - rates ] ) , as we expect it would be the case in the spatial inhomogeneous framework given by the kinetic equation  .",
    "let us now present how the numerical simulations of the system   in dimension  @xmath21 , depicted in figure  [ fig - numerics - kinetic-2d ] , have been obtained .",
    "we start with an initial condition which is a small perturbation of the uniform distribution , and we take a varying parameter of the form  @xmath941 , with  @xmath942 . we use a standard central finite different scheme ( with  @xmath943 discretization points ) , implicit in time ( with a time step of  @xmath944 ) .",
    "the only problem with this approach is that the solution converges strongly to the uniform distribution for  @xmath166 .",
    "so after passing  @xmath154 , the linear rate of increase for  @xmath945 is given by  @xmath946 , by virtue of  , and is very slow when  @xmath56 is close to  @xmath154 .",
    "so since  @xmath945 is initially very small when passing the threshold  @xmath638 , the convergence to the stable von mises  fisher distribution is very slow .",
    "two ideas can be used to overcome this problem : either injecting noise in the system , or more efficiently , adding a threshold  @xmath294 and strengthening  @xmath947 when  @xmath948 , replacing  @xmath939 at the end of such a step by @xmath949 we note that after this transformation , we still have  @xmath948 if it was the case before applying the transformation .",
    "figure  [ fig - numerics - kinetic-2d ] depicts the result of a numerical simulation with a threshold  @xmath950 .",
    "we clearly see this hysteresis cycle , which agrees very well with the theoretical diagram .",
    "the jumps at  @xmath722 and  @xmath638 are closer to the theoretical jumps when  @xmath951 is very large .",
    "now , since the kinetic equation   comes from a limit of a particle system , we are interested in observing this hysteresis phenomenon numerically at the level of the particle system , where noise is already present in the model , since it is a system of stochastic differential equations .    as for  , it is easy to derive the mean - field equation  , in the spirit of proposition  [ prop - meanfield - limit ] , from the following system : @xmath952 here , once again , the parameter  @xmath56 is a parameter of the equation , which can be variable in time .",
    "we perform numerical simulations of this system for a large number of particles , with  @xmath56 varying as in the numerical simulation of the kinetic model . as before , we start with a initial condition which consists of  @xmath953 particles uniformly distributed on  @xmath954 , and we take  @xmath941 , with  @xmath942 .",
    "we use a splitting method for the random and the deterministic parts of this equation ( with a time step of  @xmath944 ) .",
    "we then plot the order parameter  @xmath184 , given by  @xmath0 .",
    "the result is given in figure  [ fig - numerics - particle-2d ] .",
    "let us remark that , thanks to the central limit theorem , the mean  @xmath955 of  @xmath24 vectors uniformly distributed on the circle has a law equivalent to a multivariate normal distribution in  @xmath956 centered at  @xmath264 , and with covariance matrix  @xmath957 .",
    "therefore  @xmath0 is equivalent to a rayleigh distribution of parameter  @xmath958 , and so the mean of  @xmath0 is equivalent to  @xmath959 . in our case ,",
    "that gives a mean of  @xmath0 of approximately  @xmath960 , of the same order as in the previous section , since the threshold  @xmath294 ensures that , when  @xmath939 is close to the uniform distribution  @xmath961 with  @xmath950 ."
