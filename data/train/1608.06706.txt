    "a series of strong and relatively broad infrared ( ir ) emission features at 3.3 , 6.2 , 7.7 , 8.6 , and 11.3@xmath0 are ubiquitously seen in almost all astronomical objects with associated gas and dust , including protoplanetary nebulae , planetary nebulae , reflection nebulae , young stellar objects , hii regions , the galactic ir cirrus , and external galaxies ( see tielens 2008 ) .",
    "these features are a common characteristic of the interstellar medium ( ism ) of the milky way and nearby galaxies as well as distant galaxies out to redshifts of @xmath9 ( e.g. , see riechers et al .",
    "2014 ) . since their first detection four decades ago in two planetary nebulae ( ngc7027 and bd@xmath1030@xmath113639 , gillett et al .  1973 )",
    ", the carriers of these ir emission features have remained unidentified . because of this , they are collectively known as the `` unidentified infrared emission '' ( uie or uir ) bands .",
    "nevertheless , it is now generally accepted that these features are characteristic of the stretching and bending vibrations of some sorts of aromatic hydrocarbon materials and therefore , the uie features are sometimes also referred to as the `` aromatic infrared bands '' ( aib ) .",
    "a large number of candidate materials have been proposed as carriers of the uie bands .",
    "all of these materials contain aromatic structures of fused benzene rings .",
    "the major debate lies in the exact structure of the uie carriers : ( 1 ) are they free - flying , predominantly _",
    "aromatic _ _ gas - phase _ macro - molecules like polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon ( pah ) molecules ( lger & puget 1984 ; allamandola et al .",
    "1985 , 1989 ) , or ( 2 ) are they amorphous _ solids _ with a _ mixed aromatic / aliphatic _ composition like hydrogenated amorphous carbon ( hac ; jones et al .",
    "1990 ) , quenched carbonaceous composites ( qcc ; sakata et al .",
    "1990 ) , coal or kerogen ( papoular et al .",
    "as originally suggested by duley & williams ( 1981 ) , all of these _ solid _ materials share the basic molecular structure of pahs by containing arenes.h@xmath12 . if the h atoms are gone , then it is not really `` benzene '' anymore .",
    "it is an aromatic ring system which can be called `` arene '' .",
    "arene is a hydrocarbon with alternating double and single bonds between carbon atoms forming rings . ]",
    "they also contain aliphatic c ",
    "h bonds as well as other molecular structures often with other elements besides c and h. the `` maon '' model recently proposed by kwok & zhang ( 2011 , 2013 ) also falls in this category , where maon stands for `` _ mixed aromatic / aliphatic organic nanoparticle _ '' .",
    "are the uie carriers aromatic or aliphatic ?",
    "a straightforward way to address this question is to examine the _",
    "aliphatic fraction _ of the uie carriers ( i.e. , the fraction of c atoms in aliphatic chains ) .",
    "aliphatic hydrocarbons have a vibrational band at 3.4@xmath0 due to the c ",
    "h stretching mode ( pendleton & allamandola 2002 ) . in many interstellar and circumstellar environments",
    "the 3.3@xmath0 emission feature is indeed often accompanied by a weaker feature at 3.4@xmath0 ( see li & draine 2012 and references therein ) . as demonstrated by li & draine ( 2012 ) and yang et al .",
    "( 2013 ) , one can place an upper limit of @xmath12% on the aliphatic fraction of the emitters of the uie features by assigning the 3.4@xmath0 emission _ exclusively _ to aliphatic c  h ( also see rouill et al .",
    "2012 , steglich et al .",
    "this is indeed an _",
    "upper limit _ as the 3.4@xmath0 emission feature could also be due to _ anharmonicity _ of the aromatic c  h stretch ( barker et al .",
    "1987 ) and `` _ superhydrogenated _ '' pahs whose edges contain excess h atoms ( bernstein et al .",
    "1996 , sandford et al .",
    "2013 ) .",
    "in addition to the 3.4@xmath0 c  h stretching mode , aliphatic hydrocarbon materials also have two c  h deformation bands at 6.85@xmath0 and 7.25@xmath0 .",
    "these two bands have been observed in weak _ absorption _ in the galactic diffuse ism ( chiar et al .",
    "they are also seen in _ emission _ , with the 6.85@xmath0 feature detected both in the milky way and in the large and small magellanic clouds while the 7.25@xmath0 feature so far mostly seen in the magellanic clouds ( e.g. , see sloan et al .",
    "their strengths ( relative to the nearby 6.2 and 7.7@xmath0 c  c stretching bands ) also allow an estimate of the aliphatic fraction of the uie carrier . in this work ,",
    "we further explore the aliphatic versus aromatic content of the uie carriers by examining the ratio of the observed intensity of the 6.2@xmath0 aromatic c  c feature ( @xmath2 ) c  c stretching feature is often stronger than the 6.2@xmath0 c  c stretch for most of the interstellar uie sources .",
    "however , the ir vibrational spectra of methylated - pahs calculated from density function theory are too complicated in the 7.7@xmath0 wavelength range to allow us to reliably identify the c ",
    "c stretching modes from which the 7.7@xmath0 feature originates .",
    "in contrast , the c  c stretching modes in the 6.2@xmath0 wavelength range are much `` cleaner '' . ] to that of the 6.85@xmath0 aliphatic c  h deformation features ( @xmath3 ) . at this moment",
    "we will not apply the 7.25@xmath0 emission feature to constrain the aliphatic fraction of the uie carriers since this feature appears much weaker than the 6.85@xmath0 feature .",
    "emission feature has so far only been reported in several protoplanetary nebulae and one planetary nebula in the magellanic clouds ( see sloan et al .",
    "this feature is not seen in the milky way except in some protoplanetary disks around young stars ( e.g. , see sloan et al .",
    "2005 , acke et al .",
    "2010 ) . ] nevertheless , to help understand why the 6.85@xmath0 feature is more frequently detected than the 7.25@xmath0 feature , we will also compute the intrinsic strength of the 7.25@xmath0 feature and compare it with the 6.85@xmath0 feature . to derive the intrinsic oscillator strengths of the 6.2@xmath0 aromatic c",
    " c stretch ( @xmath4 ) and the 6.85@xmath0 aliphatic c  h deformation ( @xmath5 ) , we employ density functional theory to compute the ir vibrational spectra of seven methylated polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon ( pah ) molecules and their cations .",
    "the methyl group is taken to represent the aliphatic component of the uie carriers .",
    "pah cations with aliphatic sidegroups are of particular interest since ionized pahs are expected to be dominant or at least as abundant as neutrals in astronomical environments in which the 6.2 , 7.7 , and 8.6@xmath0 bands are observed . in  [ sec : method ] we briefly describe the computational methods and the parent molecules based on which we derive the band strengths",
    ". we also present in  [ sec : method ] the computed band - strength ratios @xmath7 and @xmath13 .",
    "we summarize in  [ sec : obs ] the intensities of the 6.2@xmath0 aromatic c  c stretch and the 6.85 and 7.25@xmath0 aliphatic c  h deformations observed in the milky way and magellanic clouds . in ",
    "[ sec : a685a62 ] we estimate the aliphatic fractions of the uie carriers from the observed intensity ratio ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "we discuss and summarize our major results in  [ sec : discussion ] and  [ sec : summary ] , respectively .",
    "we use the gaussian09 software ( frisch et al .  2009 ) to calculate the ir vibrational spectra for a range of methylated aromatic molecules and their cations .",
    "we employ the hybrid density functional theoretical method ( b3lyp ) at the 6 - 311+g@xmath14 level .",
    "6 - 31+g@xmath15 , 6 - 311+g@xmath15 , 6 - 311g@xmath14 , 6 - 31+g@xmath14 , 6 - 31++g@xmath14 , 6 - 311+g@xmath14 , 6 - 311++g@xmath14 , 6 - 311+g(3df,3pd ) , and 6 - 311++g(3df,3pd ) . it is found that the results computed with the basis sets 6 - 311+g@xmath14 , 6 - 311++g@xmath14 , 6 - 311+g(3df,3pd ) , and 6 - 311++g(3df,3pd ) essentially reach the convergence limit .",
    "the b3lyp/6 - 311+g@xmath14 method presents an excellent compromise between accuracy and computational demand .",
    "yang et al .  (",
    "2013 ) have also examined the accuracy of the b3lyp method by employing second - order m@xmath16ller - plesset perturbation theory ( mp2 ) which is thought to be more accurate in computing band intensities than b3lyp ( see cramer et al .",
    "it is found that the results computed from b3lyp/6 - 311++g(3df,3pd ) closely agree with that from mp2/6 - 311++g(3df,3pd ) .",
    "therefore , in this work we adopt the b3lyp/6 - 311+g@xmath14 method . ]",
    "we adopt the vibrational frequency scale factor of @xmath10.9688 for the b3lyp/6 - 311+g@xmath14 method ( borowski 2012 ) .",
    "we have considered both neutral and singly - ionized benzene ( c@xmath12h@xmath12 ) , naphthalene ( c@xmath17h@xmath18 ) , anthracene ( c@xmath19h@xmath17 ) , phenanthrene ( c@xmath19h@xmath17 ) , pyrene ( c@xmath20h@xmath17 ) , perylene ( c@xmath21h@xmath22 ) , and coronene ( c@xmath23h@xmath22 ) , as well as all of their methyl derivatives .",
    "we focus on methyl - substituted pahs as pahs with larger side chains are not as stable against photolytic dissociation as methyl - pahs and are therefore not expected to be present in the ism in a large abundance .",
    "the molecules studied are shown in figure  [ fig : monomethylpahs ] together with the standard _ international union of pure and applied chemistry _ ( iupac ) numbering scheme .",
    "] we use the first four letters of the molecules to refer to them and attach the position number of the location of the methyl group .",
    "for example , 1-methylnaphthalene is referred to as naph1 .",
    "the methyl conformations are indicated in figure  [ fig : monomethylpahs ] and there are several possibilities . for their cation counterparts ,",
    "we add a `` @xmath10 '' sign ( e.g. , naph1@xmath10 refers to singly - ionized 1-methylnaphthalene ) .    depending on the symmetry of the neutral molecule , there are one or two stereoisomers in which one of the methyl - ch bonds lies in the plane of the arene .",
    "we differentiate between these stereoisomers by addition of `` @xmath24 '' or `` @xmath25 '' to the name of the structure isomer , and the in - plane c  h bond points into the less ( more ) crowded hemisphere in the @xmath24-conformation ( @xmath25-conformation ) . in most cases , either the @xmath24-conformation or the @xmath25-conformation corresponds to the minimum",
    "while the other conformation corresponds to the transition state structure for methyl rotation.cc bond and serves to scramble the h atoms in the associated minimum structures ( i.e. , naph1a can be realized with any one of the three methyl - hs in the plane ) . ]",
    "note that the @xmath24-conformation can be the minimum ( i.e. , naph1a ) or the rotational transition state structure ( i.e. , naph2a ) .",
    "the neutral molecules tolu , anth9 and pyre2 are symmetric and the @xmath24- and @xmath25-conformations are identical . in these cases there exists an additional conformation type , the @xmath26-conformation , in which one of the methyl - ch bonds is almost perpendicular with respect to the arene plane . for tolu and pery2 ,",
    "the @xmath26-conformation is the minimum while the conformations with in - plane ch - bonds are the rotational transition state structures .",
    "in contrast , for anth9 the @xmath26-conformation serves as the transition state for interconversion between the conformations with in - plane ch - bonds .",
    "we have also calculated all the minima of the cations of all the isomers of the methyl derivatives of the pah molecules shown in figure  [ fig : monomethylpahs ] .",
    "the structures and mulliken charge distributions of these cations are shown in figure  [ fig : chargedistrib ] .",
    "the presence of a positive charge in the @xmath27-system causes polarization and results in complicated charge patterns which are characterized by positively - charged centers and centers with partial negative charges .",
    "the centers of positive charges are always tertiary carbons ( attached to three c atoms ) , while the centers of partial negative charges are secondary carbons ( attached to two c atoms ) and primary carbons ( attached to one c atom ) .",
    "the monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbon tolu1c+ is atypical in that it is the only cation with only one tertiary carbon and thus this carbon is the center of positive charges .",
    "all pahs contain tertiary carbons at the bonds shared between rings and these carbons have the capacity to accept partial positive charges .",
    "charge delocalization is highly effective in only a few of the cations ( anth1a+ , anth2b+ , pyre2c+ ) .",
    "most cations prefer a distribution of charges over two or more c atoms and concomitant bond polarizations , with pery3a+ being an extreme example .",
    "the variety of charge distribution patterns has several consequences on the vibrational properties .",
    "first , the methyl group may be overall neutral ( i.e. , pyre2c+ ) ; it may contain a partially negative methyl c ( i.e. , naph1a+ , antha1a+ , and especially pery2c+ ) ; the methyl group may be attached to a cationic center ( i.e. , tolu1c+ , phen1a+ ) or to an essentially uncharged carbon ( i.e. , anth2b+ , pyre2c+ ) . as a result , the force constants of the aliphatic c ",
    "h modes will vary much more in the cations than in the neutral pahs .",
    "second , the charge distribution creates more diversity in the bond strengths of the aromatic c  h and of the c  c bonds and the group vibrations will cover broader spectral ranges .",
    "third , the presence of a charge and the resulted charge distribution pattern affect the dipole polarizabilities and cause significant differences in the intensities of the cations as compared to the neutrals .    the vibrational frequencies and intensities for the 6.2@xmath0 aromatic c ",
    "c stretching mode and the 6.85 and 7.85@xmath0 aliphatic c  h deformation modes of all the isomers of the seven methylated pah species and their cations are computed .",
    "the standard scaling is applied to the frequencies by employing a scale factor of @xmath10.9688 .",
    "the scaling will not be applied to the intensities since we are mostly interested in the intensity ratios @xmath7 and @xmath13 and the scaling will be cancelled out .",
    "we tabulate the computed band strengths in table  [ tab : a685a62n ] and table  [ tab : a685a62i ] , respectively for neutral methyl pahs and their cations .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig : a685a62]a , both @xmath4 and @xmath5 vary appreciably for different neutral molecules and their isomers . for the 6.2@xmath0 aromatic c  c stretch , it has an average value ( per aromatic c - c bond ) of @xmath28 , with a standard deviation of @xmath29 .",
    "the 6.85@xmath0 aliphatic c  h deformation band is relatively less dependent on the nature of the molecule and the specific isomer .",
    "the average band strength ( per aliphatic c  h bond ) is @xmath30 , and the standard deviation is @xmath31 . the @xmath7 ratio , as shown in figure  [ fig : a685a62]b , varies considerably and depends significantly on the specific molecule and its isomers .",
    "nevertheless , the @xmath7 ratio for neutral molecules clearly shows a low - end value of @xmath15 ( i.e. , @xmath32 ) . for these molecules ,",
    "the intrinsic strength of the 7.25@xmath0 aliphatic c  h deformation band , @xmath8 , is substantially weaker than the 6.85@xmath0 band .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig : a725a62]a , the strength ( per aliphatic c  h bond ) of the 7.25@xmath0 band is less than @xmath1@xmath33 for @xmath172% of the molecules and less than @xmath1@xmath34 for @xmath161% of the molecules .",
    "similar to the 6.85@xmath0 band , although the @xmath13 ratio varies considerably for different molecules and their isomers , the @xmath13 ratio also clearly shows a low - end value of @xmath11.0 ( i.e. , @xmath35 ; see figure  [ fig : a725a62]b ) .    for the cations of the methyl pahs considered in this work , the computed band strengths ( @xmath5 , @xmath8 ) and their ratios ( @xmath7 , @xmath13 )",
    "are tabulated in table  [ tab : a685a62i ] and shown in figure  [ fig : aratiocation ] .",
    "compared to their neutral counterparts , the band - strength ratios of cations show even more substantial differences among different molecules .",
    "however , similar to neutral molecules , the band - strength ratios of cations also show low - end values , with @xmath36 and @xmath37 respectively for the 6.85 and 7.25@xmath0 bands .",
    "unlike the 3.4@xmath0 aliphatic c  h stretch , the detection of the 6.85 and 7.25@xmath0 aliphatic c  h deformation bands in the ism of the milky way is much rarer .",
    "we are not aware of any galactic sources in which the 7.25@xmath0 feature is seen in emission except several protoplanetary disks . on the other hand , to the best of our knowledge , only seven _",
    "galactic _ objects exhibit a noticeable emission feature at 6.85@xmath0 : ngc  7023 , a reflection nebula ( rn ) ; ngc  7027 , a planetary nebula ( pn ) , the orion bar , a photodissociated region ( pdr ) ; and four protoplanetary nebulae ( ppne ; iras  01005 + 7910 , iras  04296 + 3429 , iras  22223 + 4327 , and iras  22272 + 5435 ) . except for the four galactic ppne ,",
    "the observed 6.85@xmath0 feature intensity is much weaker than that of the 6.2@xmath0 feature . as shown in table  [",
    "tab : i685i62 ] , for galactic sources other than ppne , @xmath38 .",
    "for the four galactic ppne , the 6.85@xmath0 feature is much stronger , with @xmath39 for three of these four ppne .",
    "however , these galactic ppne all exhibit `` unusual '' uie properties compared to the typical interstellar uie bands ( e.g. , these ppne show a broad 8.2@xmath0 feature rather than separately resolved 7.7/8.6@xmath0 uie features ; moreover , the 11.3 and 12.7@xmath0 c  h out - of - plane bending features seen in sources with `` normal''-looking uie features are blended in a flat - top broad band at @xmath111.8@xmath0 ; see tokunaga 1997 , peeters et al .  2002 ) .",
    "the origin of these `` unusual '' uie features is unclear and their carriers are very likely different from that of the normal - looking interstellar uie features . while the uie carriers of ppne are freshly synthesized in the outflows of asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) and/or post - agb stars , their interstellar counterparts must have experienced various physical and chemical processes in the ism . in this work",
    "we will restrict ourselves to the interstellar sources which show typical - looking uie features for which @xmath38 .",
    "it is interesting to note that the 6.85 and 7.25@xmath0 emission features appear to be more frequently seen in the magellanic clouds than in the galaxy .",

    "spitzer_/irs spectra of a large number of carbon - rich sources in the large and small magellanic clouds .",

    "these sources are predominantly ppne , with only three out of eighteen are not ppne : smpsmc011 ( pn ) , smpsmc020 ( pn ) , and iras05360 - 7121 ( agb ) . while the magellanic ppne have a wide range of intensity ratios from @xmath41 to @xmath42 and from @xmath43 to @xmath44 , two of the non - ppn sources ( smpsmc011 , iras  05360 - 7121 ) have @xmath45 and one non - ppn source ( smpsmc020 )",

    "the molecule will then rapidly cool down and radiate away most of the absorbed energy at temperature @xmath121 . before it absorbs another photon , the molecule will spend most of the time at very low temperatures ( draine & li 2001 ) . therefore , a single temperature of @xmath121 provides a reasonably good measure of the ir emission .",
    "the aliphatic fractions derived in  [ sec : a685a62 ] from the model intensity ratio @xmath110 are calculated for methyl pahs excited by the mmp83 isrf .",
    "if the actual radiation intensity is @xmath124-times that of the mmp83 isrf , the results will remain unchanged because the ir emission spectra of stochastically heated nano - sized grains or very large molecules , after scaled by @xmath124 , are essentially independent of @xmath124 ( e.g. , see figure  13 of li & draine 2001 , figure  1f of draine & li 2007 ) . to examine whether and how the `` hardness '' of the exciting starlight affects the aliphatic fraction estimate , we consider methyl pahs of @xmath105 aliphatic c atoms and @xmath106 aromatic c atoms excited by stars with an effective temperature of @xmath125 like our sun and by stars of @xmath126 like the b1.5v star hd37903 which illuminates the reflection nebula ngc2023 .",
    "the starlight intensity in the 912@xmath1271@xmath0 wavelength range is fixed at @xmath128 , with @xmath124 defined as @xmath129 where @xmath130 is the intensity of starlight approximated by the kurucz model atmospheric spectrum , and @xmath131 is the mmp83 isrf starlight intensity .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig : i685i62vsali2aro ] , for a given @xmath99 , the @xmath125 model results in a larger @xmath110 than that of the mmp83 isrf model , while the @xmath126 model results in a smaller @xmath110 than that of the mmp83 isrf model .",
    "this is because a _",
    "softer _ radiation field rises the methyl pah molecule to a _",
    "lower _ temperature and therefore it radiates relatively more at 6.82@xmath0 than at 6.2@xmath0 .",
    "nevertheless , the effects on the derived @xmath99 are small : the mmp83 isrf model , the @xmath125 model , and the @xmath126 model respectively derive @xmath132 for neutrals , and @xmath133 for cations ( see figure  [ fig : i685i62vsali2aro ] ) .    to examine the effects of ionization of methyl pahs on the intrinsic strengths of the 6.2 , 6.85 and 7.25@xmath0 bands , we show in figure  [ fig : ion_eff ] the intrinsic strengths of these bands of ionized methyl pahs relative to that of their neutral counterparts .",
    "as is long known ( allamandola et al .  1999 , hudgins & allamandola 2005 ) , the 6.2@xmath0 c",
    " c stretch is substantially enhanced upon ionization ( see figure  [ fig : ion_eff]a ) .",
    "in contrast , the 6.85@xmath0 aliphatic c  h deformation is only moderately enhanced ( see figure  [ fig : ion_eff]b ) , while the 7.25@xmath0 alipahtic c  h deformation is more like the 6.2@xmath0 c  c stretch and shows considerable enhancement upon ionization ( see figure  [ fig : ion_eff]c ) .    as mentioned in  [ sec : obs ] and  [ sec : a685a62 ] , the detection of the 7.25@xmath0 emission feature in the milky way or the magellanic clouds is rarer than the 6.85@xmath0 feature .",
    "this is because , as shown in figure  [ fig : a725a685 ] , the intrinsic strength of the 7.25@xmath0 feature is weaker than that of the 6.85@xmath0 feature by a factor of @xmath18 for neutral methyl pahs and by a factor of @xmath13 for their cations .",
    "in addition , the weak 7.25@xmath0 feature could be hidden by the pronounced 7.7@xmath0 c  c stretch .",
    "the aliphatic fraction of the uie carriers derived from the 6.85@xmath0 aliphatic c  h deformation is consistent with that derived from the 3.4@xmath0 aliphatic c  h stretch in the sense that the uie carrier is predominantly aromatic and the aliphatic component is only a minor part of the uie emitters .",
    "based on the observed intensity ratios of the 3.4@xmath0 feature to the 3.3@xmath0 feature , li & draine ( 2012 ) placed an upper limit of @xmath19% on the aliphatic fraction of the uie carriers in ngc7027 and the orion bar .",
    "yang et al .  (",
    "2013 ) further constrained the aliphatic fraction to be at most @xmath12% by examining a large sample of 35 uie sources which exhibit both the 3.3@xmath0 and 3.4@xmath0 c  h features . unlike li & draine ( 2012 ) who adopted the 3.3@xmath0 feature strength ( @xmath134 ) of small neutral pahs ( draine & li 2007 ) and the 3.4@xmath0 feature strength ( @xmath135 ) obtained by averaging over three pure aliphatic molecules ( i.e. , ethane , hexane , and methyl - cyclo - hexane ) and one aromatic molecule with an aliphatic sidegroup ( i.e. , ethyl - benzene ; dhendecourt & allamandola 1986 ) , yang et al .",
    "( 2013 ) employed density functional theory to compute @xmath136 for a range of methyl - substituted pahs .",
    "li & draine ( 2012 ) have also examined the 6.85 and 7.7@xmath0 features of ngc7027 and the orion bar by comparing the observed intensity ratios of these two bands ( @xmath137 ) with their intrinsic band strengths ( @xmath138 , @xmath139 ) . adopting the 7.7@xmath0 feature strength of charged aromatic molecules ( draine & li 2007 ) for @xmath139 and the 6.85@xmath0 feature strength obtained by averaging over that measured for methylcylcohexane ( dhendecourt & allamandola 1986 ) and for hac ( dartois & muoz - caro 2007 ) for @xmath138 , they derived the aliphatic fraction of the uie emitters to be @xmath7715% . with",
    "the band - strength ratio @xmath7 obtained over many methylated aromatic species ( see  [ sec : method ] ) , we derive an aliphatic fraction of @xmath7710% from the observed intensity ratio @xmath6 ( see  [ sec : a685a62 ] ) .    finally , we note that the aliphatic c atoms considered here are all in the form of methyl side groups .",
    "the aliphatic fraction derived in  [ sec : a685a62 ] is the ratio between the number of c atoms in the aromatic skeleton of pahs and the number of c atoms in methyl side groups .",
    "this is not necessarily _ all _ of the aliphatic c atoms in astronomical pahs : there may be some in linear bridges , and there may also be some that are in the regular pah skeleton but at a superhydrogenated site .",
    "to sp@xmath140 orbitals , thereby by definition becoming aliphatic . ]",
    "these aliphatic c atoms are not yet included in this study .",
    "but yang et al . (",
    "2016 ) have shown that the aliphatic fraction of the uie carriers derived from the @xmath141 ratios of pahs with a wide range of sidegroups ( e.g. , ethyl , propyl , butyl , dimethyl ) was close to that based on the @xmath141 ratios of mono - methyl pahs . also , the sample of regular and methylated pahs considered here ( see figure  [ fig : monomethylpahs ] ) may not be representative of what are actually present in astronomical environments ( e.g. , the actual astro - pah molecules may have @xmath142 c atoms [ tielens 2008 ] while the largest molecule considered here is coronene of @xmath143 ) .",
    "future experimental and/or quantum - chemical computational studies of larger species would be very helpful to obtain more reliable estimates of the @xmath7 ratio , and therefore , of the aliphatic fraction of the uie carriers .",
    "we have examined the nature of the uie emitters by comparing the observed intensity ratios of the 6.2@xmath0 aromatic c  c stretch and the 6.85@xmath0 aliphatic c  h deformation with the intrinsic band strengths of these two features computed from density functional theory for seven pah molecules ( and their cations ) with a methyl side chain .",
    "we derive the fraction of c atoms in methyl(ene ) aliphatic form to be at most @xmath110% , confirming the earlier finding that the uie emitters are largely aromatic .",
