    "we consider systems of @xmath0 identical qubits located at positions @xmath8 , each with ground state @xmath9 , excited state @xmath10 and transition frequency @xmath11 .",
    "the free hamiltonian is given by @xmath12 system in which atoms 2 and 5 are excited is written by quantum opticians as @xmath13 , by quantum information theorists as @xmath14 , and by us here as @xmath15 .",
    "the state with all qubits in the state @xmath16 ( @xmath17 ) is denoted by @xmath18 ( @xmath19 ) .",
    "the generic ( excitation-)exchange interaction hamiltonian of the qubits is given by [ hint ] h_int=^n_i , j=1 _ ijs_i^+s_j^- , where @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the raising and lowering operators of qubit @xmath22 .",
    "the sole assumption we make regarding the interaction potential @xmath23 is that it is a function only of the separation between qubits @xmath22 and @xmath24 , @xmath25 .",
    "we focus in this paper on qubits arranged at the vertices of regular polygons , and number them sequentially around the polygon ( see fig .",
    "1 ) . for nearest - neighbour qubits , we define @xmath26 ; similarly , @xmath27 ; for @xmath0 atoms there are @xmath28 characteristic interactions , which we label sequentially alphabetically .",
    "in analysing the system of interacting qubits we are faced with two possibilities ; in this paper we follow option ( ii ) :    \\(i ) we can take the @xmath23 to be real , for example equal to the well known expression for the dipole - dipole interaction energy . diagonalizing the interaction hamiltonian yields eigenvalues which are the energy level shifts .",
    "the dynamics of the system can then be analyzed using a master equation , which would include terms containing the dipole - dipole damping . by solving the master equation",
    "we can calculate various quantities of interest , in particular the total decay rate from a given eigenstate to all the states below it ; this is useful for identifying long lived states desirable for quantum computing .",
    "\\(ii ) alternatively , we can include the free - atom radiation damping @xmath29 , and as well take the @xmath23 to be complex .",
    "the real part of @xmath23 is then the interaction energy , the imaginary part the inter - qubit damping .",
    "although this results in a non - hermitian hamiltonian , it has the advantage that the imaginary part of each resulting eigenvalue automatically contains the total decay rate for that eigenstate ( the real part is still the energy shift ) .",
    "this is proven elsewhere @xcite .",
    "the full hamiltonian to be diagonalized is represented by a @xmath30 matrix .",
    "fortunately , it is block - diagonal in structure , breaking up into a series of submatrices , in each of which the coupled subsets of states all have the same number @xmath31 of excited qubits .",
    "the submatrices are of dimension @xmath32 , and the submatrix for @xmath31 excited qubits is the same as that for @xmath33 excited , a general property of exchange interactions ; this halves the amount of work we must do ( and we consequently tabulate results only for @xmath34 ) .",
    "the @xmath35 and @xmath36 eigenstates are just @xmath37 and @xmath38 respectively .",
    "the single excitation ( or @xmath3 ) eigenstates of a system of @xmath0 qubits arranged at the vertices of a regular polygon were calculated years ago @xcite , guided by the symmetry of the system under rotation about an axis perpendicular to the polygon plane ; the @xmath3 eigenvalues and eigenstates for @xmath40 are there tabulated . here",
    "we rewrite these calculations in a notation which allows us to extend them to states containing higher numbers of excited qubits , using the case of @xmath41 as an example .    in the subspace spanned by the basis vectors",
    "@xmath42 we introduce the matrix @xmath43 , a generator of the 5-dimensional representation of @xmath44 ( the cyclic group of order 5 ) : @xmath45 the eigenvalue equation of @xmath43 is given by @xmath46 where @xmath47 , @xmath48 , and @xmath49 .",
    "we define the polynomial @xmath50 , in terms of which @xmath51 .",
    "since @xmath52 is a sum of powers of @xmath43 , the eigenvectors @xmath53 of @xmath43 will be eigenvectors of @xmath52 as well , and we write the eigenvalue equation @xmath54 where the eigenvalues @xmath55 .",
    "there is 1 non - degenerate eigenvalue corresponding to @xmath56 , @xmath57 , and ( 5 - 1)/2 degenerate pairs of eigenvalues , corresponding to roots which are complex conjugates of each other : @xmath58 .",
    "the eigenvector corresponding to @xmath59 is simply @xmath60 . for the eigenvectors corresponding to the degenerate pairs of eigenvalues , we choose the real linear combinations of @xmath53 and @xmath61 , @xmath62 together with @xmath63 , these form an orthogonal basis set for the @xmath3 subspace .",
    "they are listed in table ii .",
    "we continue with the example of @xmath41 to demonstrate how to calculate the @xmath1 ( biexciton ) eigenstates for general odd values of @xmath0 .",
    "the subspace corresponding to @xmath41 , @xmath1 has 10 basis states , which we take in the order @xmath64 , @xmath65 , @xmath66 and @xmath67 , then the interaction can be represented by the @xmath68 matrix , @xmath69 thus , @xmath70 is partitioned into a @xmath71 array of square submatrices , each of dimension @xmath72 .",
    "the ability to write the matrix in this form is directly due to the ordering of the basis vectors , which allows the rotational symmetry of the pentagon to be reflected in each of the submatrices .",
    "it is easy to show that for any odd value of @xmath0 , @xmath70 can be partitioned in this way into an array of @xmath73 square submatrices , each of dimension @xmath74 .",
    "this results in a dramatic simplification of the problem , for instance here we need diagonalize only a 2-dimensional matrix instead of the original 10-dimensional one .    as with the @xmath3 case discussed above",
    ", each matrix @xmath75 is a linear combination of @xmath43 and its powers , and therefore has the eigenvalue equation @xmath76 where @xmath77 and @xmath53 are the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of @xmath43 . in order to obtain the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of @xmath70",
    ", we first solve the eigenvalue equation @xmath78 where @xmath79 is an eigenvector and @xmath80 an eigenvalue of the two - dimensional matrix @xmath81 .",
    "the solutions are easily found to be @xmath82,\\ ] ] where @xmath83 and @xmath84 the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of @xmath70 can then be shown by direct substitution to be @xmath85 and @xmath86 where @xmath49 . as with @xmath3 ,",
    "for degenerate eigenvalues we form the real linear combinations of the eigenvectors ; the complete orthogonal basis set is listed in table ii .",
    "in general , the eigenvalue equation for the @xmath1 excitations of any odd-@xmath0 array of qubits is solved in the same way :    \\(i ) the interaction matrix @xmath70 is partitioned into an array of square submatrices , each of dimension @xmath87 .",
    "\\(ii ) the eigenvalue equation of matrix @xmath75 is solved , where @xmath43 is the @xmath88 matrix analogous to eq.([p ] ) .",
    "\\(iii ) the eigenvalue equation is solved for the corresponding @xmath73 matrix @xmath81 , yielding eigenvalues @xmath89 and eigenvectors @xmath90 .",
    "\\(iv ) the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of @xmath70 are then given by @xmath91 and @xmath92 , where @xmath93 , @xmath94 , @xmath95 , and the vectors @xmath96 are the eigenvectors of the matrix @xmath43 corresponding to the @xmath0-sided polygon .      the calculations for the @xmath1 energies and eigenstates for even values of @xmath0 can not be described ( or performed ) so succinctly .",
    "this is due to the fact that @xmath97 is an _",
    "odd _ half - integer . as a result , the matrix for @xmath70 consists of 2 parts : an inner `` core '' of @xmath98 square submatrices , each of dimension @xmath74 , plus an outer section of @xmath99 extra columns to the right and rows at the bottom of the core . for example , the @xmath1 interaction matrix for @xmath100 is given by @xmath101 with an inner core matrix @xmath102 , where @xmath43 is now the 4-dimensional analogue of eq.([p ] ) .",
    "the calculations are performed in the following manner ; we illustrate the general procedure with the example of @xmath100 :    \\(i ) the energy eigenvalues and vectors of the `` core '' matrix are obtained , in exactly the same way as described in the previous section for odd values of @xmath0 .    for the case of @xmath100 ,",
    "the eigenvectors of @xmath103 are the same as those of @xmath104 , which in turn are the same as those of @xmath43 .",
    "they appear in table [ table1 ] .",
    "\\(ii ) these eigenvectors are then divided into 2 groups , according to their symmetry or antisymmetry .",
    "the vectors @xmath105 and @xmath106 are always eigenvectors , the former symmetric , the latter antisymmetric ; the remainder are classified according to their symmetry under rotations of @xmath107 about the symmetry axis .",
    "in the case of @xmath100 , three of these eigenvectors ( those corresponding to @xmath108 as listed in table [ table1 ] ) are antisymmetric , while that corresponding to @xmath109 is symmetric .",
    "\\(iii ) the antisymmetric eigenvectors are appended with @xmath99 @xmath110 s ; the resulting vectors are eigenvectors of @xmath70 , and the corresponding energies are found by direct substitution .    in the case of @xmath100 , by appending two @xmath110 s to the ends of the antisymmetric vectors , we obtain the following three eigenvectors of @xmath70 : @xmath111 the corresponding eigenvalues are found by substitution . by symmetry , we see that a fourth ( antisymmetric ) eigenvector of @xmath70 is @xmath112 .",
    "\\(iv ) the symmetric eigenvectors are extended into the rest of the @xmath1 subspace in a symmetric fashion .    for the example of @xmath100 ,",
    "the remaining 2 eigenvectors are found from the symmetric eigenvector @xmath113 of @xmath52 .",
    "we substitute into the eigenvalue equation for @xmath70 the trial vector @xmath114 , obtaining 2 ( independent ) equations for @xmath115 and the eigenvalues @xmath116 : @xmath117 and @xmath118 these have the solutions @xmath119 @xmath120 , where @xmath121 .",
    "this completes our set of 6 eigenvectors of @xmath70 .",
    "they are listed together with their corresponding eigenvalues in table [ table1 ] .",
    "we point out that the @xmath100 , @xmath1 eigenstates are the first which depend on the actual strength of the interaction , and not merely on its symmetry . in fig .",
    "2 , we illustrate the distance dependence of their decay rates . in the long - wavelength limit",
    ", three of the eigenstates have their decay rates unchanged from the noninteracting value of @xmath122 , and one state is superradiant , with an asymptotic value of @xmath123 ( see table v ) .",
    "the remaining two states are subradiant : one shows weak optical activity , with a limiting decay rate of @xmath124 , and one is _",
    "completely _ subradiant , with decay rate @xmath125 ; thus , this state is of possible interest for the encoding of quantum information .",
    "( we have cut off the figure at @xmath126 in order to retain the visibility of some of the oscillations at low values of the argument , corresponding to shorter wavelengths . )      to complete the sets of eigenstates for the @xmath5 and @xmath7 polygons , we require those corresponding to the @xmath4 excitations . these are obtained with methods very similar to those used for the @xmath1 states . for @xmath7 , the @xmath127 matrix is first partitioned into a @xmath128 array of square submatrices , each of dimension @xmath129 .",
    "the solution then requires the ( preliminary ) diagonalization of a @xmath72 matrix @xmath103 , but is otherwise a direct extension of the method used for @xmath1 .",
    "for @xmath5 we choose the basis vectors in the order : @xmath130 @xmath131 .",
    "doing so we find that the matrix @xmath127 consists of a core array of @xmath132 submatrices , each of dimension @xmath133 , together with an outer section of 2 columns to the right and 2 rows at the bottom of the core .",
    "the solution consists of 2 stages : in the first stage , the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the core matrix are found , and in the second the symmetric and antisymmetric eigenvectors of the core are extended to become those of the full @xmath134 matrix , in a manner entirely analogous to that employed for @xmath5 , @xmath1 .",
    "the complete set of eigenvalues and eigenvectors for n=6 is listed in table iii .",
    "those for n=7 are available upon request .",
    "in this section , we focus on systems of identical two - level atoms ( or molecular monomers ) undergoing cooperative radiative transitions ; the interatomic potential which applies in this case is the retarded multipole - multipole interaction @xcite . the strongest and most common of these are 1-photon transitions due to the electric dipole moment operator ; however , the same analysis can also be made for magnetic dipole or ( with different @xmath23 ) higher electric multipole transitions @xcite as well , and even for 2-photon transitions @xcite .",
    "we point out that in many systems an interaction exists between nearest neighbours ( e.g. due to atomic overlap ) _ in addition _ to the electromagnetic exchange interaction which occurs between all pairs .",
    "these forces can be included trivially in our analysis , simply by incorporating them into the nearest - neighbour interaction @xmath26 .    for the simple case of linear transition dipoles , of transition strength @xmath116 , oriented ( parallel to each other and ) perpendicular to the plane of the ring",

    "for example , there exist molecular aggregates in biology known as `` light - harvesting complexes '' , in which large identical building blocks or monomers are arranged symmetrically in rings with an n - fold symmetry axis , whose electronic excitations have been found to extend coherently over the entire ring @xcite .",
    "the direction of the transition moment of each individual monomer forms the ( same small ) angle @xmath143 with the tangent to the ring at its position . in this case , the dipole - dipole interaction is ( slightly ) more complicated in form , and is given by @xmath144,\\ ] ] but all our calculations remain valid .",
    "the dynamics of the system are governed by the lehmberg - agarwal master equation @xcite , which may be solved by projection onto any complete set of basis vectors",
    ". however , the `` natural '' set for this projection are the eigenstates of the hamiltonian @xmath145 . as demonstrated previously for @xmath146 and @xmath147 @xcite and elsewhere for general @xmath0 @xcite , these states have the following properties :    \\1 .",
    "the real part of the ( complex ) eigenvalue gives the shift of energy of the exciton due to local field effects .",
    "the imaginary part of the eigenvalue gives the total decay rate or inverse lifetime of the state ; this total decay rate is the sum of the individual decay rates to all states in the energy manifold below , as calculated using the master equation and in agreement with the total energy radiated by the system in a transition between the two states @xcite .",
    "the eigenstates form the basis set within which the population dynamics and spectroscopic properties of the system are most conveniently studied .",
    "a calculation of the @xmath3 and @xmath1 eigenstates of regular polygon systems of odd @xmath0 for electric dipole interactions in the long - wavelength limit has in fact been carried out @xcite , but in that reference the authors included only nearest - neighbour coupling for the real part of the interaction . for the @xmath3 subspace ,",
    "the resulting eigenstates are the same as ours ( which however include interactions between _ all _ neighbours and are valid for arbitrary wavelength ) , but the energies are very different : this difference is illustrated in table [ table4 ] , where we list the @xmath3 energies in the long - wavelength limit for polygons having @xmath41 and @xmath5 , for nearest - neighbour interactions only , for linear dipoles with all neighbours included , and for linear quadrupoles with all neighbours included .",
    "( all energies are expressed in units of the static interaction energy @xmath148 between a pair of nearest neighbours . ) for the @xmath1 subspace , the eigenstates themselves are very different from those obtained when only nearest - neighbour interactions are included , and a numerical comparison of the energies is not meaningful . because the retarded interactions are intrinsically long - ranged , a correct calculation of the eigenstates of the physical system _ must _ include interactions between all atom pairs : only in these states will the `` local field '' shifts be the same , and only in these states will the damping be the same for all atoms , so that no dephasing occurs during the evolution in time @xcite . as well , in some systems the energy of interaction between second ( or higher ) nearest neighbours can actually _ exceed _ that between adjacent pairs ( depending on the relative phases of the moments in the given eigenstate , and/or on the relative orientations of the transition moments and @xmath149 ) .",
    "the detailed emissive properties of these systems will be presented elsewhere @xcite ; however , some simple properties are immediately evident in the eigenvalues and eigenvectors .",
    "for example , in the long wavelength limit only one @xmath3 state is optically active in absorption and emission , and it is superradiant , having an eigenvalue whose imaginary part @xmath150 ; the @xmath151 other single - excitation states are subradiant , with the imaginary parts of their eigenvalues @xmath152 . in general , the @xmath1 states decay into @xmath3 states ( although these in turn may be subradiant ) ; however , for even-@xmath0 polygons , there is ( at least ) one @xmath1 state which is itself completely subradiant .    as a simple illustration of the emissive pattern , in fig .",
    "2 we display a complete energy level diagram for @xmath153 @xcite . all atomic separations are equal , so that the system is described by a single interaction potential @xmath154 . on each state",
    "is indicated its total decay rate , while individual decay rates between states are indicated on the dashed lines connecting them .",
    "for example , the @xmath1 eigenstate @xmath155 has energy @xmath156 and a total decay rate of @xmath157 ; it decays at a rate of @xmath158 to the ( symmetric ) @xmath155 state , and at a rate of @xmath159 to each of the 2 antisymmetric states in the @xmath3 manifold below it .",
    "similarly , each of the other two @xmath1 eigenstates has energy @xmath160 and a total decay rate of @xmath161 .",
    "the small sample / long wavelength limit corresponds to @xmath162 . in this limit , all the @xmath1 eigenstates decay , but the two antisymmetric @xmath3 states are ( completely ) subradiant .",
    "if a system in its ground state is placed in a weak external field of wave vector @xmath163 and polarization @xmath164 , only the @xmath3 states are excited , with a relative probability proportional to @xmath165 .",
    "if the field is sufficiently intense and the losses sufficiently low , population can remain in the @xmath96 states for long enough to allow excitation of the @xmath1 states ; and so on .    in recent years",
    ", there has been interest in the excitation of the exciton and biexciton states of the light - harvesting complexes , in connection with the calculation of their third - order nonlinear optical susceptibilities @xcite .",
    "the complexes discovered so far have diameters of the order of 10 nm , and their absorption frequencies correspond typically to wavelengths @xmath166 nm , so that the long - wavelength limit applies . in this limit ,",
    "the dependence on @xmath163 in the absorption probability is negligible , and it is easy to verify that only those states @xmath96 which are totally symmetric in the atomic positions are optically active , namely the states @xmath167 .",
    "this gives rise to lorentzian ( exciton ) absorption lines , centred at the shifted frequencies @xmath168 , with ( natural ) widths @xmath169 .",
    "we denote the energy of state @xmath170 by @xmath171 , and its decay constant by @xmath172 .",
    "the excitation of state @xmath170 from a ring in the state @xmath173 then occurs at frequency @xmath174 .",
    "it can be shown @xcite that the width of the absorption line is @xmath175 , and that in the long - wavelength limit the relative intensities of the biexciton absorption lines are simply given by @xmath172 .    in table",
    "v we list the @xmath3 shifts @xmath176 , the ( unnormalized ) @xmath1 eigenvectors @xmath177 , and the @xmath1 shifts @xmath178 and decay constants @xmath172 for @xmath2 , in the long - wavelength limit .",
    "the vectors @xmath177 correspond to basis states arranged in the order latexmath:[$\\{|12\\rangle,|23\\rangle,\\cdots,|n1\\rangle ;    the corresponding biexciton excitation frequency shifts , ( natural ) half widths , and relative intensities .",
    "all frequencies are expressed in units of @xmath148 , and widths in units of @xmath137 .",
    "we have calculated the eigenstates corresponding to coherent single and multiple excitations of an array of @xmath0 identical tla s or qubits arranged on the vertices of a regular polygon .",
    "their coupling occurs via an exchange interaction which depends only on the separation between the qubits .",
    "we include the interactions between _ all _ pairs , and our results are valid for arbitrary distances relative to the radiation wavelength .",
    "to illustrate the usefulness of these eigenstates , we plot the distance dependence of the decay rates of the @xmath1 eigenstates of a system of 4 qubits arranged on the vertices of a square , and tabulate the biexciton eigenstates and eigenvalues , and absorption frequencies , line widths , and relative intensities for polygons of @xmath2 identical tla s , in the long - wavelength limit .",

    "<S> , we calculate the eigenstates of @xmath0 identical ( coherently excited ) two - level quantum systems arranged on the vertices of a regular polygon . </S>",
    "<S> such systems are known as _ </S>",
    "<S> qubits _ to the quantum information community and as _ two - level atoms ( tlas ) _ to the quantum optics / spectroscopy community . </S>",
    "<S> the coherent excitation of identical tlas has long been of interest to spectroscopists , in connection with the theory of molecular excitons @xcite for example , or the phenomenon of superradiance @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> more recently , the interest has been in connection with the optical properties of molecular clusters or aggregates @xcite , many of which properties are believed to be related to the coherent interaction of the aggregates with the radiation field . at the same time , multiparticle entangled states of qubits have become an active area of study in the field of quantum information theory . </S>",

    "<S> we emphasize the complete generality of the majority of the results obtained herein : our results are applicable to all systems in which excitation is exchanged between the pairs of interacting qubits . </S>",
    "<S> such exchange interactions occur widely : for example , our theory is applicable to systems in which the coupling is via a spin - exchange interaction , or via a retarded dipole - dipole ( quadrupole - quadrupole ) interaction , such as exists in coherent dipole @xcite ( quadrupole @xcite ) radiative excitation of atoms or molecules . </S>",
    "<S> we do _ not _ make the common approximation of including only nearest - neighbour interactions , but rather we diagonalize the full hamiltonian , and for arbitrary distances relative to the radiation wavelength . </S>",

    "<S> , we present some results specific to the physical realization of qubits in terms of tlas interacting via a retarded dipole - dipole ( or quadrupole - quadrupole ) interaction . </S>",
    "<S> we have special interest in the total decay rates of these eigenstates in order to identify particularly long lived states , which may be useful in encoding quantum information . to quantum information theorists , </S>",
    "<S> these are known as `` decoherence - free '' states , and to spectroscopists as `` subradiant '' states @xcite . in general , </S>",
    "<S> complete subradiance exists only in the small sample limit , when distance effects are ignored . </S>",
    "<S> since our calculations contain the complete distance dependence , they can be used to examine deviations from the `` long wavelength '' or `` equal collective decoherence '' assumption commonly made in the theory of decoherence - free subspaces .    in the spectroscopy community , </S>",
    "<S> the study of collective atomic phenomena is many years old , beginning with dicke s pioneering article @xcite ; for the early work , see @xcite , and references therein . </S>",
    "<S> a detailed study of the cooperative emission by a fully - excited system of 3 identical atoms in some specific geometrical configurations was performed by richter @xcite , while the complete eigenstates for two- and three - atom systems of arbitrary geometrical arrangement can be found in reference @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the single - excitation eigenstates of linear chains were presented in @xcite , of two - dimensional arrays in @xcite , and of rings and regular polygons in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> single and double excitations of regular polygons in the long - wavelength limit were considered by spano and mukamel @xcite ; however , they included in their calculations only nearest - neighbour interactions , so that our energy eigenvalues and eigenstates differ considerably from theirs . </S>"
