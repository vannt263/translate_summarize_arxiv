    "_ things should be made simple , but not simpler_. from this sentence attributed to albert einstein is where we take the title of this work to show that if the spin concept of elementary particles had been known to physics before general relativity was born most probably the geometrization of spacetime proposed by its creator should be changed by the geometrization of a different manifold , larger than spacetime , so that today s general relativity would be considered as a theory of gravitation of simpler and spinless matter .",
    "the variational approach of classical mechanics can always be interpreted as a geodesic statement on the space @xmath0 of the boundary variables of the variational formalism @xcite . but this metric manifold @xmath0 , is not a pseudo - riemannian space but rather a finsler space @xcite , @xcite , where the symmetric metric tensor @xmath1 is not only a function of the point @xmath2 , but also of its velocity @xmath3 , where the overdot means derivative with respect to some arbitrary evolution parameter . for the relativistic spinless or point particle",
    "this manifold @xmath0 is just the spacetime @xmath4 and in the free case the metric is minkowski s metric @xmath5 .",
    "but if the particle has spin it would have more degrees of freedom , so that the variational approach will be described as a geodesic problem in a larger manifold than spacetime .",
    "interactions and gravitation would modify the metric of this larger manifold , so that to restrict ourselves to the geometrization of the spacetime submanifold is to simplify the problem , or in physical terms , to reduce the gravitational behaviour of real spinning matter to that of spinless and unexistent matter .",
    "in the next section [ sec : geodesic ] , i will make a summary of the variational approach of classical mechanics , which shows how it can be interpreted as a geodesic statement and the way to obtain the metric from the lagrangian . if the lagrangian of a free elementary particle is modified by any interaction , the metric is modified .",
    "any interaction modifies the geometry of the @xmath0 manifold .",
    "in section [ sec : metrics ] we analyze some examples to show the finsler metric structure of the spacetime of a charged point particle under some external interactions , which include a uniform magnetic field and a constant gravitational field and the newtonian gravitational field of a point mass @xmath6 . in all cases the modification of the metric coefficients involve dependence on the velocities of the point particle . a riemannian approximation to the metric",
    "can be obtained in the low velocity limit .    in section [ sec : spin ] after a short introduction to the concept of classical elementary particle i will describe the most general @xmath0 manifold of a relativistic spinning particle which satisfies dirac s equation when quantized .",
    "it is on this manifold that the plausible generalization of einstein s formalism has to be worked out .    as a general conclusion ,",
    "general relativity is a restricted theory of gravitation and therefore a simpler theory in two aspects .",
    "one , that the manifold whose geometry is changed by any interaction is larger than spacetime because elementary particles are spinning particles .",
    "the second is that the modification of the metric coefficients should involve dependence on the velocities .",
    "let us consider any mechanical system of @xmath7 degrees of freedom @xmath8 , @xmath9 , described by a lagrangian , @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the time and @xmath12 .",

    "the variational approach will be written as @xmath21 with the same boundary values on the @xmath0 manifold as before @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "but now the lagrangian @xmath24 is independent of the evolution parameter @xmath19 and it is a homogeneous function of first degree of the derivatives @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "this means that @xmath25 is a positive definite homogeneous function of second degree of the derivatives @xmath3 , so that euler s theorem on homogeneous functions allows us to write @xmath26 where index 0 corresponds to the time variable and the @xmath27 are computed from @xmath25 by @xmath28 between the allowed boundary states @xmath22 and @xmath23 , since @xmath29 , the metric @xmath1 represents a definite positive metric which transforms as a second rank covariant tensor under transformations which leave @xmath24 invariant @xcite .",
    "the variational problem can be stated as @xmath30 @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the arc length on the @xmath0 manifold with respect to the metric @xmath27 .",
    "the variational statement has been transformed into a geodesic problem with a finsler metric .",
    "as shown in @xcite this is valid even for lagrangian systems depending on higher order derivatives @xmath33 , @xmath34 . in this case",
    "the manifold of the boundary variables @xmath0 , which will be called the kinematical space from now on , is spanned by the time @xmath11 , the @xmath7 degrees of freedom @xmath8 and their corresponding time derivatives up to order @xmath35",
    ".    since @xmath24 is homogeneous of first degree in terms of the derivatives @xmath3 can also be decomposed as a sum of terms with dimensions of action if the arbitrary evolution parameter is taken dimensionless , @xmath36 where the @xmath37 are homogeneous functions of zero - th degree of the @xmath38 , so that they involve time derivatives of the different variables .",
    "the metric coefficients can be expressed as @xmath39 and are also homogeneous functions of zero - th degree of the @xmath38 .    as an example",
    ", the relativistic point particle of mass @xmath40 and spin 0 has a kinematical space spanned by time @xmath11 and the position of the point @xmath41 , so that the free lagrangian @xmath42 , ( @xmath43 for the antiparticle , @xmath44 for the particle ) is clearly a homogeneous function of first degree of the derivatives @xmath45 and @xmath46 . with @xmath47 , the finsler",
    "metric becomes @xmath48 where @xmath5 is diag@xmath49 and @xmath50 the energy - momentum four - vector .",
    "the interaction with some external electromagnetic field is described by the new lagrangian @xmath51 , with @xmath52 , so that the variational problem is transformed into a geodesic problem with a new metric on @xmath0 space , given by @xmath53 @xmath54 the modification of the metric vanishes when @xmath55 . because @xmath50 is not explicitely dependent of the variables @xmath56",
    ", the dependence of the metric on the spacetime coordinates is coming only from the external fields @xmath57 .",
    "but it depends on the @xmath3 variables through its dependence on the @xmath50 and its derivatives .",
    "in figure [ fig : motions ] we show three possible motions of a charged point particle in its kinematical space , which reduces in this case to the spacetime .",
    "the three trajectories are geodesics of spacetime but with respect to three different metrics . in part",
    "( a ) the motion is free , the trajectory is a straight line . in ( b )",
    "the particle is under the action of an external uniform magnetic field , and the trajectory has curvature and torsion . in this case",
    "the finsler metric of spacetime is different than the metric in the free case .",
    "the external magnetic field modifies the metric .",
    "finally in ( c ) it is the same free trajectory but as seen by an accelerated observer . according to the equivalence principle this is equivalent to the analysis under a global and constant gravitational field .",
    "also in this case the metric has been modified .        in case ( a )",
    "the metric is @xmath58 , where @xmath5 is diag@xmath49 .",
    "it is the constant minkowski metric .    in the case",
    "( b ) , let us assume a uniform magnetic field along @xmath59 axis of intensity @xmath60 . we can take as the potential vector @xmath61 and scalar potential @xmath62 .",
    "the lagrangian of the point particle under this field is @xmath63 this lagrangian leads to the lorentz force dynamical equation @xmath64    according to ( [ eq : metricaem ] ) and calling @xmath65 , the finsler metric of spacetime is , @xmath66 @xmath67 @xmath68 @xmath69 @xmath70 @xmath71 as we see , the metric coefficients are functions of the point , i.e. , of the variable @xmath56 , but they are functions of the three components of the velocity of the particle @xmath72 , and thus @xmath73 . if the velocity is negligible with respect to @xmath74 , the metric coefficients become @xmath75 vanishing the remaining ones , and since the dependence on the velocity has dissapeared the metric has been transformed into a riemannian metric .",
    "spacetime metric is riemannian in the low velocity limit .",
    "these metric coefficients give rise to a restricted lagrangian @xmath76 , @xmath77 such that when compared with ( [ eq : lb ] ) we have an additional term @xmath78 from the restricted lagrangian ( [ eq : lr ] ) the force acting on the point particle is not longer the lorentz force .    in the case ( c ) in a uniform gravitational field",
    "@xmath79 , the dynamical equations @xmath80 , independent of the mass of the particle , come from the lagrangian @xmath81 from the geodesic point of view it corresponds to an evolution in a spacetime with the finslerian metric given by : @xmath82 @xmath83 @xmath84 @xmath85 @xmath86 @xmath87 if again , the velocity is negligible with respect to @xmath74 , the nonvanishing coefficients are @xmath88 @xmath89 i.e. , @xmath90 where the @xmath91 component is the same as the corresponding component of the rindler metric corresponding to a noninertial accelerated observer or to the presence of a global uniform gravitational field , in general relativity .",
    "a final example is the relativistic point particle in the newtonian potential of a point mass @xmath6 .",
    "the dynamical equations @xmath92 independent of the mass of the particle , come from the lagrangian @xmath93 if we take into account ( [ eq : metrica ] ) the metric is @xmath94 @xmath95 @xmath96 @xmath97 @xmath98 @xmath99 it is a finsler metric , which in the case of low velocities only the diagonal components survive @xmath100 if the last term @xmath101 is considered negligible , it is the @xmath91 coefficient of schwarzschild s metric .",
    "the @xmath102 are different than in the schwarzschild case . in any case",
    "we see that the coefficients , in the low velocity limit , they reduce to the gravitational potential of the central mass @xmath6 , divided by @xmath103 .    in all the examples , the free lagrangian @xmath104 of the spinless particle , has been transformed by the interactions in the way @xmath105 where the new metric @xmath73 is a finslerian metric .",
    "the low velocity limit of the above metrics produce a riemannian approximation which does not give rise to the usual dynamical equations .",
    "however , general relativity states that gravity modifies the metric of spacetime producing a new ( pseudo-)riemannian metric @xmath106 , which is related through einstein s equations to the energy momentum distribution @xmath107 of all forms of matter and energy . the motion of a point particle in this gravitational background is a geodesic on spacetime , and therefore can be treated as a lagrangian dynamical problem with a lagrangian @xmath108 in the spirit of unification of all interactions , in particular electromagnetism produces a finsler metric of spacetime , one is tempted to extend the formulation of gravity ( [ eq : grav ] ) to ( [ eq : eml ] ) by allowing to the metric produced by gravity to be also a function of the derivatives . otherwise , to assume only a riemannian metric is to consider that gravity produces a different geometrization than any other interaction . in a region",
    "where the gravitational field can be considered uniform , the lagrangian dynamics of the point particle is equivalent to a geodesic problem in that region where the metric is necessarily a finsler metric , as seen in the above examples . the elimination of the presence of the velocities in the metric coefficients could be interpreted as a low velocity limit of a more general gravitational theory .",
    "in the mentioned reference @xcite and previous works cited in , an elementary particle is defined as a mechanical system whose kinematical space @xmath0 is necessarily a homogeneous space of the poincar group @xmath109 .",
    "the idea is that an elementary particle can not be divided and , if not annihilated with its antiparticle , can not be deformed so that any state is just a kinematical modification of any one of them @xcite .",
    "when the initial state @xmath22 is modified by the dynamics , the subsequent states @xmath110 can always be obtained from it by some change @xmath111 of inertial observer @xmath112 and also @xmath113 , so that given any two points @xmath114 we can always find some @xmath111 which links them .",
    "it is clear that the point particle manifold is a homogeneous space of @xmath109 and thus fulfills this requirement , but it describes a spinless object and there are no spinless elementary particles in nature . to describe spin we have to enlarge this kinematical space with the above constraint to obtain the largest homogeneous space of @xmath109 to describe the elementary particle with the more complex structure . the classical system that when quantized satisfies dirac s equation corresponds to a kinematical space spanned by the following variables @xmath115 , which are interpreted as the time @xmath11 , position of the center of charge @xmath41 , velocity of the center of charge @xmath116 at the speed of light @xmath117 , and the orientation @xmath118 of a cartesian system located at point @xmath41 @xcite .",
    "it is a nine - dimensional kinematical space described by four noncompact variables @xmath119 and five compact ones @xmath120 , being @xmath121 the orientation of the velocity vector @xmath122 and the orientation of the particle local frame @xmath118 .",
    "the particle has a center of mass @xmath123 which is expressed in terms of @xmath41 and its time derivatives .",
    "elementary spinning particles have two distinguished points the center of mass and the center of charge which are different points . the cartesian frame can be taken as the frenet - serret triad , so that the angular velocity of the particle can also be expressed in terms of the derivatives of the position of the point @xmath41 .",
    "the free motion of the center of charge @xmath41 corresponds to a helix of constant curvature and torsion when expressed in terms of the frenet - serret triad , and at a velocity of constant absolute value @xmath74 .",
    "this classical model of elementary particle can be applied for leptons and quarks if , as assumed , they satisfy in the quantum formalism dirac s equation .    if we want to include gravitation we have to admit arbitrary changes of spacetime coordinates , not only those given by the poincar group",
    "this will produce a modification of the metric of the spacetime submanifold , but also the modification of the remaining components of the metric on the whole kinematical @xmath0-space . because all known baryonic and leptonic matter and the gauge bosons are spinning objects we can not start the geometrization of matter by assuming that it is only the metric of the kinematical space of the point particle which is modified , because there are no spinless objects in nature .",
    "we have to geometrize the kinematical space of the spinning particle accordingly .",
    "we can not make things simpler .",
    "we consider that general relativity is a constrained , and therefore a simpler formalism for describing gravity for two reasons : one is that the geometrization of spacetime has to be enlarged to consider finsler metrics instead of pseudo - riemannian metrics , and another that the manifold which describes the boundary states of spinning matter is larger than spacetime .",
    "the manifold @xmath0 of the boundary variables of any lagrangian dynamical system is always a finsler metric space , so that any variational approach is equivalent to a geodesic statement on this metric manifold .",
    "this metric , which is in general a function of the variables @xmath2 and their derivatives @xmath3 , depends on the interactions , and to assume that gravitation only produces a modification of the metric which is only a function of the point @xmath56 , is a restriction of a more general formalism which allows for this modification , in the spirit of unification of all interactions .",
    "the second constraint of a gravitational theory is that it has to be applied to a manifold larger than spacetime , because spacetime is the boundary manifold of the spinless point particle and spinless elementary particles seem not to exist in nature .    without any assumption about general covariance , or any assumption about the dynamical behaviour of spacetime , but in a lagrangian framework , we have analysed several examples of the finsler space structure of spacetime under different interactions . in all of them",
    "the new metrics are true finsler metrics which in the case of low velocity limit , and therefore a metric independent of the velocities , resemble the metrics obtained in a general relativity formalism .",
    "it is possible that the spin structure of matter plays no role in the gravitational analysis of the solar system and the usual treatment in terms of only spacetime variables is sufficient to describe planetary motions .",
    "but in cosmological models , when the velocity of particles is not negligible , redshits of order 6 and higher have been quoted for several galaxies which correspond to velocities of @xmath124 , a metric dependent of the velocities would produce a different analysis than a riemannian one .",
    "when a quantum analysis is required , may be in a neutron star with the magnetic moments of the particles aligned , in a gravitational colapse with a huge density matter where gravitational effects associated to the spin structure are expected , is unavoidable to enlarge the formalism to more general aspects of the form considered here in which the space @xmath0 is larger than spacetime and the metric should depend also on the velocities .",
    "the physical restrictions have to applied in the analysis of the particular cases , not at the very begining of the formalism .",
