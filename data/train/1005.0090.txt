    "the inert doublet model ( idm ) is an extension of the standard model ( sm ) in which the scalar sector of the model includes , in addition to the higgs field of the sm , an additional @xmath2 doublet ( the so - called  inert doublet \" ) which couples only to the higgs and electroweak gauge sectors of the sm .",
    "this additional doublet does not acquire a nonzero vacuum expectation value ( vev ) ; hence the fields of this doublet do not contribute to electroweak - symmetry breaking , nor do they mix with those of the sm higgs doublet .",
    "this model was originally proposed  @xcite for its applications to neutrino physics .",
    "however , the recent observation  @xcite that the presence of an inert doublet can provide the necessary correction to the oblique @xmath3 and @xmath4 parameters  @xcite to accommodate a heavy higgs boson , with a mass as high as @xmath5  gev , without running afoul of lep constraints  @xcite has stimulated a great deal of renewed interest in the model . since then",
    ", the idm has found a host of additional applications to subjects as diverse as neutrino physics  @xcite , electroweak - symmetry breaking  @xcite , and grand unification  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the model is also interesting from the point of view of dark - matter phenomenology .",
    "since an additional discrete symmetry is needed in order to forbid the coupling of the inert doublet to sm fermions , the lightest physical degree of freedom in the inert doublet , if electrically neutral , is a viable weakly interacting massive particle ( wimp ) dark - matter candidate .",
    "analyses of the relic abundance of this particle , often referred to as the lightest inert particle ( lip ) , have been performed  @xcite , and assessments of both direct  @xcite and indirect ( including neutrino  @xcite , cosmic - ray positron and antiproton  @xcite , and @xmath6-ray  @xcite ) detection prospects have been carried out .",
    "given the myriad implications and applications of this model , it is natural to examine how an inert doublet might be identified at the lhc .",
    "certain potential signatures were discussed in  @xcite , and a parton - level analysis of some of these signatures ( including a potentially observable modification of the total width of the sm higgs boson ) was performed in ref .",
    "@xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , a detailed , detector - level analysis of the detection prospects in the dilepton channel  perhaps the most promising channel in which to search for evidence of an inert doublet at the lhc  was performed for a set of representative benchmark points , each corresponding to a particular region of model parameter space in which the lip was able to account for the observed dark matter relic abundance .",
    "this analysis showed that an observable signal in this channel could be obtained at the lhc with @xmath7 of integrated luminosity in a substantial number of these cases .    since a great many scenarios for physics beyond the standard model ( bsm ) also give rise to a @xmath8 signature , it is worthwhile to investigate other channels which might also yield observable signals indicating the presence of an inert doublet . in this work ,",
    "we focus on the detection prospects in the trilepton channel : @xmath9 .",
    "indeed , this channel has long been regarded as one of the most promising channels in which to look for evidence of physics beyond the standard model , and , in particular , of supersymmetry  @xcite , due to its relatively small sm background .",
    "we begin in sect .",
    "[ sec : model ] with a brief review of the inert doublet model and a summary of the relevant theoretical and experimental constraints .",
    "we then present a set of benchmark scenarios in which all of these constraints are satisfied and the lip relic density accounts for the dark matter abundance observed by wmap  @xcite . in sect .",
    "[ sec : cuts ] , we discuss trilepton production in the idm and outline the event - selection criteria we use to differentiate the trilepton signal from the sm background . in sect .",
    "[ sec : results ] , we present our numerical results and discuss the lhc discovery potential for each of our benchmark scenarios , and in sect .  [",
    "sec : conclusion ] , we offer some concluding remarks on the scope and implications of our results .",
    "the inert doublet model is an extension of the sm in which the fundamental scalar sector comprises not one , but two scalar doublets , which we denote @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "the first of these doublets , @xmath10 , can be identified with the usual higgs doublet of the sm .",
    "it receives a nonzero vev of @xmath12  gev , and consequently bears full responsibility both for electroweak - symmetry breaking ( ewsb ) and for the generation of sm fermion masses .",
    "by contrast , the second doublet , @xmath11 , does not contribute to electroweak - symmetry breaking ( @xmath13 ) ; furthermore , it is prohibited from coupling to the quarks and leptons of the sm by a @xmath14 parity ( often called matter parity ) under which @xmath11 is odd , whereas all other fields in the theory ( including @xmath10 ) are even .",
    "this @xmath14 symmetry also renders the lightest physical degree of freedom contained in @xmath11  the so - called lightest inert particle , or lip  absolutely stable , and hence ( if neutral ) a good wimp dark - matter candidate .",
    "the most general @xmath15-invariant scalar potential which respects both @xmath16 gauge - invariance and the aforementioned @xmath14 matter parity may be written in the form @xmath17 .",
    "\\label{eq : vscal}\\ ] ] after ewsb is triggered by the vev of @xmath10 , the physical scalar spectrum of the model comprises the usual sm higgs field @xmath18 ( the neutral , @xmath15-even degree of freedom in @xmath10 ) , as well as four additional fields corresponding to the four degrees of freedom in @xmath11 .",
    "these include a pair of charged scalars @xmath19 , a neutral , @xmath15-even scalar @xmath3 , and a neutral , @xmath15-odd scalar @xmath20 .",
    "the masses of these scalars , written in terms of the parameters appearing in eq .",
    "( [ eq : vscal ] ) and the sm higgs vev @xmath21 , are given by @xmath22 it is also useful to define a pair of mass splittings @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "indeed , for our present purposes , it is most convenient to characterize a given model in terms of the parameter set @xmath25 , where @xmath26 represents the combination of the @xmath27 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : vscal ] ) which controls the size of the @xmath28 and @xmath29 couplings .",
    "the parameter space of the idm is restricted by a number of considerations .",
    "these include model - consistency requirements , such as perturbativity and vacuum stability , as well as experimental constraints derived from electroweak precision data , the results of direct searches at lep and at the tevatron , etc .",
    "in addition , if we further demand that the lip be the dominant component of the dark matter , we must also require that its relic density falls within the wmap @xmath30 bounds  @xcite on the observed dark - matter relic density , and that the appropriate constraints from dark - matter direct - detection experiments are likewise satisfied . since these constraints , along with their implications for the parameter space of the idm , have been analyzed and discussed in detail in refs .",
    "@xcite , we will not recapitulate the analysis here , but simply summarize the results .",
    "note that in our analysis below , we will assume that the @xmath15-even scalar @xmath3 is the dark matter candidate .",
    "the corresponding results obtained in the case in which @xmath20 plays the role of the dark matter candidate are very similar .",
    ".a list of benchmark points used in our analysis , defined in terms of the model parameters @xmath31 .",
    "dark matter relic density and collider phenomenology of the idm depend little on @xmath32 , which is set to 0.1 for all benchmark points in this study . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     in table  [ tab : bmxsecscutiii ] , we show the discovery potential for the trilepton signal at the lhc ( assuming a center - of - mass energy of 14  tev ) for each of the idm benchmark points defined above , assuming an integrated luminosity of 300  @xmath33 in each of the two detectors .",
    "the best prospects for discovery are obtained for the benchmarks lh2 and lh6 , each of which yields a statistical significance of more than @xmath0 . the reason why these benchmarks are comparatively auspicious is twofold",
    "first , both involve a light lip , with a mass @xmath34  gev .",
    "second , both also feature a mass splitting @xmath35  gev , which , on the one hand , is small enough that @xmath36 decays will occur through an off - shell @xmath37 boson , but , on the other hand , is large enough so that the resulting charged leptons will not generally be too soft to escape detection .    for lh7 , which features a similarly light lip , with @xmath38  gev , but for which @xmath39  gev ,",
    "the primary difficulty in resolving the signal is that the ( dominant ) @xmath40 background can not be suppressed by applying a @xmath37 veto on @xmath41 , since @xmath36 decays occur via an on - shell @xmath37 . indeed",
    ", this two - body decay mode of the @xmath20 is analogous to what are often referred to as `` spoiler '' processes in the literature on trilepton signals in weak - scale supersymmetry  @xcite .",
    "thus , although the signal cross section for lh7 after cuts is relatively large , the unsuppressed standard - model @xmath42 background renders discovery via this channel difficult . as for lh1 , for which @xmath43 , the standard - model @xmath42 background can be suppressed by imposing a lower limit on @xmath44 .",
    "the signal cross section , however , is very small after the imposition of this cut , which renders a discovery via this channel difficult for this benchmark scenario as well .",
    "the discovery prospects for benchmark point lh3 are also less auspicious .",
    "one reason for this is that the lip mass is far heavier in this scenario , and the production cross - section is therefore appreciably lower , as indicated in table  [ tab : bmxsecs ] .",
    "another is that since @xmath45 and @xmath46 are smaller for this benchmark than for lh1 and lh6 , the charged leptons will be significantly softer , and more of them will escape detection .",
    "for this reason , a proportionally greater reduction in signal events occurs as a result of our detector - acceptance cuts , as can be seen from table  [ tab : leveliicuts ] . for benchmark point lh8",
    ", @xmath46 is smaller still , and the effect of the level  i cuts even more severe ; hence the trilepton signal is even more difficult to resolve .",
    "a few further remarks comparing and contrasting the trilepton phenomenology of the idm with that of supersymmetric models are in order .",
    "indeed , the process @xmath47 , which yields the dominant contribution to the trilepton signal in the idm is in many ways analogous to the direct chargino - neutralino production process @xmath48 , with @xmath49 and @xmath50 , where @xmath51 are the lightest and second lightest neutralinos and @xmath52 is the lightest chargino .",
    "this channel has long been regarded as a promising discovery channel for weak - scale supersymmetry .",
    "indeed , as was shown in  @xcite , for certain opportune regions of parameter space , an observable signal could be obtained with less than @xmath53 of integrated luminosity at the lhc .",
    "more recently , the cms collaboration , working in the context of minimal supergravity , has indicated that a @xmath0 discovery of supersymmetry could be achieved in this channel with @xmath54 of integrated luminosity , provided that the gaugino mass parameter @xmath55  gev  @xcite .",
    "thus , we see that given similar mass spectra , the discovery prospects for the supersymmetric process are markedly better than those for its idm counterpart .",
    "this is primarily due to to the substantial difference  a relative factor of around 16  between the production cross - sections for @xmath48 in the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) and @xmath56 in the idm .",
    "this difference owes to two important distinctions between the characteristics of the relevant particles in the two models .",
    "the first of these is that @xmath52 and @xmath57 are weyl fermions whereas @xmath19 and @xmath20 are real scalars . as a consequence ,",
    "the cross - sections for the corresponding processes in the two models differ by a relative factor of roughly 4 in the high - energy limit ( i.e.  the limit in which @xmath58 , where @xmath59 denotes the mass of any of the particles involved in the interaction ) . the second relevant distinction is that the scalar doublet @xmath11 of the idm is in the fundamental representation of @xmath60 , whereas the charged and neutral winos ( which respectively constitute the dominant components of @xmath52 and @xmath57 in the relevant region of susy parameter space ) are in the adjoint representation .",
    "this translates into another relative factor of 4 between the corresponding production cross - sections .",
    "the practical consequence of this result , of course , is that observing a trilepton signal in the idm is far more difficult than it is in its mssm analogue .",
    "indeed , we have seen that although the trilepton channel is one of the cleanest channels in which one might hope to discover supersymmetry at the lhc , in the idm , this channel can only be observed in the region of parameter space in which the lip is light ( @xmath34 gev ) and the mass splitting @xmath46 is relatively large ( @xmath61 gev ) .    while the above analysis was performed assuming a center - of - mass energy @xmath62  tev , it is also worthwhile to consider how the discovery prospects would differ at an lhc operating energy of @xmath63  tev . in this case",
    ", the @xmath64 production cross - sections are reduced to roughly 60% of the values given in table  [ tab : bmxsecs ] , while the ( generally dominant ) @xmath40 background drops to roughly 80% of its 14  tev value . since signal event count is not generally a limiting factor in event selection , we would expect each of the @xmath65 values quoted above to drop to roughly 65% of its 14  tev value at a 10  tev machine , given identical luminosities and assuming similar cut efficiencies . while this is not an imperceptible reduction ,",
    "it is by no means a severe one ; thus , were our universe in fact to resemble that described by an idm benchmark scenario such as lh2 or lh6 , one would still expect to see evidence of trilepton production from the decays of heavy inert particles at the lhc , even at @xmath63  tev .",
    "the inert doublet model is a simple yet incredibly versatile scenario for physics beyond the standard model . among its phenomenological advantages",
    "is that it provides a viable wimp dark - matter candidate in the form of the lightest inert particle . in this work ,",
    "we have investigated the observability of a trilepton signal at the lhc in the inert doublet model . while the first signals of an inert doublet at the lhc are likely to appear in the dilepton channel @xcite , the observation of a signal in the trilepton channel could provide valuable additional information about the parameter space of the model and assist in distinguishing the idm from other bsm scenarios which give rise to similar signature patterns .",
    "we have shown that at an integrated luminosity @xmath66 , it should be possible to resolve the trilepton signal , provided that the lip is light ( @xmath38  gev ) , the mass splitting @xmath46 lies within the range @xmath67 , and @xmath45 is small enough ( @xmath68  gev ) that @xmath69 production is not drastically suppressed .",
    "these criteria coincide with those which lead to the best detection prospects in the dilepton channel as well .    it should be noted , however , that one could only hope to observe a trilepton signal in regions of parameter space in which the higgs is lighter than around 180  gev . although the inert doublet model can certainly accommodate a heavier higgs boson",
    " indeed , among the model s numerous advantages is its ability to alleviate the little hierarchy problem  the requisite contributions to the oblique @xmath4 parameter needed for this owe to the existence of a sizeable mass splitting between @xmath19 and @xmath3 . when this is the case , the @xmath56 production cross - section will be highly suppressed , and the trilepton - signal contribution from this process will consequently be unobservable at the lhc .    as a final word , we note that although the analysis performed in this work was conducted within the framework of the inert doublet model , similar signatures involving the production of charged and neutral scalars which subsequently decay into other , lighter , scalar particles and sm gauge bosons appear in many other bsm scenarios .",
    "we emphasize that our results should also apply in any such scenario in which the aforementioned lighter scalar particle is neutral and stable ( on collider time scales ) , and hence appears in the detector as missing energy .",
    "the observation of a clean trilepton@xmath70 signal above the sm background would be a clear indication of new physics . to determine the precise nature of that new physics , however , and to pin down the particle nature of the dark matter candidate",
    "will likely require additional data from a variety of sources .",
    "these may include complementary channels at the lhc , signals at direct or indirect dark - matter - detection experiments , or results from one of many other available experimental probes of physics beyond the standard model .",
    "we would like to thank j. alwall for correspondence regarding the madgraph simulation package , and e. dolle for useful discussions .",
