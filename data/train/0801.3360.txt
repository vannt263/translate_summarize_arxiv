    "the precision measurement of the hadron production cross section in @xmath1 annihilation at flavour factories , such as @xmath2 , @xmath3-charm and @xmath4-factories , requires a detailed knowledge of the collider luminosity @xcite .",
    "it can be derived by counting the number of events of a given reference process and normalizing this number to the corresponding theoretical cross section @xcite .",
    "it follows that , in order to maintain small the total luminosity error given by the sum in quadrature of the relative experimental and theoretical uncertainty , the reference process must be a reaction with high statistics and calculable with an accuracy as high as possible .",
    "for this reason , the luminosity monitoring processes employed at flavour factories are qed processes , namely bhabha scattering , two photon and muon pair production .",
    "in particular , at da@xmath2ne , vepp-2 m and pep - ii the large - angle bhabha process is primarily used and the other reactions are measured as cross checks @xcite , while at cesr @xcite all the three processes are considered and the luminosity is derived as an appropriate average of the measurements of the three qed reactions .    at da@xmath2ne , a comparison between the luminosity measurement using bhabha events and the process @xmath5 shows very good agreement , the average difference in a run - by - run comparison being 0.3% @xcite .",
    "this precision necessarly demands progress on the theory side , since the monte carlo ( mc ) programs used for the simulation of photon pair production , _ i.e. _ babayaga v3.5  @xcite and bkqed  @xcite , have a theoretical precision of about @xmath6 .",
    "actually , the original formulation of babayaga is based on a qed parton shower ( ps ) approach for the treatment of leading logarithmic ( ll ) qed corrections and , as such , it lacks the effect of @xmath7 non - log contributions , which are important to achieve a precision at the per mille level . on the other hand ,",
    "the generator bkqed relies on an exact @xmath7 diagrammatic calculation , therefore neglecting the contribution of higher - order ll corrections , which have been already demonstrated to be necessary for @xmath8 luminosity monitoring at flavour factories @xcite .",
    "because of this motivation , the aim of the present paper is to describe a high - precision calculation of photon pair production in qed , based on the matching of exact next - to - leading - order ( nlo ) corrections with the qed ps algorithm , along the lines of the approach already developed for the bhabha process in ref .",
    "this will allow a reduction of the theoretical error in luminosity measurements at flavour factories , as demanded , in addition to precision measurements of the hadronic cross section , by improved experimental determinations of the @xmath9 cross section at low energies  @xcite , important for precision calculations of the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon .",
    "furthermore , a precise knowledge of @xmath1 annihilation in two photons is of interest for estimates of the background to neutral meson production .",
    "we do not include in our calculation pure weak corrections , which have been computed in ref .",
    "@xcite and turn out to be important at very high energies , well above the energy range explored by flavour factories . for completeness , it is worth mentioning that an independent calculation , including exact @xmath7 contributions supplemented with higher - order ll terms through collinear qed structure functions  @xcite , of the relevant corrections to @xmath5 at moderately high energies was performed in ref .",

    "conclusions and possible perspectives are drawn in section 4 .",
    "the cross section of the photon pair production process , with the additional emission of an arbitrary number of photons , can be written in the ll approximation as follows @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the sudakov form factor accounting for the soft - photon ( up to an energy equal to @xmath12 in units of the incoming fermion energy @xmath13 ) and virtual emission , @xmath12 is an infrared separator dividing soft and hard radiation and @xmath14 is related to the energy scale of the hard - scattering process . in our calculation",

    "[ tab:1 ] it can be seen that the exact @xmath7 corrections , measured by the relative contribution @xmath59 , lower the born cross section of about @xmath60 ( @xmath2 resonance ) , @xmath61 ( @xmath62 resonance ) and @xmath63 ( @xmath64 resonance ) .",
    "all - order corrections , due to the presence of an arbitrary number of photons and measured by the relative contribution @xmath65 , amount to about @xmath66 ( @xmath2 resonance ) , @xmath67 ( @xmath62 resonance ) and @xmath68 ( @xmath64 resonance ) , showing that the introduction of higher photon multiplicity gives an increasing of the @xmath7 corrected cross section .",
    "such an effect , due to @xmath69 ( with @xmath70 ) terms , is quantified by the contribution @xmath71 , which is a positive correction of about @xmath72 ( @xmath2 resonance ) , @xmath73 ( @xmath62 resonance ) and @xmath74 ( @xmath64 resonance ) , and , therefore , important in the light of the aimed per mille accuracy . on the other hand , also next - to - leading @xmath7 corrections , quantified by the contribution @xmath75 ,",

    ", we also evaluated the effect due to the most important sub - leading @xmath78 photonic corrections and given by @xmath79 contributions enhanced by infrared logarithms .",
    "actually , the bulk of such corrections is effectively incorporated in our approach , by means of factorization of @xmath7 next - to - leading terms with the leading @xmath7 contributions taken into account in the ps scheme , as argued and demonstrated in ref .",
    "it turns out that the effect due to @xmath80 corrections , which can be inferred from the cross section values according to the following formula @xmath81 does not exceed the 0.05% level .    as a whole",

    "lnset : relative effect ( in per cent ) of multiple photon corrections ( solid line ) and of non - log contributions of the matched ps algorithm ( dashed line ) . ]        for the angular distribution of the most energetic photon , the contribution of higher - order corrections beyond @xmath7 amounts to about 1% in the central region and is at a few per mille level at the edges of the distribution .",
    "more pronounced effects due to exponentiation are present for the the energy distribution of the most energetic photon . in the statistically dominant region",
    "around 0.5  gev , higher - order corrections reduce the @xmath7 distribution of about 20% , while they give rise to a significant hard tail in the proximity of the energy threshold of 0.3@xmath82 , as a consequence of the higher photon multiplicity of the resummed calculation with respect to the fixed @xmath7 prediction .",
    "concerning the acollinearity distribution , the contribution of higher - order corrections is positive and of about 10% in correspondence of quasi back - to - back photon events , whereas it is negative and decreasing from @xmath83% to @xmath84% for increasing acollinearity values .",
    "as far as the contributions of non - logaritmic effects , dominated by next - to - leading @xmath7 corrections , are concerned , they contribute at the level of some per mille for the angular and acollinearity distribution , while they lye in the some per cent range for the energy distribution .",
    "therefore , as for the cross section , the interplay between @xmath7 corrections and exponentiation is crucial for precise predictions at the level of differential cross sections .",
    "we have presented a high - precision qed calculation of the @xmath5 process , of interest for luminosity monitoring at flavour factories .",
    "the calculation , which includes all the relevant radiative corrections at the 0.1% precision level , is implemented in an improved version of the event generator babayaga , in order to contribute to a reduction of the uncertainty in luminosity measurements at @xmath1 colliders of moderately high energies .",
    "the accuracy of the approach has been demonstrated through a careful analysis of the various sources of photonic corrections to the experimentally relevant observables .",
    "the per mille precision reached for the two photon production process can , indeed , take advantage of the absence in such a process of the vacuum polarization uncertainty , present in both @xmath85 and @xmath86 , and can also rely on previous estimates of sub - leading two - loop corrections to bhabha scattering , that have been shown to typically contribute at the level of a few 0.01% in the energy range explored at flavour factories ( see _ e.g. _ ref . @xcite and references therein ) .",
