    "in this paper we analyze the physical and mathematical origin of band warping using two fundamental and complementary approaches to calculate electronic band structures , namely , the tight - binding ( tb ) method and the nearly - free - electron ( nfe ) model . more generally , we demonstrate that for the majority of non - degenerate bands one should not expect band warping at energy extrema , irrespective of whether band non - parabolicity may or may not be prominent .",
    "band non - parabolicity should not be confused with band warping .",
    "band non - parabolicity derives from terms of order higher than quadratic in a multi - dimensional taylor series expansion .",
    "by contrast , in the case of band warping , there is no possibility of performing a multi - dimensional taylor series approximation at the quadratic order already .",
    "now , band non - parabolicity becomes more and more evident when greater and greater coefficients of higher - order terms develop in its taylor series expansion , possibly as a result of stronger and stronger interactions with other bands approaching in energy the non - parabolic band .",
    "nevertheless , insofar as a non - parabolic band remains non - degenerate at an energy extremum , it typically remains non - warped therein .",
    "however , if a singular transition from a lower symmetry lattice to a higher symmetry lattice occurs , possibly as a result of variations in lattice constant parameters , a highly singular transformation may correspondingly ensue .",
    "namely , highly non - parabolic bands may forcibly become degenerate with one another at an isolated point in reciprocal space as a result of greater symmetry requirements . then ,",
    "though not invariably , band non - parabolicity coefficients may transform singularly into a warped band structure at the isolated point of degeneracy .",
    "smoothness of the touching bands is destroyed at the quadratic order of curvature already . ultimately , the warped singularity is a consequence of the singular transition to a larger symmetry group , allowing the possibility of irreducible representations of higher dimensions at special symmetry points in reciprocal space .",
    "primitive - rectangular ( a ) and square ( b ) bravais lattices.,title=\"fig : \" ] +    characteristics of `` warping '' are not exclusive to electronic or phononic band structures in crystals .",
    "perhaps as a deceivingly simple example , let us consider a potential function in classical mechanics or electrostatics of the form @xmath1 having further defined @xmath2 at the origin .",
    "this function could represent a frictionless surface onto which a point - particle slides under a uniform gravitational field in the negative @xmath3-direction .",
    "one can easily verify that @xmath4 represents a perfectly valid single - valued potential everywhere , yielding a conservative and irrotational force field , @xmath5 , everywhere .",
    "in fact , @xmath4 is continuous with continuous partial derivatives everywhere .",
    "it has a single absolute minimum at the origin , with a zero first - differential , representing a tangent horizontal plane at the origin .",
    "however , @xmath4 has discontinuous partial second - order derivatives at the origin , exclusively .",
    "thus , @xmath4 does not admit a second - differential at the origin , exclusively .",
    "this means that no smooth curvature can be defined for @xmath4 at the origin , exclusively .",
    "correspondingly , no taylor series expansion can be performed for @xmath4 at the origin , beyond the trivially zero first - order term .",
    "consequently , no theory of small oscillations is at all possible for such a simple potential , and countless more of that sort : a fact rarely mentioned in standard textbooks . correspondingly , complex chaotic and non - chaotic orbits",
    "develop at all scales around the minimum .",
    "functions of this sort , readily extended to three dimensions , may well represent interactions between atoms in molecules or crystals , excluding even the possibility of harmonic vibrations and quantization of phonons",
    ".    why then should any such seemingly reasonable function be excluded from physical consideration ?",
    "let us consider more suitable systems of curvilinear coordinates , such as cylindrical @xmath6 coordinates , in which our token example is expressed as @xmath7 this expression shows that our function is exactly quadratic in @xmath8 , the radial coordinate distance from the @xmath3-axis , but it maintains a periodically undulating angular term in @xmath9 for any non - zero distance , no matter how small .",
    "it turns out that in a quantum mechanical theory of crystals , though for reasons that are not immediately obvious , energy functions of the kind that we have just described , lacking smooth curvature at isolated critical points in reciprocal space , typically occur under certain conditions .",
    "this solid state feature , traditionally called  band warping \" of electronic or phononic energy structures , was discovered and it has been investigated for quite some time .",
    "original work began in the 50s.@xcite only recently , however , some authors have provided a more mathematically precise and applicable description of band warping based on the idea and formalism of an angular effective mass , which has lead to better treatments of transport , optical , and other fundamental properties of materials.@xcite in order to demonstrate unequivocally the origin of this basic phenomenon , let us begin by considering two fundamental crystal structures , namely , those of two - dimensional primitive - rectangular and square bravais lattices , shown in fig .",

    "tight - binding ( tb ) approximations provide perhaps the most basic method of calculating electronic energy band structures .",
    "tb is most applicable to bands originating from core or valence electrons tightly bound to their atoms , typically forming insulating or semiconducting materials , such as molecular solids , covalently bonded compounds , or ionic crystals .",
    "the prototypical example that we consider here consists of two @xmath0-type valence bands , retaining a relatively small number of empirical tb parameters .",
    "let us assume the existence of an orthonormal set of wannier functions @xmath23 and @xmath24 in a primitive - rectangular bravais lattice .",
    "let us then form two corresponding bloch sums and expand a crystal one - electron wave function @xmath25 on that basis .",

    "further tb parameters can and will be considered later , but they are inessential for the prototypical formulation that we are going to consider first .    with this basic @xmath0-type tb model ,",
    "we thus arrive at the following two , typically non - degenerate , bands at each @xmath36-point in the first bz of the primitive - rectangular reciprocal lattice : @xmath37{\\left ( m_{xx } ( { \\mathbf{k } } ) - m_{yy } ( { \\mathbf{k}})\\right)^2 + 4 m^2_{xy } ( { \\mathbf{k } } ) } \\right ) .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the energy difference or gap , @xmath38 , that occurs at @xmath39 , or @xmath40-point , generates a positive constant , @xmath41 , under the square root . this positive constant allows to perform a taylor series expansion of the square root to all orders in @xmath36 , including a quadratic expansion in @xmath36 around the relative minimum in energy difference at @xmath40 .",

    "we have investigated that question to considerable extent .",
    "we found that that is possible , but only under special conditions .",
    "for example , we can refine the tb model that we have just described for a primitive - rectangular lattice to include @xmath55 and @xmath56 overlap integrals among @xmath0-type atomic - like orbitals , rather than presuming orthonormal wannier functions from the beginning .",
    "in that situation , after some laborious and not necessarily physical  fine - tuning \" of interaction and overlap parameters , non - degenerate energy bands can be fabricated as having at @xmath39 an isolated critical point with non - smooth curvature , i.e. , _ non - degenerate band warping_. thus , warped non - degenerate electronic bands , similar in kind to the classical potential mentioned in the introduction , are not impossible to realize with special materials , but any such occurrence should be regarded as rather fortuitous and hardly robust or generic .",
    "the two - band @xmath0-type structure of a square lattice can not be continuously derived from that of the primitive - rectangular lattice by letting @xmath57 and @xmath58 approach each other continuously .",
    "for the square lattice , the interaction parameters @xmath59 and @xmath60 must become respectively identical because of the square symmetry , thus profoundly transforming the two - band tb matrix elements as    [ eqn : tb2 ] @xmath61    in eqns .",

    "topological considerations indicate that symmetry protection is not required to produce typical features of dirac and weyl points in two- and three - dimensional topological insulators and semimetals.@xcite our calculations further suggest that conical intersections of topological origin may be more common and robust than currently thought .",
    "although quite reasonable and consistent with experience , one may wonder whether the characteristics of electronic band warping that we have demonstrated might be partly due to peculiarities of tb approximations or underlying assumptions of orbital localization .",

    "nevertheless , such possibility can not be excluded in general , and it is not nearly as unusual as its converse , namely , that of a _ non - degenerate band becoming warped _ at an energy extremum as a result of more deliberate artifacts .",
    "so , let us proceed to demonstrate that perturbation with a more elaborate periodic potential diagonalization in a nfe model can and does produce a singular symmetry transition to a pair of degenerate and warped bands .",
    "that is the case for the lowest quadruplet of bands at the corner of the bz , i.e. , at the @xmath67-point , in passing from the primitive - rectangular to the square lattice .",
    "namely , let us consider a point @xmath141 in a neighborhood of the @xmath67-point , thus having @xmath142 .",
    "now we have to consider a full 4x4 matrix representing the interaction of four plane waves with wave vectors @xmath143 , @xmath144 , @xmath145 , and @xmath146 . to demonstrate the essential origin of band warping , it is enough to consider a slowly varying periodic potential with three fourier components , namely @xmath147 , and @xmath148 .",
    "these three parameters , @xmath149 , @xmath150 , and @xmath151 , all differ from one another in a primitive - rectangular lattice . that removes all degeneracies of the quadruplet represented in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : e1p ] ) for the empty lattice at the @xmath67-point , adding the energies @xmath152 , @xmath153 , @xmath154 , and @xmath155 to each level .",
    "accordingly , we obtain four non - degenerate non - warped bands at the @xmath67-point of a primitive - rectangular lattice , consistent with its @xmath115 symmetry .",
    "however , for a square lattice with @xmath12 , @xmath156 is required by the greater symmetry of the @xmath72 point - group , doubled in size and thus admitting two - dimensional irreducible representations . as a result , the two middle bands become degenerate at the @xmath67-point of a square lattice and they become correspondingly warped therein . the origin of this warping is due to the canceling of zero - order or constant terms under two nested square roots .",
    "it is thus worth describing in some detail this more elaborate mechanism of cancellation .",
    "the angular effective mass procedure to evaluate warping of the two middle degenerate bands is to expand each one in a one - dimensional _ radial _ taylor series , which is generally possible.@xcite these bands thus become represented as @xmath157 where one can show that @xmath158 the @xmath57 , @xmath58 , and @xmath159 parameters are given by @xmath160 where @xmath161 is again defined as the energy unit .",
    "the warping parameter,@xcite @xmath76 , can be derived analytically as    @xmath162    where @xmath163 is the complete elliptic integral of the first kind , namely , @xmath164 a plot of this warping parameter , @xmath76 , at @xmath67 , as a function of the perturbing potential parameters @xmath149 and @xmath151 , is shown in fig .",

    "we made the reasonable assumption that @xmath166 for a slowly varying potential , but an analogous plot can be obtained for @xmath167 . in either case ,",
    "our plots indicate that warping of the two degenerate middle bands at @xmath67 are robust as @xmath149 and @xmath151 vary .     warping parameter , @xmath76 , for the upper middle band , @xmath165 , having a relative minimum at @xmath67 for the square lattice . @xmath149 and @xmath151",

    "part ( c ) shows the splitting of the two middle bands around @xmath67 for @xmath171 , but not identically zero : the accidental degeneracy is thus removed along the two diagonal lines off @xmath67.,title=\"fig : \" ] +    for further demonstration , let us study the limiting case of @xmath171 , while keeping finite @xmath172 .",
    "this illustrates a similar , but more involved mechanism of band warping than that previously demonstrated in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : tb3 ] ) for the simpler case of just two @xmath0-like bands treated with a tb model .",
    "now , for the upper middle band , @xmath165 , degenerate at @xmath67 with the lower middle band , @xmath173 , in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : epm ] ) , the energy dispersion can be transformed back in terms of rectangular coordinates as @xmath174 in this expression , eq .",
    "( [ eqn : quarticradicalization ] ) , if we let @xmath175 and @xmath176 vanish , there remains a positive constant , @xmath177 , under the inner square root .",
    "that would permit a taylor series expansion of the inner square root all by itself .",
    "however , subtraction of the square root of that constant from another constant , @xmath178 , which belongs to the outer square root , eliminates any possibility of a taylor series expansion for the overall quartically radicalized expression and mixing of the two middle bands degenerate at @xmath67 . in fig .  [",
    "fig : fig10 ] ( a ) , we show the splitting , mixing and warping for the quadruplet of bands at @xmath67 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig10 ] ( b ) , we focus on the mixing and warping of the two middle bands degenerate at @xmath67",
    ". the line - degeneracy appearance must be further investigated , however .",
    "having set @xmath170 identically is causing the two middle bands to remain accidentally degenerate along two diagonal lines intersecting at @xmath67 .",
    "that would permit a labeling of those bands as two saddle - point bands at @xmath67 , rotated by @xmath179 degrees relative to each other , thus crossing each other along those two diagonal stationary lines .",
    "however , such labeling , which derives from the original primitive - rectangular lattice , becomes ultimately incorrect for the square lattice .",
    "the reason is that , in the limit of a vanishing @xmath171 , but not identically zero , the accidental degeneracy is removed along the two diagonal lines off @xmath67 in the square lattice , as generally expected.@xcite degeneracy can and must be maintained exclusively at @xmath67 , as an isolated singular point , because that is required by the point - group symmetry , @xmath72 , for the square lattice . in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig10 ] ( c ) we show the splitting of the two middle bands everywhere around @xmath67 for a small , but non - vanishing @xmath151 .",
    "the corresponding analytic expression is too cumbersome to be reported here , but it is not essentially different from that reported in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : quarticradicalization ] ) , where we have carried out the proper limit of @xmath171 . therefore , only eq .  ( [ eqn : quarticradicalization ] ) properly corresponds to the correct limiting procedure and band labeling appropriate to the square lattice , insofar as the analysis of second - order non - differentiability and band warping is concerned .",
    "this is also confirmed by examining the posterior rectangular face shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig9 ] , which correspondingly indicates a non - zero warping parameter at the @xmath67-point of the square reciprocal lattice in the limit of @xmath171 , associated with the upper band in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : epm ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ eqn : quarticradicalization ] ) , @xmath165 , which can only have a relative minimum at the singular point of contact with @xmath173 , at @xmath67 .    other complex mechanisms of band warping are possible or can be envisioned .",
    "however , the basic examples that we have analyzed in this paper provide a central understanding and insight about various possibilities and mechanisms of warping , particularly for degenerate bands at symmetry points in reciprocal space , from a fundamental perspective .",
    "we have demonstrated from a fundamental perspective the physical and mathematical origin of  band warping \" in electronic band structures using two fundamental and complementary approaches to their calculation , namely , the tight - binding ( tb ) method and the nearly - free - electron ( nfe ) approximation . we have concluded that for the majority of _ non - degenerate _ bands with energy extrema one should generally expect no band warping , irrespective of whether band non - parabolicity may or may not be prominent .",
    "band warping is typically and ultimately a consequence of the singular onset of a larger symmetry group , allowing the possibility of irreducible representations of higher dimensions at special symmetry points in reciprocal space .    for the sake of illustration of basic principles , we have mainly discussed in this paper results for two fundamental crystal structures , namely , those of two - dimensional primitive - rectangular and square bravais lattices , which can be investigated analytically to a remarkable extent . in fact",
    ", we have further investigated many more complex structures and we have typically found that band - warping and band non - parabolicity features maintain the basic relations and characteristics demonstrated in this paper .    from a mathematical perspective , perhaps the most crucial feature for the appearance of band warping is the cancellation of positive constants under square roots in the process of matrix diagonalization for interacting levels that must become degenerate at isolated critical points in reciprocal space as required by crystal symmetry . that cancellation of constants under square roots eliminates the possibility of a multi - dimensional taylor series expansion at a critical point beyond its zero first - order differential .",
    "we have demonstrated this process at the quadratic level of radicalization with a tb model for a square lattice , and at a quartic level of radicalization within a nfe approximation for the same square lattice .",
    "this analysis , based on multi - dimensional taylor series expansions in rectangular coordinates , is complemented , and in fact resolved , by resorting to one - dimensional _ radial _ taylor series expansions , through a method that involves the determination of a correspondingly more general and applicable concept of angular effective mass .",
    "that allows computation of a band warping parameter , @xmath76 , which provides some measure of how severely an energy surface is forbidden from having smooth curvature or second - order differentiability at an isolated critical point .",
    "we have computed non - zero @xmath76 s to confirm warping of bands becoming degenerate at critical points as required by the square lattice symmetry .    in the process of examining the effects of band non - parabolicity , we have discovered a phenomenon of conical intersections of two @xmath0-type bands that are required to go underneath and reemerge from one another by the global topology of a primitive - rectangular bravais lattice , studied with a fundamental tb model .",
    "its conical intersections have ultimately the same structure as dirac points , extensively studied in graphene and other kinds of topological insulators .",
    "their origin is quite different , however .",
    "the degeneracy of conical intersections at `` strangulated ''",
    "singular points is `` accidental '' in our primitive - rectangular bravais lattice , whereas it is required and `` protected '' by symmetry at dirac points of more complex materials and lattice structures . nevertheless , our conical intersections are quite robust under variation of tb parameters and inclusion of interactions among several shells of bravais - lattice neighbors",
    ". conical intersections of topological origin may thus be more common and less peculiar in two- and three - dimensional structures than currently assumed for dirac and weyl points in topological insulators and semimetals .",
