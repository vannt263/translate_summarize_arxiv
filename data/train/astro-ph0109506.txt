    "given a set of cosmological parameters such as @xmath9 and @xmath10 , @xmath11body simulations of the build  up of the mass function of dark matter halos ( see e.g. jenkins et al , 2000 ) are now sufficiently advanced that there are clear predictions concerning the number of systems of a given mass expected at a given cosmic epoch . at redshifts @xmath12 and beyond ,",
    "however , only a few members of the population of galaxy clusters are known ( e.g. stanford et al . 1997 ; rosati et al .",
    "1999 ; chapman et al .",
    "2000 ; blanton et al .",
    "2000 ; fabian et al .",
    "2001 ) . here",
    "we present the first result of a new technique designed to find distant clusters .    the texox cluster ( toc ) survey is an initiative designed to find massive high - redshift clusters .",
    "the toc survey searches for statistical overdensities of radiosources in the deep , wide area nrao vla sky survey ( nvss ; condon et al .",
    "although any search for clusters using agns as signposts will find only a small fraction of the total population , the surface density of radiosources is sufficiently low , and the sky coverage of the nvss sufficiently large , that this technique is very efficient .",
    "toc selects candidates where the radiosource overdensity is greater than 5-@xmath13 in a @xmath14 arcmin@xmath15 box .",
    "high - resolution vla followup is used to eliminate the small number of cases where the apparent clustering of sources is spurious , and then optical and infrared imaging are carried out to identify the hosts galaxies of the radiosources and other candidate clusters galaxies .    a full description of the first toc results will be presented in a forthcoming paper ( croft et al . in preparation ; hereafter c2001 ) . in this letter",
    "we describe observations of one of the toc candidates , toc  j0233.3 + 3021 .",
    "our particular motivation in these observations was to exploit the sunyaev - zeldovich ( sz , sunyaev and zeldovich 1972 ) effect as a means of confirming candidate high - redshift clusters .    in any cluster of galaxies , electrons in the intracluster plasma scatter",
    "the cmb photons passing through , distorting the thermal spectrum of the incident cmb and producing a change in brightness temperature given by @xmath16 . here",
    "@xmath17 and @xmath18 are the electron number density and temperature , and d@xmath19 is an element of line - of - sight element through the cluster .",
    "two consequences of this are :    * because the cmb imprinting process is a scattering , the same @xmath20 is produced by a given @xmath21 whatever the redshift of the cluster . *",
    "the sz signal from a cluster is less sensitive to mass concentration than either x - ray ( emissivity @xmath22 ) or optical searches .",
    "the integral of @xmath20 over the projected surface of a cluster is proportional to just the mass  temperature product of the gas .",
    "observations of the sz effect in several x - ray selected clusters at @xmath23 have now been made using cm - wave interferometers ( e.g. grego et .",
    "al 2001 , joy et al .",
    "2001 , grainge et al . 2001 ) .",
    "indeed , the sz effect is an ideal tool for conducting a survey for clusters , not only because it allows cluster selection to high redshift , but because the selection is limited only by gas mass , almost independently of redshift .",
    "plans have been developed for a new generation of dedicated sz survey telescopes ( e.g. kneissl et al .",
    "2001 , holder et al .",
    "2000 ) ; however , in the absence of an sz survey , we have undertaken pointed sz observations of a toc candidate to confirm that it is a high-@xmath24 cluster and estimate its mass .",
    "the standard configuration of the ryle telescope ( rt ) for sz observations has described in detail elsewhere ( e.g. grainge et al . 1996 ) .",
    "a nearly - east - west array of five 13-m antennas is used , operating at 15  ghz , giving projected baselines from 13 m to 108 m ( 0.655.4 k@xmath2 ) .",
    "unresolved sources in the telescope field of view  typically radiogalaxies  contribute equal flux to all baselines of the array , whereas the extended structure of any sz signal is typically present only on the shortest baseline .",
    "we therefore use the long baselines to identify and remove point sources from the field , and use the residual flux on the shortest baseline to measure the sz flux decrement .",
    "rt observations of the toc  j0233.3 + 3021 field totalling 280 hours were made during 35 days in the period 1999 january to 1999 june ( the declination of the source means that it can only be observed for 8 hours each day ) .",
    "the telescope was in cb configuration ( grainge et al .",
    "1996 ) , resulting in the aperture - plane coverage shown in fig.[fig : uv_plane ] . in this configuration",
    "the array provides two baselines of maximum projected length 900@xmath2 , three of length 1800@xmath2 , two of 2700@xmath2 and one each of 3600@xmath2 , 4500@xmath2 and 5400@xmath2 .    note that since each day s observation is only eight hours , the baseline tracks in the @xmath25 plane are azimuthally truncated . for each day",
    ", observations of the target field were interleaved with observations of a phase calibrator about every 20 minutes , and a primary flux calibrator ( 3c286 or 3c48 ) was observed at either the start or end of the run .",
    "we analysed the combined 35-day visibility data for evidence of a flux decrement on the shortest baseline .",
    "first , we made and cleaned a naturally - weighted map , using only visibilities from projected baselines longer than 1.5  k@xmath2 , which is shown in fig[fig : nvss_plus_long_baselines ] , with the nvss image of the    toc  j0233.3 + 3021 field overlaid .",
    "several of the nvss sources are readily identifiable on the rt long - baseline map .",
    "next , two of us ( hjb and gc ) independently investigated the sources present in the rt long - baseline map .",
    "we measured the positions of sources in the map using the task maxfit in aips , then subtracted the brightest source from the visibility data using uvsub in aips .",
    "this process was repeated until no sources remained whose peak fluxes were greater than 3.5 times the rms in the map well outside the primary beam .",
    "a list of eight sources was agreed upon ; all but one of these sources is identifiable on the nvss map , as shown in fig[fig : nvss_plus_long_baselines ] .",
    "accurate positions and fluxes for these sources were then calculated using the the fluxfitter algorithm ( grainger et al .",
    "fluxfitter takes input estimates of the point - source fluxes and positions , and varies these to minimize @xmath26-squared between the visibility data and model visibilities containing the point sources and noise ; it has been demonstrated to produce robust flux and position measurements ( grainger et al .",
    "the resulting source positions and fluxes , calculated using all the data from the projected baselines longer than 1.5  k@xmath2 shown in table[table : rt_sources_opt_ir_mags ] .",
    "these sources were then subtracted    [ table : rt_sources_opt_ir_mags ]    [ cols= \" < , < , < , < , < , < , < , < , < \" , ]     from all the visibilites . to check that no residual flux from any of the sources was present ,",
    "source - subtracted maps were made using baselines of length 1.5  k@xmath2 and greater ( shown in fig[fig : long_baselines_source_subtracted ] ) , and 2.0  k@xmath2 and greater .",
    "these maps are both consistent with noise .    finally , a map was made using source - subtracted visibilities with projected baselines in the range 0.651.0  k@xmath2 , corresponding to the single shortest physical baseline .",
    "this map showed a negative feature centred at 02@xmath27 33@xmath28 20.8@xmath29 , 30@xmath30 21@xmath31 58.7@xmath32 ( j2000 ) , and with a minimum flux of in the dirty map of @xmath33jy .",
    "the synthesized beam of this single - baseline map has strong sidelobes , so the rms level on the map even well outside the primary beam is still somewhat affected by the presence of the negative feature at the centre of the map .",
    "we therefore made a very large map ( 2048 @xmath34 2048 5@xmath32-square pixels ) and measured the map rms in 128-pixel square regions where the map apppeared by eye to be unaffected by sidelobes from the central source .",
    "the rms levels agreed wth the expected noise , due to the telescope system temperature , of 95 @xmath35jy .",
    "the short - baseline map was cleaned to a flux limit of @xmath36jy , and this map is presented in fig.[fig : short_baselines_source_subtracted ] .",
    "on inspection of the azimuthally - averaged    visibilities ( fig.[fig : azimuthal_average_plot ] ) , the flux on the shortest baseline is @xmath37jy , with an rms of 170 @xmath38jy ( note that since the shortest baseline has an elliptical track in the aperture plane , this rms includes the variation in the amplitude of the sz signal as a function of @xmath25 distance ) .",
    "we obtained @xmath39-band imaging of the toc  j0233.3 + 3021 field using the imaging grism instrument on the mcdonald observatory 2.7-m smith reflector in 1998 october , 1999 october , and 2000 september , and @xmath40-band imaging of the field at the calar alto 3.5-m telescope in 1999 august .",
    "additionally , we obtained several @xmath41-band images of the toc  j0233.3 + 3021 field with ufti at ukirt in 2000 july .",
    "full details , and extensive discussion of other candidate cluster galaxies , will be presented in c2001 . using these images , in combination with high - resolution vla imaging ( c2001 ) ,",
    "we have identified the host galaxies of the central five nvss radiosources shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : nvss_plus_long_baselines ] . for four of these galaxies ,",
    "we have obtained 3.5@xmath42-diameter aperture magnitudes in all filters ; for the fifth galaxy , only @xmath39 and @xmath40 magnitudes are available .",
    "the measured magnitudes of the galaxies are presented in table [ table : rt_sources_opt_ir_mags ] along with the positions of the host galaxy identifications .",
    "the positions were measured from the @xmath39-band image , with an astrometric solution using the positions of stars measured in the cambridge apm survey .",
    "the magnitudes of the galaxies are all roughly @xmath5 , @xmath4 , @xmath43 .    in 2000",
    "january , we attempted spectroscopy of the radiogalaxies with isis on the wht .",
    "we used a 2-arcsec slit , with sensitivity on the isis red arm up to 9340  .",
    "we took 1800-second spectra of a ( at pa=118 , the axis of its double structure ; see c2001 ) , galaxies b & c ( as a pair with pa=113 ) , and galaxies d & e ( as a pair with pa=77 ) .",
    "faint red continuum was detected spectroscopically in all the cases expected ( i.e. the 4 brightest ) , but no emission lines were evident .",
    "the optical and infrared magnitudes of the radiogalaxies immediately imply that they lie at significant redshift . in particular , given the @xmath41-band hubble diagram for faint radiosources ( such as the 7c sample of willott , rawlings and blundell , 2001 )",
    ", the @xmath5 magnitudes of the toc  j0233.3 + 3021 radiogalaxies suggest that they are @xmath44 galaxies at redshifts of @xmath45 .",
    "we next consider the @xmath46 colours of the radiogalaxies .",
    "it is now well - established that faint radiogalaxies at @xmath8 are hosted by extremely red objects ( eros ) with colours as red as @xmath47 .",
    "( e.g. dunlop et al .",
    "1996 ; willott , rawlings and blundell , 2001 ) .",
    "this is consistent with a picure in which faint radiosources at these redshifts are hosted by old elliptical galaxies . comparing the the radiogalaxies with galaxies in the @xmath48 cluster clg  j0848 + 4453 found by stanford et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , we find a close similarity in @xmath46 colour - magnitude diagrams ( fig .",
    "[ fig : rjk_colmag_plot ] ) .",
    "if we plot the @xmath46 colours of the radiogalaxies against the track of a redshifted e0 galaxy , we find that they cluster about the @xmath12 region on colour - colour space ( fig .",
    "[ fig : rjk_colcol_plot ] ) .",
    "lastly , the faint red continuum detected in the optical spectra of the radiogalaxies is also consistent with their lying at @xmath12 .    these optical and infrared data",
    "do not alone demonstrate unequivocally that this overdensity of radiogalaxies is a real cluster .",
    "however , the coincidence between the overdensity of sources and the cmb decrement leads us to conclude that we are seeing the sz effect of a massive cluster , and that most , if not all , the radiogalaxies are cluster members .      from the sz flux on the shortest spacing , we can now estimate the gas mass of the cluster .",
    "we used profile ( grainge et al .",
    "2001b ) to model the cluster as a spherical king - profile gas distribution , with a gas temperature of 7kev , @xmath49-parameter 0.65 , and find the best fit value of the central electron density ( @xmath50 ) to the data for varying core radius @xmath51 . while the temperature and @xmath49 parameter are unknown in the absence of deep x - ray imaging , the values we assume are typical of those which have been been measured in x - ray selected @xmath52 clusters ( see , e.g. , grego et al .",
    "2001 for a summary ) . for an @xmath53 , @xmath54 cosmology , with @xmath55kms@xmath56mpc@xmath56 , we find that the gas mass within a radius of 1  mpc is proportional to @xmath57 .",
    "we place the constraint @xmath58 from our measurement that the flux on the second shortest rt baseline is less than 200  @xmath35jy .",
    "this core radius corresponds to a physical distance of 178  kpc and the appropriate best fit model has @xmath59 and a central decrement of @xmath7k .",
    "we therefore estimate that the minimum gas mass of the cluster is @xmath60 . assuming that the total mass of the cluster is ten times greater than this , toc  j0233.3 + 3021 is clearly a massive cluster similar to those identified at @xmath61 in x - ray surveys such as emss .",
    "the accurate measurement of the properties of this population of high-@xmath24 massive clusters is a significant goal in observational cosmology . in this letter",
    ", we have demonstrated that current sz observations are effective in confirming high-@xmath24 cluster candidates which have been selected by other means ; sz investigations of other toc candidates are continuing . the new generation of sz survey telescopes will not be restricted to the use of ` signposts ' to high-@xmath24 clusters , and promise to detect the majority of the distant cluster population .",
    "we have observed the field of toc  j0233.3 + 3021 , a cluster of millijansky radiosources selected from the nrao vla sky survey ( nvss ) , with the ryle telescope ( rt ) at 15 ghz , and in the optical and near - infrared with the mcdonald 2.7-m , calar alto 3.5-m , and ukirt .",
    "our conclusions are as follows :    1 .",
    "after subtraction of the baseline - independent fluxes of the radiosources , we find a seven - sigma decrement on the rt shortest baseline of @xmath62 @xmath35jy .",
    "the radiosource host galaxies have magnitudes of @xmath5 , @xmath4 , @xmath3 . from the infrared magnitude - redshift relation for radiosources",
    ", the galaxies must lie at @xmath63 .",
    "the similar @xmath46 colours strongly suggest that these galaxies are evolved ellipticals at @xmath64 , and the galaxy magnitudes are consistent with the @xmath65 colour - magnitude diagrams of known @xmath66 clusters .",
    "we therefore conclude that we have identified a strong sz decrement with a cluster of galaxies at @xmath8 . to produce the sz decrement , the cluster must have a mass - temperature product similar to that of massive abell clusters at low redshift ; we estimate a minumum gas mass of @xmath60 .",
    "these observations support the growing evidence for a population of massive clusters at @xmath66 .",
    "these observations demonstrate the effectiveness of combining searches for agn ` signposts ' to clusters with the redshift - independence of the sz effect .",
