    "electrons confined in one - dimensional ( 1d ) systems exhibit peculiar non - fermi liquid properties , that are by now rather well understood .",
    "@xcite let us just briefly mention some of them which will be useful for what follows .",
    "due to phase - space limitations , particle - hole excitations in single - band 1d models are exhausted by collective charge and spin modes , which are dynamically independent , realizing what is commonly referred to as _ spin - charge separation_. when these modes are gapless , they propagate as acoustic waves ( zero - sounds ) , hence can be identified by two parameters , the sound velocity @xmath2 and a dimensionless stiffness @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 for charge and spin modes , respectively .",
    "sometimes however the interaction opens a gap either in one of these sectors , for instance the charge sector in the hubbard model at half - filling , or in both of them , like in a spontaneously dimerized chain .    besides spin - charge separation , another manifestation of the",
    "1d non - fermi liquid behavior is the power - law decay with anomalous exponents of all correlation functions , when both spin and charge modes are gapless , or just some of them , when one of the two modes is gapped .",
    "although these exponents are generically non universal , they all can be expressed in terms of the above mentioned @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "therefore the finite set of parameters @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 is sufficient to characterize completely the asymptotic low - energy behavior of 1d interacting electron models , similarly to the finite number of parameters which identify the low - energy behavior of landau - fermi liquids in higher dimensions .",
    "@xcite indeed , just in analogy with fermi liquids , this kind of 1d universal behavior was named `` luttinger liquid '' by haldane .",
    "@xcite    in the case of non interacting electrons @xmath10 .",
    "if spin su(2 ) symmetry is unbroken and the spin modes are gapless , @xmath7 remains one as for free fermions even in the presence of interaction and only @xmath6 parametrizes the anomalous exponents .",
    "in particular @xmath6 is smaller than one for repulsive interaction , and greater than one otherwise .",
    "when both charge and spin sectors are gapless , the asymptotic expressions of the charge and spin equal - time correlation functions are , apart from possible logarithmic corrections , @xmath11 where @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the charge and spin density operators at position @xmath14 , @xmath15 is the fermi momentum , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 are model - dependent constants .",
    "analogously the singlet ( and triplet ) pairing correlations behave as @xmath19 where @xmath20 creates a singlet ( or triplet ) pair at position @xmath14 . finally ,",
    "the non - fermi liquid character of 1d interacting models shows up transparently in the momentum distribution function near the fermi momentum : @xmath21 where @xmath22 is again expressed in terms of @xmath6 through the relation @xmath23 .",
    "for any finite interaction @xmath24 , hence the momentum distribution function has a power - law singularity at the fermi level , in contrast to the finite jump characteristic of fermi liquids .",
    "it is worth mentioning that , for non - frustrated models with repulsive interaction , the insulating phase at half - filling is characterized by all correlation functions decaying exponentially to zero apart from the spin - spin ones , which still decay as a power - law , formally like in  ( [ ss ] ) with @xmath25 .",
    "the actual value of the parameter @xmath6 depends upon the particular microscopic model , through the form and the strength of the interaction as well as the electron doping . for simple hamiltonians",
    "@xmath6 can be explicitly calculated by the bethe ansatz  @xcite or by exact diagonalization on small systems .",
    "@xcite    although analytical techniques , especially bosonization  @xcite , give important insights into the low - energy properties of 1d systems , both in gapless and in gapped phases , yet they do not provide a simple representation of the ground - state wave function ( wf ) . even in those simple models which are solvable by bethe ansatz , the actual ground state wf turns out to be very difficult to interpret and to deal with . in the hubbard model , for instance , the ground state wf",
    "is very involved within the bethe ansatz formalism and only in the strong - coupling limit it is possible to obtain significant simplifications because of the explicit factorization of the wf into a charge and a spin part .",
    "@xcite for this reason there have been many attempts aimed to find out approximate variational wfs , which , from one side , could correctly reproduce the peculiar properties of 1d systems but , from the other side , could also give a transparent interpretation of their physical properties .",
    "@xcite for instance it has been shown that the strong - coupling limit of the hubbard model , where the on - site coulomb repulsion @xmath26 prohibits doubly occupied sites , is well described by a projected slater determinant .",
    "@xcite in particular the large-@xmath26 conducting phase at finite hole doping has been found to be properly represented through a fully - projected gutzwiller wf supplemented by a long - range density - density jastrow factor .",
    "the latter is a crucial ingredient which allows to recover the anomalous power - law behavior of the correlation functions .",
    "indeed any short - range jastrow factor can not reproduce the correct luttinger - liquid behavior since it is unable to affect the low - energy physics .",
    "for instance , it is well known that the simple gutzwiller wf has a finite jump in the momentum distribution function ,  @xcite which is certainly incorrect in 1d .    in this paper",
    "we generalize this approach to a finite coulomb repulsion @xmath26 , namely to the case where charge fluctuations are still allowed .",
    "we show that even at finite @xmath26 it is possible to design a consistent wf , which can faithfully describe the evolution from the luttinger - liquid behavior at finite hole doping to the mott insulating phase at half - filling .",
    "again the crucial ingredient turns out to be a density - density jastrow factor applied to a simple slater determinant .",
    "more specifically , we apply this variational wf to analyze the single - band hubbard model .",
    "thanks to the recent improvements in the energy minimization schemes for correlated wfs ,  @xcite the long - range tail of the jastrow factor can be determined very accurately , without imposing any parametric form , even if the change of its tail may contribute to a very tiny energy gain .",
    "we will show that the low - energy properties of the hubbard model are correctly reproduced within this unbiased variational approach .",
    "the paper is organized as follow : in sec .",
    "[ model ] we introduce the model and the physical quantities we are interested in and in sec .",
    "[ result ] we present and discuss the results .",
    "as we previously mentioned , in this work we aim to design a variational wf which is equally accurate for both weak and strong coulomb repulsion . for sake of simplicity , we will test the quality of this wf in the well - known single - band hubbard model on a finite chain with @xmath27 sites , @xmath28 particles and periodic boundary conditions .",
    "the hamiltonian is @xmath29 where we use the standard notations in which @xmath30 ( @xmath31 ) destroys ( creates ) an electron with spin @xmath32 at the site @xmath33 and @xmath34 .     the value of @xmath35 from eq .",

    "( [ rpa2 ] ) .",
    "inset : zoom around @xmath39 . ]",
    "the variational ansatz for the ground state wf is @xmath40 where @xmath41 is a jastrow factor and @xmath42 an uncorrelated slater determinant , that , for simplicity , we assume to be the @xmath28-electron fermi sea of the tight - binding model with dispersion @xmath43 . since spin su(2 ) is unbroken , there is no need to introduce a spin - spin jastrow factor , because a free - electron determinant already provides the correct value @xmath44 .",
    "therefore , in order to preserve all the symmetries of the hamiltonian , @xmath45 is a purely density - density correlator written in term of the density operator @xmath46 as @xmath47,\\ ] ] where , due to translation and inversion symmetry , @xmath48 can be described by using @xmath49 independent variational parameters @xmath50 ; in particular , @xmath51 can be set to zero since , due to the conservation of the total number of particles , @xmath52 provides only an irrelevant normalization factor in the wf .",
    "a more sophisticated possibility would have been to choose @xmath42 as the ground state of a mean - field bcs hamiltonian projected onto a fixed number of particles . for the simple hubbard model of eq .",
    "( [ hamiltonian ] ) , the latter ansatz leads to a slightly lower energy , without modifying the low - energy properties , and , therefore , it will not be considered in the following .",
    "it should be mentioned , however , that in presence of a large next - nearest - neighbor hopping term , a gap in the bcs mean field hamiltonian may open , leading to translational symmetry breaking at half - filling or to a phase of singlet pairs with dominant superconducting correlations at finite doping .",

    "lines are power - law fits . ]",
    "the important role of the jastrow factor has been already discussed by hellberg and mele in the context of the 1d @xmath0 model .",
    "@xcite in this case , it is possible to show analytically that the momentum distribution function of the variational wf has an algebraic singularity at @xmath15 , with an exponent related to the strength of the jastrow factor .",
    "@xcite recently , we have shown  @xcite that in the 1d hubbard model a suitable long - range jastrow can also drive a metallic slater determinant into an insulating phase and that , in the limit of small momenta , the fourier transform of the jastrow parameters @xmath70 are related to the charge - structure factor . in particular , in the conducting regime and and for small momenta a random - phase - approximation ( rpa ) expression holds :  @xcite @xmath71 where we indicate with @xmath72 the charge structure factor of the wf without @xmath41 . for a conducting slater determinant , like the free - electron state , @xmath73 for small @xmath1 . for a non - vanishing hole doping @xmath74 and interaction @xmath36 , by optimizing the variational wf , we obtain that the jastrow factor is singular , i.e. , @xmath75 .",
    "this fact is crucial to recover the correct low-@xmath1 behavior of @xmath54 , whose linear slope is renormalized by the interaction , leading to @xmath76 . therefore",
    ", the jastrow factor has to be intrinsically long - range . according to the rpa expression  ( [ rpa ] )",
    ", a more singular jastrow term @xmath77 is needed to bring the system into the insulating phase at half - filling .",
    "@xcite in 1d , such a jastrow factor leads to a confined phase , where perturbation theory does not apply , and , therefore , also the rpa is expected to fail .",
    "nonetheless , it turns out that , also within the insulating phase , the small-@xmath1 behavior of @xmath78 is qualitatively reproduced by eq .",
    "( [ rpa ] ) and a more accurate empirical expression is given by : @xmath79 where @xmath80 is a constant that strongly depends upon the electronic interaction . in fig .",

    "( [ rpa ] ) . in the half - filled insulating phase , although for @xmath82 we have that @xmath83 , the coefficient of the quadratic term is not simply related to the jastrow factor . in this case , it is important to emphasize that the presence of the singular jastrow factor @xmath77 determines a qualitative change of the static structure factor @xmath78 even at large momenta @xmath84 .",
    "in fact , the charge structure factor @xmath85 for the free fermi gas is characterized by a cusp at @xmath86 , which is responsible of the well - known friedel oscillations in a metal and the rpa expression can not remove this feature . on the other hand , a true insulating phase does not possess this singularity and , indeed , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , the charge structure factor @xmath78 for the wf containing a singular jastrow factor shows a smooth behavior around @xmath87 .",

    "the linear slope of @xmath54 is renormalized with respect to the non - interacting value , leading to @xmath76 . on the other hand ,",
    "the small-@xmath1 behavior of @xmath56 is not affected by the interaction and we have that @xmath89 .",
    "notice that , in the presence of a strong interaction , the two singularities at @xmath90 and @xmath91 are clearly visible in @xmath54 , whereas in @xmath56 , only the singularity at @xmath90 can be detected . from the small-@xmath1 linear part of @xmath54 , it is possible to extract the value of @xmath6 ( see table  [ tab1 ] ) , which is in very good agreement with the exact one .",
    "@xcite it is important to emphasize that the relationships among exponents of different correlation functions are correctly reproduced by our variational wf .",
    "indeed , we can compare the value of the exponent @xmath22 found from a direct evaluation of the quasiparticle weight  ( [ zeta ] ) at @xmath92 , i.e. , @xmath93 ( see fig .  [ fig4 ] ) , with the one obtained with @xmath94 by using the value of @xmath6 extracted from the linear slope of @xmath54 .",
    "as reported in table  [ tab1 ] , we obtain an excellent agreement for the values of the interaction @xmath36 considered . finally , we can also calculate the singlet pairing correlations @xmath95 creates a singlet pair of electrons at nearest neighbors . in order to calculate the exponent @xmath96 related to the decay of @xmath97 , we consider the pairing correlation at the maximum distance @xmath88 for different sizes , see fig .  [ fig5 ] . in this case",
    ", the signal is very small and a precise determination of the critical exponent is quite difficult . nonetheless , the results reported in table  [ tab1 ] are rather satisfactory and not too far from the ones obtained with the exact relation @xmath98 .",
    "@xcite    .[tab1 ] critical exponents for the 1d hubbard model at quarter - filling : @xmath6 is found from the low-@xmath1 behavior of @xmath54 , @xmath99 , and @xmath22 is found by fitting @xmath68 with @xmath93 .",

[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      let us now consider how the insulating case is reached by decreasing the hole concentration .",
    "first of all , it should be mentioned that , not too close to the insulating phase at half - filling , the charge and spin structure factor have small size effects and , therefore , reliable calculations are possible even without using too large @xmath27 . as an example",
    ", we report in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] ( right panel ) , the case of doping @xmath102 , where we can see that there are no appreciable differences in @xmath54 from @xmath103 to @xmath104 .    in the doped region ,",
    "the system is always conducting , @xmath54 having a linear behavior for small momenta , with a slope that depends upon @xmath36 and @xmath74 .",
    "for sufficiently small hole doping , it turns out that the linear regime is limited to a small window around @xmath105 , whereas for larger momenta , @xmath54 acquires a finite curvature , see fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] ( left panel ) .",
    "the two different regimes are separated by the singularity at @xmath106 , and , therefore , by decreasing @xmath74 , the width of the linear regime shrinks , the slope being almost constant .",
    "therefore , we arrive at the empirical result : @xmath107 where @xmath108 , @xmath109 indicates the heaviside step function and @xmath110 is a constant determined by imposing continuity of @xmath54 at @xmath111 .",
    "this singular behavior , with the kink at @xmath111 , is entirely due to correlation and it is compatible with the exact result that @xmath6 remains finite , more precisely @xmath112 , for @xmath113 .",
    "@xcite it is important to stress that , by approaching half - filling , the width of the linear regime shrinks with doping and reduces to zero for @xmath113 .",

    "lines connect the points inset : the quantity @xmath115 ( see text ) as a function of @xmath27 for half - filling and one hole .",
    "lines are fits of the data . ]    for completeness , we report in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] the form of the jastrow factor at half - filling and for small concentration of holes considered in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] . starting from the insulating phase , upon doping , @xmath70 moves away from @xmath77 , and becomes less singular , i.e. , @xmath75 .",
    "clearly , at very small doping , the size effects affect the small-@xmath1 part , and , in particular , for the smallest momentum we can have some deviations from the expected @xmath75 behavior .",
    "the correct minimization of the jastrow factor is particularly important for having an accurate description of @xmath68 , especially when approaching half - filling .",
    "indeed , in this case , the jastrow factor for one hole is considerably different from the insulating one for small @xmath1",
    "s ( see fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] ) , and one has to optimize both wfs with @xmath28 and @xmath64 particles .",
    "@xcite this difference can be appreciated by considering @xmath115 , which diverges linearly with the system size @xmath27 if @xmath77 and , instead , diverges only logarithmically if @xmath116 . in fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] , we report @xmath117 as a function of @xmath27 for the insulating state and for the one - hole case : the difference between the two cases clearly demonstrates the different behavior of @xmath70 for small momenta . by a careful minimization of both the wfs , it is possible to recover the result that @xmath118 independently of @xmath36 .",
    "@xcite indeed , upon increasing @xmath36 , our variational wf gives a rather accurate description of the insulating phase , the size effects being strongly reduced due to the small correlation length expected at large @xmath36 . in this limit",
    ", we obtain a reasonable good agreement with the exact exponent for the quasiparticle weight ( see fig .  [ fig9 ] ) : @xmath119 and @xmath120 for @xmath38 and @xmath114 , respectively . on the other hand",
    ", it should be mentioned that a naive calculation with a singular jastrow @xmath77 for both wfs would lead to a wrong exponential behavior of the quasiparticle weight .      in conclusion , we have shown that an accurate description of the charge and spin properties of the 1d hubbard model is possible within the simple variational ansatz given by eq .",
    "( [ wf ] ) .",
    "the main ingredient of the variational wf is represented by a singular density - density jastrow factor , whose long - range part determines the low - energy behavior of the correlation functions and can be found by optimization of the energy . in the conducting regime ,",
    "the small-@xmath1 fourier transform of the density - density jastrow term diverges like @xmath75 , implying the correct renormalization of the charge structure factor for small momenta , i.e. , @xmath122 . by approaching the insulating phase and by decreasing the hole doping",
    ", the jastrow factor modifies its small-@xmath1 part and , eventually , it acquires a more singular behavior like @xmath77 . within this context , it is possible to obtain a consistent scenario , where we recover the correct relationships among the exponents of different physical quantities .",
    "obviously , our approach works due to the quality of the variational ansatz in 1d .",
    "despite the difficulty to define very accurate wfs in higher spatial dimensions , the possibility to obtain the correct low - energy description of a hamiltonian by using a simple optimization of the energy is very appealing and work is in progress for the generalization of this ansatz to two - dimensional systems , where no exact solutions are available .    we acknowledge the constant and fruitful interaction with e. tosatti , who gave us an important contribution to our work .",
