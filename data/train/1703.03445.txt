    "an interesting extension of the standard model ( sm ) proposed by manohar and wise @xcite consists of adding a color - octet electroweak doublet scalar .",
    "the original motivation for this extension is that it consists of one of two scalar representations allowed by minimal flavor violation for scalars that do not transform under the flavor group . from this perspective",
    "the most general renormalizable potential consistent with this field content is constructed resulting in generic studies for tev scale color octet scalars .",
    "scalars such as these occur in specific models , for example in unification with @xmath4 @xcite or with @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "the model has interesting phenomenology and many studies have been performed in the literature @xcite . a salient feature of the mw model being that it is very difficult to observe or exclude the new scalars at the lhc .",
    "the model has a very large parameter space , but these studies have shown that it is possible to constrain it significantly by imposing custodial symmetry , partial wave unitarity and vacuum stability .    along these lines , we have recently proposed considering the mw extension in the context of a two higgs doublet model ( 2hdm ) . in ref .",
    "@xcite we introduced the model and constrained its parameter space by imposing tree level theoretical constraints arising from symmetries and from perturbative unitarity .",
    "in addition we briefly discussed lhc phenomenology , concluding that the largest effects from this addition to the 2hdm would appear in corrections to one - loop couplings of the higgs boson to two gluons or photons .",
    "previous studies of the mw model @xcite and of the 2hdm @xcite indicate that the viable parameter space is further constrained when one includes renormalization group corrections , and in this paper we apply this rationale to the mw extension of the 2hdm .",
    "we first compute the beta functions for the couplings of the model .",
    "we then consider the requirements that there be no landau poles ( lp ) below a certain high mass scale @xmath6 , that the scalar potential remains stable and that two - to - two scattering amplitudes remain perturbative at all scales below @xmath6 .",
    "these conditions have a long history of being used as theoretical constraints from their early application to the sm higgs boson mass @xcite .",
    "the construction of the model was described in ref .",
    "the scalar sector of the sm is replaced by three @xmath7 scalar doublets : two color singlets ( @xmath8 and one color - octet @xmath9 . the most general renormalizable potential for the 2hdm sector ( @xmath8 is well known from the literature @xcite and we restrict ourselves to the case of a cp conserving potential with a discrete symmetry @xmath10 that is only violated softly ( although in the end we replace this with the requirement of mfv ) . to this known potential",

    "we now turn to the novel aspect of this paper : investigating the consequences of requiring the model to be valid up to some high energy scale .",
    "the procedure is straightforward , we first derive the corresponding renormalization group equations ( rge ) for all the parameters in the model , a result we present in the appendix . for our numerical analysis",
    "we restrict ourselves to the case with custodial symmetry and no cp violation , which reduces the rge to the following ,    @xmath32    in these equations @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 are the @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 couplings of the sm , @xmath39 is the top - quark yukawa coupling and we use the standard definition @xmath40 .",
    "these equations have been checked against the known limits : the 2hdm @xcite ; the mw model @xcite .",
