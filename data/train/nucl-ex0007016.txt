    "in ultra - relativistic nuclear collisions the colliding nuclear matter emerges with a pattern that has its origin in the incompressibility of nuclear matter and the mean field effects .",
    "the observation of collective behaviour in the system validates the use of a hydrodynamic description of the evolution of the collision . within the hydrodynamic model the collective motion results from pressure gradient in the matter , which depends upon the compressibility of the underlying equation of state @xcite . in the case of a phase transition from hadronic matter to quark gluon plasma ,",
    "increased number of degrees of freedom may lead to a softening of the equation of state @xcite .",
    "collective flow manifests in altered event shapes which can be studied by measuring the momentum distributions of produced particles .",
    "the azimuthal distribution of these event shapes are studied using coefficients in their fourier expansion .",
    "one of the major current aims of the study of ultra - relativistic heavy ion experiments is to determine the magnitude of anisotropy present in the final state momentum distributions of various particle species , in different regions of phase space .",
    "the systematic dependence of this anisotropy on energy , centrality and other collision parameters is predicted to be sensitive to the equation of state @xcite .",
    "most of the experimental studies on azimuthal anisotropy have been restricted to charged particles ( a large number of results for charged particle measurements can be found in the review article @xcite ) .",
    "the measured anisotropy of charged particles includes effect due to final state coulomb interactions and may inhibit a direct comparison of results with the predictions of strong interaction physics",
    ".    measurements of anisotropy in the azimuthal distribution of photons have been reported recently @xcite . since almost 90% of photons produced in ultra - relativistic nuclear collisions",
    "originate from the decay of @xmath0 , the anisotropy measured in photons should have their origin in the anisotropy of @xmath0 produced in the reaction .",
    "however , the measured anisotropy in photons will also include some effect due to decay .",
    "the decay introduces non - flow correlations amongst kinematic variables of photons due to four - momentum conservation and also dilutes the existing correlation in azimuthal angles .",
    "determination of the effect of decay should enable deduction of the anisotropy in @xmath0 . this would complement the study of flow using charged particles and",
    "would be free from coulomb effects .",
    "such a determination will provide much needed additional information to characterise the final state momentum distributions @xcite .",
    "a comparison of the anisotropies deduced from charged and neutral pions would help in estimating the effect of final state coulomb interaction on the charged particles .    in the present work we study the effect of @xmath0 decay on the observed anisotropy of photons for various assumed flow parameters and multiplicities using a fast simulation technique .",
    "preliminary results can be found in @xcite .",
    "we show how the anisotropy parameter for the parent @xmath0 distribution can be deduced using the measured anisotropy in the azimuthal distribution of photons .",
    "a complete determination of the flow parameters in different regions would require a measurement of the three - dimensional momentum distribution of all the particles .",
    "several experiments determine the anisotropy parameters in azimuthal angle distributions ( @xmath1 ) of produced particles .",
    "@xcite . in the present work we restrict ourselves to the study of photon multiplicity in a detector having full azimuthal acceptance in one unit of pseudo - rapidity suitably chosen with practical detectors in mind @xcite .",
    "we generate events having azimuthally anisotropic shapes and analyse them using methods employed for the analysis of experimental data .",
    "let us assume that the event shape in the azimuthal plane can be described by an arbitrary ellipse .",
    "the most general equation of an ellipse in polar coordinates is @xmath2 \\label{aniso}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath3 and @xmath4 define the direction of the shift of the centroid of the ellipse from the origin and the orientation of the major axis of the ellipse respectively .",

    "is generated .",
    "the particle multiplicity in the event is selected in such a way that the multiplicities of charged particles ( @xmath7 ) and decay photons within the one unit of pseudo - rapidity acceptance of the given detector are in the range of 100 to 4000 .",
    "such a wide range of multiplicity corresponds to varying centralities encompassing the sps , rhic and lhc energies and serves to determine the effect of fluctuations due to finite number of particles .",
    "the multiplicity distribution of particles is assumed to be gaussian with a width @xmath8 for a mean multiplicity m. we assume the azimuthal distributions to have initial flow components @xmath9 , where @xmath10 ( = 1,2 ) denotes the order of flow . using these values ,",
    "the azimuthal angles of the charged and neutral pions are assigned according to the distribution given by eqn .",
    "( [ aniso ] ) .",
    "@xmath3 is chosen randomly .",
    "for the present work we have chosen @xmath4 = @xmath3 , which corresponds to the major axis of the ellipse along the direction of the shift of the centroid .",
    "physically this represents in - plane flow .",
    "the data are also generated for different values of @xmath11 and @xmath12 , corresponding to different initial flow .",
    "the pseudo - rapidity and @xmath13-distributions are taken from a parametrised form of the hijing event generator @xcite at the relevant energy .",
    "neutral pions are generated in the pseudo - rapidity interval extending to 1.5 units on both sides of the assumed acceptance of the detector .",
    "these are allowed to decay and the @xmath14 , @xmath13 and @xmath15 of the photons are obtained .",
    "the photons falling within the acceptance region of the detector are used for further analysis .",
    "the set of events thus generated is analysed to extract the anisotropy parameters @xmath16 using the fourier expansion technique in a manner identical to the analysis of experimental data .",
    "the present analysis is based on 10000 events for each combination of multiplicity and anisotropy .",
    "the generated data have been analysed to obtain the following :    1 .",
    "@xmath17 : the estimated direction of the first order event plane . because of finite particle multiplicity the estimated event plane @xmath17 in the generated data fluctuates about the actual event plane , @xmath3 , with a spread that depends on the initial anisotropy and the multiplicity .",
    "@xmath18 = @xmath19 : a measure of the directed flow in the direction of @xmath20 , where the average is over all particles of all events . 3 .",
    "@xmath21 : the estimated direction of second order event plane .",
    "this also fluctuates about the actual direction @xmath4 .",
    "@xmath22 = @xmath23 : a measure of the ellipticity about @xmath21 where the average is over all particles of all the events .",
    "this is a measure of the difference of the major axis and the minor axis of the event shape .    since the estimated event plane differs from the actual event plane , the values of @xmath24 are systematically lower by a factor @xmath25 , where the average is over all events for a particular sample .",
    "this factor is the resolution correction factor ( rcf ) .",
    "the values @xmath16 that represent the magnitude of directed ( @xmath10 = 1 ) and elliptic ( @xmath10 = 2 ) flow , for the sample of events , are obtained by @xmath24/rcf .",
    "experimentally , rcf is obtained using the subevent method described in @xcite . here",
    "every event is divided randomly into two subevents of equal multiplicity and the angle @xmath26 is determined for each subevent .",
    "this enables a determination of a parameter @xmath27 directly from the experimental data using the relation @xcite : @xmath28 where @xmath29 denotes the total number of events , @xmath30 , @xmath31 are the estimated angles of the two subevents ( labelled @xmath32 and @xmath33 ) and the numerator on the left denotes the number of events having the angle between subevents greater than @xmath34 .",
    "the parameter @xmath27 is then used to determine rcf according to the relation given in the ref .",
    "@xcite .    the generated azimuthal distribution of the charged pions are also analysed in a manner similar to the azimuthal distribution of photons .",
    "comparing the results of charged particles and photons enables a determination of the effect of decay .",

    "the analysis technique correctly reproduces the initial anisotropy for all multiplicities for both directed and elliptic flow , demonstrating the validity of the technique used . for lower multiplicities the errors on the estimated values are larger due to greater fluctuations .    the same analysis technique , when applied to photons , yields values of @xmath16 that are generally different from the initial anisotropy present in the @xmath0 distribution .",
    "this difference in the anisotropy values for photons and @xmath0 is attributed to two effects of decay : ( i ) it dilutes the initial flow by randomising the existing azimuthal correlation , and ( ii ) it mimics flow , the correlations due to momentum conservation producing an anisotropy in the final state distributions .    to estimate the effect of momentum conservation correlation we generated azimuthally symmetric distributions , corresponding to @xmath9=0 .",
    "the decay photons falling within the acceptance of the detector were analysed , and the values of @xmath16 obtained for them are also shown in fig .",

    "one observes that the deduced anisotropy in photons is always non - zero . at low multiplicities",
    "the values can be as high as those observed in charged particle measurements @xcite .",
    "the values for elliptic flow are systematically lower than for directed flow , implying lesser effect of momentum conservation correlation on the elliptic event shape .    for all values of initial anisotropy",
    ", the estimated anisotropy in photons decreases with increasing multiplicity . at low multiplicity",
    "the correlation due to momentum conservation competes with dilution due to decay .",
    "the relative importance depends on the initial anisotropy in neutral pions . for low anisotropy in @xmath0 ,",
    "this leads to enhanced anisotropy in photons .",
    "the above results hold for both orders of flow .",
    "it is seen that the decay dilutes the elliptic flow more than it dilutes directed flow .      while the effect of decay is seen to depend on the values of multiplicity and the amount of initial flow , the ratio of anisotropy observed in photon distributions , @xmath35 , to that in the parent @xmath0 distribution , @xmath36 ,",
    "is seen to scale with the parameter @xmath27 .",
    "[ flow_scale ] shows this ratio as a function of @xmath27 for a large combination of values of anisotropy and multiplicity .",

[ flow_scale ]",
    "show the fitted functions for both directed and elliptic flow .",
    "the values of the constants for different values of @xmath10 are given in table  [ fit ] .",
    "the values of @xmath33 reflect the lower limit of @xmath39 upto which the anisotropy in @xmath0 can be deduced by this method . the lower value of @xmath33 for @xmath10=2 implies that elliptic flow in neutral pions can be studied for lower anisotropy and multiplicity .",
    "@xmath40 is the limiting value of the fractional anisotropy remaining in photons .",

    ", we simulated another data set with @xmath9 = 0.02 and @xmath9 = 0.04 and for a range of multiplicities varying between 250 and 3000 .",
    "this data set was analysed as earlier and the value of anisotropy in neutral pions was estimated using the scaling relation .",
