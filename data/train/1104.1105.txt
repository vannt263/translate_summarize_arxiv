    "quantum phase transitions ( qpts ) theoretically occur at absolute zero temperature @xmath1 due to abrupt changes in the qualitative properties of the ground - state of a many - body system while varying its hamiltonian @xcite .",
    "the tuning parameter ( the quantity being changed in the hamiltonian ) can be , for example , an external magnetic field or a coupling constant . by properly tuning the hamiltonian",
    "one can reach a special point , the critical point ( cp ) , where the ground state of the system undergoes a radical change , which strongly affects the macroscopic properties of the system . in the vicinity of a cp , a tiny change in the tuning parameter will favor one phase over the other . since at @xmath2 there are no thermal fluctuations , these tiny changes are caused only by quantum fluctuations , whose origin can be traced back to the heisenberg uncertainty principle .",
    "some well - known examples of qpts are the paramagnetic - ferromagnetic transition in some metals @xcite , the superconductor - insulator transition @xcite , and superfluid - mott insulator transition @xcite .",
    "although reaching the absolute zero is impossible since it would violate the third law of thermodynamics , qpts can be detected if one reaches temperatures near the absolute zero .",
    "more precisely , when the system s de broglie wavelength is greater than the correlation length of the thermal fluctuations one achieves a temperature low enough to see a qpt . in this",
    "regime thermal fluctuations are unable to excite the system from its ground state and a phase transition solely driven by quantum fluctuations is still possible to be seen .    many theoretical tools employed in the calculation of these cps are usually subjected to the @xmath2 restriction .",
    "interesting examples are the behavior of bipartite @xcite , multipartite @xcite , and generalized entanglement @xcite for spin chains at @xmath2 . quantum discord , a measure of all quantum correlations present in a system @xcite ,",
    "has also been widely used to characterize the cps at @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "the extremal values and the behavior of the derivatives of these quantities can signal the existence of a cp without the knowledge of an order parameter , i.e. , without the knowledge of what macroscopic quantity abruptly changes during the qpt .    all experiments involving qpts are , nevertheless , performed at low temperatures , not at absolute zero , which forbid a direct connection between the measured data and those theoretical results developed for @xmath2 .",
    "recently , however , we have studied , in the thermodynamic limit , the xxz hamiltonian with no magnetic field and shown that quantum discord ( qd ) is able to detect cps at finite @xmath0 while other thermodynamic quantities and entanglement fail in this task @xcite . for that model",
    "we have shown that the thermal quantum discord ( tqd ) , i.e. , qd computed for a system described by the canonical ensemble , possessed a characteristic behavior at the cp robust enough to survive an increasing @xmath0 and , therefore , spotlight a cp of a qpt at finite @xmath0 .    our goal in this work is to extend the study initiated in @xcite in at least two directions .",
    "we want , on one hand , to study different models to see whether or not tqd is still a good cp detector at finite @xmath0 .",
    "we want to answer the following question : does tqd possess a clear distinctive behavior at the cp strong enough to be seen at @xmath3 ? on the other hand , we want to be more quantitative in determining the ability of tqd , and other quantities such as entanglement , to correctly detect the cp of a qpt at finite @xmath0 .",
    "how close to the actual cp are the estimated cps obtained at finite @xmath0 via tqd ?",
    "how do these estimated cps at @xmath3 approach the correct cp as we decrease @xmath0 ?",
    "those are the questions we also want to answer in this paper .",
    "to achieve these goals , we consider here the xxz model in the presence of an external magnetic field and the xy model in a transverse field .",
    "for both models we analyze the behavior of tqd and entanglement for @xmath4 around their cps . for the xxz model with an external field",
    "we compare the efficiency of tqd with respect to entanglement in the detection of cps as the temperature increases and also with other thermodynamic quantities . for the xy model",
    "we study the behavior of tqd and the entanglement of its first and second nearest - neighbors as a cp detector .    in order to make this work",
    "self - contained , we organize its presentation as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we review some concepts from information theory necessary to the construction of two measures of quantum correlations : qd and entanglement of formation ( eof ) . in sec .",
    "iii we discuss qualitatively and quantitatively the role of quantum correlations as a tool to detect qpts at zero and finite temperatures in the xxz and xy models , both with external magnetic fields .",
    "our final remarks and conclusions are presented in sec iv .",
    "in the context of classical information theory @xcite , correlation is a measure of the dependence between two or more random variables or observed data values . the total correlation between two random variables @xmath5 and @xmath6 with probability distribution @xmath7 and @xmath8 , respectively , is given by the mutual information ( mi ) @xcite @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the shannon entropy with @xmath11 the probability distribution of the random variable @xmath12 .",
    "if @xmath13 denote the joint probability distribution of the variables @xmath5 and @xmath6 then the joint entropy @xmath14 can be written through the bayes rule @xmath15 @xcite as @xmath16 , where the conditional entropy @xmath17 quantifies how much uncertainty is left on average about @xmath5 when one knows the values of @xmath6 .",
    "note that the conditional entropy is always non - negative and not necessarily a symmetric quantity , i.e. , @xmath18 may be different from @xmath19 . using this relation between @xmath14 and @xmath18",
    "we can obtain an equivalent version for the mi as given in ( [ mi1 ] ) , @xmath20    for a quantum bipartite system @xmath21 described by the density operator @xmath22 , a measure of their total correlation is obtained directly from eq .",

    "( [ mi2 ] ) , can not be obtained so easily because bayes rule are not always valid in the quantum case @xcite .",
    "for example , assuming the validity of this rule , the quantum conditional entropy would be defined as @xmath25 .",
    "but this definition implies a negative value for @xmath26 if one computes it for the quantum state @xmath27 , showing that this quantity can not be interpreted as in the classical case , where it is always positive .    to ensure that the quantum conditional entropy has the same meaning as in the classical case , henderson and vedral @xcite defined the conditional entropy as @xmath28 such that the minimization is given over generalized measurements @xmath29 @xcite , with @xmath30 , @xmath31 the identity operator that acts on @xmath6 , @xmath32 for all @xmath33 , and @xmath34 where @xmath35 with @xmath36 $ ] .",

    "the difference between these two versions of quantum mutual information , @xmath39 was called _ quantum discord _ by ollivier and zurek @xcite and interpreted as a measure of total quantum correlation .",
    "the notation @xmath40 indicates that the measurements were performed on the subsystem @xmath6 . when @xmath41 we have @xmath42 and therefore the qd is a symmetric quantity .",

    "the states with @xmath46 are completely classically correlated in the sense of @xcite .",
    "an example of such state is @xmath51 .",
    "this result shows that the existence of quantum correlations is due to the principle of superposition that allows describing a system through a set of non - orthogonal states . here , and analogously to entanglement computed for thermal states @xcite",
    ", we use the nomenclature coined in @xcite , namely , thermal quantum discord ( tqd ) , to refer to qd computed for states described by the canonical ensemble .",
    "the main difficulty in the determination of a closed expression for qd lies in the complicated minimization procedure for calculating the conditional entropy @xmath37 . for two - qubit systems",
    "the minimization over generalized measurements is equivalent to a minimization over projective measurements ( von neumann measurements ) @xcite . in this case",
    ", the minimization procedure can be done numerically for general two - qubit states @xcite while an analytical expression can be obtained only for a subclass of the so - called x - states ( see appendix ) . in this paper",
    "we employed both strategies , i.e. , numerical minimization and , when available , closed expressions for computing qd .",
    "next , we introduce an important kind of quantum correlated states , the entangled states . a quantum bipartite state described by @xmath22",
    "is said to be _ entangled _ if , and only if , it can not be written as a separable state @xmath52 , where @xmath53 and @xmath54 @xcite .",
    "although there are states with non - zero quantum discord created only by local operations and classical communication ( locc ) , entanglement can not be generated in this way @xcite .",
    "for pure states all quantum correlated states are entangled .",
    "the situation is more complicated in the case of mixed states .",
    "for example , the werner state @xmath55 , with @xmath56 and @xmath57 $ ] , is separable for @xmath58 and non - local ( violates a bell - like inequality ) for @xmath59 .",
    "however , the werner state have null quantum discord only for @xmath60 .    in this paper",
    "the measure of entanglement used is the _ entanglement of formation _ ( eof ) @xcite , which is defined as @xmath61 , where the minimization is over all ensembles of pure states @xmath62 such that @xmath63 and @xmath64 is the von neumann entropy of the reduced state of either @xmath5 or @xmath6 , @xmath65 .",
    "the eof quantifies , at least for pure states and asymptotically , how many singlets are needed per copy to prepare many copies of @xmath22 using only locc .",
    "it is worth emphasizing that it coincides with the quantum discord when one deals with pure states .",
    "an analytic closed expression for eof is given in the appendix .",

    "we use three values of @xmath165 as shown in the graphs.,width=302 ]    it is important to note that tqd is more resistant to thermal effects than eof .",
    "for example , for @xmath149 eof for the first - neighbors is zero or close to zero for almost all @xmath164 while tqd is always non - null . for second - neighbors",
    "the situation is more drastic , eof is always zero for @xmath149 .",
    "the previous discussion also highlights a qualitative difference between the behavior of quantum correlations as measured by quantum discord or entanglement , especially for @xmath193 .    since the ising transition is a second - order qpt , the critical point at @xmath2",
    "is characterized by a divergence or discontinuity in the first derivative of tqd or eof @xcite ; and if the first derivative is discontinuous then the cp can also be found through the divergence of the second derivative . similarly to the xxz model studied in sec .",

    "the results of our analysis are shown in fig .",

    "the derivatives of tqd and eof were used to estimate the cps as explained in the text .",
    "note that at panel ( b ) the curves for tqd and eof coincide and that at panels ( d ) and ( f ) we only have two points for eof since for greater @xmath0 it is zero.,width=302 ]    looking at fig . [ fig11 ] we note that the cp of the ising transition is best estimated by tqd than eof .",
    "while for @xmath193 and @xmath198 the first - neighbor tqd is only slightly better than eof to estimate the cp , for @xmath167 the cp computed by tqd is clearly closer to @xmath170 than the one estimated from eof .",
    "moreover , the temperature below which tqd is a good cp detector is higher for @xmath167 than for @xmath193 or @xmath198 ( see fig . [ fig11]a ) .",
    "when we look at the second - neighbors tqd and eof , we see that tqd is still better than eof to estimate the cp . and in particular for @xmath199 , eof is only useful for very tiny @xmath0 while tqd works relatively well for higher values of @xmath0 .",
    "it is worth noting that for small @xmath0 tqd seems to approach the actual cp almost linearly as we decrease @xmath0 .",
    "therefore , a relatively small number of points for a couple of small temperatures allows one to correctly extrapolate to the exact value of the cp at @xmath2 .",
    "this fact is also observed for the behavior of tqd in the xxz model .",
    "an interesting future investigation , lying beyond the scope of this manuscript , would be to rigorously determine the functional form by which tqd and eof approach the exact cp for decreasing @xmath0 .",
    "we close this section studying the behavior of tqd and eof near the critical point @xmath172 , which is associated to the anisotropy transition that occurs only for @xmath171 .",
    "hence , for definiteness , in what follows we set @xmath200 . in fig . [ fig12 ] we plot tqd and eof for the first and second - neighbors as a function of @xmath165 for five different values of temperature , @xmath201 , and @xmath202 .",

    "[ fig12 ] we see that tqd and eof are maximum at the cp @xmath172 for first- and second - neighbors , keeping this feature as @xmath0 increases . however , only tqd possesses a cusp - like behavior at the cp .",
    "furthermore , for first - neighbors tqd presents the same pattern ( maximum with a cusp - like behavior ) up to @xmath153 while eof vanishes for @xmath204 .",
    "this situation is more drastic for second - neighbors : while tqd can detect the cp even for values near @xmath152 , eof is nonzero only at low temperatures ( @xmath205 ) .",
    "finally , as in the xxz model with no external field , there is an exchange in the set of projectors that minimizes the conditional entropy ( [ conde ] ) at the cp .",
    "this feature is characterized by a discontinuity in the first - order derivative of tqd and explains the cusp - like behavior of tqd at @xmath172 .",
    "in this paper we have studied the ability of quantum correlations to spotlight critical points of quantum phase transitions when the system under investigation is away from the absolute zero , the experimentally unattainable temperature where a quantum phase transition sets in .",
    "we have mainly focused our analysis in two distinct types of quantum correlations , namely , the entanglement and the quantum discord between pairs of spins .",
    "we first concentrated our efforts in computing those quantum correlations for an infinite chain described by the xxz model with an external field in the @xmath67-direction and in equilibrium with a thermal reservoir at temperature @xmath0 . by tracing out all but two nearest - neighbors we were able to calculate their entanglement and quantum discord for several t. for this model we also evaluated several thermodynamic quantities as well . among all these quantities , we have shown that quantum discord is the best critical point detector at finite @xmath0 , furnishing rather precise values for the two quantum critical points for this model , a first order and an infinite order phase transition .    we then moved to study other models , such as the infinite chain xy model and the ising model , both of which with external transverse magnetic fields .",
    "this time we computed the entanglement and the quantum discord for first and second nearest - neighbors , assuming the system in equilibrium with a thermal reservoir at temperature @xmath0 . for the second order phase transition usually referred to as the ising transition , we observed that quantum discord is better suited in estimating the correct value for the quantum critical point .",
    "for the other quantum phase transition , the so called anisotropy transition ( also second order ) , quantum discord and entanglement give excellent results for low temperatures .",
    "as the temperature increases quantum discord outperform entanglement as a quantum critical point estimator .    summarizing",
    ", the previous discussions showed that for all the cases here presented , quantum discord was the best critical point estimator when one deals with finite temperature systems .",
    "note that we never needed to know the order parameter of the phase transitions to use these quantum correlations as critical point detectors .",
    "moreover , we have also showed that using the quantum discord ( our best critical point estimator ) , and with theoretically computed data for several @xmath0 , we can with reasonable accuracy infer the actual value of the critical point at @xmath2 by looking at the behavior of these quantities when @xmath0 approaches zero .",
    "therefore , we have given strong indications that entanglement and in special quantum discord are useful quantities in estimating quantum critical points when the available data are away from the absolute zero .",
    "this fact alone shows that these quantities are an important tool in the study of quantum phase transitions in realistic experimental scenarios , where one is always working at finite @xmath0 and has perhaps no clue of the order parameter of the phase transition taking place .",
