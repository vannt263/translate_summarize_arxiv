    "stable commutator length is a numerical invariant of elements in the commutator subgroup of a group .",
    "it is intimately related to ( two - dimensional ) bounded cohomology , and appears in many areas of low - dimensional topology and dynamics , from the milnor - wood inequality , to the @xmath2 conjecture . however , although a great deal of work has gone into estimating or bounding stable commutator length in many contexts , there are very few known nontrivial examples of finitely presented groups in which it can be calculated exactly , and virtually no cases where the range of stable commutator length on a given group can be understood arithmetically .",
    "the most significant results of this paper are as follows :    1 .",
    "we show that stable commutator length in free groups takes on only rational values , and give an explicit algorithm to compute the value on any given element .",
    "this is the first example of a group with infinite dimensional second bounded cohomology group @xmath3 in which stable commutator length can be calculated exactly .",
    "we show how to extend stable commutator length to a ( pseudo)-norm on the vector space @xmath0 of homogenized real ( group ) @xmath1-cochains that are boundaries of @xmath4-cochains . in the case of a free group , this is a genuine norm .",
    "we show that the intersection of the unit ball in this norm with any finite dimensional rational subspace of @xmath0 of a free group is a finite - sided rational polyhedron .",
    "this invites comparison with the thurston norm on the @xmath4-dimensional homology of a @xmath5-manifold @xcite , although the relationship between the two cases is subtle and deserves further investigation .",
    "we give examples of explicit elements in the commutator subgroup of @xmath6 ( the free group of rank @xmath4 ) for which the stable commutator length is not in @xmath7 .",
    "this answers in the negative a well - known question of bavard @xcite .",
    "we now elaborate on these points in turn .",
    "let @xmath8 be a group .",
    "for @xmath9 $ ] , the _ commutator length _ of @xmath10 , denoted @xmath11 , is the smallest number of commutators in @xmath8 whose product is equal to @xmath10 .",
    "the _ stable commutator length _ of @xmath10 , denoted @xmath12 , is the limit of @xmath13 as @xmath14 . in geometric language , ( see e.g.  gromov @xcite ) @xmath15 is sometimes called `` filling genus '' , and @xmath16 is called `` stable filling genus '' .",
    "this quantity is intimately related , by bavard duality and an exact sequence ( see theorem  [ duality_theorem ] and proposition  [ exact_sequence_prop ] ) to the second bounded cohomology @xmath3 of @xmath8 , with its banach norm . despite a considerable amount of research , there are very few known examples of groups @xmath8 in which @xmath16 can be calculated exactly ( except when it vanishes identically ) .",
    "this is partly because the groups @xmath3 , when nontrivial , tend to be very large in general : when @xmath8 is word - hyperbolic , @xmath3 is not merely infinite dimensional , but is not even separable as a banach space . calculating @xmath16 is tantamount to solving an extremal problem in @xmath3 .",
    "( technically , one solves the extremal problem in the space of _ homogeneous quasimorphisms _",
    "@xmath17 , see definition  [ quasimorphism_definition ] .",
    "the spaces @xmath17 and @xmath3 are both banach spaces , and are related by the coboundary @xmath18 , which is fredholm when @xmath8 is finitely presented . )    gromov ( @xcite 6.@xmath19 ) asked whether @xmath16 is always rational in finitely presented groups . the answer to gromov s question",
    "is known to be _ no _ : dongping zhuang gave the first examples in @xcite .",
    "these examples occur in generalized stein - thompson groups of pl homeomorphisms of the circle , where one can show that @xmath3 is actually finite dimensional , and everything can be calculated explicitly . in this paper",
    "we show that _",
    "@xmath16 is rational _ in free groups ( and some closely related groups ) , and moreover we give an explicit algorithm to compute the value of @xmath16 on any element .",
    "if @xmath20 are elements in @xmath8 , define @xmath21 to be the smallest number of commutators in @xmath8 whose product is equal to the product of conjugates of the @xmath22 .",
    "let @xmath23 denote the limit of @xmath24 as @xmath14 .",
    "this function can be extended by linearity and continuity in a unique way to a pseudo - norm on @xmath25 , the vector space of real group @xmath1-chains on @xmath8 that are in the image of the boundary map @xmath26 .",
    "this function vanishes identically on the subspace @xmath27 of @xmath25 spanned by terms of the form @xmath28 and @xmath29 for @xmath30 and @xmath31 , and descends to a pseudo - norm on the quotient @xmath32 , or @xmath0 for short . when @xmath8 is hyperbolic , @xmath16 is a genuine norm on @xmath0 .",
    "we show that in a free group , this @xmath16 norm is _ piecewise rational linear _ ( denoted pql ) on finite dimensional rational subspaces of @xmath0 .",
    "so for any finite set of elements @xmath33 , there is a uniform upper bound on the denominators of the values of @xmath16 on integral linear chains @xmath34 in @xmath0 .",
    "one should compare the @xmath16 norm with the gromov - thurston norm @xcite , which is a norm on @xmath35 of an irreducible , atoroidal @xmath5-manifold , and whose most significant feature is that it is a piecewise rational linear function . in thurston s definition (",
    "in which one restricts to embedded surfaces ) this is straightforward to show . in gromov s definition ( in terms of chains , or immersed surfaces ) this is a very deep theorem , whose proof depends on the full power of gabai s theory of sutured hierarchies @xcite , and taut foliations .",
    "in fact , it is reasonable to think of the @xmath16 norm as a relative gromov - thurston norm , with gromov s definition .",
    "our proof of rationality is conceptually close in some ways to an argument due to oertel @xcite insofar as both proofs reduce the problem of calculating the norm to a linear programming problem in the vector space of weights carried by a finite constructible branched surface .",
    "however , there are crucial differences between the two cases . in oertel",
    "s case , the branched surface might have complicated branch locus , but it comes with an embedding in a @xmath5-manifold . in our case ,",
    "the branch locus is simple , but the branched surface is merely _ immersed _ in a @xmath5-manifold .",
    "it is intriguing to try to find a natural generalization of both theories .    in his seminal paper @xcite on stable commutator length , bavard asked whether stable commutator length in free groups takes values in @xmath7 .",
    "there were several pieces of direct and indirect evidence for this conjecture .",
    "firstly , where certain ( geometric or homological ) methods for estimating stable commutator length in free groups give exact answers , these answers in every case confirm bavard s guess . secondly , in the ( analogous ) context of @xmath5-manifold topology , one knows that the gromov norm of an integral @xmath4-dimensional homology class is in @xmath36 ( the factor of @xmath37 arises because gromov norm counts triangles , whereas stable commutator norm counts handles ) .",
    "it was generally felt that bavard s conjecture was eminently plausible , and it is therefore surprising that our algorithm produces many elements whose stable commutator length is not in @xmath7 .",
    "in fact experiments suggest that arbitrarily large denominators occur , with arbitrary prime factors . in view of these examples ,",
    "the fact that stable commutator length is rational in free groups is seen to be a more delicate and subtle fact than one might have imagined , and stable commutator length to be a richer invariant than previous work has suggested .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows . in",

    "we specialize to the case of free groups .",

    "4 .   there is an algorithm to calculate @xmath16 on any finite dimensional rational subspace of @xmath0 .",

    "we give cursory definitions below to standardize terminology , but the reader who is not familiar with branched surface should consult e.g.  @xcite chapter  6 ,   6.3 , or @xcite",
    "  1 for precise definitions .",
    "a _ branched surface _ is a finite , smooth @xmath4-complex obtained from a finite collection of smooth surfaces by gluing compact subsurfaces .",
    "the set of non - manifold points of a branched surface @xmath219 is called the _ branch locus _ , and denoted @xmath220 . a branched surface in which the branch locus is a @xmath1-manifold",
    "is called a _",
    "simple branched surface_. in this paper we are only interested in simple branched surfaces .",
    "one can also consider branched surfaces with boundary ; the boundary of a branched surface is a _ train - track _ ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "the components of @xmath221 are called the _ sectors _ of the branched surface .",
    "a branched surface is oriented if the sectors can be oriented in such a way that the orientations are compatible along @xmath220 . in a simple branched surface , several distinct sectors locally bound a component of the branch locus from either side",
    "; see figure  [ local_models ] for an example of the local model .        a _",
    "weight _ is a linear function @xmath222 from the sectors of @xmath219 to @xmath223 satisfying the _ gluing conditions _ : along each component of @xmath220 , the weights of the sectors on each side sum to the same value .",
    "a branched surface @xmath219 has a well - defined tangent bundle , even along the branch locus , so it makes sense to say that a map from a surface into @xmath219 is an immersion .",
    "a proper immersion @xmath224 from an oriented surface to an oriented branched surface @xmath219 is said to be a _ carrying map _ , and @xmath55 is said to be _ carried _ by @xmath219 .",
    "a carrying map determines a weight @xmath222 , where @xmath225 is the cardinality of @xmath226 for @xmath74 a point in the interior of a sector @xmath227 .",
    "given a non - negative integral weight @xmath222 , we say that a carrying map @xmath224 _ realizes _",
    "@xmath222 if the weight associated to @xmath55 is @xmath222 .",
    "note that @xmath55 is not uniquely determined by its weight in general .",
    "for an abstract branched surface , not every non - negative integral weight is realized , but for a _ simple _ branched surface , every non - negative integral weight is realized .",
    "this is a somewhat subtle point , so we make a few clarifying remarks .",

    "take @xmath231 copies of @xmath232 for each @xmath233 .",
    "the gluing condition along @xmath228 is the equality @xmath234 hence there is a bijection between the set of copies of the @xmath229 and the set of copies of the @xmath230 .",
    "after choosing such a bijection , these copies can be glued up along copies of @xmath228 to build the surface @xmath55 near @xmath228 . for a general branched surface , there is a holonomy problem at the triple points of @xmath220 : around each triple point , the holonomy must be trivial , or else the surface constructed will map to @xmath219 with branch points .",
    "but if @xmath219 is simple , there are no such triple points , and the holonomy problem goes away .",
    "this concludes our summary of the theory of branched surfaces .",
    "if @xmath219 is an _ embedded _ branched surface ( possibly with triple points ) in a @xmath5-manifold @xmath235 , the local transverse order structure canonically solves the holonomy problem : associated to each weight there is a unique _ embedded _",
    "surface contained in a tubular neighborhood of @xmath219 .",
    "the requirement that the surface be embedded makes the bijections along edges canonical , and therefore the holonomy around a triple point is necessarily trivial .",
    "a similar phenomenon occurs in normal surface theory : a vector of weights satisfying the gluing equalities and inequalities determines a unique embedded normal surface .",
    "when one tries to do immersed normal surface theory in @xmath5-manifolds , the holonomy problem reasserts itself and the situation becomes very tricky ; see @xcite for a discussion of some of the phenomena which arise in the theory of immersed normal surfaces .",
    "we construct a branched surface @xmath219 as follows .",
    "@xmath219 is obtained by taking a disjoint copy of each combinatorial type of ( oriented ) marked polygon @xmath211 , and a copy of each combinatorial type of ( oriented ) rectangle @xmath236 as above , and gluing them along their common oriented edges .",
    "there is a unique way to choose the smooth structure along @xmath220 compatibly with the orientations .",
    "notice that each marked polygon is glued to exactly one rectangle along each non - horizontal edge , but each rectangle is typically glued to several polygons along each of two edges .",
    "hence a weight is determined by its values on polygon sectors ( cf .",
    "quadrilateral co - ordinates in normal surface theory ) .",
    "the resulting branched surface is special in a few ways , of which we take note :    1 .",
    "it is _ oriented _ , since it is obtained by gluing oriented pieces in a manner compatible with their orientations .",
    "the branch locus consists of a finite union of embedded arcs along which a rectangle is glued to several possible polygons . in particular , the branch locus contains no triple points and is _",
    "simple_. 3 .",
    "the branched surface has boundary which is an oriented train - track .",
    "every surface @xmath55 carried by @xmath219 has boundary @xmath58 which is carried by @xmath237 .",
    "4 .   the branched surface admits a tautological immersion @xmath238 , by choosing a map for each rectangle and polygon type and gluing these maps together along the edges .",
    "the restriction of @xmath239 to each train - track component of @xmath237 is an oriented immersion to @xmath53    for each polygon @xmath211 let @xmath240 denote the number of edges , and @xmath241 the number of horizontal edges .",
    "note that @xmath242 and @xmath243 , since a pair of adjacent edges of a polygon can not both be horizontal .",
    "furthermore , if @xmath244 then @xmath245 .",

    "each rectangle contributes @xmath247 to @xmath86 , and each polygon @xmath211 contributes @xmath248 this can be seen by giving each rectangle and polygon a singular foliation tangent to @xmath237 and transverse to @xmath220 , and using the hopf - poincar formula .    in particular",
    ", the contribution of each polygon to @xmath86 is _ nonpositive _ , and therefore @xmath85 is a _ linear function _ of the number and kinds of rectangles and polygons that make it up .    in summary ,",

    "conversely , since @xmath219 is simple , every non - negative integral weight on @xmath219 corresponds to a surface @xmath55 as above ( possibly not unique ) , and @xmath73 is a linear function of the values of @xmath222 on the branches of @xmath219 .",

    "let @xmath55 be a surface carried by @xmath219 associated to @xmath222 . then define @xmath255 and extend by linearity to @xmath253 .",

    "thirdly , the extremal surfaces guaranteed in bullet  ( [ extremal_bullet ] ) of the rationality theorem are exploited to construct closed surface subgroups in certain graphs of free groups amalgamated along cyclic subgroups .",
