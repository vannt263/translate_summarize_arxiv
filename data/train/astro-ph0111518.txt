    "hoii is a dwarf irregular galaxy on the outskirts of the m81 group , at a distance of 3.2  mpc ( @xmath1=@xmath2  mag ) .",
    "it is one of the first galaxies outside the local group where the effects of sequential star formation on the interstellar medium ( ism ) were investigated .",
    "puche et al .",
    "( 1992 ; hereafter pwbr92 ) present high - resolution multi - configuration vla h@xmath0i observations , revealing a complex pattern of interconnected shells and holes .",
    "they argue for self - propagating star formation , whereby supernova explosions ( sne ) and stellar winds shape the ism .",
    "while we do not wish to challenge the general relevance of such scenarios here , we will highlight numerous problems they face in the particular case of hoii .",
    "some have been noted before , but others are mentioned for the first time .",
    "we reanalyzed pwbr92 s h@xmath0i observations of hoii , keeping only the d - array data .",
    "we produced a continuum - subtracted naturally - weighted cube cleaned to a depth of 1@xmath3 ( 2.75  mjy  beam@xmath4 ) and associated moment maps .",
    "the total h@xmath0i map is shown in figure  1 superposed on an optical image .",
    "a previously undetected , large but faint component extends over the entire northwest half of the galaxy , encompassing the h@xmath0i cloud detected by pwbr92 .",
    "the h@xmath0i on the southeast side is compressed , giving rise to a striking nw - se asymmetry , suggesting that hoii is affected by ram pressure from an intragroup medium ( igm ) .",
    "the velocity field shows a clear differentially rotating disk pattern in the inner 78 , but the kinematics at larger radii is rather disturbed . the total h@xmath0i flux @xmath5  jy  km  s@xmath4 , corresponding to @xmath6  m@xmath7 .",
    "the h@xmath0i morphology in figure  1 is reminiscent of ram pressure but could also be due to interactions .",
    "hoii is 475  kpc in projection from the m81 group center . at the ( deprojected ) group velocity dispersion of 190  km  s@xmath4 ( huchra & geller 1982 )",
    ", it would take hoii a fifth of a hubble time to reach the center of the group .",
    "hoii appears to be part of a subsystem of three dwarf irregular galaxies , with kar52 ( m81dwa ) and ugc4483 .",
    "if hoii is interacting , it must be with one of these .",
    "kar52 and ugc4483 are much smaller and fainter than hoii and have irregular optical morphologies , but neither shows obvious signs of interactions ( bremnes , binggeli , & prugniel 1998 ) . in h@xmath0i , kar52 displays an incomplete lumpy ring with little rotation ( sargent , sancisi , & lo 1983 ) , and ugc4483 shows a peaked distribution with a faint envelope extending nw - se ( van zee , skillman , & salzer 1998 ) .",
    "the distance to hoii is identical to that of ugc4483 but also to that of ngc2403 and ddo44 to the sw , suggesting that hoii belongs to the ngc2403 subgroup , along with kar52 , ugc4483 , ngc2365 , and ddo44 .",
    "karachentsev et al .",
    "( 2000 ) suggest that the ngc2403 subgroup is moving towards the m81 group at a velocity of 110 - 160  km  s@xmath4 .",
    "the environment of hoii thus does not support interactions as a likely mechanism to shape its large - scale structure , but rather suggests that it could have a large velocity relative to a putative igm .",
    "ram pressure must therefore be considered seriously to explain its h@xmath0i morphology .",
    "h@xmath0i observations of the entire region around hoii , kar52 , and ugc4483 should help clarify this issue and are underway .",
    "the condition for ram pressure stripping can be written as @xmath8 ( gunn & gott 1972 ) , where @xmath9 is the igm density , @xmath10 the relative velocity of the galaxy with respect to the igm , and @xmath11 and @xmath12 the total and ism surface densities , respectively .",
    "taking @xmath13  km  s@xmath4 and @xmath11 and @xmath12 ( corrected for other gaseous species ) at the first significantly disturbed contour in figure  1 , we derive a critical density for stripping @xmath14  atoms  @xmath15 .",
    "a virial mass of @xmath16  m@xmath7 is derived from the main members of the m81 group ( huchra & geller 1982 ) . spreading 1% of this mass in a sphere just enclosing hoii",
    ", we obtain a mean density of @xmath17  atoms  @xmath15 , three times less than that required for stripping .",
    "this number provides a benchmark with which to compare more realistic calculations .",
    "the igm will be more concentrated and clumpy , and the encounter may not be exactly `` face - on '' , but since the group velocity dispersion is based only on the largest galaxies , it is probably underestimated , and the group is in any case unlikely to be virialized at the distance of hoii , making its velocity highly unconstrained . if hoii is bound to the m81 group , then the virial mass adopted is also severely underestimated . all these factors can easily bring the required and derived igm densities in agreement .",
    "typical parameters for poor groups are @xmath18  mpc and @xmath19  m@xmath7 ( zabludoff & mulchaey 1998 ) , of which only 1020% is in individual galaxies , leading to a mean density for the remaining matter of @xmath20  atoms  @xmath15 within @xmath21 .",
    "if only 0.1% of this is ordinary interacting baryonic matter , then its density is sufficient to strip the outer ism of galaxies like hoii .",
    "this is promising since on scales of the virial radius , the dominant baryonic component in groups is the igm .",
    "zabludoff & mulchaey ( 1998 ) report x - ray gas masses of @xmath22  m@xmath7 for their groups , leading to mean densities for the hot gas of @xmath23  atoms  @xmath15 within @xmath21 .",
    "the total x - ray luminosity of groups does not correlate with the number of galaxies or optical luminosity , but it does with the velocity dispersion and gas temperature . a fit to cluster and compact groups yields , for @xmath24  km  s@xmath4 , @xmath25  erg  s@xmath4 and @xmath26  kev ( ponman et al .  1996 ) .",
    "the correlation for loose groups alone yields @xmath27  erg  s@xmath4 and @xmath28  kev ( helsdon & ponman 2000 ) .",
    "the large errors are probably related to the wind injection histories of the groups , which in turn lead to shallow surface brightness profiles .",
    "there are also indications that the groups and clusters correlations are different , so both @xmath29 and @xmath30 are probably underestimates , and there can be a large amount of hot gas in m81-like groups .",
    "following cowie & mckee ( 1977 ) , the evaporation timescale for a typical cloud ( @xmath31  @xmath15 , @xmath32  pc ) embedded in an igm at the aforementioned temperatures is @xmath33 to @xmath34  yr .",
    "the h@xmath0i `` tail '' in hoii extends over @xmath35 in the radial direction . at 190  km  s@xmath4",
    ", it takes hoii @xmath36  yr to cross that distance .",
    "given the strong dependence of the evaporation on the assumed properties of the clouds and igm , the timescales calculated seem consistent with observations . in the conditions of interest here , cooling and viscous",
    "stripping ( nulsen 1982 ) are negligible compared to evaporation .",
    "pwbr92 studied over 50 h@xmath0i holes in hoii and argued for their formation through sne and stellar winds .",
    "however , h@xmath37 and far - uv emission do not preferentially fill small holes or trace the edges of large ones .",
    "the shells are also devoid of hot gas , and x - ray emission is not preferentially associated with h@xmath0ii regions or h@xmath0i holes ( kerp & walter 2001 ) . the sn rates derived from radio continuum observations and the h@xmath0i shells agree ( tongue & westpfahl 1995 ) , but the energy is deposited in the central regions of hoii only , hardly helping to explain the formation of the outer shells . furthermore ,",
    "when useful limits are derived , most stellar clusters expected from massive star formation are not seen ( rhode et al .",
    "multi - wavelength observations thus pose a challenge to sne and stellar winds scenarios for the formation of the shells in hoii , particularly in the outer parts of the disk , where no star formation is expected or taking place .",
    "rhode et al .  ( 1999 ) discuss other mechanisms for the formation of the shells .",
    "sn are most likely not spherically expanding in a uniform ism , as assumed , the initial mass function could be very top - heavy , and gamma - ray bursts could also create holes , but all these mechanisms still require massive star formation in the outer parts of the disk . a fractal h@xmath0i , overpressured h@xmath0ii regions , external ionization sources , and/or high - velocity clouds can bypass this requirement .",
    "we suggest here that ram pressure provides another solution to the shell formation problem in hoii .",
    "ram pressure can create holes in an h@xmath0i disk where local minima in the surface density exist .",
    "it provides a mechanism to enlarge pre - existing holes , created by sne or otherwise , and can explain the large energy requirements ( or lack of observational signature ) from sne and stellar winds .",
    "of course , ram pressure - driven shell formation should be properly modeled before making further claims .",
    "it should be easily distinguished from internal , pressure - driven events , as the shells will have a `` bullet - hole '' geometry like that caused by high - velocity clouds . in hoii",
    "s case , a direct proof of a dense igm must also be found before any ram pressure model can be taken seriously ."
