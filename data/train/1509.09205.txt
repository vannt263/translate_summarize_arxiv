    "price and rosswog suggested for the first time that this could be indeed the case  @xcite .",
    "this instability develops in a shear layer which appears when the two stars come into contact .",
    "it has been controversial whether this mechanism works in practice and several preliminary simulations have been reported  @xcite .",
    "the issue is that , because the growth rate of the kh instability is proportional to the wave number of the mode , high - resolution simulations together with a careful convergence study is necessary to explore this instability .",
    "recently , the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite have performed general relativistic magnetohydrodynamics ( grmhd ) simulation of the bns merger with significantly higher resolution ( by a factor @xmath8 ) than any previous simulation .",
    "they revealed that , only for a sufficiently high numerical resolution , the kh instability activates as an amplifier of the magnetic field at the merger .",
    "however , it is still an open question to what extent the magnetic field is amplified during the merger under realistic conditions because an initial magnetic - field strength employed in ref .",
    "@xcite was assumed to be of magnetar class , i.e. , @xmath9 g. because the magnetic - field amplification was saturated at the maximum field strength of @xmath10 g , the previous simulations followed this amplification process by a factor of 10 .",

    "we implement a fixed mesh refinement algorithm to cover a wide dynamical range of bns mergers . specifically , a refinement domain labeled by @xmath11 is a cuboid box of @xmath12 $ ] , @xmath13 $ ] , and @xmath14 $ ] where we assume an orbital plane symmetry .",

    "the divergence free condition as well as the flux conservation of the magnetic field in a refinement boundary are preserved by the balsara s algorithm  @xcite .    to improve the grid resolution for a shear layer which appears",
    "when the two stars come into contact , we add new refinement domains at about @xmath23 ms before the merger .",
    "the size of the new finest refinement domain is determined by the initial grid configuration ; typically , the _ initial _ finest domain is a cuboid of @xmath24 .",

    "if we add two domains , the final finest domain is that of @xmath26 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig0 ] for a schematic picture ) .",
    "previous simulations have suggested that the shear layer appears in a central region of radius @xmath27 m  @xcite .",
    "therefore , we increase the number of the refinement domains up to two . table  [ tab1 ] shows the grid setup . we achieve @xmath0 m resolution which is much finer than the highest - resolution in our previous simulation  @xcite .    as a fiducial model",

    "the observations of binary pulsars suggest that the _ surface dipole _",
    "magnetic - field strength is in the range @xmath41 g  @xcite .",
    "however , the interior magnetic field strength is mostly unconstrained since currents at the surface could be shielding a much stronger or weaker field in the interior . if shielding is not invoked , theoretical models of magnetized neutron star equilibria result in a typical interior magnetic field  25 times as large as its surface value @xcite .",
    "we thus set the initial maximum magnetic - field strength to be @xmath3 g , which is approximately compatible with the upper observational limit mentioned above and a reasonable choice to mimic the realistic magnetic - field strength of the bnss . to explore the saturation of the magnetic - field energy amplified by the kh instability , we artificially increase the initial magnetic - field strength up to @xmath42 g in some of our simulations .",

    "<S> we explore magnetic - field amplification due to the kelvin - helmholtz instability during binary neutron star mergers . by performing high - resolution general relativistic magnetohydrodynamics simulations with a resolution of @xmath0 m for @xmath1@xmath2 ms after the onset of the merger on the japanese supercomputer `` k '' , we find that an initial magnetic field of moderate maximum strength @xmath3 g is amplified at least by a factor of @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> we also explore the saturation of the magnetic - field energy and our result shows that it is likely to be @xmath5 erg , which is @xmath6 of the bulk kinetic energy of the merging binary neutron stars . </S>"
