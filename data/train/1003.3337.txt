    "the strong interaction as described by quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) , is a remarkable branch of physics which shows a rich phase structure at finite temperature and density . at low temperatures and densities , the dominant degrees of freedom in our nature are color - singlet bound states of hadrons .",
    "however , due to the asymptotic freedom of qcd , it is expected that at very high temperatures and densities these hadrons break up to liberate quarks and gluons and form the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) .",
    "the experimental exploration of such a phase transition from the confined hadronic phase to the deconfined qgp phase is being pursued actively in the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) and more data are expected from large hadron collider ( lhc ) running at cern and in the future experiment at fair .",
    "the transition region is however quite far from the asymptotic regime of qcd .",
    "this non - perturbative nature makes the study of these hot and dense matter quite non - trivial .",
    "the most reliable way to analyze the physics in this range of interest is to perform the numerical computation of a lattice version of the color su(3 ) gauge theory ( lattice qcd / lqcd ) .",
    "the scheme is robust but numerically costly . hence the most popular way to study",
    "the physics of the phase transition of strongly interacting matter is to look into one of the various possible effective models inspired from qcd .",
    "one of these is the nambu - jona - lasinio ( njl ) model @xcite which incorporates the global symmetries of qcd quite nicely .",
    "a four quark interaction term in the njl lagrangian is able to generate the physics of spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry - a property of qcd which is manifested as the nondegenerate chiral partners of the low - mass hadrons .",
    "but the major drawback of the njl model is to have a reasonable description of the physics of color confinement . in this respect ,",
    "the polyakov loop extended njl ( pnjl ) model @xcite tries to incorporate the fact that the chiral transition in qcd is of deconfining nature by introducing a background temporal gluon field .    in our previous work",
    "@xcite we elaborately studied the 2 + 1 flavor pnjl model @xcite , incorporating four - quark and six - quark interaction terms in the lagrangian with three - momentum cut - off regularization .",
    "the six - quark interaction term ( or the t hooft determinant term ) preserves the @xmath5 symmetry and breaks the @xmath6 symmetry required due to the chiral anomaly .",
    "this term is also responsible for the flavor mixing in the @xmath7 and @xmath8 mesons to give @xmath9 and @xmath10 mesons .",
    "however , due to the six - quark term the vacuum of the model becomes unbounded from below .",
    "this problem has become more obvious in the functional analysis of the lagrangian . in the work of reinhardt and alkofer @xcite the stationary phase approximation method",
    "was considered to bosonize the model and to calculate the contribution of the classical path at the lowest order .",
    "this lowest order results sums all tree diagrams in powers of the coupling constant of the six quark interaction .",
    "but the functional integral bosonization of the model shows several classical trajectories in that interval of the functional integration .",
    "since at leading order there can be only one classical trajectory in the mean - field potential , the semiclassical potential derived from the functional integration differs from the mean - field one .",
    "so if we consider several classical trajectories , the effective potential of the theory gets unbounded from below .",
    "in fact , the origin of multi - quark interactions is not very well - known .",
    "but we can find evidences of multi - quark interactions in the semi - classical theories based on qcd instanton vacuum @xcite .",
    "there we can find certain correlations between two or more quarks by averaging over their positions and orientations in color space .",
    "also in the instanton - gas model an infinite number of multi - quark interactions can be found beyond the zero mode approximation @xcite .",
    "there are also some lattice measurements for the qcd vacuum which shows a hierarchy between the multi - quark interaction @xcite . in this case",
    "the lowest four quark interaction term forms a stable vacuum by breaking the chiral symmetry spontaneously .",
    "but the next term in the hierarchy , the six quark interaction term , which is needed to mimic the @xmath11 anomaly , destroys the ground state .",
    "so one can not truncate the tower of multi - quark interactions at this level .",
    "the next candidate is the eight - quark interaction term which ensures the stability of the vacuum .",
    "there are some recent findings @xcite which show that the addition of the eight - quark interaction term in the lagrangian may solve the problem of unstable vacuum .",
    "the ( 2 + 1)-flavor njl model with an eight - quark interaction was studied in the four momentum cut - off and pauli - villars regularization scheme .",
    "the standard bosonization procedure of six and eight - quark interactions was followed and the multi - quark vertices were replaced by purely mesonic ones by the stationary - phase method . indeed the controversy between the mean - field approach and the functional integral approach has been removed by including the eight - quark interaction term in the lagrangian , since it restricts the number of classical trajectories to one , giving a stable ground state of the system .",
    "recently , kashiwa _ et.al .",
    "@xcite have studied the chiral phase transition in the 2-flavor njl and pnjl models with eight - quark interactions .",
    "the 2-flavor model does not incorporate the six - quark interaction .",
    "in this paper we first of all extend the ( 2 + 1)-flavor njl and pnjl models to include the eight - quark interactions at non - zero temperatures and densities .",
    "for this we use the 3-momentum cut - off regularization scheme .",
    "thereafter we thoroughly investigate the effect of the eight - quark term in the thermodynamic properties of strongly interacting matter .",
    "we organize our paper as follows : in the next section we briefly describe the 2 + 1 flavor pnjl model with eight - quark interaction term in the lagrangian . for the polyakov loop potential we incorporate vandermonde term @xcite . in sec .",
    "@xmath12 we describe the thermodynamic potential of the pnjl model .",
    "we elaborately discuss the parameter sets chosen , and the stability criteria .",
    "the next two sections discuss the results of the paper , about the chiral phase transition and the bulk thermodynamic properties like pressure , trace anomaly at zero density and quark number density at finite temperature and density .",
    "we give a detailed analysis of the phase diagram and the critical end points at the next section .",
    "a summary of our results are available in the last section .    0.3 in",
    "in this section we briefly describe the formalism of the pnjl model with eight - quark interaction term . some details on three flavor pnjl model with four and six quark interaction",
    "can be found in the literature @xcite and the njl model with eight - quark interaction term in @xcite . there is also some work on two flavor pnjl model with eight - quark interaction term @xcite .    in the pnjl model",
    "the gluon dynamics is reduced to the chiral point couplings between quarks and a simple temporal background gauge field which represents polyakov loop dynamics .",

    "@xmath24 is the mass term which breaks the symmetry explicitly .",
    "the mass of a particular flavor is denoted by @xmath25 , where @xmath26 .",
    "@xmath27 is the four - fermi interaction term with coupling @xmath28 .",
    "the next term , @xmath29 , which is a six - fermi interaction term , is invariant under @xmath30 but breaks @xmath31 symmetry .",
    "this term mimics the qcd chiral anomaly .",
    "the terms @xmath32 and @xmath33 are the eight - quark interaction terms which describe the spin zero interactions where @xmath0 and @xmath1 are the corresponding couplings . here",
    "we have considered the interaction terms to be effectively local since the meson physics in the large @xmath34 limit is described by the local lagrangian of this type . since the coupling constants are dimensionful , the model is not renormalizable .",
    "so we have used three - momentum cut - off regulator @xmath35 to make quark loops finite .    in earlier versions of the pnjl model we found that the polyakov loop , which is the normalized trace of the wilson line @xmath36 , has become greater than @xmath37 above @xmath38 @xcite .",
    "to solve this problem one has to take a proper jacobian of transformation from the matrix valued field @xmath36 to @xmath39 which will then constrain the value of @xmath39 within 1 .",
    "one way to resolve this problem is to introduce vandermonde term in the polyakov loop potential @xcite .",

    "the value of the dimensionless parameter @xmath50 will be determined phenomenologically .",
    "the coefficient @xmath50 in the vdm term can in general have some temperature and/or chemical potential dependence .",
    "but here we take a constant value in such a way that we can get the pressure and the transition temperature as close as possible to the lattice qcd results for the pnjl model with and without the eight - quark interaction .",

    "the theory is analogous to the bcs theory of superconductor , where the pairing of two electrons leads to the condensation causing the gap in the energy spectra .",
    "similarly in this model , due to the dynamical breaking of @xmath53 symmetry to @xmath54 a composite operator picks up a nonzero vacuum expectation value leading to @xmath55 condensation . due to the dynamical breaking of chiral symmetry , nine goldstone bosons appear for @xmath56 model .",
