    "] of string theory scattering amplitudes reproduces the usual quantum field theory perturbative expansion of the low - energy content of string theory .",
    "however an explicit general proof of that statement has not been given yet .",
    "besides the intrinsic interest of such a proof , this problem is of great importance for several reasons .",
    "firstly , string inspired methods have already proved their efficiency at one - loop to compute scattering amplitudes in field theory @xcite but also to obtain more general results about amplitudes @xcite .",
    "one would like to be able to generalize these methods to higher loop order in a systematic way .",
    "secondly , it is very important to understand the general mechanisms by which string theory renormalizes supergravity theories . in particular",
    ", the question of the ultraviolet ( uv ) divergences of maximal supergravity in four dimensions continues to draw much attention @xcite and string theory provides a well suited framework to analyze this issue @xcite .",
    "the main contribution of this paper is an attempt to show in full generality in the number of loops and particles how the feynman diagram perturbative expansion is reproduced by the @xmath5 limit of closed string theory amplitudes .",
    "the novelty in our approach is the central use of tropical geometry .",
    "this theory describes  amongst other things  how riemann surfaces can be degenerated to a special kind of graphs called tropical graphs .",
    "for that reason , it provides a very natural framework to analyze the way in which string worldsheets degenerate to particle worldlines when the strings become point - like .",
    "the first implication of considering the @xmath5 limit of string theory in the tropical sense is that worldlines of particles become tropical graphs .",
    "the mathematical definition thereof ( see section [ sec : tropgeom ] ) is very similar to the one of worldline graphs : they are graphs whose edges have lengths  the schwinger proper times of the worldline graph .",
    "the difference between worldline and tropical graphs comes from the fact that tropical graphs have weighted vertices .",
    "a weight one vertex in a tropical graph is the result of shrinking to a point a loop inside the graph , and more generally a weight @xmath6 vertex is the result of shrinking to a point a sub - graph of genus @xmath6 inside the graph .",
    "therefore a genus @xmath7 tropical graph does not necessarily have @xmath7 loops , as some of its vertices may have non - zero weights .    from the point of view of the physical @xmath5 limit , these weighted vertices descend from regions in the phase space of string theory where massive stringy modes propagate and regulate the uv behavior of the low - energy theory . in a nutshell , counter - terms to uv divergences",
    "are inserted on weighted vertices .",
    "a very simple implementation of these last two points can be found in section [ sec : ptlklim ] , where it is explained what features of tropical geometry can be seen in the point - like limit of the one - loop bosonic string partition function .",
    "therefore the tropical geometry framework encompasses both of the aforementioned aspects of the @xmath5 limit : the structure of the graphs and the renormalization systematics . in this picture , what is maybe the most elegant object is the tropical moduli space of @xcite ( defined in section [ sec : tropmodsp ] ) .",
    "it is the space of all tropical graphs of genus @xmath7 with @xmath8 legs , denoted @xmath9 . eventually , we write the field theory amplitudes obtained in the @xmath5 limit of string theory in a compact form as integrals over this single object @xmath9 ( theorem [ thm : bostrop ] ) , @xmath10 where @xmath11 is a string theory amplitude and the right hand side is the renormalized field theory amplitude written in its `` tropical representation '' .",
    "we call a field theory amplitude in a tropical representation a `` tropical amplitude '' . in this representation induced by string theory ,",
    "the integration measure @xmath12 is defined in terms of the graphs schwinger proper times ( lenghts of the inner edges ) .",
    "the integrand @xmath13 is a function of the schwinger proper times and kinematical invariants that contains both the numerator and denominator of the feynman diagram integral as detailed in the proposition [ prop : sym ] .",
    "our starting point is then a @xmath7-loop @xmath8-point string theory amplitude . for simplicity , we work in a setting where it can be written as an integral over the ordinary bosonic moduli space of riemann surfaces @xmath14 ( details on riemann surfaces and their moduli space",
    "are recalled in section [ sec : class - geom - trop ] ) . the general strategy to extract tropical amplitudes",
    "is based decomposing the integration domain of the string amplitudes , @xmath14 , into various regions or cells .",
    "we shall use the so - called kontsevich - penner ( kp ) @xcite decomposition of @xmath14 , which has the essential property that each of the cells corresponds to a combinatorially distinct class of graphs .",
    "thus , as explained in section [ sec : ftl ] , the crucial step of the tropicalization procedure consists in showing that the string theory integral when restricted to a particular cell corresponding to a graph @xmath15 , provides in the @xmath5 limit the contribution of the feynman diagram with topology @xmath15 .",
    "this is basically the content of the conjecture [ conj : kptrop ] , and we are able to prove how for a given topology , the graph together with its denominator structure is recovered .",
    "we also show in some cases how one can extract the numerator of the feynman integral .",
    "let us insist here on the fact that the whole point of the procedure is that feynman diagrams with counter - terms are naturally present , they come from cells labeled by graphs with weighted vertices .",
    "in particular , two kind of cells are most interesting ; the ones that give the unrenormalized amplitude , and the one that gives the counter - term to the new @xmath7-loop primary divergence . though understanding the systematics of the sub - divergences regularization is important , these two kind of cells indeed are crucial as concerns the two practical issues mentioned in the beginning .",
    "they generalize the analytic and non - analytic regions of @xcite to higher loop order .    summing up the various contributions arising from the kp decomposition , we obtain equation , or more precisely the theorem [ thm : bostrop ] stating that tropical amplitudes are indeed renormalized field theory amplitudes .",
    "to ensure the consistency of this procedure , we apply it to the well known cases of tree and one - loop string theory amplitudes in section [ sec : troppf ] .",
    "we see how the existing computations of @xmath5 limits prove the previous statements .",
    "although they are well understood computations , displaying their tropical nature is a necessary step in this work . to conclude the paper ( section [ sec : two - loop ] ) ,",
    "we apply the tropical technology to obtain a new result concerning the @xmath5 limit of the genus two four - graviton type ii string amplitudes computed in @xcite : we derive the tropical representation of the integrand of this amplitude .",
    "we find that it matches the integrand of @xcite , obtained from field theory methods and written in a schwinger proper time parametrization .",
    "performing the same procedure for the recent proposal for the genus three four - graviton amplitude in type ii using pure spinors @xcite would be a very interesting thing to do .",
    "besides the study of the @xmath5 limit of string amplitudes , our approach contributes to a new geometrical understanding of field theory amplitudes since these can be written as integrals over the tropical moduli space .",
    "the net effect of that is to give to feynman parameters a geometrical meaning ; they are the rescaled lengths of the edges they are associated to .",
    "therefore , the components of the feynman integrands have also a geometrical origin .",
    "in particular , the first symanzik polynomial loop momenta in a feynman diagram , while the second corresponds to the denominator of the feynman integrand @xcite .",
    "] of the graph is seen to be the determinant of the period matrix of the associated tropical graph , while the second is given in terms of green functions on the graph .",
    "these observations are not new , and indeed they can be traced back to the inspiring papers @xcite .",
    "several restrictions to the scope of this work are detailed along the text .",
    "all of these are recalled in the discussion in section [ sec : discussion ] and presented as an invitation for further developments .",
    "how could one create a graph out of a riemann surface ( with no boundaries ) ?",
    "the first thing one would have in mind is to stretch the surface to create very long and thin tubes .",
    "this actually does not produce graphs but degenerate riemann surfaces with nodes .",
    "nevertheless , it is a good start , and physically these stretched surfaces probe the infrared region of string theory . to obtain a graph out of these tubes one still have to integrate out the cylindrical dependence thereof .",
    "a good flavor of what is tropical geometry can be found in the survey @xcite where the tropicalization procedure is presented as a way to _ forget the phase of complex numbers_. in the previous example , if @xmath16 and @xmath17 are respectively angular and longitudinal coordinates along the tube , @xmath18 can be conformally mapped to the plane via @xmath19 and indeed , integrating out the cylindrical dependence of @xmath6 amounts to integrating out the phase of @xmath20 .",
    "let us use the genus one bosonic string partition function to illustrate the basic mechanisms of the point - like limit of string theory and see the appearance of tropical geometry .",
    "it is a very good example to precisely identify where do come from the `` phases '' and `` modulus '' of complex numbers in string theory .",
    "it writes @xcite @xmath21 where the trace is performed over the hilbert space of physical states of string theory .",
    "the parameter @xmath22 is defined by @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the modulus of the complex torus .",
    "this expression can be rewritten to make manifest `` phases '' and `` modulus '' as : @xmath25 thus the level - matching condition @xmath26 is enforced by integration over the `` phases '' @xmath27 while the `` moduli '' cause a mass weighting .",
    "more precisely , the masses of the oscillator states are given by @xmath28 where @xmath29 and @xmath30 are the number operators for the left - moving and right - moving sector defined by @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "the lowest mass state has @xmath33 ; it is the tachyon , whose mass is @xmath34 . then come the massless states at @xmath35 which constitute the gravity sector . for @xmath36",
    "the states are massive with masses @xmath37 .",
    "thus in the region of modular parameter @xmath17 where @xmath38 , the torus looks like a long and thin wire and one has @xmath39 . as @xmath5 , the massive states with @xmath40 give rise to exponentially suppressed contributions in the partition function ; only the massless modes propagate .",
    "creates an infrared divergence , that can simply be ignored here . ]",
    "since all states are now massless , the level matching condition is trivial and may be integrated out ; one ends up with a worldline loop of length @xmath41 .    in the range of complex moduli @xmath17 where @xmath42 stays of order @xmath43 ,",
    "the massive modes are not decoupled and dictate the uv behavior of the theory .",
    "we will see later that these tori , that are well known to generate the insertion of higher order operators and counter - terms in the supergravity effective action give rise to natural objects of tropical geometry .",
    "although there is no trivial integration of the phase dependence in this case , one can think of these phases as phases of complex numbers of vanishingly small modulus which are integrated out as well . to summarize ,",
    "the tropical limit is performed in two steps :    1 .",
    "( point - like limit ) send @xmath5 and distinguish between the contribution of massive states and massless states in the amplitudes , 2 .",
    "( level matching ) integrate out the phases of the complex numbers that are not vanishingly small to get the contributions of the massless states , and integrate out the regions of phase space where the complex numbers are vanishingly small to get the contributions of massive states .",
    "in the second part of the paper we shall revisit this well known technology that we just sketched in explicit amplitudes . before that , let us introduce a few mathematical notions about tropical geometry and the tropicalization of riemann surfaces .",
    "tropical geometry is a recent and very active field in mathematics . for an introduction to tropical geometry , see @xcite or for a more exhaustive bibliography see @xcite and references therein .",
    "the basic objects , tropical varieties , can be either abstract @xcite or defined as algebraic curves over certain spaces @xcite .",
    "tropical varieties also arise as the result of a worst possible degeneration of the complex structure of complex varieties , called tropicalization @xcite .",
    "this point is particularly interesting for our study of the point - like limit of string theory where string worldsheets ",
    "riemann surfaces  are degenerated to particle worldlines  tropical graphs .      in this section",
    "we introduce basic definitions about tropical graphs .",
    "an ( abstract ) tropical graph is a connected graph with labeled legs , whose inner edges have a length and whose vertices are weighted .",
    "the external legs are called punctures or marked points and by convention they have infinite length .",
    "a pure tropical graph is a tropical graph that has only vertices of weight zero .",
    "pure tropical graphs were first introduced in @xcite and then later extended by @xcite to tropical graphs with weights , simply called tropical graphs here .    a tropical graph @xmath44 is then a triple @xmath45 where @xmath15 is a connected graph called its combinatorial type , @xmath46 and @xmath6 are length and weight functions on the edges and on the vertices @xmath47 in these two equations , @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath50 are respectively the sets of inner edges , legs and vertices of the graph .",
    "the total weight @xmath51 of a tropical graph is the sum of all the weights of the vertices @xmath52 .",
    "the genus @xmath53 of a tropical graph @xmath45 , is the number of loops @xmath54 of @xmath15 plus its total weight @xmath55 hence the genus of a pure tropical graph is the number of loops of @xmath15 in the usual sense .",
    "moreover every vertex of weight zero should have valence at least three ( vertices with weight @xmath56 may be of arbitrary non zero valency ) .",
    "this automatically enforces a global stability condition for a given tropical graph of genus @xmath7 and @xmath8 punctures",
    ". one should have @xmath57 which is the exact analog of the classical stability condition . , and removes weight  @xmath58 bivalent vertices . physically , on the worldline , this equivalence relation is perfectly sensible , since no interpretation of these 1- or 2- valent vertices of weight zero seem obvious in the absence of external classical sources . ] below in figure [ fig : extropcurv ] are a few examples of tropical graphs .    . ]     + vertices weights obey the rules under degenerations called specializations pictured in the figure  [ fig : specializations ] .",
    "this gives another way to interpret vertices weights ; they _ keep track _ of degenerated loops .",
    "it is easily checked that the genus of a graph and the stability criterion are stable under specialization .",
    "finally , let us recall that a one - particle - irreducible ( 1pi ) graph is a graph that can not be disconnected by cutting one inner edge .",
    "a graph that can is called one - particle - reducible ( 1pr ) .",
    "physically , we will interpret tropical graphs as being worldlines swept by the propagation of a particle in space - time .",
    "the lengths of its edges correspond to schwinger proper times and a non zero weight on a vertex indicates the possible insertion of a counter - term in the graph .",
    "indeed , loops with very short proper times probe the ultraviolet ( uv ) region of the theory and it is natural to insert counter - terms on loops of zero size to regulate the uv .      in this paragraph , following closely @xcite , we introduce basic notions of tropical geometry that are the exact analog of the classical one ( that we shall recall later in section [ sec : class - riem - jac ] ) , such as abelian one forms , period matrices and jacobians . a little subtlety , absent in the classical case",
    "is linked to the fact that tropical graphs of identical genus may not have the same number of inner edges . for simplicity , here we shall only describe pure graphs and mention in the end how this could be generalized following @xcite .",
    "tropical graphs support an homology basis and corresponding one - forms .",
    "let @xmath44 be a pure tropical graph of genus @xmath7 and @xmath59 be a canonical homology basis of @xmath44 as in figure [ fig : canhomoltrop ] .    . ]",

    "+ _ example 1 .",

    "the period matrix @xmath78 of the 1pi graph a ) is given in , the period matrix of the 1pr graph b ) is just @xmath79 .",
    "thus , the jacobian description is blind to separating edges .",
    "the generalization of the previous discussion to the case of tropical graphs with weighted vertices depends on the approach one wants to use . in a simplistic approach",
    ", one simply `` forgets '' that there are weights on the vertices , and deal with a homology basis of size @xmath54 instead of @xmath53 ; in that case the same definitions can be applied straightforwardly .",
    "the issue with this approach is that the dimension of the jacobian drops under specialization . for a more complete approach which cures this problem ,",
    "see @xcite .",
    "the moduli space @xmath80 associated to a single tropical graph @xmath45 is the cone spanned by all of the lengths of its inner edges modulo the discrete automorphism group of the graph @xcite @xmath81 the moduli space of all genus @xmath7 , @xmath8-punctured tropical graphs is the space obtained from gluing all these cones together .",
    "the existence of such an object is still an open issue in mathematics , as everybody do not agree on the definition of tropical graph .",
    "however we will argue that the moduli space of tropical graphs , or tropical moduli space introduced in @xcite denoted @xmath9 is natural in the framework to study the point - like limit of string theory amplitudes .",

    "the quantities @xmath129 and the tensor @xmath374 are defined in @xcite in ( 7.4.56 ) and ( 7.4.42 ) respectively , we reproduce them here : @xmath375 schematically , @xmath376 writes as a polynomial in the kinematic invariants with coefficient made of scalar products between polarizations and momenta @xmath377 since @xmath378 , using multiple times the on - shell condition @xmath379 , the amplitude can be written as @xmath380 where the @xmath381 s are sums of terms like @xmath382 , etc . as the tensorial structure of this object is rather complicated , we will only focus ourselves on one particular term ; a contribution to @xmath383 . in the correlation function ,",
    "such a contribution comes from the following term : @xmath384 where we have used the conservation of momentum @xmath318 , the on - shell condition @xmath385 , and the expression of @xmath386 given in .",
    "it is now straightforward to check that the term corresponding to @xmath387 in the previous expression is accompanied with a factor of @xmath388 which cancels precisely the conformal factor from the @xmath389 ghosts integration and one ends up with the following integral @xmath390 the phase dependence of the integral is either pushed to @xmath337 terms or canceled due to level matching in the vicinity of @xmath258 .",
    "thus , we can integrate it out and recast the integral in its tropical form using the same change of variables as in and one gets the following contribution to the amplitude @xmath391 where @xmath392 is the @xmath250 dimensional coupling constant that appears in the einstein - hilbert action .",
    "other terms are generated in the exact same manner , by combinations of various massless poles ( even @xmath393 , despite that it has no explicit pole structure ) .",
    "the generalization to the @xmath8 point case is more subtle since there are @xmath83 non fixed points spanning @xmath305 .",
    "the trees with edges of finite lengths will be generated by similar regions of the moduli space where the points @xmath298 collides towards one another .",
    "the crucial step in the proof that we shall perform in @xcite is to build an explicit kp decomposition that produces the correct combinatorics of collapsing for the @xmath394 distinct trivalent trees .",
    "the technical aspects of the extraction of the point - like limit of genus one open and closed string theory amplitudes are well understood , and in this section , we shall recast in the tropical framework the older result on the subject .",
    "we first focus on the four - graviton type ii superstring amplitudes since we are ultimately interested in higher genus four - graviton amplitudes .",
    "that amplitude is a nice toy model to see how the tropical limiting procedure naturally generates the so called analytic and non analytic terms @xcite of the amplitudes along with the renormalization apparatus of counter - terms and give these a natural geometrical meaning .",
    "when this is done , we discuss the general @xmath8 point case and make connection with the previous section on tree - level amplitudes and discuss what regions of the string theory moduli space integral give rise to trees attached to the loop , following the analysis of @xcite .",
    "let us first recall some facts about genus one riemann surfaces .",
    "these are complex tori @xmath395 parametrized by a single complex modulus @xmath17 in the genus one siegel upper half - plane @xmath396 .",
    "modding out by the action of the modular group @xmath397 further restricts @xmath17 which eventually lies in an @xmath397 fundamental domain . a representative one that we will use",

    "we also recall that @xmath22 is defined by @xmath399 .",

    "if we now include the three moduli associated to the four punctures at distinct positions @xmath400 , @xmath401 where @xmath402 and @xmath403 fixed at @xmath404 , we can describe completely the moduli space @xmath405 over which our string theory amplitude is being integrated @xmath406 we start the analysis by the case of the four - graviton type ii amplitude in @xmath407 flat compact dimensions .",
    "this amplitude is known not to have pole because of supersymmetry , thus there will be no need to consider regions of the moduli space @xmath408 which could give rise to one - loop diagrams with trees attached to the loop .",
    "this will be justified _ a posteriori_. for this amplitude",
    "@xmath409 is particularly simple since it is reduced to the koba - nielsen factor @xmath410 where @xmath411 has been defined in the four - graviton tree analysis and the measure is given by @xmath412 the one - loop bosonic propagator writes @xmath413(\\zeta_i-\\zeta_j|\\tau)\\over \\partial_\\zeta \\theta\\left[1\\atop 1\\right](0|\\tau ) \\right|^2 + { \\pi ( \\im ( \\zeta_i-\\zeta_j))^2\\over 4\\im \\tau}\\ , , \\label{e : bosproptorus}\\ ] ] we can now start the tropicalization procedure , following the section [ sec : tropthm ] .",
    "first one focuses on the case of the torus alone , then punctures will be included .",
    "one wants to find a kp decomposition for @xmath279 . as @xmath22 is a local coordinate on the moduli space around the nodal curve at infinity , one would want to use it as in the section [ sec : tropicalizing ] .",
    "we saw in that to obtain a loop of finite size @xmath97 one had to set @xmath414 .",
    "this defines a family of tori parametrized by their modulus @xmath415 : @xmath416 the trouble with the previous scaling is that for @xmath417 , the real part can not be unrestricted in @xmath279 ; there is a region where @xmath22 is of order @xmath43 .",
    "hence , to build the kp decomposition , we follow @xcite and introduce by hand a parameter @xmath418 to split the fundamental domain into an upper part , the non - analytic cell @xmath419 and a lower part , the analytic cell @xmath420 and @xmath421 in @xcite . ]",

    "one still has to deal with the positions of the punctures .",
    "firstly , the splitting induces a similar decomposition of @xmath405 into two domains depending on @xmath429 , defined by the position of @xmath17 in @xmath279 @xmath430 then in @xmath431 , there is nothing to do since the positions of the punctures can be integrated out completely . in @xmath432",
    "however , it is well known since @xcite ( see also @xcite ) that to obtain a sensible result in the @xmath5 limit one should split the integration domain spanned the punctures into three regions , one for each inequivalent ordering of the graph . hence @xmath432 is split further into three disjoint domains depending on @xmath17 , labeled by the three inequivalent permutations under reversal symmetry @xmath433 defined by @xmath434 in all , we have the explicit kp decomposition @xmath435 where @xmath16 runs over the set @xmath436 .",
    "there is no complementary set @xmath262 because the integrand vanishes by supersymmetry on the regions of the moduli space where a tree splits off from the torus .",
    "thus there is no need to refine the decomposition to take into account vertex operators colliding to one another .    to show the conjecture [ conj : kptrop ] , we focus on the two regions separately and find a tropical form of the integrand .",
    "accordingly , we follow @xcite and define the two different parts of the amplitude , respectively upper and lower , or non - analytic and analytic : @xmath437 they should of course sum up to the complete amplitude .    in @xmath432 , we have already seen that for any @xmath425 one could define the family of complex tori . as for the punctures , in @xmath438 we define the following family of points : @xmath439 this scaling is not different as the one introduced in and used for trees in , provided that one remembers that @xmath440 does belong to a jacobian variety ( the complex torus ) .",
    "thus is linked to a point @xmath20 on the surface by the abel - jacobi map .",
    "considering that the the latter is reduced in the tropical limit to a logarithmic map , we realize that @xmath441 does satisfy .",
    "we will now recall a classical computation to see how the prime form at genus one gives rise to a tropical prime form , which explains why the expression for the tropical green function given in is correct .",
    "the explicit expression given in has the following @xmath22-expansion : @xmath442 which , in terms of @xmath415 , @xmath443 and @xmath444 becomes @xmath445 up to @xmath446 terms and where @xmath447 stands for @xmath448 . at leading order in @xmath1 ,",
    "the logarithm is equal to the absolute value of @xmath449 and one gets @xmath450 which is the well known worldline propagator on the circle derived in @xcite though with a different normalization . by plugging that result in @xmath409 one",
    "obtains @xmath451 where nothing depends anymore on the phases @xmath452 or @xmath453 .",
    "we can integrate them out and the measure becomes @xmath454 over the integration domains @xmath455 for instance in the ordering @xmath456 , the exponential factor writes explicitly @xmath457 which can be recognized to be the second symanzik polynomial of this graph .",
    "the first symanzik polynomial is simply @xmath97 .",
    "collecting all these results , one ends up with the following integral @xmath458 up to subleading corrections .",
    "this is nothing but the classical result of @xcite ; the splitting between the three domains @xmath459 produced the field theory four - graviton amplitude in a schwinger proper time form with loop proper time @xmath97 , written as a sum over the three inequivalent kinematical channels corresponding to the orderings .",
    "now one could drop the restriction @xmath460 and use dimensional regularization .",
    "however , to make the underlying tropical nature of the limit manifest , one should keep the hard uv cut - off @xmath461 . then in 10 dimensions , this integral has a power behaved uv divergence given by @xmath462 as already observed in @xcite , the full amplitude @xmath463 does not depend on @xmath429 , thus any non vanishing term in @xmath464 that depends on @xmath429 in the tropical limit should be canceled by the including contributions from the analytic cell . in particular , the divergence should be canceled by a counter - term coming from @xmath465 .",
    "the functions in the exponential factor are continuous on @xmath466 , which is a compact space , thus according to the discussion in section [ sec : cells ] one may interchange the @xmath5 limit and the integration which amounts to setting the exponential factor to one .",
    "the entire integration over the @xmath467 s is now trivial and one is left with an integral that can be computed straight away : @xmath468 this integral provides two physically distinct contributions ; @xmath469 and @xmath470 .",
    "the first is the so called analytic part of the amplitude . after going from the string frame to the einstein frame ,",
    "it is solely expressed in terms of gravitational quantities and is the leading order contribution of higher order operators in the effective action of supergravity .",
    "the second is the counter - term required to cancel the leading uv divergence . from the tropical point of view , this integral may be thought of as a being localized at the singular point @xmath98 of the tropical moduli space which corresponds to a graph with a vertex of weight one .",
    "we can now sum up and to obtain the field theory amplitude written a as integral over the full tropical moduli space @xmath428 .",
    "it is regularized by the inclusion of a counter - term the point @xmath98 of the moduli space .",
    "pictorially , the figure [ fig : fundtorusl ] summarizes this discussion .        in the general case , @xmath471 acquires a possibly complicated structure and one often has to perform a fourier - jacobi expansion of @xmath472 in terms of @xmath22 or @xmath473 ( see @xcite and more recently for instance @xcite for heterotic string computations ) .",
    "although these term would seem subleading  as they are exponentially suppressed when @xmath474  the worldsheet realization of generic models with non maximal supersymmetry is based on altering the gso projection which eventually results in the appearance of `` poles '' in @xmath475 and @xmath476 . in all consistent models these poles are automatically either compensated by terms of the fourier - jacobi expansion or killed by real part integration ( step 2 ) of @xmath477 via @xmath478 if @xmath479 . in the bosonic string",
    "they are not , and this makes the theory inconsistent at loop level .",
    "let us explicit the general form of the kp decomposition for @xmath8 point amplitudes from the detailed construction of @xcite .",
    "there are now @xmath480 domains @xmath459 for @xmath481 defined exactly as in that generate 1pi tropical graphs with orderings @xmath16 . in this previous analysis",
    "we did not have to deal with regions in the moduli space where points collide to one another because supersymmetry told us that no such regions may contribute in this four point example .",
    "however , in general one has to include them for both physical reasons ( because we know that there are contact terms in generic amplitudes ) and mathematical reasons ( because the tropical moduli space do naturally include regions corresponding to separating degenerations in @xmath482 ) .",
    "hence we refine the previous definition of the kp cells @xmath459 and define new cells @xmath483 and @xmath484 where the open discs @xmath485 have been cut out have to be small enough compared to @xmath429 so that @xmath486 is non - empty . typically @xmath487 . ] .",
    "then , the complementary set of the union of the previous domains in @xmath488 is made of domains of the form @xmath489 where @xmath490 indicates the ordering of @xmath491 points on the future loop while @xmath492 points are grouped into one or more discs of radius @xmath46 centered around one or more of the first @xmath491 points .",
    "to finish the description of the kp decomposition , one has to deal with these clusters of points .",
    "locally , such a cluster of @xmath493 points on a disc of radius @xmath46 looks like a sphere .",
    "thus as in the tree level analysis , @xmath494 is split it into @xmath495 domains corresponding to the @xmath495 combinatorially distinct trees .",
    "note the shift @xmath496 compared to the tree level case due to the fact that such trees with @xmath493 external legs have one additional leg attached to the loop .",
    "at this point , one could basically conclude the by invoking the `` bern - kosower '' rules @xcite which would yield the desired tropical form of the one - loop amplitude .",
    "the previous analysis is more a formal illustration of the tropical features of the limit rather than an explicit method for writing down one - loop field theory amplitudes .",
    "let us then be brief , and consider for simplicity a cluster of two points , where @xmath497 is treated like before and @xmath467 collides to @xmath497 according to @xmath498 where @xmath497 is fixed , @xmath87 is the future tropical length of the tree connecting legs @xmath170 and @xmath499 to the loop as in the tree level analysis and @xmath46 is an ir cut - off .",
    "in this simple example , there is no outer region @xmath262 as in and the kp decomposition is built . as concerns the tropical form of the integrand and the proposition [ prop : sym ] one has to look at @xmath500 . for simplicity , we work in a representation of @xmath471 where all double derivatives of the propagator have been integrated out by parts . using the general short distance behavior of the propagator on a generic riemann surface @xmath501",
    "one sees that @xmath502 gives a term @xmath503 while any term of the form @xmath504 is turned into a @xmath505 at leading order in @xmath1 : @xmath506 the factor @xmath507 provides a contact term via a pole in the amplitude if and only if @xmath357 contains a factor of the form @xmath508 exactly as in the tree level analysis .",
    "then in @xmath357 any @xmath467-dependent term is replaced by a @xmath497 at the leading order in @xmath337 .",
    "a similar tree analysis can be performed in the region @xmath509 where we have to include the contributions of poles . to conclude",
    ", we have shown that the existing results about the low energy limit of one - loop string theory amplitude show a complete correspondence between the string theory integration over @xmath510 and its field theory point - like limit which can be expressed as an integral over the tropical moduli space @xmath511 .",
    "zero to four point two - loop amplitudes in type ii and heterotic string have been worked out completely in @xcite together with an @xmath29-point prescription .",
    "the four - graviton amplitude have also been derived using the pure spinor formalism @xcite and shown in @xcite to be equivalent to the rns computation .",
    "however no point - like limit have been explicitly extracted from these result . in @xcite , the four - graviton two - loop amplitude in maximal supergravity in field theory of @xcite",
    "was written in a worldline form resembling the string theory integral . in this section ,",
    "our goal is to prove rigorously that the tropical limit of the string theory integrand does match this result by making use of the tropical machinery that we have developed .",
    "let us recall some facts about genus two riemann surfaces . at genus two",
    "( and three ) , there is no schottky problem , thus all jacobian varieties correspond to a riemann surface ; the moduli space of genus two riemann surfaces is in one to one correspondence with the moduli space of jacobian varieties .",
    "we have already seen in section [ sec : tropgeom ] that jacobian varieties are defined by @xmath65 matrices , elements of the siegel upper half - plane @xmath122 .",
    "we obtain a fundamental domain @xmath512 by modding out @xmath513 by the action of the modular group @xmath514 .",
    "this space has a complicated structure and can be defined by a certain number of inequalities similar to the one defining @xmath279 at genus one , see for instance @xcite . we choose a canonical homology basis @xmath101 as in figure [ fig : canhomolsurf ] with normalized holomorphic one forms .",
    "the period matrix @xmath127 is parametrized by three complex moduli @xmath515 and",
    "@xmath516 : @xmath517 the two - loop amplitude in 10 dimensions then writes @xcite @xmath518 where @xmath519 denotes integration over the surface @xmath100 of the position of the four punctures .",
    "the quantity @xmath520 arises from several contributions in the rns computation and from fermionic zero modes in the pure spinor formalism  @xcite .",
    "it writes @xmath521 with @xmath522 thus , @xmath523 is a top form for @xmath524 .",
    "note that integrating @xmath525 instead of @xmath526 is very similar to the one - loop case where we had @xmath527 .",
    "indeed , the abel - jacobi map @xmath132 defined in defines the coordinates @xmath440 of the jacobian variety by @xmath528 , thus @xmath529 .",
    "hence , in the genus two amplitude we can identify a measure and an integrand as follows @xmath530 where the numerator factor @xmath531 is again trivial .",
    "we want to use our knowledge of the mechanisms of the tropical limit to be able to compute the point - like limit of these expressions the non - analytic kp cells .",
    "this region is of particular interest as it gives rise to the ( unrenormalized ) field theory result at two loops .",
    "there should be two types non - analytic kp cells giving rise to the two pure graphs of figure [ fig : gen2graphs ] .",
    "however , we can discard right away 1pr diagrams , since there are no terms of the form @xmath532 at leading order in @xmath1 in the integrand necessary for massless poles to appear .",
    "therefore the only graph @xmath44 that one can obtain in the non analytic region is the `` sunset graph '' a ) of the figure [ fig : gen2graphs ] .",
    "the kp cell where we want to study the amplitude is precisely the one of the figure [ fig : loccoordgen2 ] where the period matrices of the degenerating curves are written in terms of the local coordinates @xmath533 , @xmath534 and @xmath535 , we recall it here : @xmath536 thus , keeping the parameters @xmath537 fixed , the curves are collapsing on the tropical graph of figure [ fig : jacgen2 ] with inner lengths @xmath153 and period matrix @xmath538 defined in .",
    "let us remark that it could also be possible to use the parameters @xmath539 defined from the period matrix representation as local parameters on @xmath540 around the singularity corresponding to the graph of figure [ fig : jacgen2 ] .",
    "granted that we consider a family of jacobians such that @xmath541 for @xmath401 , at the first order in the @xmath542- or fourier - jacobi expansion one has @xmath543 ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* eq 4.6 ) for an explicit relation between the schottky representation and the @xmath542 parameters in the case of the genus two open string worldsheet ) .",
    "it should be emphasized that this relation holds only here in genus two ( and would possibly hold in genus three ) because there is no schottky problem . in higher genus",
    ", one should proceed as explained before .",
    "the question of the exact boundaries of this kp cell is more intricate , let us try to constrain it .",
    "reasoning backwards , one wants to be sure to exclude regions of the tropical moduli space where a loop degenerates to zero size , to avoid the regulation of any divergence by massive stringy modes ( primary and sub divergences ) . this can be translated in terms of a uv cut - off @xmath461 where @xmath544 by the inequalities @xmath545 , @xmath546 and @xmath547 .",
    "therefore , it seems that the kp cell might be defined by translating these inequalities to the imaginary parts of the parameters @xmath477 , @xmath42 and @xmath516 using the scaling according to @xmath548 , @xmath549 and @xmath550 .",
    "it would be interesting to check precisely this point with explicit computations .",
    "let us now write the tropical limit of @xmath551 .",
    "the tropical limit of the holomorphic one - forms gives was called @xmath552 in @xcite ] @xmath553 this tropical version of @xmath554 can only take values in @xmath555 , depending on the positions of the legs @xmath170 and @xmath499 .",
    "more precisely , one has @xmath556 then the tropical form of @xmath551 is immediately obtained : @xmath557 it is a function of the positions of the four vertex operators on the graph . using the form of @xmath558 that we just derived , we first see that @xmath559 vanishes for any configuration where three or four points lie on the same edge of the graph . in all other cases ,",
    "it is given by @xmath560 let us mention that @xmath561 does not depend on the positions of the punctures and is easily seen to be the usual form of the first symanzik polynomial of the sunset graph .",
    "this achieves the study of the tropicalization of the integration measure .",
    "the last thing to do is to compute the tropical representation of , which was already done in where , upon the assumption that the worldline green function of @xcite is recovered in the tropical limit the result was stated for arbitrary genus .",
    "we then obtain @xmath562 where @xmath563 is a global normalization factor , @xmath564 represents the integration of the positions of the four punctures on the graph and @xmath565 represents a possible choice for the boundaries of the tropicalized kp cell described before .",
    "this object coincides with the one derived in ( * ? ? ?",
    "2.12 ) from the two - loop field theory computation of @xcite , thus it is the two - loop unrenormalized four - graviton amplitude .    to continue the procedure and remove the sub divergences and the primary divergence ( when there are some ) , one should include in the analysis the regions of the moduli space giving rise to tropical graphs with weighted vertices .",
    "for instance the region where @xmath566 would yield the insertion of a counter - term in the loop of the homology cycle @xmath567 to cancel a potential sub - divergence , etc .",
    "those computations would illustrate the systematics of renormalization in the tropicalization procedure in the presence of subdivergences and one should match the field theory computations of @xcite .",
    "the extension of the previous computation to more complicated amplitudes , for instance the genus two four - graviton scattering in heterotic string of this method is a more challenging task .",
    "it should be based , as explained in @xcite on a fourier - jacobi expansion of the string integrand in the parameters @xmath542 .",
    "extracting precisely the tropical form of the integrand as we have done here would be a very interesting thing to do .",
    "the material presented in this paper is in the vein of the active and fast recent developments undergone by the domain of string theory scattering amplitudes , stimulated by the introduction of new mathematical structures for instance in the automorphic form program @xcite or the analysis of the structure of the supermoduli space @xcite or the systematic study of multiple zeta values in the @xmath1 expansion of tree level string amplitudes @xcite and a lot more @xcite .",
    "these interactions between physics and mathematics have yielded significant advances in both domains and we hope that the present work might raise similar curiosity . as a matter of fact",
    ", several restrictions have been made to the scope of this work during the text , that call for further developments .",
    "first of all , let us recap what we wanted to prove in this paper and what we did not prove .",
    "we have proved that the string theory integral , once split up according to the kp decomposition provides in kp each cell an integral that has the exact same structure as the expected feynman integral , over the graph with the correct topology ( upon assuming that the conjecture [ conj : trope ] that we did not prove ) . by structure ,",
    "we mean `` denominator '' or equivalently , first and second symanzik polynomials .",
    "however , we did not prove that the result of the integration matches automatically the result obtained from feynman rules .",
    "this is a totally separate issue .",
    "however , we gave some details about how one should proceed to extract the tropical numerator ( in particular in genus two ) , which , by assuming that string theory provides the correct answers , can be considered as a first step towards a map between string theory and field theory numerators .",
    "more generally , it should be noted that we did not study at all the open string . in the works",
    "@xcite , some detailed analysis were performed concerning the field theory limit of open string amplitudes at the one- and two - loop level , using the so called schottky parametrization of riemann surfaces .",
    "an extension to the open string of our discussion will inevitably be inspired by these works .",
    "then , we considered only superstring theory amplitudes that can be written as integrals over the ordinary moduli space of riemann surfaces .",
    "however , as recently emphasized in the series of papers @xcite it is not possible in general to consistently reduce the original integrals over the full supermoduli space of super riemann surfaces to integrals over @xmath14 . in particular for genera @xmath225 , this is certainly not true anymore , thus our procedure will have to be upgraded to describe these cases .",
    "the authors of @xcite provided a very interesting analysis in that direction as they studied the field theory limit of a super schottky parametrization for super riemann surfaces , still in the open string setting .",
    "as concerns the closed string , a super analog of tropical geometry has not been studied yet , though it would be an extremely interesting subject .",
    "another point to elucidate is the role of the feynman @xmath568 prescription in the tropicalization procedure .",
    "this issue has been recently analyzed in @xcite where a solution to this issue was explained , but using a different approach compared to ours .",
    "understanding how to it translate systematically in the tropical language would definitely be very interesting .",
    "as concerns mathematics , a practical understanding of the theory of tropical theta functions and their links with ordinary ones is a crucial element for the definition of the tropical prime form . in order to be able to compute more general tropical amplitudes , the tropicalization procedure should also be extended at the next - to - leading order in multi - loop amplitudes in the fourier - jacobi expansion ( @xmath542- or @xmath151-expansion ) of the various quantities in the tropical limit .",
    "for instance the @xmath5 limit of the four - graviton genus two heterotic string amplitude of @xcite approached in @xcite has not be pushed further because of those issues .",
    "last , but not least , an elaborate mathematical construction has been provided in @xcite , aiming at giving a rigorous functorial description of the links between @xmath14 and @xmath9 , using an underlying berkovich analytic geometry .",
    "it would be very interesting to recast our construction , and in particular the use of the kp decomposition of @xmath14 , following these concepts .",
    "i would like to acknowledge discussions with several physicists and mathematicians over the last year .",
    "first , let me thank samuel grushevsky for bringing to my knowledge the existence of tropical geometry in the context of degeneration of complex varieties , as well as for inspiring discussions on this project .",
    "i would also like to thank ilia itenberg and erwan brugall as well as yan soibelman and francis brown for useful discussions and remarks .",
    "i am also very grateful to iosif bena , guillaume bossard , michael green , carlos mafra , stefano massai , alexander ochirov , oliver schlotterer and kelly stelle for many discussions and remarks , and especially to pierre vanhove for several discussions on the low energy limit of string theory and comments on the manuscript .",
    "finally i am grateful to the organizers of the cargse summer school 2012 where this work was initiated , to those of the hamburg summer school 2013 `` moduli spaces in algebraic geometry and physics '' where parts of this work were achieved and to the damtp and the niels bohr international academy for hospitality at several stages of this work .",
