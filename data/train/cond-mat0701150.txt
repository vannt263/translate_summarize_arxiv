    "<S> vortex breaking has been traditionally studied for nonuniform critical current densities , although it may also appear due to nonuniform pinning force distributions . in this article </S>",
    "<S> we study the case of a high - pinning / low - pinning / high - pinning layered structure . </S>",
    "<S> we have developed an elastic model for describing the deformation of a vortex in these systems in the presence of a uniform transport current density @xmath0 for any arbitrary orientation of the transport current and the magnetic field . if @xmath0 is above a certain critical value , @xmath1 , the vortex breaks and a finite effective resistance appears . </S>",
    "<S> our model can be applied to some experimental configurations where vortex breaking naturally exists . </S>",
    "<S> this is the case for yba@xmath2cu@xmath3o@xmath4 ( ybco ) low angle grain boundaries and films on vicinal substrates , where the breaking is experienced by abrikosov - josephson vortices ( ajv ) and josephson string vortices ( sv ) , respectively . with our model </S>",
    "<S> , we have experimentally extracted some intrinsic parameters of the ajv and sv , such as the line tension @xmath5 and compared it to existing predictions based on the vortex structure . </S>"
