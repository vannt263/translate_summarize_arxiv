    "_ currents _ are standard objects studied in geometric measure theory , and are named so by analogy with electrical currents that have a kind of magnitude and direction at every point .",
    "intuitively , one could think of currents as generalized surfaces with orientations and multiplicities .",
    "the mathematical machinery of currents has been used to tackle many fundamental questions in geometric analysis , such as the ones related to area minimizing surfaces , isoperimetric problems , and soap - bubble conjectures @xcite .",
    "we restrict our attention to currents with integer multiplicities .",
    "the _ mass _ @xmath0 of a current @xmath1-dimensional current @xmath2 can be thought of intuitively as the weighted @xmath1-dimensional volume of the generalized object represented by @xmath2 .",
    "for instance , the mass of a @xmath3-dimensional current can be taken as the area of the surface it represents .",
    "the _ flat norm _ of a @xmath1-dimensional current @xmath2 is given by @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the set of @xmath1-dimensional currents with compact support and integer multiplicities .",
    "one also uses flat norm to measure the `` distance '' between two @xmath1-currents .",
    "more precisely , the flat norm distance between two @xmath1-currents @xmath2 and @xmath6 is given by @xmath7 morgan and vixie @xcite showed that the @xmath8 total variation functional ( @xmath8tv ) introduced by chan and esedoglu @xcite computes the flat norm for boundaries @xmath2 with integer multiplicity .",
    "given this correspondence , and the use of _ scale _ in @xmath8tv , morgan and vixie defined @xcite the flat norm with scale @xmath9 of an oriented @xmath1-dimensional set @xmath2 as @xmath10 where @xmath11 varies over oriented @xmath12-dimensional sets , and @xmath13 is the @xmath1-dimensional volume , used in place of mass .",
    "figure [ fig:1dcurrent ] illustrates this definition .",
    "flat norm of the 1d current @xmath2 is given by the sum of the length of the resulting oriented curve @xmath14 ( shown separated from the input curve for clarity ) and the area of the 2d patch @xmath11 shown in red .",
    "large values of @xmath15 , above the curvature of both humps in the curve @xmath2 , preserve both humps .",
    "values of @xmath15 between the two curvatures eliminate the hump on the right .",
    "even smaller values `` smooth out '' both humps as illustrated here , giving a more `` flat '' curve , as @xmath11 can now be comprised of much bigger 2d patches .",
    "figure [ fig:1dcurrent ] illustrates the utility of flat norm for deblurring or smoothing applications , e.g. , in 3d terrain maps or 3d image denoising .",
    "but efficient methods for computing flat norm are known only for certain types of currents in two dimensions . for @xmath16 , under the setting where @xmath2 is a boundary , i.e. , a loop , embedded in @xmath17 and the minimizing surface @xmath18 as well , the flat norm could be calculated efficiently , for instance , using graph cut methods @xcite  see the work of goldfarb and yin @xcite and vixie et al .",
    "@xcite , and references therein . motivated by applications in image analysis , these approaches usually worked with a grid representation of the underlying space ( @xmath17 ) .",
    "pixels in the image readily provide such a representation .    while it is computationally convenient that @xmath8tv minimizers give us the scaled flat norm for the input images , this approach restricts us to currents that are boundaries of codimension 1 .",
    "correspondingly , the calculation of flat norm for @xmath19-boundaries embedded in higher dimensional spaces , e.g. , @xmath20 , or for input curves that are not necessarily boundaries has not received much attention so far .",
    "similarly , flat norm calculations for higher dimensional input sets have also not been well - studied .",
    "such situations often appear in practice  for instance , consider the case of an input set @xmath2 that is a curve sitting on a manifold embedded in @xmath20 , with choices for @xmath11 restricted to this manifold as well .",
    "further , computational complexity of calculating flat norm in arbitrary dimensions has not been studied .",
    "but this is not a surprising observation , given the continuous , rather than combinatorial , setting in which flat norm computation has been posed so far .",
    "simplicial complexes that triangulate the input space are often used as representations of manifolds .",
    "such representations use triangular or tetrahedral meshes @xcite as opposed to the uniform square or cubical grid meshes in @xmath17 and @xmath20 .",
    "various simplicial complexes are often used to represent data ( in any dimension ) that captures interactions in a broad sense , e.g. , the vietoris  rips complex to capture coverage of coordinate - free sensor networks @xcite .",
    "it is natural to consider flat norm calculations in such settings of simplicial complexes for denoising or regularizing sets , or for other similar tasks . at the same time , requiring that the simplicial complex be embedded in high dimensional space modeled by regular square grids may be cumbersome , and computationally prohibitive in many cases .",
    "we define a _ simplicial _ flat norm ( sfn ) for an input set @xmath2 given as a subcomplex of the finite oriented simplicial complex @xmath21 triangulating the set , or underlying space @xmath22 .",
    "more generally , @xmath2 is the simplicial representation of a rectifiable current with integer multiplicities .",
    "the choices of the higher dimensional sets @xmath11 are restricted to @xmath21 as well .",
    "we extend this definition to the multiscale simplicial flat norm ( msfn ) by including a scale parameter @xmath15 .",
    "sfn is thus a special case of msfn with the default value of @xmath23 .",
    "this discrete setting lets us address the worst case complexity of computing flat norm .",
    "given its combinatorial nature , one would expect the problem to be difficult in arbitrary dimensions .",
    "indeed , we show the problem of computing msfn is np - complete by reducing the optimal bounding chain problem ( obcp ) , which was recently shown to be np - complete @xcite , to a special case of the msfn problem .",
    "we cast the problem of finding the optimal @xmath11 , and thus calculating msfn , as an integer linear programming ( ilp ) problem .",
    "given that the original problem is np - complete , instances of this ilp could be hard to solve . utilizing recent work @xcite on the related optimal homologous chain problem ( ohcp )",
    ", we provide conditions on @xmath21 under which this ilp problem can in fact be solved in polynomial time . in particular , msfn can be computed in polynomial time when @xmath2 is @xmath1-dimensional , and @xmath21 is @xmath12-dimensional and orientable , for all @xmath24 .",
    "a similar result holds for the case when @xmath2 is @xmath1-dimensional , and @xmath21 is @xmath12-dimensional and embedded in @xmath25 , for all @xmath24 .",
    "our most significant contribution is the _ simplicial deformation theorem _ ( theorem [ thm : simpldeform ] ) , which states that given an arbitrary @xmath1-current in @xmath26 ( underlying space ) , we are assured of an approximating current in the @xmath1-skeleton of @xmath21 .",
    "this result is a substantial modification and generalization of the classical deformation theorem for currents on to square grids .",
    "our deformation theorem explicitly specifies the dependence of the bounds of approximation on the regularity and size of the simplices in the simplicial complex .",
    "hence it is immediate from the theorem that as we refine the simplicial complex @xmath21 while preserving the bounds on simplicial regularity , the flat norm distance between an arbitrary @xmath1-current in @xmath26 and its deformation onto the @xmath1-skeleton of @xmath21 vanishes .",
    "the problem of computing msfn is closely related to two other problems on chains defined on simplicial complexes  the optimal homologous chain problem ( ohcp ) and the optimal bounding chain problem ( obcp ) . given a @xmath1-chain @xmath27 of the simplicial complex @xmath21 , the ohcp is to find a @xmath1-chain @xmath28 that is homologous to @xmath27 such that @xmath29 is minimal . in the obcp",
    ", we are given a @xmath1-chain @xmath27 of @xmath21 , and the goal is to find a @xmath12-chain @xmath30 of @xmath21 whose boundary is @xmath27 and @xmath31 is minimal .",
    "the obcp is closely related to the problem of finding an area - minimizing surface with a given boundary @xcite .",
    "computing the msfn could be viewed , in a simple sense , as combining the objectives of the corresponding ohcp and obcp instances , with the scale factor determining the relative importance of one objective over the other .",
    "when @xmath27 is a cycle and the homology is defined over @xmath32 , chen and freedman showed that ohcp is np - hard @xcite .",
    "dey , hirani , and krishnamoorthy @xcite studied the original version of ohcp with homology defined over @xmath33 , and showed that the problem is in fact solvable in polynomial time when @xmath21 satisfies certain conditions ( when it has no relative torsion ) .",
    "recently , dunfield and hirani @xcite have shown that the ohcp with homology defined over @xmath33 is np - complete .",
    "we will use their results to show that the problem of computing msfn is np - complete ( see section [ ssec : npcompmsfn ] ) .",
    "these authors also showed that the obcp with homology defined over @xmath33 is np - complete as well .",
    "their result builds on the previous work of agol , hass , and thurston @xcite , who showed that the knot genus problem is np - complete , and a slightly different version of the least area surface problem is np - hard .    the standard simplicial approximation theorem from algebraic topology describes how continuous maps are approximated by simplicial maps that satisfy the star condition @xcite .",
    "our simplicial deformation theorem applies to currents , which are more general objects than continuous maps .",
    "more importantly , we present explicit bounds on the expansion of mass of the current resulting from simplicial approximation . in his phd thesis ,",
    "sullivan @xcite considered deforming currents on to the boundary of convex sets in a cell complex , which are more general than the simplices we work with .",
    "but simplicial complexes admit efficient algorithms more naturally than cell complexes .",
    "we adopt a different approach for deformation than sullivan .",
    "more significantly , our bounds on approximation are much smaller than the ones presented by sullivan ( see section [ ssec : compbnds ] ) . along with msfn ,",
    "our deformation theorem also establishes how the ohcp and obcp could be used on general continuous inputs by taking simplicial approximations , thus expanding widely the applicability of this family of techniques to real - life data .",
    "consider a finite @xmath34-dimensional simplicial complex @xmath21 triangulating the set @xmath22 , where the simplices are oriented , with @xmath35 .",
    "the set @xmath2 is defined as the integer multiple of an oriented @xmath1-dimensional subcomplex of @xmath21 , representing a rectifiable @xmath1-current with integer multiplicity .",
    "let @xmath36 and @xmath37 be the number of @xmath1- and @xmath12-dimensional simplices in @xmath21 , respectively .",
    "the set @xmath2 is then represented by the @xmath1-chain @xmath38 , where @xmath39 are all @xmath1-simplices in @xmath21 and @xmath40 are the corresponding _",

    "<S> we study the multiscale simplicial flat norm ( msfn ) problem , which computes flat norm at various scales of sets defined as oriented subcomplexes of finite simplicial complexes in arbitrary dimensions . </S>",
    "<S> we show that msfn is np - complete when homology is defined over integers . </S>",
    "<S> we cast msfn as an instance of integer linear optimization . </S>",
    "<S> following recent results on related problems , the msfn integer program can be solved in polynomial time by solving its linear programming relaxation , when the simplicial complex satisfies a simple topological condition ( absence of relative torsion ) . </S>",
    "<S> our most significant contribution is the _ simplicial deformation theorem _ , which states that one may approximate a general current with a simplicial current while bounding the expansion of its mass . </S>",
    "<S> we present explicit bounds on the quality of this approximation , which indicate that the simplicial current gets closer to the original current as we make the simplicial complex finer . </S>",
    "<S> msfn opens up the possibilities of using flat norm to denoise or extract scale information of large data sets in arbitrary dimensions . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> it allows one to employ the large body of algorithmic results on simplicial complexes to address more general problems related to currents . </S>"
