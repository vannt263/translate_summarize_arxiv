    "quantum mechanics ( qm ) is a very successful theory .",
    "it has solved many physical mysteries in both macroscopic superconductivity and microscopic particles . still , laboratory studies of its conceptual foundation and interpretation continue to attract much attention .",
    "one of the most important examples is the well - known einstein - podolsky - rosen ( epr )  paradox \" , concerning the completeness of qm . based on a _ gedanken",
    "_ experiment , einstein , podolsky and rosen ( epr ) claimed  @xcite that qm is incomplete and that so - called  hidden variables \" should exist .",
    "this is because a two - particle quantum system might be prepared in a correlated ( i.e. , entangled ) state , even though the two particles are spatially separated by a large distance and without any direct interaction .",
    "a measurement performed on one of the particles immediately changes the state ( and thus the possible physical outcome ) of the other particle .",
    "this  paradox \" leads to much subsequent , and still on - going , researches .",
    "bell proposed  @xcite an experimentally testable inequality to examine the existence of the hidden variables : if this inequality is violated , then there are no so - called local  hidden variables \" , and thus quantum mechanical predication of existing quantum non - local correlations ( i.e. , entanglement ) is sustained .    during the past decades ,",
    "a number of interesting experiments  @xcite using entangled photon pairs have been proposed and carried out to investigate the two - particle non - local correlations .",
    "these experiments showed that bell s inequality ( bi ) could be strongly violated , and agreed with quantum mechanical predictions . yet , one of the essential loopholes in these optical experiments is that the required epr pairs were probabilistically generated in a small subset of all photons created in certain spontaneous processes .",
    "thus , it is necessary to study two - particle entanglement in different , e.g. , massive or macroscopic systems , instead of fast - escaping photons .",
    "expectably , the epr pairs between these massive  particles \" can be deterministically prepared .",
    "theoretical proposals include those with e.g. , neutral kaons  @xcite , rydberg atoms  @xcite , ballistic electrons in semiconductors  @xcite , and trapped ions  @xcite .",
    "experimentally , two rydberg atoms had been first entangled to form epr pair in a high @xmath0 cavity by the exchange of a single photon  @xcite .",
    "later , by exchanging the quanta of the common vibrational mode , epr correlations with ultralong lifetime ( e.g. , up to @xmath1 microsecond ) had been generated between a pair of trapped cold ions  @xcite .",
    "consequently , violations of bi have been experimentally verified with the epr correlations between either the two ions  @xcite , or an atom and a photon  @xcite .",
    "recent developments of quantum manipulation in coupled josephson systems  @xcite allow to experimentally investigate the quantum correlations between two macroscopic degrees of freedom in a superconducting nano - electronic device  @xcite .",
    "proposals have been made for producing quantum entanglement between two superconducting qubits , e.g. , indirectly coupled by sequentially interacting with a current - biased information bus  @xcite , coupled inductively  @xcite , and coupled via either a cavity mode  @xcite or a large josephson junction  @xcite . by introducing an effective",
    "dynamical decoupled approach , we have shown  @xcite that the bi could also be tested with superconducting qubits , even if the interaction between them is fixed .",
    "the robustness of the scheme proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite is better suited for weak interbit couplings , e.g. , when the ratio of the interbit - coupling energy @xmath2 and the josephson energy @xmath3 of the qubit is small . in this paper , for _ an arbitrary interbit coupling _ strength , we discuss how to prepare the epr correlations , i.e. , deterministically generate and tomographically measure the well - known epr - bell ( or bell ) states : @xmath4 in a capacitively coupled josephson circuit .",
    "its possible application to directly test the epr paradox is also discussed .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , a few elementary quantum operations are proposed to deterministically manipulate two charge qubits coupled capacitively .",
    "some of them only evolve a selected qubit and leave the remaining one unaffected .",
    "these operations are not strictly single - qubit gates ( just _ conditional _ single - qubit operations ) , as the rotation of the selected qubit depends on the state of the other qubit . by making use of these operations , in sec .",
    "iii , we propose a two - step approach to deterministically generate the epr pairs from the circuit s ground state @xmath5 .",
    "further , we discuss how to experimentally confirm the generation of epr pairs by tomographic measurements . in sec .",
    "iv , considering the existence of typical voltage - noises and @xmath6-noise , we numerically analyze the decays of the prepared epr correlations within the bloch - redfield formalism  @xcite . in sec .",
    "v , we discuss the possibility of testing bi with the generated epr pairs . conclusions and discussions are given in sec .",
    "we consider the two - qubit nano - circuit sketched in fig .",
    "1 , which is similar to that in recent experiment  @xcite .     and external magnetic fluxes @xmath7 ( threading the squid loops ) . @xmath8 and @xmath9 ( dashed line parts ) read out the final qubit states.,width=514 ]    two superconducting quantum interference device ( squid ) loops with controllable josephson energies produce two cooper - pair boxes , fabricated a small distance apart  @xcite ) and coupled via the capacitance @xmath10 .",
    "the hamiltonian of the circuit reads @xmath11 + e_m\\prod_{j=1}^2(\\hat{n}_j - n_{g_j}),\\ ] ] in the charge basis . here ,",
    "the excess cooper - pair number operator @xmath12 and phase operator @xmath13 in the @xmath14th box are conjugate : @xmath15=i\\delta_{jk}$ ] .",
    "@xmath16 and @xmath17 are the charging and josephson energies of the @xmath14th box .",
    "@xmath18 is the coupling energy between the boxes . above",
    ", @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the josephson energy of the single - junction and the sum of all capacitances connected to the @xmath14th box , respectively . also , @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "@xmath23 is the electron charge and @xmath24 the flux quantum .",
    "the circuit works in the charge regime with @xmath25 , wherein quasi - particle tunnelling and excitation are effectively suppressed and the number @xmath26(with @xmath27 ) of cooper - pairs in the @xmath14th boxe is a good quantum number . here ,",
    "@xmath28 , and @xmath29 are the boltzmann constant , temperature , superconducting gap , and maximal josephson energies of the @xmath14th cooper - pair box , respectively .    following refs .",
    "@xcite , the dynamics of the system near the co - resonance point ( where @xmath30 ) can be effectively restricted to the subspace @xmath31 spanned by only the four lowest charge states : @xmath32+e_{12}\\,\\sigma _ { z}^{(1)}\\sigma _ { z}^{(2)},\\ ] ] with @xmath33 , and @xmath34 .",
    "the pesudospin operators are defined as @xmath35 and @xmath36 . here , the subindex @xmath14 ( or @xmath37 ) is introduced to label the state of the @xmath14th ( or @xmath37th ) qubit . for example",
    ", @xmath38 refers to the logic state of the @xmath14th qubit is  0 \" . for simplicity ,",
    "the subindexes in a two - qubit state @xmath39 ( with @xmath40 ) are omitted , and @xmath41 ( @xmath42 ) usually ( except when indicated otherwise ) refers to the state @xmath43(@xmath44 ) of the first ( second ) qubit .",
    "obviously , the interbit - coupling energy @xmath33 is determined by the coupling capacitance @xmath45 and therefore is fixed by fabrication , i.e. , not controllable .",
    "however , @xmath46 and @xmath47 can be controlled by adjusting the applied gate - voltages @xmath48 and fluxes @xmath49 , respectively .",
    "although any evolution of this two - qubit system is solvable and can be expressed by a @xmath50 matrix in the subspace @xmath31 , we prefer certain relatively simple quantum operations by properly setting the above controllable parameters to conveniently engineer arbitrary quantum states .",
    "these operations are summarized in the following three subsections .",
    "first , we assume the circuit stays in the parameter settings such that @xmath51 , until any operation is applied to it .",
    "thus , during the operational delay @xmath52 , the circuit evolves under the hamiltonian @xmath53 , i.e. , undergoes a free time - evolution @xmath54 in this case , the bell states in eq .",
    "( 1 ) will not evolve , once they have been generated .      due to the constant coupling ,",
    "simultaneous operations on two qubits are relatively easy .",
    "for example , if @xmath30 ( i.e. , at co - resonance point ) and @xmath55 , then the circuit has the hamiltonian @xmath56 , which produces the following time - evolution operator @xmath57 with @xmath58 the subindex  co \" refers to  co - resonance \" .",
    "thus , we can simultaneously flip the two qubits , i.e. , @xmath59 , and @xmath60 , by setting the duration as @xmath61 .",
    "another specific two - qubit quantum operation @xmath62 can also be implemented , if the duration is set as @xmath63 .      without the interaction free subspaces  @xcite ,",
    "a strict single - qubit gate can not , in principle , be achieved in the system with strong fixed interbit - coupling .",
    "recently , we have proposed an effective approach to approximately implement expected single - qubit logic operations  @xcite . in what follows",
    "we show that _ conditional _ single - qubit operations , i.e. , evolving only one selected qubit and leaving the other one unaffected , are still possible .",
    "for example , one can set @xmath64 to only rotate the @xmath14th qubit . indeed , the reduced hamiltonian @xmath65 yields the following time - evolution @xmath66 with @xmath67 ^ 2+[e_j^{(j)}/2]^2}. \\end{array } \\right.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this implies that , if the @xmath37th qubit is in the state @xmath68 ( @xmath69 ) , then the @xmath14th qubit undergoes a rotation @xmath70 ( @xmath71 ) . during this operation",
    "the @xmath37th qubit is unchanged and kept in its initial state . obviously ,",
    "if @xmath72 is satisfied beforehand ( thus @xmath73 ) , and the duration is set as @xmath74^{1/2}$ ] , then the following two - qubit deutsch gate  @xcite @xmath75|1_k\\rangle\\langle 1_k|,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath76 , is obtained .",
    "above , @xmath77 is the unit operator relating to the @xmath14th qubit .",
    "the above operation implies that the target qubit ( here it is the @xmath14th one ) undergoes a quantum evolution , only if the control qubit ( here , the @xmath37th one ) is in the logical state  1 \" .",
    "if the duration is set to simultaneously satisfy the two conditions : @xmath78 and @xmath79 , then the above two - qubit operation is equivalent to the well - known controlled - not ( cnot ) gate , apart from a phase factor . on the other hand ,",
    "if @xmath80 is set beforehand , then the target qubit undergoes the same evolution only if the control qubit is in the logic state  0 \" .",
    "the corresponding time - evolution operator reads @xmath81|0_k\\rangle\\langle 0_k|.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    furthermore , if @xmath82 is set beforehand , then the above conditional operation ( 7 ) on the @xmath14th qubit ( keeping the @xmath37th one unchanged ) reduces to @xmath83 with @xmath84 this operation can be further engineered to @xmath85,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] if @xmath86 and @xmath87 are further set .",
    "this is a hadamard - like operation on the @xmath14th qubit .    of course , the above operations , although only evolve the selected qubit and leave the other one unaffected , are no the strict single - qubit quantum gates ( but just the especial two - qubit quantum operations ) .",
    "this is because the rotations of the selected qubit depend on the states of the other one .",
    "note that , due to the presence of the constant interbit - coupling @xmath88 , the value of @xmath46 depends on both gate - voltages applied to the two cooper - pair boxes .",
    "for example , @xmath89 requires that the two gate - voltages should be set to satisfy the condition : @xmath90 .",
    "now , it will be shown how to deterministically generate epr correlations between the above two capacitively coupled josephson qubits .",
    "we will also propose how to experimentally confirm the expected epr - bell states .      naturally , we begin with the ground state of the circuit @xmath91 , which can be easily initialized by letting the circuit work far from the co - resonance point via a large voltage bias .",
    "first , we prepare the superposition of two logical states of a selected qubit , e.g. , the first one . this can be achieved by simply using a pulse of duration @xmath92 to implement the above quantum operation ( 9 ) , i.e. , @xmath93 here , the duration is set to satisfy the conditions @xmath94 and @xmath95 .",
    "the plus sign corresponds to the time durations for @xmath96 , and @xmath97 .",
    "the minus sign corresponds to @xmath98 , and @xmath99 .",
    "we next conditionally flip the second qubit , keeping the first one unchanged .",
    "the expected operations can be simply expressed as either @xmath100 , keeping @xmath101 unchanged , or @xmath102 , keeping @xmath103 unchanged .",
    "the former ( latter ) operation requires to flip the second qubit if and only if the first qubit is in logic state  0 \" (  1 \" ) .",
    "these manipulations have been proposed above , and thus the desirable bell states can be deterministically prepared by @xmath104 and @xmath105 respectively .",
    "the duration @xmath106 of the second pulse is determined by the condition @xmath107 .",
    "the fidelity of the epr correlations generated above can be experimentally measured by quantum - state tomography , a technique for reconstructing the density matrix of quantum state . for the complete characterization of an unknown two - qubit state with a @xmath50 density matrix @xmath108 ( with @xmath109 ) , we need to determine @xmath110 independent real parameters , due to @xmath111 , and @xmath112 . this can be achieved by a series of measurements on a sufficient number of identically prepared copies .",
    "the operations presented above for the generation of epr pairs could provide enough copies of any expected epr pairs to be reconstructed .",
    "experimentally , bell states of pseudo - spins ( e.g. , in nuclear magnetic resonance systems  @xcite , two - level trapped cold ions  @xcite , and the photon pairs  @xcite ) have been tomographically reconstructed by only using a series of single - qubit manipulations .",
    "recently , we have proposed a generic approach to tomographically measure solid - state qubits with switchable interactions  @xcite . due to the relatively strong interbit - coupling , which is always on in the circuits considered here ,",
    "specific operations are required to realize the tomographic reconstruction of the epr pairs generated .",
    "the state of a charge qubit is often read out by capacitively coupling a single - electron transistor ( set ) to the measured qubit  @xcite . when a projective measurement @xmath113 is performed on the state @xmath114 , a dissipative current @xmath115 flows through the @xmath14th set coupled to the @xmath14th qubit .",
    "such a projective measurement is equivalent to the measurement of @xmath116 , as @xmath117 . for the present system one may perform three kinds of projective measurements :",
    "i ) the @xmath118-measurement ( with projective operator @xmath119 ) acting only on the first qubit ( independent of the state of the second qubit ) ; ii ) the @xmath120-measurement ( with projective operator @xmath121 ) operating only on the second qubit ( independent of the state of the first qubit ) ; and iii ) the @xmath122-measurement ( with projective operator @xmath123 ) simultaneously acting on both cooper - pair boxes .",
    "all diagonal elements of the density matrix @xmath114 can be directly determined by performing these three kinds of projective measurements on the system .",
    "in fact , @xmath124 can be determined by the @xmath122-measurement as @xmath125 next , @xmath126 could be determined by @xmath118-measurement as @xmath127 also , we can determine @xmath128 by the @xmath120-measurement as @xmath129 the remaining element @xmath130 could be determined by the normalization condition @xmath131 .",
    "the @xmath132 non - diagonal elements which are left , should be transformed to the diagonal positions of new density matrix @xmath133 , by performing a proper quantum operation @xmath134 on the original density matrix @xmath114 .",
    "for example , after a quantum manipulation @xmath135 , see eq .",
    "( 11 ) , evolving the system to @xmath136 , we can perform the @xmath122-measurement to obtain @xmath137\\nonumber\\\\ & = & \\frac{1}{2}[\\rho_{01,01}+\\rho_{11,11}-2\\,{\\rm re}(\\rho_{01,11})],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for determining re@xmath138 ; and perform the @xmath118-measurement to obtain @xmath139=\\frac{1}{2}[1 + 2\\,{\\rm re}(\\rho_{00,10}-\\rho_{01,11})],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for determining re@xmath140 .",
    "all the remaining @xmath141 off - diagonal elements of @xmath114 can be similarly determined .",
    "table i summarizes such a procedure for tomographic characterization of an unknown two - qubit state in this fixed - coupling two - qubit system .",
    "we need to first apply to @xmath114 the quantum operations listed in the first column of table i. afterwards , the projective measurements listed in the second column of table i must be made . in this way , all the matrix elements of @xmath114 can be determined .",
    "of course , this is not a unique approach for determining all fifteen independent elements of the density matrix .",
    "in fact , the expected tomographic reconstruction could also be achieved by only using the @xmath118- and @xmath120-measurements , and making the @xmath122-measurement unnecessary .",
    ".[tab1]tomographic characterization of an unknown two - qubit state @xmath108 with @xmath109 in capacitively - coupled josephson circuits .",
    "each row of this table requires operating on an identically prepared initial state @xmath114 . [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     it is seen that the variations @xmath142 of the concurrence , after the above quasi - local operations @xmath143 , decrease with decreasing interbit coupling . for very weak coupling , e.g. , @xmath144 , the applied conditional single - qubit operations can be regarded as local , away from @xmath145 , ( or @xmath146 ) . besides these tiny loopholes of locality",
    ", table ii shows that the chsh - type bell s inequality  @xcite @xmath147 is obviously violated .",
    "similar to other theoretical schemes ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) the realizability of the present proposal also faces certain technological challenges , such as the rapid switching of the charge- and josephson energies of the squid - based qubits and decoherence due to the various environmental noises .",
    "our numerical results , considering various typical fluctuations , showed that the lifetime of the generated epr pairs adequately allows to perform the required operations for experimentally testing bell s inequality .",
    "indeed , for current experiments  @xcite , the decay time of a _",
    "two_-qubit excited state is as long as @xmath148 ns , even for the very strong interbit coupling , e.g. , @xmath149 .",
    "longer decoherence times are possible for weaker interbit couplings .",
    "in addition , for testing this , the influence of the environmental noises and operational imperfections is not fatal , as the nonlocal correlation @xmath150 in bell s inequality is statistical  its fluctuation could be effectively suppressed by the averages of many repeatable experiments .    in summary , for the experimentally realized capacitively coupled josephson nanocircuits , we found that several typical two - qubit quantum operations ( including simultaneously flipping the two qubits and only evolving a selected qubit in the case of leaving the other one unchanged ) could be easily implemented by properly setting the controllable parameters of circuits , e.g. , the applied gate voltages and external fluxes . as a consequence of this , macroscopic epr correlated pairs could be deterministically generated from the ground state @xmath103 by two conditional single - qubit operations : prepare the superposition of the two logic states of a selected qubit , and then only flip one of the two qubits . to experimentally confirm the proposed generation schemes , we also propose an effective tomographic technique for determining all density matrix elements of the prepared states by a series of quantum projective measurements .",
    "the deterministically generated epr pairs provide an effective platform to test , at the macroscopic level , certain fundamental principles , e.g. , the non - locality of quantum entanglement via violating the bell s inequality .",
    "the approach proposed here can be easily modified to engineer quantum entanglement in other ",
    "fixed - interaction \" solid - state systems , e.g. , capacitively ( inductively ) coupled josephson phase ( flux ) system and ising ( heisenberg)-spin chains .",
