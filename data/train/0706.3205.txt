    "after a research effort that spans almost ten years , we have been able to derive exact solutions of the nonlinear differential equations that describe the equilibrium structures of differentially  rotating , self  gravitating fluids with cylindrical symmetry .",
    "our results are directly applicable to quasi",
    " equilibrium configurations that may develop early in the evolution of protostellar and protoplanetary disks , and we expect that they will help us understand the physical conditions that prevail in such systems long before the onset of accretion processes , gas ionization , and nonaxisymmetric evolution .",
    "the nonrotating analogues of our equations have been legendary in the literature ; they are known as the nonlinear lane ",
    "emden , thomas  fermi , and emden  fowler equations .",
    "introduction of rotation to these equations complicates matters considerably and very little analytical work has been carried out to date in this most interesting case .",
    "our results are also relevant to a long  standing problem in the formation of our solar system that has preoccupied professional astronomers and nonprofessionals for over two centuries , namely the locations of planetary orbits and the observed `` order '' in the present solar system .",
    "naturally , we too have ended up considering the famous titius  bode `` law '' of planetary distances but not in an effort to discover some hidden physical principle or previously unknown `` universal '' underpinning ; on the contrary , we saw this `` law '' as an adverse interpretation to different and more complex patterns that we detected in the actual data and that we describe in   [ work ] .",
    "we begin in  ",
    "[ le][tb ] with a brief overview of the research that has been carried out by other researchers on these topics .",
    "we also mention in   [ work ] some of the history of our work that has finally tied up together all the pertinent issues .",
    "we refer especially to our past unsuccessful attempts to resolve the question of planetary distances because it is such setbacks that eventually pave the way for a successful conclusion of the research effort .",
    "emden differential equation ( lane 186970 ; emden 1907 ) describes the equilibria of nonrotating fluids in which internal pressure balances self - gravity .",
    "spherically symmetric solutions of this equation came to the attention of astrophysicists when chandrasekhar included them in his 1939 monograph `` an introduction to the study of stellar structure , '' but interest in such solutions continued to be largely academic because real stars rotate and rotation destroys spherical symmetry and modifies their internal profiles and physical characteristics . in the latter half of the twentieth century ,",
    "the isothermal solution , commonly referred to as the `` singular isothermal sphere , '' and its nonsingular modifications found some interesting applications to the structures of collisionless systems such as globular clusters and early - type galaxies ( binney & tremaine 1987 ; rix et al .",
    "1997 ) ; to the structures of large ",
    "scale gaseous systems such as x  ray halos around elliptical galaxies ( fabbiano 1989 ) and clusters of galaxies ( sarazin 1988 ; fabian 1991 ) ; and to simplified models of gravitational lenses ( kochanek 1995 ) .",
    "emden s work also attracted the attention of physicists outside the field of astrophysics ( fowler 1914 ; thomas 1927 ; fermi 1927 ) who studied generalized polytropic forms of the lane ",
    "emden equation for specific polytropic indices @xmath3 .",
    "the extensive studies of fowler ( 1914 , 1930 , 1931 ) produced some singular solutions for @xmath4 and established the so  called emden ",
    "fowler equation in the literature , while the works of thomas ( 1927 ) and fermi ( 1927 ) produced the so  called thomas  fermi equation , an important milestone in atomic theory . at present , both of these equations continue to be the subjects of investigations by physicists and mathematicians alike .",
    "physicists are drawn to the emden ",
    "fowler equation because it appears in the kinetics of landau  ginzburg critical phenomena ( see the detailed account of dixon & tuszyski 1990 ) and in the kinetics of combustion ( frank  kamenetskii 1955 ) .",
    "mathematicians use these nonlinear equations as laboratories to study a wide variety of properties in their solutions  positivity , uniqueness , singularities , monotonic vs. oscillatory behavior , and bifurcations  usually without having analytic solutions at hand ( e.g. , wong 1975 ; lions 1982 ; see also goenner & havas [ 2000 ] for a comprehensive list of all known exact analytic solutions ; as well as berkovich [ 1997 ] and goenner [ 2001 ] for classifications of some solutions obtained from lie  group symmetries ) .    the cylindrical form of the classical lane ",
    "emden equation differs from the spherical form in just one coefficient and both forms have been included as special cases in studies of the generalized emden ",
    "fowler equation ( horedt 1986 ; dixon & tuszyski 1990 ; berkovich 1997 ; goenner & havas 2000 ) .",
    "but until now , the cylindrical lane  emden equation has not attracted attention on its own merit  not even in astrophysics where it can be used as a simplified ( but nonlinear ) model of a disk  like or cylindrical self  gravitating gas .",
    "the only analytic studies of the cylindrical form that we are aware of have been made by jeans ( 1914 ) and robe ( 1968 ) who found a bessel  function solution of the linear @xmath5 case with uniform rotation and by stodlkiewicz ( 1963 ) and ostriker ( 1964 ) who solved the nonrotating isothermal ( @xmath6 ) case .",
    "ostriker ( 1964 ) , in particular , also showed that the radius and the mass per unit length are finite in all models with @xmath7 and that , in contrast to the singular isothermal sphere , the nonrotating , nonsingular , isothermal cylinder has finite mass per unit length in spite of its infinite radial extent .",
    "after the work of robe ( 1968 ) , some numerical studies of rotating isothermal cylinders and disks ( hansen et al .",
    "1976 ; schmitz & ebert 1986 ; narita et al .",
    "1990 ) and rotating polytropic cylinders ( schneider & schmitz 1995 ) also found nonmonotonic solutions for the equilibrium density akin to the bessel ",
    "function oscillatory solution of the @xmath8 polytrope in uniform rotation ; but understanding this behavior proved elusive and so the nonmonotonic density profiles were marginalized .",
    "schneider & schmitz ( 1995 ) , in particular , adopted some differentially rotating profiles and obtained numerical solutions for the radial density profiles of models with negative polytropic indices ( @xmath9 ) .",
    "these authors did not study the isothermal models of interest here , and they did not explain the unusual properties of their solutions",
    ". nevertheless , their work is by far the most closely related study to our work and their polytropic results should be considered in conjunction with our results from isothermal models .",
    "the numerical algorithm called the titius  bode `` law '' has been known for 240 years ( e.g. , nieto 1972 ; lecar 1973 ; danby 1988 ) .",
    "it relies on an ad  hoc geometric progression to describe the positions of the planets in the solar system and works fairly well out to uranus but no farther ( jaki 1972 ) .",
    "the same phenomenology has also been applied to the satellites of the gaseous giant planets ( neuh@xmath10user & feitzinger 1986 ) .",
    "two modern brief reviews of the history along with criticisms of this `` law '' have been written by graner & dubrulle ( 1994 ) and by hayes & tremaine ( 1998 ) . currently , the general consensus is that a satisfactory physical basis has not been found for this numerical coincidence despite serious efforts by many researchers in over two centuries .",
    "furthermore , opinions differ on whether such a physical basis exists at all .    apparently , many researchers still believe that the titius  bode algorithm does have a physical foundation and continue to work on this problem .",
    "the last decade of the twentieth century , in particular , saw a resurgence of investigations targeting precisely two questions : the origin of the `` law '' ( graner & dubrulle 1994 ; dubrulle & graner 1994 ; li , zhang , & li 1995 ; nottale , schumacher , & gay 1997 ) and its statistical robustness against the null hypothesis ( hayes & tremaine 1998 ) .",
    "hayes & tremaine ( 1998 ) found some statistical evidence that the titius ",
    "bode `` law '' could be related to the long  term dynamical stability of the solar system .",
    "their work is the latest in a long line of differing arguments made by several statisticians in the past and summarized by these authors ( see also lynch 2003 ) .",
    "more importantly , hayes & tremaine ( 1998 ) dismissed without discussion all the previous purported explanations of the physical origin of the `` law '' as `` not entirely convincing . '' in our opinion , that is an example of good physical instincts , but it still requires some physical understanding of planetary distances before final judgment is passed .",
    "we believe that the work presented below does provide the required understanding , and we will return to a broad discussion of the titius ",
    "bode `` law '' in   [ dis ] below .",
    "just as jeans ( 1914 ) had done years ago , we began studying rotating self  gravitating cylinders in 1997 for the same reason ; as jeans put it :    _ `` all the essential physical features of the natural three ",
    "dimensional problem appear to be reproduced in the simpler cylindrical problem , so that it seems legitimate to hope that an argument by analogy may not lead to entirely erroneous result[s ] . '' _",
    "being unaware of the work published in french by robe ( 1968 ) , we solved analytically the @xmath8 polytropic lane ",
    "emden equation with cylindrical symmetry , uniform rotation , and proper boundary conditions ( christodoulou 1997 , unpublished ) .",
    "( applying boundary conditions did not concern jeans who was interested in the stability of local deformations in compressible gases . )",
    "the radial density profiles for @xmath8 and for sufficiently fast rotation exhibited permanent oscillations due to the zeroth ",
    "order bessel function @xmath11 that is the dominant part of the solution . numerical integrations for polytropes with @xmath12 also showed that the solutions for the density oscillate permanently with radius .",
    "this generic oscillatory behavior then led us to consider the distribution of semimajor axes of planetary orbits in the solar system and their possible connection to the radial density peaks found in the equilibrium solutions .",

    "bode algorithm that could in principle also provide good fits to some sections of the data .",
    "these patterns are summarized in table 1 where we list the observed semimajor axes @xmath14 of planetary orbits in our solar system ( e.g. kaufmann 1994 ) along with three empirical fits to the data , the titius ",
    "bode `` law , '' _ inversion _ , and an arithmetic mean .",
    "the inversion distance for each orbit is the geometric mean of the actual semimajor axes of the two nearest neighbors .",
    "the mean distance for each orbit is the arithmetic average of the actual semimajor axes of the two nearest neighbors .",
    "relative errors are calculated for all three fits with respect to the observed values .",
    "the inversion distances are listed in table 1 because this is the first pattern that we saw in the observed data rather than the titius ",
    "bode `` law . '' the mean distances are shown for comparison purposes ; they are very accurate only for those orbits in which either or both of the other two fits fail .",
    "the surprisingly small errors in the arithmetic  mean distances of venus , uranus , and neptune led us to the working hypothesis that the effect that may cause inversion in the intermediate orbits does not operate at small or at large distances ; moreover , it is smoothly replaced at the two ends by a slick new regularity that manifests itself as a modest arithmetic average . this smooth transition from inversion to arithmetic",
    "averaging was another significant pattern that we saw in the data : for example , the orbit of uranus ( along with jupiter s orbit ) reproduces successfully the orbit of saturn by inversion while , on the other side , the saturn ",
    "uranus pair is clearly in arithmetic progression with neptune ; and the earth ",
    "venus pair shows inversion on the side of mars and arithmetic progression on the side of mercury .",
    "we thought that this could not be a numerical coincidence because we found similar smooth transitions in the orbital distances of the regular ( and even some irregular ) satellites of the jovian planets .    the geometric ",
    "mean spacing of the 110 au objects in table 1 implies that their orbits are _ inverted images _ of every other one with respect to the corresponding in  between orbit ( e.g. , coxeter 1989 ) , i.e. , that the semimajor axes of any three consecutive orbits obey the relation @xmath24 in geometry , inversion is the gateway to hyperbolic space , where the inverted orbits would appear to be conveniently equidistant  a perfect symmetry indeed , taking place in a space that we can not even visualize .",
    "but we could not see how the orbital plane of the solar system could be so strongly curved in its middle and so flat at the two ends ; so eventually we abandoned this line of reasoning and the high degree of symmetry in hyperbolic space .",
    "next we turned to geometric optics , the only part of physics where the same relation occurs .",
    "( [ d1d3d2d2 ] ) can also be written as @xmath25 this is a _ mirror equation _ and implies that the @xmath26 and the @xmath27 orbits are mirror images of one another while the in  between orbit plays the role of a concave mirror . also , the magnification ratio @xmath28 is clearly larger than 1 and approximately constant throughout the system of orbits in geometric progression ( i.e. , for @xmath29 ) ; and it reduces to @xmath30 for those orbits in arithmetic progression ( see table 1 ) .",
    "this model appeared promising for a while because it suggested that some mechanism could potentially be responsible for tapering off the geometric progression to an arithmetic progression , as indicated by the magnifications of the orbits .",
    "unfortunately , the mirror equation of geometric optics is not based on a fundamental principle per se , it is only a linear approximation valid for paraxial rays , and we did not think that its deeper underlying principle ( fermat s principle ) could be applicable to planetary orbits . because a mirror equation similar to eq .",
    "( [ mirror ] ) is not derived from first principles in any other part of physical theory , we finally became convinced that the observed planetary distances , the titius  bode algorithm , and the inversion distances could not be derived from a physical principle ; and we redirected our effort toward mathematical reasons that might be responsible for the observed order in the solar system .",
    "this prompted us to return to the lane ",
    "emden equation and to focus exclusively on its intrinsic properties in the cases with and without rotation .    in the case of no rotation or for some specific rotation profiles , the lane ",
    "emden equation is scale invariant and can be transformed to an autonomous differential equation ( see e.g. bender & orzag [ 1978 ] and visser & yunes [ 2003 ] ) for the theory and the transformations of such differential equations ) . scale invariance was also exploited by graner & dubrulle ( 1994 ) and dubrulle & graner ( 1994 ) who argued that cold , self  gravitating , perfect ",
    "fluid disks are scale invariant and that this condition is sufficient to generate unstable radial modes that are equidistant in @xmath31 ( see also schmitz [ 1984 ] and li et al .",
    "[ 1995 ] for stability analyses that have effectively led to the same result ) .",
    "unfortunately , the scale invariance of the inviscid hydrodynamical equations is easily broken by the chosen boundary conditions for the equilibrium system _ and _ for the stability problem ; because of this fact , we thought that we should not look for a geometric progression of the titius  bode kind in the stability problem .",
    "after all , scale  invariant unstable modes , such as those studied by dubrulle & graner ( 1994 ) , could only produce a generic geometric progression and they would be incapable of matching the observed loss of inversion at small and large distances , where planetary orbits seem to taper off neatly to two different arithmetic progressions ( see table 1 ) . therefore , a mechanism based on such modes of disturbance would suffer from the same problem that also afflicts inversion to a hyperbolic space , the titius  bode geometric progression , and any other idea that overemphasizes the geometric spacing of the intermediate planetary orbits and ignores the observed arithmetic progressions of orbits in the inner and the outer solar system .",
    "returning to the scale invariance of the lane ",
    "emden equation itself , we realized that it would not matter if this equation lost this symmetry by the applicable boundary conditions so long as its autonomous form were to exhibit _ discrete scale invariance _",
    "( dsi ; sornette 1998 ) . in the theory of autonomous systems , dsi is a stronger constraint than scale invariance , and it is associated with _",
    "limit cycles _ in the phase portrait of the differential equation ( see appendix b in visser & yunes [ 2003 ] ) .",
    "a solution that exhibits dsi is not invariant for any arbitrary rescaling of the independent variable , but it still is self  similar for a specific rescaling of that variable .",
    "this fact led sornette ( 1998 ) to propose that the titius  bode `` law '' may be a manifestation of dsi in the solar system , where the constant ratio of the titius  bode geometric progression or , equivalently , the constant magnification ratio  @xmath32  of inversion is the specific factor that rescales each planetary orbit to the next outward orbit .",
    "we followed then the hypothesis of sornette ( 1998 ) and the methodology of visser & yunes ( 2003 ) and we constructed numerically the phase portraits of the autonomous forms of the polytropic and isothermal lane ",
    "emden equations , where we looked for limit cycles and discrete self  similar behavior with absolutely no success .",
    "at that point , being convinced that there is no fundamental physics behind the observed patterns shown in table 1 above , and with the theory of nonlinear autonomous systems revealing no intrinsic periodicities , we basically had only one remaining option : to return to our initial approach and solve the full boundary  value problem for the differentially  rotating equilibrium systems in order to see if any interesting patterns would emerge from the differentially  rotating solutions  patterns similar to the bessel ",
    "function oscillations found in the uniformly  rotating @xmath8 polytropic case that did not exist intrinsically in the differential equation but were generated and governed by the applied boundary conditions .",
    "we proceeded to do just that , and our results for the isothermal case are described in the sections that follow below . in the end , we were truly surprised by the simplicity of the mechanism that generates the patterns seen in table 1 ; because the discord between the equilibrium density profile favored inherently by the differential rotation and the profile imposed externally by the boundary conditions , although low  key and inconspicuous , it is nonetheless a plain fact and does provide a simple resolution to the long  standing , centuries  old problem of planetary `` order '' in our solar system ( see   [ compo ] ) .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organized as follows . in   [ models ] , we solve analytically for the equilibrium structure of the midplane of a gaseous isothermal disk , incorporating in the lane  emden equation the effects of self - gravity , differential rotation , and thermal pressure . in ",
    "[ solar ] , we adopt a four  parameter analytic solution as our baseline and we use the rotation profile of the baseline to compute numerically the corresponding oscillatory equilibrium solution that obeys physical boundary conditions at the center .",
    "then we fit the density maxima of this solution to the planetary orbits in the present solar system in order to determine the underlying physical characteristics and the stability properties of the baseline model . in",
    "  [ discussion ] , we discuss the significance of our results for our solar system and for protoplanetary disks in general .",
    "we consider the axisymmetric equilibria that are available to a rotating self  gravitating gas in the absence of viscosity and magnetic fields .",
    "we adopt cylindrical coordinates ( @xmath33 ) and the assumption of cylindrical symmetry ( @xmath34 ) which lets us ignore @xmath35dependent gradients and reduces the problem to one dimension , the distance @xmath36 from the rotation axis .",
    "this technique has become common practice in studies of rotating , self  gravitating , fluid disks ( e.g. , goodman & narayan 1988 ; christodoulou & narayan 1992 ; christodoulou 1993 ; christodoulou , contopoulos , & kazanas 1996 ) because it simplifies the stability analyses of effectively two  dimensional modes of disturbance . in what follows ,",
    "we are interested in equilibrium structures that describe the physical conditions across the midplane of a protoplanetary disk , so the assumptions @xmath37 allow us to tackle the problem by solving ordinary differential equations ( odes ) .",
    "we further adopt a rotation law of the form @xmath38 where @xmath39 is a dimensionless radius and the length scale @xmath40 will be specified in eq .",
    "( [ length ] ) below .",
    "furthermore , @xmath41 is the angular velocity , @xmath42 is the value of @xmath43 at some fixed radius , and the dimensionless function @xmath44 for differential rotation is generally an arbitrary function of @xmath45 . for centrally condensed models ,",
    "it is convenient to choose @xmath46 and the regularity condition @xmath47 , while for singular or annular models , we choose @xmath48 and the normalization @xmath49 .",
    "finally , we assume an isothermal equation of state of the form @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the thermal pressure , @xmath52 is the gas density , and @xmath53 is the constant isothermal sound speed .",
    "additional calculations in which we used polytropes with indices @xmath54 and the results of schneider & schmitz ( 1995 ) who used polytropes with indices @xmath9 demonstrate that the characteristics of the solutions presented below are largely insensitive to the particular choice of @xmath3 .",

    "assuming that our model disk is uniform in the @xmath35direction over a thin layer of thickness  @xmath325 ,  we can multiply its mass per unit length by this factor and we can define the total mass near the midplane of the solar nebula out to a maximum radius @xmath326 as @xmath327 where the constant @xmath328 is given by @xmath329 where eq .",

    "this is not surprising since we have adopted a very small value ( @xmath40 ) for the vertical scale of the disk . in the classical scenario of cloud collapse ,",
    "this mass near the midplane will be enhanced substantially as more matter from the parent cloud will continue falling onto the disk ( see   [ ipc ] below for more details ) .",
    "it is however interesting that the inner disk already has high enough densities ( eq .  [ [ therho ] ] ) to begin the process of planet formation so early in its evolution , before the central protostar grows to become gravitationally dominant or radial accretion becomes important in the gas .      integrating over the mass distribution of the core of the baseline model , we can estimate important dynamical properties , such as the core mass and angular momentum .",
    "the analytic estimates can then be compared to the corresponding results from protostellar collapse simulations .",
    "such simulations have been recently reviewed by tohline ( 2002 ) who also summarized the main results over which there seems to be widespread agreement among researchers working in the field for almost 40 years ( see the discussion of tohline centered around his figure 2 and table 2 ) .",
    "the mass of the core found in ",
    "[ md ] above ,  @xmath339 ,  is 40 times smaller than the typical mass of a collapsing cloud core in which the jeans instability may be temporarily halted by thermal pressure and an adiabatic quasi ",
    "equilibrium may then be established ( see case b in table 2 of tohline [ 2002 ] ) .",
    "this means that the core of our quasi  equilibrium disk will remain isothermal and it will continue to accumulate mass from the infalling cloud beyond the point described here .",
    "furthermore , the total angular momentum of the core of the model is @xmath340 this implies that the _ specific _ angular momentum of the matter in the core is @xmath341 which is about one  half of the corresponding estimate given by tohline ( 2002 ) for a cloud core at the endpoint of its isothermal evolution . clearly , in a realistic setting , this type of low ",
    "mass core has the potential to grow by accreting a lot more matter of low specific angular momentum , the kind that can settle on to the central region from the vertical direction .",
    "we have presented exact analytic and numerical solutions of the axisymmetric , cylindrically symmetric , isothermal lane  emden equation with and without rotation ( eqs .  [ [ main3 ] ] and  [ [ main2 ] ] , respectively ) .",
    "this second  order ode describes the radial equilibrium configurations that are available to a self  gravitating perfect fluid in which the _ vertical variation _ of the enthalpy gradient , namely @xmath342 is negligible .",
    "the enthalpy gradient @xmath343 , where @xmath52 is the density and @xmath51 is the pressure , is the term that establishes vertical hydrostatic equilibrium when it successfully balances the gravitational force @xmath344 in the @xmath35direction , but it is its vertical variation that is actually ignored when the cylindrical lane ",
    "emden equation is considered .",
    "this term is zero identically for a cylindrical model of infinite vertical extent ; such a model may be applicable to elongated , filamentary , star  forming regions in which @xmath345 .",
    "in other astrophysical applications , especially those dealing with gaseous disks that concern us in this work , this second derivative is not identically zero everywhere ; but it is ignored on the basis that it vanishes on the symmetry plane and hopefully it remains negligible away from that plane over some layer of the astrophysical disk ( as in the exact models of schmitz & ebert [ 1986 ] ) . in the specific case of the solar nebula ,",
    "this assumption is probably valid because the disk is not in vertical hydrostatic equilibrium and vertical pressure support is smaller than the weight of the infalling matter everywhere , except near the midplane of the disk where the gradients tend to zero by symmetry anyway .",
    "the rotating analytic solutions are exact intrinsic solutions of the lane ",
    "emden equation  ( [ main3 ] ) .",
    "their density profiles are all pure power laws or combinations of power laws ( eqs .",
    "[ [ class2 ] ] and  [ [ den3 ] ] ) .",
    "these solutions are determined solely by the balance between the _ gradients _ of the centrifugal and the gravitational accelerations ( eq .  [ [ gradients ] ] ) because for an isothermal fluid with a power  law density profile , the _ radial variation _ of the enthalpy gradient , namely @xmath346 is zero identically ( see eq .  [",
    "[ part2 ] ] and the discussion at the end of   [ withrot ] ) .",
    " rotation profiles that can support such power  law densities are quite general and varied ( eqs .",
    "[ [ class3 ] ] and  [ [ class4 ] ] ) .",
    "they contain three integration constants that can be used to compose models of equilibrium disks in which the density profiles are nonsingular and arbitrarily steep in radius .",
    "we have created one such composite equilibrium model and we have applied it to the structure of the midplane of the solar nebula (   [ solar ] ) . in this model , we have connected a central core region of constant density and an outer region of constant density with a power  law profile .",
    "the rotation parameter and the size of the core as well as the power  law index and the truncation radius of the intermediate region are the four model parameters to be determined based on the presently observed solar system . beyond the truncation radius ,",
    "the density remains constant at a low level .",
    "this turns out to be the necessary nebular background for the formation of nearly equidistant outer planets and its physical origin deserves further investigation .",
    "the density profile of the composite equilibrium disk model is no longer an exact solution when physical boundary conditions are imposed at the center of the disk .",
    "the exact solution to the associated boundary ",
    "value problem is obtained by numerical integration that enforces the proper central boundary conditions in a model with the same differential ",
    "rotation law as the composite analytic model .",
    "we have found that the intrinsic analytic density profile is a good approximation to the actual numerical solution , i.e. , it is a  baseline \" that exhibits on average all the important features of the exact solution to the boundary  value problem , except one : the actual density profile is permanently oscillatory in radius . in fact , it oscillates around the baseline solution because it is attracted to this inherent particular solution of the lane  emden equation , but the two solutions can not match in any finite segment since such coincidence is strictly prohibited by the imposed central boundary conditions ( see fig .  2 and the discussion in   [ compo ] ) .",
    "the radial density peaks of the actual solution to the boundary  value problem correspond to local minima of the gravitational potential in the midplane of the protoplanetary disk . in a cloud collapse scenario , the density of the gas and the concentration of condensates ( dust , rocks , and ices )",
    "will be enhanced inside these local gravitational potential wells as more matter rains down onto the disk from the surrounding protostellar cloud .",
    "it is not unreasonable to consider that the added material will , in turn , deepen further these potential wells which may thus become feasible sites of planet formation .",
    "based on this picture , we have proceeded to fit the density peaks of the exact numerical solutions of the lane  emden boundary  value problem to the presently observed locations of the planets around the sun and the satellites of the jovian planets . our best ",
    "fit model for the planets in our solar system ( fig .  3 and tables  2 and  3 ) is described in   [ solar2 ] and the dynamical parameters obtained for the solar nebula",
    "are described in   [ solar3 ] . the mean relative error for this",
    "fit model is 4.1% and the relative deviations for individual planets do not exceed 6.5% .",
    "furthermore , this model suggests that the radial surface density profile of the protoplanetary disk between roughly 0.8  au and 11.3  au declined as @xmath2 , a result that agrees fully with the classic determinations of weidenschilling ( 1977 ) and hayashi ( 1981 ) which were based on the presently observed planetary masses .",
    "we find the confluence of these very diverse approaches encouraging and supportive of the view that the fundamental notions behind our model are indeed relevant to the problem of the radial distribution of planetary orbits .",
    "we would also like to note that the same type of modeling works very well for the regular satellites of jupiter and for the 5 planets of 55 cancri , and we plan to present these results in future publications .",
    "our work is the first to produce exact solutions of the nonlinear isothermal lane ",
    "emden equation with differential rotation that exhibit a pronounced oscillatory behavior , a feature attributed exclusively to the proper choice of the central boundary conditions .",
    "the roughly arithmetic or geometric spacings of the corresponding density maxima depend on the local slope of the differential rotation profile and provide a transparent , physically  based , and soundly formulated reason for producing a sequence of distinct density enhancements at radial positions that agree with the present planetary distances , given that the latter are observed to follow an arithmetic , then a geometric , and finally again an arithmetic progression ( see table 1 ) .",
    "hence , it should be remarked that we now have at hand , for the first time , a plain explanation of the so - called titius  bode",
    " law \" of planetary distances .",
    "this empirical algorithm has been known for 240 years but with no underlying physical justification ( see e.g. graner & dubrulle [ 1994 ] and hayes & tremaine [ 1998 ] ) .",
    "fit model of the midplane of the solar nebula ( fig .  3 and table  2 ) shows a progression of density enhancements that are stretched farther apart from one another , as the actual density profile decreases sharply in trying to keep up with the steeply declining baseline .",
    "the relative spacing of the peaks is roughly geometric between 0.7 and 20  au , and this explains the success of the titius  bode algorithm for a large number of planetary orbits .",
    "the change of the underlying density profile to constant beyond a certain distance in our model can then also explain why this algorithm fails at large distances .",
    "a similar account of the nongeometric spacing of mercury also finds a straightforward explanation in terms of a uniform central core in our model .",
    "so , just as many researchers have suspected in the past ( see   [ tb ] ) , the titius  bode algorithm has no underlying physical principle underneath its phenomenology ; the algorithm has been successful only to the extent that it has managed to exploit empirically the most pronounced feature of the radial density profile of the solar nebula ( the roughly geometric spacing of the peaks between 0.7 and 20  au ) . finally , we should point out that the above resolution of the long  standing problem of planetary `` order '' in our solar system is very anticlimactic , as the long  sought physical explanation turns out to lie entirely within the realm of conventional physics and does not need to invoke unrestrained numerology of the titius  bode type , exotic physics , `` new '' dynamical laws , or arbitrary `` universal '' constants and ad  hoc solar  system `` quantizations '' such as those proposed in the past .",
    "we view this work only as a first ( but compelling ) step toward understanding the systematic formation of planets ; the evolution that results in the formation of the entire solar system likely involves additional processes and physics ( e.g. , dissipative disk accretion , magnetic fields ) that are necessary in delineating its present structure and composition .",
    "however , we believe that the condensed solid cores inside the gravitational potential minima of the solar nebula could possibly survive the subsequent evolution and could form planets at the same orbital locations . furthermore , we hope that the results presented here will provide the motivation behind the formulation of some novel hypotheses concerning the formation and the dynamical evolution of certain sectors in the early solar system and in the recently discovered extrasolar planetary systems ( see the reviews of lissauer [ 1993 ] , beckwith & sargent [ 1996 ] , and marcy et al . [ 2005 ] ) . some of the ideas that emerge from our study are outlined below .",
    "our results support the segregation of condensates at specific radii in which the gas density is larger than the mean background value ( fig .  3 and table  2 ) .",
    "these orbital locations in the midplane of the disk are ideal sites for growing planitesimals by accumulation of smaller bodies in a systematic ( nonrandom ) way . in the best ",
    "fit density profile @xmath347 with @xmath292 , the absolute spacing of these sites of concentrated material depends on a single parameter , the length scale of the disk ( @xmath210  au ) which is a measure of the entropy content of the gas ( see eq .  [ [ crho ] ] ) .",
    "the segregation of condensates in initially shallow ( see table 3 ) gravitational potential wells should be tested by computational experiments because this kind of work may potentially lead to improved protoplanetary models .",
    "numerical work is quite common in investigations of the early solar system but the simulations have always started from arbitrary initial conditions ( e.g. , wetherill 1989 ; ruzmaikina , safronov , & weidenschilling 1989 ; bodenheimer , ruzmaikina , & mathieu 1993 ; boss 1995 ) because of the limited information that can be collected from observations , meteorites , and laboratory experiments .",
    "our results can potentially provide a better handle on the appropriate initial conditions for simulations of this type .",
    "numerical investigations of planet migration have intensified over the past 10 years ( see the progress report by levison et al . [ 2007 ] ) in an attempt to understand the complex dynamics observed in the kuiper belt : the trapping of some small objects in the mean  motion resonances of neptune , the gravitational scattering of other small objects to high inclinations , the severe mass deficiency ( by at least a factor of 100 ) of the entire kuiper belt , and the abrupt outer  edge \" or  gap \" of the classical kuiper belt at 4748  au ( e.g. , delsanti & jewitt 2006 ) .",
    "our results do not support the idea that the gaseous giant planets have secularly migrated over time to the presently observed radial locations ( fernndez & ip 1984 ; malhotra 1993 , 1995 ; gomes , morbidelli , & levison 2004 ; gomes et al . 2005 ) . the quality of our best ",
    "fit model of planetary distances is so high ( see   [ solar2 ] ) that it seems improbable that any planet that scattered small planitesimals has managed to jump out of its local gravitational potential well and has moved to a new location inside an adjacent potential well .    on the other hand",
    ", the displacement of a planet within its potential well appears viable in the context of our model , and the potential wells of the gaseous giants are quite large in size ( see table  3 and fig .",
    "3a ) : uranus and neptune are both orbiting on potential minima of radial half ",
    "width @xmath348  au ; saturn s minimum has @xmath349  au ; and jupiter s minimum has @xmath350  au .",
    "these values are not very different than the migration distances used so far in the numerical simulations ; only saturn presents a challenge because its potential well is too steep at smaller radii to allow for an outward migration of more than @xmath2600.1  au to its present location .",
    "perhaps new models of planet migration can be constructed in which these results will be taken into account .",
    "fig .  3b and table 3",
    "show that the first density minimum in the best ",
    "fit model of the solar nebula occurs at @xmath351  au .",
    "this suggests that there were no likely planetary sites interior to the orbit of mercury .",
    "it also suggests that there was a significantly lower concentration of condensates within this minimum , in the area below the baseline that extends approximately from 0.1  au to 0.3  au . since we expect that our solar system is in no way special but rather representative of large planetary systems around solar  type stars , we believe that the same deficiency of solids should also exist in the inner regions of other protostellar disks that are currently in the process of forming their protostars and protoplanets .",
    "we think that such an inner gap in condensates is currently inferred in the circumstellar disks of some pre ",
    "main  sequence stars ; these disks show almost no near  infrared radiation emanating from the inner @xmath352 au ( strom , edwards , & skrutskie 1993 ; beckwith & sargent 1993 ; millan  gabet et al .",
    "2001 ; akeson et al . 2005 ; fedele et al . 2008 ) .",
    "the alternative view is that an orbiting protoplanet may have cleared a gap in that area .",
    "although this may be possible in small heavy disks where large planets could form very close to their stars ( christodoulou & kazanas 2008 ) , it can not explain large systems like our own in which gas giants are not expected to form within the inner 0.3  au .",
    "it is believed on theoretical grounds that terrestrial planets are commonly formed near their central stars and that it is unlikely to have a gaseous giant form closer to the center than about 4  au ( boss 1995 ) . accordingly , our solar system is presumed to be typical of planetary systems around other stars . on the other hand , most of the extrasolar planets found to date do not fit in this theoretical picture .",
    "the currently available sample of extrasolar planets is strongly biased toward giant planets because small perturbing masses can not be easily resolved by observations , so it is understood that it will take more time before large extrasolar systems comparable to our own can be detected .",
    "nevertheless , there is presently no doubt that in many extrasolar systems , a large number of massive planets exist very close to their stars ( the trail of discovery started with the planet at 0.05  au in 51  peg found by mayor & queloz [ 1995 ] and the planet at 0.48  au in 70 vir found by marcy & butler [ 1996 ] ) .",
    "this discrepancy seems to point to the hypothesis that the cores of these planets have formed farther away and that the objects have migrated inward to the observationally inferred distances ( kary & lissauer 1995 ; lin , bodenheimer , & richardson 1996 ) , perhaps destroying in the process the orbits of terrestrial planets that could have existed closer to central stars .",
    "migrating giant planets can not be accounted for in our model , so we will have to wait until observations can detect some large extrasolar systems similar to our own . however , two small multiple ",
    "planet systems have already been detected which are different than our solar system , but their planetary distributions appear to be more in line with a sequence of well  ordered density peaks as predicted by our model .",
    "these systems are 55  cancri ( fischer et al .",
    "2008 ) and hd  37124 ( vogt et al .",
    "2005 ) . using updated data from the `` catalog of nearby exoplanets '' ( http://exoplanets.org and butler et al . [ 2006 ] ) ,",
    "we find that the ratios of semimajor axes of the three innermost planets in these two systems are  @xmath353  and  @xmath354 .",
    "these ratios are barely larger than those in our solar system ( 1.9 and 1.4 , respectively ) .",
    "in contrast , all the other systems in the catalog with three or more exoplanets have  @xmath355   and/or  @xmath356 ,  ratios that are too large compared to those in 55  cancri , hd  37124 , and our solar system .",
    "we see then that the relative distributions of planetary orbits in 55  cancri and hd  37124 are effectively the same , despite the fact that these two well  ordered systems are much smaller than our solar system and their central stars have widely different chemical compositions ( 55  cancri is very metal  rich , while hd  37124 is very metal  poor ) .",
    "55  cancri is now believed to have 5 planets in remarkably circular orbits ( fischer et al .",
    "2008 ) , and this number is enough to allow for our type of modeling for this system .",
    "we have carried out the analysis of 55  cancri and we present our results in a companion paper ( christodoulou & kazanas 2008 ) .",

    "<S> we have derived exact solutions of the isothermal lane  emden equation with and without rotation in a cylindrical geometry . </S>",
    "<S> the corresponding hydrostatic equilibria are relevant to the dynamics of the solar nebula before and during the stages of planet and satellite formation . </S>",
    "<S> the nonrotating solution for the mass density is analytic , nonsingular , monotonically decreasing with radius , and it satisfies easily the usual physical boundary conditions at the center . when differential rotation is added to the lane  emden equation , a new class of exact solutions for the mass density appears . we have determined all of these solutions analytically as well . within this class , solutions that are </S>",
    "<S> power laws or combinations of power laws are not capable of satisfying the associated boundary  value problem , but they are nonetheless of profound importance because they constitute `` baselines '' to which the actual solutions approach when the central boundary conditions are imposed . numerical integrations that enforce such physical boundary conditions show that the actual radial equilibrium density profiles emerge from the center close to the nonrotating solution , but once they cross below the corresponding baselines , they cease to be monotonic . the actual solutions are forced to oscillate permanently about the baseline solutions without ever settling onto them because the central boundary conditions strictly prohibit the matching of the two types of solutions .    </S>",
    "<S> this oscillatory behavior of the isothermal solutions to the lane  emden boundary  value problem is entirely generic and extends to polytropic models as well . </S>",
    "<S> based on our results , we expect that quasistatically  evolving protoplanetary disks should develop oscillatory radial density profiles in their midplanes during the isothermal phase of their collapse . </S>",
    "<S> the peaks in these profiles correspond to local gravitational potential minima and their radial locations are ideal sites for the formation of protoplanets ; sites that can be accentuated during infall of more matter from the still  collapsing cloud . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , a straightforward application to our solar system using an oscillatory solution derived from a differentially  rotating baseline yields a highly accurate match ( mean relative error @xmath0 ) between the radial density peaks of the model and the semimajor axes of all the major planets and the dwarf planets , provided that the mean density profile between 0.8 au and 11.3 au falls off with radius as @xmath1 ( corresponding to a mean surface density variation of @xmath2 that is consistent with the profile determined empirically by weidenschilling in 1977 ) . </S>",
    "<S> we believe then that for the first time in over two centuries we have a mathematically rigorous explanation of all planetary orbits in our solar system and the physics that is responsible for planet formation at radii that are not in the least random or arbitrary . </S>"
