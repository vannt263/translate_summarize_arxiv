    "there is now high quality x - ray data available for many clusters and recently many authors have studied cluster samples in order to search for such fundamental relations ( e.g. , fukazawa 1997 ; allen & fabian 1998 ( also these proceedings , atp ) ; arnaud & evrard 1999 ; ettori & fabian 1999 ( atp ) ; horner et al .  1999 ;",

    "this sample as well as some additionally included clusters not meeting the strict selection criteria represent a great opportunity to correlate the physical properties of nearby clusters . here",
    "we give the preliminary results . throughout @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3",
    "we used mainly high exposure rosat pspc pointed observations to determine the surface brightness profiles of the clusters , excluding obvious point sources . if no pointed pspc observations were available in the archive or if clusters were too large for the field of view of the pspc we used rass data . to calculate the gas density profiles the standard @xmath4-model ( cavaliere & fusco - femiano 1976 ) , ( gorenstein et al .  1978 ) ( equ .",

    "@xmath5 @xmath6 fitting the corresponding surface brightness formula ( equ .  [ reiprich_beta2 ] ) to the observed surface brightness profiles gives the parameters needed to derive the gas density profiles . to check if the often detected central excess emission ( central surface brightness of a cluster exceeding the fit value ) biases the mass determination we also fitted a double @xmath4-model of the form @xmath7 and calculated the gas mass profiles by @xmath8 .",
    "comparison of the single and double @xmath4-model gas masses shows good agreement .",

    "plugging equ.[reiprich_beta1 ] into the hydrostatic equation and assuming the intracluster gas to be isothermal yields the gravitational mass profile @xmath10    having acquired the gravitational mass profiles for the clusters it is now important to determine the radius within which to determine the cluster mass .",

    "we calculated @xmath13 at @xmath11 and also @xmath14 which is usually referred to as the virial radius . using these definitions of the outer radius instead of a fixed length , e.g. , one abell radius ( @xmath15 ) , also allows the uniform treatment of clusters of different size .",

    "these large differences may indicate an evolutionary effect , in the sense that for @xmath63 high redshift clusters have a higher temperature at the same gas mass .",
    "this interpretation is supported by the fact that schindlers @xmath64 relation has a steeper slope than the same relation for nearby samples .",
    "but the uncertainties are too large for a final decision .    our measured relation @xmath65 ( fig.[reiprich_fig2 ] ) is steeper than the expected value of 1.5 for the exponent",
    ". a similar discrepancy has also been found by other authors ( mohr et al .",
    "1999 ; horner et al .",

    "( 1996 ) is a factor of @xmath67 higher than our measured normalization . in general one",
    "should keep in mind that @xmath9 and @xmath13 are not two independently measured quantities ( equ.[reiprich_hy ] ) , which complicates the interpretation of the fitting result .    scaling",
    "laws predict @xmath68 .",
    "we measure @xmath69 ( fig .",
    "[ reiprich_fig6 ] ) , which is in reasonable agreement .",
    "if clusters were exactly self - similar objects , the gas mass fraction at a characteristic radius should be constant for all clusters .",
    "several authors have related measured values of @xmath70 and @xmath71 or @xmath9 . up to now there is not even qualitative agreement on the form of this relation .",
    "for example david et al.(1995 ) found indications for an increase of @xmath70 with increasing @xmath9 , allen & fabian ( 1998 ) for a sample of x - ray luminous clusters found indications for a decrease of @xmath70 with increasing @xmath9 , ettori & fabian ( 1999 ) found no dependence of @xmath70 on @xmath13 for high luminosity clusters , but instead found indications for a decrease of @xmath70 with increasing redshift . we find @xmath72 ( fig.[reiprich_fig3 ] ) but as noted earlier a simple power law description of this relation may not be very useful .",
    "the gas mass fraction stays fairly constant for @xmath73 but seems to decrease strongly below this mass .",
    "we next consider the gas mass fractions determined within two different characteristic radii ( @xmath11 and @xmath14 ) and relate the ratio of these two fractions to the gravitational mass .",
    "fig.[reiprich_fig4 ] exhibits several interesting features .",
    "a ) the gas mass fractions are in general larger when measured within larger radii , as noted by previous authors ( e.g. , david et al .",
    "this means the gas distribution is flatter than the dark matter distribution in the outer parts of clusters .",
    "b ) the increase of @xmath70 with radius gets smaller towards higher mass clusters .",
    "a qualitatively similar trend has also been found by schindler ( 1999 ) .",
    "c ) for clusters with @xmath74 the gas mass fractions seem to decrease with increasing radius .",
    "these features are qualitatively consistent with non - gravitational energy input affecting less massive groups / clusters more than massive clusters ( e.g. , supernova driven galactic winds ) .",
    "these features do not suggest a universal value for the gas mass fraction , @xmath70 rather seems to depend on radius and cluster mass .",
    "feature c ) indicates the possibility that estimates of @xmath75 based on extrapolation of @xmath70 within a specific cluster radius to the whole universe may deserve reconsideration .",
    "for instance if the trend of decreasing gas mass fraction towards higher masses and therefore larger radii continues , @xmath75 may have been underestimated previously . but : it is not yet clear if one can draw significant conclusions from fig .",
    "[ reiprich_fig4 ] since determination of masses within @xmath14 generally requires extrapolation beyond the significantly measured cluster emission .",
    "furthermore the hydrostatic assumption , fundamental for the gravitational mass estimate , may not always be justified at @xmath76 .",
    "therefore this relation should be considered as tentative .",
    "we are currently in the process of estimating the errors  which can be large since the gravitational mass plays a key role  in order to quantify the significance of the results .",
    "we find several tight correlations between physical parameters of a large sample of galaxy clusters .",
    "not all of the slopes agree with expectations from simple self - similar scaling relations and some also can not be made compatible if variations in the gas mass fractions are taken into account .",
    "slight deviations from pure power laws are found . except the weak bend in the @xmath77 relation they",
    "may qualitatively be explained by assuming that a non - gravitational energy input has taken place in clusters .",
    "comparison to relations of high redshift clusters gives a weak indication for evolution , in the sense that clusters at high redshift have a higher gas temperature at a given gas mass .",
    "it is suggested that it may be difficult to assign a universal gas mass fraction to galaxy clusters , since the gas mass fraction seems to depend on radius and cluster mass .",
