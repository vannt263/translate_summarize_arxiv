    "there is an ongoing interest in correlation properties of the calogero - sutherland model ( csm ) . from the theoretical perspective",
    "the calogero - sutherland model provides a rare example of exactly solvable model with relatively simple structure of eigenstates . in the present work we address the question of coherence properties of the csm measured by the off - diagonal correlation functions .",
    "our study complements the previous results on the diagonal density - density correlation properties of the csm and alows to draw conclusions about the coexistence of both types of long - range correlations in an appropriate interval of the interaction parameter",
    ".    introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite , the csm describes a system of particles interacting with a scale - free potential , which is inversely proportional to the square of the distance between particles .",
    "the ground state wave function was shown to have a form which is factorizable over pairs of particles .",
    "each factor is proportional to @xmath0 with @xmath1 being the coordinates of particles forming a pair and the parameter @xmath2 being directly related to the interaction strength .",
    "in addition to the convenient description of the excitations in terms of non - interacting particles with fractional statistics @xcite , this particular form of the ground state suggested a possibility to study correlations functions of this model .",
    "indeed , it was noted in @xcite that for three special values @xmath3 and @xmath4 the ground state probability of the csm coincides with the probability distribution of the eigenvalues of unitary random matrices , so the early results of dyson @xcite describe the static density correlations in the csm .",
    "the analogy with random matrix theory allows also the calculation of dynamical density correlations @xcite and dynamical green s function @xcite . to deal with other values of interactions",
    "the jack polynomial method has been applied to find correlation functions for integer @xcite and rational @xcite values of @xmath2 .",
    "the common drawback of these methods for a rational @xmath5 is that the final expression for the correlation function is usually given as a sum over fractional excitations involving @xmath6 particle and hole quantum numbers , which goes over @xmath6 integrals in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "such a decomposition makes the result appear as a highly irregular function of the coupling constant @xmath2 , leaving little hope of approaching its irrational values .",
    "recently , there has been success @xcite in obtaining the density - density correlation functions of the csm for arbitrary coupling @xmath2 , leading to transparent asymptotic expressions in the long - distance limit . based on the replica method from the theory of disordered systems , this approach involves the representation of the correlation functions using a duality transformation as an @xmath7-dimensional integral with eventual analytic continuation in @xmath7 .",
    "similar methods were applied recently @xcite to study off - diagonal correlations of one - dimensional impenetrable bosons , equivalent to the bosonic csm for one specific value of @xmath8 . for recent progress in calculation of correlation functions of integrable models such as heisenberg spin chain see @xcite and references therein .",
    "results for delta - interacting bosons can be found in the book @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we extend the replica method for studying the off - diagonal correlations ( equal - time green s function ) and corresponding momentum distributions .",
    "the main result is the exact long - distance asymptotic behaviour of the one - body density matrix in the form of the haldane s universal hydrodynamic expansion @xcite .",
    "we consider both bosonic and fermionic statistics of the particles encoded in the symmetry of the wavefunctions using the definitions of the original work of sutherland @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "being irrelevant for the density correlations , the quantum statistics affects drastically the results for the off - diagonal correlations .",
    "in addition , we study the short - distance behaviour of the one - body density matrix and find several leading terms ( analytic and non - analytic ) in the short - distance expansion . the latter is directly related to the high - momentum tails of the momentum distribution .",
    "the short - distance ( high momentum ) physics enters the expressions for potential and kinetic energies which we calculate as a function of interactions by using the hellmann - feynman theorem .",
    "to check our predictions we use a monte carlo method to calculate numerically the correlation functions for arbitrary distances and different values of the interaction parameter .",
    "the advantage of the calogero - sutherland model is that its ground state wavefunction is known explicitly and can be easily sampled by metropolis algorithm .",
    "this permits us to obtain unambiguous results for intermediate distances , where analytical methods fail .",
    "combining these results with previous knowledge of the diagonal two - body correlations ( pair distribution function ) @xcite allows us to describe different physical regimes of the csm at zero temperature .",
    "in particular , we discuss long- and short - range order as a function of the coupling constant @xmath2 for diagonal and off - diagonal correlations . since the true long - range order is absent in one dimension , we define it through the correlation function of the ( local ) order parameter which has the slowest power - law decay and use the word `` quasi '' to stress this peculiarity of one dimension .",
    "we propose a phase diagram which describes ( in order of increasing interaction strength ) the crossover between three physical regimes : the quasi - condensate , quasi - supersolid and quasi - crystal .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : csm ] we introduce the hamitltonian of the calogero - sutherland model , its solution for the ground state and define correlation functions of interest . in section",
    "[ sec : obdm ] we present the calculation of the one - body density matrix based on the replica method and discuss the thermodynamic limit in section  [ sec : thermo_lim ] .",

    "we consider a finite system of @xmath9 particles of mass @xmath7 on a ring of length @xmath10 .",
    "the hamiltonian of the calogero - sutherland model is given by the sum of the kinetic energy and pair interactions controlled by parameter @xmath2 : @xmath11.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the interaction between two particles on the ring is inversely proportional to square of the chord distance between them .",
    "it becomes an inverse square potential in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "the ground state wave function of the hamiltonian ( [ ham ] ) was found in @xcite and can be written as : @xmath12 here @xmath13 is the normalization constant given by @xmath14    the expression ( [ gs ] ) , as it stands , is valid only for a particular ordering of particles , for instance @xmath15 . to extend the expression ( [ gs ] ) to other ordering configuration one",

    "as we shall see different quantum statistics of particles is crucial for off - diagonal correlations , which was already noted in the context of the calogero - sutherland model in early works @xcite .",
    "the main quantity of interest is the one - body density matrix which in terms of the ground state wave function is written as @xmath22 due to the translational invariance in a homogeneous system the one - body density matrix is a function of the difference @xmath23 only .",
    "knowledge of the one - body density matrix enables one to calculate the momentum distribution as the fourier transform : @xmath24 the one - body density matrix has dimensions of density and is normalized so that @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the particle density .",
    "the momentum distribution @xmath27 is dimensionless , it is defined for @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is an integer , and is normalized to the total number of particles @xmath30 .",

    "it is independent of statistics , as it involves only the absolute value of the ground state wavefunction . in the next section",
    "we calculate analytically the one - body density matrix ( [ g1_def ] ) .",
    "the results for the pair distribution function ( [ g2_def ] ) were obtained in @xcite and we reproduce them in the section  [ num : pair_dist ] .",
    "to calculate the one - body density matrix we define the dimensionless function @xmath36 such that @xmath37 and @xmath38 . factorizing the ground state wave function ( [ gs_mod ] ) we rewrite the definition ( [ g1_def ] ) in the form of the average @xmath39 where the average is defined as @xmath40 and @xmath41 is the vandermonde determinant @xmath42 here we have changed the number of particles from @xmath9 to @xmath43 in order to deal with @xmath9 dimensional integrals .",
    "this difference does not matter in the thermodynamic limit , and for the finite system we will restore the correct number of particles in the final expressions .    to calculate the average in ( [ eq : g1 ] ) we use the replica trick , along the lines of the calculation in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "namely , consider the following function @xmath44    it can be shown along the lines of @xcite that @xmath36 is obtained from @xmath45 by the analytical continuation @xmath46 .",
    "later we discuss this procedure in some detail and show how the quantum statistics of the particles , bosonic or fermionic , appears naturally in our calculations . for the moment we take advantage of the duality transformation @xcite , which enables one to re - express the @xmath9-dimensional integral ( [ eq : z_def ] ) depending on the parameter @xmath7 as a @xmath7-dimensional integral depending on @xmath9 as a parameter : @xmath47 the duality @xmath48 becomes evident by comparing the power of vandermonde determinants in eqs .",
