    "the ability to effect quantum control at the molecular level has many potential applications , such as control of reaction dynamics @xcite , selective electron localization @xcite , and applications in quantum information processing @xcite . in order to characterize control mechanisms and afford useful comparison between experiment and theory the hydrogen diatomic ( and its ion , h@xmath0 )",
    "is often used as a test - bed .",
    "such fundamental systems are extremely useful for identifying basic physical mechanisms because of their simple electronic structure .",
    "the heavier isotopes of hydrogen , such as deuterium and deuterium hydride are equally accessible for quantum simulations and execute slower nuclear motion , thus deuterium ( d@xmath4 ) has become the preferred target for time - resolved studies .    in recent years",
    ", ultrashort laser pulses have been used to initiate , image @xcite and control @xcite the ultrafast dissociation of d@xmath0 , with the localization of the remaining bound electron also manipulated @xcite . however , such control of fundamental molecular motion has not been limited to dissociation dynamics and progress has been made on studies of bound wavepacket motion , with control mediated by interactions occurring on timescales shorter than the motion itself .",
    "for example , coherent rotational motion in molecules can be induced and controlled @xcite in diatomic systems using intense - field pulses on sub - rotational timescales , with the mapping of rapidly rotating ( hydrogenic ) diatomics being recently achieved @xcite .",
    "several proposals for coherent control of vibration in the deuterium molecular ion have been put forward , with similar underlying principles @xcite .",
    "firstly an ultrashort ` pump ' pulse can be used to induce strong field tunnel ionization of a d@xmath4 target on a sub - vibrational timescale ( @xmath5 25 fs ) , creating a d@xmath0 nuclear wavepacket in a coherent superposition of vibrational states .",
    "taking @xmath6 as the moment of creation of the molecular ion state , the subsequent vibration can be given by the eigenfunction expansion : @xmath7 where , @xmath8 denotes the set of vibrational eigenstates ( discrete and continuous ) of the molecular ion , and @xmath9 the corresponding energies .",
    "each bound eigenstate component has an associated amplitude @xmath10 and evolves with frequency @xmath11 , where the population of each @xmath12 state is @xmath13 .",
    "the evolution of the probability density is dictated by the beat frequencies ( @xmath14 ) between the eigenstates @xcite with periods on the order of 20 - 30 fs for first order beats ( @xmath15 ) .",
    "the anharmonicity of the potential means that the eigenstate components de - phase within a few vibration cycles @xcite .",
    "the wavepacket will become spatially de - localised across the potential as time evolves but will re - form ( to execute well defined oscillations ) whenever the phases of the components in ( [ eqn : vibrational - expansion ] ) match .",
    "that is , when the beats have re - phased .",
    "this quantum ` revival ' ( at @xmath16 fs ) was recently measured @xcite and well reproduced by simulations @xcite . in these experiments",
    "rotational effects in the molecular ion were found to be negligible @xcite due to the large range of vibrational states occupied , each with different rotational constants @xcite .",
    "suppose that , after some time @xmath17 in the wavepacket evolution , a secondary ( control ) pulse is used to alter the vibrational wavepacket .",
    "it has been shown that an infrared control pulse can produce an ac stark - effect that distorts the potential well ( adiabatically ) and hence modifies the wavepacket motion @xcite .",
    "depending on the wavepacket motion and position when the pulse is applied , a relative enhancement of lower vibrational populations may occur , i.e. vibrational cooling .",
    "while the adiabatic picture provides a useful physical interpretation , it does not fully explain the redistribution process .    to describe this , a raman - type scheme has been proposed @xcite where portions of the wavepacket may be transferred between the 1s@xmath18 ( bound ) and 2p@xmath19 ( dissociative ) potential , as seen in figure [ fig : schematic ] . in recent simulations , high - intensity pulses ( @xmath20 10@xmath21 w @xmath3 ) have been used to enforce vibrational squeezing or ` quenching ' into a specific state @xcite or to create a coherent 2 ( or 3 ) state wavepacket @xcite .",
    "these studies were conducted with short delay times ( @xmath22 fs ) , where the first - order vibrational beat components are de - phasing .    in this article , we show that intermediate intensity ( @xmath23 w @xmath3 ) , few - cycle ( 5 fs ) control pulses have important applications for coherent manipulation .",
    "we find a fascinating and hitherto unseen ` chessboard ' pattern in the redistribution .",
    "in a different outcome to previous quenching / cooling studies , it is possible to selectively enhance almost _ exclusively even _ or _ exclusively odd _ numbered vibrational states .",
    "thus the process relies on coherence in the energy domain , rather than wavepacket manipulation in the time - domain .",
    "it is found that the mechanism of this process relies on constructive / destructive interference .",
    "this effect can be exploited at a fractional revival time to create strong - contrast interference patterns .",

    "an intense infrared pump laser interacts with the d@xmath4 target in its ground vibrational state .",
    "the ionization process creates a coherent superposition of d@xmath0 1s@xmath18 vibrational modes displaced from the minimum of the well .",
    "the wavepacket then oscillates , due to the displacement , and disperses , due to the anharmonicity of the d@xmath24 state ( silver arrow ) . the classical vibrational period ( that is , the centre of mass of the oscillation ) is approximately 25 fs , while the vibrational modes will fully de - phase and re - phase ( ` revive ' ) after around 550 fs .",

    "the application of a secondary , control pulse initiates raman transitions via the 2p@xmath19 surface ( blue / red arrows ) , acting to redistribute the vibrational distribution of the wavepacket .",
    "this new vibrational distribution is studied as a function of the control pulse delay time , @xmath17 .",
    "the initial d@xmath4 target can be assumed to reside in the ground vibrational state of the @xmath26 potential . in the franck - condon ( fc ) approximation",
    ", the ionization event would simply project this vibration function onto the manifold of vibrational states of the ion . regarding this pump process",
    ", it is well known ( see @xcite , for example ) that the tunnelling - ionization rate varies with bond - length , even for the compact wavepacket presented by the d@xmath27 ground vibrational state .",
    "this can modify the simple fc approximation that assumes the wavepacket is projected without modulation .",
    "we have carried out simulations using modulated wavepackets ( displaced / broadened / skewed ) as well as the fc wavepacket and find that the ` chessboard ' interference effect we report here can be produced for each distribution.the fc approximation will be used here to demonstrate the ` chessboard ' effect but it is not a necessary condition .",
    "a wavepacket with a range of populated vibrational states ( such as those produced by intense infrared lasers ) is sufficient . for initial distributions in a narrow range of vibrational states",
    ", the interference effects may not extend over as many states but will still occur . indeed , for any experimental investigation the pump pulse parameters should be carefully chosen and compared to simulations for appropriate initial wavepacket conditions .",
    "after the pump process , the fc wavepacket resides in the ground electronic state of the d@xmath0 ion . at intermediate intensities , it is sufficient to solve the time - dependent equation for evolution on the two lowest potential curves ( 1s@xmath18 and 2p@xmath19 ) within the born - oppenheimer approximation . with the infrared frequencies considered here ,",
    "these two low lying levels need only be considered as higher - lying electronic states are inaccessible .",
    "thus the configuration space can be partitioned into @xmath28 and @xmath29 components . then the hamiltonian , @xmath30 , can be partitioned into vibration , electronic motion , and laser interaction as follows : @xmath31 this has the matrix representation : @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the vibrational kinetic energy operator , @xmath34 and @xmath35 are the potential energy curves for the 1s@xmath18 and 2p@xmath19 electronic states respectively , and @xmath36 is the dipole moment between these states @xcite . the external electric field @xmath37 is created by a ti : sapphire laser with @xmath1 nm , modulated by a gaussian profile centred at @xmath38 ( the delay time ) , with full - width - half - maximum of @xmath39 ( the duration ) , that is :    @xmath40    the ( cycle - average ) intensity , @xmath41 , of the pulse is related to the electric field amplitude , @xmath42 , by the formula , @xmath43 .",
    "the evolution of the equations is computed by a symmetric , split - step algorithm @xcite : @xmath44 the error term in this expression arises partly from the splitting ( factorization ) and from assuming the hamiltonian changes slowly over the time step ( time - ordering error ) . in practice",
    ", the time - step @xmath45 is chosen sufficiently small so that , @xmath46 .",
    "the splitting and the use of a uniform grid means the highly - efficient fast fourier transform @xcite can be employed .",

    "the situation is opposite , yielding destructive and constructive interference for @xmath72 fs and 306 fs respectively .",

    "the effect of a laser pulse after a delay @xmath17 can now be considered .",
    "a simple mathematical model can be constructed where the the modulated sinusoidal signal of the laser pulse is considered as a sequence of alternating square waveforms .",

    "as seen in figure [ fig : couplingfig ] , the matrix element @xmath108 provides an approximate selection rule : @xmath109 , so that the expression can be reduced even further .",
    "moreover , since @xmath110 , then the solution can be expressed in the simple form : @xmath111 where , @xmath112 - 1 \\over   i(e_n - e_{n ' } ) }   \\right )   \\quad .\\ ] ] in the case of a very short impulse , corresponding to a half - cycle , @xmath113 , and : @xmath114 the term @xmath115 simply reflects the change in phase due to the quadratic stark effect . since this is a second - order effect , the sign of @xmath42 has no consequence , and @xmath116 , and hence there is a phase advance .",
    "this is illustrated in figure [ fig : clockfig ] where the parent state is phase shifted forward , with the excited state @xmath77 more advanced than the lower - energy state @xmath76 , in agreement with this expression for the energy dependence .",

    "must be approximately the same size as the remaining term @xmath120 for @xmath121 .",
    "this gives an optimal value of @xmath42 and @xmath99 .",
    "next , the phases of the two interference terms must be equal , which implies the condition ( for all @xmath12 ) : @xmath122 a rough estimate of this condition on @xmath17 , can be made by the anharmonic expansion , @xmath123 , where @xmath124 is the dissociation energy .",

    "finally , these terms must be out of phase with @xmath126 to create destructive interference .",
    "the stark effect ( [ eqn : final - population ] ) creates a phase shift , @xmath127 , for the state @xmath12 .",

    "furthermore , if destructive interference is observed for a state at @xmath129 , constructive interference will be observed for @xmath130 fs .",
    "this is a qualitative explanation , and is limited by the crudeness of the closure approximation .",

    "@xcite , coherent vibrational wavepacket motion in d@xmath0 has been initiated and imaged in a pump - probe configuration using short intense - field pulses . in these studies the vibrational wavepacket motion , and notably the vibrational revival , has been imaged by using a probe pulse to enforce photodissociation or coulomb explosion of the vibrating molecule across a range of probe delay times .",
    "fourier analysis of the fragmentation yield can return a measure of both the temporal and spatial nature of the wavepacket motion , which can ultimately lead to full characterization of the molecular motion @xcite .",
    "in particular , the beat frequencies that dictate the motion of the probability density can be extracted from the photodissociation signal .",
    "thus it may be possible to conduct a pump - control - probe experiment where a new coherent vibrational distribution ( created at a specific control pulse delay time ) may be monitored by recording the total dissociation yield as a function of probe delay time ( @xmath134 ) with subsequent spectral analysis of the signal .",
    "it is important that for modelling any such experiment , the pump process is well characterised . for pulse intensities of @xmath65 1@xmath135 w @xmath3 the @xmath136-dependence ( see @xcite and references therein ) of the pump process has been considered in recent studies of d@xmath0 wavepackets @xcite , and indeed in some recent experiments @xcite the results appear to deviate from an fc wavepacket .",
    "it is noted here that the r - dependence of the pump process is sensitive to pulse intensity @xcite and , as pulse intensity increases , the resulting ion may tend towards an fc distribution @xcite , however , if the intensity is set too high there is a probability that direct fragmentation of the d@xmath4 target may occur in the initial pump pulse , clouding the detection of any bound wavepacket dynamics from the control or probe pulse interactions .    at this point , it is instructive to observe that in other recent experiments @xcite with pump pulses ( @xmath1 nm ) of duration @xmath137 fs , and intensities of @xmath138 w @xmath3 the wavepacket dynamics are in fact well reproduced by franck - condon simulations . in these experiments",
    "the problem of direct d@xmath4 fragmentation from an intense pump pulse is overcome by orienting the pump pulse polarisation perpendicular to the detection axis , ensuring that any direct fragmentation arising from this pulse goes undetected .    in this context , the proposed experimental technique for identifying the chessboard effect has been simulated for an fc wavepacket .",
    "this was done by fixing the control pulse at a desired @xmath17 value , and introducing an intense probe pulse ( 5 fs duration , @xmath139 w @xmath3 ) at a variable delay time @xmath134 .",
    "the dissociation yield was deduced by subtracting the remaining bound wavepacket population from the initial norm of the wavepacket .",
    "the fourier transform ( energy spectral density ) of the dissociation signal is shown in figure [ fig : fftfig_expt_observable ] for control delay times of ( a ) @xmath140 fs and ( b ) @xmath56 fs .",
    "the calculations represent the signal correlation over very long times ( 4000 fs ) .",
    "we have performed the same analysis over a much shorter time ( 1000 fs ) and , although the features are broadened , the signatures are still clearly visible .",
    "the individual states in the vibrational distribution are not resolved in isolation but rather the peaks in figure [ fig : fftfig_expt_observable ] ( a ) correspond to the beat frequencies between even states .",
    "these are notably absent in figure [ fig : fftfig_expt_observable ] ( b ) , where only the odd numbered eigenstate beat frequencies are observed , in keeping with the expected vibrational distributions ( from figure [ fig : bigfig ] ) .",
    "the amplitude of the beat @xmath141 in the wavepacket motion is given by @xmath142 .",
    "the fourier transform technique will not extract the absolute population values , @xmath142 but rather , will provide insight into which states are significantly populated .",
    "this is a useful technique for experimentally identifying the preferential creation of either _ even _ or _ odd _ numbered states .",
    "it should be noted however that periods of the @xmath141 beats are typically @xmath143 fs and thus for any experimental verification , it is imperative that pulses as short as 5 fs are used .    in principle ,",
    "this technique using the photodissociation signal could be a useful method for identifying the main components of the wavepacket , and with state - of - the - art pulses now available for durations less than 10 fs , this should be achievable in the laboratory in the not too distant future .",
    "indeed , with continuing advances in intense - field laser - pulse experiments , such an even ( or odd ) state wavepacket ( evolving with @xmath65 12 fs oscillations ) may even be characterized by using a high - intensity probe pulse and a very recently reported ` time - series analysis ' of the coulomb explosion signal @xcite , where full reconstruction of the wavepacket has been proposed .",
    "in this article , the application of an intermediate intensity ( @xmath144 w @xmath3 ) few - cycle ( 5 fs ) pulse to control a coherent vibrational wavepacket in d@xmath0 has been investigated .",
    "the redistribution of vibrational levels proceeds by a raman transfer between near - neighbour levels .",
    "this creates interferences such that it is possible to produce strong - contrast fringes of the even / odd numbered vibrational levels .",
    "the effect is a property of the molecular ion and does not require a highly - selective ionization process .",
    "all that is required is that a band of vibration states is populated .",
    "simulations using the franck - condon approximation are shown for illustration but this is not a necessary condition .",
    "the ` chessboard ' pattern that emerges around @xmath145 fs provides a pathway for creating almost _ exclusively even _ or _ exclusively odd _ numbered vibrational distributions in a coherent wavepacket .",
    "thus the process relies on coherence in the energy domain , rather than wavepacket manipulation in the time - domain .",
    "the subsequent propagation of such a created wavepacket may be probed via photodissociation and here it has been shown that spectral analysis of the dissociation data may serve to identify the populated states .",
    "this provides a pathway for using currently available ultrashort laser pulse technology to investigate this ` chessboard ' effect .",
