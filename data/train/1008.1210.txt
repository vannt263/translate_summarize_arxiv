    "while this feature also coincides with he 1.16296 , 1.1676 , we believe that n is the more the likely : if it is he , its strength is expected to increase with time , as the level of ionization and excitation increases . while such behaviour is seen for the he 1.083 and 2.0581  lines ( fig .",

    "for example , in v2274  cyg the c line at 1.44  ( @xmath28p@xmath29d ) was comparable in strength with br@xmath24 but there is no evidence for it in u  sco .",
    "the emission lines are remarkably broad and the h lines ( pa@xmath25 and br@xmath24 ) consist of a core component and possible broad wings , a detailed discussion of which is given in section  [ fast ] .",

    "a triple - peaked profile is also seen in the o 1.1287  line on 2010 january 28.996 ut , but we caution that the region around this line has low atmospheric transmission and artificial structures can be generated in the profile during spectrum extraction .    the line fluxes for day 0.56 are given in table  [ fluxes ] .",

    "* data obtained on day  0.65 , close to our first spectrum ) eruptions . examination of the br@xmath24 profile in the 2010 eruption ( fig .  [ fig3 ] ) shows a core component with a _ fwzi _ of @xmath33 .",
    "more interesting however is the very extended blueward wing in the profiles for the first 2 days , which extend to about 10000  from the line center .",
    "it is not clear whether an equivalent red wing exists for br@xmath24 , as our spectra do not extend that far redward . for the present we concern ourselves with the 10000  blueward wing .",
    "we first establish that the extended blue wing of br@xmath24 is genuine and intrinsic to the line by noting that the n  1.2461 , 1.2470lines , also plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , exhibit a similar wing .",
    "it is difficult to conclude whether other lines have similar wings .",
    "pa@xmath25 and o  1.1287  are closely flanked on the blue side by other lines .",
    "there may be a wing on he 2.0581  as there is a small undulation at @xmath34 , @xmath35 , for first 2 days ( see fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) ; a similar `` bump '' is seen in the 1999 spectrum of @xcite .",
    "but we again caution that the position of this undulation is in a region of poor atmospheric transmission .",
    "could the wings in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] be caused by additional spectral lines ?",
    "no such line is expected in the case of the n , but the br@xmath24 wing is the site of the he  2.1120 , 2.1132  lines .",
    "however the expected positions of these he lines , marked in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , are not too well centered with the extended wing .",
    "thus it is unlikely that they contaminate the wing .",
    "additionally the he 2.1120  line may be expected to be weaker by a factor of at least 20 compared to he  2.0581  @xcite .",
    "observations of other novae ( e.g. rs oph ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) strongly support this",
    ". however , fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] shows that the strength of the br@xmath24 blue wing , especially in the spectrum 0.56 days after outburst , is too strong compared to he 2.0581 , for it to be caused by the he 2.1120  line .",
    "we thus consider it unlikely that there is any significant presence of he 2.1120  and conclude that the broad wing is intrinsic to br@xmath24 and therefore suggestive of material moving at @xmath1 ; even if this represents the line - of - sight velocity of ejected material , it is well in excess of expected ejecta speeds , even for rne .",
    "it is possible that this material arises in a bipolar flow .",
    "such bipolar flows have been observed in novae ( e.g. rs  oph , v445  pup ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and are explained on the basis of ejected material encountering density enhancements in the equatorial ( orbital ) plane compared to the polar direction ; the outflowing material thus expands more freely in the polar direction , leading to high velocity polar flows .",
    "such an outflow would be expected to be perpendicular to the orbital plane and , in the case of  ( as it is an eclipsing binary with inclination angle @xmath36 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , close to the plane of the sky .",
    "if we assume inclination @xmath36 and opening angle @xmath37 for the jet , the 10000  line - of - sight velocity translates to a space velocity of @xmath38 .",
    "either way a very fast flow is being witnessed , possibly the fastest seen in any nova eruption .",
    "we note that most of the spectral studies of the 1999 outburst showed the h@xmath30 profile to have similar broad wings .",
    "the doubt again arises whether these are intrinsic to the h@xmath30 line or caused by additional lines .",
    "for example @xcite , in a spectrum taken 16 hrs after maximum , assigns the n line at 6482  as a possible cause for the extended blue wing of the h@xmath30 profile .",
    "however , if it is an intrinsic structure and not really n 6482  which is contributing , then it is seen that the wing extends to about 10900  from the line center ( figure 2 of * ? ? ?",
    "this is in good agreement with the above discussion , and is supporting evidence for a very fast flow .     on days 1.54 and 0.56",
    "respectively ; they have a core component between @xmath39 and @xmath40  ( marked by lines ) , and an extended blue wing ( see section  [ fast ] ) . the expected positions of he 2.1120",
    ", 2.1132lines are shown .",
    "profile 3 is for the n 1.2461 , 1.2470  line on day 0.56 , which also shows an extended blue wing .",
    "the ordinate is in arbitrary units with the profiles offset for clarity.,width=288,height=288 ]      in the analysis below we are able to set a useful upper limit on the ejecta mass ; an exact determination is difficult due to uncertainty in the conditions in the ejecta , and the range of velocities present . for the recombination analysis we use the data for 2010 february 2.8 ( day  5.41 )",
    "; we consider this to be the most favourable epoch , because the lines are more likely to be optically thick at earlier times , while the hydrogen lines for day  9.43 are likely contaminated by he pickering lines , which occur at the same wavelengths as the h lines .",
    "we use the best - defined lines from our data for this epoch , namely br@xmath24 , pa@xmath25 and br11 ( 1.6806 ) .",
    "the strengths of the other brackett series lines in the @xmath12 band are difficult to assess because of blending .",
    "we assume there is no significant contribution to the strength of these h lines from the he pickering lines on day  5.41 .",
    "we proceed on the assumption that the ejecta are optically thin in the pa@xmath25 , br@xmath24 and br11 lines .",
    "it is expected that nova ejecta have density in the range @xmath41 to @xmath42  @xmath43 in the early stages .",
    "thus , for example , for @xmath44  @xmath43 and @xmath45  k , case b predicts ratios of 4.76 and 3.8 for pa@xmath25/br@xmath24 and br@xmath24/br  11 respectively .",
    "the observed ratios in  for pa@xmath25/br@xmath24 ( @xmath46 ) and br@xmath24/br  11 ( @xmath47 ) are reasonably in agreement with these predictions , although there is no plausible combination of @xmath48 and @xmath49 that has the pa@xmath25/br@xmath24 ratio as low as @xmath50 ( the case b emissivities at @xmath51  @xmath43 , @xmath52  k are @xmath53 , @xmath54 and @xmath55  erg  @xmath56 s@xmath57 for the pa @xmath25 , br @xmath24 and br  11 lines respectively ; * ? ? ?",
    "if the lines under consideration are largely optically thick , considerable changes are seen in the ratios ( especially in the the br@xmath24/br 11 ratio which can even drop below unity ; see * ? ? ?",

    "we use @xmath67  kpc @xcite , @xmath68  ( although a range of a factor 2 either side of this value is implied by our data ) and values of @xmath69 , @xmath70 and @xmath71  ergs  s@xmath57  @xmath72 measured for the core components of the pa @xmath25 , br@xmath24 and br11 lines respectively .",
    "the greatest uncertainty in our analysis arises from our ignorance of the electron density and temperature in the ejecta , and from our assumption that case  b applies . if we suppose that @xmath73 and @xmath74 , then the mean @xmath75 ( in erg  s@xmath57  @xmath56 ) is @xmath76 , @xmath77 and @xmath78 @xcite for pa@xmath25 , br@xmath24 and br11 respectively , where the `` error bars '' represent the range of values . over this range of @xmath79 and",

    "the observed p@xmath25/br@xmath24 ratio is less than the lowest value expected for case  b , possibly indicating that pa@xmath25 may not be optically thin ; the mass derived from pa@xmath25 may therefore be an underestimate .",
    "we find @xmath80 , @xmath81  and @xmath82 , from pa@xmath25 , br@xmath24 and br11 respectively .",

    "* for a discussion of this point ) , while the uncertainties in @xmath62 are not in any sense `` errors '' and are not distributed normally ) .",

    "we have searched for a f  f excess on the first six days , where the errors on the @xmath0 magnitudes are small .",
    "depending on the reddening , blackbody fits with effective temperatures in the range 6000  8000  k reasonably fit the data .",
    "however , while our analysis shows that a f  f excess might be present in the data , especially in the @xmath13 band , it is marginal and difficult to quantify . in view of this",
