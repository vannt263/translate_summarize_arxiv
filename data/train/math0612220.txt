    "let @xmath7 be a two - sided stochastic process defined on some probability space @xmath8 .",
    "we call a diffusion in the random potential @xmath1 an informal solution @xmath0 of the s.d.e : @xmath9 where @xmath10 is a standard brownian motion independent of @xmath1 . of course , the process @xmath1 may not be differentiable ( for example when @xmath1 is a brownian motion ) and we should formally consider @xmath0 as a diffusion whose conditional generator given @xmath1 is @xmath11 such a diffusion may be explicitly constructed from a brownian motion through a random change of time and a random change of scale . this class of processes has been widely studied for the last twenty years and bears a close connection with the model of the random walk in random environment ( rwre ) , see @xcite and @xcite for a survey on rwre and @xcite , @xcite for the connection between the two models .",
    "this model exhibits many interesting features .",
    "for instance , when the potential process @xmath1 is a brownian motion , the diffusion @xmath0 is recurrent and brox @xcite proved that @xmath12 converges to a non - degenerate distribution .",
    "thus , the diffusion is much `` slower '' than in the trivial case @xmath13 ( then @xmath0 is simply a brownian motion ) .",
    "we point out that brox s theorem is the analogue of sinai s famous theorem for rwre @xcite ( see also @xcite and @xcite ) . just as for the rwre ,",
    "this result is a consequence of a so - called `` localization phenomena '' : the diffusion is trapped in some valleys of its potential @xmath1 .",
    "brox s theorem may also be extended to a wider class of potentials .",
    "for instance , when @xmath1 is a strictly stable process of index @xmath14 $ ] , schumacher @xcite proved that @xmath15 where @xmath16 is a non - degenerate random variable , whose distribution depends on the parameters of the stable process @xmath1 .",
    "there is also much interest concerning the behaviour of @xmath0 in the transient case . when the potential is a drifted brownian motion _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath17 where @xmath18 is a two - sided brownian motion and @xmath19 , then the associated diffusion @xmath0 is transient toward @xmath20 and its rate of growth is polynomial and depends on @xmath21 . precisely , kawazu and tanaka @xcite proved that    * if @xmath22 , then @xmath23 converges in law towards a mittag - leffler distribution of index @xmath21 . *",
    "if @xmath24 , then @xmath25 converges in probability towards @xmath26 . * if @xmath27 , then @xmath28 converges almost surely towards @xmath29 .    in particular , when @xmath30 , the rate of growth of @xmath0 is sub - linear .",
    "refined results on the rates of convergence for this process were later obtained by tanaka @xcite and hu _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite .",
    "in fact , this behaviour is not specific to diffusions in a drifted brownian potential .",
    "more generally , it is proved in @xcite that if @xmath1 is a two - sided lvy process with no positive jumps and if there exists @xmath19 such @xmath31 = 1 $ ] , then the rate of growth of @xmath32 is linear when @xmath33 and of order @xmath34 when @xmath35 ( see also @xcite for a law of large numbers in a general lvy potential ) .",
    "these results are the analogues of those previously obtained by kesten _",
    "@xcite for the discrete model of the rwre .    in this paper",
    ", we study the asymptotic behaviour of a diffusion in a drifted stable potential .",
    "precisely , let @xmath36 denote a two - sided cdlg stable process with index @xmath37 . by two - sided , we mean that    1 .",
    "the process @xmath38 is strictly stable with index @xmath5 , in particular @xmath39 .",
    "2 .   for all @xmath40 , the process @xmath41 has the same law as @xmath4 .",
    "it is well known that the lvy measure @xmath42 of @xmath4 has the form @xmath43 where @xmath44 and @xmath45 are two non - negative constants such that @xmath46 . in particular",
    ", the process @xmath47 has no positive jumps ( resp . no negative jumps ) if and only if @xmath48 ( resp .",
    "@xmath49 ) . given @xmath50",
    ", we consider a diffusion @xmath0 in the random potential @xmath51 since the index @xmath52 of the stable process @xmath4 is larger than @xmath53 , we have @xmath54 = -\\delta x$ ] , and therefore @xmath55 this implies that the random diffusion @xmath0 is transient toward @xmath20 .",
    "we already mentioned that , when @xmath4 has no positive jumps ( _ i.e. _ @xmath56 ) , the rate of transience of @xmath0 is given in @xcite and @xmath32 has a polynomial growth .",
    "thus , we now assume that @xmath4 possesses positive jumps .",
    "[ maintheo ] assume that @xmath57 , then @xmath58 where @xmath59 denotes an exponential law with parameter @xmath60 .",
    "this result also holds with @xmath61 or @xmath62 in place of @xmath32 .",
    "the asymptotic behaviour of @xmath0 is in this case very different from the one observed when @xmath1 is a drifted brownian motion . here",
    ", the rate of growth is very slow : it is the same as in the recurrent setting .",
    "we also note that neither the rate of growth nor the limiting law depend on the value of the drift parameter @xmath3 .",
    "theorem [ maintheo ] has a simple heuristic explanation : the `` localisation phenomena '' for the diffusion @xmath0 tells us that the time needed to reach a positive level @xmath63 is approximatively exponentially proportional to the biggest ascending barrier of @xmath1 on the interval @xmath64 $ ] . in the case of a brownian potential , or more generally a spectrally negative lvy potential , the addition of a negative drift",
    "somehow `` kills '' the ascending barriers , thus accelerating the diffusion and leading to a polynomial rate of transience .",
    "however , in our setting , the biggest ascending barrier on @xmath64 $ ] of the stable process @xmath4 is of the same order as its biggest jump on this interval .",
    "since , the addition of a drift has no influence on the jumps of the potential process , the time needed to reach level @xmath63 still remains of the same order as in the recurrent case ( _ i.e. _ when the drift is zero ) and yields a logarithmic rate of transience .",
    "in the remainder of this paper , we indifferently use the notation @xmath65 or @xmath66 .",
    "let us first recall the classical representation of the diffusion @xmath0 in the random potential @xmath1 from a brownian motion through a random change of scale and a random change of time ( see @xcite or @xcite for details ) .",
    "let @xmath67 denote a standard brownian motion independent of @xmath1 and let @xmath68 stand for its hitting times : @xmath69 define the scale function of the diffusion @xmath0 , @xmath70 since @xmath71 and @xmath72 almost surely , it is clear that @xmath73 let @xmath74 denote the inverse of @xmath75 and define @xmath76 similarly , let @xmath77 denote the inverse of @xmath78 .",
    "according to brox @xcite ( see also @xcite ) , the diffusion @xmath0 in the random potential @xmath1 may be represented in the form @xmath79 it is now clear that , under our assumptions , the diffusion @xmath0 is transient toward @xmath20 .",
    "we will study @xmath0 via its hitting times @xmath80 defined by @xmath81 let @xmath82 stand for the bi - continuous version of the local time process of @xmath83 . in view of ( [ representationx ] ) , we can write @xmath84 making use of the change of variable @xmath85 , we get @xmath86 where @xmath87      given a cdlg process @xmath88 , we denote by @xmath89 the size of the jump at time @xmath90 .",
    "we also use the notation @xmath91 to denote the largest positive jump of @xmath92 before time @xmath90 , @xmath93 let @xmath94 stand for the largest ascending barrier before time @xmath90 , namely : @xmath95 we also define the functionals : @xmath96}z_s&\\quad\\hbox{(running unilateral maximum)}\\\\ \\underline{z}_t & { \\ensuremath{\\overset{\\hbox{\\tiny{def}}}{=}}}\\inf_{s\\in[0,t]}z_s&\\quad\\hbox{(running unilateral minimum)}\\\\ z^*_t&{\\ensuremath{\\overset{\\hbox{\\tiny{def}}}{=}}}\\sup_{s\\in[0,t]}|z_s|&\\quad\\hbox{(running bilateral supremum ) } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we start with a simple lemma concerning the fluctuations of the potential process .",
    "recall that @xmath102 . in view of the form of the density of the lvy measure of @xmath4 given in ( [ reflevymeasure ] ) , we get @xmath103 this yields ( [ flucleq ] ) . from the scaling property of the stable process",

    "a similar result is given in proposition 3.2 of @xcite when @xmath1 is a random walk in the domain of attraction of a stable law .",
    "as explained by shi @xcite , the key idea is the combined use of ray - knight s theorem and laplace s method .",
    "however , in our setting , additional difficulties appear since the potential process is neither flat on integer interval nor continuous",
    ". we shall therefore give a complete proof but one can still look in @xcite and @xcite for additional details .",
