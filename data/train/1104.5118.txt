    "rydberg atoms have long been studied because of their peculiar properties such as long lifetimes , large cross sections , and very large polarizabilities  @xcite .",
    "these exaggerated properties lead to strong interactions between the rydberg atoms , which have been experimentally detected in recent years  @xcite .",
    "such strong rydberg - rydberg interactions have fueled a growing interest in the field of quantum computing , and over the past decade , their application for quantum information processing , such as fast quantum gates  @xcite , or quantum random walks  @xcite have been proposed .",
    "also of particular interest is the excitation blockade effect  @xcite , where one rydberg atom actually prevents the excitation of other nearby atoms in an ultracold sample  @xcite .",
    "this phenomenon was recently observed in microtraps  @xcite and a c - not gate was implemented using the behavior  @xcite .",
    "another active area of research with rydberg atoms is the predicted existence of long - range `` exotic molecules '' . in one scenario ,",
    "one atom remains in its ground state , while another atom is excited to a rydberg state .",
    "the most famous examples of this type of interaction are the _ trilobite _ and  _ butterfly _ states , so - called because of the resemblence of their respective wave functions to these creatures .",
    "the theoretical framework for such interactions was first proposed in  @xcite , but were not observed until more recently in  @xcite .",
    "the second type of long - range interaction is predicted to occur when both atoms are excited to rydberg atoms . in  @xcite",
    ", it was first predicted that weakly bound _",
    "macrodimers _ could be formed from the induced van der waals interactions of two such excited atoms .",
    "however , more recent work  @xcite has shown that larger , more stable macrodimers can be formed from the strong mixing between @xmath7-characters of various rydberg states .",
    "recent measurements have shown signatures of such macrodimers in spectra of cesium rydberg samples @xcite .    in this article , we present long - range potential energy curves corresponding to the interaction between pairs of rubidium atoms excited to @xmath1 and @xmath2 rydberg states . in general , rydberg - rydberg interactions will only mix states that share the same molecular symmetry  @xcite .",
    "thus , only common symmetries between the excited rydberg molecular state and the state to which it is most strongly coupled are relevant . for rubidium , the doubly excited @xmath1 atom pair is most strongly coupled to the @xmath8 asymptote , while the doubly excited @xmath2 atom pair is most strongly coupled to the @xmath9 asymptote .",
    "since all @xmath10 states have @xmath11 , the only common symmetries with any @xmath12 state are @xmath13 , 1 . in this manner",
    ", we find that the relevant symmetries for the doubly excited @xmath1 and @xmath2 asymptotes are @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "we analyze all three cases for both pairs and show that potential wells exist for all of them .",
    "we also describe in detail properties of the bound levels within each well .",
    "the paper is arranged as follows : in  [ sec : molcurves ] , we review how to build the basis states used to compute the potential energy curves at long - range , and describe the existence of potential wells for certain asymptotes . in  [ sec : ef ] , we investigate the effects of small external electric fields on the potential curves , and in  [ sec : scaling ] , we discuss the scaling of the wells with principal quantum number @xmath0 . finally , in ",
    "[ sec : lifetimes ] , we calculate bound levels supported in those wells , and estimate their lifetimes .",
    "we also outline how photoassociation could be used to form and probe macrodimers .",
    "this is followed by concluding remarks in  [ sec : conc ] .",
    "in this section , we review the general theory for calculating the interaction potential curves .",
    "these curves are calculated by diagonalizing the interaction hamiltonian in the hund s case ( c ) basis set , which is appropriate when the spin - orbit coupling becomes significant and fine structure can not be ignored , as is the case here .",
    "we first consider two free rydberg atoms in states @xmath17 and @xmath18 , where @xmath0 is the principal quantum number , @xmath7 the orbital angular momentum , and @xmath19 is the projection of the total angular momentum @xmath20 onto a quantization axis ( chosen in the @xmath21-direction for convenience ) .",
    "the long - range hund s case ( c ) basis states are constructed as follows : @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the projection of the total angular momentum on the molecular axis and is conserved .",
    "the quantum number @xmath24 describes the symmetry property under inversion and is 1(@xmath251 ) for @xmath26 states .    for @xmath27",
    ", we need to additionally account for the reflection through a plane containing the internuclear axis .",
    "such a reflection will either leave the wave function unaffected or it will change the sign of the wave function .",
    "we distinguish between these symmetric and antisymmetric states under the reflection operator @xmath28 as follows : @xmath29 where @xmath28 behaves according to the following rules  @xcite : @xmath30    references  @xcite and  @xcite give the technical details for determining which states comprise the basis of the @xmath31 rubidium asymptote .",
    "although the procedure to find the basis states for different molecular asymptotes , such as @xmath32 , @xmath31 , or @xmath33 , is the same , the states making up these basis sets , in general , will be different .",
    "we do not review the procedure for building the basis sets here , but we note that all relevant ( _ i.e. _ strongly coupled ) molecular asymptotes within the vicinity of the asymptotic doubly - excited rydberg state being considered are included in each respective basis set .",
    "we again note here that because doubly excited @xmath1 ( @xmath2 ) rubidium atoms are most strongly coupled to @xmath12 ( @xmath10 ) states and because only common symmetries of such rydberg states are allowed to mix , the relevant symmetries for the @xmath32 and @xmath31 asymptotic rydberg states that we consider are @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 . as an example",
    ", table  [ tab : basis - rb ] lists the basis set for the @xmath14 symmetry near the rb @xmath34 molecular asymptote .",
    "[ tab : basis - rb ]      the interaction matrix we consider consists of both the long - range rydberg - rydberg interaction and the atomic fine structure . here",
    ", `` long - range '' refers to the case where no electron exchange takes place _ i.e. _ the electronic clouds about both nuclei do not overlap .",
    "this occurs when the distance @xmath35 between the two nuclei is greater than the leroy radius  @xcite : @xmath36\\;. \\label{eq : leroy}\\ ] ] when the distance between the two atoms is larger than @xmath37 , the interaction between them is described by the residual coulomb potential between two non - overlapping charge distributions  @xcite , which can be truncated to give only the dipole - dipole ( @xmath38 ) and quadrupole - quadrupole ( @xmath39 ) terms . for two atoms lying along the @xmath21-axis ,",
    "the @xmath38 and @xmath39 terms can be simplified to give  @xcite : @xmath40 here , @xmath41 for dipolar ( quadrupolar ) interactions , @xmath42 is the binomial coefficient , @xmath43 is the position of electron @xmath44 from its center , and @xmath45 .",
    "because the molecular basis states are linear combinations of the atomic states determined through symmetry considerations , each matrix element will actually be a sum of multiple interactions , _",

    "we see that all three symmetries feature large potential wells and for the remainder of this paper , we focus our attention on formation properties of bound states within these wells and analyze the stability of these macrodimers .",
    "we note here that we also explored the potential curves near the @xmath33 asymptotes , but no wells were found ; hence we do not display those curves here .",
    "production and/or detection of macrodimers will rely on external electric fields .",
    "in addition , since experiments can not completely shield the atoms from undesired stray fields , it is important to study their effect on our calculated curves .    strictly speaking , applying an external electric field @xmath65 breaks the @xmath66 symmetry of homonuclear dimers , and consequently , the basis states defined by would no longer be valid . in principle , one then needs to diagonalize the interaction matrix in a basis set containing every possible stark state , as was done in  @xcite .",
    "however , since the effects of such an electric field should be adiabatic , we assume that the @xmath66 symmetry is still approximately valid for small electric fields .",

    "the results of the pa rate against the detuning @xmath169 from the atomic 70@xmath170 levels are shown in fig .",

    "we compare these pa rates to those obtained if the ground state radial wave function @xmath171 is assumed to be a gaussian centered on @xmath6 with a standard deviation of 14 500 @xmath122 ( roughly half the fwhm of the potential well ) in fig .",

    "the progressive decrease of the @xmath173 signal beginning at @xmath251.36 ghz , followed by sharp increases between @xmath251.22 and @xmath251.16 ghz correspond to the slow decreases of the @xmath12 components between @xmath184 40 000 @xmath25 50 000 @xmath122 and their sharp increases around @xmath184 33 000 @xmath25 35 000 @xmath122 .",

    "as noted in  @xcite , this range of frequency with a noticeable drop in the pa rate could serve as a switch to excite or not excite a macrodimer , depending on the `` ground '' state being used .",
    "we also note that in both cases , the signals for the @xmath150 `` ground '' state are higher overall across the @xmath35 regime of the well , with a few exceptions .",

    "normalizing both ground state distributions over this range yielded slightly larger signal rates in the deepest part of the well for the gaussian , corresponding to its peak .",

    "[ fig : paboth](a ) and ( b ) is noticeable in both the @xmath150 and the @xmath151 rate signals between @xmath187 and @xmath250.85 ghz .",
    "whereas the uniform distribution shows a steady @xmath151 signal and a steady _ increase _ of the @xmath150 signal , the gaussian distribution shows both signals rapidly decreasing . as we chose to center the gaussian at the minimum of the well",
    ", the decrease in both signals obviously corresponds to the decreasing probability of the gaussian distribution in this @xmath35 regime ( _ i.e. _ the tails ) .",
    "if one wanted to take advantage of the large , isolated @xmath188 character at higher @xmath35 , this could easily be accomplished by recentering the gaussian appropriately .",
    "we have presented long - range interaction potential curves for the @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and @xmath16 symmetries of doubly excited @xmath1 and @xmath2 rydberg atoms and have demonstrated the existence of potential wells between these excited atoms .",
    "these wells are very deep and very extended , due to the strong @xmath7-mixing between the various electronic rydberg states .",
    "these wells are robust against small electric fields and support several bound vibrational levels , separated by a few mhz , which could be detected in spectroscopy experiments .",
    "the macrodimers corresponding to these bound vibrational levels are stable with respect to predissociation and have lifetimes limited only by the rydberg atoms themselves .",
    "these macrodimers could be realized through population of the vibrational energy levels by photoassociation , resulting in a detectable signal that could be used to probe the various @xmath7-character of the potential well .    in conclusion ,",
    "we note that the detection of such extended dimers could facilitate studies in a variety of areas . for example",
    ", the effect of retardation on the interaction at very large separation , which becomes important if the photon time - of - flight between the atoms is comparable to the classical orbital period of a rydberg electron around its core  @xcite , could potentially be probed experimentally .",
    "another example relates to chemistry of molecules with high internal energy ; a third atom approaching a macrodimer could quench its internal state to lower levels , or could potentially react with the molecule at very large distances and create a new product such as _ trilobite _ or _ butterfly _ rydberg molecules  @xcite . finally ,",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , rydberg atoms are being investigated intensively for quantum information processing , _",
    "e.g. _ using the blockade mechanism  @xcite , and the possibility of frequency ranges where the pa rate is strong or weak due to the @xmath7-character mixing could potentially be used as a quantum mechanical switch .",
