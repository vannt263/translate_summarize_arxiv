    "recent theoretical developments have been responsible for a resurgent interest in quarkonia physics : a factorized form for quarkonia production rates @xcite , based on the effective field theory , non relativistic qcd ( nrqcd ) @xcite , has been proposed . in this formalism , the inclusive production rates can be expressed as a function of the rates for creating pairs of free heavy quarks , @xmath2 , in various configurations , and by a series of non - perturbative matrix elements .",
    "the former may be computed using perturbative qcd , while the matrix elements , which describe the transition of the @xmath2 into a hadron , are defined in nrqcd .",
    "contrary to previous approaches , nrqcd factorization allows a systematic determination of relativistic corrections , which describe the effects of a heavy quark moving at a small velocity @xmath3 in the rest frame of the quarkonium .",
    "the velocity scaling rules of nrqcd @xcite , which reveal the power law behavior with respect to @xmath3 of the operators of the effective field theory , may be used to organize the matrix elements into a hierarchy .",
    "although each quarkonium resonance is identified by the @xmath2 having a particular set of quantum numbers ( such a @xmath2 state is the dominant fock state of the quarkonium ) , the relativistic corrections to the production rates for that quarkonium , which accommodates the relative motion of the @xmath4 and @xmath5 , may introduce a @xmath6 state with other quantum numbers .",
    "for example , the pair may be in a color octet configuration .",
    "the corresponding channels in the production rate , despite being at higher orders in @xmath3 , can be phenomenologically significant in certain kinematic domains , due to the particulars of the production process .",
    "one of the experiments used to test nrqcd factorization is photoproduction of quarkonia , in which a real photon collides with a nucleon .",
    "charmonium photoproduction has been investigated in the framework of the color singlet model @xcite , and more recently using nrqcd factorization @xcite , whose predictions have been subject to a comparison with preliminary data from hera @xcite .",
    "in addition to the channel in which the @xmath2 is in the dominant fock state of the @xmath1 , corrections , corresponding to the @xmath7 in spin singlet and spin triplet , s and p wave , color octet states , have been considered in the studies .",
    "the numerical values of the color octet matrix elements , were estimated in an earlier work @xcite , by fitting theoretical predictions for prompt charmonium production in @xmath8 processes , to data from the fermilab - tevatron . using these values ,",
    "however , leads to a significant discrepancy with the photoproduction rates at hera : the contributions from octet channels overwhelm the data in certain regions of phase space .",
    "a number of uncertainties which enter into calculations may be responsible for the inconsistency between the hera and tevatron data for charmonium production , when viewed from the perspective of nrqcd . among these are uncertainties in parton distribution functions , the value of the charm quark mass , higher twist effects @xcite , and higher order perturbative qcd corrections . in the work by kniehl @xcite , important higher order perturbative qcd effects , due to",
    "initial state multiple gluon radiation , were included when analyzing hadroproduction at the tevatron .",
    "the re - estimated matrix elements have values significantly smaller than the originally determined ones .",
    "correspondingly , the hera data is in much better agreement with the nrqcd predictions .",
    "this is true throughout most of phase space , except near certain boundaries where the octet contributions diverge .",
    "the authors in @xcite , have suggested this is due to the non - relativistic expansion breaking down in such regions .",
    "they have proposed a resumation of the non - relativistic expansion , which requires the introduction of universal structure functions .",
    "the contributions to @xmath1 photoproduction from the color octet channels are at order @xmath9 in the small velocity expansion , relative to the leading order , color singlet term .",
    "there is a relativistic correction at order @xmath10 , incorporating the effects of the relative motion of the heavy quark pair in the dominant fock state of @xmath1 .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to examine this correction in the framework of nrqcd factorization , which requires the introduction of an additional matrix element .",
    "previously , models have been constructed to describe such an order @xmath10 effect .",
    "the one parameter model presented in @xcite has been used to examine quarkonia photoproduction by jung et al .",
    "@xcite ; a two parameter model has also been proposed @xcite . the @xmath0 contribution has not been computed within nrqcd .",
    "it has been pointed out by bodwin et al .",
    "@xcite , that corrections of @xmath0 may be as important as radiative corrections of @xmath11 , which have already been calculated for photoproduction @xcite , and found to be significant . without a detailed understanding of the @xmath0 term , it is not possible to make an assessment of the significance of the color octet terms : the @xmath0 contribution is clearly necessary for consistency , according to the power counting rules of nrqcd .    the remainder of the paper is organized as follows . in the next section , some details of the calculation of the relativistic correction is described . in section [ num ] , numerical results , indicating the impact of the @xmath10 correction ,",
    "are presented , together with a comparison with data from hera .",
    "section [ end ] contains some concluding remarks .",
    "nrqcd factorization allows the inclusive cross section for the photoproduction of @xmath1 to be written in the following form : @xmath12 the coefficients , @xmath13 depend on the kinematic invariants of the process in which a photon @xmath14 and a parton @xmath15 from the initial hadron , react to produce a @xmath2 . here",

    "the formation of the bound state can involve the emission of soft partons , which return the pair into the appropriate spectroscopic configuration .",
    "the relative importance of various terms in the sum in eq .",

    "the dominant short distance contribution to inelastic photoproduction of @xmath1 is the photon - gluon fusion process @xmath32 the four momenta are specified in parenthesis .",
    "the process ( [ pro ] ) at leading order in qcd perturbation theory is represented in figs .",
    "1(a ) and 1(b ) .",
    "both diagrams allow the heavy quark pair to be produced in a color octet state , while the @xmath26 can only to be in a color singlet state in fig .",
    "subprocesses involving light quarks in the initial state are considerably suppressed at the energies available at hera @xcite . resolved processes ,",
    "in which the photon breaks up into partons , which subsequently interacts with the nucleon , have been analyzed within nrqcd factorization@xcite .",
    "these are important in the kinematic regime @xmath33 , where @xmath34 , in which the energies are defined in the nucleons rest frame .",
    "the formation of @xmath1 from a @xmath26 at leading order in the small velocity expansion is described by the matrix element @xmath35 the field @xmath36 annihilates a heavy quark , while @xmath37 creates a heavy anti - quark .",

    "the relativistic correction , appearing at @xmath0 relative to the leading contribution , in which the heavy quark pair is also in the dominant fock state of the @xmath1 , involves the matrix element @xmath40 \\right| 0 \\right\\rangle , \\label{eq : correction}\\ ] ] where @xmath41 .",
    "therefore , the differential cross section to @xmath0 takes the form , @xmath42 of the octet contributions which appear at @xmath43 , the @xmath44 and @xmath45 channels were found to be the most important .",
    "the structure of the matrix elements which describe these transitions , are similar to eqs.([lome ] ) and ( [ eq : correction ] ) , except for the operators between the quark and anti - quark fields ; they may be found in the literature@xcite .",
    "the aim in this section is to determine the coefficient @xmath46 , containing the short distance information associated with the @xmath10 correction .",

    "both sides are expanded in powers of @xmath48 , the momentum of the heavy quark in the rest frame of the quarkonium .",
    "the @xmath30 are then found by comparing powers of @xmath48 .",

    "the reason that the color octet contributions appear at a higher order in @xmath3 , in ( [ dxs ] ) , despite being at a lower order in the perturbative amplitude , is because the power counting is different for hadronic states : additional @xmath3 suppression appears in the hadronic projection operators of the color octet matrix elements .",

    ", this parameter can be negative and can be defined as a matrix element in nrqcd which is different to the one appearing in eq .",
    "secondly , the correction calculated in @xcite , is based on the model proposed in @xcite , in which the contribution of the momentum @xmath126 to the energy of the heavy quark is neglected - that is the energy is taken to be @xmath127 , in the quarkonium rest frame ; it really should be @xmath128 .",

    "the k factor , consistent with these cuts , from the nlo corrections to the color singlet channel @xcite is @xmath147 .",
    "figure 2 shows the total cross section as a function of the photon - nucleon center of mass energy , @xmath148 .",
    "the leading order color singlet contribution ( long dashed line ) , accounts quite well for most of the data from hi @xcite ( circles ) and zeus @xcite ( squares ) .",
    "the @xmath10 correction ( short dashed line ) , together with the color octet terms ( dot - dash line ) , contributes only marginally .",
    "the octet contributions are greater than the @xmath0 correction by approximately a factor of four , for large center of mass energies , with the values of the matrix elements that have been adopted .",
    "if the octet matrix elements were chosen to be consistent with ( [ splusporig ] ) , then the @xmath10 correction would be smaller by approximately a factor of ten , relative to the octet contributions .",
    "however , @xmath139 may be somewhat larger than @xmath149 , therefore both corrections may have similar magnitudes .",
    "next , the @xmath150 distribution is considered , as a function of @xmath151 .",
    "figure 3(a ) shows the ratio of the @xmath10 to the octet contributions , at @xmath152 gev ( solid line ) and @xmath153 gev ( dashed line ) . at @xmath152",
    "gev the cut , @xmath146 gev , consistent with results from hera is adopted , while at @xmath153 , @xmath154 gev , valid for the european muon collaboration ( emc ) . for @xmath152",

    "for @xmath155 the ratio is negative , indicating that the @xmath10 distribution is negative in that region . at @xmath156",
    "the ratio has a minimum value of about @xmath157 , meaning that in this region , the @xmath10 contribution is significant with respect to the color octet channels .",
    "again , if the original determinations of the octet matrix elements were adopted , the @xmath10 contributions will give a negligible result at intermediate and large values of @xmath151 , while at low @xmath151 , they would be comparable to the color octet contributions . at the emc energy regime ,",
    "@xmath153 gev , @xmath10 corrections are relatively more substantial at low @xmath151 , while at larger values , not as important .",

    "the @xmath10 correction tends to decrease the distribution for larger values of @xmath151 , while at smaller values , it is enhanced .",
    "figure 3(c ) shows the distribution at @xmath153 gev , displaying a similar behavior , although the @xmath10 effect is not as pronounced .",
    "the data is from the emc @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that the large @xmath151 region where the @xmath10 contribution is most substantial , is also where the non relativistic expansion breaks down @xcite .",
    "our analysis , leads to a qualitatively different behavior for the energy distribution , than in the work by jung et al .",
    "@xcite . in their case",
    "there is an enhancement of @xmath150 for large values of @xmath151 .",
    "the transverse momentum distribution for photoproduction was also examined .",
    "however , it was found that the @xmath10 correction leads to a negligible contribution to the overall differential rate .",
    "it is expected that a similar @xmath10 correction appears in @xmath158 processes at the tevatron , where color octet fragmentation channels dominate at large transverse momentum .",
    "the @xmath10 correction can be obtained by realizing that it originates via a process similar to that depicted in figure 1(a ) , except with the initial photon replaced by a gluon .",
    "the color singlet rates , including the @xmath10 correction is obtained by multiplying @xmath159 and @xmath160 by the factor @xmath161 , which takes into account the differences in the initial state .",
    "however it was found that the @xmath10 correction contributes insignificantly to the transverse momentum distribution for moderate transverse momenta , at the tevatron center of mass energy @xmath162 tev .",
    "in this work , the relativistic correction to the color singlet channel in @xmath1 photoproduction was calculated using the nrqcd factorization formalism .",
    "the correction is described by an additional matrix element which appears at @xmath0 relative to the leading order color singlet term , according to the velocity scaling rules of nrqcd .",
    "this work contrasts with previous studies in that it draws qualitatively different conclusions about the behavior of observable .",
    "specifically , the contribution leads to a decrease in the energy distribution for large values of @xmath151 , while for smaller values there is an enhancement of the differential cross section .",
    "the effect of the correction in photoproduction seems to be more significant for larger center of mass energies . in some regions of phase space ,",
    "the @xmath10 correction is comparable to the color octet contributions , with the values of the parameters that were used .",
    "however , it has been noted earlier that the rates are sensitive to @xmath163 , @xmath16 , and the choice of parton distribution functions , which are not precisely known .",
    "certainly it seems that the uncertainty in these parameters , correspond to variations in the rates which are of similar magnitude , or greater than the effect of the @xmath0 correction @xcite .",
