    "recently , high energy gamma ray observations reveal some excess emissions near the galactic centre .",
    "these excess emissions can not be easily explained by standard physical processes",
    ". one potential origin of such emissions is due to an unusual population of millisecond pulsars @xcite .",
    "however , @xcite point out that the large diffuse signal of gamma ray disfavours the possibility of pulsar emissions . even including both known sources and unidentified sources , the millisecond pulsars can only account no more than 10 percent of the gev excess @xcite .",
    "in fact , the majority of discussions of the gev excess is now focused on the annihilation of dark matter particles @xcite .",
    "it is also because the gamma ray spectrum obtained from fermi - lat data can be well fitted with @xmath1 annihilation channel of dark matter particles @xcite .",
    "the required cross section and rest mass of dark matter particle are @xmath2 @xmath3 s@xmath4 and @xmath5 gev respectively @xcite .",
    "this cross section is consistent with the expected canonical thermal relic abundance cross section ( @xmath6 @xmath3 s@xmath4 ) in cosmology .",
    "furthermore , the inner slope of the radial - depedence of the gamma ray emissions is @xmath7 ( the best fit is @xmath8 ) @xcite , which is consistent with the numerical simulation of dark matter halo structure @xmath9 @xcite .    in this letter ,",
    "i show that the @xmath1 annihilation channel can also explain the energy required in x - ray emissions in the galactic centre .",
    "this evidence can further support the dark matter annihilation model and constrain the cross section and rest mass of the dark matter particles .",
    "in the past decade , a large amount of diffuse x - ray data had been obtained by _",
    "chandra , bepposax , suzaku _ and _ xmm - newton _ @xcite . in particular , @xcite use the data from _ chandra _ to model the temperature of the two components within 20 pc as 0.8 kev ( soft component ) and 8 kev ( hard component ) .",
    "the energy required to sustain the 0.8 kev and 8 kev components are @xmath10 erg / s and @xmath11 erg / s respectively @xcite .",
    "later , @xcite point out that the cooling by adiabatic expansion may not be important if the hard component could actually be a gravitationally confined helium plasma .",
    "therefore , the actual energy required for the hard component to balance the radiative cooling would be @xmath12 erg / s within 20 pc @xcite , but not @xmath11 erg / s . although supernova explosions are able to provide such a high energy , it is not possible for supernovae to heat the hard component plasma to such a high temperature @xcite .",
    "also , the correlation between the hard and soft emission suggests that they are produced by related physical processes @xcite .",
    "therefore , the required energy to balance the radiative coolings of both soft and hard component might be given by some other origins .",
    "however , there is no widely accepted mechanism to heat and sustain the plasma to such a high temperautre @xcite .",
    "one potential explanation is that the heating might result from the viscous friction on molecular clouds flowing toward the galactic centre @xcite .    here",
    ", i propose that the energy given out by annihilation of dark matter particles can explain the energy requirement of both soft and hard components ( @xmath13 erg / s ) within 20 pc .",
    "although a large amount of energy from annihilation is given out in the form of gamma ray which is nearly transparent to the plasma , a large amount of high energy electrons and positrons can also be produced through the @xmath1 annihilation channel .",
    "the spectrum of positron ( or electron ) energy @xmath14 per one annihilation is shown in fig",
    ".  1 @xcite .",
    "these high energy electrons and positrons would lose their energy and give their energy to the plasma mainly by three different processes : ionization loss @xmath15 , synchrotron loss @xmath16 and inverse compton scattering @xmath17 .",
    "the corresponding energy loss rates are @xcite : @xmath18 @xmath19 and @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the radiation energy density , @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the number density of electrons and magnetic field strength in the plasma respectively .",
    "the total number and total energy of positrons or electrons produced per one annihilation are @xmath24 and @xmath25 gev respectively for @xmath26 gev .",
    "therefore , the average energy for one positron or electron produced is @xmath27 gev , which gives @xmath28 . since @xmath29 @xmath30 @xcite , @xmath31 ev/@xmath3 @xcite and @xmath32 g in the plasma near the galactic centre @xcite , the total energy loss rate is @xmath33 ev / s . the cooling rate would first be dominated by inverse compton scattering and synchrotron loss . when the positron or electron is cooled down to about 1 mev , the cooling rate",
    "would be dominated by ionization loss . as a result ,",
    "the required cooling time is @xmath34 s ( see fig .  2 ) .",
    "for the diffusion process of the positrons or electrons , let s first consider the simple random walk model .",
    "the stopping distance of a high energy positron or electron is @xmath35 @xcite , where @xmath36 is the larmor radius . for @xmath37",
    "g , we have @xmath38 pc , which is very small compared with the size of our interested region ( 20 pc ) .",
    "therefore , the required cooling time is short enough such that the diffusion process is not important .",
    "nevertheless , @xcite suggest that the amplitude of the random magnetic field and the turbulence effect are also important to the diffusion process .",
    "this kind of diffusion can be described by a diffusion coefficient @xmath39 and an index @xmath40 . for a large scale ( greater than 100 pc ) , the ranges of the values are @xmath41 @xmath42 s@xmath4 and @xmath43 @xcite . for the innermost region near the galactic centre ,",
    "the picture is much more uncertain . @xcite",
    "reveal from the analysis of @xmath44-ray observations that a significant reduction of the diffusion coefficient in the inner 10 pc region is found .",
    "they apply two models , namely kraichnan and kolmogorov , to obtain the characteristic diffusion length @xmath45 .",
    "they get @xmath46 pc and @xmath47 pc by using the kraichnan model and kolmogorov model respectively .",
    "therefore , not all of the energy of positrons or electrons is lost due to the cooling process during the diffusion within @xmath45 . the diffusion length for an electron with initial energy @xmath48",
    "is given by @xcite @xmath49^{1/2},\\ ] ] where @xmath50 is the energy of the electron after the diffusion of length @xmath45 .",
    "let s consider the lower bounds of the parameters from large scale diffusion @xmath51 @xmath42 s@xmath4 and @xmath52 .",
    "for @xmath53 gev and @xmath54 pc , we get @xmath55 gev , which means over 65% of the energy would be lost during the diffusion process .    in the following discussion",
    ", we first neglect the effect of diffusion .",
    "the result would not be affected if the simple random walk model is the correct diffusion model . however",
    ", if either of the other two turbulence models is the correct diffusion model , the calculated cross section would be at most increased by a factor of 1.5 .",
    "the total annihilation rate within @xmath56 pc is given by @xmath57 here , @xmath58 is the dark matter density profile , which is assumed to be the generalized nfw profile @xcite : @xmath59^{-3+\\gamma},\\ ] ] where @xmath60 gev/@xmath3 , @xmath61 kpc and @xmath62 kpc . in our calculations , we assume @xmath8 , which is the best fit of the observed gamma ray spectrum by fermi - lat @xcite . the total energy loss due to electron - positron pairs is @xmath63 . since the energy required to sustain the soft and hard components is @xmath13 erg / s , we can constrain the parameter space of @xmath64 and @xmath65 by using eq .",
    "( 5 ) ( see fig .  3 ) . in the plot",
    ", we see that the allowed parameter space falls within the range predicted by the annihilation model from fermi - lat data @xmath66 @xmath3 s@xmath4 for @xmath26 gev .",
    "g and @xmath67 ev/@xmath3 .",
    "we have assumed @xmath68 @xmath30 and @xmath69 gev initially.,width=302 ]    for consistency checking , the above result also agrees with the total luminosity of gamma ray with energy greater than 500 mev within @xmath70 pc in the galactic centre detected by the egret telescope @xcite .",
    "the total energy released per one annihilation is given by : @xmath71 since the energy carried by neutrinos is negligible @xcite , by using the predicted range of @xmath72 @xmath3 s@xmath4 from x - ray emission and @xmath26 gev , the total luminosity of gamma ray is @xmath73 erg / s , which agrees with the detected luminosity @xmath74 erg / s @xcite .",
    "in this letter , we show that the annihilation of dark matter particles can satisfactorily explain the energy source of soft and hard components of hot plasma . the cross section and rest mass of dark matter particles calculated are consistent with the gamma ray observations and give excellent agreement with the prediction from the @xmath1 annihilation model based on the data from fermi - lat .",
    "the predicted cross section in our calculations ( @xmath75 @xmath3 s@xmath4 ) satisfies all the constraints from cosmic microwave background and low - redshift data @xcite , and also agrees with the canonical thermal relic abundance cross section in cosmology @xmath6 @xmath3 s@xmath4 @xcite .    in this model ,",
    "the total number of positrons produced per one annihilation is @xmath76 . for @xmath77 pc",
    ", we have @xmath78 s@xmath4 .",
    "since a positron takes @xmath79 s to loss all its energy , we predict that the total number of high energy positrons within 20 pc is about @xmath80 ( the low energy positrons would annihilate with electrons to produce 511 kev emission line ) .",
    "therefore , the number density of high energy positrons within 20 pc is @xmath81 @xmath30 . since the electron number density is @xmath29 @xmath30 @xcite , the positron to electron ratio becomes @xmath82 , which general agrees with the recent analysis in interstellar medium @xcite .",
    "furthermore , this range of ratio can produce the observed 511 kev luminosity by the accretion of intergalactic material @xcite .",
    "to conclude , we can notice that all the above evidences give a self - consistent picture in the galactic centre and strongly support the annihilation dark matter model .",
    "the rest mass and the cross section could probably be verified by the large hadron collider experiment in the future .",
