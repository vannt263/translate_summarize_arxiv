    "perfect fluids , in contrast to real fluids , are in equilibrium because their dynamics is reversible and hence produce no entropy and no frictional type heating .",
    "a realistic study of the early universe requires the invocation of real relativistic fluids .",
    "great progress in relativistic thermodynamics was made by eckart @xcite in the @xmath6 s by extending irreversible thermodynamics from newtonian to relativistic fluids .",
    "since eckart only considered first - order deviation from equilibrium , his theory is known as the first - order theory of relativistic fluids .",
    "although eckart was concerned with special relativity his results are extendable to general relativity . in an eckart fluid ,",
    "non - equilibrium states are described by the local equilibrium variables and hence dissipative perturbations propagate with infinite velocity and temperature which is the non - causal feature of the theory and unacceptable @xcite . also , it is worth mentioning that the problem of infinite velocity of propagation existed in non - relativistic thermodynamics until 1967 when muller proposed quadratic terms for thermal flux and viscous stress and succeeded to resolve this problem @xcite .",
    "later on , israel along with stewart applied muller s extension to eckart theory and obtained modified dissipative relations that are acceptable from the point of view of relativistic thermodynamics @xcite .",
    "their results are known as the second - order theory of relativistic fluids .",
    "it is useful to mention that after israel and stewart , other authors @xcite confirmed that eckart s fluid suffers from serious drawbacks concerning causality and stability .",
    "they also developed a relativistic second - order theory which is known as the transient irreversible thermodynamics .",
    "the simplest model of a dissipative fluid is that which assumes the existence of bulk viscosity only .",
    "qualitatively , we can regarded bulk viscosity as the macroscopic expression of microscopic frictional effects that appear in mixtures .    turning our attention to the universe ,",
    "in the simplest of cosmological models , there is no way to study entropy producing processes except through bulk viscosity .",
    "bulk viscosity arises any time a fluid expands rapidly and ceases to be in thermodynamic equilibrium .",
    "the bulk viscosity , therefore , is a value of the pressure required to restore equilibrium to a compressed form of expanding system .",
    "generally , unlike eckart fluid , israel and stewart fluid is causal and stable but are based on the assumption of small deviation from equilibrium , so that the transport equation is linear in the bulk viscous pressure .",
    "linear assumption confirmed by most cosmological situations may exit in some processes which involve more deviations from equilibrium .",
    "for example , in @xcite , the authors develop a nonlinear generalization of the causal linear thermodynamics of bulk viscosity for viscous fluid inflation .",
    "the big bang theory of cosmology dictates that the universe is expanding and this means that if we consider the evolution of the universe backwards in time , we will see the universe becoming denser and hotter . during this process",
    "the universe has undergone a series of transformations which could have occurred as phase transitions or crossovers as follows : + @xmath7 the gut phase transition at @xmath8 gev , where the symmetry between the strong and electro - weak interactions is spontaneously broken .",
    "+ @xmath9 the electro - weak phase transition at @xmath10 gev , was a transition from a symmetric high temperature phase with massless gauge bosons to the higgs phase where the @xmath11 gauge symmetry is spontaneously broken and all the masses in the model are generated .",
    "+ @xmath12 the chiral symmetry breaking and the confining qcd phase transition at @xmath13 gev . therefore ,",
    "at roughly @xmath14 after the big bang , matter was in the state of a quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) .",
    "as the plasma cooled , quarks and gluons formed hadronic matter with the same density as that of nuclear matter , that is @xmath15 . studies of this process show that the system was likely in equilibrium so that static methods of statistical physics can be applied .",
    "the possibility of a phase transition in the gas of quark - gluon bags was demonstrated for the first time in @xcite .",
    "however , the phase transition in qcd can be characterized by a truly singular behavior of the partition function leading to a first or second order phase transition and , it may also be considered as a crossover transition with rapid changes in some observables , strongly depending on the values of the quark masses .",
    "the investigation of any phase transition in the early universe necessitates an equation of state ( eos ) which plays an important role in the hot , strongly interacting matter and in the hydrodynamic description of heavy ion collisions @xcite .",
    "the eos is described by thermodynamic quantities such as pressure @xmath16 , energy density @xmath17 or entropy density @xmath18 as a function of temperature .",
    "general relativity is not a renormalizable theory which means that in the uv limit it breaks down and can not be quantized using conventional quantization techniques .",
    "however , it was shown in @xcite that theories whose action includes invariant quadratics in curvature are renormalizable .",
    "not surprisingly , this comes at a high price since such theories contain ghost degrees of freedom .",
    "the uv behavior of quantum gravity is one of the appealing topics in theoretical physics ( especially string theory ) which has been studied for a long time .",
    "a new class of uv complete theories of gravity was proposed in the recent past by hoava @xcite which is based on a scalar field theory proposed by lifshitz to explain the quantum critical phenomena in condensed matter physics @xcite .",
    "in the so - called hoava - lifshitz ( hl ) theory there is an asymmetry between time and space , that is @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the dynamical critical exponent . here",
    ", one may remark that @xmath20 can be considered as a gauge for describing the scale asymmetry between time and space .",
    "indeed , by adding higher order spatial derivatives without adding higher order time derivatives , the behavior of the graviton propagator in the uv limit can be modified .",
    "therefore hl gravity for @xmath21 becomes non - relativistic .",
    "briefly , the crucial idea is related to the breakdown of the fundamental role of the local lorentz invariance in high energy .",
    "in other words , local lorentz invariance is an accidental symmetry which appears only at low energies .",
    "breaking the isotropic scaling of space and time improves the uv behavior of the theory without introducing ghosts .",
    "anisotropic scaling with a dynamical critical exponent @xmath22 in hl gravity leads to renormalizability of the theory based on power counting and reduces to einstein s general relativity in the ir region .",
    "it is worth remembering that breaking the isotropic scaling of space and time leads to the breakdown of diffeomorphism invariance and the creation of additional scalar degree of freedom , i.e. a spin-0 mode for graviton .",
    "this mode is potentially dangerous and may cause strong coupling problems that prevent the recovery of general relativity in the ir limit @xcite .",
    "this may be regarded as a weak aspect of hl gravity @xcite .",
    "it is well known that there are two natural classes of functions in hl theory that can be defined on a foliation and there exists a special class of functions , the so - call projectables , which take constant values on each leaf of the foliation .",
    "foliations can be equipped with a riemannian structure . in horava theory of gravity the riemannian structure",
    "consists of three objects ; the metric @xmath23 , the shift variable @xmath24 and the lapse field @xmath25 where @xmath26 is a projectable function , that is @xmath27 . in analogy to lifshitz scalar field theory",
    ", one may impose an additional symmetry to the theory known as the detailed balance .",
    "hence it requires that potential part of the action @xmath28 should be derivable from a superpotential @xmath29 , that is @xmath30 , where @xmath31 follows from a variational principle @xmath32}{\\delta g_{ij}}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for which @xmath33 is the inverse of the de witt metric . in view of the potential part of the action including numerous terms containing various powers and spatial derivatives of curvatures of the spatial metric",
    ", the principle of detailed balance has been taken into consideration to limit such terms .",
    "however , this principle itself creates some problems , namely , the existence of a parity violating term , the ( bare ) cosmological constant has the opposite sign and it has to be much larger than the observed value and the scalar mode does not satisfy a sixth order dispersion relation and is not power - counting renormalizable @xcite .",
    "there are also other problems which are less obvious ; the infrared behavior of the scalar mode is plagued by instabilities and strong coupling at unacceptably low energies @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "abandoning the detailed balance leads to a more complicated form of the theory but brings about some benefits including the suppression of the parity violating terms and the power - counting renormalizability . at the same time the cosmological constant is controlled and not restricted @xcite .",
    "recently , sotiriou , visser and weinfurtner ( svw ) , discarding the principle of detailed balance but preserving the projectability condition , showed that the most general such hl theory can be properly formulated with eight independent coupling constants @xcite . among these eight coupling constants , one",
    "is related to the kinetic energy responsible for the spin-0 scalar graviton and the other seven are all related to the breaking of lorentz invariance , which are highly suppressed by the planck scale in the ir limit @xcite .",
    "this study is organized as follows : in section ii we present a brief review on non - local equilibrium relativistic fluids with an emphasis on the eckart and israel - stewart fluids . in section",
    "iii after a short review of non - detailed balance version of the hl gravity , the friedmann equation of the frw universe in the presence of a bulk viscous cosmological background fluid is derived . in sections",
    "iv we present a short survey of first order phase transition based on phenomenological models such as the mit bag @xcite , both for qgp and hadron phase and obtain the eos in the absence of the chemical potential @xmath34 . in sections v , using the eos given by the mit bag model at high temperature and an expansion for low temperature in the hadron phase , we study the dynamical behavior of the non - detailed balance hl early universe filled with non - causal and causal fluids during the quark - hadron first order phase transition respectively .",
    "finally , conclusions are drawn in section vii .",
    "events at space times are close to a fictional equilibrium state at that event thermodynamically .",
    "based on non - casual eckart theory , the local equilibrium quantities are denoted by @xmath35 , representing number density , energy density , pressure , entropy and temperature respectively .",
    "the thermodynamic state of a simple relativistic is generally characterized by an energy - momentum tensor @xmath36 , a particle flow vector @xmath37 and an entropy flow vector @xmath38 . for a dissipative fluid , the particle four - vector will have the same form as that of a perfect fluid and satisfies @xmath39 where @xmath40 is defined by @xmath41 .",
    "in general @xmath42 where @xmath43 is a particle source if @xmath44 or sink if @xmath45 . thus @xmath46 means no particle source or sink .",
    "this corresponds to choosing an average four velocity for which there is no dissipative particle flow , known as the particle frame . in other words in a particle frame",
    "no particle is created or annihilated .",
    "another standard frame is the energy frame which satisfies @xmath47 , corresponding to an average four velocity in which there is no dissipative energy source .",
    "the satisfaction of the above two relations corresponds to the conservation of particle number and energy in the fluid system . for a dissipative fluid in the particle frame , the number density , energy density , temperature and four velocity are the same as that for a perfect fluid while the pressure has a deviation from the local equilibrium pressure , @xmath48 , i.e. a splitting into the equilibrium part @xmath49 plus the bulk viscous pressure contribution @xmath50 .",
    "there is no convincing evidence that only the pressure should admit corrections due to dissipative processes @xcite .",
    "bulk viscosity allows us to describe a mixture of different species effectively as a single fluid , provided a hydrodynamic description is reasonable @xcite . in an expanding fluid",
    ", the dissipation due to @xmath50 leads to a decrease in kinetic energy and therefore in pressure so that @xmath51 . with the assumption that the fluid is moving orthogonal to the homogeneous spatial hypersurfaces ,",
    "the four - velocity @xmath52 is equal to the unit normal to such hypersurfaces .",
    "the energy - momentum tensor can be decomposed in terms of @xmath52 according to @xmath53 where @xmath54 assume @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 and @xmath52 are the anisotropic stress , heat conduction vector and the local equilibrium four velocity which are measured by an observer moving with the fluid , respectively .",
    "the four velocity @xmath52 in the particle frame is defined by @xmath58 @xcite . here ,",
    "similar to the standard ( perfect ) fluid , the conservation law of energy - momentum , that is @xmath59 , is assumed to hold . in the co - moving frame",
    "the energy momentum tensor has the components @xmath60 .",
    "it is also generally assumed that there exists a linear relationship between the bulk viscous pressure @xmath50 and the expansion @xmath61 in the form @xmath62 , where @xmath63 is the bulk viscosity coefficient and @xmath64 is the expansion scalar , which for the frw metric is equal to @xmath65 . thus the bulk viscous pressure is @xmath66 also , the anisotropic stress term @xmath56 and heat conduction vector @xmath57 are defined as @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the shear tensor , @xmath69 is the shear viscosity and @xmath1 is the thermal conductivity . according to relativistic eckart fluid there exists an acceleration term @xmath57 arising from the inertia of heat energy .",
    "it is very interesting that unlike its newtonian formulation @xmath70 , even in the absence of a temperature gradient , the heat flux arising from accelerated matter is non - zero .",
    "therefore , the energy - momentum conservation equation is written as @xmath71 here , @xmath72 is the covariant spatial derivative and @xmath73 . also , @xmath74 is the projection tensor defined by @xmath75 . unlike the perfect fluid for which the entropy flow vector is defined as @xmath76 , in eckart fluid there is an added dissipative term @xmath77 the covariant form of the second law of thermodynamics is @xmath78 and the divergence of the entropy current is given by @xmath79    the non - negativity of the covariant divergence of entropy is required by the second law of thermodynamics and hence @xmath80 .",
    "it is known that the israel - stewart theory is related to linear terms added to the entropy flow vector from perfect fluid ( [ e6 ] ) .",
    "therefore we have the general algebraic form @xmath81 where @xmath82 , @xmath83 and @xmath84 are thermodynamic coefficients for scalar , vector and tensor dissipative contributions to the entropy density , respectively .",
    "also @xmath85 and @xmath86 are thermodynamic viscous and heat coupling coefficients .",
    "the evolution equation of the bulk viscous pressure then reads @xmath87 where @xmath88 is the relaxation time . in equation ( [ e9 ] )",
    ", @xmath89 gives the so - called truncated israel - stewart theory with the evolution equation given by @xmath90 while the full theory has @xmath91 .",
    "obviously for the steady state , @xmath92 , the causal truncated israel - stewart theory ( [ e10 ] ) reduces to non - causal eckart fluid , equation ( [ e3 ] ) . relations ( [ e9 ] ) and ( [ e10 ] ) are valid only on the assumption that the fluid is close to equilibrium i.e. @xmath93 .",
    "finally , it is worth mentioning that the conservation equations related to particle and energy frames are valid in israel - stewart fluid .",
    "in this section we shall present a short introduction to horava - lifshitz gravity without detailed balance but with the projectability condition .",
    "as was mentioned before , the hl theory is constructed on the basic assumption of anisotropic scaling between space and time @xmath94 in a theory with anisotropic scaling , time and space are fundamentally distinct .",
    "it is then natural to use the adm formalism for which the metric is given by @xmath95 where @xmath23 , @xmath26 and @xmath96 are the spatial metric , lapse and shift functions respectively .",
    "these variables are dynamical variables which under the above scaling behave as @xmath97    because the original hl theory is power - counting renormalizable , the dimensions of the components of the above metric are @xmath98 = 1 \\quad [ dt ] = -3 \\quad [ n]=[g_{ij}]=0 \\quad [ n^{i}]=-2 \\quad [ ds^{2}]=2,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the projectability condition demands a homogeneous lapse function , @xmath99 .",
    "it is useful to write the hl action in terms of geometric objects characteristics of the adm slicing of space - time , the @xmath100 covariant derivative @xmath101 , the spatial curvature tensor @xmath102 , and the extrinsic curvature @xmath103 @xcite .",
    "the action is then decomposed into a kinetic , a potential and a matter part @xmath104 the kinetic term is naturally given by @xmath105,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath103 @xmath106 is the extrinsic curvature of spatial slices , defined by @xmath107 with @xmath108 being the covariant derivative on the spatial slice whose metric @xmath23 is used to raise and lower indices . indeed",
    ", the extrinsic curvature tensor measures how the spatial slices in the adm decomposition of spacetime curve with respect to external observers @xcite .",
    "note that @xmath109=3 $ ] and @xmath110=0 $ ] . using ( [ em1 ] ) , it is not difficult to see that the dimension of potential is @xmath111 .",
    "we also have @xmath112=-6 $ ] where @xmath113 .",
    "hence the potential part in the most general action in the absence of detailed balance condition containing terms with dimensions @xmath114 is given by @xmath115,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where all the coupling constants @xmath116 are dimensionless and @xmath117=1 $ ] , for further details see @xcite .",
    "the ricci scalar and tensor are given by @xmath118 and @xmath119 .",
    "also the spatial curvature tensor , @xmath102 is defined as @xmath120 where @xmath121 are the christoffel symbols . in the ir limit",
    "the hl action will simplify to @xmath122.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] definitions @xmath123 will reduce this action to that of the einstein - hilbert s @xmath124,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath125 and @xmath126 .",
    "so , the cosmological constant @xmath127 is determined by the free parameter @xmath128 , and observationally @xmath129 @xcite .",
    "finally @xmath130 where @xmath131 is the lagrangian density of matter fields , denoted collectively by @xmath132 .",
    "now , in order to focus on a cosmological framework we use the @xmath133 metric @xmath134 with @xmath135 so that the homogeneous and isotropic metric is written as @xmath136,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath137 represents an open , flat or closed universe , respectively .",
    "we also suppose that the hl universe is filled with a viscous fluid .",
    "let us now define the shear tensor by @xmath138 where @xmath139 is the expansion tensor and @xmath61 is the expansion scalar whose value in the frw metric ( [ em5 ] ) is @xmath65 .",
    "explicitly , if we use this result to get the shear tensor we will obtain @xmath140 . thus from relation ( [ e4 ] ) we find that the anisotropic stress is zero , @xmath141 . in addition , to maintain conservation of energy , an average four velocity should be chosen in such a way as to avoid the formation of dissipative energy sources or sinks in the cosmological fluid system .",
    "such a vector could be defined as @xcite @xmath142 which , in conjunction with the definition of heat conduction vector ( [ e4 ] ) , leads to @xmath143 .",
    "therefore , the energy - momentum tensor of the viscous fluid ( [ e2 ] ) in the background of metric ( [ em3 ] ) will reduce to @xmath144 where @xmath145 , @xmath146 are the energy density and isotropic effective pressure , respectively . also @xmath147 where @xmath148 . in comoving",
    "coordinates @xmath149 and @xmath150 .",
    "we thus obtain the gravitational field equations of the hl theory , corresponding to the line element ( [ em3 ] ) and ( [ em4 ] ) as @xmath151 @xmath152 where @xmath153 as was noted above , @xmath154 regardless of @xmath83 and @xmath1 is a dimensionless running coupling constant in the friedmann equations . also the energy conservation law @xmath155 gives the continuity equation in the form @xmath156 the existence of the terms @xmath157 , @xmath158 and @xmath159 in the friedmann equations ( [ e15 ] ) and ( [ e16 ] ) correspond to spatial curvature contributions , radiation pressure or dark radiation and stiff matter respectively .",
    "it is worth remarking that the stiff - matter term does not appear in the detailed balance version of the hl theory .",
    "the potential for the detailed balance case is given by @xmath160 where @xmath161 is cotton tensor defined as @xmath162 in the above potential only the term @xmath163 has dimension @xmath164=6 $ ] . beside , the cotton tensor disappears for the constant curvature spatial slices of a frw spacetime .",
    "therefore , in the friedmann equation of detailed balance hl gravity we remove the term @xmath159 .",
    "since the early universe is known to be flat to a good approximation , in what follows we will focus attention on the non detailed balance condition with @xmath165 and cosmological constant @xmath166 .",
    "finally , it is worth mentioning that despite all the phenomenological difficulties many efforts have been made to determine the coupling constants of the hl theory . for example , in @xcite the authors have used cosmological observations to impose constraints on the running coupling constants of hl cosmology and have reported that to within @xmath167 , that the running coupling constant @xmath1 is bounded very close to its ir value , @xmath168 .",
    "a phase transition is a phenomenon in which a drastic change between thermodynamic phases occurs as the system parameters such as energy density @xmath145 or entropy density @xmath169 are varied . in the early universe ,",
    "the last phase transition predicted by the standard model of particle physics took place at the qcd scale @xmath170 mev @xcite .",
    "when the universe was about @xmath171 old , the hubble radius was around 10 km corresponding to scales of about @xmath172 pc or about @xmath173 light years today .",
    "the quark - hadron phase transition is a fundamental notion to study particle physics and is an essential part of any study dealing with the underlying mechanisms responsible for the evolving universe at its early stages of formation .",
    "the thermodynamics of the quark - gluon phase can be considered either in qcd or using an `` effective interaction '' approach for which @xcite and @xcite are two examples .",
    "interestingly , both approaches agree on the same transition temperature but may disagree on the order of the transition , i.e. whether it is of first order , second order and or smooth crossover . in order to study the phenomena of quark - hadron phase transition in the framework of non - detailed balance hl universe with a bulk viscosity cosmological background fluid",
    ", we have to specify the eos of the qgp and hadron phase in the presence of the bulk viscous .",
    "therefore , we should adopt an `` effective interaction '' approach .",
    "to this end , we assume that quarks have different flavors , @xmath174 and @xmath175 , in the qgp phase .",
    "to lowest order , figure [ fig.f0 ] , the amplitude of interaction @xmath176 is given by @xmath177[\\bar{u}(4)\\gamma_{\\mu}\\bar{u}(1 ) ] ( c^{\\dag}_{3}\\lambda^{\\alpha}c_{1})(c^{\\dag}_{4}\\lambda^{\\alpha}c_{2}),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath178 is the well known strong coupling constant , @xmath179 are column vectors representing the color of the corresponding quarks , @xmath180 @xmath181 are gell - mann matrices and @xmath182 are dirac spinor - field operators representing the two light - quark fields .     , width=8 ]",
    "we note that the above amplitude is similar to the electron - muon @xmath183 scattering @xmath184[\\bar{u}^{(s_{4})}(p_{4})\\gamma_{\\mu}u^{(s_{2})}(p_{2})].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the only the difference is that @xmath185 should be replaced with @xmath186 and the color factor @xmath187 is taken into account .",
    "one would therefore deduce that inter - quark potential reads @xmath188 where @xmath189 , with @xmath190 being the number of quark flavors .",
    "therefore , one adds the interaction potential between quarks to the total energy of any particle in the ideal gas model , i.e. , @xmath191 .",
    "an important property of qcd at high temperatures is the restoration of chiral symmetry . for two massless",
    "quarks the chiral symmetry group is @xmath192 , which is isomorphic to @xmath193 . at low temperatures",
    "the symmetry breaks spontaneously to @xmath194 which is isomorphic to @xmath195 . in a similar fashion as in condensed matter physics , the breakdown of @xmath196 symmetry points to a second order phase transition .",
    "one would therefore expect that with two massless quarks the qcd phase transition is of second order .",
    "however , for three massless quarks , one expects a first order phase transition , since systems with symmetry breaking @xmath197 do not have second order phase transitions .",
    "of course , quarks are not completely massless ; the s - quark has an intermediate mass and it is unclear if the two or three flavor argument applies to our universe .",
    "no doubt a true second order phase transition would only happen in the limit of vanishing quark masses .",
    "hence , in our universe we either had a first order phase transition or merely a cross over .",
    "next we shall use the simplest possible form of an eos incorporating a first - order phase transition , a bag eos which has often been used for the zero - baryon - number and also any baryon - number cases .",
    "since the ratio of baryon - entropy is very small in the early universe , we shall restrict ourselves to the case where the chemical potential is very small , @xmath198 , meaning that we can determine the eos in the absence of chemical potential .",
    "both theoretical considerations @xcite and experimental data collected from relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) suggest that the matter created in heavy ion collisions behaves like a strongly coupled liquid with very low viscosity .",
    "hence , the mit bag model that effectively includes strong interactions via a bag constant can be of use as an equation of state .",
    "the mit bag model was one of the first phenomenological quark models that implemented two of the key properties of qcd , asymptotic freedom and confinement , in a constitutive way . in the mit bag model ,",
    "hadrons are made up of a gas of free ( or only weakly interacting ) quarks and gluons which are confined to a finite region of space , the bag .",
    "we start from the equation of state of matter in the quark phase which can generally be given in the form @xmath199 where @xmath200 with @xmath201 and @xmath202 is the intrinsic statistical weights for the quark - gluon plasma and @xmath203 are the statistical weights of bosons and fermions , respectively . at the epoch of the quark - hadron phase transition photons @xmath204 , electrons @xmath205 , muons @xmath205 and neutrinos @xmath206 yield @xmath207 . here",
    "@xmath190 is two at lower temperature corresponding to the @xmath174 , @xmath175 quarks and three at higher temperatures where the strange quark becomes relativistic , hence @xmath208 .",
    "an effective lagrangian relevant to the study of qgp - hadron phase transition admitting the chiral symmetry of qcd has been proposed in @xcite and is given by @xmath209+\\frac{1}{2}\\partial_{\\mu}\\zeta\\partial^{\\mu}\\zeta+ \\frac{1}{2}\\partial_{\\mu}\\pi\\partial^{\\mu}\\pi+\\frac{1}{4}\\mbox{tr}(\\partial_{\\mu}u\\partial^{\\mu}u^{\\dagger})- v(\\zeta),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath210 , @xmath211 is an element of @xmath212 defined by @xmath213 and @xmath214 refers to the left and right handed components of the quark field @xmath215 .",
    "as can be seen from the above lagrangian , quark fields @xmath215 are interacting with @xmath216 which is formed from the @xmath217 meson field and the scalar field @xmath218 .",
    "the quantity @xmath216 is a well know chiral field since @xmath219 is invariant under vector and axial vector transformations @xcite .",
    "usually , the general form of a self - interacting potential @xmath220 includes a quartic function in terms of @xmath216 . applying temperature effects at @xmath221 we find , second reference in @xcite @xmath222",
    "note that @xmath223 at @xmath221 has a local minimum corresponding to a chirally symmetric , quasi - stable non - physical vacuum with energy density @xmath224 and at @xmath225 has an absolute minimum corresponding to a physical vacuum . in other words , breaking chiral symmetry corresponds to transition @xmath226 in the self - interacting potential function . for more detail the reader",
    "is referred to the appendix of third reference in @xcite .",
    "the quantity @xmath224 is the qcd vacuum energy or bag pressure constant .",
    "the bag is stabilized by a term of the form @xmath227 which is added to the energy - momentum tensor inside the bag , since the energy - momentum tensor of a perfect fluid in the rest frame is given by @xmath228 and hence @xmath224 can be interpreted as a positive contribution to the energy density and a negative contribution to the pressure inside the bag .",
    "the mit bag model can not say anything about the origin of the non - trivial vacuum , but treats @xmath224 as a free parameter .",
    "results obtained in low energy hadron spectroscopy , heavy ion collisions and phenomenological fits of light hadron properties give @xmath229 , @xmath230 and @xmath231 @xcite , where @xmath232 is the the strange quark mass taken in the range @xmath233 .",
    "evolution of the running coupling constant of qcd is governed by the equation @xmath234 where @xmath235 is the number of quark flavors and @xmath236 is a scale parameter of qcd . under the condition @xmath237 the effective constant @xmath238 , that is , at short distances ( high temperatures ) qcd is a perturbative theory with asymptotic freedom .",
    "it is worth mentioning that for @xmath239 one can not use perturbation theory as strongly interacting gluons and quarks start to form bound states of hadrons . hence predicted values of the free parameter @xmath236 is very important .",

    "that only under condition @xmath363 the truncated version is a good approximation to the full causal transport equations . to test this condition",
    ", we use the friedmann equation ( [ e15 ] ) which leads to the inequality @xmath364 the right hand side is an implicit function of @xmath279 through @xmath2 .",
    "the time interval for which this integral is valid is about @xmath365 .",
    "solving the integral ( [ e59 ] ) numerically for the eos of the quark - hadron phase for @xmath280 and @xmath285 gives a value of the order @xmath366 and @xmath367 , respectively .",
    "note that the value of the above integral depends on the values of @xmath269 , so that increasing @xmath269 towards @xmath368 , decreases the value and the approximation becomes invalid .",
    "to arrived at a valid understanding of the evolution of the early universe , we need a reliable eos for the medium filling out the cosmic background . to this end",
    "we adopted the non - detailed balance hl theory in the early universe as a non - equilibrium dissipative system .",
    "concentrating on the assumption that the bulk viscosity cosmological background fluid obeys the eckart evolution equation and the full version of the steady state is fluid , we studied the dynamical evolution of non - detailed balance hl universe during the qgp - hadron first order phase transition in the absence of the cosmological constant @xmath127 in a flat universe .    in the case of non - causal eckart fluid we found that for different values of the running coupling constant of hl gravity @xmath1 , a phase transition occurs .",
    "the results show that as in the absence of viscosity @xcite , with a decrease in @xmath1 , the downfall of the effective temperature becomes faster in the viscous qgp and hadronic phase . also by decreasing @xmath1 , the growth of the scale factor @xmath3 ,",
    "dimensionless ratio @xmath307 and the fall of the deceleration parameter @xmath4 become faster in the viscous qgp phase .",
    "we need to point to the fact that the growth of the scale factor @xmath3 in the viscous hadronic phase is too slow .",
    "inversely , in the viscous hadron phase @xmath307 falls with respect to the cosmic time .",
    "it is interesting to point out that in the viscous hadronic phase , this behavior of @xmath307 in both phases is qualitatively in agreement with the results of lattice qcd calculations .    as mentioned before",
    ", the positive sign of the deceleration parameter @xmath299 in the quark and hadron phase corresponds to decelerating models which means that the early universe in the qgp and hadron phases underwent a decelerating expansion .",
    "note that in the hadronic phase , the rate of negative acceleration is very slow and almost constant .",
    "we also found that the effective temperature has an acceptable behavior for @xmath369 .",
    "the non - detailed balance hl world in the qgp phase has a positive deceleration parameter for @xmath370 . in the hadronic phase",
    "however , for @xmath370 and @xmath341 we have @xmath299 and @xmath301 respectively .",
    "the dimensionless ratio @xmath307 in the qgp and hadron phases for @xmath371 and @xmath372 is in line with what one might expect .    generally speaking , in the presence of the causal full steady state version of the is relativistic viscous fluid , variations in terms of @xmath1 are the same .",
    "we showed that the behavior of the effective temperature @xmath2 in both phases together with hadronic fraction in the mix phase are independent of numerical values of @xmath269 .",
    "however , the behavior of the deceleration parameter @xmath4 and the dimensionless ratio @xmath307 are dependent on @xmath269 .",
    "we saw that in qgp phase the temperature of hl early universe filled with causal , full steady , is fluid , declines faster than the eckart fluid and is indistinguishable from that of the hadronic fraction @xmath358 and temperature @xmath2 in the hadron phase for certain values of @xmath1 .",
    "also we observed that , in qgp phase , the evolution of the scale factor @xmath3 for standard cosmology ( @xmath285 ) in both fluid are in agreement .    for non - detailed balance hl world",
    "filled with a causal , steady state , full version of the is relativistic viscous fluid in the qgp phase for @xmath370 and @xmath341 , we found that @xmath299 and @xmath301 respectively . in the hadronic phase , for @xmath373 and @xmath299 ,",
    "the rate of the negative acceleration was found to be slowly changing . for @xmath374",
    "the sign of the deceleration parameter is negative . in both phases , only in the interval @xmath375 for dimensionless ratio @xmath307 , we observed a compatible behavior with lattice qcd results .",
    "finally , we note that in @xcite the authors have studied the quark - hadron phase transitions ( in the absence of viscosity ) in the context of alternative models of gravity . in @xcite however , using a phenomenological model and lattice qcd simulations the authors have analyzed the effects of viscosity on the phase transition in the context of standard cosmology . in the present work , using different phenomenological models , we have studied the effects of the viscosity on the phase transition in the context of hl early universe .",
    "it is worth noting that we have offered two critical temperatures @xmath259 and @xmath260 for first order phase transition , which according to results presented in @xcite , @xmath260 is unacceptable . also , as shown in @xcite we see that the general behavior of some of the cosmological parameters of the early universe such as temperature @xmath2 and the scale factor in hl early universe for @xmath285 is similar to the standard cosmology .",
    "the authors in @xcite have considered the evolution of the hubble parameter @xmath298 in the framework of the eckart and full causal is fluids .",
    "however what we have done in this work has been to study other cosmological parameters in the eckart and steady full causal is fluids .    9 c. eckart , phys",
