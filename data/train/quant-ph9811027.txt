    "quantum information processing has received a considerable interest in the last years , induced by the possibility of teleporting an unknown quantum state and building a quantum computer .",
    "also new questions on the relation of quantum and classical physics arise in this context .",
    "the feature which makes quantum computation more efficient than classical computation and allows teleportation is entanglement .",
    "therefore there is also an increasing interest in quantifying entanglement @xcite .",
    "our letter considers the quantification by introducing a new entanglement measure .    for pure states on the tensor product of two hilbert spaces",
    "a measure is given by the entanglement of entropy .",
    "let @xmath1 be the set of states on the tensor product of two hilbert spaces @xmath2 , i.e.  the set of all positive trace class operators with trace 1 .",
    "for a pure state @xmath3 , the entanglement of entropy @xmath4 is given by @xmath5 where @xmath6 are the partial traces taken in the hilbert spaces @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the schmidt coefficients of @xmath9 ( cp .",
    "@xcite ) .    considering mixed states",
    ", the situation is more complicated .",
    "several entanglement measures have been defined in this case , e.g.  the entanglement of creation @xcite and the entanglement of distillation @xcite .",
    "here we follow an idea of vedral et al .",
    "@xcite , based on measuring the distance between states in the quantum mechanical state space .",
    "the set of disentangled states @xmath10 is usually considered as the set of all states which can be written as convex combinations of pure tensor states : @xmath11 the general idea of vedral et al .",
    "@xcite to quantify the amount of entanglement of a state @xmath12 is to define a distance of @xmath9 to the set @xmath10 , so that the entanglement @xmath13 of @xmath9 is given by @xmath14 here @xmath15 is any measure of distance between the density matrices @xmath16 and @xmath9 , not necessarily a distance in the metrical sense .",
    "there are several possibilities to define such a distance .",
    "one example is the relative entropy @xmath17 , given by @xmath18 discussed in @xcite .",
    "another example is to take the bures metric as distance @xcite .    as a measure of distance",
    "we discuss in this letter the hilbert - schmidt norm .",

    "we therefore define the hilbert - schmidt entanglement ( hs entanglement ) @xmath22 of a state @xmath9 by @xmath23 the choice of the squared distance instead of @xmath24 is motivated by the fact that it is easier in calculations and justified because they are equivalent to each other .",

    "it can be seen as follows that condition  ( [ second_cond ] ) is satisfied : with @xmath31 , we have @xmath32 where we set @xmath33 . to show that the third condition is fulfilled we apply a theorem of lindblad @xcite .",
    "let @xmath34 be a positive mapping .",
    "then @xmath35    now since @xmath36 is a convex function , we conclude that @xmath30 .",
    "the use of geometric distance in the real vector space of selfadjoint matrices as a measure of entanglement gives us the possibility to _ see the point of minimal distance in @xmath10 ( here referred to as _",
    "basepoint ) for some important cases easily .",
    "recall that the distance of an arbitrary point outside a convex and compact set @xmath37 to this set is the closest distance to any orthogonal projection of the point onto the ( nontrivial ) faces of @xmath37 ( a face @xmath38 of a convex set @xmath39 is a convex subset of @xmath39 such that @xmath40 for @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 imply @xmath44 . a face consisting of one point",
    "is an extremal point of @xmath39 .",

    "the fact that the states @xmath64 are in fact disentangled can be seen easily by either decomposition of @xmath64 into disentangled projectors or partial transposition .",

    ". therefore convex combinations of elements in @xmath10 lead to a convex combination of the result .",

    "the next class of states we are going to deal with also includes the bell - states as special case , namely the _ pure states .",
    "unfortunately , the geometry of the underlying part of the face of @xmath10 proves to be somewhat more complex .",

    "the explicit quantity of the entanglement is a pure matter of calculation .        for the remaining pure states the calculation of the entanglement is a bit more complicated . for this purpose",
