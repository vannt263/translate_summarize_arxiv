    "in the past few years a new standard model of cosmology has been established in which most of the energy density of the universe is made up of a component with negative pressure , generically referred to as dark energy .",
    "the simplest form of dark energy is the cosmological constant , @xmath6 , which obeys @xmath7 .",
    "this model provides an amazingly good fit to all observational data with relatively few free parameters and has allowed for stringent constraints on the basic cosmological parameters .",
    "the precision of the data is now at a level where observations of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) , the large scale structure ( lss ) of galaxies , and type ia supernovae ( snia ) can be used to probe important aspects of particle physics such as neutrino properties .",
    "conversely , cosmology is now also at a level where unknowns from the particle physics side can significantly bias estimates of cosmological parameters .",
    "the combination of all currently available data from neutrino oscillation experiments suggests two important mass differences in the neutrino mass hierarchy .",
    "the solar mass difference of @xmath8 ev@xmath9 and the atmospheric mass difference @xmath10 ev@xmath9 @xcite . in the simplest case where neutrino masses are hierarchical",
    "these results suggest that @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 .",
    "if the hierarchy is inverted one instead finds @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and @xmath16 .",
    "however , it is also possible that neutrino masses are degenerate , @xmath17 .",
    "since oscillation probabilities depend only on squared mass differences , @xmath18 , such experiments have no sensitivity to the absolute value of neutrino masses , and if the masses are degenerate , oscillation experiments are not useful for determining the absolute mass scale .    instead , it is better to rely on kinematical probes of the neutrino mass . using observations of the cmb and the lss of galaxies it has been possible to constrain masses of standard model neutrinos .",
    "the bound can be derived because massive neutrinos contribute to the cosmological matter density , but they become non - relativistic so late that any perturbation in neutrinos up to scales around the causal horizon at matter - radiation equality is erased , i.e.  the kinematics of the neutrino mass influences the growth of structure in the universe .",
    "quantitatively , neutrino free streaming leads to a suppression of fluctuations on small scales relative to large by roughly @xmath19 @xcite .",
    "the density in neutrinos is related to the number of massive neutrinos and the neutrino mass by @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the hubble parameter in units of @xmath22 and all neutrinos are assumed to have the same mass .",
    "such an effect would be clearly visible in lss measurements , provided that the neutrino mass is sufficiently large , and a likelihood analysis based on the standard @xmath6cdm model with neutrino mass as an added parameter in general provides a bound for the sum of neutrino masses of roughly @xmath23 ev , depending on exactly which data is used @xcite .",
    "this should be compared to the present laboratory bound from @xmath24h beta decay found in the mainz experiment , @xmath25 ev @xcite .",
    "it should also be contrasted to the claimed signal for neutrinoless double beta decay in the heidelberg - moscow experiment @xcite , which would indicate a value of 0.1 - 0.9 ev for the relevant combination of mass eigenstates , @xmath26 .",
    "some papers claim that the cosmological neutrino mass bound is already incompatible with this measurement .    however , those claims are based on a relatively limited parameter space . using a much more complicated model with a non - power law primordial power spectrum it is possible to accomodate large neutrino masses ,",
    "provided that snia data is discarded @xcite .",
    "it was recently shown that there is a strong degeneracy between neutrino mass and the equation of state of the dark energy component when cmb , lss , and snia data is considered .",
    "the reason is that when the neutrino mass is increased , the matter density must be increased accordingly in order not to conflict with lss data .",
    "this is normally excluded when the dark energy is in the form of a cosmological constant .",
    "however , when the equation of state parameter of the dark energy fluid , @xmath27 , is taken to be a free parameter , an increase in the matter density can be compensated by a decrease in @xmath27 to more negative values .    here",
    "we study how the degeneracy can be broken by the addition of information provided by the measurement of the baryon acoustic beak in the sloan digital sky survey data and the distances to type ia supernovae provided by the snls data .",
    "we also study constraints derived from combining all available cosmological data , including the measurement of the small scale matter power spectrum from the lyman-@xmath0 forest .",
    "in the next section we discuss the cosmological data used , in section 3 numerical results from the likelihood analysis are provided , and finally section 4 contains a discussion .",
    "in order to probe the neutrino mass we have used some of the most recent precision cmb , lss and snia data .      observations of snia over a wide redshift range to determine cosmological distances is perhaps the most direct way to probe the energy content of the universe @xcite and have lead to a major paradigm shift in cosmology @xcite . while extremely succesful at showing the need for _ dark energy _ to explain the derived distances , these data sets are plagued by systematic uncertainties ( e.g. dust extinction corrections , k - corrections , calibration uncertainties , non - ia contamination , malmquist bias , weak lensing uncertainties , etc . ) rendering them non - optimal for precision tests on @xmath27 .",
    "however , the situation has improved since the start of a dedicated experiment , the supernova legacy survey ( snls ) at cfht .",
    "thanks to the multi - band , rolling search technique , extensive spectroscopic follow - up at the largest ground based telescopes and careful calibration , this data - set is arguably the best high-@xmath28 snia compilation to date , indicated by the very tight scatter around the best fit in the hubble diagram and the careful estimate of systematic uncertainties by astier et al .",
    ", ( 2006 ) @xcite .",
    "the first year data of the snls collaboration includes 71 high redshift snia in the redshift range @xmath29 $ ] and 44 low redshift snia compiled from the literature but analysed in the same manner as the high-@xmath28 sample .",
    "we thus make only use of this new snia data set to minimize the effects from systematic uncertainties in our analysis .",
    "it should be noted that combining the results in ref .",
    "@xcite with the gold sample of riess et al .",
    "( 2004 ) @xcite as done in , e.g. refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite is not straight forward .",
    "first , the two data - sets use the same low - redshift samples to anchor the hubble diagram and are thus not independent .",
    "second , there are systematic differences in the way the sne are analysed , e.g. with respect to reddening corrections . in a combined analysis",
    ", this would have to be adressed .",
    "any large scale structure survey measures the correlation function between galaxies . in the linear regime where fluctuations are gaussian",
    "the fluctuations can be described by the galaxy - galaxy power spectrum alone , @xmath30 . in general , the galaxy - galaxy power spectrum is related to the matter power spectrum via a bias parameter , @xmath31 . in the linear regime ,",
    "the bias parameter is approximately constant , so up to a normalization constant , @xmath32 does measure the matter power spectrum .    at present",
    "there are two large galaxy surveys of comparable size , the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) @xcite and the 2dfgrs ( 2  degree field galaxy redshift survey ) @xcite .",
    "once the sdss is completed in 2006 it will be significantly larger and more accurate than the 2dfgrs . in the present analysis we use data from both surveys . in the data analysis we use only data points on scales larger than @xmath33/mpc in order to avoid problems with non - linearity .",
    "the acoustic oscillations at the time of cmb decoupling should be imprinted also on the low - redshift clustering of matter and manifest themselves as a single peak in the galaxy correlation function at @xmath34 mpc separation . because of the large scale and small amplitude of the peak , surveys of very large volumes are necessary in order to detect the effect .",
    "a power spectrum analysis of the final 2dfgrs data shows deviations from a smooth curve at the scales expected for the acoustic oscillations .",
    "the signature is much smaller than the corresponding acoustic oscillations in the cmb but can be used to reject the case of no baryons at 99% c.l . @xcite .",
    "the sdss luminous red galaxy ( lrg ) sample contains 46,748 galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts @xmath35 over 3816 square degrees . even though the number of galaxies is less than the 2dfgrs or the main sdss samples , the large survey volume ( @xmath36 gpc@xmath24 ) makes the lrg sample better suited for the study of structure on the largest scales .",
    "the lrg correlation function shows a significant bump at the expected scale of @xmath37 mpc which , combined with the detection of acoustic oscillations in the 2dfgrs power spectrum , confirms our picture of lss formation between the epoch of cmb decoupling and the present .    for a given cosmology",
    ", we can predict the correlation function ( up to an amplitude factor which is marginalized over ) and compare with the observed lrg data .",
    "the observed position of the peak will depend on the physical scale of the clustering and the distance relation used in converting the observed angular positions and redshifts to positions in physical space .",
    "the characteristic physical scale of the acoustic oscillations is given by the sound horizon at the time of cmb decoupling and depends most strongly on the combination @xmath38 .",
    "the conversion between positions in angular and redshift space to positions in physical space will cause the observed correlation scale to depend on the distance combination @xmath39^{1/3 } \\",
    ", , \\ ] ] where @xmath40 is the hubble parameter and @xmath41 is the comoving angular diameter distance .",
    "our approach to fit the data has been to calculate the matter power spectrum for a given model , then fourier transforming it to obtain the 2-point correlation function , @xmath42 .",
    "this correlation function has been fitted to the sdss data using the full covariance matrix given by @xcite .    in terms of the simple parametrization provided by @xcite in terms of the parameter @xmath43 we find that the sdss constraint can approximately be written as @xmath44 where @xmath45 .",
    "measurements of the flux power spectrum of the lyman-@xmath0 forest has been used to measure the matter power spectrum on small scales at large redshift . by far the largest sample of spectra",

    "@xcite this data was carefully analyzed and used to constrain the linear matter power spectrum .",
    "the derived amplitude is @xmath46 and the effective spectral index is @xmath47 .",
    "the result has been derived using a very elaborate model for the local intergalactic medium , including full n - body simulations .",
    "it has been shown that using the lyman-@xmath0 data does strengthen the bound on neutrino mass significantly .",

    "the resulting bound on @xmath50 using these parameters was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite to be very similar to those obtained in a full analysis .",
    "furthermore we stress that using these parameters makes it very simple to test the influence on different assumptions about the lyman-@xmath0 data on the neutrino mass bound .",
    "the temperature fluctuations are conveniently described in terms of the spherical harmonics power spectrum @xmath51 .",
    "since thomson scattering polarizes light , there are also power spectra coming from the polarization .",
    "the polarization can be divided into a curl - free @xmath52 and a curl @xmath53 component , yielding four independent power spectra : @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 , and the @xmath57-@xmath58 cross - correlation @xmath59 .",
    "the wmap experiment has reported data on @xmath54 and , @xmath60 , and @xmath59 as described in refs .",
    "we have performed our likelihood analysis using the prescription given by the wmap collaboration  @xcite .",
    "we furthermore use the newly published results from the boomerang experiment @xcite which has measured significantly smaller scales than wmap .",
    "using the presently available precision data we have performed a likelihood analysis for the neutrino mass .",
    "as our framework we choose a flat dark energy model with the following free parameters : @xmath61 , the matter density , the curvature parameter , @xmath62 , the baryon density , @xmath27 , the dark energy equation of state , @xmath63 , the hubble parameter , @xmath49 , the spectral index of the initial power spectrum , @xmath64 , the running of the primordial spectral index , @xmath65 , the effective number of neutrino species , and @xmath66 , the optical depth to reionization .",
