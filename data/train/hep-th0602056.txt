    "it has become clear during the last decade that so - called logarithmic conformal field theories are not just a set of pathological special cases but form a well - defined class of generalised conformal field theories with numerous applications .",

    "the best known example for a logarithmic conformal field theory has central charge @xmath4 .",
    "if realised in terms of the so - called @xmath5 ghost system of zamolodchikov , this theory can not do without logarithms , as was first demonstrated in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .    in recent years , many logarithmic conformal field theories turned out to be bona fide generalisations of rational conformal field theories .",
    "as such , we would prefer to refer to such theories as ` conformal field theories with indecomposable representations ' .",
    "the first example of a rational logarithmic conformal field theory was constructed in @xcite .",
    "actually , it also has central charge @xmath4 and is again related to a ghost system , the so - called symplectic fermions .",
    "logarithmic conformal field theory is now a research field on its own .",
    "for some recent reviews , see @xcite . from a physics point of view , logarithmic conformal field theories appear naturally in various models of statistical physics , for example in the theory of ( multi)critical polymers @xcite , percolation @xcite , two - dimensional turbulence @xcite , the quantum hall effect @xcite and various critical ( disordered ) models @xcite . above that , there have been applications in seiberg - witten models @xcite and in string theory , in particular in the context of d - brane recoil @xcite , and in pp - wave backgrounds @xcite .",
    "logarithmic vertex operator algebras have recently attracted attention in mathematics @xcite .",
    "most examples that have been studied concern the @xmath4 model , but logarithmic conformal field theories have also arisen in other contexts , see for example @xcite .    in",

    "the above - mentioned @xmath8 system can be obtained naturally from a @xmath0 ghost system at @xmath4 @xcite on a branched double cover of the riemann sphere @xcite .",
    "this observation promts the question whether @xmath4 ghosts on higher riemann surfaces , or even ghosts with higher spin , can analogously be extended to logarithmic theories .",
    "we adress this question using a deformation technique similar to the ansatz of @xcite . nevertheless , we make use of the properties of the algebra of modes rather than those of the operator product expansion ( ope ) . for @xmath9 ,",
    "the analogy turns out to be perfect for all genera , as we show in the following . for higher spin ghost systems",
    ", we rule out the pretty well - known jordan - cell type representations .",
    "instead , the action and the form of @xmath7 remains completely unaltered . in our framework , we show highest weight representations as subrepresentations and jordan cells to be mutually exclusive .",
    "nevertheless , we construct examples of ` new ' indecomposable representations . after formulating the general setup in [ setup ] ,",
    "we derive constraints on the deformation , in section [ bedingung ] .",
    "then , we explore our possibilities to obtain jordan cells in [ funny ] , and prove the existence of reducible but indecomposable representations in [ indecs ] . in [ examples ] , we pursue to discuss some examples : first of all , we generalise the results of simple ghosts in presence of @xmath10 twists to the @xmath11 symmetric case in [ c=-2 ] . following that in [ freefields ] , the bilinear deformation , which is a well - defined theory if one sums over all sheet - labels , is considered .",

    "in contrast to the afore mentioned minimal models , in a logarithmic conformal field theory submodules do not necessarily decouple from the rest of the module and thus can not be divided out in all cases .",
    "the term ` indecomposable ' does not refer to irreducible representations for the rest of this paper .",

    "their conjugate modes , called @xmath52 zero modes from now on , are creators to both sides of a correlator . for correlators on the complex plane , the naive calculation @xmath53 for @xmath54 shows that the vacuum is orthogonal to itself ; hence one needs the non - trivial outstate @xmath55 to get a non - zero result .",
    "for higher genus other modes have to be included , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "this is not of interest in our context , because we express higher genus correlators by correlators on the riemann sphere with additional insertions of twists .",
    "this is precisely possible when the non - trivial riemann surface possesses a global @xmath11 symmetry which allows to simultaneously diagonalise all monodromies around any of its branch points . on the contrary",

    "one could speculate that indeed these theories may have applications only in cases , where in some sense the indecomposable structure manifests itself in the action on the space of states of the generator of rotations , whereas the translation operator acts diagonalisable .",

    "this statement was made using the primarity of the @xmath58 s and @xmath31 s wrt the old virasoro modes and therefore is made only for @xmath329 .",
    "the new virasoro modes cease to commute with the currents .",
    "thus , their respective representations do not coincide .",
    "we showed indecomposable representations to exist : the modes @xmath330 yield the usual descendants plus highest weight vectors from other modules . under certain circumstances ,",
    "this even happens though the whole global conformal group remains unaltered . in section [ c=-2 ]",
    ", we constructed a logarithmic extension of the @xmath4 model for arbitrary twists by adding @xmath331 to the virasoro modes as a straightforward generalisation of the construction in @xcite .",
    "we explicitly investigated the action on the space of states of the ansatz @xmath332 the action of the modified energy operators @xmath333 , @xmath334 , on the space of ground states shows the desired rank 2 jordan cells .",
    "we showed that the simple ghost system ( @xmath32 ) is the only fermionic ghost system that allows for this construction .",
    "rank 2 jordan cells for energy operators @xmath335 could furthermore be shown to be possible if and only if @xmath162 .",

    "with multi- and quadrilinear deformations , we found examples of deformations which are well - defined ( @xmath339 ) even on the individual sheets . for the quadrilinear deformation , there are quasi - primary states @xmath340 which vanish under @xmath341 , but not under @xmath342 .",

    "this would be to find a modified current @xmath344 which is consistent with @xmath345 . if one were able to show that @xmath346 had jordan cells , the theory would clearly exhibit logarithmic divergencies .",

    "it is as yet unclear whether the twist remains primary with respect to the modified virasoro modes .",
    "because it has no mode decomposition except in the bosonic language , which proved not to be trustworthy by @xcite , one would have to use the twisted borcherds identity of @xcite to decide that .",
    "particularly exciting would be a bosonisation scheme of the twists which is compatible with the ope .",
    "then , one should investigate the indecomposable structure with respect to the maximally extended chiral symmetry algebra .",
    "for example , it is known that the @xmath4 lcft model is rational with respect to the triplet @xmath351-algebra @xmath352 .",
    "as we have seen , this model is given by the @xmath10 symmetric case of the spin @xmath353 ghost system .",
    "however , there exist consistent cfts for the @xmath11 symmetric case for all @xmath2 . the spectrum of the twist fields of these theories can be found in the kac tables of @xmath351-minimal models of the @xmath354 series at @xmath4 .",
    "interestingly , the value @xmath4 for the central charge appears in the respective minimal series of all these models . at precisely this value , the corresponding @xmath351-algebras collapse to one common object , the so - called unifying @xmath351-algebra @xcite .",
    "recently , the representation theory of the @xmath11 symmetric case was investigated in @xcite , and it would be interesting to see how this relates to the minimal models of the @xmath354 series .    finally , nothing is known about whether the deformations of @xmath11 symmetric @xmath355 ghost systems , @xmath356 , which we constructed in this work , possess extended chiral symmetries .",
    "this is in so far an important issue , as these models clearly are not rational with respect to the virasoro algebra alone .",
    "the corresponding twist fields do not even appear as degenerate representations in the kac table at the central charges @xmath357 .",
    "thus , if our models , which show indecomposable structures , are rational models , this must be entirely due to the extended chiral symmetry .",
    "otherwise , they might yield examples of non - rational logarithmic conformal field theories . in any case",
    ", these models presumably will yield a new class of logarithmic theories , as their indecomposable structure is of an as yet unknown type",
