    "recently , the feynman - schwinger representation ( fsr ) was presented @xcite as a new covariant formalism to calculate the relativistic two - body greens function .",
    "it was shown that the fsr sums up all ladder _ and _ crossed diagrams and that it has the correct static limit if one of the masses of the two particles becomes very large .",
    "furthermore it was argued that the formulation was well suited for essentially nonperturbative gauge theories such as qcd , since the formalism can be set up in a gauge invariant way and the possibility exists to include a vacuum condensate in the interaction kernel via the cumulant expansion .",
    "while the formalism neglects all valence particle loops , one has the possibility to include all self - energy and vertex - correction graphs as well . in this paper",
    "however , we will concentrate on the static limit .    in order to demonstrate the formalism we consider the @xmath0-theory for two charged particles @xmath1 and @xmath2 with masses @xmath3 and @xmath4 and charges @xmath5 and @xmath6 , interacting through exchange of a third , neutral particle @xmath7 with mass @xmath8 .",
    "the euclidean action for this theory is : @xmath9\\\\ & \\equiv & \\int { \\rm d}^4x \\left [ \\chi_i^{\\dagger } \\lambda_i \\chi_i + \\mbox{$\\frac{1}{2}$}\\phi \\left ( \\mu^2 - \\partial_{\\mu}^2 \\right ) \\phi\\right]\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where summation over the index @xmath10 is implied .",
    "the greens function is defined as the transition probability from the initial state @xmath11 to the final state @xmath12 : @xmath13 @xmath14 next , in order to get the sum of all generalized ladder graphs , we neglect the determinant in ( [ 2 ] ) .",
    "this corresponds to neglecting all the @xmath1- and @xmath2-loops and is often called the ` quenched approximation ' .",
    "we now wish to rewrite ( [ 2 ] ) in such a way that we can perform the integration over the remaining field @xmath7 as well . to this end",
    "we exploit the feynman - schwinger representation for @xmath15 : @xmath16 integrating over the @xmath7-field is now straightforward and yields : @xmath17 @xmath18 in case we leave out the self - energy contribution and the vertex - corrections , the wilson loop @xmath19 is simply given by : @xmath20 \\nonumber \\\\ & = & \\exp \\left [ -g_1g_2s_1s_2 \\int_0 ^ 1\\int_0 ^ 1   \\delta \\left(z_1 ( \\tau_1 ) - z_2 ( \\tau_2 )",
    "\\right ) { \\rm d}\\tau_1 { \\rm d}\\tau_2\\right ] \\label{wilson}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath21 is the free scalar two - point function : @xmath22 this formulation for the greens function has the great advantage that it is essentially a quantummechanical one in which the two valence particles interact via a nonlocal interaction",
    ". one can show that ( [ green ] ) and ( [ wilson ] ) sum up all ladder and crossed diagrams . furthermore , if @xmath23 then @xmath24 obeys the following klein - gordon equation : @xmath25 with @xmath26 which reduces to the instantaneous coulomb interaction for the case @xmath27 .",
    "for a euclidean theory it is known that for large times @xmath28 the contributions to @xmath24 are dominated by the lowest lying states and that they fall off exponentially , @xmath29 .",
    "hence , we can obtain the ground state energy by observing that : @xmath30 the time derivative with respect to @xmath31 can be done explicitely .",
    "we project the greens function on a complete set of total and angular momentum states @xmath32 , but due to the nonlocal interaction ( [ wilson ] ) this does _ not _ imply that the degrees of freedom that are associated with the generators of the symmetries ( @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 ) , can be integrated out .    for all our calculations we used the metropolis monte carlo algorithm to perform the integrations over @xmath36 , @xmath37 and all the coordinates .",
    "the value of @xmath38 in ( [ fs ] ) and ( [ wilson ] ) that we needed to get reasonably stable results was typically 25 , so that effectively we had to perform a 200-dimensional integral .",
    "convergence was usually reached after @xmath39 points which took approximately 30 hours of cpu - time on our fastest workstation .    in order to demonstrate that it is indeed possible to determine the actual groundstate within this formalism",
    ", we have investigated the case of one light and one heavy particle interacting through exchange of a massless third particle ( @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 ) .",
    "for the strength of the coupling we took @xmath43 .",
    "the distributions of the coordinates of particle 2 are confined to a very narrow region around their classical values , demonstrating that the heavy particle indeed follows a classical trajectory .",
    "particle 1 shows much more quantum behavior ; its distributions have finite widths .",
    "the normalized distributions of @xmath36 and @xmath37 are shown in figure [ fig - s ] .",
    "note the difference in scales between both distributions .    in figure [ fig1 ]",
    "we show the average of 5 runs as a function of the number of monte carlo points .",
    "the exact result for @xmath44 , obtained by solving the klein - gordon equation ( [ kg ] ) , is @xmath45 and is indicated by the arrow on the right hand side of the figure .",
    "the fsr - result fluctuates around this value and the average over the last @xmath46 monte carlo points is @xmath47 .",
    "this clearly demonstrates the feasibility of the method .",
    "we have also studied in detail the situation where @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "this case is well suited to test the ladder approximation since the solution of the bethe - salpeter equation in the ladder approximation is known exactly @xcite . for values of the coupling constant such that there is a binding energy of roughly 10% of the mass of the constituents",
    ", we find that the full results lie substantially below the ladder predictions .    in conclusion",
    ", we have demonstrated that the fsr is well suited for going beyond the ladder theory in the study of composite systems in field theory . in particular , ground state properties such as the binding energies and bound - state wave functions",
