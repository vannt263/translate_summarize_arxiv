    "the study of galaxies at high redshifts opens an important window on the process of galaxy formation and conditions in the early universe .",
    "the detection of populations of galaxies at high redshifts is one of the great challenges in observational cosmology .",
    "currently three main observational techniques are used to discover high redshift , star - forming galaxies : ( i ) the lyman - break drop - out technique , in which a galaxy is imaged in a combination of three or more optical or near - ir bands .",
    "the longer wavelength filters detect emission in the rest - frame ultraviolet from ongoing star formation , whereas the shorter wavelength filters sample the lyman - break feature .",
    "hence , a lyman - break galaxy appears blue in one colour and red in the other @xcite . by shifting the whole filter set to longer wavelengths",
    ", the lyman - break feature can be isolated at higher redshifts ; ( ii ) sub - millimetre emission , due to dust being heated when it absorbs starlight @xcite .",
    "the bulk of the energy absorbed by the dust comes from the rest - frame ultra - violet and so the dust emission is sensitive to the instantaneous star formation rate ; ( iii ) ly-@xmath2 line emission from star forming galaxies , typically identified using either narrowband imaging @xcite or long - slit spectroscopy of gravitationally lensed regions @xcite .",
    "the ly-@xmath2 emission is driven by the production of lyman - continuum photons and so is dependent on the current star formation rate .",
    "the lyman - break drop - out and sub - millimetre detection methods are more established than ly-@xmath2 emission as a means of identifying substantial populations of high redshift galaxies .",
    "nevertheless , in the last few years there have been a number of  surveys which have successfully found high redshift galaxies e.g. @xcite .",
    "the observational samples have grown in size such that statistical studies of the properties of  emitters have now become possible : for example , the sxds survey @xcite has allowed estimates of the luminosity function ( lfs ) and clustering of  emitters in the redshift range @xmath3 , and the musyc survey @xcite has also produced clustering measurements at @xmath4 .",
    "furthermore , the highest redshift galaxy ( @xmath5 ) robustly detected to date was found using the  technique @xcite .",
    "taking advantage of the magnification of faint sources by gravitational lensing , @xcite reported 6 candidates for  emitters in the redshift range @xmath6 , but these have yet to be confirmed .",
    "the dazle project @xcite is designed to find  emitters at @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "however , the small field of view of the instrument ( @xmath9 ) makes it difficult to use to study large scale structure ( lss ) at such redshifts . on the other hand ,",
    "the elvis survey @xcite would appear to offer a more promising route to study the lss of very high redshift galaxies ( @xmath1 ) .    despite these observational breakthroughs , predictions of the properties of star - forming  emitting galaxies are still in the relatively early stages of development .",
    "often these calculations employ crude assumptions about the galaxy formation process to derive a star formation rate and hence a  luminosity , or use hydrodynamical simulations , which , due to the high computational overhead , study relatively small cosmological volumes .",
    "@xcite made predictions for the escape fraction of  emission and the abundance of  emitters using the press - schechter formalism and a prescription for the dust distribution in galaxies .",
    "radiative transfer calculations of the escape fraction have been made by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite for idealized geometries , while @xcite and @xcite applied these calculations to galaxies taken from cosmological hydrodynamical simulations . @xcite and",
    "@xcite calculated the number density of ly-@xmath2 emitters using hydrodynamical simulations of galaxy formation .",
    "nagamine et  al .",
    "( 2006 , 2008 ) used hydrodynamical simulations to predict the abundance and clustering of  emitters .",
    "the typical computational boxes used in these calculations are very small ( @xmath10mpc ) , which makes it impossible to evolve the simulation accurately to @xmath11 .",
    "hence , it is difficult to test if the galaxy formation model adopted produces a reasonable description of present day galaxies .",
    "furthermore , the small box size means that reliable clustering predictions can only be obtained on scales smaller than the typical correlation length of the galaxy sample .",
    "as we will show in this paper , small volumes are subject to significant fluctuations in clustering amplitude .",
    "the semi - analytical approach to modelling galaxy formation allows us to make substantial improvements over previous calculations of the properties of  emitters .",
    "the speed of this technique means that large populations of galaxies can be followed .",
    "the range of predictions which can be made using semi - analytical models is , in general , broader than that produced from most hydrodynamical simulations , so that the model predictions can be compared more directly with observational results .",
    "a key advantage is that the models can be readily evolved to the present - day , giving us more faith in the ingredients used ; i.e. we can be reassured that the physics underpinning the predictions presented for a high - redshift population of galaxies would not result in too many bright / massive galaxies at the present day .",
    "the first semi - analytical calculation of the properties of emitters based on a hierarchical model of galaxy formation was carried out by @xcite .",
    "this is the model used throughout this work , which has been shown to be successful in predicting the properties of  emitters over a wide range of redshifts .",
    "the semi - analytical model allows us to connect  emission to other galaxy properties .",
    "@xcite showed that this model succesfully predicts the observed  lfs and equivalent widths ( ews ) , along with some fundamental physical properties , such as star formation rates ( sfrs ) , gas metallicities , and stellar and halo masses . in @xcite",
    ", we used the model to make further predictions for the lf of very high redshift  emitters and to study the feasibility of current and forthcoming surveys which aim to detect such high redshift galaxies .",
    "@xcite developed an independent semi - analytical model to derive the luminosity functions of  emitters .",
    "the focus of this paper is to use the model introduced by @xcite to study the clustering of high - redshift  emitting galaxies and to extend the comparison of model predictions with current observational data .",
    "@xcite already gave an indirect prediction of the clustering of  emitters by studying galaxy bias as a function of  luminosity .",
    "however , these results depend on an analytical model for the halo bias @xcite , and furthermore the linear bias assumption breaks down on small scales . here",
    "we will present an explicit calculation of the clustering of galaxies by implementing the semi - analytical model on top of a large n - body simulation of the hierarchical clustering of the dark matter distribution .",
    "this allows us to predict the spatial distribution of  emitting galaxies , and to create realistic maps of emitters at different redshifts .",
    "these maps can be analysed with simple statistical tools to quantify the spatial distribution and clustering of galaxies at high redshifts .",
    "the n - body simulation used in this work is the _ millennium simulation _ , carried out by the virgo consortium @xcite .",
    "the simulation of the spatial distribution of  emitters is tested by creating mock catalogues for different surveys of  emitting galaxies in the range @xmath12 .",
    "the clustering of  emitters in our model is analysed with correlation functions and halo occupation distributions .",
    "taking advantage of the large volume of the millennium simulation , we also compute the errors expected on correlation function measurements from various surveys due to cosmic variance .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows : section 2 gives a brief description of the semi - analytical galaxy formation model and describes how it is combined with the n - body simulation . in section 3",
    "we establish the range of validity of our simulated galaxy samples by studying the completeness fractions in the model  luminosity functions .",
    "section 4 gives our predictions for the clustering of  emitters in the range @xmath13 . in section 5",
    "we compare our simulation with recent observational data and we also make predictions for future measurements ( clustering and number counts ) expected from the elvis survey .",
    "finally , section 6 gives our conclusions .",
    "we use the semi - analytical model of galaxy formation , ` galform ` , to predict the properties of the  emission of galaxies and their abundance as a function of redshift .",
    "the ` galform `  model is fully described in @xcite ( see also the review by * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the variant used here was introduced by @xcite ( see also * ? ? ? * for a more detailed description ) .",
    "the model computes star formation histories for the whole galaxy population , following the hierarchical evolution of the host dark matter haloes .",
    "the merger histories of dark matter haloes are calculated using a monte carlo method , following the formalism of the extended press & schechter theory @xcite .",
    "when using monte carlo merger trees , the mass resolution of dark matter haloes can be arbitrarily high , since the whole of the computer memory can be devoted to one tree rather than a population of trees .",
    "in contrast , n - body merger trees are constrained by a finite mass resolution due to the particle mass , which is usually poorer than that typically adopted for monte carlo merger trees .",
    "discrepancies between the model predictions obtained with monte carlo trees and those extracted from a simulation only become evident fainter than some luminosity which is set by the mass resolution of the n - body trees , as we will see in the next section ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .             a critical assumption of the baugh et al .",
    "model is that stars formed in starbursts have a top - heavy initial mass function ( imf ) , where the imf is given by @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "stars formed quiescently in discs have a solar neighbourhood imf , with the form proposed by @xcite : @xmath16 for @xmath17 and @xmath18 for @xmath19 .",
    "both imfs cover the mass range @xmath20 . within the framework of @xmath0cdm ,",
    "baugh et  al . argued that the top - heavy imf is essential to match the counts and redshift distribution of galaxies detected through their sub - millimetre emission , whilst retaining the match to galaxy properties in the local universe , such as the optical and far - ir luminosity functions and galaxy gas fractions and metallicities .",
    "@xcite showed that such a top - heavy imf also results in predictions for the metal abundances in the intra - cluster medium and in elliptical galaxies in much better agreement with observations .",
    "@xcite showed that the same model predicts galaxy evolution in the ir in good agreement with observations from _ spitzer _ , and also discussed independent observational evidence for a top - heavy imf .",
    "reionization is assumed in our model to occur at @xmath21 @xcite .",
    "the photoionization of the intergalactic medium ( igm ) is assumed to suppress the collapse and cooling of gas in haloes with circular velocities @xmath22 at redshifts @xmath23 @xcite .",
    "recent calculations @xcite imply that the above parameter values overstate the impact of photoionization on gas cooling , and suggest that photoionization only affects smaller haloes with @xmath24 .",
    "our model predictions , for the range of  luminosities we consider in this paper , are not significantly affected by adopting the lower @xmath25 cut .",
    "we neglect any attenuation of the  flux by propagation through the igm .",
    "this effect would suppress the observed  flux mainly for @xmath26 , so this should only affect our results for very high redshifts ( @xmath27 ) .",
    "the model used to predict the luminosities and equivalent widths of the  galaxies is identical to that described in @xcite .",
    "the  emission is computed by the following procedure : ( i ) the integrated stellar spectrum of the galaxy is calculated , based on its star formation history , including the effects of the distribution of stellar metallicities , and taking into account the imfs adopted for different modes of star formation .",
    "( ii ) the rate of production of lyman continuum ( lyc ) photons is computed by integrating over the stellar spectrum , and assuming that all of these ionizing photons are absorbed by neutral hydrogen within the galaxy .",
    "we calculate the fraction of  photons produced by these lyc photons , assuming case b recombination @xcite .",
    "\\(iii ) the observed  flux depends on the fraction of  photons which escape from the galaxy ( @xmath28 ) , which is assumed to be constant and independent of galaxy properties .",
    "calculating the  escape fraction from first principles by following the radiative transfer of the  photons is very demanding computationally .",
    "a more complete calculation of the escape fraction would have into account the structure and kinematic properties of the intestellar medium ( ism ) @xcite .",
    "in our model , we adopt the simplest possible approach , which is to fix the escape fraction , @xmath28 , to be the same for each galaxy , without taking into account its dust properties .",
    "this results in a surprisingly good agreement between the predicted number counts and luminosity functions of emitters and the available observations at @xmath29 @xcite .",
    "@xcite chose @xmath30 to match the number counts at @xmath31 at a flux @xmath32 . the same value is used in this work .",
    "this value for the  escape fraction seems very small , but is consistent with direct observational estimates for low redshift galaxies : @xcite derive escape fractions for a sample of nearby star - forming galaxies by combining measurements of ly@xmath2 , h@xmath2 and h@xmath33 , and find that most have escape fractions of 3% or less .",
    "@xcite also showed that if a standard solar neighbourhhod imf is adopted for all modes of star formation , then a substantially larger escape fraction would be required to match the observed counts of  emitters , and even then the overall match would not be as quite good as it is when the top - heavy imf is used in bursts .",
    "once we obtain the galaxy properties from the semi - analytical model , we plant these galaxies into a n - body simulation , in order to add information about their positions and velocities . the simulation used here is the _ millennium simulation _ @xcite .",
    "this simulation adopts concordance values for the parameters of a flat @xmath0cdm model , @xmath34 and @xmath35 for the densities of matter and baryons at @xmath11 , @xmath36 for the present - day value of the dimensionless hubble constant , @xmath37 for the _ rms _ linear mass fluctuations in a sphere of radius @xmath38mpc at @xmath11 and @xmath39 for the slope of the primordial fluctuation spectrum .",
    "the simulation follows @xmath40 dark matter particles from @xmath41 to @xmath11 within a cubic region of comoving length @xmath42 .",
    "the individual particle mass is @xmath43 , so the smallest dark halo which can be resolved has a mass of @xmath44 .",
    "dark matter haloes are identified using a _ friends - of - friends _ ( fof ) algorithm . to populate the simulation with galaxies from the semi - analytical model",
    ", we use the same approach as in @xcite .",
    "first , the position and velocity of the centre of mass of each halo is recorded , along with the positions and velocities of a set of randomly selected dark matter particles from each halo .",
    "second , the list of halo masses is fed into the semi - analytical model in order to produce a population of galaxies associated with each halo .",
    "each galaxy is assigned a position and velocity within the halo . since the semi - analytical model distinguishes between central and satellite galaxies ,",
    "the central galaxy is placed at the centre of mass of the halo , and any satellite galaxy is placed on one of the randomly selected halo particles . once galaxies have been generated , and positions and velocities have been assigned , it is a simple process to produce catalogues of galaxies with spatial information and any desired selection criteria .",
    "the combination of the semi - analytical model with the n - body simulation is essential to study the detailed clustering of a desired galaxy population , although the clustering amplitude on large scales can also be estimated analytically @xcite .",
    "an example of the output of the simulation is shown in the four images of fig .",
    "[ fig.sample ] which show redshifts @xmath11 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "the dark matter distribution ( shown in green ) becomes smoother as we go to higher redshifts , due to the gravitational growth of structures .",
    "as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig.sample ] , for this particular luminosity cut , the number density of  emitters varies at different redshifts .",
    "as we will show in the next section , these catalogues at high redshift are not complete at faint luminosities , so we have to restrict our predictions to brighter luminosities as we go to higher redshifts .",
    "the model presented by @xcite differs in two main ways from the one presented in this paper : ( i ) there is a slight difference in the values of the cosmological parameters used , and ( ii ) the earlier work used a grid of halo masses together with an analytical halo mass function , rather than the set of haloes from an n - body simulation . in  3.1 , we investigate the impact of the different choice of cosmological parameters on the luminosity function of emitters , to see if the very good agreement with observational data obtained by @xcite is retained on adopting the millennium cosmology . in  3.2 , we assess the completeness of our samples of  emitters due to the finite mass resolution of the millennium simulation .",

    "therefore , when putting ` galform `  galaxies into the millennium , our sample does not contain galaxies which formed in haloes with masses below the resolution limit of the millennium . this introduces an incompleteness into our catalogues when compared to the original ` galform`prediction .",

    "we notice that the model for this sample has a significantly steeper slope , @xmath159 , than the canonical value @xmath158 , and so we do our fits to the mocks using @xmath159 .",
    "we find a median amplitude in the mocks @xmath209 , where the error bars give the 95% range .",
    "we have combined a semi - analytical model of galaxy formation with a high resolution , large volume n - body simulation to make predictions for the spatial distribution of  emitters in a @xmath0cdm universe .",
    "our model for  emitters is appealingly simple . using the star formation history predicted for each galaxy from the semi - analytical model to compute the production of lyman continuum photons",
    ", we find that on adopting a constant escape fraction of  photons the observed number of  emitters can be reproduced amazingly well over a range of redshifts @xcite .",
    "our modelling of emission may appear overly simplistic on first comparison to other calculations in the literature .",
    "for example , @xcite predicted the clustering of  emitters in a gas - dynamic simulation , modelling the  emission through a  escape fraction or a duty cycle scenario .",
    "however , the fraction of active emitters in the duty cycle scenario needs to be tuned at each redshift , for which there is no physical justification . since our predictions for  emission are derived from a full model of galaxy formation , it is straightforward to extract other properties of the emitters , such as their stellar mass or the mass of their host dark matter halo ( le delliou et  al .",
    "2006 ) . in this paper",
    "we have extended this work to include explicit predictions for the spatial and angular clustering of  emitters .",
    "we have studied how the clustering strength of  emitters depends upon their luminosity as a function of redshift .",
    "generally , we find that  emitters show a weak dependence of clustering strength on luminosity , until the brightest luminosities we consider are reached . at the present day ,  emitters display weaker clustering than the dark matter .",
    "this changes dramatically at higher redshifts ( @xmath112 ) , with currently observable  emitters predicted to be much more strongly clustered than the dark matter , with the size of the bias increasing with redshift .",
    "we compared the simulation results with analytical estimates of the bias .",
    "whilst the analytical results show the same trends as the simulation results , they do not match well in detail , and this supports the use of an n - body simulation to study the clustering .",
    "a key advantage of using semi - analytical modelling is that the evolution of the galaxy population can be readily traced to the present day .",
    "this gives us some confidence in the star formation histories predicted by the model .",
    "the semi - analytical model passes tests on the predicted distribution of star formation rates at high redshift ( the number counts and redshifts of galaxies detected by their sub - millimetre emission and the luminosity function of lyman - break galaxies ) , whilst also giving a reasonable match to the present day galaxy luminosity function ( baugh et  al .",
    "2005 ) , and also matching the observed evolution of galaxies in the infrared @xcite .",
    "gas dynamic simulations as a whole struggle to reproduce the present - day galaxy population , due to a combination of a limited simulation volume ( set by the need to attain a particular mass resolution ) and a tendency to overproduce massive galaxies .",
    "the small box size typically employed in gas dynamic simulations means that fluctuations on the scale of the box become nonlinear at low redshifts , and their evolution can no longer be accurately modelled . a further consequence of the small box size is that predictions for clustering are limited to small pair separations ( e.g. @xcite use a box of side 33 , limiting their clustering predictions to scales @xmath210 ) . by using a simulation with a much larger volume than that of any existing survey",
    ", we can subdivide the simulation box to make many mock catalogues to assess the impact of sampling fluctuations ( including cosmic variance ) on current and future measurements of the clustering of  emitters .",
    "we made mock catalogues of  emitters to compare with the musyc ( @xmath60 ) and sxds ( @xmath211 ) surveys , and to make predictions for the forthcoming elvis survey at @xmath212 . in the case of musyc and sxds",
    ", we found that the observed number of galaxies lies within the 10 - 90 percentile interval of the number of  emitters found in the mocks .",
    "we find that high - redshift clustering surveys underestimate their uncertainties significantly if they fail to account for cosmic variance in their error budget .",
    "overall , the measured angular correlation functions are consistent with the model predictions .",
    "the clustering results in our mock catalogues span a wide range of amplitudes due to the small volumes sampled by the surveys , which results in a large cosmic variance .",
    "elvis will survey  emitters at very high redshift ( @xmath213 ) .",
    "our predictions show that a single pointing will be strongly affected by sample variance , due to the small volume surveyed and the strong intrinsic clustering of the  emitters which will be detected at this redshift .",
    "many elvis pointings will be required to get a robust clustering measurement .    we have shown that surveys of  emitters can open up a new window on the high redshift universe , tracing sites of active star formation . with increasing redshift",
    ", the environments where emitters are found in current and planned surveys become increasingly unusual , sampling the galaxy formation process in regions that are likely to be proto - clusters and the progenitors of the largest dark matter structures today .",
    "our calculations show that with such strong clustering , surveys of  emitters covering much larger cosmological volumes are needed in order to minimize cosmic variance effects .",
