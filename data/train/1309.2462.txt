    "imagine you measure in the laboratory a given quantity @xmath0 for six different _ systems _ : system 1 , system 2 ,  , and system 6 ( they could be cell types , people , proteins or dna vectors , even the same system at different times if the quantity @xmath0 is expected to evolve in some reproducible manner ) . you want to be sure that you are making no mistakes , so you repeat the whole set of six measures three times , say , in different days ( you try hard so that the only thing that changes from one time to the next is the day ) .",
    "we will call each one of these repeated experiments an _ assay _ , in this case , assay 1 , assay 2 and assay 3 . at the end of the process , you are in possession of @xmath1 values of the quantity @xmath0 ; six for each assay , three for each system .",
    "now imagine you obtain the values in tab .  [",
    "tab : uncorrected_raw ] ( the strange names for the six systems in the first column will be explained later ) .",
    "the first thing we can say about the results is that they do not look good at all .",
    "the standard deviation from the average is comparable to the average itself for most of the systems , and only on a couple of them you are ` lucky ' enough so that the former is about half the value of the latter .",
    "you check the corresponding chart in fig .",
    "[ fig : errorbars_uncorrected ] , and you see the same despairing situation .",
    "the error bars are humongous !    .[tab",
    ": uncorrected_raw]activity of the metluc protein ( @xmath0 quantity ) under the control of six different promoter sequences ( the six systems ) measured in three assays .",
    "the last two columns correspond to the average @xmath2 of the three assays for each system , and the associated standard deviation ( or error ) @xmath3 .",
    "the units as well as the rest of the experiment s details are described in sec .",
    "[ subsec : experiment ] . [ cols=\"<,>,>,>,>,^,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     * it demands an arbitrary choice ( that of the normalizing system ) which seems ad hoc and prevents automatization in some degree . related to this ,",
    "the fact that the corrected result for the normalizing system has zero standard deviation does not seem easy to interpret , nor completely legitimate . *",
    "if we recall the general formula for the propagation of errors @xcite , @xmath4 where @xmath5 is a function of @xmath6 random variables with standard deviations ( errors ) @xmath7 , we can use it to compute the error in the normalized quantity @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the measured result for the system @xmath10 ( in a given assay ) and @xmath11 is the quantity measured for the system chosen to normalize the results : @xmath12 we see that the error in the normalized quantity @xmath13 relative to the value of @xmath13 itself is the sum of the relative errors of @xmath9 and @xmath11 .",
    "now , if we happen to choose a particular normalizing system with high relative error , this could spoil the whole assay when we divide all the results by @xmath11 , even if the rest of measures were accurate . *",
    "the described normalizing procedure seems fit to eliminate multiplicative systematic errors , but not additive ones .",
    "our method suffers from none of these problems :    * no choice of a ` special ' normalizing system is needed .",
    "( there is a choice of a reference assay , but it is made in a justified way , as we have explained . ) * in a manner of speaking , it distributes the normalization among all the values in a given assay , thus minimizing the probability that one specially bad apple spoils the whole basket . *",
    "it eliminates both multiplicative and additive systematic errors .",
    "if we check exhaustive textbooks in biostatistics , such as @xcite , or more wide ranging ones , such as @xcite , we do not find any account of a correcting method that is similar to what we propose here .",
    "some of the texts come close sometimes , but they never hit the target .",
    "one way in which they often come close is when they discuss _ repeated measures_. see for example @xcite , @xcite , or @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite for detailed discussions of the concept in biosciences . `",
    "repeated measures ' consists of an experimental setup very similar to the one used here and described in sec .",
    "[ subsec : setup ] , i.e. , measuring the same quantity on @xmath14 systems and repeating the experiment @xmath15 times , but it contains a fundamental difference : it tackles measurements _ that are expected to change from repetition to repetition _",
    "[ e.g. , a time series , or table  ii of @xcite discussed in sec .",
    "[ subsec : setup ] ] .",
    "it is a key of our setup that we expect the results of several repetitions to be _",
    "the same_. this is why it makes sense for us to correct them , which would be unnatural in the repeated - measures setup . also , for repeated measures , it is not a requirement that we are not interested in the absolute value but only in the inter - system variation . in our case , this is essential .    in @xcite , another similar situation to the one we have considered here",
    "is dealt with , namely _ blocking _",
    ", however , they do not discuss what to do if there is an obvious linear correlation between the blocks ( as in their figure  13.6a ) .",
    "their example in figure  13.12 also seems ripe to apply our method , but they take no correcting action on it .",
    "one of the reasons that we imagine could be behind the fact that no precedents of our straightforward method are found in the literature ( as far as we have been able to scan it ) has to do with the usual interpretation of the range of application of the least - squares fit protocol .",
    "typically , fitting some values in the @xmath0-axis against those on the @xmath16-axis is used to assess a possible linear relationship between _ two different quantities _ ( apples and oranges , say ) .",
    "so much so that @xmath0 is typically called the _ independent variable _ , while @xmath16 is the _ dependent _ one . in our approach",
    ", it is a key conceptual step to realize that it actually makes sense to investigate the linear correlation of some quantity _ with itself _ ( measured in two different assays ) , and consequently interpret any difference between the two as experimental error ( in the manner we explained before ) .",
    "another reason that is possibly behind the absence of precedents is the fact that , despite being quite intuitive to us , systematic errors of the _ multiplicative _ kind are very rarely discussed in the literature .",
    "systematic errors are normally considered to be additive .    after a thorough search we have only found anecdotal mentions in a paper that discusses the influence of natural fires on the air pollution of the moscow area @xcite , in a proceedings paper about anticorrosion coating @xcite , in a recent work concerned with calibration of spectrographs for detecting earth - mass planets around sun - like stars @xcite , and in a similar paper focused in the detection and study of quasars @xcite . in all these works",
    "the authors consider the possibility of a multiplicative systematic error in their models or measurements , but they take no action to correct it .",
    "something very similar happens in @xcite , where the existence of multiplicative systematic errors is acknowledged in the context of analytical chemistry , as well as the necessity to eliminate them . in @xcite , the possibility of both additive and multiplicative systematic errors",
    "is discussed , as well as their respective relation with non - zero @xmath16-intercepts and non - unit slopes . finally , in @xcite , the authors not only discuss multiplicative systematic errors ( which they also call _ gain shifts _ or _ gain errors _ ) , but they provide several examples where this multiplicative systematic error can appear .",
    "although more space is dedicated in these last three works to the discussion of multiplicative systematic errors , the authors do not provide any method for eliminating them either .",
    "in addition , it is worth mentioning that , in @xcite and in @xcite , the authors consider the error to be defined with respect to ` true ' ( or at least more accurate ) results ; in the first case to calibrate experimental protocols , in the second one to calibrate measuring devices . as we explained when discussing the choice of the reference assay ,",
    "our perspective on this issue is different , and so it is the approach .",
    "for example , if you want to correct your results against some ` better ' data , you are presumably interested not only in the variations of the measured quantity , but also in its absolute value .",
    "we have only found one work , concerned with gas electron diffraction data @xcite , in which the authors _ both _ consider the existence of multiplicative systematic errors _ and _ take actions to correct them . however , the proposed correction is particular to the concrete problem studied , and the experimental setup is different to the one described in sec .",
    "[ subsec : setup ] : the authors refer to systematic errors in experimental data with respect to the ` true ' values , not to systematic errors between different measures of the same quantity as we do here .",
    "we have introduced a method for correcting the data in experiments in which a single quantity @xmath0 is measured for a number of systems in multiple repetitions or assays .",
    "if we are not interested in the absolute value of @xmath0 but only in the inter - system variations , and the results in different assays are highly correlated with one another , we can use the proposed method to eliminate both additive and systematic differences ( errors ) between each one of the assays and a suitably chosen reference one . as we have shown using a real example of a cell biology experiment",
    ", this correction can considerably reduce the standard deviation in the systems averages across assays , and consequently improve the statistical significance of the data .",
    "the method is of very general applicability , not only to experimental results but possibly also to numerical simulations , as long as the structure of the setup and the requirements on the data are those just mentioned and carefully discussed in sec .",
    "[ subsec : setup ] .",
    "this , together with its simplicity of application ( the only mathematical infrastructure needed to apply it is basically least - squares linear fits ) , makes the method of very wide interest in any quantitative scientific field that deals with data subject to uncertainty .    some possible lines of future work include the application of the method to a wider variety of problems , a deeper statistical analysis of its properties and the assumptions behind it , or the extension to systematic differences of higher - than - linear order that we briefly mentioned in sec .",
