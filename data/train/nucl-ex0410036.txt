    "however the rate of @xmath2c(@xmath3,@xmath0)@xmath1o is poorly determined as the cross section was measured experimentally down to energies around 1 mev and needs to be extrapolated to helium - burning energies around 300 kev .",
    "the @xmath2c(@xmath3,@xmath0)@xmath1o cross section is composed of 3 major parts : e1 , e2 ground state transitions and cascade transitions .",
    "ground state transitions provide most of the total cross section while cascade transitions have contributions of the order of 10 - 20@xmath4 . determining the @xmath8-mev branching ratio will result in a better extrapolation of the cascade and @xmath6 ground state cross sections to lower energies @xcite .",
