    "power transfer ( wpt ) via radio - frequency radiation is attracting more and more attention .",
    "rf radiation has indeed become a viable source for energy harvesting with clear applications in wireless sensor networks ( wsn ) and internet of things ( iot ) @xcite .",
    "interestingly , since wpt and wireless communication share the same rf medium to transfer power and information , the emerging field of simultaneous wireless information and power transfer ( swipt ) has recently attracted significant attention in academia @xcite .",
    "the challenge with wpt is to find ways to increase the dc power level at the output of the energy harvester without increasing the transmit power .",
    "most of the technical efforts have been devoted to the design of efficient energy harvesters ( so - called rectenna ) @xcite .",
    "interestingly , the overall rf - to - dc conversion efficiency of the rectenna is not only a function of its design but also of its input waveform .",
    "however , the waveform design has received less attention @xcite . in @xcite",
    ", a multisine signal excitation is shown through analysis , simulations and measurements to enhance the dc power and rf - dc conversion efficiency over a single sinewave signal . in @xcite , various input waveforms ( ofdm , white noise , chaotic )",
    "are considered and experiments show that waveforms with high peak to average power ratio ( papr ) increase rf - to - dc conversion efficiency .",
    "even though those papers provide some useful insights into the impact of waveform design onto wpt performance , there are many limitations in the wpt waveform design literature : 1 ) there has not been any formal tool to optimize waveforms for wpt so far , 2 ) multipath fading ( well known in wireless communications ) has been ignored despite its tremendous impact on the received waveform at the input of the energy harvester , 3 ) the channel state information ( csi ) is assumed unknown to the transmitter , 4 ) the transmitter is commonly equipped with a single antenna .    in the rapidly expanding swipt community , the non - linearity of the energy harvester is not accurately modeled . it is indeed assumed that the harvested dc power is modeled as a conversion efficiency constant multiplied by the average power of the input signal to the energy harvester @xcite .",
    "this was used so as to simplify the design of swipt but is unfortunately unrealistic @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we tackle the important problem of waveform optimization for multiple input - single output ( miso ) wpt .",
    "we consider wpt with a multisine waveform ( due to its popularity in communication , e.g.  ofdm ) on each antenna and transmission over a multipath channel .",
    "we introduce a simple and tractable analytical model of the energy havester , accounting for its nonlinearity . assuming perfect channel state information at the transmitter ( csit ) can be attained ( in a similar way as it is done in wireless communication systems )",
    ", we formulate an optimization problem to adaptively change on each transmit antenna the multisine waveform as a function of the csi so as to maximize the output dc current at the energy harvester . the globally optimal phases of multisine waveform weights are obtained in closed form while the locally optimal amplitudes are shown to result from a non - convex posynomial maximization problem subject to a power constraint , which can be formulated as a reverse geometric programming and solved iteratively .",
    "the optimized waveforms adaptive to the csi are shown to provide significant gains over state - of - the - art waveforms .",

    "we take a taylor expansion of the exponential function around a fixed operating voltage drop @xmath54 such that the diode current can be equivalently written as @xmath55 where @xmath56 and @xmath57 , @xmath58 . as such",
    ", it is not easy to infer from the exact dependencies of the diode current on the waveform parameters since both @xmath46 and @xmath59 will depend and fluctuate over time as a function of the waveform . nevertheless , assuming a steady - state response ,",
    "an ideal rectifier would deliver a constant output voltage @xmath60 that would track the largest peaks of the input voltage @xmath46 @xcite . as a consequence",
    ", the output current delivered to the load @xmath61 would also be constant . denoting the magnitude of the peaks of @xmath46 as @xmath62 , @xmath63 . in this ideal rectifier ,",
    "since @xmath60 is a constant ( we drop the time dependency ) , a suitable choice of the operating voltage drop @xmath64 would be @xmath65 since @xmath66 . under such assumptions ,",
    "can simply be written as @xmath67 , which now makes the dependency between the diode current @xmath48 , the received waveform @xmath39 and therefore the transmitted waveforms @xmath68 much more explicit . moreover , with such a choice of @xmath69 , the taylor expansion of the exponential function could be truncated without compromising too much on the accuracy",
    ".      the problem at hand will be the design of @xmath68 such that the output dc current is maximized . under the ideal rectifier assumption ,",
    "the current delivered to the load in a steady - state response is constant and given by @xmath70 .    in order to make the optimization tractable but keep the fundamental non - linear behaviour of the diode",
    ", we truncate the taylor expansion to the fourth order , as argued in @xcite to be sufficient to demonstrate the rectification operation .",
    "the output current therefore approximates as @xmath71 applying to and taking the expectation over time , we get an approximation of the dc component of the current at the output of the rectifier ( and the low - pass filter ) with a multisine excitation over a multipath channel as @xmath72 where @xmath73 is detailed in ( at the top of next page ) .",

    ", we note that @xmath78 only accounts for the second order term in the taylor expansion and ignores the non - linearity of the rectifier ( modeled by the fourth order term ) .",
    "the maximization of @xmath78 subject to the transmit power constraint would lead to a single - sinewave transmission strategy where the power is allocated to the strongest sinewave , i.e.  the one corresponding to the strongest channel @xcite .",
    "this contrasts with rf experiments that highlight the usefulness of allocating power to multiple sinewaves @xcite .",
    "if non - linearity is accounted for , the presence of the fourth order term in suggests that transmitting over a single sinewave is in general suboptimal .",
    "assuming the rectifier characteristics @xmath79 and the channel state information ( in the form of frequency response @xmath80 ) are known to the transmitter , we now aim at finding the optimal set of amplitudes and phases ( across antennas and frequencies ) @xmath81 that maximize @xmath61 , i.e.@xmath82 from the previous section , we however note that @xmath79 are functions of @xmath69 which is affected by the choice of @xmath81 .",
    "similarly , @xmath81 are functions of @xmath79 .",

    "given the optimal phases , the optimal amplitudes can be computed numerically .      to maximize @xmath85 ,",
    "we should aim at guaranteeing that all @xmath86 are equal to 1 in .",
    "this can be satisfied by choosing @xmath87 @xmath88 ( and therefore @xmath89 @xmath90 ) , which implies from to choose the optimal sinewave phases as @xmath91 .",
    "@xmath92 is obtained by collecting @xmath93 @xmath88 into matrix .      with the optimal phases , @xmath87 and @xmath94 such that @xmath95 is simply obtained from by replacing all @xmath86 functions by 1 .",
    "recall from @xcite that a monomial is defined as the function @xmath96 where @xmath97 and @xmath98 .",
    "a sum of @xmath99 monomials is called a posynomial and can be written as @xmath100 with @xmath101 where @xmath102 . as we can see from , @xmath95 is a posynomial .",
    "the optimization problem becomes @xmath103 it therefore consists in maximizing a posynomial subject to a power constraint ( which itself is written as a posynomial ) .",
    "unfortunately this problem is not a standard geometric program ( gp ) but it can be transformed to an equivalent problem by introducing an auxiliary variable @xmath104 @xmath105    this is known as a reverse geometric program due to the minimization of a posynomial subject to upper and lower bounds inequality constraints @xcite .",
    "note that @xmath106 is equivalent to @xmath107 .",
    "however @xmath108 is not a posynomial , therefore preventing the use of standard gp tools .",
    "the idea is to lower bound @xmath95 by a monomial @xmath109 , i.e.  upper bound @xmath108 by the monomial @xmath110 ( since the inverse of a monomial is still a monomial ) @xcite .",
    "let @xmath111 be the monomial terms in the posynomial @xmath112 .",
    "the choice of the lower bound relies on the fact that an arithmetic mean is greater or equal to the geometric mean .",
    "hence , @xmath113 , where @xmath114 and @xmath115 . since @xmath116 we can replace ( in a conservative way ) inequality @xmath107 by @xmath117 . for a given choice of @xmath118 , problem - is now replaced by the standard gp @xmath119 that can be solved using existing software , e.g.  cvx @xcite .",
    "it is important to note that the tightness of the upper bound heavily depends on the choice of @xmath118 .",
    "following @xcite , an iterative procedure can be used where at each iteration the standard gp - is solved for an updated set of @xmath118 . assuming a feasible set of magnitude @xmath120 at iteration @xmath121 , compute @xmath122 @xmath123 .",
    "then solve problem - to obtain @xmath124 .",
    "repeat the iterations till convergence .    as noted in @xcite ,",
    "since the original problem is nonconvex , the final solution is not guaranteed to be the global optimum .",
    "we now evaluate the performance gain of the optimized adaptive waveform versus two baselines : a non - adaptive waveform not relying on csit and an adaptive waveform relying on csit but not requiring the optimization of section [ section_waveform ] .",
    "a suitable choice of non - adaptive waveform for single antenna wpt was shown in @xcite to exhibit high papr .",
    "it was suggested to choose an in - phase multisine excitation with uniform power allocation .",
    "we therefore choose the non - adaptive baseline waveform as @xmath125 and @xmath126 @xmath88 .",
    "the adaptive baseline waveform is chosen as a matched filter ( mf ) allocating power to all sinewaves but proportionally to the channel strength , i.e.  @xmath127 and @xmath128 with @xmath129 a constant to guarantee the power normalization .",
    "hence the difference between the optimized waveform and the one based on mf lies in a different choice of amplitudes .",
