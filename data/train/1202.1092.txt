    "the year 2012 is notable for both the journal and one of us for , in the months ahead , both tca and pmwg will achieve their half - centuries .",
    "it is inevitable and desirable that such occasions lead to retrospection , for it is often by looking backwards that we can perceive most clearly the way ahead .",
    "thus , as we ruminate on the things that we ought not to have done , we also dream of the things that we ought now to do .",
    "the final decade of the 20th century witnessed a major revolution in quantum chemistry , as the subject progressed from an esoteric instrument of an erudite cognoscenti to a commonplace tool of the chemical proletariat .",
    "the fuel for this revolution was the advent of density functional theory ( dft ) @xcite models and software that were sufficiently accurate and user - friendly to save the experimental chemist some time .",
    "these days , dft so dominates the popular perception of molecular orbital calculations that many non - specialists now regard the two as synonymous .    in principle , dft is founded in the hohenberg - kohn theorem @xcite but , in practice , much of its success can be traced to the similarity between the electron density in a molecule and the electron density in a hypothetical substance known as the uniform electron gas ( ueg ) or jellium @xcite .",
    "the idea  the local density approximation ( lda )  is attractively simple : if we know the properties of jellium , we can understand the electron cloud in a molecule by dividing it into tiny chunks of density and treating each as a piece of jellium .",
    "the good news is that the properties of jellium are known from near - exact quantum monte carlo calculations @xcite .",
    "such calculations are possible because jellium is characterized by just a _ single _",
    "parameter @xmath0 , the electron density .",
    "the bad news is that jellium has an infinite number of electrons in an infinite volume and this unboundedness renders it , in some respects , a poor model for the electrons in molecules .",
    "indeed , the simple lda described above predicts bond energies that are much too large and this led many chemists in the 1970s to dismiss dft as a quantitatively worthless theory .",
    "most of the progress since those dark days has resulted from concocting ingenious corrections for jellium s deficiencies .",
    "for example , significant improvements in accuracy can be achieved by using both the density @xmath3 and its gradient @xmath4 , an approach called gradient - corrected dft @xcite .",
    "even better results can be achieved by including a fraction of hartree - fock exchange ( yielding hybrid methods @xcite ) or higher derivatives of @xmath3 ( leading to meta - ggas @xcite ) .",
    "however , notwithstanding the impressive progress since the 1970s , modern dft approximations still exhibit fundamental deficiencies in large systems @xcite , conjugated molecules @xcite , charge - transfer excited states @xcite , dispersion - stabilized systems @xcite , systems with fractional spin or charge @xcite , isodesmic reactions @xcite and elsewhere . because dft is in principle an exact theory , many of these problems",
    "can be traced ultimately to the use of jellium as a reference system and the _ ad hoc _ corrections that its use subsequently necessitates .",
    "it is not a good idea to build one s house on sand !    in an attempt to avoid some of the weaknesses of jellium - based dft , we have invented and explored an alternative paradigm called intracule functional theory ( ift ) @xcite . in this approach , the one - electron density @xmath3 is abandoned in favour of two - electron variables ( such as the interelectronic distance @xmath5 ) and we have discovered that the latter offer an efficient and accurate route to the calculation of molecular energies @xcite .",
    "nonetheless , ift is not perfect and has shortcomings that are complementary to those of dft . as a result",
    ", one should seek to combine the best features of each , to obtain an approach superior to both .",
    "that is the goal of the present work and we will use atomic units throughout this article .",
    "in recent research , we were led to consider the behavior of electrons that are confined to the surface of a ball .",
    "this work yielded a number of unexpected discoveries @xcite but the one of relevance here is that such systems provide a beautiful new family of uniform electron gases ( see also @xcite ) .",

    "it implies that the years of effort that have been expended in calculating the properties of jellium do _ not _ provide us with a complete picture of homogeneous electron gases . on the contrary , although they inform us in detail about the _ infinite _ uniform electron gas , they tell us very little about the properties of finite electron gases .    in a nutshell",

    "the discovery that uniform electron gases are characterized by _ two _ parameters ( @xmath0 and @xmath1 ) has many ramifications but one of the most obvious is that the foundations of the venerable local density approximation need to be rebuilt .",
    "the traditional lda writes the correlation energy of a molecular system as @xmath133 thereby assuming that the contribution from each point @xmath134 depends only on the one - electron density @xmath3 at that point .",

    "how can we find the new density functional @xmath136 ?",
    "one could take an empirical approach but that is an overused option within the dft community @xcite and we feel that it is more satisfactory to derive it from the uniform electron gas . as we show in section [ subsec : hfcalcs ] , it turns out that it is easy to compute the exact values of @xmath105 , @xmath106 , @xmath107 and @xmath96 for any @xmath27-spherium or @xmath27-glomium atom and , therefore , if one knew the exact wavefunctions and energies of @xmath27-spherium and @xmath27-glomium for a wide range of @xmath27 and @xmath69 , one could extract the exact kohn - sham correlation energies @xmath137 and determine the exact dependence of these on @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "accordingly , we propose to embark on a comprehensive study of @xmath27-spherium and @xmath27-glomium atoms , in order eventually to liberate the lda from jellium s yoke through a process of radical generalization .",
    "the results of these spherium and glomium calculations will generalize the known properties of jellium , because we have shown that the energies of @xmath27-spherium and @xmath27-glomium approach those of 2d jellium and 3d jellium , as @xmath27 becomes large .",
    "in the remaining sections , we will confine our attention to the ( two - dimensional ) @xmath27-spherium atoms .",

    "_  ccsd , ccsdt , ccsdtq ,  ) probably converges much better than the mp@xmath34 series , and this should certainly be explored in the future , but we suspect that it will nonetheless perform poorly in the large-@xmath69 , small-@xmath0 systems where static correlation dominates dynamic correlation @xcite and the single - configuration hf wavefunction is an inadequate starting point .",
    "[ [ explicitly - correlated - methods ] ] explicitly - correlated methods @xcite + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    the ci , mp and cc approaches expand the exact wavefunction as a linear combination of determinants and it has been known since the early days of quantum mechanics that this ansatz struggles to describe the interelectronic cusps @xcite .",
    "the r12 methods overcome this deficiency by explicitly including terms that are linear in @xmath167 in the wavefunction , and converge much more rapidly as the basis set is enlarged but , unfortunately , they also require a number of non - standard integrals .",
    "if these integrals are not computed exactly , they are approximated by resolutions in an auxiliary basis set . in either case , the computer implementation is complicated .",
    "it is possible that the unusually high symmetry of @xmath27-spherium makes it well suited to correlation methods that are not based on the hf orbitals .",
    "we now consider two of these .",
    "[ [ iterative - complement - interaction - ici - method ] ] iterative complement interaction ( ici ) method @xcite + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    in this approach , the schrdinger equation itself is used to generate a large set of @xmath34-electron functions that are then linearly combined to approximate the true wavefunction .",
    "it has been spectacularly successful in systems with a small number of electrons , but has not yet been applied to systems as large as 2- or 3-spherium ( with 18 and 32 electrons , respectively ) .    [",

    ", the schrdinger equation is transformed into a diffusion equation in imaginary time @xmath168 and , in the limit as @xmath169 , the ground state energy is approached .",
    "unfortunately , to be practically feasible , the method normally requires that the wavefunction s nodes be known and , despite some recent progress @xcite , the node problem remains unsolved .",
    "the quality of the trial wavefunction and finite - size errors are other potential restrictions @xcite .",
    "the discovery @xcite that the schrdinger equation for 0-spherium ( and 0-glomium ) is exactly solvable for each of its eigenradii is extremely helpful , for it allows us to generate the exact energies @xmath104 and resulting kohn - sham correlation energies @xmath95 for the first four atoms in table [ tab : results2 ] , without needing to perform any of the correlated calculations described above . however , these are the easiest cases , the `` low - hanging fruit '' so to speak , and there remain large gaps in the table .",
    "we could have filled these gaps with rough estimates of the exact energies but we prefer to leave them empty , to emphasize that there is much to do in this field and to challenge the correlation experts in the wavefunction and density functional communities to address these beautifully simple systems .",
    "once this is done , the data in the final three columns of table [ tab : results2 ] will provide the ingredients for the construction of a new correlation density functional @xmath170 that will be exact for all @xmath27-spherium atoms and for 2d jellium .",
    "finally , of course , an analogous strategy will yield a new functional that is exact for all @xmath27-glomium atoms and for 3d jellium .",
    "we will recommend that these functionals replace the lda correlation functionals that are now being used .",
    "all uniform electron gases are equal , but some are more equal than others ."
