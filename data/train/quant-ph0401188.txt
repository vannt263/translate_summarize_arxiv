    "in this short note we report on some new results and present some thoughts on two well - known effects arising from the interaction between a moving atom or detector with a quantum field . the casimir - polder force",
    "@xcite is a retardation force on the atom due to the dressing of the atomic ground state by the vacuum electromagnetic field in the presence of a boundary ( e.g. , a mirror or a cavity ) .",
    "we set forth to improve on existing calculations by treating the mutual influence of the atom and the ( constrained ) field in a self - consistent way .",
    "this is in order to maximally preserve the coherence of the combined system , which is a highly desirable if not critically demanded criteria for quantum computer designs .",
    "since a self - consistent treatment requires backreaction considerations , the atom s motion should be included to account for the full effect of the field on the atom .",
    "for an atom moving adiabatically , perpendicular to a mirror , our recent result finds a coherent retardation correction up to twice the stationary value  @xcite .    the unruh effect @xcite described colloquially states that a uniformly accelerated detector  ( uad ) feels hot at the unruh temperature .",
    "there are at least three classes of detection schemes proposed .",
    "one based on charged particles in linear accelerators purports to measure at a distance the radiation emitted from the uad  @xcite .",
    "researchers have commonly agreed that a uniformly accelerated detector does not emit radiation .",
    "( see , e.g. ,  @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "if there were emitted radiation it would have to be from nonuniform acceleration and treated by nonequilibrium quantum field theory concepts and techniques  @xcite .",
    "but these are not the unruh effect .",
    "detection of unruh effect in storage rings has earlier been proposed  @xcite .",
    "even though acceleration in the circular case shares some features with linear acceleration which is what unruh effect entails , there are basic differences between these two cases . for one , in circular motion acceleration comes from changes in the direction , not in the speed .",
    "controversies of its nature and viability remain  @xcite .",
    "recently a detection scheme has been proposed by scully _",
    "@xcite involving the injection of accelerating atoms into a microwave or optical cavity .",
    "it is this scheme which we wish to discuss here .",
    "we first identify the main working parts in this scheme and then analyze their effects and relevance to the unruh effect .",
    "the main factors we shall consider here are a ) the effect of cavity fields on the accelerating atom in the emission of photons and b ) the effect of sudden switching on of the atom - field interaction from the injection of atoms into the cavity . for the cavity factor",
    "we find that a thermal distribution of the photons in the cavity should not be identified as a manifestation of the unruh effect . as for the sudden switch - on effect ,",
    "photons are produced from the nonadiabatic amplification of vacuum fluctuations ( similar to cosmological particle creation  @xcite ) , but not from the atom s uniform acceleration ( analogous to hawking radiance in black holes  @xcite ) .",
    "note that in both effects there are three dynamical variables : the internal degrees of freedom ( dof ) of a detector  a two level system , the external degrees of freedom  the center of mass  ( com ) of the detector / atom in motion , and the quantum field ( scalar or electromagnetic ) under some constrained condition imposed by the presence of the mirror or cavity .",
    "( one can easily extend this class of problems to cases where the mirror is in motion @xcite giving rise to dynamical casimir effects @xcite and analogs of hawking effect @xcite in quantum black holes . ) in casimir - polder effect it is the external dof ",
    "the com  of the atom interacting with the field modes altered by the mirror which are of interest , whereas in the unruh effect , as the trajectory is prescribed , it is the internal dof of the detector / atom and the field correlations which are of interest .",
    "a more obvious difference is , of course , the atom in casimir - polder undergoes nonrelativistic motion , whereas it is the uniform acceleration engendering an event horizon which gives the distinct thermal feature in the unruh radiation . but ultimately these are only different regimes and manifestations of the same set of problems related to the kinematic and boundary effects on the quantum vacuum .",
    "we deliberately bring these two effects into the same discussion so as to stimulate stronger cross fertilization between these two apparently disparate fields , namely , quantum / atom optics and quantum field theory in curved spacetime @xcite .",
    "it is the belief of one of us that many fundamental effects in the latter discovered theoretically in the 70 s may find verifications in the experimental schemes of the former .",
    "what is more interesting is that there is plenty of room in their intersection for asking new sets of questions pertaining to the ( nonequilibrium ) statistical mechanical properties of the quantum vacuum as influenced by moving atoms , detectors , mirrors or background fields such as vacuum viscosity due to particle creation @xcite , vacuum friction due to atom motion @xcite , quantum noise under exponential red - shifting @xcite , field correlations in spacetimes with event horizons @xcite and entanglement and teleportation with non - inertial observers @xcite .",
    "this paper is evenly divided into two parts : sections  2 ,  3 deal with the correction to the casimir - polder effect due to atom motion , sec .",
    "4 summarizes the main features of unruh effect , sec .",
    "5 discusses the scheme of scully _ et al _ for the detection of unruh effect by accelerating atoms in a cavity .",
    ".5 cm    * part i : casimir - polder effect *    .5 cm    recent experiments  @xcite have reported on the measurement of the casimir - polder  ( c - p ) retardation force  @xcite , which is a retardation force arising from the quantum modification of the electrostatic attraction of a polarizable atom to its image in the wall .        in its usual interpretation",
    "the retardation force arises from the dressing of the atomic ground state by the vacuum electromagnetic field  ( emf ) in the presence of a boundary . with this interaction , the ground state of the combined atom - emf system",
    "is no longer a product of the separate free ground states , but is instead an entangled atom - emf state .",
    "the retardation force originates from the quantum correlation between two interacting systems ( or , if one of them is of less concern in the observation , one system s  such as the atom , and its environment e  the quantum field ) .",
    "another manifestation is colored noise from the coarse - grained quantum fields . to follow the quantum correlations between s and e , we need to adopt a method which can maximally preserve the quantum coherence in treating the s and e interaction consistently .",
    "the state - of - the - art derivation  @xcite of the casimir - polder retardation force is by calculating the gradient of a spatially dependent dressed ground state .",
    "here we report on a rederivation  @xcite of the c - p retardation force given in terms of the recoil associated with the emission and reabsorption of virtual photons .",
    "while the gradient calculation of the force assumes a stationary atom , our method treats an atom that moves adiabatically .",
    "our result in the stationary atom limit is in exact agreement with the casimir - polder force . in the case of an adiabatically moving atom",
    ", we find a coherent retardation correction up to twice the stationary value .",
    "the additional correction due to atomic motion can be understood as indicating that the dressed ground states for stationary and moving atoms are not the same , the difference arising from the doppler shift of the emf modes with respect to the conducting wall .",
    "that is , a moving atom is in a doppler shifted vacuum , so its dressed ground state is altered from the stationary one .",
    "in addition , what is usually pictured physically in terms of a gradient force is explained here in terms of the recoil associated with emission and absorption of virtual photons .",
    "this provides a quantum field theory interpretation of the dipole force  @xcite    this work is relevant to applications in which atoms are trapped on the order of a resonant atomic wavelength near a surface .",
    "examples include evanescent wave gravito - optical  @xcite , microlens array  @xcite , and magnetic chip trapping  @xcite .",
    "recent experiments have demonstrated the measurable effects of retardation on atomic motion near a surface  @xcite .",
    "those effects will become more important as such applications become more refined .",
    "that is especially true when precision control over the motion of atoms is needed , such as the implementation of two - qubit gates in amo quantum computer designs .",
    "we assume an atom placed near a conducting wall is initially in a factorizable state with the emf vacuum .",
    "the combined system evolves according under the minimal coupling qed hamiltonian in the dipole approximation , but without the rotating wave approximation @xmath0 the operators @xmath1 are the up and down operators of the atomic qubit and @xmath2 is the atomic transition frequency .",

    "the mass of the atom has been taken to infinity and its extension to a point , while finite terms are retained to their effect on the dynamics .",
    "the total force on a stationary atom is given by the sum of the correction force , while setting @xmath24 , and the electrostatic force .",
    "the stationary atom force exhibits a transient behavior when the atom first `` sees '' itself in the wall .",
    "then , on a timescale of several atom - wall round trip light travel times it asymptotes to the following constant steady state value @xmath25 from eq .",
    "( [ stationary force ] ) the potential which a stationary atom feels is easily found to be @xmath26 with asymptotic limits @xmath27 which exactly reproduces the results from the energy gradient approaches  @xcite .",

    "( [ general force ] ) by applying a separation of short time scale dynamics from long time scale dynamics analogous to standard methods for determining the dipole force on an atom in a laser beam  @xcite . there , assuming that the atom s position is constant on short timescales , the optical bloch equations are solved for the steady state values of the internal state density matrix elements . on long time",
    "- scales the matrix elements are replaced by their steady state values and put into the heisenberg equation of motion for the atomic com momentum .",
    "such a procedure is justified when the internal and external dynamics evolve on vastly different timescales .",
    "the analogous separation here will be of the short timescale describing the self - dressing of the atom - emf system and the long timescale describing the motion of the atom .",
    "after evaluating adiabatically and combining the retardation correction force with the electrostatic force , the atom - wall force is found to be @xmath28 the first term is the stationary atom - wall force and the second term is a residual force which pulls the atom back to its original point of release .",
    "the force can easily be turned into the potential which the atom feels : @xmath29 since the first term in the potential is the stationary atom - wall potential , in the regions near and far from the wall it will have the expected inverse powers of distance dependence , as shown in eq .",
    "( [ stationary limits ] ) .",
    "the second term is the residual potential due to the motion .      in the traditional ( energy gradient ) approach",
    ", one interprets the force between a polarizable atom and a wall as arising from the lamb shift in the atomic ground state energy .",
    "spatial variation of the ground state energy is expected to generate a force which pushes the atom perpendicular to the wall , but the mechanism for such a force is not given explicitly .",
    "our approach provides an interpretation of how a net force arises from the emission - reabsorption processes in the presence of a boundary .",
    "it goes beyond lamb shift calculations in that it incorporates the effect of slow atomic motion .",
    "the extra correction from our coherent qed calculation makes a verifiable prediction .",
    "the alteration of the force has its best chance of being measured in experiments involving cold atoms bouncing off the evanescent field of a laser beam totally internally reflected in a crystal . in those experiments the laser is blue detuned , which imposes a repulsive potential to counter the attractive potential of the wall thus creating a barrier for cold atoms moving toward the crystal to bounce against . as the intensity of the evanescent laser field",
    "is lowered the height of the barrier is lowered . at some threshold value",
    "the barrier height will fall below the classical tunnelling height and no atoms will be reflected .",
    "the van  der  waals , casimir - polder , and our coherent qed ( corrected casimir - polder ) forces all give different predictions for that threshold laser intensity .",
    "the calculations done here are for a perfect conductor , not a dielectric boundary , so the modifications predicted here should not be applied directly to the case of a dielectric boundary .",
    "however , a general statement can be made that a coherent qed correction will cause a lowered prediction for the threshold laser power , since it will tend to decrease the atom - wall attraction .",

    "unruh effect attests that a particle detector following a uniformly accelerated trajectory   in minkowski spacetime perceives the vacuum of the field as a thermal bath .",

    "indeed , for the model above , the self - consistent dynamics of the detector and the field , including their interaction , can be solved exactly .",
    "one finds that indeed the expectation value of the stress tensor operator for the field vanishes .",
    "however , even though there is no flux of energy emitted from the detector , the vacuum polarization is altered due to the emission and reabsorption of virtual particles by the accelerated detector .",
    "this can be verified by computing the two - point quantum correlation function of the field ( which is still lorentz invariant ) and comparing to the case without detector ( the correlation function for the free field in the vacuum state )  @xcite .",
    "there are many subtle points underlying the absence of emitted radiation or energy flux in the field from a uad .",
    "unruh effect is predicated upon the condition that the uniform acceleration goes on for an indefinite amount of time , which requires an agent doing work on it .",
    "if the detector has been accelerating for a finite duration  @xcite or if the interaction lasts for a finite period of time but switched on adiabatically  @xcite there will be radiation emitted .",

    "the emission coefficient corresponds to the so - called counter - rotating terms that would have been discarded in the rotating wave approximation  ( rwa ) .",
    "if we just consider the first integral in equation  ( [ i1 ] ) , we get an exponentially suppressed ratio for the transition coefficients : @xmath109 .",
    "this corresponds to the case in which the atom - field interaction has been present for a long time in the past . on the other hand , when the second integral in equation  ( [ i1 ] ) is also included , which corresponds to switching on the interaction instantaneously at @xmath86 ( the time at which the atom is injected into the cavity ) , the situation changes drastically .",
    "in particular , if we consider the regime @xmath110 , the ratio becomes @xmath111 , which implies an enhancement of many orders of magnitude for realistic values of @xmath112 , @xmath113 and @xmath14  ) it follows straightforwardly that the conditions @xmath114 and @xmath115 imply that the size of the cavity should be much larger than the wavelength of the cavity mode . ] .",
    "it is this enhancement factor which scully _ et al _ claim to give a better sensitivity in the detection of the radiation which they regard as due to the accelerated motion .",
    "we will see that this process is not responsible for the unruh effect .",
    "we focus here just on two factors , that related to the presence of cavity , and the effect of sudden switching on of the interaction .",
    "[ [ effect - of - cavity ] ] effect of cavity + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    the unruh effect corresponds to the fact that a uniformly accelerated particle detector ( the two - level atom in this case ) perceives the vacuum fluctuations as a thermal bath .",
    "the presence of the cavity is going to change that situation because , in contrast to free space , the mode spectrum of the electromagnetic fields inside the cavity is no longer lorentz invariant .",
    "therefore , the effect of the vacuum fluctuations on the accelerated atom ( characterized by the noise and dissipation kernels introduced above ) will not be stationary and can not correspond to a thermal bath .",
    "we emphasize again that , strictly speaking , the unruh effect refers to the thermal bath perceived by the detector , not to possible radiation emitted by the detector from the point of view of inertial observers .",
    "in fact , as discussed in the prior section , in free space ( and under some idealized conditions ) , there is no real radiation emitted by the accelerated detector , i.e. no energy flux , just a modification of the vacuum polarization .    in the scheme of scully _",
    "@xcite , briefly summarized in the previous subsection , there is some probability for the cavity mode to become excited when an atom is accelerated inside the cavity .",
    "if the atom - field interaction is somehow switched on adiabatically , the ratio of the emission and absorption coefficients is exponentially suppressed by the boltzmann factor for a temperature @xmath116 , which coincides with the temperature of the thermal bath perceived by a uad in free space with the same acceleration .",
    "the reason for such a coincidence can be understood qualitatively as follows : in the `` golden rule '' limit ( limit of large @xmath74 with finite @xmath117 ) one can show that the ratio of excitation and de - excitation of a two - level detector with characteristic frequency @xmath113 induced by each inertial mode in free space is given by the same boltzmann factor @xmath118 .",
    "nevertheless , the thermal distribution of photons in the cavity is not in one - to - one correspondence with the unruh effect for several reasons .",
    "first , the atoms accelerated inside the cavity are not in thermal equilibrium because they do not perceive the vacuum fluctuations in the cavity as a thermal bath , as explained above .",
    "second , the thermal population of photons in the cavity results from a statistically independent events of injecting a sufficient number of atoms at random times .",
    "third , an analogous thermal population can be obtained even by injecting atoms with constant velocity , because the sudden switching on of interaction can produce such a result , as described below .",
    "[ [ effect - of - sudden - switch - on ] ] effect of sudden switch - on + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    the fact that the atoms are injected into the cavity at some initial time is effectively equivalent to suddenly switching on the atom - field interaction . in that case , the ratio of emission and absorption is enhanced .",
    "in particular , in the regime @xmath110 , it is given by @xmath111 .",
    "as recognized in reference  @xcite , this is entirely due to the nonadiabatic switching on of the interaction .",
    "what is more relevant to the issues at hand is that with non - adiabatic switch - on , the acceleration no longer plays a crucial role . indeed , in that regime the emission rate is @xmath119 and is thus independent of the acceleration .",
    "it is true that the absorption coefficient still depends on the acceleration , which is a consequence of the resonance when the increasingly redshifted frequency @xmath120 of the cavity mode as perceived by the atom coincides with the frequency @xmath113 of the atom , but this is not essential .",
    "this important point can be illustrated by considering the case in which the atoms are injected with constant velocity into the cavity . as mentioned in reference  @xcite ,",
    "the ratio becomes then @xmath121 where @xmath74 is the time that the atom spends in the cavity and @xmath122 is the doppler shifted frequency of the co - propagating cavity mode ( the velocity sign should be changed for the anti - propagating mode ) .    due to",
    "space restriction we can only raise two issues in this detection scheme .",
    "even though this detection scheme , like a few earlier ones proposed , does not capture the essence of unruh effect , it is still a good intellectual exercise to expound the physics of the core processes in the proposals .",
    "this is because unruh effect brings up interesting new issues related to the vacuum fluctuations , polarizations and energy flux in the quantum field , as influenced by different motional states of the atoms or detectors .",
