    "if the matter moves in radiation fields , it absorbs the radiation anisotropically in comoving frame and then reemits the radiation isotropically , so that the gas is subject to drag force in proportion to @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the peculiar velocity and @xmath3 is the radiation energy density @xcite .",
    "this effect is known as the radiation drag .",
    "a famous example of radiation drag is the poynting - robertson effect on a dust grain in the solar system @xcite , where , due to the angular momentum loss by the radiation drag , a grain spirals into the sun .",
    "the importance of radiation drag has been considered for other various issues in astrophysics . in the epochs shortly after the recombination , the cosmic background radiation can exert strong drag force through electron scattering , which is called the compton drag . @xcite",
    "considered the possibility that the compton drag could extract angular momentum from an early formed object and build up a massive black hole . in this context , @xcite performed numerical simulations , using a three - dimensional hydrodynamics - dark - matter code , and found that the angular momentum extraction actually takes place efficiently at redshifts of @xmath4 , leading to the formation of massive black holes .",
    "the radiation drag induced mass accretion is also considered in a rotating gas disk immersed in the external radiation fields .",
    "cosmological accretion disks embedded in background radiation are extensively studied by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite . in relation to quasi - periodic phenomena in x - ray stars , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite",
    "examined the role of radiation ( compton ) drag exerted by the radiation fields of a central neutron star on the disk gas in the binary regime . @xcite proposed siphon processes in cataclysmic variables , where the evaporating gas from the disk surface infalls toward a central white dwarf because of radiation drag .",
    "@xcite investigated a steady accretion driven by the radiation of a central luminous object .",
    "also , in active galactic nuclei ( agns ) , the radiation drag may play an important role in some situations .",
    "@xcite proposed the starburst - induced fueling to an agn ( `` radiative avalanche '' ) , to relate the circumnuclear starburst with agn event .",
    "this model has been extended to more realistic versions @xcite .",
    "commonly , it was found that the surface layer of rotating gas irradiated by intensive starlight can lose the angular momentum by radiation drag , which results in an avalanche of the layer as an inevitable consequence .    the model of mass accretion induced by uniform background radiation",
    "is revitalized in galactic bulges , because bulge stars produce nearly uniform radiation fields .",
    "this can provide a possible way to cause the formation of a supermassive black hole ( smbh ) in a bulge .",
    "the recent observations have suggested that the mass of a smbh tightly correlates with the mass of the host bulge or the velocity dispersion of bulge stars @xcite .",
    "all of these correlations imply that the formation of a smbh is likely to be physically linked to the formation of a galactic bulge that harbors a smbh .",
    "@xcite considered the accretion of dusty gas driven via the radiation drag by bulge stars and constructed a quasar formation model .",
    "@xcite quantitatively clarified by radiative transfer calculations that the inhomogenity of dusty interstellar medium controls the efficiency of radiation drag , and found that , if surface gas layers are stripped effectively by the radiation drag from optically - thick dusty gas clouds and lose angular momentum , a sufficient amount of gas can accrete to form a smbh in realistic situations .",
    "the model of radiation drag - induced formation of smbh predicts the smbh - to - bulge mass relation to be 0.3 - 0.5@xmath5 , where @xmath5 is the fraction of @xmath6 liberated by hydrogen burning in stars .",
    "however , the processes of gas stripping by the radiation drag from an optically - thick cloud have not been elucidated in detail .",
    "the study requires a sophisticated numerical simulation with relativistic radiation hydrodynamics . in this paper",
    ", we perform a radiation hydrodynamic simulation with generalized coordinates for a gas cloud moving in radiation fields . through this simulation , we attempt to demonstrate the stripping efficiency and the time - scale of angular momentum loss .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ section-2 ] ,",
    "we present the model used in this work . in section [ section-3 ]",
    ", we describe the numerical treatment . in section [ section-4 ]",
    ", we show the numerical results on the flow patterns and then estimate the time - scale for momentum loss of the gas .",
    "section [ section-5 ] is devoted to conclusions .",
    "we suppose a simple situation that a spherical cold gas cloud moves in uniform radiation fields with a constant velocity . the gas cloud is assumed to have a uniform density distribution and to be in pressure balance with hot rarefied ambient gas . if there is relatively large velocity difference between the gas cloud and the ambient matter , the cloud surface layers are expected to be stripped by the ram pressure .",
    "the ram - pressure stripping itself does not extract angular momentum from the total system including the cloud and ambient matter .",
    "but , if the system is embedded in radiation fields , the optically - thin parts of the stripped gas can be subject to the radiation drag and lose angular momentum .",
    "this might provides a simple way to extract angular momentum from the interstellar medium . from a realistic point of view",
    ", however , the gas motion does not seem so simple .",
    "recent high resolution simulations on multiple supernova ( sn ) explosions in a star - forming galaxy @xcite have reveal that dense shells driven by sn hot bubbles undergo thermal instability and resultant cold clouds move together with ambient hot gas . here",
    ", we consider two cases ; one is a comoving case in which the stripping takes place solely by the radiation drag , and the other is a shear - flow case in which the radiation drag is partially coupled with the ram - pressure stripping .    the cloud temperature , mass , and radius are respectively assumed to be @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 , while the temperature of hot ambient matter is @xmath10 .",
    "we postulate the peculiar velocity @xmath11 of the cloud to be of the order of the virial velocity for a spheroidal galaxy with @xmath12 and @xmath13 : @xmath14 as for the radiation fields , the radiation energy density is estimated by the assumed total luminosity @xmath15 and galaxy size to be @xmath16 in this paper we assume the total luminosity to be @xmath17 .",
    "[ fig-1 ]    we use the two - dimensional generalized curvilinear coordinates as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig-1 ] .",
    "the number of grid points is @xmath18 .",
    "such coordinates allow us to take accurate boundary conditions for a spherical gas cloud and also to treat appropriately the flow of stripped gas on the right - hand side .",
    "the scale of computational domain is about @xmath19 .",
    "the gas cloud moves at a velocity @xmath20 along the @xmath21-axis in the radiation fields . here , to prevent the cloud from going out of the boundary with @xmath20",
    ", we make the galilean transformation by @xmath20 so that the cloud should stay at the origin if neither drag force nor ram pressure is exerted . in these coodinates , the surface of the cold gas",
    "is represented by a dash - dotted line in fig .",
    "[ fig-1 ] .",
    "the other regions are filled with the hot gas .",
    "the two - dimensional euler equations including the relativistic radiation drag term can be written in the conservation form as @xmath22 where @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 are respectively the following vectors , @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the density of the gas , @xmath29 and @xmath2 are respectively the @xmath21- and @xmath30- components of velocity , @xmath31 is the speed of light , and @xmath32 is the mass extinction coefficient due to dust opacity . in this work , we set @xmath33 by assumig the solar abundance and @xmath34 m dust grains ( e.g. see umemura et al .",
    "the pressure @xmath35 and the total energy per unit volume @xmath36 are related by the equation of state , @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the ratio of specific heats of the gas , which is chosen as @xmath39 . the radiation drag effect is taken into account by adding the term of @xmath26 .    to discretise the governing equation , eq ( [ eq-1 ] ) , the finite volume - approach is used , where the ausm - dv scheme is employed to obtain the numerical convective flux @xcite .",
    "the time integration of a set of equations is performed implicitly by a matrix free lu - sgs method @xcite .",
    "the optical depth at each point is evaluated by integrating the opacity along with a line drawn from the outer boundary to the coordinate origin .",
    "the distribution of the optical depth in the cloud at initial time is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig-2 ] .",
    "the optical depth at the center of cloud reaches above @xmath40 and the thickness of the optically - thin surface layer is @xmath41 of the cloud radius .",
    "we involve the radiation drag term if the optical depth is lower than unity , because no drag force works in optically - thick medium @xcite .    in order to demonstrate the validity of the present method for the optical depth estimation , we show the optical depth distributions on several snapshots of the dynamical evolution in fig . [ fig-3 ] .",
    "the dot - dashed semicircle shows the initial position of the cloud .",
    "the light gray or charcoal gray regions show the domain where the optical depth is from @xmath42 to @xmath43 or above @xmath43 , respectively .",
    "the optically - thin regions are properly detected with tracing the dynamical evolution .",
    "the gas in charcoal gray regions is impervious to the radiation drag .",
    "however , there is limitation for applying this method .",
    "if the whole region of the cold gas deviates from the coordinate origin , the estimate of optical depth would not be correct .",
    "threfore , at this time , the estimate of the radiation drag is not always accurate . in section [ section-4 ]",
    "we will be back to this point .",
    "[ fig-2 ]    [ fig-3 ]",
    "the stripping purely by the radiation drag is demonstrated in a comoving case , where no relative velocity is present between the gas cloud and the ambient matter .",
    "the time variation of density distributions is depicted by four snapshots in fig .",
    "[ fig-4 ] , and that of velocity fields is shown only for optically - thin cold gas in fig .",
    "[ fig-5 ] , where the density contours are also displayed .",
    "we can see in fig .",
    "[ fig-4 ] that the surface layers of the gas cloud are stripped by radiation drag and drifted to the right - hand side .",
    "since we are observing the phenomena in the coordinates moving to the left at the velocity @xmath20 , the gas drifted to the right is actually left behind by the radiation drag .",
    "it is noted that this stripping is obviously different from the ram - pressure stripping in that it occurs also behind the cloud in the downstream .",
    "the left - hand side of the optically - thin surface layer pushes the whole region to the right by the radiation drag .",
    "the velocity fields in fig .",
    "[ fig-5 ] show that the optically - thin surface layers move round the surface of the cloud .",
    "a part of the gas reaching the @xmath21-axis is accelerated toward the right direction along the @xmath21-axis .",
    "this means that the stripped gas slows down by the radiation drag .    in the later phase ( @xmath44yr ) , the stripped gas is trailed by the radiation drag , because the cold gas is confined by the ambient hot gas .",
    "when the stripped gas reaches the @xmath21-axis , it splits into the left and right under the influence of external pressure .",
    "the radiation drag is not exerted on the gas splitting into the left owing to the large optical depth and therefore left there in the present galilean transformed coordinates , while the radiation drag works to decelerate the optically - thin gas splitting to the right and eventually produces the gas flows to the right .",
    "as mentioned before , when the whole region of the cloud deviates from the origin , the present estimate of the optical depth in the left - hand side of the cloud becomes inaccurate .",
    "however , as far as the gas drifted to the right is concerned , the optical depth is still properly estimated .",
    "hence , the trailing flow is thought to be real .",
    "[ fig-4 ]    [ fig-5 ]      here , we show the results for a shear - flow case in which the velocity difference between the gas cloud and the ambient matter is assumed to be @xmath45 , corresponding to @xmath46 in mach number .",
    "the numerical results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig-6 ] and fig .",
    "[ fig-7 ] respectively for the density distributions and the velocity fields for the optically - thin cold gas .",
    "the snapshots of the density contours in fig .",
    "[ fig-6 ] show that the deformation of the gas cloud grows with time . in this case",
    ", the ram - pressure stripping occurs simultaneously with the stripping driven by the radiation drag .",
    "however , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig-6 ] ( d ) , the gas drifted to the right eventually flows along with the @xmath21-axis .",
    "this flow pattern is similar to that in the case without the ram - pressure induced deformation .",
    "the snapshots of the velocity fields show that the rightward velocities of the optically - thin surface layers increase with the deformation .",
    "our numerical method allows us to trace the optically - thin surface even in such strong deformation of the cold gas .",
    "the optically - thin gas is subject to the radiation drag and makes a trailing flow , similar to the case without the ram pressure .",
    "[ fig-6 ]    [ fig-7 ]      the radiation drag works on both radial and azimuthal components of gas velocity , in proportion to each component . in a pure rotating system",
    ", the reduction only for azimuthal velocity leads to the angular momentum loss .",
    "but , in a chaotic system like a bulge under starbursts , the reduction of random velocities means , on average , the decrease of an azimuthal component of velocity and therefore angular momentum . in other words , the gas even in non - radial motion can fall onto the center if the momentum of the gas is strongly reduced . hence , here we consider the momentum loss in the present simulations .",
    "the momentum of optically - thin cold gas in the @xmath21-direction , @xmath47 , is defined as @xmath48 in fig .",
    "[ fig-8 ] , the time variation of momentum is shown in units of the initial momentum .",
    "the solid line is the evolution in a comoving case , while the broken line is in a shear - flow case .",
    "a dotted line shows the level of @xmath49 reduction .",
    "[ fig-8 ]    from this result , we can evaluate the momentum loss time - scale , which is defined by the @xmath49 reduction of momentum .",
    "the time - scale for a comoving case is @xmath50 , and that for a shear - flow case is @xmath51 . in the shear - flow case",
    ", the surface gas of the cloud is stripped also by the ram pressure and is rarefied .",
    "resultantly , the fraction of optically - thin gas increases compared to the pure radiation - drag case , so that the momentum is extracted more efficiently than the comoving case .",
    "the time - scale of angular momentum extraction is analytically estimated by @xcite to give @xmath52 where @xmath53 , @xmath54 , and @xmath55 are the dust - to - gas mass ratio , the grain radius , and the density of solid material within the grain , respectively .",
    "it is found that the numerically obtained time - scale is in a good agreement with the analytic estimate , although the numerical one is slightly shorter .",
    "we have performed the radiation - hydrodynamic simulation for a gas cloud moving at a constant velocity in uniform radiation fields , with focusing attention on the radiation drag as well as the coupling effect with the ram pressure .",
    "the obtained results are summarized as follows :    ( 1 ) : :    in a comoving case , the stripping occurs purely through the radiation    drag .",
    "all the optically - thin surface layers are stripped from an    optically - thick gas cloud , in contrast to the pure ram - pressure    stripping .",
    "finally , a trailing flow behind the cloud forms .",
    "( 2 ) : :    in a shear - flow case , the radiation drag - induced stripping occurs    simultaneously with the ram - pressure stripping .",
    "but , the eventual flow    pattern for optically - thin gas is similar to the pure radiation drag    case .",
    "( 3 ) : :    the momentum loss time - scale for the stripped gas is on the order of    @xmath0 years under intensive radiation fields expected    in an early evolutionary phase of a massive bulge . the time - scale is    shorter for a shear - flow case with the aid of the ram pressure .",
    "the    present time - scale is basically in a good agreement with an analytic    estimation for angular momentum extraction time - scale .",
    "it is demonstrated that the radiation drag by bulge stars is an effective mechanism to extract angular momentum from interstellar cloud in a galactic bulge system .",
    "this mechanism allows the mass accretion onto the galactic center , possibly leading to the formation of a supermassive black hole @xcite .    in the present work ,",
    "we have ignored the effect of self - gravity .",
    "the self - gravity is likely to be important for a cloud with @xmath8 assumed in the present paper .",
    "thus , an assumption of a uniform cloud may not be realistic , and instead the density distribution of a cold gas in gravitational equilibrium should be considered . in this case , the outside of a gas cloud could be rarefied and the domain of the optically - thin layers increases .",
    "consequently , the efficiency of the radiation drag might be enhanced . to investigate the details of the stripping and momentum loss in such a case",
    "will be significant in the future work .",
    "we thank n. kawakatu for many useful comments .",
