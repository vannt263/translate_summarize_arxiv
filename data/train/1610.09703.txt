    "the control specifications of modern industrial systems are becoming successively more and more complex ; in addition to the traditional requirements of achieving stabilization , tracking and possibly some form of optimized behavior , contemporary specifications may include safety constraints , human interference , temporal logic statements , and start - up procedures , among others . in the 1990 s ,",
    "hybrid systems were introduced , in part , in order to provide a formalized system theoretic framework to handle such complex specifications @xcite .",
    "the reason for this is that hybrid systems combine both continuous dynamics and discrete events , and so they provide a suitable framework for the development of formal verification and synthesis methods for achieving complex specifications .",
    "recently , special interest has been given to an important class of hybrid systems , namely piecewise affine ( pwa ) hybrid systems @xcite , since this class of systems has desirable control theoretic properties which hold when simple verifiable conditions are satisfied , can approximate nonlinear systems with arbitrary accuracy @xcite , and can be easily identified from experimental data @xcite .",
    "interesting applications of pwa control systems can be found in @xcite .",
    "a pwa hybrid system is typically expressed by a discrete automaton @xcite such that inside each discrete mode of the automaton , the system is described by affine dynamics defined on a full - dimensional polytope .",
    "if the state trajectory of the continuous affine dynamics reaches a prescribed exit facet of the polytope , the pwa hybrid system is transferred to a new discrete mode , in which it evolves according to new affine dynamics in a successive polytope , and so on .",
    "hence , the study of pwa hybrid systems at the continuous level reduces to the study of affine dynamics on full - dimensional polytopes @xcite .    in @xcite",
    ", we introduce the study of the in - block controllability ( ibc ) of affine systems on polytopes . in particular , for a given affine system and a given full - dimensional polytope @xmath0 , we study whether all the states in the interior of @xmath0 are mutually accessible through its interior by applying uniformly bounded control inputs .",
    "the motivation behind the ibc notion is that it formalizes controllability under safety state constraints .",
    "moreover , we show in @xcite that if one constructs a special partition / cover of the state space of pwa hybrid systems / nonlinear systems , in which each region satisfies the ibc property , then one can systematically study controllability properties and build hierarchical control structures of these complex systems .",
    "these hierarchical structures are typically used for synthesizing correct - by - design controllers enforcing formal logic specifications @xcite .",
    "one advantage of the ibc hierarchical structures is that they take into account the fact that different states in a partition / cover region typically need different inputs to be steered to neighborhood regions , possibly over different time horizons .",
    "thus , the ibc hierarchical methods do not require the partition / cover regions to be of very small size , they end up with reasonable number of regions in the partitions / covers , and hence , they may have good potential to be extended to high - dimensional systems .",
    "furthermore , the ibc notion is also useful in the context of optimal control problems @xcite .",
    "in particular , if it is required to find an optimal trajectory connecting two states in the interior of a polytope representing the system s state constraints , then it may be useful to first study ibc to verify that there exists a feasible solution trajectory connecting each pair of states .",
    "then , one may apply the pontryagin s minimum principle to find the optimal path .",
    "however we have found many examples in which the given affine system is not ibc through the interior of the given polytope @xmath0 , but the mutual accessibility property is achieved if we relax the problem little bit and allow trajectories starting in the interior of @xmath0 to visit a neighborhood of @xmath0 in the transient .",
    "this is acceptable in many practical scenarios in which one can distinguish between two types of constraints : soft constraints and hard constraints .",
    "the soft constraints may form the region of the nominal operating states of the system , while the hard constraints may represent the strict safety constraints which can not be violated even in the transient period . hence",
    ", it is reasonable to study mutual accessibility of the states in the interior of a polytope @xmath0 , formed by the soft constraints , through the interior of a bigger polytope @xmath1 ( @xmath2 ) , formed by the hard constraints .",
    "this motivates us to introduce and study the relaxed in - block controllability ( ribc ) notion in this paper .",
    "the study of ribc is also the first step in extending the hierarchical structures / controllability results in @xcite based on the new , relaxed notion .",
    "the study of controllability is fundamental to modern control systems ; as is well - known , for linear systems , algebraic conditions were provided in the 1960 s @xcite .",
    "restricting our attention here to controllability of linear systems subject to constraints , we next cite @xcite and @xcite , in which controllability under input constraints was studied . in @xcite ,",
    "controllability of continuous - time linear systems with input and/or state constraints was studied under the assumption that the transfer matrix of the system is right - invertible . under the same assumption ,",
    "@xcite studied null controllability of discrete - time linear systems with input and/or state constraints .",
    "the ibc notion formalizes the study of controllability under state constraints .",
    "the notion was first introduced in @xcite for finite state machines , and was then extended in @xcite for continuous nonlinear systems on closed sets and in @xcite for automata . in these papers ,",
    "the ibc notion is used to build hierarchical structures of the systems , but these papers do not study conditions for the ibc property to hold .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the ibc concept and its associated between block controllability ( bbc ) notion in @xcite are entirely different from the bisimulation notion @xcite , also used for constructing system abstractions .",
    "in addition to having different axioms , the methods of utilizing these notions to construct the abstractions are different .",
    "for instance , while the bisimulation - based methods typically use overapproximation of reachable sets to calculate the abstraction , this is not needed for the ibc hierarchical abstractions . in @xcite , we provide three easily checkable necessary and sufficient conditions for ibc to hold for affine systems on polytopes .",
    "we then use the results of @xcite to study controllability and build hierarchical structures of piecewise affine hybrid systems @xcite , and to systematically achieve approximate mutual accessibility properties of nonlinear systems under safety constraints @xcite . in @xcite , we provide computationally efficient algorithms for building polytopic regions satisfying the ibc property , while in @xcite , we extend the ibc conditions to controlled switched linear systems having both continuous inputs and on / off control switches . we here extend the results concerning the ibc properties developed in @xcite to the case where there are soft and hard safety constraints as discussed above . while the ibc notion was used before in @xcite ,",
    "the ribc notion is novel .    after defining ribc",
    ", we explore the geometry of the problem and provide for all the possible geometric cases necessary conditions for ribc .",
    "then , we show where these conditions are also sufficient .",
    "several illustrative examples are given to clarify the main results .",
    "for this study , we exploit some geometric tools used in the study of the controlled invariance problem @xcite and the reach control problems @xcite . in spite of using similar geometric tools in studying ribc",
    ", our problem is different . unlike the controlled invariance problem",
    ", we do not force all trajectories starting in @xmath0 to remain in @xmath0 itself , and we have the additional requirement of achieving mutual accessibility .",
    "also , unlike the reach control problem , in ribc , we do not try to force the trajectories of the affine system to exit the polytope in finite time through a prescribed facet .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section  [ sec : back ] provides some relevant , mathematical preliminaries . in section  [ sec : inblock ] , we briefly review ibc . in section  [ sec : rel_inblock ] , we define ribc and explore necessary and sufficient conditions for it .",
    "section [ sec : ex ] provides examples of the main results . a brief version of this paper appeared in @xcite .",
    "here we include more results and discussions .",
    "for instance , we provide here two other cases where the found necessary conditions are also sufficient .",
