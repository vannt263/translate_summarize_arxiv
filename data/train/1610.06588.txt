    "the observation of neutrino oscillations suggests that there must be physics beyond the standard model of particle physics due to the inclusion of right - handed neutrinos that are sterile with respect to the standard model gauge interactions .",
    "these additional states mix with the usual neutrinos of the standard model through yukawa interactions with the left - handed leptons . if these new sterile",
    "neutrinos become massive , then masses for the standard model neutrinos are also generated by the mixing between the sterile and active neutrinos .",
    "it is important to notice that the right - handed mass scale is not protected by any symmetry and therefore can take any value . on general grounds , one can assume it will take the highest possible value .",
    "despite not being active players of the sm dynamics , as mentioned before , right - handed ( rh ) neutrino existence is well - motivated by the evidence of non - zero neutrino masses provided by the oscillation experiments and by the yet unconfirmed but still intriguing evidence of reactor and accelerator experiments for additional light sterile neutrino states . without any direct experimental evidence , there could be a wide range ( from sub - ev to @xmath0 gev ) for the scale of masses for the right - handed neutrinos .",
    "while majorana mass terms for the sterile neutrinos could be directly added to the theory , we wish to explore a dynamical origin of these masses through sterile neutrino condensates .",
    "inspired by the bhl @xcite model of composite higgs fields , the role of the top quark condensates will be played by a condensate of the sterile neutrinos .",
    "the sterile neutrinos have no sm gauge interactions except for the gravitational interactions which are flavor neutral .",
    "we will assume that gravity or some other flavor neutral dynamics is responsible for driving the formation of the sterile neutrino condensates .",
    "the minimal model of sterile neutrino condensates will require at least two flavors of sterile neutrinos to explain the observed neutrinos oscillations .    with two flavors of sterile neutrinos and flavor neutral dynamics",
    ", the neutrino condensates will transform as a symmetric tensor representation of the u(2 ) sterile neutrino flavor symmetry .",
    "the dynamical breaking of this flavor symmetry is triggered by the formation of the sterile neutrino condensates and a number of composite scalars that will have their own low - scale interactions .",
    "a possible realization of the dynamics involved in the condensation can be reviewed in @xcite where the gravitational interactions of the rh sterile neutrinos is the mechanism inducing the condensation .",
    "this gravitational attraction , or different and undetermined short - range interactions , is independent of the sterile neutrino flavor thus forming composite scalars that are not constrained by the need for neutralizing their flavor charge implying a larger number of scalar bound states . while there could be a larger number of sterile neutrinos",
    ", we will focus on the minimal set needed to explain the observed neutrino oscillations which consists of the two flavors mentioned above .",
    "the two - flavor model will generate masses for only two of the three sm neutrinos so one of the neutrino mass eigenstates will have zero mass .    in the bhl model , the higgs field",
    "is formed as a top quark bound state at a high scale , @xmath1 . at a much lower scale , the electroweak symmetry is dynamically broken generating particle masses and a physical higgs boson .",
    "we will explore the nature of flavor symmetry breaking in the corresponding version of sterile neutrino condensate model .",
    "the reader may wonder what is the interest , if there is any , of an effective theory that will have to deal with the appearance of new nambu - goldstone bosons and pseudo - goldstone bosons once its symmetries are broken , and where to fit their masses in a particle catalogue that is not growing experimentally . however , this is not as troublesome as it may seem , and we can explore the convenience of these condensates for the treatment of some theoretical puzzles still unsolved .",
    "one of them would be cosmological inflation .",
    "keeping in mind models based on the same idea we are dealing with here @xcite , we will propose a series of bosons after symmetry breaking that could be interesting for this purpose .",
    "another possibility would be to explore the prospect of solving the electro - weak ( ew ) vacuum instability present in the running of the higgs quartic coupling @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , as we will see , our particular realization of rh neutrino condensation will prove not enough to fix this situation .",
    "rh neutrino composite scalars are a promising line of work for solving this problem nonetheless .",
    "additionally , we will address the experimental signature of the phase transition we are proposing , its imprint in the gravitational wave spectrum . in february 2016 , advanced ligo ( laser interferometer gravitational observatory ) @xcite confirmed experimentally the existence of gravitational waves . being the scientifical outbreak of the year , it would be quite interesting to determine the signature that our phase transition would leave in the gravitational spectrum",
    ". a neutrino condensate would , thus , be recognizable if a gravitational wave signal matches the theoretical prediction of the phase transition corresponding to a spontaneous symmetry breaking .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : section [ ssb ] is dedicated to introduce the scalar fields , the change into vectorial notation and calculating the spontaneous symmetry breaking ( ssb ) of the scalar theory .",
    "section [ explicit ] introduces an explicit breaking in a lower energy scale and in section [ yukawa ] we persent the last breaking , due to the yukawa interaction of the scalar , being the lowest energy scale of the theory . in section [ grav ] , the print left as gravitational waves by a potential featuring the same symmetries as the one presented in this analysis is studied .",
    "after that , the conclusions are presented in section [ conclusions ] .",
    "at the energy scale @xmath1 or due to the finite temperature of the universe , the sterile neutrinos can be expected to condense due to the attractive interaction of gravity or some other short - range dynamics . at low energy ,",
    "the neutrino biliniars effectively become dynamical composite scalars transforming as a symmetric tensor representation of the u(2 ) flavor symmetry of the sterile neutrinos .",
    "the simplest version of this dynamics invokes an attractive four - fermion interaction between the sterile neutrinos .",
    "following bhl , we can solve for the dynamics of the composite field representing the fermion bilinear operators , @xmath2 , where the latin indices represent sterile neutrino flavor .",
    "in analogy to the bhl calculation , we can compute the effective potential for the scalar field @xmath3 , generated by integrating out the sterile neutrinos at one loop .",
    "we obtain :    @xmath4    by tuning the parameters of the four - fermion theory , the scalar bilinear fields become dynamical with the usual kinetic terms . in @xcite , a calculation of the gravity triggered condensation",
    "is computed using a particular large n limit .    for the sake of clarity",
    "we will change this notation to a more compact one which will also prove to be more convenient .",
    "since we only have three scalars , @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 , we will change the tensor of scalars into a complex vector formalism @xmath8 , defined as :    @xmath9    which leaves the previous potential as follows : @xmath10-\\frac{1}{2}m^2\\mathrm{tr}\\left[\\left(-i\\sigma_2\\right)\\left(\\vec{\\sigma}\\vec{\\varphi}^*\\right)\\left(\\vec{\\sigma}\\vec{\\varphi}\\right)i\\sigma_2\\right]=\\\\ = & ~\\frac{\\lambda}{2}\\mathrm{tr}\\left[\\left(\\vec{\\sigma}\\vec{\\varphi}^*\\right)\\left(\\vec{\\sigma}\\vec{\\varphi}\\right)\\left(\\vec{\\sigma}\\vec{\\varphi}^*\\right)\\left(\\vec{\\sigma}\\vec{\\varphi}\\right)\\right]-\\frac{m^2}{2}\\mathrm{tr}\\left [ \\left(\\vec{\\sigma}\\vec{\\varphi}^*\\right)\\left(\\vec{\\sigma}\\vec{\\varphi}\\right)\\right]=\\\\ = & ~\\lambda\\left[2\\left(\\vec{\\varphi}^*\\vec{\\varphi}\\right)^2-\\left(\\vec{\\varphi}^*\\vec{\\varphi}^*\\right)\\left(\\vec{\\varphi}\\vec{\\varphi}\\right)\\right]-m^2\\left(\\vec{\\varphi}^*\\vec{\\varphi}\\right ) \\end{aligned}$}\\ ] ]    now , using that the field has an intuitive geometrical interpretation , we can use rotational symmetry to redefine the vector field , beginning with a redefinition of the global phase that would leave @xmath11 real , a rotation that would make @xmath11 vanish , and a second global phase shift that would give a real first component , i.e. @xmath12 , the second component would remain @xmath13 and the third component @xmath14 would be a complex field . replacing that in the previous equation , we have :    @xmath15-m^2\\left(r^2+i^2+s^2\\right)\\ ] ]    minimizing it , we arrive to the following gap equations : @xmath16=0\\\\ b:\\,\\ , & 2i\\left[2\\lambda\\left(r^2+i^2 + 3s^2\\right)-m^2\\right]=0\\\\ c:\\,\\ , & 2s\\left[2\\lambda\\left(r^2 + 3i^2+s^2\\right)-m^2\\right]=0 \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    their three solutions and vacuum energies are given by :    @xmath17    thus , we can see that ab and ac are possible ground states whilst bc , with a higher energy , is not .",
    "the ab and ac solutions each preserve a u(1 ) symmetry , associated to lepton number conservation .",
    "thus , the breaking is u(2)@xmath18 u(1 ) and there should be three goldstone bosons and three heavy states associated to it . in both cases we can use the residual u(1 ) symmetry to align the real @xmath19 field to be the 3 direction with all other components vanishing . hence , ab and ac are really the same solution for the spontaneous symmetry breaking",
    ".    we can compute the mass spectrum by expanding around the vacuum with @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 .    in summary",
    "we are left with three massive states , the real longitudinal field and the imaginary transverse fields , with masses given by @xmath23 , and three massless goldstone modes , which will remain this way in the absence of any additional symmetry breaking .",
    "the explicit breaking of the lepton number can be achieved by adding the following term to the effective potential presented in equation [ bhl - pot ] :    @xmath24    this term does not shift @xmath25 but the goldstone field associated with the imaginary longitudinal field becomes a massive pseudo - goldstone boson .",
    "the other two fields , associated with the real transverse part , remain massless .",
    "the yukawa interactions can provide the explicit breaking needed to make the remaining two goldstone bosons massive .",
    "this one - loop effective yukawa interaction can be written as :    @xmath26=\\left[\\vec{\\sigma}\\vec{\\varphi}^\\dagger\\left(y^\\dagger y\\right)\\vec{\\sigma}\\vec{\\varphi}\\left(i\\sigma_2\\right)\\left(y^\\dagger y\\right)^t\\left(-i\\sigma_2\\right)\\right]\\ ] ]    since the factor involving the yukawa coupling is hermitian , we can write it in the general form :    @xmath27    inserting this into the above expression , we get :    @xmath28 \\\\ = & 2\\left[-2\\left(\\vec{\\alpha}\\vec{\\varphi}^\\dagger\\right)\\left(\\vec{\\alpha}\\vec{\\varphi}\\right)+\\left(\\vec{\\alpha}^2+\\beta^2\\right)\\left(\\vec{\\varphi}^\\dagger\\vec{\\varphi}\\right)+2i\\beta\\vec{\\alpha}\\left(\\vec{\\varphi}\\times\\vec{\\varphi}^\\dagger\\right)\\right ] \\\\ \\\\ \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]",
    "now we want to find the last breaking of the model , which will define the smallest scale associated to it and give mass to the remaining goldstone bosons .",
    "the source of this breaking will be the effective yukawa term , as we stated in the previous section .",
    "for that purpose , we write the symmetric tensor file as a complex three vector field @xmath29 .",
    "we presented the explicit symmetry breaking in the last section . in equation [ additionalterm ] , we introduced a term @xmath30 , which breaks lepton number but still preserves rotational symmetry .",

    "<S> in this work , we develop a model for higgs - like composites based on two generations of right handed neutrinos which condense . we analyze the spontaneous symmetry breaking of the theory with two explicit breakings , setting the different scales of the model and obtaining massive bosons as a result . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we calculate the gravitational wave imprint left by the phase transition associated to the symmetry breaking of a generic potential dictated by the symmetries of the composites . </S>"
