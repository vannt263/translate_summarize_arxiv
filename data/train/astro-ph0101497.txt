    "the antennae ( ngc 4038/4039 , arp 244 , vv245 ) are a nearby ( @xmath022 mpc ) infrared - luminous pair of interacting galaxies . using n - body numerical simulations @xcite succeeded in generating the long tidal tails seen in optical/ images of the galaxies @xcite . the strongest emission in both the radio continuum @xcite and the co(1 - 0 ) line observed by @xcite and by s. w. lee , k. y. lo , r. a gruendel , and y. gao ( 2001 , in preparation , hereafter l01 ) occurs in the interaction ( overlap ) region to the west and between the two nuclei , especially in its southern dense clouds .",
    "the hubble space telescope h@xmath2 image of the antennae reveals thousands of giant regions in the interaction region .",
    "x - ray observations @xcite show harder and softer components corresponding to snrs / x - ray binaries and thermal emission from gas possibly heated by the interaction , respectively .",
    "these observations all point to there being copious numbers of active star formation sites in the interacting region .",
    "mid - infrared ( @xmath3 ) observations @xcite of the antennae by the infrared space observatory ( iso ) confirm that the starburst is taking place largely in portions of the interaction region which are highly optically obscured .",
    "the ratio of [ ] and [ ] mid - infrared lines indicates that stars as massive as 60 m@xmath4 are present there @xcite .",
    "the peak of [ ] 158 @xmath5 fine - structure line also lies in the interaction region , but overall the ratio of [ ] to co is a factor of 2.6 lower than usual starburst galaxies , suggesting that global star formation is not taking place in the antennae @xcite .    using the bima array with a 7.8@xmath6  @xmath7",
    "6.6@xmath6 beam l01 have found that there are two kinematically distinct molecular cloud complexes separated by @xmath0100 km s@xmath1 in the southern part of the overlap region ( see fig .  [ fig-1 ] ) , corresponding roughly to super giant molecular complexes 4 and 5 found by @xcite .",
    "it seems likely that each of these is associated with one of the interacting galaxies .",
    "because their relative positions along the line of sight are unknown , it is unclear if the complexes are approaching or moving away from each other .",
    "if the redshifted cloud complex is in front , it may collide with blueshifted cloud and subsequently a starburst , perhaps greater than that currently being observed , may occur .",
    "if the blueshifted clouds are in front , then the complexes are moving away from each other and the bulk of their interaction , if any , already has taken place in this region .",
    "comparison of velocity profiles of properly chosen emission lines , well separated in wavelength but from similarly excited species , could clarify the situation , as velocity components associated with the two complexes should undergo different amounts of extinction .",
    "uv and optical lines associated with star formation in these clouds are expected to be essentially totally obscured by dust . with this in mind",
    "we have observed the hydrogen infrared recombination lines pa@xmath8 ( 5 - 3 , 1.282  @xmath9 m ) , br@xmath10 ( 7 - 4 , 2.166  @xmath9 m ) , and br@xmath2 ( 5 - 4 , 4.052  @xmath9 m ) from part of the overlap region .",
    "the observations were made during ut 2000 28 february1 march at the united kingdom infrared telescope ( ukirt ) on mauna kea , using the facility cooled grating spectrometer cgs4 @xcite equipped with a 256@xmath7256 insb array .",
    "all three nights were clear with stable , but not exceptional seeing .",
    "we selected the 31 l / mm echelle , 300  mm focal length camera optics , and 2-pixel wide ( 0.8@xmath6 ) slit , which give cgs4 a velocity range of @xmath02,000  km  s@xmath1 at any wavelength in the 15  @xmath9 m region at a resolution of @xmath016  km  s@xmath1 ( two pixels ) .",
    "the @xmath080@xmath6 long slit was oriented north - south for all observations .",
    "sky measurements were obtained with the telescope nodded 600@xmath6 to the west .    on the first night , we centered the slit on the southern co peak at j2000 ra = 12:01:55.0 , dec = -18:53:01.5 , detecting weak line emission at pa@xmath8 and br@xmath10 , but no emission at br@xmath2 . on the following two nights we positioned the slit 3@xmath6 west of the co peak , which corresponds to the location of strongest mid - infrared emission as measured by iso .",
    "there we detected all three recombination lines at four spatially distinct locations along the slit ( see fig .",

    "the velocities and profiles of the infrared lines generally match those of the co emission . at ap",
    "i both the atomic and molecular line profiles show peaks near v@xmath12  =  1600  km  s@xmath1 , close to the velocities of the nuclei ( the nasa / ipac extragalactic database gives radial velocities near 1640  km  s@xmath1 for both ngc  4038 and ngc  4039 ) , and a blue asymmetry in the wings , and at ap  ii both show a more symmetric line profile peaked near the same velocity . in the south , however , there are distinct differences between the millimeter and infrared velocity profiles .",
    "most of the infrared line emission at ap  iii occurs near v@xmath12  =  1400  km  s@xmath1 , @xmath0100  km  s@xmath1 to the blue of the velocity of co peak emission and in fact further blueshifted than almost all of the co. no infrared line emission is present near 1600  km  s@xmath1 , the peak of the co redshifted component . at ap",
    "iv the velocities of peak emission are @xmath01500  km  s@xmath1 for both the infrared and millimeter lines , but little or no redshifted emission , which is seen in co near v@xmath12  =  1600  km  s@xmath1 , is detected in any of the infrared lines .    at none of the locations are there more than marginally significant differences between the profiles of the three infrared lines .",
    "however , the signal - to - noise ratios are not high , especially for br@xmath2 , so modest differences in profiles can not be ruled out .",

    "those at ap  iii and ap  iv are much larger , a@xmath16  @xmath0  45  mag and a@xmath16  @xmath0  46  mag , respectively .",
    "all of these estimates incorporate both interferometric and single dish observations .",
    "it is known that in some starburst galaxies the conversion factor is up to three times smaller than in our galaxy @xcite , and therefore it is possible that the extinctions are proportionately less in the antennae overlap region .    to derive the extinctions to the infrared line - emitting regions",
    ", we assumed typical region conditions ( t@xmath17 k , n@xmath17 @xmath18 ) , for which the intrinsic ratios are 0.162 , 0.0275 , and 0.0777 for pa@xmath8/h@xmath8 , br@xmath10/h@xmath8 , and br@xmath2/h@xmath8 respectively @xcite .",
    "we employed the formula obtained by @xcite for 0.93.4  @xmath5 , along with an interpolation of their @xmath19 and @xmath20 band extinctions , obtaining factors of 0.270 at pa@xmath8 , 0.115 at br@xmath10 , and 0.042 at br@xmath2 relative to visual extinction .",
    "we used the total integrated line fluxes as described in table  2 ; the overall general agreement of the three infrared line profiles at each aperture suggests that at each location the _ detected _ lines are attenuated by the same clouds .",
    "the results are tabulated in table  3 .",
    "significantly different values are obtained for different pairs of lines at two of the four locations . at all four locations",
    "the smallest value corresponds to the shortest wavelength pair ( pa@xmath8/br@xmath10 ) and the largest value corresponds to the longest wavelength pair ( br@xmath10/br@xmath2 ) .",
    "this indicates that , rather than a single source of line emission and an obscuring screen , there are distributions of line emission and attenuating clouds along the lines of sight at each location @xcite .",
    "the extinctions derived from the hydrogen recombination lines ( table  3 ) are low compared to those derived from the co measurements ( table  1 ) .",
    "this is the case even if the extinctions through the molecular clouds are a factor of three less ( as discussed in section 3.2 ) except for the largest value derived for ap  i. the results indicate that most of the the observed recombination line flux in each of the four apertures is emitted near the front surface of the associated cloud complex and , moreover , for ap  iii and ap  iv that complex must be the only one that is absorbing and hence the one that is closer to us .",
    "although the velocities and profiles of the infrared lines at ap  iii and ap  iv do not closely match those of either molecular cloud , it is much more likely that these blueshifted lines are associated with the blueshifted molecular cloud than the redshifted one .",
    "thus we conclude that blueshifted molecular cloud is in the foreground .",
    "a second approach makes use of the lack of redshifted line emission in the region where the clouds overlap , although redshifted emission is present in the northern region where the blueshifted cloud is absent . the non - detection at ap  iii implies either that no redshifted recombination line emission occurs there or that high extinction makes the infrared lines unobservable .",
    "for the latter case , if we assume the same ratios of infrared line emission to co line emission in ap  iii as in ap  i or ap  ii we obtain rough lower limits for a@xmath16 to the redshifted cloud .",
    "these may be compared to the values of a@xmath16 obtained from the co line strength ( table  1 ) to infer the geometry .",
    "we obtain lower limits to a@xmath16 at redshifted velocities of @xmath08 , @xmath020 , and @xmath027  mag for pa@xmath8 , br@xmath10 , and br@xmath2 , respectively .",
    "the most restrictive of these , the br@xmath10 and br@xmath2 limits , rule out extinction by the redshifted cloud _",
    "alone _ , even if that emission originates entirely behind it .",
    "we conclude that both clouds would be required to produce the extinction and , therefore , at ap  iii we again infer that the blueshifted cloud complex is in front of the redshifted complex .",
    "the above argument could be incorrect if the recombination line emission from the red - component in ap  iii is intrinsically weak . at ap",
    "iv it is more difficult than at ap  iii to clearly separate the two cloud complexes based on the co velocity profile , so this test is more problematic than for ap  iii , although it tends to suggest the same conclusion .",
    "the significant blueshift of the infrared lines at ap  iii relative to the blueshifted molecular component is apparent even at the highest resolution ( @xmath02@xmath6 ) co measurements of l01 .",
    "this nearly complete lack of overlap in velocities is somewhat surprising .",
    "we propose two possible explanations . 1 .",
    "the ionized gas lies close to the front surface of the blueshifted molecular cloud complex and is largely accelerated outward and toward the observer .",
    "2 . the stars with which the ionized gas is associated have a different velocity distribution than the molecular cloud .",
    "several possibilities exist to test the correctness of our conclusions about the relative positions of the molecular cloud complexes along the line of sight .",
    "measurements of the co lines at higher angular resolution would better match the spatial resolution of the infrared measurements .",
    "alternatively , spectral mapping of the infrared lines would allow a better comparison with the present co observations .",
    "searches for redshifted radio recombination line emission could determine if any ionized gas , undetected at infrared wavelengths , is associated with the redshifted molecular gas .",
    "we have obtained velocity - resolved spectra of three infrared hydrogen recombination lines , covering a wide range of wavelengths , in the interaction region of the antennae galaxies , where millimeter co observations have revealed two distinct clouds of gas with widely different radial velocities . using an empirical extinction formula , standard recombination line ratios , and the standard gas - to - dust conversion factor",
    ", we infer that the two molecular clouds currently are moving away from each other .",
    "this is contrary to the conventional expectation of cloud collisions leading to starburst activities ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the age of the starburst in the interacting region has been estimated to be 34 myrs @xcite .",
    "if this starburst were due to cloud collisions , then at present the clouds can only be separated ( along the line of sight ) by 100 km s@xmath1 times a few myrs , or @xmath0300  pc .",
    "the cloud complexes are about one kpc in extent in the plane of the sky .",
    "if they are roughly spherical they would still be physically overlapped in the radial direction .",
    "yet we observe two well - defined components moving apart at 100 km s@xmath1 .",
    "how this physical arrangement of the molecular clouds might have occurred is not clear .",
    "there is no easy way to determine the radial separation , if any , of the two molecular cloud complexes , although in principle , one could model the interaction of the gas in arp 244 in sufficient detail to see if this physical situation is plausible .",
    "the morphology of the molecular cloud complexes ( fig .",
    "[ fig-1 ] ) does not suggest physical proximity .",
    "if the starbursts currently observed are not due to direct cloud collisions , the physical mechanisms initiating them require further investigation .",
    "current observational evidence of molecular gas in starburst regions points to two characteristic parameters : high column density @xcite and high density @xcite .",
    "if high column density and high density ( both of which are naturally expected in the process of gravitational collapse ) are causal factors for starbursts , then the issue reduces to identifying the mechanisms during galaxy interaction that lead to the concentration of a large amount of molecular gas in regions such as the interacting region in arp 244 .",
