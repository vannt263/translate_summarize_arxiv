    "the large scale structure formation in the universe is dominated by the gravitational evolution of dark matter ( dm ) and the expansion of the universe @xcite .",
    "currently , the best candidate for the dm component is a weakly interacting massive particle ( wimp ) .",
    "a host of candidate particles can be suggested from the various extensions of the standard particle theory , for example supersymmetry @xcite or kaluza  klein concepts @xcite .",
    "theories concerning structure formation usually postulate non - interacting dark matter that is affected only by gravity . since the last decade ,",
    "a large number of studies employing analytical theories and/or n - body simulations have been conducted on this basis .",
    "there are also several variants of this approach , in which dm has been attributed with additional properties , such as being self - interacting , decaying ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) or having a postulated equation of state ( for example * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    at the linear regime , the current state - of - the - art",
    "cosmological theory , @xmath5-model with inflation , is very successful and can explain most of the observations .",
    "however , problems arise at the nonlinear regime , where the dm halo is decoupled from the expansion of the universe and evolves through self - gravitation and gravitational interactions with its environment @xcite .    at the high density region of dark matter",
    "halo cores , the physical properties of the dark matter particles and their interactions should become important . according to @xcite",
    "the weak - interaction cross section of the dark matter particle can have significant effect on the shape of the density profile on cosmological time scales .",
    "the cross section has also been constrained by @xcite using the bullet galaxy cluster . on the other hand , @xcite",
    "determine upper limit for the weak - interaction cross section from the cosmic diffuse neutrino background , and argue that dark matter haloes can not be significantly altered by dark matter particle annihilations .",
    "it is clear , that observations and theoretical studies of dark matter haloes can help us narrow down the properties of the candidate particles .",
    "the study of dark matter halo formation at the nonlinear regime by @xcite found that the dark matter haloes follow roughly a universal radially symmetric density profile ( nfw ) . in the study , one halo consisted of several thousand gravitating dm - particles .",
    "similar n - body experiments have been conducted regularly with increasing number of dm - particles and better resolution by several authors , see e.g. @xcite .    since then",
    ", several n - body study inspired models for the dm - haloes have been proposed .",
    "they all share some common properties ; at the outer fringes , the halo follows @xmath6 profile .",
    "after the transition region at scale radius @xmath7 , the profile is changed to value @xmath8 representing a cusped ( or flat ) core .",
    "an ad hoc explanation for this behaviour is that the outer region is in the state of inflow , where the dark matter decouples from the general expansion of the universe , and streams towards the core region of the halo .",
    "this is characterized by dominating radial component of the velocity field .",
    "inside the scale radius @xmath7 , where the velocity field is more thermalized , the halo is composed of captured dark matter component that has passed through the core and turned back at least once .",
    "see for example @xcite or @xcite for further details .    in their study , @xcite found an universal cusp slope @xmath9 , valid for haloes at extensive range of size scales .",
    "more recent n - body studies have resulted an array of different slope values ranging from @xmath9 to @xmath10 .",
    "this ambiguity in resolving the cuspiness of the dm haloes with n - body simulations , and contradicting observations from galactic dynamics has been one of the central weaknesses of the @xmath11cdm paradigm .",
    "the observed shape of the density profile can be measured indirectly by analyzing internal dynamics and kinematics of nearby galaxies , measuring x - ray temperature profile , using sunyaev - zeldovich effect , or with weak lensing measurements of galaxy clusters .",
    "several authors has published results characterizing the profile shape by combining some of these observations , see e.g. @xcite and references therein .    these studies either assume a profile shape in advance or try to acquire a fit for it .",
    "in both cases , the nfw profiles ( @xmath12 ) have proven successful @xcite , although shallower density profiles @xmath13 have been reported @xcite . on the other hand , lensing studies by @xcite estimated slightly steeper density profile for the cluster ac114 than the canonical nfw value .",
    "rotation curves and analysis of dynamics for late type spiral galaxies indicate that they must have shallower non - cusped cores @xcite",
    ". if a galaxy has a bar , it will interact with the halo and this should slow - down the bar rotation , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "it has been claimed that bars rotate so fast ( corotation resonance close to bar radius ) that they could not be embedded into strongly concentrated halos . on the other hand , the interaction between the bar and halo",
    "have been suggested to make the cusp more shallow @xcite .",
    "however , there seems to be possible issues with the resolution of n - body models @xcite , see also @xcite .",
    "interestingly , in recent high resolution n - body models by @xcite , the bar stayed fast and did not destroy the cusp .",
    "further complications are provided by recent results indicating that some small bars rotate slowly @xcite .",
    "slow rotation for such bars was suggested already by @xcite on morphological grounds , so it is possible that their origin is somehow different from larger bars that are studied more frequently .",
    "the dwarf galaxies at low surface brightness are considered as being dominated by dark matter component . however , direct measurements of the rotation curves of these objects indicate a constant density core without a cusp , see @xcite or @xcite , and corresponding references therein .",
    "the newest development in the constraints for the dark matter halo profiles comes from the observational particle physics .",
    "the wmap probe has observed a microwave `` haze '' around the galactic core .",
    "this can be explained by hypothetical dark matter particles annihilating at the high density region of the milky way core .",
    "the `` haze '' is interpreted as emitted synchrotron radiation from the produced electron - positron pairs , and it matches predicted emission from a dark matter halo with a cusped profile , @xmath14 within the inner kiloparsecs @xcite . since there is no definite direct detection of the dark matter particle to date , this can be considered as a hypothetical scenario yet to be proved or disproved .",
    "the largest coherent sample of the galaxy scale strong gravitational lenses has been measured with the hst in the sloan lens acs survey @xcite .",
    "@xcite made a statistical study about subset of these lenses , and confirmed that on average , an isothermal profile @xmath15 fits the lensing profiles .",

    "appendix [ cusplimderiv ] presents definitions of @xmath7 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 and derivation for the equation ( [ cusplim ] ) .",
    "it can also be shown that , if dark matter haloes have shallower profile ( @xmath27 ) , triple image lenses with visible inner caustic image should be very common .",
    "the estimated probability for a triple image lens configuration is @xmath28 and there are only three observed lens systems with ( suspected ) visible inner caustic image out of one hundred .",
    "this gives an average cusp slope value @xmath29 , which is closer to the isothermal value .",

    "we investigate the characteristics of the lensing profiles by deriving a cusp slope limit ( csl ) value @xmath1 for the shallowest cusp slope , that can produce the required flux difference for the images with any lensing geometry ( i.e. it must hold @xmath30 for the lensing profile ) .",

    ", we can characterize the general properties of lensing profiles . for this purpose ,",
    "we composed a catalogue of the double image lenses exhibiting properties of radial symmetry .",
    "our sample is based on the known cases of the lensed quasars listed in castles survey .",
    "our method relies on the observed flux ratios of double image lenses .",
    "because we use image flux ratios , information on the lens and source redshifts , lens mass and concentration , and cosmology is not required . with our formulation ,",
    "the intrinsic halo properties are separated from these quantities .",
    "therefore , the statistical method does not require theoretical distributions characterizing lens and source populations ( such as schechter function coupled with the mass - luminosity relation for lenses , or quasar luminosity functions for sources ) , which makes it possible to avoid number of different uncertainties in the analysis .",
    "however , there are several factors that can corrupt the observed fluxes from the predicted magnification produced by the lens .",
    "we examine effects by the lens ellipticities , the substructure in the lensing halo and time - delay from a variable source .",
    "this is done by constructing mock lens catalogues with the monte carlo method when accounting for these factors .",

    "the first image @xmath31 is located between the einstein radius ( @xmath34 or @xmath35 ) and the first critical radius @xmath36 .",
    "the second image is at the opposite side of the optical axis , between the einstein radius and the second critical radius , equation ( [ crirad2 ] ) ( the largest possible distance from the optical axis for the multiple imaged source ) .",
    "the third image @xmath33 ( inner image ) is inside the first critical radius , and it is usually strongly demagnified . with large values of @xmath37 , outside the second critical radius , the lensing curve should approach to @xmath38 .",

    "the csl value is based on the analytical formulation of the magnification ratio of the lensed images , and its solutions .    in gravitational lensing",
    ", the source image is lensed by the gravitational field of the lens object . the source image that is thought to be confined on a plane at the source distance @xmath39 ,",
    "produces observed images on the lens plane ( at the lens object distance @xmath40 ) .",
    "mapping from the source plane to the lens plane is described by the lens equation .    in axially symmetric lensing",

    "corresponding radial coordinate at the source plane is denoted with @xmath41 and at the lens plane with @xmath42 , as in @xcite .",
    "when the source is located at the origin ( @xmath43 ) , it is mapped to the lens plane as an einstein ring , that has radius @xmath44 .",
    "the axially symmetric lens equation for the gnfw density profile , normalized with the einstein radius @xmath45 , can be written as @xmath46 where the radial coordinate at the source plane is @xmath47 and corresponding radial coordinate at the lens plane is @xmath48 .",
    "scale radius @xmath7 , and constants @xmath49 and @xmath50 depend on the cosmology , the mass and the concentration of the lens object , and the geometrical setup of the lensing .",

    "the approximation in the lens equation ( [ leq ] ) breaks down with large values of the radial coordinate @xmath37 , and therefore the lens equation ( [ leq ] ) does not behave asymptotically as it should .",

    "a lensed image at location @xmath59 is magnified by the lens as @xmath60 note , that the factor @xmath49 dependency is contained into a coefficient multiplying the magnification .",
    "therefore , the @xmath49 dependency is cancelled out when considering ratio of image magnifications in strong lensing cases .",

    "the images at @xmath31 and @xmath33 are at the opposite side of the lens with negative and positive parities ( the image at @xmath33 is usually strongly demagnified ) . the solutions @xmath31 and @xmath32 of a source at @xmath61 in the lens equation must satisfy @xmath62 now we can parameterize the lens equation with coordinate ratio @xmath63 , where @xmath64 and @xmath65 are observed angular distances of the images from the optical axis on the sky correspondingly .",
    "the advantage of the parameter @xmath66 is that it is directly observable , if the location of the optical axis is known .",

    "note that the derived relation ( [ opaxis ] ) between the location of the optical axis , the image magnification ratio and the value of the cusp slope does not depend on the mass or the concentration of the lens , the cosmological model , or the redshifts of the source and lens object .",
    "this makes it an ideal tool for studying the structure of the lensing halos by separating their intrinsic properties from the extrinsic lensing conditions .",
    "when the magnification ( flux ) ratio of the observed images ( @xmath76 ) is measured , the location of the optical axis ( @xmath66 ) as a function of the cusp slope parameter @xmath0 can be solved from equation ( [ opaxis ] ) . basically , there are two different groups of solutions corresponding to triple and double image lens configurations .",

    "but on the other hand , using the relation ( [ opaxis ] ) , this point can be related to the observed magnification ratio with @xmath86 pair of equations ( [ equation1 ] ) and ( [ equation2 ] ) , can be used to solve @xmath87 and @xmath1 for a lens system with observed magnification ratio @xmath88 ( where @xmath89 and @xmath90 are corresponding observed fluxes for the images ) .",

    "the absolute maximum for the possible values of the cusp slope @xmath0 can be calculated from the measured flux ratio for each observed double image lens system .",
    "this is the previously discussed cusp slope limit , abbreviated as csl .",
    "when we assume random lensing alignments , the distribution of the csl values depend only on the properties of the lensing profiles . for a single universal cusp slope value ,",
    "the numerical formulation for the csl probability is presented in section [ csldistro ] .",
    "an axially symmetric lens potential produces visible triple image lens when images at @xmath31 and @xmath33 are sufficiently close to the radial critical curve at @xmath93 .",
    "otherwise , the image @xmath33 inside the caustic curve becomes unobservable because of strong demagnification , while image @xmath31 remains magnified , and a double image lens system is observed .",
    "images nearby the critical radius @xmath94 are produced by source images that are located near @xmath95 , where @xmath96 is the maximum source coordinate for producing multiple images ( strong lensing ) .",
    "thus , the triple image condition demarcates out part of the strong lensing region . in other words , for double image lensing , the source coordinate @xmath61 must have @xmath97 .",
    "the condition for triple image lensing can be derived by examining the magnification ratio @xmath98 of the images @xmath31 and @xmath33 .",
    "this is done by expanding the lens equation at @xmath36 , setting the condition @xmath99 and solving it for the corresponding source coordinate . here",
    "@xmath100 is the limiting value for the observable magnification ratio .    from the lensing theory presented in @xcite ,",
    "the maximum source coordinate has value @xmath101 where @xmath102 and @xmath0 is the cusp slope of the density profile in equation ( [ profile ] ) .",
    "we normalize the lens equation @xmath103 with expression ( [ maxsource ] ) in case of @xmath104 .",
    "now the lens equation can be expressed in new coordinates @xmath105 and @xmath106 as @xmath107 we continue our derivation by expanding the re - normalized lens equation at @xmath108 , which gives us @xmath109 by solving this approximation we get the image location @xmath110 from a source nearby the critical curve . here",
    "the positive sign corresponds to image @xmath31 and negative to @xmath33 .",
    "again , from the lensing theory presented in @xcite , the magnification ratio condition for the triple image lensing can be expressed as @xmath111 by inserting solutions for @xmath112 and @xmath113 from equation ( [ solutions ] ) to this expression and solving for the source coordinate @xmath41 , the condition for observable triple image lensing becomes @xmath114 the power of two factor in parenthesis that depends on @xmath100 , approaches very quickly to the unit value if demanding ten or a hundredfold magnification ratio for the limit of observability . because determining the exact value for the magnification ratio limit is impossible , we set this factor equal to one .",
    "thus , practically without any loss of accuracy , the source image condition for the triple image lensing can be generalized to @xmath115    as before , we assume that the source images are uniformly distributed at the source plane inside radius @xmath116 . now the source image coordinate limit ( [ triplecond ] ) leads directly to a simple graphical probability for triple image lensing @xmath117 that depends only on the cusp slope parameter of the density profile ( [ profile ] ) .",
    "the expression ( [ tripleprob ] ) for probability of the triple image lensing can be considered also valid with reasonable values of ellipticities for triaxial haloes .",
    "corresponding treatment can be made for haloes with elliptic isocontours following the profile ( [ profile ] ) .",
    "note , that the probability ( [ tripleprob ] ) applies only on proportional share of triple image lenses among already identified lens systems , not on arbitrary galaxy in the universe .",
    "this is why the @xmath49 term dependency vanishes from the equation .",
    "additionally , this result does not account for the finite angular resolution in the real world observations .",
    "the remarkably simple condition ( [ triplecond ] ) and probability ( [ tripleprob ] ) have direct consequences on the general properties of the lensing potential and properties of dark matter haloes . according to the expression ( [ tripleprob ] ) ,",
    "double image lensing and triple image lensing have equal probability when @xmath118 .",
    "if the cusp slope value @xmath119 , triple image lenses are more common than double image lenses .",
    "the fact that there are only three known cases with visible inner caustic image out of roughly hundred implicates that the cusp slope in the dark matter profile must be closer to isothermal value @xmath15 than @xmath120 .",
    "in fact , if we set @xmath121 and solve the cusp slope parameter from the equation ( [ tripleprob ] ) , we get @xmath122 - a result rather close to the quoted value for the population h1 in this paper .      here",
    "we show how to calculate a numerical probability function for the csl limit values .",
    "we assume that the source images are uniformly distributed at the double image region of the source plane limited by the equation ( [ triplecond ] ) , i.e. the radial source coordinate @xmath123    we assume a single population of lenses with a universal cusp slope value @xmath0 .",
    "all the slope parameters used in the following calculations have @xmath124 .",
    "special cases @xmath9 and @xmath10 could be treated in similar way , but it is not necessary at this point .",
    "the differential probability for having a lens with value @xmath1 is corresponding to an area of a ring with an inner radius @xmath41 and an outer radius @xmath125 : @xmath126 where @xmath127 .",
    "this equation can be integrated in order to estimate the probability of a double image lens to have @xmath128 : @xmath129    although it could be possible to write an approximation for the function @xmath127 or rewrite the differential ( [ difpop ] ) using other variables , we calculate it here numerically . for this purpose",
    "we employ the magnification ratio @xmath130 of the images @xmath31 and @xmath32 produced by the source image at @xmath61 , as presented in equation ( [ opaxis ] ) . here",
    "@xmath67 is the image coordinate ratio .",
    "we start calculating the @xmath131 for each @xmath1 by solving the equation @xmath132 numerically for @xmath87 .",
    "the acquired value is subsequently inserted to @xmath133 which is then solved numerically for @xmath66 .",

    "error bars correspond to measurement errors in photometry .",
    "thick solid curve represents fitted csl - distribution , with @xmath188 ( dashed line ) and @xmath184 ( shaded region ) outlining the poisson shot noise error region .",
    "the fitted cusp slope value for the data is @xmath289 and normalization @xmath290 for the first population .",
    "the second population has corresponding determined values @xmath291 and @xmath292 . ]      the dual population model ( populations are abbreviated as h1 and h2 ) is implemented by adding two individually normalized distributions together , producing a model with four parameters .",
    "this model is fitted to the observational data in a similar fashion as the single population model in the previous subsection .",
    "the fit produces estimates for the universal cusp slope values @xmath293 and @xmath294 for both populations , and the corresponding normalization values @xmath295 and @xmath296 .",
    "the detailed fit to this data is presented in figure [ datfig2 ] .",
    "the acquired values are cusp slope @xmath289 and normalization @xmath290 for the population h1 and for the population h2 correspondingly @xmath291 , @xmath292 .",
    "normalization values @xmath295 and @xmath296 gives the relative abundance of population h1 and population h2 lens objects in the sample .",
    "our results indicate that 83 per cent of the lens objects belong to the population h1 and 17 per cent to the population h2 with 4 per cent error margins in both values .",
    "this suggests that on average roughly one sixth of the lens objects capable of strong lensing belong to the second population with shallower cusp slope .",
    "the dual population fit is better than the single population fit , which is to be expected because number of free parameters is doubled . in practice",
    "all the data points are now inside the one-@xmath188 poisson noise range of the model .",
    "population i parameters are the same as in the single population model . however , the second population parameters have much larger relative error range than population h1 parameters , indicating large uncertainty .",
    "this reflects the small size of the lens sample . additionally , the second population cusp slope has such a value that is much more affected by the perturbations than the cusp slope value for population h1 lenses .",
    "regardless of the poisson noise limits , we are very concerned if the observed feature at @xmath297 is nonetheless noise induced .",
    "the statistical fit with such a small sample compared to the number of fitted parameters should be regarded with high suspicion .",
    "additionally , the signature of the second population is relatively weak when considering the error limits for the fitted parameters of the second population .",
    "therefore , we set up a monte - carlo experiment in order to find out the probability that the second population hypothesis could be rejected .",
    "we generated 100 lens catalogues with 40 lens systems by randomly sampling a mock catalogue of 4000 lens systems .",
    "the mock catalogue was created using a single lens population with a cusp slope value of @xmath298 and accounting for the lens ellipticities , the substructure and the source variability .",
    "these generated catalogues were fitted with a single population model . the probability to reject the second population hypothesis is equal to the probability to get as strong signature of the second population as in the observed lens catalogue .    in the observations , the second population feature exceeds the @xmath184 noise limit by factor 1.8 at @xmath1 range @xmath299 $ ] . in order to interpret the noise induced feature as the second population , we set a condition that the data - set must contain a data point that exceeds the @xmath184 level by similar factor at the same range .",
    "we found one such catalogue out of one hundred , thus we estimate that the probability for rejection of the second population hypothesis is at order of one per cent .",
    "on the other hand , the observational lens data contains two data points above the @xmath184 noise level .",
    "if we count lens samples that have two data points exceeding the @xmath184 threshold in @xmath1 range @xmath299 $ ] , we get a rejection probability of two per cent .",
    "if we add the factor of 1.8 excess condition , the probability goes down below one per cent .",
    "hence , we estimate that the rejection probability for the dual population hypothesis is roughly @xmath300 per cent .",
    "our analysis is based on a geometric measure of a lens system - how much cuspiness does an axially symmetric lens need in order to produce observed magnification ratio , i.e. the csl value . in a sense , analogously to the curvature characterizing properties of space , it can be thought as a gauge characterizing localized properties of a lensing event .",
    "there is no need to define the exact global properties of the lensing potential in order to have a meaningful measure .",
    "the csl measure can be derived for axially symmetric lenses , and as a result , all the coefficients containing information on cosmology , cosmological angular separations of the lens and the source , lens mass and concentration are cancelled out .",
    "only preserved quantities are the cusp slope and the image magnification ratio .",
    "if we assume that the observed lenses have completely random orientations , thus neglecting effects from the magnification bias , a theoretical distribution of the csl values can be calculated for a population of lenses . in that case , the properties of the lensing profile(s ) determine the shape of the distribution .",
    "when we calculate the csl value distributions from the real life data , we make an additional assumption that the observed image fluxes are determined only by the lens magnification of a constant flux source .",
    "this chain of assumptions has its weak points , and we have tried to address most of them in section [ probs ] .",
    "here we are going to do a brief summary of these , and discuss few unaddressed ones .",
    "the first unaddressed issue is at the derivation of the magnification ratio equation ( [ opaxis ] ) .",
    "the equation is based on the inner part of the lens equation that does not behave correctly when the radial image coordinate at the lens plane exceeds the value @xmath301 .",
    "usually , this happens outside the strong lensing region , but if @xmath302 and the mass of the lens or the concentration is high enough , @xmath301 can be located inside the strong lensing area ( @xmath303 ) .",
    "this asymptotic behaviour of the lens equation was accounted for when the mock catalogues were created with the monte carlo method .",
    "the method works correctly with the mock data because the deviation from the correct value at @xmath304 happens very slowly with the increasing radial image coordinate .",
    "usually , difference becomes non - negligible only for images far into the weak lensing region even if @xmath301 were inside the strong lensing area .",
    "significant deviation requires unrealistically high mass or concentration for the halo .",
    "the next issue is the error factors considered in section [ probs ]  lens ellipticity , lens potential substructure , and source variability .",
    "our earlier treatment was focused on examining the perturbations in the recovered cusp slope value .",
    "the analysis showed that the most severe disturbations originated from the lens ellipticities , although those were at manageable level when @xmath305 with random ellipticities .",
    "the aforementioned factors have little or no effect because the analysis is restricted to the double image lenses by definition . at the double image region ,",
    "deviations from the axially symmetric model are at their weakest .",
    "differences become severe nearby the critical curves ( at the origin @xmath247 and at the border of the strong lensing region @xmath95 ) , where the magnification diverges .",
    "images nearby the critical curves produce either the einstein rings ( @xmath247 ) , quad lenses , or triple image lenses ( @xmath306 ) .",
    "hence , the real life lensed images nearby critical curves are easily identified , and they can be excluded from the observational sample .    the similar reasoning can be used to counter arguments for effects from the sheared potential , micro - lensing , and the magnification bias mentioned earlier .",
    "the bias can not be very strongly present in the sample because the lens systems with excessive magnifications are excluded from the analysis .    because the csl analysis method is based on the flux ratios of the images , the extinction effects from intergalactic matter that affect both images in a similar way , can not change the results . in principle , considerable amount of differential extinction present at the lens object can corrupt the csl value .",
    "however , the lensed images are very often well outside the visible lens object , which makes it improbable .    at this point",
    "we can conclude that the same reason that makes double image lenses unattractive targets for the substructure or the micro - lensing studies gives them ideal properties as a probe for the macro - lens profile .",
    "they are resilient against perturbations .",
    "the main results from our study are the two halo profile populations .",
    "we get cusp slope value @xmath307 and normalization @xmath308 for population h1 and for population h2 correspondingly @xmath291 , @xmath292 .",
    "the normalization values indicate that 83 per cent of the lens objects belong to population h1 and 17 per cent to population h2 with 4 per cent error margins in both values .",
    "this suggests that , on average , one sixth of the lens objects in our sample belongs to the second population with shallower cusp slope .",
    "we performed a monte carlo study in order to find out the rejection probability for the second population hypothesis .",
    "the result suggests that the probability for the second population signature being noise induced is at order of @xmath300 per cent .",
    "as our monte carlo testing in section [ probs ] pointed out , the profiles with shallower cusp slopes are more easily perturbed by error sources .",
    "these deviations have tendency to make the acquired cusp slope steeper than it really is .",
    "although this is partly reflected by rather wide error range in the population h2 values , our referred population h2 results should be interpreted with caution .",
    "the cusp slope value @xmath294 can be alleged as an estimate for the lower limit of the population h2 profiles .",
    "the foremost alternative explanation for the h2 population is that they are actually unresolved triple image lenses .",
    "however , this scenario has several weaknesses : the fused pair of images should possess a strong autocorrelation in brightness variations that is equal to the time delay between the images .",
    "these unresolved lenses would increase the total number of the triple image lenses and their corresponding statistical frequency to such level that would contradict the acquired cusp slope for the main population h1 .",
    "if the h2 lenses were unresolved triple image lenses in h1 , the share of triple image lenses would be 11 out of 100 , and the main population should have profile @xmath309 according to the equation ( [ tripleprob ] ) .",
    "this is well off from the determined profile value for the main population .",
    "furthermore , although the h2 population of halos is smaller , they produce distribution that is consistent with the model . this should not be the case if they were triple image lenses  their distribution should be more random .",
    "according to the conventional wisdom acquired from the cosmological n - body simulations , the universal cusp slope for the dark matter haloes is around @xmath310 , depending on the author .",
    "however , observations on rotation curves of normal and lsb galaxies suggest even higher values , exceeding @xmath311 .",
    "our results contradict most of these results .",
    "the lens density profiles has also been studied by @xcite .",
    "they used a power law profile with joint weak and strong lensing modelling , and confirmed the sis lens population ( h1 ) , but did not observe the shallower profile population h2 .",
    "the weak lensing does not have very good resolution , and the pure power law profiles do not account the projected halo component outside the scaling radius @xmath312 realistically .",
    "additionally , they study average properties of 22 lens halos . according to our results ,",
    "three or four lenses in their sample should have shallower profiles .",
    "the second population signature can easily be lost into the residual noise when considering average properties of their lensing sample .",
    "interestingly , @xcite and @xcite have performed cosmological n - body simulations with baryonic matter component .",
    "they have found similar populations for the halo profiles as we do in our lens study . in the first population",
    ", the halo profile is made steeper by the rich baryonic content , down to the value @xmath313 , which is close to the isothermal value .",
    "they also discovered a second population of haloes that were poor in baryonic content , with cusp value @xmath314 .",
    "it would seem , that although baryonic matter density is much lower than density of dark matter , it can still have non - negligible effects on the evolution of dark matter .",
    "our numerical values are also supported by the additional results discussed in appendix [ cusplimderiv ] and the section [ tripleimage ] .",
    "flat cores @xmath315 are very poor in strong lensing , and shallow profiles @xmath316 should produce excessive number of triple image lenses .",
    "the csl concept has clear advantages .",
    "the method uses more realistic lensing model inspired by n - body simulations . the only required data is sampled double image lens photometry .",
    "the method can separate intrinsic properties of the lensing halos from the extrinsic lensing conditions .",
    "thus no information on the lens and the source redshifts , the lens masses or concentrations , cosmology , or theoretical distribution functions characterizing the lens and source populations is needed .",
    "this removes many uncertainties that are usually present in the statistical lensing studies .",
    "the method has also disadvantages .",
    "when general properties of dark matter haloes are considered , there is a strong selection bias in our study .",
    "our results concern only those haloes that are able to do strong lensing , i.e. haloes with cusp slopes steeper than @xmath17 .",
    "generally , the lens objects are massive elliptical or early type galaxies residing at the core of a small galaxy cluster which would incorporate the dark matter halo of the whole cluster into the lensing potential .",
    "these kinds of objects are very different from the late type spiral galaxies or lsb - galaxies , which usually can not perform strong lensing at all . additionally , there are relatively few observed double image lenses at the moment , and the csl method requires a hand - picked sample of relatively unperturbed lens systems exhibiting axial symmetry .",
    "new lens systems are found all the time .",
    "certain proportion of these are double image lenses .",
    "larger data - set produces better results , making the csl analysis more accurate in the future .",
