    ".    however , such large zams mass pop iii stars seem to be formed only for spherically symmetric systems so that zams mass of pop iii stars may change when we take effects of rotation into account .",
    "some cosmological simulations indicate that the rotation of these gas clumps can naturally split them into sub clumps of @xmath20 @xcite .",
    "even if the seed gas clump is more massive , the protostellar uv radiation evaporates a significant fraction of the mass so that the pop iii stars are as small as @xmath21 @xcite .",
    "population iii.2 stars , which may be more abundant , can also have smaller zams mass ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "massive pop iii stars typically end up their lives as blue supergiants ( bsgs ) with massive hydrogen envelope due to the low opacity in the envelope @xcite .    for such bsg pop iii stars ,",
    "several authors have discussed the possibility of gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) @xcite , which we like to discuss from another point .",
    "one of the most promising scenarios of long grbs is _ collapsar _ scenario , in which relativistic jets burrowing through the stellar envelope are indispensable to bring relativistically moving elements into optically thin region without dissipation . for massive progenitors with enough angular momentum , a stellar mass black hole ( bh ) with an accretion disk",
    "would be first formed in the core - collapse phase @xcite , and relativistic jets may be launched via the blandford - znajeck ( bz ) like process @xcite . if the jet can break out the stellar envelope before the central engine ceases , it may produce prompt gamma rays by some dissipation processes near and beyond the photospheric radius ( see e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",

    "not , the anticipated large pre - collapse mass of pop iii stars was thought to be problematic .",
    "indeed , @xcite claimed that the progenitors of the observed long grb would not be giant stars like red supergiants ( rsgs ) but compact stars like co wolf - rayet ( wr ) stars .",
    "nevertheless several authors have claimed that pop iii stars can produce grbs irrespective of the pre - collapse mass @xcite .",
    "this is essentially because they would be bsgs in the pre - collapse phase @xcite .",
    "the large mass gives a larger intrinsic energy budget , and the relative compactness for the large mass helps the jet to reach the stellar edge before the engine ceases . as an interesting outcome , the duration of the prompt emission of pop iii or bsg grbs would be much longer @xmath22 compared with the observed value @xcite .",
    "@xcite argued the detectability of such ultra - long grbs from bsgs and found that if the peak spectral energy and isotropic equivalent energy ( @xmath23 ) correlation holds the observed @xmath24 with @xmath25 and the duration @xmath26 for pop iii bsg with mass @xmath27 at @xmath28 which can be detected by an @xmath29-type future instrument .",

    "given that the observed redshift is relatively small , @xmath33 , the progenitor of this grb might be a metal - poor bsg in the local universe .    here , we propose a new possible photon emission associated with such ultra - long grbs from pop iii stars , or more general bsg progenitors .",
    "we consider a cocoon i.e. , a hot - plasma sheath of the jet , which is a necessary ingredient of the above collapsar model of grb . before",

    "cocoon emissions are observationally characterized by three parameters @xmath144 , from which one can obtain constraints between four physical parameters of the cocoon at the jet breakout @xmath105 . in our prescription , the latter three can be derived from the phenomenological parameters @xmath192 . for a fixed parameter set of @xmath192 ,",
    "the observed characteristics highly depends on the progenitor mass , as shown in fig .",
    "this means that one could constrain the mass of the pop iii or bsg progenitor by detecting the cfpe . on the other hand ,",
    "if the progenitor mass is fixed , one can constrain @xmath193 from the observed light curve ( see fig.[f2 ] ) .",
    "this means that one can potentially probe , e.g. , the accretion disk formation , the jet production and propagation _ before _ the jet breakout , which otherwise can not be seen only using electromagnetic signals of the prompt emissions .",
    "the observation of prompt gamma - ray and afterglow emissions from the relativistic jet could give a stronger constraint on @xmath194 and also @xmath83 combined with the detection ( or even non - detection ) of cocoon emissions .",
    "although our calculations are based on several simplified assumptions , we can expect the results are qualitatively correct .",
    "our model parameters @xmath192 , which are generally progenitor- and time - dependent , could be refined by numerical studies on the accretion - disk formation and the jet propagation in the collapsing stars .    in this paper , we assume that the inner and outer part of cocoon , i.e. , shocked stellar matter and shocked jet matter , are fully mixed ( eq . ( [ eq : mc ] ) ) .",
    "this estimate gives a maximum baryon loading on the cocoons .",
    "let us consider the cases where the mixing of the cocoon is suppressed by a factor @xmath195 , i.e. , @xmath196 .",
    "the baryon loading and the optical depth of the cocoon at the jet breakout scales as @xmath197 and @xmath198 , respectively .",
    "then , from eq .",
    "( [ eq : tpeak ] ) , ( [ eq : lpeak ] ) , and ( [ eq : epeak ] ) , the cfpe becomes brighter with a higher peak energy and a shorter duration as @xmath199 , @xmath200 , and @xmath201 .",
    "for example , in the case of the s40wr progenitor with @xmath202 , the cfpe is characterized by @xmath203 , @xmath204 , and @xmath205 .",
    "such emissions from mildly - relativistic cocoon fireball are discussed in e.g. , @xcite .",
    "the dynamics of cocoons just after the jet breakout , i.e. , @xmath206 , would be more complex than our model and can also be refined with the aid of numerical simulations . as for the coasting phase of the cocoon fireball ,",
    "i.e. , @xmath207 , more detailed radiation transfer calculations are needed to distinguish cocoon emissions from other competing sources e.g. , various types of sne and galaxies .",
