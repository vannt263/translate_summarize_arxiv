    "the intra - cluster medium ( icm ) in clusters of galaxies , i.e , hot thermal plasmas in collisional ionization equlibria confined within their gravitational potential , constitutes the most dominant form of cosmic baryons that has ever been detected .",
    "although the icm radiates predominantly optically - thin thermal x - ray emission , some clusters have been reported to exhibit excess signals above the thermal emission at the lowest or highest energy ends of their x - ray spectra .",
    "one interpretation of the soft excess is emission from warm hot intergalactic medium ( whim ) , which has been predicted from cosmological simulations ( e.g. @xcite ) and is expected to solve the so - called missing baryon problem ( e.g @xcite ) .",
    "another interpretation of the spectral soft and/or hard excess is non - thermal emission from accelerated particles in galaxy clusters ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) : a power - low shaped spectrum can exceed the dominant thermal emission at both sufficiently high and low energies .",
    "this provides a possibility that galaxy clusters are giant accelerators in the universe .",
    "thus , the search for soft and hard excess signals in clusters forms a very important research subject .",
    "however , the instrumental sensitivity in these photon energies has been insufficient , and hence the existence of these excess components has remained controversial ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .    among those galaxy clusters",
    "from which the excess emission has been reported , abell  2199 is particularly interesting , because it has been suspected to exhibit both the soft and hard excess components .",
    "in fact , kaastra et al .",
    "( 1999 ) reported the detection of both , based on the bepposax , extreme ultraviolet explorer , and rosat observations .",
    "the two excess components were simultaneously expressed by a single power law with a photon index @xmath18 which is superposed on the thermal emission spectrum , and interpreted as inverse compton ( ic ) photons produced when the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) photons are scattered up by relativistic electrons in the cluster . however , as argued by @xcite , the magnetic field in abell  2199 would have to be unusually weak ( @xmath19 g ) in order for the relativistic electrons not to produce synchrotron emission beyond measured upper limits of diffuse radio emission . as an alternative interpretation , @xcite proposed non - thermal bremsstrahlung by supra - thermal electrons which are being accelerated in the cluster .    in the era of xmm - newton ,",
    "the possibility of thermal emission from a warm gas also became another popular idea to explain the soft excess in several clusters .",
    "kaastra et al .",
    "( 2004 ) reported a redshifted o  vii emission line from a 0.2 kev warm gas in abell  2199 , along with coma , abell  1795 , sersic  159 - 03 , mkw  3s , abell  2052 , and abell  3112 , and hence ascribed their soft excess to emission from whim . at the same time",
    ", chandra has made progress on the icm physics of abell  2199 especially in the central region , such as an asymmetric temperature distribution in the direction perpendicular to the jets within @xmath20 of the center ( kawano et al .",
    "2003 ) , and a weak isothermal shock associated with the central active galactic nucleus ( sanders & fabian 2006 ) .    in order to examine the soft and hard excess phenomena of abell  2199 with a better sensitivity",
    ", we observed the object with suzaku ( @xcite ) .",
    "the excellent low - energy capability of xis - bi ( back illuminated ccd , @xcite ) and the low background of the silicon pin detectors in the hxd ( @xcite ; @xcite ) have provided the best data in the soft and hard x - ray bands , respectively . as a result , we have obtained tight upper limits on both excess components , and strengthened the dominance of the thermal emission from this cluster .    in the present paper , quantities quoted from the literature are rescaled to the hubble constant of @xmath21 , and errors are given at 90 % confidence range unless otherwise stated .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig : mosaic ] and table  [ table : observation ] , we observed abell 2199 with suzaku in the beginning of october 2006 .",
    "the observation was conducted in 5 separate pointings ( `` center '' and `` offset1 '' through `` offset4 '' ) , for @xmath1 ks each , with the xis field of view ( fov ) partially overlapping . throughout the 5 pointings ,",
    "all the xis sensors were in normal clock mode without window or burst options .",
    "these observations became one of the first ones in which spaced - row charge injection ( sci ) was applied to the xis detectors ( nakajima et al .",
    "2008 ) . in the present paper",
    ", we use data of xis0 , xis1 , xis3 and the hxd - pin . although xis2 was still operational",
    ", we do not use its data because a database of non x - ray background ( nxb ) for sci - on xis2 is too small , which is available only until the anomaly in xis  2 on 2009 november 9 .    between the offset2 and offset4 observations , operations of changing the hxd - pin bias voltage",
    "were carried out in response to flare - like events in a pin diode ( w10p0 ) .",
    "as summarized in table  [ table : hv - ope ] , data of all the 64 pins were available throughout the center and offset1 pointings , and for a part of offset2 and offset4 .",
    "in contrast , only one fourth of the pin diodes were operational in offset3 .",
    "therefore , we do not analyze the offset3 hxd - pin data in the present paper .",
    "for the other observations , we exclude the data of the four pin diodes in w10 unit , and use the remaining 60 channels .",
    "backgrounds and responses excluding the four pin diodes were prepared with a help of the hxd team .",
    "the present paper utilizes the xis and hxd - pin data , prepared through version 2.0 pipe - line data processing , and obtained from the suzaku ftp site .",
    "we re - processed unscreened xis event files using suzaku software version 11 in heasoft 6.6 , together with the calibration datebase ( caldb ) released on 2009 january 9 .",
    "we applied ` xiscoord ` , ` xisputpixelquality ` , ` xispi ` , and ` xistime ` in this order , and performed the standard event screening .",
    "bad pixels were rejected with ` cleansis ` , employing the option of chipcol = segment .",
    "we selected events with grade 0,2,3,4 , and 6 .",

    "as an input to the arf generator , we prepared an x - ray surface brightness profile of abell  2199 using a double-@xmath22 model ( sum of two @xmath22 models ; @xcite ) of which the parameters were determined through a least chi - square fit to the background subtracted and vignetting corrected 0.510 kev xmm - newton mos1 image of the abell  2199 cluster .",
    "the employed parameters are ( @xmath23 , @xmath22)@xmath24(@xmath25 kpc , @xmath26 ) for the narrower component and ( @xmath27 kpc , @xmath28 ) for the wider component , where @xmath23 is the core radius . absorption below 2 kev , caused by a carbon - dominated contamination material on the xis optical blocking filters , is included in the arfs .",
    "there , differences of the contaminant thickness among the xis sensors are taken into account , along with its radial dependences and secular changes ( @xcite ) .",
    "non x - ray background ( nxb ) of each xis sensor was created using ` xisnxbgen ` , which sorts spectra of night earth observations according to the geomagnetic cut - off - rigidity ( cor ) and makes an averaged spectrum weighted by residence times for which suzaku stayed in each cor interval ( @xcite ) .",

    "the x - ray background was estimated as described in subsection  [ subsection : bgd : xis ] .",

    "for the center , offset1 , offset2 , and offset4 pointings , we made special hxd - pin rmfs which exclude contributions of the four pins in w10 unit .",
    "this was constructed by summing rmfs from the remaining 60 pin diodes .",
    "since ` hxdarfgen ` did not support extended sources yet , we created pin arfs for each @xmath29 pixel by ` hxdarfgen ` , assuming the same x - ray surface brightness as used for xis arfs ( subsection  [ subsection : obs : xis ] ) .",
    "the arfs were then averaged by weighting with counts contained in the corresponding pixels .",
    "as the hxd - pin nxb , the `` tuned '' pin nxb files published by the hxd team were used ( @xcite ) . in the present paper , we used 2.3% as systematic error ( 90% confidence range ) of the pin nxb .",
    "details of its derivation is described in appendix  [ appen : nxb - sys ] .",
    "the pin cxb was estimated from an observation of a nearby region in the same manner as the xis cxb ( subsection  [ subsection : bgd : pin ] ) .",
    "to analyze the xis data of an extended object in general , we must subtract the cosmic x - ray background ( cxb ) and galactic foreground emission ( gfe ) .",
    "since the emission from abell  2199 itself hampers their direct estimation using our own data , we used 73.6 ks suzaku observation of a nearby blank sky region named `` high latitude diffuse a '' ( hereafter hld ; observation i d = 500027010 ) , which is @xmath30 away from abell  2199 .",
    "the difference of their galactic latitudes is only @xmath31 , and hence the hydrogen column densities ( @xcite , weighted average over @xmath32 cone radius ) toward abell  2199 ( @xmath33 cm@xmath14 ) and hld ( @xmath35 cm@xmath14 ) are similar .    after applying the standard processing described in subsection  [ subsection : obs : xis ] to the unscreened xis data of hld , we removed circular regions ( @xmath36 in radius ) around six point sources that are visible in the 0.510.0 kev xis images , and extracted spectra of the remaining region from the four xis detectors .",
    "the corresponding detection limit for the point sources is @xmath37 erg s@xmath9 cm@xmath14 in 210 kev .",
    "then , the nxb - subtracted xis - bi and xis - fi ( averaged over the three xis - fi detectors ) spectra in energy ranges of 0.35.5 kev and 0.55.5 kev , respectively , were fitted simultaneously with a cxb+gfe model ( see below ) using xspec12 version 12.4.0ad , incorporating the xis response for a source of uniform brightness . in the analyses described below",
    ", metal abundances refer to anders & grevesse ( 1989 ) , and the photoelectric absorption cross - sections to balucinska - church & mccammon ( 1992 ) with a new he cross section ( @xcite ) .    as the cxb model",
    ", we used a power law with a fixed photon index of 1.41 ( @xcite ) and a free normalization . to represent the gfe",
    ", we employed model 1 of @xcite , which consists of three _ apec _ components ( @xcite ) : a non - absorbed 0.08 kev component , an absorbed 0.11 kev one , and an absorbed 0.27 kev one , representing the emission from local bubble ( lb ) , a cool halo , and a hot halo , respectively .",
    "the three _ apec _ temperatures were all fixed .",
    "the hydrogen column density was fixed to the galatic value of @xmath35  cm@xmath14 , and the metal abundance and redshift were also fixed to one solar and zero , respectively .",
    "relative normalizations of the two halo components were tied as cool halo : hot halo @xmath38 ( @xcite ) .",
    "thus , the gfe model has only two free parameters ; normalizations of the lb and halo . as summarized in table  [",
    "table : fit - bgd ] , this cxb+gfe model reproduced the xis spectra from hld successfully .",
    "the 2.010.0 kev surface brightness of the cxb component is @xmath39 erg s@xmath9 cm@xmath14 sr@xmath9 ( 90% statistical and systematic errors ) , where the systematic error , 10% , refers to appendix 1 of @xcite . using asca",
    ", @xcite derived an absolute 2.010.0 kev cxb surface brightness to be @xmath40 erg s@xmath9 cm@xmath14 sr@xmath9 ( 90% statistical and systematic errors ) .",
    "this value becomes @xmath41  @xmath42 erg s@xmath9 cm@xmath14 sr@xmath9 when the surface brightness is integrated to our detection limit of @xmath43 erg s@xmath9 cm@xmath14 ( equation 6 of @xcite ) .",
    "thus , the cxb level obtained from the hld observation is consistent with the asca result .",
    "we also analyzed the hxd - pin data of the hld observation which were processed by the same standard procedure as described in subsection  [ subsection : obs : pin ] . ignoring the gfe which is negligible at @xmath44 kev",
    ", we fitted the nxb - subtracted @xmath45@xmath46 kev hxd - pin spectrum with a wide - band cxb model .",
    "namely , following the heao-1 result ( @xcite ) , we expressed the cxb spectral surface brightness as @xmath47 where @xmath48 , a normalization , is a free parameter in the fit .",
    "when reproducing the cxb signals in hxd - pin , equation  [ eqn : pin - cxb ] was corrected for the 13% systematic difference of cross - normalization between the xis and pin .",
    "the result we obtained , @xmath49 , is consistent with the heao result of @xmath50 , which can in turn reproduce , within 1% , blank - sky pin spectra which have higher statistics ( @xcite ) .",
    "the contribution of the six point sources to the hxd - pin spectrum is an order of magnitude lower than the nxb - subtracted signal in 1240 kev .",
    "therefore , the contribution of point sources affects the cxb level only by @xmath51 , which is much smaller than the statistical error .",
    "although we have thus adopted the two separate models to estimate the cxb in the xis and hxd - pin , the derived two surface brightness results agree within 1% in the connecting energy range of 6.012.0 kev .",
    "therefore , our two modelings of the cxb are consistent .",
    "if we constrain the two cxb models so that the 6.012.0 kev surface brightness becomes the same , and fit the xis and hxd - pin spectra simultaneously , we can constrain the cxb above 10 kev better with @xmath52 .",
    "this case is shown in figure  [ fig : hld - spec ] .      in the following spectral analysis ,",
    "we fit the abell  2199 data simultaneously with the hld data , in order to determine the x - ray background .",
    "however , the true x - ray background of the abell  2199 field may be different from that of the hld field . in order to examine the gfe brightness for possible differences between them , we employed x - ray count rates of these two fields from the rosat all - sky survey ( rass ) which are available via the nasa s heasarc website .",
    "since the rass data right on the abell  2199 field is contaminated , of course , with the cluster emission , we obtained a count rate averaged over an annular region of which the inner radius is @xmath53 ( @xmath54 mpc ) and the outer radius is @xmath55 , centered on the cd galaxy ngc  6166 . since the virial radius of abell  2199",
    "is estimated to be @xmath56 mpc ( @xmath57 ) from the icm temperature of 4 kev ( @xcite ) , this annular region can be considered to be free from the icm emission .",
    "table  [ table : rass - cnt ] summarizes the rass count rates of the abell  2199 annular region and the hld field ( circular region , @xmath53 in radius ) .",
    "the 3/4 kev ( 0.471.21 kev ) and 1.5 kev ( 0.762.04 kev ) rates are the same between the two fields within statistical errors .",
    "thus , the hld region is confirmed to be a good background estimator for our abell  2199 observations in these energy bands .",
    "the 1/4 kev ( 0.120.284 kev ) band rates differ by @xmath1% , suggesting a spectral difference betweeen the abell  2199 and hld fields in the softest energy band . however , the lb component , which dominates the spectrum in the 1/4 kev band , is poorly determined with the xis spectra , and the 20% discrepancy is within the statistical error of @xmath58% associated with the lb normalization in the following spectral analysis (   [ subsection : results : xis - ana ] ) .",
    "the cxb surface brightness is known to fluctuate from direction to direction ( @xcite ) . in the case of suzaku",
    ", this fluctuation is estimated to be 10% and 18% for the xis ( full fov ) and pin , respectively ( see appendix of @xcite for details ) .",
    "we take these systematic errors into account in the spectral analyses described in section  [ section : results ] .",
    "in order to quantify the thermal emission of abell  2199 , we defined seven concentric annular regions as shown in figure  [ fig : mosaic ] , each with a radial width of @xmath59 .",
    "the center is chosen to be the x - ray emission centroid at ( @xmath60)=(@xmath61 ) in j2000.0 coordinates .",
    "this is @xmath62 offset from the nucleus of the cd galaxy , ngc  6166 , but well inside its optical extent of @xmath63 in diameter .    in analyzing a given annulus",
    ", we extracted xis - fi ( averaged over xis 0 and xis 3 ) and xis - bi spectra from corresponding regions in the five pointings ( but excluding those which have no intersection ) , and subtracted the nxb as described in subsection  [ subsection : obs : xis ] .",
    "for each annulus , the utilized observations are given in table  [ table : fit - reg ] .",
    "then , the spectra from the same annulus ( but different fields of view ) were read into xspec together with the nxb - subtracted hld spectra to constrain the x - ray background .",
    "the annular spectra were fitted simultaneously with a common _ vapec _ model with a free photoelectric absorption , together with the x - ray background model described in subsection  [ subsection : bgd : xis ] , incorporating the responses created for the abell  2199 icm emission ( subsection  [ subsection : obs : xis ] ) and for a uniform x - ray source , respectively .",
    "all the parameters of the x - ray background model were tied between the annular and hld spectra , except for the thickness of xis contamination which depends on the date of observation ( @xcite ) . among the different observations of abell  2199 ,",
    "all the _ vapec _ parameters , except the overall normalization , were constrained to be the same .",
    "the cross normalization between xis - fi and xis - bi was set free .",
    "metal abundances , @xmath64 , in the _ vapec _ model were tied in three groups as @xmath65 , @xmath66 , and @xmath67 .",
    "an example of this fitting in the @xmath68@xmath59 region is shown in figure  [ fig : xis_hld - spec ] .",
    "we also changed the normalization of cxb model by @xmath69% and studied the effect of cxb fluctuation described in subsection  [ subsection : bgd : sys ] . although the x - ray background model is determined separately for the seven individual regions , the normalizations of cxb , lb , and halo are consistent among the regions within errors ( see figure  [ fig : bgd - norm ] in appendix  [ appen : bgd - norm ] ) .",
    "the results of this analysis are summarized in figure  [ fig : vapec - prof ] ( for details , see table  [ table : fit - apec ] in appendix  [ appen : fit - result ] ) .",
    "the single - temperature _ vapec _ model thus reproduced the spectra successfully , and the cxb fluctuation did not affect the results significantly .",
    "the temperature and iron abundance were determined out to @xmath70 kpc , which is about 0.4 times the virial radius of a @xmath71 kev cluster .",
    "the temperature gradually decreases toward cluster outskirts from @xmath6 kev to @xmath72 kev .",
    "the temperature within @xmath4 , @xmath6 kev , is consistent with that derived with asca ( 4.1 kev ; @xcite ) .",
    "the iron and silicon abundances also decrease outwards by a factor of @xmath3 , while the oxygen abundance tends to be flat .",
    "the hydrogen column density obtained from the fit became ( @xmath73@xmath74 cm@xmath14 , which is significantly higher than the galacitic value .",
    "we examine the cause of this effect in subsection  [ subsection : results : soft - excess ] .",
    "the 0.5  10 kev x - ray luminosity integrated out to @xmath7 is @xmath8 erg s@xmath9 , which is consistent with the result of xmm - newton ( @xcite ) .",
    "next , we attempted a two - temperature fit using a model expressed as _ vapec_+_vapec_. metal abundances of the two components were tied together .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig:2vapec - prof]a and figure  [ fig:2vapec - prof]f ( for details , see table  [ table : fit-2apec ] in appendix  [ appen : fit - result ] ) , the spectra in the innermost region ( @xmath68@xmath59 ) were reproduced better with the two - temperature model of 2  kev and 5  kev , while the improvement was not significant in the other regions .",
    "this is reasonable , because @xcite detected , with chandra , a temperature drop from 5  kev to 2  kev toward the center within a central region of radius 100 kpc ( @xmath75 ) .",
    "the iron and silicon abundance profiles did not change significantly between the single - temperature and two - temperature models .",
    "however , the oxygen abundance in the inntermost region decreased and the profile became flatter .",
    "the high values of @xmath76 , found with the single - temperature analysis , persisted ; this effect can not be regarded as an artifact caused by an inappropriate temperature modeling .",
    "a soft excess may manifest itself as a hydrogen column density @xmath76 that is significantly lower than the galactic hi columnn density toward the abell  2199 field ( weighted - averaged value over @xmath32 radius from ngc  6166 ) , @xmath77 cm@xmath14 from @xcite or @xmath78 cm@xmath14 from @xcite .",
    "the measured values of @xmath76 in figure  [ fig : vapec - prof ] and figure  [ fig:2vapec - prof ] , however , are factor of @xmath73@xmath79 _ higher _ than the galactic value in all regions . while this result generally argues against the presence of any flux excess in lower energies , we need to understand the nature of the higher absorption before discussing the soft excess issue",
    ". there are five possibilities to explain this effect : ( 1 ) excess absorption within the abell  2199 system , ( 2 ) an overestimate of the background which was subtracted , ( 3 ) inadequate modeling of the icm emission , ( 4 ) presence of high metallicity clouds at the direction of abell  2199 , and ( 5 ) underestimate of the xis contaminant thickness which is included in the arf .",
    "the first possibility is unlikely , because the measured @xmath76 is high even in the outer regions such as @xmath4@xmath80 .",
    "the second alternative is rejected , because we already incorporated the uncertainties of nxb and cxb in the analysis , and because within @xmath81 , the background level is more than an order of magnitude lower than the signal below 1 kev band .",
    "the third is also unrealistic , because the values of @xmath76 remained unchanged between the single- and two - temperature modelings .",
    "the forth is probably unphysical because metal abundances in such clouds would have to be as large as @xmath72 solar in order to explain the excess x - ray absorption , while keeping @xmath76 to the galactic hi value .",
    "then , we focus on the last possibility .    when we obtain @xmath76",
    "separately with xis - fi and xis - bi in the three inntermost regions where the values of @xmath76 are constrained well ( figure  [ fig : vapec - prof](b ) ) , the results with xis - fi become systematically higher than those with xis - bi by @xmath1% .",
    "this difference suggests an instrumental cause such as ( 5 ) .",
    "then , we evaluated an excess thickness of contaminant , assuming ( 5 ) is the cause of the high @xmath76 .",
    "we included an additional absorption by the xis contamination in the single temperature model as _",
    "vapec@xmath82phabs@xmath82varabs_. here , the _ varabs _ factor represents the additional absorption which is added to that already included in the arf , and can handle separately column densities of elements from hydrogen to nickel .",
    "the _ varabs _ column densities of all the elements except carbon and oxygen were fixed to zero , and the relative column - number - density ratio of carbon to oxygen was fixed to @xmath83 ( @xcite ) . by introducing the additional _ varabs _ factor , the best - fit model parameters did not change significantly except @xmath76 in _ phabs_. figure  [ fig : conf - contour ] shows the confidence contours between @xmath76 in _ phabs _ and the additional carbon column density @xmath84 in _ varabs_. as easily expected , these two quantities correlate negatively with each other , and we can not determine the true @xmath76 accurately .",
    "fixing @xmath76 at the galactic hi value in figure  [ fig : conf - contour ] ( dotted magenta lines ) yields @xmath85 cm@xmath14 ( dashed cyan lines in figure  [ fig : conf - contour ] ) , which is comparable to an upper limit allowed by its systematic uncertainty .",
    "therefore , we may regard the excess absorption observed in figure  [ fig : vapec - prof]b and figure  [ fig:2vapec - prof]b as due to an underestimation of the xis contaminant by @xmath85 cm@xmath14 , and presume that @xmath76 is equal to the galactic hi value . from figure",
    "[ fig : conf - contour ] of the innermost annuli , we can reject any @xmath76 value which is significantly lower than the galactic hi value ( dotted magenta lines in figure  [ fig : conf - contour ] ) , because the extra carbon thickness must be @xmath86 cm@xmath14 .",
    "in figure  [ fig : resi - spec ] , we show data - to - model ratios in the 0.31.0 kev range , when the data are fitted by the single temperature _ vapec _ model with @xmath87 cm@xmath14 and @xmath88 cm@xmath14 both fixed . the value of @xmath84 is thus set to the allowed maximum , and",
    "the combination of @xmath84 and @xmath76 means a slight ( @xmath89 ) overestimate of the overall absorption specified by the data in figure  [ fig : conf - contour ] of the innermost annulus .",
    "furthermore , the data are divided by the single - temperature model which was determined over a wide band of @xmath90@xmath91 kev .",
    "therefore , soft excess emission , if any , should be seen in these ratio spectra .",
    "however , no significant systematic excess is seen therein . then , to obtain an upper limit on the soft excess due to a thermal warm gas",
    ", we added to the model a 0.2 kev _ apec _ component with 0.2 solar metallicity , following the result of @xcite .",
    "the derived 90% upper limit on surface brightness of the 0.2 kev component is summarized in table  [ table : warm - upper ] . in table",
    "[ table : warm - upper ] , we also give xis upper limits when a power law with photon index of 2.0 is added to the model .",

    "subsection : results : hard - excess ] , we independently constrain such a power law component using the hxd - pin data .    as a cross confirmation , we repeated the same analysis by choosing @xmath94 and @xmath95 cm@xmath14 , the latter suggested by figure  [ fig : vapec - prof ] .",

    "[ fig : pin - spec ] , we show a 1540 kev nxb - subtracted hxd - pin spectrum summed over center , offset1 , offset2 , and offset4 . by this summation , the statistical error associated with the 1540 kev hxd - pin signal reduced to @xmath96% of the nxb , which is considerably smaller than the systematic nxb error of @xmath97% ( 90% confidence range ) adopted in the present paper .    after subtracting the nxb ,",
    "the hxd - pin signal ( black crosses in figure  [ fig : pin - spec ] ) was thus detected significantly up to @xmath98 kev . for comparison",
    ", we also show in figure  [ fig : pin - spec ] spectra of the cxb and the thermal emission . here , the thermal emission was modeled by summing the single temprature _ vapec _",
    "models determined for individual annular regions . as to thermal emission outside the xis fov which contributes @xmath99% , we assumed that the surface brightness obeys the double-@xmath22 profile which was described in   [ subsection : obs : xis ] , and that the temperature and metal abundances therein is the same as those in the outermost region covered by the xis .",
    "after the nominal xis vs. hxd - pin cross normalization ( @xcite , see also a suzaku calibration document named suzakumemo-2007 - 11 ) , the model normalization of the thermal component was multiplied by a factor of 1.13 when calculating its predicted contribution to the hxd - pin data",
    ". using this cross normalization , intensities of the two cxb models in 6.012.0 kev agree within 1% as described in ",
    "[ subsection : bgd : pin ] .",
    "this assures that the systematic errors associated with the cross normalization is @xmath100% , which is much smaller than the statistic erros in the hxd - pin spectrum .",
    "thus , the nxb - subtracted spectrum is consistent , within statistical errors , with a sum of the cxb and the extrapolated thermal emission ( cyan points in figure  [ fig : pin - spec ] ) .",
    "even when the nxb is set to the minimum that is allowed by the 90% systematic uncertainty range , the hxd - pin signal does not exceed the ( cxb+thermal ) emission significantly .",
    "thus , the hard x - ray excess was not detected .    in order to obtain an upper limit on hard excess emission",
    ", we lowered the nxb within its 90% systematic uncertainty , and also lowered the cxb model within its fluctuation of 18% ( 90%-confidence ) .",
    "the estimation of the cxb fluctuation is described in appendix  [ appen : cxb - sys ] .",
    "then , we fitted the nxb - subtracted spectrum with a power law ( with its photon index fixed at 2.0 and its normalization left free ) plus the fixed cxb and thermal models , and obtained upper limits . this very conservative method gave a 90%-confidence upper limit of @xmath15 erg s@xmath9 on the 2080 kev luminosity of the power - law component . if this component is uniformly distributed over a circular region of radius @xmath101 , the implied 0.210 kev luminosity per solid angle becomes @xmath102 erg s@xmath9 arcmin@xmath14 .",
    "this limit is comparable to those obtained with the xis using the softest specctral end .",
    "using the five pointing observations with suzaku , we measured the temperature and metal abundances of abell  2199 out to @xmath70 kpc ( 0.4 times virial radius ) , and searched the xis and hxd - pin data for soft and hard excess emissions , respectively , both above the thermal component .",
    "we however found no significant excess emissions in either energy bands , and derived their upper limits . over a broad energy band of @xmath103 kev to @xmath98 kev ,",
    "the emission is dominated by the thermal components with temperatures of a few kev .",
    "the upper limits on soft excess , expressed as the emission measure per unit solid angle from a 0.2 kev warm gas ( table  [ table : warm - upper ] ) , are more stringent , typically by more than a factor of 3 , than the reported positive detection by xmm - newton ( @xcite ) , @xmath104 @xmath13 arcmin@xmath14 .",
    "one likely cause of this inconsistency between suzaku and xmm - newton is confusion with solar wind charge exchange ( swcx ) emission , which has been observed with chandra ( @xcite ) , xmm - newton ( @xcite ) , and suzaku ( @xcite ) . in fact , proton flux near the earth , observed with wind - swe , enhanced by a factor of 34 for a part of the xmm - newton observatons compared with that of suzaku .",
    "the relevant proton light curves are shown in appendix  [ appen : proton - flux ] .",
    "similarly , in suzaku observations of outskirt regions of the coma cluster , takei et al .",
    "( 2008 ) found no significant excess o  vii or o  viii emissions which were previously reported with xmm - newton ( @xcite ) , and concluded that the excess emission is likely due to an enhancement in the swcx emission during the xmm - newton observations .",
    "the suzaku data have constrained the 2080 kev luminosity of any excess hard emission to be @xmath105 erg s@xmath9 , assuming that it has a power - law spectrum of photon index 2.0 and employing the most conservative estimates of the cxb . using the bepposax pds , @xcite detected non - thermal emission from abell  2199 at 2.1@xmath16 level , with 2080 kev luminosity of @xmath106 erg s@xmath9 ( 90%-confidence errors ) assuming a power - law spectrum of photon index 2.0 .",
    "this detection by the pds is not rejected by our result .",
    "however , the bepposax results , with a significance of only 2.1@xmath16 , would be considered as an upper limit , like the present result . in this case ,",
    "our upper limit is a factor of 1.7 more stringent than that of the pds . from a calibration analysis using the crab nebula , the 2080 kev flux derived from the pds",
    "is known to be systematically lower by 21% than that derived from hxd - pin ( @xcite ) .",
    "if we take into account this systematic effect , the difference in the upper limits between hxd - pin and pds increases to a factor of 2.1 .",
    "considering the difference between the fovs of hxd - pin ( @xmath107 in fwhm ) and pds ( @xmath108 in fwhm ) , the claimed detection by the pds becomes consistent with our upper limit if the excess hard x - ray emission is much more extended than the hxd - pin fov .",
    "however , the total fov of hxd - pin in our pointing observations ( @xmath109 mpc radius in fwhm ) mostly cover the whole cluster region , @xmath110 times the virial radius of abell  2199 ( @xmath56 mpc , see ",
    "[ subsection : bgd : sys ] ) .",
    "therefore , to reconcile the two results , we would have to assume that the emission is spatially distributed much beyond the virial radius .    according to kempner & sarazin ( 2000 ) , a radio synchrotron flux density at 327 mhz , @xmath111 , expected from abell  2199 ,",
    "is related to the 10100 kev ic x - ray flux , @xmath112 , as @xmath113 assuming the photon index of the hard x - ray emission to be 1.81 . here , @xmath114 is the cluster magnetic field , and @xmath115 is the observed frequency .",
    "the upper limit they quoted on the diffuse radio flux , @xmath116 jy at 327 mhz , and the hard x - ray emission detected by bepposax , required a very weak magnetic field ( @xmath19 g ) .",
    "however , given our non - detection of such an excess hard x - ray flux , this is no longer the case . when the hxd - pin data are used to constrain a power - law component with a photon index of 1.81 ( instead of 2.0 ) , its 10100 kev luminosity becomes @xmath117 erg cm@xmath14 s@xmath9 . as a result ,",
    "effectively any strength of magnetic field is allowed as shown in figure  [ fig : mag - limit ] .",
    "regardless of the magnetic field strength , the present result constrain the number of relativistic electrons in the system , so that their ic emission should not exceed the present hard x - ray upper limit .",
    "if we assume a power - law spectrum of synchrotron emission with a photon index 2.0 , the corresponding electron number spectrum has a power - law index 3.0 , and is written as @xcite @xmath118 where @xmath119 is the lorentz factor , @xmath120 is the total number of electrons , and @xmath121 is a lower - cutoff in @xmath119 which is conservatively estimated to be @xmath122 ( @xcite ) .",
    "these relativistic electrons produce ic emission with a 2080 kev luminosity of @xmath123 where @xmath124 is the redshift . from equation  [ eqn : hxr - lumi ] and our upper limit ,",
    "we obtain @xmath125 .",
    "then , the integrated electron kinetic energy @xmath126 for @xmath127 in abell  2199 becomes @xmath128 where @xmath129 is the electron mass .",
    "since electrons with @xmath130 , which contribute to the @xmath131@xmath132 kev ic emission , have a liftime of @xmath133 yr in typical icm conditions ( @xcite ) , the acceleration luminosity in abell  2199 can be constrained as @xmath134 erg s@xmath9 .",
    "this upper limit is rather loose , and is three times higher than the 0.510 kev luminosity of the thermal emission .",
    "if we assume that the magnetic field of abell  2199 is @xmath135 g as suggested by faraday rotation measurements ( @xcite ) , the radio upper limit gives the dominant constraint on the relativistic electrons , with the predicted @xmath112 two orders of magnitude below the present upper limit ( figure  [ fig : mag - limit ] ) . in this case , the constraint of acceleration luminosity becomes @xmath136 erg s@xmath9 which is about an order of magnitude lower than the 0.510 kev luminosity .",
    "the total mass of abell  2199 is @xmath137 when integrated to 0.8 mpc ( @xcite ) .",
    "if abell  2199 was formed via a major merger between two clusters with similar masses @xmath138 ( @xmath139 each ) at a relative speed of @xmath140 km s@xmath9 , the kinetic energy deposited onto the merged system becomes @xmath141 since shocks produced in cluster mergers are thought to last typically @xmath142 yr ( @xcite ) , the energy input rate to non - thermal electrons becomes @xmath143 erg s@xmath9 , where @xmath144 is the fraction of energies given to them .",
    "values of @xmath145 erg s@xmath9 are also expected from theoretical models of merging clusters such as coma ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "then , our upper limit on the acceleration luminosity is an order of magnitude lower than @xmath146 , assuming @xmath147 .",
    "we hence infer that abell  2199 have been free from major merger events for more than @xmath148 yr , which is a typical time scale on which the ic emission decays ( @xcite ) .",

    "@xmath149 systematic erros of pin 1540 kev band , using earth occultation data and e0102 - 72 observations which has been regularly scheduled for the xis calibration , is 2.3% ( @xcite ) . since the statistical error is 1.8% ( @xmath149 ) , the systematic uncertainty of the pin nxb model in 1540 kev band is estimated to @xmath97% in 90% confidence region .",
    "the cxb has uncertainty because the number of unresolved faint sources in fov statistically fluctuate .",
    "this cxb fluctuation scales as @xmath150 , where @xmath151 is the fov and @xmath152 is the detection threshold flux for point sources ( @xcite ) . by scaling from the cxb fluctuation of heao - i , 2.8% for @xmath153 deg@xmath154 and",
