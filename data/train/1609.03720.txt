    "since the discovery of the time reversal ( tr ) invariant topological insulator ( ti ) in two dimensions ( 2d ) and three dimensions ( 3d ) @xcite , the topological aspects of the electronic band structures have become important benchmarks to characterize electronic phases in condensed matter physics .",
    "the unique feature of tis lies in their properties of being insulating in the bulk , and yet their surfaces being metallic due to the existence of surface states .",
    "the surface states result from the nontrivial topology of the bulk band structure and are robust against perturbations that respect symmetries of the system .",
    "more recently , it is further realized that even if the band structure of the materials are gapless , non - trivial topology of the gapless points ( nodal points ) may also result in topologically protected surface states@xcite .    among the class of topological gapless materials , the dirac semimetal and the weyl semimetal are the simplest type , characterized by the presence of nodal points at which two distinct bands touch each@xcite .",
    "for the dirac semimetal , the low - energy hamiltonian near isolated dirac nodes can be described by the dirac equation with both of time - reversal symmetry and inversion symmetry being preserved and it can be realized in both the 2d and 3d systems , such as graphene ( 2d ) @xcite and @xmath1 ( 3d ) @xcite . in contrast , the time - reversal symmetry or inversion symmetry is explicitly broken in the weyl semimetal , and the hamiltonian around the weyl nodes is described by the weyl hamiltonian given by @xmath2 with @xmath3 being the pauli matrices and @xmath4 being the momentum deviation from the weyl point , and @xmath5 denotes the chirality .",
    "the absence of the time - reversal symmetry or the inversion symmetry results in the separation of the weyl nodes either in momentum or in energy .",
    "in addition , it results in the non - trivial topology ( chirality ) carried by the weyl nodes , which is characterized by the monopole charges @xmath6 defined as the integral of the berry curvature @xmath7 over the surface enclosing the node , @xmath8 @xcite . due to the topological nature of @xmath6 ,",
    "weyl fermions in these materials are robust to small perturbations@xcite . for large perturbations",
    ", it is known that localized states may arise near point defects@xcite and weyl points can even appear or disappear in pairs with opposite monopole charges . in the simple weyl semimetals , each weyl point carries @xmath9 or @xmath10 , which has been first realized experimentally in @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "the possibility of the multi - weyl nodes with @xmath12 has also been proposed @xcite recently .",
    "instead of being the usual linear weyl nodes carrying @xmath13 monopole charge , the multi - weyl nodes , protected by @xmath14 or @xmath15 rotation symmetry , have nonlinear dispersion and higher monopole charge .",
    "the lowest non - trivial example is the double - weyl semimetal with @xmath16 , which is suggested to be realized in the 3d semimetal @xmath17 @xcite .",
    "the double - weyl nodes possess quadratic dispersions in two direction , e.g. , the @xmath18 plane and linear dispersion in the third direction .",
    "furthermore , it is known that due to larger chiral charges @xmath6 in presence , the unusual phenomena ( such as the quantum anomalous hall conductivity , the chiral anomaly , and the number of fermi arcs ) associated with the linear weyl nodes are doubly enhanced @xcite .",
    "while the above mentioned properties are valid for noninteracting weyl semimetals , it is known that the non - trivial topology in electronic structure is driven by the spin - orbit interaction , which inevitably involves heavy elements .",
    "the correlation effects due to interactions are therefore present and it is necessary to examine effects of interactions on properties of the weyl semimetals . for topological insulators , the coulomb interaction is usually screened and becomes short - ranged .",
    "studies indicate that topological transitions may be induced so that nontrivial topological phases may be broken into topologically trivial phases by sufficiently strong short - range correlation@xcite . on the other hand , for the dirac / weyl semimetals",
    ", the long - range coulomb interaction is shown to be marginally irrelevant and induces logarithmic corrections in response functions@xcite . in the strong coupling limit , however , the semimetals could be turned into either a mott insulator if the nodal point is anisotropic @xcite or a charge density wave ( cdw ) state@xcite . since in typical materials that realize dirac / weyl semimetals , localized electronic orbits , such as @xmath19 orbits in @xmath20 of @xmath21 ,",
    "are often involved , the onsite coulomb energy in the materials usually dominates .",
    "therefore , it would be interesting and necessary to investigate effects of short - ranged coulomb interaction on the weyl semimetal .    in this paper",
    ", we examine phases of the weyl semimetal in the presence of the onsite coulomb interaction in a hubbard model .",
    "similar to effects of disorders@xcite , in the weak interacting regime , it is found that the weyl semimetal is paramagnetic without magnetic orders .",
    "the electronic structure is similar to that of the non - interacting weyl fermions with parameters be renormalized . as the on - site interaction increases and",
    "is strong enough , the weyl semimetal becomes magnetic . in the strong interaction limit of a hubbard model , we find that the a - afm phase and the ssdw phase are two generic phases . in the ssdw phase",
    ", each weyl node is tuned into a double - weyl node with the corresponding charge being @xmath0 . as the spin - orbit coupling increases",
    ", a first - order phase transition occurs with the ssdw phase being turned into an a - afm phase and at the same time , double - weyl nodes are disintegrated into two pairs of linear weyl nodes .",
    "our results reveal the unusual interplay between the topology of electronic structures and magnetism in strongly correlated phases of weyl semimetals and pave a way for realizing the double - weyl semimetal based on a linear weyl semimetals .",

    "the system has a @xmath14 rotation symmetry , and the nonzero @xmath35 would break the space inversion symmetry with respect to the @xmath43 plane , while the @xmath36 term breaks the time - reversal symmetry .",

    ", the ground state of the two - band model could be either in a topological trivial phase or the weyl semimetal phase .",
    "when @xmath22 is switched on and is small , the free energy gain due to magnetic orders is also small .",

    "the electronic structure is similar to that of the non - interacting weyl fermions with parameters be just renormalized . as @xmath22 increases and is strong enough , the weyl semimetal starts to become magnetic .",
    "the increase of @xmath22 trends to first stabilize the a - afm xy phase due to its commensurate nature . as @xmath22 becomes large , the dzyaloshinskii - moriya interaction",
    "is induced so that the spiral spin density wave ( ssdw ) state start to emerge . only in the strong on - site",
    "@xmath22 limit , both the ssdw state and a - afm phase are stabilized .    in the strong @xmath22 limit",
    ", we have derived an extended @xmath58 model . the mean - field phase diagram in the large - u limit of hubbard model",
    "is established .",
    "we show that due to the dzyaloshinskii - moriya interaction induced by the spin - orbit interaction , the a - afm phase and the ssdw phase are two generic magnetic phases . as the spin - orbit coupling increases",
    ", a quantum phase transition occurs with the ssdw phase being turned into an a - afm phase .",
    "in addition , it is shown that the topology of the electronic structure also undergoes changes as the magnetic phase changes . in the a - afm phase ,",
    "number of linear weyl nodes increases due to the folding of brillouin zone , while for the ssdw phase , linear weyl nodes combine and are turned into double - weyl nodes carrying monopole charge @xmath230 .",
    "it should be noted that , while in the small @xmath22 regime , the weyl semimetal can be either in the paramagnetic ( pm ) phase or the a - afm phase with spin in the @xmath18 plane .",
    "however , these phases can not leads to a significant change in the topological properties of the weyl semimetal .",
    "the increase of @xmath22 trends to stabilize the spiral spin density wave ( ssdw ) state and a - afm phase and increase the magnetic energy gain .",
    "the strong magnetization can lead to the significant change in the topological properties of weyl semimetal .",
    "our findings thus pave a new way to build a double - weyl semimetal from the weyl semimetal .",
    "while so far in this work we only consider weyl semimetals with two linear weyl nodes located along the @xmath23 axis , due to the rotational invariance of hubbard interaction , we expect that the results are applicable to pairs of weyl nodes located along other axes . in general , number of linear weyl nodes",
    "may exceed two .",
    "our results are applicable to any pair of linear weyl nodes located along some axis passing through the @xmath150 point .",
    "thus , we expect our findings of the unusual interplay between the topology of electronic structures and magnetism are applicable to weyl semimetals with more than two weyl nodes .",
    "even though our results are based on the mean - field theory , the weyl points in the electronic structures have topological origin , which is reflected as their origin from the band inversion along the @xmath23 axis .",
    "hence it is expected that the topological electronic structures of nodes are robust even if magnetic fluctuations are included . in real materials ,",
    "the exact electronic structures depends on detailed crystal symmetries and may show different detailed structures .",
    "nonetheless , our results offer an important direction to look for in the interplay between magnetic phases and electronic structures and are left for future experimental confirmations .",
