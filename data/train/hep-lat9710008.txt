    "@xmath196 , there is substantial overlap and level crossing between the glueball and meson states in the strong - coupling region , and the picture becomes more confused .",
    "the series approximants show an initial rise for the glueball masses in the strong - coupling region , followed by an apparent turnover , at least in the @xmath197 case , but the convergence is not sufficient to track the behaviour reliably into the weak - coupling region .",
    "strong - coupling series for the meson states discussed in section ii have been calculated to @xmath198 ( or to @xmath199 for @xmath164 ) .",
    "the first three terms for arbitrary @xmath43 are    @xmath200 + o(y^6)\\\\ m_2 & = & m_4= 1 + 2 \\mu + 10 y^2/(1 + 2 \\mu ) - y^4 ( 283 + 42\\mu + 12\\mu^2 + 8\\mu^3)/[3(1 + 2\\mu)^3 ] + o(y^6)\\\\ m_3 & = &   1 + 2 \\mu + 6 y^2/(1 + 2",
    "\\mu ) + y^4 ( -175 + 6\\mu + 36\\mu^2 - 8\\mu^3)/[3(1 + 2\\mu)^3 ] + o(y^6)\\\\ m_5 & = & m_6 = 1 + 2 \\mu + 6 y^2/(1 + 2",
    "\\mu ) - y^4 ( 199 + 66\\mu + 12\\mu^2 + 8\\mu^3)/[3(1 + 2\\mu)^3 ] + o(y^6)\\\\ m_7 & = & m_8 = 1 + 2 \\mu + 6 y^2/(1 + 2",
    "\\mu ) - y^4 ( 199 + 66\\mu + 12\\mu^2 + 8\\mu^3)/[3(1 + 2\\mu)^3]+o(y^6)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    further terms at selected values of @xmath43 are given in table v.    figure 11 graphs the various meson masses as functions of @xmath176 , at a fixed , large mass parameter @xmath201 .",
    "it can be seen that the series approximants for these masses do not converge below about @xmath202 . for the lowest vector meson states",
    "there is a suggestion that the mass reaches a peak at @xmath202 , and then turns downward .",
    "a crude linear extrapolation has been made to estimate the continuum limit , but the uncertainly in the estimate is large .",
    "the resulting values for the vector mass are graphed as a function of @xmath43 in figure 12 , along with the schwinger - dyson estimates of allen and burden@xcite , and the non - relativistic prediction@xcite .",
    "it can be seen that the lattice estimates of the positronium binding energy have large errors , especially at smaller @xmath43 , and lie about three times higher than the schwinger - dyson values .",
    "neither the schwinger - dyson nor the lattice estimates show any definite evidence of the logarithmic increase at large @xmath43 predicted by the non - relativistic theory .",
    "figure 13 shows the masses as functions of @xmath176 for the massless case @xmath75 .",
    "once again , convergence is lost at rather small @xmath65 values , around @xmath203 , and it is hardly possible to make useful estimates of the continuum limit .",
    "there is no sign of any of the masses dropping towards zero , or acting like a goldstone boson .",
    "this is because the expected goldstone boson states are the `` axiscalar '' and `` axipseudoscalar '' states@xcite , which are not among the single - link excitations in the strong - coupling limit which we have treated here ( see section iid ) .",
    "the goldstone bosons probably correspond to l - shaped double - link excitations , which will transform into each other under a single plaquette excitation",
    ". it would be interesting to study their behaviour , but we have not yet attempted such a study , owing to technical complications .",
    "new strong - coupling series have been presented for the ground - state energy and chiral condensate , along with the ` glueball ' and positronium masses , in 4-component hamiltonian lattice qed@xmath204 with full dynamical fermions .",
    "this represents the first attempt at a series calculation for the positronium states in this model .",
    "two major features are evident from these results .",
    "firstly , there is a very clear separation of scales between the ` glueballs ' and the positronium states as the continuum limit is approached . at large fermion mass @xmath43 ,",
    "the positronium energies remain finite in the continuum limit , while the ` glueball ' masses scale exponentially towards zero , presumably corresponding in the limit to massless photon states .",
    "the same thing appears to happen at smaller @xmath43 values , although our evidence for the exponential decrease of the glueball mass is rather slim .",
    "this separation of scales is consistent with earlier discussions of the pure gauge model@xcite : in the nonrelativistic or static fermion limit , if one sticks to naive ` engineering ' dimension scales one will end up with a theory of free , massless photons as above , whereas if one renormalizes the scale as discussed by polyakov@xcite or gpfert and mack@xcite one will obtain a theory of free , _ massive _ bosons .",
    "the second feature is that the addition of dynamical fermions does not greatly affect the glueball masses at large @xmath43 : at @xmath195 , for instance , the only effect was a reduction of the glueball mass at fixed @xmath65 of order a percent or two . for @xmath205",
    "the effect is more pronounced , however .    in general",
    ", the results of these calculations were somewhat disappointing .",
    "the bulk ground - state energy per site converged well enough into the weak - coupling region to display a convincing match with analytic weak - coupling expansions@xcite , and the ` glueball ' masses converged well enough to justify the statements given above .",
    "other quantities , however , were not mapped out with such success .",
    "series approximants to the chiral condensate at @xmath75 only converged down to @xmath177 , and were unable to confirm or deny the rapid plunge in magnitude seen by burkitt and irving@xcite around @xmath170 .",
    "it will require more detailed monte carlo studies to confirm that this plunge really occurs , and to determine whether the chiral condensate then levels out at a small but finite value .",
    "series approximants to the positronium masses likewise only converged down to @xmath202 , even at large mass @xmath43 , making any extrapolations to the continuum limit very uncertain .",
    "our estimates of the continuum ` binding energy ' are thus of little more than qualitative accuracy .",
    "they lie about three times higher than the schwinger - dyson estimates of allen and burden@xcite , which are not expected to be very accurate at large mass @xmath43 in any case .",
    "neither set of results shows any definite sign of the logarithmic increase in energy with @xmath43 predicted by the non - relativistic analyses@xcite . once again",
    ", a detailed understanding of the positronium spectrum must await a more accurate study , by monte carlo or other methods .",
    "the question whether this model develops goldstone bosons in the massless limit @xmath75 was not explored .",
    "these ` axiscalar ' and ` axipseudoscalar ' states@xcite are not among the single - link excitations for which we have calculated strong - coupling expansions .",
    "they are most likely to be found among the ` double - link ' excitations .",
    "it is technically more difficult to calculate strong - coupling series for the double - link excitations ; but on the other hand , the series may well converge more quickly for these low - lying excitations",
    ". this might provide an interesting subject for further study .    in general",
    ", however , the prospects for further series calculations look dim .",
    "in contrast to the schwinger model case@xcite , the strong - coupling series approximants do not converge far enough into the weak - coupling region to allow accurate extrapolations to the continuum limit .",
    "thus it seems there is still no real alternative to monte carlo methods , whatever their limitations , for the detailed investigation of lattice gauge theories in three and four dimensions .",
    "the strong - coupling series provide an accurate ` platform ' of results in the strong - coupling region , which can provide useful calibration points for other methods ; but their extrapolation into the weak - coupling region remains rather uncertain .",
