    "the low energy behavior of the quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) is not accessible to the perturbative approaches ; the lattice gauge theory @xcite is the ideal tool for this purpose . despite enormous computational power necessary for the numerical realization ,",
    "lattice qcd calculations have started , very recently , to describe masses and other constants of the baryonic ground as well as excited states  @xcite .",
    "experimentally , the determination of baryonic resonance properties proceeds indirectly by exciting the nucleon with the help of a hadronic or electromagnetic probe and performing measurements for their decay products ( mesons and nucleons ) .",
    "the reliable extraction of nucleon resonance properties from such experiments is a major issue of the hadron physics .    in recent years , important advances",
    "have been made in the experimental investigation of meson production reactions in nucleon - nucleon ( @xmath11 ) collisions , particularly at beam energies very close to respective production thresholds  @xcite .",
    "low incident energies also provide the opportunity to investigate the meson - nucleon interactions through these reactions since in this energy regime the final state interactions among the outgoing particles affect strongly the meson production cross sections .",
    "the @xmath9 meson , which is the next lightest nonstrange member in the meson mass spectrum , has been a subject of considerable interest .",
    "it has been thought of as a probe for the @xmath12 component in the nucleon wave function  @xcite .",
    "there is also interest in measuring the rare decays of @xmath9 which could provide a new rigorous test of the standard model  @xcite or even of the physics beyond this .",
    "the nucleon resonance @xmath10(1535 ) [ @xmath13 with spin @xmath14 , isospin @xmath14 , and odd parity , has a remarkably large @xmath15 branching ratio .",
    "it lies very close to the threshold of the @xmath16 reaction and contributes to the amplitude of this reaction even at the threshold .",
    "therefore , the study of @xmath9-meson production in @xmath11 collisions at the near threshold beam energies provides the unique opportunity to investigate the properties of @xmath10(1535 ) which have been the subject of some debate recently ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) .",
    "the attractive nature of the @xmath9-nucleon interaction may lead to the formation of bound ( quasi - bound ) @xmath9-nucleus states ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "this subject has been a topic of intense discussion at a recent work shop  @xcite .",
    "production of @xmath9 meson in heavy ion collisions also is of great interest . due to the high threshold of the elementary production reaction ,",
    "@xmath9 mesons in such collisions are produced only by very energetic nucleons and reflect therefore , the tails of the nucleon momentum distributions as they arise in a high density and high temperature phase of the collision @xcite .",
    "the elementary @xmath17 production cross sections are a crucial ingredient in the transport model studies of the @xmath9-meson production in the nucleus - nucleus collisions .    since lattice qcd calculations are still far from being amenable to the low and intermediate energy scattering and reaction processes , the effective methods are mostly used for the description of the dynamics of the meson production reactions in hadronic collisions .",
    "these approaches introduce the baryonic resonance states explicitly in their framework and try to extract their properties by comparing the theoretical results with experimental observables .",
    "several authors have used models of such type in describing the @xmath9 meson production in @xmath11 collisions  @xcite .",
    "the main objective of this paper is to investigate the @xmath9 meson production in @xmath11 collisions in the framework of an effective lagrangian model ( elm ) which has been used earlier rather successfully to describe the pion  @xcite , associate kaon  @xcite , and dilepton  @xcite production data in such collisions .",
    "the motivation here is to see as to how far can one explain the recently measured data on total and differential cross sections of @xmath18  @xcite and the @xmath1  @xcite reactions within this model using same sets of entrance channel and resonance channel parameters ( for those resonances that appeared in earlier applications @xcite ) .    within the elm , initial interaction between two incoming nucleons is modeled by an effective lagrangian which is based on the exchange of @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 mesons .",
    "the coupling constants at the nucleon - nucleon - meson vertices are determined by directly fitting the @xmath19 matrices of the @xmath11 scattering in the relevant energy region  @xcite .",
    "the effective lagrangian uses the pseudovector ( pv ) coupling for the nucleon - nucleon - pion vertex , as it is consistent with the chiral symmetry requirement of the qcd  @xcite and also it leads to negligible contributions from the negative energy states ( `` pair suppression phenomena '' )  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath9 meson production proceeds via excitation of @xmath10(1535 ) , @xmath10(1650 ) and @xmath10(1710 ) intermediate baryonic resonance states which have known branching ratios for the decay into the @xmath15 channel .",
    "the coupling constants at the resonance - nucleon meson vertices are determined from the experimental widths for the decay of the resonances into the relevant channels except for those involving the @xmath7 meson where they are determined from the vector meson dominance ( vmd ) hypothesis .",
    "the interference terms between amplitudes corresponding to various meson exchanges and the intermediate resonance states have been included .    the final state interaction ( fsi ) among the outgoing particles",
    "affect strongly the cross sections of the @xmath16 reaction at near threshold beam energies  @xcite . in applications of the elm to describe the near threshold meson production reactions in @xmath11 collisions  @xcite ,",
    "the fsi effects were included within the watson - midgal theory  @xcite which is based on the assumption that the fsi effects are strong in relation to the production process and that they occur attractively between only one particular pair of out - going particles . in ref .",
    "@xcite , this method was used somehow arbitrarily for all the 3 outgoing pairs of particles .",
    "however , watson s method as such is not applicable , in strict sense , for those cases where the attraction between outgoing particles is not so pronounced or where interaction between more than one pair is to be included in calculations . in this paper",
    ", we employ a generalized watson method in which three - body states are treated by splitting the total interaction into pairwise net interactions which leads to a series decomposition of the net scattering among all the particles in terms of separate total scattering between pairs of particles ( see , e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "however , the three - body interactions are neglected . in view of the arguments presented in refs .",
    "@xcite in favor of using the three - body scattering theory to describe the @xmath17 process , it would be interesting to see to what extent this generalized method is able to explain the @xmath17 production data .    in the next section",
    ", we present a brief description of the elm where we describe the main ingredients of the theory and give all the input parameters used in our calculations . the generalized watson method of fsi effects is also described in a subsection here .",
    "the results of calculations and their discussions are presented in section iii .",
    "summary and conclusions of our work are given in section iv .",

    "@xmath20 , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 are four momenta of the exchanged meson , the intermediate resonance and the @xmath9-meson , respectively .",
    "to evaluate various amplitudes , we have used the effective lagrangians for the nucleon - nucleon - meson and resonance - nucleon - meson vertices as described below .",
    "-0.3 in      as done before in the investigation of @xmath23 , @xmath24  @xcite , @xmath25  @xcite , and @xmath26  @xcite reactions , the parameters for nucleon - nucleon - meson vertices are determined by fitting the @xmath11 elastic scattering @xmath19 matrix with an effective @xmath11 interaction based on the @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 , and @xmath8 meson exchanges .",
    "the effective @xmath27 lagrangians are ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) @xmath28 in eqs .",
    "( 1)-(4 ) , we have used the notations and conventions of bjorken and drell  @xcite and definitions of various terms are the same as those given there . in eq .",
    "( 1 ) @xmath29 denotes the nucleon mass .",
    "it should be noted that we use a pv coupling for the @xmath30 vertex . since these lagrangians are used to directly model the @xmath11 @xmath19 matrix , we have also included a nucleon - nucleon - axial - vector - isovector vertex , with the effective lagrangian given by @xmath31 where @xmath32 represents the axial - vector meson field .",
    "this term is introduced because if the mass of the axial meson @xmath33 is chosen to be very large ( @xmath34 )  @xcite and @xmath35 is defined as @xmath36 it cures the unphysical behavior in the angular distribution of @xmath11 scattering caused by the contact term in the one - pion exchange amplitude .",
    "it should be mentioned here that @xmath33 is different from the @xmath37(1260 ) meson resonance .",
    "the role of the @xmath33 vertex is to explicitly subtract out the contact term of the one - pion exchange part of the @xmath11 interaction .",
    "similar term in the coordinate space potential is effectively switched off by the repulsive hard core .    at each interaction",
    "vertex , the following form factor is introduced @xmath38 where @xmath39 and @xmath40 are the four momentum and mass of the @xmath41th exchanged meson and @xmath42 is the corresponding cut - off parameter .",
    "the latter governs the range of suppression of the contributions of high momenta which is done via the form factor .",
    "since @xmath11 scattering cross sections decrease gradually with the beam energy ( beyond certain value ) , and since we fit the elastic @xmath19 matrix directly , the coupling constants are expected to be energy dependent . therefore , while keeping the cut - offs @xmath42 [ in eq .",
    "( 7 ) ] energy independent , we take energy dependent meson - nucleon coupling constants of the following form @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the square of the total cm energy . the parameters",
    "@xmath45 , @xmath46 , and @xmath47 were determined by fitting to the @xmath19 matrix of the relevant proton - proton and proton - neutron scattering data at the beam energies in the range of 800 mev to 4.00 gev  @xcite .",
    "this procedure also fixes signs of the effective lagrangians [ eqs .",
    "( 1)-(5 ) ] .",
    "the values of various parameters are shown in table i [ the signs of all the coupling constants ( g ) are positive ] . in this table",
    "the parameters of the @xmath33 exchange vertex are not explicitly shown as they are related to those of the pion via eq .",
    "we would like to remark that the same parameters were also used to describe the initial @xmath11 interaction in the calculations reported in refs .",
    "this ensures that the elastic @xmath11 elastic scattering channel remains the    .",
    "coupling constants for the @xmath11-meson vertices used in the calculations [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     it should be stressed here that signs of various amplitudes are fixed , by those of the effective lagrangians , coupling constants and propagators as described above .",
    "these signs are not allowed to change anywhere in the calculations .",
    "the general formula for the invariant cross section of the @xmath48 reaction is written as @xmath49 } }                       \\frac{1}{(2\\pi)^5}\\delta^4(p_f - p_i)|t_{fi}|^2                       \\prod_{a=1}^3 \\frac{d^3p_a}{e_a},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath50 represents the total amplitude , @xmath51 and @xmath52 the sum of all the momenta in the initial and final states , respectively , and @xmath53 the momenta of the three particles in the final state .",
    "the corresponding cross sections in the laboratory or center of mass systems can be written from this equation by imposing the relevant conditions .",
    "for describing the data for the @xmath54 reaction at beam energies very close to the @xmath9 production threshold , consideration of the final state interaction ( fsi ) among the three out going particles is important .",
    "we follow here an approximate scheme in line with the watson - migdal theory of fsi  @xcite . in this approach",
    "the energy dependence of the cross section due to fsi is separated from that of the primary production amplitude .",
    "this is based on the assumption that the reaction takes place over a small region of space , a condition fulfilled rather well in near threshold reactions involving heavy mesons .",
    "this method has been extensively applied to study the low momentum behavior of the pion  @xcite , @xmath9 meson  @xcite , associated hyperon  @xcite and @xmath55-meson  @xcite production in @xmath11 collisions .",
    "the total amplitude is written as @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the primary production amplitude , while @xmath58 describes the re - scattering among the final particles which goes to unity in the limit of no fsi .",
    "the factorization of the total amplitude into those of the fsi and primary production ( eq .  ( 22 ) ) , enables one to pursue the diagrammatic approach for the latter within an effective lagrangian model and investigate the role of various meson exchanges and resonances in describing the reaction .",
    "watson s original method  @xcite was developed for those cases where the final state interaction is strong in relation to the production process and where it is confined only to one particular pair of particles ( mostly among nucleons in case of nucleon - nucleon - meson final states ) .",
    "on the other hand , in certain cases it may be necessary to include fsi among all the three outgoing particles since even if the meson - baryon interactions are weak , they can still be influential through interference . in ref .",

    "( 27 ) is independent of the strength of the interaction and of whether it is attractive or repulsive .",
    "the quantity @xmath84 can be regarded as the amount of final state scattering that takes place in a particular channel @xmath85 .",

    "recently , there has been suggestions to determine the @xmath15 scattering amplitude from the studies of associated photoproduction of @xmath55 and @xmath9 mesons off the proton  @xcite .",

    "@xcite where @xmath15 scattering parameters have been obtained by fitting the @xmath89 , @xmath87 , @xmath88 data in an energy range from threshold to about 100 mev , in a @xmath90 matrix method .",

    "it should be noted that the real part of the @xmath15 scattering length of this parameter set ( @xmath99 ) is about half of that of the `` preferred '' set of ref .",
    "a larger @xmath99 is also supported by the calculations presented in ref .",

    "@xcite in an effective lagrangian model analysis of the meson - nucleon scattering .",
    "furthermore , it was noted in ref .",
    "@xcite that within a three - body model , the shapes of the @xmath101 cross sections can be explained over a wide energy range only with a @xmath99 around 0.42 fm . a smaller value of @xmath99 is also consistent with the jlich model  @xcite .",

    "the major aim of this paper is to check the suitability of our model and the vertex parameters appearing therein to describe the @xmath9 production cross sections over a wide range of beam energies .",

    "it would be interesting to see the results of their model also at higher values of @xmath111 .",

    "similar to the situation at higher beam energies , the cross sections are dominated by the @xmath10(1535 ) resonance excitation . since @xmath10(1535 ) is the lowest energy baryonic resonance having an appreciable branching ratio for the decay into the @xmath119 channel , its dominance in this reaction even at beam energies near the @xmath9 production threshold is to be expected .",
    "the contribution of @xmath10(1650 ) resonance state is small and that of the @xmath10(1710 ) resonance is even smaller at these lower beam energies .",
    "it should , however be noted that the resonance - resonance interference terms are not negligible . for the @xmath100 reaction ,",
    "the total cross sections are smaller than those corresponding to the @xmath10(1535 ) resonance alone . for the @xmath1 reactions the difference between the two is not visible in fig .",
    "-0.1 in    we found that the inclusion of the amplitudes corresponding to the nucleon intermediate states ( the nucleon bremsstrahlung ) made a negligible difference in the results reported in figs .  1 - 8 if the value of the coupling constant @xmath120 is taken below 3.0 .",
    "with the largest value of @xmath120 used in the literature ( 6.14 ) , the results were affected to the extent of only a few percent .",
    "this result is in agreement with that reported in ref .",
    "it is obvious that due to a considerable amount of uncertainty in the value of @xmath120 ( see , e.g.  @xcite ) , the nucleon excitation amplitudes are quite uncertain ( see , e.g.  @xcite ) and their inclusion makes an insignificant difference to the results reported above .    in fig .  9 , we show contributions of various meson exchanges to the @xmath0 reaction at near threshold beam energies .",
    "the dashed , dotted , dashed - dotted and dashed - double dotted curves represent the contributions of @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath8 and @xmath7 meson exchanges , respectively .",
    "their coherent sum is shown by the solid line .",
    "we see that the one pion exchange graphs make the largest contribution to the reaction in this energy regime . however , a striking feature of this figure is that despite a larger value for the @xmath121 coupling used in our calculations , the contributions of @xmath6 meson exchange is still much smaller than that of the pion exchange graphs .",
    "hence in contrast to the results reported in refs .",
    "@xcite the @xmath6 meson exchange terms do not dominate the total @xmath17 production cross sections . to understand this difference we note that while in refs .",
    "@xcite @xmath122 couplings have been used for the @xmath123 vertex , we have taken a @xmath124 coupling for the same which is an extension of the @xmath125 couplings ( due to vector meson dominance reasons  @xcite ) .",
    "this is also compatible with the forms of the @xmath123 couplings used in the literature  @xcite .",
    "since the @xmath6 meson exchange amplitudes calculated with the @xmath124 couplings involve delicate cancellations among leading terms , contributions of this exchange diagrams to the @xmath9 production cross sections are weakened .",
    "this is the main reason for differences between our results and those of refs .",
    "@xcite .    in ref  @xcite , although the form of the @xmath123 coupling is the same as ours , relatively lower @xmath6 meson exchange cross sections result from the use of a very small value for the coupling constant @xmath121 which is based on the lower limit of the branching ratio for the radiative decay of this resonance . our value for this constant , on the other hand , is calculated from the branching ratio of the decay of this resonance to @xmath126 channel as quoted in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "-0.1 in    we see that the @xmath7 meson exchange process contributes insignificantly to the @xmath17 production but the @xmath8 meson exchange terms are relatively more important .",
    "larger contributions from the latter has also been seen in other subthreshold reactions analyzed within our model .",
    "it indicates that @xmath8 meson exchange may be an efficient means of mediating the large momentum mismatch involve in the meson production in @xmath11 collisions  @xcite .    in fig .",
    "10 , we investigate the effects of using ps or pv couplings for the @xmath127 vertices .",
    "we notice hardly any difference in the cross sections calculated by the two types of couplings .",
    "similar results were also observed in ref  @xcite .",
    "this result is not surprising since the two couplings are constructed in such a way that both are equivalent on the mass shell .",
    "of course , they start having different energy behavior in the far off shell region where resonance contribution is anyway suppressed due to dominance of the corresponding propagator .",
    "it is only in the @xmath30 case that difference in the ps and pv couplings are obvious with a clear preference for the pv coupling in line with the chiral symmetry as discussed earlier .",
    "-0.1 in    after establishing the dynamical content of our model _ vis a vis _ the description of the total production cross sections , we now turn our attention to more exclusive data . in fig .  11",
    ", we show a comparison of our calculations with the data for the angular distribution of @xmath9 meson in the @xmath0 reaction for @xmath111 values of 15 mev ( upper panel ) and 41 mev ( lower panel ) .",
    "since the angular distribution data are normalized to the total cross sections for both values of @xmath111 , we have done the same in our calculations shown in this figure .",
    "we note that shapes of the angular distributions are described well by our model at both the energies . at the lower beam energy ,",
    "the data as well as our calculations have essentially isotropic distributions .",
    "however , for @xmath111 = 41 mev , there is a tendency in our calculations to show slight enhancements at forward and backward angles which is typical of the @xmath5 exchange dominance process in the @xmath2 excitation . due to large statistical errors in the data",
    ", it is difficult to conclude if they show a trend different from our calculations",
    ". it will be useful to have better quality data with less statistical errors in order to determine if other mechanisms which may show a trend different from ours , are also important . in any case , it is quite unlikely that the @xmath6 meson exchange mechanism which might lead to a distribution different from that seen in our calculations  @xcite is a dominant mechanism as has already been discussed .",
    "in this paper we investigated the @xmath9 meson production in proton - proton and proton - neutron collisions for beam energies ranging from near threshold to about 10 gev within an effective lagrangian model which has been used previously to describe successfully the pion , associated kaon and dilepton production in @xmath11 collisions .",
    "the interaction between two nucleons in the initial state is modeled by the effective lagrangians based on the exchange of @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 mesons .",
    "the parameters of the corresponding vertices were taken to be the same as those used in the previous applications of this model which restricts the freedom of varying the parameters to get fits to the data .",
    "the eta meson production proceeds via excitation , propagation and decay of @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 intermediate nucleon resonance states .",
    "the coupling constants at the resonances - nucleon - meson vertices have been determined from the experimental branching ratios of the decays of the resonances into the relevant channels . here",
    "again we have used the same coupling constants as those used in the previous applications of the model at vertices that appeared also in those calculations .",
    "the interference terms among various amplitudes are included in the total transition matrix .",
    "to describe the data at the near threshold beam energies , the fsi effects among the outgoing particles are included by a generalized watson - migdal method which allows to have these effects in all the three two body sub - systems of the out - going channel .",
    "this method involves a parameter which has been determined from the constrained that in the limit of fsi in only @xmath11 sub - system the result of the usual watson method is reproduced .    in this paper we presented the analysis of the data for total cross sections for the @xmath100 and @xmath106 reactions and for the @xmath9 angular distributions in the former reaction .",
    "with the same set of vertex parameters , the model is able to provide a good description of the data for the @xmath0 reaction at higher as well as near threshold beam energies except for the excess energies below 15 mev where our calculations underpredict the experimental data .",
    "the experimental total cross sections of the @xmath1 reaction are also well described by our model .",
    "the data for the @xmath9 angular distributions in the case of @xmath0 reaction are also well reproduced at two beam energies .",
    "imprecise knowledge of the @xmath15 scattering amplitudes and non - inclusion of the three - body effects are the most likely reasons for underestimation of the @xmath114 channel data by our model at very low beam energies .    in this study",
    "we have not studied the observables related to meson energy dependence e.g. , final @xmath114 and @xmath116 invariant mass distributions .",
    "there are some open theoretical issues concerning the explanation of the corresponding experimental data . while in ref .",
    "@xcite , the inclusion of contributions of the non-@xmath44-wave states in the @xmath114 subsystem were found to be essential to explain these data , the three - body effects in the @xmath128 system and not the contribution of the higher partial waves were shown to be crucial for this purpose by the authors of ref .  @xcite . at this stage ,",
    "our theory excludes both these effects .",
    "extension of our model to include these mechanisms is vital before we can make some meaningful contribution towards settlement of this issue .    within our model ,",
    "one pion exchange processes make the largest contributions to cross sections in the entire energy regime . despite our using a large coupling constant for the @xmath129 vertex ,",
    "the cross sections of the @xmath6 meson exchange process are still lower than those of the pion exchange mechanism .",
    "therefore , @xmath6 meson exchange being the dominant mechanism of @xmath2 resonance excitation  @xcite is not supported by our calculations .",
    "the individual contributions of the @xmath7 meson exchange diagrams are very small every where . on the other hand , the @xmath8 exchange terms make relatively larger contributions .",
    "the excitation of the @xmath2 resonance dominates the @xmath17 production at both higher as well as near threshold beam energies .",
    "the contributions of @xmath3 and @xmath4 are small in comparison",
    ". however , the interference among various resonance contributions is not negligible .",
    "unlike the @xmath30 vertex where there is a clear preference for the pv coupling , the present reaction does not distinguish between ps and pv couplings at the @xmath108 vertex involving spin-1/2 even or odd parity resonances .",
    "we point out that the mechanism of the @xmath128 production via preferential excitation of the @xmath2 intermediate baryonic resonance state in one - pion - exchange process has received support recently from an experimental study  @xcite of the analyzing powers of the @xmath130 reaction .",
    "this work fixes the parameters of the effective lagrangian model for most of the vertices involve in the eta meson production processes .",
    "an interesting further check of this model will be provided by the analysis of the eta photoproduction data on nucleons ( see , e.g .",
    "an exciting recent result is that the integrated cross section of the photoproduction of @xmath9 meson on neutrons shows an additional maximum at center of mass energies around 1.66 gev .",
    "this has recently been explained in terms of the excitation of the @xmath3 and @xmath3 resonance states  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the vertex parameters derived by us will also be useful in applications of effective lagrangian method in describing the production of eta - mesic nuclei in proton and photon induced reactions ( see , e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "the author is thankful to andrzej deloff for several useful correspondences regarding the off shell @xmath114 fsi method presented in ref .",
    "@xcite and for his help in implementing the calculations based on this method .",
    "useful discussions with horst lenske , jerry miller , ulrich mosel , pawel moskal and madeleine soyeur is gratefully acknowledged .",
    "we give here some clarifications and steps leading to the derivation eq .",
    "( 23 ) .",
    "the total hamiltonian of the three - particle system is written as @xmath131 where @xmath132 is the kinetic energy operator of the system and the interaction @xmath133 is taken as @xmath134 assuming that the three - particle states interact by means of the additive pair interactions represented by @xmath135 .",
    "the green s functions corresponding to @xmath136 and @xmath132 are , respectively @xmath137 we shall also need the hamiltonian describing the two particles interacting while the third one is free , namely , @xmath138 and the corresponding green s functions @xmath139 the full three - body transition operator @xmath19 satisfies the lipmann - schwinger equations @xmath140 which can also be written as @xmath141 eq.(a5 ) leads to the iteration @xmath142 \\nonumber \\\\       & & + \\sum_{k \\not= j}\\ , [ u_k + u_k g_0 u_k + ... ] \\ , g_0\\ ,          [ u_j + u_j g_0 u_j + ... ] + ... \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    in the study of the final state interaction problems , one usually has in addition to potential u [ which is responsible for the transition from the initial state to the free final states characterized by the transition matrix @xmath60 in eq .",
    "( 22 ) ] , an additional interaction v that describes a type of internal interaction among the constituents of the final state .",
    "the total hamiltonian is then written as @xmath132 + @xmath133 + @xmath143 and one can make use of the standard `` two - potential formalism '' of goldberger and watson ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) to write the total scattering matrix element @xmath144 as as a sum of two terms - one of them involve the matrix elements of the interaction @xmath133 between the exact initial state wave function and the final scattering state wave function corresponding to interaction @xmath143 . from the general theory ,",
    "we can write @xmath145 where @xmath146 completely describes the initial state with the outgoing wave boundary condition , and @xmath147 is the final plane wave state . one can eliminate @xmath147 by introducing wave functions @xmath148 which are the eigenfunctions of the hamiltonian @xmath149 as @xmath150 substituting ( a8 ) into ( a7 ) one gets after some manipulation , @xmath151 where @xmath152 is the initial plane wave state .",
    "the final state interactions of interest are contained in @xmath148 .    in applications of relevance to us , the second term of eq .",
    "( a9 ) would vanish because we assume @xmath143 can not create real mesons .",
    "( 23 ) can be obtained by using an iteration similar to that given by eq .",

    "( a9 ) . the amplitude @xmath60 is defined in the same way as the first term of eq .",

    "( 23 ) represents the matrix elements of the interaction @xmath153 between the plane wave and the scattering states of particle @xmath85 .",
