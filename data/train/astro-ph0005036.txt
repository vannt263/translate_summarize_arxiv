    "why measure the bispectrum of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) radiation anisotropy ?",
    "simple inflationary models predict that the cmb anisotropy field is nearly random gaussian , and that two - point statistics completely specify statistical properties of cmb .",
    "however , our universe may not be so simple .",
    "higher order statistics , such as the three - point correlation function , or its harmonic transform , the angular bispectrum , are potential probes of the physics of generating the primordial fluctuations . since gravitationally induced non - linearities are small at @xmath1 , cmb is expected to be the best probe of the primordial non - gaussianity@xcite .    in the inflationary scenario@xcite ,",
    "the quantum fluctuations of the scalar ( inflaton ) field generate the observed matter and radiation fluctuations in the universe@xcite . in the stochastic inflationary scenario of starobinsky@xcite , the quantum fluctuations decohere to generate the classical fluctuations .",
    "there are two potential sources of non - gaussianity in this inflationary model : ( a ) the non - linear coupling between the classical inflaton field and the observed fluctuation field , and ( b ) the non - linear coupling between the quantum noise field and the classical fluctuation field .",
    "the former has been investigated by salopek and bond@xcite , while the latter has been explored by gangui et al.@xcite .",
    "calzetta and hu@xcite and matacz@xcite present an alternative treatment of the decoherence process that leads to different results for the primordial density perturbation from those obtained by starobinsky@xcite .",
    "matacz s treatment makes similar predictions for the level of non - gaussianity to the starobinsky s treatment@xcite .",
    "these studies conclude that in the slow roll regime , the fluctuations are gaussian .",
    "however , features in the inflaton potential can produce significant non - gaussianity@xcite .",
    "there have been claims for both the non - detection@xcite and the detection@xcite of the non - gaussianity in the cobe map .",
    "banday , zaroubi and grski@xcite argued the non - cosmological origin of the cobe non - gaussianity .",
    "map and planck will measure the fluctuation field down to angular scales @xmath2 and @xmath3 , and test these claims .",
    "previous work on the primary non - gaussianity has focused on very large angular scale , where the temperature fluctuations trace the primordial fluctuations .",
    "this is valid on the cobe scale . for map and planck",
    "; however , we need the full effect of the radiation transfer function . in this paper , we develop a formalism for doing this , and then present numerical results . both the formalism and the numerical results are main results of this paper .",
    "we also discuss how well we can separate the primary bispectrum from various secondary bispectra .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "[ sec : formulation ] defines the bispectrum , the gaunt integral , and particularly the new quantity called the `` reduced '' bispectrum , which plays a fundamental role in estimating the physical property of the bispectrum .",
    "[ sec : bl+s ] formulates the primary bispectrum that uses the full radiation transfer function , and presents the numerical results of the primary bispectrum and the skewness .",
    "[ sec : secondary ] estimates the secondary bispectra from the coupling between the sunyaev  zeldovich and the weak lensing effects@xcite , and from the extragalactic radio and infrared sources .",
    "[ sec : measure ] studies how well we can measure each bispectrum , and how well we can discriminate among various bispectra . sec .",
    "[ sec : discussion ] is devoted to further discussion and our conclusion .",
    "the observed cmb temperature fluctuation field @xmath4 is expanded into the spherical harmonics : @xmath5 where hats denote unit vectors .",
    "the cmb angular bispectrum is given by @xmath6 and the angle - averaged bispectrum is defined by @xmath7 where the matrix is the wigner-@xmath8 symbol . the bispectrum @xmath9 must satisfy the triangle conditions and selection rules : @xmath10 , @xmath11 , and @xmath12 for all permutations of indices .",
    "thus , @xmath9 consists of the gaunt integral , @xmath13 , defined by @xmath14 @xmath13 is real , and satisfies all the conditions mentioned above .    given the rotational invariance of the universe , @xmath15 is written as @xmath16 where @xmath17 is an arbitrary real symmetric function of @xmath18 , @xmath19 , and @xmath20 .",
    "this form of equation ( [ eq : func ] ) is necessary and sufficient to construct generic @xmath9 under the rotational invariance .",
    "thus , we shall frequently use @xmath17 instead of @xmath9 in this paper , and call this function the `` reduced '' bispectrum , as @xmath17 contains all physical information in @xmath9 . since the reduced bispectrum does not contain the wigner-@xmath8 symbol that merely ensures the triangle conditions and selection rules , it is easier to calculate and useful to quantify the physical properties of the bispectrum .",
    "the observable quantity , the angle - averaged bispectrum @xmath15 , is obtained by substituting equation ( [ eq : func ] ) into ( [ eq : blll ] ) , @xmath21 where we have used the identity : @xmath22 alternatively , one can define the bispectrum in the flat - sky approximation , @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the two dimensional wave - vector on the sky .",
    "this definition of @xmath25 corresponds to equation ( [ eq : func ] ) , given the correspondence of @xmath26 in the flat - sky limit@xcite .",
    "thus , @xmath27 is satisfied",
    ". this fact also would motivate us to use the reduced bispectrum @xmath17 rather than the angular averaged bispectrum @xmath15 .",
    "note that @xmath17 is similar to @xmath28 defined by magueijo@xcite .",
    "the relation is @xmath29 .",
    "if the primordial fluctuations are adiabatic scalar fluctuations , then @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the primordial curvature perturbation in the fourier space , and @xmath32 is the radiation transfer function .",
    "@xmath33 thus takes over the non - gaussianity , if any , from @xmath31 .",
    "although equation ( [ eq : almphi ] ) is valid only if the universe is flat , it is straightforward to extend this to an arbitrary geometry .",
    "the isocurvature fluctuations can be similarly calculated by using the entropy perturbation and the proper transfer function .    in this paper ,",
    "we explore the simplest weak non - linear coupling case : @xmath34 in real space , where @xmath35 denotes the linear gaussian part of the perturbation .",
    "@xmath36 is guaranteed .",
    "henceforth , we shall call @xmath37 the non - linear coupling constant .",
    "this model is based upon the slow - roll inflationary scenario .",
    "salopek and bond@xcite and gangui et al.@xcite found that @xmath37 is given by a certain combination of the slope and the curvature of the inflaton potential . in the notation of gangui",

    "we have also used @xmath48 , and @xmath49 .",
    "substituting equation ( [ eq : almphi ] ) into ( [ eq : blllmmm ] ) , using equation ( [ eq : phispec ] ) for the @xmath31-field bispectrum , and then integrating over angles @xmath50 , @xmath51 , and @xmath51 , we obtain the primary cmb angular bispectrum , @xmath52,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath53 note that @xmath54 is a dimensionless quantity , while @xmath55 has a dimension of @xmath56 .",
    "one confirms that the form of equation ( [ eq : func ] ) holds .",

    "it should be stressed again that this is the special case in the slow - roll limit . if the slow - roll condition is not satisfied , then @xmath61 at equation ( [ eq : phispec])@xcite .",
    "wang and kamionkowski@xcite have developed the formula to compute @xmath15 from the generic form of @xmath31-field bispectrum .",
    "our formula ( eq.([eq : almspec ] ) ) agrees with theirs , given our form of the @xmath31-field bispectrum ( eq.([eq : phispec ] ) ) .",
    "even if the inflation produced gaussian fluctuations , pyne and carroll pointed out that the general relativistic second - order perturbation theory would produce terms of @xmath62@xcite . for generic slow - roll models",
    ", these terms dominate the primary non - gaussianity .",
    "we evaluate the primary cmb bispectrum ( eqs.([eq : almspec])([eq : blprim ] ) ) numerically .",
    "we compute the full radiation transfer function @xmath32 with the cmbfast@xcite code , and assume the single power law spectrum , @xmath63 , for the primordial curvature fluctuations .",
    "the integration over @xmath64 ( eqs.([eq : blr ] ) and ( [ eq : bnlr ] ) ) is done by the algorithm used in cmbfast .",
    "the cosmological model is the scale - invariant standard cold dark matter model with @xmath65 , @xmath66 , @xmath67 , @xmath68 , and @xmath69 , and with the power spectrum @xmath46 normalized to cobe@xcite .",
    "although this model is almost excluded by current observations , it is still useful to depict the basic effects of the transfer function on the bispectrum .",
    "figure  [ fig : bl ] shows @xmath70 ( eq.([eq : blr ] ) ) and @xmath71 ( eq.([eq : bnlr ] ) ) for several different values of @xmath72 .",
    "@xmath73 , where @xmath74 is the conformal time , and @xmath75 is at the present . in our model , @xmath76 , and",
    "the decoupling epoch occurs at @xmath77 at which the differential visibility has a maximum .",
    "our @xmath78 includes the radiation effect on the expansion of universe , otherwise @xmath79 .",
    "@xmath80 is the epoch when the most of the primary signal is generated .",
    "@xmath81 and @xmath60 look very similar one another in the shape and the amplitude at @xmath82 , although the amplitude in the sachs ",
    "wolfe regime is different by a factor of @xmath83 .",
    "this is because @xmath60 is proportional to @xmath84 , while @xmath85 , where @xmath86 .",
    "@xmath70 has a good phase coherence over wide range of @xmath72 , while the phase of @xmath71 in high-@xmath87 regime oscillates rapidly as a function of @xmath72 .",
    "this strongly damps the integrated result of the bispectrum ( eq.([eq : almspec ] ) ) in high-@xmath87 regime .",
    "the main difference between @xmath60 and @xmath88 is that @xmath88 changes a sign , while @xmath60 does not .",
    "looking at figure  [ fig : bl ] , we find @xmath89 and @xmath90 .",
    "the most signal coming from the decoupling , the volume element at @xmath80 is @xmath91 , and thus we estimate an order of magnitude of the primary reduced bispectrum ( eq.([eq : blprim ] ) ) as @xmath92    \\sim l^{-4}\\times 2\\times 10^{-17}f_{nl}.\\ ] ] since @xmath93 ( see eq.([eq : deltadelta ] ) ) , @xmath94 .",
    "this rough estimate agrees with the numerical result below ( figure 2 ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : bispectrum ] shows the integrated bispectrum ( eq.([eq : almspec ] ) ) divided by the gaunt integral @xmath13 , which is basically @xmath59 .",
    "since the signal comes primarily from the decoupling epoch @xmath80 as mentioned above , the integration boundary is chosen as @xmath95 .",
    "we use a step - size of @xmath96 , as we found that a step size of @xmath97 gives very similar results . while the bispectrum is a 3-d function , we show different 1-d slices of the bispectrum in this figure .",
    "@xmath98 is plotted as a function of @xmath20 in the upper panel , while @xmath99 is plotted in the lower panel .",
    "@xmath100 is multiplied for each @xmath101 which contains @xmath46 so as the sachs ",
    "wolfe plateau at @xmath102 is easily seen in figure  [ fig : bispectrum ] .",
    "@xmath18 and @xmath19 are chosen so as @xmath103 , and @xmath104 .",
    "we find that the @xmath105 mode , the first acoustic peak mode , has the largest signal in this family of parameters .",
    "the upper panel has a prominent first acoustic peak , and strongly damped oscillations in high-@xmath87 regime .",
    "the lower panel also has a first peak , but damps more slowly .",
    "the typical amplitude of the reduced bispectrum is @xmath106 , which agrees with an order of magnitude estimate ( eq.([eq : orderest ] ) ) .    our formula ( eq.([eq : blprim ] ) ) and",
    "numerical results agree with gangui et al.@xcite calculation in the sachs ",
    "wolfe regime , where @xmath107 , and thus @xmath108 each term is in the same order as equation ( [ eq : blprim ] ) .",
    "@xmath109 is the cmb angular power spectrum in the sachs ",
    "wolfe approximation , @xmath110 in deriving equation ( [ eq : swapp ] ) from ( [ eq : blprim ] ) , we approximated @xmath71 ( eq.([eq : bnlr ] ) ) to @xmath111 the sachs ",
    "wolfe approximation ( eq.([eq : swapp ] ) ) is valid only when @xmath18 , @xmath19 , and @xmath20 are all less than @xmath112 , where gangui et al.s formula gives @xmath113 in figure  [ fig : bispectrum ] .",
    "it should be stressed again that the sachs  wolfe approximation gives the qualitatively different result from our full calculation ( eq.([eq : blprim ] ) ) at @xmath114 .",
    "the full bispectrum does change a sign , while the approximation never changes a sign because of the use of @xmath109 .",
    "the acoustic oscillation and the sign change are actually great advantages , when we try to separate the primary bispectrum from various secondary bispectra .",
    "we shall study this point later .",
    "the skewness @xmath115 , @xmath116 is the simplest statistic characterizing the non - gaussianity .",
    "@xmath115 is expanded in terms of @xmath15 ( eq.([eq : blll ] ) ) or @xmath17 ( eq.([eq : func ] ) ) as @xmath117 where @xmath118 is the experimental window function .",
    "we have used equation ( [ eq : wigner * ] ) to replace @xmath15 by the reduced bispectrum @xmath17 in the last equality .",
    "since @xmath119 and @xmath120 modes are not observable , we have excluded them from the summation . throughout this paper ,",
    "we consider the single - beam window function , @xmath121 , where @xmath122 .",
    "since @xmath123 is symmetric under permutation of indices , it is useful to change the way of summation as @xmath124 since this reduces the number of summations by a factor of @xmath125 , we shall use this convention henceforth .",
    "the upper panel of figure  [ fig : skewness ] plots @xmath126 , which is @xmath115 summed up to a certain @xmath20 , for fwhm beam - sizes of @xmath127 , @xmath128 , and @xmath129 .",
    "these values correspond to beam - sizes of cobe , map , and planck experiments , respectively .",
    "figure  [ fig : skewness ] also plots the infinitesimal thin - beam case .",
    "map , planck , and the ideal experiments measure very similar @xmath115 one another , despite the fact that planck and the ideal experiments can use much more number of modes than map .",
    "the reason is as follows .",
    "looking at equation ( [ eq : skewness ] ) , one finds that @xmath115 is the linear integration of @xmath17 over @xmath130 .",
    "thus , integrating oscillations in @xmath59 around zero ( see figure  [ fig : bispectrum ] ) damps the non - gaussian signal in small angular scales , @xmath131 .",
    "since the cobe scale is basically dominated by the sachs ",
    "wolfe effect , no oscillation , the cancellation affects @xmath115 less significantly than in map and planck scales , while planck suffers from severe cancellation in small angular scales .",
    "even planck and the ideal experiments measure the same amount of @xmath115 as map does . as a result , measured",
    "@xmath115 almost saturates at the map resolution scale , @xmath132 .",
    "we conclude this section by noting that when we can calculate the expected form of the bispectrum , then it is a `` matched filter '' for detecting the non - gaussianity in the data , and thus much more powerful tool than the skewness in which the information is lost through the coarse - graining .",
    "even if the cmb bispectrum were significantly detected in the cmb map , the origin would not necessarily be primordial , but rather would be various foregrounds such as the sunyaev ",
    "zeldovich effect@xcite ( hereafter sz ) , the weak lensing effect , extragalactic radio sources , and so on .",
    "in order to isolate the primordial origin from others , we have to know the accurate form of bispectra produced by the foregrounds .",
    "the coupling between the sz and the weak lensing effects would produce an observable effect in the bispectrum@xcite .",
    "the cmb temperature field including the sz and the lensing effects is expanded as @xmath133 where @xmath134 denotes the primary anisotropy , @xmath135 is the lensing potential : @xmath136 and @xmath137 denotes the sz effect : @xmath138 where @xmath139 is the spectral function of the sz effect@xcite .",

    "the cross - correlation power spectrum of the lensing and the sz effects , @xmath151 , appearing in equation ( [ eq : szlensbispec ] ) was first derived by goldberg and spergel@xcite .",
    "they assumed the linear pressure bias model proposed by persi et al.@xcite : @xmath152 , and the mean temperature evolution of @xmath153 for @xmath154 as roughly suggested by recent hydrodynamic simulations@xcite .",
    "then they derived @xmath155 where @xmath156 is the linear growth factor .",
    "simulations without non - gravitational heating@xcite suggest that @xmath157 and @xmath158 , and similar numbers are obtained by analytic estimations@xcite . in this pressure bias model ,",
    "free parameters except cosmological parameters are @xmath159 and @xmath160 .",
    "however , both actually depend on cosmological models@xcite . since @xmath161 @xcite and @xmath162 , @xmath163    \\sim     l^{-3}\\times    3\\times 10^{-19}j_\\nu\\overline{t}_{\\rho0}b_{gas},\\ ] ] where @xmath159 is in units of 1  kev , and @xmath164 ( eq.([eq : func ] ) ) is the reduced bispectrum .",
    "thus , comparing this to equation ( [ eq : orderest ] ) , we obtain @xmath165 this estimate suggests that the primary bispectrum is overwhelmed by the sz  lensing bispectrum in small angular scales .",
    "this is why we have to separate the primary from the sz  lensing effect .",
    "the bispectrum from extragalactic radio and infrared sources whose fluxes @xmath166 are less than a certain detection threshold @xmath167 is relatively simple to estimate , when they are assumed to be poisson distributed . since the poisson distribution has the white noise spectrum , the reduced bispectrum ( eq.([eq : func ] ) ) is constant , @xmath168 , then we obtain @xmath169 where @xmath170 the assumption of the poisson distribution is fairly good approximation as found by toffolatti et al.@xcite .",
    "@xmath171 is the differential source count per unit solid angle , and @xmath172 .",

    "since @xmath238 should be an order of unity , cobe and map would not be expected to detect the sz  lensing bispectrum ; however , planck would be sensitive enough to detect , depending on the frequency , i.e. , a value of @xmath139 .",
    "for example , 217  ghz is totally insensitive to the sz effect as @xmath243 , while @xmath244 in the rayleigh  jeans regime .",

    "thus , planck will separate the sz  lensing bispectrum from other effects .",
    "note that @xmath237 values must be an order of magnitude estimation , as our cosmological model is the cobe normalized scdm yielding @xmath246 . since this @xmath247 is about a factor of 2 greater than the cluster normalization with @xmath65 , and @xmath248 greater than the normalization with @xmath249@xcite .",
    "thus , this factor tends to overestimate @xmath151 ( eq.([eq : blsz ] ) ) by a factor of several . on the other hand , using the linear power spectrum for @xmath46 rather than the non - linear power spectrum tends to underestimate the effect by a factor of several at @xmath250@xcite .",
    "however , our main goal is to discriminate between shapes of various bispectra , not amplitudes , so that this factor does not affect our conclusion on the degradation parameters @xmath209 .    for the extragalactic radio and infrared sources , we estimated the signal - to - noises as @xmath251 , @xmath252 , and @xmath253 for cobe , map , and planck experiments , respectively ( see table  [ tab : sn ] ) , and the degradation parameters @xmath254 are 3.45 , 1.14 , and 1.00 ( see table  [ tab : corr ] ) . since @xmath255 from equation ( [ eq : snorder ] ) , @xmath213 of the bispectrum from point sources increases very rapidly with the angular resolution .",
    "our estimate that map will detect the bispectrum from point sources is consistent with the results found by refregier , spergel and herbig@xcite . although map can not separate the poisson bispectrum from the sz  lensing bispectrum very well ( see @xmath207 in table  [ tab : corr ] ) , it would not matter as the sz  lensing bispectrum would be too small to be measured by map .",

    "since @xmath262 , where @xmath263 determines the white noise power spectrum of the detector noise according to the knox s formula@xcite , the dominance of second term beyond the experimental angular resolution scale , @xmath264 , keeps @xmath261 slightly increasing with @xmath20 , while @xmath126 becomes constant beyond that ( see the upper panel of figure  [ fig : skewness ] ) . as a result",

    "higher the angular resolution , less sensitive measuring the primary @xmath115 than @xmath15 .",
    "this is because the cancellation effect in smaller angular scales due to the oscillation of @xmath15 damps @xmath115 .",
    "using the full radiation transfer function , we have computed numerically the primary cosmic microwave background bispectrum ( eq.([eq : almspec ] ) ) and skewness ( eq.([eq : skewness ] ) ) down to arcminutes angular scales .",
    "the primary bispectrum oscillates around zero ( figure  [ fig : bispectrum ] ) , thus the primary skewness saturates at the map angular resolution scale , @xmath132 ( figure  [ fig : skewness ] ) .",
    "we have introduced the `` reduced '' bispectrum defined by equation ( [ eq : func ] ) , and confirmed that this quantity is more useful to describe the physical property of the bispectrum than the full bispectrum ( eq.([eq : blllmmm ] ) ) .    figure  [ fig : sn ] compares the expected signal - to - noise ratio for detecting the primary non - gaussianity based on the bispectrum ( eq.([eq : sn ] ) ) to that based on the skewness ( eq.([eq : skew_sn ] ) ) .",
    "it shows that the bispectrum is almost an order of magnitude more sensitive to the non - gaussianity than the skewness .",
    "we conclude that when we can compute the predicted form of the bispectrum , it becomes a `` matched filter '' for detecting the non - gaussianity in the data , and thus much more powerful tool than the skewness .",
    "table  [ tab : fnl ] summarizes @xmath37 required for detecting the primary non - gaussianity using the bispectrum or the skewness with cobe , map , planck , and the ideal experiments .",
    "this shows that even the ideal experiment needs @xmath234 in order to detect the primary bispectrum .",
    "we estimated the secondary bispectra from the coupling between the sunyaev ",
    "zeldovich ( sz ) and the weak lensing effects , and from the extragalactic radio and infrared sources .",
    "only planck will detect the sz  lensing bispectrum , while both map and planck will detect the bispectrum from extragalactic point sources ( table  [ tab : sn ] ) .",
    "we also studied how well we can discriminate among the primary , the sz  lensing coupling , and the extragalactic point sources bispectra .",
    "we found that map and planck will separate the primary from other secondary sources at 1% or better accuracies .",
    "this conclusion is due to the presence of acoustic oscillation in the primary bispectrum that does not appear in the secondary bispectra .",
    "the sz  lensing coupling and the extragalactic sources are well separately measured by planck experiment , although cobe and map can not discriminate between them ( table  [ tab : corr ] ) .",
    "our arguments about the ability to discriminate among various bispectra were fully based upon the shape difference , and thus did not take into account the spectral difference in the frequency space . as pointed out by @xcite ,",
    "the multi - band observation is so efficient to discriminate among the primary signal and the other foreground contaminants for measuring the cmb anisotropy power spectrum .",
    "their scheme should be effective on the bispectrum as well , and the accuracy of the foreground removal will be improved further .",
    "thus , we expect that map and planck will measure the primary bispectrum separately from the foregrounds .",
    "the simplest inflationary scenario usually predicts small @xmath37 @xmath266@xcite , and the second order perturbation theory yields @xmath267@xcite .",
    "thus , the significant detection of the primary bispectrum or the skewness with any experiments means that the simplest inflationary scenario needs to be modified . according to our results ,",
    "if the reported detections@xcite of the bispectrum in the cobe map were the cosmological origin , then map and planck would detect the primary bispectrum much more significantly . although banday , zaroubi and grski@xcite pointed out the one of those detections@xcite could be accounted for by the experimental systematic effects of cobe , the other@xcite is claimed to be significant even after removing such the systematics .",
    "although we have not discussed so far , the spatial distribution of emissions from interstellar dust is a potential source of the microwave non - gaussianity .",
    "since it is very hard to estimate the bispectrum analytically , the dust map compiled by schlegel , finkbeiner and davis@xcite could be used to estimate the dust bispectrum .",
    "for example , we found that the dimensionless skewness parameter defined by @xmath268 is as large as 51 .",
    "we used the publicly available healpix - formatted@xcite @xmath269 map which contains 12,582,912 pixels without sky cut .",
    "the mean intensity in the map was @xmath270 .",
    "of course , this skewness is largely an overestimate for the cmb measurement in reality ; we need to cut a fraction of sky which contains the galactic plane , and then this will greatly reduce the non - gaussianity .",
    "nevertheless , residual non - gaussianity is still a source of the microwave bispectrum , and has to be taken into account .",
    "moreover , the form of the bispectrum measured in the dust map would reflect the physics of interstellar dust , which is highly uncertain at present , and thus studying the interstellar dust bispectrum would be challenging field .",
