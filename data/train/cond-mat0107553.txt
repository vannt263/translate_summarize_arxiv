    "tsallis non - extensive statistical physics ( tnesp ) is one of theories for generalizing the boltzmann - gibbs statistical mechanics and thermodynamics @xcite .",
    "its formalism is based on the tsallis entropy with a parameter @xmath1 , the index of non - extensiveness for a system .",
    "it takes the conventional statistical mechanics as its special case of @xmath2 .",
    "a distinct feature of it is the power - law distributions ( @xmath3 ) instead of the exponential law in the conventional statistical mechanics .",
    "since tsallis pioneered work in 1988 @xcite , the tnesp has greatly developed , and successfully been used for investigating many systems with a long - range interaction , long - time memory , or fractal structured space - time @xcite , in which the non - extensive effect exists @xcite .    for a new physical theory , to develop basic and analytic approximation tools for",
    "the tnesp should be a fundamental task for developing and employing it .",
    "to finish this task is particularly necessary for the tnesp because to perform calculation with the tsallis statistics is usually difficult due to the presence of the power - law distributions . since the tnesp with @xmath4",
    "is reduced to the conventional statistical mechanics , it will be natural to generalize variational method and perturbational theory , the two basic approximation methods in the conventional statistical mechanics @xcite , to the tnesp .",
    "in fact , some progress has been made in this direction . early in 1993 , employing concavity properties of tsallis entropy , plastino and tsallis established a generalized bogoliubov inequality and accordingly developed a scheme of variational approximation for the free energy in the generalized canonical ensemble @xcite . later in 1998 ,",
    "lenzi @xmath5 generalized the perturbation method by deriving approximate expressions of the generalized free energy ( gfe ) up to the second order and obtained , through analyzing the approximate expression up to the second order , another generalized bogoliubov inequality which affords a different variational method @xcite .",
    "recently , mendes @xmath6 gave a comparative study on the aforementioned variational methods @xcite , and illustrated that the variational method in ref .",
    "@xcite gives a better approximation for @xmath7 and is easier to perform than the variational method in ref .",
    "@xcite , albeit the latter can lead to a better approximation than the former for the case of @xmath8 .    nevertheless",
    ", the usefulness of both variational and perturbation methods is limited . the variational approximate scheme in ref .",
    "@xcite is valid only for the case of @xmath9 , and the variational approximate scheme in ref .",
    "@xcite works only for the case of @xmath10 . as for the perturbation method ,",
    "the @xmath11th - order perturbation approximation can be used only when @xmath12 . moreover , as is well known in the conventional statistical mechanics , to control the approximate accuracy of variational methods is not straightforward , and the perturbation method is valid only for an exactly soluble system with a really small perturbation .",
    "hence , for systematically improving variational method and extending the valid range of @xmath1 , it is worthwhile developing new approximate approaches .    in the conventional statistical mechanics and some other branches of physics ,",
    "a variational perturbation idea @xcite which collects merits and overcomes drawbacks of both the perturbation and the variational methods has developed and now becomes a powerful tool called variational perturbation theory @xcite ( sometimes nominated other names . ) .",
    "the author or with his collaborators also developed some schemes for the variational perturbation theory @xcite(refs .",
    "@xcite have briefly introduced references on the schemes for variational perturbation theory ) . in the present paper , we intend to generalize the variational perturbation theory to the tnesp . in the generalized canonical ensemble , we will consider an expansion for the gfe analogous to that in ref .  @xcite but with artificially introduced some auxiliary parameter @xmath13 and an expansion index @xmath14 , and derive the expressions of the first four terms in the expansion series which will lead to approximations for the gfe up to the third order . from the truncated expressions of the gfe at the first , second and third orders ( with taking @xmath15 )",
    ", the auxiliary parameter @xmath13 will be determined according to a principle of minimal sensitivity ( pms ) @xcite at the first , second and third orders , respectively . the value of @xmath13 determined at some order entering the truncated expression of the gfe at the same order produces the approximation for the gfe up to the same order .",
    "one will see that the adoption of the pms is crucial to the variational perturbation approximation ( vpa ) method .",
    "it is the pms that guarantees the meaningfulness , non - perturbational nature and effectiveness of the vpa results . to illustrate the method ,",
    "we will consider a classical harmonic oscillator , which was used in ref .",
    "@xcite , and calculate the gfe up to the third order in the variational perturbation expansion .",
    "numerical comparisons between the first- , second- and third - order and exact results are made and indicate that the vpa method provides a better approximation than the variational method in ref .",
    "@xcite .    nowadays , owing to the so - called  normalization \" problem of tsallis non - extensive thermostatistics",
    ", there have existed four versions for the tnesp @xcite .",
    "the first version with the usual constraint on the internal energy in ref .",
    "@xcite was used , for some special systems , only a couple of times in the past , and the second version with the non - normalized constraint on the internal energy in ref .",
    "@xcite has been intensively studied and used , and furthermore the aforementioned variational and perturbation methods were developed in this version . the third version with the normalized constraint on the internal energy in ref .",
    "@xcite is a satisfactory version , but is very complicated for performing because there exist implied relations between relevant quantities , and so the fourth version with the non - normalized constraint on centered operators appears to unentangle the problem on the implied relations in the third version @xcite .",
    "happily , the four versions can be easily derived from just any one of them @xcite .",
    "moreover , we notice that the second version has been applied to many systems with providing satisfactory theoretical and/or experimental results @xcite .",
    "hence , here we will use the second version worked out in ref .",
    "@xcite to perform the vpa method .",
    "next , the tsallis statistical mechanics with the canonical ensemble and the perturbation and variational methods in ref .",
    "@xcite will briefly be introduced for the convenience of our later investigations . in sect .",
    "iii , the vpa method will be stated and truncated expressions of the expansion series of the gfe in the second version in ref .",
    "@xcite for a system will be derived up to the third order .",
    "iv will contribute to investigating the classical harmonic oscillator , and conclusions will be made in sect . v.",
    "for a system with a non - extensive index @xmath1 , the tsallis entropy is defined as @xcite @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the boltzmann constant and @xmath18 is the total number of microscopic possibilities @xmath19 of the system .",
    "note that @xmath1 is a real number and characterizes the degree of non - extensiveness .",
    "when @xmath4 , eq.(1 ) leads to the usual entropy @xmath20 .",
    "the three cases of @xmath7 , @xmath4 and @xmath21 characterize superextensivness , extensiveness and subextensiveness of systems , respectively . based on the tsallis entropy , a generalized equilibrium thermostatistics can be established by making @xmath22 extremal with appropriate constraints present . for the canonical ensemble ,",
    "four possible candidates exist for the constraints and hence lead to the aforementioned four versions for tsallis statistical mechanics .",
    "this section will use the following non - normalized constraint on the internal energy @xmath23 @xcite : @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the @xmath26th eigenvalue of the hamiltonian of the system .",
    "( the corresponding constraint used in the first version of tsallis statistical mechanics is @xmath27 , and the one in the third version is the normalized one @xmath28 . ) thus , making @xmath22 extremal with present the constraint eq.(2 ) and the normalization property of the probability yields the following power - law distribution @xcite @xmath29^{1/(1-q)}}{z_q(\\beta^*)}}\\ ] ] with the generalized partition function @xmath30^{1/(1-q)},\\ ] ] where @xmath31 is the lagrange multiplier associated with the internal - energy constraint , eq.(2 ) . in the case of @xmath7 , the summation in the distribution eq.(2 ) will be cut off for those energy eigenvalues higher enough to give negative probabilities .",
    "it is easy to verify that when @xmath2 , the power - law distribution eq.(2 ) tends to the conventional exponential - law distribution .    from eqs.(2 ) , ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) , one can easily read @xmath32 where the @xmath1-logarithm function @xmath33 is a generalization of the usual logarithm function . through legendre transform on @xmath34 , which depends on @xmath31 , one can find the relation @xmath35 .",
    "note that the relation between the generalized internal energy and tsallis entropy takes the same form as in the conventional statistical mechanics .",
    "in fact , introducing @xmath36 , and defining generalized thermodynamic function in the same way as that in the conventional thermodynamics , one can find the same legendre structure as in the conventional thermodynamics .",
    "for example , one can have the gfe @xmath37 using the basic limit formula @xmath38 , one can verify that the above generalized thermodynamic function and partition function are reduced to the usual ones in the limit of @xmath2 .    from the above , one can see that although the usual thermodynamical legendre structure remains valid in tsallis statistical mechanics , it is evident that the original calculation techniques can not be directly borrowed into the generalized theory .",
    "one has to design calculation techniques for the generalized theory .",
    "as was stated in the introduction , a united presentation of the perturbation and variational methods for the tnesp has been given in ref .",
    "next , for convenience of later contrast , we give a brief introduction on them in the notations here .",
    "assume that the hamiltonian can be written as @xmath39 where , @xmath40 is the hamiltonian of a soluble model , @xmath41 is small enough so that it can be considered as a perturbation on @xmath40 , and @xmath42 is the perturbation parameter .",
    "the gfe of the system with @xmath43 , @xmath44 , is a function of @xmath42 and can be expanded as @xmath45 with @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 .",
    "eq.(8 ) is a perturbation expansion series of @xmath44 in powers of @xmath42 , and to truncate it at some order , for example @xmath11th order , can provide an approximation to @xmath44 up to the @xmath11th order . in ref .",
    "@xcite , approximate expressions for @xmath44 was derived up to the second order . through analyzing the approximation expression of @xmath44 up to the second order , ref .",
    "@xcite obtained the generalized bogoliubov inequality @xmath49 where the symbol @xmath50 is the operator corresponding to the physical quantity @xmath51 and @xmath52 ( and @xmath53 ) is the @xmath26th eigenstate for @xmath54 .",
    "this inequality stems from the approximation expression of @xmath44 up to the first order in the perturbation expansion , and affords a variational method .    according to ref .",
    "@xcite , the approximate expression of @xmath44 up to the @xmath11th order is valid only for the case of @xmath55 because the derivation of the approximate expressions requires the interchangeability between the sum over the quantum numbers and the derivative with respect to @xmath42 . as was stated below eq.(4 ) , when @xmath7 , the sum in eq.(4 ) and , accordingly , eq.(6 ) has a cutoff and so its upper limit depends upon @xmath42 , leading to the above limitation on the resultant expressions in ref .",
    "therefore , the variational method in ref .",
    "@xcite can be used only for @xmath10 .",
    "we stop here for introducing the perturbation and variational methods in ref .  @xcite .",
    "next , we turn to our investigation in the present paper .",
    "for simplicity of the notation , @xmath56 will be taken from now on .    to develop the vpa method",
    ", we consider calculating the gfe @xmath57 ( of course , the method can be used to calculate other generalized thermodynamic potentials ) .",
    "we begin with modifying the hamiltonian @xmath43 .",
    "firstly , differently from eq.(7 ) in the perturbation method , we add the zero term @xmath58 to @xmath43 and write it as @xmath59 with @xmath60 and @xmath13 an auxiliary parameter . in eq.(10 ) , @xmath61 is the hamiltonian of some exactly soluble model which is originally not included in @xmath43 , and the exact solubility of the model is not affected by values of the auxiliary parameter @xmath13 . that is to say , for a value of @xmath13 , the energy eigenvalues @xmath62 ( non - degenerate , for simplicity ) , eigenstates @xmath63 , the probability @xmath64 , the generalized partition function @xmath65 and the gfe @xmath66 for the model with @xmath61 are exactly known .",
    "secondly , an artificial parameter @xmath14 is inserted as a factor before @xmath67 in eq.(10 ) , that is , @xmath43 in eq.(10 ) is now modified as @xmath68 thus , we have a new system with the hamiltonian @xmath69 which becomes @xmath61 and @xmath43 in the cases of @xmath70 and @xmath15 , respectively .",
    "note that different from @xmath43 in eq.(10 ) , @xmath69 depends on @xmath13 for @xmath71 .",
    "the above modification provides a possibility that we calculate @xmath57 for the original system through considering the new system .",
    "for the system with @xmath69 , suppose that the set of energy eigenvalues are the spectra @xmath72 , and the corresponding eigenfunctions is @xmath73 .",
    "when the system is in thermal contact with a reservoir , @xmath74 when we adopt a generalized canonical ensemble , we have the probability distributions @xmath75 , and can calculate the gfe @xmath76 in the presence of the constraint eq.(2 ) according to the definition and expression eq.(6 ) . in analogy to eq.(8 ) , one can expand @xmath76 as the following series @xmath77 with @xmath78 and @xmath79 .",
    "this is only a formal expansion , and the parameter @xmath14 acts as an expansion order index and need nt be small . taking @xmath15 in the last equation ,",
    "we obtain an expansion series of @xmath57 for the system with @xmath43 which is independent of @xmath13 if the resultant series is not truncated .",
    "now we have a simple discussion on the expansion eq.(12 ) . of course",
    ", if @xmath61 is naively one part of the original @xmath43 and @xmath80 can be regarded as a perturbation on @xmath61 ( in this case , @xmath13 is one of system parameters in @xmath43 ) , then eq.(12 ) with @xmath15 is just the perturbation expansion series of @xmath57 , eq.(8 ) .",
    "if @xmath61 is not a naive part of @xmath43 , as we assumed in eq.(10 ) , the truncated expression at the first order in @xmath14 can lead to a variational method , and substituting the value @xmath13 from the variational method into eq.(12 ) with @xmath15 will produce an expansion series of @xmath57 around the variational result . in this case , if the resultant variational method can provide a good approximation result for @xmath57 , then it can be presumed that the expansion of @xmath57 around the variational result maybe afford a good non - perturbational approximation which will improve variational results .",
    "this is the original version of the variational perturbation theory , but the expansion series is possibly divergent @xcite . if the variational method can not provide a good approximation result for @xmath57 , the expansion of @xmath57 around the variational result will make no senses .",
    "that is to say , in general , the above expansion series eq.(12 ) seems to be useless .",
    "however , as was mentioned in sect.i , once the pms is employed to single out an appropriate value of @xmath81 , eq.(12 ) can afford a presumably convergent , systematic non - perturbation approximation method , a modern version of the variational perturbation theory @xcite . in eq.(12 ) , truncating the expansion series at some order in @xmath14 and then letting @xmath15 , the resultant truncated expression is a function of the parameter @xmath13 , albeit eq.(12 ) with @xmath15 is independent of @xmath13 . in principle , the value of the truncated expression can possibly take any value with variance of @xmath13 , including the exact value of @xmath57 . since @xmath57 is a constant in the space of @xmath13 (",
    "the exact @xmath57 is independent of @xmath13 ) , it should be believable that a requirement of the truncated result varying most slowly with the parameter @xmath13 can likely make the truncated result provide a most reliable approximate result for the exact @xmath57 . employing this requirement to determine the parameter @xmath13 is the main spirit of the so called pms @xcite .",
    "generally , the curve of a function varies more slowly near its extremum than in its slope part , and so a simple realization of the pms is to require the first derivative of the truncated expression with respect to @xmath13 to be zero .",
    "thus , substituting the appropriate value of @xmath13 determined at the truncated order into the corresponding truncated expression of @xmath57 will provide a reasonable and reliable approximation for @xmath57 up to the same order .",
    "such a truncated result at some order is the approximate result of @xmath57 up to the same order in the vpa method .    in brief , the vpa method consists in only two crucial steps : one is to formally expand the quantity @xmath57 in consideration with an adjustable parameter @xmath13 entered , and the other is to determine the value of @xmath13 from the truncated expression of @xmath57 according to the pms .",
    "now , we continue to perform the first step , derive the first four terms in eq.(12 ) ( the derivations here are similar to those in ref .",
    "@xcite ) , and simultaneously indicate the vpa procedures up to the first , second and third orders , respectively .",
    "the first term in eq.(12 ) is straightforwardly @xmath82 with @xmath83^{1/(1-q)}.\\ ] ]    for deriving the other three terms , eigenstates of @xmath84 are needed , and so we first consider the eigenequation , @xmath85 . by mimicing rayleigh - schrdinger perturbation theory , after substituting the expansions @xmath86 and @xmath87 into the eigenequation , one can formally have @xmath88 @xmath89|m{\\stackrel{(0)}{>}}\\nonumber \\\\        & & \\hspace*{0.2 cm }             -{\\frac { 1}{2}}\\sum_{m\\not = n } { \\frac { ( h_{i,\\ ; mn})^2}{(e_n^{(0 ) }             -e_m^{(0)})^2}}|n{\\stackrel{(0)}{>}}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and so on . here , @xmath90 .",
    "by the way , the expansion expressions , eqs.(15 ) and ( 16 ) , together with the pms can lead to a vpa method to solve schrdinger equation @xcite(prd)@xcite .",
    "for the second term of eq.(12 ) , @xmath91 can be calculated as @xmath92\\biggl       |_{\\epsilon=0}=z_{q,\\ ; \\epsilon}^{-q } \\sum_n [ 1-(1-q)\\beta^ * e_n]^{\\frac { q }       { 1-q } }       { \\frac { \\partial e_{n,\\ ; \\epsilon}}{\\partial \\epsilon}}\\biggl|_{\\epsilon=0}\\ ] ] with @xmath93 the generalized partition function for the system with @xmath69 . from hellmann - feynman theorem",
    "@xmath94 @xcite , we have @xmath95             ^{\\frac { q } { 1-q } }       < \\epsilon , n|\\hat{h}_i|n,\\epsilon>\\biggr ] \\biggl|_{\\epsilon=0 }       \\nonumber \\\\ & = &       \\sum_n p_q^q(e_n^0)h_{i,\\ ; nn } = < h_i>_q^0 , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which takes the same form as eq.(5 ) in ref .  @xcite .",
    "thus , the truncated expression for @xmath57 at the first order , @xmath96 , is @xmath97 the right hand side of last equation has the same form as that in the right hand side of the inequality , eq.(9 ) .",
    "@xmath96 is a function of @xmath13 and a different value of @xmath13 produces a different approximation for @xmath57 which maybe have nothing to do with the exact value of @xmath57 . however",
    ", if the value of @xmath13 in eq.(21 ) is chosen from roots of the following condition @xmath98 according to the pms , then @xmath96 in eq.(21 ) would produce a most reliable approximation for @xmath57 up to the first order .",
    "since @xmath57 has the same form as the right hand side of the inequality , eq.(9 ) , the vpa procedure up to the first order for the case of @xmath99 is consistent with the variational method based on the bogoliubov inequality in ref .",
    "@xcite , and so the appropriate root of eq.(22 ) for @xmath13 makes @xmath96 minimal . for the case of @xmath100 , an example in next",
    "section shows that the appropriate root of eq.(22 ) for @xmath13 also makes @xmath96 minimal .",
    "this suggests that the vpa procedure up to the first order is generally a variational method which provides a reliable upper limit for the exact @xmath57 .    in order to give the truncated expression for the gfe at the second order @xmath101",
    ", we calculate @xmath102 as follows .",
    "a straightforward differentiation gives @xmath103+\\sum_n ( p_q(e_n^{(0)}))^q             { \\frac { \\partial<\\epsilon , n|h_i|n,\\epsilon>}{\\partial \\epsilon } }             \\biggl|_{\\epsilon=0 } .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] from eq.(15 ) , we have @xmath104 .",
    "consequently , eq.(23 ) becomes @xmath105              \\nonumber \\\\ & & + 2\\sum_n              ( p_q(e_n^{(0)}))^q \\sum_{m\\not = n }             { \\frac { |h_{i,\\ ; nm}|^2}{e_n^{(0)}-e_m^{(0 ) } } } .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] formally , the right hand side of eq.(24 ) can be rewritten as eq.(6 ) in ref .",
    "@xcite . according to the pms , using the reasonable root of the condition",
    "@xmath106 as the value of @xmath13 , one can give the approximation result for @xmath57 up to the second order from @xmath107 .",
    "the approximation result up to the second order would improve the approximation result up to the first order .",
    "similarly , one can calculate @xmath108 . in the calculation , we need the additional relation @xmath109 , which can be easily obtained from eqs.(15 ) , ( 17 ) and ( 18 ) . thus , @xmath108 can be written as @xmath110             \\sum_{m\\not = n}{\\frac { |h_{i , nm}|^2}{e_n^{(0)}-e_m^{(0 ) } } }                 \\nonumber   \\\\ & &             + 6\\sum_n ( p_q(e_n^{(0)}))^{q }   \\biggl              [ \\sum_{l\\not = n}\\sum_{m\\not = n}{\\frac { h_{i , nl}h_{i ,",

    "in the same way , one can consider vpa results for @xmath57 up to higher orders .",
    "obviously , the vpa results up to various orders constitute a sequence of the approximation results of @xmath57 . owing to the employment of the pms",
    ", the values of @xmath13 determined depend upon the truncated orders , and the value of @xmath13 at a given order is different from values of @xmath13 at other orders . presumably , it is the dependence of @xmath13 upon the truncated order that makes the sequence of the vpa results of @xmath57 up to various orders converge to the exact @xmath57 .",
    "although we can not verify this convergent property of the variational perturbation theory , investigations in other fields have provided such a few examples @xcite .",
    "additionally , in the example of next section , generally , the vpa result up to the third order approaches more closely the exact @xmath57 than the approximations up to the lower orders .",
    "the second crucial step plays a vital role in the vpa method , and one have to perform it very carefully .",
    "sometimes , eqs.(22 ) , ( 25 ) and ( 27 ) can not provide appropriate roots for @xmath13 , and in those cases one should render the second derivative of the truncated expressions for @xmath57 with respect to @xmath13 zero to determine @xmath13 .",
    "this can be understandable because the curve of a function varies more slowly near its knee than in its slope part ( as a matter of fact , when there exist both an extremum and a knee , one should analyze behaviors of the truncated expressions as a function of @xmath13 near the extremum and knee to determine @xmath13 according to the pms ) . in case",
    "the second derivative condition can not provide an appropriate root for @xmath13 , too , then the vpa method can not provide an approximation result for @xmath57 up to the truncated order in consideration , and one should further consider vpa result up to the next order . furthermore",
    ", when there exist multi - roots of the vanishing derivatives for @xmath13 , one should choose to adopt the root near which the truncated result varies most slowly with @xmath13 .",
    "next section , we will show how to determine @xmath13 according to the pms in a concrete example .    in concluding this section , we intend to emphasize one point . in the above calculations ,",
    "the interchange between the differentiation with respect to @xmath14 and the sum over eigenstates was involved . as was mentioned in last section , the interchangeability between the differentiation and the sum leads to a limitation for the variational and perturbation methods in ref .",
    "nevertheless , for the vpa method developed here , the relevant calculations are only formal calculations and the resultant expressions are independent of @xmath14 , and presumably , we suggest that the vpa method need nt suffer those limitations on the methods in ref .  @xcite .",
    "at least , this point yields no problem in the example of next section .",
    "for a one - dimensional classical harmonic oscillator with mass @xmath114 and an angular frequency @xmath115 , the hamiltonian is @xmath116 with @xmath117 the coordinate and @xmath118 the momentum . in a manner analogous to the one used for the quantum oscillator",
