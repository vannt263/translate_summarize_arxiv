    "granular media are a - thermal , out - of - equilibrium systems that it would be useful to describe within a statistical mechanical framework .",
    "a given macro - state of such a system characterized by a fixed density of grains ( consider for simplicity a packing of monodisperse spherical particles ) is very likely to be associated with an exponentially large number of micro - states or particle configurations . how the packing was prepared ( by pouring , shaking , shearing , etc ... ) may influence its properties and change the way the associated particle configurations are sampled when repeating over the same experimental protocol .",
    "however , the simplest hypothesis , put forward by edwards and his coworkers@xcite , is that all micro - states characterized by a given average density are equiprobable . with this `` flat measure '' ,",
    "on can build a statistical mechanical framework in which entropy , i.e. , the logarithm of the number of micro - states , is the relevant thermodynamic potential .",
    "this approach has recently been the focus of an intense research activity , in connection with a series of experiments performed on weakly vibrated granular materials@xcite and with a theoretical description of out - of - equilibrium glassy systems based on the concept of effective temperature@xcite .    in the past few years",
    ", the edwards hypothesis has been tested on many models , virtually all of them being lattice models with some kind of `` tapping '' kinetics@xcite . in the absence of experimental tests of this approach ( see , however,@xcite ) , such theoretical studies are expected to better circumscribe the conditions of validity of the statistical mechanical description .",
    "( presumably , only `` approximate validity '' can be expected since , aside from specific mean - field models@xcite , such a simplified description of out - of equilibrium situations in terms of a small number of `` thermodynamic '' parameters is unlikely to be exact . )    in this article , we consider an edwards - like statistical mechanical description approach for the one - dimensional model of random adsorption - desorption of hard particles@xcite , also known as the parking - lot - model@xcite .",
    "this latter is a microscopic , off - lattice model that mimics many features of the compaction of a vibrated column of grains . besides a qualitative description of the phenomenology of",
    "weakly tapped granular media@xcite , the interest of the model is that exact analytical results can be derived or , when not possible , very accurate numerical data can be obtained from computer simulations . in the next section ,",
    "we briefly introduce the parking - lot model and we discuss its connection to vibrated granular materials . in section iii , we consider the limit of vanishingly small ( but non - zero ) tapping intensity ; we construct for this case an edwards - like description based on a flat measure over all `` blocked '' states and we compare the resulting predictions to the exact behavior . in the following section , we generalize the study to the case of a finite tapping intensity : we consider what appears to be the simplest , yet compatible with known experimental observations , generalization of the edwards formalism .",
    "finally , we discuss the merits and limitations of the approach .",
    "the parking - lot model is a one - dimensional random adsorption - desorption process of hard rods on a line .",
    "hards rods of length @xmath0 are deposited at random positions on a line at rate @xmath1 and are effectively inserted if they do not overlap with pre - deposited rods ; otherwise they are rejected .",
    "in addition , all deposited particles can desorb , i.e. , be ejected from the line at random with a rate @xmath2 .",
    "time is measured in units of @xmath3 , length in units of @xmath0 , and the model depends on one control parameter @xmath4 . when no desorption is present ( @xmath5 ) , the model reduces to the purely irreversible one - dimensional random sequential adsorption ( rsa ) process@xcite , also known as the car parking problem , and all the properties of the system as a function of time are known exactly@xcite . in addition , for @xmath6 non strictly equal to zero , the competition of mechanisms between adsorption and desorption allows the system to reach a steady state that is nothing but an equilibrium fluid of hard rods at constant activity @xmath6 : there too , all properties are known exactly .",
    "the densification kinetics of the parking - lot model at constant @xmath7 is described by @xmath8 where @xmath9 the density of hard rods on the line at time @xmath10 ( recall that @xmath11 ) and @xmath12 is the fraction of the line that is available at time @xmath10 for inserting a new particle , i.e. , the probability associated with finding an interval free of particles ( a `` gap '' ) of length at least @xmath13 .",
    "the quantities @xmath14 and @xmath15 can be calculated from the @xmath16gap distribution function @xmath17 which is the density of gaps of length @xmath18 at time @xmath10 via a number of `` sum rules '' : @xmath19 the evolution with time of the @xmath16gap distribution function can itself be described by a kinetic equation that involves @xmath20gap distribution functions , and so on@xcite . except for the two above mentioned limits ( rsa",
    "when @xmath5 , equilibrium when @xmath21 ) , the infinite hierarchy of coupled equations can not be solved analytically and one must resort to approximate treatments and computer simulations , as described in previous articles@xcite .",
    "first introduced in the context of protein adsorption at liquid - solid interfaces@xcite , the random adsorption - desorption model has recently been applied to the description of weakly vibrated granular materials@xcite .",
    "the connection between the parking - lot model and these latter is made by regarding the particles on the line as an average layer of grains in the vibrated column .",
    "time measures the number of taps whose effect is to eject particles from the layer ; ejection is followed by the arrival at random of particles in the layer , which mimics the gravity - driven relaxation step in the experiment .",
    "considering that the main influence of the intensity of the tapping is to determine the average number of particles ejected at each tap , ( this number being an increasing function of intensity ) , leads to associate @xmath6 with the tapping strength . a two - dimensional version of the model with some polydispersity of the particles would clearly be more realistic , but one does not expect this to change the qualitative features of the model@xcite . a more serious caveat is the absence of explicit account of the mechanical stability of the particle packings : stability is only implicitly described by the fact that the particles are blocked on the line between two successive desorption events .    despite its drastic simplification of the situation encountered in vibrated granular materials",
    ", the parking lot model reproduces at a qualitative level most of the relevant phenomenology : ( i ) for large rate @xmath7 corresponding to weak tapping intensity , compaction proceeds very slowly and can be effectively described by an inverse logarithm of time@xcite ; ( ii ) stronger tapping leads to faster initial compaction but to less effective asymptotic packing@xcite ; ( iii ) the slow densification kinetics leads to irreversibility effects and to the observation of two curves for the packing density as a function of tapping intensity@xcite one essentially reversible and one irreversible depending on the experimental protocol chosen@xcite ; ( iv ) the power spectrum of the density fluctuations near the steady state is distinctly non - lorenztian and displays a power - law regime at intermediate frequencies@xcite ; ( v ) non - trivial memory effects are observed when changing abruptly the tapping intensity@xcite .",
    "note that , as recently studied for a one - dimensional model with tapping dynamics@xcite , the parking lot model could also be used , via the introduction of two kinds of particles , to describe the segregation phenomena with the so - called brazil nut@xcite and reverse brazil nut@xcite effects .",
    "in this limit , ejection of one particle from the line is followed by an infinite number of insertion trials until one , or seldom , two new particles are added .",
    "the stable or `` blocked '' configurations are thus those for which no more particle insertions are possible ( recall that once successfully inserted particles can not move on the line ) , i.e. , all configurations of non - overlapping rods such that the available line fraction @xmath15 is zero , or , equivalently , such that all gaps between neighboring particles are smaller than a particle size ( here taken as unity ) .",
    "edwards prescription for constructing a statistical - mechanical description of this system is then to consider that all such `` blocked '' configurations at a fixed density @xmath14 are equiprobable .",
    "consider a line of length @xmath23 with @xmath24 particles .",
    "with periodic boundary conditions , this system has also @xmath24 gaps between neighboring particles .",
    "denoting by @xmath25 the lengths of these gaps , the total number of `` blocked '' configurations is given by the configurational integral calculated under the constraint that @xmath26 for @xmath27 , namely , @xmath28 which by using the integral representation of the delta - function , can be rewritten as @xmath29 where @xmath30 denotes a closed contour .",

    "it is easy to check that the above expression satisfies the two sum rules , eqs .",

    "the higher - order gap distribution functions are obtained along the same lines , and they satisfy a factorization property analogous to that found for an equilibrium system of hard rods , i.e. , @xmath54 etc .    the @xmath13-gap distribution function @xmath50 is directly related to the nearest - neighbor pair distribution function that represents the probability of finding two neighboring particles whose centers are separated by a distance @xmath55 .",
    "it is also possible to calculate the full pair distribution function @xmath56 via a method which closely follows that developed for the equilibrium system of hard rods@xcite .",
    "the steps of the calculation are detailed in appendix a , and the final result reads    @xmath57    where @xmath58 is the heaviside step function and @xmath53 is the solution of eq .",
    "( [ eq:7 ] ) . for comparison ,",
    "we give the equilibrium pair distribution function@xcite , @xmath59    we can now compare the above results derived under the condition of equiprobability of the `` blocked '' configurations with the exact ones obtained either analytically or numerically .",
    "when @xmath60 , analytical results are available in the two limits , @xmath61 , which corresponds to the purely irreversible rsa process at the jamming limit where no more particles can be inserted@xcite , and @xmath21 which corresponds to a close - packed state with @xmath62 .    for the rsa at the jamming limit , closed - form expressions have been derived for the saturation density@xcite , @xmath63 for the density fluctuations@xcite , for the gap distribution functions@xcite and for the pair distribution function@xcite .",
    "( the expressions are given in appendix b. ) when comparing to the edwards - like results at the same density , @xmath64 , one finds qualitative differences .",
    "most notably , ( i ) the exact @xmath13-gap distribution function displays a logarithmic divergence at contact between particles ( @xmath65 ) , @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the euler constant , ( ii ) the exact multi - gap distribution functions do not reduce to products of the @xmath13-gap functions , ( iii ) the exact pair distribution function has a super - exponential decay at large distances , @xmath68 all features that are missed by the flat - measure expressions , since @xmath69 and the multi - gap functions satisfy a factorization property , eqs .",
    "( [ eq:9])-  ( [ eq:10 ] ) .",
    "quantitatively , one can also see differences , e.g. , in the density fluctuations , the exact result at jamming being @xmath70 to be compared to @xmath71 .",
    "such observations , that generalize to an off - lattice model the results obtained by de smedt _",
    "et al._@xcite for random and cooperative sequential adsorption models on a one - dimensional lattice , are in fact to be expected : it has been shown that the rsa process generates configurations of hard particles that are sampled from a probability distribution that is `` biased '' when compared to a flat measure@xcite .",
    "as the system further evolves with time at vanishingly small tapping intensity , compaction takes place beyond the rsa saturation density , and the difference between the actual properties of the system and those predicted by the edwards - flat measure diminishes .",
    "figure  [ fig:1 ] compares the variation with @xmath14 ( for @xmath72 ) of the density fluctuations of the parking lot model ( simulation results ) with the flat - measure result , eq .",
    "( [ eq:8 ] ) , and the equilibrium curve , @xmath73 .",
    "the flat - measure prediction is in fair agreement with the simulation data , especially for intermediate densities , but it reaches too rapidly the equilibrium curve that ( slightly ) overestimates the exact result .",
    "( note that simulating the system becomes very time consuming as compaction goes on and , in practice , we can not go beyond a density of about @xmath74 ; the infinite - time limit should of course be @xmath62 ) .",
    "however the edwards description improves upon the equilibrium curve and gives the proper shape of the density dependence with an inflection around @xmath75 . the closeness of the flat measure result and of the equilibrium one ( the former being of course with the constraint that no gaps have a length larger than @xmath13 ) at high density",
    "is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] where we show the entropy density versus particle density .    in figure  [ fig:3 ]",
    "we have displayed on a logarithmic - linear plot the predicted and computed @xmath13-gap distribution functions for four different densities .",
    "the edwards approximation is too small at small @xmath18 for @xmath76 , which is reminiscent of the missing the logarithm divergence at the rsa jamming limit @xmath77 ( see above ) .",
    "otherwise the agreement with the simulation data is very good ( recall that this is a log - linear plot ) . for @xmath78 ,",
    "the edwards approximation is exact since @xmath79 .",
    "finally , we have plotted in figures  [ fig:4]-  [ fig:6 ] the pair distribution functions ( simulation data , edwards approximation , equilibrium curve ) for three different densities , @xmath80 , @xmath81 and @xmath82 .",
    "the ( constrained ) flat measure is an improvement upon equilibrium curve , but even at @xmath81 ( fig .",
    "[ fig:5 ] ) , it somewhat overestimates the oscillations at large distances . for @xmath82 ( fig .",
    "[ fig:6 ] ) , the difference between the three curves is barely visible .",
    "note that for @xmath83 , the pair distribution function is equal to the nearest - neighbor distribution function , hence to the @xmath13-gap distribution function shown in fig .",
    "when the tapping intensity , i.e. , @xmath6 , is finite , one must modify the definition of the stable or `` blocked '' states .",
    "indeed , for finite @xmath7 , the configuration of hard rods obtained after a desorption - adsorption event are no longer characterized by @xmath84 , and the gaps between particles can be larger than one .",
    "one also knows that the tapping intensity @xmath6 is not the proper `` thermodynamic '' parameter to add to the density in order to characterize the macro - state of the system in an edwards - like statistical mechanical approach : the memory effect observed experimentally@xcite and reproduced by the present parking lot model ( see above ) implies that the system can be found in states characterized by the same density @xmath14 and the same tapping intensity @xmath6 that however evolve differently under further tapping with the same intensity , @xmath6 ; as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig:7 ] , the density may increase in one case and decrease in another .",
    "if the tapping intensity is not an appropriate thermodynamic parameter , a natural choice for a two - parameter statistical mechanical description appears to be @xmath15 , the available line fraction , that one can use in conjunction with the density @xmath14 . a non - zero @xmath15 generalizes to a finite tapping intensity",
    ", the prescription uses for vanishingly small intensity namely @xmath84 , and @xmath15 is also directly relevant for describing the compaction kinetics , as shown by eq .",
    "( [ eq:1 ] ) .",
    "we thus consider a statistical mechanical ensemble in which all configurations of non - overlapping hard rods characterized by fixed values of @xmath14 and @xmath15 are equally probable .    denoting by @xmath85 the total length available for insertion for a particle center ( @xmath86 ) ,",
    "the configurational integral with the constraints of fixed @xmath85 , fixed system size @xmath23 , and fixed number of particles @xmath24 is given by    @xmath87    which can be rewritten as before as @xmath88\\right)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath30 and @xmath89 denote two closed contours .",
    "in the macroscopic limit , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath90 with @xmath14 and @xmath15 fixed , one can again use a saddle point method to evaluate the integrals , which leads to @xmath91 where @xmath92 is expressed as @xmath93 with @xmath94 and @xmath95 solutions of the two coupled equations @xmath96 @xmath97 can again be considered as the inverse of the `` compactivity '' , but an additional intensive parameter , @xmath98 , is needed .",

    "the gap distribution functions can also derived by following the same method as in the previous section .",
    "this leads to @xmath105 whereas the multi - gap distribution functions satisfy the factorization property , e.g. , @xmath106 .",
    "notice that the @xmath13-gap distribution function is a piecewise continuous function that obeys the exact sum rules , eqs .",
    "( [ eq:2])-  ( [ eq:4 ] ) .",
    "it is also worth pointing out that the results of section iii ( @xmath60 ) can be recovered by taking the limit @xmath107 in the above equations .",
    "finally , the pair distribution function can be derived along the same lines as shown before and in appendix a , but the calculation is too tedious and not sufficiently insightful to be presented here .",
    "a comparison between the @xmath108-parameter edwards flat measure and the simulation data is shown in figs .",
    "[ fig:8 ] and [ fig:9 ] for the density fluctuations with @xmath109 and @xmath110 , respectively .",
    "we have also plotted the equilibrium curve , @xmath111 , and the @xmath13-dimensional rsa curve@xcite up to @xmath64 .",
    "the @xmath108-parameter flat measure predictions are good but not perfect .",
    "they display the proper non - trivial shape of the @xmath14-dependence , in contradistinction to the equilibrium curve , but there is a significant underestimation of the fluctuations in the density range around the rsa jamming limit .",
    "note that at high density the flat measure is in very good agreement with the simulation data ( at least for @xmath109 ) and does not merge too rapidly with the equilibrium curve as seen above for the case @xmath22 .",
    "the @xmath13-gap distribution functions shown on a log - linear plot in fig .",
    "[ fig:10 ] illustrate also the overall good agreement between the @xmath108-parameter flat - measure predictions and the simulation data .",
    "the edwards approximation captures the change of the slope of the @xmath13-gap distribution function that occurs for @xmath78 ; but the curvature seen in the simulation data for @xmath18 slightly larger than @xmath13 is not correctly reproduced by the @xmath108-parameter flat - measure which predicts an exponential decay with a factor equal to @xmath112 ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq:15 ] ) ) . again , this discrepancy is larger for densities around of the rsa jamming limit ( the two intermediate sets of curves in fig .",
    "[ fig:10 ] ) .",
    "in this work we have applied the statistical mechanical approach based on the `` flat '' measure proposed by edwards and coworkers to the out - of - equilibrium situation obtained in the parking - lot model .",
    "this latter is a microscopic off - lattice model that reproduces the major features of the phenomenology of vibrated granular materials . in the statistical mechanical description ,",
    "a macro - state of the system is characterized by fixed values of two macroscopic quantities , the particle density @xmath14 and the available line fraction @xmath15 ( or rather fixed values of @xmath113 extensive parameters , the number of particles , the system size and the total length available for insertion of particles ) , and all configurations of non - overlapping particles with fixed @xmath14 and @xmath15 are taken as equiprobable .",
    "we show that such an approach misses some of the qualitative signatures of the limiting case of a purely irreversible adsorption process ( rsa ) at the jamming limit .",
    "however , at higher densities , i.e. , in the slow ( logarithmic ) compaction regime , it gives a good , yet not perfect , quantitative description of many observable quantities ( fluctuation , distribution functions ) .",
    "the choice of @xmath114 as an additional `` thermodynamic '' parameter is able to account for situations , encountered in various memory effects , in which macrostates characterized by the same density and the same tapping intensity can nonetheless be different .",
    "the fact that a `` thermodynamic '' approach gives a good description of a model of vibrated granular media is promising . in the one - dimensional model studied here , the generalized `` equation of state '' associated with the flat measure",
    "can be analytically derived so that one can make theoretical predictions concerning , e.g. , the density fluctuations or the structure of the configurations .",
    "however , one still faces the task of predicting the state of the system for a given preparation , i.e. , for a given time ( number of taps ) and a given protocol for the tapping intensity .",
    "we are presently working on this problem .",
    "we introduce the probability density @xmath115 of finding two given particles at a relative distance @xmath116 , such that there is exactly @xmath117 particles between them ; this function can be expressed in terms of the partition function as @xmath118 where @xmath119 can be calculated either with the edwards measure or at equilibrium .    for large @xmath24 , one can use the asymptotic expression of the partition function @xmath120 . at equilibrium @xmath121 whereas with the edwards measure , one gets @xmath122 and @xmath53 given by eq .

    "therefore , the probability density is equal to @xmath123 and , formally , the pair distribution function can be expressed as @xmath124 for hard rods , the partition function @xmath125 is different from @xmath126 for @xmath127 . at equilibrium ,",
