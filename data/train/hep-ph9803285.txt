    "the properties of the eigenvalues of the dirac operator are of great importance for the understanding of certain features of qcd .",
    "for example , the accumulation of small eigenvalues is , via the banks - casher formula @xcite , related to the spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry .",
    "recently , the fluctuation properties of the eigenvalues in the bulk of the spectrum have also attracted attention .",
    "it was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that on the scale of the mean level spacing they are described by random - matrix theory ( rmt ) .",
    "in particular , the nearest - neighbor spacing distribution @xmath1 , i.e. , the distribution of spacings @xmath3 between adjacent eigenvalues on the unfolded scale ( see below ) , agrees with the wigner surmise of rmt . according to the so - called bohigas - conjecture @xcite , quantum systems",
    "whose classical counterparts are chaotic have a nearest - neighbor spacing distribution given by rmt whereas systems whose classical counterparts are integrable obey a poisson distribution , @xmath4 .",
    "therefore , the specific form of @xmath1 is often taken as a criterion for the presence or absence of `` quantum chaos '' .",
    "it should be noted , however , that there is no universally accepted proof of the bohigas - conjecture yet .",
    "the field of quantum chaos is still developing , and there are many open theoretical problems . for reviews on this subject",
    "we refer to ref .",
    "@xcite .    a transition in @xmath1 from wigner to poisson behavior is observed at the localization transition in disordered mesoscopic systems @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the question was raised if there is such a transition from chaotic to regular behavior in the case of the lattice dirac operator , and the present study serves to investigate this question . for a preliminary account of results for quenched qcd ,",
    "see ref .",
    "recently , a wigner to poisson transition was also studied in the context of a spatially homogeneous yang - mills - higgs system @xcite .",
    "the question if chaos in an @xmath5-component @xmath6-theory in the presence of an external field survives quantization was investigated in ref .",
    "an analytical treatment of the transition between wigner and poisson behavior can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in rmt",
    ", one has to distinguish between several universality classes which are determined by the symmetries of the system . for the case of the qcd dirac operator ,",
    "this classification was done in ref .",
    "@xcite . depending on the number of colors and the representation of the quarks ,",
    "the dirac operator is described by one of the three chiral ensembles of rmt .",
    "as far as the fluctuation properties in the bulk of the spectrum are concerned , the predictions of the chiral ensembles are identical to those of the ordinary ensembles @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the dirac matrix was studied in su(2 ) using both staggered and wilson fermions which correspond to the symplectic and orthogonal ensemble , respectively . here",
    ", we study su(3 ) with staggered fermions which corresponds to the chiral unitary ensemble .",
    "we thus cover the last remaining symmetry class in the confined phase .",
    "although the unitary ensemble is , from a mathematical point of view , the simplest one , the rmt result for the nearest - neighbor spacing distribution is still rather complicated . it can be expressed in terms of so - called prolate spheroidal functions , see ref .",
    "@xcite where @xmath1 has also been tabulated . a very good approximation to @xmath1",
    "is provided by @xmath7 this is the wigner surmise for the unitary ensemble .",
    "we generated gauge field configurations using the standard wilson plaquette action for su(3 ) with and without dynamical fermions in the kogut - susskind prescription .",
    "we have worked on a @xmath0 lattice with various values of the inverse gauge coupling @xmath8 both in the confinement and deconfinement phase .",
    "the boundary conditions were periodic for the gluons and periodic in space and anti - periodic in euclidean time for the fermions .",
    "we typically produced 10 independent equilibrium configurations ( separated by 1000 sweeps ) for each @xmath2 .",
    "because of the spectral ergodicity property of rmt one can replace ensemble averages by spectral averages if one is only interested in bulk properties , and thus one does not need a large number of independent configurations to compute @xmath1 .    by definition",
    ", the dirac operator @xmath9 from which the spectrum is calculated does not contain the quark mass term .",
    "the operator is anti - hermitian so that all eigenvalues are imaginary . for convenience ,",
    "we denote them by @xmath10 and refer to the @xmath11 as the eigenvalues in the following . because of",
    "@xmath12 the @xmath11 occur in pairs of opposite sign .",
    "all spectra were checked against the analytical sum rules @xmath13 where v is the lattice volume .    to construct the nearest - neighbor spacing distribution @xmath1 from the eigenvalues , one first has to `` unfold '' the spectra .",
    "this procedure is a local rescaling of the energy scale so that the mean level spacing is equal to unity on the unfolded scale .",
    "one first defines the staircase function @xmath14 to be the number of eigenvalues with @xmath15 .",
    "this staircase function has an average part and a fluctuating part , @xmath16 .",
    "the average part is extracted by fitting @xmath14 to a smooth curve , e.g. , to a low - order polynomial .",
    "one then defines the unfolded energies to be @xmath17 . as a consequence ,",
    "the sequence @xmath18 has mean level spacing equal to unity .",
    "ensemble and spectral averages are only meaningful after unfolding .",
    "we begin the discussion of our results with the pure gluonic case .",
    "figure  [ fig1 ] shows the staircase function @xmath14 which in the continuum is given by @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the spectral density .",
    "note that @xmath20 can not be obtained universally from a random - matrix model .",
    "the staircase function is not very sensitive to the value of @xmath2 , neither in the confinement nor in the deconfinement regime .",
    "however , across the phase transition @xmath14 is diminished for small @xmath21 reflecting the suppression of small eigenvalues .",
    "[ cols=\"<,<,^ , < , < \" , ]     figure  [ fig4 ] compares the nearest - neighbor spacing distribution @xmath1 of full qcd with the rmt result .",
    "no mass dependence is visible .",
    "again , in the confinement as well as in the deconfinement phase we still observe agreement with the rmt result up to @xmath22 ( not shown ) .",
    "the observation that @xmath1 is not influenced by the presence of dynamical quarks could have been expected from the results of ref .",
    "those calculations , however , only apply to the case of massless dynamical quarks . our results , as those of ref .",
    "@xcite , strongly indicate that massive dynamical quarks do not affect @xmath1 either .",
    "no signs for a transition to poisson regularity are found .",
    "thus , the deconfinement phase transition does not seem to coincide with a transition in the spacing distribution .",
    "for very large values of @xmath2 far into the deconfinement region ( not shown ) , the eigenvalues start to approach the degenerate eigenvalues of the free theory , given by @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the lattice constant , @xmath25 is the number of lattice sites in the @xmath26-direction , and @xmath27 . in this case ,",
    "the nearest - neighbor spacing distribution is neither wigner nor poisson .",
    "however , it is possible to lift the degeneracies of the free eigenvalues using an asymmetric lattice where @xmath28 , @xmath29 , etc .",
    "are relative primes @xcite . for large lattices ,",
    "the nearest - neighbor spacing distribution of the non - degenerate free eigenvalues is then given by the poisson distribution . while it may be interesting to search for a wigner to poisson transition on such asymmetric lattices , it is unlikely that such a transition will coincide with the deconfinement phase transition .",
    "we do not believe that the absence of a signature for a transition from wigner to poisson behavior at the deconfinement phase transition is due to the finite lattice size .",
    "even for the small lattice size we used , the agreement of @xmath1 with the rmt curve is nearly perfect .",
    "this leads us to believe that we should have seen some sign of a transition if it existed in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "we have searched for a transition in the nearest - neighbor spacing distribution @xmath1 from wigner to poisson behavior across the deconfinement phase transition of pure gluonic and of full qcd .",
    "such a transition exists , e.g. , at the localization transition in disordered mesoscopic systems @xcite . in a yang - mills - higgs system a smooth transition along a brody distribution was seen @xcite .",
    "we observed no signature of a transition in our data for the lattice dirac matrix , neither for pure su(3 ) nor for full qcd .",
    "the data agree with the rmt result in both the confinement and the deconfinement phase except for extremely large values of @xmath2 where the eigenvalues are known analytically .",
    "our analysis of full qcd with two different quark masses showed no influence on the nearest - neighbor spacing distribution .",
    "our findings are consistent with earlier studies of the chaotic dynamics in classical lattice gauge theories which have shown that lattice gauge theories are chaotic as classical hamiltonian dynamical systems @xcite .",
    "also , it was found recently that the leading lyapunov exponents of su(2 ) yang - mills field configurations indicate that configurations in the deconfinement phase are still chaotic , although less chaotic than in the strong coupling phase at finite temperature @xcite .    in hindsight ,",
    "our results are not totally unexpected .",
    "temporal monopole currents survive the deconfinement phase transition leading to confinement of spatial wilson loops .",
    "thus , even in the deconfinement phase , the gauge fields retain a certain degree of randomness .",
    "it was shown that the relevant parameter that drives the transition from poisson regularity to chaos is of the order of the mean level spacing @xmath30 of the system @xcite .",
    "one could search for a formal separation of the dirac operator into a regular and a chaotic contribution , @xmath31 .",
    "then , a chaotic perturbation of size @xmath32 will generate a wigner distribution .",
    "in future investigations , it would be interesting to try to disentangle the corresponding contributions to the dirac matrix .",
