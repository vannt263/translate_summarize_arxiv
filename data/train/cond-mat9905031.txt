    "the properties of crystalline nanostructures are of considerable interest , because of the technological importance of nanostructures in fabrication of electronic devices . kinetic properties of nanostructures attracted particular attention , since in many cases nanostructures are thermodynamically unstable and tend to decay with time .",
    "such decay processes have been studied both theoretically and experimentally .",
    "considerable effort was devoted to the study of periodic structures .",
    "the decay of one and two dimensional gratings was studied extensively .",
    "the emerging experimental picture@xcite is that below the roughening temperature these structures decay in a shape preserving manner .",
    "macroscopic facets are observed at the maxima and minima of the gratings .",
    "although these systems are out of equilibrium , the appearance of facets is a manifestation of the cusp singularity of the surface free energy at the high symmetry crystalline orientation .",
    "there are basically two theoretical approaches to the problem of surface evolution in general and nanostructure decay in particular . on the one hand",
    ", there are phenomenological models which treat the crystal surface as a continuous medium@xcite .",
    "the evolution of the surface is then driven by the tendency of the system to lower its free energy ( given in terms of continuous spatial variables ) .",
    "the advantage of such models is that they are relatively simple and can sometimes lead to analytical predictions of surface evolution .",
    "however , these models ignore the discrete nature of surface steps , which may become important below the roughening transition . in addition , most of them rely on assumptions of small surface slope and/or surface curvature ( with the exception of ref .  ) , and are unable to properly treat the behavior of the macroscopic facets observed experimentally .    on the other hand , there are models which treat surface evolution on a smaller scale . among these",
    "are microscopic models@xcite , where the basic degrees of freedom are individual atoms , and step flow models@xcite .",
    "these models are usually solved numerically , and provide results which can be directly related to the microscopic dynamics . however , in most cases , it is difficult to understand the behavior of the system on larger length scales on the basis of these results .",
    "research efforts were also directed towards isolated surface structures .",
    "the decay of isolated step bunches , islands or hills was studied both experimentally@xcite and theoretically@xcite .",
    "here too there is an apparent gap between the microscopic and macroscopic theoretical approaches .    in this work",
    "we attempt to bridge over this gap in the case of a simple surface structure , i.e. an infinite crystalline cone .",
    "we give a complete account of the surface dynamics based on a step flow model , and then derive a continuum model which gives a very accurate description of the evolution of the cone and becomes exact in the long time limit .",
    "we do not make any assumptions of small slope or small surface curvature .",
    "the crystalline cone consists of an infinite number of circular concentric steps .",
    "a similar system was studied by rettori and villain@xcite who considered the decay of bidirectional surface modulations .",
    "their results are relevant in the case of small amplitude modulations when the profile peaks and valleys affect each other .",
    "our work addresses the opposite situation when a single peak can be considered as an isolated structure and in this sense is complimentary to theirs .    below the roughening transition atomic steps",
    "have a finite free energy .",
    "their existence on the surface strongly affects its morphological evolution . in many cases",
    ", one can ignore the formation of islands and voids on the surface and consider only adatom diffusion and attachment and detachment processes to and from step edges .",
    "the decay of a nanostructure is then dominated by the motion of steps . in order to describe the decay process mathematically",
    ", one has to solve the diffusion equation for adatoms on the terraces between the steps , with boundary conditions at the step edges , in the spirit of the burton - cabrera - frank model@xcite .",
    "if the geometry of the nanostructure is simple , this procedure leads to a set of coupled equations of motion for the steps .",
    "our goal in the present work is to construct and solve these equations of motion for the simple case of an infinite crystalline cone .",
    "a partial account of this work is found in ref .  . the kinetic step model for the cone",
    "is derived in section ii . in section iii",
    "we carry out numerical simulations of the model and examine the evolution of surface morphology under various conditions .",
    "previous experimental and theoretical research on decay of nanostructures has demonstrated that in most cases the surface reaches a scaling state where the typical length scale depends on time algebraically .",
    "our simulations show that the cone profile also exhibits such a scaling behavior . in section",
    "iv we show analytically that the step flow model admits such solutions .",
    "we calculate the scaling exponents and derive a continuum equation for the scaling function .",
    "the properties of the scaling function are analyzed in sections v and vi .",
    "it has been suggested that in some materials , steps may be permeable to flow of atoms ; i.e. atoms can hop between neighboring terraces without attaching to the step which separates them . in section vii",
    "we discuss the consequences of step permeability on the decay of an infinite cone , and show that permeability does not change the qualitative behavior of the system .",
    "we now consider a crystalline surface which consists of flat terraces , parallel to a high symmetry plane of the crystal and separated by atomic steps .",
    "islands and voids are ignored .",
    "the evolution of such systems of steps was treated long ago by burton , cabrera and frank@xcite ( bcf ) .",
    "the bcf theory assumes that mass transfer between terraces is governed by diffusion of adatoms on the terraces .",
    "these atoms are emitted and absorbed at step edges , which according to bcf act as perfect sinks and sources .",
    "this last assumption , however , is valid only when adatom diffusion is the rate limiting process .",
    "modifications of the bcf model account for the finite rate of adatom attachment - detachment processes at step edges .",
    "the bcf model was also generalized to include elastic and entropic interactions between steps ( see for example refs . ) . in this section",
    "we construct such a generalized bcf model for the morphological evolution of a conic hill on a crystal surface .",
    "consider the surface of an infinite crystalline cone , which consists of circular concentric steps of radii @xmath3 , separated by flat terraces ( fig .",
    "[ cone_picture ] ) .",
    "the index @xmath4 grows in the direction away from the center of the cone .",
    "these steps may absorb or emit atoms , which then diffuse across the neighboring terraces with a diffusion constant @xmath5 .",
    "assuming no deposition of new material , no evaporation and no transport through the bulk , the adatom concentration @xmath6 on the @xmath4th terrace satisfies the diffusion equation @xmath7 where @xmath8 is a two dimensional vector parallel to the high symmetry terraces .",
    "in most situations , the time scale associated with step motion is much larger than the time scale of surface diffusion .",
    "one can therefore assume that the adatom diffusion field is always in a steady state ; i.e. , for any step configuration , the diffusion field reaches a steady state before the steps move significantly . within this quasi - static approximation , the r.h.s .  of the diffusion equation can be neglected .",
    "using the radial symmetry of the cone , we can write the static diffusion equation in polar coordinates as : @xmath9 the general solution of this equation is @xmath10 the coefficients @xmath11 and @xmath12 are determined by the boundary conditions at the step edges . to define these conditions , we assume that the flux of atoms at the two step edges bounding the @xmath4th terrace is determined by first order kinetics , characterized by an attachment - detachment rate coefficient @xmath13 : @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the equilibrium concentration of atoms on the terrace adjacent to the @xmath4th step . using these boundary conditions , we find that the constants @xmath11 are given by @xmath16 employing mass conservation at the step we obtain the step velocity : @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the atomic area of the solid .    in order to complete the solution of the diffusion problem we have to determine the equilibrium adatom concentration at step edges .",
    "this concentration depends on the local step curvature and on the radii of neighboring steps . according to the gibbs - thomson relation ,",
    "@xmath15 is given by @xmath19 in units where the boltzmann constant is equal to 1 . here",
    "@xmath20 is the chemical potential associated with the addition of an atom to the solid at the @xmath4th step , @xmath21 is the temperature and @xmath22 is the adatom equilibrium concentration at the edge of a straight isolated step . to evaluate the step chemical potential , @xmath20 , we take into account the step line tension , @xmath23 , and a repulsive interaction between nearest neighbor steps .",
    "the magnitude of this interaction is inversely proportional to the square of the distance between the steps at large distances .",
    "such a dependence is consistent with entropic as well as elastic@xcite interactions between straight steps .",
    "we follow ref .   and take the interaction energy between step @xmath24 and an atomic segment of the @xmath4th step to be @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the interaction strength .",
    "the chemical potential of the @xmath4th step is then given by @xmath27 } { \\partial r_i}\\;. \\label{eq : full_mu}\\ ] ] this equation applies also to the chemical potential of the first step if we set @xmath28 .    as we show below , in the long time",
    "limit the distance between steps is small compared with the step radius . in this limit",
    "we can approximate the step chemical potential by @xmath29 this approximation simplifies the algebra considerably , and we verified that it does not affect the analytical and numerical results described below .",
    "we are now ready to write down the step equations of motion using eqs .",
    "( [ eq : ais ] ) , ( [ eq : velocity ] ) and the gibbs - thomson relation ( [ eq : gibbsthomson ] ) .",
    "it is convenient to use dimensionless radii , @xmath30 , and dimensionless time @xmath31 : @xmath32 in terms of these variables , the equations of motion take the form @xmath33 eqs .",
    "( [ eq : dimensionlessvelocity ] ) depend on two parameters : @xmath34 measures the strength of step - step interactions @xmath26 relative to the line tension @xmath23 , while the parameter @xmath35 determines the rate limiting process in the system .",
    "when @xmath36 , diffusion across terraces is fast and the rate limiting process is attachment and detachment of adatoms to and from steps . on the other hand ,",
    "when @xmath37 , the steps act as perfect sinks and the rate limiting process is diffusion across terraces .",
    "we integrated eqs .",
    "( [ eq : dimensionlessvelocity ] ) numerically both in the case of diffusion limited kinetics ( dl ) and in the case of attachment - detachment limited kinetics ( adl ) .",
    "the initial configuration was a uniform step train . in principle , the initial step separation is a parameter of the model .",
    "however , for any value of this parameter one can change the units of length and time and get the same equations of motion with initial step separation of unity and different values of the parameters @xmath38 and @xmath39 . thus it is sufficient to consider an initial step separation of unity .    when the repulsive interactions between steps are weak ( i.e. @xmath38 is small ) , there is a striking difference between the dynamics in the dl and adl limits . in the adl case",
    "the system becomes unstable towards step bunching , whereas in the dl case there is no such instability .",
    "however , when @xmath38 is large enough the instability disappears even in the adl case .",
    "let us first discuss situations where the step bunching instability does not occur .",
    "[ traces ] shows the time evolution of the system in the adl and the dl cases with a relatively large value of @xmath38 .",
    "each line in the figures describes the evolution of the radius of one step .",
    "we note that the innermost step shrinks while the other steps expand and absorb the atoms emitted by the first step . when the innermost step disappears , the next step starts shrinking and so on .",
    "our observations indicate that the time at which the @xmath40th step disappears , @xmath41 , grows with @xmath40 as @xmath42 .",
    "this process results in a propagating front , which leaves a growing plateau or a facet at the center of the cone . at large times",
    ", the ( dimensionless ) position of this front behaves as @xmath43 .",
    "this is shown by the dashed lines in fig .",
    "[ traces ] .",
    "this power law is an indication of a much more general and interesting phenomenon .",
    "it turns out that at large times , not only the front position but also the positions of minimal and maximal step densities scale as @xmath44 .",
    "in fact , the step density @xmath45 , defined as the inverse step separation , obeys the following scaling scenario : there exist scaling exponents @xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 , which define the scaled variables @xmath49 and @xmath50 . in terms of these variables @xmath51 where the scaling function @xmath52 is a _ periodic _ function of @xmath53 with some period @xmath54 .",
    "our ansatz is somewhat weaker than standard scaling hypotheses , which would assume the scaling function @xmath52 is independent of @xmath53 .",
    "we introduce this periodic dependence because our simulations strongly indicate a periodic behavior , generated by the motion of the first step ( see fig .",
    "[ traces ] ) .",
    "thus the disappearance time of step @xmath40 is @xmath55 .",
    "an immediate consequence of the scaling ansatz is that if we define @xmath56 with @xmath57 , and plot @xmath58 against @xmath59 , all the data with different values of @xmath40 and the _ same _ value of @xmath60 collapse onto a single curve , @xmath61 .    to verify that our system obeys this scaling ansatz",
    ", we define the step density at a discrete set of points in the middle of the terraces : @xmath62 fig .",
    "[ scaling ] shows plots of @xmath45 as a function of @xmath63 for a fixed value of @xmath60 and 6 different values of @xmath40 in the adl and the dl cases .",
    "the excellent data collapse shows that our scaling ansatz indeed holds with @xmath64 , @xmath65 and @xmath66 in both cases .",
    "we now turn to discuss effects of interactions between steps .",
    "as shown above , the behavior of the cone in the adl and the dl limits is very similar when the repulsion between steps is strong .",
    "we have already mentioned that when the repulsion is weak , the behavior of the system in the dl limit is very different from its behavior in the adl case .",
    "this is not surprising , since linear stability analysis ( see appendix a ) of the two cases in the absence of step - step interactions predicts that the adl case is unstable towards step bunching while the dl case is marginal . in intermediate cases ( @xmath67 )",
    "the system is unstable when the interactions are sufficiently weak .",
    "fig.[dl_lowint ] shows the time evolution and the data collapse of the density function in the dl case when step - step interactions are weak .",
    "as one can see , the behavior of the cone is qualitatively similar to the large @xmath38 example ( fig .",
    "[ traces ] ( b ) ) and that the scaling ansatz still holds .",
    "quantitatively , the step density near the facet edge is much higher for small values of @xmath38 .",
    "also the dependence of the scaling function on scaled time within a collapse period is much more pronounced when the interactions are weak .",
    "the dependence of step kinetics on the strength of the interactions is much more complicated in the adl case .",
    "fig.[transition ] shows the evolution and when possible , the scaled density function of a series of adl systems which differ in the value of @xmath38 .",
    "the two quantitative observations we made in the dl case hold also here : the high step density region near the front becomes more dense , and the time dependence of the scaling function becomes more pronounced as the value of @xmath38 is reduced ( fig.[transition ] ( a)-(d ) ) .",
    "in addition , we noted that the approach of the system towards the scaling state is slower .",
    "adjacent to the dense region at the edge of the facet is another region of very low density of steps .",
    "this region becomes less dense as the value of @xmath38 is reduced . below a critical value , @xmath68 , of the interaction parameter , a few steps between the low density region and the facet edge form a bunch . at this stage",
    "the scaling ansatz breaks down .",
    "the system no longer exhibits a simple periodic nature , which results from the collapse of single steps , one at a time .",
    "instead , it seems to adopt a complicated almost periodic pattern which involves the collapse of many steps in each period ( fig .  [ transition ]",
    "hints for this periodicity changes are already present in fig .",
    "[ transition ] ( a ) and ( c ) , where the steps crossing the low density region follow a threefold periodicity .",
    "if the value of @xmath38 is further reduced , bunches of steps collapse together , and finally the whole system becomes unstable toward step bunching ( fig .",
    "[ transition ] ( f ) ) .",
    "neighboring steps merge and form a bunch , which in turn merges with another bunch and so on .",
    "step bunches rather than isolated steps become the dynamic objects in the system .",
    "the above results suggest that when the step bunching instability does not occur , the time evolution of the system can be described by a step density function , which is continuous in both position and time variables . in this section",
    "we derive such a continuum model by carrying out a scaling analysis .",
    "we obtain an equation which governs the scaling function and evaluate the scaling exponents analytically .    motivated by the simulation results , we assume that at long times the scaling ansatz , eq .",
    "( [ eq : scaling ] ) , holds .",
    "this together with conservation of the total volume of the system , already determines the two scaling exponents @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "first , we derive a relation between these scaling exponents by considering the height profile @xmath69 . assuming steps of unit height , the height difference between two points on the surface is given by the number of steps between them .",
    "the continuous analog of this statement can be used to derive the following relation between the height profile and the step density : @xmath70 where @xmath71 is the height at the origin . far enough ( in the limit @xmath72 ) , @xmath69 does not change with time . calculating the height change at infinity using eq.([eq : height ] )",

    "( [ eq : scaling ] ) ) of the scaling function @xmath52 .",

    "@xmath48 satisfies the relation @xmath75 , and therefore we have @xmath76 .",
    "this and the @xmath77 dependence in eq.([eq : hzero ] ) lead to the relation @xmath78 .",
    "in addition , conservation of the total volume of the system , @xmath79 , implies that @xmath80 is independent of @xmath31 .",
    "integration by parts of the derivative of this integral with respect to @xmath31 yields the following equation : @xmath81 evaluating this integral in terms of the function @xmath52 and the scaled variables @xmath59 and @xmath53 we obtain the equation @xmath82dx=0\\;.\\ ] ] this can be satisfied for all @xmath53 only if @xmath64 , since @xmath52 is a periodic function of @xmath53 . combining this result with the previously obtained relation @xmath78 , we conclude that @xmath83    thus , @xmath48 is the only nontrivial scaling exponent in the model .",
    "to evaluate @xmath48 and the scaling function @xmath52 , we continue with the equation for the full time derivative of the step density @xmath84 : @xmath85 eq .",
    "( [ eq : partials ] ) can be evaluated in the middle of the terrace between two steps ( i.e. at @xmath86 ) .",
    "the l.h.s.of ( [ eq : partials ] ) is calculated by taking the time derivative of eq .",
    "( [ eq : discretedens ] ) : @xmath87 .",
    "this together with the fact that @xmath88 leads to the relation @xmath89    now we change variables to @xmath53 and @xmath90 ( since @xmath65 ) , and transform eq .",
    "( [ eq : partials2 ] ) into an equation for the scaling function @xmath52 : @xmath91 the step velocities @xmath92 and @xmath93 can also be expressed in terms of the @xmath94 s , but we defer this algebraic manipulation to a later stage .    our next goal is to take a continuum limit of eq .",
    "( [ eq : partial3 ] ) in the variable @xmath95 .",
    "such a continuum limit becomes exact in the long time limit . to see this ,",
    "let us rewrite eq .",

    "limit these differences become vanishingly small .",
    "this justifies the continuum limit in the variable @xmath59 .    in practice , we take the continuum limit in the following way .",
    "we evaluate the function @xmath52 at the position @xmath98 by using it s taylor expansion @xmath99 as long as @xmath13 is finite , the difference @xmath100 is small in the long time limit .",
    "it is therefore useful to expand @xmath101 around @xmath59 @xmath102 and insert this expansion into eq .",
    "( [ eq : taylorexpansion ] ) .",
    "the resulting equation is expanded as a power series in @xmath97 . by requiring that the equation be obeyed to all orders in @xmath97",
    ", we can calculate the coefficients @xmath103 for any desired @xmath13 and @xmath40 .",
    "these coefficients will involve the function @xmath52 and its derivatives with respect to @xmath59 , which are all periodic functions of @xmath53 .",
    "next , we express the velocities @xmath104 and @xmath105 in terms of the scaled radii @xmath106 , @xmath107 ,  , @xmath108 using eq .",
    "( [ eq : dimensionlessvelocity ] ) and the transformation to scaled variables .",
    "we then use eq.([eq : xisexpansion ] ) to expand the velocities in powers of @xmath97 .",

    "the full expressions are given in appendix b. the existence of derivatives up to fourth order in this equation is a consequence of the fact that each step `` interacts '' with four other steps ( two on each side ) through the equations of motion ( [ eq : dimensionlessvelocity ] ) . inserting eqs .",

    "our expansion in the small parameter @xmath97 is valid only at values of @xmath59 where @xmath52 does not diverge or vanish ( see above ) .",
    "therefore , the first term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : partials4 ] ) is @xmath117 .",
    "this term has to be canceled by the second term if we require @xmath52 to satisfy a single differential equation .",
    "hence , we must have @xmath118 the fourth term vanishes as @xmath119 since @xmath120 , and the third term must vanish as well .",
    "therefore , in the large @xmath53 limit , @xmath52 is only a function of @xmath59 , and we are left with an ordinary differential equation for @xmath52 : @xmath121 the detailed form of this equation in the dl and adl cases is also given in appendix b.    let us emphasize several important properties of our scaling analysis .",
    "first , the values of the scaling exponents we calculated ( @xmath64 , @xmath65 and @xmath66 ) are consistent with the results of numerical simulations ( see above ) . secondly , our continuum model is valid for arbitrarily large surface curvature and slope ( unlike other treatments @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , since our model is an expansion in the truly small parameter @xmath97 ( see eq.([eq : xsdifference ] ) ) it becomes _ exact _ in the large @xmath53 ( long time ) limit .",
    "finally , note that in going to the continuum limit we lost the periodic dependence of @xmath52 on @xmath53 .",
    "this periodicity is generated by the first step which follows a unique equation of motion .",
    "we did not incorporate this unique behavior into the continuum model and therefore should not be surprised that this information is lost .",
    "as we emphasized , our continuum model is an exact representation of the original discrete system . for this reason it is interesting to compare it with other continuum models , which do not emerge as limits of discrete systems of steps .",
    "many authors use the continuity equation @xmath122 to account for the surface evolution . here",
    "@xmath123 is the surface height and @xmath124 is the current density of diffusing adatoms .",
    "this equation is of course correct and reduces the problem to calculating @xmath124 .",
    "it is widely assumed @xcite that @xmath124 is proportional to the gradient of the surface chemical potential @xmath125 , as expected in diffusive systems . in the case of attachment - detachment limited systems",
    "it was suggested by nozieres @xcite that the chemical potential gradient should be divided by the profile slope .",
    "our model is consistent with the first picture in the dl case and with the second in the adl case .    to show this we take the gradient of eq .",

    "our numerical solutions for the scaling function indicate that all physical solutions indeed have such a special point , which can be identified as the facet edge .",
    "let us examine the behavior of the step density on the facet and at its edge . at any given time",
    "there is only one single step on the facet ( the first step during its collapse towards the origin ) .",
    "we have seen that the size of the facet grows indefinitely , and therefore the step density on the facet vanishes in the long time scaling limit . moreover , in appendix c we show that in the long time limit , the step density is a continuous function even at the facet edge ; i.e. , it goes to zero continuously as the facet edge is approached from above .    denoting the scaled position of the facet edge by @xmath135 , the above observations can be expressed in the form @xmath136 note that @xmath137 is not a solution of eq.([eq : differentialeq ] ) .",
    "this does not contradict the continuum model , since the model was derived only for the case of a finite step density ( see eq .",

    "when the repulsive interactions are strong enough , the decay of the cone proceeds through the collapse of the innermost steps , one step at a time .",

    "the values of the scaling exponents which fit our simulations are @xmath64 , @xmath65 and @xmath66 .",
    "following this observation we used a scaling ansatz to transform the discrete step flow model into a continuum description of surface evolution .",
    "the basic predictions of this continuum model are the values of the scaling exponents ( which agree with the simulation results ) and a differential equation for the scaling function @xmath52 .",
    "this continuum model becomes exact in the long time scaling limit , and it breaks down whenever the step density vanishes .",
    "this fact can be seen both from the derivation of the continuum model and from the resulting differential equation , which predicts a singular behavior at the zeros of the scaling function @xmath52 .",

    "although our work provides a detailed account of the decay process of an infinite cone , it leaves a few unresolved issues .",
    "first and most important is the fact that we were not able to uniquely determine the value of @xmath135 . we did show that @xmath135 depends crucially on the detailed collapse process of the innermost step , which is not included in the continuum model .",
    "thus , in order to evaluate @xmath135 , one has to deal directly with the discrete step system .",
    "another open issue related to the behavior of the innermost step is the periodic behavior of the scaling function .",
    "this periodicity is observed in the kinetics of the discrete system of steps , and is absent from the solution of the continuum equation .",
    "lastly , when the repulsive interaction between steps is weaker than a certain threshold , the system becomes unstable and step bunches are formed .",
    "the critical value of the interaction below which this instability occurs and its dependence on the kinetic parameter @xmath39 have not been studied so far .",

    "as well the existence of a scaling state does not depend on the detailed form of the repulsive interactions between steps .",
    "a quantitative change of these interactions may alter the scaling function , @xmath52 , but the scaling exponents do not change . another manifestation of the robustness of the scaling solution is the effect of step permeability . in principle , step permeability could have changed the scaling behavior of the system entirely .",

    "<S> we describe the decay kinetics in terms of step flow models . </S>",
    "<S> numerical simulations of the models indicate that in the attachment - detachment limited case the system undergoes a step bunching instability if the repulsive interactions between steps are weak . </S>",
    "<S> such an instability does not occur in the diffusion limited case . in stable cases </S>",
    "<S> the height profile , @xmath0 , is flat at radii @xmath1 . outside this flat region </S>",
    "<S> the height profile obeys the scaling scenario @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> a scaling ansatz for the time - dependent profile of the cone yields analytical values for the scaling exponents and a differential equation for the scaling function . in the long time </S>",
    "<S> limit this equation provides an exact description of the discrete step dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> it admits a family of solutions and the mechanism responsible for the selection of a unique scaling function is discussed in detail . </S>",
    "<S> finally we generalize the model and consider permeable steps by allowing direct adatom hops between neighboring terraces . </S>",
    "<S> we argue that step permeability does not change the scaling behavior of the system , and its only effect is a renormalization of some of the parameters .    </S>"
