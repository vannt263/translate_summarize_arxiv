    "in the early 1980s conway and gordon  @xcite showed that every embedding of @xmath0 , the complete graph on seven vertices , in @xmath1 contains a nontrivial knot . a graph with this property",

    "a graph @xmath3 with a given property is said to be * minor minimal * with respect to that property if no proper minor of @xmath3 has the property .",
    "it is easy to show that a graph is ik iff it contains a minor that is minor minimal intrinsically knotted ( mmik ) .",
    "robertson and seymour s graph minor theorem  @xcite says that in any infinite set of graphs , at least one is a minor of another .",
    "it follows that for any property whatsoever , there are only finitely many graphs that are minor minimal with respect to that property . in particular , there are only finitely many mmik graphs . furthermore , deciding whether one graph is a minor of another can be done algorithmically .",
    "hence , if we knew the finite set of all mmik graphs , we would be able to decide whether or not any given graph is ik .",
    "however , obtaining this finite set , or even putting an upper bound on its size , has turned out to be very difficult . in contrast , robertson , seymour , and thomas @xcite settled the corresponding question for * intrinsically linked * ( il ) graphs  i.e. , graphs for which every embedding in @xmath1 contains a nontrivial link  in 1995 : there are exactly seven mmil graphs ; they are obtained from @xmath4 by @xmath5 and @xmath6 moves ( we will define these shortly ) .",
    "prior to this work 41 mmik graphs were known .",
    "we have found 222 new mmik graphs , as well as many more ik graphs that are likely minor minimal . in this paper",
    "we describe these 222 graphs . for 101 of them",
    "we give a `` traditional '' proof that they are ik .",

    "the reverse of this operation is called a * @xmath6 move*. note that in a @xmath6 move , the vertex @xmath13 can not have degree greater than three .",
    "( there is various terminology for this in the literature : @xmath17 = triangle = delta = @xmath18 ; @xmath19 = wye = star ; move = exchange = transformation . )     and @xmath6 moves .",

    "the set of all cousins of @xmath3 is called the * @xmath3 family*.    sachs @xcite observed that every child of an il graph is il . essentially the same argument shows that every child of an ik graph is ik . as a corollary of @xcite , we also know that every parent of an il graph is il .",

    ".families of the 222 new mmik graphs . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     the graphs we study here fall into several families .",
    "below we give a quick overview of our results , which are summarized in table  [ tblresults ] ; details are provided in the following sections , with one section devoted to each family .",
    "some of these families contain a large number of graphs ; we used a computer program to construct these families .",
    "the @xmath0 family consists of 20 graphs , 14 of which were previously known to be mmik .",
    "we show the remaining 6 are not ik ( this was also shown , independently , in @xcite ) .",
    "the @xmath24 family consists of 58 graphs , 26 of which were previously known to be mmik .",
    "we show the remaining 32 are also mmik .",
    "the @xmath25 family consists of 110 graphs .",
    "we show that all are ik and exactly 33 of them are mmik .",
    "the @xmath26 family consists of 1609 graphs .",
    "we show they are all ik and at least 156 of them are mmik . for 101 of these 156 graphs ,",
    "we prove the graph is mmik without making use of the computer program of @xcite .",
    "sampling results obtained by computer suggest that well over half of the graphs in this family are mmik .",
    "the @xmath27 family consists of over 600,000 graphs ; we do nt know the exact number .",
    "we only show that @xmath27 itself is mmik .",
    "note that in each family all graphs have the same number of edges since @xmath5 and @xmath6 moves do not change the number of edges in a graph .",
    "however , if two edges of a @xmath19 are part of a triangle , then a @xmath6 move on that @xmath19 results in double edges ( i.e. , two edges with the same endpoints ) ; in this case we say that the initial graph has a @xmath28 .",
    "it turns out that there is no graph with a @xmath28 in the families of each of the graphs @xmath0 , @xmath24 , @xmath29 , @xmath26 , and @xmath30 .",
    "( this last graph is described below . )",
    "the @xmath27 family , however , does contain graphs with a @xmath28 . whenever our computer program that generates these families encounters a @xmath28 , it does not perform a @xmath6 move on that @xmath28 , since the resulting graph , after deleting one of its double edges ,",
    "would have fewer edges than the initial graph .",
    "( we prefer to consider graphs with different number of edges to be in distinct families . )",
    "note that a graph obtained by performing a @xmath6 move on a @xmath28 followed by deleting one of the resulting double edges can also be obtained by just contracting one of the edges in the @xmath28 .",
    "so it might be interesting to perform such @xmath6 moves and study the resulting graphs ; they might lead to new mmik graphs :    find an example of a mmik graph that results from contracting an edge of a @xmath28 in the family of some other mmik graph .",
    "in particular , this would be a way to move from the family of one mmik graph to that of another .",
    "we will not pursue this further here as our examples of a @xmath28 are in the @xmath27 family , which is already huge even without considering additional graphs constructed in this way .    although verifying that a given graph is mmik can be laborious , using our computer program to generate new candidates for mmik graphs turned out to be relatively quick . considering the ease with which we found families of new mmik graphs",
    ", we expect there are many more such families . since we know of no upper bound on the number of mmik graphs",
    ", it seems that until there is more progress in the theory , it may not be worthwhile to continue the search for more mmik graphs .",
    "instead , we propose a couple of questions regarding the size of a mmik family .",
    "the @xmath27 example shows that these families can become quite large .",
    "however , the question of the smallest family remains open .",
    "in particular , we can ask :    is there a mmik graph that is its own family ?",
    "such a graph would be both childless and parentless .",
    "one way to approach this might be to investigate the following .",
    "given an arbitrary graph , is there an efficient way of finding , or at least estimating , how many cousins it has ?",
    "for example , the mmik graph described by foisy in @xcite , which has 13 vertices and 30 edges ( @xmath30 ) , has more edges than any of the graphs mentioned above .",
    "so we were surprised to learn that its family consists of only seven graphs , making it the smallest family known to us that contains a mmik graph .",
    "finally , we remark that our study includes a description of four new mmik graphs on nine vertices : @xmath29 , @xmath26 , and cousins 12 and 41 of the @xmath24 family .",
    "a computer search  @xcite suggests that these , along with the known ( i.e. , as in @xcite ) mmik graphs in the @xmath0 and @xmath24 families , form a complete list of mmik graphs on nine or fewer vertices .",
    "in particular , we expect that the families described in this paper include all mmik graphs with at most nine vertices .",
    "family . ]    . ]    figure  [ figk7f ] shows the family of 20 graphs derived from @xmath0 by @xmath6 and @xmath5 moves .",
    "an edge list for each of these 20 graphs can be found in the appendix  @xcite .",
    "graphs at the same horizontal level have the same number of vertices , beginning with @xmath0 ( cousin  1 ) at the top and concluding with a 14vertex graph , @xmath31 ( cousin  18 ) , at bottom .",
    "edges join parent to child .",
    "the numbering of the cousins is somewhat arbitrary : it reflects the order in which these graphs were constructed via @xmath5 and @xmath6 moves by our algorithm .",
    "note that cousin  9 is labeled @xmath32 in @xcite , and cousins  16 and 20 are labeled @xmath33 and @xmath34 in @xcite .",
    "kohara and suzuki  @xcite earlier described @xmath0 and its 13 descendants .",
    "none of the six remaining cousins , 9 , 14 , 16 , 17 , 19 , and 20 are ik .",
    "this follows as cousins  17 and 19 have unknotted embeddings , as shown in figure  [ figc179 ] , and cousins  9 , 14 , 16 , 20 are ancestors of cousins  17 and 19 .",
    "( the unknotted embeddings of figure  [ figc179 ] were derived from the unknotted embedding of cousin  20 that appears as figure  2 in @xcite . )",
    "thus , the @xmath0 family yields no new examples of mmik graphs .",
    "this has also been shown , independently , by hanaki , nikkuni , taniyama , and yamazaki @xcite .",
    "we remark that @xmath32 ( cousin  9 ) , a graph on nine vertices and 21 edges , is the smallest graph that is not ik but has an ik child .",
    "indeed , it follows from @xcite that descendants of a non - ik graph on fewer edges or fewer vertices would be @xmath23-apex and , therefore , not ik by lemma  [ lem2ap ] .",
    "descendants of a graph on 20 or fewer edges also have 20 or fewer edges and , so , are @xmath23-apex . as for graphs on eight vertices ,",
    "the non - ik examples with 21 or more edges are all subgraphs of two graphs , @xmath35 and @xmath36 , on eight vertices and 25 edges ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* figure 7 ) ) .",
    "as all descendants of these two graphs are @xmath23-apex , the same is true of descendants of any subgraphs of @xmath35 or @xmath36 .",
    "it turns out that by adding one edge to @xmath32 one can obtain a mmik graph ; we call this graph @xmath25 and describe its family in section  [ sectione9efamily ] .",
    "family . ]    figure  [ figk3311f ] ( produced using mathematica ) shows the 58 graphs derived from @xmath24 by @xmath5 and @xmath6 moves .",
    "edge lists for these graphs can be found in the appendix  @xcite .",
    "the graphs range from the 8 vertex graph @xmath24 ( cousin 1 ) through the 14 vertex graph cousin 42 ( called @xmath37 in @xcite ) .",
    "kohara and suzuki  @xcite described the graph @xmath24 and its 25 descendants .",
    "these 26 graphs were already known to be mmik  @xcite .",
    "as we will now show , the remaining 32 graphs in the family are also mmik .",
    "the 58 graphs in the @xmath24 family are all mmik .",
    "we first observe that all graphs in the family are ik .",
    "for this , it suffices to show that the four parentless cousins , 1 , 12 , 41 , and 58 , are intrinsically knotted .",
    "foisy  @xcite proved this for cousin 1 , @xmath24 .",
    "we handle the remaining three graphs by using the computer program described in @xcite to verify that in every embedding of the graph there is a @xmath7 minor that contains a knotted hamiltonian cycle .    having established that all graphs in the family are ik , by lemma  [ lemytmmik ] , we can conclude that they are all mmik once we ve shown this for the four childless cousins , 29 , 31 , 42 , and 53 .",
    "we do know that descendants of @xmath24 are mmik .",
    "this combines work of kohara and suzuki  @xcite ( who argued that , if @xmath24 is mmik , then all of its descendants are too ) and foisy  @xcite ( who proved that @xmath24 is mmik ) .",

    "[ lemc53]cousin 53 ( figure  [ figc53symm ] ) of the @xmath24 family is mmik .",
    "let @xmath3 denote cousin 53 .",
    "as in the proof above , all graphs in the family are ik , including @xmath3",
    ". since @xmath3 has no isolated vertices , it will be enough to show that @xmath10 and @xmath11 have knotless embeddings for every edge @xmath9 in @xmath3 .",
    "as in figure  [ figc53symm ] , the graph has an involution @xmath38 .",
    "this allows us to identify the 22 edges in pairs with the exception of the edges @xmath39 and @xmath40 ( which are fixed by the involution ) .",
    "thus , up to symmetry , there are 12 choices for the edge @xmath9 and 24 minors ( @xmath41 or @xmath11 ) to investigate .",
    "the argument is based primarily on the embedding of @xmath3 shown in figure  [ figc53 ] , for which there is a single knotted cycle @xmath42 , as well as four crossings , labeled @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 in the figure . by flipping ( i.e. , interchanging the over- and undercrossing arcs ) at selected crossings , we construct two additional embeddings , each having a unique knotted cycle .",
    "let s call the representation of @xmath3 shown in the figure embedding 1 .",
    "if we flip the crossing a , we have what we will call embedding 2 whose unique knotted cycle is @xmath47 . for embedding 3",
    ", we flip the crossings a and c , which gives the knotted cycle @xmath48 .    out of the 12 choices for an edge @xmath9 ,",
    "all but one occurs as an edge either in the knotted cycle of embedding 1 or else in that of embedding 2 . for each such @xmath9",
    ", this gives an unknotted embedding of @xmath41 .",
    "the remaining possibility is @xmath49 ( or , equivalently , @xmath50 ) . in this case , deleting vertices @xmath23 and @xmath51 from @xmath52 results in a planar graph ( this is not obvious from figures  [ figc53symm ] or [ figc53 ] , but is easy to verify manually or using mathematica ) .",

    "similarly , contracting either edge @xmath55 or @xmath56 in embedding 1 leads to an unknotted embedding of @xmath11 . embedding 2 shows that @xmath11 is unknotted for @xmath57 , @xmath39 , @xmath58 , and @xmath59 , while embedding 3 does for @xmath60 and @xmath61 .    for each of the remaining three choices of @xmath9",

    ", we construct @xmath192 , another embedding of @xmath107 , and its links @xmath193 , in the usual way by applying the @xmath66cycle @xmath123 to the vertex indices of @xmath173 . using the same type of argument as above",
    ", we can see that @xmath194 or @xmath195 ( the only case that requires any cuts is when @xmath188 is combined with @xmath196 , where we cut @xmath197 along @xmath198 and @xmath199 along @xmath167 ) . as we showed earlier , @xmath128 or @xmath127 ; and we can show @xmath200 combined with either @xmath126 or @xmath127 yields a @xmath7 ( for @xmath200 with @xmath126 , cut 47351 along 13 ; for @xmath200 with @xmath127 , no cuts ) ; we therefore conclude that if @xmath200 and @xmath114 are both linked , then there is a knotted @xmath7 .",
    "similarly , we know @xmath159 or @xmath160 ; and we can show @xmath195 combined with either @xmath201 or @xmath160 produces a @xmath7 ( for @xmath195 with @xmath201 , cut 47251 along 187 ; for @xmath195 with @xmath160 , cut 47251 along 24 ) ; hence @xmath114 and @xmath195 give a @xmath7 .",

    ", the same argument can be applied to each @xmath207 , @xmath203 .",
    "since @xmath208 becomes @xmath114 after applying the involution @xmath209 , which is a symmetry of @xmath26 , we can likewise assume @xmath208 , and hence every @xmath210 is unlinked .",

    "thus , only pairs of the form @xmath121 with @xmath219 , @xmath68 , or @xmath174 are linked .",
    "now , if @xmath220 and @xmath152 are both linked , we get a knotted @xmath7 by doing a few cuts at various stages ( cut @xmath221 along @xmath145 , @xmath222 along @xmath156 , @xmath223 along @xmath224 , and @xmath225 along @xmath226 ) .",

    "in particular , @xmath245 , @xmath246 , and @xmath247 .",
    "these three implications together give @xmath248 .",
    "we ve already seen that @xmath220 and @xmath152 together give a @xmath7 .",

    "thus we conclude that @xmath250 , which , by symmetry , gives @xmath251 applying implication ( [ eqn-33 ] ) repeatedly gives @xmath252 , which means if @xmath220 is linked , we get a knotted @xmath7 ( since @xmath220 and @xmath152 give a @xmath7 ) . by symmetry , we get a knotted @xmath7 if any @xmath204 is linked . this , and implications ( [ eqn-5to3 ] ) and ( [ eqn-8to3 ] ) , together imply that if any @xmath205 or @xmath206 is linked ,",
