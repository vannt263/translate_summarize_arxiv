    "quantum control @xcite has attracted much attention in recent years and it has found potential applications in many fields such as quantum information processing , quantum chemistry and quantum simulation . among these quantum control problems ,",
    "state transfer is a central task .",
    "various methods such as quantum optimal control and lie group decompositions have been used to design control laws to drive quantum systems to target states or to realize some specific operations @xcite .",
    "quantum lyapunov control was proposed in the early 2000s as a good candidate for state transfer@xcite .",
    "this strategy has been widely studied recently both in theory and applications @xcite , because it offers a simple and effective way to design control fields .",
    "however , the problem of speeding up lyapunov control has not been widely considered to date .",
    "quantum lyapunov control is practically employed in an open - loop way without measurement and feedback .",
    "hence , it is quite natural to shorten the evolution time so as to overcome the decoherence effect induced by inevitable interactions with the surrounding environment .    in quantum lyapunov control , a function @xmath1 ,",
    "called a lyapunov function of quantum states , is specified to design time - varying control fields .",
    "the system converges to the target state given by @xmath2 while @xmath1 decreases to its minimum .",
    "based on this concept , we present a scheme to optimize lyapunov control by using the following idea : speed up evolution to the target state by making @xmath1 decrease faster .",
    "generally , the total hamiltonian in a quantum control system can be written in two parts @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the free ( internal ) hamiltonian and @xmath5 are external control hamiltonians with @xmath6 representing the corresponding control fields .",
    "these control fields should be designed to ensure @xmath7 .",
    "in fact , there are many ways to choose @xmath6 to achieve this goal . in this paper",
    ", we consider the question : with given control hamiltonians @xmath5 , how should we design the shape of the control fields @xmath6 in order to make @xmath1 decrease fastest .",
    "it is shown that one can enable @xmath1 to decrease faster simply by enhancing the strength of the control fields . however , strong control fields may not be feasible and always bring unwanted results , for example a large energy ( power ) cost , invalidation of mathematical approximation and treatment for the system . in view of these factors ,",
    "we propose two designs for the control fields .",
    "one is under the constraint that the power - type quantity @xmath8 is bounded .",
    "the other is under the constraint that the strength of each field is bounded .",
    "these designs for control fields make @xmath1 decrease as fast as possible within given limitations .",
    "the second design has the simple form of  bang - bang \" control which is easy to be implemented in an experiment .",
    "we also illustrate our control method with a three - level system .",
    "the results suggest that the evolution time is significantly reduced compared with the conventional method .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sec.ii , we derive control fields for a general lyapunov function @xmath9 under the two aforementioned constraints . in sec.iii , we simulate our field designs and compare them with the conventional method .",
    "the robustness of the optimal lyapunov designs is analyzed in sec.iv .",
    "finally , we summarize our work in sec . v.",
    "in quantum lyapunov control , the system is steered from an initial state to a target state by control fields designed using lyapunov function @xmath1 .",
    "the goal of this paper is to obtain optimized control fields that make the time derivative of the lyapunov function @xmath10 largest so as to speed up the evolution to the target state .",
    "we start from a closed quantum system described by the liouville equation @xmath11 , \\label{eqn : le}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath4 is the free hamiltonian for the controlled system and @xmath12 is a time - dependent hamiltonian representing coupling to external control fields which is called the control hamiltonian .",
    "we have set @xmath13 and assume that the system is controllable . in lyapunov control , the solution of eq.([eqn : le ] ) converges to the minimum of @xmath14 .",
    "meanwhile , the state converges to a set of states characterized by the la salle s invariance principle @xcite .",
    "the control hamiltonian @xmath12 can be written in the form , @xmath15 where @xmath5 @xmath16 are time - independent hermitian operators corresponding to different types of external control and @xmath6 are time - varying real functions , usually representing electro - magnetic fields .",
    "@xmath17 is a positive integer .    in this paper",
    "we consider the following form of lyapunov function @xmath18 where @xmath19 is a hermitian operator and assumed to be positive semi - definite in order to satisfy the standard requirement for a lyapunov function , @xmath20 @xcite . also , some other forms of lyapunov function can be described by eq.([eqn : lya ] ) , such as that based on the hilbert schmidt distance @xcite .",

    "the lyapunov control strategy requires @xmath7 .",
    "there are many ways to design @xmath6 to satisfy this requirement .",
    "a simple and conventional way is to let @xmath25 with @xmath26 so that @xmath27 with such control fields , @xmath1 will decrease to its minimum and state @xmath23 will converge to the target state @xmath28 with the same spectrum as the initial state @xmath29 and satisfying @xmath30)=0 $ ] @xcite .    in the conventional field design method , the amplitude of the control fields @xmath6 is proportional to @xmath31 .",
    "that means when @xmath31 is small ( for example , when @xmath23 is very close to @xmath28 ) , @xmath6 will become small leading to a slow decreasing of @xmath1 and a long evolution time .",
    "our aim is to determine optimized control fields @xmath6 to enable @xmath1 to decrease as fast as possible in order to speed up control . from eq.([eqn : dv ] ) it is seen that if each @xmath6 has a different sign to the corresponding @xmath31 , then @xmath32 and large @xmath33 will lead to fast decreasing of @xmath1 .",
    "therefore , the problem has to be discussed under a constraint on the control fields @xmath6 . considering the following reasons for constraining the control fields : first",
    ", one often wishes control fields to be weak in order to reduce energy ( power ) costs .",
    "second , strong external control fields may lead to invalidation of the modeling of the system .",
    "third , strong fields may disturb neighboring quantum systems that we do not want to disturb .",
    "we propose two designs of control fields under constraints on the power of the control fields ( constraint a ) and on the strength of each control field ( constraint b ) , respectively .",
    "first , we consider the following constraint on the control fields @xmath34 since the control fields @xmath6 are always associated with the amplitude of the electro - magnetic fields , the quantity @xmath35 can be interpreted as a power - type quantity",
    ". we will call it power for simplicity in the following .",
    "the total power of the control fields is bounded in this case .",
    "consider @xmath36 ( @xmath37 ) in time @xmath38 and the constraint for @xmath6 is @xmath39 . in order to determine the optimized control fields that minimize @xmath40 ( @xmath41 is negative )",
    ", we use the lagrange multiplier method .",
    "let @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the lagrange multiplier , and @xmath44 represents @xmath6 at a certain time @xmath38 .",
    "then from the following equations @xmath45 it is easy to obtain the amplitude of the fields @xmath44 at time @xmath38 , @xmath46 with @xmath22)$ ] .",
    "the corresponding time derivative of lyapunov function is @xmath47 it is seen that @xmath41 is proportional to @xmath48 , so we choose @xmath49 for a faster decreasing of @xmath1 and our control design for all evolution time reads @xmath50 note that when @xmath23 reaches the final state @xmath28 , all @xmath51)$ ] become zero and all control fields are switched off .",
    "considering that @xmath23 converges to @xmath28 asymptotically , we will switch off the control fields after @xmath52 where @xmath53 denotes some measurement for the distance between @xmath23 and @xmath28 and @xmath54 is the required precision .    in the case",
    "@xmath55 , i.e. , there is only one control hamiltonian , our control design reduces to @xmath56 which has a simple  bang - bang \" control form . with its discrete shape of the control fields",
    ", this control design should be easy to realize experimentally @xcite .",
    "next , we will find the optimized control fields when the strength of each field is bounded . for simplicity , we assume the maximum strength of every control field @xmath6 is @xmath57 @xmath58 , i.e. , latexmath:[\\ ] ] with free hamiltonian @xmath63 * where the energy difference between @xmath64 and @xmath65 ( @xmath65 and @xmath66 ) is @xmath67 ( @xmath68 ) .",

    "additionally , in the pure state case , this lyapunov function can be explained as the hilbert schmidt distance between @xmath74 and @xmath75 . recall that @xmath76 , and @xmath77 our control design in this example acts to make the distance between @xmath74 and @xmath75 decrease as fast as possible with a given restriction on the control fields .     *",

    "these fields are switched off at @xmath108 when @xmath84.,width=321 ]    next , we employ the control design eq.([eqn : fna ] ) under the constraint on the power of control fields . in order to be comparable with the last example , the maximal power @xmath78 and initial state are chosen to be the same as the above one .",
    "results in fig.[fig : opta](a ) show that the evolution time for @xmath102 is @xmath109 which is evidently shorter than that shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : usl ] .",
    "control fields are plotted in fig.[fig : opta](b ) which have a sinusoidal shape . in this example , for all the time before control fields are switched off , the power of control fields remains constant and the shapes of fields are optimized so that the lyapunov function decreases fastest under constraint a. we can see this from evolution of @xmath10 in fig.[fig : opta](a ) ( blue dotted line ) .",
    "now we study the control design eq.([eqn : fnb ] ) under constraint b. for comparison , we let the maximal strength @xmath57 and the initial state be the same as that in the first simulation . the simulation results are illustrated in fig.[fig : bbc ] .",
    "the evolution time for @xmath102 is @xmath110 which is about @xmath111 percent of the first example . in this example , the control fields shown in fig.[fig : bbc](b ) are step - like .",
    "such a control method makes lyapunov function decrease fastest under the restriction of strength and has the advantage of being easy to be implemented in experiment .",
    "the evolution of @xmath10 is not smooth ( shown in fig.[fig : bbc](a ) by blue dashed line ) , which is due to the discrete control fields .",
    "furthermore , we plot in fig.[fig : logcomp ] the evolution of @xmath112 for the three designs of control field with @xmath113 randomly chosen initial states ( @xmath114^t$ ] , where @xmath115 are random numbers uniformly created between @xmath72 and @xmath116 , @xmath117 is a normalization factor ) respectively .",
    "the simulations show that the convergence rate for the usual control design is exponential where the evolution time grows linearly with the distance between the actual and target states @xmath53 , whereas the convergence rate of our two methods is larger than the conventional one , especially when the control fidelity is required to be high .",
    "the reason is our methods keep @xmath10 at its maximum for all the evolution even if @xmath31 is very small .",
    "for the three control designs with logarithmic scale .",
    "( a),(b ) and ( c ) correspond to the conventional control field design , the design under constraint a , and that under constraint b , respectively .",
    "each picture is a result averaged over 50 random initial states .",
    "the convergence speed of ( b ) and ( c ) is faster than that of ( a ) as these figures show.,width=302 ]    we found that some of the control fields may oscillate with very high frequency at the end of the control in eq.([eqn : fnb ] ) with constraint b. the oscillation depends on the initial state and the distance between the actual and target states .",
    "the reason of this oscillation is as follows . when the state is close to the target state , some @xmath31 become very small leading to ineffectiveness of the corresponding control field @xmath6 .",
    "while in conventional lyapunov control , the control field @xmath6 decreases to zero with @xmath118 . in our method , however , @xmath6 is designed to take the value @xmath57 or @xmath119 , which makes the state oscillate almost every step of simulation .",
    "this problem can be solved by averaging the control fields over a proper time period and then use the reshaped fields instead of the oscillating one .",
    "in fact , this average can be used in the situation when the control fields are not a ( fast ) oscillating function of time , it yields the same control fields and maintains the results .",
    "it is worth noting that the convergency depends on the amplitude of the control fields , when the control fields oscillate very fast , the lyapunov function @xmath1 almost stops to decrease .",
    "this is different from the conventional lyapunov design where @xmath1 keeps decreasing with the amplitude of the control fields approaching zero .",
    "this suggests that we can adjust the convergency by properly designing the amplitude of the controls fields",
    ". we will show and prove this point in the future work .",
    "one may wonder if these optimal designs improve the robustness of the lyapunov - based control . in the following",
    ", we shall examine this problem following the representations in @xcite by calculating an average fidelity of the system with hamiltonian uncertainties , decoherence and field fluctuation in the controls eq.([eqn : exmp ] ) . here the average fidelity is defined by @xmath120 , @xmath121 denotes the actual state evolving from a random initial state under the control with uncertainties , decoherence or fluctuations . in other words ,",
    "the average is taken over @xmath122 actual states , each evolves from a randomly chosen initial state , driving by the controls with uncertainties , decoherence or fluctuations .",
    "our focus is on whether the optimal designs is robust against these uncertainties compared with the conventional one .     and ( b ) for @xmath123 .",
    "the blue triangle , green star and black circle represent the fidelity obtained by bang - bang control design , design with power constraint and the conventional one , respectively.,width=321 ]    we begin with analyzing robustness against the uncertainty in the free hamiltonian @xmath124 the uncertainties can be taken into account by adding a perturbation @xmath125 to the free hamiltonian , i.e. , @xmath126 here @xmath127 with @xmath128 a real number and @xmath129 the generators in eq.([eqn : gen ] ) . for simplicity , we examine separately the 8 uncertainties @xmath130 @xmath131 .",
    "the equation @xmath132 $ ] is simulated for the three designs with the same control fields and the same parameters as in section @xmath133 .",
    "selected results are showed in fig.[fig : hamrobust ] where the fidelity @xmath134 is an average over fidelities from 1000 randomly chosen initial states .    .",
    "the blue triangle , green star and black circle represent bang - bang control design , design with power constraint and the conventional one , respectively.,width=321 ]    the simulations show that , ( 1 ) the optimal lyapunov control is robust against the uncertainty @xmath135 , and is sensitive to that of @xmath123 ; ( 2 ) the bang - bang design is more robust than the design with power constraint , and the conventional design has the worst robustness . in fact , the robustness against the uncertainty @xmath136 is similar to fig.[fig : hamrobust](a ) and robustness against the uncertainties @xmath137 is roughly similar to fig.[fig : hamrobust](b ) . thus here we only show the robustness of the control against the uncertainties @xmath135 and @xmath138 this conclusion confirms that the system is sensitive to the uncertainties that commute with the free hamiltonian , while it is robust against the uncertainties that does not .",
    "we next discuss the robustness against decoherence . in this discussion , we assume that states @xmath65 and @xmath64 are long lived , namely only the spontaneous emission @xmath139 and @xmath140 is assumed .",
    "this can be described by @xmath141 with @xmath142 and @xmath143 . with this assumption ,",
    "the target state is not a steady state , so the fidelity will be affected seriously .",
    "however , the optimal controls are better than the conventional one due to the short time needed to drive the quantum system from an initial state to the target state . as we did in fig.[fig : hamrobust ] , we calculate the average fidelity for the three control designs with 1000 random initial state and fixed @xmath144 .",
    "the results are depicted in fig.[fig : fid_gamma ] . in this case , the fidelity of the two optimal designs is obviously higher than the conventional design .    the robustness against field fluctuations ( with zero - mean ) and errors in the initial state is also explored .",
    "the results are similar to that in @xcite , namely the control field fluctuation with zero mean affects the fidelity slightly , while it depends sharply on the fluctuation with non - zero mean , and the final fidelity is sensitive to the initial state . in these cases ,",
    "the optimal control has no advantage with respect to the conventional one .",
    "the cooling of mechanical resonators @xcite becomes an active research topic in recent years due to its potential applications in detecting extremely small displacement and observing quantum phenomenon of macroscopic mechanical object . in this section",
    ", we apply the lyapunov control to cooling a nano - mechanical resonator .",
    "the results show that it is possible to cool a nano - mechanical system to its ground state by lyapunov control , the optimized control design leads to a shorter cooling time with respect to the conventional control design .",
    "consider a nano - mechanical resonator ( called target ) with frequency @xmath67 coupled to the other microwave ( optical ) oscillator ( auxiliary system ) , the microwave oscillator has a sufficiently higher frequency @xmath145 such that it can be prepared in its ground state at finite temperature . in the language of lyapunov control ,",
    "the free hamiltonian of the composite system is given by @xmath146 we assume the coupling hamiltonian of the two oscillators has the following form , @xmath147 with @xmath148 and @xmath149 .",
    "this type of hamiltonian can be realized by coupling the target to a lc oscillator and the coupling rate @xmath150 can be modulated by the voltage of the lc circuit @xcite .    in the sideband cooling , @xmath150 is modulated at @xmath151 so that the two resonators are effectively coupled and the rotating wave approximation ( rwa ) applies when the coupling @xmath152 is weak .",
    "recently , the authors of @xcite shown that quantum control can improve the cooling , when the control goes beyond the rwa in the ultra - strong coupling regime @xmath153 @xcite . here , we show that we can obtain the control design by the lyapunov functional , and the optimized lyapunov design can shorten the cooling time .",
    "denote the state of the two resonators by @xmath23 , we can choose the lyapunov function as @xmath154 namely , we choose the mean phonon number of the target resonator as the lyapunov function , which is non - negative and becomes zero when the target system is cooled to its ground state . by the same procedure ,",
