    "in a previous paper @xcite we dealt with the properties of @xmath4 interactions at rhic - energies at @xmath5=200 gev in great detail with emphasis on the nature of the most important observables .",
    "the gold - gold interactions constituted a relatively heavy system . compared to it ,",
    "the @xmath6 system represents a lighter and smaller system - size , with mass - number for copper being much less than gold . besides , in ref .",
    "@xcite we also gave the details about the essential points of the basic multiparticle production model applied therein .",
    "so , in order to avoid repetitions , we will just give a very brief sketch of the main / major observables that would here be dealt with and on the same model that we make use of here .",
    "our purpose is to check ( i ) whether the same model could explain the data measured for a comparatively lighter system ; ( ii ) whether [ and to what extent ( if at all ) ] there is any prominent system size effect on the results obtained by the experimental measurements .",
    "apart from the nature of @xmath1-spectra and some particle - production ratios , we will dwell upon here properties of nuclear modification factors @xmath2 and @xmath3 for @xmath6 collisions and the centrality dependence of the results .",
    "but production of the heavies and the heavy strange hadrons are left out in the present work .    as our approach to the analysis of @xmath6 collisions ( or for that matter , of @xmath4 and even @xmath7 reactions )",
    "is somewhat different from the ` standard ' varieties , our phrases and vocabularies are not identical with them .",
    "we have inducted here the physics of partonic multiple scatterings for both nucleus - nucleus interactions , and @xmath7 reactions at large-@xmath1 through some mechanism as given in the text in the appropriate place .",
    "even the effects of rescatterings have also been incorporated here by the same technique .",
    "but , the associated hadronic collectivity factor ( gauged by the elliptic flow represented normally by ` @xmath8 ' ) has not been touched upon here ; this flow - behaviour would be dwelt - upon in some detail in a future work .    in order to dispel any misunderstanding of any interested reader ,",
    "let us emphasise here , before closing up the introductory remarks , that our intention is not to make any tall claim that the model tried out and tested here is much better than the existing models .",
    "but , our objective is just to familiarise the fact that modest description of data is quite possible even with some non - standard approaches , like the present one , which is being applied and validated to explain some observables in high energy collisions since the mid - seventies .    finally , the organization of this work is as follows . in section 2",
    "we sum up the main physics - aspects entailed in this work .",
    "a glance and a glimpse into it would reveal the non - standard nature of the basic approach . in the next section ( section 3 )",
    "the results arrived at have been presented with tables and figures .",
    "the section 4 provides some comparison of our work with both data and the results obtained by other model - based approaches for a very few observables related to the production of some very select secondaries ( for which theory - based studies on @xmath6 collisions are available ) . and in the last section ( section 5 ) we offer the final comments and conclusions .",
    "the description of the model - based features would be subdivided into some parts .",
    "the first part(subsection 2.1 ) gives a brief overview of the production mechanism of the secondary hadrons in nucleon - nucleon ( @xmath7 ) interaction in the context of the sequential chain model ( scm ) .",
    "then in the subsection 2.2 we present a brief outline of the main and major achievements of the model ; these points , in essence , also highlight the important characteristics of the model .",
    "thereafter , the relevant transitions for different observables from @xmath7 to @xmath9 interactions will be discussed in the subsection 2.3 .      according to this sequential chain model ( scm ) , high energy hadronic interactions boil down , essentially , to the pion - pion interactions ; as the protons and neutrons are conceived in this model as @xmath11  =  ( @xmath12@xmath13@xmath14 ) and @xmath15  =  ( @xmath16 [ @xmath17(@xmath13@xmath13@xmath14)+@xmath18(@xmath19@xmath12@xmath14 ) ] ) repectively , where @xmath14 is a spectator particle needed for the dynamical generation of quantum numbers of the nucleons and @xmath17 , @xmath18 are the weightage factors @xcite-@xcite . our focus and concern",
    "would now be confined and concentrated to the structure of protons alone .",
    "the production of pions in the present scheme occurs as follows : the incident energetic @xmath20-mesons in the structure of the projectile proton(nucleon ) emits a rho(@xmath21)-meson in the interacting field of the pion lying in the structure of the target proton , the @xmath21-meson then emits a @xmath20-meson and is changed into an omega(@xmath22)-meson , the @xmath22-meson then again emits a @xmath20-meson and is transformed once again into a @xmath21-meson and thus the process of production of pion - secondaries continue in the sequential chain of @xmath21-@xmath22-@xmath20 mesons .",
    "the two ends of the diagram contain the baryons exclusively @xcite-@xcite .    for @xmath23(@xmath24)or @xmath25 production",
    "the model proposes the following mechanism .",
    "one of the interacting @xmath20-mesons emits a @xmath21-mesons ; the @xmath21-mesons in its turn emits a @xmath26-meson and a @xmath20-meson .",
    "the @xmath20-meson so produced then again emits @xmath21 and @xmath26 mesons and the process continues .",
    "the @xmath26 mesons so produced now decays into either @xmath27 or @xmath25 pairs .",
    "the @xmath21-@xmath20 chain proceeds in any fenymann diagram in a line with alternate positions , pushing the @xmath26 mesons ( as producers of @xmath27 or @xmath25 pairs ) on the sides .",
    "this may appear paradoxical as the @xmath26 production cross - section is generally smaller than the @xmath28 production cross - section ; still the situation arises due to the fact that the @xmath26 resonances produced in the collision processes will quickly decay into @xmath28 pairs , for which the number of @xmath26 will be lower than that of the @xmath28 pairs .",
    "besides , as long as @xmath26 mesons remain in the virtual state , theoretically there is no problem , for @xmath29 ( or @xmath30 ) is an observed and allowed decay mode , wherein the strangeness conservation is maintained with the strange - antistrange coupled production .",
    "moreover , @xmath29 ( or @xmath31 ) coupling constant is well known and is measured by experiments with a modest degree of reliability .",
    "and we have made use of this measured coupling strength for our calculational purposes , whenever necessary .",
    "it is assumed that the @xmath27 and @xmath25 pairs are produced in equal proportions @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the entire production process of kaon - antikaons is controlled jointly by the coupling constants , involving @xmath21-@xmath20-@xmath32 and @xmath26-@xmath27 or @xmath26-@xmath33 .",
    "now we describe here the baryon - antibaryon production . according to the scm mechanism",
    ", the decay of the pion secondaries produces baryon - antibaryon pairs in a sequential chain as before .",
    "the pions producing baryons - antibaryons pairs are obviously turned into the virtual states . and",
    "the proton - antiproton pairs are just a part of these secondary baryon - antibaryon pairs . in the case of baryon - antibaryon pairs",
    "it is postulated that protons - antiprotons and neutrons - antineutrons constitute the major bulk , production of the strange baryons - antibaryons are far less due to the much smaller values of the coupling constants and due to their being much heavier .",
    "the field theoretical calculations for the average multiplicities of the @xmath20 , @xmath34 and @xmath35-secondaries and for the inclusive cross - sections of those secondary particles deliver some expressions which we would pick up from @xcite-@xcite .    the inclusive cross - section of the @xmath19-meson produced in the @xmath7 collisions given by @xmath36 with @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the normalisation factor which will increase as the inelastic cross - section increases and it is different for different energy region and for various collisions , for example , @xmath39 for intersecting storage ring(isr ) energy region .",
    "the terms @xmath1 , @xmath40 in equation ( 1 ) represent the transverse momentum , feynman scaling variable respectively .",
    "moreover , by definition , @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the longitudinal momentum of the particle .",
    "the @xmath43 in equation ( 2 ) is the square of the c.m .",
    "energy .",
    "@xmath44 of the expression ( 1 ) is the ` constituent rearrangement term ' arising out of the partons inside the proton which essentially provides a damping term in terms of a power - law in @xmath1 with an exponent of varying values depending on both the collision process and the specific @xmath1-range .",
    "the choice of @xmath45 would depend on the following factors : ( i ) the specificities of the interacting projectile and target , ( ii ) the particularities of the secondaries emitted from a specific hadronic or nuclear interaction and ( iii ) the magnitudes of the momentum transfers and of a phase factor ( with a maximum value of unity ) in the rearrangement process in any collision . and this is a factor for which we shall have to parameterize alongwith some physics - based points indicated earlier .",
    "the parametrization is to be done for two physical points , viz . ,",
    "the amount of momentum transfer and the contributions from a phase factor arising out of the rearrangement of the constituent partons . collecting and combining all these , we proposed the relation to be given by @xcite @xmath46 where @xmath47 denotes the average number of participating nucleons and @xmath48 values are to be obtained phenomenologically from the fits to the data - points .",
    "in this context , the only additional physical information obtained from the observations made here is : with increase in the peripherality of the collisions the values of @xmath48 gradually grow less and less , and vise versa .    similarly , for kaons of any specific variety ( @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath49 or @xmath50 ) we have    @xmath51    with @xmath52 for isr energies and with    @xmath53    and for the antiproton production in @xmath54 scattering at high energies , the derived expression for inclusive cross - section is    @xmath55    with @xmath56 and @xmath57 is the mass of the antiprotons .",
    "for ultrahigh energies    @xmath58      we agree that the word ` non - standard ' used in the preceding section is a @xmath59 adjective , with many layers of meaning hidden within it . in this particular case , ( i )",
    "the model is based on some new ideas about the structure of hadrons and the nature of hadronic interactions ; ( ii ) the proposed mechanism underlying this work does not admit of any airtight compartmentalisation of the ` soft ' ( low-@xmath1 ) and ` hard'(large @xmath1 , @xmath60 gev / c ) production ; ( iii ) rather , the model presents a unified approach to the production of particle - secondaries ; ( iv ) besides , the fundamental expressions for final ( analytical ) calculations are derived here on the basis of field - theoretic considerations and the use of feynman diagram techniques ( albeit with some simplifying high energy approximation and assumptions ) with the infinite momentum frame tools and under impulse approximation method ; ( v ) this approach establishes the @xmath61 aspect of the multiplicity of high energy interaction called ` globality property ' ; ( vi ) the model explains the ` jet'-structure for emanation of the secondary particle as the @xmath62 of hadrons , ( vii ) it reproduces the behaviour of average multiplicity , nature of ( invariant ) inclusive cross - section and the properties of average transverse momenta of various secondaries ; ( viii ) the model could also account for the very slow rising nature of the total cross - sections .",
    "( ix ) besides , this model can / does explain the majority of the characteristics of what are known or believed to be the ` quark gluon plasma'-diagnostics . and that could be obviously done by an alternative approach and outlook .",
    "( x ) furthermore , the application of the model can also accommodate a large amount of very important cosmic ray physics issues and problems that came to the fore in the very recent times .",
    "the above - mentioned features are essentially ingrained in the entirety of this totally non - standard mechanism emerging from an alternative philosophy and outlook about the particle - constituents and their interaction mode . on the whole , this is purely an analytical approach with a reasonable number of valid assumptions and approximations which are commonly used by all high energy physicists .",
    "uptil now , we have confined ourselves mostly to the non - simulational calculations .",
    "the calculations for  softand ` hard ' have been superposed here by virtue of the simple factorisation property .",
    "one of the very strong points about this model is the fact that the various coupling strengths used in this model are not only known but also reliably well - measured by several experiments .",
    "this factors helps to reduce considerably the speculative components in the results .      in order to study a nuclear interaction of the type @xmath64 , where @xmath65 and @xmath66 are projectile and target nucleus respectively , and @xmath67 is the detected particle which , in the present case , would be @xmath19 , @xmath24 and @xmath35 , the scm has been adapted , on the basis of the suggested wong @xcite work to the glauber techniques by using wood - saxon distributions @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the details of calculations and the features of the scm have been given in our previous paper @xcite .",
    "the general form of our scm - based transverse - momentum distributions for @xmath68-type reactions can be written in the following notation : @xmath69    the set of relations to be used for estimating the parameter @xmath70 is given below @xcite .",
    "@xmath71 here , in the above equation [ eqn.(9 ) ] , @xmath72 , as stated above , is the normalization constant which is different for the different secondaries and the collider energies .",
    "it also depends on the centrality of the collisions .",
    "the first factor in eqn.(9 ) gives a measure of the number of wounded nucleons i.e. of the probable number of participants , wherein @xmath73 gives the probability cross - section of collision with ` @xmath66 ' nucleus ( target ) , had all the nucleons of @xmath65 suffered collisions with @xmath66-target .",
    "and @xmath74 has just the same physical meaning , with @xmath65 and @xmath66 replaced .",
    "furthermore , @xmath75 is the nucleon(proton)-nucleus(a ) interaction cross - section , @xmath76 is the inelastic nucleon(proton)-nucleus(b ) reaction cross - section and @xmath77 is the inelastic @xmath78 cross - section for the collision of nucleus @xmath65 and nucleus @xmath66 .",
    "the values of @xmath77 , @xmath79 , @xmath80 are worked here out in a somewhat heuristic manner by the following formula @xcite @xmath81 with @xmath82 mb , @xmath83 .",
    "besides , in expression ( 9 ) , the second term is a physical factor related with energy degradation of the secondaries due to multiple collision effects .",
    "the parameter @xmath84 occurring in eqn.(9 ) above is a measure of the fraction of the nucleons that suffer energy loss .",
    "the maximum value of @xmath84 is unity , while all the nucleons suffer energy loss .",
    "this @xmath84 parameter is usually to be chosen @xcite , depending on the centrality of the collisions and the nature of the secondaries .",
    "the values of @xmath85 in eqn .",
    "( 9 ) are different for different secondary produced ; for example , @xmath85= 2.38 for pions , 6.35 for kaons and 25.4 for protons , as were given in eqn.(1 ) , eqn.(4 ) and eqn.(6 ) .",
    "@xmath86 of the expression ( 8) is the ` constituent rearrangement term ' arising out of the partons inside the proton which essentially provides a damping term in terms of a power - law in @xmath1 with an exponent of varying values depending on both the collision process and the specific @xmath1-range .",
    "we have already mentioned the details earlier .",
    "the values of @xmath87 of the equation ( 8) for different secondaries have been calculated with the help of eqn.(1 ) , eqn.(2 ) , eqn.(4)-eqn.(7 ) .",
    "at the very start let us present a summary ( which might be a rehash of what we have mentioned ) of the key physical facts that would be of paramount importance which proceeding towards calculations .",
    "there are some foundational steps that enable us to arrive at the final working formulae which deliver the results to be reported here for for @xmath6 collisions .",
    "the procedural steps are as follows : ( i ) firstly , we have the basic model for @xmath7 scattering at high energies and low-@xmath1 ( ` soft ' ) interactions , so we have to convert the mathematical expressions for nucleus+nuclus ( @xmath6 ) collisions by introducing the nuclear dependence factor on the results arrived at for @xmath7 collisions . ( ii )",
    "secondly , the data - points on @xmath6 reaction at various high energies exceed the range of the low-@xmath1 boundary , @xmath88 gev / c , for which the large-@xmath1 effect is to be superposed on the expressions for soft - production of the secondaries .",
    "the constituent(partonic ) rearrangement factor introduced here takes care of this physical feature arising out of the ` hard ' ( large-@xmath1 ) contributions .",
    "( iii ) in a model - dependent way the scm has some special and specific means of excess production of the positive secondaries , specifically the light secondaries .",
    "the general expressions of inclusive cross - sections for the production of @xmath19 , @xmath24 and @xmath35 for @xmath7 collisions were stated in the previous section by eqn.(1 ) , eqn.(4 ) and eqn.(6 ) respectively .    for the production of @xmath19-mesons in @xmath7 collisions , we use eqn.(1 ) , eqn.(2 ) and eqn.(9 ) with @xmath89 .",
    "the values of @xmath90 , @xmath91 and @xmath92 are given in table 1 .",
    "the experimental data for the inclusive cross - sections versus @xmath93 $ ] for @xmath13 production in @xmath7 interactions at @xmath5 = 20 gev are taken from ref .",
    "@xcite . and for the data for inclusive cross - sections for @xmath12 at energies @xmath5 = 63 gev and @xmath5 = 200 gev we use references @xcite , @xcite , @xcite respectively .",
    "they are plotted in figure 1(a ) , figure 1(b ) and figure 1(c ) respectively .",
    "the solid lines in those figures depict the scm - based plots .              *",
