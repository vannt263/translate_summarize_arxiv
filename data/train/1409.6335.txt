    ", we suggest that it is improbable that the orbit of wasp-84b could have circularised and re - aligned from the eccentric , misaligned orbit likely to have arisen from migration via a high - eccentricity pathway .",
    "we suggest that wasp-84b probably migrated to its current 8.52-d orbit via interaction with the protoplanetary disc .",
    "this would make it the first short - orbit , giant planet to have been shown to have done so .",
    "another candidate for disc migration is hat - p-17b , which has a slightly larger scaled semi - major axis ( a/  = 22.6 cf .",
    "21.6 ) and a slightly smaller mass ratio ( /  = 0.00059 cf .",
    "0.00078 ) .",
    "though hat - p-17b may be aligned ( @xmath74 ) , @xcite find that the data weakly favour a misaligned orbit .",
    "further , the orbit is eccentric ( @xmath75 ) and the system is old ( 7.8 @xmath14 3.3 gyr ; @xcite ) .",
    "thus the evidence for disc migration is less compelling .",
    "a broad range of obliquities has been found for hot - star systems (  @xmath5 6250k ) , whereas cool - star systems tend to be aligned .",
    "this has been interpreted as evidence for realignment by tidal dissipation , which is suggested to be efficient for cool stars with their deep convections layers and inefficient for hot stars that lack substantial convective envelopes @xcite . for viscous dissipation in a convective layer ,",
    "the timescale for spin - orbit alignment is proportional to both the sixth power of the scaled orbital separation , ( @xmath7/)@xmath76 , and the square of the star - to - planet mass ratio , ( /)@xmath77 , .",
    "thus , if short - orbit , giant planets migrate via high - eccentricty pathways and realign via tidal dissipation then , for cool stars , there should be a trend from spin - orbit alignment for close - in planets to a broad range of obliquities for those in more distant orbits .",
    "we selected those cool - star systems with @xmath78 k ( to account for uncertainties ) and with a mean uncertainty on @xmath47 less than @xmath79 .",
    "their spin - orbit angles are plotted in figure  [ fig : obliq - dist ] , as a function of orbital distance in units of stellar radii @xmath80 , which is determined directly from the depth and width of the transit lightcurve @xcite .",
    "we see that @xmath47 is confined to within @xmath81 of aligned at orbital separations of @xmath82 15 stellar radii and that the distribution is broad at greater separations .",
    "no such pattern is observed for hot stars , which exhibit a broad distribution of @xmath47 at @xmath83 .",
    "this suggests that a high fraction of hot jupiters orbiting cool stars used to be misaligned and that tides changed that initial distribution either by realigning the orbits or by destroying misaligned planets .",
    "we note that orbits shorter than @xmath83 are circular , whereas longer orbits are often eccentric ( figure  [ fig : obliq - dist ] ) .",
    "as tides become ineffective with sufficient distance from the star , the population that we are beginning to see at @xmath84 may be close to the initial distribution in spin - orbit angle .",
    "the misaligned and/or eccentric systems are suggestive of high - eccentricity migration and the aligned , circular system of wasp-84 is suggestive of disc - driven migration . thus both pathways appear to factor in the inward migration of giant planets ; by measuring more systems in the weak - tide regime we can determine their relative contributions .",
