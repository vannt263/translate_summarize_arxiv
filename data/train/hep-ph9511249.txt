    "topological soliton models for structure and dynamics of baryons are based on effective nonlinear lagrangians for selected mesonic degrees of freedom .",
    "these usually comprise the set @xmath6 of pseudoscalar goldstone bosons of spontaneously broken chiral symmetry , but also the light vector meson octet , and axial vector mesons have been included .",
    "chiral perturbation theory ( chpt )  @xcite provides a systematic way to establish order by order the effective lagrangian @xmath7 for the pseudoscalar chiral goldstone bosons . to the extent that the relevant coupling constants can be fixed with sufficient accuracy for",
    "a consistent description of low - energy mesonic processes , the resulting part of the effective lagrangian ideally should coincide with the chiral lagrangian underlying the soliton model for baryons .",
    "this must be so because far away from the center of a soliton the fluctuations of the chiral field describe mesons which should interact in the same way as the mesons in the vacuum sector .",
    "it is always the first step in the actual use of a chiral effective lagrangian to construct a static solution @xmath8 which minimizes the classical effective action .",
    "depending on boundary conditions , chiral lagrangians allow for topologically distinct sets of classical solutions , characterized by suitable integer winding numbers @xmath9 .",
    "following skyrme  @xcite and witten  @xcite , the identification of the topological index @xmath9 with baryon number @xmath10 , establishes a close link between the concepts of chpt and soliton models for baryons .    although it is quite remarkable that the presently known low - energy coupling constants of chpt support stable static soliton solutions , there still are crucial differences in the practical application of both concepts :    in chpt the scale of external momenta involved in a physical process limits the chiral order @xmath11 to which the effective lagrangian @xmath12 has to be considered : ( u ) = _ i=2,4,6, .. ^i = i _ c_i ( l_)^i d^3x where @xmath13 denotes the chiral gradients l_= u^_u .    for a soliton solution in the @xmath10=1 sector",
    "the gradients of the soliton profile are of the order of @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the typical size of the soliton . for @xmath16 fm",
    "we have @xmath17 700 mev , i.e. the gradients typically are of the order of the @xmath18-mass @xmath19 .",
    "this excludes a justification based on the power of chiral gradients , for truncating the effective lagrangian to some low chiral order .",
    "the limitation to low powers of @xmath13 in @xmath12 which is necessary for practical reasons , then implies the _ assumption _ that the renormalized coupling constants @xmath20 for @xmath21 are so small that effects of the omitted higher - order terms may be safely neglected .",
    "numerous investigations of the ( chiral - order - four ) skyrme model and higher - order extensions have shown , that chiral profile and baryonic properties in tree approximation do not differ drastically , if only the size of the soliton is of comparable magnitude .",
    "in fact , to some extent this holds even for chiral lagrangians with vector mesons included , which effectively sum up terms to arbitrarily high chiral orders  @xcite .",
    "going beyond the classical tree approximation requires evaluation of the chiral field fluctuations @xmath22 around the static soliton @xmath8 u(,t)= u_0 ( ) .",
    "one - loop corrections only involve the interaction @xmath23 of the fluctuations with the soliton background field ; higher loops involve also their mutual interactions .",
    "it is essential that the hamiltonian @xmath24 which underlies the dynamics of these fluctuations be consistent with the equation of motion which determines the static soliton itself .",
    "( otherwise zero modes will no longer be zero modes , terms linear in the fluctuational fields will not vanish , and the meson - soliton interaction @xmath23 will depend on the choice of the parametrization chosen for the fluctuational field . ) therefore in @xmath25 all terms have to be kept which arise from the full effective lagrangian used in tree approximation to evaluate the classical soliton .",
    "renormalization of loop corrections  @xcite then requires counter terms which already in one - loop approximation renormalize the parameters of _ all _ higher chiral orders in the effective lagrangian @xmath12 .",
    "still , as stated for the meson sector in weinberg s power - counting rule  @xcite , the renormalized coupling constants for the terms of some given chiral order @xmath26 pick up loop contributions only from those terms in @xmath27 with chiral order @xmath28 and less .",
    "this allows for the important fact that renormalization in the meson sector simultaneously renormalizes also the soliton sector .",
    "however , the resulting finite loop - corrections to physical quantities involve _ all _ powers of the terms kept in the lagrangian and can not be truncated because the gradients involved are not small .",
    "this is an important difference to the procedures applied in the meson sector and it rules out early attempts  @xcite to calculate loop corrections in the soliton sector by counting chiral orders in the same way as in the meson sector .",
    "so , to restate the essentials : i ) the renormalization of loops in the soliton sector leads to the _ same _ renormalized coupling constants as in the meson sector .",
    "ii ) the finite loop contributions to the observables of interest contain _ all _ powers of the terms which are kept in the effective lagrangian , i.e. they comprise _ all _ chiral orders .",
    "iii ) a truncation of the effective lagrangian can _ not _ be justified on grounds of increasing chiral order , but it implies the _ assumption _ that the renormalized coupling constants for the omitted terms are very small .",
    "( such a statement of course is scale dependent ) .    from the foregoing it",
    "is quite evident that using the established parts of the effective chiral lagrangian in the soliton sector lacks the rigor of the systematic chpt scheme , while going beyond the established parts turns this fundamental tool into a mere qcd - inspired _ model _ for baryon structure and dynamics .",
    "while in chpt loop corrections are in tight correspondence with higher orders in the chiral expansion , in the soliton sector tree , one - loop , two - loop approximation etc . merely represent the first terms in the @xmath0 expansion , with each term comprising _ all _ chiral orders , independent of the maximal chiral order @xmath29 kept in the effective action .",
    "thus , evaluation of one - loop corrections in the soliton sector provides information not only about the magnitude of these @xmath0- corrections , but an eventually remaining scale dependence of physical observables indicates how seriously the lack of rigor may affect the results .",
    "as an example let us consider the nucleon mass in more detail . in an effective field theory characterized by a classical ( euclidean )",
    "action @xmath30 the mass of the lowest quantum eigenstate is given by  @xcite m=- _",
    "s^e where @xmath31 limits the ( imaginary-)time integral in the action @xmath30 . tree and one - loop approximation",
    "are the leading and next - to - leading - order terms in a @xmath0 expansion of the action s^e = s_0^e - d^e + where @xmath32 is the action taken at the static classical solution and @xmath33 is the operator which determines the harmonic fluctuations around the classical minimum . for chiral lagrangians",
    "the classical static configuration is the hedgehog soliton while the fluctuations asymptotically correspond to the pseudoscalar mesons .",
    "the scale in the meson - soliton interaction is set by gradients of the soliton profile which as we discussed above are of the order of of the @xmath18-mass @xmath19 .",
    "generally , therefore , it is not sufficient to evaluate the fluctuations in born approximation .",
    "this is consistent with the fact that evaluation of @xmath34-scattering phase shifts involves the pion - soliton interaction @xmath23 to all orders , irrespective of the maximal power @xmath11 of chiral derivatives which occur in the effective lagrangian .",
    "similarly , it is not possible to obtain the zero modes in born approximation ; however , they provide the most important part of the quantum corrections to the baryon mass .    after performing the time integral in @xmath30 the baryon mass then is given as m = m_s+e_cas with @xmath35 classical soliton mass @xmath36 and @xmath37 casimir energy e_cas=(trh_s - trh _ ) the hamiltonian @xmath38 governs the dynamics of the soliton fluctuations .",
    "asymptotically , far away from the soliton , @xmath25 turns into the kinetic energy operator @xmath39 for free pions . in the casimir energy",
    "the infinite @xmath37 vacuum energy contribution is subtracted .",
    "the casimir energy is a formal object which requires renormalization . in order to determine the relevant counter terms ( and _ only _ for that purpose ) we separate @xmath25 into kinetic part @xmath40 and chiral covariant momentum - independent interaction part @xmath23 h_s^2=h_0 ^ 2+v and consider the formal taylor expansion of the square root of @xmath25 in ( 7 ) in powers of the interaction @xmath23 trh_s = tr h_0 _ k=0^_k ( ) ^k , ( _ 0=1,_1=1/2,_2=-1/8 , ... )    the ultraviolet divergencies reside ( for 3 + 1 dimensions ) in the first three terms @xmath41 , while terms with @xmath42 are finite .",
    "the series may be visualized diagrammatically as a sum of one - pion - loops with @xmath43 insertions of the pion - soliton vertex @xmath23 :    ( 150,25 ) ( 50,15 ) ( 45,0)(10,3)k=0 ( 61,13)(3,3)+ ( 75,15 ) ( 70,0)(10,3)k=1 ( 86,13)(3,3)+ ( 100,15 ) ( 95,0)(10,3)k=2 ( 111,13)(3,3)+ ( 125,15 ) ( 120,0)(10,3)k=3 ( 136,13)(3,3)+ ( 141,13)(10,3 ) . . .",

    "formally , the renormalization procedure consists of the following : subtract from @xmath44 counterterms which remove the infinities in the series ( 9 ) and add them again : e_cas= tr(h_s - h_0-v + v^2 ) + ( _ 0 a_0+_1 a_1+_2 a_2 ) with the divergent integrals _",

    "subtraction scheme the infinite parts of the integrals @xmath47 are absorbed into scale - dependent renormalized coupling constants @xmath48 in the ( sufficiently general ) effective lagrangian ( this is always possible because the spatial integrals @xmath49 are chirally covariant ) .",
    "remaining scale - dependent finite parts of the @xmath47 integrals , together with the scale - independent finite part of @xmath44 in ( 10 ) then constitute the scale - dependent finite one - loop correction @xmath50 to the classical soliton mass @xmath51 ( which is implicitly scale dependent via the renormalized coupling constants @xmath48 ) .",
    "exact evaluation of @xmath52 requires knowledge of the exact scattering eigenstates for @xmath25 .",
    "they have been calculated previously  @xcite for skyrme- and similar models , so there is no principal difficulty in obtaining precise numerical results .",
    "at present results for one - loop corrections have only been obtained in the framework of chiral su(2)@xmath53su(2 ) , i.e. for purely pionic dynamics . in this case",
    "the chiral - order - four part of @xmath12 consists ( apart from small terms proportional to the pion mass ) of only two terms , the antisymmetric skyrme term _ a^(4)=tr[l_,l_]^2 d^3x and the symmetric term _ s^(4)=(tr l_l_)^2 d^3x in addition to the usual ( chiral - order - two ) part ^(2)=(-trl_l^+m_^2 tr(u+u^-2 ) ) d^3x .    in chpt , with the conventional choice for the renormalization scale @xmath54 , the magnitude of the skyrme parameter",
    "@xmath55 has been determined to lie in the range 5.8 @xmath56 7.2 , while @xmath57 is compatible with zero .",
    "as we have remarked already , this order - four lagrangian stabilizes static soliton solutions .",
    "however , for a reasonable size of the resulting baryon , values of the skyrme parameter around @xmath58 are necessary .",
    "this is a clear indication that for a reliable description of baryons in the soliton sector more terms in the chiral expansion of @xmath12 are required .",
    "there are , however , so many possible types of terms all with unknown coupling constants , that presently one reasonable strategy seems to be restriction to @xmath59 with a choice for @xmath55 which differs from its value determined in chpt , but effectively represents the influence of the higher - chiral - order terms on the soliton solutions . a posteriori",
    ", this compromise may be justifiable if it turns out that the one - loop corrections lead to significant improvement for many baryonic observables and , as we have discussed earlier , that the results show only a mild dependence on the renormalization scale @xmath45 .",
    "fig.2 shows results obtained for the baryon mass with @xmath55=4.25 and @xmath57=0 at @xmath54 . through the scale dependence of the renormalized coupling constants",
    "the classical soliton mass @xmath51 varies between 1400 and 1800 mev in the scale range of 450 mev @xmath60 1200 mev .",
    "remarkably , the one - loop correction compensates this dependence to such a degree that in the scale range from the @xmath61-mass @xmath62 up to 1 gev the resulting baryon mass is constant near 946 mev with very good accuracy .",
    "below @xmath63 500 mev the value of @xmath64 approaches the limit where the symmetric term ( 13 ) destabilizes the classical soliton solution .",
    "similarly , numerical results can be obtained for other observables by recalculating tree and one - loop contributions to the mass in presence of suitably chosen external fields .",
    "evaluating derivatives of the baryon mass with respect to the strengths of the imposed external fields provides magnitude and scale dependence for any desired observable in leading and next - to - leading @xmath0-order . the same parameter choice as in fig.2 ( i.e. @xmath55=4.25 , @xmath57=0 for @xmath45=@xmath19 ) leads to the following results : ( the first number for a given observable is the classical @xmath35 result ; the second number is the @xmath37 one - loop correction ; standard experimental values are given in brackets )    baryon mass : @xmath65 [ mev ]    @xmath66-n sigma term : @xmath67 [ mev ]    isovector magn .",
    "moment : @xmath68    isovector magn .",
    "square radius : @xmath69 [ fm@xmath3 ]    proton polarizability : @xmath71 [ @xmath72 @xmath73 .",
    "these numbers , quoted from meier and walliser  @xcite , allow to conclude that , first of all , the quantum corrections to the classical results are not small .",
    "in fact , although we expect them as @xmath0 corrections , their magnitude in general exceeds the 30@xmath74 estimate ( depending on the chosen scale ) . still , cum grano salis , they seem to confirm the applicability of the @xmath0-expansion , and the fact that they do improve the general agreement with experimental baryonic properties , supports our choice of an effective chiral - order - four lagrangian .    the corresponding consideration for the axial coupling constant @xmath75 shows , however , that for certain observables the @xmath0-expansion can be more problematic than the numbers given above may suggest . for the same parameter choice the classical @xmath35 result for @xmath75 at @xmath54 is @xmath75=0.90 .",
    "at first sight , this appears quite in line with our expectation of a 30@xmath74 @xmath37 correction to get close to the experimental value of 1.25 .",
    "however , the constraint imposed on @xmath75 by the adler - weisberger relation g_a^2=1 + , > 0 , requires that @xmath76 must contain @xmath77 contributions with a numerical magnitude of about 1 , while @xmath76 which is of @xmath78 has a numerical value of about 1.5 .",
    "this shows that in order to reproduce the experimentally observed number for @xmath75 in a @xmath0 expansion it must be calculated at least to @xmath79 which is _ two _ orders down from the leading @xmath35 , and the resulting corrections to @xmath76 ( or to @xmath80 ) will be of the same order of magnitude as the leading term .",
    "so , if the tree approximation would happen to be close to the experimental result , one could even expect the one - loop corrections to take it away from this fortunate value to make room for the necessarily large two - loop contributions . and",
    "this is what happens with the above choice of parameters :    axial coupling constant : @xmath81    the origin of this difficulty is located in the current algebra , which requires the commutator of two axial currents ( which both are of @xmath35 ) to be equal to a vector current ( which is of @xmath37 ) , and it is the nucleon matrix element of this vector current which is responsible for the 1 on the right - hand side of the adler - weisberger relation  @xcite .",
    "so , perhaps we should not be too disappointed that the long - standing trouble with @xmath75 in soliton models still can not be resolved at the present level .",
    "a decisive advantage of the soliton concept as compared to all other models where pointlike fermion fields are coupled to mesons or gauge fields is the fact that already in leading classical approximation the spatial structure of the baryon as an extended object is obtained from the underlying effective action .",
    "therefore all types of form factors can readily be extracted from the model itself and precise measurements of their @xmath2-dependence present a severe test for the resulting spatial profiles . specifically , for electro - magnetic form factors ( e.m.ff ) new slac data  @xcite pose a challenge for the relativistically corrected ffs of chiral soliton models . and",
    "in the few ( gev / c)@xmath3 region we expect a wealth of precise data from the new generation of electron accelerators . in this region of momentum transfer",
    "it is important to compare data with relativistically corrected ffs .",
    "the implementation of relativistic corrections is fairly easy for solitonic nucleons due to the lorentz covariance of the underlying field equations .",
    "the corrections reflect the lorentz boost from the soliton rest frame to the breit frame , in which the soliton moves with velocity @xmath82 which satisfies ^2=(1-v^2)^-1 = 1 + for momentum transfer @xmath2 ( @xmath83 in the spacelike region ) and soliton mass @xmath84 . the classical result for",
    "the magnetic ff is  @xcite g_m ( q^2 ) = ^-2 g^nr_m ( ^-2q^2 ) , where @xmath85 is the nonrelativistic ff evaluated in the soliton restframe .",
    "the electric ff @xmath86 does not contain the factor @xmath87 on the right - hand side  @xcite : g_e ( q^2 ) = g^nr_e ( ^-2 q^2 ) ( this is in contrast to bag models  @xcite where the wave functions of the spectator quarks supply the factor @xmath87 also for @xmath86 . )    according to the derivation of ( 17,18 ) within tree approximation of the soliton model the kinematical mass @xmath84 in ( 16 ) is the classical soliton mass @xmath36 , although ideally , of course , @xmath84 should coincide with the physical nucleon mass @xmath88 . from ( 17,18 ) the asymptotic limit of @xmath89 for @xmath90",
    "is determined by @xmath91 . for commonly used chiral lagrangians",
    "the first zeros of the nonrelativistic ffs occur at masses @xmath92 g^nr(4",
    "m^2_0 ) = 0 which are rather close to the nucleon mass , with @xmath93 for @xmath94 and @xmath95 for @xmath96 .",
    "this implies that the asymptotic behaviour of @xmath97 is very sensitive to the precise value of @xmath84 used in ( 16 - 18 ) : _ q^2 q^4g(q^2 ) = m    c < + >    m_0 .",
    "the actual values of @xmath92 for which @xmath98 vanishes , depend on the choice of the parameters in the effective lagrangian ; furthermore both , @xmath36 and @xmath85 are subject to quantum corrections .",
    "it is therefore unrealistic to expect reliable predictions from the model itself for the high-@xmath2 behaviour of @xmath97 .",
    "however , this ambiguity in the high-@xmath2 behaviour of @xmath97 can be used to _ impose _ superconvergence @xmath99 on @xmath100 by choosing @xmath101 in ( 16,17 ) , or , to put it more generally , to check the functional form of ( 17 ) against the experimentally observed behaviour of @xmath97 for large @xmath2 by choosing @xmath84 as an adjustable parameter .",
    "inclusion of other terms in the lagrangian @xmath102 , quantum corrections , additional degrees of freedom , may affect the position of zeros in different ffs in different ways . in tree approximation , for a specific choice of @xmath12 , we therefore should not expect @xmath84 to be necessarily the same for different formfactors . due to the lack of the factor @xmath87 on the right hand side in ( 18 ) , superconvergence can not be imposed on @xmath86 by any choice of @xmath84 .",
    "the low-@xmath2 behaviour is not strongly affected by these variations in @xmath84 , although due to the factor @xmath87 in front of @xmath96 in ( 17 ) , even the magnetic radius receives a small contribution from finite values of @xmath84 .",
    "we have discussed in the preceding sections that the part of the effective pionic action presently established in the mesonic sector is not sufficient for a realistic description of baryons in the soliton sector . a specific set of higher - order terms is conveniently generated through explicit inclusion of vector mesons .",
    "the relevant coupling constants need not necessarily be in close agreement with their values in the mesonic sector as long as we consider observables only in tree approximation",
    ". therefore it may be advisable to keep also an additional small fourth - order term of the skyrme type ( 12 ) in order to supply this important coupling with sufficient strength . as a most simple effective lagrangian we therefore choose the minimal model which comprises @xmath18 and @xmath103 mesons together with the pionic field @xmath104 in chiral covariant way : = l^(2)+l^(4)_a+ l^()+l^ ( ) ^()= ( - tr _",

    "their influence on the resulting profiles is rather similar : a small value of @xmath112 can be compensated by a stronger skyrme term and vice versa . for all the following results we choose @xmath113 and @xmath114 .",
    "the nucleon isoscalar ffs are of very simple form which involves only the spatial distribution of the baryon density @xmath119 and the ratio @xmath120 which determines the contribution of the @xmath103-mesons to the isoscalar part of the e.m .",

    "is calculated with @xmath142 gev which is very close to the requirement of superconvergence ( @xmath101 ) .",
    "remarkably , with this small change in the kinematic mass it is possible to obtain the impressive agreement with the slac data up to 30 ( gev / c)@xmath3 .    for the chosen set of @xmath112 and @xmath55 the proton magnetic moment is @xmath143 , and the neutron magnetic moment is @xmath144 .",
    "the discrepancy of the latter with its experimental value of -1.91 is due to the fact that in soliton models the isoscalar magnetic moment _ s / m_n = is closely tied to the inverse soliton moment of inertia @xmath145 , a relation which is _ two _ @xmath146 orders down from the @xmath35 isovector magnetic moment .",
    "so , similar to the case of @xmath75 discussed earlier , we expect decisive improvement only at the two - loop level .",

    "although details will depend on the choice of parameters in the effective lagrangian it is evident from fig.6 that the functional form ( 17 ) is able to describe the general pattern of the observed proton magnetic ff over the whole range of measured @xmath2 values if superconvergence is imposed , without any further `` qcd '' corrections  @xcite .",
    "this makes it unlikely to find unambiguous signatures from additional short - range degrees of freedom in the observed form of @xmath1 .",
    "a similar result was obtained by hhler  @xcite in terms of a suitable parametrization of the spectral function .",
    "the electric ff is dominated by a zero in the few ( gev / c)@xmath3 region which is difficult to avoid and which appears to be in conflict with the slac data .",
    "it is an interesting question whether quantum corrections or inclusion of additional degrees of freedom may shift the first zero in the nonrelativistic electric ff closer to the value @xmath151 .",
    "the scaling relation @xmath152 , however , is satisfied with good accuracy up to @xmath153 ( gev / c)@xmath3 which is quite remarkable for a model where the besselfunctions @xmath154 and @xmath155 determine the electric and magnetic ffs , respectively , ( which naively implies for the ratio of the radii @xmath156 ) .",
    "clearly , more experimental information on the proton electric ff in the few ( gev / c)@xmath3 region will be very helpful for a critical assessment of these generic implications of the soliton model .",
    "let me finally make some remarks concerning the strong form factor which governs the @xmath157 interaction in soliton models .",
    "first it should be stressed , that the analysis of the meson - baryon scattering s - matrix in the soliton sectors of effective meson lagrangians does not _ require _ to separately consider meson - baryon form factors : the spatial structure of the interaction is determined by the selfconsistently calculated soliton profiles and automatically taken care of in the scattering equations .",
    "this holds , of course , also for the analysis of the baryon - baryon interaction , or for the structure of the deuteron or other nuclei .",
    "it may , however , be desirable to extract meson - baryon form factors from soliton solutions of mesonic actions , to enable a comparison with the ( freely invented ) form factors typically used in conventional meson - exchange models of the baryon - baryon interaction .",
    "a principal difficulty lies in the fact that effective theories allow for arbitrary unitary redefinitions of the interpolating fields which leave the s - matrix unaffected .",
    "it is therefore essential to extract the form factors in such a way that they are independent of the specific definition chosen for the interpolating field .",
    "this is indeed possible if one takes due care of the local metric associated with a given choice of interpolating field .",
    "these metrical factors have been disregarded in early attempts to relate the strong form factors to the soliton profiles : the procedure followed in refs .",
    "@xcite is based on the equation of motion ( eom ) for a pion field @xmath158 coupled to a ( fermionic ) axial source ( - m_^2)^a(x ) = j^a_5(x ) . taking matrix elements for nucleon states and using translational",
    "invariance leads to -(q^2+m_^2 ) <",
    "n(p)|^a(0)|n(p ) > = <",
    "n(p)|j^a_5(0)|n(p ) > with @xmath159 .",
    "the matrix element on the right - hand side defines the form factor @xmath160 through = g_n n(q^2 ) |u(p ) i _ 5 ^a u(p ) while the matrixelement on the left - hand side to lowest order in @xmath161 is the fourier transform of the classical meson field < n(p)|^a(0)|n(p ) > = e^iqx ^a_cl(x ) dx .    through ( 36),(37 ) , and ( 38 ) the @xmath157 form factor thus is expressed in terms of the classical solution for the chiral field .",
    "it implies that in an eom for the fluctuating pion field derived from any chiral effective action ( conveniently formulated in terms of a unitary matrix field @xmath162 ) ( - m_^2)^a(x ) = j^a_5 [ u(x ) ] the matrixelements of the functional @xmath163 $ ] in baryonic configurations may be identified with the corresponding fermionic matrix elements of @xmath164 .",
    "it should be noted , however , that the eom derived from some effective meson action is not immediately obtained in the form ( 39 ) , because the kinetic part will generally contain a local metric . only after a field redefinition to absorb this metric into the chiral field the correspondingly transformed source function can be compared with the fermionic matrix elements and the form factor .",
    "evidently , this metric can only be identified from the time - derivative part of the action , because any deviation of the spatial part from the required structure @xmath165 could be absorbed into the source function @xmath166 $ ] without a redefinition of the field .    in terms of the maurer - cartan forms @xmath167 ( 2 )",
    "the kinetic part @xmath168 of the lagrangian which determines the dynamics of the field fluctuations generally is given by = - l^0_a m_ab",
    "l^0_b d^3x this also holds for effective theories which contain more than two time derivatives in their chiral action , because @xmath168 is obtained by expanding the lagrangian to second order in the fluctuations . in the skyrme model and related",
    "models the classical field configuration @xmath169 which characterizes the baryon is the hedgehog @xmath170 with chiral profile @xmath171 , rotating in isospace . for solitons of this type the only isovector which can appear in the metric tensor",
    "@xmath172 is the pion field itself , ( @xmath173 ) , therefore @xmath172 has to be of the form m_ab = m_l _ a _ b + m_t ( _ ab- _ a _ b ) with longitudinal and transverse metrical factors @xmath174 and @xmath175 depending on @xmath176 and @xmath177 .",
    "the metric in ( 40 ) can be removed from the kinetic energy by redefining ^0_a = m^1/2_ab l^0_b . for the hedgehog soliton @xmath178 rotating in isospace with angular velocity @xmath179 the time derivative @xmath180 is purely transverse and we have -^0_a ^0_a = _ a _ a with redefined field @xmath181 .",
    "combining now eqs.(36 - 38 ) with @xmath169 replaced by @xmath182 the @xmath157 form factor in the breit frame then is obtained as g_n n= ( q^2 + m_^2 ) _ 0^dr r^2 j_1(qr ) f(r ) where @xmath183 derives from the effective lagrangian used to determine the chiral profile @xmath171 . as a typical example , we consider the standard skyrme lagrangian .",
    "it leads to the transverse metric to be used in ( 44 ) m_t(r)= 1+(f^2 + ) this is the form factor which implicitly underlies the successful application of the soliton model to @xmath34 elastic scattering  @xcite . in fig.7",
    "we compare it with conventional monopole form factors @xmath184 with @xmath185 = 0.8 and 1.7 gev .",
    "the contribution of the skyrme term ( with @xmath186 ) to the pionic metric causes a qualitative change in the low-@xmath2 behaviour of the formfactor : the slope near @xmath187 is very small and the curvature is negative .",
    "this means that for small @xmath2 the effective @xmath5 coupling strength stays much closer to its value at @xmath188 than for comparable monopole form factors .",
    "it is this feature of the skyrme model form factor which also improves agreement of the calculated p33 phase shifts in @xmath34 scattering with the data in the @xmath189-resonance region  @xcite .",
    "if the metric factor in ( 44 ) is omitted ( i.e. ( 45 ) replaced by @xmath190 ) then the resulting ff is very close to a soft monopole ff with @xmath191 gev , as originally observed in  @xcite .",
    "soft ( @xmath191 gev ) monopole ffs fail in the nn system , since they cut out too much of the tensor force provided by the pion : the deuteron quadrupole moment and asymptotic d / s state ratio and the @xmath192 mixing parameter of nn scattering ( which all depend crucially on the nuclear tensor force ) come out too small  @xcite .",
    "the very hard behaviour of the skyrme model ff for small @xmath2 therefore proves very helpful in standard obe calculations . on the other hand the very soft behaviour for @xmath193 50 @xmath194 cuts off higher momenta much more efficiently than typical hard monopole formfactors .",
    "table 1 shows some results obtained by machleidt  @xcite for deuteron properties and low - energy n - p scattering with the standard monopole ff with @xmath195 gev typically used for the @xmath5-vertex in the bonn potential , and with the skyrme model ff of eqs .",
