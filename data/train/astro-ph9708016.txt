    "for some years it has been argued that @xmath0 is known to be @xmath43 ( walker et al .",

    ", it appears that the joint fit of the theory to the four nuclide abundances is no longer good for any choice of @xmath0 ( hata et al .",
    "these authors offer several options for resolving the apparent conflict between theory and observation .",
    "although they suggest that some change in standard physics may be required ( e.g. , a reduction in the effective value of @xmath47 during bbn below its standard value 3 ) , they note that large systematic errors may compromise the abundance data ( cf .",
    "copi , schramm , & turner 1995b ) .",
    "the nature of such errors is unclear , and this remains controversial .",
    "other authors have reacted to the impending crisis in self - consistency by simply omitting one or more of the four nuclides in making the fit ( dar 1995 ; olive & thomas 1997 ; hata et al .",
    "1996 , 1997 ; fields et al .",
    "1996 ) .",
    "this controversy has been sharpened by new observations giving the deuterium abundances on various lines of sight to high - redshift qsos .",
    "these data should yield the primordial d abundance , but current results span an order of magnitude .",
    "the low values , d / h by number @xmath48 ( tytler , fan , & burles 1996 ; burles & tytler 1996 ) , corresponding to @xmath49 in the standard model , have been revised slightly upward [ d / h @xmath50 ( burles & tytler 1997a , b , c ) ; @xmath29 ] , but it still seems impossible to reconcile the inferred abundance of @xmath23he [ y@xmath52 ; olive & steigman 1995 ( os ) ] with standard bbn for this large value of @xmath0 ( which implies y@xmath53 ) unless there are large systematic errors in the @xmath23he data ( cf .",
    "izotov , thuan , & lipovetsky 1994 , 1997 ) .",
    "such low d / h values have also been challenged on observational grounds by wampler ( 1996 ) and by songaila , wampler , and cowie ( 1997 ) , and deuterium abundances nearly an order of magnitude higher , d / h @xmath54 , have been claimed by carswell et al .",

    "although some of these claims of high deuterium have been called into question ( tytler , burles , & kirkman 1997 ) , hogan ( 1997 ) and songaila ( 1997 ) argue that the spectra of other absorbing systems require high d / h ( e.g. , webb et al .",
    "if these higher abundances are correct , then d and @xmath23he are consistent with @xmath30 , but modellers of galactic chemical evolution have a major puzzle : how has the galaxy reduced d from its high primordial value to its present ( local ) low value without producing too much @xmath40he ( steigman & tosi 1995 ) , without using up too much interstellar gas ( edmunds 1994 , prantzos 1996 ) , and without overproducing heavy elements ( cf .",
    "tosi 1996 and references therein ) ?",
    "it appears that @xmath0 , though known to order of magnitude , may be among the less well - known cosmological parameters at present . despite this , large modern simulations which explore other cosmological parameters are often limited to a single value of @xmath55 ( e.g. , borgani et al . 1997 ) .",
    "in this situation it may be instructive , as a thought experiment , to abandon nucleosynthetic constraints on @xmath0 entirely and ask : if we put @xmath0 onto the same footing as the other cosmological free parameters , and apply joint constraints on all these parameters based on other astronomical observations and on theory and simulation , what values of @xmath0 and the other parameters are favored ?",
    "this may indicate the most promising avenue to a resolution of the controversy over @xmath0 .",
    "we discuss the following popular cdm models : ( 1 ) open or closed cold dark - matter model with cosmological constant @xmath56 ( cdm model ) .",
    "the `` standard '' ( flat ) cdm model ( scdm ) , which is an einstein - de sitter model , is covered as a special case of this .",

    "matter , with @xmath56 ( hcdm model ) , the constraints will be different ; we defer these hcdm models to a later paper .",
    "nonflat models with nonzero @xmath11 are not necessarily ruled out by  fine - tuning \" arguments and may be of interest ( steigman & felten 1995 ) , but at the moment we are not compelled to resort to these .    our approach will be to let three parameters range freely , fit the constraints ( observables ) other than nucleosynthetic constraints , test goodness of fit by @xmath57 , and draw formal confidence regions for the parameters by the usual @xmath13 method . because statistical results of this kind are sometimes controversial , we intend to keep the work conceptually simple , review the constraints in a helpful way , and discuss our method carefully .",
    "error bars are @xmath58 unless stated otherwise .",
    "the @xmath13 approach is revealing because , in the linear approximation , the confidence regions obtained are rigorous as probability statements and require no  a priori \" probability assumptions about the unknown parameters .",
    "most of our results are not surprising , and related work has been done before ( ostriker & steinhardt 1995 , white et al .",
    "1996 , lineweaver et al .",
    "1997 , white & silk 1996 , bludman 1997 ) , but not with these three free variables and the full @xmath57 formalism .",
    "it is well known that recent cosmological observations and simulations , particularly related to the `` shape parameter '' @xmath59 and the cluster baryon fraction ( cbf ) , pose a challenge to popular models , and that there is some doubt whether any simple model presently fits all data well .",
    "our work , which begins by discarding nucleosynthetic constraints , provides a new way of looking at these problems .",
    "the cbf and @xmath59 constraints have not been applied jointly in earlier work .",
    "we find that , given our conservative ( generous ) choice of error bar on @xmath33 , the scdm model is disfavored somewhat but by no means excluded , if we are willing to accept @xmath60 .",
    "but even with the generous error on h , and allowing @xmath26 to range freely , large values ( @xmath61 ) of @xmath0 are favored over small values ( @xmath62 ) .",
    "this suggests that the low d abundances measured by burles and tytler may be correct , and that the observed ( extrapolated ) primordial helium-4 mass fraction [ @xmath63 ; cf .",
    "os and olive , skillman , & steigman 1997 ( oss ) ] , thought to be well determined , may be systematically too low for unknown reasons .",
    "we will take the cdm models to be defined by three free parameters : hubble parameter @xmath33 ; mass - density parameter @xmath64 ; and baryon - to - photon ratio @xmath0 , related to @xmath46 by equation  ( [ eq : omega_b ] ) . here",

    "we will consider five observables ( constraints ) which have measured values and errors which we assume to be normal ( gaussian ) .",

    "however , the real challenge comes from @xmath23he where the bbn prediction for @xmath276 , y@xmath279 ( 2@xmath44 ) , is to be contrasted with the region data which suggest y@xmath280 ( os , oss ) .",

    "while preparing the final version of our manuscript , we saw the paper by lineweaver and barbosa ( 1998 ) , which has some overlap with our work .",
    "their analysis in  4 has some similarities to our calculations , but there are some important differences .",
    "for example , they have only two free parameters since @xmath0 is incorporated by a questionable procedure relying on bbn and is not free , and they use a different theoretical expression and different error bars for the shape parameter @xmath59 .",
    "their   1 - 3 are of more interest , since they apply entirely different constraints from the cmb angular power spectrum .",
    "it is gratifying that their resulting crs , based on independent data , are rather similar to ours ( e.g. , compare their figure  [ fig : eta - p_l0 ] with our figure  [ fig : h - omega_m_l0_g+-0.05 ] ) .",
