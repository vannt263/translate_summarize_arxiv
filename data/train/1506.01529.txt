    "there is solid evidence that most matter in the universe is in the form of non - baryonic dark matter ( dm )  @xcite . from the theoretical point of view",
    "there are several particle physics theories which attempt to explain the yet unknown fundamental nature of dm . in the literature a plethora of dm candidates have been proposed ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) . depending on their masses and interaction",
    "cross sections with themselves or ordinary matter , they all exhibit a present day abundance in agreement with the dm density determined by planck satellite , @xmath10  @xcite . among all particle physics candidates",
    "the most popular ones belong to the class of weakly interacting massive particles ( wimps )  @xcite , since they are assumed to be stable and to have interactions with the standard model ( sm ) particles , giving a correct relic abundance as observed today .",
    "although the sm describes the elementary particles and their interactions with great success , there are other good reasons , besides the need of a dm candidate , for expecting physics beyond the sm .",
    "one motivation is the so - called _",
    "hierarchy problem_. the mass of the higgs boson acquires large quantum quadratic corrections proportional to the scale where the sm is valid . assuming the sm is valid up to very high energy scales , the parameters in the theory have to be fine - tuned in order to keep the higgs mass at an acceptable value of around 126 gev .",
    "since in the sm a symmetry that relates the various couplings does not exist , this situation is considered to be very unnatural ( e.g. , refs .",
    "one of the best motivated scenarios introduced to solve this problem is supersymmetry ( susy ) , with sparticle masses at the tev scale .",
    "although the first run of the large hadron collider ( lhc ) placed important constraints to light sparticles , and a higgs with 126 gev shifts the scale of susy to larger values requiring a certain amount of tuning ( typically at @xmath11 for the mssm , see e.g.  @xcite ) , susy continues being a very attractive possibility .",
    "another interesting feature of susy , mostly related to cosmology and the search for dm , is the existence of a conserved quantum number called r - parity , which assigns at each ( super)partner of the sm particles @xmath12 while each ordinary particle is assigned @xmath13 .",
    "this quantum number implies that supersymmetric particles must be created or destroyed in pairs , and that the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) is absolutely stable , and hence dm candidates . in many supersymmetric extensions of sm , the lightest neutralino ,",
    "a linear combination of the superpartners of the neutral gauge and higgs bosons , is the favoured dm candidate .    with the wimp hypothesis",
    ", the abundance of dm originates from thermal decoupling in the early universe .",
    "when the processes of pair - annihilation and pair - creation of wimps go out of chemical equilibrium due to the hubble expansion , the resulting number density freezes out and remains constant per comoving volume until the present time .",
    "this chemical decoupling , however , does not signal the end of wimp interactions with thermal plasma",
    ". there could still be elastic scattering processes with sm particles , which keep wimps in kinetic equilibrium until later time .",
    "when the rate for elastic scattering processes also falls below the hubble expansion rate , wimps enter the epoch called _ kinetic decoupling_. from this point on ,",
    "wimps are decoupled from the thermal bath , and begin to free - stream . after this stage , first gravitationally bound dm structures begin to form , with the size set by the temperature of kinetic decoupling , related to a small - scale cutoff in the primordial power spectrum of density perturbations .",
    "reference  @xcite calculated the the primordial power spectrum by including collisional damping and free - streaming of wimps , and showed that the free - streaming led to a cold dm ( cdm ) power spectrum with a cutoff around a scale corresponding to the earth mass , @xmath210@xmath14 ( see also refs .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "one of the most challenging goals today is to shed light on the nature of the small - scale cutoff in the primordial power spectrum of density perturbations , often dubbed with the name of _ protohalo_. its properties are relevant for indirect dm searches .",
    "indirect dm detection looks for signatures of dm annihilation , such as gamma - ray photons , from dense celestial environments , where the protohalo mass is a relevant quantity to determine the substructure `` boost '' factor .",
    "direct detection experiments of dm look for energy deposition in underground detectors caused by scattering interactions between target nuclei and wimps around us , giving valuable information about the scattering cross section , and through a correlation that we find in this study , they constrain the mass of the dm protohalos .    recently , cornell and profumo  @xcite studied scattering cross sections that are relevant for direct detection experiments and protohalo sizes in an mssm context for the neutralino dm .",
    "they based their mssm scan on 9 parameters defined at the electroweak scale .",
    "they found a strong correlation between the kinetic decoupling temperature and the spin - dependent ( sd ) cross section of neutralinos off nucleons . on the contrary",
    ", a weaker correlation was found in the case of the spin - independent ( si ) neutralino - nucleon cross section .    in the present paper , we do a forecast on the mass of the protohalos within a supersymmetric scenario by taking into account the latest data from all the relevant particle physics experiments as well as the relic density constraints .",
    "we perform our analyses within a bayesian framework , by adopting 10 mssm fundamental parameters defined at the gauge couplings unification scale , among which 9 of them we allow to vary after requiring the correct electroweak symmetry breaking .    in the considered mssm scenario , we find that the kinetic decoupling temperature leads to the protohalo mass most probably residing in a range of @xmath0@xmath15 .",
    "this large variation is due to the range of the kinetic decoupling temperature , @xmath16 , since in the neutralino annihilation processes , both gauge bosons and fermions play a role , and these couplings reveal to be independent from one another .",
    "the range corresponds to two most probable posterior regions : higgsino - like and wino - like neutralinos , for which the most probable neutralino masses are around 1  tev and 3  tev , respectively .    in these most probable cases ,",
    "we find that protohalo mass correlates with the both sd and si scattering cross sections .",
    "we show that all higgsino - like neutralino regions , where the probability is higher , such a scattering is dominantly spin - dependent . therefore , any experimental measurement of the sd cross section will imply direct consequences on minimal protohalo mass .",
    "we also show how future direct and indirect detection experiments can play an important role in constraining the ( most probable ) minimal protohalo mass down to @xmath210@xmath17 and the expected value of the boost of the luminosity due to the annihilation of dm in those regions .",
    "complementarity , we study how those predictions change in regions that are disfavored by the posterior probability density function ( pdf ) due to the large tuning , necessary to reproduce the experimental observables ( including @xmath18 ) .",

    "despite the expectation around a potential discovery of light susy particles at the first run of the lhc , so far no signal of new physics has been found , which could be considered in tension with the ideas of natural susy . however , the relative large mass of the higgs boson points to a heavier mass spectrum , suggesting that the lack of discovery of sparticles in the first run of the lhc is a consequence of the higgs mass value .    in the mssm ,",
    "a lightest higgs boson of around 126gev implies a range of @xmath19 between @xmath210@xmath20 gev and @xmath2 @xmath21 gev , . ] where @xmath19 represents the scale at which susy particles decouple from the sm ( for details , see @xcite ) .",
    "hence , within the mssm framework the higgs mass is in tension with naturalness of the electroweak symmetry breaking , requiring a typical tuning of @xmath22% , see , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "this tension is relaxed going beyond the mssm @xcite .",
    "moreover , since stops give the most important contribution to the higgs mass , the allowed range of @xmath19 could be written as a constraint to the stop sector , where typically stop masses should be larger than @xmath23  tev , unless its mixing parameter reaches its maximal value  @xcite , leaving basically the rest of the susy spectrum unconstrained .",
    "on the other hand , one of the beautiful aspects of susy is the apparent unification of gauge couplings in the mssm , because it gives a strong hint in favor of grand unified theories suggesting , as well , that we know how the renormalization group equations ( rge ) behave up to the gauge coupling unification scale , @xmath23 .. a popular approximation is to start the rge running from @xmath24 instead of @xmath25 . for some particular scenarios ,",
    "this approximation is not necessarily correct  @xcite .",
    "] taking susy parameters at @xmath24 leads to implicit relations between sparticle masses , in particular the average of stop masses at the scale of 1  tev for @xmath26 , @xmath27 , written as a function of the soft parameters at @xmath24 reads , @xcite :    @xmath28    where @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 are the bino , wino and gluinos soft mass terms , respectively , @xmath32 and @xmath33 are the third generation of squark soft masses , and @xmath34 is the @xmath35 soft mass .",
    "equation  ( [ eq : stopaverage ] ) shows that large stop masses imply large gluino mass ( @xmath36 ) , unless the soft mass terms of the third generation squarks are very large , which leads to a scenario like split susy  @xcite .",
    "+ regarding naturalness , the largest tuning required to get the correct electroweak symmetry breaking is applied on the @xmath37 parameter . from the minimization of the higgs potential",
    "one obtains @xmath38 where this expression is valid at a scale of 1 tev for @xmath26  @xcite . as in eq .",
    "( [ eq : stopaverage ] ) , @xmath31 is the responsible for the larger contribution .",
    "the current gluino mass bound from atlas and cms @xcite , @xmath39 tev ( assuming 100% decay to @xmath40 and a mass difference between @xmath41 and @xmath42 of at least 200gev ) , is that more stringent for naturalness . from eqs .",
    "( [ eq : stopaverage ] ) and ( [ eq : mu ] ) , we could also see that naturalness and higgs constraints affect mainly the gluino and squarks sector . on the other hand , sleptons , binos and winos",
    "are basically unconstraint .    in a more general framework , where the mssm is parameterized at ew symmetry breaking scale , the pmssm ,",
    "the higgs mass measurements constrain mainly the stop sector , leaving the rest of the spectrum effectively unconstrained . in this case , the main constraints for sparticle masses come from lhc limits and b - physics ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "+ besides the tuning associated to the ew symmetry breaking , there is also a tuning associated to the requirement of having a good dm candidate .",
    "refs  @xcite study the fine tuning required to obtain the correct dm relic density .",
    "in particular , @xcite shows that the region of 1 tev , corresponding to the lightest higgsino - like neutralino , requires very smallest tuning .",
    "typically , regions where the correct annihilation cross section is dominated by resonances or sfermion - neutralino co - annihilations require a large tuning . + to study the mssm parameter space we perform a bayesian analysis .",
    "one of the interesting aspects of this approach is that it is possible to take into account naturalness arguments  @xcite .",
    "a fine - tuning associated to the electroweak symmetry breaking is included when we takes the mass of the z boson in the same foot as rest of the experimental data .",
    "effectively , after requiring the correct electroweak symmetry breaking , the posterior pdf appears to be proportional to a term that penalizes regions with a large fine - tuning , independently of the choice of the prior probability .",
    "interestingly , this term is inversely proportional to the barbieri - giudice fine - tuning parameter @xcite .",
    "more specifically the ew fine tuning penalization appears as a jacobian factor that arise from the change of variables @xmath43 evaluated at the measured value of @xmath18 , where @xmath44 and @xmath45 are the gauge and yukawa couplings respectively , @xmath46 is the bilinear higgs coupling , and @xmath37 is the higgs mass term in the superpotential defined at the susy breaking scale .",
    "this jacobian factor is completely independent of the choice of parameters and is not based in a specific definition of fine - tuning . in the same way , a fine - tuning penalization associated to all the other experimental observables is included .",
    "motivated by the fact that this definition does not involve prejudices , ref .",
    "@xcite came up with the idea of using this covariant matrix to penalize regions with large fine - tuning in a @xmath47 analysis .    in our analysis",
    "we assume gravity mediated susy breaking and parameterize the mssm with 10 fundamental parameters defined at the unification scale of the gauge couplings as well as sm parameters .",
    "we also assume unification and universality conditions for the squark masses , slepton masses and trilinear terms .",
    "the set of 10 parameters is : @xmath48    where we added , as well , the gauge and yukawa couplings , @xmath44 and @xmath45 , respectively .",

    "let us comment about how strong the predictions of the scenario we consider are with respect to the most general mssm . in our approach",
    "we assume that susy was broken at gauge - coupling unification scale .",
    "although this assumption is reasonable in gravity - mediated susy breaking scenarios , it is not the only possibility ; for example , in gauge mediated scenarios it can happen in principle at any scale .",
    "moreover , the consequence of this assumption depends on the freedom we give to the soft parameters . imposing universality condition ( squark and slepton squared - mass matrices proportional to the @xmath57 identity matrix ) and unification condition",
    "( right sfermion masses equal to left sfermion masses and @xmath58 ) implies a specific mass hierarchy for squarks and sleptons which could be ameliorated if the susy breaking scale is smaller .",
    "hence , the regions of parameters we are missing in using this parameterization of the mssm are the ones with any possible hierarchies of sfermions masses . in our case",
    ", @xmath59 is always the lightest stop and @xmath60 the lightest slepton . on the other hand ,",
    "the universality condition is supported by the strong constraints from fcnc process .    using a more general parameterization at ew symmetry breaking scale ,",
    "the pmssm , the sparticle masses do not feel the impact of the renormalization group equations , the correlation between the parameters disappear and the choice of the prior will most likely dominates the results not allowing us to make conclusions about the most probable region .",
    "on the other hand , bayesian analysis has been performed in the pmssm from different perspectives , to be able to identify which are the parameters that are directly constrained by the experimental information , that can be checked by looking at the prior dependency in each parameter ( see , e.g. , refs .",

    "such a model is the well - motivated extension of the standard model at the electroweak scale . at first",
    ", it was introduced to solve the hierarchy problem of the standard model , but it revealed to have many other interesting characteristics . in particular , it contains a tempting particle dark matter candidate , the lightest neutralino .",
    "if such a neutralino is the lightest supersymmetric particle and the quantum number r - parity is preserved , it is stable , yielding to a thermal abundance as that indicated by the observed dark matter density .    in our analysis",
    "we do a forecast on the mass of the protohalos within a supersymmetric framework realized with 9 independent parameters .",
    "we performed any analysis in the light of the latest data coming from particle physics experiments , as well as the relic density constraints . among them ,",
    "the most important observables involved in the analysis , which give a relevant impact on our results , are the mass of the higgs and the relic density .    1 .   the kinetic - decoupling temperature and ,",
    "thus , the minimal protohalo mass result to be not well constrained for wimps , since the interactions involved in the annihilation of neutralinos , that are constrained by the relic density , are not necessarily those which participate in the scattering of neutralinos with first and second generation of fermions . in a supersymmetric framework ,",
    "the minimal protohalo mass is typically @xmath146 , assuming a bino - neutralino annihilating through sfermions with a mass of around twice the neutralino mass .",
    "this resulted in a possible option to get a well tempered neutralino .",
    "in addition , this possibility has been well motivated by constrained scenarios like cmssm , affirming that when the neutralino is mostly bino , it efficiently annihilates through sfermions in the early universe , giving the correct relic density . nevertheless , it was in tension with the experimental data within the cmssm , especially after the first run of the lhc , where a considerable part of this region was excluded .",
    "2 .   using a bayesian framework",
    ", we showed that the most probable neutralino mass regions satisfying both the higgs mass and the relic density contraints , are those with the lightest supersymmetric neutralino mass around 1 tev and 3 tev , that correspond to higgsino - like and wino - like neutralino , respectively .",
    "we mentioned that , concerning the higgsino - like neutralino , the annihilation cross section is driven by its higgsino component , while for wino - like neutralino , the annihilation cross section is mainly driven by its wino component .",
    "we also discussed that the part of the region closer to @xmath2 2.4 tev gets important contributions from the neutralino - stau co - annihilation , reducing both the effective annihilation rate of neutralinos in the early universe and the value of the neutralino mass , in order to obtain the correct relic density .",
    "we commented that in the case of wino - like or higgsino - like neutralinos the annihilation products are gauge bosons , whose interactions involve different couplings with respect to the ones of the neutralino - fermion scattering . for that reason kinetic decoupling temperature , @xmath16 , exhibits a considerable range of variation , that reflects , in turn , to a protohalo mass range of @xmath0@xmath147 .",
    "we also discussed the bino like neutralino with masses smaller than @xmath21  tev , where a quasi - degenerated sfermion or chargino , or a light sfermion are necessary to get the correct dark matter abundance .",
    "sleptons give the most important contribution for the kinetic decoupling temperature and therefore to the protohalo mass , setting the range @xmath148@xmath149 .",
    "5 .   kinetic decoupling of dark matter , involving elastic scattering of a dark matter particle with standard model particles in the early universe , reveals a relevant process for dark matter direct detection searches . in our analysis",
    ", we showed that the regions where the probability is higher the correlation between the protohalo mass and experimental signatures permits to put constraints on the protohalo mass . we depicted how improvements on the spin - independent sensitivity might reduce the most probable range of the protohalo mass between @xmath210@xmath3 and @xmath210@xmath150 , while constraints associated to the expected spin - dependent sensitivity are weaker . to give this conclusion we computed scattering cross sections at tree - level .",
    "however , specially in the wino - like neutralino case , loop corrections should be considered since the tree level coupling vanishes when approaching the pure wino case .",
    "we discussed , as well , how the interplay among both spin - dependent and spin - independent scattering procesess , strongly depends on the neutralino composition .",
    "for both higgsino - like and wino - like cases , the spin - dependent scattering between higgsino and fermions is mediated dominantly by the z boson at tree level , while for the spin - independent scattering , the interaction is mediated by the higgs boson . regarding the higgsino neutralino , we commented that the spin - independent interaction gives a nonzero tree - level contribution as long as gauginos are not decoupled , a non - negligible bino or wino component is necessary to have a non - negligible coupling with the higgs . on the other hand , for the wino - like neutralino",
    "the requirement of a non - negligible component of higgsino is indispensable to have a tree - level contribution to both scattering processes if sfermions are decoupled .",
    "depending on the nature of neutralino , the value of the annihilation cross section , @xmath151 , changes by different orders of magnitude .",
    "we presented that the annihilation cross section , @xmath6 , in the higgsino case does not deviate from the canonical cross section , @xmath152  @xmath8  s@xmath9 . on the other hand , in the wino case non - pertubative effect",
    "is important , @xmath6 increases up to two orders of magnitude . and",
    "it is much smaller in the bino - like case , where co - annihilations with sfermions played a crucial role to fix the correct abundance .",
    "another way to look for dark matter is through indirect detection methods , which consist to detect , _ indirectly _ , the lightest supersymmetric particle through annihilation processes where standard model particles , including gamma - ray photons , are produced .",
    "since the luminosity of each subhalo in the host halo due to the dark matter annihilation processes depends on the volume integral of the subhalo density squared , smaller and denser substructures provide an enhancement of the luminosity . in this work",
    ", we showed for both neutralino higgsino - like and wino - like cases how the boost of the luminosity due to dark matter annihilation increases , depending on the protohalo mass .",
    "we discussed that in the higgsino case , there is no a significant enhancement of the luminosity : the protohalo mass is lower than the standard value often used in the literature of @xmath210@xmath5 , while @xmath6 does not deviate from @xmath7 @xmath8 s@xmath9 . in the wino case ,",
