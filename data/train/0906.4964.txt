    "<S> this magnetic structure was compared to all symmetry - allowed magnetic structures , and was subsequently refined . </S>",
    "<S> the best - fitting magnetic structure model is antiferromagnetic , and involves pairs of yb nearest neighbors on which the moments point almost exactly towards each other . </S>",
    "<S> this structure has moment components within the _ ab_-plane  as well as parallel to the _ c_-axis , although the easy magnetization direction lies in the _ ab_-plane . </S>",
    "<S> our magnetization results suggest that besides the crystal - electric - field anisotropy , anisotropic exchange favoring alignment along the _ c_-axis  is responsible for the overall direction of the ordered moments . </S>",
    "<S> the magnitude of the ordered yb moments in yb@xmath0pt@xmath1  is 0.81  @xmath4/yb at 1.4  k. the analysis of the bulk properties , the size of the ordered moment , and the observation of well - defined crystal - field levels argue that the yb moments are spatially localized in zero field . </S>"
