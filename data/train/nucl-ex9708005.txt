    "is increased , however , a complete description of the eos should also include strange particle degrees of freedom .",
    "recent theoretical studies have indicated that the in - medium properties of strange particles in nuclear matter at high densities and temperatures may be constrained by accurate measurements of their yields , spectra , and flow in heavy - ion collisions @xcite .",
    "preliminary experimental evidence of a directed flow signal for lambda particles has been provided by the eos collaboration @xcite and by the fopi collaboration @xcite . in this letter we present the completed analysis of @xmath0 sideward flow in the eos data .",
    "in addition we present for the first time the eos results on the total yield , the yields as a function of centrality and rapidity , and the collective transverse expansion of @xmath0 s .",
    "a full description of the eos experimental setup can be found in ref.s  @xcite .",
    "the heart of the setup is a time projection chamber ( tpc ) which provides continuous three dimensional tracking and particle identification for particles with @xmath7 .",
    "the eos tpc has a rectangular geometry and operated in anti - parallel 1.3 t @xmath8 and 120 v / cm @xmath9 fields for this experiment . the target was situated as close to the tpc as possible , approximately 15 cm upstream of the first tpc pad row , in order to maximize acceptance .",
    "because this placed it in a high magnetic field , copper rather than nickel was used as the target material . the @xmath2ni beam supplied by the berkeley bevalac had an energy of 1.97 @xmath1gev at the center of the target . the hardware trigger consisted of beam defining counters located some distance upstream and a trigger counter located just downstream of the target . the discriminator threshold on the downstream counter",
    "was set to veto the @xmath1025@xmath11 most peripheral events .",
    "this trigger cutoff produces negligible bias in the data sample since , as demonstrated below , @xmath0 s are predominantly produced in central events .",
    "@xmath0 s are reconstructed through the charged particle decay : , which has a branching ratio of approximately 64@xmath11 . after all tpc tracks in an event are found and the overall event vertex has been determined , each pair of @xmath12 tracks is looped over and their point of closest approach is calculated .",
    "pairs whose trajectories intersect at a point other than the main vertex are fit with a v0 hypothesis from which an invariant mass and momentum are extracted .",
    "the @xmath0 candidates are then passed through a neural network filter @xcite in order to reduce the combinatoric background . the resulting invariant mass distribution is shown in fig .  [ mlam ] .",
    "cutting around the peak in the distribution ( 1112 mev/@xmath13 @xmath14 1120 mev/@xmath13 ) results in a sample of 1797 @xmath0 candidates , of which around 40 are estimated to be background .",
    "acceptance correction factors have been calculated by passing a sample of minimum bias 2 @xmath1gev ni + cu arc events through a detailed geant simulation of the eos detector system and then through the same analysis chain as actual data .",
    "the arc model @xcite has been successful at reproducing a wide range of inclusive observables at ags energies and it has been used to study directed flow in au + au collisions at bevalac energies @xcite .",
    "the parameterization of the tpc response in the eos geant simulation code is similar to the parameterization in the fst simulation program used by the star collaboration @xcite .",
    "hit merging , spatial resolution , and adc resolution parameters were empirically adjusted to match the data .",

    "azimuthally integrated @xmath0 efficiency factors are calculated on a @xmath15 grid in @xmath16 space from the formula : @xmath17 where @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the reconstructed and input number of @xmath0 s , respectively , in the given bin . in principle",
    "the efficiency factors also depend on the multiplicity or impact parameter . generating a sufficient number of geant events to calculate three dimensional efficiencies is impractical in the present case , however .",
    "therefore , the approximation has been made that the efficiency factorizes into two pieces : @xmath20 ; with the @xmath21 s being given by : @xmath22 averaged over all values of @xmath23 and @xmath4 . in central and semi - central events tracking efficiencies",
    "are independent of impact parameter for the relatively light system ( maximum tpc multiplicity of around 70 tracks ) . in peripheral collisions , however , the presence of a forward going high z fragment creates a hole in the tpc acceptance near beam rapidity .",
    "although the factorization assumption is not valid for such events , the overall systematic error introduced is expected to be small , as the hole occurs in a region where there are few @xmath0 s . at mid - rapidity , where the majority of @xmath0 s are produced ,",
    "the efficiency factors are very flat versus @xmath24 over the entire range of impact parameters .",
    "the overall acceptance for , averaged over @xmath25 , @xmath23 , and @xmath24 , is calculated to be about 16@xmath11 .",
    "approximately half of the loss is due to geometrical acceptance .",
    "determination of the precise fraction decaying outside the solid angle of the detector is facilitated by the fact that , to first order , arc reproduces the shape of the experimental distribution reasonably well .",
    "to second order , however , a small systematic uncertainty of @xmath26 might be introduced by the extrapolation of efficiency factors to regions of phase space where there are no counts .",
    "some @xmath0 s are also lost through inefficiencies in the track reconstrucion software . according to the simulations , over ninety percent of the @xmath0",
    "s which decay within the geometrical acceptance are reconstructed .",
    "event display comparisons of data with monte carlo suggest that the true tracking efficiency may be lower by a few percent .",

    "when plotted versus the number of participants , the data bend over and flatten out for the most central collisions .",
    "this behavior could be suggestive of a kind of `` shadowing '' effect in which late arriving nucleons from the projectile and target suffer softer collisions with matter already stopped in the collision zone . since the initial beam energy is only marginally above threshold to begin with",

    "in general , the dependence upon the mean radial flow velocity and temperature can not be expressed in simple analytical form as above but must be determined from monte carlo simulations . in the case of the present data",
    "no attempt has been made to extract @xmath53 s or temperatures for other velocity profiles .",
    "the fit results should therefore be viewed as providing a quantitative measure of collective transverse expansion only within the context of the velocity profile assumption underlying eq .",
    "[ rflow ] .",
    "the @xmath4 spectrum of mid - rapidity protons from the same event sample also has a shoulder .",

    "detection of a majority of the charged particles in the tpc , along with the presence of directed flow for protons and heavier fragments , allows for the correlation of @xmath0 production with the event reaction plane .",
    "the standard transverse momentum analysis of danielewicz and odyniec @xcite has been performed on the 1797 @xmath0 events .",
    "details of the analysis along with preliminary results obtained from a smaller and less clean event sample are given in ref .",
    "briefly , a reaction plane for each event is determined from protons and nuclear fragments with @xmath66 .",

    "@xcite has not changed  the @xmath0 s `` flow '' in the same direction as the protons .",

    "the slopes , @xmath70 , at mid - rapidity are given in the first column of table  1 .",

    "this effect can be clearly seen in the proton data points , which should be nearly antisymmetric about from symmetry considerations .",

    "within statistical uncertainties the cascade is in agreement with the data for both protons and @xmath0 s .",
    "a comparison of columns two and three of the table shows ( again with large statistical errors ) that the experimental acceptance and resolution do not distort the extracted flow values .",
    "also shown in table  1 are flow values extracted from the relativistic transport code , rvuu , by the authors of ref .  @xcite .",
    "unlike arc , where flow effects are produced by preservation of two - body scattering planes and an unequal weighting of attractive and repulsive orbits @xcite , rvuu incorporates a mean field potential for lambdas which increases the sidewards flow in the direction of the protons .",

    "since non - decay protons , which are dominant in the formation of the combinatoric background , have both types of flow , false @xmath0 s also show flow . in order to obtain pure @xmath0 flow",
    "it becomes necessary to either : 1 ) reduce the background to an insignificant level as was done in the present analysis ; or 2 ) perform a careful analysis of the flow of the background . choosing the first option means sacrificing some statistics but avoids the inevitable complications and uncertainties of method 2 .",
