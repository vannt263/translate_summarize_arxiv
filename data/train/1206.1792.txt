    "studies of the composition and temperature dependencies of the precipitation kinetics in alloys , in particular , in multicomponent fe - cu - based steels used in many industrial applications , attract great attention @xcite-@xcite . for such studies",
    ", it seems to be useful to have a reliable information about the similar dependencies for more simple , binary alloys treated as the reference systems .",
    "for example , discussing the precipitation kinetics in two fe - cu - based steels , nucu-140 and nucu-170 , kolli et al .",
    "@xcite compared their experimental results to those for several binaries fe-@xmath1cu with @xmath1 between 1.34 and 1.5 at.% , while the two steels considered had notably different content of copper , 1.17 and 1.82% , respectively .",
    "as many characteristics of nucleation and growth , in particular , sizes and density of precipitates , strongly vary with @xmath3 , such comparison can be not quite adequate .",
    "the precipitation characteristics can also significantly depend on temperature , while measurements of such dependencies , particularly for the nucleation stage , often meet difficulties @xcite .    to obtain the quantitative information about the precipitation kinetics , particularly in the course of nucleation and growth , one can use simulations of these processes , if both the microscopic model and the methods of simulations used can be considered as reliable . for the fe - cu alloys ,",
    "such reliable @xmath0 model has been developed by soisson and fu @xcite , and their detailed kinetic monte carlo simulations of nucleation and growth in the fe-1.34cu alloy at @xmath2=773 k revealed a good agreement with the available experimental data .",
    "therefore , the first aim of this work is to use the model and the kinetic monte carlo method ( kmcm ) developed in @xcite to study the concentration and temperature dependencies of the precipitation kinetics in binary fe - cu alloys for a number of copper concentrations @xmath1 and temperatures @xmath2 , including those used by kolli et al .",
    "@xcite for the nucu steels .",
    "comparison of results of these simulations to the available experimental data enables us to assess reliability of the soisson and fu model at different @xmath1 and @xmath2 , and also to discuss the differences in the precipitation kinetics between the fe-@xmath1cu binaries and the multicomponent fe - cu - based alloys with the same @xmath3 and @xmath2 .",
    "the second aim of this work is to discuss possible applications of the earlier - suggested stochastic statistical method ( ssm ) @xcite for simulations of precipitation kinetics in those cases when the kmcm meets difficulties .",
    "such difficulties arise , for example , in treatments of the coarsening stage or at relatively low temperatures @xmath4 c ( typical for service of many nuclear reactors ) when the kmc simulations become time - consuming @xcite . unlike the kmcm , the ssm allows parallelizing computer codes which can greatly accelerate computations , and this method seems also to be suitable for various generalizations , for example , for considerations of lattice misfit effects .",
    "however , in treatments of nucleation , some oversimplified models have been used in ref .",
    "@xcite which resulted in some fictitious breaks in simulated temporal dependencies . in this work",
    "we describe the improved version of the ssm free from these shortcomings and show that this version describes the main characteristics of nucleation , including the density and sizes of precipitates , in a good agreement with the kmcm .",
    "we also show that employing the ssm in conjunction with the kmcm enables us to extend the kmc simulations to the first stages of coarsening .    in sec .",
    "2 we briefly discuss the model , the alloy states and the methods used in our simulations . in sec .",
    "3 we describe the improved version of the ssm employed in this work",

    "for our simulations we use the @xmath5 @xmath6 model of fe - cu alloys developed by soisson and fu and described in detail in refs . @xcite . here",
    "we only note that this model uses the following values of the binding energy between two copper atoms and between a copper atom and a vacancy , @xmath7 and @xmath8 , for the @xmath9-th neighbors ( in ev ) : @xmath10 the high values of @xmath7 correspond to the strong thermodynamic driving force for precipitation , while the strong attraction of a vacancy to copper atoms results in the strong vacancy trapping by copper precipitates discussed in detail in @xcite .",
    "the alloy states ( below for short : states ) used in our simulations are listed in table 1 .",
    "the degree of supersaturation for each of these states is characterized by the reduced supersaturation parameter @xmath11 introduced in refs .",

    "values @xmath14 correspond to the nucleation and growth evolution type , and @xmath15 , to spinodal decomposition .",
    "the states @xmath16 and @xmath17 in table 1 have the same temperature @xmath2 and the copper content @xmath1 as the above - mentioned steels nucu-140 and nucu-170 studied by kolli et al .",
    "for the states @xmath18 and @xmath19 , kinetics of precipitation under thermal aging was investigated in refs .",

    "for the states @xmath21 and @xmath22 , experimental data about precipitation kinetics are unknown to us , and our simulations are made to study the temperature dependence of this kinetics .    in table 1",
    "we also present some parameters of the `` thermodynamic '' critical embryos for the states considered : the nucleation barrier @xmath23 , the total number of copper atoms within the embryo , @xmath24 , and the critical radius @xmath25 defined as the radius of the sphere having the same volume as @xmath24 copper atoms in the bcc lattice of @xmath26-iron with the lattice constant @xmath27=0.288 nm : @xmath28 the characteristics of critical embryos shown in table 1 and fig .",

    "as discussed below , the @xmath24 and @xmath25 values presented in table 1 are usually close to those estimated in kmc simulations and in experiments .",
    "methods of both kmc and ssm simulations used in this work are described in detail in refs .",

    "( 36 ) in @xcite determines the `` rescaling of time '' between the original vacancy - mediated exchange model and the effective dae model used for simulations .",
    "temporal evolution of this dae model is described by the `` reduced time ''",
    "@xmath49 having the meaning of a mean number of atomic exchanges @xmath50 for the physical time @xmath51 .",
    "the reduced time @xmath49 is related to this time @xmath51 by the following differential or integral relations : @xmath52 the form of the function @xmath53 is discussed below . as mentioned in ref .",
    "@xcite , eqs . can be derived not only for a simplified `` quasi - equilibrium '' model used in @xcite that disregards renormalizations of effective interactions in a nonequilibrium alloy ( whose importance for the diffusion kinetics was noted by nastar et al .",
    "@xcite ) but also with allowing for these renormalizations .",
    "the last term @xmath54 in eq .",
    "( [ ske ] ) is the fluctuative atomic transfer through the bond @xmath55 described by the langevin - noise - type method : each @xmath54 is treated as a random quantity with the gaussian probability distribution : @xmath56\\label{w}\\ ] ] where @xmath57 is the normalization constant .",

    "is reduced to a gaussian @xmath75 with @xmath76 .",
    "therefore , the reduced length @xmath77 characterizes the mean size of locally equilibrated subsystems .",
    "this size , generally , varies with the aging time @xmath51 or @xmath49 .",
    "in particular , after creation of a supercritical precipitate , the degree of local equilibrium in the adjacent region should increase with respect to other regions where such precipitates are not born yet . therefore , after completion of nucleation at some reduced time @xmath78 ( which can be estimated as the time for which the density of precipitates reaches its maximum ) , the alloy should rapidly approach the two - phase equilibrium , and the length @xmath76 should become large , which should lead to a sharp decrease of the fluctuative terms @xmath79 in eqs .",

    "to estimate values @xmath83 and @xmath84 within the ssm , we can use the `` maximum thermodynamic gain '' principle discussed in detail in @xcite : we suppose that the `` most realistic '' values of these parameters correspond to the minimum of the free energy of an alloy after completion of nucleation . to illustrate this variational method of estimating @xmath83 and @xmath84 , in fig .",
    "2 we present the ssm - simulated temporal dependencies of the free energy per copper atom for the state @xmath16 in table 1 at several @xmath83 and @xmath84 close to their `` optimal '' values .",

    "2@xmath27 is related just to switching - on fluctuations at @xmath90 .",
    "2@xmath27 shows that the influence of this spurious increase of @xmath20 ceases only at @xmath91 , while at too long @xmath92 , the fluctuations are effectively switched - off according to eqs .",
    "( [ delta n - fk])-([g - t_r ] ) . therefore , to estimate parameters @xmath83 and @xmath84 , we usually consider the interval @xmath93 .",

    "we present the values of @xmath83 and @xmath84 in ( [ g - t_r ] ) estimated as described above .",
    "for the state @xmath19 the simulations are time - consuming , thus such estimates have not been made in this work . to assess adequacy of our ssm simulations , in the two last columns of table 2",
    "we compare the values of the maximum density @xmath97 of supercritical precipitates obtained in the ssm simulations to those obtained in the kmc simulations . for the state @xmath18 in table 2 ,",
    "two values @xmath98 correspond to the two simulations ( shown in fig .",
    "6 ) with the different random number sets .",
    "we see that the ssm and the kmc results for @xmath97 agree within statistical errors of simulations .",
    "the precipitation kinetics is usually characterized by the density and the mean radius of supercritical precipitates , @xmath99 and @xmath100 , defined by the following relations : @xmath101 here @xmath102 is the number of clusters containing @xmath103 copper atoms , @xmath104 is the simulation volume , @xmath105 is defined similarly to eq .",

    "therefore , we take @xmath108 close to its `` thermodynamic '' value @xmath24 in table 1 putting @xmath108=15 , 15 , 12 , 11 , 8 , 5 and 28 copper atoms for the state @xmath16 , @xmath18 , @xmath17 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath20 and @xmath19 , respectively .",
    "temporal dependencies @xmath96 and @xmath109 obtained in our ssm simulations with such @xmath108 are illustrated by fig . 3 for the state @xmath16 ; for the rest states considered , these dependencies are similar .",
    "3 illustrates the sequence of four well - defined stages of precipitation accepted in the classical theory of nucleation ( see , e. g. , @xcite ) : incubation , nucleation , growth and coarsening , as well as the presence of an `` intermediate '' stage between growth and coarsening ( seen also in the simulations of soisson and martin @xcite and discussed in detail by barashev et al .",
    "@xcite ) which corresponds to the beginning of ostwald ripening when the bigger precipitates already start to grow due to dissolving the smaller ones but the latter do not disappear yet . for brevity , this intermediate stage will be called  pre - coarsening  .",
    "let us now discuss the `` rescaling of time '' function @xmath53 in eq .",
    "( [ t - t_r ] ) determined by the temporal dependence of the effective direct exchange rate @xmath110 . for simplicity , this dependence was approximated in @xcite by a simple two - parametric expression ( 77 ) which included sharp breaks at some @xmath49 .",
    "more adequate interpolations for @xmath53 can be obtained from comparison of the ssm and the kmc results for the density and the mean size of precipitates , that is , from an approximate solution of two equations : @xmath111 our estimates of functions @xmath53 for which both equations ( [ d_p - r_p ] ) are satisfied with a reasonable accuracy showed that for all alloy states considered , these functions have a similar form characterized by the presence of four intervals of @xmath49 with an approximately constant value of the derivative @xmath112 within each interval .",

    "( [ t - t_r_d_i ] ) and table 3 are compared to the appropriate kmc results in figs .",
    "note that the interpolation ( [ t - t_r_d_i ] ) includes some minor breaks at points @xmath131 which are seen in fig .",
    "these breaks can be removed by introducing some smooth matching of two lines ( [ t - t_r_d_i ] ) adjacent to each point @xmath119 , which also leads to the better agreement between the ssm and the kmc results in figs .",
    "however , to avoid introducing too many interpolation parameters , in this work we use a more simple interpolation ( [ t - t_r_d_i ] ) which seems to provide a sufficiently adequate description of precipitation .    as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , the significant changes of derivatives @xmath132 between different intervals @xmath36 seen in fig .",
    "4 can be related to the strong vacancy trapping by copper precipitates and to the changes of scale of this trapping in the course of precipitation . in particular , the relatively low values of derivatives @xmath133 for the pre - coarsening stage can be related to the strong vacancy trapping for this stage ( illustrated by fig .",
    "6a in @xcite ) which should result in a sharp increase of the effective rate @xmath134 in eq .",

    "this similarity can be used for various ssm - based extrapolations of kmc simulations , in particular , for the ssm - based simulations of precipitation in fe - cu alloys at most different concentrations @xmath1 and temperatures @xmath2 with the use for the parameters @xmath119 , @xmath120 and @xmath121 in eqs .",

    "we note that the simplified treatment of fluctuations based on eqs .",

    "5 - 12 such an intermediate pre - coarsening stage is not seen , the `` pure nucleation '' and `` pure growth '' stages are relatively short ( if exist at all ) , and the nucleation , growth and pre - coarsening stages significantly overlap each other .",
    "it is also illustrated by the size distribution functions @xmath102 in fig .",
    "17 which seem to imply that the nucleation , growth and pre - coarsening processes at @xmath146 occur simultaneously .",
    "as discussed in @xcite , these kinetic features seem to be mainly related to the strong vacancy trapping by copper precipitates , which leads to a great acceleration of both the growth and the ostwald ripening processes as compared to the alloys with no such trapping .    figs .",
    "5 - 10 also show that the simplified direct - atomic - exchange model ( [ ske])-([f_c - bcc ] ) using the above - mentioned maximum thermodynamic gain principle and the simple interpolation ( [ t - t_r_d_i ] ) describes the precipitation kinetics in a fair agreement with the kmcm .",
    "discrepancies between the ssm and the kmcm results lie usually within statistical errors of simulations , and these discrepancies can be still more reduced if the smoothed interpolations mentioned above are used instead of more simple expressions ( [ t - t_r_d_i ] ) .    figs .",

    "at the same time , the above - described considerations about the physical nature of the `` rescaling of time '' function @xmath53 in ( [ t - t_r_d_i ] ) enable us to expect that this function preserves its form for the first stages of coarsening at least up to @xmath147 , until the later , more advanced stages of coarsening ( including the asymptotic lifshits - slyozov - wagner stage @xcite ) start .",

    "13 - 16 . for the maximum precipitate density @xmath97 ,",
    "these dependencies shown in figs . 13 and 15 are mainly determined by the reduced supersaturation @xmath11 ( defined in eq .",
    "( [ s ] ) and table 1 ) which characterizes the scale of the thermodynamic driving force for precipitation . for the given temperature @xmath2 or the given concentration @xmath1 , the @xmath97 value increases with @xmath11 , and at low @xmath149 or high @xmath150 k",
    "this rise is rather sharp . at the same time ,",
    "15 shows that at not low @xmath151 and not high @xmath2 , the @xmath97 value changes with @xmath2 more slowly , and at @xmath152 k , the further lowering temperature makes little effect on the @xmath97 .",
    "it may imply that the slowing down of kinetics due to the strong vacancy - copper atom correlations discussed below becomes important for these @xmath2 .",
    "the temporal characteristics of precipitation shown in figs . 14 and 16@xmath13",
    "decrease with increasing supersaturation @xmath11 , which can be explained by an increase of the thermodynamic driving force . at the same time ,",
    "16@xmath27 shows that at not low @xmath153 and not high @xmath154 k , the scaled times @xmath155 ,  @xmath156 and @xmath157 vary with temperature rather weakly . it can be explained by an interplay between an increase with lowering @xmath2 of both the thermodynamic driving forces which promote the evolution , and the vacancy - copper atom correlations which reduce the copper diffusivity @xmath158 @xcite and thereby slow down the evolution .",
    "let us discuss the precipitate size distributions @xmath102 shown in fig .",
    "first , we see that these distributions are usually rather broad , and sizes of different precipitates are typically very different .",
    "therefore , characterization of these sizes by only their mean value @xmath100 used in figs .",
    "5 - 12 is oversimplified and incomplete .",
    "it is true not only for the coarsening stage ( for which a great difference in the precipitate sizes is natural as the bigger precipitates coarsen due to dissolving the smaller ones ) but also for all other stages of precipitation .",
    "it can be related to the strong overlapping of the nucleation , growth and pre - coarsening stages mentioned above .",
    "comparison of the size distributions @xmath102 at @xmath51=@xmath141 and @xmath51=@xmath159 ( that is , frames g2 and g3 , b2 and b3 , or d2 and d3 in fig .",
    "17 ) also illustrates the significant overlapping of growth and early coarsening stages .",
    "we see that the great majority of precipitates at @xmath51=@xmath159 still continue to grow due to the absorption of copper atoms from the matrix , even though some smallest precipitates already start to dissolve .",
    "such significant overlapping of growth and early coarsening stages agrees with the observations by mathon et al . for the fe-1.34cu alloys ( the state @xmath18 in table 1 ) @xcite , and it was also noted by kolli et al . for the nucu steels @xcite .",
    "second , the comparison of the size distributions @xmath102 at @xmath51=@xmath141 and @xmath51=@xmath159 also illustrates very sharp variations of these distributions with the evolution time @xmath51 , in particular , at @xmath51 corresponding to the beginning of coarsening , which is not clearly seen in the `` averaged '' description of figs .",
    "third , fig .",
    "17 shows that the precipitate size distribution @xmath102 for the state @xmath19 with the highest temperature @xmath2=873 k is , generally , much more uniform than @xmath102 for the states @xmath18 and @xmath21 with the lower @xmath2=773 k and 713 k , particularly for the early coarsening stage , which is illustrated by frames g4 , b4 and d4 . in particular , in frames b4 and",
    "d4 we observe only one very big cluster with @xmath103@xmath160600 copper atoms , numerous small clusters with @xmath103@xmath161200 copper atoms , and 3 - 4 `` middle - sized '' clusters with @xmath103@xmath160200 - 300 atoms ( the same features are also observed in @xmath102 for the state @xmath16 not shown in fig .",
    "17 on considerations of space ) , in the great difference with frame g4 ( as well as g2 and g3 ) where the cluster size distribution is rather uniform .",
    "this difference can be related to the weakening of the vacancy - copper atom correlations at high @xmath2 which can enhance the copper diffusivity @xmath158 and thereby promote growth of many big precipitates for the state @xmath19 unlike the states @xmath16 , @xmath18 and @xmath21 , but these points need further studies . finally , the lower row of fig .",
    "17 illustrates features of precipitation at low temperatures @xmath162 300@xmath163 c when the vacancies ( necessary for the atomic diffusion ) are provided by irradiation .",
    "f1f3 illustrate a very strong overlapping of the nucleation growth and pre - coarsening stages , while the coarsening stage was not reached in these our simulations .",
    "let us now compare the simulation results to the available experimental data .",
    "for the state @xmath18 and the kmc simulations shown in figs . 6 and 7 by thick lines ,",
    "the detailed comparison with various experiments was given by soisson and fu @xcite who concluded that the predictions of simulations are reliable .",

    "14 and 16 show that the ssm - based extrapolations of kmc simulations for the first stages of coarsening seem to agree with the observations as well .    for the state @xmath19 with @xmath164 , @xmath165 k , our simulations",
    "are compared to the data by shabadi et al .",
    "@xcite in fig . 12 .",
    "as supersaturation @xmath11 and the precipitate density @xmath95 for this state are rather low , these simulations are time - consuming and include only nucleation and growth stages , while the data by shabadi et al .",
    "seem to correspond to the longer aging times and have significant errors . within these errors , the simulation and experimental results in fig .",
    "12 can be considered as agreeing with each other , particularly for the maximum precipitate density @xmath97 , though the simulated evolution times can be somewhat shorter than the observed ones .",
    "solid squares in fig .",
    "12 correspond to a ternary fe - cu - mn alloy and illustrate the effect of the third alloying element mn on the precipitation kinetics .",
    "the presence of mn seems to lead to an increase of the maximum precipitate density @xmath97 by about twice with respect to the analogous fe - cu binary , in a qualitative contrast with the effect of alloying elements on the @xmath97 value in the nucu steels discussed below .    in figs . 5 , 8 , and 13 - 16 we compare the simulation results for the state @xmath16 or @xmath17 with @xmath166 k and @xmath167 or 1.82 to the data by kolli et al .",
    "@xcite for the multicomponent steels nucu-140 and nucu-170 with the same @xmath2 and @xmath168 .",
    "in addition to copper , these steels contain a number of alloying elements : c , al , ni , si , mn , nb , p and s , 5.49% on the total in nucu-140 , and 5.83% , in nucu-170 , while the partial concentrations of each alloying element in these two steels are very close to each other @xcite .",
    "therefore , differences in the precipitation kinetics for these two steels can be mainly related to the difference in the copper content @xmath168",
    ". then comparison of this kinetics for each of these steels to that for the analogous binary fe-@xmath1cu alloy can elucidate the effect of alloying elements on the precipitation at different @xmath168 .",
    "qualitatively , these problems were discussed by kolli et al .",
    "our simulations enable us to consider these points quantitatively .",
    "let us also note that the critical sizes @xmath108 for these two steels estimated by kolli et al .",
    "@xcite : @xmath16911 copper atoms , are rather close to the estimates for their binary analogues presented in table 1 : @xmath170 , @xmath171 copper atoms .",
    "let us first discuss the nucleation and growth stages illustrated by figs . 5 and 8 .",
    "for the nucu-140 or nucu-170 steel this corresponds to @xmath172 h and @xmath173 h , respectively , and the maximum precipitate density @xmath97 in each steel is lower than that in its binary analogue by about three times .",
    "however , for the nucu-140 , both the values and the temporal dependencies of @xmath99 and @xmath100 in fig .",
    "5 seem to not greatly differ from those simulated for the fe-1.17cu alloy , particularly for the nucleation stage , and the nucleation time @xmath141 can be similar , too . on the contrary , for the nucu-170 , the data at @xmath51=0.25 h shown in fig .",
    "8 , particularly for the @xmath100 value , sharply disagree with those simulated for the fe-1.82cu alloy , while the nucleation time @xmath141 exceeds that for the fe-1.82cu alloy by an order of magnitude .",
    "therefore , our comparison seems to imply that the effect of almost the same content of alloying elements on the nucleation kinetics in nucu-170 with the higher copper content @xmath168=1.82 is much stronger and qualitatively different from that in nucu-140 with the lower @xmath168=1.17 .",
    "physically , such conclusion does not seem to be natural . in this connection",
    "we note that this conclusion is mainly based on the data for the mean precipitate size in nucu-170 at @xmath51=0.25 h reported by kolli and seidman @xcite : this value much exceeds the critical radius @xmath174 nm estimated for this steel in @xcite : @xmath175 .",
    "it should imply that in the course of the nucleation stage ( supposed in @xcite for the nucu-170 at @xmath51=0.25 h to explain a steep rise of the precipitate density @xmath99 between @xmath51=0.25 h and @xmath51=1 h seen in fig .",
    "8) the new - born precipitates grow extremely fast .",
    "such a very sharp growth at the early nucleation stage seems to be very unusual and , to our knowledge , was never observed in either experiments or simulations , as illustrated by figs .",
    "therefore , the data about @xmath100 in nucu-170 at @xmath51=0.25 h reported in @xcite should possibly be taken with some caution .",
    "for the coarsening stage , the results presented in figs . 5 , 8 and 14 fully agree with the main conclusions of kolli et al .",
    "@xcite about a very strong slowing down of coarsening in the nucu steels with respect to binaries fe - cu .",
    "in particular , the advanced coarsening time @xmath139 for each of these steels exceeds that for its binary analogue by about two orders of magnitude . at the same time , the dependencies of this advanced coarsening time @xmath139 on the copper content @xmath168 for the nucu steels and for their binary analogues shown in fig .",
    "14 seem to be similar .",
    "the strong slowing down of coarsening in a ternary fe - cu - mn alloy with respect to its binary analogue fe - cu was also observed by miller et al . under neutron irradiation @xcite .",
    "on the contrary , the effects of alloying elements on the nucleation and growth kinetics in fe - cu - mn alloys and in nucu steels seem to differ qualitatively : according to figs .",
    "12 and 13 , the @xmath97 value for an fe - cu - mn alloy is by about twice higher , while for each of nucu steels , it is by about three times lower than that in its binary analogue .",
    "therefore , for the coarsening stage , the effects of alloying elements on the decomposition kinetics in the multicomponent fe - cu - based alloys seem to be much more universal than those for the earlier stages of precipitation .",
    "such a universal slowing down of coarsening in the multicomponent fe - cu - based alloys with respect to their binary analogues fe - cu can be related to a significant segregation of alloying elements on the surface of precipitates @xcite-@xcite which can reduce the surface energy and thereby the thermodynamic driving force for coarsening .",
    "it can also be related to a weakening of the vacancy trapping at surfaces of precipitates due to this segregation . however , quantitative estimates of these effects seem to be absent yet .",
    "let us summarize the main results of this work . the earlier - developed @xmath5 @xmath6 model and both the kinetic monte carlo ( kmc ) and",
    "the stochastic statistical methods are used to simulate the precipitation kinetics for seven binary fe - cu alloys with different copper concentrations @xmath1 and temperatures @xmath2 .",
    "comparison of results obtained to available experimental data and to other simulations enable us to make a number of conclusions about kinetic features of precipitation in both the binary fe - cu and the multicomponent fe - cu - based alloys .",
    "first , we find that due to the strong vacancy trapping by copper precipitates , the precipitation kinetics in iron - copper alloys for all @xmath1 and @xmath2 considered differs notably from that observed for the alloys with no such trapping : the `` pure nucleation '' and `` pure growth '' stages are relatively short , the nucleation , growth and coarsening stages significantly overlap , while the intermediate `` pre - coarsening '' stage observed in some simulations for simplified alloy models ( illustrated by fig . 3 of this work and by fig . 1 in ref .",
    "@xcite ) is absent . in this connection , the presence of this pre - coarsening stage in simulations of precipitation in irradiated fe - cu alloys made by barashev et al .",
    "@xcite can be related just to some oversimplifications of their model .",

    "( [ t^max ] ) and ( [ t^c,0.1 ] ) are illustrated by figs .",
    "13 - 16 . at low supersaturations @xmath11 , these dependencies are rather sharp and seem to be mainly determined by the variations of supersaturation @xmath176 with @xmath1 or @xmath2 . at higher @xmath1770.3 , these temperature dependencies become more smooth and seem to be determined by an interplay between an enhancement with lowering @xmath2 of both the thermodynamic driving forces promoting the evolution and the vacancy - copper atom correlations reducing the copper diffusivity @xmath158 and thereby slowing down the evolution .",
    "temporal evolution of the precipitate size distributions @xmath102 is illustrated by fig .",
    "these distributions are typically rather broad , and they strongly vary with the evolution time @xmath51 . therefore , the conventional description of these sizes in terms of the mean precipitate size @xmath100 is oversimplified and incomplete .",
    "we also find that for the alloy state @xmath19 with a relatively high temperature @xmath2=873 k , the size distribution @xmath102 is much more uniform than those observed for the states @xmath18 and @xmath21 with the lower temperatures @xmath2=773 k and @xmath2=713 k , particularly for the coarsening stage .",
    "we also describe an improved version of the earlier - suggested stochastic statistical method for simulations of precipitation and show that this version can be used for various extrapolations of kmc simulations , in particular , for their extensions to the first stages of coarsening for which the kmc simulations are time - consuming .",
