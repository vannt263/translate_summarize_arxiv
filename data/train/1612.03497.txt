    "the motivating example is when @xmath8 is a geometrically finite kleinian group and @xmath7 a collection of conjugacy representatives of maximal parabolic subgroups . in this case",
    "the bowditch boundary coincides with the limit set .",
    "a result of yaman @xcite characterizes relatively hyperbolic groups in terms of their action on the bowditch boundary .",
    "it is natural to wonder whether a relatively hyperbolic group whose bowditch boundary is a @xmath0-sphere is virtually kleinian .",
    "in fact , both the cannon conjecture and this relative version are special cases of a much more general conjecture of martin and skora ( * ? ? ? * conjecture 6.1 ) .",
    "one of the main results of this paper ( see corollary [ cor : relative cannon ] below ) is to prove that the relative version of the cannon conjecture follows from the absolute version .",

    "relatively hyperbolic dehn filling has found many important applications , including in the proof of the virtual haken conjecture @xcite and the solution of the isomorphism problem in a large class of relatively hyperbolic groups @xcite .    in the classical setting",
    "one begins with a relatively hyperbolic group pair @xmath4 whose bowditch boundary is a @xmath0sphere and ends with a hyperbolic group @xmath11 whose gromov boundary is again a @xmath0sphere . on the other hand , examples of cat@xmath12 fillings of high - dimensional manifolds @xcite suggest that group theoretic dehn filling often produces a group @xmath11 whose boundary is much more complicated than that of @xmath4 , but which nonetheless admits a fairly explicit description .",
    "one purpose of this paper is to begin an investigation of whether these results are special to fillings of manifolds , or are reflective of more general phenomena . to this end",
    ", we obtain a description ( theorems [ thm : trunc ] , [ thm : existsvisual ] and [ thm : linconn ] ) of the boundary of a dehn filling as a certain kind of limit of quotients of subsets of the original boundary by discrete groups . the following result is contained in theorems [ thm : trunc ] and [ thm : existsvisual ] ( see definition [ wghlimit ] for the definition of weak gromov - hausdorff convergence ) :    let @xmath13 be a sufficiently long hyperbolic filling of the relatively hyperbolic pair @xmath14 , with @xmath15 infinite .",
    "then there is a sequence of gromov hyperbolic spaces @xmath16 whose boundaries @xmath17 weakly gromov - hausdorff converge to @xmath18 , if we endow all these boundaries with suitable metrics .",
    "moreover there is an exhaustion @xmath19 of @xmath20 so that each @xmath17 can be identified with @xmath21 where @xmath22 is a union of finitely many copies of @xmath23 .",
    "this gives a new way to prove statements about boundaries of dehn fillings , by proving a statement about the approximating @xmath17 , and showing it persists in the limit .",
    "theorem [ thm : linconn ] states that under some additional assumptions , we may assume all these metrics are uniformly linearly connected , which helps control the limit .",
    "our main application is the following statement , which says roughly that sufficiently long dehn fillings of relatively hyperbolic groups with @xmath0sphere boundary must have @xmath0sphere boundary .",
    "theoremboundarysphere[thm : boundary sphere ] let @xmath9 be a group , and @xmath24 a collection of free abelian subgroups .",
    "suppose that @xmath4 is relatively hyperbolic , and that @xmath5 is a @xmath0sphere .",
    "then for all sufficiently long fillings @xmath25 with @xmath26 virtually infinite cyclic for each @xmath27 , we have that @xmath11 is hyperbolic with @xmath28 homeomorphic to @xmath1",
    ".    note that if @xmath5 is a @xmath0sphere , then any parabolic acts properly cocompactly on @xmath29 .",
    "if we are assuming it is free abelian , it must therefore be @xmath30 .",
    "if we did nt assume abelian , we might have to worry about higher genus surface groups as peripheral groups .",
    "these higher genus surface groups being hyperbolic groups , we should exclude them from the peripheral structure to get a boundary which is a sierpinski carpet .",
    "conjecturally , a hyperbolic group with sierpinski carpet boundary is virtually kleinian .",

    "then @xmath9 is kleinian .",
    "we remark that the usual cannon conjecture says ` virtually kleinian ' because a non - elementary hyperbolic group may not act faithfully on its boundary ; there may be a finite kernel .",
    "however , under the assumption that the parabolic subgroups of a nonelementary relatively hyperbolic group ( with nontrivial peripheral structure ) are free abelian , there are no nontrivial finite normal subgroups , and so ` kleinian ' is the expected conclusion .",
    "we have the following corollary of theorem [ thm : boundary sphere ] ; see section [ sec : corollary ] for the proof .",
    "[ cor : relative cannon ] the cannon conjecture implies the relative cannon conjecture .",

    "we must somehow reconstruct @xmath32 from information about @xmath5 .",

    "we develop an analog in the cusped space of the `` windmills '' technology of @xcite to obtain an exhaustion of @xmath35 by free products of _ finitely many _ parabolic subgroups .",
    "our replacements for windmills are called _ spiderwebs _  these form an exhaustion @xmath36 of the cusped space by quasiconvex subsets , each of which is acted on geometrically finitely by a finitely generated subgroup @xmath37 of @xmath35 .",
    "the `` partial quotients '' @xmath38 approximate a cusped space @xmath39 for the relatively hyperbolic pair @xmath40 .",
    "but in the situation of interest @xmath11 is itself hyperbolic , so we need approximations to @xmath18 , not to @xmath41 .",
    "such approximations are obtained from @xmath38 by removing finitely many images of ( deep ) horoballs of @xmath42 .",
    "we must take some care to ensure that these truncated partial quotients are uniformly hyperbolic over all @xmath2 . with even more care , we are able to show these boundaries are uniformly linearly connected over all @xmath2 ( theorem [ thm : linconn ] ) , and that they have nice descriptions in terms of @xmath5 ( theorem [ thm : trunc ] ) .",
    "once this is ensured , we have a sequence of spaces which converge in the pointed gromov ",
    "hausdorff topology to a @xmath11cocompact space .",
    "their boundaries therefore converge ( in a sense described in section [ sec : wgh ] ) to the boundary of @xmath11 ( theorem [ thm : existsvisual ] ) .",
    "the above results apply more generally when @xmath11 is hyperbolic , and the result of a long filling of a relatively hyperbolic pair @xmath4 , and in fact we state versions in the setting of the bowditch boundary of @xmath43 as theorems [ relversion : trunc][rel : linconn ] .",
    "the proofs of these relative versions are strictly easier than those of theorem [ thm : trunc][thm : linconn ] , though we do not provide the relative proofs in this paper .    in section [ sec :",
    "spheres ] we specialize to @xmath31 , and @xmath44 virtually cyclic . in this case",
    "we can show the approximating boundaries are spheres by a homological argument .",
    "we now sketch the argument that the boundary is planar .",
    "results from @xcite show that the boundary is a peano continuum without local cut points .",
    "we then invoke a characterization of claytor @xcite , which says that a peano continuum without cut points is planar if and only if it contains no non - planar graph .",
    "an adaptation of a lemma of ivanov ( lemma [ ivanovlemma ] ) shows that if @xmath18 contained such a graph , then so would all but finitely many of the approximating boundaries .",
    "since they are spheres , they do not .    since @xmath18 is planar , connected , and has no local cut points , a result of kapovich and kleiner ( * ?",
