    "measurements of the longitudinal polarization of @xmath0 hyperons in lepton nucleon deep inelastic scatering ( dis ) processes provide access to the polarization of intrinsic strangeness of the nucleon  @xcite and to the polarized quark spin transfer function  @xcite : @xmath3 , where @xmath4 and @xmath5 are unpolarized and polarized fragmentation functions for the quark @xmath6 to yield a @xmath7 hyperon with the fraction @xmath8 of the quark energy .",
    "several experimental measurements of @xmath0 polarization have been made in neutrino and anti - neutrino dis .",
    "longitudinal polarization of @xmath0 hyperons was first observed in bubble chamber ( anti ) neutrino experiments  @xcite .",
    "the nomad collaboration has recently published new and interesting results on @xmath0 and @xmath9 polarization with much larger statistics  @xcite .",
    "there are also recent results on longitudinal polarization of @xmath0 hyperons from polarized charged lepton nucleon dis processes from the e665  @xcite and hermes  @xcite experiments .",
    "a key assumption , adopted widely in theoretical analyses of these data , is that the struck quark fragmentation can be disentangled from the nucleon remnant fragmentation by imposing a cut : @xmath10 . as we show in sec .",
    "[ sec : frag_model ] this assumption fails at moderate beam energies  @xcite .",
    "a method of calculation of the longitudinal polarization of @xmath0 hyperons is presented in sec .",
    "[ sec : method ] , and our model predictions are compared to the available data in sec .",
    "[ sec : results ] .",
    "there are different mechanisms whereby strange hadrons can be produced in dis processes . they can be produced by fragmentation of the struck quark or the nucleon remnant diquark , or in color string fragmentation .",
    "we assume that strange hadrons can be polarized only in the ( di ) quark fragmentation . @xmath0",
    "hyperons can be produced _",
    "promptly _ or as a decay product of heavier strange baryons ( @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 ) .",
    "therefore , to predict the polarization of @xmath0 hyperons in a given kinematic domain one needs to know the relative yields of @xmath0 s produced in different channels and their polarization .",
    "we take into account all these effects explicitly tracing the @xmath0 origin predicted by the fragmentation model adopted ( sec .",
    "[ sec : frag_model ] ) and assigning the polarization predicted by the polarized intrinsic strangeness model ( sec .  [ sec : model ] ) in the diquark fragmentation and by su(6 ) and burhardt - jaffe  @xcite models for the quark fragmentation ( sec .",
    "[ sec : lam_polar ] ) .",
    "we take into account a difference in observed yields of heavier strange hyperons  @xcite . +      the main idea of the polarized intrinsic strangeness model applied to semi - inclusive dis is that the polarization of @xmath14 quarks and @xmath15 antiquarks in the hidden strangeness component of the nucleon wave function should be ( anti)correlated with that of the struck quark .",
    "this correlation is described by the spin correlation coefficients @xmath16 : @xmath17 , where @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the polarizations of the initial struck ( anti)quark and remnant @xmath14 quark . in principle , @xmath16 can be different for the valence and sea quarks .",
    "we leave @xmath20 and @xmath21 as free parameters , that are fixed in a fit to the nomad data  @xcite .",
    "+      we define the quantization axis along the three - momentum vector of the exchanged boson . to calculate the polarization of @xmath22 hyperons produced in the diquark fragmentation we assume the combination of a non - relativistic @xmath2 quark - diquark wave function and the polarized intrinsic strangeness model described above .",
    "the polarization of @xmath22 hyperons produced in the quark fragmentation via a strange baryon ( y ) is calculated as : @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the corresponding spin transfer coefficient , @xmath18 is the struck quark polarization which depends on the process .",
    "we use su(6 ) and bj models to compute @xmath24 .",
    "+      l0.5    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     to describe @xmath0 production and polarization in the full @xmath1 interval , we use the lund string fragmentation model , as incorporated into the jetset7.4 program  @xcite .",
    "we use the lepto6.5.1  @xcite monte carlo event generator to simulate charged - lepton and ( anti)neutrino dis processes .",
    "we introduce two rank counters : @xmath25 and @xmath26 which correspond to the particle rank from the diquark and quark ends of the string , correspondingly .",
    "a hadron with @xmath27 or @xmath28 would contain the diquark or the quark from one of the ends of the string .",
    "however , one should perhaps not rely too heavily on the tagging specified in the lund model . therefore",
    ", we consider the following two variant fragmentation models :    * model a : * the hyperon contains the stuck quark ( the remnant diquark ) only if @xmath28 ( @xmath29 ) .    * model b : * the hyperon contains the stuck quark ( the remnant diquark ) if @xmath30 and @xmath31 ( @xmath32 and @xmath33 ) .",
    "clearly , model b weakens the lund tagging criterion by averaging over the string , whilst retaining information on the end of the string where the hadron originated .    in the framework of jetset , it is possible to trace the particles parentage .",
    "we use this information to check the origins of the strange hyperons produced in different kinematic domains , especially at various @xmath1 . according to the lepto and jetset event generators",
    ", the @xmath1 distribution of the diquark to @xmath0 fragmentation is weighted towards large negative @xmath1 .",
    "_ however , its tail in the @xmath10 region overwhelms the quark to @xmath0 @xmath1 distribution at these beam energies . _ in fig .",
    "[ fig : xf_default ] , we show the @xmath1 distributions of @xmath0 hyperons produced in diquark and quark fragmentation , as well as the final @xmath1 distributions .",
    "these distributions are shown for @xmath34 cc dis at the nomad mean neutrino energy @xmath35  gev , and for @xmath36 dis at the compass muon beam energy @xmath37  gev .",
    "the relatively small fraction of the @xmath0 hyperons produced by quark fragmentation in the region @xmath38 is related to the relatively small centre - of - mass energies - about 3.6 gev for hermes , about 4.5 gev for nomad , about 8.7 gev for compass , and about 15 gev for the e665 experiment - which correspond to low @xmath39 .",
    "we vary the two correlation coefficients @xmath20 and @xmath21 in fitting models a and b to the following 4 nomad points :    \\1 ) @xmath40 : @xmath41 , 2 ) @xmath42 : @xmath43 , 3 ) @xmath44 gev@xmath45 : @xmath46 , 4 ) @xmath47 gev@xmath45 : @xmath48 .",
    "we find from these fits similar values for both the @xmath2 and bj models : @xmath49 , @xmath50 ( model a ) and @xmath51 , @xmath52 ( model b ) .",
    "r0.5    in figs .",
    "[ fig : numuxcc_6 ] , [ fig : e+xxxem_6 ] , [ fig : e665_mu+xxem_6 ] we show our model predictions compared to the available data from the nomad  @xcite , hermes  @xcite and e665  @xcite experiments .",
    "one can conclude that our model quite well describes all the available experimental data .",
    "the nomad collaboration has measured separately the polarization of @xmath0 hyperons produced off proton and neutron targets .",
    "we observe good agreement , within the statistical errors , between the model b description and the nomad data , whilst model a , although reproduces quite well the polarization of @xmath0 hyperons produced from an isoscalar target , fails to describe target nucleon effects .",
    "we provide many possibilities for further checks of our approach for future data ( for details , see  @xcite ) .",
