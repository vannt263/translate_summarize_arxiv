    "surface plasmon - polaritons(spps ) induced by the coupling between the free - electron plasma and electromagnetic field at the metal - dielectric interfaces are known for the wide application in nano optics .",
    "@xcite due to the spatial localization at the metal - dielectric interfaces , the spps can be guided to manipulate light in nanoscaled photonic circuitry .",
    "@xcite it has also been found other effects of spps , including field enhancement  @xcite , and influence on lifetime of emitters close to the spps .",
    "@xcite in various plasmonic structures , cylindrical metallic nanowire  @xcite as a symmetric plasmonic structure has been widely studied for the applications of the optical waveguide and the scanning near - field optical microscopy ( snom ) . in order to understand the physical properties of spps in those structures ,",
    "it is important to get the dispersion relations of the frequency and wave vector of the spps , which determine the basic properties of the spps .",
    "principally , the dispersion relations can be obtained by solving the maxwell equations with the boundary conditions of the plasmonic structures imposed . for the cylindrical nanowire ,",
    "the spps dispersion relations can be numerically calculated from the dispersion equation .",
    "@xcite the spps dispersion relations of plasmonic structures are complex when the metal ohmic losses are introduced .",
    "@xcite there exist two types of solutions to the complex dispersion relations .",
    "one solution specifies a complex frequency as a function of a real wave vector , noted as @xmath0 for convenience .",
    "the other one specifies a complex wave vector as a function of a real frequency , noted as @xmath1 . even though the two types of solutions are obtained from one same structure , they are rather different . for the sections of the dispersion relations with frequencies close to the surface plasmon frequency ,",
    "the @xmath1 solution has a back bending , which is absent in the @xmath0 solution .",
    "the latter is an asymptotic curve .",
    "@xcite    the back bending of the dispersion relation has some unique properties .",
    "for example , it has been calculated that the minimum energy velocity is exactly at the back bending point .",
    "@xcite however , the utility of the bending back behavior of the spps to control light has not been fully explored yet .",
    "furthermore , the local density of states(ldos ) of spps is a key parameter influencing the lifetime of an emitter close to the spps .",
    "@xcite according to the definition of the ldos that is proportional to @xmath2 , the ldos close to the back bending point in the @xmath1 dispersion has a small and broad peak , while the ldos in @xmath0 dispersion has a large and narrow peak due to the asymptotic curve .",
    "thus , in order to compare the physical results between the two types of solutions , it is necessary to understand the behaviors of the asymptotic curve and the back bending of the spps .",
    "it has been suggested that the @xmath1 solution describes the spps mode decaying spatially while the @xmath0 solution is for the spps decaying in time rather than in space .",
    "@xcite the discrepancy of the two solutions has been considered to be originated from the metal ohmic loss .",
    "@xcite such conclusion is originally drawn from the study of spps on planar metallic - dielectric surfaces .",
    "when a perfect metal without damping is considered in this planar case , the two types of solutions of the spps dispersion relations overlap with the same asymptotic behavior .",
    "when the metal ohmic loss is introduced into the dielectric response of the metal , the two types of solutions are then different . before such conclusion",
    "is extended to the case of the cylindrical metallic nanowire , it is necessary to exhibit how the metal ohmic loss leads to the back bending of the dispersion relations of the metallic nanowire . in this paper , we derive approximate analytical solutions to the complex dispersion relations of a cylindrical metal nanowire for the description of the back bending as well as the asymptotic behavior of the spps . based on the analytical expressions , the role of metal ohmic loss in the determination of the back bending is discussed .",
    "the utility of the back bending for the measurement of the metal ohmic loss has also been suggested .",
    "the metal nanowire is modeled to have the shape of a circular cylinder with the radius @xmath3 and the infinite length in a medium .",
    "the electromagnetic field in this model can be expanded with cylindrical harmonics . by imposing the electromagnetic boundary conditions at the metal - dielectric interface , we obtain the following transcendental equation : @xmath4 which repeats the reported results .",
    "@xcite here , @xmath5 is the first kind of hankel function with the order of integer @xmath6 and @xmath7 is the bessel function of @xmath6th order .",
    "the hankel and bessel functions with denote represent the first order differentiation .",
    "@xmath8 is the wave vector with the value of @xmath9 , where @xmath10is the dielectric function and the subscript @xmath11 labels the quantities outside the nanowire ( @xmath12 ) or inside it ( @xmath13 ) .",
    "@xmath14 is the speed of light in vacuum .",
    "the dielectric function of the metal can be expressed as @xmath15,\\ ] ] where @xmath16 is the bulk - plasmon frequency and @xmath17 is the bulk electron relaxation rate ,  @xcite which reflects the metal ohmic loss .",
    "@xmath18 in equation ( 2 ) is a constant for the general description of the dielectric function of the metal .",
    "@xmath19 is the component of the spps wave vector along the cylinder axial and the radial components of the wave vectors are defined as @xmath20 .",
    "we note that the value of @xmath21 should be chosen to guarantee the imaginary part of @xmath21 to be positive since the light intensity should be decaying away from the metal cylinder .",
    "the dispersion relation between @xmath19 and @xmath22 then can be obtained from the equation ( 1 ) .",
    "however , it is impossible to get an analytical solution to the equation for the whole dispersion relation .",
    "we show in the following that the sections of the dispersion relations whose frequencies are close to the surface plasmon frequency can be solved out from equation ( 1 ) analytically with approximate methods . for clarity in the following derivation ,",
    "we renormalize the @xmath22 and @xmath17 by @xmath23 .",
    "wave vector components of @xmath8 , @xmath19 and @xmath24 are renormalized by @xmath25 and @xmath3 is renormalized by @xmath26 .",
    "for the sections of the dispersion relations with frequencies close to the surface plasmon frequency @xmath27 , the spps modes of the metal nanowires are nonradiative and the real parts of @xmath19 noted as @xmath28 $ ] at those sections have larger values than the imaginary parts @xmath29 $ ] .",
    "the values of @xmath28 $ ] play more important role in the bessel and hankel functions than the values of @xmath29 $ ] , which makes the bessel functions and hankel functions in the equation ( 1 ) behave as modified bessel functions . in order to verify this point ,",
    "we have conducted numerical calculations on the bessel functions and hankel functions with the frequency close to the surface plasmon frequency , and found that the bessel function approaches to infinite while the hankel function goes to be zero .",
    "thus , it is reasonable to replace the bessel and hankel functions in equation ( 1 ) by the following approximate expressions :    @xmath30    @xmath31    with @xmath32 replaced by @xmath33 in the derivation . in order to get the analytical solutions to equation ( 1 ) ,",
    "@xmath24 should be expanded by @xmath19 as @xmath34    in this paper we only discuss the zeroth - order analytical solutions with @xmath35 .",
    "substituting equation ( 3 ) into the equation ( 1 ) , we obtain the following equation @xmath36 there exist four solutions to the equation ( 4 ) . however , only one solution is correct . especially for the case of @xmath37 , the equation ( 4 )",
    "is then solved out to be @xmath38 , which is the right dispersion relation of spps on a planar metal surface .      for clarity to show our derivation , we set the dielectric constants as @xmath41 .",
    "then , the surface plasmon frequency is @xmath42 .",
    "firstly , we consider the @xmath1 solution .",
    "we rewrite the equation ( 4 ) expressed by @xmath43 , @xmath22 , @xmath17 and @xmath3 as @xmath44k_{z}^{4}+[\\frac{1}{r}+\\frac{(i\\tau)}{r\\omega}]k_{z}^{3 } \\nonumber\\\\ & & + [ 6\\omega^{2}(1-\\omega^{2})-1 + 6\\omega(i\\tau)(1 - 2\\omega^{2})-6\\omega^{2}(i\\tau)^{2}]k_{z}^{2 } \\nonumber\\\\ & & + ( 2\\omega^{2}-1)(\\omega^{2}-1)\\omega^{2}+(i\\tau)(4\\omega^{2}-3)\\omega^{3}+2(i\\tau)^{2}\\omega^{4}\\nonumber\\\\ & & = 0.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in the @xmath1 solution , there exists a back bending of the spps where the frequency @xmath22 is close to the surface plasmon frequency @xmath42 . comparing to the terms with the same order of @xmath45",
    ", we find that the last three terms without @xmath43 can be neglected since the @xmath46 $ ] is large enough at the back bending point .",
    "thus , equation ( 5 ) can be further simplified as @xmath44k_{z}^{2}+[\\frac{1}{r}+\\frac{(i\\tau)}{r\\omega}]k_{z } \\nonumber\\\\ & & + [ 6\\omega^{2}(1-\\omega^{2})-1 + 6\\omega(i\\tau)(1 - 2\\omega^{2})-6\\omega^{2}(i\\tau)^{2 } ] \\nonumber\\\\ & & = 0.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] then , the complex @xmath43 can be solved out from the equation ( 6 ) .",

    "the approximate methods are conducted regardless of @xmath47 $ ] .",
    "thus , the correct solution to the equation ( 6 ) for the @xmath46 $ ] is @xmath48=re[\\frac{-[\\frac{1}{r}+\\frac{(i\\tau)}{r\\omega}]-\\sqrt{[\\frac{1}{r}+\\frac{(i\\tau)}{r\\omega}]^{2}-4k_{a}k_{c}}}{2k_{a}}],\\\\\\ ] ] with @xmath49 especially for the case of @xmath50 , @xmath46 $ ] is then equal to @xmath48=\\frac{-\\frac{1}{r}-\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{r^{2}}-4(4\\omega^{2}-2)[6\\omega^{2}(1-\\omega^{2})-1]}}{2(4\\omega^{2}-2)}.\\ ] ] now we consider the @xmath0 solution .",
