    "supercooled or metastable states have been reported across first order phase transitions in vortex matter @xcite .",
    "it has also been established that isothermal field excursions cause the metastable phase to be converted to the stable phase @xcite .",
    "we have proposed @xcite that the isothermal field variations provide a fluctuation energy that causes the metastable supercooled phase to cross the free - energy barrier and transform to the stable equilibrium phase .",
    "the experimental techniques used to study the magnetic signatures of such transformations in vortex matter are ( i ) bulk dc measurements using a squid or a vibrating sample magnetometer which yields the magnetisation m of the entire sample @xcite ; ( ii ) bulk ac measurements of susceptibility which probe a region near the surface of the sample @xcite ; and ( iii ) local measurements of magnetic induction using magneto - optic or microhall probes that allow mapping the spatial profile b(x ) @xcite .",
    "the last of these three techniques has been used recently to show that different ( metastable and equilibrium ) phases exist simultaneously in different regions of the sample @xcite .",
    "similar inference has also been drawn by studies using the dc magnetisation @xcite and ac susceptibility @xcite techniques .",
    "experiments have thus shown that metastable to stable transformations occur over local regions , and prompted by these developments we have given a formalism to calculate spatially - resolved energy dissipation under an isothermal field variation @xcite . in this paper",
    "we shall use this formalism to calculate how the metastable to stable transformation progresses inwards from the surface of the sample , under experimentally relevant field excursions .",
    "we shall also calculate the sample magnetisation m and the spatial field profile b(x ) as the experimental observables .",
    "the response of a hard superconductor to external magnetic fields is understood in terms of bean s critical state model ( csm ) @xcite .",
    "bean had assumed that the critical current density j@xmath0 is independent of field . while detailed agreement with experiments has required introduction of various functional forms of j@xmath0(b ) ( see e.g. ref . [ 14 ] ) , much of the essential physics is captured even by assuming a field - independent j@xmath0 .",
    "experiments have recently been addressing the region below and near the onset of a peak in j@xmath0(b ) at b = b@xmath1 , where a first order phase transition is seen in some superconductors@xcite .",
    "the occurrence of this `` peak - effect '' has been known in various superconductors for a very long time , but attempts to have a csm describing this j@xmath0(b ) have been made only recently @xcite . while our detailed analytical model @xcite could be used for the subsequent calculations , our focus here is to understand whether qualitatively new and anomalous signatures in recent experiments @xcite can be arising from metastable to stable transformations in vortex matter . in this paper",
    "we shall use a simple bean - like assumption for the two phases of vortex matter viz .",
    "@xmath2 we stress that , at a fixed temperature , our model has only two constant parameters viz .",
    "( j@xmath3/j@xmath1 ) and b@xmath1 .",
    "we have assumed above that phase 1 ( characterised by j@xmath1 ) is the stable phase for b(x)@xmath4 , and phase 2 ( characterised by j@xmath3 ) is the stable phase for b(x)@xmath5 .",
    "we recognise that j@xmath0 is not a thermodynamic quantity , but is a physical property that changes discontinuously across the phase transition .",
    "phase 2 can exist for b(x ) @xmath4 as a supercooled metastable phase , and we shall address this possibility in the next section . in this section",
    "we shall assume , however , that the free energy barrier surrounding the metastable phase drops very sharply as b(x)=b@xmath1 is crossed , and supercooling or superheating does not occur .    to obtain magnetisation - vs - field ( or m - h ) curves",
    ", we consider the sample to be in the form of an infinite slab in parallel field , as this geometry has the simplest algebra amongst the zero demagnetization factor cases of infinite cylinders in parallel field .",
    "we shall also continue with bean s simplifying assumption of h@xmath6=0 followed usually in the csm @xcite .",
    "we follow standard procedures @xcite to solve the csm , and show in figure 1 the envelope m - h curves obtained with equation ( 1 ) , with the parameters b@xmath1=1500 mtesla , j@xmath1r=4mtesla , and j@xmath3r=10 mtesla . here",
    "the slab has surfaces at x=@xmath7r , is infinite along the y and z directions , and the magnetic field is applied along the z - axis .",
    "( we shall consider only positive values of x in this paper ; there is a symmetry about x=0 . )",
    "note that the first order transition shows different widths in m vs h when measured along the field - increasing and along the field - decreasing directions .",
    "this is because the shielding current density at x is dictated @xcite by the local magnetic induction b(x ) through equation ( 1 ) , and b(x ) is different from the applied field as well as different in the field - increasing and field - decreasing cases . in figure 2",
    "we plot b(x ) for some values of applied field h corresponding to the field - increasing and field - decreasing cases .",
    "we note that phase 1 and 2 exist simultaneously in two different regions of the sample .",
    "we emphasize that there is no metastability because the stable phase 1 exists wherever b(x)@xmath4 and the stable phase 2 exists wherever b(x)@xmath5 .",
    "the calculation above is for some fixed temperature t@xmath1 , and we note that the phase transition field b@xmath1 falls as the temperature t@xmath1 rises @xcite .",
    "we now consider that we have applied a field h@xmath1 which is smaller than b@xmath1(t@xmath1 ) .",
    "but we apply this field at a much higher temperature t@xmath3 such that h@xmath1 is much larger than b@xmath1(t@xmath3 ) .",
    "so , b(x ) throughout the sample is larger than b@xmath1 at that temperature , and the entire sample is in phase 2 .",
    "we assume further that b(x ) is constant at t@xmath3 .",
    "this happens if the critical current density j@xmath3 in phase 2 vanishes at t@xmath3 .",
    "one can , however , also achieve a constant b(x ) by applying an external field h@xmath1+hcos(wt ) , with ( h@xmath1-b@xmath1(t@xmath3 ) ) @xmath8 h @xmath8 j@xmath3(t@xmath3)r , and then slowly reducing the amplitude h to zero @xcite .",
    "we now lower the sample temperature ( i.e. field - cool ) to t@xmath1 such that the sample is supercooled and is metastable in phase 2 .",
    "as discussed in references [ 11,12,17 ] , there is a free energy barrier f@xmath9(t ) that keeps phase 2 metastable , where f@xmath9(t ) is determined uniquely by b(x ) and t. the vortex matter in the neighbourhood of x will transform to phase 1 when the fluctuation energy p@xmath10(x ) created by an isothermal field variation is larger than [ f@xmath9(t ) - kt ] .",
    "the field profile b(x ) in the field - cooled sample is constant at h@xmath1 ( see figure 3 ) , and we now start lowering the applied field h with the temperature fixed at t@xmath1 .",
    "since the sample is in the supercooled phase 2 , the shielding currents set up initially will have a magnitude j@xmath3 .",
    "the variations in field will cause a fluctuation energy p@xmath10(x ) given by equations ( 4 ) and ( 5 ) of reference [ 12 ] , and the vortex matter in the neighbourhood of x = x@xmath11 will transform to the stable phase at p@xmath10(x@xmath11)= f@xmath9(t ) - kt = p@xmath11 .",
    "this transformation is triggered from the surface @xcite and the shielding current magnitude will drop to j@xmath1 for x @xmath8 x@xmath11 .",
    "the point x@xmath11 moves from ( x / r)=1 to ( x / r)=0 as the applied field is lowered , and b(x ) are shown in figure 3 for representative values of the applied field .",
    "we have used h@xmath1=1480 mtesla , and p@xmath11=18 ( mtesla)@xmath12 .",
    "the large ( small ) slopes of b(x ) correspond to large ( small ) magnitudes of the shielding current density , and thus to vortex matter being in phase 2 ( phase 1 ) . from these b(x ) one can readily calculate @xcite the sample magnetisation as the field h is lowered . in figure 4",
    "we show the minor hysteresis loop ( mhl ) obtained as the applied field is lowered after field - cooling .",
    "we show also the field - decreasing envelope curve from figure 1 .",
    "note that the mhl first shoots out above the envelope curve , and then slowly merges from above .",
    "this nature is in qualitative agreement with published data @xcite .",
    "if we had used the detailed j@xmath0(b ) of reference [ 15 ] to model the peak - effect , instead of the simple model of equation ( 1 ) , the peak of the mhl would be less sharp and the merger with the envelope curve would be slower .",
    "the simple model used to obtain figure 4 brings out the qualitative behaviour observed and captures the essential underlying origin of anomalous mhls as being due to phase 2 being supercooled and the transformation from the metastable phase 2 to the stable phase 1 occurring progressively deeper into the sample .",
    "we have assumed that p@xmath11 ( and thus f@xmath9(t@xmath1 ) ) is constant at 18 ( mtesla)@xmath12 .",
    "f@xmath9(t@xmath1 ) is actually dictated by b(x@xmath11 ) , and falls monotonically as b(x@xmath11 ) moves farther from the phase transition line b@xmath1(t ) . as is seen in figure 3 ,",
    "b(x@xmath11 ) varies only by less than a few mtesla as the mhl merges with the envelope curve .",
    "the assumption of a constant p@xmath11 over an mhl is thus justified . if , however , we field - cool to the same temperature t@xmath1 at a lower field h@xmath3 , then f@xmath9(t ) will be lower @xcite .",
    "this implies that p@xmath11(h@xmath13=h@xmath3 ) will be smaller than p@xmath11(h@xmath13=h@xmath1 ) .",
    "we show , in figure 5(a ) , the mhl for the case when the sample was field - cooled to h@xmath3=1400 mtesla where p@xmath11 is taken to be 4.5 ( mtesla)@xmath12 . in figure 5(b ) we have taken h@xmath13=h@xmath14=1300 mtesla , where f@xmath9 must be still lower and is taken as p@xmath11=2 ( mtesla)@xmath12 .",
    "the mhls again shoot out of the envelope curve , but to peak values progressively smaller than in figure 4 .",
    "the merger of the mhls with the envelope curve also occurs over a progressively narrower range of field reduction than in figure 4 .",
    "this qualitative change in the nature of the mhls with reduction of h@xmath13 is also consistent with published data @xcite .",
    "we have used the ideas developed in references [ 11,12,17 ] to calculate the isothermal field - cooled mhls , and the spatial field profiles b(x ) .",
    "the model calculation was done , in the spirit of bean s original work @xcite , with field - independent critical current densities .",
    "the only parameters were ( j@xmath3/j@xmath1 ) , and the onset field b@xmath1 at which the peak effect starts in the field increasing case .",
    "we used the fact @xcite that f@xmath9 becomes smaller as b(x ) falls below b@xmath1 , and that metastable to stable transformations occur in local regions of the sample @xcite .",
    "the formalism of reference [ 12 ] can similarly be used to calculate mhls after different thermomagnetic histories .",
    "we assert here that the simple model of equation ( 1 ) reproduces qualitative features of various observations @xcite of anomalous mhls . as was stated in the introduction , more detailed tests of the extent of phase coexistence are possible and calculated b(x ) can be compared with field profiles measured with local probes .",
    "our model also predicts the spatial region over which the two phases coexist , and the evolution of these regions under isothermal field variation .",
