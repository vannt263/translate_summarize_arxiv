    "the process of low - mass star formation is reasonably well understood . the accepted model ( e.g. , shu et al .",
    "1987 ) requires a disk - yso - outflow system ( _ yso : young stellar object _ ) , and it has been supported by theoretical and observational results ( e.g. evans , 1999 and references therein ) . in addition , bipolar molecular outflows associated with low - mass stars are believed to be driven by their jets , that can be observed at sub - arcsec scales and this constitute the best evidence of collimation at the smallest scales now known ( e.g. anglada 1996 ) . however , the process of high - mass star formation is not well understood yet .",
    "in fact , although molecular outflows seem to be also common among high - mass stars ( gmez et al . 1999 , zhang et al .",
    "2001 , ridge & moore , 2001 ; beuther et al .",
    "2002 , shepherd 2005 ) , there is still a deficit in the detection of circumstellar disks and jets associated with massive ysos ( e.g. , cepheus a hw2 : rodrguez et al . 1994 ; patel et al . 2005 ; curiel et al .",

    "2006 ) . in spite of these studies ,",
    "it is not clear whether molecular outflows in massive ysos are also driven by collimated jets as low - mass stars do .",
    "therefore , studies of individual high - mass ysos are very important to address these issues , but their identification is more difficult than in the case of low - mass objects .",
    "firstly , the spatial density of massive objects is smaller and we need to go to greater distances to increase the known sample and build statistical significance , and second , they are formed in dense clusters and sub - arcsecond angular resolution observations are required to isolate them .",
    "the star - forming region , s140  irs , is located in the molecular cloud l1204 at a distance of 910 pc ( crampton & fisher , 1974 ) . in this region , there is a group of at least three zams b stars ( irs  1 , irs  2 , irs  3 ; beichman et al . 1979 ) , with a total luminosity of @xmath2  l@xmath3 ( lester et al .",
    "1986 ) , with irs  1 being the brightest one .",
    "in addition , a co bipolar outflow extended along the northwest - southeast direction has been observed in the region by hayashi et al .",
    "minchin et al .",
    "( 1993 ) found that the blue and redshifted lobes of the co bipolar outflow have position angles of @xmath4 and @xmath5 , respectively . on the other hand , k band",
    "( 2.0 - 2.3  @xmath6 m ) and h@xmath0 observations have revealed two bipolar outflows in the region ( preibisch & smith 2002 and weigelt et al .",
    "2002 ) , one of them with an orientation similar to the co outflow ( 160/340@xmath7 ) and the other one in the 20/200@xmath7 direction .",
    "both bipolar outflows seem to be centered on irs  1 . the region s140  irs has also been studied at the infrared and optical bands ( eiroa et al . 1993 ) , nh@xmath8 lines ( verdes - montenegro et al .",
    "1989 ) , and radio continuum emission ( schwartz 1989 , evans et al .",
    "more recently , hoare ( 2006 ) has observed irs  1 at 6 cm during three epochs with merlin , and shows , through a very detailed analysis that it is highly elongated in the northeast - southwest direction , and also proposes that the radio continuum traces an ionized equatorial wind driven by radiation pressure from the central star and oriented in the northeast - southwest direction , perpendicular to the co bipolar outflow .",
    "in addition , water maser emission has also been detected toward the s140  irs region ( e.g. tofani et al .",

    ", we report and discuss new high angular resolution observations of 1.3  cm continuum and water maser emission toward the s140  irs region carried out with the very large array ( vla ) in the a configuration . in order to present a full study of irs  1 ,",
    "we have also analyzed 7  mm continuum observations ( vla data archive ; see also gibb & hoare , 2007 ) and re - analyzed vla centimeter continuum observations ( previously published by schwartz 1989 and tofani et al .",
    "we describe the observations in  2 and present the results in  3 . in section",
    " 4 , we discuss the nature of the multiple continuum sources that we detect in the region , while our main conclusions are summarized in  5 .",
    "the observations toward the s140  irs region were made with the vla of the national radio astronomy observatory ( nrao ) in its a configuration on 1999 june 29 .",
    "we observed simultaneously 1.3  cm continuum and water maser emission .",
    "we used two different bandwidths , one of 25  mhz with seven channels for the continuum and another one of 3.125  mhz with 63 channels for the maser line emission .",
    "both the right and left circular polarizations were sampled in the above two different bandwidths , which were averaged in order to improve the sensitivity .",
    "the broad bandwidth for the continuum observations was centered at 22285.080  mhz , while the narrow bandwidth for the line observations was centered at the frequency of the h@xmath0o @xmath9 maser line ( rest frequency 22235.080  mhz ) with v@xmath10  km  s@xmath11 , covering from @xmath12 to 10  km  s@xmath11 in velocity .",
    "the absolute amplitude calibrator was 3c  286 with an adopted flux density of 2.51  jy , while the phase calibrator was b2021 + 614 with a bootstrapped flux density of @xmath13  jy .",
    "the water maser line and continuum data were reduced and calibrated using the standard techniques using the nrao aips software package .",
    "after the first calibration , we searched the narrow bandwidth data for the spectral channel with the strongest water maser emission and then its signal was self - calibrated in phase and amplitude .",
    "we then cross - calibrated the data applying the phase and amplitude corrections to both the narrow and the broad bandwidths . in this way ,",
    "the atmospheric and instrumental errors at high frequencies on long baselines were removed ( see for details reid & menten 1990 , torrelles et al .",
    "1996 ) and the signal - to - noise ratio was improved .",
    "we also used the data set at 7  mm from the vla data archive ( see also gibb & hoare , 2007 ) .",
    "in addition , we re - analyzed continuum observations at 2 , 3.5 and 6  cm , which have been previously published ( see table [ observations ] ) .",
    "all observations were carried out in the a configuration .",
    "we recalibrated these data sets and made new contour maps using the current procedures of aips .",
    "we used the physical parameters derived from these new contour maps for the discussion in this paper .",
    "contour maps at 2 and 6  cm and their measured physical parameters are consistent with those published before by schwartz ( 1989 ) . however , the flux density estimated at 3.5  cm is different ( about @xmath14 lower ) to that reported by tofani et al .",
    "( 1995 ) , probably due to a typo .",
    "figure [ irs1 ] shows the contour maps of s140  irs  1 at centimeter wavelengths ( 1.3 , 2.0 , 3.5 and 6.0  cm ) . given that other condensations are also detected around s140  irs  1 , hereafter , we will refer to s140  irs  1 as s140  irs  1a or only irs  1a for clarity .",
    "this source appears spatially resolved at all wavelengths .",
    "the physical parameters of the radio source irs  1a ( position , flux density , deconvolved angular size and position angle ) were obtained from elliptical gaussian fits using the aips task imfit and are given in table [ flux ] .",
    "contour maps at 1.3 and 2  cm have similar angular resolution ( @xmath15 ) and were made with natural- and uniform - weighting , respectively . on the other hand , contour maps at 3.5 and 6  cm have an angular resolution of @xmath16 ( figure [ irs1 ] ) . for the map at 3.6  cm a gaussian taper of 850  k@xmath17",
    "was used , while at 6  cm a robust = 1 parameter ( briggs 1995 ) of the aips task imagr was used .    in all contour maps ( figure [ irs1 ] ) ,",
    "irs  1a shows a general elongated morphology in the northeast - southwest direction , similar to the orientation of the bipolar outflow observed in h@xmath0 toward irs  1a in the @xmath18 direction ( preibisch & smith 2002 ) .",
    "in addition , our contour map at 1.3  cm with angular resolution of @xmath19 ( robust = 0 parameter was used in order to optimize the compromise between the signal - to - noise ratio and the angular resolution ) shows a second peak , at a level of 4@xmath20 , located about @xmath21 to the southwest from irs  1a ( figure [ multi ] ) .",
    "we will refer to this peak as irs  1b .",
    "furthermore , three other continuum peaks ( that we will refer as irs  1c , irs  1d and irs  1e ) , are also observed at 3.5  cm with an angular resolution of @xmath22 ( figure [ multi ] ) .",
    "irs  1c is located @xmath23 to the northeast of irs  1a ( figure [ multi ] ) and is also detected at 2  cm with an angular resolution of @xmath24 .",

    "although the 7  mm continuum emission is also elongated in the northeast - southwest direction as the centimeter emission ( 1.3 , 2 , 3.5 and 6 cm ) , they do not have , within the error , the same position angle ( the millimeter emission has a position angle of @xmath26 , while the centimeter emission has a position angle of @xmath27 ) .",
    "these results are consistent with those found very recently by gibb and hoare ( 2007 ) .",
    "the water maser emission toward s140 irs was in a period of minimum activity during our vla observations and we only detect three water maser features spatially associated with irs  1a ( figure [ irs1 ] ) .",
    "one of these maser features , with redshifted velocity with respect to the molecular cloud velocity ( @xmath28  km  s@xmath11 , zhou et al . 1993 ) , is located close ( @xmath29 ) to the irs  1a continuum emission peak at 1.3  cm , while the other two maser features , with blueshifted velocity with respect to the molecular cloud velocity , are located @xmath30 and @xmath31 to the southwest of irs  1a , respectively ( see fig .",
    "[ irs1 ] and table [ maser ] ) .",
    "figure 9 from trinidad et al .",
    "( 2003 ) shows that the water maser emission toward s140 irs was stronger ( up to 46 jy with at least seven features ) a month before the vla observations presented here .",
    "the position , velocity , and flux density of the three detected vla water maser features are given in table [ maser ] .",
    "the elongated morphology of the irs  1a is evident in the contour maps at all centimeter wavelengths ( 1.3 , 2 , 3.5 , and 6  cm ) , suggesting a jet - like nature ( see figure [ irs1 ] ) , similar to other possible radio jets associated with massive ysos ( e.g. , claussen et al .",

    "however , hoare ( 2006 ) , based on very detailed 6  cm continuum multiepoch observations with merlin , has proposed that the continuum emission is produced by an equatorial wind .",
    "we discuss both of these possibilities below .      in order to investigate whether or not irs  1a is a thermal jet , we have calculated , following the formalism of reynolds ( 1986 ) , the dependence of the flux density and the deconvolved angular size of the major axis of the jet with the frequency .",
    "for the case of a thermal jet with constant velocity , temperature , and ionization fraction , the dependence of the flux density with the frequency is @xmath32 ( @xmath33 ; equation 14 of reynolds 1986 ) , while that for the deconvolved angular size of the major axis is @xmath34 ( @xmath35 ) . under this formalism",
    ", @xmath36 is the power - law index that describes the dependence of the jet half - width , @xmath37 ( perpendicular to the major axis of the jet ) , as a function of the distance from the origin . for a conical jet , @xmath38 , then , @xmath39 and @xmath40 .    from the multiepoch observations at 6  cm ( hoare 2006 )",
    ", it is known that the flux density of irs  1a is not variable with time .",
    "assuming that the flux density of irs  1a has not changed significantly with time also at other wavelengths ( the observations were made with a time span of about 12 years ; see table [ observations ] ) , we roughly estimate a spectral index of @xmath41 by using the flux densities at 0.7 , 1.3 , 2 , 3.6 , and 6  cm ( see figure [ index ] ) .",
    "in addition , we also estimate the dependence of the angular size of the major axis of irs  1a with frequency , where the parameter is @xmath42 ( see figure [ index ] ) .",
    "both indices , @xmath43 and @xmath44 , seem to be consistent with free - free emission in the wavelength range 0.76 cm , produced either by a conical collimated ionized jet ( @xmath36 = 2/3 , `` standard '' collimated jet ) or by a conical ionized jet ( @xmath36 = 1 , `` standard '' spherical jet ) ( see table 1 of reynolds 1986 ) . on the other hand , using the flux density of irs  1a at 1.3  cm ( this work ) and that at 6  cm obtained with merlin observations ( hoare 2006 ) , a spectral index of about @xmath45 is obtained , which is consistent with that estimated using only vla observations . in this way",
    ", we also note that the flux density and angular diameter of irs  1a as measured with the vla , with an angular resolution of about @xmath46 , and those measured with merlin ( hoare 2006 ) , with an angular resolution of about @xmath47 , are consistent within 2530% .",
    "this result shows that changes of the angular diameter of the source is not due to an effect of angular resolution ; that is , the larger angular size measured at low frequencies is not an effect of lower angular resolution than at higher frequencies .    under the assumption that irs  1a is a thermal jet , we can also estimate the ionized mass - loss ( @xmath48 ) and momentum rate ( @xmath49 ) deposited by irs  1a into the ambient medium . following reynolds ( 1986 ) and using equation 3 given by beltrn et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , for a pure hydrogen jet with constant velocity and ionization fraction , we have @xmath50^{3/4 }     \\left [ \\left ( \\frac{s_\\nu}{mjy } \\right ) \\left ( \\frac{\\nu}{10ghz }            \\right)^{-\\alpha } \\right]^{3/4 }     \\left ( \\frac{v}{200 km s^{-1 } } \\right )",

    "the opening angle is approximately estimated using @xmath59 .",
    "then , assuming a inclination angle of the jet axis relative the line of sight , @xmath60 , a distance of 910  pc , an electron temperature of @xmath61  k , a lower limit for @xmath54 ( @xmath62  ghz ) , and a terminal velocity of @xmath63  km  s@xmath11 , we determine the mass - loss ( @xmath48 ) and momentum rate ( @xmath49 ) deposited by irs  1a into the ambient medium as @xmath64  m@xmath3  yr@xmath11 and @xmath65  m@xmath3  yr@xmath11  km  s@xmath11 , respectively .",
    "these values are similar to those obtained for the thermal jets associated with other massive ysos ( e.g cep a w2 and hh  80 ) . on the other hand , using the correlation ( momentum rate versus radio continuum luminosity ) given by anglada ( 1996 ) to estimate the momentum rate , we find a value about two order of magnitude larger than that estimated using the formalism of reynolds .",
    "this result suggests that anglada s correlation is valid only for low luminosity objects and can not be extrapolated to high luminosity sources .",
    "we have also detected four condensations almost aligned along the major axis of the irs  1a ( see figure [ multi ] ) .",
    "one continuum peak ( irs  1b ) is detected at 1.3  cm , while the other three continuum peaks ( irs  1c , 1d , 1e ) are detected at 3.5  cm . as irs  1b is detected only at 1.3  cm",
    "( although irs  1b and 1e are located to the southwest of irs  1a , both continuum peaks are not spatially coincident ) , we are not able to estimate its spectral index , which could have helped to investigate whether it is a condensation ejected by irs  1a or , alternatively , an independent source .",
    "the continuum peaks irs  1d and 1e are almost symmetrically located with respect to irs  1a ( see figure [ multi ] ) and both condensations have similar peak flux densities , which could suggest that they are condensations ejected by irs  1a , as could be expected for a thermal jet . multiepoch observations ( e.g at 3.5  cm ) to measure possible proper motions of irs 1d and 1e could test if these are condensations ejected by the jet . on the other hand",
    ", the condensation irs  1c does not have a counterpart on the symmetrically opposite side as in the case of the pair formed by 1d and 1e .",
    "in addition , irs  1c appears misaligned with respect to the 1d - irs  1a-1e system ( see figure [ multi ] ) .",
    "then , if irs  1c was also ejected by the jet irs  1a , this could indicate that irs  1a is precessing",
    ". alternatively , irs  1c could be an independent source . in this way",
    ", irs  1c seems to coincide spatially , within the positional error , with the clump ne - n detected by hoare ( 2006 ) at 6  cm wavelength . using the peak flux densities at 3.5 ( this work ) and 6  cm ( hoare 2006 ) ,",
    "we have roughly estimated a spectral index for irs  1c of @xmath66 , which suggest that the continuum emission of irs  1c is being produced by partially - thick thermal free - free emission .",
    "in addition , hoare ( 2006 ) has reported possible proper motion of the ne - n clump with a tangential velocity of 120  km  s@xmath11 moving toward the east .",
    "however , due to this high value of the velocity , hoare ( 2006 ) opens the possibility that the proper motion is not due to real physical motion but due to a travelling illuminating wave .",
    "the overall radio continuum properties of irs  1a indicate that it could be a thermal jet associated with a high - mass yso .",
    "in addition , the position angle of the elongated structure at cm wavelengths ( @xmath27 ; table [ flux ] ) suggests that irs  1a could be the driving source of the bipolar molecular outflow seen in h@xmath0 in the direction @xmath18 . under this scenario and assuming that the condensation irs  1c is an independent source , we speculate that this newly detected source ( irs  1c ) could be the driving source of the other bipolar molecular outflow observed in the direction @xmath67 . if this is the case , two close , independent and almost perpendicular jets could be the driving sources of the two bipolar outflows observed in the region ( see figure [ multi ] ) .",
    "perpendicular thermal jets have been observed in low - mass star forming regions ( e.g. hh  111 , reipurth et al .",
    "1999 ) .",
    "in addition , all water maser features detected toward s140  irs are associated with irs  1a , assuming that irs  1e is not a stellar object but ejected from irs 1a ( see figure [ irs1 ] and [ multi ] ) .",
    "the estimated mass for irs  1a , assuming that the masers are bound gravitationally , is @xmath68  m@xmath3 , which is greater than the mass estimated from its luminosity ( @xmath69  m@xmath3 ) .",
    "this result indicates that the water maser features are not associated with a circumstellar disk , instead , the water masers are tracing unbound motions , which is consistent with irs  1a being a thermal jet .",
    "further observations with high angular resolution and proper motion studies will be needed to study in detail the three - dimensional ( spatio - kinematical ) distribution of the water masers in the region , which will help to understand the nature of the irs  1a and possibly discriminate between the thermal jet and equatorial wind models ( see below ) .      using high angular resolution multiepoch observations at 6  cm toward irs  1a , hoare ( 2006 )",
    "proposes that irs  1a is an equatorial wind driven by radiation pressure from a central star and inner disk acting on the gas in the surface layers of the disk , and perpendicular to the co bipolar outflow observed in the direction 160@xmath7/340@xmath7 .",
    "this scenario is supported by two facts .",
    "first , the location and extension perpendicular to the major axis of irs  1a of a small scale monopolar near - ir reflection nebula at the base of the blueshifted lobe of the molecular outflow , and second , the small outward proper motion of a continuum clump in the direction 160@xmath7/340@xmath7 as would be expected for a jet .",
    "the results of hoare are opposed to the picture of the multiple jets described above for irs  1a . however , our observational results could be also consistent with irs  1a being an equatorial wind . as mentioned above",
    "(   4.1 ) , there are two condensations ( irs  1d and 1e ) located symmetrically on opposite sides of the central source , irs  1a , and under the equatorial wind model , irs  1d and 1e could be tracing the outer border of the wind within a disk with diameter of @xmath70  au .    unfortunately , with the present data we can not discriminate between the two proposed models for irs  1a ( jet versus equatorial wind ) .",
    "however , we note that the presence of the outflow in the 20@xmath7/200@xmath7 direction ( in addition to the outflow in the 160@xmath7/340@xmath7 direction ) , requires at least two independent powering ysos in the region . in this way , within the equatorial wind scenario irs  1a would be the exciting source of the 160@xmath7/340@xmath7 outflow ( as proposed by hoare 2006 ) , while the new detected source irs  1c would power the 20@xmath7/200@xmath7 outflow .",
    "additional observations are required to discriminate in a more definitive way between the equatorial wind and the thermal jet scenarios .",
    "any detection of large proper motions ( hundred of km s@xmath11 ) in the irs  1d and 1e condensations in the northeast - southwest direction would favor the jet hypothesis .",
    "this test would require sensitive , high angular resolution continuum observations over several years .",
    "on the other hand , the study of the high velocity molecular gas in the vicinity of the source irs  1a could reveal the wide angle outflow expected from an equatorial wind .",
    "any detection , with high angular resolution observations , of molecular gas correlated with the radio continuum source could trace the neutral part of the disk and also provide strong evidence favoring the equatorial wind scenario .",
    "in addition , as we have mentioned before , proper motion studies of the water masers observed in this region could be a powerful tool to discriminate between both models .",
    "on the other hand , with the present theoretical models ( e.g. drew et al .",
    "1998 ; lugo et al . 2004 ) , we can not also discriminate between jet and equatorial wind models .",
    "however , we think that in an equatorial wind model the angular diameter might be less sensitive to the frequency of observation than in an jet model . in any case",
    ", more detailed theoretical studies will be necessary to address this important issue .",
    "we have presented results of 1.3  cm continuum and water maser emission observations made with the vla in its a configuration toward the s140  irs region . we have also re - analyzed continuum observations at 0.7 , 2 , 3.5 , and 6  cm .",
    "we observed irs  1a at all wavelengths ( 0.7 , 1.3 , 2 , 3.5 , and 6  cm ) and also detected four new continuum peaks ( irs  1b , 1c , 1d and 1e ) .",
    "irs  1b is only detected at 1.3  cm , while irs  1c , 1d and 1e are detected at 3.5  cm .",
    "irs  1c , located@xmath23 to the northeast of irs  1a , seems to be an independent source , while irs  1d and 1e , located symmetrically with respect to irs  1a , seem to be condensations associated with irs  1a . under this scenario ,",
    "irs  1a is not a single source , but a possible binary formed by irs 1a and 1c .",
    "these two ysos could explain the excitation of the two large bipolar molecular outflows observed toward s140  irs1 .",
    "we have also detected three water masers toward irs  1 that most probably are tracing unbound motions and are associated with the bipolar molecular outflow in the northeast - southwest direction .    in order to understand the nature of irs  1a , we have analyzed two scenarios : the thermal jet model and the equatorial wind model .",
    "the elongated morphology and spectral indices , @xmath43 and @xmath44 , of the continuum emission in the 0.7  6  cm wavelength range , are consistent with irs  1a being a thermal jet .",

    "<S> the presence of these two ysos ( irs  1a and 1c ) could explain the existence of the two bipolar molecular outflows observed in the region . </S>",
