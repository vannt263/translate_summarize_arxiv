    "symplectic field theory ( sft ) , proposed about 15 years ago by eliashberg - givental - hofer @xcite , is a package which gives invariants of contact manifolds and symplectic manifolds with boundary as well as gluing formulas for gromov - witten invariants on closed symplectic manifolds .",
    "the transversality theory in the somewhere injective case and the fredholm theory were carried out by dragnev  @xcite and the sft compactness was worked out by @xcite , both very early on in the development of the theory . however , the rigorous foundations of the full theory are still under development , although parts of the theory are gradually becoming more rigorous , thanks to the efforts of many authors , primarily by hofer - wysocki - zehnder  @xcite .",
    "partial work has been done by hutchings - nelson  @xcite and bao - honda  @xcite for cylindrical contact homology in dimension three and bourgeois - oancea  @xcite on @xmath7-equivariant symplectic homology .",
    "also the kuranishi perturbation theory of fukaya - ono  @xcite and fukaya - oh - ohta - ono @xcite ( which is closest in spirit to this work ) and the approaches of liu - tian  @xcite and @xcite may be used to define sft , although this has not been done yet .",
    "the goal of this paper is to make a further contribution to this effort and define the full contact homology differential graded algebra ( dga ) for any closed contact manifold in any dimension and show that its isomorphism class is an invariant of the contact manifold . more precisely , given a closed cooriented contact @xmath8-dimensional manifold @xmath0 and some auxiliary data @xmath1 which includes a nondegenerate contact form @xmath9 for @xmath10 , we define a direct limit dga @xmath11 whose homology is called the _ full contact homology algebra _ @xmath2 .",
    "we then prove that :    [ thm : invariance ] if @xmath3 and @xmath4 are two choices of auxiliary data for @xmath0 , then @xmath5 and @xmath6 are isomorphic .",
    "hence the isomorphism class of the algebra @xmath2 is an invariant of @xmath0 .",
    "we denote the isomorphism class of @xmath12 by @xmath13 .",
    "we also prove the following :    [ thm : cobordisms ] let @xmath14 be a compact exact symplectic cobordism which restricts to @xmath15 at the positive boundary and to @xmath16 at the negative boundary .",
    "then there is an algebra homomorphism @xmath17 in the case when @xmath18 and @xmath14 is the trivial cobordism , we have @xmath19 .",
    "the construction of the direct limit dga @xmath11 and the proofs of theorems  [ thm : invariance ] and [ thm : cobordisms ] use a particularly simple version of the kuranishi multivalued perturbation theory of @xcite , which we call _ semi - global kuranishi structures_. the abstract perturbations that we use are supported near the ends of finite energy @xmath20-holomorphic curves and are described using the asymptotic eigenfunctions of the asymptotic operators .",
    "for example ,",
    "if a moduli space @xmath21 of fredholm index @xmath22 @xmath20-holomorphic maps @xmath23 which map to a completed exact symplectic cobordism @xmath24 and are asymptotic to collections @xmath25 and @xmath26 of reeb orbits at the positive and negative ends is already compact ( i.e. , we do not need multiple - level curves in its symplectic field theory ( sft ) compactification ) , then _ we only need one kuranishi chart , which we call a semi - global kuranishi chart_.    we emphasize that our simplification _ crucially uses the existence of at least one end limiting to a reeb orbit _ and can be used to define sft in the case when @xmath24 is an exact symplectic cobordism , although we only deal with contact homology in this paper .",
    "our simplified methods are not readily applicable to the case when there is a _ closed _ multiply - covered @xmath20-holomorphic curve .",
    "however , we expect the combination of our methods and those of @xcite and @xcite to yield a rigorous definition of sft .",
    "finally , during the preparation of this paper , pardon  @xcite posted a paper proving the existence and invariance of contact homology in arbitrary dimensions .",
    ".1in_outline of the paper .",
    "_ we will be using the language of orbifolds and multisections , following adem - leida - ruan  @xcite and fukaya - ono  @xcite ; this is reviewed in section  [ section : orbifolds and multisections ] .",
    "after some preparation in sections  [ section : almost complex structures and moduli spaces ] and [ section : fredholm theory ] , we construct the semi - global kuranishi chart in section  [ section : semi - global kuranishi charts ] , with some modifications in section  [ subsection : trimming ] .",
    "the semi - global kuranishi structure is constructed in section  [ section : construction of semi - global ] , using the gluing results which are stated in section  [ section : gluing ] ; they are average specimens of the `` gluing theorem '' type and are proved in section  [ section : details of gluing ] .",
    "once the semi - global kuranishi structure is constructed , the definition of contact homology , the definition of chain maps , and the invariance of contact homology ( theorems  [ thm : invariance ] and [ thm : cobordisms ] ) follow the usual lines of argument and are carried out in section  [ section : contact homology ] .    we note that the discussion until the end of section  [ section : gluing ] is valid for curves of any genus ; starting from section  [ section : construction of semi - global ] we specialize to contact homology .    .1in_acknowledgements .",
    "_ we thank francis bonahon , tobias ekholm , michael hutchings , eleny ionel , gang liu , and kaoru ono for very helpful discussions .",
    "we also thank tobias ekholm and john pardon for pointing out some errors .",
    "in this section we review the basics of ( effective ) orbifolds , orbibundles , and multisections from @xcite and @xcite . the definitions in this section , while elementary , are a bit cumbersome to state .",
    "also , at the end of the day , all we do is replace the words  manifold \" , `` vector bundle '' , and `` section '' by `` orbifold '' , `` orbibundle '' , and `` multisection '' , and treat them in exactly the same way for our purposes .",
    "for the above reasons the reader may want to skip this section and return to it as the relevant concepts gradually start appearing in the rest of the paper .",

    "hence @xmath2636 by lemma [ fg ] , and this proves the first part of lemma [ lemma : in wkp and c1 ] , namely @xmath2637 for all @xmath710 .    for @xmath2638",
    "with @xmath2639 smooth , there exists a small neighborhood @xmath2640 of @xmath2641 inside @xmath2642 with @xmath2643 and @xmath2644 .",
    "we can trivialize @xmath2645 by identifying @xmath2646 with @xmath2647 for any @xmath2648 via the exponential map .",
    "more precisely , we define @xmath2649 @xmath2650 where @xmath2651 , @xmath2652 , @xmath2653 @xmath2654 is the parallel transport along the path @xmath2655 , and @xmath2656 is the projection with respect to @xmath686",
    ".    let @xmath2657 be the section of @xmath2658 with @xmath2659 where @xmath241 are viewed as coordinates of @xmath345 via @xmath2660 as usual .",
    "we show that @xmath2657 is a @xmath522-section of @xmath2661 . in the next several paragraphs",
    "we calculate the derivative @xmath2662 .      until the end of the appendix , @xmath473 means @xmath473 with domain @xmath2603 .",
    "we claim that @xmath2670 .",

    "let @xmath2685 be a smooth path in @xmath559 with @xmath2686 and @xmath2687 .",
    "then @xmath2688 since @xmath2634 depends smoothly on @xmath494 , we have @xmath2689 .",
    "again we write @xmath2626 as @xmath2677 and obtain @xmath2690 by lemma [ s_+c1 ] , @xmath2691 .",
    "hence @xmath2692 .",
    "we now bound the @xmath473-norm of each term in equations   and :      here @xmath2697 is a positive continuous function of @xmath2698 and @xmath200 is a smooth cutoff function which equals one on @xmath2699 for some @xmath1264 and has compact support on @xmath2603 .",
    "hence @xmath2700 which implies that @xmath2657 is a differentiable section of @xmath2701 .",
    "almost the same calculation shows that @xmath2657 is in @xmath522 .",
    "let @xmath2702 be the injectivity radius map , i.e , @xmath2703 maps @xmath2704 to the injectivity radius @xmath2705 with respect to @xmath686 .",
