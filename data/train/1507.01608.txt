    "\\(ii ) in this paper we focused on the total phase - space multiplicity distributions .",
    "it is plausible that , as assumed in this letter , the total number of particles is determined ( mostly ) by the amount of available energy .",
    "this is not obvious for limited phase - space bins since the distribution of particles in transverse momentum or rapidity may be modified by some nontrivial dynamics .",
    "this problem is under investigation .",

    "( [ f_x ] ) .",
    "this form is partly supported by existing data , however at rather limited energies and ranges of @xmath27 .",
    "thus it should be considered more as an educated guess .",
    "in addition , we assumed that @xmath30 is energy independent , which is not proven experimentally .",
    "a mild energy dependence is indicated by theoretical studies of batista:1998ry .",
    "\\(iv ) as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : nbd ] the nb fits overestimate calculated multiplicity distributions for higher values of @xmath71 .",

    "@xmath72 in ref .",
    "grosseoetringhaus:2009kz and figs .",
    "@xmath73 in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "\\(v ) in this paper we extrapolate @xmath74 into higher energies using 3nlo qcd result @xcite , which is almost identical to nlo qcd fit and eq . ( [ n_ee ] ) . for @xmath75",
    "we assume it is a linear function of @xmath76 up to the lhc energies .",
    "\\(vi ) it would be interesting to extend our study on different colliding systems including proton - nucleus and nucleus - nucleus collisions akindinov:2007rr .",
    "in conclusion , we argued that the multiplicity distribution in @xmath0 collisions is directly related to the multiplicity distribution in @xmath70 interactions , once the leading proton effect in @xmath0 is properly accounted . in @xmath0",
    "a large fraction of initial energy , roughly @xmath77 on average , is carried away by two leading protons and is not available for particle production .",
    "this component fluctuates from event to event , which results in a broader multiplicity distribution in @xmath0 than in @xmath1 .",
