    "energetic stellar explosions such as novae and supernovae provide us with the opportunity to study the physics of rapidly expanding gas shells . due to the rapid response of observers and the density of observational coverage in time , the classical nova cygni 92 ( v1974 cygni ) @xcite is the best observed nova in history .",
    "the existence of a frequent , well spaced set of low and high resolution international ultraviolet explorer ( iue ) spectra allow us to model the time development of the expanding gas shell in a spectral region where the object emits most of its flux during the fireball and optically thick wind phases of the explosion .",
    "the gradual emergence of flux in this region , caused by the lifting of heavy line blanketing ( `` the iron curtain '' ( @xcite , @xcite ) , determines the shape of the early uv light curve , and is a particularly dramatic example of how these explosions serve as laboratories for the study of a radiating plasma under changing conditions .",
    "[ [ section ] ]    among stellar atmospheric modeling problems , that of novae is especially complicated due to the steepness of the @xmath1 and @xmath2 gradients , the large depth of translucency , the sphericity , and the significance of first order special relativistic effects in the transfer of radiation .",
    "the first two of these conditions cause the line forming region ( lfr ) to span a wide range of physical conditions so that many overlapping line and continuum transitions of many ionization stages of many elements are simultaneously present in the emergent spectrum .",
    "the second condition ensures that many species in the lfr will deviate significantly from local thermodynamic equilibrium ( lte ) @xcite . as a result ,",
    "the accurate modeling of data such as that obtained for cygni 92 requires a very general treatment that incorporates non - lte ( nlte ) effects as accurately and completely as possible .",
    "the multi - purpose atmospheric modeling code phoenix @xcite was developed to model , among other things , nova and supernova explosions .",
    "phoenix makes use of a fast and accurate operator splitting / accelerated lambda iteration ( os / ali ) scheme to solve self - consistently the first order special relativistic radiative transfer equation and the nlte rate equations for many species and overlapping transitions @xcite .",
    "cygni 92 was first modeled with phoenix by @xcite . however , recently @xcite have greatly increased the number of species and ionization stages treated in detailed nlte by phoenix .",
    "the lowest six ionization stages of the 19 most important elements are now treated in nlte .",
    "the purpose of this study is to calculate a set of improved nova models and synthetic spectra with the expanded version of phoenix , to compare them to the iue time series spectra of cygni 92 , and to extract stellar parameters at each observed time .",
    "table 1 is a log of the observations that we have extracted from the iue archive for both the low and high resolution spectrographs and for both the long and short wavelength cameras ( lwp and swp ) .",
    "superscripts in table 1 indicate approximately coincident pairs of swp and lwp spectra . the spectra span a range of 144.75 days , from the initial fireball stage of the explosion , through the optically thick wind phase , to the nebular stage .",
    "[ surf_lo ] shows the fourteen pairs of approximately coincident swp and lwp spectra as a function of time .",
    "we have discarded the portion of the swp spectrum that lies below @xmath3    due to the noisiness of the signal and contamination by geocoronal lyman @xmath4 , and the portion of the lwp spectrum that lies below @xmath5 due to severe degradation of the signal .",
    "the gap in the @xmath6 dimension arises because the reduced swp and lwp spectra are disjoint in @xmath6 .",

    "we have calculated a set of atmospheric models that span a @xmath14 range of 12 to 30 kk in increments of 1 kk .",

    "abundance analyses of nova ejecta find them to have abundances of cno and fe that are enhanced with respect to the solar values ( see , for example , @xcite , or @xcite ) .",
    "the enhanced metal abundance is thought to be caused by mixing of the ejected material with the metal rich white dwarf ( wd ) material prior to the outburst , and by h burning during the thermonuclear runaway ( tnr ) that drives a nova explosion .",

    "[ [ section-3 ] ]    table 2 shows all the species that are treatable in nlte with phoenix and indicates which ones have been included in the nlte rate equations for each value of @xmath14 in the model grid .",
    "because ionization stages that are important for some values of @xmath14 in the grid are unimportant for others , the species that are included in nlte varies throughout the grid .",
    "in particular , the lowest ionization stages of some species that are included in the coolest models are excluded in hotter models , and higher ionization stages that are included in the hottest models are excluded in the cooler models . in practice , test calculations with the full suite of nlte species were performed at a sparse sub - grid of models , and ionization stages that contribute less than @xmath33 of the total population of the species at all depths were treated in lte for nearby models in the complete grid .",
    "[ surf_syn ] shows the synthetic spectra in the iue wavelength range that were computed with the grid of models .",
    "the spectra were computed with a sampling , @xmath34 , of 0.03    so that all spectral lines are well sampled , and then were degraded to the resolution of the iue low resolution grating .",
    "the physical interpretation of the early photometric and spectroscopic time development of a nova in the uv is well summarized by @xcite . from fig .",
    "[ surf_syn ] we see that as the @xmath14 of the model increases , the synthetic spectral energy distribution hardens .",

    "subsequently , we see the thicker , more extended secondary ejection that forms an expanding photosphere around the wd . during this optically thick wind phase",
    ", @xmath14 gradually increases as @xmath2 declines and the expanding atmosphere becomes increasingly less self - shielded from the central wd . at the same time , the declining @xmath2 also causes the photospheric radius ( @xmath35 ) to decrease so that deeper , hotter layers are progressively exposed . as a result , the peak of the emitted flux moves to progressively shorter @xmath6 , as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ lcurv ] . during this stage",
    "the nova evolves at constant @xmath26 because the expanding atmosphere re - processes the energy emitted by the underlying wd , which is still burning h on its surface , and does not contain any energy sources of its own .",
    "the evolution of the uv spectrum during the optically thick wind phase can also be understood by considering the line blanketing . near the beginning of the optically thick wind phase ,",
    "the temperature of the atmosphere is such that fe is mostly in the form of and , both of which have a very rich absorption spectrum in the uv . as a result",
    ", the uv flux is blocked by massive line absorption ( the `` iron curtain '' ) .",
    "as the gas expands it thins and becomes increasingly radiatively heated by the central engine until it gradually takes on a more nebular character and becomes multiply ionized again . as a result , the uv opacity decreases and the uv flux increases and reaches a plateau about 50 days after the explosion . some time after 150 days",
    ", the atmosphere expands to the point where the total optical depth through the atmosphere is less than unity and the continuum flux disappears .",

    "[ [ section-5 ] ]    because the iue @xmath6 range is close to the peak of the spectral energy distribution , @xmath47 , for this @xmath14 range , we have approximated the time development of @xmath14 , @xmath48 , by setting it equal to @xmath41 .",

    "as discussed above , the value of @xmath49 decreases throughout the optically thick wind phase because , although the atmosphere is expanding , the physical radius at which is becomes optically thick ( the photosphere ) is contracting as the gas becomes thinner .",
