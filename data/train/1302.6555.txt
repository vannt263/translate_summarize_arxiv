    "it is generally recognized that quantum annealing ( qa ) algorithms can find applications for solving many practically important problems including optimization of complex networks , finding the global minimum of multi - valued functions , and cost minimization . instead of classical annealing algorithm in which the temperature effects are utilized , the qa can operate , in principle , at zero temperature . in this case ,",
    "one first formulates the optimization problem in terms of finding the ground state of the effective quantum hermitian hamiltonian , @xmath3 , which describes a quantum time - evolution of a quantum register with @xmath4 qubits . during the slow and directed time - evolution , the quantum system tunnels to the global ground state of this effective hamiltonian .",
    "one of the main challenges is to accelerate the speed of qa algorithms , so that the annealing time grows not exponentially , but polynomially with the size of the quantum register @xcite .",
    "many approaches dealing with finding the ground state of the hamiltonian , @xmath3 , using qa algorithms , can be found in @xcite ( see also references therein ) .",
    "to illustrate the idea of qa algorithms , consider the time - dependent hamiltonian , @xmath5 , where @xmath3 is the hamiltonian to be optimized and @xmath6 is an auxiliary (  initial \" ) hamiltonian . in order to initiate a non - trivial quantum dynamics of a register , the condition , @xmath7 \\neq 0 $ ] , is imposed .",
    "the external time - dependent field , @xmath8 , decreases from a large enough value to zero during the quantum annealing .",
    "the ground state of @xmath6 is the initial state , which is assumed to be known .",
    "then , the adiabatic theorem guarantees that if @xmath8 decreases sufficiently slow , the system approaches the ground state of @xmath3 , at the end of the quantum annealing .",
    "one of the requirements of the adiabatic theorem is the existence of a finite gap between instantaneous ground state and first excited state of the total hamiltonian , @xmath9 .",
    "however , usually in quantum optimization of @xmath4-qubit models the minimal energy gap becomes exponentially small , producing an exponential increase of the annealing time @xcite .",
    "then , the main problem is on how to speed up the performance of the qa algorithms and , at the same time , find the ground state of @xmath3 .    in @xcite , we proposed an adiabatic quantum optimization algorithm based on non - hermitian quantum mechanics .",
    "our approach demonstrated that when using the non - hermitian term , @xmath6 , an effective level repulsion takes place for the total hamiltonian , greatly increasing the minimum energy gap .    in @xcite , we applied this non - hermitian quantum annealing ( nqa ) algorithm to grover s problem of finding a marked item in an unsorted database , and to study the transition to the ground state in a 1-dimensional ferromagnetic ising chain .",
    "we demonstrated that , for a suitable choice of relaxation and other parameters , the search time is proportional to the logarithm of the number of qubits ( spins ) .    in this paper , we apply our previously developed nqa to study the transitional dynamics to the ground state of @xmath3 in a 1-dimensional antiferromagnetic ising spin chain in a time - dependent transverse magnetic field .",
    "we also assume that the dissipation vanishes at the end of evolution . when the annealing is completed , the system is governed by the hermitian hamiltonian , @xmath3 .",
    "the main reason for choosing the antiferromagnetic ising spin chain is that the ground state in this model is much more complicated than in the corresponding ferromagnetic chain .",
    "namely , it includes rapid spatial oscillations ( correlations ) of spins .",
    "this allows us to demonstrate that our ( nqa ) algorithm works well for this case , and significantly decreases the annealing time .",
    "another reason is to consider the behavior of quantum correlation functions ( which are more complicated than in the ferromagnetic chain ) and formation of defects generated in the process of annealing .",
    "we show that the nqa significantly increases the probability for the system to remain in the ground state .",
    "in particular , a comparison with the results of the hermitian qa reveals that the nqa reaches the ground state of @xmath3 with much larger probability , when we use the same annealing scheme for both .",
    "we show that the nqa has a complexity of order @xmath1 , where @xmath4 is the number of spins .",
    "this is much better than the quantum hermitian adiabatic algorithm which has the complexity for this problem of order @xmath2 .",

    "many schemes and approaches of quantum annealing algorithms have been proposed @xcite ( see also references therein ) .",

    "is related to item ( i ) above , and was applied for the one - dimensional antiferromagnetic spin chain .",
    "we have chosen an auxiliary hamiltonian in such a way that the total hamiltonian is non - hermitian .",

    "this is much less than the time of hermitian annealing ( @xmath150 ) for the same problem .",
    "we also demonstrated the behavior of quantum correlation functions and their relation to the spin defects generated during quantum annealing .",
    "it is interesting to mention here , that similar to the ferromagnetic chain , the main contribution to the destruction of the final ground state in the process of quantum annealing is produced by the long - wavelength modes , as expected .",
    "this is in spite of the fact that in the antiferromagnetic chain the ground state represents a rapidly - oscillating spatial structure with short wavelengths ( opposite to the ferromagnetic chain ) .",
    "the dissipative term which we use corresponds to tunneling of the system to its own continuum , as usually happens when one applies the feshbach projection method to intrinsic states in nuclear physics and quantum optics . in our case ,",
    "the intrinsic states are the states of the quantum computer ( register ) .",
    "so , the probability of our quantum computer to survive during the nqa can be small .",
    "that is why we use a ratio of two probabilities  the ratio of the probability for the system to remain in the ground state to the probability of survival of the quantum computer .",
    "this relative probability ( we call it `` intrinsic '' probability ) is well - defined , and remains finite during the nqa .",
    "so , our approach can not be directly used in the experiments on qa , but rather as a combination of classical computer and protocols for nqa to significantly decrease the time of annealing .",
    "also , the dissipative term which we use in this paper is rather artificial in the sense that it has no direct relation to physical dissipative mechanisms . at the same time",
    ", we note that our dissipation term corresponds , in principal , to tunneling effects in the superconducting phase qubits if tunneling is realized mostly from the lowest energy levels .",
    "our hope is that the observed reduction of the annealing time can serve as a guide to finding solutions of the np - complete problems by using a combination of classical computers and nqa algorithms .",
    "we also would like to mention that many important problems still remain to be considered .",
    "one of them is the application of this dissipative approach to more complicated ising models with frustrated interactions , in which the ground state can be strongly inhomogeneous .",
