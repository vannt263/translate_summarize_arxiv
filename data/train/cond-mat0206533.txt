    "ever since it s introduction iterated prisoners dilemma games has been central in understanding the conditions for cooperation among populations of selfish individuals .",
    "@xcite applications has ranged from rna virus interactions  @xcite to westernization in central africa  @xcite , and consequently a variety of generalizations has been studied .",
    "the present work takes the spatial prisoners dilemma of nowak _ et al . _",
    "@xcite as its starting - point .",
    "@xcite here the players are situated on a two - dimensional lattice , interacting only with their neighbors . rather than examining the stability of strategies",
    "based on memory of the opponent s behavior , as in the ordinary iterated prisoners dilemma , the spatial prisoners dilemma serves to answer questions such as under what conditions cooperation can be stable in ( social ) space .",
    "@xcite following refs .",
    "@xcite the interactions can be chosen as simple as follows : the payoff is simultaneously calculated for every node ( player ) .",
    "the contribution to the gain from an encounter is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : network](a ) ; the sum of the encounters from each neighbor gives the gain for a certain node . in the next move",
    "each node follows the most successful neighbor .",
    "( this is a feature of successful strategies such as tit - for - tat  @xcite or win - stay lose - shift  @xcite of the two - player prisoners dilemma . )",
    "defined in this way , the dynamics may e.g.reflect that of groups of individuals with mutual trust and cooperation interacting with social regions of unrest . to add the element of occasional irrational moves by individuals , and",
    "get a way from a purely deterministic dynamics , one can allow for ` mutations ' : a random strategy ( d or c is chosen randomly ) is assigned to a player with probability @xmath0 .",
    "important features of social networks such as high clustering and short characteristic path - length can be modeled by the watts and strogatz ( ws ) model  @xcite , where the links of a regular network are randomly rewired to introduce long - range `` short - cuts '' . on a one - dimensional small - world network",
    "the presence of long - range connections has been found to increase the density of defectors  @xcite . to get closer to the original work by nowak _",
    "_ we start from a two - dimensional ws model network . in society , massmedial persons may influence others much stronger than the average individual , still these influential persons are coupled back to their social surroundings .",
    "one concrete example along this general line is smoking among adolescents , a behavior spurred by both the individual s social surroundings and role models of the media .",
    "@xcite to model this situation we let one node have additional directed links randomly distributed outwards to the rest of the network . in this way we hope to catch some general effects that such an influential node might have on the dynamical behavior of a social network .",
    "the starting point is a @xmath1 square grid ( with periodic boundary conditions ) where each node has eight neighbors reachable by a chess king s move .",
    "long range bidirectional links are added with a probability @xmath2 making the average number of short - cuts @xmath3 ( @xmath4 ) .",
    "one node is randomly chosen as the influential node and in addition to its local bidirectional connections , this node is unidirectionally connected to arbitrary nodes of the network with a probability @xmath5 .",
    "these additional links are directed so that nodes unidirectionally connected to the special node sees the special node as one of its neighbors , but not vice versa .",
    "the influential node only gets feedback from its local mutual connections .",
    "( see fig .",
    "[ fig : network](b ) . )    in our simulations we use a typical lattice size is @xmath6 , with the number of additional directed connections to the influential node given by @xmath7 with @xmath5 typically 0.2 , the mutation rate @xmath0 typically 0.001 , the shortcut density @xmath2 from 0 to 0.1 , and @xmath8 network realizations .",
    "the gain of the certain node ( in our version of prisoners dilemma game ) is calculated as the average score of the individual encounters : the sum of the encounters from each neighbor is divided by the number of the neighbors .",
    "this normalization is done to avoid an additional bias from the higher degree of some nodes , and thus keep the game closer nowak and may s original spatial prisoners dilemma game .",
    "in order to analyze the dynamics of this model we start by calculating the average density of cooperators @xmath9 as a function of the pay - off @xmath10 between defector d and cooperator c ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : network](a ) ) . as seen in fig .",
    "[ steps ] @xmath9 has a step structure .",
    "these steps reflect the interplay between the underlying spatial structure and the pd dynamics  @xcite : each level is characterized by the condition that @xmath11 c s wins over @xmath12 d s and consequently the step condition given by @xmath13 and the sequence of steps discernible in fig .",
    "[ steps ] is 7/8 , 1 , 8/7 , 7/6 , 6/5 , 5/4 , 4/3 , 7/5 , 3/2 , 8/5 corresponding to the case when @xmath14 and the additional steps at 8/9 , 9/8 due to the additional coupling for nodes attached to the influential node .",
    "for @xmath15 there is no cooperation left and @xmath16 and for @xmath17 cooperation wins and @xmath18 .    in the following",
    "we will focus on @xmath19 which is associated with a plateau in the middle with @xmath20 .",
    "[ fig : time](a ) shows the time evolution for @xmath19 and @xmath14 i.e.  the case when there is no influential node . in this case",
    "the level of cooperation remains stable with relatively small fluctuations around the average value .",
    "this feature is dramatically changed when we introduce the special influential node as shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : time](b ) for @xmath21 .",
    "the equilibrium is now punctuated by sudden drops of cooperation . in fig .",
    "[ fig : reltime ] we display the average drop ( obtained by averaging over about thousand sudden drops ) .",
    "the typical feature is a very dramatic sudden jump followed by a slower recovering back to the steady state situation .",
    "this recovery back to steady state is exponential as demonstrated in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : reltime ] .    as a first step",
    "we investigate what exactly triggers the sudden drop of cooperation : the basic mechanisms is that a situation arises where the influential node as a defector gets a very high score .",
    "the successful defector strategy of the influential node is then rapidly spread through the directed links from this node i.e.  the sudden drop in cooperation is triggered by an imitation of a successful selfish behavior of the influential node .",
    "figure  [ fig : evol ] shows a typical example of how the triggering high score situation is built up in the environment of the influential node .",
    "the figure shows four consecutive time steps for the same run as in fig .",
    "[ fig : time ] . in the second timestep ( fig .",
    "[ fig : evol](b ) ) the influential node is surrounded by seven cooperators and hence gets the high score @xmath22 .",
    "this high score causes an instability since it causes the defector strategy to be imitated both by the immediate surrounding and by the rest of the network through the directed links from the influential nodes ( fig .",
    "[ fig : evol](c ) ) . in the next step ( fig .",
    "[ fig : evol](d ) ) the defector strategy spreads to the nodes in the vicinity of the nodes connected to the influential node .",
    "how often does such a breakdown occur ?",
    "figure  [ wtdistr_p0 ] shows the average probability distribution for the waiting time between two breakdowns . the waiting time distribution @xmath23 is clearly exponential for large @xmath24 .",
    "in addition it has some structure as discussed below .    in order to gain some further insight",
    "we investigate how the recovery time and waiting time depends on the parameters of the model .",
    "the waiting time distribution does not change qualitatively when a rewiring probability is introduced .",
    "the only change is a small quantitative decrease in the average recovery time .",
    "this is in accord with the intuitive idea that more long range connection will in general speed up the time evolution . in our particular model",
    "it means that the triggering type situation ( shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : evol](b ) ) will arise more frequently when long range connections are present .",
    "the structure of the waiting time distribution consists to good approximation of two exponential decays as shown in in fig .  [ wtdistr_p0 ] ( a ) .",
    "this structure of the waiting time distribution is caused by an interplay between the spatial lattice and the pd pay - off .",
    "figure  [ wtdistr_p0](b ) shows how the recovery time @xmath25 depends on the rewiring probability @xmath2 .",
    "the striking thing here is that for @xmath19 and @xmath26 the recovery time increases with increasing @xmath2 so that actually more connections between different parts of the network will slow down the recovery .",
    "however for @xmath27 and @xmath28 the recovery time instead decreases with increasing @xmath2 as also shown in fig .",
    "[ wtdistr_p0](b ) consequently the change in the recovery time with @xmath2 depends on the relative proportion of defectors and collaborators in the steady state situation : if the cooperator density is large enough then an additional short - cut will more often connect a defector to a cooperator which promotes the defector strategy and slows down the recovery .",
    "if the cooperator density is smaller the situation changes and an increase in the number of long range connections will speed up the recovery towards the steady state level .",
    "it is interesting to note that an increase of the recovery time with increasing @xmath2 is somewhat contrary to the intuitive idea that more connections will speed up the time evolution .",
    "the dependence on the mutation probability @xmath0 is more trivial : the only effect that the mutation probability seems to have is to speed up the time evolution .",
    "this means that , in the limit of small @xmath0 , the recovery time @xmath25 and the waiting time distribution @xmath29 approaches finite values . at @xmath30",
    "this limit is basically reached for our lattice size @xmath6 .",
    "the only effect of a finite @xmath0 in this limit is to prevent the system from getting stuck in a purely deterministic cycle .",
    "finally we investigate the case when the influential node is always defecting .",
    "this corresponds to the case when an influential person does not take any feedback from the environment nor does make any spontaneous change in its strategy .",
    "this does in fact not change any qualitative features in the behavior of our model .",
    "we have investigated the spatial prisoners dilemma game for the case with one influential node .",
    "the most striking feature of this model is the existence of sudden breakdowns of cooperation .",
    "@xcite this is caused by imitation of a successful scoring by the defector strategy of the influential node .",
    "these breakdowns are associated with two distinct time scales .",
    "one time scale is the recovery time @xmath25 associated with the recovery back to the steady state cooperation level after a sudden breakdown .",
    "the most interesting feature with this recovery is that it sometimes becomes slower with increasing small world rewiring .",
    "thus , contrary to the intuitive feeling that more connections should just speed up the evolution , it is also possible that the long range connections instead slows down the time it takes to get back to the equilibrium level .",
    "this slowing down of the recovery occurs when the steady state cooperation level is large enough .",
    "if the equilibrium cooperation level is small enough then the recovery time gets shorter with an increasing number of long range connections .",
    "the second characteristic time is the time between the sudden breakdowns of cooperation .",
    "it is associated with how often in the steady state situation an event when the influential node scores highly with the defecting strategy occurs .",
    "this may happen very rarely but when it happens the tendency of the social network to imitate the influential node causes a dramatic breakdown of the cooperation level .",
    "the model also contains a random mutation rate .",
    "however this only speeds up the evolution without changing the qualitative behavior .",
    "our model gives a crude simulation of real social behavior .",
    "however , it does catch a few features of potential interest .",
    "one feature is the instability which an imitating behavior can lead to in the presence of an influential node be it a charismatic leader , a popular media person or some such thing .",
    "the other is that the restoration of equilibrium can sometimes be obstructed by the presence of long range social connections .",
    "one may note that although the present model of asymmetric influence is quite different in mechanism and spirit from the recent model by riolo , cohen and axelrod  @xcite both display dynamic instabilities in the cooperation level .",
