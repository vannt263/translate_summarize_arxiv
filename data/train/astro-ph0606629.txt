    "the origin of the knee in the cosmic - ray spectrum in the form of a spectral - index break in the power - law all - particle spectrum by @xmath8 units at @xmath9 , accompanied by a change in the cosmic - ray composition , seems to suggest a new contribution to cosmic rays at these energies .",
    "grbs have been proposed as effective accelerators of cosmic rays in the universe @xcite and as probable sources of cosmic rays up to ultra - high energies in our galaxy @xcite .",
    "cosmic rays with energies below @xmath4 tev are produced in the conventional scenario of continuous injection due to nonrelativistic shock acceleration by snrs formed in all types of sne , with subsequent modification of the source spectrum through energy - dependent propagation ( see @xcite ) .",

    "our best opportunity to establish cosmic - ray acceleration in grb blast waves is by looking for hadronic emission signatures in the spectra of grbs , or characteristic signatures from remnants of past grbs .",
    "conclusive evidence for cosmic - ray acceleration in grbs will come from the detection of high - energy neutrinos .    in the relativistic blast - wave model for grbs , photohadronic production is the most important mechanism for producing high - energy neutrinos . in section 2 , the photohadron process is described and an approximation used for computing the spectra of secondaries formed in photohadronic processes , which is also useful for analytical studies , is given .",

    "if high - energy hadrons are accelerated by grb blast waves , then photohadronic processes , which require the presence of target photons , are the most important hadronic energy - loss mechanisms .",
    "the target photon field is simply the highly variable radiation formed in the grb blast wave that is detected as the grb .",
    "secondary nuclear production , by contrast , requires a large target particle density that would make the grb energetics untenable @xcite .",
    "the most important photohadronic process for hadronic energy losses in grb blast waves is the photopion reaction , which can be written as @xmath12 , where @xmath13 stands for a proton or neutron .",
    "another important photohadronic process is photopair production , which can be written as @xmath14 .",
    "a large fraction of the initial proton energy is lost in a photopion reaction , so only a few scatterings are required for the proton to lose most of its initial energy . by contrast , only a small fraction of the initial proton energy is lost in photopair production , so hundreds of scatterings are needed for a proton to lose most of its initial energy through this process . although the photopair reaction is not so important for hadronic energy losses in grb blast waves , it can play an important role in the evolution of the uhecr spectrum throughout intergalactic space @xcite .",

    "moreover , the conclusions of @xcite rest on only four grbs with anomalously low beaming - corrected energies , which may simply indicate that underluminous grbs have a tendency to be born in low metallicity environments .",
    "evidence for local grbs can be established by identifying remnants of grb in the milky way @xcite .",
    "the identification of a @xmath179 old grb remnant ( grbr ) that happened at a @xmath180 from us , which explains @xcite the origin of the knee(s ) in the cr spectrum , is virtually impossible by now .",
    "however , there are other hopes to distinguish the radiation characteristics of the galactic grbrs from the radiation from the remnants of  ordinary \" ( nonrelativistic ) supernovae in the galaxy .    the hess ( high energy stereoscopic system ) collaboration has recently discovered a population consisting of several @xmath0-ray sources in the galactic plane @xcite , which are spatially extended  up to tens of arcmin  and tev - bright , but are quiet in all other frequency bands and remain unidentified .",
    "the suppressed level of low - frequency synchrotron flux from tev - bright sources is very unexpected for conventional snrs .",
    "it is proposed in ref . @xcite through detailed calculations of particle diffusion and radiation processes and modeling of the spatial and spectral energy fluxes detected , that at least one of these sources , hess j1303 - 631 @xcite , can be explained as a @xmath181 - 20 kyr old grbr at a distance @xmath181 - 15 kpc from us .",
    "the hadronic origin of the detected tev flux , implied by the non - detectable synchrotron flux , requires @xmath182 ergs energy in relativistic protons with @xmath183 .",
    "furthermore , it is qualitatively argued @xcite that the suppressed level of synchrotron flux could be the specific signature of the grbrs . unlike in the process of diffusive fermi - type acceleration by nonrelativistic shocks for normal snrs , the bulk kinetic energy of the relativistic shocks is converted to relativistic particles ( mostly to protons rather than to electrons , because of the large difference in the rest masses ) at the very early stages while the shock is relativistic .",
    "this can explain the large baryon load in the grbs .",
    "even at the early non - relativistic stage of evolution of the grbr , the magnetic fields ( @xmath184 ) are still high and can quickly remove the relativistic leptons from the pool of accelerated particles .",
    "the most important observational feature predicted in @xcite for the grbrs , in contrast to snrs , is the very hard spectrum of @xmath0 rays below 100 gev energies . a weak detection , confirming the hard spectrum , or non - detection by glast of hess j1303 - 631 would therefore signify detection of the signatures of proton acceleration by relativistic shocks of a grb .",
    "confirmation of hess j1303 - 631 and perhaps some other extended unidentified tev source as grbrs would confirm the high rate , of order @xmath185 , of local grbs .",
    "these questions are important for determining whether grbs have had an impact upon the evolution of life at earth @xcite , as described in a related contribution to this focus issue @xcite .",
    "the possibility that grbs accelerate relativistic hadrons could solve the problem of the origin of the high - energy cosmic rays .",
    "there are several ways to establish whether grbs accelerate cosmic rays , from : high - energy neutrino detection from grbs ; anomalous radiation signatures associated with hadronic acceleration and energy losses in grb blast waves ; radiations made by neutrons that escape from the blast wave ; and evidence for cosmic - ray production from grb remnants in our own and nearby galaxies .    in the case of neutrino and @xmath0-ray production , at most",
    "only a few high - energy @xmath69 can be detected with km - scale neutrino detectors even from bright grbs at the fluence level @xmath186 , and only when the baryon loading is high @xcite .",
    "this is because the detection of a single @xmath69 requires a @xmath69 fluence @xmath187 above 1 tev .",
    "since the energy release in high - energy neutrinos and electromagnetic secondaries is about equal , this energy will be reprocessed in the pair - photon cascade and emerge in the form of observable radiation at @xmath0-ray energies , and this radiation can not exceed the measured fluence in this regime .",
    "detection of high - energy neutrinos and hadronic @xmath0-ray emission components from grbs will mean that grbs have a large load in relativistic baryons , which is required for uhecr production .",
    "the advent of the icecube neutrino telescope at the south pole and the launch of glast in late 2007 will provide the important instruments to establish whether grbs accelerate ultra - relativistic hadrons . in the meantime , searches for grb remnants at other wavelengths will indicate the importance of grbs in the local universes . with these developments , the longstanding puzzle of the origin of the cosmic rays  now nearly 100 years since their discovery  should finally be answered .    0.2 in we thank a.  reimer for permission to reproduce fig .  1 from ref",
