    "the detection of high redshift objects has been , and is , one of the main challenges for cosmology .",
    "quasars have been since their discoveries the beacons of the universe . indeed during the last few years the sdss survey started to probe , using high-@xmath6 quasars , the universe till near the re - ionization epoch ( fan 2006 ) .",
    "long gamma ray bursts ( grb ) may constitute a complementary way to study the cosmos and the early evolution of stars avoiding the proximity effects and possibly probing even larger redshifts up to @xmath7 .",
    "the five grbs detected at @xmath8 , over a sample of about 200 objects observed with the _ swift _ satellite ( gehrels et al . 2004 ) , show that a large percentage of grbs is detected at high-@xmath6 .",
    "the current record is @xmath9 ( tagliaferri et al .",
    "2005 , kawai et al , 2006 ) .",
    "one of the goals of the swift mission is the detection of high-@xmath6 grbs to estimate at what cosmological epoch they exist and , in case they are bright , to use them as beacons of the universe . to achieve this we need to fine tune the bat instrument decreasing the trigger threshold",
    "moreover , due to the high competition for time on large ground based telescopes , we need to preselect the best candidates soon after their detection .",
    "the following analysis is based on the assumption that grbs form preferentially in low ",
    "metallicity galaxies .",
    "the model fits well both the batse and _ swift _ grb differential peak flux distribution and is consistent with the number of _ swift _ identifications at @xmath1 and @xmath10 in the 2years _ swift _ data ( salvaterra & chincarini 2007 ; thereafter sc07 ) . in this letter",
    ", we compute the probability to detect a burst at very high redshift with _ swift _ and",
    "we compare model results with the small number of confirmed detection of grbs at @xmath8 .",
    "finally , we propose to use model results as a tool to identify @xmath8 candidates . by jointly considering theoretical predictions and promptly ",

    "swift _ , we can select reliable targets in a few hours from bat detection .",
    "we test our selection procedure against last year of _ swift _ data , showing that the method is quite efficient .",
    "we propose to use it for real time selection of high redshift bursts and for dedicated follow  up searches of grb host galaxies at @xmath0 .",
    "sc07 have computed the luminosity function ( lf ) and the formation rate of long grbs by fitting the observed batse differential peak flux number counts in three different scenarios : i ) grbs follow the cosmic star formation and have a redshift  independent lf ; ii ) the grb lf varies with redshift ; iii ) grbs are associated with star formation in low  metallicity environments . in all cases , it is possible to obtain a good fit to the data by adjusting the model free parameters . using the same lf and formation rate , the models reproduce both batse and _ swift _ differential counts , showing that the two satellites are observing the same grb population .",
    "finally , sc07 have tested the burst redshift distribution obtained in the different scenarios against the number of _ swift _ detections at @xmath1 and @xmath10 .",
    "this procedure allows to constrain model results without any assumption on the redshift distribution of bursts that lack redshift determination and on the effect of selection biases ( see fiore et al .",
    "2007 for a detailed discussion about this important issue ) .",
    "models where grbs trace the star formation rate ( sfr ) and are described by a constant lf are robustly rule out by available data .",
    "_ swift _ high@xmath6 detection can be explained assuming that the lf is evolving in redshift . in particular",
    ", sc07 found that the typical grb luminosity should increases with @xmath11 with @xmath12 .",
    "alternatively , the large number of high@xmath6 identifications may indicate that grbs are biased tracer of the star formation , forming preferentially in low  metallicity environment . assuming that the lf does not evolve in redshift , the number of high@xmath6 burst identifications imply a metallicity threshold for grbs formation lower than @xmath13 ( sc07 ) , consistently with the predictions of collapsar models ( macfadyen & woosley 1999 ; izzard , ramirez  ruiz & tout 2004 ) .",
    "available studies of grb host galaxies ( sollerman et al .",
    "2005 , stanek et al .",
    "2005 , fynbo et al .",
    "2006b ) seem to confirm this metallicity bias .",
    "the large majority of host galaxies has @xmath14 although two bursts are detected in galaxies with higher metallicity .",
    "we want to note here that many absorption lines detected in optical spectroscopy are possibly not probing the nearby grb environment ( jakobsson et al .",
    "2006b , delia et al .",
    "2007 , watson et al .",
    "2007 , prochaska et al .",
    "2007 , vreeswijk et al . 2007 ) .",
    "so , any conclusion about the metallicity of the grb progenitors inferred by these studies should be taken with some caution .",
    "we limit our analysis here to models in which grbs form preferentially in low  metallicity environments and are described by a constant lf , but similar results can be obtained assuming evolution in the lf .",
    "the grb formation rate is then given by    @xmath15    where @xmath16 is the grb formation efficiency , @xmath17 gives the fraction of galaxies at redshift @xmath6 with metallicity below @xmath18 ( langer & norman 2006 ) and @xmath19 is the observed star formation rate .",
    "we adopt the recent determination of the global star formation rate obtained by hopkins & beacom ( 2006 ) , slightly modified in order to match the decline with @xmath20 at @xmath0 , as suggested by recent deep  field data ( see stark et al . 2007 and references therein ) . in the following",
    "we explore a wide range of model with @xmath21 , computing the expected probability to detect a grb at @xmath0 with _",
    "swift_. for all the details of the model computation we refer the interested reader to sc07 .",
    "we compute the probability for a grb of observed peak photon flux @xmath22 in the 15150 kev band of _ swift_/bat to be at @xmath0 as the ratio between the expected number of grbs at @xmath0 and the total number of bursts detectable at peak photon flux @xmath22 .",

    "the probability to find a burst at @xmath0 increases rapidly with decreasing @xmath22 and becomes larger than 10% for @xmath2 ph s@xmath3 @xmath4 .",
    "indeed , four out of five bursts confirmed to be at @xmath8 have photon fluxes in the range 0.60.8 ph s@xmath3 @xmath4 .",

    "swift _ detections at @xmath8 in the corresponding flux bin .",
    "we find that the model with @xmath23 is consistent with _ swift",
    "_ lower limits .",
    "models with higher metallicity thresholds tend to underestimate the number of detections at @xmath8 . assuming a threshold metallicity of @xmath13 , the computed probability falls well below available limits . in order to be consistent with observational constraint",
    ", we have to assume some evolution in the lf . assuming that grb luminosity increases linearly with redshift , the result of the @xmath24 model is similar to what obtained with @xmath23 .",
    "thus , in the following we will refer as our reference model with a threshold value of @xmath23 and no lf evolution , or , as an alternative , with the metallicity threshold of @xmath13 and a linear redshift evolution of the burst luminosity .    in the bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : zge5 ] , we show the cumulative fraction of grbs with peak photon flux larger than @xmath22 expected at @xmath0 . for our reference model ,",
    "we find that @xmath25% ( 4% ) of all long burst detected by _ swift _ should lie at @xmath0 assuming a flux limit of @xmath26 ( 1 ) ph s@xmath3 @xmath4 .",
    "higher ( lower ) percentages can be obtained assuming lower ( higher ) values of the metallicity threshold .",
    "note that the expected fraction of @xmath0 grbs is higher than the @xmath27% obtained by bromm & loeb ( 2006 ) and 2% obtained by gorosabel et al .",
    "( 2004 ) at @xmath26 ph s@xmath3 @xmath4 for models in which grbs are tracer of the cosmic star formation .",
    "the discrepancy is easily explained by the different intrinsic redshift grb distributions implied by these models , that are found to underestimate also the number of bursts detected by _ swift _ at @xmath1 ( sc07 ) .",
    "natarjan et al .",
    "( 2005 ) have explored a simple toy model taking into account the effect of metallicity in grb formation .",
    "they assumed a higher grb formation rate at @xmath28 when the average metallicity of the universe is low and found that the fraction of grbs at @xmath0 is @xmath29% .",
    "this value is consistent with our upper bound obtained with a more detailed description of the metallicity redshift evolution .    in fig .",

    ", no grb has been identified at so high redshift .",
    "indeed , we find that the probability is quite low , but at the lowest photon fluxes . for our reference model ,",
    "the probability is larger than 10% only for @xmath31 ph s@xmath3 @xmath4 .",
    "unfortunately , below this limit the large majority of the grbs has no redshift determination .",
    "we find that @xmath32% ( 1% ) of all long burst detected by _",
    "swift _ should lie at @xmath30 assuming a flux limit of @xmath26 ( 1 ) ph s@xmath3 @xmath4 .",
    "daigne , rossi & mochkovitch ( 2006 ) computed the expected fraction of grbs at @xmath30 for a wide range of models considering that grbs follow the global star formation but are characterized by strong evolution in the grb lf .",
    "they found that the expected fraction of @xmath30 grbs with @xmath33 ph s@xmath3 @xmath4 is 0.34% , depending on the assumed star formation rate , lf evolution and intrinsic peak energy distribution .",
    "although a full comparison is not possible given the different assumptions in the two works , we note that the fraction of @xmath30 grbs predicted by our models ( 0.1 - 1.5% ) is consistent with the range of values reported by daigne et al .",
    "fast selection procedures of high@xmath6 grb candidates are needed in order to acquire data as the grb afterglow is still sufficiently bright to allow high signal to noise spectroscopic observations and reliable redshift measurements .",
    "campana et al .",
    "( 2007 ; thereafter c07 ) proposed to select @xmath0 candidates based on some _ swift _ promptly  available information : grb time duration ( @xmath34 s ) , lack of an uvot counterpart , and low galactic extinction ( @xmath35 or high galactic latitude ) .",
    "the first constraint preferentially selects distant grbs whose duration is stretched by cosmological time dilation .",
    "the second picks up highly extincted or high redshift objects ( uvot observes shortward of 5500 @xmath36 and it is virtually blind to objects at @xmath0 due to the lyman drop out ) . since march 2006",
    ", all bursts are observed with the same uvot strategy : a first short ( a few tens of seconds ) @xmath37 image and then 100 s white image .",
    "so , the requirement of lack of uvot detection is equivalent to have @xmath38 . finally , the further constraint on the galactic extinction cleans the sample from heavily absorbed grbs from our galaxy , i.e. we select bursts with high galactic latitudes . we note that this last requirement is simple operative and not related to the grb event .",
    "we further exclude from our selection grbs that lack an xrt detection and those for which the satellite did not slew just after the trigger . applying the c07 selection criteria on the last year",
    "_ swift _ ( from march 2006 to march 2007 ) , we obtain a small sample of seven candidates .",
    "we propose here to add as further selection criterion the probability of a burst to be detected at @xmath0 , as computed in the previous section .",
    "we consider as good candidates , grbs that have probability larger than 10% , corresponding to @xmath2 ph s@xmath3 @xmath4 for our reference model .",
    "we stress here that the information on the grb peak photon flux is also promptly available in the first gcn circulars .",
    "four out of the seven candidates , that satisfy the previous c07 selection criteria , can be indeed discarded on the bases of their large photon fluxes : the probability of these grbs to lie at @xmath0 is below 2% in any model here considered .",
    "it is interesting to note that two out of the four candidates selected in the original work by c07 ( i.e. , grb 060904a and grb 060814 ) do not match our probability criterion . moreover , among the discarded bursts , grb 070306 is consistent with all selection criteria considered by c07 , being @xmath39 s , @xmath40 , and galactic @xmath41 , but it is probably hosted in a galaxy at moderate redshift ( malesani et al . 2007b ; jaunsen et al .",
    "2007 gives @xmath42 ) .",
    "indeed , we can exclude it from the target sample on the basis of the high observed peak photon flux , @xmath43 ph s@xmath3 @xmath4 , corresponding to a probability of @xmath44% of being at @xmath0 . therefore , the further requirement based on theoretical predictions is very effective in reducing the number of possible high redshift candidates , discarding low@xmath6 interlopers . by combining model predictions and",
    "_ swift _ promptly available information , we select only three bursts out of the 84 grbs detected by _",
    "swift _ in the last year : grb 060427 , grb 060510b , and grb 060522 .",
    "the last two bursts are indeed confirmed to lie at @xmath8 , whereas the first one has no redshift .",
    "thus , our method is quite effective in selecting @xmath0 grbs and allow a ( near ) real time selection of good targets for spectroscopic studies of high redshift grbs with 8-m class telescopes .",
    "it is important to note that our procedure is very effective in single out high-@xmath6 grb candidates among the many that are detected by _ swift _ , however it does not guarantee that _ all _ high-@xmath6 bursts will be selected . in other words , it does not select the complete sample of grbs at @xmath0 .",
    "besides the above grbs , there are few other _ swift _ grbs that match all but one of our requirements .",
    "we can identify these as secondary candidates .",
    "three bursts are picked up by relaxing only slightly our selection criteria : grb 061028 , grb 070129 , and grb 070223 .",
    "the first two bursts have galactic @xmath45 .",
    "since the criterion based on the galactic extinction is only operative cleaning the sample from sources at low galactic latitudes , we can safely include these bursts in our analysis .",
    "the optical afterglow of grb 070129 has been identified both in @xmath46 ( malesani et al .",
    "2007a ) and in @xmath47 ( halpern et al .",
    "the detection in these bands is not in contrast with a burst lying at @xmath0 .",
    "finally , grb 070223 is not detected in the uvot @xmath37 band but the limit in this band is only @xmath48 mag .",
    "all these bursts lack of the redshift and might represent good candidates .",
    "so , our final sample ( primary and secondary targets ) consists of six bursts , two being confirmed at @xmath0 ( i.e. success rate @xmath49% ) .",
    "also in this case , the sample is clean , since no low@xmath6 interlopers has been identified up to now .",
    "the properties of the selected targets are reported in table  1 .",
    ".main properties of the @xmath8 candidate sample derived from last year of _ swift _ observations .",
    "the first three sources are the one that satisfy all our selection criteria , the other three are just slightly below one of them ( see text ) .",
    "[ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^ , < \" , ]     as a further exercise , we apply our selection criteria also to the first year of _ swift _ data .",
    "although the uvot strategy was less efficient and clean , the procedure gives similar results .",
    "only three bursts satisfy all our requirements : grb 050814 , grb 050904 , and , grb 051001 .",
    "the first two bursts are indeed at @xmath0 , lying at @xmath50 and @xmath51 , respectively , while the third lacks of redshift determination .",
    "this result confirms the efficiency of the selection procedure here proposed and strengthens our conclusions .",
    "we compute the probability to detect a long grb with observed photon flux @xmath22 at very high redshift under the assumption that grbs form preferentially in low  metallicity environments ,",

    ", we expect that 730% ( 0.111% ) of all detected bursts should lie at @xmath0 ( @xmath30 ) , where the lower ( upper ) bound refers to the upper ( lower ) metallicity threshold considered .",
    "similar results can be obtained by assuming that grbs are tracer of the global star formation , but characterized by strong evolution in the lf ( daigne et al .",
    "2006 ; sc07 ) . however , these models require that the typical grb luminosity should increase quite strongly with redshift , being @xmath55 times higher at @xmath56 with respect to the local one .",

    "2003 ) support the idea that grbs might form preferentially in low - metallicity environments .",
    "we have seen that the detection of grbs at high redshift is a rare event .",
    "moreover , spectroscopic study of these bursts requires a very rapid re  pointing of large ground  based telescope .",

    "we want to stress here that all quantities needed for the selection are available within a few hours from burst trigger , allowing a rapid pointing of 8-m class telescope for spectroscopic follow  up studies .",
