    "nearby molecular clouds which are the sites of active star formation are observed to be surrounded by a population of less obscured and more evolved young stars .",
    "h@xmath1 emission - line and x - ray surveys have revealed large numbers of pre - main sequence stars that extend well beyond the molecular cloud boundaries .",
    "for example , the rosat all - sky survey has led to the identification of 112 lithium - rich pre - main sequence stars that are spread over a 450 square degree area surrounding the orion star - forming molecular clouds ( alcal _ et al .",
    "while some of the young stars appear to be related to earlier star formation in gould s belt , at least 60% are found directly associated with the orion molecular cloud complex ( alcal _ et al .",
    "_ 2000 ) . proposed origins for these associated young stars include formation in rapidly moving cloudlets that have since dispersed ( feigelson 1996 ) or ejection from the cloud core due to three - body encounters ( sterzik & durisen 1995 ) .",
    "alternatively , they could simply be fossil tracers of previously exisiting dense molecular gas in analogy with ob associations and now dispersed giant molecular clouds ( e.g. , blaauw 1991 ) . clearly , determining the age and distribution of pre - main sequence stars surrounding the denser molecular gas holds the key to describing the star formation history of a region and perhaps sets limits to the lifetime of the molecular cloud .",
    "the @xmath0 oph cloud complex , located the the edge of the upper scorpius subgroup in the sco - cen ob association , is comprised of a series of filamentary dark clouds that extend eastward from cores of dense molecular gas ( de geus 1992 ) . at a distance of about 150 pc ,",
    "it is one of the closest regions of active star formation .",
    "the main cloud , l1688 , hosts a 1 pc x 2 pc centrally condensed molecular core where the visual extinction is estimated to be 50 - 100 mag ( wilking & lada 1983 ) .",
    "the core of l1688 has been the focus of numerous near - infrared , far - infrared , and millimeter continuum surveys , as well as x - ray and radio continuum surveys , and is found to host an embedded infrared cluster with around 200 stars ( e.g. , greene & young 1992 ; bontemps _ et al .",

    "infrared spectroscopic studies infer a median age of 0.3 myr for objects in the core ( greene & meyer 1995 ; luhman & rieke 1999 ) .",
    "it has been suggested that star formation in the @xmath0 oph core is the latest in a chain of events that began with massive stars in the upper centaurus - lupus and lower centaurus - crux subgroups of the sco - cen ob association triggering the formation of ob stars in the upper scorpius subgroup , which in turn initiated star formation in the l1688 cloud ( de geus 1992 ) .    until recently , there has been limited study of the nature of lightly extincted association members at the periphery of the l1688 cloud that have been identified through h@xmath1 objective prism and x - ray surveys ( e.g. , dolidze & arakelyan 1959 ; wilking , schwartz , & blackwell 1987 ; montmerle _ et al . _ 1983 ; casanova _ et al .",
    "early spectroscopic studies of h@xmath1 emission - line stars presented spectral types for about 20 young stars ( struve & rubkjbing 1949 ; cohen & kuhi 1979 ; rydgren 1980 ) .",
    "an optical spectroscopic survey of @xmath0 oph x - ray sources was conducted by bouvier & appenzeller ( 1992 ) and established spectral types for 30 pre - main sequence stars ( 23 new ) .",
    "they found an age of 1 - 10 myr for these objects , significantly older than the age of objects in the core ( see also greene & meyer 1995 ) .",
    "but these samples favored the brighter association members and gave the incorrect impression that there was a deficiency of m spectral - type stars relative to other nearby star - forming regions ( see fig .",

    "this was remedied in part by martn _",
    "( 1998 ) who obtained optical spectroscopy for 59 rosat - selected sources in the core and streamer of the cloud with the majority of objects classified as pre - main sequence m stars . by examining the ratio of classical t tauri stars ( ctts ) to weak - emission t tauri stars ( wtts ) , they found evidence for an older pre - main sequence population outside of the l1688 core .    in an effort to identify more",
    "widely - distributed and/or older late - type association members , we have obtained deep narrowband images of a one square degree area encompassing the l1688 cloud and centered at the wavelengths of h@xmath1 and [ s  ii ] . shorter exposures at r and i were also obtained .",
    "this resulted in a sample of 282 candidate ctts with r@xmath220 mag that had possible h@xmath1 emission .",
    "this sample includes association members with greater obscuration and/or lower mass than targeted by previous surveys . using the multi - object spectrograph hydra ,",

    "1997 ) . briefly , long ( 45 minute ) exposure narrowband images centered at the wavelengths of h@xmath1 ( fwhm=64  ) and [ s  ii ] ( fwhm=45  ) were obtained in addition to short ( 5 minute ) exposures in the standard r and i bands .",
    "the latter were calibrated in the johnson - kron - cousins photometric system using standard star fields established by landolt ( 1992 ) .",
    "r and/or i band photometry were obtained for over 2700 stars in the ophiuchus field with r@xmath220 .",
    "accurate positions ( @xmath20.5@xmath3 ) for these stars were obtained using the astrom program distributed by the starlink project and a set of secondary astrometric standards .",
    "the secondary position references were 27 h@xmath1 emission line stars with accurate positions determined relative to sao stars in a 5 square degree region on the red palomar sky survey plate ( wilking _ et al .",
    "the narrowband images were utilized to estimate the equivalent width of possible h@xmath1 emission .",
    "the continuum in the h@xmath1 filter was estimated using the flux in the [ s  ii ] filter after correcting for the differences in filter widths and transmission and assuming a flat continuum with no [ s  ii ] emission .",
    "the latter assumption was shown to be valid , with detections of weak [ s  ii ] emission in only two sources . as a result ,",
    "282 stars with r@xmath220 were identified with possible h@xmath1 emission [ ew(h@xmath1)@xmath4 10  ] . however , because of structure in the continuum due to reddening and photospheric absorption bands , it was desirable to confirm this emission spectroscopically .",
    "one hundred fifty - one spectra were obtained for 139 stars located toward the cloud and its periphery on 1999 may 5 - 6 using hydra , the multi - fiber spectrograph , on the wiyn 3.5 m telescope .",
    "the bench spectrograph camera was used with the red fiber cable , the 600 lines / mm grating with a blaze angle of 13.9@xmath5 and the gg-495 filter to cover the range of 5820 - 8700   centered near 7200  .",
    "the spectral dispersion was 1.39   per pixel giving an effective resolution of 2.88  .",
    "the resolution at the central wavelength was @xmath6/@xmath7=2500 .",

    "fields 2 and 3 sampled the same magnitude range of candidate ctts ( 15@xmath2r@xmath217 ) with the pointing centers shifted in declination . field 4 candidates ( 17@xmath2r@xmath219.1 ) were supplemented by 5 brown dwarf candidates from the study of wilking , greene , & meyer ( 1999 ) .",
    "we observed 81% of the candidate ctts with r@xmath215 , 88% of the candidates with 15@xmath2r@xmath217 , 45% with 17@xmath2r@xmath218 , and 21% of the candidates with 17@xmath2r@xmath219.1 . in table 1 , we summarize the observations by presenting for each field the pointing center , r magnitude range , number of candidate ctts observed , integration time , and number of exposures .",
    "the spectra were reduced using the image reduction and analysis facility ( iraf ) .",
    "images were processed for bias and dark corrections using ccdproc .",
    "multiple exposures of a given field were median - combined and then reduced with iraf s dohydra package .",
    "the images were flat - fielded using dome flats obtained for each fiber configuration except for field 1 where the flat from the configuration for field 2 was used .",
    "sky subtraction was accomplished using the median of 7 - 10 sky spectra distributed across each field .",
    "the spectra were wavelength calibrated using 5 second exposures of cuar lamps .",
    "scattered light corrections were not made and no flux calibration was performed .",
    "it was necessary in a few cases to improve the sky subtraction by first scaling the median sky spectrum before subtracting it from the source spectrum .",
    "the typical signal - to - noise for the spectra extracted in each field is presented in table 1 .",
    "spectral types were derived from visual classification ( visual pattern matching of our smoothed program star spectra with standard star spectra ) supported by quantitative analysis of some spectral indices . in this section ,",
    "we provide descriptions of the absorption lines used to classifiy three broad groups , starting with the earliest spectral type stars ( b - a ) , moving to the f - k stars , and finally the m stars .",
    "we conclude the section with a discussion of gravity - sensitive absorption features in the 5820 - 8700   spectral range . for the purposes of matching spectral features with those of standard stars",
    ", our hydra spectra were smoothed using a gaussian filter to the resolution of the standard stars for direct comparison .",
    "all spectra have been normalized to 1 by dividing out a fit to the continuae , carefully excluding regions with emission lines or broad absorption due to tio and vo .",
    "normalized spectra smoothed to a resolution of 5.7   are shown in fig . 1 for a representative sample of program objects , with early - type stars in fig . 1a ( b3-g9 ) , k stars in fig .",
    "1b , early - to - mid m stars in fig .",
    "1c , and mid - to - late m stars in fig . 1d .",
    "both photospheric and telluric spectral features are labeled .",
    "two main sets of standards were used for classification ( both qualitative and quantitative ) .",
    "first , optical spectra from the wiyn / hydra study of the praesepe by allen & strom ( 1995 ) were used to derive spectral types from b8v - m4v .",
    "the effective resolution of these spectra was 5.7  . for giants and later type dwarfs ( m5v - m9v ) , optical spectra from the study of kirkpatrick , henry , & mccarthy ( 1991 )",
    "were used with an effective resolution of either 8 or 18  .",
    "in addition to these , optical spectra of very late type subgiants in ic  348 ( luhman 1999 ) and @xmath0 oph ( luhman , liebert , & rieke 1997 ) were used for comparison with the coolest stars in our sample . for stars ealier than b8v , we referred to the spectral atlas of torres - dodgen and weaver ( 1993 ) .",
    "absorption lines from the balmer ( n=2 ) and paschen ( n=3 ) series of hydrogen are prominent in the spectra of early type stars . in our spectra",
    ", we see unblended absorption lines from h@xmath1 ( 6563  ) and paschen 14 ( 8598  ) ( see fig .",
    "1a ) that reach a maximum around a0 and weaken in warmer stars .",
    "the ca  ii triplet ( 8498  , 8542  , 8662  ) is also observed and decreases in strength toward early - type stars until overtaken by pa  16 , 15 , and 13 ( 8502 , 8545 , and 8665 ) .",
    "hence an f2 star may have a similar ew(h@xmath1 ) as a b5 star , but will be distinct by displaying stronger absorption from the ca  ii triplet .",
    "we note that all of the aforementioned lines can appear in emission , and that the observed absorption line strengths could be lower limits to the true strengths .",
    "we estimate that the uncertainties in our derived spectral types in this range is @xmath85 subclasses , however , our adopted spectral types will be greatly aided by previously published observations of these intrinsically bright stars .",
    "the relative strength of absorption due to h@xmath1 and a blend of ba  ii , fe  i , and ca  i centered at 6497   is the most sensitive indicator of spectral type over this range . also helpful in spectral classification",
    "is absorption due to ca  i at 6122   which grows stronger from a to k spectral types ( e.g. , compare figs .",
    "1a and 1b ) .",
    "absorption from the ca  ii triplet is present but shows little variation with spectral type in f - k stars .",
    "in general , the variation in these features is very gradual from subclass to subclass and , when coupled with the signal - to - noise of the spectra , the uncertainties in the spectral classifications between f0 and k0 are often @xmath83 - 5 subclasses .",
    "paschen line absorption ( 13 and higher transitions ) will be present through mid - f stars , but pa  13 , 15 , and 16 are blended and dominated by the lines from the ca  ii triplet at our resolution .",
    "once again , the partial filling of h@xmath1 absorption by h@xmath1 emission in ctts could lead us to assign spectral types that are too late .",
    "for stars k5v and later , the depths of the tio and vo bands provide the most sensitive indicators of spectral type . as shown in fig . 1b",
    ", tio absorption bands begin to appear in mid - k stars centered at 6300  , 6700  , and 7140   and increase in strength through m6v stars ( fig .",
    "absorption due to tio , which begins near the strong telluric o@xmath9 band (  oxygen b band \" , 7594 - 7685  ) and extends to 7861  , is evident for spectral types of m1v and later and is further strengthened by vo absorption from 7851 - 7973   in mid - to - late m stars ( fig .",
    "tio absorption bands from 8432 - 8452    also appear for spectral types of m2v and later and increase in strength through m9v ( fig .",
    "for the coolest m stars ( m6-m9 ) , the depths of the tio bands centered at 7140   and 7800 appear to decrease , likely due to depletion of ti into grains ( e.g. , allen 1996 , fig .",
    "2a ) ; vo absorption from 7334 - 7543    and from 7851 - 7973   then becomes a more reliable indicator of spectral type .",
    "spectral classification in this temperature range was accomplished through a combination of visual classification and quantitative analysis of tio and vo indices which we now describe .",
    "the indices were computed by taking the ratio of the average flux in a @xmath1050   wide band of the continuum to the average in an absorption band .",
    "following allen ( 1996 ) , we plotted the tio index of 7035/7140  vs. the tio index of 7500/7800  along with their one sigma errors for each hydra field as well as our dwarf standards .",
    "2a shows a plot of the tio indices for the dwarf standards .",
    "there is a general trend for tio index to increase with later spectral type until m7 , where the trend reverses and the index decreases for stars cooler than m7 . to resolve the ambiguity caused by this reversal , we developed two narrow band vo indices for spectral classification of the coolest stars in our sample .",
    "a plot of these indices is shown in fig .",
    "2b for m dwarf standards .",
    "the first index is the ratio of the continuum averaged over two bands which bracket the vo band centered at 7485   to the average flux in the vo band .",
    "the second index is the ratio of the continuum in a band centered on 8120   to the flux in the vo band centered at 7979  . as shown in fig .",
    "2b , there is a general trend for the indices to increase from spectral types m3 to m9 .",
    "while the use of these indices allowed us to sort objects by temperature , the final spectral classifications were made by direct comparisons of the strengths of the tio and vo bands with standard star spectra .",
    "the sensitivity of these absorption bands to spectral class allowed us in most cases to estimate m spectral types to within a subclass .",
    "a rough estimate of the surface gravity of an object is important in determining its nature and in estimating accurately its effective temperature for a given spectral type . in particular",
    ", surface gravity indicators can help identify background giants and field dwarfs that might contaminate our sample .",
    "gravity - sensitive absorption features available for analysis in our spectra include the cah band centered at 6975   and the na",
    "i doublet at 8183/8195 (both strongest in dwarfs ) and absorption from the ca  ii triplet at 8660   ( strongest in giants ) . of these features , cah is well - positioned for study .",
    "following allen ( 1996 ) , we have calculated a cah index as the ratio of the continuum at 7035@xmath815   to the flux in the cah absorption band at 6975@xmath815 and a tio index as the ratio of the continuum at 7030 @xmath815   to the flux in the tio absorption band at 7140@xmath815   from the normalized spectrum of each program object . in fig .",
    "3 , we plot the cah index vs. the tio index for 136 program objects .",
    "error bars are computed based on the one - sigma error in flux averages and propagated to the ratios .",
    "the solid lines represent first or second order fits to the standard star spectra .",
    "based on this plot , we conclude that the surface gravities for objects with the largest tio index ( coolest stars ) are intermediate between those of giants and dwarfs .",
    "while there are clearly late - type giants present in our sample , about 70% of the program objects have tio indices @xmath2 2 ( about spectral type m4  v ) and surface gravities that most closely resemble dwarf stars . therefore",
    ", spectral types for our program objects were determined by comparing them to a grid of dwarf standards .",
    "spectral types were determined for 131 of 139 stars in the manner described in sec . 3.3 . using the cah index and other gravity sensitive features ( sec .",
    "3.4 ) , six stars are identified as giants and 26 as possible dwarfs .",
    "these data are presented in table 2 along with any previous source names , x - ray associations , ra and dec in j2000 , and r and i magnitudes .",
    "the derived spectral types ( or range of possible spectral types ) are also shown to the right of each spectrum in fig . 1 along with its classification as a possible dwarf ( v ? ) ,",
    "giant ( iii ) , association member ( a ) , or association unknown ( u ) .",
    "the top two spectra in figs .",
    "1c and 1d demonstrate the different features present in high and low surface gravity objects of the same spectral type . in the following sections",
    ", we discuss what the spectra reveal about the characteristics of the young stars and their evolutionary states . included in this discussion",
    "is the distribution of spectral types in our sample and the variety and properties of their emission lines .",
    "a description is given of how association membership was determined and the resulting spatial distribution of association members relative to the molecular gas .",
    "finally , the evolutionary state of the population is estimated by deriving ages and masses using a hertzsprung - russell diagram .      the distribution of spectral types for our sample is shown in fig .",
    "4 . over half ( 79 ) of the 131 objects with spectral - type determinations are m stars .",
    "the fact that our sample is dominated by m stars is due in part to a selection effect caused by the onset of tio absorption bands .",
    "the procedure described in sec .",
    "2.1 was designed to select objects with h@xmath1 emission provided the continuum was relatively flat .",
    "but the same procedure could erroneously identify m stars with strong tio absorption as h@xmath1 emission - line objects since the h@xmath1 filter bandpass lies in a spectral region free of tio absorption while the comparison [ s  ii ] filter bandpass lies within strong tio absorption at 6700  .",
    "the shaded areas of the histogram represent sources with strong h@xmath1 emission ( ew(h@xmath1)@xmath4 10  ) at the time of our observations .",
    "our procedure of selecting h@xmath1 emission line stars from narrowband images was only moderately successful .",
    "in particular , our procedure appears to break down for the fainter sources ( r@xmath217 ) which accounts for the number of background g stars in our spectroscopic sample .",
    "our highest success rate occurred with mid - k stars and mid - to - late m stars and was 65% . in the latter group ,",
    "h@xmath1 emission was clearly a factor in their identification in our original narrowband image .",
    "there is clearly no deficiency of m - type ctts in the @xmath0 oph cloud relative to other nearby star - forming regions .",
    "the apparent lack of m stars in previous spectroscopic surveys represents the bias toward brighter stars in those surveys .",
    "nearly one - third of our sample for which we could determine spectral types displayed strong emission from h@xmath1 .",
    "the spectra for about one - third of these strong emitters also exhibited emission lines from he  i , o  i , ca  ii , and/or pa 14 .",
    "emission lines were identified and their equivalent widths and full - widths at half maximum ( fwhm ) were measured using gaussian fits .",
    "no attempt was made to deconvolve the emission profile by the instrument response .",
    "the results for all ctts are presented in table 3 .    since our sample",
    "was based on a procedure designed to select sources with strong h@xmath1 emission characteristic of ctts , it is not surprising that 39 of the 131 objects with spectral - type determinations displayed strong h@xmath1 emission .",
    "of these , 26 are newly identified ctts based on an ew(h@xmath1 ) @xmath4 10 criteria .",
    "the previously identified ctts can be found in table 2 by looking at sources with previously measured h@xmath1 emission ( column 10 ) .",
    "an additional 17 objects showed weaker h@xmath1 emission ( 10   @xmath4 ew(h@xmath1 ) @xmath4 5  ) with nearly all having spectral types from m3-m5 .",
    "we note that variability plays a role in the identification of h@xmath1 emission ( e.g. , wilking _",
    "_ 1987 ; hartigan 1993 ) . among the six h@xmath1 emitters with multiple observations , the equivalent width of object 2 - 30 ( field number - aperture from table 2 ) dropped from 38   to 8.5   in only one day .",
    "the brown dwarf candidate gy  5 was observed to have an ew(h@xmath1 ) = 15   whereas a similar spectrum obtained in 1998 showed no detectable emission ( wilking _ et al .",
    "in addition , the shape of the emission profile also appeared to change in three cases ( chini  8 , el  24 , and object 2 - 30 ) .",
    "all of the strong h@xmath1 emission lines were well - resolved with typical fwhms of 250 km s@xmath11 compared to the 128 km s@xmath11 velocity resolution of our data .",
    "these broad h@xmath1 profiles , which can exceed 300 km s@xmath11 in our sample , have been successfully modeled as arising in magnetospheric accretion columns ( hartmann , hewett , & calvet 1994 ; muzerolle , calvet , & hartmann 2001 ) .",
    "thirteen of the h@xmath1 profiles were clearly asymmetric or displayed non - gaussian wings .",
    "the profile shapes are noted in table 3 using the classification scheme of reipurth , pedrosa , & lago ( 1996 ) .",
    "the prevalence of wings or asymmetries on the blue - side of the profile is typical among ctts and suggests the presence of mass outflows .",
    "the ca  ii triplet at 8660   was observed in emission in 14 of the h@xmath1 emitters and was strongest in the g or k spectral type objects .",
    "no attempt was made to deblend them from the weaker paschen emission lines pa  13 , pa  15 , and pa  16 .",

    "weak [ s  ii ] emission at 6731   was detected in only 2 objects ( sr  22 and wsb  46 ) .",

    "the errors in the photometry and/or spectral classification yielded slightly negative values for the extinction and an extinction of 0.0 was assumed .",

    "excluded from the diagram is the b3 star source 1 , the a7 star vssg  14 , and objects gy  59 and gy  326 which lack r band photometry and therefore estimates for a@xmath12 and log ( l ) .",

    "is estimated to be 0.12 dex , assuming uncertainties in the r and i photometry of 0.04 mag , in the distance modulus of 0.15 mag , and in the bolometric correction of 0.1 mag .",

    "comparisons with the baraffe _",
    "( 1998 ) models suggest systematic errors between different sets of models of @xmath1050% in mass and @xmath100.5 dex in log(age ) ( e.g. , hillenbrand & white 2004 ) .    the median age of the association members in fig .",
    "7 is 2.1 myr .",
    "there is no significant difference observed in the median age of the ctts and the non - ctts association members . following the analysis of preibisch & zinnecker ( 1999 ) ,",
    "the apparent age spread observed in fig .",
    "7 is consistent with all of the association members having roughly the same age ( 1 - 3 myr ) with the scatter in the age accounted for by the errors noted above and unresolved binaries .",
    "the association members identified in this study are pre - main sequence objects distributed over a 1.3 square degree area ( 6.8 pc@xmath33 ) and lie within a projected radius of 2 pc of the highest extinction regions of the main @xmath0 oph cloud ( see fig . 6 ) . the fact that our derived visual extinctions are generally low (",
    "80% of the association members have a@xmath12 @xmath34 5 mag ) indicates that the majority of our sample lies at the surface of the cloud .",
    "recent spectroscopic studies of ysos in the @xmath0 oph cloud have focussed on the embedded population in the 1 pc x 2 pc centrally condensed core and have necessarily been conducted at near - infrared wavelengths ( greene & meyer 1995 ; luhman & rieke 1999 ; wgm99 ; natta _ et al .",
    "these studies have consistently derived ages between 0.1 - 1 myr when using the dantona & mazzitelli tracks and isochrones , with a median age of 0.3 myr . after considering our uncertainties ,",
    "we conclude that the distributed population is significantly older than that in the more highly extincted cloud core .",
    "the question then arises as to the origin of this more distributed population .",
    "one explanation is that these objects formed in the dense core and have diffused or been ejected to the surface of the cloud .",
    "however , the space motion of a yso which acquires the velocity dispersion of the molecular gas in which it formed ( 1 - 2 km s@xmath11 ) would not be high enough to move an object to the projected distances from the core of @xmath41 pc that we observe for some association members .",
    "alternatively , the ejection of very low mass stars and brown dwarfs from small groups has been proposed for the origin of widely distributed wtts and of substellar objects ( sterzik & durisen 1995 ; reipurth & clarke 2001 ; bate _ et al .",
    "_ 2002 ) . in this case",
    ", one would predict that the lowest mass association members in our sample would display a higher velocity dispersion ( and thus a broader spatial distribution ) than ysos in the core .",
    "we have analyzed the distribution of the higher mass association members ( m@xmath40.5 m@xmath29 ) relative the the lower mass members ( m@xmath20.5 m@xmath29 ) using a two - dimensional kolmogorov - smirnov ( k - s ) test .",
    "the k - s statistic is consistent with the two populations being drawn from the same parent population .",
    "our data do not lend support to the ejection hypothesis , however our sample includes only 8 brown dwarf candidates .",
    "a second possibility is that the association members at the cloud edges are near their birthsites and that the dense gas in l1688 was once distributed over a larger area than we see today .",
    "it has been proposed that star formation in the upper scorpius was triggered about 5 myr ago by the passage of an expanding hi shell driven by massive stars in the upper centaurus - lupus association ( de geus 1992 ) .",
    "this age is consistent with that of high mass stars in upper sco derived from a color - magnitude diagram and from the main sequence turnoff ( preibisch _ et al .",
    "_ 2002 ; see models by bertelli _",
    "the implied age of the low mass stars in upper sco is also 5 myr , but only after corrections are made for unresolved binaries ( preibisch & zinnecker 1999 ) . a comparsion of fig . 7 with h - r diagrams for low mass members of the upper scorpius subgroup , using the same set of theoretical evolutionary tracks and isochrones and not corrected for unresolved binaries , shows no discernable difference in age or age spread ( e.g. , preibisch & zinnecker 1999 ; preibisch , guenther , & zinnecker 2001 ; preibisch _ et al .",
    "this is not too surprising given that the @xmath0 oph cloud is ringed by high - mass members of upper scorpius such as the multiple star @xmath0 oph and @xmath35 sco to the west and 22 sco , @xmath1 sco , and @xmath36 sco to the east .",
    "therefore , one could regard the distributed population we observe as either low mass members of the upper scorpius subgroup or as older members of the @xmath0 oph cloud whose formation was contemporaneous with stars in the upper scorpius subgroup . in either scenario , ultraviolet radiation and the passage of an expanding shell from massive stars in the upper scorpius subgroup within the last 2.5 myr",
    "would have stripped away the outer skin of the @xmath0 oph cloud , revealing the present population and perhaps triggering a second episode of star formation in the in the centrally condensed core ( de geus 1992 ) .",
    "we have analysed optical spectra for 139 candidate ctts that extend over a 1.3 square degree area in the direction of the main @xmath0 oph cloud . of the 131 stars for which spectral types and surface gravities are estimated ,",
    "6 are identified as giants and 79 are classified as m stars .",
    "association with the cloud is established for 88 objects by the presence of optical emission lines or lithium absorption in the spectra , by location in the h - r diagram , and/or by previously reported x - ray emission .",
    "thirty - nine of the stars display strong h@xmath1 emission ( ew@xmath410 ) characteristic of ctts .",
    "these emission lines are broad ( fwhm@xmath10250 km s@xmath11 ) , consistent with their origin in magnetospheric accretion columns . in addition ,",
    "asymmetries in the h@xmath1 profiles and the presence of forbibben lines are observed in 16 objects are a signpost of mass outflows . a subset of the ctts also display emission from the ca ii triplet which is strongest in the most massive ctts and , in one instance , self - absorbed .",
    "two of the strongest emission - line objects are young , x - ray emitting brown dwarf candidates with m8 spectral types .",
    "association members are distributed in the lower extinction regions surrounding the high extinction core .",
    "a h - r diagram suggests a median age of 2.1 myr with an apparent age spread due mainly to uncertainties in the calculated luminosity and the presence of unresolved binaries .",
    "this age is significantly older than the median age of 0.3 myr for objects in the high extinction core .",
    "there is no difference in median age between the ctts and non - ctts association members and there are no statistically significant correlations between the age or mass of an association member and its projected distance from the core center .",
    "the age and distribution of this population is indistinguishable from low mass stars in the upper scorpius subgroup .",
    "we propose that these stars formed in what was once a larger @xmath0 oph cloud . in this instance ,",
    "star formation in the outer regions of the @xmath0 oph cloud would have been triggered by the same event that initiated star formation in upper scorpius .",
