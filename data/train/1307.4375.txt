    "evolutionary game theory ( egt )  @xcite provides a suitable framework to model the evolution of cooperative behavior , which is a problem of paramount importance  @xcite .",
    "egt is traditionally concerned with the dynamics of competing species ( strategies ) in infinitely large populations where each species reproductive potential ( fitness ) varies with the population composition .",
    "the selection pressure is thus `` frequency - dependent '' and the deterministic evolution is described in terms of ordinary differential ( replicator ) equations  @xcite .",
    "the classic notion of evolutionary stable strategy ( ess ) is related to the stability of the fixed points of the underlying replicator equations : a strategy is evolutionary stable if the fitness of those adopting it is always higher than the fitness of a small fraction of mutants with an alternative strategy . as an important consequence of frequency - dependent selection",
    ", the fitness optimization at an individual level may cause the reduction of the population s average fitness .",
    "this yields a `` social dilemma '' , as in the celebrated prisoner s dilemma game where the best strategy for each player is to defect even if mutual cooperation would benefit the whole population  @xcite .",
    "cooperation dilemmas can arise in other simple models , like the two - strategy snowdrift and stag - hunt games  @xcite .",
    "the attempt to explain the cooperative behaviors observed in experiments  @xcite has motivated the investigation of various mechanisms ( kin and group selection , reciprocity , local interactions ) that could possibly promote the spread of cooperation  @xcite .",
    "when the size of the population is finite , evolution is known to be affected by demographic noise .",
    "the dynamics is thus often modeled in terms of continuous - time markov chains and characterized by the notion of fixation probability  @xcite .",
    "this concept refers to the possibility that a `` mutant type '' takes over the entire population and is closely related to the important concept of evolutionary stability in finite populations ( ess@xmath0 ) put forward by nowak and collaborators  @xcite .",
    "these authors proposed that in two - player games a given strategy ( say @xmath1 ) is evolutionary stable in a finite population if , in addition to having a higher fitness than the alternative strategy ( say @xmath2 ) , the selection also opposes the replacement of @xmath1 by @xmath2 .",
    "as a direct consequence , when the fixation probability of the mutant type @xmath2 is higher than in the absence of selection , the evolution favors @xmath2 replacing @xmath1  @xcite .",
    "in this work , we consider the evolutionary dynamics of three important classes of two - strategy games , namely the prisoner s dilemma ( pd ) , snowdrift ( sd ) and stag - hunt ( sh ) games , where the pure strategies are `` cooperation '' ( @xmath2 ) and `` defection '' ( @xmath1 ) and the former is supported by the presence of a number of `` cooperation facilitators '' in the population .",
    "the facilitators participate in the dynamics by enhancing the fitness of cooperators relative to the reproductive potential of defectors  @xcite . here , our goal is to analyze the interplay in finite populations between selection , demographic fluctuations and facilitators in these paradigmatic classes of evolutionary games .",
    "in fact , it is important to understand whether selection favors cooperation , and in particular when it promotes the replacement of defectors by cooperators  @xcite .",
    "for instance , while selection always opposes cooperation in the classic pd games ( no facilitators ) , it has been found that cooperation can spread in a special class of pd games with facilitators  @xcite . for pd ,",
    "sd and sh games , we here investigate the circumstances and scenarios under which selection and the presence of facilitators favor cooperation at the expense of defection , and how these conditions are influenced by the population size and selection intensity .",
    "to understand when the evolutionary dynamics promotes the spread of cooperation , we determine the critical fraction of facilitators in the population above which selection favors the replacement of defection by cooperation , as well as the density of facilitators necessary for selection to favor cooperation invading defection .",
    "we also identify the conditions under which cooperation is more likely to replace defection than vice versa .",
    "the structure of this paper is the following : in the next section , we define the prisoner s dilemma , snowdrift and stag - hunt games in the presence of cooperation facilitators .",
    "section 3 is dedicated to the study of the dynamics in finite populations and to the calculation of the fixation probability .",
    "the circumstances under which selection favors the invasion and the replacement of defection by cooperation are studied in section 4 - 6 .",
    "our conclusions are presented in section 7 .",
    "we study the evolutionary dynamics of two - strategy games , that can be interpreted as social dilemmas , in the presence of cooperation facilitators . more specifically",
    ", we consider a _ finite _ and well - mixed ( spatially homogeneous ) population consisting of @xmath3 individuals , @xmath4 of which are cooperators ( @xmath2 s ) and @xmath5 are defectors ( @xmath1 s ) .",
    "the population is also comprised of a fixed number @xmath6 of `` cooperation facilitators '' that enhance the expected payoff of @xmath7players relative to the average of defectors ( see below )  @xcite . the pairwise interaction between @xmath2 s and @xmath1 s",
    "is embodied in the payoff matrix and we distinguish three classes of games : the ( i ) _ prisoner s dilemma _ ( ii ) _ snowdrift _ , ( iii ) and _ stag - hunt _ games  @xcite .",
    "\\(i ) the paradigmatic model of cooperation dilemma is the _ prisoner s dilemma _ ( pd ) game whose generic features are conveniently captured by the following payoff matrix  @xcite with three parameters : @xmath8 where @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "the parameters @xmath11 and @xmath12 respectively represent the benefit and the cost of cooperation and , in the context of pd games , @xmath13 is referred to as the `` cost - to - benefit ratio ''  @xcite . hence , when one player defects and the other cooperates , the latter is `` exploited '' and receives a payoff @xmath14 while the former gets @xmath11 . the payoff for mutual defection",
    "is given by @xmath15 and can be either non - negative ( @xmath16 ) or negative ( @xmath17 ) , but always less than the payoff ( @xmath18 ) for mutual cooperation and superior to the exploitation payoff ( @xmath14 ) . to simplify our analysis , we shall always consider that @xmath19 are all of order @xmath20 .",
    "defection is the only strict nash equilibrium ( ne ) of the classic ( @xmath21 ) pd games and a cooperation dilemma arises from the fact that each individual favors defection , even though cooperation enhances the overall payoff of the population . in the presence of a fixed number @xmath22 of cooperation facilitators , the expected payoffs of cooperators and defectors ,",
    "respectively @xmath23 , are inferred from ( [ pm_pd ] ) according to the general principles of egt , yielding ( by excluding self - interactions )  @xcite : @xmath24 as facilitators enhance @xmath25 by @xmath26 and @xmath27 by @xmath28 , their presence supports cooperation relative to defection ( since @xmath29 ) , see also ( [ deltapi])-([beta ] ) .",

    "in a population of finite size @xmath3 , the evolutionary dynamics is generally described by a continuous - time birth - death process  @xcite , where at each time step a pair of individuals is randomly drawn to interact and the competition between the strategies , specified by the underlying payoff matrix , is encoded in the transition rates : if one picks a cooperator - defector pair , one of these individuals is randomly chosen for reproduction proportionally to its expected payoff ( or fitness ) and the other is replaced by the newborn offspring . in each elemental move , the population composition evolves from a state with @xmath4 cooperators to a state consisting of @xmath52 individuals of type @xmath2 .",

    "this corresponds to the evolution according to the so - called comparison pairwise `` fermi process '' ( fp )  @xcite , where @xmath61 and @xmath62 respectively denote the cooperators and defectors fitness .",
