    "the theoretical modelling of neutrino - induced coherent pion production in nuclei in the low ( @xmath1 1 gev ) energy region is a quite complicated task .",
    "the reasons are twofold .",
    "first , our limited knowledge of the weak pion production on nucleons at these energies , ( see for instance refs .",
    "@xcite ) , that relies upon conflicting and low statistics bubble chamber experimental data  @xcite .",
    "second , the need of a quantum mechanical treatment of the multiple scattering involving the strong interaction of pions and nucleons that can hardly be accommodated in typical montecarlo approaches .",
    "many different models have been proposed .",
    "some of them are based on the assumption that coherent pion production is dominated by the divergence of the axial current and the use of the partial conservation of the axial current ( pcac ) hypothesis  @xcite .",
    "other works develop a microscopical model for both pion production and distortion assuming that the pion nuclear interaction is dominated by the @xmath2 resonance  @xcite .",
    "thus , they can only be applied at relatively low neutrino energies . despite the large effort dedicated to this process",
    "the situation is hardly satisfactory and large discrepancies are found among different theoretical predictions , both for total and differential cross sections .",
    "besides , the understanding of these processes is very important for the analysis of neutrino oscillation experiments .",
    "for instance charged current ( cc ) coherent pion production is one of the candidate processes responsible for the deficit found by the k2k collaboration in the forward scattering events , which seriously limited the prediction accuracy of the neutrino energy spectrum at the far detector  @xcite .",
    "similarly , neutral current ( nc ) @xmath3 production is one of the largest background sources in muon neutrino experiments , in particular for electron neutrino appearance measurements @xcite , because it can mimic electron events when one of the @xmath3 decay photons is not detected .",
    "a significant part of the @xmath3 s in the forward direction could come from coherent production .",
    "due to its success in the description of cc coherent pion production data at high energies and also its simplicity and easy implementation , the rein - sehgal ( rs ) model of ref .",
    "@xcite has been widely used by experimental collaborations in their analyses @xcite , even at quite low neutrino energies clearly beyond the scope of the original paper .",
    "we should remark that some of the rs model basic approximations are better suited for high energies and heavy nuclei , as this implies more forward peaked cross sections .",
    "in fact , the minimum neutrino energy discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite was 2 gev whereas the model has been used for the analysis of the coherent process at neutrino energies down to the pion production threshold .    when compared to other approaches , which are more reliable for low energy neutrinos",
    ", the differences clearly show up in the total production rate ( see e.g. fig . 2 of ref .",
    "@xcite ) and also in the pion angular or energy distributions ( see fig",
    ". 8 of ref .",
    "@xcite ) . some of the discrepancies , like the wider angular distributions of the pions predicted by the rs model , can be easily traced back to the approximations used in its derivation and they could lead to important consequences in the determination of the size of the pion yield and/or the ratio of coherent to non - coherent pion production for low energy incident neutrinos .",
    "given the deficiencies of the rs model for low neutrino energies , it seems clear the need of the use of alternative approaches .",
    "however , up to our knowledge , the currently available models are of limited value for that purpose . on the one hand ,",
    "the pcac based calculations share many of the limitations of the rs model that will be discussed below . on the other hand ,",
    "the microscopical models based on the @xmath4 dominance are expected to be reliable only for low energy neutrinos ( @xmath5 1 gev ) .",
    "some important steps have been given in the direction of developing a model for pion production on the nucleon beyond the @xmath4 resonance , e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite , but we are still in need of more experimental data ( cross sections ) that could better constrain the little known transition form factors . this is a long term project that will require a collaborative effort of both experimental and theoretical groups .    in the meantime , and lacking a microscopical approach for the whole energy region of interest , it looks worthwhile to try to modify the rs model to extend its applicability towards lower neutrino energies . some recent works in this line include refs .",
    "@xcite which already correct some of the known rs problems . in this work",
    ", we will further explore this possibility .",
    "first , we will carefully study the validity of the main approximations implicit in the rs model , trying to compare with physical observables when that is possible and with microscopical calculations .",
    "second , we will try to elaborate a new improved model by removing the more problematic approximations , while keeping the model still reasonably simple .",
    "last , we will consider the limitations intrinsic to any pcac based approach .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . after some basic formalism in sect .",

    "[ sec : im ] we present our improved model . in sect .",
    "[ sec : pns ] we confront an extension of both models with low energy pion - nucleus scattering data . in sect .",

    "we will focus on nc @xmath3 coherent production off a nucleus in its ground state @xmath6 , @xmath7 the modifications required for the cc case are straightforward .",
    "the process starts with a weak pion ( @xmath3 ) production followed by the strong distortion of the pion in its way out of the nucleus .",
    "the nucleus is left in its ground state unlike the case for incoherent production where the nucleus is either broken or left in some excited state .    defining the four momentum transfer @xmath8 and taking @xmath9 and @xmath10along the positive @xmath11 and @xmath12axis respectively ,",
    "one can write the differential cross section with respect to the outgoing neutrino variables , the mandelstam variable @xmath13 and the pion azimuthal angle , @xmath14 , in the lab system as : @xmath15 with @xmath16 the energy of the final neutrino and @xmath17 the fermi constant . the leptonic tensor is given by : @xmath18 and it is orthogonal to the transferred four momentum @xmath19 . in our convention , we take @xmath20 and the metric @xmath21 .",
    "the hadronic part , @xmath22 , is determined by the matrix element of the nc between the initial and final hadronic states , and it includes all the nuclear effects . introducing the variable @xmath23 , with @xmath24 the incident neutrino energy , we can write @xmath25 where @xmath26 and @xmath27 note that @xmath28 as neither @xmath29 , @xmath30 nor the combinations @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 can depend on @xmath34 .",
    "the only quantity that depends on @xmath34 is @xmath35 .",
    "the latter is not a proper differential cross section as it can take on positive as well as negative values .",
    "besides , it cancels upon integration on @xmath34 ( see below ) .",
    "note also that for @xmath36 only the @xmath37 term contributes .",
    "the tensor @xmath38 , @xmath39 only depends on @xmath19 , @xmath40 ( the four vector of the initial nuclear state , with @xmath41 the nucleus mass ) and @xmath42 . due to the tensorial character of @xmath43 and the fact that , being the transferred momentum @xmath9 aligned with the @xmath11axis , it is invariant under rotations around the @xmath11axis , one can prove @xmath44 thus , integrating in @xmath34 one obtains for the @xmath45 differential cross section  @xcite @xmath46 where @xmath47 as stated above , at @xmath36 only @xmath37 contributes , and given that in this case @xmath48 , one finds that the cross section goes as @xmath49 in other words , in the @xmath36 limit , the lepton tensor of eq .",
    "( [ eq : lep ] ) , turns out to be proportional to @xmath50 and thus , one is left to compute the matrix element of the divergence of the hadronic current .",
    "since the vector nc is conserved , only the divergence of the axial part contributes to the cross section .",
    "pcac can then be used to express the divergence of the axial current in terms of the pion field operator @xmath51 , @xmath52 with @xmath53 mev , the pion decay constant . treating the nucleus as an elementary particle , one can write @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the transition amplitude between the initial hadron state plus a pion of four momentum @xmath19 , and the final hadronic state . using this relation , one obtains @xmath56 and then , neglecting the nucleus recoil @xmath57 , one can further write ( adler s pcac formula  @xcite ) @xmath58 in the @xmath36 limit that we are using @xmath59 and thus @xmath60 with @xmath61 and @xmath62 the nucleon mass . this latter form , eq .",
    "( [ eq : rsnucleo ] ) , was adopted in the original rs model  @xcite .",
    "recently , berger and sehgal  @xcite have proposed to use eq .",
    "( [ eq : rs08 ] ) instead , for finite @xmath63 . to our understanding ,",
    "both choices are somehow arbitrary .",
    "as shown in the derivation , there are several factors of the type @xmath64 , which do not affect the @xmath36 calculation , and that might lead to different corrections far from that limit .",
    "an important remark is in order here .",
    "adler s pcac formula relates the neutrino induced cross section to the off - shell ( @xmath65 ) elastic pion ",
    "nucleus one ( see eqs .",
    "( [ eq : rs07 ] ) , ( [ eq : rs08 ] ) , and ( [ eq : rsnucleo ] ) ) .",
    "it is tempting to neglect off  shell effects and approximate the latter cross section by the experimental one , or by any realistic model for it",
    ". this can be only strictly correct in the case of a pointlike nucleus .",
    "this was firstly pointed out by j.s .",
    "bell shortly after adler proposed his pcac formula .",
    "because of absorption and inelastic collisions , physical pions do not penetrate into the interior of heavy nuclei , and thus the pion - nucleus elastic cross section is only sensitive to the nuclear surface ( roughly it scales as @xmath66 , with @xmath67 the nucleus mass number ) .",
    "but neutrinos penetrate to all parts of nuclei , being then sensitive to the whole nuclear volume ; for them cross sections scale as @xmath67  @xcite .",
    "thus bell expected , that although the on - shell @xmath68 cross section is surface - like , the off - shell ( @xmath36 ) one turned out to be volume - like .",
    "that clearly hints at a non - trivial off - shell behaviour for @xmath68 .",
    "similar arguments were raised and discussed by bernabeu , ericson and jarlskog in the context of muon capture in nuclei  @xcite .    with all these caveats ,",
    "there are cases where approximating the off - shell pion - nucleus cross section by the on - shell one in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : rs07 ] ) , ( [ eq : rs08 ] ) , and ( [ eq : rsnucleo ] ) could be accurate and easily obtained in any good model for pion nuclear scattering .",
    "for instance ,",
    "i ) long wavelength limit : the pion wavelength is larger than the nucleus and it probes the whole nuclear volume ( this in the case of the nuclear beta decay ) , or ii ) short wavelength limit : here the pion interaction is weak and there is little multiple scattering .",
    "practically we have a collection of independent scatterers ( nucleons ) .",
    "this problem has not been taken into account in the recent works of refs .",
    "@xcite , where it is proposed to use the experimental elastic pion - nucleus cross section in the adler s pcac formula at energies where the process is dominated by the weak excitation of the @xmath2 resonance and its subsequent decay into a @xmath69 pair . for resonant energies ,",
    "the pion wavelength is such that it renders doubtful the assumption of a pointlike nucleus , while the pion ",
    "nucleon interaction is sufficiently strong to expect that surface effects due to the distortion of the incoming pion waves , included in the experimental elastic pion - nucleus cross section , might induce inaccuracies in the computation of the weak process .    in order to remove such an effect from the physical @xmath68 one",
    "should rely on a distortion model , for instance the one described below in subsect .",
    "[ sec : out - dist ] . the original model of ref .",
    "@xcite deals with this _ volume - surface _ problem when @xmath70 , the average path length of the pions , is calculated by choosing the path length traversed by pions uniformly produced in the nucleus instead of the path length of pions scattered on the nucleus .",
    "as discussed above , the rein ",
    "sehgal model  @xcite uses the adler s pcac formula  @xcite and approximates the coherent @xmath3 production differential cross section in the laboratory frame by means of eq .",
    "( [ eq : rsnucleo ] ) . besides the neglect of the off",
    " shell @xmath71 effects in the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eq : rsnucleo ] ) , this expression already involves a few approximations , that will not be discussed in this work .",
    "for instance , the final nucleus recoil energy is also neglected , which allows to approximate @xmath72 by the pion energy @xmath73 .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , the expression of eq .",
    "( [ eq : rsnucleo ] ) for neutrino coherent pion production is continued to non  forward lepton directions @xmath74 by attaching a propagator term @xmath75 with @xmath76 gev .",
    "this does not mean that the @xmath63 dependence is merely given by the added propagator term , and in fact it is much more pronounced than that induced by this factor .",
    "this is because large ( and negative ) @xmath63 values are suppressed by the elastic pion  nucleus differential cross section that strongly favours @xmath77 . within the @xmath78 approximation , a zero value for @xmath42 would imply @xmath79 , a kinematical point that can not be reached since @xmath63 is space - like .",
    "thus , the lowest values accessible for @xmath42 must come from the @xmath80 region .",
    "once @xmath81 there are other finite contributions stemming from @xmath82 , @xmath83 and additional pieces of @xmath37 fully disregarded in the rs model .",
    "these contributions come from both the axial and the vector part of the nc .",
    "these further approximations have been , somehow , justified because of the strongly forward peaked character of the process that implies that only quite small values of @xmath63 will be relevant .",
    "this assumption will be discussed later in more detail . in particular , as the contribution of the vector current is neglected , the model predicts equal neutrino and antineutrino cross sections .",
    "next , in ref .",
    "@xcite , the pion  nucleus cross section , with the caveats mentioned above , is expressed in terms of the pion ",
    "nucleon one and then one obtains @xmath84 where @xmath85 is the nuclear form factor which can be calculated as @xmath86 , with the density @xmath87 normalized to the number of protons ( neutrons ) . finally , according to  @xcite , @xmath88 is a @xmath89independent attenuation factor that takes into account effects of the outgoing pion absorption in the nucleus only removes from the flux pions that undergo inelastic collisions but no true pion absorption is actually accounted for by means of this factor  @xcite . ] .    at this point ,",
    "some new approximations have been implemented to estimate the pion - nucleus cross section .",
    "first , the pion",
    " nucleon cross section is evaluated at @xmath77 , namely , in the forward direction .",
    "this can be justified if the nuclear form factor is sufficiently forward peaked .",
    "the larger the pion energy and the heavier the nucleus , the better this approximation becomes . in the original paper  @xcite , eq .",
    "( [ eq : rsnucleon ] ) was employed for a medium size nucleus , aluminum , and neutrino energies above 2 gev , for which the relevant pion energies are quite high . however , as we will show below and it was already pointed out in  @xcite , for neutrino energies below 1 gev and lighter nuclei , like carbon or oxygen , the nuclear form factor is not enough forward peaked to render the finite @xmath89dependence of the pion ",
    "nucleon cross section negligible , and even in the forward direction the @xmath42 value is not close enough to zero .",
    "second , the distortion factor @xmath90 is an oversimplification since in any realistic scattering model this factor should depend on @xmath42 .",
    "there exist sophisticated microscopical calculations of the neutrino coherent @xmath3 production off nuclei based on the dominance of the @xmath2 resonance  @xcite .",
    "however , these are difficult to extend for the higher neutrino energies present in the current experiments and to implement in monte carlo algorithms .",
    "actually , one of the virtues of the rs model is its simplicity , that allows its use for different nuclei and pion energies .",
    "this is one of the reasons why the rs model has been widely used .",
    "we propose here a minimal extension of the model in which we implement two main corrections .",
    "firstly , we will take into account the @xmath89dependence of the pion - nucleon cross section when computing the pion - nucleus scattering , and secondly we will work out a more realistic description of the outgoing pion distortion n elementary cross section , as the product of a nuclear form factor ( defined as the fourier transform of the density ) and a distortion factor .",

    "finally , we would like to point out that it is not clear why one should use @xmath101 in the distortion profile .",
    "indeed , within the eikonal approximation one should use the imaginary part of a realistic pion - nucleus optical potential  @xcite . this would eliminate those pions that are absorbed , undergo quasielastic processes or suffer inelastic reactions , taking into account pauli blocking , fermi motion and other many  body effects to evaluate the corresponding reaction probabilities .",

    "it is true that in this way , we do neither account for pion absorption nor for pion quasielastic distortion ( induced by pion  nucleon elastic scattering ) .",

    "far from @xmath36 , pcac based models just consider the axial part of the current , that given the tiny effect of the vector part in the microscopical model ( as can be seen by comparing `` v  a @xmath171 '' and `` only @xmath173 '' microscopic results ) , it turns out to be an excellent approximation here .",

    "distortion reduction is significantly larger in the rs and rs@xmath163 models than in our scheme .",
    "that diminishes the differences in the full calculation in carbon , and explains the reverse pattern observed in calcium .",
    "note , however , that the pion distortion in the rs and rs@xmath163 schemes is too strong .",
    "indeed , it leads to forward pion - nucleus elastic cross sections smaller than both data and those deduced within our framework , as can be appreciated in fig .",
    "[ fig:2im ] . in spite of that , both the rs and rs * models still overestimate the microscopical calculation in carbon by a large factor .",
    "on the other hand , the situation is somehow puzzling when we compare microscopical results with those of model i or ii . as discussed above , within the pw approximation both types of approach nicely",
    "agree , but distorted results notably disagree .",
    "this is despite the fact that the klein  gordon @xmath141hole model , in which the microscopical results depicted in fig .  [",
    "fig : figq2bis ] are based , leads to elastic pion nucleus cross sections of similar quality as those deduced from the eikonal framework developed here , and that our model i and ii use ( see for instance the comparison performed in the right top panel of fig .",
    "[ fig:2im ] for a typical pion energy ) .",
    "this contradiction deserves some discussion , and we believe it is related to the inadequacy of the use of eikonal distortion for low energy pions and to the modifications of the @xmath4 resonance properties in the nuclear medium .    describing correctly the elastic pion ",

    "however , that constraint is not sufficient , and the situation in fig .",
    "[ fig : figq2bis ] is an example of that .",
    "one of the major sources of differences between our model of eq .",
    "( [ eq : pin ] ) and the microscopic calculation is due to in - medium modifications of the free pion - nucleon cross section in the latter case ( see for instance ref .",
    "@xcite ) . within the eikonal model assumed here to construct the elastic pion - nucleus cross section",
    ", there are two competing factors : the pion  nucleon elastic non spin flip @xmath187 cross section and the pion distortion , controlled by @xmath188 . as a consequence , the pion ",
    "nucleus scattering amplitude does not linearly depend on the corresponding pion ",
    "nucleon one .",
    "that explains why different approaches for the in medium pion  nucleon amplitude could lead to similar pion - nucleus cross sections .",
    "for instance , let us suppose that in medium modifications reduce ( enhance ) the pion ",
    "nucleon cross sections .",
    "we have that pion distortion effects become less ( more ) important with decreasing ( increasing ) @xmath188 and this reduced ( enhanced ) suppression can compensate a decrease ( an enhancement ) in @xmath187 .",
    "the outcome is that you can predict similar pion - nucleus cross sections starting from quite different pion - nucleon cross sections .",
    "it seems that induced differences in the pion distortion compensate the changes due to the medium in the elastic pion - nucleon cross section in pion - nucleus scattering , but not in neutrino induced coherent pion production where distortion becomes smaller and affects only the outgoing pion .    for low energy pions , of interest in miniboone and t2k ,",
    "we believe that the distorted results from the microscopical models of refs .  @xcite are more realistic that those based on the eikonal approximation presented here , where the pion - nucleon interaction is not modified in the medium and a simple model based on @xmath101 is used to distort the outgoing pion waves . the framework of ref .",
    "@xcite , despite the use of the eikonal approximation , greatly overcomes these shortcomings , since there , the modification of the @xmath4 properties in the medium are taken into account , and the imaginary part of a realistic pion - nucleus optical potential is used to distort the outgoing pion .",
    "the model becomes as complicated as that of refs .",
    "@xcite , as difficult as this latter one to extrapolate at higher pion energies , and it is still less reliable , since multiple scattering is not taken into account within the eikonal approximation as accurately as by solving the klein gordon equation  @xcite .      for nc driven processes ,",
    "the @xmath63 distribution can not be easily measured because of the obvious difficulty in detecting the outgoing neutrino or the nucleus recoil .",
    "thus , it is of great interest to examine pion distributions .      in fig .",
    "[ fig : figepi ] , we show the outgoing pion spectrum from oxygen , with and without distortion effects , predicted by the different models considered in the previous subsection .",
    "the incoming neutrino energy is 0.65 gev .",

    "we see once more that , for the case without distortion , our model ii has a reasonable agreement with the `` v  a @xmath171 '' and `` only @xmath189 '' microscopic calculations .",
    "not only the shapes , which peak at around @xmath190mev , but also the integrated cross sections are similar ( see the table ) . again",
    "the rs and rs@xmath163 models give much larger results and the position of the peak is slightly displaced towards lower energies .    in the distortion case",
    "we find totally different behaviours .",
    "results obtained with our models i and ii show a shape similar to the case without distortion , while the rs and rs@xmath163 calculations show a double peak structure . in the microscopical calculation a single peak appears , but now at a lower pion energy @xmath191mev .",
    "this change in the position of the peak in the microscopical results can be traced to the modification of the properties of the @xmath4 in the medium and to nonlocal effects in the amplitude ( see for instance fig .",
    "2a in ref .",
    "these non - localities reflect the fact that the pion three - momentum is only well defined asymptotically when the pion - nucleus potential vanishes  @xcite .",
    "these effects are neither present in any pcac based model where one uses the free - space pion nucleon cross sections , nor in any microscopic calculation with plane waves .    at low and intermediate neutrino energies ,",
    "once the distortion is considered , we must again conclude that the microscopic model predictions are most reliable than those deduced from the pcac based model examined here .",
    "the original rs predictions have little reliability and the hope is that at higher energies , where we expect nuclear medium modifications of the elementary pion ",

    "<S> last , we have discussed the limitations intrinsic to any approach based on the partial conservation of the axial current hypothesis . in particular , we have shown the inability of such models to determine the angular distribution of the outgoing pion with respect to the direction of the incoming neutrino , except for the @xmath0 kinematical point . </S>"
