    "one of the first steps in the stability analysis of an equilibrium of a rational difference equation is to determine its local stability .",
    "this has traditionally been done by first linearizing the rational difference equation and then evaluating the jacobian of the linearized equation at the equilibrium . if both eigenvalues of the jacobian lie inside the unit circle , then the equilibrium is said to be locally asymptotically stable .",
    "if one eigenvalue lies inside the unit circle and the second eigenvalue lies outside the unit circle , then the equilibrium is said to be a saddle point .",
    "if both eigenvalues lie outside the unit circle , then the equilibrium is said to be unstable . and",
    "if an eigenvalue lies on the unit circle , then the equilibrium is said to be non - hyperbolic .",
    "but a practical problem often arises when the linearized stability analysis method of determining local stability of equilibria is applied to systems of rational difference equations .",
    "the equilibria of even simple first - order systems of two rational difference equations often turn out to be roots of quartic polynomials .",
    "although it is possible to calculate the explicit formulas for such equilibria using , for example , ferrari s method , such formulas are extremely complicated . as a result , the formulas for eigenvalues of the jacobian of the linearized equation evaluated at such equilibria are extremely complicated .",
    "in fact , one simply can not use them to check algebraically whether the eigenvalues lie inside the unit circle or not , due to computational problems .",
    "thus in such cases , the only known tool for performing local stability analysis on systems of difference equations , namely , the linearized stability analysis method , is rendered useless .    in such cases ,",
    "the natural question to ask is : can we still say something about the stability of equilibria with extremely complicated algebraic formulas ? in this paper , we show that for certain subclasses of systems of two rational difference equations , one can actually give a complete global analysis of the equilibria by focussing exclusively on geometric properties of the critical curves of the system rather than on explicit algebraic formulas for the equilibria .",
    "we present a brand new result that establishes the connection between the number of equilibria of a system of two rational difference equations and the stability of those equilibria .",
    "we achieve this by establishing a relationship between the natures of the eigenvalues of the jacobian of the linearized equation evaluated at an equilibrium and the slopes of the critical curves of the system at that equilibrium .",
    "finally , we use this result to give a qualitative analysis of the global behavior of solutions to a leslie - gower - type system of two rational difference equations .",
    "the study of dynamics of difference equations often requires that equilibria be calculated first , followed by a local stability analysis of the equilibria .",
    "this is then complemented by other considerations ( existence of periodic points , chaotic orbits , etc . ) .",
    "if the analysis is applied to a class of equations dependent on one or more real parameters , the task is complicated by the fact that a formula is not always available for equilibria , and even if it is , determination of stability properties of parameter - dependent equilibria may be a daunting task .    in this paper",
    "we address the study of stability character of equilibria for a parameter dependent class of systems of difference equations . for this",
    "we develop local geometric criteria for planar systems of difference equations , which under certain conditions determine local stability character of an equilibrium point .",
    "this idea is used to study a class of difference equations in the plane , for which we show that the _ number of equilibria determines , essentially in a unique way , the local stability character of the equilibria , as well as the kind of global dynamics that is possible_.    the class of difference equations we will focus on has its roots in biology applications .",
    "the leslie - gower model in difference equations is the two - species competition model @xmath1 it is a modified version of the beverton - holt equation which is a well - known difference equation in population biology .",
    "the normalized leslie - gower model @xmath2 was studied in detail by liu and elaydi @xcite , j. cushing et .",
    "al @xcite , and kulenovi and merino @xcite .",
    "in this paper we consider the system of equations obtained by adding positive constants to the right - hand - side of the leslie - gower equations : @xmath3 the positive constants @xmath4 and @xmath5 in ( lgi ) may account for immigration .",
    "the change of variables @xmath6 , @xmath7 normalizes ( lgi ) as follows : @xmath8 where in ( lgin ) the tildes have been removed from the variables to simplify notation , and @xmath9    the system ( lgin ) is an example of a _ competitive system _ , which is defined next .",

    "the term _ competitive _ was introduced by hirsch @xcite ( see also @xcite ) for systems of autonomous differential equations @xmath24 , @xmath25 satisfying @xmath26 . the main motivation for the study of these systems is the fact that many mathematical models in biological sciences may be classified as competitive ( or cooperative ) @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",

    "may be defined in terms of the order preserving properties of the maps .",
    "finally we note that the terms _ equilibrium _ ( of a planar system of difference equations ) and _ fixed point _ ( of a map ) are used interchangeably in this paper .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : a result ] a relation between local stability of equilibria and slopes of critical curves for a specific class of difference equations is established . in section [ sec : preliminaries ] it is shown that every solution to eq.(lgin ) converges to an equilibrium .",

    "<S> if there are three equilibria , then they are linearly ordered in the south - east ordering of the plane , and consist of a local attractor , a saddle point , and another local attractor . finally , we give sufficient conditions for having a unique equilibrium . </S>",
