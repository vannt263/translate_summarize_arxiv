    "this section is devoted to study the efficiency of the decision tree algorithm described in the main text .",
    "some results in this section are analytical and some are numerical . in all our numerical investigations (",
    "unless explicitly stated otherwise ) we used the decision tree of the main text ( for two qubits ) and in cases when going through the whole tree did not reveal entanglement we augmented it with additional measurements of those correlations which were not performed until that moment .",
    "the order of the additional measurements also results from the correlation complementarity ( anti - commutation relations )  @xcite . with every remaining measurement we associate the `` priority '' parameter @xmath110 that depends on the measured correlation tensor elements of the decision tree in the following way",
    "@xmath111 according to the correlation complementarity there is a bigger chance that this correlation is significant if the value of the corresponding parameter is small .",
    "therefore , the correlations @xmath112 with lower values of @xmath113 are measured first .",
    "let us consider the following example .",
    "the measured correlations of the decision tree are as follows : @xmath114 , @xmath115 , and @xmath116",
    ". therefore , @xmath117 , @xmath118 , and @xmath119 .",
    "accordingly the order of the remaining measurements is as follows : first measure @xmath52 , then @xmath120 , next @xmath121 and @xmath122 .",
    "consider a family of states @xmath123 where @xmath124 is the bell singlet state , @xmath125 describes the completely mixed state of white noise , and @xmath126 is a probability .",
    "its correlation tensor , written in the same coordinate system for alice and bob , is diagonal with entries @xmath127 , arising from the contribution of the entangled state .",
    "the states ( [ werner_state ] ) are entangled if and only if @xmath128 , whereas the decision tree reveals that these states are entangled for @xmath129 .",
    "this is because only three elements contribute to the criterion .",
    "note that the value of the decision parameter is irrelevant here .",
    "furthermore , a random choice of local coordinate directions does not help .",
    "although more steps would be involved in the decision tree the sum of squared correlations is invariant under local unitary operations and therefore only for @xmath130 entanglement is detected for the werner state .      an exemplary class of density operators for which the decision tree detects all entangled states",
    "is provided by : @xmath131 where entanglement is mixed with colored noise @xmath132 bringing anti - correlations along local @xmath46 axes .",
    "this state has the following non - vanishing elements of its correlation tensor @xmath133 and @xmath134 .",
    "therefore , the decision tree allows detection of entanglement for this class of states in two steps .",
    "note that the state is entangled already for an infinitesimal admixture of the bell singlet state as can be shown for a random choice of local coordinate systems .",
    "[ si_fig_random_mixed ] shows how the efficiency of the algorithm grows with the purity of tested states .",
    "the efficiency is measured by the fraction of detected entangled states obtained from extensive monte carlo sampling in the two qubit state space . for nine steps",
    "the algorithm detects all the pure states .",
    "this is expected because eq .",
    "( 1 ) of the main text is a necessary and sufficient condition for the detection of entanglement of pure states .",
    "the principle behind the decision tree is the correlation complementarity  @xcite .",
    "correlation complementarity states that for a set of dichotomic anti - commuting operators @xmath135 the following trade - off relation is satisfied by all physical states : @xmath136 where @xmath137 is the average value of observable @xmath138 and so on . therefore , if one of the average values is maximal , @xmath139 , the other anti - commuting observables have vanishing averages .",
    "this motivates taking only sets of commuting operators as different branches of the decision tree .",
    "a numerical simulation reveals that the correlation measurement along local bloch vectors gives correlations close to the maximal correlations of a pure multi - qubit state in more than @xmath53 of the cases .",
    "therefore , these local directions give an excellent starting point of the decision tree .",
    "exemplarily , the branch begins with @xmath97 assuming that this correlation is big . if the local bloch vectors indicate correlation along a different directions it is advantageous to correspondingly change the elements of the decision tree ( see main text ) ."

    "<S> we introduce an experimental procedure for the detection of quantum entanglement of an unknown quantum state with a small number of measurements . </S>",
    "<S> the method requires neither a priori knowledge of the state nor a shared reference frame between the observers and can thus be regarded as a perfectly state independent entanglement witness . </S>",
    "<S> the scheme starts with local measurements , possibly supplemented with suitable filtering , which essentially establishes the schmidt decomposition for pure states . </S>",
    "<S> alternatively we develop a decision tree which reveals entanglement within few steps . </S>",
    "<S> these methods are illustrated and verified experimentally for various entangled states of two and three qubits .    _ </S>",
    "<S> introduction._entanglement is the distinguishing feature of quantum mechanics and it is the most important resource for quantum information processing @xcite . for any experiment </S>",
    "<S> it is thus of utmost importance to easily reveal entanglement , best with as little effort as possible . </S>",
    "<S> common methods suffer from disadvantages . </S>",
    "<S> on the one hand , employing the peres - horodecki criterion @xcite or evaluating entanglement measures , one can identify entanglement in arbitrary states , however , it requires full state tomography . on the other hand , various entanglement witnesses @xcite can be determined with much fewer measurements but give conclusive answers only if the state under investigation is close to the witness - state , i.e. , they require a priori knowledge .    </S>",
    "<S> recently , it has been shown that the existence of entanglement can be inferred from analyzing correlations between the measurement results on the subsystems of a quantum state . </S>",
    "<S> only if the state is entangled , the properly weighted sum of correlations will overcome characteristic thresholds @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> here we further develop this approach to obtain a simple and practical method to detect entanglement of all pure states and some mixed states by measuring only a small number of correlations . </S>",
    "<S> since the method is adaptive it does not require a priori knowledge of the state nor a shared reference frame between the possibly remote observers and thus greatly simplifies the practical application . </S>",
    "<S> we describe two schemes where the first one essentially can be seen as a direct implementation of schmidt decomposition , which identifies the maximal correlation directly . for bipartite </S>",
    "<S> pure systems , this approach can conceptually be divided into two stages : ( i ) calibration that establishes the experimental schmidt decomposition @xcite of a pure state by local measurements and suitable filtering and ( ii ) two correlation measurements to verify the entanglement criterion . the second scheme shows how to use a decision tree to obtain a rapid violation of the threshold thereby identifying entanglement .    </S>",
    "<S> _ entanglement criterion._for a two - qubit quantum state @xmath0 , alice and bob observe correlations between their local pauli measurements @xmath1 and @xmath2 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> they are defined as the expectation values of the product of the two measurements , @xmath3 $ ] , with the so called correlation tensor elements @xmath4 $ ] . the local values @xmath5 </S>",
    "<S> ( @xmath6 ) , with @xmath7 being the identity operator , form the local bloch vector of alice ( bob ) . using these measurements a sufficient condition for entanglement can be formulated as @xcite : @xmath8 for pure states this is also a necessary condition , while for mixed states care has to be taken . </S>",
    "<S> for those the likelihood for detecting the entanglement decreases with purity . </S>",
    "<S> an extension of ( [ simple_crit ] ) can generally identify entanglement of an arbitrary mixed state , however , then loosing the state independence @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> note two important facts . </S>",
    "<S> first , eq .   can be seen as a state independent entanglement witness derived without any specific family of entangled states in mind . </S>",
    "<S> second , to test whether the state is entangled , it is sufficient to break the threshold , i.e. , it is neither required to measure all correlations nor to compute the density matrix . ) </S>",
    "<S> generally scales as the one for full state tomography , we can directly evaluate the criterion from raw data without any further numerics required to reconstruct a physical density matrix @xcite ] rather , it is now the goal to find strategies which minimize the number of correlation measurements . </S>",
    "<S> we show how this can be done by a particularly designed decision tree , or by identifying a schmidt decomposition from local results and filtering when necessary .    _ </S>",
    "<S> schmidt decomposition._consider pure two qubit states . any such state has a schmidt decomposition @xmath9 , \\label{schmidt}\\ ] ] where the coefficients are real and the local bases @xmath10 and </S>",
    "<S> @xmath11 are called the schmidt bases . </S>",
    "<S> once the bases are known , alice constructs her local measurements @xmath12 and @xmath13 , and so does bob in analogy </S>",
    "<S> . they can now detect entanglement with only _ _ </S>",
    "<S> t__wo correlation measurements because @xmath14 for all pure entangled states . </S>",
    "<S> note , the laboratories are not required to share a common reference frame .    in order to extract the schmidt bases from experimental data </S>",
    "<S> one starts with local measurements , determining the local bloch vectors @xmath15 of alice ( bob ) ( those elements are related to the correlation tensor coefficients via @xmath16 ) . </S>",
    "<S> we consider two cases . </S>",
    "<S> first , suppose that a pure state has non - vanishing local bloch vectors . </S>",
    "<S> their directions define the schmidt bases of alice and bob up to a global phase @xmath17 . </S>",
    "<S> writing these bases in the computational basis @xmath18 we see that the required coefficients can be inferred directly from the local bloch vectors , @xmath19 on alice s side , and similarly for bob . </S>",
    "<S> the global phase of @xmath20 shows up as the relative phase in the decomposition ( [ schmidt ] ) , i.e. @xmath21 ( with @xmath22 ) . </S>",
    "<S> it can be determined , for example , from the @xmath23 correlation as @xmath24 . if bob would use the basis @xmath25 to build his observables @xmath26 and @xmath27 , the corresponding correlations @xmath28 would vanish for @xmath29 and the two measurements @xmath30 and @xmath31 would not suffice to detect entanglement . in such a case , however , the other two correlations , @xmath32 and @xmath33 , are non - zero , and can be used to reveal entanglement . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the determination of @xmath17 in the calibration is not essential if one accepts possibly one more correlation measurement .    </S>",
    "<S> second , in case of vanishing local bloch vectors , the pure state under consideration @xmath34 is maximally entangled and admits infinitely many schmidt decompositions . in order to truly prove entanglement bob </S>",
    "<S> can thus freely choose some basis , say computational basis , for which the state will now be of the form @xmath35 . </S>",
    "<S> the basis of alice can be found after _ filtering _ by bob in his schmidt basis : @xmath36 ( for an actual implementation see experimental section ) . when bob informs alice that his detector behind the filter clicked , the initial state becomes @xmath37 note that due to filtering a nonvanishing local bloch vector emerges for alice . </S>",
    "<S> thus the respective schmidt basis can be found with the method described above and be used for the evaluation of @xmath38 .     </S>",
    "<S> directions randomly and independently , which effectively gives rise to a basis @xmath39 } for alice and @xmath40 for bob ( not detailed in the figure or the main text ) . </S>",
    "<S> the scheme starts with measuring @xmath41 and follows at each step along the dashed arrow if the modulus of correlation is less than @xmath42 and along the continuous arrow otherwise . </S>",
    "<S> the algorithm succeeds as soon as @xmath43 . </S>",

    "<S> alice and bob choose three orthogonal local directions @xmath47 and @xmath46 independently from each other and agree to only measure correlations along these directions . in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig_dt ] we show exemplarily which correlations should be measured in order to detect entanglement in a small number of steps . starting with a measurement of @xmath41 , one continues along the solid ( dotted ) arrow , if the correlation is higher ( lower ) than some threshold value ( e.g. 1/2 in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig_dt ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> the tree is based on the principle of correlation complementarity @xcite : in quantum mechanics there exist trade - offs for the knowledge of dichotomic observables with corresponding anti - commuting operators . for this reason , </S>",
    "<S> if the correlation @xmath48 is big , correlations @xmath49 and @xmath50 have to be small because their corresponding operators anti - commute with the operator @xmath51 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the next significant correlations have to lie in the @xmath52 plane of the correlation tensor and thus the tree continues with a measurement of the @xmath23 correlation . </S>",
    "<S> this concept can be generalized to multiqubit states , a decision tree for three qubits is given in the appendix . </S>",
    "<S> the number of detected states grows with the number of steps through the decision tree . </S>",
    "<S> since condition ( 1 ) is similar to the purity of a state , obviously , the scheme succeeds the faster the more pure a state is ( see appendix for detailed analysis ) . </S>",
    "<S> varying the threshold value does not lead to any significant changes in the statistic of detected states .    finally , we connect both methods discussed here for the analysis of multiqubit states . </S>",
    "<S> a numerical simulation for pure states reveals that the correlation measurement along local bloch vectors gives correlations close to the maximal correlations in more than @xmath53 of the cases . </S>",

    "<S> experiment._ for the demonstration of these new simple analysis methods we first use two photon polarization entangled states . in the following we will thus replace the computational basis states by horizontal ( @xmath56 ) and vertical ( @xmath57 ) linear polarization , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the photon source ( see fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ source ] ) is based on the process of spontaneous parametric down conversion ( spdc ) using a pair of crossed type i cut @xmath58-barium - borate ( bbo ) crystals pumped by a cw laser diode at a wavelength of @xmath59 nm with linear polarization of @xmath60 . </S>",
    "<S> it emits pairs of horizontally and vertically polarized photons which superpose to the state @xmath61 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the spectral bandwidth of the photons is reduced to @xmath62 nm using interference filters and two spatial emission modes are selected by coupling the photon pairs into two separate single mode fibers .    for the purpose of preparing any pure two - qubit state </S>",
    "<S> , the polarization of each photon can be rotated individually by a set of quarter- ( qwp ) and half ( hwp ) waveplates in each mode . by tilting an yttrium vanadate crystal ( yvo@xmath54 ) in front of the bbos , the relative phase @xmath55 between the photon pairs can be set . </S>",
    "<S> additionally , the state can be made asymmetric by removing a portion of vertically polarized light in one spatial mode with a brewster plate ( bp ) . in the last step of the experiment , </S>",
    "<S> the polarization of each photon is analyzed with additional half- and quarter waveplates and projection on @xmath63 and @xmath64 using a polarizing beam splitter ( pbs ) . </S>",
    "<S> the local filtering of a maximally entangled state can be accomplished by placing a brewster plate in front of the analysis waveplates . </S>",
    "<S> this brewster plate reflects with a certain probability vertically polarized photons and together with detection of a photon behind the brewster plate implements the filtering operation ( [ filtering ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> finally , the photons are detected by fiber - coupled single photon detectors connected to a coincidence logic .    _ </S>",

    "<S> the protocol starts with alice and bob locally measuring the polarization of the photons enabling them to individually determine the local bloch vectors . for high efficiencies , e.g. , possible in experiments with atoms or ions , the local measurements can indeed be done independently . and @xmath65 . </S>",
    "<S> ] if nonvanishing local bloch vectors can be identified , one can proceed to the next step . </S>",
    "<S> for the example here , the local expectation values are close to zero and filtering has to be applied . by using a brewster plate in front of bob s analysis waveplate and under the condition that the filtering operation is successful , local bloch vectors emerge ( see fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ schmidtsym]b ) , in this case we obtain @xmath66 and @xmath67 .    in the next step alice and </S>",
    "<S> bob use their local bloch vectors to realign their analyzers to the new local schmidt bases @xmath68 , @xmath69 and @xmath70 , @xmath71 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> this diagonalizes the correlation tensor as depicted in figure [ schmidtsym]c ) . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , it is only necessary to measure @xmath72 and @xmath73 to prove entanglement since @xmath74 . </S>",
    "<S> hence , @xmath75 _ local _ measurements are needed in the first step of the algorithm , if necessary three combined measurements are needed for filtering , and finally only two correlation measurements have to be performed for entanglement detection .        </S>",
    "<S> _ application of the decision tree._ in order to demonstrate the application of the decision tree we will apply it to three states . for the first state @xmath76 , whose correlation tensor is depicted in [ hhvvandrrll]a ) the decision tree ( see fig .

    "<S> consequently , the next steps according to our algorithm ( fig .

    "<S> the local bloch vectors suggest that the correlation @xmath97 is big . </S>",

    "<S> the decision tree is the same as above but with local axes renamed as follows @xmath106 . </S>",
