    "at high @xmath3 ( or @xmath4 ) collider energies about 40% of the total cross section @xmath5 comes from diffractive processes , like elastic scattering or single- or double - diffractive dissociation . besides their interest in their own right",
    ", there are several other practical reasons why it is important to study diffractive processes .",
    "first , we need to understand the structure of @xmath5 and the nature of the underlying events which accompany the sought - after rare hard processes .",
    "second , we must be able to estimate the probability that rapidity gaps , which occur in diffractive events containing a hard subprocess , survive rescattering effects  that is , survive the population of the gaps by secondary particles from the underlying event . recall that hard  diffraction processes are a means of suppressing the background , for example , in searches for signals of new physics .",
    "thirdly , studies of diffractive processes should help in understanding the structure of high energy cosmic ray phenomena .",
    "finally , we wish to be able to reliably extrapolate the @xmath3 elastic differential cross section @xmath6 to the optical point @xmath7 so as to make a luminosity measurement at the lhc .",
    "indeed the early low luminosity runs of the lhc should provide a wealth of information on diffractive interactions at small momentum transfer , which will enable asymptotic @xmath8 predictions to be severely tested .",
    "such small-@xmath9 processes are generically called _ soft _ interactions .",
    "the luminosity measurement is based on the optical theorem ( neglecting coulomb effects ) [ eq : a1 ] .",
    "|_t = 0 = ( 1 + ^2 ) .",
    "the ratio @xmath10 of the real to the imaginary part of the elastic amplitude is small at tevatron and lhc energies @xmath11 , and a dispersion relation estimate is sufficiently accurate for @xmath10 not to cause a problem .",
    "thus if we measure the number of events corresponding to the elastic and to the total cross sections then we may determine both the luminosity @xmath12 and @xmath5 ( since @xmath13 , whereas @xmath14 ) .",
    "the main difficulty is that , at the lhc , we will have to extrapolate elastic data from , say , @xmath15 to @xmath7 .",
    "it is found , from measurements at isr , s@xmath4s and tevatron energies , that the local  slope [ eq : a2 ] b ( t ) = depends on @xmath9 .",
    "the effect is not negligible .",
    "for example , at @xmath16  gev @xcite [ eq : a3 ] b ( 0 ) - b ( |t| = 0.2  gev^2 ) 2  gev^-2 . here",
    "we will study such effects .",
    "it is important to pay special attention to the periphery of the proton , in impact parameter , @xmath17 , space .",
    "first , large values of @xmath17 are responsible for the small @xmath9 behaviour of the amplitude .",
    "second , the large @xmath17 region , where the optical density ( or opacity ) , @xmath18 , becomes small , gives the major contribution to the survival probability of rapidity gaps .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows . in section",
    "2 we very briefly recall the role of the pomeron in describing high energy soft interactions . then in section  3 we list the essential ingredients to be embodied in a model for the pomeron .",
    "we present an old , but important , result @xcite which gives the effect of pion - loop insertions on the pomeron trajectory .",
    "section  4 discusses the form of the pomeron - proton vertex and incorporates screening corrections in the model .",
    "all the above effects leads to a @xmath9 dependence of the elastic slope parameter @xmath19 of ( [ eq : a2 ] ) . for pedagogic reasons ,",
    "it is informative to first attempt a preliminary description of the @xmath3 total cross section and @xmath6 data using a model which embodies the above effects but which , for the moment , neglects the effects of high - mass diffraction dissociation .",
    "the comparison of this incomplete pomeron model with the data is also described in section  4 .",
    "then in section  5 we discuss the inclusion of diffractive dissociation in the analysis .",
    "section  6 presents the resulting , much more complete , theoretical description of the data .",
    "predictions of soft phenomena at lhc energies are made .",
    "section  7 describes the calculation of the probabilities that the rapidity gaps , which occur in various diffractive processes , survive the effects of rescattering .",
    "section  8 contains our conclusions and summarises some of the predictions for soft processes at the lhc .",
    "to introduce our approach , it is helpful to first briefly recall salient points in the long history of the description of elastic and diffractive scattering at small momentum transfer .",
    "the high energy behaviour of scattering amplitudes in the small @xmath9 domain is described by regge theory ( see , for example , ref .",
    "@xcite ) , that is by the singularities of the amplitudes in the complex angular momentum , @xmath20 , plane . the simplest possibility is to assume that , _ at high energy _ ,",
    "the diffractive processes are driven by an isolated pole at @xmath21 , which gives an elastic amplitude [ eq : a4 ] a ( s , t ) s^(t ) , and a total cross section [ eq : a5 ] _ tot s^(0 ) - 1 .",
    "the pole with the largest intercept , originally with @xmath22 , was called the pomeron . here",
    "we are interested in energies @xmath23 which are sufficiently large to be able to neglect all secondary trajectories ( with intercepts of @xmath24 ) .",
    "the pomeron is shown in fig .",
    "1(a ) by the double line , which is exchanged in the @xmath9-channel in @xmath3 elastic scattering .",
    "however this description is too simplified .",
    "the imposition of @xmath25-channel unitarity generates multi - pomeron cuts from the pole in the @xmath20-plane .",
    "first , iterations of the pole amplitude via elastic unitarity gives contributions of the type shown in fig .",
    "if we take account of the possibility of proton excitations @xmath26 in intermediate states , then we must include contributions such as that in fig .",
    "furthermore , the excitation into higher mass @xmath27 states is described by the triple - pomeron graph of fig .",
    "1(d ) for single diffractive dissociation ( with cross section @xmath28 ) and by fig .",
    "1(e ) for double diffractive dissociation @xmath29 .",
    "in addition to fig .",
    "1(d ) , there is an equal contribution @xmath28 from dissociation of the lower proton only .",
    "the contributions of graphs 1(b  e ) are not negligible .",
    "indeed , from the agk cutting rules @xcite we estimate the correction to fig .",
    "1(a ) to be [ eq : a6 ] ( _ el + 2 _ sd + _",
    "dd)/_tot ~ 0.4 at tevatron / lhc energies , which is consistent with the tevatron data .",
    "of course , it is possible to consider an effective or phenomenological pomeron - pole amplitude which includes , in an average sense , all the cuts shown in figs .",
    "1(b  e ) .",
    "indeed , it has been demonstrated , by donnachie and landshoff @xcite , that a simple pole with trajectory [ eq : a7 ] _ eff ( t ) = 1.08 + 0.25  t ( with @xmath9 in gev@xmath30 ) provides a good description of the total and elastic differential cross section data up to the tevatron energy .",
    "however in this case we can not use the pomeron  to calculate the survival probability @xmath31 of the rapidity gaps or the small @xmath9 behaviour of the elastic slope @xmath32 of ( [ eq : a2 ] ) .",
    "the survival probability @xmath33 is small since secondary particles produced in the inelastic interaction fill the gap , with probability @xmath34 .",
    "the difficulty is that the effective pomeron  describes a @xmath3 amplitude , with an elastic and inelastic component , where the latter component includes diffractive dissociation .",
    "elastic rescattering does not populate the gap and , unfortunately , the effective pole  picture does not quantify the size of the dissociation component .",
    "another problem of the effective pole description concerns the @xmath9 ( or @xmath17 ) dependence of the elastic amplitude .",
    "each component of the elastic amplitude shown in fig .",
    "1 has its own characteristic @xmath9 dependence .",
    "for example , if the amplitude for fig .",
    "1(a ) has the form @xmath35 , then the amplitude for the two - pomeron part of fig .",
    "1(b ) has a flatter @xmath9 dependence of the form @xmath36 .",
    "it was discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite that the part of @xmath6 , which is generated via the optical theorem from diffractive dissociation , should have a larger @xmath9-slope since it corresponds mainly to the large @xmath17 or peripheral part of the interaction .",
    "these effects are important in the computation of the @xmath9 dependence of the slope @xmath19 of ( [ eq : a2 ] ) , as well as for the estimation of survival probability @xmath31 .",
    "unfortunately , to our knowledge , no way has been found to sum up all the regge graphs and to solve regge field theory .",
    "here we construct a model of the pomeron which , at the very least , accounts for the most important effects .",
    "we incorporate    * @xmath25-channel unitarity with elastic and a low mass @xmath27 intermediate state via a 2-channel eikonal approach ( using a representative effective low mass proton excitation @xmath37 ) , * high - mass @xmath27 single- and double - dissociation via figs .",
    "1(d ) and 1(e ) @xcite .",
    "thus we anticipate that graphs that are higher order in the triple - pomeron vertex may be neglected .",
    "] , * the nearest @xmath9-channel singularity , that is the two - pion loop .    in high energy soft  strong interactions we deal with two different hadronic scales .",
    "one is given by the mass of the pion and controls the periphery of the proton  the so - called pion cloud  see ( iii ) above .",
    "due to the pseudo - goldstone nature of the pion , this scale @xmath38 is rather small .",
    "for the same reason , pion exchange is not the most important part of the interaction amplitude . at small distances",
    "the interaction is controlled by a scale @xmath39  gev representative of the other hadron masses  gev may be associated with the effective  gluon mass or with the instanton size .",
    "other arguments in favour of a small gluon - gluon correlation length @xmath40 ( or scale @xmath41  gev ) can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite . ] .",
    "long ago , anselm and gribov @xcite argued that the pomeron is built up from both the small and large scale components .",
    "the large scale ( small @xmath17 ) component gives the main contribution to the pomeron , which may be described by a simple _ bare _ pole with trajectory [ eq : a8 ] ( t ) = ( 0 ) + ^t .",
    "the other component , the pion - loop insertions of the type shown in fig .  2 , generated by @xmath9-channel unitarity , may be treated as a correction .",
    "they are needed to describe the large @xmath17 region . following anselm and gribov @xcite",
    ", we find that these pion - loop corrections modify the pomeron trajectory so as to give the non - linear form ) we have corrected the misprint which occurs in the published version of @xcite . ]",
    "[ eq : a9 ] _ ( t ) = ( 0 ) + ^t - h ( ) , where [ eq : a10 ] h ( ) = f_^2 ( t ) , with @xmath42 and @xmath43  gev .",
    "the coefficient @xmath44 specifies the @xmath45 total cross section , and @xmath46 is the form factor of the pion - pomeron vertex .",
    "the coefficient @xmath47 in ( [ eq : a9 ] ) is small , but due to the tiny scale @xmath48 the @xmath9 dependence of @xmath49 is steep and non - linear .",
    "it has an important effect on the local slope @xmath50 of ( [ eq : a2 ] ) .",
    "in fact it was shown @xcite that , with a reasonable @xmath45 total cross section , it can account for at least half of the slope difference , ( [ eq : a3 ] ) , observed at isr energies .",
    "for the results that we obtain below for the pomeron trajectory , @xmath51 , it is important to note that expression ( [ eq : a10 ] ) for @xmath49 has been renormalized @xcite , such that [ eq : b10 ] h ( ) = h _ ( ) - h_(0 ) where @xmath52 denotes the full pion - loop contribution .",
    "the value of @xmath53 is determined by the region of @xmath9 that is controlled by the scale @xmath54 .",
    "it leads to a decrease of about 0.1 in the bare pole intercept , @xmath55 , depending on the exact slope of the pion form factor .",
    "for simplicity we first compute the pomeron assuming that the effects of single- and double - diffractive dissociation are negligible .",
    "these diffractive effects are incorporated in the results presented in sections 5 and 6 .",
    "we start from the two - component bare pomeron ( associated with hadronic scales @xmath54 and @xmath48 ) that was discussed above .",
    "once the proton - pomeron vertex @xmath56 is specified , the elastic @xmath3 amplitude is generated by the optical theorem from the inelastic processes ( fig .",
    "from this bare pomeron we produce , via @xmath25-channel eikonalisation , both elastic and inelastic @xmath3 interactions ( see fig .",
    "in practice we use a two - channel eikonal which allows us to simultaneously incorporate @xmath57 diffractive dissociation . in this way",
    "we construct a pomeron whose parameters may be tuned to describe @xmath58 and @xmath6 data throughout the isr to tevatron energy range .",
    "the parameters of the pomeron are @xmath59 of the trajectory ( [ eq : a9 ] ) , and @xmath60 and @xmath61 of the elastic proton - pomeron vertex , which is taken to have the power - like form [ eq : a11 ] v ( p p ) ( t ) = , where @xmath62 specifies @xmath5 .",
    "the power - like , rather than an exponential , form is motivated by the quark counting rules and by @xmath6 data .",
    "the latter is particularly true at isr energies where multi - pomeron effects are still reasonably small  as mentioned above , the pion - loop insertions account for about one half of the variation of the local elastic slope @xmath50 with @xmath9 , at small @xmath9 .",
    "the power - like form of ( [ eq : a11 ] ) is needed to account for the remaining change of @xmath50 .",
    "in addition to the above parameters , we also have to specify [ eq : a12 ] , which we take to be @xmath63 in accordance with @xmath57 dissociation observed at moderate energies @xcite .",
    "we use the additive quark model relation , @xmath64 , to determine @xmath65 , and we take the form factor of the pion - pomeron vertex to have the form [ eq : b12 ] f_(t ) = 1/(1 - t / a_2 ) .    in summary",
    ", we have expressed the @xmath9 dependence of the elastic @xmath3 ( or @xmath4 ) differential cross section , @xmath6 , in the form @xmath66 , and have argued that the slope @xmath19 depends on @xmath9 , even for small @xmath9 .",
    "actually there are three sources of the @xmath9 dependence of the elastic slope @xmath19 :    * the pion - loop insertions in the pomeron trajectory , ( [ eq : a9 ] ) , * the non - exponential form of the proton - pomeron vertex @xmath67 of ( [ eq : a11 ] ) , * the absorptive corrections , associated with eikonalization , which lead to a dip in @xmath68 at @xmath69 , whose position moves to smaller @xmath70 as the collider energy , @xmath23 , increases .",
    "the typical @xmath9 structure of the slope @xmath50 is shown in fig .",
    "the first two effects are responsible for the initial decrease of the elastic slope as @xmath71 increases away from @xmath7 , while the third effect produces a rapid growth of @xmath19 as @xmath71 approaches the position of the diffractive minimum .",
    "to account for @xmath25-channel unitarity , ( iii ) , we use a two channel @xmath72 eikonal formalism @xcite , as described in appendix a. for the opacity @xmath73 we take the fourier transform of the pomeron exchange amplitude [ eq : c12 ] a_(t ) = ( t)^2 ( ) ^_(t ) , where @xmath67 is given by ( [ eq : a11 ] ) and @xmath51 by ( [ eq : a9 ] ) .",
    "we tune the pomeron parameters @xmath59 of ( [ eq : a9 ] ) and @xmath74 of ( [ eq : a11 ] ) so as to describe the high energy @xmath3 ( or @xmath4 ) @xmath5 and @xmath6 data .",
    "the dashed curve in fig .",
    "4 shows the description of @xmath5 . the dashed curves on fig .  5",
    "show the description of isr and tevatron elastic data , together with the prediction at the lhc energy . from fig .",
    "5 it is difficult to see the dependence of the _ local _ elastic slope , @xmath19 of ( [ eq : a2 ] ) , with @xmath9 , though the lack of constancy of @xmath19 is clearly manifest in the isr data .",
    "a much more visible way to explore the @xmath9 dependence of @xmath19 is to plot the ratio @xmath75 versus @xmath9 , where @xmath76 is the experimentally measured elastic slope at small @xmath9 . in other words",
    "we divide out the major part of the @xmath9 dependence of the data .",
    "68 display the elastic data in this way at isr , s@xmath4s and tevatron energies , together with the model description ( dashed curves ) .",
    "although it is interesting to note that this physically motivated model explains the main features of the data , we delay the discussion of the detailed structure until we have extended the model of the pomeron to allow for high - mass diffractive dissociation ( which produces the continuous curves in figs .",
    "the parameters of the pomeron corresponding to the dashed curves are ) , we were to use a popular parametrization for @xmath67 , the best ( but still not as detailed as ( [ eq : a11 ] ) ) description of the existing data is achieved by using the proton dirac form factor , @xmath77 , as proposed in ref .",
    "[ eq : a13 ] ( 0 ) + ^t & = & 1.102 + 0.066  t + & & + a_1 = 0.48  gev^2 , & & a_2 = 3.6  gev^2 , with @xmath9 in gev@xmath30 .",
    "remarkably , after the pion - loop insertions and eikonalization , ( the small - distance  component of ) the pomeron looks similar to a fixed pole at @xmath78 ; recall that when @xmath53 of ( [ eq : b10 ] ) is introduced , the bare pole trajectory @xmath55 is decreased by about 0.1 .",
    "the shrinkage of the diffraction peak , which is conventionally described by an effective trajectory ( [ eq : a7 ] ) with @xmath79 , actually is seen to have a dominant contribution from the pion - loop insertions in the trajectory and from the eikonal procedure",
    ". moreover , the non - perturbative large distance pion - loop contribution explains almost all of the value of [ eq : a14 ] _ eff ( 0 ) - 1 0.08 .",
    "interestingly , the small - distance component of the pomeron we have reached the black disk limit , implying gluon saturation .",
    "another possibility is that this component is the two - gluon pomeron discussed by low and nussinov @xcite .",
    "] , with @xmath80 , is in agreement with the flat input gluon distribution obtained at @xmath81 in the global parton analyses , see , for example , fig .  1 in ref",
    ".  @xcite .    at first sight",
    "the values of the vertex parameters of ( [ eq : a13 ] ) , with @xmath82 , look unusual . on the other hand ,",
    "if we recall the two - gluon structure of the dominant short- distance component of the pomeron , then the most likely configuration is to share the momentum transfer between two of the valence quarks of the proton . in such a case",
    "we expect a pole form for the proton form factor with @xmath60 of the order of the usual 0.71  gev@xmath30 of the electromagnetic dipole form factor .",
    "in fact , for such a quark - diquark configuration we would anticipate that @xmath60 was a little less than 0.71  gev@xmath30 .",
    "however the price for such a configuration is that the second gluon propagator is of the form @xmath83 , where @xmath84  gev is the effective gluon mass .",
    "this gives @xmath85 .",
    "thus the form of the vertex , necessary to describe the data , has a natural physical interpretation .",
    "as we discussed in section  2 , diffractive dissociation is a non - negligible part of the total cross section at high energies .",
    "we therefore repeat the analysis of section  4 , but now incorporating the single- and double - diffractive dissociation processes of figs .",
    "1(d ) and 1(e ) .",
    "we use the triple - pomeron formalism , in which the single- and double - diffractive cross sections are respectively [ eq : a15 ] m^2 & = & ^2 ( t ) ( 0 ) g_3 ( t ) ( ) ^1 + _ ( 0 ) - 2 _ ( t ) ( ) ^_(0 ) - 1 + & & + [ eq : a16 ] & = & ^2 ( 0 ) g_3 ^ 2 ( t ) ( ( 1 + _ ( 0 ) - 2 _ ( t ) ) y ) ( ) ^_(0 ) - 1 where @xmath86 , @xmath67 is the proton - pomeron coupling of ( [ eq : a11 ] ) , and @xmath87 is the triple - pomeron vertex .",

    "1(d , e ) we must use the screened , rather than the bare , pomeron .",
    "a good , and simple , approximation for the screened pomeron trajectory is the effective trajectory of ( [ eq : a7 ] ) .",
    "in other words in the diffractive contributions of ( [ eq : a15 ] ) and ( [ eq : a16 ] ) we approximate @xmath51 by @xmath91 of ( [ eq : a7 ] ) .",
    "that is , we use @xmath92 in ( [ eq : append13 ] ) , ( [ eq : append16 ] ) , ( [ eq : a15 ] ) and ( [ eq : a16 ] ) .",
    "we compute @xmath28 and @xmath93 by integrating over @xmath9 , and over the full available rapidity or @xmath94 intervals , assuming that the triple - pomeron formalism is applicable for @xmath95 and @xmath96 . the lower mass region is already included in the two - channel eikonal calculation , which incorporates the @xmath37 excitations .",
    "next we have to include the screening corrections to the diffractive processes shown in figs .",
    "1(d , e ) .",
    "the procedure is described in appendix  b. both the diffractive cross sections , @xmath28 and @xmath93 , are given by ( [ eq : append12 ] ) , but with different slopes given by ( [ eq : append13 ] ) and ( [ eq : append16 ] ) respectively .",
    "the crucial parameter is the size of the triple - pomeron coupling .",
    "we choose the coupling , @xmath97 , to be in agreement with high - mass single diffractive dissociation cross section measured by the cdf collaboration , @xmath98  mb @xcite .    due to the logarithmically large @xmath99 or @xmath100 intervals which become available with increasing energy , the diffractive cross sections @xmath28 and @xmath93 increase rapidly , and their contribution may exceed the inelastic contribution described by the pomeron pole . in this domain",
    "the corrections coming from higher order reggeon graphs become important . in ref .  @xcite it was shown that the sum of a subset of multi - pomeron diagrams ( the so - called fan  diagrams ) have the effect of renormalizing the diffractive dissociation contribution @xmath101 in the following way [ eq : a17 ] _ d ( b_t ) , where @xmath102 is the eikonal in the absence of ( high - mass ) diffraction and @xmath103 is equal to the diffraction cross section , ( [ eq : a15 ] ) or ( [ eq : a16 ] ) , written in the impact parameter , @xmath17 , representation .",

    "if we choose @xmath106 in ( [ eq : a17 ] ) then we obtain eventual saturation of the diffractive cross sections , with increasing @xmath23 , at the pumplin bound @xmath107 @xcite .",
    "this choice may be considered as a lower limit for high - mass diffractive effects .",
    "however the pumplin bound is not justified in the presence of high - mass diffractive dissociation .",
    "so as the other extreme we may set @xmath108 in ( [ eq : a17 ] ) and restrict ourselves to the simplest single- and double - diffractive dissociation contributions of figs .",
    "1(d ) and 1(e ) .",
    "we will take these two choices of higher - order @xmath87 contributions to demonstrate the range of uncertainty arising from the introduction of diffractive dissociation into the analysis .",
    "diffractive dissociation becomes increasingly likely with increasing collider energy @xmath23 , and so it is particularly important to investigate the allowed range of the predictions at the lhc energy .",
    "the @xmath106 choice , which provides saturation of @xmath109 , leads to smaller cross sections",
    ". we will call it the _ minimal _ diffractive choice . the alternative @xmath108 analysis ,",
    "where we neglect all @xmath87 higher - order multi - pomeron graphs , we call the _ maximal _ diffractive choice .",
    "finally , after @xmath109 has been screened by the two - channel eikonal with @xmath110 , we have to add it to @xmath110 to obtain the full eikonal for the elastic amplitude .",
    "for the two alternative choices , @xmath108 and @xmath106 in ( [ eq : a17 ] ) , we use the resulting full eikonals to calculate the real and imaginary parts of the amplitude @xmath111 and the diffractive cross sections @xmath28 and @xmath93 , as described in the appendices .",
    "we are now able to extend the description of the @xmath5 and @xmath112 data , that we presented in section  4 , to include the effects of ( high - mass ) diffractive dissociation . in comparison to our first look  at the data , we now have two extra parameters : the triple - pomeron coupling @xmath113 and its slope @xmath114 , see ( [ eq : append15 ] ) .",
    "we choose these parameters so as to be in reasonable agreement with the data on single - diffractive dissociation @xcite .",
    "the data indicate that the slope is very small and so we explore values in the small @xmath114 domain . in the absence of screening ,",
    "the data require @xcite @xmath115 , where , as usual , @xmath116 is the proton - pomeron coupling .",
    "however , after the rescattering effects are included , a much larger value of the triple - pomeron vertex is needed in order to describe the same data , namely [ eq : b17 ] g_3 ( 0)/(0 ) 0.25 0.15 , according to whether the minimal @xmath117 or maximal @xmath118 diffraction dissociation model is adopted .",
    "we tune all six parameters ( @xmath119 of ( [ eq : a9 ] ) and ( [ eq : a11 ] ) , together with @xmath113 and @xmath114 ) to describe the @xmath58 and @xmath6 data .",
    "the values of the first four do not differ appreciably from those obtained in the simplified model of section  4 , in which high - mass diffraction was neglected .",

    "68 display very fine detail of the structure of the elastic differential cross section .",
    "it is remarkable that , with a minimal number of physically motivated parameters , the pomeron is able to describe all the essential features of the data throughout the isr to tevatron energy interval .",
    "the two models have , by definition , differing amounts of diffractive dissociation .",
    "the cross section for high - mass single - diffractive dissociation at @xmath124  tev is [ eq : b19 ] _ sd = 5.3 8.0  mb in the minimal and maximal models respectively , as compared to the experimental value of @xmath125 @xcite .",
    "in fact it was not possible to reach the observed value of @xmath28 using the minimal model with diffractive dissociation which saturates at the pumplin bound . from this viewpoint",
    "we see that the two models should give a realistic , if generous , guide to the uncertainties associated with the effects of including diffractive dissociation .",
    "the influence of diffractive dissociation is rather small at isr energies , but it increases to given an appreciable effect at tevatron and lhc energies .",
    "it can be seen from fig .",
    "9 that diffractive dissociation enlarges the spatial extent of the interaction and , as a consequence , increases the value of the elastic slope @xmath19 .",
    "this is particularly true at lhc energies where there are , as yet , no data . at lower energies",
    "the potential change in the value of @xmath19 is somewhat compensated in that we have to tune the parameters of the model to describe the _ same _ data .",
    "differences occur in the predictions of the minimal and maximal models when we extrapolate beyond the available data  compare the continuous and dotted curves for @xmath5 in fig .  4 and , again , for @xmath126 in fig .",
    "10(a ) .",
    "the derivative @xmath127 at @xmath7 becomes smaller as @xmath23 increases , reaching approximately zero at lhc energies , see fig .",
    "9 . for the maximal choice of diffractive dissociation , where the change induced is larger",
    ", it even alters the sign of @xmath127 at @xmath7 at @xmath128 .",
    "it is interesting to note that the pion - loop insertions into the bare pomeron trajectory leads to a change of slope [ eq : c19 ] b b ( 0 ) - b ( t = -0.2  gev^2 ) which increases with @xmath23 , and which reaches a value @xmath129 at the lhc energy .",
    "when , in addition , the pomeron - proton form factor ( [ eq : a11 ] ) is used ( rather than an exponential form ) then the difference @xmath130 increases to @xmath131 .",
    "however these effects are masked by the inclusion of rescattering corrections so that , finally , by coincidence , @xmath132 for all models at the lhc energy , see fig .",
    "a good message  is that the inclusion of diffractive dissociation suppresses the growth of @xmath50 as the diffractive dip is approached .",
    "the steep rise of the dashed curves , due to the cancellation between the pomeron pole and cut contributions , is affected by the interplay with the diffractive amplitudes , which have their own interference producing a minimum at a different @xmath9 value .",
    "thanks to this effect , we predict only a small variation of the local elastic slope in the @xmath133 domain at lhc energies , see fig .",
    "9(d ) .    in fig .",
    "10(a ) we show the energy dependence of the ratio of the real to the imaginary part of the elastic amplitude .",
    "we emphasize that we consider only even - signature pomeron amplitudes , and that we have neglected odd - signature odderon exchange .",
    "little is known about the strength of the odderon , however it could increase the real part of the @xmath4 amplitude measured by the ua4 collaboration @xcite such that @xmath134 increases by up to 0.01 .",
    "correspondingly , the prediction for @xmath3 elastic scattering would decrease .",
    "10(b ) shows the energy dependence of the _ total _ single - diffractive dissociation cross section @xmath135 , which also includes the @xmath37 excitation contribution .",
    "the factor of 2 allows for diffraction of either the target or the beam proton . in a similar way , in fig .",
    "10(c ) we show the double - diffractive dissociation cross section , together with its @xmath136 component . finally , in fig .",
    "10(d ) we present the ratio of the total diffractive cross section to @xmath5 , showing the approach to the pumplin bound with increasing energy .",
    "our approach allows the calculation of the survival probabilities of the rapidity gaps which feature in the various diffractive processes .",
    "the rapidity gaps , which naturally occur whenever we have ( colourless ) pomeron exchange , tend to get populated by secondary particles from the underlying event .",
    "since , here , we have incorporated the effects of rescattering in some detail , we are able to calculate the survival probabilities @xmath31 of the gaps .",
    "there has recently been much interest in the size of @xmath31 @xcite , because of the possibility of extracting new physics from hard diffractive processes in an almost background - free environment and , from a theoretical viewpoint , because of its reliance on subtle qcd techniques .",
    "again , it is convenient to work in impact parameter , @xmath17 , space .",
    "let @xmath137 be the amplitude of the particular diffractive process of interest .",
    "then the probability that there is no extra inelastic interaction is [ eq : a20 ] s^2 = , where , as usual , @xmath138 is the opacity ( or optical density ) of the interaction .",
    "the normalizing factor @xmath139 , where @xmath140 denotes the relevant opacity ( ( [ eq : append17])([eq : append21 ] ) ) evaluated at @xmath141 .",
    "the opacity @xmath142 reaches a maximum in the centre of the proton and becomes small in the periphery .",
    "therefore the survival probability @xmath31 depends strongly on the spatial distribution of the constituents of the relevant subprocess . as examples we consider single and double rapidity gap processes , assuming that the spatial @xmath143 distribution is controlled by the slope ) by an exponential form ,",
    "see also ( [ eq : append15 ] ) . ]",
    "@xmath144 of the pomeron - proton vertex @xmath145 , and that there is no shrinkage coming from the pomeron amplitude associated with the gap(s ) .",
    "this is the case for hard diffractive subprocesses .",
    "for instance , the diffractive central production of a higgs boson or high-@xmath146 dijets or diffractive heavy vector meson production , are all hard diffractive processes that are driven by the _ skewed _ gluon distribution which is evolved from an input scale @xmath147 up to the hard scale , @xmath148 , characteristic of the diffractive process .",
    "therefore it can be shown @xcite that @xmath149 , where @xmath150 is the running evolution scale . during the evolution",
    "@xmath150 increases up to @xmath148 , and so , at leading order , we have @xmath151 . ] .",
    "we calculate the survival probability @xmath31 for three illustrative values of the slope @xmath152 of the diffractive inclusive cross sections dependence of the leading proton is given by @xmath153 , see ( [ eq : a15 ] ) . ] :    * @xmath154 , in agreement with our parametrization of the pomeron - proton vertex ( compare ( [ eq : a11 ] ) and ( [ eq : a19 ] ) with ( [ eq : append15 ] ) ) , * @xmath155 , which corresponds to the slope of the electromagnetic proton form factor , * @xmath156 , which is the elastic slope at the corresponding energy",
    ".    moreover we calculate @xmath31 for five different diffractive processes .",
    "we consider single- and double - diffractive dissociation ( sd , dd ) , and a process which may be called _ central _ diffraction ( cd ) , that is a centrally produced state @xmath157 with rapidity gaps on either side . for both sd and cd",
    "we consider two possibilities : first with @xmath37 excitation permitted ( relevant to a forward calorimeter experiment , denoted cal ) and , second , without @xmath37 excitation ( relevant to a forward proton spectrometer measurement , denoted fps ) .",
    "the five diffractive processes are sketched in fig .",
    "the @xmath17 dependences of the single- and double - diffractive dissociation amplitudes can be found in appendix  b. we find [ eq : a21 ] | m |^2 ( -b_t^2/nb ) where @xmath158 and 4 for sd , dd and cd respectively .",
    "thus double - diffraction has the largest spatial extent .    in practice",
    "we use the full two - channel expressions for the screening factors , which are collected together in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : append17])([eq : append21 ] ) of appendix b. using these screening factors in ( [ eq : a20 ] ) , together with the appropriate amplitudes , we find the gap survival probabilities @xmath31 that are shown in table  1 .",
    ".the survival probabilities @xmath31 of rapidity gaps in single , central , double diffractive processes at s@xmath4s , tevatron and lhc energies calculated using the minimal diffractive dissociation model of the pomeron .",
    "the processes are shown in fig .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     there are several comments relevant to the survival probabilities listed in table  1 . _ first _ , we see that the results with and without the detection of the @xmath37 excitations are very similar .",
    "_ second _ , we see that the double - diffractive process , with a single rapidity gap in the central region , has the largest chance that the gap survives the rescattering , due to the wider spatial distribution of the basic process ( see ( [ eq : a21 ] ) with @xmath159 ) .",
    "_ third _ , the gap survival probability @xmath31 decreases with @xmath23 due to the growth of the opacity , but increases with the slope @xmath144 as then a larger part of the basic subprocess extends to the periphery of the interaction .",
    "_ fourth _ , we find that the survival probabilities listed in the table are essentially unchanged if we use the maximal diffractive model , or even if we revert to the simple model of the pomeron in which large mass diffraction is neglected .",
    "recall that the parameters of all models are tuned to the _ same _ data , so major differences in the predictions are compensated .",
    "the _ fifth _ comment concerns the calculation of @xmath31 for single - diffractive dissociation .",
    "here we do not use the whole opacity @xmath160 , but rather @xmath161 . in this way",
    "we avoid single - diffractive dissociation which has a gap at the same location as that occurring in the diffractive process of interest .",
    "however it is worth noting that this subtle correction only gives a 5% enhancement in the predictions for @xmath31 .",
    "the _ sixth _ comment is that central diffractive processes , with two rapidity gaps , have the smallest survival probabilities .",
    "the predictions @xmath162 at the tevatron and @xmath163 at the lhc , for @xmath164 , are in agreement with our previous estimates @xcite based on a more simplified model .",
    "the earlier work did not use a two - channel eikonal formalism to account for @xmath37 excitations ( but instead used a simplified excitation factor ) .",
    "nor did it include pion - loop insertions or allow for high - mass diffractive processes .",
    "nevertheless the stability of the predictions for @xmath31 is encouraging , and we expect the values given in table  1 to be reliable estimates of the effects of rescattering .",
    "we have constructed a formalism that incorporates all the main features of high energy soft diffraction .",
    "first , we account for the nearest singularity produced by @xmath9-channel unitarity by including the _ pion - loop _ contributions in the bare pomeron pole . in this way",
    "we correctly reproduce the behaviour of the diffractive amplitudes at large @xmath17 , in the peripheral region of the interaction .",
    "second , we use a _ two - channel eikonal _ to include the pomeron cuts generated by elastic and quasi - elastic ( with @xmath37 intermediate states ) @xmath25-channel unitarity . finally , we incorporate high - mass _ diffractive dissociation _ in the whole procedure . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "no model has attempted to include all these effects simultaneously .",
    "the model may be used to predict all soft diffractive processes at lhc energies .",
    "the main uncertainty is the size of diffractive dissociation .",
    "we consider two physically motivated extremes , which we called the minimal and maximal diffractive models , giving lower and upper bounds for the cross sections . at @xmath128",
    "we predict a total @xmath3 cross section in the range [ eq : a22 ] _ tot = 99.1 - 104.5  mb , and a @xmath3 elastic differential cross section at @xmath7 [ eq : a23 ] = 506 - 564  mb / gev^2 , with a slope , at @xmath7 , of [ eq : a24 ] b ( 0 ) = 20.3 - 21.9  gev^-2 .",
    "also we find that the ratio of the real to the imaginary part of the elastic amplitude should lie in the range [ eq : b24 ] re a_el / im a_el = 0.10 - 0.12 , at @xmath165  tev .",
    "for the single- and double - diffractive dissociation cross sections we predict [ eq : a25 ] _ sd & = & 9.4 - 15.4  mb + & & + _ dd & & 9.5  mb , which include @xmath37 excitation contributions of 2.3 and 0.1  mb respectively .",
    "we are also able to make reliable predictions for the probability @xmath31 that the large rapidity gaps ( which characterise diffraction ) survive the soft rescattering corrections , that is survive the population of the gap by secondary particles from the underlying event .",
    "these probabilities decrease with collider energy due to the growth of the opacity @xmath138 of the interaction .",
    "moreover they depend on the particular diffractive interaction of interest and on the configuration of the rapidity gaps ( as demonstrated by table  1 and fig .",
    "for example , for double - diffractive central higgs production via @xmath166 fusion we predict @xmath167 at tevatron ( lhc ) energies .",
    "since the @xmath168 boson , like the photon , is radiated from a quark , it is natural to choose the slope @xmath152 in table  1 to be that of the electromagnetic form factor , @xmath155 . on the other hand for the production of a higgs by pomeron - pomeron fusion it is natural to choose @xmath169 , consistent with our pomeron - proton vertex . in this case the depletion @xmath170 at tevatron ( lhc ) energies .",
    "it is interesting to note that , after all the effects ( pion - loop , rescattering , diffractive dissociation ) are simultaneously included , the @xmath171 and @xmath112 data require both @xmath172 and @xmath173 to be essentially zero for the _ bare _ pomeron pole .",
    "diffractive dissociation is more important in the periphery of the interaction and has the effect of eating up  @xmath173 as can be seen by comparing @xmath174 of ( [ eq : a13 ] ) , obtained with the simplified model , with the value @xmath151 of ( [ eq : a18 ] ) when diffraction dissociation is included .",
    "recall that soft processes are driven by two scales  the pseudo - goldstone @xmath48 scale and the normal hadronic scale @xmath84  gev .",
    "the interactions driven by the larger scale @xmath54 should link up with perturbative qcd .",
    "indeed we obtain @xmath175 for the small - size component of the pomeron , in agreement with the flat gluon distribution obtained in global analyses for @xmath176 . the non - perturbative large - size component , arising from the pion - loop insertions ,",
    "then shifts the pomeron trajectory from @xmath175 to @xmath177 .    as mentioned above",
    ", the main uncertainty is in the treatment of diffractive dissociation .",
    "the two extreme treatments give results shown by the continuous and dotted curves in figs .",
    "the values of @xmath5 and @xmath178 are in agreement with results of simpler models @xcite , which account only for elastic @xmath25-channel unitarity .",
    "the major reason for the agreement is that the parameters of the models are tuned to describe the same data .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that the introduction of diffractive dissociation can , to a large extent , be compensated by the renormalization of the parameters of the bare pomeron .",
    "( indeed it is interesting to note that the original predictions of @xcite for @xmath5 , @xmath19 and @xmath28 are in excellent agreement with those of our maximal diffraction model . )",
    "however the contribution of diffractive dissociation is not negligible and reveals itself in the shoulder  seen in @xmath179 of fig .",
    "10(a ) and in the extra curvature in fig .",
    "10(d ) , using the minimal model which satisfies the pumplin bound . from this point of view",
    ", it is possible that at the lhc we will enter a new domain in the high energy behaviour of soft diffraction .",
    "either high - mass diffractive dissociation will saturate at the pumplin bound , or it will continue to increase with the interaction dominantly occurring in the peripheral region , originating from processes with many rapidity gaps . recall that the pumplin bound is not justified in the presence of high - mass diffractive dissociation .    of course",
    ", for any model with pomeron cuts or driven by more than one regge pole , we should not expect factorization .",
    "however , as has been known for a long time @xcite , if , by chance , approximate factorization should occur at some high energy , then it will be valid over a rather large energy interval on account of the flat  energy behaviour of the amplitudes .",
    "here we have considered only the positive signature contributions and have neglected odderon exchange .",
    "the normalisation of the odderon contribution is unknown .",
    "however it is described by three , or more , gluon exchange , and so a flatter @xmath9 dependence is expected for this amplitude .",
    "it could well reveal itself for @xmath180 .    in conclusion ,",
    "we have constructed a formalism for soft interactions , driven by the pomeron , that embodies all the major physical effects .",
    "we therefore believe that it should give reliable predictions for all soft diffractive phenomena at the lhc , at least in the @xmath181 domain .",

    "of course , the pomeron interaction produces some distortion of the original form of the baryon wave functions , giving @xmath185 .",
    "we see that the eigenvalues of the above two - channel vertex are @xmath186 .",
