    "present - day galaxies show a clear correlation between mass and size , with the most massive galaxies having the larger sizes .",
    "this mass - size relationship has been known both for elliptical and spiral galaxies for many years . with the advent of large surveys , like the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) it has been possible to quantify this correlation with high accuracy ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "however , the mechanisms by which this relationship is built remain uncertain .",
    "for instance , we do not have conclusive answers to questions like : `` were the galaxies born in - situ at the positions where we find them in the local mass - size relation or were they born in another part on this diagram , drifting to their present location ? '' .",
    "if so , `` how much have they grown and what are the mechanisms responsible for this displacement ? '' . answering these questions",
    "is directly connected to our understanding of how the assembly of the galaxies has proceeded through cosmic time . in this paper",
    "we will particularly focus on spheroidal galaxies as it has been shown in the last few years that their stellar mass - size relation has dramatically changed with redshift .",
    "several papers have explored the evolution of the stellar mass - size relation of spheroid  like galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in general , they all agree with a significant evolution of this relation with redshift .",
    "their results can be summarized as follows : at fixed stellar mass , spheroid - like galaxies were significantly more compact at higher redshift ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , with an increase on the effective radii by a factor of @xmath02(4 ) from z@xmath01(2 ) ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "however , these observational results say little about the amount of size evolution of individual galaxies on the mass  size plane .",
    "nevertheless , at least a few basic statements can be established regarding the growth of individual galaxies based on the current observational evidence .",
    "first , at high - z there are no big spheroidal objects , implying that the present - day large elliptical galaxies have either formed recently ( in - situ ) with large sizes or they are the product of the evolution of previous compact galaxies that populated the high - z stellar mass - size plane .",
    "second , the near absence of compact massive galaxies in the nearby universe @xcite , which were very common in the early universe , indicates that individual objects ( at least the very old and compact ones ) have evolved significantly in size .",
    "some recent works have conducted a detailed analysis of the buildup of the local spheroid mass  size relationship @xcite .",
    "these works propose that the formation of this relation is a result of two steps : a ) the continuous emergence of galaxies as early - type systems with larger sizes , as cosmic time increases , due to the decreasing availability of gas during their formation phase @xcite , and b ) their subsequent growth through either gas expulsion in the so - called puffing up scenario @xcite or by minor merging activity @xcite .",
    "if the above scenario is correct , i.e. that the new assembled galaxies are born with larger sizes as redshift decreases , we should observe that the number density of spheroid - like massive galaxies at fixed stellar mass should decrease with increasing redshift .",
    "furthermore , a gradual change of the age of the galaxies at fixed stellar mass should be expected , in the sense that larger galaxies should be younger .",
    "however , there is no compelling evidence of a significant drop in the number density of elliptical galaxies up to z@xmath01 ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , weakening this formation scenario . on the other hand , in @xcite and @xcite , there is some hint that larger spheroid - like galaxies , at fixed dynamical and stellar mass , are younger than their compact mass equivalents .    in this paper",
    "we reexamine the buildup of the mass  size relationship of spheroidal galaxies with two significant improvements in relation to previous work .",
    "first , this paper addresses the issue of the evolution of early - type galaxies on the size - mass plane by comparing a nearby and a distant sample of galaxies , classified and analyzed in the same way",
    ". we will show in this paper that previous studies of the local stellar mass  size relation of early - type galaxies are severely contaminated by galaxies of other morphological types .",
    "for this reason , the present study is the first one exploring objects that have been classified only visually , and not by any other criteria , like structural parameters or colours .",
    "the second advantage of the present work is that we have quality spectra for all our targets , allowing us  by exploring their spectral energy distributions ( seds )  to obtain reliable star formation histories ( sfhs ) .",
    "spectroscopic data is essential to robustly determine the properties ( stellar mass and age ) of the underlying stellar populations in both local and high redshift samples , allowing us to make a much more consistent assessment of the increase in galaxy size on an individual galaxy basis .",
    "the information about the ages allows us to explore whether the size evolution depends on the properties of the stellar populations of these galaxies .",
    "this information is key to distinguish between the two most likely mechanisms of size growth proposed in the literature for elliptical galaxies : the puffing up versus the minor merging scenario .",
    "we will amply discuss in this paper the implications of our findings in relation to these two models .",
    "the paper is structured as follows . in section 2",
    "we describe the local sample .",
    "the connection between stellar age and the mass  size relationship is explored in section 3 . in section 4",
    "we present our moderate redshift sample and in section 5 we quantify the size evolution of our galaxies .",
    "section 6 is devoted to explore which evolutionary scenario is more plausible according to these observations , finally concluding on section 7 with an overview of our results . in this paper",
    "we adopt a standard @xmath3cdm cosmology , with @xmath4=0.3 , @xmath5=0.7 and h@xmath6=70 km / s / mpc .",
    "our local sample is taken from the morphological catalogue of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter na10 ) obtained via visual classification from sdss imaging .",
    "the na10 catalogue comprises 14,034 galaxies from sdss data release 4 ( dr4 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) in the redshift range 0.01 @xmath7 z @xmath7 0.1 with an extinction - corrected g - band magnitude brighter than 16 . from this catalogue , we select the elliptical galaxies ( c0 , e0 and e+ ) with a t - type class -5 , resulting in a final sample comprising 2,656 galaxies with available spectra .",
    "our choice for visually classified galaxies aims at minimizing the impact of morphological contaminants , which frequently degrade automated classification samples . to illustrate this issue",
    ", we compare in fig .",
    "[ contamination ] the na10 sample used in this paper with the @xcite early - type sample used in @xcite for a similar analysis to the one presented here .",
    "in contrast with our selection , which is purely based on morphology , the @xcite galaxies are selected by the following criteria : a ) located on the red sequence , b ) no emission lines in their spectra and c ) concentration parameter c@xmath82.5 . from the comparison between both samples shown in fig .",
    "[ contamination ] , it follows that a sample of early - type galaxies based on the above criteria will be contaminated by bulges of both face - on and edge - on spirals .",
    "unfortunately , those contaminants are not distributed evenly throughout the sample .",
    "instead , they tend to concentrate in certain regions of the parameter space , introducing undesired systematic effects .",
    "for example , we see that the largest galaxies in the mass  size plane , at a fixed mass , are heavily contaminated by spiral galaxies",
    ". another important advantage of our selection purely based on morphology is that it is neither biased against galaxies with recent star formation activity , nor with a passive evolution in their star formation history .",
    "this is relevant for the purpose of this paper as shown below .",
    "we take advantage of the fact that virtually all of the galaxies in the sample of @xcite have their morphology visually studied by the galaxy zoo project @xcite .",
    "we use their _ fraction of votes _ for ellipticals ( @xmath9 ) ; spirals ( both clock - wise and anti - clock - wise , @xmath10 ) and edge - on spirals ( @xmath11 ) to identify the late type galaxy ( ltg ) contaminants .",
    "we have carried out a further visual check of these contaminants , finding a complete agreement with the results of galaxy zoo . despite the small overall contamination rate ( @xmath01.8% ) , the face - on ltgs concentrate in the region with large radii , while the edge - on ltgs ( @xmath08% ) concentrate towards low values of r@xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "the spectroscopic data and photometric parameters of the na10 sample are retrieved from the sdss archive .",
    "we have used spectra from dr7@xcite , to benefit from the improved flux calibration introduced in dr6 ( see * ? ? ?",
    "the sdss spectroscopic data cover a wavelength range from roughly 3,800 to 9,200   at an average spectral resolution of 3.25   ( fwhm ) .",
    "this instrumental resolution is not constant but varies in a complex way with wavelength , fiber and arrangement .",
    "all spectra are both de - redshifted and corrected for galactic foreground extinction , using the dust maps of @xcite .",
    "hereafter , all size estimates are quoted as the circularized effective radius @xmath14 , with parameters devrad_g and devab_g taken from the photometric sdss - pipeline . in principle ,",
    "velocity dispersion data ( @xmath15 ) are also available from the dr7 sdss - pipeline , although with a moderately high ratio of missing values , amounting to over 15% of our sdss sample .",
    "consequently , we have re - calculated the values of velocity dispersion with the same spectral fitting method used in this study ( starlight , see  3 ) , taking as velocity dispersion the smoothing parameter of the stellar population mixture that produces the best fit to the observed spectrum .",
    "@xcite show that there is good agreement between the starlight and sdss - dr7 velocity dispersion values , with only a small systematic trend at the low ( @xmath7 90 km / s ) and high ( @xmath8 280 km / s ) ends of the @xmath15 range .",
    "very few measurements ( 0.4 % ) are excluded , with @xmath16  40  km / s , because they are considerably smaller than the resolution of the base ssp models ( 58 km / s ) .",
    "we have used the @xcite prescriptions to correct the velocity dispersion to the same fraction of the effective radius , r@xmath12/8 , instead of the fixed fiber diameter ( 3 arcsec ) .",
    "both @xcite and @xcite have argued that there is an age gradient within the mass  size plane of early  type galaxies : at fixed mass , galaxies with larger sizes are found to be younger .",
    "as it was argued in  1 , this observation is expected if newly assembled spheroidal galaxies feature larger sizes than those systems assembled earlier .",
    "for this reason , we have revisited the age distribution of our galaxies in the na10 sample .",
    "the age of the stellar populations of our galaxies is estimated as follows .",
    "we use the spectral fitting code starlight @xcite to find combinations of single stellar population ( ssp ) models that , broadened with a given velocity dispersion , achieve the best match with the observed galaxy spectrum . for the present study ,",
    "we have used the spectral energy distributions of the miles ssp models @xcite with a kroupa universal initial mass function @xcite .",
    "these models are based on the miles stellar library @xcite , which combines both a rather complete coverage of the stellar atmospheric parameters and a relatively high and nearly constant spectral resolution , 2.3  ( fwhm ) , optimally suited for the spectral resolution of the sdss data .",
    "our base for the fitting using starlight consists of 138 solar - scaled ssp models with 6 different metallicities , ranging from z=1/50 to 1.6@xmath17z@xmath18 and 23 different ages , from 0.08 to 11.22 gyr .",
    "extinction due to foreground dust is modeled with the ccm - law @xcite and masks are used to avoid emission lines or bad pixels . the m@xmath19 parameter  the fraction of the initial stellar mass which still remains as stars at a later time ",
    "is extracted from the model predictions and used to calculate the stellar mass of our galaxies , m@xmath20 . in the present work ,",
    "we have characterized the stellar population mixture of each galaxy by its mass - weighted average age , calculated as :    @xmath21    where @xmath22 is the number of ssp models in the base , @xmath23 is the _ mass fraction vector _ , defined as the fractional contribution of the ssp with age @xmath24 and metallicity @xmath25 , to the total flux , converted into mass with the m / l@xmath26 of each ssp .",
    "stellar masses , m@xmath20 , are also computed with the @xmath23 and m / l@xmath26 .",
    "once each sfh has been calculated , the corresponding lookback - times are added in order to set all the histories to a common z=0 ground .",
    "this offset ranges between 0.1 ( z=0.01 ) and 1.3  gyr ( z=0.1 ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : sz0 ] shows the size - mass correlation of our sdss sample of early - type galaxies , split according to the ( mass - weighted ) ages determined by starlight .",
    "we follow the spirit of the modeling of @xcite and @xcite whereby age - segregated samples are expected to occupy different regions of the mass - size relation . in order to maximize the difference according to age , we only show the upper and lower quartiles of the age distribution , corresponding , respectively , to galaxies older than 11.7  gyr ( black crosses ) , and younger than 10.2  gyr ( grey triangles ) .",
    "these symbols represent the median within bins taken at a fixed number of galaxies per bin .",
    "the error bar gives the rms scatter within each bin .",
    "the figure shows that the predicted segregation in the mass - size relation with respect to age is not significant when plotted against stellar mass ( panel a ) .",
    "this is in contradiction with the results shown in @xcite ( their fig .",
    "we have quantified the separation between the young and the old galaxy families by zooming in the region where the masses of the galaxies of our two extreme age quartiles overlap ( fig .",
    "[ fig : zoom ] ) .",
    "we quantify the size difference as follows : @xmath27r@xmath12/r@xmath282@xmath29r@xmath30r@xmath31/@xmath29r@xmath32r@xmath33 . as we expect from a visual inspection of the figure ,",
    "the size difference between the two families , at a fixed stellar mass , is negligible ( being compatible with zero change within the statistical uncertainty ) .",
    "the reasons for this discrepancy could be several . on the one hand , @xcite segregates their galaxies using luminosity - weighted ages instead of mass - weighted ages as used here .",
    "another possibility is that their early - type selection criteria based on the automatic code morphot could include a larger number of spiral galaxies as contaminants , in contrast with a visual classification .",
    "we have explored whether using luminosity - weighted ages changes our results and find that this is not the case .",
    "in fact , if we repeat the previous exercise using luminosity - weighted ages , we find that the difference between the two extreme quartiles is 1.7@xmath20.9% ( i.e. very similar to the mass - weighted ages ) .",
    "finally , our stellar mass - size relation is compared with the early - type relation of @xcite .",
    "the agreement is very good for objects with stellar mass m@xmath34m@xmath35 .",
    "however , at the high mass end we note that the sizes of our galaxies are slightly larger than those provided by @xcite , a result in agreement with @xcite , who find a similar underestimate of the shen et al . sizes of a similar sample of visually inspected early - type galaxies .",
    "our previous results show that at fixed stellar mass galaxies do not show any significant difference in age .",
    "however , an interesting change is found when dynamical masses are considered instead of stellar ones ( panels c and d ) . in this case , the age segregation is apparent , with younger galaxies having slightly larger sizes . under the assumption of dynamical homology ( i.e. estimating the dynamical masses as m@xmath36 @xcite )",
    "the size difference among the two extreme quartiles reaches a value of @xmath016% ( @xmath013% in the case of luminosity - weighted ages )",
    ". however , elliptical galaxies are well known for not being an homologous family . if we repeat the same analysis using this time the dynamical mass accounting for the non - homology following the expression provided by @xcite :    @xmath37    with    @xmath38    and @xmath39 being the srsic index of the elliptical galaxies in our sample ( determined from * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we find that the size difference , @xmath27r@xmath12/r@xmath12 , decreases significantly to @xmath09% ( @xmath08% in the case of luminosity - weighted ages ) .",
    "our findings about the size difference between the old and young galaxies at a fixed dynamical mass is in qualitative agreement with the findings by @xcite .        given that dynamical mass estimates depend on the velocity dispersion quadratically , one would expect that the size difference of the galaxies in the two age quartiles could be linked to a change on the velocity dispersion between the young and the old population .",
    "panel b ) of fig .",
    "[ fig : sz0 ] confirms this point : at fixed velocity dispersion , the older subsample is significantly larger ( 35.3@xmath20.5% ; 25.3@xmath21.7% in the case of luminosity - weighted ages ) than the younger galaxies .",
    "alternatively , one could interpret this result as follows : at fixed effective radius , older galaxies have lower velocity dispersion than their younger counterparts ( although the region of overlap between old and young galaxies at fixed size is arguably rather small ) .",
    "although we agree qualitatively with @xcite on a size difference between the young and old galaxy families at a fixed dynamical mass , our results about the size difference at a fixed velocity dispersion is in contrast with them .",
    "these authors show ( in their fig .",
    "1 ) that at fixed velocity dispersion the age of the galaxies is independent of their size .",
    "the reason for this discrepancy could be double : first , their ages are luminosity - weighted , in contrast with our mass - weighted ages , and second , their sample suffers from some contamination of spiral galaxies in key places of the mass - size diagram .",
    "irrespectively of the comparison with other works , our results indicate that the size variation due to changes in the stellar population ages of the elliptical galaxies in the local universe is very small .",
    "although the age trend goes in the direction ( i.e. older galaxies being more compact than young ones at fixed stellar mass ) that one would expect from a progressive bottom - up scenario for the buildup of the local mass - size relation model , it is clear that the differences in size are very small to be able to reproduce the large size variation with cosmic time found at high redshift .",
    "we will return to this point more extensively in the following sections .",
    "we conclude that the stellar population ages do not resemble the age of the full assembly of the elliptical galaxies and , consequently , that _",
    "after _ the formation of the bulk of their stellar content , elliptical galaxies have experienced a significant evolution in their size .",
    "the virial theorem predicts that , at fixed mass , the velocity dispersion will change as the inverse of the root square of the galaxy size .",
    "consequently , one would expect , due to the strong size evolution with redshift observed in the elliptical population , that the velocity dispersion of the high redshift objects were significantly larger than those found in local galaxies .",
    "however , observations are at odds with this scenario @xcite : the velocity dispersion of the elliptical galaxies , at fixed stellar mass , only changes moderately with redshift . @xcite",
    "have explained this mild change in the velocity dispersion suggesting that the contribution of the dark matter halo to the gravitational potential of the galaxy changes with cosmic time . according to that model , in the present universe",
    "the contribution of the dark matter halo on settling the velocity dispersion of the galaxies will be higher than in the past .",
    "we can explore whether our local sample shows any hint of a dynamical structure change as a function of the age as suggested by the @xcite idea .",
    "to do that we explore both the baryonic fraction ( top ) and the velocity dispersion ( bottom ) of our local galaxies against the age of their stellar populations in fig .",
    "[ fig : tsigma ] .",
    "the baryonic fraction is defined as the ratio between the stellar mass and the dynamical mass , and should roughly correspond to the net baryon fraction within the effective radius for our early - type galaxies .",
    "we bin the sample according to stellar mass as labelled . in order to illustrate the effect of non - homology , we show the homologous estimates as thick lines and the non - homologous models ( using dynamical masses from eq .",
    "[ eq : nonhom ] ) as thin lines .",
    "the strong trend habitually found between the stellar populations and velocity dispersion is evident , with the oldest galaxies being the most massive ones ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , with a larger dark matter content within the optical radius ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this trend of an increased dark matter content with galaxy mass is also consistent with the results pertaining to whole halos , as shown when comparing observed stellar mass functions with cosmological halo abundances ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .",
    "we can now probe in more detail fig .",
    "[ fig : tsigma ] : at fixed stellar mass , the oldest galaxies feature higher velocity dispersions and a lower baryon fraction .",
    "the higher velocity dispersion for the older galaxies is in agreement with the findings of @xcite at high redshift and supports the idea of @xcite .",
    "however , the decrease in the baryonic fraction as a function of age seems at odds with the high - z findings .",
    "it is interesting to note that our estimation of the dynamical mass is done with the sizes found in the local universe , so a direct relation with the baryonic fraction estimated at high - z is not straightforward . from the analysis of the local relation",
    ", we find that the age of the most massive local ellipticals is quite homogeneous and also their dynamical structure change is limited to m@xmath40/m@xmath41@xmath00.4@xmath20.1 .",
    "this suggests that the most massive elliptical galaxies formed via an earlier , very homogeneous formation process .",
    "this scenario is consistent with the observed lack of evolution in the number density of massive early - type galaxies ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "for our intermediate and lower stellar mass bin , elliptical galaxies show a much more important trend between age and dynamical structure .",
    "for instance , we see that for present m@xmath40@xmath010@xmath42m@xmath43 ellipticals , the baryonic fraction can change between 0.3 to 0.7 and the velocity dispersion between 150 to 250 km / s .",
    "we note that our trend , at fixed stellar mass , towards a lower baryon fraction in older populations is at odds with @xcite and @xcite .",
    "they obtain the _ opposite _ trend , namely more dark matter in the younger populations at fixed stellar mass @xcite , or corrected luminosity @xcite .",
    "however , our range of stellar masses and ages is much shorter , concentrated towards the high mass end .",
    "furthermore , the age estimates of @xcite are based on broadband photometry alone , a method considered robust on the determinations of the stellar m / l but not on age estimates ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite use instead the spectroscopic ages from @xcite who use a combination of spectroscopic line strengths . in an independent study carried out with 40,000 etgs from sdss ( de la rosa et al . in preparation ) several methods and ssp models are compared .",
    "the method of @xcite with @xcite models provide systematically younger ages than the _ spectral - fitting _ technique with the miles population synthesis models used for the present study .",
    "furthermore , by comparing the performance of the model - method combination with repeated observations of the same sdss targets ( @xmath02300 repeated spectra ) ,",
    "the _ spectral - fitting _ approach is shown to be considerably more robust than other age dating methods .",
    "the difference between older and younger galaxies may reflect different channels of galaxy formation within the same stellar mass bin . as the size of the galaxies is proportional to the dynamical mass and inversely proportional to the square of the velocity dispersion ,",
    "we obtain , as expected , a slight trend to smaller galaxies as a function of the stellar population ages .",
    "this trend is unable to explain the strong size evolution found at high redshift .",
    "the detailed analysis of the local mass  size relation reveals that the information contained is unable to fully explain which mechanisms have followed the elliptical galaxies to reach their present sizes .",
    "for this reason , it is necessary to conduct a direct comparison of the properties of the local galaxies with those of equivalent galaxies at high - z to extract such information .",
    "this is what we do in the following sections .",
    "in order to understand in more detail the size evolution of massive galaxies and their relation to age , we include in our study a sample of visually classified early - type galaxies at moderate redshift ( z@xmath11 ) . the comparison with the local sample allows us to probe the evolution of the mass - size relationship over the past @xmath08  gyr .",
    "the deep images of the great observatories origins deep survey ( goods ) fields @xcite taken by the advanced camera for surveys ( _ acs _ ) on board the hubble space telescope ( _ hst _ ) provide the optimal dataset for visual classification of galaxy morphologies out to redshifts z@xmath44 .",

    "this is one of the most important result of this work and implies that the amount of size evolution that elliptical galaxies suffers since z@xmath01 is independent of the age of the galaxies at each redshift interval .",
    "this means that , the full population of elliptical galaxies , independently of its level of star formation , experiences a similar evolutionary mechanism for assembly .",

    "in this section we explore the current most likely scenarios proposed to explain the evolution of elliptical galaxies on the mass  size plane .",
    "we use the results obtained here and in previous papers to constrain those scenarios .    in what follows",
    "we consider that both the size and the stellar mass growth of the elliptical galaxies can be described as the contribution of three different processes : i ) formation of new stars in the galaxies as a result of gas consumption , ii ) accretion of already formed stars from merging of different subunits and iii ) gas ejection from the activity of either an agn and/or supernova galactic winds .",
    "we parameterize the effect of these three processes in the mass and size of the galaxies as follows :    @xmath61    @xmath62    with @xmath63 and @xmath64 representing the increase of the stellar mass due to star formation and by accretion of new stars into the galaxies , respectively .",
    "@xmath65 , @xmath66 and @xmath67 correspond to the increase in size by star formation , accreted stars and by expansion due to galactic winds either created by the effect of a central agn or supernovae explosions .",
    "the results of this paper show that @xmath63 is very small ( i.e. @xmath68 ) and also that the evolution of the size of the galaxies is quite independent of the age of their stellar population , so @xmath69 . due to the little increase in the stellar mass due to in - situ star formation we assume from now on , to simplify the discussion , that , if any , @xmath70 for the elliptical galaxies since z@xmath01 .",
    "@xcite have proposed a mechanism based on the removal of gas as result of agn activity to explain the size growth of early - type galaxies . according to these authors",
    ", the rapid expulsion of large amounts of gas by quasar winds destabilizes the galaxy structure in the inner , baryon - dominated regions , and leads to a more expanded stellar distribution .",
    "a similar idea  but based on the gas expulsion associated to stellar evolution  has been proposed by @xcite .",
    "the prediction from the puffing up model can be parameterized as follows :    @xmath71    in other words , all the galaxies in the stellar mass - size relation should just evolve vertically in this relation without any increase of stellar mass .",
    "consequently , the size evolution we observe at fixed stellar mass should be directly interpreted as the total size evolution of the galaxies .",
    "this model agrees with observations at predicting a small formation of new stars due to the removal of gas from the galaxies .",
    "in addition , this model fits well with the lack of evidence of significant evolution in the number density of massive ellipticals since z@xmath01 .",
    "however , we find that our data is in conflict with the model in several aspects .",
    "first , according to the @xcite model , after the formation of the compact structure , the agn activity will remove the gas , triggering a fast growth process ( @xmath020 - 30 myr based on recent simulations0.5 - 1 gyr . ] ; @xcite .",
    "this would imply that galaxies with stellar populations older than @xmath01 gyr should be already located in the local stellar mass - size relation .",
    "this is not what our data shows .",
    "we have galaxies ( old and young ) at the same distance from the local relation at all redshifts .",
    "for instance , at z=1 the mass - weighted age of our sample is 3.9  gyr for the old subsample and 3.5  gyr for the young subsample .",
    "we can consequently assure that the mechanism that is operating in the size evolution of our galaxies does not know about the age of the stellar populations .",
    "this is in contradiction with the puffing up model .",
    "in addition , a natural prediction from the puffing up model is that the scatter of the stellar mass - size relation will increase with redshift @xcite , with some galaxies already in place on the local relation and others still in a very compact phase .",
    "we do not observe any increase in the scatter of the stellar mass - size relation with redshift in our data .",
    "major mergers ( i.e. mergers of galaxies with similar mass ) were first considered as one the likely paths for size growth in elliptical galaxies .",
    "major dry mergers can increase the size in a way almost directly proportional to the mass increase ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this evolution is not strong enough to be compatible with the low number of major mergers observed at least since z@xmath01 @xcite , as well as with recent numerical simulations @xcite .",
    "for this reason , we will not consider this mechanism further .",
    "another possible scenario for elliptical galaxy growth involves to minor mergers on parabolic orbits ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "* ) . through this channel , the new accreted stars as well as the redistribution of stars in the main galaxy ,",
    "preferentially populate the outer region of the objects .",
    "for this reason , this mechanism has been considered a very efficient way of size growth .",
    "@xcite , following @xcite , show that the fractional variation of the gravitational radius and the velocity dispersion of the main galaxy before ( i ) and after ( f ) a minor merger is :    @xmath72    with @xmath73 defined as m@xmath74=m@xmath75(1+@xmath73 ) and @xmath76 representing the exponent of the local stellar mass - size relation ( r = bm@xmath77 ) .",

    ", we implicitly assume that the gravitational radius is proportional to the effective radius of our galaxies .",
    "this is only strictly correct as long as the galaxies do not change the shape of their surface brightness profiles during the minor merger process .",

    "the final size of the galaxy can be written in terms of the initial size , the size evolution at a fixed stellar mass ( provided by the observations ) and the difference in stellar mass as follows :    @xmath81    the evolution at fixed stellar mass for different redshifts is determined by the size evolution found in our data @xmath82 , with @xmath83 . using eq .",
