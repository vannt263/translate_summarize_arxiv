    "figure  2(b ) of the main article confirms that this is a satisfactory choice .",
    "notice that , with these settings , the corresponding measurement basis vectors @xmath145 are not equispaced on the bloch sphere of qubit @xmath1 ( see figure  [ figs1 ] ) .",
    "this is intentional : we choose in fact to have a denser net around the poles of the @xmath151 axis , because the negativity of our premeasurement states ( for @xmath100 ) is minimized in those regions , as evident from eq .",

    "using notions borrowed from the geometry of metric spaces .",
    "our construction is reminiscent of a so - called @xmath15-net  @xcite . from our perspective",
    ", an @xmath15-net on a metric space @xmath153 can be roughly described as an optimal sampling of the space .",
    "an @xmath15-net is a subset @xmath154 of points of @xmath153 such that any point in @xmath153 is not more than @xmath15-away from a point in @xmath154 , i.e.  the net `` covers '' the space @xmath153 , and such that the elements of the net are at least @xmath15-away from each other .",
    "the crucial aspect is that such a subset @xmath154 can be discrete , while the original space @xmath153 is continuous .",
    "for instance , a discrete set @xmath155 of @xmath156 points realizes an @xmath15-net for the metric space @xmath153 if the union of @xmath156 `` balls '' of radius @xmath15 centered at points @xmath157 covers @xmath153 , while the @xmath156 `` balls '' centered at the same points but with radius @xmath158 are all disjoint .",
    "our choice of the measurement settings @xmath159 ) obviously defines an @xmath15-net for the two - dimensional space spanned by the waveplates angles @xmath132 equipped with the euclidean distance , for any @xmath160 .",
    "what is more interesting , though , is to investigate whether the corresponding basis vectors @xmath144 also define a proper @xmath15-net on the bloch sphere of qubit @xmath1 . to proceed , we need to adopt a metric on the unit sphere @xmath161 .        we observe that , remarkably , the first continuity bound on the negativity of premeasurement states , derived in eq .",
    "( [ eq : bound1 ] ) , coincides exactly with the euclidean metric between two points on the bloch sphere associated to bloch vectors @xmath24 , @xmath107 , respectively , i.e. , with @xmath162 we are then naturally induced to choose this metric ( that is different from other valid choices such as the riemannian metric on the surface of the sphere ) for our analysis .",
    "thus , we are interested in covering the bloch sphere by spherical caps centered at our chosen basis vectors @xmath144 and characterized by base circles with radius @xmath163 , such that the vectors @xmath107 forming the base circle of each cap are at distance @xmath15 from the center , namely @xmath164 . from elementary geometry",
    "we see that the cap base radius relates to @xmath15 according to the formula @xmath165 in figure  [ figs1 ] , we show that by choosing @xmath166 our measurement settings realize precisely an @xmath15-net for the bloch sphere .    the problem of defining sampling sets such that the output negativity stays nonzero , according to the lower bound of eq .",
    "( [ eq : bound1 ] ) , can then be interpreted geometrically in terms of defining minimal @xmath15-nets for the bloch sphere . in figure  [ figs1](c )",
    "we overlay the bloch sphere with a density plot of the lower bound @xmath167 on the output negativity , constructed from the experimental data as in figure  2 of the main article , for @xmath168 .",
    "this state has small but nonzero input discord , and we can certify that its negativity stays nonzero for all possible bloch measurement bases . notice how the points when the bound reaches its minimum ( staying nonzero ) are those which maximize the euclidean distance from all the neighboring measured positions . at these points , such as the orange region in the top - left corner , or the rim around the poles on the @xmath151 axis , the bloch sphere would not be covered anymore if one decreased the value of @xmath15 .",

    "we detail the experimental procedures to obtain the results of figure  3(a ) of the main text . to demonstrate that input bipartite discord activates quantitatively into bipartite entanglement with the apparatus @xcite , we have adopted two different procedures for the evaluation of @xmath172 ( input discord ) and @xmath173 ( minimum output bipartite entanglement ) from the measured data . for the input trace - distance discord @xmath172 , we have reconstructed the density matrix of qubits @xmath0 and @xmath1 after @xmath23 but removing the c - not operation",

    "<S> ( [ statoq ] ) has zero discord , is the only case in which for certain values of @xmath23 the apparatus @xmath2 does not necessarily entangle with the observed system @xmath3 , in accordance with the theoretical formulation of the activation protocol @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> we complete our plots with a grid of lower bounds to @xmath57 for arbitrary @xmath58 . </S>",
    "<S> the bounds , which originate from purposely derived continuity limits for the negativity @xcite , allow us to infer  based on the finite net of experimental data  that for @xmath35 the premeasurement state will always display entanglement between @xmath2 and the @xmath3 for all possible measurement choices on @xmath1 , hence providing a sound verification of the activation theorem @xcite . only in the case </S>",
    "<S> @xmath34 , when the initial state @xmath9 of eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ statoq ] ) has zero discord , we find that for certain measurement settings @xmath59 is essentially vanishing within the experimental imperfections . </S>",
    "<S> the output entanglement was generally found to be minimized by @xmath60 ; while for @xmath61 , any choice of @xmath23 produces the same entanglement in the premeasurement state apart from experimental fluctuations , see figure  [ fignets](b ) </S>",
    "<S> .    we can now exploit our data to verify the quantitative prediction of the activation theorem @xcite , as shown in figure  [ figattiva](a ) . </S>",
    "<S> we find experimentally that the minimum output entanglement @xmath62 generated with the apparatus , measured by negativity , precisely matches the amount of trace - distance discord @xmath63 initially detected between @xmath0 and @xmath1 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this demonstrates the operational power of discord as `` entanglement potential '' @xcite . and proves successfully the activation of distillable bipartite entanglement from input discord . </S>",
    "<S> small discrepancies ( of at most @xmath64 units ) from the theoretical green line can be traced back to imperfections in the initial preparation of the four polarization bell states of photons a and bm , which in our implementation reach a mean purity of @xmath65 , consistent e.g.  with the experimental value for @xmath66 . </S>",
    "<S> finally , in case the initial state @xmath33 is entangled as well , we observe that genuine tripartite entanglement is created in the premeasurement state among @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 as a result of the activation protocol @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this is verified by detecting suitable entanglement witnesses @xcite for input and output states @xcite as presented in figure  [ figattiva](b ) . </S>",
    "<S> theoretically , the expectation values for both witnesses on the corresponding states should coincide and be given by @xmath67 ( solid green line ) ; we find a satisfactory agreement between the two datasets and the theory , detecting in particular negative expectation values for the two witnesses in the relevant parameter range @xmath36 . </S>",
    "<S> * conclusions . * </S>",
    "<S> the experimental observation of the activation protocol , presented as an abstract theorem in @xcite , brings the notion of quantumness in composite systems to a more concrete level than ever before . </S>",
    "<S> our demonstration establishes the usefulness of various forms of nonclassical correlations as resources for information processing : discord is necessarily activated into bipartite entanglement , and bipartite entanglement into genuine tripartite entanglement , by the act of performing a local measurement . </S>",
    "<S> we believe an approach based on an @xmath15-net construction such as ours can effectively be adopted in future experiments aimed at substantiating mathematical predictions via sampling continuously distributed parameters , in particular in worst case scenarios . </S>",
    "<S> the implementation of a von neumann chain @xcite may be further considered , exploiting recent advances in integrated quantum photonics @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we hope our work can stimulate further endeavours towards a deeper physical understanding and practical exploitation of _ quantumness _ , in its manifold manifestations , for information processing and communication .    </S>",

    "<S> the negativity of quantumness , a measure of discord , can be defined in terms of the activation framework of figure  [ setup](a ) @xcite as @xmath72 ( notice that the entanglement in the premeasurement states @xmath73 is always distillable @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> the trace - distance discord @xmath40 is defined as the minimum distance , in trace norm , between @xmath9 and the set of quantum - classical states @xmath11 , namely @xmath74 @xcite . </S>",
