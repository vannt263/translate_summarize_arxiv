    "<S> we present the calculations of the complete nlo inclusive total cross sections for pair production of neutral higgs bosons through @xmath0 annihilation in the minimal supersymmetric standard model at the cern large hadron collider . in our calculations , we used both the dreg scheme and the dred scheme and found that the nlo total cross sections in these two schemes are the same . </S>",
    "<S> our results show that the @xmath0-annihilation contributions can exceed those of @xmath1 fusion and @xmath2 annihilation for @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 productions when @xmath6 is large . in the case of @xmath7 , </S>",
    "<S> the nlo corrections enhance the lo total cross sections significantly , reaching a few tens of percent , while for @xmath8 , the corrections are relatively small , and are negative in most of parameter space . moreover , the nlo qcd corrections reduce the dependence of the total cross sections on the renormalization / factorization scale , especially for @xmath8 </S>",
    "<S> . we also used the cteq6.1 pdf sets to estimate the uncertainty of lo and nlo total cross sections , and found that the uncertainty arising from the choice of pdfs increases with the increasing @xmath9 . </S>"
