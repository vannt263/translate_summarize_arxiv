    "fig : cn - offsite(c ) we use thin and thick lines to distinguish portions of the @xmath40 curves representing such single- and double - humped profiles . again , in the limit of the strong nonlocality , the correction to the refractive index induced by the nonlocal nonlinearity is widely spread in the space and very small with respect to the effect of the kerr nonlinearity , which makes the competition negligible .",

    "<S> we analyze the existence , bifurcations , and shape transformations of one - dimensional gap solitons ( gss ) in the first finite bandgap induced by a periodic potential built into materials with local self - focusing and nonlocal self - defocusing nonlinearities . </S>",
    "<S> originally stable on - site gs modes become unstable near the upper edge of the bandgap with the introduction of the nonlocal self - defocusing nonlinearity with a small nonlocality radius . </S>",
    "<S> unstable off - site gss bifurcate into a new branch featuring single - humped , double - humped , and flat - top modes due to the competition between local and nonlocal nonlinearities . </S>",
    "<S> the mechanism underlying the complex bifurcation pattern and cutoff effects ( termination of some bifurcation branches ) is illustrated in terms of the shape transformation under the action of the varying degree of the nonlocality . </S>",
    "<S> the results of this work suggest a possibility of optical - signal processing by means of the competing nonlocal and local nonlinearities . </S>"
