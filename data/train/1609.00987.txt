    ". the black - scholes theory , however , does not describe well extreme events , such as dramatic prices drops , which , in the past few decades , appeared to occur more often than expected by gaussian models @xcite ; several other models have thus been proposed to describe better the complexity of financial markets . among these models , those involving _",

    "however , in general , a price ( or log - price ) @xmath11 driven by a lvy distribution does not possess finite moments @xmath12 , resulting in potentially infinite option values ( see @xcite and references therein ) . to cope with this divergence , carr and wu introduced , in 2003 , a model featuring a lvy - driven underlying price @xcite , with a so - called condition of _ maximal negative skewness _ on the levy process that ensures the option price to remain finite . following carr and wu",
    ", we will refer to this model as the _ fmls _ ( finite moment log stable ) or symply the _ lvy - stable _ model .",
    "existing option pricing methods under lvy stable model include monte - carlo related simulations @xcite , which converge with a very good degree of precision ( although structurally possessing a statistical error ) , and numerical evaluation of integrals ( mellin - barnes integrals in @xcite , integrals on the lvy density in @xcite ) .",
    "however , so far , no simple closed formula existed to evaluate the option price directly , like one does in the black - scholes case .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to establish such a formula for the lvy - stable model . in this introductory section",
    "we briefly recall some facts and notations about the bs and log - lvy models , and the main results contained in this paper .",

    "in this model , the underlying price is assumed to be described by the stochastic differential equation @xmath32 where @xmath33 is a lvy distribution ( see the extensive textbook @xcite ) .",
    "it possesses two parameters : the _ stability parameter _ @xmath34 $ ] wich controls the departure from a standard brownian motion ( @xmath35 being the case where the lvy process degenerates into a brownian motion ) ; and an _ asymetry _ , or _",

    "it corresponds to the value @xmath40 or , equivalently , in the feller - takayasu representation , @xmath41 . in this case , the price of an european call option can be written out as @xcite : @xmath42^+ g_\\alpha\\left(\\frac{y}{(-\\lambda \\tau)^{\\frac{1}{\\alpha}}},\\tau\\right ) dy\\ ] ] where @xmath43 and where the green function satisfies the fractional diffusion equation @xmath44 note that , in the degenerate case @xmath35 , then @xmath45 , @xmath46 is the heat kernel and ( [ levy_green ] ) reduces to the black - scholes price ( [ bs_green ] ) .",

    "in this section , we briefly present some models to consider if one wishes to extend the formula ( [ levy_closed ] ) ; if some of these extensions are immediate , others need more in - depth reflections and constitute an excellent perspective of future works .",
    "an interesting way of generalizing the lvy - stable model is to introduce a fractional time - derivative in the space - fractional diffusion ( [ fractional_pde_2 ] ) @xmath68 where @xmath69 is a so - called _ caputo derivative _ of order @xmath70 ( coinciding with the usual time - derivative for @xmath71 ) ; it is shown in @xcite that the general green function reads @xmath72 under the maximal skewness assumption @xmath73 , the green function @xmath74 thus reads @xmath75 the green representation for the option price is then @xcite : @xmath76^+ \\frac{1}{2i\\pi } \\int\\limits_{c_{t_1}-i\\infty}^{c_{t_1}+i\\infty } \\frac{\\gamma(1-t_1)}{\\gamma(1-\\frac{\\gamma}{\\alpha}t_1)}\\ , 2^{\\frac{t_1}{\\alpha}}(\\sigma\\bar{\\bar \\tau})^{-t_1 } y^{t_1 - 1}\\,dt _ 1dy\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] where we denote @xmath77 .",
    "it is immediate to adapt the pricing formula ( [ levy_closed ] ) and obtain :    where @xmath78 .",
    "a similar formula can also be obtained when considering a riesz - feller time - derivative instead of the caputo one ; these results will be detailed in a future article .",
    "without maximal negative skewness condition , the green function is @xcite : @xmath79 and therefore , when summing the residues in the cone @xmath80 , one expects the @xmath81 term in the pricing formula ( [ levy_closed ] ) to be replaced by @xmath82 the presence of @xmath83-induced singularities in the @xmath84 half - plane implies the existence of a second cone containing singularities , and it is for the moment unclear to the authors whether this cone contains some financially relevant information .",
    "however , before engaging into this study , one should keep in mind that this model generates infinite moments and potentially divergent option prices , and thus should be completed by suitable regularization assumptions or resummation of the resulting series @xcite .",
    "formula ( [ levy_closed ] ) is a new and efficient analytic formula in the non - gaussian world ; it provides the market practitioner with a simple tool that can easily be implemented in an excel sheet , without possessing any coding skills .",
    "the series terms are straightforward to evaluate by simple functions - the only `` transcendence '' being carried by the particular values of the gamma function , that are easily performed with excel .",
    "the convergence is fast enough to ensure excellent levels of precision only with summing the first few terms of the series ; moreover , as there is no need to use a simulation , there is no statistical error and the degree of precision is arbitrarily high ( it suffices to take more term in consideration when performing the sum ) .    we have also given the way to extend the formula to other lvy related models ; the extension to time - fractional lvy - stable models is immediate , and lvy processes with arbitrary asymmetry can also be considered within the same framework if one suitably renormalizes the divergence .",
    "future works should include a proper consideration of these models , as well as incorporating other features such as stochastic volatility for instance .",
    "solving pde with multidimensional complex analysis tools applies to a wide range of problems , and our `` distributional trick '' is particularly suitable when a green formulation is involved .",
    "the authors also plan to apply this method to other financial models to get precise estimates without having to use numerical tools .",
