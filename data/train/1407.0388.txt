    "many social , biological , and technological systems possess a characteristic network structure consisting of communities or modules , which are groups of nodes distinguished by having a high density of links between nodes of the same group and a comparatively low density of links between nodes of different groups @xcite .",
    "such a network structure is expected to play an important functional role in many systems . in a social network",
    ", communities might indicate factions , interest groups , or social divisions @xcite ; in biological networks , they encompass entities having the same biological function @xcite ; in the world wide web they may correspond to groups of pages dealing with the same or related topics @xcite ; in food webs they may identify compartments @xcite ; and a community in a metabolic or genetic network might be related to a specific functional task @xcite .",
    "since community structure constitutes a fundamental feature of many networks , the development of methods and techniques for the detection of communities represents one of the most active research areas in network science @xcite . in comparison ,",
    "much less work has been done to address a fundamental question : how do communities arise in networks ?",
    "@xcite .",
    "clearly , the emergence of characteristic topological structures , including communities , from a random or featureless network requires some dynamical process that modifies the properties of the links representing the interactions between nodes .",
    "we refer to such link dynamics as a _",
    "rewiring process_. links can vary their strength , or they can appear and disappear as a consequence of a rewiring process . in our view ,",
    "two classes of rewiring processes leading to the formation of structures in networks can be distinguished : ( i ) rewirings based on local connectivity properties regardless of the values of the state variables of the nodes , which we denote as _ topological rewirings _ ; and ( ii ) rewirings that depend on the state variables of the nodes , where the link dynamics is coupled to the node state dynamics and which we call _ adaptive rewirings_.    topological rewiring processes have been employed to explain the origin of small - world and scale - free networks @xcite . these rewirings can lead to the appearance of community structures in networks with weighted links @xcite or by preferential attachment driven by local clustering @xcite . on the other hand , there is currently much interest in the study of networks that exhibit a coupling between topology and states , since many systems observed in nature can be described as dynamical networks of interacting nodes where the connections and the states of the nodes affect each other and evolve simultaneously @xcite .",
    "these systems have been denoted as coevolutionary dynamical systems or adaptive networks and , according to our classification above , they are subject to adaptive rewiring processes . the collective behavior of coevolutionary systems is determined by the competition of the time scales of the node dynamics and the rewiring process .",
    "most works that employ coevolutionary dynamics have focused on the characterization of the phenomenon of network fragmentation arising from this competition .",
    "although community structures have been found in some coevolutionary systems @xcite , investigating the mechanisms for the formation of perdurable communities remains an open problem .    in this paper",
    "we investigate the emergence and the persistence of communities in networks induced by a process of adaptive rewiring .",
    "our work is based on a recently proposed general framework for coevolutionary dynamics in networks @xcite .",
    "we characterize the topological structures forming in a coevolutionary network having a simple node dynamics .",
    "we unveil a region of parameters where the formation of a supertransient modular structure on the network occurs .",
    "we study the stability of the community configuration under small perturbations of the node dynamics , as well as for different initial conditions of the system .",
    "we recall that a rewiring process in a coevolutionary network can be described in terms of two basic actions that can be independent of each other : disconnection and connection between nodes @xcite .",
    "these actions may correspond to discrete connection - disconnection events , or to continuous increase - decrease strength of the links , as in weighted networks .",
    "both actions in an adaptive rewiring process are , in general , based on some mechanisms of comparison of the states of the nodes .",
    "the disconnection action can be characterized by a parameter @xmath0 $ ] , that measures the probability that two nodes in identical states become disconnected , and such that @xmath1 is the probability that two nodes in different states disconnect from each other . on the other hand , the connection action can be characterized by another parameter @xmath2 $ ] that describes the probability that two nodes in identical states become connected , and such that @xmath3 is the probability that two nodes in different states connect to each other @xcite . in a social context , these actions allow the description of diverse manifestations of phenomena such as inclusion - exclusion , homophily - heterophily , and tolerance - intolerance .    to investigate the formation of topological structures through an adaptive rewiring process , we consider a random network of @xmath4 nodes having average degree @xmath5 .",
    "let @xmath6 be the set of neighbors of node @xmath7 , possessing @xmath8 elements .",
    "the state variable of node @xmath7 is denoted by @xmath9 . for simplicity , we assume that the node state variable is discrete , that is , @xmath9 can take any of @xmath10 possible options",
    ". the states @xmath9 are initially assigned at random with a uniform distribution .",
    "therefore there are , on the average , @xmath11 nodes in each state in the initial random network .",
    "we assume that the network is subject to a rewiring process whose actions are characterized by parameters @xmath12 and @xmath13 .    for the node dynamics , we employ an imitation rule such as a voterlike model that has been used in several contexts @xcite .",
    "this model provides a simple dynamics for the node state change without introducing any additional parameter .",
    "parameters of the node dynamics can modify the time scale of the change of state of the nodes @xcite ; however , those parameters should not produce qualitative changes in the global behavior of the system .    then , the coevolution dynamics in this system is given by iterating these three steps : ( 1 ) chose at random a node @xmath7 such that @xmath14 . ( 2 ) apply the rewiring process : select at random a neighbor @xmath15 and a node @xmath16 .",
    "if the edge @xmath17 can be disconnected according to the rule of the disconnection action and the nodes @xmath7 and @xmath18 can be connected according to the rule of the connection action , break the edge @xmath19 and create the edge @xmath20 .",
    "( 3 ) apply the node dynamics : chose randomly a node @xmath21 such that @xmath22 and set @xmath23 .",
    "this rewiring conserves the total number of links in the network .",
    "we have verified that the collective behavior of this system is statistically invariant if steps ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) are reversed .",
    "the parameters @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and @xmath10 remain constant .",
    "we also maintain fixed the ratio @xmath24 .    to study the dynamical behavior of the network topology",
    ", we consider the time evolution of several statistical quantities in the system for different values of the parameters @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "we characterize the integrity of the network by calculating the normalized ( divided by @xmath4 ) average size of the largest component or connected subgraph in the system , regardless of the states of the nodes , at time @xmath25 denoted by @xmath26 , where a time step consists of @xmath4 iterations of the algorithm .",
    "we call a domain a subset of connected nodes that share the same state , and denote by @xmath27 the normalized average size of the largest domain in the system at time @xmath25 .",
    "additionally , we calculate the fraction of links that are active in the system at a given time , that we call @xmath28 .",
    "a link is active if it connects two nodes in different states .",
    "lastly , as a measure of the modular structure of the network , we define the quantity @xmath29 as the modularity change , where @xmath30 is the modularity of the network at time @xmath25 , calculated through a community detection algorithm @xcite , and @xmath31 is the value of this quantity for the initial random network .",
    "figure  [ f2 ] shows the above four quantities as functions of time for a fixed value @xmath32 and different values of @xmath13 . for @xmath33 , fig .",
    "[ f2](a ) reveals that @xmath34 for all times , a value corresponding to a large component whose size is comparable to that of the system .",
    "this indicates that the network remains connected during the evolution of the system .",
    "the quantity @xmath27 initially increases in time until it reaches a stationary value @xmath35 during a long time interval ( four orders of magnitude ) ; there are two connected groups of nodes in different states on the average .",
    "due to finite size fluctuations @xcite , the system eventually reaches a homogeneous absorbing state , where @xmath36 .",
    "however , the sizes of these fluctuations decrease as the size of the system increases , until they decay to zero in the limit @xmath37 ; in that situation the homogeneous absorbing state is not reached @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the fraction of active links @xmath28 decreases as @xmath27 increases , until @xmath28 reaches a stationary value during the same interval of time as @xmath27 becomes stationary .",

    "the subsistence of a minimum fraction of active links in the network for a long time permits the reattachment of separated domains to form a large connected network during this time interval , characterized by @xmath59 and @xmath62 .",
    "since active links connect different domains , then the majority of links must lie inside the different domains coexisting on the large connected network .",

    "the value of @xmath96 in this region corresponds to the value of this quantity observed in the temporal plateau in fig .",
    "our results show that , for an intermediate range of noise intensity , the modular structure can be sustained in time in a finite size coevolutionary system . an appropriate level of noise keeps the diversity of states in the system and prevents the disappearance of active links . as a consequence , the convergence to a homogeneous asymptotic state does not occur .",
    "the role of noise in the modular configuration is similar to that of the limit of infinite system size , @xmath97 , where a diversity of states is always present and domains can subsist indefinitely .",

    "we have found that , for some values of the parameters @xmath13 and @xmath12 characterizing these actions , a modular structure emerges previous to the settlement of a random network topology .",
    "the actions of the rewiring process modify the competition between the time scales of the rewiring and the node dynamics , and therefore they can also control the emergence of communities .",
    "the modular behavior separates two network configurations on the space of parameters @xmath77 : a state where the initial random topology stays stationary in time , and a fragmented configuration .",
    "we have shown that the modular structure is a supertransient state .",
    "the presence of communities has been characterized by several collective properties : the network is connected ( @xmath60 ) ; there are various domains coexisting on the network ( @xmath98 ) ; and the modularity measure increases with respect to that of the initial random network ( @xmath88 ) .",
    "the formation of modular structures is related to the number of active links present in the network : communities emerge when the fraction of those links drops to small values .",
    "since active links are associated with contact points that define the interphase between different domains in the network , a low density of active links means a restriction to the possibility of growth for domains . as a result ,",
    "different domains are connected by few links , leading to the appearance of communities .",
    "the appearance of a short - lived modular structure always precedes the fragmentation of the network : fig .",
    "[ f2](b ) shows that the quantities @xmath40 , @xmath53 , @xmath42 , and @xmath44 at time @xmath99 reach those values associated to a modular structure .",
    "we have verified , by plotting successive snapshots , that the network topology indeed passes through a modular phase before becoming fragmented .",
    "thus , communities constitute temporary configurations that are likely to emerge during the evolution of the network topology of coevolutionary systems .",
    "community structure has also been observed in the transient dynamics of models of epidemic spreading on adaptive networks @xcite .",
    "we have found that , for appropriate parameter values of the corresponding adaptive rewiring process , the community structure can become a supertransient state .",
    "we have shown that noise in the node dynamics can sustain a diversity of states and the community structure in time in a finite size coevolutionary system .",
    "the role of noise on the lifetime of the modular structure state is similar to that of the limit of infinite system size .",
    "thus , large system size and/or local noise can explain the persistence of communities and diversity in many real systems @xcite .",

    "<S> we characterize the topological structures arising in a coevolutionary network subject to an adaptive rewiring process and a node dynamics given by a simple voterlike rule . </S>",
    "<S> we find that , for some values of the parameters describing the adaptive rewiring process , a community structure emerges on a connected network . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the emergence of communities is associated to a decrease in the number of active links in the system , i.e. links that connect two nodes in different states . the lifetime of the community structure state scales exponentially with the size of the system . additionally , we find that a small noise in the node dynamics can sustain a diversity of states and a community structure in time in a finite size system . </S>",
    "<S> thus , large system size and/or local noise can explain the persistence of communities and diversity in many real systems . </S>"
