    "consider a gas with two components @xmath0 and @xmath1 , and suppose that @xmath1 has contains considerably more molecules than @xmath0 .",
    "if @xmath0 is selectively heated to a high temperature , then collisions between the molecules of @xmath0 and @xmath1 will return @xmath0 to its equilibrium state .",
    "we will call this process thermal equilibration .",
    "the starting point for studying thermal equilibration theoretically is the boltzmann equation .",
    "this has been the the subject of considerable research for many years and has produced a vast literature .",
    "see [ 1 ] and [ 2 ] for recent reviews on the topic and a large list of references .",
    "research over the last decade has focused mainly on the rate of approach of the boltzmann equation to equilibrium , and various bounds have been deduced for spatially homogeneous [ 3 , 4 ] and inhomogeneous [ 5 , 6 , 7 ] systems .",
    "an alternative approach is provided by stochastic models of brownian motion , usually the ornstein - uhlenbeck process and other diffusion processes .",
    "stochastic models of the brownian motion have also spawned an enormous literature ( see , for example , [ 8 ] and [ 9 ] ) .",
    "the advantage of stochastic models of the brownian motion over the boltzmann equation in modelling thermal equilibration is that they can be solved relatively easily .",
    "however , this is matched by an important disadvantage , namely that they provide relative little information on the microscopic collision dynamics .",
    "recent studies on this topic have therefore looked at the connection between diffusion processes and more detailed collision models in certain limits .",
    "these include lorentzian gas models [ 10 , 11 ] , heat bath models [ 12 ] , and models of systems interacting with sequences of classical [ 13 ] and quantum systems [ 14 , 15 ] . through studies involving the boltzmann equation and stochastic models , a relatively detailed picture of",
    "ther thermal equilibration process is beginning to emerge .",
    "this paper will provide a further insight into the thermal equilibration process",
    ". we will show how thermal equilibration can be interpreted in a similar way to an apparently very different non - equilibrium process .",
    "namely , transverse relaxation in a magnetic resonance experiment ( also known as @xmath4 relaxation and spin - spin relaxation ) .",
    "figure 1 illustrates transverse relaxation for a group of spins embedded in a crystal . omitting several details",
    ", the magnetic resonance experiment involves aligining the spins vectors in the @xmath5-plane with an electromagnetic pulse at time 0 . following this , the spin vectors rotate in the @xmath5-plane together and in near unison .",
    "however , random interactions with the environment surrounding each spin causes the angular frequencies of the spins to fluctuate with time .",
    "this causes the spin vectors to fall out of alignment with each other .",
    "if we plot the @xmath6 or @xmath7 component of the spins as a function of time , we therefore see a series of oscillations that gradually fall out of step with each other ( figure 2 ) [ 16 , 17 , 18 , 19 , 20 , 21 , 22 ] .",
    "transverse relaxation can monitored in the laboratory by observing the decay of the net electrical current induced by the rotating spins with time .",
    "this decay can be thought of as arising from destructive interference between the oscillations associated with each spin , like those shown in figure 2 .",
    "the analogy between thermal equilibration and transverse relaxation is constructed as follows .",
    "the kinetic energy space of the molecules in @xmath0 is divided into a ` low energy ' region and a ` high energy region ' .",
    "initially , the molecules in @xmath0 all start in the same region of the kinetic energy space ( figure 3 ) . however , as time proceeds the molecules of @xmath0 switch ( ` oscillate ' ) between the two states due to collisions with the molecules of @xmath1 ( see figure 4 ) .",
    "because each molecule in @xmath0 collides with molecules of @xmath1 at different times , the oscillation associated with each molecule falls out of phase with one another .",
    "there is a net destructive interference between the oscillations , and therefore the individual oscillations are not seen when the thermal equilibration process is monitored through the average kinetic energy of @xmath0 .",
    "the ` oscillations ' that are described here are not true oscillations because they only involve shifting between two states , rather than a continuous spectrum of states like we have with the @xmath6 or @xmath7 component of a spin .",
    "however , the terminology is useful for describing the analogy with the transverse relaxation problem .",
    "the model that we will use involves randomly occurring elastic collisions between the molecules of @xmath0 and @xmath1 , and falls somewhere between the boltzmann equation and the ornstein - uhlenbeck equation in terms of its physical detail . for completeness we will therefore show how the model is related to the boltzmann and ornstein - uhlenbeck equation .",
    "section 2 describes the model and its basic properties and shows how it is related to the boltzmann equation and the ornstein - uhlenbeck process .",
    "section 3 then describes the analogy between transverse relaxation and thermal equilibration in detail .",
    "consider a one - dimensional , spatially homogeneous gas with two components , a small component @xmath0 and relatively large component @xmath1 .",
    "the molecules in @xmath0 and @xmath1 have masses @xmath8 and @xmath9 , respectively , with @xmath10 .",
    "suppose that at time 0 the molecules in @xmath0 are instantaneously brought out of thermal equilibrium by an outside influence ( e.g. , a laser pulse ) .",
    "consider an individual molecule @xmath11 . from time 0 , the first particle from @xmath1 that @xmath12 collides with is denoted by @xmath13 , the second particle by @xmath14 , and so on .",
    "we assume elastic collisions between the molecules of @xmath1 and @xmath0 , i.e. , upon colliding with @xmath15 the velocity of @xmath12 becomes    @xmath16    where @xmath17 is the velocity of @xmath15 and    @xmath18    by induction , ( 2.1 ) is    @xmath19",
    "we will assume that @xmath20 are independent @xmath21 random variables , and that @xmath22 and is independent of @xmath20 .",
    "these assumptions are standard assumptions in gas - gas collision models .",
    "we will also ignore collisions between molecules in @xmath0 .",
    "the stochastic process @xmath23 , where each @xmath24 is given by ( 2.2 ) , is called the _ collision velocity process_. @xmath25 is defined with respect to the probability space @xmath26 .    in the laboratory ,",
    "equilibration is measured with respect to time , rather than the number of collisions that have occurred .",
    "let @xmath27 be the time of collision between @xmath12 and @xmath13 , @xmath28 the length of time between colliding with @xmath13 and @xmath14 , and so on .",
    "we will assume that @xmath29 are independent exponential random variables , i.e. , for all @xmath30 ,    @xmath31    where @xmath32 is the average frequency of collisions , and that @xmath29 are independent of @xmath20 and @xmath33 .",
    "this means that the number of collisions that @xmath12 has experienced by time @xmath34 is the value of a poisson process @xmath35 at time @xmath34 .",
    "this process is also independent of @xmath20 and @xmath33 .",
    "thus , the velocity of the particle at time @xmath34 is simply    @xmath36    the stochastic process @xmath37 , where each @xmath38 is given by ( 2.4 ) , is called the _ time velocity process_. @xmath39 is also defined with respect to @xmath40 .",
    "the time parameter of the time - dependent stochastic processes is written inside of the parenthesis to distinguish the time velocity process from the collision velocity process .",
    "the advantage of defining the ` collision velocity process ' and the ` time velocity process ' separately is that relatively difficult calculations on the time velocity process can instead be performed on the collision velocity process .",
    "for example , for the collision velocity process we have    @xmath41    @xmath42    for all @xmath43 . to prove the second result , note that @xmath44 is a weighted sum of independent normal random variables , and so    @xmath45    because @xmath46 , we can work out the variance of the time velocity process at time @xmath34 by conditioning arguments .",
    "we find that    @xmath47    a good definition of an ` equilibrium distribution ' is also needed to discuss the equilibration process .",
    "the following is satisfactory .",
    "the collision velocity process and time velocity process are said to have an _ equilibrium distribution _ if for all @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath50 are well - defined probabilities .",
    "the collision velocity processes and time velocity processes each have an equilibrium distribution .",
    "choose a @xmath48 .",
    "each @xmath24 is a sum of normal random variables ( 2.2 ) and are therefore normal random variables with mean and variance given by ( 2.5 ) and ( 2.6 ) .",
    "these two quantities determine the distribution .",
    "this means that @xmath51 , which is a well - defined probability .",
    "we can expand the distribution of any @xmath38 with the total rule of probability , i.e. ,    @xmath52    from the poisson distribution ( @xmath53 ) we can show that @xmath54 if @xmath55 and is zero otherwise",
    ". therefore ,    @xmath56    which is well - defined by the previous result .",
    "the theorem then follows from the fact that @xmath57 is arbitrary .",
    "the above proof shows that the equilibrium distributions of both the collision velocity process and the time velocity process are normal with mean zero and variance @xmath58 .      to establish the connection of the above model with the boltzmann equation ,",
    "let us briefly ignore the results in the previous section and consider how a physicist would approach the problem .",
    "we will deliberately gloss over certain mathematical technicalities to stay true to the approach . in its most general form ,",
    "the boltzmann equation for a spatially homogeneous gas under no external forces is    @xmath59    the probability density @xmath60 is proportional to the number of molecules in @xmath0 with velocities in @xmath61 at time @xmath34 , where @xmath62 is a small constant . the collision term @xmath63 is equal to the sum of a loss and a gain term . to calculate the loss term ,",
    "notice that for very small @xmath62 almost all molecules in @xmath0 with velocity @xmath57 will leave @xmath64 if they experience a collision with a molecule from @xmath1 .",
    "this can be seen directly from equation ( 1 ) .",
    "therefore , the change in the density of molecules in @xmath64 due to such collisions during a short time interval of length @xmath65 is    @xmath66    where @xmath67 is the probability of a collision during the interval @xmath65 .",
    "the first term on the right - hand side of ( 2.9 ) is the fraction of molecules in @xmath0 with velocities in @xmath68 at time @xmath34 that still have velocities in @xmath68 after the time period @xmath65 .",
    "expanding @xmath67 to first order in @xmath65 gives    @xmath69    where @xmath70 is a constant . to obtain ( 2.10 ) , @xmath71 was set to 0 .",
    "we therefore have @xmath72 . dividing through by @xmath65 and taking the limit @xmath73 and @xmath74",
    "gives the loss contribution of @xmath75 :    @xmath76    as for the gain term , consider a molecule in @xmath0 which , at the beginning of the time interval @xmath65 , has a velocity @xmath77 . according to ( 2.1 ) , this molecule will acquire a velocity in @xmath61 if it collides with a molecule from the medium with velocity @xmath6 .",
    "letting @xmath78 denote the velocity density of the surrounding gas ( which is time independent ) , the change in the velocity probability density of the molecules in @xmath0 at point @xmath57 due to these collisions is    @xmath79    expanding @xmath67 to first order in @xmath65 , dividing through by @xmath65 and taking the limit @xmath73 and @xmath74 gives the gain contribution of @xmath80 ,    @xmath81    substituting ( 2.11 ) and ( 2.12 ) into ( 2.8 ) gives    @xmath82    ( 2.13 ) is the boltzmann equation for our elastic collision model .",
    "the constant @xmath70 could be determined by initial conditions , however we will not do this here .",
    "let us now consider the time velocity process described in the previous section .",
    "the time velocity process is a stochastic representation of ( 2.13 ) in the following sense .",
    "let @xmath60 denote the probability density function of the random variable @xmath38 at point @xmath48",
    ". then @xmath83 is given by ( 2.13 ) with @xmath84 .",
    "conditioning @xmath85 on @xmath86 , we can write    @xmath87    because @xmath44 is a normal random variable , @xmath88 is _ a.e _ differentiable with respect to @xmath57 .",
    "differentiating the above equation term - by - term then gives a well - defined expression for the probability density of @xmath85 , namely    @xmath89    where @xmath90 is the probability density of the random variable @xmath44 .",
    "differentiating the above with respect to time gives    @xmath91    by differentiating the poisson distribution we can show that @xmath92 .",
    "therefore ,    @xmath93    where @xmath94 is defined to be zero .",
    "the term on the far right of ( 2.15 ) is equal to @xmath95 .",
    "the first term can be re - written as    @xmath96    according to ( 2.1 ) , the density of @xmath97 is a convolution of the density of @xmath44 at point @xmath98 and the density of @xmath99 at point @xmath6 .",
    "that is ,    @xmath100    substituting ( 2.17 ) into ( 2.16 ) and carrying out the sum gives    @xmath101    substituting ( 2.18 ) into ( 2.15 ) gives the result .",
    "now we will show that as successive collisions between @xmath12 and molecules of @xmath1 occur more and more frequently , the time velocity process converge pointwise in probability to the paths of an ornstein - uhlenbeck process .",
    "the limit that describes this is @xmath102 . a sequence of process @xmath103 is said to converge to a process @xmath104 pointwise in probability if @xmath105 for all @xmath34 .",
    "to prove this , we will construct the time velocity process in a slightly different way .",
    "consider the probability space @xmath106 .",
    "let @xmath107 be a sequence of positive constants such that @xmath108 , and define the family @xmath109 such that    @xmath110    where @xmath111 for each @xmath43 and    @xmath112    for each @xmath43 .",
    "next , let @xmath113 be a wiener process ( following the standard definition , e.g. , [ 25 ] ) on @xmath40 and define a sequence @xmath114 for each @xmath43 such that    @xmath115    where @xmath116 and @xmath117 is a constant .",
    "finally , let the @xmath118 be a sequence of stochastic processes on @xmath40 , where for each @xmath119 ,    @xmath120    where @xmath121 is a constant and @xmath122 .",
    "as with the time velocity process defined earlier , @xmath22 and each poisson process @xmath123 is independent of the sequence @xmath114 and @xmath33 . for each @xmath43 , @xmath114 is a sequence of independent @xmath124 , and so for each @xmath43 the time velocity process defined here satisfies the criteria of definition 2 .",
    "we will now make an important addition to the above construction .",
    "assume that there exists a constant @xmath125 such that    @xmath126    this means that @xmath127 as @xmath102 .",
    "this can be interpreted as follows .",
    "recall the definition of @xmath128 for the processes constructed in section 2 ,    @xmath18    in this case , @xmath129 as @xmath130 .",
    "the assumption that @xmath127 in the present construction might be therefore be taken to mean that @xmath8 becomes very large compared to @xmath9 .",
    "in other words , the limiting time velocity process describes a particle with a very large mass , just as is assumed in the usual theories of brownian motion .",
    "we can use this interpretation to understand the definition of @xmath131 given above . according to this definition ,",
    "@xmath132    this means that the range of velocities in the surrounding gas becomes very narrow in the limit .",
    "this can be understood by imagining ourselves riding on @xmath12 as it travels through the medium . because @xmath12 is very heavy and slow compared to the particles of the surroundings , the particles of the surroundings appear to be moving extremely fast , too fast for us to distinguish their speeds .",
    "the assumptions used in this construction can be regarded as a renormalisation of the time velocity process .",
    "we have employed similar renormalisations in similar studies of weak convergence to gaussian processes [ 22 , 24 ] .",
    "let @xmath133 be the following ou process . for all @xmath134 ,",
    "@xmath135    where @xmath136 and @xmath137 are positive constants and @xmath138 is the wiener process given above .",
    "suppose that @xmath139 _ a.s .",
    "_ and that the integral @xmath140 is an ito integral .",
    "then @xmath141 converges pointwise in probability to an ou process as @xmath142 .    using the assumption @xmath143 ,",
    "@xmath144 can be rewritten as    @xmath145    and if we set    @xmath146    we can write ( 2.20 ) as    @xmath147    let    @xmath148    and    @xmath149    now , let @xmath150 be the jump times of the poisson process @xmath123 , and @xmath151 . to prove that @xmath152 and @xmath153 converge in probability to zero , we will first show that for an arbitrary @xmath43 and @xmath154 , @xmath155 can be brought arbitrary close to @xmath30 ( with respect to an appropriate metric @xmath156 on the space of random variables topologised by convergence in probability , e.g. , the ky fan metric ) with increasing @xmath43 .",
    "for an arbitrary @xmath154 we can use the strong law of large numbers to form the approximation    @xmath157    where the approximation can be made arbitrary accurate ( with respect to the metric @xmath158 ) by increasing @xmath43 .",
    "thus , @xmath155 can be brought arbitrarily close to @xmath30 by increasing @xmath43 , as claimed .    to prove that @xmath159 in probability",
    ", we make the approximation    @xmath160    the continuous mapping theorem shows that this approximation can be made as accurate as desired ( with respect to @xmath158 ) by increasing @xmath43 . because @xmath161 , we can write    @xmath162    where @xmath163 . (",
    "2.3 ) shows that @xmath164 in probability , and appealing to the continuous mapping theorem once again shows that @xmath165 in probability .",
    "we then have that @xmath159 in probability .    as for @xmath166",
    ", we can write    @xmath167    this is because for any three functions @xmath168 , @xmath169 and @xmath170 , @xmath171 @xmath172 @xmath173 .",
    "similar to what was done previously , we can make the approximation    @xmath174    which improves in accuracy as @xmath142 .",
    "then @xmath175 trivially for all @xmath176 .",

    "the integral in term ( t2 ) is an ito integral by assumption , and we can define it as    @xmath195    therefore , it we set    @xmath196    then @xmath197 .",
    "the introduction of this report mentioned several models similar to the above which converge to the ornstein - uhlenbeck process and other similar processes .",
    "however , theorem 2.3 has at least two features that make it interesting .",
    "one reason is that pointwise convergence in probability is a particularly strong mode of convergence .",
    "previous research has mainly considered convergence in distribution [ 10 , 11 , 12 , 13 , 14 , 15 ] .",
    "the other is that ( 2.21 ) and ( 2.22 ) in the proof give simple interpretations of the parameters @xmath136 ( the friction coefficient ) and @xmath137 ( the diffusion coefficient ) .",
    "equation ( 19 ) says that    @xmath198    where @xmath32 and @xmath8 are ` very large ' parameters .",
    "thus , @xmath136 is related to the average collision frequency and a fractional mass difference .",
    "this simply means says that friction on the brownian particle arises when a relatively heavy particle is ambushed by many lighter particles .",
    "this is an alternate interpretation to the standard ` heat bath ' interpretation of the friction coefficient , in which friction is an consequence of a particle simultaneously interacting with many other particles ( see , for example , [ 26 ] ) , rather than a seqeunce of particles like we have here .",
    "( 2.20 ) says that the diffusion coefficient is related to the root - mean - square deviation of the velocities in the surroundings , but that it is independent of other quantities such as the frequency of collisions or the mass of the particles .",
    "we now want to describe the equilibration process in terms of an ` oscillation ' between low energy and high energy states . to make this concept more precise , define    @xmath199    and    @xmath200",
    "if @xmath201 occurs then @xmath12 has gained a net amount of kinetic energy after undergoing @xmath43 collisions with the surrounding gas .",
    "if @xmath202 occurs , then the test particle has lost a net amount of kinetic energy after undergoing @xmath43 collisions with the surrounding gas . for convenience ,",
    "@xmath203 occurs _ a.s_. the appropriate analogues for these events in for the time velocity process are    @xmath204    and    @xmath205    now , let    @xmath206    and    @xmath207    @xmath3 and @xmath2 are the ` low energy ' and ` high energy ' states that we are interested in . if @xmath202 occurs then @xmath208 and if @xmath201 occurs then @xmath209 .",
    "similarly , if @xmath210 occurs then @xmath211 and if @xmath212 occurs then @xmath213 . clearly , @xmath214 occurs _",
    "a.s_.      if @xmath3 and @xmath2 are recurrent , then @xmath12 enters and exits the states @xmath2 and @xmath3 infinitely often ( _ i.o . _ ) with probability 1 as it travels through @xmath1 .",
    "in this situation , @xmath12 therefore switches between high and low energy states over time .",
    "we will refer to this switching as an ` oscillation ' . while this is not a true oscillation , the terminology is useful in order to create the analogy with transverse relaxation in magnetic resonance spectroscopy .",
    "the occurrence of such oscillations is proven in this section .",
    "recall that for a sequence of events @xmath215 ,    @xmath216    @xmath217    the event @xmath218 is permutable because its occurrence will not be affected by finite permutations of the indices of @xmath20 [ 25 ] .",
    "suppose that @xmath219 .",
    "then the hewitt - savage 0 - 1 law implies that @xmath220 .",
    "there therefore exists an @xmath221 such that @xmath222 for all @xmath223 .",
    "in other words ,    @xmath224    for all @xmath223 with probability 1 .",
    "( 2.3 ) shows that    @xmath225    where    @xmath226    substituting this into ( 3.2 ) gives    @xmath227    taking the expected value and noting that @xmath228 and @xmath229 are independent mean zero random variables , we obtain    @xmath230    in the limit @xmath231 , the above becomes @xmath232 , which is nonsensical .",
    "so we conclude that @xmath233 .",
    "a similar argument gives @xmath234 .",
    "now we need to establish the connection between this result and @xmath39 _ entering _ @xmath2 and @xmath3 _ i.o_. a very reasonable definition of this event is    @xmath235    and similarly for @xmath236 .",
    "however , theorem 3.2 immediately implies that @xmath237 occurs with probability 1 .",
    "and so we have the following theorem .    @xmath238    while all molecules in @xmath0 start in the @xmath3 state , they each collide with molecules from @xmath1 at different times , and therefore the oscillations between @xmath2 and @xmath3 eventually fall out of phase with one another ( figure 4 ) .",
    "there is a net destructive interference between the oscillations , and therefore they are not seen if we study the average kinetic energy of the molecules of @xmath0 directly . in this sense , the thermal equilibration of a gas and transverse relaxation of spins in magnetic resonance spectroscopy can be understood in a similar way .",
    "the next two sections will characterise the oscillations by studying their frequency and period .",
    "we will restrict attention to the expected value of these quantities .",
    "define the _ collision crossing number _ ,    @xmath239    @xmath240 is the number of collisions out of @xmath43 collisions that cause @xmath12 to cross the boundary between @xmath2 or @xmath3 .",

    "however , @xmath99 is independent of @xmath44 and @xmath33 and so this inequality will not hold with probability @xmath281 for general @xmath283 and @xmath284 .",
    "so we conclude that @xmath264 . from ( 3.3 ) we then obtain    @xmath285    in other words ,    @xmath286    to complete the proof , note that @xmath287 .",

    "theorem 3.5 says that on average the molecules of @xmath0 oscillate more and more quickly between the high- and low kinetic energy states as @xmath0 approaches equilibrium",
    ". we can understand this with the following analogy .",
    "imagine that we have a hot piece of metal that we want to cool to a particular temperature .",
    "so we dip it into a bucket of cold water for a length of time @xmath314 to cool it down .",

    ". however , now the metal is too hot , so then we put it back into the bucket of water , and so on .",
    "each step adjusts the temperature of the metal , but always ends up undershooting or overshooting the target temperature .",
    "as we get closer to the target temperature , the length of time that we need to heat or cool the metal for becomes shorter and shorter .",
    "the oscillations of the molecules in @xmath0 between high and low energy states can be understood in the same way .",
    "initially the molecule has too much kinetic energy , so the surroundings work to remove energy from it by collisions .",
    "eventually , the molecule has too little kinetic energy , and so the surroundings work to provide it with more kinetic energy .",
    "however , the molecule then ends up acquiring too much kinetic energy , and so on .",
    "the analogy between thermal equilibration and transverse relaxation ends with theorem 3.5 , because in the case of transverse relaxation the average oscillation frequency is time independent [ 16 ] .",
    "computing the average period of the oscillations appears does not appear to be possible in general , particularly because the average periods become shorter with each successive oscillation ( theorem 3.5 ) .",
    "we will instead estimate the average length of the first period and use this as a ` reference value ' to gauge the magitude to the other periods .",
    "the average length of the first period is the expected value of the first hitting time to state @xmath2 .",
    "let    @xmath315    and    @xmath316    putting these together , we have    @xmath317    where @xmath318 are a sequence of independent exponential random variables with expectation @xmath319 .    for @xmath320 and @xmath321",
    "defined above , @xmath322 and @xmath323 .",
    "the second part of the theorem follows from the first part and wald s equation [ 25 ] . to prove the first part , it is sufficient to show that    @xmath324    now , because @xmath203 occurs _",
    "_ ,    @xmath325    and so , by de morgan s law ,    @xmath326    because @xmath327 , we can form the inequality    @xmath328    and so , by monotonicity    @xmath329    theorem 3.2 then implies that    @xmath330    for @xmath321 defined as above ,    @xmath331    let    @xmath332    so that we can re - write @xmath333 as    @xmath334    by the definition of @xmath320 , @xmath335 _ a.s_. alternatively , we can write    @xmath336    using the fact that @xmath337 _ a.s . _ and",
    "that @xmath320 and @xmath33 are independent , taking the expected value of the above gives    @xmath338    we need to deal with the expected values on the left hand side .",
    "first consider @xmath339 . for almost all @xmath340 , either @xmath341 or @xmath342 .",
    "these events are mutually exclusive , and so we can write    @xmath343    now , from ( 3.5 ) we can form the random variable    @xmath344    taking the expected value of this under the condition @xmath345 gives ( because @xmath346 ) ,    @xmath347    similarly , evaluating the expected value under the condition @xmath345 gives @xmath348 .",
    "so we have that @xmath349",
    ". therefore , @xmath350 .",
    "now we will prove that @xmath351 . following the method on pg .",
    "187 of reference [ 25 ] , we can write    @xmath352    because @xmath320 is a stopping time , @xmath353 depends at most upon @xmath354 .",
    "moreover , because @xmath355 and @xmath17 are independent ,    @xmath356    by induction ,    @xmath357    taking the limit leads to @xmath358 .    substituting these results into ( 3.6 )",
    "gives and using the second part of theorem 3.6 completes the proof .",
    "the above proof shows that the tightness of ( 3.4 ) is measured by how close @xmath128 is to 1 . as discussed in section 2.3 , this condition is satisfied when the particles of @xmath0 are very heavy , such as occurs in the brownian motion .",
    "in fact , taking the limit @xmath129 gives    @xmath359    in other words , a brownian particle will almost immediately shift into the @xmath2 state upon being displaced from equilibrium . according to theorem 3.4 , the brownian particle",
    "will oscillate extremely rapidly between the @xmath2 and @xmath3 states . across the ensemble @xmath0 of brownian particles",
    ", these oscillations will occur slightly out of phase with one another , and so the average kinetic energy of the particles in @xmath0 will quickly decay to zero .",
    "let us now consider the other extreme where @xmath360 .",
    "the estimate in ( 3.6 ) simplifies to @xmath361 .",
    "moreover , elementary kinetic theory tells us that the @xmath362 , where @xmath363 is the initial temperature of @xmath0 and @xmath364 the temperature of @xmath1 , respectively .",
    "and so we have the inequality    @xmath365    the parameter @xmath32 will have a dependence upon @xmath363 and @xmath364 as well , and so the relationship between frequency and temperature is not as simple as the above suggests .",
    "if @xmath363 is much greater than @xmath364 , then the molecules of @xmath0 will initially be traveling much faster than those of @xmath1 and so the molecules of @xmath1 will appear stationary from the point - of - view of a molecule in @xmath0 .",
    "elementary kinetic theory then says that @xmath366 , and so    @xmath367    where @xmath368 is a constant independent of @xmath363 and @xmath364 .",
    "this lower bound is very large , and so displacing @xmath0 far from equilibrium will generate oscillations with a small oscillation frequency .",
    "the experimental prediction of this work is that if @xmath0 contains very few molecules ( so that destructive interference between the individual oscillations is minimised ) , then the individual oscillations between @xmath2 and @xmath3 may be in phase long enough to have a noticible affect on the data . in particular",
    ", we would expect that thermal equilibration would take a longer length of time with a smaller ensemble size for @xmath0 .",
    "this is analogous to how ensembles of a very small number of spins stay in phase with each other over a relatively long time period during transverse relaxation and phase decoherence measurements [ 27 , 28 ] .",
    "the effect of ensemble size on the rate of thermal equilibration might be an interesting topic for a future study .",
    "through a series of mathematical arguments we have shown that thermal equilibration of a high temperature component of a two - component gas can be interpreted in a similar way to transverse relaxation in magnetic resonance spectroscopy .",
    "we did this by dividing the kinetic energy state space of the molecules of the high temperature component into a ` high energy ' and a ` low energy ' component , and by then showing that the molecules shift ( ` oscillate ' ) between the two components forever over time .",
    "because each molecule in the gas enters and exits these states at a different time , the ` oscillations ' occur out of phase and interfere destructively with one another , and so are not seen when monitoring the equilibration process _ via _ the average kinetic energy of the gas in the laboratory .",
    "we also suggested that the oscillations may stay in - phase long enough to have an observable effect on the thermal equilibration process if the high temperature component contained very few molecules .",
    "we also characterised the oscillation by studying its frequency , and showed that the frequency strictly increases with time .",
    "this is where transverse relaxation and thermal equilibration differ , because in the former case the average oscillation frequencies are usually constant in time [ 16 ] .",
    "the stochastic model that we used is not standard in the statistical physics literature , however we demonstrated that it is consistent with both the two key models of thermal equilibration ( boltzmann equation and brownian motion ) and so there is no reason to doubt that the model is physically meaningful .",
    "the transverse relaxation - like ` oscillatory ' interpretation of the thermal equilibration presented here offers a new and intuitive way of looking at the thermal equilibration process .",
    "it may be a useful starting point for creating models of the thermal equilibration process , and also suggests that there might be other connections between thermal equilibration and other seemingly disparate non - equilibrium phenomena in statistical physics .",
