    ", we will concentrate our discussions on the general principles to construct chiral dirac fermion operators on a finite lattice , in particular , for vector - like gauge theories such as qcd . with",
    "the constraints imposed by the nielson - ninomiya no - go theorem@xcite , one can construct a gauge covariant dirac operator @xmath1 on a finite lattice such that :    ( i ) : :    @xmath1 breaks the chiral symmetry ( i.e. ,    @xmath2 ) at finite lattice spacing but    recovers the chiral symmetry in the continuum limit    @xmath3 . (",
    "ii ) : :    @xmath1 is local .",
    "(    @xmath4 with    @xmath5 ; or @xmath6 for    @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is much less than    the size of the lattice . ) ( iii ) : :    in the free fermion limit , @xmath1 is free of species    doublings . ( the free fermion propagator @xmath9 has    only one simple pole at the origin @xmath10 in the    brillouin zone . ) ( iv ) : :    in the free fermion limit , @xmath1 has correct continuum    behavior .",
    "( in the limit @xmath3 ,    @xmath11 around    @xmath10 . )",
    "however , one can not push the property * ( i ) * any further , while maintaining properties * ( ii)-(iv)*. for example , if @xmath1 is chirally symmetric at finite lattice spacing , then it must violate at least one of the three properties * ( ii)-(iv)*. we note that these four properties * ( i)-(iv ) * form the necessary conditions to meet the requirements * ( a)-(c ) * , however , they are not sufficient to guarantee that * ( c ) * will be satisfied .",
    "an example satisfying * ( i)-(iv ) * is the standard wilson - dirac fermion operator@xcite [ eq : dw ] d_w = _ t_+ w where [ eq : tmu ] t_(x , y ) = [ u_(x ) _ x+,y - u_^(y ) _ x-,y ]  , [ eq : sigma ] _ _ ^ + _ _ ^ = 2 _  , [ eq : gamma ] _ & = & (    cc 0 & _ + _ ^ & 0    ) and @xmath12 is the wilson term [ eq : wilson ] w(x , y ) = _  . the color , flavor and spinor indices have been suppressed in ( [ eq : dw ] ) .",
    "the first term on the r.h.s . of ( [ eq : dw ] ) is the naive fermion operator which is chirally symmetric at any lattice spacing and satisfies properties * ( ii ) * and * ( iv ) * but violates * ( iii ) * since it has @xmath13 fermion doubled modes .",
    "the purpose of the wilson term @xmath12 is to give each doubled mode a mass of @xmath14 such that in the continuum limit ( @xmath3 ) , each doubled mode becomes infinitely heavy and decouples from the fermion propagator .",
    "however , the introduction of the wilson term has serious drawbacks .",
    "it causes @xmath15 artifacts and also leads to the notorious problems such as vector current renormalization , additive fermion mass renormalization , and mixings between operators in different chiral representations .    during the last two years",
    ", it has become clear that the proper way to break the chiral symmetry of @xmath1 at finite lattice spacing is to conform with the ginsparg - wilson relation @xcite [ eq : gwr ] d 5 + 5 d = 2 a d r _ 5 d where @xmath16 is a positive definite hermitian operator which is local in the position space and trivial in the dirac space .",
    "then the generalized chiral symmetry ( [ eq : gwr ] ) can ensure that the theory is free of above mentioned problems of the wilson - dirac operator @xcite .    the general solution to the ginsparg - wilson relation",
    "can be written as @xcite [ eq : gen_sol ] d = d_c ( + a r d_c ) ^-1 = ( + a d_c r ) ^-1 d_c where @xmath17 is any chirally symmetric ( @xmath18 ) dirac operator which must violate at least one of the three properties * ( ii)*-*(iv ) * above .",
    "now we must require @xmath17 to satisfy * ( iii ) * and * ( iv ) * , but violate * ( ii ) * ( i.e , @xmath17 is nonlocal ) , since ( [ eq : gen_sol ] ) can transform the nonlocal @xmath17 into a local @xmath1 on a finite lattice for @xmath19 with @xmath20 in the proper range @xcite , while the properties * ( iii ) * and * ( iv ) * are preserved .",
    "moreover , the zero modes and the index of @xmath17 are invariant under the transformation @xcite .",
    "that is , a zero mode of @xmath17 is also a zero mode of @xmath1 and vice versa , hence , [ eq : npm ] n_+ ( d_c ) = n_+ ( d ) , n_- ( d_c ) = n_- ( d ) , [ eq : index ] ( d_c ) = n_-(d_c ) - n_+(d_c ) = n_-(d ) - n_+(d ) = ( d )  .",
    "since the massless dirac fermion operator in continuum is antihermitan , we also require that @xmath17 is antihermitian ( @xmath21 ) even at finite lattice spacing .",
    "then the chiral symmetry of @xmath17 together with its antihermiticity implies that @xmath17 satisfies the @xmath22-hermiticity [ eq : hermit ] d_c^ = 5 d_c 5  .",
    "this implies that @xmath1 in the general solution ( [ eq : gen_sol ] ) also satisfies the @xmath23-hermiticity [ eq : hermit_d ] d^ = 5 d 5  .",
    "then the eigenvalues of @xmath1 are either real or come in complex conjugate pairs . furthermore , from ( [ eq : gen_sol ] ) , since @xmath16 is a positive definite hermitian operator , the lower bound of real eigenvalues of @xmath1 is zero , thus @xmath24 is real and nonnegative , and is amenable to hybrid monte carlo simulation for dynamical fermions with _ any _ number of fermion flavors .    in particular , for @xmath19 with @xmath25 , the analysis [ eqs .",
    "( 24)-(41 ) ] in ref .",
    "@xcite goes through with trivial modifications .",
    "the main results are :    ( @xmath26 ) : :    the eigenvalues of @xmath1 fall on a circle with center at    @xmath27 , and radius @xmath27 , and have the    reflection symmetry with respect to the real axis .",
    "( @xmath28 ) : :    the real eigenmodes ( if any ) at @xmath29 and    @xmath30 have definite chirality @xmath31 or    @xmath32 . ( @xmath33 ) : :    the chirality of any complex eigenmodes is zero . ( @xmath34 ) : :    total chirality of all eigenmodes must vanish .",
    "@xmath35    where @xmath36 denotes the number of zero modes of positive ( negative ) chirality , and @xmath37 the number of @xmath30 modes of positive ( negative ) chirality . from ( @xmath34 ) , we immediately see that _ any zero mode must be accompanied by a real @xmath30 mode with opposite chirality _ , and the index of @xmath1 is [ eq : index_d ] ( d ) n_- - n_+ = - ( n_- - n_+ )  .",
    "now the central problem is to construct the chirally symmetric @xmath17 which is nonlocal , and satisfies * ( iii ) * , * ( iv ) * , and ( [ eq : hermit ] ) .",
    "furthermore we also require that @xmath17 is topologically proper ( i.e. , satisfying the atiyah - singer index theorem ) for any prescribed smooth gauge background .",
    "these constitute the necessary requirements @xcite for @xmath17 to enter ( [ eq : gen_sol ] ) such that @xmath1 could provide a nonperturbative regularization for a massless dirac fermion interacting with a background gauge field .",
    "explicitly , these necessary requirements are :    ( a ) : :    @xmath17 is antihermitian ( hence    @xmath22-hermitian ) and it agrees with    @xmath38 in the    classical continuum limit .",
    "( b ) : :    @xmath17 is free of species doubling .",
    "( c ) : :    @xmath17 is nonlocal .",
    "( d ) : :    @xmath17 is well defined in topologically trivial    background gauge field .",
    "( e ) : :    @xmath17 has zero modes as well as simple poles in    topologically non - trivial background gauge fields ( each zero mode of    @xmath17 must be accompanied by a simple pole of    @xmath17 ) .",
    "furthermore , the zero modes of    @xmath17 satisfy the atiyah - singer index theorem for any    prescribed smooth gauge background .",
    "the general solution of @xmath17 satisfying these requirements had been investigated in ref .",
    "@xcite and was reported by the author at chiral99 . however , in general , given any lattice dirac operator @xmath1 , there exists a transformation @xmath39 for @xmath1 such that the transformed dirac operator @xmath40 $ ] is chirally symmetric @xcite .",
    "therefore , for the sake of completeness , the transformation @xmath39 is outlined in section 2 . then the construction in ref .",
    "@xcite is reviewed in section 3 .",
    "concluding remarks are briefly outlined in section 4 .",
    "given any lattice dirac operator @xmath1 , in general , there are many different ways to construct a chirally symmetric @xmath17 out of @xmath1 . for example , we can construct [ eq : ds ] d_s = ( d - _ 5 d _ 5 ) which is chirally symmetric ( @xmath41 ) .",
    "however , this transformation does not necessarily preserve the property * ( iii)*. for example , if we apply this transformation to the wilson - dirac operator ( [ eq : dw ] ) , we obtain @xmath42 , the naive fermion operator which suffers from the species doublings . although @xmath43 is free of species doublings in the continuum limit , the transformation ( [ eq : ds ] ) can not preserve this property since @xmath44 is local .",
    "therefore , we need a transformaton which preserves the properties * ( iii ) * , * ( iv ) * , ( [ eq : hermit_d ] ) and ( [ eq : npm ] ) , but exchanges the locality of @xmath1 for its chiral symmetry at finite lattice spacing .",
    "the transformation @xcite [ eq : tit ] ( r ) : d d= ( r)[d ] d ( + r d ) ^-1 = ( + d r ) ^-1 d which generalizes ( [ eq : gen_sol ] ) can serve our purposes .",
    "evidently , the set of these transformations , @xmath45 , form an abelian group with group parameter space @xmath46 @xcite .    for any @xmath1 satisfying @xmath22-hermiticity , ( [ eq : hermit_d ] ) , there exists a hermitian @xmath47 , [ eq : rc ] r_c = - ( d^-1 + _ 5 d^-1 _ 5 ) such that [ eq : d5d ] d_c = ( r_c ) [ d ] = 2 5 d ( 5 d - d 5 ) ^-1 d is chirally symmetric ( @xmath48 ) and antihermitian ( @xmath21 ) .",
    "it is evident that for any two lattice dirac operators @xmath49 and @xmath50 satisfying ( [ eq : hermit_d ] ) , their corresponding chiral limits obtained from ( [ eq : d5d ] ) , say , @xmath51 and @xmath52 , are in general different .",

    ". it is antihermitian , nonlocal ( due to the second term ) , and satisfies * ( i ) , ( iii ) * and * ( iv)*. then we can substitute ( [ eq : dtwc ] ) into ( [ eq : gen_sol ] ) with @xmath19 to obtain a gw dirac operator [ eq : dw_gw ] d = where [ eq : c ] c = ( ^_t _ ) - w ( _ t_)^-1 w  .    on a finite lattice , the gw dirac operator ( [ eq : dw_gw ] ) can be constructed to be local but not highly peaked in the diagonal elements if the value of @xmath20 is within a proper range @xcite . in other words ,",
    "if @xmath20 is too small , then @xmath1 must be nonlocal since @xmath1 is close to @xmath17 .",
    "on the other hand , if @xmath20 is too large , then @xmath1 becomes highly peaked in the diagonal elements .",
    "in these two extreme cases , @xmath1 does not respond properly to the background gauge field ( e.g. , the anomaly function of @xmath1 does not agree with the chern - pontryagin density of the prescribed gauge background ) . in the limit",
    "the number of sites in each dimension goes to infinity , the proper range of @xmath20 extends to @xmath55 .    the anomaly function of @xmath1 ( [ eq : dw_gw ] )",
    "can be written [ eq : anxc ] = 2  ( x , x ) where @xmath56 denotes the trace over the color , flavor and spinor space .",
    "it is instructive to compare the anomaly function of the wilson - dirac operator @xmath43 ( [ eq : dw ] ) to that of the gw wilson - dirac operator @xmath1 ( [ eq : dw_gw ] ) , in a topologically trivial background gauge field , on a finite lattice , as shown in fig . 1 in ref .",
    "@xcite and fig . 1 in ref",
    "@xcite , respectively .",
    "the anomaly function of @xmath43 is very different from the chern - pontryagin density @xmath57 on a @xmath58 torus , while that of the gw dirac - wilson operator @xmath1 is in good agreement with @xmath57 at each site .",
    "this demonstrates that the transformation @xmath59 plays the important role in converting @xmath43 into a gw dirac operator @xmath60 $ ] which is free of @xmath15 lattice artifacts , thus @xmath1 can reproduce the correct anomaly function even on a _ finite _ lattice provided that the local fluctuations of the background gauge field are not too violent .",
    "however , a lattice dirac operator satisfying properties * ( i)-(iv ) * , ( [ eq : hermit_d ] ) and the gw relation ( [ eq : gwr ] ) does not guarantee that it has the correct anomaly function in topologically nontrivial gauge backgrounds .",
    "this can be seen as follows .",
    "it is well known that the sum of the axial anomaly over all sites of a finite lattice is equal to the index of the lattice dirac operator .",
    "therefore _ the necessary condition for a lattice dirac operator to have the correct anomaly function is that it possesses exact zero modes satisfying the atiyah - singer index theorem _",
    "i.e. , @xmath61 . however , not every lattice dirac operator has exact zero modes in topologically nontrivial gauge backgrounds .",
    "for example , the wilson - dirac operator , @xmath43 in ( [ eq : dw ] ) , it does not have exact zero modes in topologically nontrivial sectors .",
