    "when an atomic transition is driven by quasi - resonant light , after a transient evolution , the quantum state describing the atomic system becomes correlated in time with the exciting light field .",
    "this correlation is in turn responsible for the coherent interaction between the atomic system and the light .",
    "of special interest is the case when the atomic system interacts with two optical fields . in this case ,",
    "in addition to the induced atomic coherence at the frequencies of the two fields , the non - linearity of the medium is responsible for atomic coherence at frequencies that result from the linear combinations of the frequencies of the two incident optical fields .",
    "these additional frequency components in the atomic dynamics manifest themselves in the spectral dependence of different observables such as absorption or new field generation .",
    "the response of a pure two - level system , driven by a monochromatic pump wave and tested by a weak probe with variable frequency offset with respect to the pump , is well known @xcite . in the case of a relatively weak pump field ( rabi frequency no larger than the transition natural width )",
    "the coherent interaction of the two - level system with the two fields is responsible for narrow features in probe absorption ( occurring when the two - level transition is open ) whose width is determined by the ground - state relaxation rate @xcite . although theoretical predictions based in the simple two - level model have proven to be powerful for the interpretation of a large number of experimental results , pure two - level systems are seldom found in real experiments . in most cases ,",
    "the atomic levels are degenerate and the vectorial nature of the electromagnetic field plays an essential role .",
    "well before the advent of the laser , it was realized that resonant light can modify the state of a degenerate atomic level through optical pumping among zeeman sublevels@xcite .",
    "experiments using optical and/or radiofrequency excitation demonstrated the occurrence of orientation , alignment and zeeman coherence .",
    "the invention of the laser opened the way to the study of the coherent response of degenerate system in the optical domain .",
    "essential theoretical contributions in this subject are due to berman and co - workers@xcite . in their work ,",
    "the crucial role of optical pumping in degenerate two - level system is underlined and it is demonstrated that sub - natural - width spectroscopic resonances are associated to the non conservation of population , orientation or alignment .",
    "the connection between these narrow spectroscopic features and sub - doppler cooling was established in @xcite and the pump - probe spectroscopy of degenerate two - levels systems including the effect of the atomic recoil was considered in @xcite .",
    "bo gao@xcite has developed a method allowing the calculation of the weak probe absorption by a closed degenerate two - level system driven by a linearly polarized pump wave and no magnetic field .",
    "the resonance fluorescence spectrum of a driven degenerate two - level systems was qualitatively discussed with the help of the dressed atom model@xcite and explicitly derived@xcite .",
    "also , let us mention that several authors have been concerned with the steady - state preparation of a degenerate two level system due to the excitation by a unique field of arbitrary elliptic polarization@xcite .    in this paper",
    "we are concerned with the spectroscopic features of the coherent response of driven degenerate two level systems .",
    "our attention is placed on the sub - natural - width resonances associated to the coherent nature of the interaction of an atomic system with a drive and a probe field . as discussed below ,",
    "such resonances are present in a large variety of physical observables such as probe absorption , dispersion , fluorescence , four - wave - mixing ( fwm ) etc .",
    "the aim of this paper is to discuss the essential spectroscopic features of the coherence resonances present on these observables and discuss the dependence of these features in parameters such as external magnetic field , optical fields polarizations , light intensity and atomic level characteristics .",
    "additional motivation for the study of degenerate two - level systems arise from the connection of this problem with that of the study of multilevel configurations where interesting coherent effects have attracted considerable attention in recent years . among them",
    "is the phenomenon of coherent population trapping ( cpt)@xcite and the related effect of electromagnetic induced transparency ( eit)@xcite observed in three - level systems ( mainly @xmath2 systems ) . these effects have found interesting application for subrecoil laser cooling@xcite , magnetometry@xcite , refractive index enhancement@xcite , enhancement of non - linear susceptibility@xcite , steep dispersion@xcite and ultra - low group velocity propagation@xcite .",
    "degenerate two - level systems provide us with the possibility to analyze some of the level schemes studied so far within a unique theoretical frame .",
    "under the appropriate choice of the pump and probe polarizations and the angular momenta of the involved levels , the degenerate two level system in the presence of two - fields reduces , as a particular case , into several of the multi - level configurations previously studied ( @xmath3 configurations , etc . ) .",
    "one can thus expect that degenerate two level systems will be suitable for the observation of coherent effects including those previously predicted and observed in three level configurations . in addition , new effects such as electromagnetically induced absorption ( eia)@xcite appear in the degenerate two level system that are not present in three - level configurations .    the first part of the paper is devoted to the presentation of a theoretical model allowing the calculation of the complete response to first order in the probe field of an atomic system composed of two degenerate levels of given total angular momentum driven by a pump wave .",
    "the model is based in a semiclassical treatment of the atom+fields dynamics based in optical bloch equations@xcite .",
    "it is intended to be suitable for the numerical calculation of the response of the atomic medium in a wide variety of cases : arbitrary values of the total angular momentum of the ground and excited levels can be considered .",
    "arbitrary and independent elliptical polarizations are allowed for the pump and probe waves .",
    "the presence of an external magnetic field is included .",
    "both open and closed two - level systems can be treated .",
    "the model results in the derivation of the equation [ eqprobe ] below satisfied by the operator @xmath4 defined in order to contain all density matrix terms corresponding to the response of the atomic system ( under the presence of the arbitrarily intense pump wave ) to first order in the probe wave .",
    "different spectroscopic observables such as probe absorption and dispersion , new field generation , population modulation , magnetic orientation , are subsequently derived from the operator @xmath4 as discussed below .",
    "the spectral features present on these observables are then discussed with special attention on the subnatural - width resonances due to the coherent interaction between the atomic system and the fields .",
    "the predictions are illustrated with experimentally observations of probe absorption and fluorescence modulation carried on the d@xmath0 lines of rb vapor .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "the second section is devoted to the presentation of the theoretical model and to the derivation of the expressions for different observables .",
    "the spectroscopic features of each of these observables as a function of the optical and magnetic field parameters are specifically discussed .",
    "the third section is devoted to experimental observations concerning probe absorption and population modulation spectra .",
    "finally , some conclusions are presented .",
    "the model was developed having in mind transitions within the d lines of alkaline atoms .",
    "however , it is not restricted to this case .",
    "it can be applied to any dipole allowed atomic transition from a long - living lower level to an upper level rapidly damped by spontaneous emission .",
    "we consider two degenerate levels : a ground level @xmath5 of total angular momentum @xmath6 and energy @xmath7 and an excited state @xmath8 of angular momentum @xmath9 and energy @xmath10 . the total radiative relaxation coefficient of level @xmath8 is @xmath11 .",

    "the fwm spectra splits into several peaks .",
    "[ fwmspeclin ] shows some examples of calculated spectra obtained for different pump and probe polarizations .",
    "the selection rules governing resonant fwm result from two simultaneous requirements on the pump and probe polarizations : @xmath123 a three - photon transition from the ground to the excited level involving the absorption of two pump photons and the emission of one probe photon should be permitted .",
    "@xmath124 an electric dipole transition should be allowed between the initial ( ground ) and the final ( excited ) sublevels connected by the three - photon processes .",
    "these rules are different from the rules corresponding to probe absorption .",
    "for instance , no coherence resonance in fwm occurs if the pump and probe polarizations are circular and opposite",
    ". however , absorption resonances are generally observable in this case .    to our knowledge ,",
    "the results presented here constitutes the first detailed calculation of coherence resonances spectra in fwm involving zeeman sublevels in degenerate two - level system .",
    "the modulation of the excited state population results in modulation of the emitted fluorescence according to eq.[acfluor ] .",
    "this modulation has a similar origin than that discussed in the context of cpt in a driven @xmath125 system @xcite . as mentioned in @xcite the modulation in the fluorescence",
    "is intimately connected to fwm . in the context of the present paper ,",
    "this connection is the natural consequence of the coupling between @xmath66 , @xmath67 , @xmath68 and @xmath69 described by eq.[eqprobe ] .",
    "population modulation is due to the coupling of the optical coherence induced by one of the fields between two zeeman sublevels in the ground and the excited state with the second field . in consequence , it occurs when the two fields couple the same pair of excited and ground zeeman sublevels . if the polarizations of the two fields are the same and correspond to a proper polarization with respect to the magnetic field orientation ( @xmath119 , @xmath126 or @xmath127 ) , the modulated fluorescence present no resonance narrower than @xmath11 as a function of the pump to probe frequency offset .",
    "however , interesting interference effects , resulting in coherence resonances ( linewidth determined by @xmath42 ) , occur for other pump and probe polarizations . fig .",
    "[ pulsation](a , b ) shows the calculated modulated component of the total fluorescence for two different transitions as a function of the magnetic field for fixed pump - probe frequency offset and the same transverse linear polarization .",
    "three coherence resonances are present in this case .",
    "the central one corresponds to zero magnetic field .",
    "the positions of the two lateral peaks correspond to the conditions for resonant raman transitions between zeeman sublevels .",
    "the signs of the resonances are opposite in the case of transitions corresponding to eia ( fig.[pulsation]a ) or eit ( fig.[pulsation]b ) .",
    "notice the larger relative variation of the pulsation amplitude in the case of eit .",
    "the simultaneous interaction of an atomic system with two fields can result in the driving of zeeman coherence in the ground state .",
    "this coherence can in turn be responsible for electromagnetic emission @xcite . to illustrate this phenomenon , in the case of degenerate two - level system",
    ", we analyze the predictions of our model concerning the induced ground - state magnetic dipole oscillating at frequency @xmath89 ( eq.[mag_dip ] ) .",
    "the selection rules governing the oscillating magnetic dipole spectra differ from those of the previously analyzed processes .",
    "some examples of the predicted oscillating magnetic dipole as a function of the magnetic field for fixed pump to probe frequency offset are shown in fig.[orient ] .",
    "coherence resonances in the oscillating dipole modulus take place when the two fields couple adjacent ground state zeeman sublevels .",
    "this is the case of fig.[orient]@xmath128 corresponding to @xmath127 polarized pump and a transverse and linearly polarized probe .",
    "the coherence resonance illustrated in fig.[orient]@xmath14 corresponding to transverse , orthogonal linearly polarized pump and probe is somehow different since its position ( @xmath95 ) does not correspond to a two photon process between different zeeman sublevels .",
    "the resonance can be understood , in this case , as the result of interference between two non resonant two - photon processes . in every case",
    "the resonance width are determined by the relaxation rate @xmath42 .",
    "the experiments were performed on the d@xmath0 line of @xmath129rb .",
    "the experimental setup is similar to the one previously presented@xcite .",
    "we remind here the principal features .",
    "the pump and probe fields were generated from the output of a unique extended cavity diode laser .",
    "this laser was locked , with the help of an external servo loop , to a saturated absorption line obtained from a reference rb vapor cell .",
    "the frequency uncertainty of the locked laser is less than 1 mhz over several minutes .",
    "most of the power of the laser beam was used as the pump field .",
    "the probe field was generated by frequency shifting a fraction of the laser beam with two consecutive acousto - optic modulators , one of them driven by a variable rf source . in this way",
    "two mutually coherent pump and probe waves were generated with tunable frequency offset @xmath89 .",
    "the polarization of the two fields were independently controlled .",
    "perfect overlap between the two fields was achieved by propagating them along a 50 cm single mode optical fiber that did not significantly modify the polarizations .",
    "the light was sent through a 2 cm long vapor cell .",
    "the power of the pump and probe at the atomic sample were @xmath130 and @xmath131 respectively .",
    "the atomic cell was placed within helmholtz coils for magnetic field control . for the probe absorption measurements ,",
    "the pump beam was blocked by a polarizer , ( extinction ratio larger than 200 ) while the probe intensity was detected with a photodiode . to enhance sensitivity and signal to noise ratio , a two - frequency lock - in detection technique",
    "was used @xcite . for this , the pump and probe fields were chopped at the frequencies @xmath132 and @xmath133 ( around 1 khz ) respectively and the photodiode output current was analyzed at frequency @xmath134 by a lock - in amplifier . by this means only the non - linear component of the probe transmission , dependent on the pump and probe intensities , was detected .    for the measurement of the excited state population modulation ,",
    "the atomic fluorescence was collected with a large area photodiode ( 1 cm diameter ) situated close to the vapor cell .",
    "the photodiode current was sent to an rf frequency analyzer operating in the zero span mode , that is measuring the rf input amplitude at a fixed frequency set equal to the probe to pump frequency offset @xmath89 .",
    "a fixed value of @xmath135 was used while the longitudinal magnetic field at the cell was scanned over a few hundred milligauss around the zero magnetic field . during these measurements",
    "the cell was surrounded by a @xmath136metal shield reducing the ambient magnetic field to less than @xmath137 .",
    "the scanning of the longitudinal magnetic field was accomplished with coils placed inside the magnetic shield .",
    "[ calcwb](d - f ) shows several examples of probe absorption spectra obtained for different orientations of the magnetic field and the optical fields polarizations . in each figure division , two spectra obtained from the excitation of the lower and the upper ground - state hyperfine levels of @xmath138rb under the same optical fields intensities and polarizations are presented . when the lower ground - state hyperfine level is addressed eit resonances",
    "are observed while in the case of the upper ground - state hyperfine level eia occurs .",
    "the agreement between the predictions of the model and the observations is quite satisfactory .",
    "this agreement may seem rather surprising since in the vapor cell , due to the velocity distribution , three different atomic transitions , one closed and two open contribute to the signal in each case .",
    "on all open transitions as well as on the closed @xmath139 transition eit occurs . only on the @xmath140",
    "transition eia takes place @xcite .",
    "however , due to optical pumping the absorption signal is essentially determined by the closed transitions resulting in the qualitative agreement with the theoretical prediction .",
    "some differences are nevertheless observed : the relative strength of the eia and eit transitions are not the same than in the calculation and the small eia resonance predicted in fig.[calcwb]c is not visible in the experiment ( fig.[calcwb]f ) . we have verified that a closer agreement between the experimental observation and theory can be achieved by taking into account the excited state hyperfine structure and the atomic velocity distribution according to the procedure described in @xcite .",
    "the measured signal corresponding to the fluorescence modulated at frequency @xmath141 is presented in fig.[pulsation](c , d ) .",
    "the traces are composed of a constant background over which narrow resonances are visible .",
    "the modulated fluorescence is of the order of 10@xmath142 times the total fluorescence .",
    "the contrast of the coherence resonances with respect to the constant background is larger in the case of the lower ground state hyperfine level ( @xmath143 ) compared to that of the upper ground state hyperfine level ( @xmath144 ) .",
    "the width of the peaks are determined by magnetic field inhomogeneities .",
    "the main features in the observed curves are in good qualitative agreement with the predictions based on the theoretical model valid for atoms at rest .",
    "this indicates that , as in the case of absorption , the spectra are dominated by the corresponding cycling transition and that the influence of the doppler effect on the coherence resonances positions is not essential .",
    "more elaborate calculations including velocity integration and summation over excited state hyperfine levels provide closer agreement with the observations @xcite .",

    "were analyzed and the corresponding spectra calculated .",
    "most of these observables present narrow coherence resonances whose width is essentially determined by the ground - state relaxation .",
