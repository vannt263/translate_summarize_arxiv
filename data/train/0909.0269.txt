    "supermassive black holes ( smbh ) are believed to reside in nearly all galaxies @xcite and the masses of these smbh ( @xmath5 ) show correlations with host galaxy properties , implying that smbh and galaxy formation processes are closely linked @xcite .",
    "previous studies have shown correlations between @xmath5 and galaxy s effective stellar velocity dispersion ( @xmath9 ) , bulge luminosity ( @xmath10 ) , s@xmath1rsic index ( _ n _ ) and stellar mass of the bulge component ( @xmath11 ) @xcite . some of the challenges faced by current models of smbh formation and evolution include reproducing and maintaining these scaling relations regardless of the events that take place during galaxy evolution driven by the process of hierarchical mass assembly @xcite .",
    "these scaling relations are not only important tests of the models of smbh formation and evolution but also powerful predictive tools from which we can infer smbh masses of galaxies that are located at higher redshifts .    in this paper",
    ", we examine the evidence for a scaling relation between @xmath5 and the _ total _ mass of the host galaxy ( denoted as @xmath0 ) .",
    "most self regulating theoretical models of smbh formation predict a fundamental connection between @xmath5 and @xmath0 of the host galaxy @xcite .",
    "one of the most important predictions of the galaxy models , which study the interaction between the dark matter haloes of galaxies and baryonic matter settling into the gravitational potential to form the bulge and smbh , is that halo properties determine those of the bulge component and smbh @xcite .",
    "however , observational evidence for such a scaling relation has been sparse since measurement of the total mass is non - trivial .",
    "results from @xcite examined some of the first _ indirect _ observational evidence for the existence of a @xmath8 relation . in @xcite , the correlation between bulge velocity dispersion ( @xmath12 ) and the observed circular velocity ( @xmath13 ) , for a sample of 20 elliptical galaxies and 16 spiral galaxies ,",
    "is translated into an equivalent @xmath8 correlation .",
    "although @xmath12 can be translated into @xmath5 through @xmath14 relation in a straightforwards manner , an estimate of @xmath0 is dependent on the conversion between @xmath13 and virial velocity , the velocity of the galactic halo at the virial radius .",
    "@xcite uses results from @xmath15cdm cosmological simulations to derive @xmath0 .",
    "following @xcite , several studies have examined the @xmath16 relation and its implications for galaxy formation and evolution @xcite .",
    "the primary goal of this study is to extend the observational evidence to support the @xmath17 relation using an attractive , alternative , and _ direct _ method to measure the total mass of the host galaxy . in recent years ,",
    "strong gravitational lensing has emerged as a powerful tool to probe the mass profiles , ranging from individual galaxies to clusters of galaxies @xcite . due to the fact deflection of a photon passing an intervening massive object",
    "is independent of the deflector s dynamical state , gravitational lensing does not suffer from difficulties associated with dynamical mass measurements of galaxies , where assumptions regarding orbital motions of tracers can lead to complications .",
    "thus , gravitational lensing is a more robust method to estimate the total mass , including dark matter , around early - type galaxies and infer the existence of an isothermal mass profile ( @xmath18 ) in various systems @xcite    the mass enclosed within the einstein radius ( @xmath19 ) which is measured from the lens model that produces the best fit to the observed multiple images , is a direct probe of both luminous and dark mass in a galaxy . in conjunction with velocity dispersion and surface brightness profiles of the lens galaxy , measurement of @xmath19 from a lens model",
    "can be used effectively to constrain the luminous and dark matter profiles . in this study",
    ", we utilize the @xmath19 as a tracer of the total mass and use the @xmath20 mass profile of the lensing galaxy to determine the mass contained within a redshift - independent circular aperture .",
    "we also attempt to derive the @xmath8 relation using purely photometric tracers of @xmath5 and @xmath0 .",
    "therefore , we examine the possibility of using @xmath2 relation @xcite as the primary method to estimate black hole masses .",

    "previous studies in the literature indicate that the quantity _",
    "n _ varies monotonically with galaxy magnitude .",
    "therefore , the existence of a @xmath25 relation can be inferred given the dependence of @xmath5 on the galaxy magnitude @xcite and the connection between galaxy magnitude and s@xmath1rsic index @xcite .",
    "@xcite discuss the most recent version of the @xmath25 relation and indicate that the dependence between the quantities @xmath26 and @xmath27 can be best represented by a log - quadratic relation .",
    "the main motivation for using this relation is that measurement of _ n _ requires only imaging data , which is easier to acquire than spectroscopic data at a given redshift ; therefore , @xmath8 could be easily extended to large samples of higher redshift gravitational lenses , which may not have spectroscopic measurements .",
    "furthermore , _",
    "n _ is a distant - independent quantity , an added advantage for estimating black hole masses of high redshift galaxies that may not have secure redshift measurements .",
    "this paper is structured as follows . in ",
    "2 we present a brief description of the target selection . in ",
    "3 we describe the following analysis procedures :  3.1 measurements of @xmath0 ;  3.2 : deriving the connection between @xmath5 and @xmath0 using @xmath3 relation ;  3.3 : deriving the connection between @xmath5 and @xmath0 using @xmath2 relation . in ",
    "4 we present the results of our analysis . in  5 and  6",
    "we discuss the implications of our results and give some concluding remarks regarding this project .",
    "we assume the following cosmological terms for all computations in the paper : @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 . unless otherwise noted all scaling relations in this paper are defined as linear relationships in log - log space and all logarithms assume a base of 10 .",
    "our sample is a subset of the galaxy - scale strong gravitational lenses from the sloan lens acs ( slacs ) survey @xcite , a hubble space telescope ( hst ) imaging survey that is optimized to detect bright early - type lens galaxies with faint lensed sources .",
    "these lenses were initially selected from spectra of galaxies of the sdss luminous red galaxy ( lrg ) and main galaxy samples @xcite .",
    "after a best - fit template of the continuum was subtracted from the spectrum of each galaxy , the residual spectra were scanned for nebular emission lines at a redshift higher than that of the target galaxy .",
    "galaxies whose residual spectra exhibited at least three atomic transitions at a common background redshift were identified as lens candidates @xcite and imaged using the wide - field channel ( wfc ) of the advanced camera for surveys ( acs ) through f435w and f814w filters ( programs 10174 , 10587 & 10886 ) .",
    "a detailed description of the gravitational lenses discovered by the slacs survey and subsequent analysis can be found in the series , the sloan lens acs survey 1 - 8 @xcite . to date",
    ", slacs survey has discovered 131 galaxy - scale strong gravitational lenses with snapshot or deep hst acs imaging , secure spectroscopic redshifts for both lens and source galaxies in each system and stellar velocity dispersion , @xmath32 , measured within the 3 \" sdss spectroscopic fiber @xcite .    from the 131 slacs lenses ,",
    "70 systems are classified as `` grade - a '' systems by @xcite , where the grade - a classification implies a definite lens as determined by hst imaging .",
    "we use 43 `` grade - a '' lenses , from programs 10174 , 10587 and 10886 , as the sample for our analysis .",
    "we do not use lens systems that do not have a simple lens model due to nearby companion galaxies ( 7 lens systems ) or systems where @xmath33 value is not available ( 14 lens systems ) because the median signal - to - noise ( snr ) was too low within the 3 \" sdss spectroscopic fiber @xcite .",
    "the most important advantage of using the slacs galaxy sample to determine the @xmath8 relation is that we have an accurate measurement of the total mass profile of each galaxy .",
    "however , slacs lenses are located at distances ( @xmath34 ) where the smbh mass can not be measured directly through its influence on the surrounding gas or stars . therefore , we use two scaling relations to determine the smbh masses of the galaxy sample : @xmath3 relation @xcite and @xmath2 relation @xcite .",
    "we use parameters from the strong lens modeling performed by @xcite to obtain @xmath0 .",
    "@xcite use a singular isothermal ellipsoid ( sie ) lens model to describe foreground lens plane which generates the multiple images of the source .",
    "the sie lens model is parameterized by the angular einstein radius , @xmath35 , which relates to the physical parameters of the mass model as follows : @xmath36 where @xmath37 and @xmath38 are angular diameter distances between the lens and source plane and observer and source plane respectively .",
    "the surface brightness profile of the background galaxy is described by a single or multiple s@xmath1rsic ellipsoid profile and the model lensed image , for a given sie lens model , is produced by the forward ray tracing method .",
    "the model parameters are adjusted until the images match the observations and the solutions are optimized using a merit function , such as @xmath39 @xcite .",
    "we use the lens model parameters given by @xcite , i.e. @xmath35 , and integrate the best - fit mass profile to obtain the total mass ( both luminous and dark ) within a projected radii of choice . during the preliminary analysis , we use the inverted lensing equation to compute mass inside the einstein radius ( @xmath19 ) , as a tracer of @xmath0 , assuming that the lens and source galaxies are aligned along the optical axis .",
    "however , @xmath19 is not a measurement of mass within a @xmath40 aperture since the projected radius characterized by the einstein radius for a given mass distribution is redshift dependent .",
    "we therefore use @xmath4 , the radius within which the mean density of the lensing galaxy exceeds the critical density of the universe ( @xmath41 ) by a factor of 200 , as a `` standard aperture '' .",
    "the use of @xmath4 as a radial aperture is also consistent with theoretical studies of the @xmath8 relation @xcite .",
    "we integrate the best - fit mass profile to obtain the mass contained within a projected radius of @xmath4 ( @xmath42 ) as a tracer of the total mass as characterized below : @xmath43    adopting an  aperture - corrected \" mass measurement ( @xmath42 ) , instead of @xmath19 , does not affect the overall form of the @xmath8 relation ( the slope and zero - point ) discussed in the following sections .",
    "results of @xcite show a lack of correlation between the quantities @xmath44 and mass or @xmath45 , where @xmath46 is the stellar velocity dispersion corrected to an aperture of @xmath47 .",
    "these results are consistent with the near isothermal nature of the radial profile ; thus , using a radial aperture other than @xmath48 , to derive the total mass , does not introduce an additional dependence on the assumed mass model .",
    "we also observe a relationship of @xmath49 , consistent with the fact that an aperture corrected mass measurement does not affect the observed @xmath8 relation .    to obtain the associated 1-@xmath50 error of @xmath42",
    ", we use gaussian error propagation adopting an empirical error of 2% on the measured einstein radii following @xcite ( @xmath51 ) .",
    "table 1 lists the unique sdss identifiers for slacs lenses , redshift of the lens galaxy of a system and the derived values of @xmath42 ( hereafter denoted as @xmath0 ) for each lensing system .",
    "we first use the @xmath3 relation to estimate @xmath5 of the early type lens sample .",
    "the velocity dispersion measurements are derived from spectra from the sdss 3 \" diameter fiber .",
    "the sdss velocity dispersion measurements are corrected to a standard aperture , of radius equal to @xmath52 , using the power - law relation by @xcite , similar to smbh and fundamental plane studies @xcite . the mean difference between sdss velocity dispersion measurements and the aperture corrected measurements ( hereafter denoted as @xmath9 ) are @xmath53 ; therefore , the aperture correction does not significantly influence the overall form of the @xmath8 relation discussed in the following sections .",
    "we use @xmath3 relation by @xcite , obtained from measurements of @xmath5 from dynamically detected central black holes : @xmath54 with an intrinsic scatter of @xmath55 dex .",
    "we assume that errors on @xmath56 and best - fit coefficients of the @xmath57 relation are uncorrelated and use gaussian error propagation to determine the 1-@xmath50 error on the quantity @xmath58 .",
    "the values of @xmath56 and its associated error for each lensing system and smbh mass estimates obtained from @xmath3 relation are listed in table 1 .",
    "we also attempt to use the @xmath25 relation to estimate @xmath5 of the slacs lens sample @xcite .",
    "we perform a careful and detailed decomposition of hst acs images to obtain the s@xmath1rsic indices of the slacs lens galaxies .",
    "although our sample of lens galaxies were observed in at least two acs filters , mainly f814w and f435w , we exclusively use f814w ( broad i - band ) data due to high snr of the images .",
    "furthermore , redder magnitudes are a better tracer of mass in comparison to b - band magnitudes .",
    "to keep our decomposition method consistent with that of @xcite , we use a two - component model to describe the surface brightness profiles of slacs lens galaxies .",
    "in addition to the s@xmath1rsic profile , which describes the surface brightness of the bulge component in each galaxy , we include a second disk component characterized by a simple exponential profile : @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the surface brightness at radius @xmath23 .    to obtain the best possible accuracy of the data analysis process , we take particular care during all intermediate steps leading to the bulge - disk composition .",
    "therefore , we obtain the raw images and perform careful cosmic ray removal , distortion correction , manual mask production and determination of the best possible acs point - spread function ( psf ) .",
    "we obtain the acs images from the hst archive at the canadian astronomy data centre ( cadc ) , where the images are processed by calacs calibration software . imaging data from programs 10174 and 10587",
    "are 420 s single - exposure snapshot data ; therefore , we perform an additional cosmic ray identification step using the l.a.cosmic software ( lacos ) @xcite , which distinguishes between undersampled sources and cosmic rays .",
    "we then use the multidrizzle reduction package to obtain distortion - free acs images , where the distortion solution is applied to correct all pixels to equal areas .",
    "we use the photometry package sextractor @xcite to produce a catalog of galaxies in each acs image .",
    "furthermore , we use the segmentation images generated by sextractor , which deblends each source in the field , to produce manual masks of the lensed features around the early type galaxy before lens modeling .",
    "we perform the two - dimensional decomposition of each early - type lens galaxy using galaxy image 2d ( gim2d ) , which is publicly available to users @xcite .",
    "gim2d uses the metropolis algorithm to derive the best - fit parameter values and confidence intervals , for a surface brightness model of choice , through monte - carlo sampling of the likelihood function . since our surface brightness model consist of a bulge and a disk component",
    ", we explore the full range of bulge fraction ( b / t = 0.0 - 1.0 ) such that the metropolis algorithm converges to an accurate quantitative morphology of galaxies classified as e - types . on average",
    ", we find that most slacs lenses have a significant bulge component ( @xmath61 ) and a bulge plus disk light profile produces a better fit to the lens galaxy , significantly minimizing the residuals when the galaxy model is subtracted from the input galaxy image .    for gim2d lens models ,",
    "we take particular care to define the acs point spread function ( psf ) , which is extremely position- and time- dependent .",
    "we investigate a variety of psf models to determine the most suitable psf for convolution with gim2d galaxy models .",
    "the psf models are as follows .    1 .   a star extracted from the field .",
    "a psf produced at the location of the galaxy , in the non - drizzled image , using tiny tim software @xcite .",
    "we insert the tiny tim generated psf into an empty acs - wfc field , at the location of the galaxy , and multidrizzle the resulting image to obtain a distortion - free psf model .",
    "3 .   a psf produced at the location of the galaxy using the principle component analysis ( pca ) models in the acs psf library @xcite .",
    "we examined the residual images produced by subtracting the lens surface brightness model , each convolved with the psf models described above , to determine the best - fit psf for gim2d lens modeling .",
    "the psf model produced from the acs library gives the best results , minimizing the core residuals for a fixed surface brightness model .",
    "therefore , we extract the s@xmath1rsic indices from the best - fit bulge plus disk decomposition , using the acs psf library model for convolution .",
    "an example of the difference between residual images produced by various psf models are shown in figure  [ fig : psfcompare ] .",
    "we also examine the reliability of the bulge - disk decomposition by comparing our results for the slacs lens sample relative to the scaling relations for spheroidal components of the sdss galaxies .",
    "since slacs lenses were initially derived from sdss luminous red galaxy ( lrg ) and main samples , structural parameters measured from acs imaging should be in agreement with those of sdss galaxies .",
    "figure  [ fig : kormendy ] shows the comparison of effective bulge radius ( @xmath62 ) , i - band magnitude of the bulge component ( @xmath63 ) and aperture - corrected bulge velocity dispersion ( @xmath64 ) of the slacs lenses to the sdss bulge parameters .",
    "we construct the scaling relations for sdss galaxies from the bulge - disk decomposition of 77523 galaxies and velocity dispersions from the sdss database .",
    "the structural parameters derived from acs imaging are in good agreement with those of sdss galaxies , which confirms the accuracy of our bulge - disk decomposition ( in addition to the minimal residuals seen in the galaxy images after subtracting the galaxy models ) .",
    "the outlier in figure [ fig : kormendy ] is sdss j0959 + 0410 , a disk galaxy with a small bulge fraction ( @xmath65 ) .",
    "previous studies , which examine the positions of bulges with disk - like features ( also referred to as @xmath66 ) in structural parameter space find that pseudobulges with low @xmath67 deviate from the scaling relations of classical bulges @xcite .",
    "using the best - fit parameter for _ n _ from gim2d models , we estimate the smbh masses using the log - quadratic @xmath68 relation by @xcite : @xmath69 ^ 2 \\label{eq : grahammn}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with an intrinsic scatter of @xmath70 dex .",
    "similar to @xcite , we assume a measurement error of 20% on the values of _",

    "initial fits to the observed relation between @xmath78 and @xmath74 , incorporating observational errors in both variables , gives a large reduced @xmath39 value ( @xmath79 ) indicative of intrinsic scatter in the relation .",
    "therefore , we perform the fits by incorporating observational errors in both variables and intrinsic scatter in the @xmath80-variable . the value of @xmath77 is determined by requiring that @xmath81 is unity .",

    "we assume that measurement errors of the velocity dispersions and best - fit coefficients of the @xmath3 relation are uncorrelated and use gaussian error propagation to determine the 1-@xmath50 error on the quantity @xmath84 .",
    "we also perform a direct fitting step to @xmath0 and the secondary observable quantity , @xmath5 , to confirm the validity of the derived @xmath8 relation .",
    "we find @xmath85 with @xmath86 and @xmath87 , which is in agreement with the result shown in equation  [ eq : observational ] .      in this section ,",
    "we discuss the @xmath89 relation of the slacs lenses , shown in figure  [ fig : nmtot ] , and figure  [ fig : frommn ] which shows @xmath90 converted to smbh masses using equation  [ eq : grahammn ] @xcite . similar to  4.1 , we use gaussian error propagation ( assuming a measurement error of 20% on @xmath90 ) with intrinsic scatter of the @xmath8 relation ( @xmath91 ) added in quadrature , to determine the 1-@xmath50 error of the quantity @xmath92 .",
    "results of @xcite indicate that @xmath93 relation is comparable to the @xmath3 relation ; therefore , we expect both scaling relations to yield @xmath8 relations with similar level of scatter .",
    "if the expected equivalence between @xmath94 and @xmath57 relations hold , we can then extend the @xmath8 relation to gravitational lens samples which span a higher dynamical range in the total mass at various redshifts .",

    "although we do not observe a direct correlation between galaxy bulge magnitude and the s@xmath1rsic index , our results are limited by the narrow range of magnitudes ( @xmath103 ) in the slacs lens sample .",

    "we compare our results to several black hole formation scenarios posed by various theoretical studies and examine the implications of our findings .",
    "equation  [ eq : observational ] , which quantifies the trend observed in figure  [ fig : frommsigma ] , shows that @xmath5 scales non - linearly with @xmath0 and that efficiency of black hole formation increases with total mass .",
    "theoretical models that reproduce the observed luminosity function of high - redshift quasars @xcite predict that @xmath5 scales as a power law of the circular velocity of the galactic halo ( denoted as @xmath105 and also referred to as virial velocity ) in which the black hole resides : @xmath106    the @xmath107 relation shown above can be converted into an equivalent @xmath8 relation by considering the dependence between @xmath105 and halo mass ( equivalent to @xmath0 in this study ) , @xmath108 .",
    "the resulting correlation between @xmath5 and @xmath109 is as follows : @xmath110 the circular velocity of a given halo mass is redshift - dependent ; therefore , an important aspect of this analytical prediction is the evolution of the @xmath111 relation with time @xcite .    the slope of the @xmath111 relation , @xmath112 , is a valuable indicator of various formation scenarios which result in observed black hole populations . in the process of hierarchical mass assembly ,",
    "formation of smbh is driven by mergers of galaxy haloes . a linear relation between @xmath5 and @xmath109 , where @xmath113 , results from a formation scenario where the black holes residing in the merging haloes coalesce without additional gas accretion .",
    "a slope of @xmath114 is characteristic of a merger where the growth of the resulting black hole is dominated by an accretion process where a significant gas fraction from the merger product is driven in to the central accreting region @xcite . within this formation scenario ,",
    "the fraction of baryons accreted on to the central regions that feed the black hole is significantly larger for more massive haloes , due to a deeper potential well ; therefore , massive haloes host larger smbh .    in figure",

    ". both types of evolutionary tracks indicate that @xmath5 increases with the total mass of the host galaxy at any given redshift and that a galaxy of given total mass hosts a more massive black hole at a higher redshift relative to a lower redshift .",
    "within the context of hierarchical mass assembly in @xmath116 cosmology , the decrease in the growth of @xmath5 relative to @xmath0 at lower redshifts can be caused by processes such as a decrease in merger rates and the gas fraction that is available to fuel the central smbh .",
    "another important physical process involved in the evolution of @xmath8 relation is the feed - back regulated growth of smbh @xcite .",
    "a black hole shines at a fraction , @xmath117 , of its eddington luminosity ( @xmath118 ) following a merger and returns a fraction of this energy into the surrounding galactic gas . a black hole shining at its",
    "limiting @xmath118 can unbind the surrounding galactic gas if the energy liberated from the black hole is sufficient to overcome the gravitational binding energy of the gas . as the mass of a black hole increases through",
    "merger driven processes discussed above , the energy output can approach the limit where it is sufficient to unbind the entire galactic gas .",
    "the unbound galactic gas that escapes into the halo is heated beyond the virial temperature and can not cool during the dynamical time of the quasar ; therefore , this mechanism can eventually terminate the accretion process that feeds the central black hole .    the growth of a smbh via a merger - driven , feed - back regulated mechanism implies a relation of @xmath119 ( the required rate of energy deposition to unbind a self - gravitating system is proportional to @xmath120 ) @xcite , leading to a slope of @xmath121 in the @xmath8 relation .",
    "evolutionary tracks shown in solid blue lines in figure  [ fig : combinedevolution ] @xcite are examples of the formation scenario described above",
    ". the evolutionary tracks with a shallower slope , similar to the dashed lines shown in figure  [ fig : combinedevolution ] @xcite , may be indicative of a modified feed - back regulated growth mechanism .",
    "if the galactic gas heated by the energy output of the black hole cools before the black hole reaches its critical eddington limit , additional energy ( up to a factor of @xmath122 ) would be required to unbind the cool gas component .",
    "this formation scenario leads to dependence of @xmath123 , resulting in a slope of @xmath124 in the @xmath8 relation .",
    "it is worth noting that @xcite assumes the @xmath3 relation by @xcite , @xmath125 , which yields a relation of @xmath126 .",
    "therefore , we recompute the results of @xcite using the @xmath3 relation used throughout this study @xcite , which gives a dependence of @xmath127 .    within the context of formation and evolution of smbh , it is extremely important to accurately determine the parameters that quantify the slope and the evolution of @xmath8 relation .",
    "these parameters provide significant insight into the dominant formation scenarios that lead to the observed black hole populations at various redshifts . due to the narrow range of redshifts in the slacs lens sample",
    ", the @xmath8 relation we derive can be considered as an evolutionary track for the mean redshift of the slacs sample ( @xmath128 ) , as shown in figure  [ fig : combinedevolution ] ( solid black line ) .",
    "the @xmath8 relation we derive from the slacs lens sample provides a unique opportunity to compare the theoretical tracks with observational evidence of the @xmath8 relation .",
    "this is shown in figure  [ fig : comparisonevolution ] , where we compare the observational @xmath8 relation to the theoretical predictions of the @xmath8 relation at @xmath129 .",
    "the dashed region indicates the upper and lower 1-@xmath130 bounds of the observational form of the @xmath8 relation found in this study .",
    "inspection of figure  [ fig : comparisonevolution ] shows that our results are in excellent agreement with analytical predictions of feed - back regulated growth .",
    "however , from our results , it is difficult to distinguish the importance of gas cooling in the black hole formation process .",
    "the @xmath8 relation found in this study is strongly suggestive that halo properties determine those of the galaxy and its black hole .",
    "this link is also observed in the fundamental plane ( fp ) , the two - dimensional projection of the three - dimensional space defined by the quantities of surface brightness ( @xmath131 ) , effective radius ( @xmath62 ) and central velocity dispersion ( @xmath132 ) , of early - type galaxies @xcite .",
    "results of @xcite show that a sample of 53 slacs lenses define a fp that is consistent with the general population of early - type galaxies from sdss : @xmath133 the ratio @xmath134 for the slacs lenses is @xmath135 @xcite , indicative of a universal isothermal mass profile ( also known as the  bulge - halo conspiracy \" ) .",
    "therefore , we can replace the quantities @xmath62 and @xmath132 in the fp with @xmath4 ( given the trend observed between the quantities @xmath136 and @xmath137 ) and @xmath138 . combining this with equations  [ eq : totalmass ] and  [ eq : msigma ] ,",
    "we derive : @xmath139 ignoring the dependence of equation  [ eq : slacsfp2 ] on @xmath131 , since it only varies weakly relative to the other variables , we can extract the connection between @xmath5 and @xmath0 from the fp of slacs lenses .",
    "the slope of 1.30 of the @xmath8 relation derived from the slacs fp @xcite is in agreement with our results within the 1-@xmath130 bounds .",
    "the manifestation of a @xmath8 relation within the fp of the slacs lenses further strengthens the existence of the observed @xmath8 relation .",
    "we require @xmath140 measurements of both @xmath5 and @xmath0 to fully compare the manifestation of @xmath8 relation within the fp and its implications for regularity of early - type galaxy formation scenarios .",
    "an additional advantage of the results from this study lies within the method used to derive @xmath0 .",
    "the traditional method of estimating total gravitational mass of a galaxy , used in black hole studies , is to convert the @xmath141 circular velocity ( from galaxy rotation curves ) into the velocity of the galactic halo ( also referred to as the @xmath142 velocity ) .",
    "the inferred total mass of a galaxy differs depending on the method used to relate observed circular velocity to the virial velocity .",
    "the effect on the @xmath8 relation from varying assumptions of the connection between observed circular velocity ( @xmath13 ) and virial velocity ( @xmath143 ) , discussed in @xcite , is also shown in figure  [ fig : frommsigma ] .",
    "the dashed line shows the best - fit @xmath8 relation obtained by @xcite using cosmological prescriptions of @xcite to relate @xmath13 and @xmath143 ( @xmath144 ) and the dot - dashed line shows the resulting relation where @xmath145 ( @xmath146 ) . from the relations obtained by @xcite ,",
    "it is evident that the slope of the @xmath8 is affected by the method assumed to relate @xmath13 and @xmath143 .",
    "gravitational lens modeling is independent of such dynamical assumptions and provides an elegant alternative method to determine the total mass .",
    "therefore , the @xmath8 relation characterized by this independent method is not only a complementary comparison to existing observational evidence but also provides valuable insight to determine the dominant physical processes of smbh growth .",
    "we use a sample of 43 early - type galaxies , which exhibit galaxy - scale strong gravitational lensing , to derive the scaling relation between black hole mass , @xmath5 , and the total mass , @xmath0 , of the host galaxy . in this study",
    ", we use gravitational lens modeling to directly measure the total mass and the mass profile of the galaxy rather than converting the observed circular velocity into a total mass , the traditional method that is used in black hole studies .",
    "we use two alternative scaling relations , @xmath3 and @xmath25 to estimate the black hole masses of the lens sample .",
    "we obtain a tight correlation between @xmath9 and @xmath0 in the log - log space . in conjunction with the @xmath3 relation ,",
    "we derive the observational form of the @xmath8 relation that is consistent with no intrinsic scatter .",
    "we do not find a significant correlation between @xmath90 and @xmath0 . from a variety of tests",
    ", we find that we can not confidently estimate black hole masses with the @xmath98 relation .",
    "the scaling relation we observe between @xmath5 and @xmath0 is non - linear and is in agreement with theoretical predictions of the growth of black holes and observational studies of the local @xmath8 relation .",
    "the observed @xmath8 relation is also consistent with the studies of the fundamental plane of slacs lenses @xcite , which is suggestive of a unified scenario where the properties of the host halo determine those of the resulting galaxy and black hole formed through hierarchical merging .",
    "the observed non - linear correlation between @xmath5 and @xmath0 indicates that massive halos are more efficient in forming black holes and the slope of the @xmath8 relation is suggestive of a merger - driven , feed - back regulated process for the growth of black holes .",
