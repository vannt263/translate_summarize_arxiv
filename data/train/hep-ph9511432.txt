    "a non  relativistic gluon bound  state model for computing the production and decay of glueballs ( g ) made of two gluons",
    "was proposed a few years ago by kada _",
    "@xcite , who used it in order to calculate the processes @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "that model was later generalized for more complex reactions by houra ",
    "@xcite , and applied by them to the production of a glueball plus a quark or gluon jet at high transverse momentum in hadron collisions .",
    "another application , recently computed by ichola and parisi @xcite , concerned glueball plus pion production in two  photon processes . in this paper",
    "we consider the production of the same final state as in ref .",
    "@xcite , but this time in hadron collisions .    indeed , while the existence of glueballs is considered a crucial test of quantum chromodynamics @xcite , and after a few glueball candidates have emerged in the early eighties from various experiments @xcite , further experimental evidence appears still necessary in order to firmly establish their nature and properties .",
    "besides other reactions that should involve a `` gluon  rich environment '' ( such as radiative @xmath6 decays , as well as diffractive hadron  hadron scattering assumed to involve double pomeron exchange ) , hard collisions occurring in high  energy reactions may provide another means of creating that kind of environment and thus producing glueballs .",
    "we are aware that the status of the three particles that were considered as glueball candidates in refs .",
    "@xcite , namely the @xmath7 , the @xmath8 , and the @xmath9 , has become more uncertain in the last few years @xcite .",
    "however , as has been discussed at large in ref .",
    "@xcite , recent experimental data regarding those particles are rather contradictory ; actually there has also been recently some positive evidence regarding the @xmath8 @xcite and the @xmath9 @xcite . anyway , for none of the three candidates it has been decisively proved that it should not be a glueball . therefore , in this paper , we still stick to the assumptions of refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "hereafter , in section ii , we recall the formalism used and present the details of our calculation .",
    "section iii contains a discussion of the numerical results obtained and a brief conclusion .",
    "two appendices provide respectively the expressions of all quantities ( four  momenta , polarization four  vectors , projectors of spinor pairs ) needed for our calculation and those of all independent helicity amplitudes obtained for the subprocess @xmath10 resp .",
    "let us first remark that , for @xmath12 production in hadronic reactions , the hard process is necessarily induced by quark ",
    "antiquark collisions . indeed ,",
    "the subprocess @xmath13 is excluded since , due to isospin conservation , the pion can not be coupled to any parton system composed exclusively of gluons . for the same reason , the subprocess @xmath14 can not involve any feynman diagram where the quark and antiquark annihilate into a gluon .",
    "therefore the calculation of the hard subprocess is the same for @xmath15 and @xmath16 production ; at lowest order in perturbative qcd it involves the diagrams shown in fig .",
    "[ graphs ] , where the gluons @xmath17 and the final quarks @xmath18 are , respectively , the components of the glueball and the pion to be produced .    applying the non  relativistic gluon bound ",

    "lepage model @xcite for pions , we write , in analogy with eq .",
    "( 1 ) of ref .",
    "@xcite :    @xmath19    where we have used the following definitions : @xmath20 and @xmath21 are , respectively , the total energy and the pion emission angle in the @xmath22 center  of  mass frame , while @xmath23 ( @xmath24 ) is the polar ( azimuthal ) emission angle of either gluon in the @xmath25 c.m . frame , _",
    "i.e. _ the glueball rest frame ( see fig .  [ frame ] ) .",
    "@xmath26 is the brodsky  lepage variable defining the fractional momentum of the quark @xmath27 within the pion .",
    "we call @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 respectively the total spin of the glueball , its orbital angular momentum , its intrinsic spin , and the component of its total spin along the @xmath26axis of fig .",

    "in addition , we call @xmath32 ( @xmath33 the helicities of @xmath34 ( @xmath35 ) , while @xmath36 ( @xmath37 ) are the helicities of @xmath38 ( @xmath39 ) in the glueball rest frame . the angular projection function @xmath40 is defined as    @xmath41    where @xmath42 . @xmath43 is the velocity of either gluon in the glueball rest frame , while @xmath44 is given by    @xmath45_{r=0 } \\label{fl}\\ ] ]    where @xmath46 is the glueball mass and @xmath47 its radial wave function in configuration space .",
    "finally we notice that the system @xmath48 is here assumed to be in a pseudoscalar ( ps ) state .",
    "in the following stage we apply the brodsky  lepage convolution formula @xcite :    @xmath49    where @xmath50 is the pion distribution amplitude .    as in refs .",
    "@xcite we assume the glueball to be extreme ",
    "relativistic in the @xmath51 c.m .",
    "i.e. _ @xmath52 . in that approximation",
    "the gluons are also treated as massless in the hard subprocess . _",
    "a fortiori _ the mass of the pion , as well as of its constituent quarks , is also neglected . in other words : both outgoing particles , and all partons involved , are on the light cone .",
    "it is to be noticed that , with massless quarks , helicity conservation @xcite imposes : @xmath53 . on the other hand , due to parity and angular  momentum conservation ,",
    "one has the relation @xmath54 , which reduces the number of independent amplitudes by an additional factor of two .",
    "it thus becomes sufficient to limit oneself to computing those amplitudes where @xmath55 , @xmath56 .    in appendix",
    "a we show the expressions of four  momenta , polarization four  vectors and spinors needed for our calculation .",

    "our results call for the following remarks :    ( i ) : :    the curves shown in figs .",
    "[ eta0],[f2],[csi ] are approximately flat ,    _ i.e. _ the @xmath2 spectra obtained roughly scale like    @xmath109 , as could be predicted from dimensional    counting rules .",
    "violations of that scaling rule are only logarithmic .",
    "( ii ) : :    correspondingly , it is only through logarithmic factors ( of the type    @xmath110 $ ] or @xmath111 $ ] ) that    those @xmath2 spectra depend on the machine energy .",
    "it    results , as we have checked , that there is a slight increase ,    accompanied by a flattening of the curves , when one passes from spps    to tevatron energy , _ i.e. _ from @xmath112    gev@xmath108 to @xmath113    gev@xmath108 .",
    "( iii ) : :    as usual , the yields predicted with the chernyak ",
    "zhitnitsky    distribution amplitude are somewhat higher ( by a factor of 34 ) than    those computed with the asymptotic one .",
    "( iv ) : :    if one integrates the spectra over @xmath2 from    @xmath114 gev on ( assuming that there are no    additional drastic acceptance cuts ) , the integrated cross sections    obtained are of the order of @xmath115 to    @xmath116 cm@xmath108 , depending on the glueball    candidate and quantum state considered , as well as on the pion    distribution amplitude chosen . some of those cross sections , _",
    "i.e. _    those corresponding to the @xmath7 , to the states    `` @xmath102 '' and `` @xmath118 '' of the    @xmath8 and to the state @xmath86 of the    @xmath9 , might be measurable under present experimental    conditions .",
    "this conclusion calls however for some reservations , if    the sources of uncertainty listed hereafter in ( v)(vii ) are taken    into account .",
    "( v ) : :    in our calculation we have retained only lowest order terms in both    the series expansion in powers of @xmath119 and that in powers    of @xmath92 . noticing that @xmath119    @xmath120 - 0.32truecm    @xmath121 @xmath122 ( since    @xmath123 gev ) and    @xmath124 , it still seems reasonable    to expect that the inclusion of higher  order corrections would not    modify the orders of magnitude obtained .",
    "( vi ) : :    the parametrization of the quark distribution functions at very small    values of @xmath125 ( here    @xmath126 ) has not yet been    verified experimentally . as is shown in fig .",
    "[ etamr ] , a different    parametrization such as msra @xcite would lead to different shapes of    the @xmath2 spectra and consequently to significantly lower    values of the integrated cross sections .",
    "( vii ) : :    one may also change the scale `` @xmath127 '' both in the    expressions of the distribution functions and in that of the    @xmath92 factors involved in the calculation of    @xmath11 .",
    "for instance , setting    `` @xmath127 '' = @xmath128 instead of    @xmath129 modifies the @xmath2 spectra rather    drastically and thus sharply affects , as well , the integrated cross    sections ( see fig .  [ etaq ] ) .",
    "( viii ) : :    it is interesting to compare the yields here obtained with those of    other exclusive channels in hadronic reactions , such as for instance    pion pair production in @xmath3 collisions . that    process has been computed , using the brodsky  lepage model @xcite , by    djagouri et al . @xcite who have however restricted their calculation    to a scattering angle of @xmath130 in the c.m . frame of    the hard subprocess .",
    "comparing    @xmath131_{\\theta=90^\\circ}$ ] for    @xmath132 and    @xmath133 under the same    experimental conditions ( @xmath134    gev@xmath108 , @xmath135 gev ) and with the same    theoretical ingredients ( cteq3 parametrization ,    `` @xmath127''@xmath136 ) , we get the following result :    the largest of the @xmath15 production cross sections ,    namely that for @xmath137 with    `` @xmath102 '' , is about one order of magnitude smaller than    that obtained for @xmath138 production ; more    precisely , the corresponding ratio is 0.42 with the asymptotic pion    distribution amplitude , and 0.063 with the cz one . comparing , on the    other hand , the reactions @xmath139 and    @xmath140 , the ratios of the    corresponding yields are about half of those obtained in the previous    case . finally , comparing @xmath141    or @xmath142 ( still for the same    choice of g ) with @xmath143 ,",
    "the cross sections computed are roughly of the same order ( it is to be    noticed that in both reactions no gluon ",
    "gluon interaction does    contribute ) .",
    "( ix ) : :    as compared with @xmath141 , the    reactions @xmath144 and    @xmath145 would certainly be more    promising from a quantitative point of view , since they would involve    the contribution of gluon  gluon interactions ; that contribution may    indeed be expected to increase the @xmath2 spectra and the    corresponding integrated cross sections by several orders of magnitude    ( see @xcite ) .",
    "( x ) : :    finally let us remark that , if one of the glueballs here considered    contains an admixture of a @xmath22 state ( indeed such    admixtures are sometimes advocated for in the theoretical literature ,    see e.g. @xcite ) , the cross section for @xmath15    production might be substantially increased since in this case the    gluon  gluon interaction would contribute here as well .",
