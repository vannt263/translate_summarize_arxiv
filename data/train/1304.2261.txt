    "after the experimental realization of bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) of @xmath0cr @xcite , @xmath1dy @xcite , and @xmath2er @xcite atoms and a single - component degenerate fermi gas of @xmath3dy @xcite atoms with large magnetic dipolar interaction , there has been new interest in the theoretical and experimental studies of degenerate gases .",
    "polar bose @xcite and fermi @xcite molecules with much larger permanent electric dipole moment are also being considered for future experiments .",
    "the anisotropic long - range nonlocal dipolar interaction acting in all partial waves in these atoms and molecules is distinct from isotropic @xmath4-wave contact interaction . due to the anisotropic nonlocal nature of dipolar interaction ,",
    "the stability of a dipolar bec depends on the number of atoms , dipolar interaction and scattering length as well as , reasonably strongly and distinctly , on the trap geometry @xcite .",
    "for example , in the nondipolar case the spherically symmetric configuration is the most stable one @xcite and accommodate the largest number of atoms , whereas in the dipolar case the disk - shaped configuration is the most stable one .",
    "one advantage in investigating the effect of dipolar interaction in a single - component degenerate dipolar fermi gas over that in a dipolar bec is the remarkable stability of the former .",
    "due to three - body loss via molecule formation , a bec can be easily destroyed .",
    "the three - body loss is highly suppressed in a degenerate fermi gas due to pauli repulsion among identical fermions and this system is unconditionally stable in the absence of dipolar interaction .",
    "nevertheless , in the presence of dipolar interaction beyond a certain strength , both the trapped bec @xcite and the degenerate fermi gas @xcite are unstable because of possible collapse .",
    "new mechanism and route to collapse open up in the presence of dipolar interaction because of atomic interaction in non-@xmath4 ( angular momentum @xmath5 ) waves .",
    "dipolar becs are immediately distinguishable from those with purely contact interaction by their strong and distinct shape and stability dependence on the trapping geometry . in the case of a trapped dipolar bec of @xmath0cr atoms ,",
    "anisotropic @xmath6 wave collapse has been studied both theoretically and experimentally @xcite .",
    "structure formation during the collapse has been studied in a single - component @xcite , in a binary dipolar bec @xcite , and in a dipolar droplet bound in a nondipolar bec @xcite .",
    "we undertake a systematic study of the stability of a trapped dipolar bec and of a trapped degenerate dipolar fermi gas , both with cylindrical symmetry .",
    "the polarization direction is always taken along the axial symmetry direction .",
    "similar studies @xcite of nondipolar becs illustrated the effect of the trapping symmetry and atomic contact attraction on stability .",
    "we present stability plots of a trapped dipolar bec for varying number of atoms , scattering length , dipolar interaction , and trap symmetry .",
    "such stability plots should aid in the future planning of experiments .",
    "the repulsive atomic contact interaction as well as strongly disk - shaped trap should facilitate stability and it is intuitively expected that these could lead to the absolute stability of the dipolar bec and this possibility is supported by a lagrangian variational analysis of the system .",
    "however , a complete dynamical treatment shows that for an increased dipolar interaction , a cylindrically trapped dipolar bec should collapse independent of the underlying trap symmetry and of a large atomic contact repulsion . in the case of polar molecules , under the usual condition of trapping , the number of molecules in a stable bec could be very small , typically , less than a hundred .",
    "the number of molecules in a stable bec can be increased by considering a significantly weaker trap with much reduced trapping frequency .",
    "we also study , using the real - time routine , the dynamical nature of local collapse in dipolar becs induced by a change of dipolar interaction , as opposed to global collapse in nondipolar bec induced by a change in contact interaction managed by the feshbach resonance technique @xcite .",
    "the dipolar interaction can be controlled experimentally by a rotating orienting field @xcite to initiate the collapse while maintaining a constant atomic interaction .",
    "the dipolar interaction is most prominent in disk and cigar shapes and we consider only these shapes . in both cases we evidence local collapse and not a global collapse to the trap center . in cigar shape ,",
    "the dipolar bec is first elongated and compressed on the axial symmetry direction and with further compression , centers of collapse develop along this axis and eventually the collapsed state with small pieces of bec occupies a large extension along the symmetry axis . in disk shape , due to increased dipolar repulsion",
    ", the disk - shaped bec first takes the shape of a donut and individual centers of collapse appear on this donut . eventually , after the collapse and breaking up",
    ", small pieces of bec occupy the whole volume of the entire initial disk .",
    "the stability of a trapped degenerate dipolar fermi gas has been studied by several groups .",
    "@xcite showed that the fock exchange term causes a deformation of the fermi surface in the presence of anisotropic dipolar interaction which plays a crucial role in the stability .",
    "they introduce a variational wigner function to describe the deformation of the fermi gas in phase space and use it to study the stability .",
    "zhang and yi @xcite considered the deformed fermi surface in the form of a ellipsoid and provided a variational and numerical solution of stability .",
    "liu and yin @xcite further included a brueckner - goldstone ( bg ) correlation correction to the energy of a degenerate dipolar fermi gas with deformed fermi surface and studied its stability .",
    "however , we find contradiction among some of the studies and lack of physical plausibility of some of the results . in view of this , we find the necessity of a critical investigation of this problem .    in sec .",
    "[ iia ] we present a brief description of the mean - field model of the dipolar bec which we use in this work .",
    "we also present an analytical variational approximation of the same .",
    "the present theoretical formulation for the degenerate dipolar fermi gas in local - density approximation ( lda ) @xcite is formulated in sec .",
    "an explicit contribution of fock deformation to fermi surface and of the bg correlation correction to energy and chemical potential is included in the lda .",

    "the above consideration takes the fermi surface to be spherical in the presence of the direct hartree contribution to energy .",
