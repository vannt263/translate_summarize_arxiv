    "due to its highly cohesive nature , water can sustain strongly negative pressures exceeding @xmath0 @xcite for long times before the system eventually decays into the vapor phase via cavitation , i.e. , the nucleation of small vapor bubbles . in the initial stages of this process",
    ", the formation of bubbles is opposed by a free energy barrier , and only when this barrier is crossed can the bubble grow to macroscopic size .",
    "the height of this barrier , which is due to the free energetic cost of the bubble  liquid interface , determines the cavitation rate . as a result of the rapid nature of cavitation and the small size of the critical bubble at physically relevant conditions ,",
    "the microscopic mechanism of bubble nucleation in water can not be directly observed in experiments .",
    "however , some microscopic insights can be gained from the measured cavitation rates by use of the nucleation theorem,@xcite which links the change in the height of the free energy barrier in response to a change in external conditions to properties of the critical bubble , i.e. , the bubble corresponding to the top of the free energy barrier .",
    "when experiments are performed at constant temperature , e.g. , in acoustic cavitation setups where regions of negative pressure , @xmath1 , are created by sound waves @xcite , the nucleation theorem relates the pressure derivative of the barrier height @xmath2 to the volume @xmath3 of the critical bubble , @xmath4 thus , an estimate for the volume of the critical bubble can be readily obtained from the measured cavitation rates , which depend exponentially on the barrier heights . to date the most precise and reliable experiments on cavitation in water have been carried out using water in mineral inclusions @xcite . in these experiments , cavities containing liquid water and a vapor bubble",
    "are heated until the bubble disappears and the inclusion is filled by homogeneous fluid . on subsequent cooling , which essentially follows an isochoric path since the volume of the cavities barely changes over the temperature range , the liquid is stretched until cavitation occurs .",
    "when this happens , the tension on the liquid is released resulting in a phase separated system ( bubble in liquid ) . along the isochoric cooling path",
    ", the nucleation theorem relates the properties of the critical bubble to the temperature derivative of the barrier height @xcite , @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the entropy of the critical bubble and @xmath7 is the temperature derivative of the pressure of the metastable liquid at constant volume .",
    "hence , in order to infer the volume @xmath3 of the critical bubble from the measured cavitation rates , an estimate for the entropy @xmath8 of the critical bubble is required ( an estimate for @xmath7 can be obtained from an equation of state @xcite ) .",
    "since @xmath8 can not be directly measured in experiment , computer simulations are a suitable choice to obtain the information needed for the interpretation of experimental data . in this work ,",
    "we perform computer simulations to obtain the entropy @xmath9 as a function of the bubble volume @xmath10 over a wide range of tensions .",
    "our simulations show that , at ambient temperature , the effect of the bubble entropy on the free energetics of nanoscale bubbles is comparable in magnitude to the enthalpic contributions .",
    "since the enthalpic contributions favor the metastable liquid whereas the entropy drives the system towards the vapor , the free energy barrier impeding nucleation is a direct result of these competing effects .",
    "furthermore , we find that the bubble entropy per unit area decreases linearly with the mean curvature @xmath11 of the bubble , suggesting a connection to the number of free oh groups at the vapor  liquid interface .",
    "bubble entropies determined in our simulations suggest that the entropy of the flat liquid  vapor interface can be used as an estimate in the interpretation of experimental data , as done in ref .",
    ", thereby providing the basis for the application of the nucleation theorem to inclusion experiments .",
    "in this section , we first provide details on the computational techniques used to obtain our results , followed by a definition of the bubble volume employed in our simulations , which is calibrated to correspond to the true volume of bubbles on the molecular level . to conclude , we describe how the entropy of a flat vapor ",
    "liquid interface at ambient conditions , which serves as a point of comparison to the computed bubble entropies , is obtained .",

    "the free energy of cavitation as a function of the volume of the largest bubble was computed by umbrella sampling  @xcite with a hybrid monte carlo ( hmc ) scheme  @xcite . during each hmc move",
    ", the center of mass and angular velocities of each molecule were drawn from the maxwell  boltzmann distribution corresponding to the desired temperature of @xmath13 and the system was propagated according to newton s equations of motion using a time - reversible quaternion - based integrator  @xcite that maintains the rigid geometry of water molecules .",
    "each hmc step consisted of three molecular dynamics integration steps with a time step @xmath14 and pressure was kept constant by isotropic volume moves accepted according to the metropolis criterion @xcite .",
    "sampling was enhanced by replica exchange moves @xcite between neighboring windows and histograms obtained for the individual windows were pieced together using a self consistent histogram method.@xcite      in order to study homogeneous bubble nucleation in water , we use the volume of the largest bubble as a local order parameter . a committor analysis performed at ambient temperature and negative pressures",
    "suggests that the volume of the largest bubble constitutes a good reaction coordinate for cavitation@xcite .",
    "estimates for the volume @xmath10 of every bubble present in the system are obtained by use of the v - method,@xcite which is designed to give thermodynamically consistent bubble volumes , i.e. , volumes consistent with the nucleation theorem .",
    "the v - method consists of two steps .",
    "first , the preliminary volume @xmath15 of the largest bubble in the system is assessed by using a grid - based order parameter similar to the procedure employed in ref .  . and @xmath15 in this work correspond to @xmath16 and @xmath10 in ref .  ,",
    "respectively . ] to this end , we superimpose a three - dimensional grid consisting of @xmath17 points onto the system and determine vapor - like points , i.e. , points where no liquid - like molecules are within a cutoff radius of @xmath18 .",
    "( a molecule is considered to be liquid - like if it has at least one molecule within the same cutoff radius . ) these vapor - like grid points are then clustered and each of the resulting clusters constitutes a bubble with volume equal to the total volume of the grid cells belonging to the respective cluster .",
    "the largest one of these volumes is the preliminary volume @xmath15 which we use to track the progress of the nucleation process .",
    "note that a number of suitable bubble detection procedures have been suggested in the literature @xcite , which can all be used to obtain the preliminary volume @xmath15 of the largest bubble in the system . in the second step ,",
    "we calibrate the bubble volume @xmath10 such that it corresponds to the average change in system volume due to the presence of such a bubble : @xmath19 here , @xmath20 is the average volume of the system when @xmath21 bubbles of volume @xmath15 are present and @xmath22 corresponds to the average change in system volume @xmath23 when a single bubble of volume @xmath15 is added or removed . for bubble volumes that are unlikely to occur spontaneously on the time - scale of a straightforward simulation ,",

    "note that , although the calibration procedure is based on the average volume of the system when a number of bubbles of a given size is present , the detection of the bubbles on the grid is still a local procedure and thus suitable for the study of large systems , where fluctuations in the liquid density may render global order parameters ineffective .",

    "<S> water can exist in a metastable liquid state under tension for long times before the system relaxes into the vapor via cavitation , i.e. , bubble nucleation . </S>",
    "<S> microscopic information on the cavitation process can be extracted from experimental data by use of the nucleation theorem , which relates measured cavitation rates to the size of the critical bubble . </S>",
    "<S> to apply the nucleation theorem to experiments performed along an isochoric path , for instance , in cavitation experiments in mineral inclusions , knowledge of the bubble entropy is required . using computer simulations , </S>",
    "<S> we compute the entropy of bubbles in water as a function of their volume over a wide range of tensions from free energy calculations . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the bubble entropy is an important contribution to the free energy which significantly lowers the barrier to bubble nucleation , thereby facilitating cavitation . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the bubble entropy per surface area depends on the curvature of the liquid  vapor interface , decreasing approximately linearly with its mean curvature over the studied range of bubble volumes . at room temperature , </S>",
    "<S> the entropy of a flat liquid  vapor interface at ambient pressure is very similar to that of critical bubbles over a wide range of tensions , which justifies the use of the former as an approximation when interpreting data from experiments . </S>",
    "<S> based on our simulation results , we obtain an estimate for the volume of the critical bubble from experimentally measured cavitation rates . </S>"
