    "later in this paper we will present a general analysis of the gravitational effect on light in a strongly dispersive medium from a general relativity perspective .",
    "however , the basic intuition of the physics can be understood quite simply .",
    "a slow - light medium has an index of refraction that sharply varies linearly with frequency in a particular frequency range",
    ". a beam of light will be slightly gravitationally red- or blue - shifted as it changes height in the medium .",
    "the combination of these effects gives the index of refraction an effectively linear height dependence , which is amplified by the steep dispersion relation .",
    "the height dependence of the index of refraction will then be translated into a spatial deflection of the light beam as the beam propagates .",
    "therefore , by measuring the spatial deflection of the beam , one is indirectly measuring the effects of the gravitational red - shift .    relying on the above intuition",
    ", we can now estimate the size of the effect in a table - top experiment . assuming that the deflection height , @xmath1 , will be small , the index of refraction @xmath5 may be expanded to linear order in @xmath1 as follows , @xmath6 the gravitational red - shift ( [ eq : redshift ] ) implies that @xmath7 .",
    "the classical theory of optics @xcite defines the phase velocity @xmath8 and group velocity @xmath9 of a wave packet as @xmath10 and using the dispersion relation @xmath11 , we can rewrite @xmath12 $ ] .",
    "hence , the effective index of refraction may be written as @xmath13 using the approximation that @xmath14 , and @xmath15 , we can rewrite this in the simplest form that still preserves the characteristic velocities : @xmath16    this index of refraction leads to a deflection of the beam , given by solving the geometric optics equation @xcite , @xmath17 = \\nabla n.\\ ] ] this is done by considering a beam initially pointing in the horizontal @xmath18 direction and taking the @xmath19-component of the above equation to find the conservation law , @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the downward angle of the beam from the horizontal .",
    "the trajectory may be found by considering @xmath22 where the expansion is to first order in @xmath23 , and we have approximated @xmath24 .",
    "this simple differential equation can now be solved for the vertical deflection @xmath25 , given a horizontal displacement @xmath26 , yielding @xmath27 similarly , the angle @xmath21 of the final beam relative to the horizontal is given by , @xmath28 the more careful analysis later in this paper confirms that these expressions are indeed the first order approximation to the vertical drop .    making an estimate , we assume plausible lab values of @xmath29 , @xmath30 , and @xmath31 , so the vertical deflection is estimated to be @xmath32 , and the angular deflection is estimated to be @xmath33 . by varying @xmath26 , or @xmath9 , the deflection can be adjusted by several orders of magnitude around this estimate .",
    "the nontrivial nature of this proposed experiment requires careful attention . the assumption that the index of refraction varies as a function of height restricts the number of systems that can be used to deflect the light .",
    "for example , electromagnetically induced transparency @xcite , nonlinear magneto - optical rotations @xcite , coherent population oscillations @xcite or raman - nath interference in liquid crystal light valves @xcite can probably all achieve the experimental products needed for an observable signal .",
    "however , all of these systems use a strong pump beam to prepare a coherence or interference in the medium .",
    "the pump beam is also experiencing the gravitational redshift . for pump beams of nearly the same frequency as the probe ,",
    "the redshift of the probe is then washed out , because the index of refraction established by the pump beam also shifts in the same direction as the probe beam . since @xmath34 ,",
    "only when the pump beam is dramatically different in frequency will a pump - prepared system have the ability to detect the red - shift .",
    "in addition to the problems associated with a shifting dispersion , pump beams with a nonuniform intensity profile ( e.g. , gaussian beams ) also cause some guiding effects due to index of refraction changes .",
    "some absolute frequency systems also have technical difficulties .",
    "for example , hot atomic vapors have gravitational and thermal density gradients that would usually overwhelm the small deflection @xcite .",
    "one can envision certain classes of systems that have promise to measure the deflection .",
    "one class of systems is one in which a pump beam and probe beam propagate in opposite directions .",
    "this is effectively the same as having a pump beam blue shifted while the probe is red shifted .",
    "the deflection would be twice as large , because the dispersion is shifting in the opposite direction in frequency space as the probe as a function of height .",
    "another class of systems is one which uses fixed frequency , narrow resonance , solid state , bulk materials .",
    "if the inhomogeneous broadening is negligible , the probe frequency can be very close to the resonance frequency to achieve small group velocities .",
    "these experimental parameters are demanding .    in order to measure these small gravitational effects",
    ", we enlist quantum mechanics for help .",
    "interference effects can measure length differences of much less than a wavelength .",
    "indeed , manly and page have proposed to essentially directly measure the change in the index of refraction ( [ result ] ) by interfering a red - shift beam with a blue - shifted beam in a fiber - based sagnac interferometer @xcite .",
    "such an approach can also be taken in a slow - light medium .",
    "we describe below another quantum approach using another kind of quantum interference . in order to measure such a small deflection of a light beam",
    ", we propose to extend recent advances in precision metrology by amplifying the deflection using quantum `` weak value '' measurements @xcite .",
    "weak values have the property that the post - selected expectation value of an operator can exceed the eigenvalue bounds of the operator @xcite . recently , hosten and kwiat successfully used optical weak value measurements to detect a 1   deflection in an optical beam @xcite . in the hosten - kwiat experiment ,",
    "the weak value operator was the polarization of the light beam , which was entangled with the transverse position degree of freedom .",
    "most slow - light materials do not have a polarization - dependent index of refraction , so we propose to use instead a ` which - path ' operator of an optical sagnac interferometer @xcite as shown in fig .",
    "a laser source is at the input of a sagnac interferometer .",
    "if no other optical element is in the interferometer and with ideal alignment , all of the light will exit the input port of the interferometer .",
    "the optical path length of both directions are identical in a sagnac because both paths simply traverse the same route but in different directions .",
    "the reason all of the light exits only the input ( or bright ) port is due to a relative @xmath35 phase shift for each reflection versus transmission through the beam splitter , resulting in exactly destructive interference for the _ dark port_. using a tunable birefringent element ( a soleil babinet compensator , sbc ) , we can break the symmetry and cause a relative tunable phase between the two directions in the interferometer . for this gedanken experiment",
    ", we assume the light entering the interferometer is horizontally polarized .",
    "the light that is propagating in the counter clockwise direction is rotated to be vertical via a half wave plate oriented at 45@xmath36 with respect to the horizontal polarization .",
    "we align the sbc such that the vertically polarized light receives a relative phase shift @xmath37 compared with the horizontally polarized light which is propagating in the clockwise direction .",
    "the light propagating in the clockwise direction is then made to be vertically polarized .",
    "the two paths then interfere at the beam splitter but the counter clockwise light has picked up a tunable relative phase shift of @xmath37 .    )",
    "wave - plate and a soleil babinet compensator ( sbc ) , one can tune the relative phase acquired for each direction in the interferometer .",
    "this allows us to tune between the dark and bright ports , which is necessary for weak value measurements .",
    "the slow light medium the interferometer allows us to couple the ` which - way ' information of the interferometer to the transverse deflection of the light beam . a quadrant detector , which measures beam deflections , is in the dark port of the interferometer.,width=302 ]    a slow light medium ( slm ) is placed in the interferometer , causing a transverse gravitational deflection @xmath38 of the beam in the downward direction .",
    "we want to amplify this deflection using weak value techniques . by placing the slm at an asymmetric point in the optical path",
    ", we can arrange that there is a long path of length @xmath39 ( corresponding to the clockwise direction @xmath40 having a larger deflection @xmath41 ) and a short path of length @xmath42 ( corresponding to the counter - clockwise direction @xmath43 having a smaller deflection @xmath44 ) between the slm and the 50/50 beam splitter .",
    "we now describe how to use weak values to amplify the small spatial deviation .",
    "we define the _ system _ as being the which - path information of the light beam , and the _ meter _ as the transverse profile of the beam .",
    "the system operator is the which - path operator @xmath45 . following the propagation of the state through the sagnac interferometer ,",
    "starting from a pre - selected system state @xmath46 ( formed at the bs ) , and postselecting on a system state @xmath47 ( exiting the dark port ) we find that the _ weak value _ a_w = of @xmath48 is given by a purely imaginary result , a_w i .",
    "the sbc phase @xmath49 characterizes the deviation from perfect darkness , and is responsible for the amplification of the deflection .",
    "see ref .",
    "@xcite for detailed calculations . expressing the deflection in terms of the gravitational deflection angle @xmath21 ( [ eq : intuitive angular displacement ] ) , @xmath50 , we have for the total deflection , y= , where @xmath51 is a factor originating from the dynamical propagation , which brings additional enhancement ( a factor of about 100 in ref .",
    "this deflection is then directly measured with a quadrant detector in the dark port .",
    "in order to give a rigorous treatment of light propagation through media with anomalous dispersion in a gravitational field , we start with the wave equation itself . many of the historical treatments of light propagation have implicitly assumed the index of refraction to be weakly dependent ( or not dependent ) on frequency since the derivations were done before slow light was a commonly studied phenomenon , e.g. ref .",
    "hence , a revisitation of the physical foundations is illuminating .",
    "the components of an vector em wave propagating through a material medium obeys the modified wave equation , @xmath52 here @xmath53 is any component of a vector em wave , @xmath54 is the index of refraction of the material , and @xmath55 is the speed of light in vacuum .",
    "we assume the propagating wave components have the form @xmath56 , where @xmath57 is the _ eikonal _ of the wave @xcite .",
    "then , to leading order in @xmath58 , we get an equation for the eikonal itself in the geometrical ray approximation , @xmath59 the eikonal relation holds for all components of the vector em wave so the vector nature of the em wave itself is unchanged during the propagation as a ray . by taking the leading order in @xmath58 , we assume @xmath60 is small compared to the length scales through which the wave propagates , such that the wave behaves effectively as a ray .",
    "note that the ray may still undergo small angular deflections without violating this approximation , which is a crucial point for the results in this paper .    in small regions of space and time",
    ", the eikonal can be expanded in a series to first order in space and time , @xmath61 where we have incorporated the wavelength @xmath60 into the eikonal for notational simplicity . comparing this approximation to the eikonal for a plane wave , @xmath62",
    ", we define the frequency and wave vector of the wave for a _ local _ region where the eikonal can be approximated as planar , @xmath63    we then rewrite the eikonal equation ( [ eq : eikonal flat space ] ) in terms of the local wave vector and frequency for each infinitesimal region of space and time , @xmath64 here the potential dependence of the index of refraction , @xmath54 , on the local frequency and position is written explicitly as a reminder .",
    "the eikonal equation can be rearranged and square - rooted , giving the usual dispersion relation for the medium in a localized region , @xmath65 the signs are chosen to keep the frequency , @xmath66 , positive .",
    "an analogy can be made between the mechanics of material particles and the motion of wave packets that exposes a new set of canonical variables and allows a systematic derivation of the equations of motion for the wave packet .    from eqns .",
    "( [ eq : wave number definition flat space ] , [ eq : frequency definition flat space ] ) , we see that the eikonal , @xmath67 , plays the role of the action of the system , @xmath68 , with the wave vector , @xmath69 , corresponding to the momentum of the wave , @xmath70 , and the frequency , @xmath66 , corresponding to the energy , @xmath71 . in particular ,",
    "as is well known from quantum mechanics , the energy and momenta of a wave packet composed of plane waves are directly proportional to the frequency and wave numbers , respectively .",
    "the scaling constant in quantum mechanics is @xmath72 , implying that the classical action is just the scaled eikonal for the wave packet .",
    "the explicit correspondence for the translation to hamiltonian dynamics is @xmath73 using this correspondence , either the eikonal equation ( [ eq : dispersion squared flat space ] ) or the dispersion relation ( [ eq : dispersion flat space ] ) can be understood to represent hamilton - jacobi equations of the system in an implicit form @xcite . solving each for @xmath66 would give the standard form of the hamilton - jacobi equation using these identified canonical coordinates .",
    "furthermore , @xmath66 will be a conserved quantity since the equations are independent of @xmath74 .",
    "for convenience in referring to these equations , we will denote the eikonal relation as @xmath51 and the dispersion relation as @xmath75 : @xmath76    using the conserved quantity @xmath66 as the hamiltonian of the system , we can write down hamilton s equations of motion directly in the form , @xmath77 it becomes clear at this point that @xmath78 must be interpreted as the _ group velocity _ of a wave packet that obeys the eikonal equation , and not the phase velocity of the carrier wave itself .",
    "hamilton s equations of motion along with the eikonal equation completely determine the motion of a _ wave packet _ treated as a point - particle through a material medium along a geometrical ray .",
    "the geometrical ray approximation made to derive the eikonal relation implicitly assumes wave packet behavior .",
    "if the form of the index of refraction @xmath54 is known , then @xmath51 or @xmath75 may be solved for @xmath66 , and hamilton s equations can be solved for the trajectory of the packet directly .",
    "in order to include the influence of gravity on the slow light beam , we recall that the main gravitational effect for earth - based experiments is the gravitational red - shift .",
    "the following simple rule can be used to make a _ weak field _",
    "translation of the dispersion relation to include gravitational effects , @xmath79 where @xmath80 is the scaled newtonian gravitational potential .",
    "we give a general relativistic justification of this rule in the appendix .",
    "it is the spatial dependence of @xmath81 in the shift of the frequency that will cause a bending of the trajectory of light .",
    "the gravitational redshift is very small , @xmath82 , so we expand the dispersion relation ( [ g ] ) after the replacement ( [ eq : frequency redshift ] ) to first order in @xmath81 , @xmath83 , \\nonumber \\\\    & \\approx & |\\vec{k}| - \\frac{\\omega}{v_p}\\left(1 - u\\frac{v_p}{v_g}\\right ) , \\label{eq : dispersion2 } \\\\    & = & 0 , \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we have used the standard definitions of @xmath9 and @xmath8 ( [ vp],[vg ] ) .",
    "we will see in the next section that the definition of @xmath9 is effectively unchanged .",
    "this final simplification hides the simple frequency redshift that is occurring , but makes the form of the first order correction in terms of the quantity @xmath84 particularly apparent .      we proceed to solve hamilton s equations of motion with the frequency @xmath66 playing the role of the hamiltonian of the system , and the new dispersion equation ( [ eq : dispersion2 ] ) acting as the hamilton - jacobi equation .",
    "hamilton s equation ( [ eq : hamilton s eq - wave position ] ) gives the vector group velocity of the packet .",
    "the frequency @xmath66 involves only the quantity @xmath85 , so @xmath86 .",
    "therefore , we now focus on the magnitude of the group velocity . applying a frequency derivative to ( [ eq : dispersion2 ] )",
    "yields @xmath87 \\nonumber \\\\    & & - 2u\\frac{\\omega}{c}{\\frac{\\partial n(\\omega)}{\\partial \\omega } } - u\\frac{\\omega^2}{c }    \\frac{\\partial^2 n(\\omega)}{\\partial \\omega^2}. \\label{dkdw}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    now we make the slow light approximation that @xmath54 is linear in @xmath66 .",
    "slow light occurs for a frequency band where the index of refraction @xmath54 has a steep linear dependence on @xmath66 with positive slope .",
    "therefore we neglect the last ( second - order derivative ) term in eq .",
    "( [ dkdw ] ) , so @xmath88 we see that the group velocity is modified very slightly from its traditional form by the presence of the gravitational field .",
    "however , the packet will always travel in the same direction as the wave vector .",

    "here @xmath96 is the radius of the earth , @xmath97 is the mass of the earth , @xmath75 is newton s gravitational constant , and @xmath98 is the height displacement from the initial starting position of the packet . notice that the scaling factor in ( [ eq : wave vector change raw ] ) is the ratio of the new group velocity to the normal group velocity .",
    "noting the fact that @xmath99 , @xmath100 , and @xmath101 for the surface of the earth and the optical domains we are considering , we can reduce equations ( [ eq : group velocity raw ] ) and ( [ eq : wave vector change raw ] ) to simpler final forms , @xmath102 the group velocity appears unchanged to a very good approximation with such a weak field from what is traditionally expected in a slow light medium , but the wave vector picks up a small , effectively constant , deflection over time that is dependent on the carrier frequency of the packet and the local gravitational acceleration .",
    "the deflection points toward the gravitating body , so light will bend toward the body , matching intuition .      with the newly derived approximate equations of motion for the weak field limit at the surface of the earth , ( [ eq : group velocity ] ) and ( [ eq : wave vector change ] ) , we can solve the trajectory of a point - like wave packet in a straight forward manner .",
    "assume that for a small local bit of trajectory the radial direction can be well approximated by the vertical cartesian direction @xmath103 , and consider the wave vector pointing entirely in the horizontal cartesian direction @xmath104 at an initial time @xmath105 , so , @xmath106 here @xmath8 is the phase velocity of the packet .",

    "notice that the wave rotation is not dependent on the group velocity , but only on the carrier phase velocity .",
    "the group velocity only appears when we calculate the position of the packet .",
    "the final approximation ( [ approx ] ) is made since we are only concerned with the lowest - order drop @xcite .    solving for @xmath110 from ( [ eq : group velocity ] ) , starting the packet at an initial position @xmath111 at the start of a medium of length @xmath26 yields @xmath112 which is a parabolic trajectory analogous to a kinematic trajectory , but with an effective gravitational acceleration given by",
    ", @xmath113 thus a wave packet drops much _ less _ due to gravity in a medium with slow group velocity than it would in vacuum in the same amount of time , explaining why we have not casually observed them dropping like rocks in previous experiments !",
    "since we are interested mostly in how the wave packet trajectory is altered after traversal though a finite slow - light region , we set the final horizontal position to the length of the propagation region : @xmath114 . solving for @xmath115",
    ", we see that @xmath116    we can now solve for the vertical drop after a traversal of horizontal distance @xmath26 , yielding , @xmath117 again , this drop is analogous to the drop found in a kinematic trajectory , but with the effective gravitational acceleration ( [ eq : effective gravitational acceleration ] ) and horizontal velocity @xmath9 . despite the fact that the effective gravitational acceleration is reduced ,",
    "the long propagation time compensates for this , resulting in an amplified deflection .",
    "we have shown that a slow light medium is expected to amplify the effects of gravity on a wave packet such that they may become visible to a sensitive apparatus using weak value measurement .",
    "the primary weak field gravitational effect is the induced position - dependence of the carrier frequency of the light , @xmath118 , where @xmath81 is the dimensionless newtonian gravitational potential .",
    "the position - dependence of the frequency shift is amplified by the strong frequency dependence of the slow light medium , which translates to a magnified bending of the trajectory of the light as it moves through the medium .    using the modified dispersion relation for the em wave components of the light ( [ eq : dispersion2 ] ) as a hamilton - jacobi equation , we applied hamilton s equations of motion to find a parabolic trajectory of the slow - light pulse through the medium ( [ eq : time - dependent trajectory approximation ] ) .",
    "we found that the trajectory is analogous to a simple kinematic trajectory , but with a much smaller effective gravitational acceleration .",
    "the smaller effective acceleration is more than compensated by the longer travel time , leading to the amplified vertical drop ( [ eq : vertical displacement approximation ] ) . for typical current lab values",
    ", we expect a vertical drop on the order of @xmath119 angstrom for a traversal distance of roughly @xmath120 .",
    "although the predicted displacement is tiny , it borders what is currently possible to detect with the amplified precision of a weak value enhanced measurement .",
    "we have proposed an optical weak values measurement , based on post - selected weak measurements of a which - path operator in a sagnac interferometer .",
    "this proposal has the advantage that in contract to previous experiments @xcite , the optical deflection does not need to be polarization dependent .",
    "we stress that this fact makes the idea applicable to amplify an optical deflection originating from _ any _ optical element . aside from the fundamental aspects of detecting a gravitational red - shift in a laboratory setting ,",
    "a table - top detector would open a new field in precision gravitational metrology .",
    "the purpose of this appendix is to describe how to relativize slow - light equations of motions .",
    "we will convert the eikonal equation into relativistic form , then pass to curved space - time , and then specialize to the weak - field case in order to justify the red - shift replacement @xmath121 .",

    "<S> we explore the nature of the classical propagation of light through media with strong frequency - dependent dispersion in the presence of a gravitational field . in the weak field limit </S>",
    "<S> , gravity causes a redshift of the optical frequency , which the slow - light medium converts into a spatially - varying index of refraction . </S>",
    "<S> this results in the bending of a light ray in the medium . </S>",
    "<S> we further propose experimental techniques to amplify and detect the phenomenon using weak value measurements . </S>",
    "<S> independent heuristic and rigorous derivations of this effect are given .    </S>",
    "<S> we live in an age where we constantly push technological boundaries to explore the subtleties of the quantum domain and to challenge our understanding of the microscopic world . </S>",
    "<S> occasionally these explorations lead us full circle back to the macroscopic classical regime to prompt new and interesting questions about previously studied topics . </S>",
    "<S> these revisitations only deepen our understanding of the world .    </S>",
    "<S> new materials with strong frequency - dependent dispersion are also being explored that allow for remarkably slow group velocities in the propagation of light @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these new developments have raised a new question : can we actually measure the effect of gravity on slow light using a table - top device ? </S>",
    "<S> the purpose of this paper is to describe how this could be done .    </S>",
    "<S> one of the first tests of the general theory of relativity @xcite was the confirmation of the bending of light near the sun in 1919 , showing that gravity does affect the propagation of light @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , it has been difficult historically to test these effects in any compact way in a laboratory . between the fact that gravity is a rather weak effect and the fact that light typically travels at large speeds , </S>",
    "<S> any measurement of a gravitational effect on the propagation has required a large propagation distance  much larger than any typical laboratory .    for earth - confined experiments , however , the dominant measurable effect of gravity on light is the gravitational red - shift of the frequency , and not the bending of its trajectory ( see e.g. @xcite ) . according to this effect , </S>",
    "<S> a photon starting at an initial height @xmath0 and climbing to a final height @xmath1 will have its frequency red - shifted in a weak gravitational field , @xmath2 the shift in frequency can be viewed as a manifestation of the equivalence principle : the crests of sequential light waves spread further apart as the beam climbs . </S>",
    "<S> alternatively , the shift of the frequency can be considered to arise from conservation of energy as the photon climbs a potential well . as we shall see later </S>",
    "<S> , the height - dependence of the frequency continues to be the dominant effect of gravity during slow light propagation that also results in a slight bending of the trajectory .    </S>",
    "<S> the shift in frequency due to gravitation may be small , but pound and rebka managed to measure and verify it to within 10% of the predicted value in 1959 using a height difference of only @xmath3 meters @xcite . their experiment used gamma rays emitted by the nucleus of iron-57 to achieve the sharp spectral lines needed to measure the shift . </S>",
    "<S> the mssbauer effect , stating that atoms in a lattice may emit radiation from their nuclei with almost no recoil since the entire lattice collectively recoils , allowed the gamma rays to be emitted with minimal doppler broadening , improving the precision . </S>",
    "<S> further tests have since been done using greater height differences and techniques to measure the effect of gravitational redshift to a precision of about one part in @xmath4 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the effect has even been necessary to include in the gps guidance system @xcite . to the best of our knowledge </S>",
    "<S> , the pound - rebka experiment holds the record for the shortest height difference to see a gravitational effect on light .    </S>",
    "<S> the aim of this paper is to combine the physics of slow - light materials with gravitational effects on the light . </S>",
    "<S> we show from fundamental principles that a light ray is predicted to follow a parabolic trajectory through the medium ( to leading order in the gravitational field strength ) . the bending is predicted to arise from the gravitational redshift , which is amplified by the strongly dispersive slow - light medium . for typical experimental setups at the time of writing , we predict the expected deflection to be on the order of an angstrom . </S>",
    "<S> we also propose an experimental set - up to detect this very small beam displacement . </S>",
    "<S> hence , if the experiment proposed in this paper is realized , then the effects of the gravitational red - shift would beat the previous height record by many orders of magnitude . </S>",
    "<S> we note that this question has also been recently examined independently by kumar @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however both our qualitative explanation , as well as our quantitative predictions of this effect are very different . </S>"
