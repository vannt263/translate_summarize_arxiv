    "in a superconductor , a longitudinal density oscillation corresponds to an oscillation of the phase of the superconducting order parameter . as shown by bogolyubov _",
    "et el . _ @xcite and anderson , @xcite this oscillation would amount to a collective mode with zero energy at zero wavevector in the absence of the long - range coulomb interaction between the conduction electrons .",
    "the presence of this interaction , however , causes the condensate density oscillation to become the electronic plasma oscillation , typically with an energy of 5 - 10 ev .",
    "leggett showed that for a simple model of a two - band superconductor it could be possible for the superconducting condensates in each band to oscillate longitudinally relative to one another , equivalent to an oscillation in the relative phase of the two condensates , with the net displacement of the total condensate being zero .",
    "@xcite the frequency of this mode and its dispersion with wavevector @xmath4 would depend substantially on the effective interband pairing potential .",
    "if this potential were sufficiently small , but not zero , the small @xmath4 mode frequency would be less than the smaller of the superconducting gaps @xmath6 , for the two bands .",
    "in the low temperature limit this mode would become a true collective mode with an infinite lifetime .",
    "there is good evidence that mgb@xmath2 is a multiband superconductor . whereas theory suggests that there are 2 bands primarily of @xmath7 character and 2 bands of @xmath8 character , @xcite most experimental superconducting properties",
    "can be described as though there were one @xmath9 band and one @xmath3 band .",

    "the root mean square fermi velocity components are large and nearly isotropic .",
    "electronic raman scattering measurements in @xmath12 symmetry @xmath13 or @xmath14 show two features due to superconductivity : a relatively sharp peak at @xmath15 mev associated with the @xmath10 band and an onset without a peak at @xmath16 mev associated with the @xmath3 band . @xcite as shown by blumberg _",

    "@xcite apart from two - phonon features , an electronic raman peak was found at 9.4 mev , midway between the onset of the @xmath3 band continuum at @xmath18 and the @xmath10 band peak at @xmath19 . because it can decay into the @xmath3 band continuum",
    ", the mode signified by this peak can not be a true collective mode .",

    "the bare vertex @xmath23 comes from the electron - photon interaction and is the sum of two terms : the @xmath24 term , where @xmath25 is the vector potential , couples to the electron density operator in first order , and the @xmath26 term couples in second order , ( @xmath27 is the electron momentum operator ) to a density - like quantity through a virtual intermediate state .",
    "the sum of these terms , @xmath28 gives the amplitude for excitation from near the fs to near the fs of an electron from wavevector @xmath29 to wavevector @xmath30 while the incident laser @xmath31 photon is transformed into the scattered @xmath32 photon with respective wavevector and energy transfers @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "for small values of @xmath4 relative to the fermi wavevector , the vertex @xmath23 does not depend on @xmath35 .",
    "due to the @xmath26 term , @xmath23 will depend on @xmath36 when the excitation energy to the intermediate state comes into resonance with @xmath37 .",

    "to carry out the calculation , we will set up the problem in a more general fashion and then make the assumption that @xmath23 is a positive constant for @xmath41 in the @xmath3 band and a negative constant for @xmath41 in the @xmath43 band .",
    "these bare vertices create a positive charge - density ( particle / hole or p / h ) excitation of wave - vector @xmath44 in the @xmath45 band and a negative charge - density excitation of wave - vector @xmath21 in the @xmath10 band . in the nambu formalism @xcite used by k - d",
