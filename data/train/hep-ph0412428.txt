    "hadronic b decays attract a lot of attention because of its role in determining the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) matrix elements , extracting cp - violating angles and even revealing physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "however in most cases , a deep understanding on the strong dynamics in hadronic b decays is prerequisite for the above purposes .",
    "phenomenologically the naive factorization ansatz ( nf ) @xcite , supported by color transparency argument @xcite , is widely used in hadronic two - body b decays .",
    "however the unphysical dependence of the decay amplitude on renormalization scale indicates a prominent role of qcd corrections to nf . in this respect ,",
    "@xmath11 decays are of special interest as these channels vanish in the approximation of nf , due to the spin - parity and vector current conservation .",
    "therefore they provide a good opportunity to study the qcd corrections to nf .",
    "it was generally believed that the branching ratios of these channels should be quite small as the qcd corrections are either suppressed by strong coupling @xmath12 or @xmath13 .",
    "but babar @xcite and belle @xcite have found a surprisingly large branching ratio of @xmath14 decay , @xmath15 actually this large branching ratio is even comparable , for example , to that of @xmath16 decay which is not forbidden in nf .",
    "another surprising observation is that , the upper limit of @xmath17 decay is roughly an order of magnitude smaller than the observed branching ratio of @xmath18 decay @xcite , @xmath19 while naively the branching ratios of @xmath20 decays are expected to be at the same order .    in the following",
    "we shall discuss these decay channels using the qcd factorization ( qcdf ) approach @xcite . in this framework ,",
    "the final state light meson is described by the light - cone distribution amplitude(lcda ) , while for the @xmath21-wave charmonium @xmath22 , we shall adopt the covariant projection method of non - relativistic qcd @xcite .",
    "it is well known that , for the inclusive decay and production of @xmath21-wave charmonia , the color - octet mechanism must be introduced to guarantee the infrared safety .",
    "however it is still unclear how to incorporate this mechanism in a model - independent way into exclusive processes .",
    "thus the decay amplitudes @xmath23 would be inevitably infrared divergent when only the color - singlet picture is adopted for @xmath24 , which is shown explicitly in @xcite .",
    "thus strictly speaking , the qcdf approach is not applicable for @xmath20 decays due to the breakdown of factorization .    in this paper , to get a model estimation , we will introduce the binding energy @xmath1 @xcite as an effective cut - off to regularize the infrared divergence appearing in the diagrams of vertex corrections ( see fig .",
    "1 ) . in fact , the logarithmic divergence @xmath25 term in the limit @xmath26 for the vertex corrections in @xmath20 decays is similar to the @xmath25 term found in ref .",
    "@xcite for the production of @xmath21-wave charmonium in @xmath27 collisions . as for the spectator scattering contributions",
    ", there appears logarithmic divergence at twist-2 level and linear divergence at twist-3 level .",
    "phenomenologically we shall parameterize these divergence as @xmath28 $ ] and @xmath29 respectively , where the non perturbative parameter @xmath30 again acts as an effective cut - off to regularize the endpoint divergence @xcite . according to the qcdf approach ,",
    "all other contributions are power suppressed by @xmath13 .",
    "we find that , with the above method , the branching ratio of @xmath14 decay is about @xmath31 , which is several times smaller than the experimental measurements . at the same time , we also get the branching ratio of @xmath32 decay at about @xmath33 , which is significantly larger than the upper limit @xmath34 observed by babar @xcite . but the above estimation is very crude in that the strong phases effects are completely ignored . notice further that for the spectator contributions , there contains only logarithmic divergence at twist-2 level , while linear divergence appears at the twist-3 level , the strong phases of the twist-2 and twist-3 spectator terms could be quite different .",
    "we then briefly discuss the potential strong phases effects and argue that very different strong phases between twist-2 and twist-3 spectator terms together with a slightly larger @xmath8 seems to be able to reproduce the experimental hierarchy @xmath35 .",

    "@xmath42 and @xmath43 are leading twist and twist-3 distribution amplitudes of @xmath37 meson , respectively .",
    "it is understood that only after the factor @xmath44 in the denominator is canceled , may we take the collinear limit @xmath45 , @xmath46 .",
    "notice that in principle we could also start directly from the original light - cone projector of k meson in coordinate space @xcite , and the physical results should be the same .",
    "but in this case care must be taken that , only with a proper regularization , can one do the relevant convolution integrals correctly .",
    "the readers may refer to the appendix of @xcite for further details .",

    "this is a little bit surprising , because for charmonium b decays , the theoretical results are normally a few times _ smaller _ than the experimental measurements .",
    "the careful reader may have noticed that in the above analysis we did not consider the uncertainty related to the parameter @xmath81 .",
    "in fact a larger @xmath137 could enhance the branching ratio of @xmath138 decay significantly , but unfortunately it would also enhance that of @xmath17 decay with similar magnitude .",
    "notice that @xmath20 share many common inputs , the ratio of branching ratios of these two channels should have mild dependence on the input parameters , for example it is independent on the parameter @xmath93 .",
    "our numerical analysis shows that this is indeed the case , with @xmath139 : @xmath140 where the uncertainties arise from the parameters @xmath137 , @xmath141 , @xmath142 and @xmath143 , respectively .",
    "the above ratio is clearly in strong contradiction with the experimental hierarchy @xmath144 .",
    "notice that the chirally enhanced power corrections , namely twist-3 spectator contributions in this case , have been included in the above estimation . for the rest part of power corrections , there is no systematic way to estimate them yet .",
    "but since the power corrections are suppressed by @xmath13 , intuitively they might lead to an uncertainty of about @xmath145 to the decay amplitude , which is unlikely to be able to change our estimation eq.([ratio ] ) dramatically .    in our model , the parameters @xmath8 and @xmath146 will introduce additional uncertainties to @xmath20 decays .",
    "it is very unlikely that we could reproduce the experimental observations by fine tuning @xmath146 , because although a larger @xmath146 would lead to a smaller branching ratio for @xmath147 decay , it would also make the already too small branching ratio of @xmath148 decay even smaller .",
    "however a larger @xmath8 does help to close the gap between our predictions and the experimental data , due to the fact that a larger @xmath8 will lead to a significantly smaller branching ratio for @xmath149 decay while @xmath148 decay does not change much . of course we can not choose a too large @xmath8 , say larger than @xmath150 , because it is anyway a non perturbative parameter . as an illustration",
    ", we take @xmath151 and get @xmath152 although it seems to be on the right way , this effort alone is still not enough to accommodate the experimental data .",
    "let us take a closer look at the decay amplitudes . from table",
    "i , it is clear that the spectator hard scattering mechanism is dominant in @xmath17 decay and also very important for @xmath2 channel .",
    "furthermore there is significant destructive ( constructive ) interference between the twist-2 spectator term and the twist-3 one for @xmath148 ( @xmath149 ) mode .",
    "this is probably the reason that we get too small @xmath2 decay as well as too large @xmath3 decay in our model .",
    "notice that there are logarithmic and linear divergences appear in the spectator contributions , which are parameterized by eq .",
    "( [ endpoint ] ) .",
    "it is obviously a very rough model estimation and for example , strong phases effects are completely ignored .",
    "it is also reasonable to assume that the strong phase of twist-2 spectator term could be different from that of twist-3 part . as an illustration",
    ", the endpoint divergences could be parameterized as @xcite : @xmath153 with @xmath154 and the phase @xmath155 completely free . in the above equations",
    ", @xmath156 denotes the parameters for twist-2 spectator term and @xmath157 for twist-3 one . in this case , the interference effects and therefore the predictions of the branching ratios , could be changed dramatically .",
    "for example , if we take a somewhat extreme case @xmath158 with @xmath159 while keep all other input parameters fixed at their central values , we will get @xmath160 which are in good agreement with the experimental observations .",
    "certainly , due to the non perturbative nature of the above strong phases , there is strong model dependence of our predictions .",
    "therefore it is not so meaningful to fine tune the parameters to get the best fit of the experimental data .",
    "the key point here is that , different strong phases between twist-2 and twist-3 spectator terms might be able to account for the experimental hierarchy that @xmath161 is at least an order of magnitude larger than @xmath162 .",
    "the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite also studied the @xmath163 decay with the same qcdf method .",
    "but they used the gluon mass and gluon momentum cutoff , instead of binding energy adopted in this paper , to regularize the infrared divergences of the vertex corrections .",
    "another difference is that they calculated the spectator contributions directly from the original light - cone projector of k meson in coordinate space and got a different result from this paper .",
    "they claimed that the difference was due to the light - cone projector adopted in this paper which is inappropriate for @xmath164 channels : to get the projector eq.([projector ] ) from the original one in coordinate space @xcite , the integration by parts has been used and the boundary terms were dropped .",
    "however because of the linear singularities appeared in the above calculations , the boundary terms seem to be divergent and thus the justification of using the integration by parts is in doubt in this case .",
    "but beneke has elaborated on this subtle point in the appendix of ref . @xcite and it is shown there that the boundary terms are indeed zero provided the propagators are regularized carefully when they go close to the mass - shell",
    ". therefore the integration by parts can be used here and the light - cone projector adopted in this paper is justified .",
    "certainly , with a proper regularization , the calculation starting directly from the coordinate space projector should give the same results as this paper .",
    "most recently , the @xmath165 decay was discussed by using the pqcd method @xcite .",
    "notice that the vertex corrections were not included in their calculations , and the spectator contributions alone are enough in their paper to account for the experimental data .",
    "it would be very interesting to see whether they could also reproduce the very small branching ratio of @xmath149 channel observed by babar , which has not been done yet .",
    "the @xmath165 decay was also analyzed with light - cone sum rules @xcite . although there are some discrepancies in their papers , they agreed on the point that their results were too small to accommodate the experimental data .",
    "a large charmed meson rescattering effects @xmath166 could account for the surprisingly large @xmath165 decay@xcite , but generally it will also lead to a large branching ratio for @xmath149 mode .    in summary ,",
    "we discuss in this paper the vertex corrections and spectator hard scattering contributions to @xmath20 decays .",
    "since there is no model independent way yet to estimate the color - octet contribution to exclusive processes , it is no wonder that the vertex corrections here are infrared divergent .",
    "the non - zero binding energy @xmath167 makes the charm quark slightly off - shell inside @xmath47 , and effectively acts as a cut - off to regularize the vertex part .",
    "there are also less serious logarithmic and linear endpoint divergences which appears in the spectator contributions and are parameterized in a model - dependent way as usually done in charmless b decays .",
    "this means that the spectator diagrams are actually dominated by soft gluon exchange , which in a sense could be viewed as a model estimation of color - octet contributions .",
    "then our numerical analysis predicts the branching ratio of @xmath5 decay to be about @xmath168 , about four times smaller than the experimental observations , while for @xmath169 decay , we get @xmath170 , which is about five times larger than the experimental upper limit . but concerning the large theoretical uncertainties , it is more interesting to consider the ratio @xmath171 , in which a large part of the theoretical uncertainty can be eliminated",
    ". numerically we find the ratio to be @xmath172 , in sharp contrast to the experimental observation that this ratio should be about @xmath7 or even smaller , if the babar analysis of the upper limit of @xmath173 decay will be confirmed by farther measurements .",
    "we then have a closer look at the decay amplitudes .",
    "one observation is that , @xmath148 channel is not very sensitive to the spectator infrared cutoff parameter @xmath8 while a larger @xmath8 could reduce the branching ratio of @xmath149 decay significantly .",
    "another observation is that , in our model there is large destructive ( constructive ) interference between the twist-2 and twist-3 spectator terms for @xmath148 ( @xmath149 ) mode . but notice that the twist-2 spectator contributions contain only logarithmic endpoint divergence while twist-3 ones contain more severe linear endpoint divergence , it should be reasonable to assume that their strong phases could be quite different .",
    "since the interference effects are very sensitive to the strong phases difference , this might change our model predictions dramatically .",
    "as an illustration , we then show in an explicit case that , with a slightly larger @xmath8 and large strong phases difference between twist-2 and twist-3 spectator terms , our predictions are in good agreement with the experimental data .    in conclusion , what we have shown in this paper",
    ", is that by adjusting the parameters for the spectator hard scattering contributions , as with the annihilation terms for charmless @xmath89 decays , qcdf is able to produce appreciable non factorizable contributions to @xmath174 decays close to experiments , in contrast with the @xmath175 decay which needs a large factorizable contribution in addition to the small non factorizable one obtained in qcdf @xcite .",
