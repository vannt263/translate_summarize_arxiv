    "the realisation of quantum information processing in the laboratory requires quantum measurements of unprecedented speed and precision .",
    "in particular , the measurements that will be necessary for achieving scalable fault tolerant quantum computing are understood in some detail , requiring 99+% measurement fidelities , as well as the capability of repeating the same measurement very frequently within one coherence time ( @xmath0 ) @xcite . for the most part ,",
    "these measurements are to be used as part of a quantum error correction scheme , to give an accurate diagnosis of corrections that are needed to maintain quantum coherence in the computation .",
    "fundamentally these `` syndrome '' measurements detect the parity ( even or odd ) of a collection of computational qubits ; while special measurement schemes ( so - called direct parity measurements ) can be designed to access the particular multiqubit parities required @xcite , the quantum computation can be organised in such a way that single ancillary qubits hold the results of all necessary measurements . in the present study",
    "we will focus only on the improvement of this basic single - qubit measurement .",
    "we will also only focus here on the implementation of measurements in the setting of superconducting qubits within the paradigm of circuit quantum electrodynamics @xcite ( cqed ) .",
    "cqed techniques have contributed greatly to the quality of all aspects of quantum circuit implementation , measurement among them .",
    "single - qubit measurements were achieved before the advent of cqed  a squid magnetometer strongly coupled to the qubit to be measured was biased to the edge of stability , so that it would switch to its normal state in a qubit - state dependent way .",
    "this approach , while a great milestone in establishing the possibility of quantum computation in superconducting device systems , was unscalable , slow , very intrusive ( i.e. , far from quantum non - demolition ( qnd ) ) , and also far from single - shot ( fidelity @xmath1 far below 100% ) .    with the advent of cqed ,",
    "qubits with much longer coherence times have become available , and new , engineered forms of light - matter coupling have opened the possibility of higher quality measurements performed within the coherence times of the qubit .",
    "the transmon qubit coupled to a high quality factor cavity realizes the jaynes - cummings model of atomic physics @xcite . when the qubit transition frequency is off - resonance with respect to the cavity eigenmode frequency ( `` dispersive regime '' ) , this cavity frequency is shifted by an amount dependent on the qubit state .",
    "probe radiation near this resonant frequency , transmitted or reflected from the cavity , acquires a phase shift @xmath2 or @xmath3 for qubit state @xmath4 or @xmath5 .",
    "the sensing of this phase shift accomplishes the quantum measurement , which will be qnd so long as the probe radiation is weak enough that the conditions for the dispersive approximation for the jaynes - cummings model are met",
    ". this condition will be an important constraint in the analysis that we give below ; it is understood that `` high - power '' readout , involving the full nonlinearity of the jaynes - cummings model , can also give an effective ( but non - qnd ) measurement @xcite .    while it is not difficult to make the phase shift change large  even @xmath6 is achievable  the necessity for a weak probe means that the probe signal must be amplified before being mixed with a reference beam .",
    "fortunately , a reasonable amplifier in the necessary microwave band , the so called hemt ( `` high electron mobility transistor '' ) has been available for low - temperature use , and has enabled qubits measurements near the single - shot regime @xcite .",
    "the hemt remains essential in measurements up to the present , but it is far from ideal : its noise temperature around 10k prevents the achievement of genuinely high fidelity ( @xmath7 ) quantum measurements .",
    "it was understood that , to go further , new types of superconducting devices would be needed to push the amplifier noise temperature into the desired millikelvin regime .",
    "while the use of squids for low - noise amplifiers have been understood for a long time @xcite , the adoption of these devices in cqed setups , and the form of the amplifier used , has undergone steady evolution in recent years .",
    "first , so - called `` bifurcation '' phenomena in modified qubits were used for initial amplification @xcite . from this work",
    "it was realised that further modifications of these devices would permit them to be used in parametric mode @xcite : the nonlinearity is used so that the device works as a linear but time - dependent circuit element .",
    "practical devices were made @xcite and optimised in conjunction with extensive theoretical analysis @xcite .",
    "these superconducting parametric amplifiers , operating very close to minimal noise temperatures , are now in use in many labs worldwide , with achievement of 99% measurement fidelities now in sight .",
    "parametric devices have other functionalities besides amplification ; they are also capable of producing squeezed radiation , which can be another tool in improving the noise performance of qubit systems .",
    "recently an experiment has been reported @xcite in which squeezed radiation improves the coherence time of a transmon qubit .",
    "note that this involves having the probe radiation interacting with the parametric device _ before _ encountering the qubit - containing cavity ",
    "when used as an amplifier , the parametric device comes _ after _ the probe has exited the cavity .    in this paper",
    "we explore the benefit gained from combining both , placing parametric devices _ both before and after _ the phase shifting element ( qubit+cavity ) .",
    "such concepts were already explored in the pioneering work of yurke and co - workers @xcite , who considered the possibility of such `` active '' interferometers , where the simple beamsplitters are replaced by active devices , both for optical and microwave systems .",
    "this work defined the so - called `` su(1,1 ) '' amplifiers , which we will describe and study in the present work @xcite .    to see how the su(1,1 )",
    "paradigm can be used to further improve qubit measurement , we will need to modify yurke s approach to account for three aspects of the cqed setup : 1 ) phase shifts are not small , 2 ) probe radiation inside the cavity should be weak , 3 ) probe pulses @xmath8 should be of short duration , perhaps comparable to the inverse cavity linewidth @xmath9 . we will visit all these issues in the studies in this paper , showing improvements are indeed possible .    in @xcite two types of su(1,1 ) interferometers were defined for which it was shown that they would give rise to a phase sensitivity @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the total number of photons that pass through the interferometer : these interferometers are depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : su11](a ) and ( d ) . in these set - ups",
    "one measures the total number of outgoing photons @xmath12 so that @xmath13 here @xmath14 for an arbitrary operator or random variable @xmath15 .",
    "such scaling with @xmath11 is usually referred to as ` reaching the heisenberg limit ' in contrast with the shot - noise limit @xmath16 which is reached by using a coherent state @xmath17 with average photon number @xmath18 to determine the unknown phase shift , see e.g. @xcite and @xcite and references therein .",
    "it is important to note that the enhanced phase - sensitivity is only reached for small phases @xmath19 ; in addition in the schemes in @xcite the input modes are taken to be in the vacuum state .",
    "while the su(1,1 ) interferometer is a way of obtaining a high sensitivity to an unknown phase shift , it does not immediately suit the experimental cqed setting for the following reasons . in the measurement chain for superconducting ( transmon ) qubits",
    "coupled to microwave cavities , the information - carrying signal is a microwave pulse which is amplified to a classical stochastic signal whose quadratures are recorded as classical voltages , see section [ sec : mm ] .",
    "this means that one does not measure the number of output photons of the interferometer , but rather the quadrature of one or both outgoing modes . by the linear optical transformation of the interferometer",
    ", any outgoing quadrature can be expressed as a linear function of the quadratures of the input modes .",
    "this means that the phase sensitivity of such quadratures is 0 when the input modes are prepared in the vacuum state and hence the quadrature signal carries no phase information  @xcite .",
    "the simplest modification to this set - up is to provide the interferometer with a pulsed coherent microwave at one of its inputs , say , the mode @xmath20 in fig .",
    "( [ fig : su11 ] ) , which is what we will assume .",
    "we thus re - examine the phase sensitivity of the su(1,1 ) interferometers under a homodyne measurement in section [ sec : schemes ] ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "there are further features of the experimental set - up that we take into account ; as mentioned above , the number of photons in the top arm of the interferometer should be bounded below a critical value in order for the measurement to be of non - demolition character .",
    "the number of photons coming out of the last pa or dpa in fig .",
    "[ fig : su11 ] should be sufficiently high so that further amplifications have a small effect .",
    "thirdly , we wish the quantum measurement to be short : the finite time duration of the incoming pulse , @xmath21 motivates the multi - frequency mode analysis in section [ sec : mm ] and [ sec : num_wig ] .",
    "one reason to consider an su(1,1 ) interferometer instead of a su(2 ) mach - zehnder interferometer is that the attenuated microwave probe will have to undergo amplification anyhow in order to be detectable with current hardware ; in this way the second amplifier in the interferometer does double duty ( see however @xcite for a preliminary exploration of the mach - zehnder interferometer ) .",
    "it also means that the experimental set - up of the interferometer is not much more costly than the standard homodyne measurement in which typically only one josephson - based amplifier is used , see fig .",
    "[ fig : su11](c ) .",
    "we will find that the two - mode su(1,1 ) interferometer which uses two non - degenerate parametric amplifiers , fig .",
    "[ fig : su11](a ) , gives better results than a single - mode su(1,1 ) interferometer , fig .",
    "[ fig : su11](d ) , see section [ sec : num_wig ] : our proposed experimental setup is depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : expsu11 ] .",
    "we note that in @xcite the position of a nanomechanical oscillator , coupled to a microwave cavity , was measured in a ` mach - zehner interferometric setup ' .",
    "however , in that experimental set - up the signals from both arms of the interferometer are only recombined at room temperature allowing no entanglement between the arms of the interferometer . in our envisioned scheme",
    "the entire interferometer is realized at low temperature ( e.g. @xmath22mk ) . in @xcite",
    "the authors used two non - degenerate josephson parametric amplifiers ( ` josephson mixers ' ) to create a two - mode squeezed state which was subsequently analyzed by a second josephson mixer : this set - up thus uses identical components as the su(1,1 ) interferometer in fig .",
    "[ fig : su11 ] and shows that our proposal is experimentally feasible .",
    "+ in the next section we will consider the four schemes in fig .  [ fig : su11 ] with coherent state inputs and quadrature measurement on the mode @xmath23 or @xmath24 at the end .",
    "we assume the state of the qubit induces a phase shift @xmath25 onto the passing probe ( how it does this , is reviewed and analyzed in section [ sec : mm ] ) . instead of focusing on the phase sensitivity ,",
    "we derive expressions for the signal - to - noise ratio snr , first assuming a simplified single - mode , single - frequency picture .",
    "this gives us insight in the gains that we can expect when we include the multi - mode nature of the input probe later on , in sections [ sec : mm ] and [ sec : num_wig ] .",
    "we focus on the snr as we do not expect @xmath26 to be necessarily small , nor do we analyze the use of feedback in these schemes , but see sec .",
    "[ last ] ( discussion ) .",
    "let @xmath27 be any information - carrying quadrature and suppose that @xmath28 ( we will restrict ourselves to such scenarios ) .",
    "the signal - to - noise ratio is then given by @xmath29 this signal - to - noise ratio can be simply related to the probability of error of the quantum measurement , see section [ sec : error ] .",
    "the action of an ideal phase - insensitive ( also called ` phase - preserving ' ) non - degenerate parametric amplifier ( pa ) , acting on four ports each of which is described by a continuum of modes labelled by frequency , is given @xcite by the following transformation @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the frequency of the pump mode of the amplifier .",
    "the mode @xmath32 functions as the ` idler ' mode and @xmath33 as the ` signal ' mode .",
    "this transformation models a four - wave mixer in which 2 pump photons at frequency @xmath31 are converted into one photon for mode 1 and one for mode 2 , i.e. @xmath34 . replacing @xmath35 by @xmath31 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : pa ] ) would correspond to a three - wave mixer with @xmath36 .",
    "such a phase - insensitive non - degenerate pa amplifies both quadratures by the same amount , with a gain related to the real parameter @xmath37 by @xmath38 and this pa will always add a non - zero amount of noise @xcite .",
    "a good example of such an amplifier is the josephson ring modulator @xcite used in the transmon qubit measurement in @xcite .",

    "very good phase - sensitive josephson parametric amplifiers have been developed in @xcite ; for such amplifiers the dominant source of noise at the output of the amplifier is the quantum fluctuations of the ingoing weak signal . for both phase - sensitive and phase - insensitive amplifiers we assume that the phase @xmath42 and gain @xmath43 are independent of frequency @xmath44 .",
