    "<S> the annihilation effect sets in , and the final asymmetry is strongly suppressed compared to the value one would obtain by extrapolating the curve with the slope for @xmath163 gev .    when the trilinear coupling is larger than the triplet mass , @xmath164 1 , besides an enhancement of the cp  violating term of eq.([epspm ] ) , one could expect that the additional contribution to the coupling of the triplet particles to scalar final states enhances the total annihilation rate , increasing substantially the value of the parameter @xmath147 compared to the amount given by eq .  </S>",

    "<S> , the consequent additional wash  out effect could in principle suppress the ensuing lepton asymmetry . </S>",
    "<S> however , this is not the case due to the fact that , as we have already discussed , the annihilation process freezes out later than inverse decays , so the latter play almost no role in the determination of the epoch when lepton asymmetry production can start . </S>",
    "<S> actually , this epoch starts when decays eventually overcome annihilations , so a higher value of @xmath147 can slightly anticipate it , leading so to a higher asymmetry instead than a suppression , although this effect is quite mild . </S>",

    "<S> we also remark that sphaleron interactions are kept in thermal equilibrium even after the electroweak phase transition and freeze out around @xmath168 gev , so that only the lepton asymmetry produced for @xmath169 can be efficiently converted into a baryon asymmetry @xcite . as shown in fig .  </S>",

    "<S> [ fig6_last ] , the cp  violating contribution from the soft supersymmetry breaking term @xmath174 in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : lepton_asym ] ) can strongly enhance the final lepton asymmetry at low values of @xmath79 . as a result , </S>",
    "<S> it is evident that the required baryon asymmetry can be reached whenever @xmath175 and @xmath79 are in the multi - tev region .    before concluding our work , </S>",
    "<S> let us remark some experimental consequences of the model at future colliders . as shown above </S>",
    "<S> , successful baryogenesis requires a tev - scale triplet mass and yukawa couplings of the same order , @xmath176 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , all the low - energy lepton flavor violating processes like @xmath177 or @xmath178 are highly suppressed @xcite . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> future accelerators have a potential to produce such higgs triplets , in particular , the peculiar doubly charged component through the drell - yan processes @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> then , various features of the model can be checked by observing the branching ratios of the triplet decay to lepton and higgsino pairs , in particular , @xmath179 , allowing also to study neutrino mass patterns @xcite .    in conclusion , we have investigated baryogenesis assuming the minimal supersymmetric higgs triplet model as the origin of neutrino masses and mixings . </S>",
    "<S> this model , with only one pair of triplets , can provide a mechanism for soft leptogenesis employing a cp violating phase and a resonant behavior in the supersymmetry breaking sector . </S>",
    "<S> our analysis shows that the original soft leptogenesis , relying on the supersymmetry breaking effect proportional to the small difference between boson and fermion statistics at finite temperature can not produce the right amount of baryon asymmetry due to the gauge annihilation effect . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we have calculated the full gauge  annihilation cross section including all the relevant supersymmetric intermediate and final states , as well as coannihilations with the fermionic superpartners of the triplets , finding that this effect strongly suppresses the resulting lepton asymmetry . on the other hand </S>",
    "<S> , the contribution of soft supersymmetry breaking terms , particularly a sizable value for the @xmath67 parameter , can enhance the lepton asymmetry to provide successful leptogenesis if the triplet mass is in the tev range . in this case </S>",
    "<S> , the model predictions can be tested in future colliders by searching for a very clean signal , e.g. , from the production and decay of doubly charged higgs bosons . </S>"
