    "we are concerned with the problems of shock reflection by wedges .",

    "when a plane shock hits a wedge head on , it experiences a reflection - diffraction process and then a self - similar reflected shock moves outward as the original shock moves forward in time .",
    "the complexity of reflection picture was first reported by ernst mach @xcite in 1878 , and experimental , computational , and asymptotic analysis has shown that various patterns of shock reflection may occur , including regular and mach reflection ( cf .",
    "however , most of the fundamental issues for shock reflection have not been understood , including the global structure , stability , and transition of the different patterns of shock reflection .",
    "therefore , it is essential to establish the global existence and structural stability of solutions of shock reflection in order to understand fully the phenomena of shock reflection . on the other hand ,",
    "there has been no rigorous mathematical result on the global existence and structural stability of shock reflection , including the case of potential flow which is widely used in aerodynamics ( cf .",
    "one of the main reasons is that the problems involve several challenging difficulties in the analysis of nonlinear partial differential equations such as mixed equations of elliptic - hyperbolic type , free boundary problems , and corner singularity where an elliptic degenerate curve meets a free boundary . in this paper",
    "we develop a rigorous mathematical approach to overcome these difficulties involved and establish a global theory of existence and stability for shock reflection by large - angle wedges for potential flow .",
    "the techniques and ideas developed here will be useful for other nonlinear problems involving similar difficulties .",
    "the euler equations for potential flow consist of the conservation law of mass and the bernoulli law for the density @xmath0 and velocity potential @xmath1 : @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the bernoulli constant determined by the incoming flow and/or boundary conditions , and @xmath4 with @xmath5 being the sound speed . for polytropic gas , @xmath6 without loss of generality , we choose @xmath7 so that @xmath8 which can be achieved by the following scaling : @xmath9 equations  can written as the following nonlinear equation of second order : @xmath10 where @xmath11 for @xmath12 .",
    "when a plane shock in the @xmath13coordinates , @xmath14 , with left state @xmath15 and right state @xmath16 , hits a symmetric wedge @xmath17 head on , it experiences a reflection - diffraction process , and the reflection problem can be formulated as the following mathematical problem .    .",

    "the discontinuity @xmath49 of @xmath38 is called a shock if @xmath46 further satisfies the physical entropy condition that the corresponding density function @xmath51 increases across @xmath49 in the pseudo - flow direction .",
    "we remark that the rankine - hugoniot condition with the continuity of @xmath46 across a shock for is also fairly good approximation to the corresponding rankine - hugoniot conditions for the full euler equations for shocks of small strength , since the errors are third - order in strength of the shock .",

    "we develop a rigorous mathematical approach to extend the local theory to a global theory for solutions of regular shock reflection , which converge to the unique solution of the normal shock reflection when @xmath81 tends to @xmath68 .",
    "the solution @xmath46 is pseudo - subsonic within the sonic circle for state ( 2 ) with center @xmath82 and radius @xmath83 ( the sonic speed ) and is pseudo - supersonic outside this circle containing the arc @xmath84 in fig .",

    "then the solution of problem 2 can be shown to be the solution of problem 1 .",
    "there exist @xmath91 and @xmath92 such that , when @xmath93 , there exists a global self - similar solution @xmath94 with @xmath95 of problem 1 ( equivalently , problem 2 ) for shock reflection by the wedge , which satisfies that , for @xmath96 , @xmath97 @xmath98 @xmath46 is @xmath99 across the part @xmath84 of the sonic circle including the endpoints @xmath100 and @xmath101 , and the reflected shock @xmath73 is @xmath102 at @xmath100 and @xmath103 except @xmath100 .",
    "moreover , the solution @xmath46 is stable with respect to the wedge angle in @xmath104 and converges in @xmath105 to the solution of the normal reflection described in  [ section:4 ] as @xmath106 .",
    "one of the main difficulties for the global existence is that the ellipticity condition for ( [ 1.1.5 ] ) is hard to control , in comparison to our earlier work on steady flow @xcite .",
    "the second difficulty is that the ellipticity degenerates at the sonic circle @xmath84 ( the boundary of the pseudo - subsonic flow ) .",
    "the third difficulty is that , on @xmath84 , we need to match the solution in @xmath45 with @xmath85 at least in @xmath43 , that is , the two conditions on the fixed boundary @xmath84 : the dirichlet and conormal conditions , which are generically overdetermined for an elliptic equation since the conditions on the other parts of boundary have been prescribed .",
    "thus we have to prove that , if @xmath46 satisfies ( [ 1.1.5 ] ) in @xmath45 , the dirichlet continuity condition on the sonic circle , and the appropriate conditions on the other parts of @xmath107 derived from problem 2 , then the normal derivative @xmath108 automatically matches with @xmath109 along @xmath84 .",
    "we show that , in fact , this follows from the structure of elliptic degeneracy of ( [ 1.1.5 ] ) on @xmath84 for the solution @xmath46 .",
    "indeed , equation ( [ 1.1.5 ] ) , written in terms of the function @xmath110 in the @xmath111coordinates defined near @xmath84 such that @xmath84 becomes a segment on @xmath112 , has the form : @xmath113 plus the `` small '' terms that are controlled by @xmath114 in appropriate norms .",
    "equation is elliptic if @xmath115 .",
    "thus , we need to obtain the @xmath99 estimates near @xmath84 to ensure @xmath116 which in turn implies both the ellipticity of the equation in @xmath45 and the match of normal derivatives @xmath117 along @xmath84 . taking into account the `` small '' terms to be added to equation",
    ", we need to make the stronger estimate @xmath118 and assume that @xmath114 is appropriately small to control these additional terms .",
    "another issue is the non - variational structure and nonlinearity of this problem which makes it hard to apply directly the approaches of caffarelli @xcite and alt - caffarelli - friedman @xcite .",
    "moreover , the elliptic degeneracy and geometry of the problem makes it difficult to apply the hodograph transform approach in kinderlehrer - nirenberg @xcite and chen - feldman @xcite to fix the free boundary .    for these reasons ,",
    "one of the new ingredients in our approach is to further develop the iteration scheme in @xcite to a partially modified equation .",
    "we modify equation ( [ 1.1.5 ] ) in @xmath45 by a proper cutoff that depends on the distance to the sonic circle , so that the original and modified equations coincide for @xmath46 satisfying @xmath119 , and the modified equation @xmath120 is elliptic in @xmath45 with elliptic degeneracy on @xmath84",
    ". then we solve a free boundary problem for this modified equation : the free boundary is the curve @xmath89 , and the free boundary conditions on @xmath89 are @xmath121 and the rankine - hugoniot condition ( [ fbconditionselfsim-0 ] ) .    on each step , an `` iteration free boundary '' curve @xmath89",
    "is given , and a solution of the modified equation @xmath120 is constructed in @xmath45 with the boundary condition ( [ fbconditionselfsim-0 ] ) on @xmath89 , the dirichlet condition @xmath122 on the degenerate circle @xmath84 , and @xmath123 on @xmath88 and @xmath124 . then we prove that @xmath46 is in fact @xmath99 up to the boundary @xmath84 , especially @xmath125 , by using the nonlinear structure of elliptic degeneracy near @xmath84 which is modeled by equation ( [ degenerate - equation ] ) and a scaling technique similar to daskalopoulos - hamilton @xcite and lin - wang @xcite .",
    "furthermore , we modify the `` iteration free boundary '' curve @xmath89 by using the dirichlet condition @xmath121 on @xmath89",
    ". a fixed point @xmath46 of this iteration procedure is a solution of the free boundary problem for the modified equation .",
    "moreover , we prove the precise gradient estimate : @xmath126 , which implies that @xmath46 satisfies the original equation ( [ 1.1.5 ] ) .",
    "some efforts have been made mathematically for the reflection problem via simplified models .",
    "one of these models , the unsteady transonic small - disturbance ( utsd ) equation , was derived and used in keller - blank @xcite , hunter - keller @xcite , hunter @xcite , morawetz @xcite , and the references cited therein for asymptotic analysis of shock reflection . also see zheng @xcite for the pressure gradient equation and canic - keyfitz - kim @xcite for the utsd equation and the nonlinear wave system . on the other hand , in order to deal with the reflection problem , some asymptotic methods have been also developed .",
    "lighthill @xcite studied shock reflection under the assumption that the wedge angle is either very small or close to @xmath68 .",
    "keller - blank @xcite , hunter - keller @xcite , and harabetian @xcite considered the problem under the assumption that the shock is so weak that its motion can be approximated by an acoustic wave . for a weak incident shock and a wedge with small angle in the context of potential flow , by taking the jump of the incident shock as a small parameter ,",
    "the nature of the shock reflection pattern was explored in morawetz @xcite by a number of different scalings , a study of mixed equations , and matching the asymptotics for the different scalings .",
    "also see chen @xcite for a linear approximation of shock reflection when the wedge angle is close to @xmath68 and serre @xcite for an apriori analysis of solutions of shock reflection and related discussions in the context of the euler equations for isentropic and adiabatic fluids .",
    "the organization of this paper is the following . in  2 , we present the potential flow equation in self - similar coordinates and exhibit some basic properties of solutions to the potential flow equation . in ",
    "3 , we discuss the normal reflection solution and then follow the von neumann criterion to derive the necessary condition for the existence of regular reflection and show that the shock reflection can be regular locally when the wedge angle is large . in  4 , the shock reflection problem is reformulated and reduced to a free boundary problem for a second - order nonlinear equation of mixed type in a convenient form . in  5",
    ", we develop an iteration scheme , along with an elliptic cutoff technique , to solve the free boundary problem and set up the ten detailed steps of the iteration procedure .    finally , we complete the remaining steps in our iteration procedure in ",
    "69 : step 2 for the existence of solutions of the boundary value problem to the degenerate elliptic equation via the vanishing viscosity approximation in  6 ; steps 38 for the existence of the iteration map and its fixed point in  7 ; and step 9 for the removal of the ellipticity cutoff in the iteration scheme by using appropriate comparison functions and deriving careful global estimates for some directional derivatives of the solution in  8 .",
    "we complete the proof of main theorem in  9 .",
    "careful estimates of the solutions to both the  almost tangential derivative \" and oblique derivative boundary value problems for elliptic equations are made in appendix , which are applied in ",
    "in this section we present the potential flow equation in self - similar coordinates and exhibit some basic properties of solutions of the potential flow equation ( also see morawetz @xcite ) .",
