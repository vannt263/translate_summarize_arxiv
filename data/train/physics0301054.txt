    "@xmath0 the fuller nearside - farside ( nf ) theory of elastic angular scattering has been used for more than 25 years to understand structure in the differential cross sections of nucleus - nucleus collisions .",
    "@xcite more recently , it has been demonstrated that an extended nf theory is a powerful tool for analysing structure in the angular scattering of elastic , inelastic and reactive atom - molecule collisions .",
    "@xcite    @xmath0one advantage of nf theory is that the nf decomposition of the partial wave series ( pws ) representation for the scattering amplitude is exact .",
    "however , this exactness is no guarantee that the nf procedure will always yield a physically meaningful explanation of structure in a differential cross section .",
    "an example is elastic scattering in a strongly absorptive collision .",
    "@xcite it has been shown in refs .",
    "15 and 16 that the failure of the nf method for this type of collision can be overcome by resumming the pws before applying the nf decomposition .",
    "the effect of the resummation is to extract from the pws the factor @xmath8 where @xmath9 and @xmath10 is the scattering angle .",
    "@xcite    @xmath0the purpose of this paper is to further develop ( and apply ) resummation theory for a pws which is expanded in a basis set of legendre polynomials . in order to motivate our development ,",
    "we first consider in section ii a strongly absorptive elastic collision using a simple parameterized scattering matrix element .",
    "we discuss an example where extracting the factor @xmath8 results in physically unrealistic n and f cross sections .",
    "we show for this example that the correct factor to remove from the pws is @xmath11 .",
    "these considerations suggest that we must extend our earlier work @xcite and resum a legendre pws in which the more general factor @xmath12 is extracted , where @xmath3 and @xmath4 are constants .",
    "this is done in section iii , where we also discuss properties of the resummed pws .",
    "we apply our resummation theory in section iv to analyse structure in the differential cross section of the state selected chemical reaction @xcite @xmath13 where @xmath14 and @xmath15 are initial and final vibrational and rotational quantum numbers respectively .",

    "@xmath0this section reports and discusses pws , n and f differential cross sections for a strongly absorptive elastic collision . in particular , we examine how the n and f cross sections change when the factor @xmath12 , with @xmath9 is removed from the pws for two special cases : @xmath16 and @xmath17 .      @xmath0we use a simple two parameter analytic expression for the scattering matrix element , @xmath18 , namely @xcite    @xmath19 \\ } ^{-1 } + \\ { 1 + \\exp \\left [ \\frac{\\lambda + \\left(j + \\frac{1}{2}\\right)}{\\delta } \\right ] \\ } ^{-1 } , \\:\\:\\:\\:\\:j = 0,1,2, ... \\ ] ]    where @xmath20 is the total (= orbital for this case ) angular momentum quantum number , @xmath21 locates the absorbing surface in @xmath20 space and @xmath22 measures the width of the surface region .",
