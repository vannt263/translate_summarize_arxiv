    "thermal degradation and stabilization of polymer systems has been a long - standing focus of research from both practical and fundamental viewpoints @xcite .",
    "plastic waste disposal has grown rapidly to ecological menace prompting researchers to investigate plastic recycling by degradation as an alternative @xcite . on the other hand , degradation of polymers and other high molecular weight materials in different environments",
    "is usually a major limiting factor in their application . thermal degradation ( or , _ thermolysis _ ) plays a decisive role in the design of flame - resistant polyethylene and other plastic materials @xcite .",
    "another interesting aspects for applications include reversible polymer networks @xcite , and most notably , graphene , as a  material of the future  that shows unusual thermomechanical properties @xcite .",
    "recently , with the rapidly growing perspective of exploiting bio - polymers as functional materials @xcite , the stability of such materials has become an issue of primary concern @xcite as , e.g. , that of double - stranded polymer decomposition @xcite .    most theoretical investigations of polymer degradation have focused on determining the rate of change of average molecular weight @xcite .",
    "the main assumptions of the theory are that each link in a long chain molecule has equal strength and equal accessibility , that they are broken at random , and that the probability of rupture is proportional to the number of links present .",
    "therefore , all of the afore - mentioned studies investigate exclusively the way in which the distribution of bond rupture probability along the polymer backbone affects the fragmentation kinetics and the distribution of fragment sizes as time elapses . in a recent study @xcite , using molecular dynamics ( md ) simulation with a langevin thermostat , we observed a rather complex interplay between the polymer chain dynamics and the resulting bond rupture probability .",
    "a major role in this was attributed to the one - dimensional ( 1d ) topological connectivity of the linear polymer .",
    "significant change in rupture kinetics is observed while polymer architecture is tuned as in the case of thermolysis of adsorbed bottle - brushes @xcite .",
    "understanding the interplay between elastic and fracture properties is even more challenging and important in the case of 2d polymerized networks ( elastic - brittle sheets ) .",
    "a prominent example of biological microstructure is _ spectrin _ , the red blood cell membrane skeleton , which reinforces the cytoplasmic face of the membrane . in erythrocytes , the membrane skeleton enables it to undergo large extensional deformations while maintaining the structural integrity of the membrane .",
    "a number of studies , based on continuum- @xcite , percolation- @xcite , or molecular level @xcite considerations of the mechanical breakdown of this network , modeled as a triangular lattice of spectrin tetramers , have been reported so far .",
    "another example concerns the thermal stability of isolated graphene nanoflakes .",
    "it has been investigated recently by barnard and snook @xcite using _ ab initio _ quantum mechanical techniques whereby it was noted that the problems `` has been overlooked by most computational and theoretical studies '' .",
    "many of these studies can be viewed in a broader context as part of the problem of thermal decomposition of gels @xcite , epoxy resins @xcite and other 3d networks , studied both experimentally @xcite , and by means of simulations @xcite as in the case of poly - dimethylsiloxane ( pdms ) . in most of these cases , however , mainly a stability analysis is carried out whereas still little is known regarding the collective mechanism of degradation , the dependence of rupture time on system size , as well as the decomposition kinetics , especially as far as ( 2d ) polymer network sheets are concerned .",
    "it is also interesting from the standpoint of basic physics to compare the degradation process to the one taking place in linear polymers where considerable progress has been achieved recently @xcite .",
    "therefore , in the present work we extend our investigations to the case of ( 2d ) polymer network sheets , embedded in 3d - space , and study as a generic example the thermal degradation of a suspended membrane with honeycomb orientation .    the paper is organized as follows : after a brief introduction , we sketch our model in sec .",

[ subsec_tau ] , and the temporal evolution of the fragmentation process - sec .  [ subsec_fragment ] .",
    "we also develop a theoretical scheme based on a set of @xmath7order kinetic differential equations , describing the time variation of the number of network nodes , connected by a particular number of bonds to neighboring nodes - sec .",

    "we study a coarse - grained model of honeycomb membrane embedded in three - dimensional ( 3d ) space . in this investigation",
    "we consider generally _ symmetric _ hexagonal membranes ( _ flakes _ ) ( fig .  [ fig_modelmembrane ] ) . in a very few cases we also discuss fracture of a _ ribbon _ shape membranes .",
    "the membrane flake consists of @xmath1 spherical particles ( beads , monomers ) of diameter @xmath8 connected in a honeycomb lattice structure whereby each monomer is bonded with three nearest - neighbors except of the monomers on the membrane edges which have only two bonds ( see fig .

    "the total number of circles @xmath14 in the membrane of linear size @xmath10 is found to be @xmath16 .",
    "we use this example of dividing the beads and the bonds composing the membrane in order to represent our simulation results in appropriate way which relates them to their relative proximity to membrane s periphery .",
    "the nearest - neighbors in the membrane are connected to each other by `` breakable bonds '' described by a morse potential , where @xmath17 is a distance between the monomers , @xmath18 \\rbrace ^{2 } \\label{eq_u_morse}\\ ] ] @xmath19 is a constant that determines bond elasticity and @xmath20 is the equilibrium bond length .",

    "the maximal restoring force of the morse potential , @xmath25 , is reached at the inflection point , @xmath26 .",
    "this force @xmath27 determines the maximal tensile strength of the membrane .",
    "stretching of the bond beyond @xmath28 means potentially a scission of that bond as far as the restoring force declines rapidly with bond length even though there is a chance for a recombination .",
    "therefore we take as a criterion for breaking a bond its expansion to @xmath29 beyond which practically a bond recombinantion is ruled out . since @xmath30 , the morse potential , eq .",
    "( [ eq_u_morse ] ) , is only weakly repulsive and beads could partially penetrate one another at @xmath31 .",
    "therefore , in order to allow properly for the excluded volume interactions between bonded monomers , we take the bond potential as a sum of @xmath32 and the so called weeks - chandler - anderson ( wca ) potential , @xmath33 , ( i.e. , the shifted and truncated repulsive branch of the lennard - jones potential ) , @xmath34 + \\epsilon ,   & \\text{for}~~ r \\leq 2^{1/6}\\sigma \\\\ 0 ,   & \\text{for}~~ r > 2^{1/6}\\sigma \\end{cases } \\label{aaa}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with parameter @xmath35 and monomer diameter @xmath36 so that the minimum of the wca potential coincides with the minimum of the morse potential .",
    "thus , the length scale is set by the parameter @xmath37 .",
    "the nonbonded interactions between monomers are taken into account by means of the wca potential , eq .",
    "( [ aaa ] ) . the nonbonded interactions in our model correspond to good solvent conditions whereas the bonded interactions make the bonds in our model breakable so they undergo scission at sufficiently high @xmath3 .",
    "we have been anxious to emphasize the common features of failure in materials with similar architecture but largely varying elasticity properties , e.g. , from @xmath38  gpa graphene s young modulus @xcite compared to @xmath39  gpa for spectrin @xcite .",
    "putting the value of a kuhn segment to @xmath40    and taking the thermal energy @xmath41  j at @xmath42  k , we get from our simulation @xcite a young modulus @xmath43  gpa which is ranged between typical values for rubber - like materials @xmath44@xmath45  gpa .",
    "in our md simulation we use langevin dynamics , which describes the brownian motion of a set of interacting particles whereby the action of the solvent is split into slowly evolving viscous ( frictional ) force and a rapidly fluctuating stochastic ( random ) force .",
    "the langevin equation of motion is the following : @xmath46 where @xmath47 denotes the mass of the particles which is set to @xmath48 , @xmath49 is the velocity of particle @xmath50 , @xmath51 is the conservative force which is a sum of all forces exerted on particle @xmath50 by other particles in the system , @xmath52 is the friction coefficient and @xmath53 is the three dimensional vector of random force acting on particle @xmath50 .",
    "the random force @xmath53 , which represents the incessant collision of the monomers with the solvent molecules , satisfies the fluctuation - dissipation theorem @xmath54 where the symbol @xmath55 denotes an equilibrium average and the greek - letter subscripts refer to the @xmath56 , @xmath57 or @xmath58 components .",
    "the friction coefficient @xmath52 of the langevin thermostat is generally set to @xmath59 and only in very few cases to @xmath60 .",
    "the integration step is @xmath61 time units ( t.u . ) and the time is measured in units of @xmath62 .",
    "we emphasize at this point that in our coarse - grained modeling no explicit solvent particles are included . in this work",
    "the velocity - verlet algorithm is used to integrate the equations of motion .",
    "our md simulations are carried out in the following order .",
    "first , we prepare an equilibrated membrane conformation , starting with a fully flat configuration shown schematically in fig .",
    "[ fig_modelmembrane ] , where each bead in the network is separated by a distance @xmath63 equal to the equilibrium separation of the bond potential @xmath64 [ see eq .",
    "( [ eq_u_morse ] ) , and eq .  ( [ aaa ] ) ] .",
    "then we start the simulation with this prepared conformation and let the membrane equilibrate in the heat bath for a very long period of time ( @xmath65 integration steps ) at a temperature low enough that the membrane stays intact , fig .",
    "[ fig_equilmembrane ] , ( this equilibration is done in order to prepare different starting conformations for each simulation ) .",
    "then the temperature is raised to the working temperature and the membrane is equilibrated for 20 md t.u .",
    "( @xmath66 integration steps ) which interval was found as sufficient to establish equipartition ( uniform distribution of the temperature throughout the membrane ) .",
    "containing @xmath67 monomers after equilibration .",
    "characteristic ripples are seen to cross the surface .",
    "[ fig_equilmembrane ] ]    the time then is set to zero and we continue the simulation of this membrane conformation to examine the thermal scission of the bonds .",
    "we measure the elapsed time @xmath0 until the first bond rupture occurs and repeat the above procedure for a large number of events ( @xmath68@xmath66 ) so as to sample the stochastic nature of rupture and to determine the mean @xmath69 which we refer to as the mean first breakage time .",
    "in the course of simulation we also calculate properties such as the probability distribution of breaking bonds regarding their position in the membrane ( a rupture probability histogram ) , the probability distribution of the first breakage time @xmath70 , the mean extension of the bonds with respect to the consecutive circle number in the membrane , as well as other quantities of interest .    since in the problem of thermal degradation there is no external force acting on the membrane edges , a well - defined activation barrier for a bond scission is actually missing , in contrast to the case of applied tensile force .",
    "therefore , a definition of an unambiguous criterion for bond breakage is not self - evident .",
    "moreover , depending on the degree of stretching , bonds may break and then recombine again .",
    "therefore , in our numeric experiments we use a sufficiently large value for critical extension of the bonds , @xmath71 , which is defined as a threshold to a broken state of the bond .",
    "this convention is based on our checks that the probability for recombination ( self - healing ) of bonds , stretched beyond @xmath72 , is sufficiently small , @xmath73 .",
    "also we examine the course of the degradation kinetics : at periodic intervals in separate simulations runs we analyze the size distribution of fragments ( clusters ) of the initial membrane and establish the time - dependent probability distribution function of fragment sizes , @xmath74 , as time elapses after the onset of the thermal degradation process .",
    "this also yields the time evolution of the mean fragment size , @xmath75 .",
    "we perform the statistical averaging of fragment sizes by developing an appropriate for the system fast cluster counting algorithm .",
    "the molecular dynamics calculations were carried out using a cluster counting algorithm based on an _ ad hoc _ implementation of the hoshen - kopelman program @xcite . in a subsequent paper of al - futaisi and patzek @xcite ,",

    "[ fig_histo]a we show the distribution of bond scission rates among all bonds of the honeycomb membrane for flakes ( with zig - zag pattern on the periphery ) of several sizes @xmath84 .",
    "somewhat surprisingly , one finds the overwhelming fraction of bond breaking occurs at the outer - most rim of the membrane where monomers are bound by only two bonds to the rest of the sheet .",
    "we have also sampled the rupture histograms for ribbon - like square membranes , fig .",
    "[ fig_histo]b .",
    "interestingly , we observe no difference between the rupture rates of zig - zag and armchair edges whereas the bonds in the four corners of such membrane expectedly break more frequently .",
    "the difference in the relative stability of the bonds becomes clearly evident in fig .",
    "[ fig_histo]d where the frequency of periphery bonds appears nearly two orders of magnitude larger when compared to bonds in the bulk of the membrane where each monomer ( node ) is connected by three bonds to its neighbors .",
    "one may therefore conclude that a moderate increase in the coordination number of the nodes ( by only 33% regarding the maximum coordination of a node ) leads to a major stabilization of the supporting bonds and much stronger resistance to fracture .",
    "our additional simulation in the strongly damped regime for @xmath85 indicates no qualitative changes compared to @xmath59 except an absolute overall increase of the rupture times which is natural for a more viscous environment .",
    "note that the question of where and which bonds predominantly break is by no means trivial .",
    "for example , in the case of linear polymer chain thermal decomposition the rate of bond rupture is least at both chain ends although the end monomers , in contrast to those inside the chain , are bound by a single bond only @xcite .",
    "we demonstrate in fig .",
    "[ fig_histo]c that this interesting feature holds also for the honeycomb membrane flake , provided the rim is clamped and left immobile during the simulation .",
    "evidently , the highest frequency of bond scissions grows towards the membrane center .",
    "similar to the case of polymer chains with fixed ends @xcite . in order to provide deeper insight into the mechanism of temperature - induced bond breaking , in the inset to fig .",

    "observes a significant growth of @xmath87 as compared to @xmath88 .",
    "this indicates that the trajectories of nodes at the membrane periphery attain much faster chaotic features at higher temperature than those of the bulk nodes .",
    "moreover , we should note that beads in the vortices have values of @xmath82 which exceed those in the rim by about @xmath89 .",
    "therefore this analysis of trajectory stability at characteristic locations in the membrane clearly demonstrate that bond rupture is induced by intermittent motion of the respective nodes .",
    "the variation of the mfbt @xmath0 of a bond with membrane size @xmath1 during thermolysis for both hexagonal and square shapes of the 2d sheet is displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig_mfbt]a .",
    "evidently , one observes for @xmath0 a well pronounced power law behavior , @xmath90 with an exponent @xmath91 .",
    "it turns out that the scaling exponent @xmath92 remains insensitive to changes in the geometric shape of the membrane sheet .",
    "this value of @xmath92 might appear somewhat surprisingly to deviate from the expected exponent of unity , given that in the absence of external force all bonds are supposed to break completely at random so that the total probability for a bond scission ( i.e. , the chance that _ any _ bond might break within a time interval ) is additive and should be , therefore , proportional to the total number of available bonds , @xmath93 . as suggested by fig .",
    "[ fig_histo ] , however , predominantly only periphery bonds are found to undergo scission during thermal degradation .",

    "[ fig_cracks]a - d that at @xmath144 the degradation process starts from the rim of the network sheet and then proceeds inwards , as noted earlier by meakin @xcite .",
    "in contrast , at @xmath145 higher temperature ,",
    "i.e. , at @xmath143 , bonds break everywhere in the network sheet - cf .",
    "[ fig_cracks]b ,  f and fig .",
    "[ fig_cracks]c ,  g. such difference in the bond scission mechanism at different temperatures has been observed @xcite before .",
    "it appears that at @xmath78 the membrane periphery undergoes stronger oscillations than the membrane bulk which lead to bond scission at the rim while in the inner part of the sheet the monomers mutually block each other and the bonds remain largely intact .",
    "this explanation is supported by the measured values of lyapunov exponents ( see the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig_histo ] and discussion in sec .",
    "[ sec_md_results ] a ) .",
    "on the other hand a hot i.e.  at @xmath141 membrane undergoes much stronger agitation as a whole and as a result bonds break all over the network sheet .",
    "moreover , at lower @xmath3 when the thermal agitation of the membrane is weaker , one may correlate the probability of bond scission with the average strain in the bonds -     vs.  distance from membrane center ( consecutive circle number ) for thermolysis of membrane composed of @xmath83 beads .",
    "the inset displays mean kinetic energy @xmath146 ( per monomer ) as a function of circle number .",
    "red dashed line represents the level of energy which corresponds to equipartition theorem .",
    "parameters of thermostat are @xmath78 and @xmath59 .",
    "[ fig_bondlength ] ]    fig .",
    "[ fig_bondlength ] . evidently , the average squared bond length @xmath147 increases steadily and becomes nearly @xmath148 larger for the bonds sitting on the last ring of the membrane whereas no difference in the mean kinetic energy between peripheral and bulk nodes is detected - fig .",
    "[ fig_bondlength ] .",
    "note that the kinetic energy ( that is , the temperature @xmath3 ) is thereby uniformly distributed along the sheet - see inset in fig .",
    "[ fig_bondlength ] .      after the onset of the thermal decomposition process the membrane flake disintegrates into smaller clusters ( fragments ) of size @xmath149 whose mean size ( or average molecular weight ) @xmath150 decreases steadily with time .",
    "@xmath150 is easily accessible experimentally , therefore we give in fig .",
    "[ fig_pdf]a the course of its temporal evolution , observed in our computer experiment . using an _ ad hoc _ cluster counting program in the course of the md - simulation we sample the     for membranes made of different size as indicated .",
    "symbols represent simulation results whereas a red line stands for the fitting function @xmath151 . the kinetic constant @xmath152 . in the inset the same is shown in normal coordinates .",
    "( b ) probability distribution of fragment sizes @xmath74 at different times @xmath121 ( in md time units ) after beginning of the thermal degradation process for a membrane with @xmath113 .",
    "parameters of a heat bath are @xmath153 and @xmath59 .",
    "[ fig_pdf],scaledwidth=36.0% ]    probability distribution of fragment sizes , @xmath74 , so that the first moment @xmath154 gives the cluster mean size @xmath150 .",
    "thus , for a given time moment @xmath121 we average data over more than @xmath68 independent runs , each starting from a different initial conformation of the honeycomb membrane . in fig .",
    "[ fig_pdf]b we show the time variation of the ensuing pdf @xmath74 whereby the system is seen to start with a single sharp peak at @xmath155 when the membrane is still intact .",
    "as time goes by , @xmath74 becomes bimodal , the maximum of the distribution is seen to shift to smaller values of cluster size whereas an accumulation of fragments of size @xmath156 or @xmath157 is observed to contribute to a second peak at @xmath158 . eventually , as @xmath159 , the pdf @xmath74 settles to a shape with a single sharp peak ( a @xmath5-function ) at @xmath158 ( not shown here ) .",
    "one can readily see from fig .",
    "[ fig_pdf]a that the quantity @xmath160 does not immediately follow a straight line of decay when plotted in semi - logarithmic coordinates , rather , such a decay is observed after an initial period of slower decline .",
    "this effect is due to averaging over many realizations of the fragmentation process . in each",
    "run the degradation of bonds starts earlier or later at a particular time @xmath0 ( the mean first breakage time ) that is distributed according to @xmath70 - cf .",
    "[ fig_mfbt]b . as a result",
    "a clear cut exponential course of @xmath160 is only observed in the late stages of fragmentation .",
    "such behavior is found independently of the membrane size - fig .",
    "[ fig_pdf]a .",
    "in addition , one could expect that the fragmentation process is not governed by a single rate constant in a presumably @xmath7order chemical reaction even though the bonds that undergo rupture are chemically identical . therefore , from the temporal mean cluster size behavior , presented in fig .",
    "[ fig_pdf]a , one may conclude that even in the case of a homogeneous membrane the thermal degradation process is more adequately described by several reaction constants which govern the dissociation of different groups of bonds . in the next section",
    "we suggest a simple model of reaction kinetics which takes into account this conjecture .      one may try to reproduce the bond scission kinetics during in the course of thermal fragmentation by a set of several @xmath6-order chemical reactions .",
    "the nodes of the membrane can be subdivided into several groups , depending on the number of intact bonds that connect them to neighboring nodes . in the case of a honeycomb membrane",
    "one may distinguish four such groups , and denote the instantaneous number of such nodes ( monomers ) by @xmath161 and @xmath162 whenever @xmath163 or @xmath164 intact bonds exist around such a node .",
    "if self - recombination of bonds is ignored , which is reasonable in view of large value of the threshold , and simultaneous scission of two and more bonds is disregarded as hardly probable , one can write down a strongly simplified set of @xmath6-order kinetic differential equations ( de ) that describes the evolution of @xmath165 and @xmath166 with time : @xmath167 thus , for example , the number of double - bonded nodes decreases as one of the two bonds breaks , however , if a bond breaks around a node with triple coordination this would increase the population of double - bonded nodes .",
    "note , that the total number of nodes of all kinds remains thereby conserved , @xmath168    if the degradation process starts with an intact membrane conformation at @xmath169 ( no broken bonds exist ) , one can fix the initial conditions as @xmath170 and @xmath171 .",
    "thus , initially one has only @xmath172 double - bonded nodes at the membrane periphery along with @xmath173 triple - bonded nodes in the bulk of the flake .",
    "then , as the decomposition process develops , nodes from a given class @xmath174 will transform into a lower class @xmath175 ones ( we neglect hereby the simultaneous scission of more than one bond of a node as highly improbable event ) . eventually , at @xmath159 the fragmentation process ends and one expects @xmath176 and @xmath177 .",
    "one may solve analytically the system of @xmath6-order de eqs .",
    "( [ de ] ) to a set of functions @xmath178 with @xmath179 :    @xmath180 \\nonumber \\\\",
    "n_2(t ) & = & 6",
    "l \\frac{\\left(k_2 e^{-k_2 t } - k_3 e^{-k_3 t } - k_3 l e^{-k_2 t } + k_3 l e^{-k_3 t } \\right)}{k_2 -k_3 } \\\\",
    "n_3(t ) & = & 6",
    "l ( l-1 ) e^{-k_3 t } \\nonumber \\label{de_sol}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where the rate constants @xmath181 and @xmath182 are still to be determined , for example , by comparison with simulation data . as one may readily verify from fig .",
    "[ fig_histo ] , our simulation data suggest that a bond to a triple - bonded node at @xmath183 is much more stable ( by about two orders of magnitude ) than a bond at the flake periphery where each node is connected by only two bonds to the network .",
    "thus the system of eqs .",
    "( 6 ) can be tested for a set of reaction constants @xmath184 directly by means of our molecular dynamics computer experiment .",
    "with @xmath185@xmath164 intact bonds with elapsed dimensionless time @xmath186 for a membrane with @xmath187 and @xmath188 .",
    "here @xmath189 denotes the characteristic time of degradation at the respective temperature @xmath3 .",
    "the @xmath190 ( monomers bound by a single bond ) are shown by shaded area .",
    "( b ) the same as in ( a ) for the same membrane size @xmath187 according to the analytic result eqs .",
    "the values of the kinetics rate constants are @xmath191 .",
    "[ fig_nodes],scaledwidth=36.0% ]    indeed , one finds by comparing the simulation result , fig .",
    "[ fig_nodes]a for a membrane of size @xmath187 at @xmath144 , and the analytical solution , eqs .",
    "( 6 ) , fig .",
    "[ fig_nodes]b , that the observed kinetics agree qualitatively , provided one allows for the absence of fluctuation in eqs .",
    "( 4 ) ( i.e. , for the disarray and averaging of the mfbt @xmath0 in the simulation data ) . we should like to point out here that the values of the rate constants @xmath192 are _ not _ best fit values . because of the additional effect of averaging discussed in sec .",
    "[ subsec_fragment ] and shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_pdf ] , a straight fitting procedure with three parameters @xmath193 would be both inefficient and hardly successful .",
    "therefore we tried different combinations of values for @xmath193 subject to the condition that @xmath194 . even though the general qualitative shapes turn out to be rather sensitive to the values of @xmath193 ( being capable of reproducing , e.g. , the existence of a common intersection point of @xmath195 and @xmath166 - see fig .",
    "[ fig_nodes]a - for particular choice of parameters ) , one finds thus easily a combination which qualitatively matches well the simulation data shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_nodes]a .",
    "one may conclude therefore that the simplified set of @xmath7order de eqs .",
    "( [ de ] ) captures qualitatively the main features of the fragmentation kinetics and the principal mechanism at work is a combination of few @xmath7order chemical reactions of bond scission . nonetheless , it is conceivable to expect that for a full quantitative description of the thermal degradation process the set of kinetic equations , eqs .",
    "( 4 ) , should be extended by few additional reactions : @xmath196 that may in principle also take place ( with respective rate constants ) .",
    "one can then still derive an analytical solution of the extended set of de that describes the full kinetics of fragmentation and try to fit the ensuing rate constants to the simulation data . in view of the growing number of fit parameters ,",
    "however , a detailed analysis of such system is beyond the scope of the present work and should be left for future work .",
    "in the present investigation we use langevin molecular dynamics simulation and also solve a set of @xmath7order kinetic de so as to model the process of thermal destruction of a polymerized membrane sheet with honeycomb structure .",
    "results of our work can be treated as generally applicable due to the fact that a two - dimensional regular lattice can only be created in few ways : honeycomb , triangular and square lattice with second neighbor interactions because of the zero - shear modulus ( apart from exotic cases like quasi - crystalline , kagome , etc .",
    "lattices of little relevance ) .",
    "the differences in lattice coordination among the first three periodic networks induce only quantitative renormalization of the young modulus .",
    "however they do nt change the overall elastic behavior .",
    "our findings regarding the most salient features of thermolysis in an elastic brittle honeycomb network sheet subject to sufficiently high temperature can be summarized as follows :    * the probability of bond scission is highest at the periphery of the membrane sheet where nodes are connected by two bonds only . at higher temperature , however , the whole sheet undergoes fragmentation whereby also bonds in the bulk rupture . * the mean time @xmath0 until a bond undergoes scission event declines with the number of nodes @xmath1 ( with membrane size ) by a power law as @xmath197 independently of the geometric shape of membrane sheet .",
    "the times of bond scission are exponentially distributed , @xmath198 . *",
    "bond recombination ( self - healing ) occurs seldom during thermal degradation , and the measured recombination times follow poisson distribution whereas an extra - stretching of bonds ( beyond the point of maximal tensile strength ) before a recombination takes place is exponentially improbable . *",
    "the fragmentation kinetics is determined by @xmath6-order reactions between network nodes with different number of intact bonds and follows simple exponential decay at late times . * a set of @xmath6-order kinetic differential equations , describing the process of fragmentation , can be established and solved analytically .",
    "one finds results in qualitative agreement with those from computer experiment providing thereby a deeper insight into the mechanism of thermal degradation of two - dimensional honeycomb networks .    in view of the presented results",
    ", it should be clear that more work is needed ( e.g. , regarding the effects of randomness in brittle networks ) until a full understanding of the process of thermal degradation in polymerized @xmath199-membranes is reached .",
