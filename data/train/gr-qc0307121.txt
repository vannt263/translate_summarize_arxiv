    "interest in the vacuum einstein equations with a non - null killing vector ( kv ) has been rekindled recently by the discovery of fayos and sopuerta @xcite that the weyl scalars in the newman - penrose ( np ) formalism can be expressed algebraically in terms of the spin coefficients and the norm of the killing vector .",
    "thus , steele @xcite has extended the results of fayos and sopuerta to the case of a proper homothetic vector , while ludwig @xcite , using the ghp formalism , further extended these results to the non - vacuum case and showed how the formalism can be used to determine all conformal killing vectors of a particular non - vacuum metric .",
    "the formalisms developed in these papers are completely general .",
    "the components of the killing vector and of the `` papapetrou field '' @xcite  the exterior derivative of the killing 1-form  are written down without making any gauge choices ( except in @xcite , where a `` preferred tetrad '' similar to the one defined here , is used ) , and the integrability conditions relating these quantities are found . as a result , these formalisms involve a number of variables that can be chosen arbitrarily ( to fix the frame relative to the killing vector ) , resulting in a redundant set of equations . moreover , due to the complexity of these equations , the implications of the vacuum bianchi identities ( when the weyl scalars are substituted for in terms of the spin coefficients ) are not considered in any of the works mentioned above . thus , despite the great number of equations contained in these papers , the entire system of equations to be solved has yet to be written down .    in this paper",
    "we examine the particular case of a vacuum spacetime with a spacelike , hypersurface - orthogonal killing vector , whose norm has a spacelike gradient .",
    "these assumptions hold true , at least near infinity , for asymptotically flat axisymmetric spacetimes .",
    "thus , they are appropriate for studying the simplest physical problem where the full dynamical content of general relativity can be manifested : the coalescence of two schwarzschild black holes falling toward one another along the line joining their centers .",
    "our choice of notation will refer to this axisymmetric problem , even though the equations will be valid in any spacetime having the assumed properties .",
    "our main result is that , by making a natural choice of frame based on the assumed properties of the kv , we are able to show that the entire set of ricci and bianchi equations in the np formalism reduce to a set of 17 real equations ( 11 for vacuum ) .",
    "we also recover , in a coordinate - free way , waylen s @xcite result that , when the `` main '' equations are satisfied , the contracted bianchi identities can be formally integrated in terms of a function satisfying the wave equation .    in section 2",
    "we define the canonical frame ( up to a boost ) and deduce relationships among the spin coefficients that follow from our choice of frame , while in section 3 we obtain the reduced set of equations and elucidate their structure . in section 4",
    "we give general coordinate expressions for the frame components which make the ricci tensor have vanishing components in the direction of the kv .",
    "finally , in section 5 we discuss ways of choosing the remaining frame and coordinate freedom , as well as additional conditions that can be imposed in order to seek solutions satisfying extra physical or mathematical requirements .",
    "the np equations are invariant under arbitrary frame rotations ( arbitrary lorentz transformations ) .",
    "we can use this six - real - parameter freedom to fix the frame relative to the geometric structures assumed for the spacetime .",
    "first , we will use three parameters to rotate our frame so that the space - like killing vector @xmath0 points in the direction of ( @xmath1 ) .",
    "( we use the standard np notation @xcite : the complex null - tetrad basis @xmath2 is normalized to @xmath3 . )",
    "if the ( closed ) killing trajectories are parametrized by the parameter @xmath4 , then the assumption that the kv is hypersurface orthogonal implies that we can write ^a = = , [ eq : dksiup ] + _ a = -^2 = , [ eq : dphi ] where @xmath5 is a scalar function giving the norm of the kv : ^a _ a = -^2 .",
    "the 3-surfaces orthogonal to the killing trajectories are spanned by the vectors @xmath6 . in the following",
    ", we will restrict the symbols @xmath7 to denote the corresponding co - vectors ( differential forms ) while the vectors ( differential operators ) will be denoted by the standard symbols @xmath8 .",
    "thus the exterior derivative of an arbitrary function @xmath9 will be written f = f+d f - f - f .",
    "the choice of frame @xmath10 to a hypersurface orthogonal killing vector drastically simplifies the np equations : all spin coefficients become real ( see the appendix ) , while @xmath11 on any function @xmath9 of the 3 essential coordinates .",
    "thus we can drop the bar from @xmath12 ( and , of course , from the spin coefficients ) in all equations .",
    "next , we note that the gradient of the norm of the kv will have components in the @xmath13 directions only and , by assumption , will be spacelike .",
    "we can , therefore , use two degrees of freedom to further restrict our frame by requiring that ~ d=0=. [ eq : dr ] the frame is now completely determined up to a boost in the @xmath14 plane parametrized by an arbitrary scalar function @xmath15 : a , .",
    "[ boosta ] there does not seem to be a `` natural '' choice for eliminating this freedom , based on the assumed properties of the killing vector .",

    "[ deltau ]    in summary , we restrict the choice of frame by imposing the five conditions : ( i ) the components of @xmath0 in the @xmath31 directions vanish , and ( ii ) the gradient of the norm of the kv points in the direction of @xmath32 , which , for a hypersurface - orthogonal kv , implies that the spin coefficients satisfy @xmath33 .",
    "since @xmath32 is now hypersurface orthogonal , the condition @xmath34 follows .",
    "the remaining equations obtained in this section are the result of applying the commutators to the functions @xmath35 and requiring @xmath36 to vanish .",
    "being integrability conditions , they are contained in the ricci and bianchi identities as will be shown in the next section .",
    "we now examine the ricci identities with @xmath37 and assuming all spin coefficients real .",
    "as these equations give real expressions for @xmath38 we can assume @xmath39 .",

    "when the ricci tensor satisfies @xmath47 , one more equation ( [ dstrf ] ) can be reduced to an identity by choosing certain metric functions appropriately . finally , in vacuum , the three contracted bianchi identities disappear , so we are left with 11 ( real ) equations .      ever since the classic paper of bondi _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , it is instructive to split the seven ricci equations ( [ ric1]-[ric7 ] ) into 4 `` main '' and 3 `` subsidiary '' equations , such that , when the `` main '' equations are satisfied everywhere , the contracted bianchi identities impose extra conditions on an `` initial '' hypersurface . in a paper that has received less attention than it deserves . however , unlike @xcite where four main equations need to be satisfied , in @xcite one main equation is satisfied identically .",
    "] , waylen @xcite has studied the axisymmetric vacuum einstein equations . using a particular coordinate system ( one coordinate being the scalar function @xmath5 ) in which is satisfied identically",
    ", he has shown that    1 .",
    "near the symmetry axis , analytic ( power series ) solutions depending on an arbitrary function of two variables can be constructed by solving the `` main '' equations .",
    "two of the bianchi identities can then be satisfied identically by letting the three remaining components of the ricci tensor be proportional to the derivatives of a single scalar function @xmath48 .",
    "the third bianchi identity then implies that the function @xmath48 satisfies the wave equation ; and the only solution of that equation that behaves well on the axis is the trivial solution @xmath49 .",
    "remarkably , waylen s integration of the bianchi identities can be carried out in our formalism _ without resorting to a particular coordinate system_. following waylen , let us take as main equations the set @xmath50 together with equation .",
    "then , expressing the non - vanishing ricci components in terms of @xmath51 , the bianchi identities become d _ 11 - _ 01 + ( 2 + 3)_01 - 4_11 + _ 12=0 , + d _ 12 - 2_11 + _ 01 - 2 ( - 2)_01 +",

    "the second equation ( apart from an overall factor @xmath52 ) then becomes ( d)+ ( ) -2 ( ) = 0 , which is the wave equation for @xmath48 , the left - hand - side being equal to @xmath53 .",

    "now , by equations and , @xmath57 , so that the co - vector @xmath58 using , can be written -=(_,a-_,a).[lnmin ] next we observe that the vector @xmath59 gives zero ( by equations and ) when acting on the scalars @xmath60 the unique such vector in a 3-dimensional space is + d = , where @xmath61 is a proportionality factor .",
    "then the properly normalized co - vector @xmath62 will have the form + = ( t_a-_,a),[lnplu ] where the @xmath63 are three arbitrary functions and t ( ) = ^abct_a_,b_,c .",

    "the tensor product of @xmath29 depends on the product of the functions @xmath67 and @xmath68 only , so the functions entering the metric are @xmath69  a total of 10 functions . remembering that the vectors @xmath70 are defined up to scale and that the expressions are invariant",
    "if a multiple of @xmath71 is added to @xmath63 , we conclude that , in an arbitrary coordinate system , the metric depends on 7 independent functions , as expected .",
    "this three - parameter freedom in choosing the metric functions @xmath72 can be used to simplify the equations .",
    "for example , using equations and , the closed 2-form @xmath73 is given by = -_abch^a .",
    "we can now fix the scale of @xmath74 by imposing the condition @xmath75 .",

    "collecting everything together , and introducing the index - free notation , _",

    "these expressions are invariant under a redefinition of the @xmath63 according to t_a t^_a=_1t_a+_2_,a , _ 1,_2 , while equation is satisfied by choosing h^a=^abc_b , c_a.[apotential ] finally , we observe that the linear combinations of the vectors @xmath77 appearing in equations ( 60 - 64 ) are invariant under the boost freedom .",
    "the expressions for the np frame vectors given in the previous section are invariant under two distinct types of transformation :    1 .   the remaining freedom in the choice of unknown functions ( the ratio @xmath78 and the arbitrariness in the definition of @xmath63 ) , and 2 .",
    "an arbitrary change in coordinates @xmath79 , that can be eliminated by imposing three `` coordinate conditions '' on the 7 independent metric functions .",
    "ideally , the freedom in the first type of transformation should be used to bring the remaining three `` main '' equations to as simple a form as possible , as was done with and the scaling of @xmath80 .",
    "then the second type of transformation can be used to seek solutions of these equations in a system of coordinates that is adapted to the specific physical system one is interested in . in that way",
    ", it will be easier to relate the arbitrary functions of integration entering the solution ( and the three `` coordinate conditions '' ) to properties of the physical system . that the choice of coordinates is important in specifying a particular problem is evident from the following consideration :",
    "the `` general '' ( depending on an arbitrary function of two variables ) approximate solutions obtained in references @xcite and @xcite , using geometrically defined coordinates , offer no clues as to how the arbitrary functions in these solutions are to be chosen so as to give the metric describing , say , two coalescing schwarzschild black holes rather than that of any other distribution of matter along the axis .",
    "for the two - black - hole problem , the functions of integration would be expected to depend ultimately on the properties of the two world lines and the two masses  the physical data needed to specify the problem .",
    "these are functions of one variable only  a parameter ( proper time ) along each world line . with this in mind , we have developed and studied a coordinate system that uses these two parameters as coordinates and is thus appropriate for the two - black - hole problem . it will be presented in a future publication . for the rest of this section",
    "we will discuss possible choices of the first kind of transformation .",
    "the freedom in the choice of @xmath63 can be used to make the scalars @xmath81 and @xmath82 equal to anything one pleases . and it is not unreasonable to expect that one can exploit this freedom to bring one ( or more ) combination(s ) of the equations to a form that can be solved .",
    "the fact , however , that these scalars involve almost all of the free functions in a non - trivial way makes this task extremely difficult .",
    "turning now to the boost freedom , several choices suggest themselves : the simplest is to use this freeedom to set the ratio @xmath78 equal to unity .",
    "( in fact , ludwig @xcite uses this choice in some cases ) .",
    "however , the main equations do not become any simpler with this choice .",
    "another choice is to use the boost freedom , under which @xmath83 , to make the sum @xmath84 vanish .",
    "but this again does not lead to equations that we know how to handle .",
    "a more promising possibility arises in considering the main equation .",
    "the effect of a boost on @xmath85 , defined in , is g_0 g_0+(+ d ) , so , in principle , @xmath15 can be chosen to make @xmath85 vanish .",
    "then equation becomes a total divergence , which again can be `` integrated '' in terms of a vector potential .",
    "specifically , when @xmath86 , equation implies that the following 2-form is closed : f_2=. however , we have not been able to obtain managable expressions using the vector potential arising from @xmath87 together with @xmath86 .",
    "finally , the observation that , under the boost the connection one - form _ 01=+--transforms according to @xmath88 , suggests that we can impose a lorentz - type gauge condition on @xmath89 -^ * ( ^ * _ 01)=+ -(+)=0 , which implies that the 2-form f_3=is closed .",
    "there are , clearly , many other possibilities .      instead of trying to simplify the general equations as much as possible",
    ", one can seek solutions that satisfy additional conditions .",
    "such conditions can be suggested by examining the properties of the gravitational principal null directions ( gpnds ) of the spacetime . for example , equations imply that , in vacuum , the frame vector  @xmath90 is a gpnd ( @xmath91 ) if and only if it is geodesic ( @xmath92 ) , and the same is true of @xmath93 .",
    "so @xmath94 are obvious conditions to use in the search for special solutions .",
    "consider now an arbitrary null vector in the 3-space orthogonal to the killing trajectories @xmath95 , parametrized by some real parameter @xmath96 .",
    "the condition that it is a gpnd is @xmath97 , which , using in vacuum becomes + 6z^2-z^4 + 4(z - z^3)=0 .",
    "we now observe that , if we choose @xmath98 ( assuming that @xmath99 have the same sign ) , and require that the spin coefficients satisfy the single relation",
    "^2-^2 + 6=0,[spincond ] then _ both _ null vectors n_=+ ( ) [ npm ] will be gpnds .",
    "equation is invariant under the boost transformation .",
    "nevertheless , it can be considered as determining the ratio @xmath100 in terms of @xmath101 .",
    "then , provided that gives two distinct real and positive solutions for this ratio , equation will determine altogether four distinct gpnds .",
    "these four gpnds and the frame vectors @xmath102 will then be related in a way that is analogous to the way the four gpnds of a petrov - type i spacetime are related to the geometrically determined `` weyl canonical frame '' defined in @xcite .",
    "thus , condition on the spin coefficients can be interpreted as the condition that the `` canonical frame '' defined in this paper coincides with the `` weyl canonical frame '' of @xcite .",
    "alternatively , one can impose the condition that one of the null vectors is hypersurface orthogonal , say @xmath103 , thus defining a family of of bondi - like null hypersurfaces .",
    "note that the extra conditions proposed here do not necessarily imply that the weyl tensor is algebraically special , even though further analysis of the equations may lead to that conclusion .",
    "we intend to consider further some of the possibilities suggested here in future publications .    _",
    "note : _ the results presented in this paper involve extensive calculations .",
    "all equations given have been checked using the computer algebra program mathematica together with the author s package `` _ _ exterior differential calculus _ _ '' , which is available at www.inp.demokritos.gr/@xmath104sbonano / edc/.",
