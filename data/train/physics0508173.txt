    "turbulent flows are ubiquitous in nature and their very complexity make them hard to understand , let alone predict .",
    "one reason is that turbulence comes in intermittent `` gusts '' , such as fronts .",
    "these gusts are associated with their non - gaussian statistics , which allows strong events occurring in the `` fat tails '' of the statistical distribution of , say , velocity gradients and other physical variables . from the theoretical viewpoint ,",
    "its property of intermittency is the _ sine qua non _ of turbulence .",
    "intermittency may also trigger large scale effects , such as the apparently random reversals of the earth s magnetic field @xcite .",
    "it plays a role in other large scale events in the solar dynamo , and in the atmosphere of the earth .",
    "although intermittency is believed to take place at small scales , strong events can affect the dynamics of the large scales , specially in systems close to criticality .",
    "for instance , ref .",
    "@xcite shows that local fluctuations of the kinetic helicity can explain phase and amplitude variations of the 22-years solar cycle .",
    "intermittency is also one possible explanation for the occurrence of the maunder - like minima of solar activity @xcite .",
    "finally , intermittency is known to affect the transport of momentum in atmospheric surface layers @xcite .",
    "intermittency is a highly spatially and temporally localized phenomenon , which thus requires high - resolution instrumentation , be it in the laboratory , in atmospheric and geophysical flows or in numerical simulations . in the latter case , the lack of adequate computer power ( from the standpoint of the geo - physicist )",
    "implies that modeling of the unresolved small scales must take place .",
    "however , intermittency in general is not included explicitly in large eddy simulations ( les ) models of turbulent processes .",
    "the intermittency of the subgrid - scale ( sgs ) energy dissipation as is usually defined in les has been studied filtering 3d direct numerical simulations ( dns ) of non - conductive fluids @xcite , with a taylor reynolds number @xmath4 ; such a reynolds number is somewhat insufficient for a determination of third - order scaling . for the sgs dissipation ,",
    "they find that the smagorinsky model , the volume - averaged dynamic model , and the similarity model perform fairly well ( _ e.g. _ the error in the exponent for @xmath5 is less than 7% ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the constant eddy - viscosity and spectral eddy - viscosity models underestimate intermittency beyond @xmath6 ( compared to dns ) while the local and clipped dynamic smagorinsky models strongly overestimate the intermittency beyond @xmath6 . in models",
    "not capturing intermittency properly , the question arises whether the overall statistics of the flow at large scales would be affected by the absence of intermittency ; and if so , how intermittency should be incorporated .",
    "there are many models of turbulent flows ( see for example the recent review in @xcite ) and there are many turbulent flows for which adequate testing of such models is in order .",
    "magnetohydrodynamics , _",
    "i.e. _ the coupling of a velocity and magnetic field at sub - luminal velocities so that the displacement current can be neglected , presents an interesting property , namely that in two space dimensions ( 2d ) , intermittency occurs as well as in three dimensions ( 3d ) .",
    "this is in contrast with the 2d neutral fluid case for which the conservation of vorticity leads to an inverse energy cascade to the large scales ; in the presence of a magnetic field , this conservation is broken by the lorentz force . since , from a numerical standpoint , much higher reynolds numbers can be achieved in 2d , an intermittent flow can be reached in 2d - mhd with adequate scale separation between the energy - containing range , the inertial range and the dissipation range .",
    "our 2d mhd tests are able to exhibit a substantially larger reynolds number ( up to @xmath7 ) than the values listed for previous studies .",
    "this fact provides an ideal testing ground for models of turbulent mhd flows , such as they occur in geophysics and astrophysics : magnetic fields are observed in detail in the earth and sun environments , and are known to be dynamically important as well for the solar - terrestrial interactions ( the so - called space weather ) , in the interstellar medium and in galaxies .",
    "modeling of mhd flows is still under development ( see @xcite ) .",
    "most les for hydrodynamic turbulence are based upon self - similarity or universality , in that they assume a known power law of the energy spectrum . for mhd ,",
    "the kinetic energy is not a conserved quantity , and this poses a problem for the extension of such techniques to the case of mhd .",
    "additional difficulties arise from the fact that mhd has several regimes depending on the relative strengths of the magnetic and velocity fields , their degree of alignment , and whether mechanical or magnetic energy is injected into the flow .",
    "however , some les have been developed for particular cases .",
    "there exists les for mhd turbulence with some degree of alignment between the velocity and magnetic fields @xcite , dissipative les which does not model the interactions between the two fields @xcite , and les for low magnetic reynolds number @xcite .",
    "we have recently tested one model which may be more generally applicable , the lagrangian averaged magneto - hydrodynamics alpha ( _ lamhd@xmath0 _ ) model , both in 2d @xcite and in 3d @xcite and it has been used to examine the onset of the dynamo instability when the magnetic prandtl number ( the ratio of viscosity @xmath8 to magnetic diffusivity @xmath9 ) is small @xcite , as occurs in liquid metals in the laboratory , in the liquid core of the earth or in the solar convection zone . in this context , because of the importance of intermittency as a fundamental , or even defining property of turbulence , we seek to determine to what extent _",
    "lamhd@xmath0 _ exhibits intermittency .",
    "intermittency is believed to be associated only with a forward cascade of energy ; that is , the cascade of energy from larger scales to smaller scales , or , equivalently , from low wave numbers to high wave numbers . as previously mentioned , in determining the extent to which the _",

    "in two space dimensions , the conservation of vorticity in the neutral ( @xmath61 case ) leads to an inverse energy cascade ; however , the lorentz force breaks this conservation and , in mhd , energy is found to be mostly transferred to the small scales both in 2d and in 3d .",
    "several measurements , starting with satellite data in the solar wind and continuing more recently with direct numerical simulations both in two dimensions and three dimensions , indicate that the energy spectrum of a turbulent mhd flow follows a law that is barely distinguishable from a neutral fluid , with @xmath62 .",
    "differences do occur when one examines higher order structure functions : the most intermittent case ( almost comparable in magnitude to that of the passive scalar ) is the two - dimensional mhd fluid ; three - dimensional mhd appears less intermittent than the 2d mhd case @xcite , and the 3d neutral fluid is the lesser intermittent of the three .",
    "intermittency has been observed in the solar wind as well .",
    "none of the data at the second order level is in agreement with the phenomenologies developed by kolmogorov @xcite and leading to an energy spectrum @xmath63 ( heretofore the k41 model ) or by iroshnikov and by kraichnan @xcite ( heretofore , the ik model ) and leading to a shallower spectrum , _ viz .",

    "these two types of phenomenology differ by the taking into account in the latter case of the non - local interactions ( in fourier space ) emanating from the propagation of alfvn waves ; it is worth mentioning here that the ik model also agrees with the isotropic limit of the weak turbulence theory for incompressible mhd @xcite .",
    "note also that a model of intermittency for mhd flows @xcite does recover the intermittency as measured in direct numerical simulations both in 2d @xcite and in 3d @xcite , but such models depend on two adjustable parameters and thus do not necessarily have a predictive power .",
    "these anomalous scaling laws are not fully understood but , for the neutral case , there is an exact law at third order with which the k41 phenomenology is compatible . in mhd ,",
    "the exact law is more complex in its structure since it involves third - order cross - correlations between the velocity and the magnetic field @xcite whereas the phenomenologies evoked above refer to single - variable moments . in that instance , it is worth asking what is the equivalent exact law in the context of the _",

    "in 1938 , krmn and howarth @xcite introduced the invariant theory of isotropic hydrodynamic turbulence , and derived from the navier - stokes equations an exact law relating the time derivative of the two - point velocity correlation with the divergence of the third - order correlation function . later , this result was generalized to the mhd case by chandrasekar @xcite , and recently written in terms of elssser variables @xcite . for _",

    "( [ eq : sheleveque]).,width=415 ]",
    "sufficient resolution for studying directly high reynolds number flows as encountered in geophysics and astrophysics is today well beyond technological limits .",
    "closures such as the lagrangian - averaged alpha - model can reduce the computational burden by reducing the resolution requirements . however , to be used as a model of hydrodynamic or magnetohydrodynamic turbulence , or for applications in astrophysics and geophysics , detailed knowledge of the ability of the _ lans@xmath0 _ or _",
    "lamhd@xmath0 _ equations to capture key features of turbulent flows is required .",
    "the _ lans@xmath0 _ and _ lamhd@xmath0 _ equations have been tested against direct numerical simulations in a variety of problems ( see @xcite for neutral fluid studies and @xcite for studies in conducting fluids ) . most of these works compared the time evolution of ideal invariants for forced and free decaying turbulence , as well as the evolution of energy spectra .",
    "also , some statistical comparisons were performed ( studying the behavior of probability density functions ) . in this work ,",
    "we apply a more stringent test to these models .",
    "intermittency is a well known feature of turbulent flows , associated with the existence of strong events localized both in space and time .",
    "intermittency can trigger large scale events , affect the transport coefficients , or give rise to corrections in the turbulent scaling . as a result ,",
    "whether a model can capture the statistics of intermittent events is of utmost importance to model astrophysical or geophysical flows .",
    "the study of intermittency also requires computation of high order statistics , thereby extending previous comparisons between dns and @xmath10-models .",
    "an extension of the krmn - howarth theorem ( kh-@xmath10 ) was proven for the _ lans@xmath0 _ equations in ref . @xcite . as a corollary of this theorem ,",
    "kolmogorov four - fifths law and kolmogorov s energy spectrum can be derived for the _ lans@xmath0 _ equations at scales larger than @xmath10 . in this work",
    ", we extended the kh-@xmath10 theorem to the _ lamhd@xmath0 _",
    "case , proving as a result that for scales larger than @xmath10 the _ lamhd@xmath0 _",
    "equations satisfy the scaling laws previously known for mhd turbulence @xcite .",
    "this is an important result , since mhd turbulence involves two coupled fields ( the velocity and magnetic fields ) and can display different power laws in the inertial range according to the regime of interest . while les often impose a particular regime and a power law @xcite , the _ lamhd@xmath0 _",
    "equations are shown to satisfy the general scalings satisfied by the mhd equations without any hypothesis about the scaling followed in the inertial range .",
    "the extension of the kh-@xmath10 theorem to the _ lamhd@xmath0 _ case also allows us to define correlation and structure functions in the @xmath10-model . with these functions , the analysis of anomalous scaling and intermittency can be performed .",
    "numerical simulations were carried out both for freely decaying and for forced two dimensional mhd turbulence , solving directly the mhd equations , and employing the _ lamhd@xmath0 _ equations at 1/2 and 1/4 resolution ( a case equivalent to 1/8 of the dns resolution was also considered for forced turbulence ) . in the forced runs ,",
    "we have averaged statistics over 189 turn - over times ( and up to @xmath203 points ) to test if the _ lamhd@xmath0 _ equations reproduces intermittent turbulent behavior .",
    "the scaling of the third - order structure function was tested and linear scaling with length ( down to length @xmath10 ) was observed , in good agreement with corollaries of the extended kh-@xmath10 theorem and exact laws in mhd turbulence @xcite .",
    "the _ lamhd@xmath0 _ equations also capture high - order statistics ( up to and including order 8) and the anomalous scaling of the longitudinal structure function exponents , with a net gain in speed close to a factor of 16 .    for lower order structure functions , very little contamination of the scaling",
    "could be detected at scales larger than @xmath10 .",
    "on the other hand , for the highest computed order , fluctuations in the scaling are observed for the runs with the smallest resolution .",
    "note that we would not expect any scaling to be preserved for @xmath10 so large that no inertial range remains .",
    "turbulence closures are never unique .",
    "the present case may owe its success not to its particular form , but rather to its general properties that it ( 1 ) preserves physical avenues of nonlinear energy exchange and ( 2 ) allows correct vortex stretching .",
    "these two properties derive from its origin via a lagrangian - averaged hamilton s principle .",
    "the derivation also identifies the appropriate dissipation for proper energy decay , which involves an enhanced resistivity , but not an enhanced viscosity .",
    "together , the navier - stokes viscosity and the enhanced resistivity produce regularization ( _ e.g. _ , existence and uniqueness of strong solutions and their global attractor of finite hausdorf dimension , to be discussed elsewhere ) . in turn",
    ", these choices of viscosity and resistivity allow the intermittency found here , which might have otherwise been suppressed .",
    "relying on the fact that , contrary to fluids , two dimensional mhd turbulence displays a direct cascade of energy and intermittency , we could show that the _ lamhd@xmath0 _ equations reproduce intermittency features of turbulent flows and thus we postulate that these results will carry over to the three - dimensional case and thus these results could be also of relevance to the modeling of neutral fluids .",
    "future challenges will include implementation of the _",
    "lamhd@xmath0 _ model in domains with boundaries and the study of intermittency for magnetic prandtl numbers besides unity .",
    "the choices of boundary conditions may be expected to strongly influence the solution behavior .",
    "of course , this matter is beyond the scope of the present article .",
