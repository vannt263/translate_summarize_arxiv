    "historically , the single - band hubbard model was suggested independently by gutzwiller  @xcite , hubbard  @xcite and kanamori  @xcite to gain insight into the origin of metallic ferromagnetism . however , despite enormous efforts  @xcite that were undertaken to find answers to this question , only a few reliable results have been obtained even for this simplest possible microscopic model .",
    "the hubbard model also exhibits a variety of other competing phases , including antiferromagnetic and superconducting phases .",
    "the first exact results for ferromagnetism were obtained in the strong coupling limit , @xmath8 , by nagaoka  @xcite and thouless  @xcite who showed that the ground state of the hubbard model with one hole or electron is ferromagnetic at an infinitely large coulomb repulsion .",
    "that result did not answer the question of stability to a finite concentration of holes in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "improved bounds for the nagaoka state have recently been derived  @xcite for various lattices in two and three dimensions",
    ". ferromagnetic ground states also occur if one of the several bands of the model is dispersionless ( so - called lieb s ferrimagnetism  @xcite and flat - band ferromagnetism  @xcite ) .",
    "mielke and tasaki proved the local stability of ferromagnetic ground states in the hubbard model with nearly flat  @xcite and partially filled  @xcite bands .",
    "@xcite contains a short review of these works as well as new results for hubbard models without the singularities associated with flat bands .",
    "a review of results  @xcite obtained for the simple one - band hubbard model in the last few years as well as the results of mielke and tasaki suggest that the important ingredients for ferromagnetism in that model are ( a ) an interaction strength that is in the intermediate to strong coupling regime and ( b ) a band that exhibits a strong asymmetry and a large density of states near the fermi energy or near one of the band edges .",
    "metallic ferromagnetism at weak coupling , usually known as stoner ferromagnetism , has in fact been ruled out a long time ago by kanamori  @xcite based on the argument that the renormalization of the interaction strength brought about by @xmath9matrix effects ( kanamori screening ) would never allow the stoner criterion to be satisfied when the density of states at the fermi level @xmath10 is non singular .",
    "physically , the largest possible effective interaction , according to kanamori , is equal to the kinetic energy cost for making the two - particle wave function vanish when the two particles are at the same site . that energy scales like the bandwidth @xmath11 so that the stoner criterion @xmath12 can not be fulfilled .",
    "quantum monte carlo calculations confirm the quantitative nature of kanamori s @xmath9matrix result  @xcite .",
    "if there is stoner - type ferromagnetism in weak to intermediate coupling , it is thus clear that , as in the moderate to strong - coupling case , one needs at least a singular density of states to overcome kanamori screening .",
    "an example of a model with singular density of states at the fermi energy as well as band asymmetry is the two - dimensional ( 2d ) hubbard model with both nearest neighbor , @xmath0 , and next - nearest - neighbor , @xmath1 , hoppings .",
    "when the fermi energy is close to the van hove singularity the corresponding filling is usually referred to as a van hove filling . at that filling , the fermi surface passes through the saddle points of the single - particle dispersion .",
    "there are , however , other phases competing with ferromagnetism . at",
    "weak to moderate values of the on - site coulomb repulsion @xmath13 for small @xmath14 and close to half - filling , the 2d @xmath15 hubbard model shows an antiferromagnetic instability .",
    "that instability due to nesting is however destroyed  @xcite for a sufficiently large ratio @xmath14 at weak interactions in two and three dimensions , thus leaving room for other instabilities , including @xmath16-wave superconductivity and metallic ferromagnetism .    the questions which we address in this paper",
    "are thus the following .",
    "can the asymmetry of the band and the large density of states near the fermi energy overcome the kanamori argument and lead to ferromagnetism in the 2d hubbard model ?",
    "what are the competing phases ?",
    "most results on this problem ( particularly for a square lattice ) fall into three different classes .",
    "( a ) momentum - cutoff renormalization group ( rg ) methods  @xcite , and quantum monte carlo calculations  @xcite suggest that there is no evidence for ferromagnetism .",
    "but the problem , in particular with numerical methods , is that only very small system sizes can be used in a regime where the size dependence is important .",
    "in addition , momentum - cutoff rg does not allow the contribution of ferromagnetic fluctuations  @xcite .",
    "so these results should not be considered conclusive .",
    "( b ) the second class of results is based on wegner s flow equations .",
    "they show  @xcite a tendency towards weak ferromagnetism with @xmath17-wave character ( the order parameter changes sign close to the fermi energy ) . according to the flow equations calculations this phase competes with other instabilities in the particle - hole channel , in particular with the pomeranchuk instability .",
    "the difficulty of those weak - coupling calculations is that the @xmath18-magnetic phase occurs at stronger coupling than the regime of validity of the second order analysis in @xmath19 of the flow equations .",
    "( c ) the third class suggests clear evidence for ferromagnetic ground states .",
    "these works include a projector quantum monte carlo calculation with @xmath20 sites and the @xmath21-matrix technique  @xcite , a generalized random phase approximation ( rpa ) including particle - particle scattering  @xcite and exact diagonalizations  @xcite .",

    ", they have found that the ferromagnetic instability is the leading one for @xmath23 at van hove fillings with the critical temperature strongly dependent on the value of @xmath1 .",

    "antiferromagnetism and @xmath25-wave superconductivity are the competing instabilities .",
    "the tpsc approach is non - perturbative and applies up to intermediate coupling .",
    "it enforces the pauli principle , conservation laws and includes the kanamori screening effect .",
    "comparisons with quantum monte carlo calculations have shown that tpsc is the analytical approach that gives the most accurate results for the spin structure factor  @xcite , the spin susceptibility  @xcite and the @xmath25-wave susceptibility  @xcite in two dimensions . throughout the paper",

    "the bare single particle dispersion has the form , in units where lattice spacing is unity , @xmath31 this spectrum leads to a van hove singularity in the density of states coming from saddle points of the dispersion relation that are located at @xmath32 and @xmath33 the corresponding energy is @xmath34 . in this paper",
    "we always consider the case where the non - interacting chemical potential is @xmath35 , so that the non - interacting fermi surface crosses the saddle points and the non - interacting density of states diverges logarithmically at the fermi energy . the filling corresponding to this choice of chemical potential is a `` van hove filling '' .",
    "for @xmath36 and half - filling the fermi surface is perfectly nested , namely @xmath37 , with @xmath38 , which leads to an antiferromagnetic instability for @xmath39 .",
    "the perfect nesting is removed for @xmath40 .",
    "we work in units where bolzmann s constant @xmath41 and nearest - neighbor hopping @xmath0 are all unity .",
    "the tpsc approach  @xcite can be summarized as follows  @xcite .",
    "we use the functional method of schwinger - martin - kadanoff - baym with source field @xmath42 to first generate exact equations for the self - energy @xmath43 and response ( four - point ) functions for spin and charge excitations ( spin - spin and density - density correlation functions ) .",
    "in such a scheme , spin and charge dynamical susceptibilities can be obtained from the functional derivatives of the source dependent propagator @xmath44 with respect to @xmath42 .",
    "our non - perturbative approach then consists in two steps .    at the first level of approximation ,",
    "we use the following two - particle self - consistent scheme to determine the two - particle quantities : we apply a hartree - fock type factorization of the four - point response function that defines the product @xmath45 but we also impose the important additional constraint that the factorization is exact when all space - time coordinates of the four - point function coincide . from the corresponding self - energy ,",
    "we obtain the local momentum- and frequency - independent irreducible particle - hole vertex appropriate for the spin response @xmath46 the renormalization of this vertex mainly comes  @xcite from kanamori screening  @xcite .",
    "the double occupancy @xmath47 entering this equation is then obtained self - consistently using the fluctuation - dissipation theorem and the pauli principle .",
    "more specifically , the pauli principle , @xmath48 , implies that @xmath49 while the fluctuation - dissipation theorem leads to an equality between the equal - time equal - position correlation @xmath50 and the corresponding susceptibility , namely @xmath51 where , using the short - hand @xmath52 , the summation is over all wave vectors and all matsubara frequencies with @xmath21 the temperature , @xmath53 the electron filling , and @xmath54 the number of lattice sites .",

    "the green functions at this first level of approximation , @xmath60 , contain a self - energy @xmath61 that depends on double - occupancy but since this self - energy is momentum and frequency independent , it can be absorbed in the definition of the chemical potential . in the above",
    "then , @xmath62 is the bare propagator and @xmath63 is the bare particle - hole susceptibility both evaluated with the non - interacting chemical potential @xmath64 corresponding to the desired filling .",
    "the irreducible charge vertex @xmath65 strictly speaking is not momentum and frequency - independent .",

    "( [ chi_sp ] ) and ( [ chi_ch ] ) satisfy conservation laws  @xcite .",
    "this approach , that satisfies the pauli principle by construction , also satisfies the mermin - wagner theorem : there is no finite - temperature phase transition breaking a continuous symmetry .",
    "nevertheless there is a crossover temperature below which the magnetic correlation length grows exponentially  @xcite until it reaches infinity at zero temperature .",

    "this means that for the leading term with a logarithmic structure to be , say , about ten times larger than the subdominant term , the temperature should be as low as @xmath161 .",
    "the corresponding @xmath19 ( or @xmath55 ) that satisfies @xmath162or @xmath163 at this temperature is very small , namely @xmath164 .",
    "therefore , unless @xmath19 is very small , the next leading term plays an important role and a straightforward application of the asymptotic form ( taking only the leading term ) is not justified . for @xmath113 and @xmath22 , for example , tpsc shows that near the antiferromagnetic to ferromagnetic boundary , the crossover temperature is of order @xmath165 and @xmath166 respectively .",
    "for this temperature , the sub - leading term @xmath167 is comparable to the logarithmic contribution .",
    "the tpsc phase diagram is in qualitative agreement with the tcrg phase diagram  @xcite .",
    "in addition , the critical values @xmath168 for the stability of superconductivity and ferromagnetism are the same in both approaches .",
    "but in contrast with the tcrg , ferromagnetism in tpsc occurs at very low temperatures , and increasing @xmath2 does not lead to a dramatic increase in crossover temperature .",
    "one can see from fig .  [ tc_tpsc ] that the critical values of @xmath1 for the stability of ferromagnetism are unchanged for different @xmath19 , whereas the critical @xmath169 for the stability of @xmath170-wave superconductivity decreases with increasing coupling strength @xmath19 .",
    "the fact that the crossover temperature towards ferromagnetism depends even more weakly on @xmath1 in tpsc than in rpa can be explained by the following simple argument . taking into account kanamori s improvement  @xcite of the naive stoner criterion for ferromagnetism",
    ", we expect that the crossover temperature @xmath137 can be roughly approximated by @xmath171where @xmath172 is a constant , @xmath173 and @xmath174 is the renormalized effective interaction ( @xmath55 in the case of tpsc ) .",
    "we have already explained in the context of fig .",
    "[ usp_tp ] that the increase with @xmath175 of the weight of the logarithmic singularity in the density of states at the fermi level leads to a decrease of @xmath55 , so the crossover temperature is almost constant in tpsc .     where the maximum of the non - interacting susceptibility is located as a function of next - nearest - neighbor hopping @xmath1 at van hove fillings .",
    "different lines correspond to different temperatures . given @xmath1 and a crossover temperature in the tpsc phase diagram",
    ", one can use the present figure to find out the incommensurate wave - vector at which the instability first occurs . ]    a distinctive feature of the tpsc phase diagram is that the crossover to ferromagnetism generally occurs at much lower temperature than the crossover to antiferromagnetism .",
    "this partially comes from the peculiarity of the temperature dependence of the zero - frequency limit of the non - interacting particle - hole susceptibility . to demonstrate this ,",
    "let us use , as an estimate for the crossover temperatures in tpsc , the rpa criterion eq .",
    "( [ criterion ] ) with @xmath19 replaced by @xmath55 and let us look for values of the temperature when the left - hand side of that equation becomes small ( it will vanish only at zero temperature )",
    ". at small @xmath2 the leading non - interacting staggered susceptibility @xmath131 behaves like @xmath176 with temperature , while for @xmath177 the leading non - interacting uniform susceptibility @xmath178 scales as @xmath179 .",
    "we find that these susceptibilities have comparable size for temperatures @xmath180 , while the divergences of @xmath131 and @xmath181 begin respectively at @xmath182 and @xmath183 .",
    "therefore , since the stoner criterion eq .",
    "( [ criterion ] ) is satisfied in rpa with bare @xmath184 at temperatures",
    "@xmath180 , rpa shows the same temperature scale for ferromagnetism and antiferromagnetism .",
    "but in tpsc the strong renormalization of the interaction strength @xmath185 means that the crossover occurs for larger values of @xmath131 and @xmath178 , in a regime where they already have different scales since @xmath131 for small @xmath175 starts to grow logarithmically at much higher temperature than @xmath181 for large @xmath107 .",
    "thus , the crossover to antiferromagnetism in tpsc occurs at much higher temperatures than the crossover to ferromagnetism .",
    "another interesting feature of the tpsc phase diagram at @xmath22 is that the crossover temperature for antiferromagnetism is of the same order of magnitude as that of the tcrg result of ref .",
    "@xcite , whereas the crossover to ferromagnetism is at much lower temperature than that observed in the tcrg calculations .",
    "the naive explanation is as follows .",
    "let us assume that the approximate mean - field like expression eq .",
    "( [ tc_fm ] ) for @xmath137 has meaning both within tpsc and within tcrg except that @xmath186 has a different value in both approaches .",
    "simple algebra then shows that the relation between the crossover temperatures for tpsc and tcrg in the ferromagnetically fluctuating regime is @xmath187 with @xmath188 characterizing the different renormalizations of @xmath19 in both approaches . when @xmath189 , both crossover temperatures are equal . for @xmath190 the tcrg value for @xmath137 is larger than for tpsc while the reverse is true when @xmath191 .",
    "using the numerical result  @xcite for the tcrg effective interaction at @xmath22 and @xmath192 we have @xmath193 .",
    "then , replacing @xmath172 by the bandwidth @xmath194 and taking @xmath195 corresponding to @xmath196 we obtain the estimate @xmath197 .",
    "this agrees with the crossover temperatures extracted from the tpsc ( fig .",
    "[ tc_tpsc ] ) and the tcrg phase diagrams ( fig .  1 of ref",
    ".  @xcite ) .",
    "similarly in the antiferromagnetically fluctuating regime near @xmath141 , we use the improved mean - field estimate for @xmath137 @xmath198 to extract the following relation between the crossover temperatures @xmath199 using the value  of @xmath55 from the tpsc and the tcrg effective interaction  @xcite at @xmath22 and @xmath200 we have @xmath201 .",
    "this leads to @xmath202 for @xmath203 at @xmath200 , which is in good agreement with the data extracted from the phase diagrams .    as mentioned at the beginning of this subsection ,",
    "the crossover temperatures @xmath137 for the magnetic instabilities in tpsc have been chosen such that the enhancement factor is equal to @xmath139 .",
    "the enhancement factor scales like the square of the correlation length @xmath204 . for such large @xmath204",
    "the value of @xmath137 is rather insensitive to the choice @xmath139 since the correlation length grows exponentially .",
    "our criterion for @xmath137 leads to a good estimate of the real phase transition temperature with @xmath205 when a very small coupling term is added in the third spatial direction .",
    "the dependence of @xmath108 on coupling in the third dimension has been studied , within tpsc , in ref .",
    "the latter reference also contains expressions for the relation between the enhancement factor and @xmath204 . on the other hand",
    ", @xmath137 depends more strongly on the precise criterion if we choose a moderate value of the enhancement factor .",
    "in particular , the tpsc value of @xmath137 in the antiferromagnetic fluctuation region increases by a factor two to five if we choose @xmath206 for the enhancement factor , close to the value  @xcite chosen in ref .",
    "@xcite . in this case",
    ", @xmath137 agrees essentially perfectly with the value obtained in the tcrg phase diagram .",
    "note however that our estimate for the superconducting transition temperature is smaller than that obtained with the tcrg of ref .  @xcite .",
    "because in tpsc the pairing fluctuations do not feed back in the antiferromagnetic fluctuations , this result suggests that the feedback , usually included in tcrg , enhances superconductivity in this region of the phase diagram .",
    "such a positive feedback effect was also found in the rg calculations of refs .",
    "@xcite . on the other hand , the rg approach of ref .",
    "@xcite suggests instead that antiferromagnetism and superconductivity oppose each other .",
    "some particle - particle diagrams were however neglected in the latter approach . in tpsc , antiferromagnetic fluctuations help @xmath25-wave superconductivity as long as they are not strong enough to create a pseudogap , in which case they are detrimental to superconductivity  @xcite .",
    "the above - mentioned renormalization group calculations were done in the one - loop approximation without self - energy effects . by contrast , in the rg work of ref .",
    "@xcite , self - energy effects showing up at two loops were included in the calculation for the @xmath118 model .",
    "there , it was found that dressing the flow equations for afm and superconducting response functions with the one - particle wave vector dependent weight factors @xmath207 results in a reduction of both afm and superconducting correlations , the latter suppression being more pronounced . within tpsc , the momentum- and frequency - dependent self - energy effects that appear in @xmath87 in the pairing susceptibility eq .",
    "( [ suscep_d ] ) do tend to decrease the tendency to pairing when afm fluctuations become very strong at and near half - filling  @xcite , in qualitative agreement with the rg result  @xcite .",
    "in particular , in the presence of an afm - induced pseudogap , the tendency to superconductivity is decreased compared to what it would be if we replaced @xmath87 by @xmath208 everywhere .",
    "( such a replacement is not allowed within our formalism ) .",
    "because of the excellent agreement between tpsc at the first level of approximation and quantum monte carlo calculations  @xcite , momentum and frequency dependent self - energy effects are not expected to be very important for afm fluctuations unless we are deep in the pseudogap regime .",
    "they have not been taken into account at this point .",
    "they might be more important in the case of ferromagnetism , which is already a very weak effect in tpsc .",
    "this is discussed in the following subsection .",
    "the tcrg phase diagram  @xcite is computed at the one - loop level .",
    "self - energy effects occur at the two - loop level .",
    "similarly , self - energy effects in tpsc are calculated at the second level of approximation .",
    "since analytical continuation of imaginary - time results is difficult at low temperature , we estimate the quasiparticle weight with the help of the quantity @xmath209 defined in refs .",
    "@xcite by @xmath210 physically , this quantity is an average of the single - particle spectral weight @xmath211 within @xmath21 of the fermi level ( @xmath212 ) .",
    "when quasiparticles exist , this is a good estimate of the usual zero - temperature quasiparticle renormalization factor @xmath213 .",
    "however , in contrast to the usual @xmath214 , this quantity gives an estimate of the spectral weight @xmath211 around the fermi level , even if quasiparticles disappear and a pseudogap forms .",
    "defined by eq .",
    "( [ z ] ) at the van hove filling corresponding to @xmath215 . ]    fig .",
    "[ z_fig ] shows the quasiparticle renormalization factor @xmath216 at a value @xmath215 where ferromagnetic fluctuations dominate at very low temperatures .",
    "one observes a progressive decrease of @xmath217 with decreasing temperature .",
    "we checked that the single particle spectral function @xmath211 begins to show a small _ pseudogap _ at the temperature where @xmath216 begins to decrease significantly .",
    "since the ferromagnetic fluctuations are not yet strong enough at that temperature to create a pseudogap , this effect is completely driven by the singular density of states at the van hove filling .",
    "in other words , second - order perturbation theory should suffice to observe the effect .",
    "the analogous feature was previously found by one of the authors and his co - workers  @xcite in a second - order perturbation study of the nearest - neighbor two - dimensional hubbard model at half - filling .",
    "self - energy effects near van hove points have also been discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite . the rather strong suppression of spectral weight at the fermi wave vectors for temperatures larger than the crossover temperature found in the previous subsection would probably reduce the true @xmath137 or even completely eliminate the possibility of a ferromagnetic ground state if we could include the feedback of this self - energy effect into the spin susceptibility .",
    "the ferromagnetic fluctuation regime is also very sensitive to doping within tpsc .",
    "in fact , deviations of the filling by @xmath218 away from the van hove filling remove the crossover to the ferromagnetic regime .",
    "there is also an argument that suggests that a stoner - type ferromagnetic ground state is unstable in the two - dimensional hubbard model . within rpa in the ferromagnetic state  @xcite ,",
    "the spin stiffness constant for spin waves in the ferromagnetic state is proportional to minus the second derivative of the density of states at the fermi level  @xcite .",
    "since the density of states as a function of energy ( away from the van hove filling ) has a positive curvature in two dimensions , that leads to a negative spin stiffness constant and thus to an instability .",
    "this argument is based on the non - interacting density of states .",
    "the pseudogap effect mentioned in the previous paragraph changes the curvature of the density of states at the fermi level and may stabilize the ferromagnetic state .",
    "as found within temperature - cutoff renormalization group ( tcrg )  @xcite , tpsc suggests that ferromagnetism may appear in the phase diagram of the 2d @xmath15 hubbard model at van hove fillings for weak to intermediate coupling .",
    "it is striking that the overall phase diagrams of tcrg and tpsc have some close similarities . as in tcrg",
    ", we find , fig .  [ tc_tpsc ] , that for small negative values of the next - nearest - neighbor hopping the leading instability is a spin - density wave with slightly incommensurate antiferromagnetic wave vector ( fig .",
    "[ delta ] ) .",
    "we could find incommensurability at small @xmath2 only for very large lattice sizes .",
    "the tcrg seems to indicate that very close to @xmath141 , the wave vector remains pinned at @xmath219  @xcite but that could be due to the fact that coupling constants in tcrg represent a finite region in wave vector space and hence very small incommensurabilities can not be resolved . for intermediate values of @xmath2",
    "we also find @xmath25-wave superconductivity .",
    "the precise value of @xmath2 for the onset of @xmath25-wave superconductivity depends somewhat on the criterion used for the crossover temperature .",
    "one clear difference with tcrg , however , is that the range of @xmath2 where superconductivity appears increases with @xmath19 whereas it decreases with @xmath19 in tcrg  @xcite . at large @xmath220",
    "a crossover to ferromagnetism occurs as a result of the diverging density of states .",
    "tpsc can not tell us what happens below the crossover temperature , but that temperature is the relevant one in practice since any small coupling in the perpendicular direction would lead to a real phase transition .",
    "the critical value for ferromagnetism , @xmath221 , coincides with that found in tcrg  @xcite .",
    "this value of @xmath2 is smaller than that found within the @xmath9matrix approximation  @xcite , but that may be because of the cutoff to the van hove singularity imposed by the small system sizes used in that approach .",
    "the critical value for ferromagnetism , @xmath222 , also differs from the value @xmath223 obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite in the limit of zero temperature .",
    "we have explained in sec .",

    "@xcite to the value @xmath229 found by us and tcrg .",
    "the differences between tcrg and other approaches , as well as their strengths and weaknesses , are well explained in refs .",
    "the smaller temperature scale for crossover to @xmath25-wave superconductivity in tpsc is a noteworthy difference between our approach and tcrg  @xcite .",
    "this may be due to the fact that our calculations include self - energy effects which are absent  @xcite in one - loop tcrg .",
    "but the most striking difference is the temperature scale for ferromagnetism that in our case remains extremely small away from the critical @xmath222 .",
    "we have shown that the low temperature scale for the crossover to ferromagnetic fluctuations comes from kanamori screening that strongly renormalizes the effective interaction ( this effect is smaller in the antiferromagnetic regime ) . in tpsc",
    "this renormalization comes from the constraint that the spin response function with @xmath55 should satisfy the local moment sum rule , eq .",
    "( [ fd_usp ] ) .",
    "this causes the crossover temperature to ferromagnetic fluctuations to depend weakly on @xmath1 and to remain small . as in the @xmath9matrix approximation  @xcite",
    ", kanamori screening seems much stronger than what is obtained with tcrg .",
    "the latter approach perhaps does not include all the large wave vectors and large energies entering the screening of the effective interaction .    within tpsc",
    "then , the tendency to ferromagnetism seems very fragile .",
    "in addition , we checked that in tpsc ferromagnetism disappears for electron concentrations that are only very slightly ( @xmath218 ) away from van hove fillings , in overall agreement with the results of the tcrg  @xcite .",
    "so the question of the existence of stoner - type ferromagnetism at weak to intermediate coupling is not completely settled yet , despite the positive signs and the concordance of the most reliable approaches .",
    "we have estimated the electronic self - energy effects for large @xmath2 and found that the quasiparticle renormalization factor is reduced significantly at temperatures @xmath230 . as a result ,",
    "the single - particle spectral function @xmath211 starts to show a small pseudogap which , at high temperature , is completely driven by the singular density of states , and not by the ferromagnetic fluctuations that appear only at very low temperature .",
    "this rather strong suppression of spectral weight at the fermi wave vectors for @xmath231 may further reduce @xmath137 or even completely eliminate the crossover to a ferromagnetic ground state .",
    "we have argued in sec .",
    "[ disfavorfm ] that other factors could be detrimental to a ferromagnetic ground state in two dimensions .",
    "in particular , as is the case with rg calculations  @xcite , a consistent treatment of the electronic self - energy effects on the spin response function remains an open issue .",
    "another interesting problem for future investigations is the question of whether ferromagnetism could compete with the pomeranchuk instability , i.e. a spontaneous deformation of the fermi surface reducing its symmetry from the tetragonal to the orthorhombic one .",
