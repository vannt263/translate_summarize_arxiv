    "the recent discovery of a higgs - like resonance at the lhc @xcite , with a mass of approximately @xmath1  gev consistent with electroweak precision observables , has solidified the impressive verification of the standard model ( sm ) at the electroweak scale . at the present time , the couplings of this resonance agree on average rather well with those of the sm higgs boson .    the lack of hints for new physics ( np ) in other channels has focused attention on the detailed properties of the higgs - like resonance , and deviations from the sm in its decays to various final states . indeed , while the lhc now strongly constrains np that can be produced either resonantly or in pairs from proton constituents with well - identifiable final states  e.g .",
    ", @xmath2 bosons decaying to leptons , or squark / gluino decays to jets , leptons and missing energy  np produced via electroweak interactions or other weakly coupled hidden sectors is far less constrained .",
    "the latter possibilities are now coming under additional scrutiny as possible explanations for small @xmath3 deviations from the sm in certain higgs production / decay channels @xcite , specifically , the apparent enhancement in the diphoton branching br@xmath4  @xcite and a possible suppression of decays to dileptons in br@xmath5 .",
    "although these deviations are small and may well dissipate with more data , they motivate the exploration of viable models of np that could provide an explanation .",
    "the recent literature has focused on br@xmath4 and noted that relatively light ( typically sub 300  gev ) electromagnetically charged fields that are vector - like ( vl ) , i.e. , with a contribution to their mass which does not come from electroweak symmetry breaking , can lead to the required enhancement while still being accessible with sufficient statistics at the lhc @xcite .",
    "exploration of higgs interactions in this way will be an important probe of np in coming years , and thus it is important to clarify the full range of interactions that allow for measurable corrections to the higgs branching rates , and the interplay with other precision data , particularly in the yukawa sector . in this paper",
    ", we ask whether new vl thresholds contributing to sizable deviations from sm higgs branching can also provide new sources of @xmath0 and flavor violation @xcite . in sec .",
    "[ sec : edm ] , building on @xcite we focus on the @xmath0-odd operator @xmath6 , and elucidate the connection between the @xmath0-violating higgs decay amplitude and the impressive constraints on the electric dipole moments ( edms ) of elementary particles @xcite .",
    "we find that the inferred bound on the edm of the electron @xcite does not allow for significant @xmath0-odd contributions to the higgs diphoton decay at the level of this dimension - five operator .",
    "we then consider two uv completions involving vl fermions and/or singlets , and identify a special case where the higgs is nearly degenerate with a singlet scalar that allows for large @xmath0-odd contributions to the diphoton decay that can escape edm bounds . in sec .",
    "[ sec : flavor ] , we turn our attention to the @xmath7 operators contributing to dilepton decays , and consider the benchmark sensitivity from lepton flavor - violating ( lfv ) observables and edms .",
    "section  [ sec : conclusions ] contains some concluding remarks .",
    "consider new physics charged under su(2)@xmath8u(1 ) only , so that the leading dimension - six operators which correct the diphoton branching ratio of the higgs are @xmath9 here @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12  gev and we have only retained the @xmath13 operators , disregarding couplings to @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "since we focus on corrections that are sizable for loop - induced couplings to the photon , the associated corrections to the tree - level @xmath16 and @xmath17 couplings can be consistently ignored .",
    "properties of the @xmath16 and @xmath17 couplings , see , e.g. ,  @xcite and references therein . ] for thresholds in the tev range or above , measurement of the higgs decay rate itself probably provides the best sensitivity to @xmath18",
    ". however , edms can provide sensitivity to the @xmath0-odd threshold @xmath19 .",
    "the ensuing correction to the sm @xmath20 width , _ ^sm = ( ) ^2| |^2 9.1  kev , takes the form r _",
    "= |1-c_h|^2 + |_h|^2 , where @xmath21 is proportional to the sm amplitude @xcite .",
    "the deviations in the width are of @xmath22 for @xmath23  tev .",
    "note that since the @xmath0-odd operator does not interfere with the sm amplitude , the corresponding correction to the diphoton branching ratio is necessarily positive and scales as @xmath24 .",
    "current experiments @xcite already probe the edms of elementary particles at a level roughly commensurate with two - loop electroweak diagrams @xcite , with the chirality of light particles protected by factors of @xmath25 . thus it is useful to introduce the auxiliary quantity @xmath26 that quantifies this two - loop benchmark edm scale , d^(2l)_f d^(2l)_e 2.510",
    "^ -27  e. one observes that @xmath27 has already been surpassed by the current electron edm limits @xcite , with the mercury @xcite and neutron @xcite edms not lagging far behind for @xmath28 @xcite .    the @xmath0-odd higgs operator ( [ leff ] ) generates fermionic edms via a higgs - photon loop ( as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : edm_diags ] ) , @xmath29 with explicit dependence on the uv scale @xmath30 .",
    "if this scale is identified with @xmath31 , then using the current bound on the electron edm , @xmath32 cm @xcite , we find 50 tev . translating this to the higgs diphoton branching ratio results in the conclusion that @xmath0-odd corrections are limited by r_(c_h ) 1.610 ^ -4 .",
    "however , this conclusion can be relaxed in specific uv completions . as we discuss in the next subsection",
    ", the logarithm @xmath33 can not generally be stretched all the way to 50 tev , as the loops of vl charged particles provide a much lower cutoff , while certain degeneracies may provide more significant qualitative changes to the implications of edm limits .",
    "we will now consider a specific uv completion which allows the full two - loop function to be taken into account for the electron edm .",

    "we retain only the photon contribution of the @xmath44 vector current , as the @xmath14 contribution is suppressed by the small value of @xmath45 .",
    "after the breaking of @xmath46 , the @xmath47 field mixes with what would be the sm higgs boson @xmath48 to produce two mass eigenstates @xmath49 and @xmath50 , @xmath51 where @xmath52 ( @xmath53 ) stands for @xmath54 ( @xmath55 ) . both mass eigenstates inherit higgs - like interactions with the sm fields and couplings to @xmath34 fermions .",
    "the dominant two - loop contribution to fermion edms is well - known @xcite , and specializing to our case we arrive at the following result for the electron edm as a function of @xmath56 , @xmath57 , and @xmath35 : [ 2loopsh ] d_f = d_f^(2l ) q_ps .",
    "^2_s ( 2 ) , where the loop function is given by g(z ) = _ 0 ^ 1 dx ( ) , [ eq : g ] which satisfies @xmath58 and @xmath59 for large @xmath60 .",
    "we show the feynman diagram responsible for this contribution on the right of fig .",
    "[ fig : edm_diags ] .",
    "it is instructive to consider different limits of ( [ 2loopsh ] ) .",
    "when @xmath61 , to logarithmic accuracy @xmath62 , where @xmath63 is the smaller of @xmath64 and @xmath35 .",
    "in this limit , the heavy fields can be integrated out sequentially , with @xmath50 and @xmath34 first , and @xmath49 second .",
    "the first step is simplified by the use of the chiral anomaly equation for @xmath34 , @xmath65 .",
    "this leads to the following identification : = ;   _ uv ( m_s , m _ ) .",
    "apart from a smaller value for the logarithmic cutoff , the result in this limit differs little from the contact operator case above .",
    "even if the value of the logarithm is not enhanced , @xmath66 , the corrections to the higgs diphoton rate will be limited to at most the sub - percent level unless a fine - tuned cancellation of @xmath67 is arranged with some other @xmath0-odd source .",
    "we now consider a different near - degenerate limit , @xmath68 , which turns out to be more interesting as it allows the edm constraints to be bypassed .",
    "if the difference between the masses is small , we can approximate ( 2)(m_s^2-m_h^2 ) 2av , and the edm becomes @xmath69 where in the final step we made use of the large @xmath35 limit .    the limiting case ( [ limit2 ] ) receives no logarithmic enhancement .",
    "moreover , the value of the @xmath70 parameter can be very small , comparable to the mass splitting between @xmath49 and @xmath50 or less .",
    "an @xmath71 mass splitting would naturally place @xmath72 in the @xmath73 range , suppressing the edm safely below the bound .",
    "at the same time , as explicitly shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , modifications to the @xmath74 rate can be significant , and enhancement can come from the @xmath75 amplitude . unlike corrections to the @xmath76 amplitudes that can enhance or suppress the effective rate , the @xmath0-odd channel always adds to @xmath77 . assuming that the mass difference between the singlet and the higgs is small enough that they can not be separately resolved ( which requires @xmath78  gev with current statistics  @xcite ) ,",
    "the apparent increase in the diphoton rate in this model is @xmath79 if @xmath57 is in the range @xmath80 and @xmath81 then @xmath77 simplifies to a @xmath57-independent expression , @xmath82 the rate for the weak eigenstate @xmath37 to decay to two photons via its pseudoscalar coupling to the vl fermions is @xmath83 with @xmath84 for large @xmath35 the apparent diphoton increase can then be expressed as @xmath85 a sizable increase in the apparent diphoton rate is seen to require rather large yukawa couplings or light vl fermions .",
    "the vl leptons must be heavier than 105  gev to avoid limits from lep .",
    "their decay channels are fairly model - dependent but they are well within the reach of the lhc if they are at all relevant for the @xmath86 rate . for more discussion on experimental searches for such vl fermions ,",
    "see  @xcite .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : r_vs_edm ] we show the relationship between the electron edm and the enhancement to the higgs diphoton rate that comes from the operator @xmath87 for both the contact operator and nearly degenerate singlet cases . in the case of the contact operator ,",
    "we show two cutoffs , @xmath88  gev and 1  tev . as seen in sec .",
    "[ sec : contact_op_lim ] , it is apparent that in this simple situation , any appreciable increase in the @xmath86 rate must be accompanied by a value of the electron edm that is in conflict with the present experimental limit .",
    "we also show the relationship between @xmath89 and @xmath67 in the singlet case for two values of the mixing angle , @xmath90 and @xmath91 , fixing the pseudoscalar yukawa to @xmath92 and choosing @xmath93 .",
    "different values of @xmath89 and @xmath67 then correspond to different values of @xmath35 .",
    "it is now apparent that a sizable increase in the effective diphoton rate can be obtained in this model without inducing a value of the electron edm that is presently excluded , demonstrating a uv completion of the effective interaction that evades the constraints implied by a simple analysis of this contact operator .",
    "the reason that the edm constraints are evaded in this case is clear : mixing of the two fields , @xmath48 and @xmath37 , due to the small mass difference can proceed rather efficiently even with a small value of @xmath70 , while the edm loop diagrams do not enjoy the same resonant enhancement . in this model , for fixed @xmath89 , @xmath67 increases with increasing @xmath94 and @xmath95 . the rough upper limit on @xmath94 of around 3",
    "gev with current data implies an upper limit on @xmath67 of @xmath96  cm for @xmath97 . separately resolving a degeneracy near 125  gev or limiting",
    "the size of a potential mass splitting with more data clearly has important implications for edm searches .",
    "another simple uv completion is a full vl generation of sm - like fields @xmath98 and @xmath99 , with their mirror image fields @xmath100 and @xmath101 , [ el ] -l_el ( |e_l ,   |l_l ) (    cc m_e & y_1 h + y_2 h^ * & m_l    ) (    ce_r + l_r    ) + h.c .    every entry in this mass matrix , @xmath102 , can be complex .",

    "<S> new physics thresholds which can modify the diphoton and dilepton higgs branching ratios significantly may also provide new sources of @xmath0 and lepton flavor violation . we find that limits on electric dipole moments impose strong constraints on any @xmath0-odd contributions to higgs diphoton decays unless there are degeneracies in the higgs sector that enhance @xmath0-violating mixing . </S>",
    "<S> we exemplify this point in the language of effective operators and in simple uv - complete models with vector - like fermions . </S>",
