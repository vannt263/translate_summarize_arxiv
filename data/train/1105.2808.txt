    "<S> we report on a systematic study of the density dependence of mobility in a low - density carbon - doped ( 100 ) gaas two - dimensional hole system ( 2dhs ) . at t=50mk , a mobility of 2.6 @xmath0 10@xmath1 @xmath2/vs at a density p=6.2 </S>",
    "<S> @xmath0 10@xmath3 @xmath4 was measured . </S>",
    "<S> this is the highest mobility reported for a 2dhs to date . using a back - gated sample geometry , </S>",
    "<S> the density dependence of mobility was studied from 2.8 @xmath0 10@xmath3 @xmath4 to 1 @xmath0 10@xmath5 @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> the mobility vs. density can not be fit to a power law dependence of the form @xmath6 @xmath7 p@xmath8 using a single exponent @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> our data indicate a continuous evolution of the power law with @xmath9 ranging from @xmath7 0.7 at high density and increasing to @xmath7 1.7 at the lowest densities measured . </S>",
    "<S> calculations specific to our structure indicate a crossover of the dominant scattering mechanism from uniform background impurity scattering at high density to remote ionized impurity scattering at low densities . </S>",
    "<S> this is the first observation of a carrier density - induced transition from background impurity dominated to remote dopant dominated transport in a single sample .    </S>",
    "<S> the two - dimensional hole system ( 2dhs ) offers an attractive platform for the study of strong carrier interactions parameterized by @xmath10 : the ratio of the coulomb energy to the fermi energy . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the hole density and @xmath13 is the effective mass . </S>",
    "<S> recent developments in the growth of carbon - doped ( 100 ) gaas heterostructures by molecular beam epitaxy ( mbe ) have resulted in 2dhss of unprecedented quality @xcite@xmath14 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> such structures have been utilized in the study the metal - to - insulator transition ( mit ) @xcite , fractional quantum hall physics in the 2nd landau level ( ll)@xcite , spin - orbit coupling in aharonov bohm rings @xcite and charge density wave formation in partially filled lls@xcite@xmath14@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these initial experiments and the prospect of studying strong correlations in the presence of tunable spin - orbit coupling provide strong motivation to understand the scattering processes presently limiting mobility in the highest quality samples . here </S>",
    "<S> we present mobility vs.  density data on an unprecedently high mobilty 2dhs . </S>",
    "<S> one of the most exciting avenues for future research is the investigation of ultra - low density 2dhss at very large @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , our data and calculations will inform the design of new hole heterostructures of ever increasing quality .    </S>",
    "<S> carbon doping@xcite of 2dhss offers advantages over the more commonly used acceptor dopants beryllium and silicon . </S>",
    "<S> carbon diffuses and surface segregates much less at typical mbe growth temperatures ( t@xmath7630 @xmath15c ) than beryllium@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> additionally carbon can be incorporated as an acceptor on multiple crystallographic orientations , including on the high - symmetry ( 100 ) face of gaas . </S>",
    "<S> silicon can also act as an acceptor to produce high quality 2dhss but so far high mobility ( @xmath16 @xmath17/vs ) silicon - doped 2dhss have only been realized on ( 311)a face@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the ( 311)a face has a well known mobility anisotropy between the [ @xmath18 and [ @xmath19 directions @xcite whereas carbon - doped structures on the ( 100 ) face have a significantly lower anisotropy between the [ @xmath20 and [ @xmath21 directions @xcite . furthermore , the high symmetry of the ( 100 ) orientation dramatically alters the nature of spin - orbit interactions in 2dhss as compared to quantization along the ( 311)a direction . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , further experimental work is needed to fully exploit the potential benefits of carbon - doped ( 100 ) 2dhss .    </S>",
    "<S> our sample consists of a 20 nm al@xmath22ga@xmath23as / gaas / al@xmath22ga@xmath23as quantum well asymmetrically modulation doped with carbon at a density of 1 @xmath0 10@xmath24 @xmath4 above the quantum well at a setback of 80 nm . </S>",

    "<S> the superlattice and buffer regions are truncated .        in order to modulate the density in the quantum </S>",
    "<S> well , we utilized a back - gate geometry . </S>",
    "<S> the sample was first thinned to approximately 150 @xmath6 m and then cleaved into a hall bar approximately 2 mm @xmath0 9 mm . </S>",
    "<S> ohmic contacts consist of in / zn dots positioned approximately 1 mm apart along the length of the hall bar and annealed at t = 430 @xmath15c . </S>",
    "<S> the hall bar was subsequently fixed to a gold backgate evaporated on an undoped gaas substrate . </S>",
    "<S> the carrier density was measured from minima in the longitudinal magnetoresistance , and the conductivity was obtained from four - terminal zero field measurements using standard lock - in techniques . as shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ vg ] , the 2dhs density depended linearly on voltage over the range measured . </S>",
    "<S> modeling the structure as a parallel plate capacitor with one plate being the 2dhs and the other being the backgate we estimate the gate to be situated 175 @xmath6 m from the well . </S>",
    "<S> the peak mobility @xmath6 at low temperature ( t = 50 mk ) was measured to be 2.6 @xmath0 10@xmath1 @xmath2/vs at a density of 6.2 @xmath0 10@xmath3 @xmath4 in an as - grown sample .        </S>",
    "<S> fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ vg ] also shows the leakage current as a function of the gate voltage . </S>",
    "<S> the linear dependence of the leakage current on the gate voltage and its small magnitude ( @xmath25 1.5 na as compared to an excitation current of 50 na ) suggest that the observed leakage represents parasitic current passing through the measurement circuit and not hard breakdown in the gaas . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , the linear dependence of the density on the gate voltage also suggests that sharp breakdown did not occur . </S>",
    "<S> fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ mr ] shows a representative trace of the magnetoresistance at t = 50 mk . </S>",
    "<S> the deep minima in the fractional quantum hall states around filling factor @xmath26 illustrate the high quality of the processed sample . </S>",
    "<S> we note that this sample has also been studied at ultra - low temperatures ( t @xmath27 10 mk ) in which the first evidence of a fully formed fractional quantum hall state at @xmath28 in the 2nd landau level in a 2dhs was observed @xcite .        in order to examine the scattering mechanisms limiting mobility in our system , we measured the dependence of the mobility on the 2d hole density modulated by the backgate as shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ n_v_mu ] . </S>",
    "<S> as can be clearly seen on this log - log plot the data points do not fall on a straight line as would be expected for a single dominant scattering mechanism . </S>",
    "<S> the mobility vs. density can not be fit to a power law dependence of the form @xmath6 </S>",
    "<S> @xmath7 p@xmath8 using a single exponent @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> our data indicate a continuous evolution of the power law with @xmath9 ranging from @xmath7 0.7 at high density and increasing to @xmath71.7 at the lowest densities measured . </S>",
    "<S> thus the data indicate the presence of multiple dominant scattering mechanisms over the range of density tested . </S>",
    "<S> indeed at the lowest densities measured , the mobility decreases rapidly indicating that the system will eventually approach a finite density mit@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we emphasize , however , that @xmath29 , the product of the fermi wavevector and the mean free path , remains larger than 50 over the entire range of density tested . </S>",
    "<S> it can be seen at high density that the mobility follows a power law behavior @xmath30 which is indicative of uniformly distributed charged background impurity ( bi ) scattering @xcite@xmath14 @xcite in 2d carrier systems .         in @xmath31 . </S>",
    "<S> ( b ) comparison of experimental mobility data and theoretical results . </S>",
    "<S> solid line represents rpa - boltzmann calculation and dashed line represents rpa - boltzmann calculation with the hubbard approximation in both plots.,width=288 ]    however , the power law continuously shifts towards higher @xmath9 of approximately 1.7 at low density . </S>",
    "<S> typically , an exponent @xmath32 is taken as an indication of the dominance of remote ionized ( ri ) impurity scattering@xcite@xmath33@xcite originating in the remote doping layer in 2d systems . </S>",
    "<S> we emphasize that it is unusual that such a crossover behavior can be seen in a single sample while remaining in the high mobility ( or equivalently large @xmath29 ) regime . </S>",
    "<S> it is interesting to note that our setback distance is 80 nm , a distance at which remote ionized impurity scattering usually makes a relatively minor contribution to the total scattering in samples with density @xmath34 @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , it is clear that for the material parameters of our structure it dominates scattering at lower density . </S>",
    "<S> a similar transition to remote ionized impurity scattering in low density 2d electron samples was report by jiang et al . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , but in these samples @xmath29 was substantially lower and the samples were approaching a conduction threshold . </S>",
    "<S> unusual transport behavior was also recently reported in the 2dhs in an undoped electron - hole bilayer @xcite and subsequently explained by carrier inhomogeneities resulting from strong carrier - carrier interactions and non - linear screening @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it could be argued that t = 300 mk data is only marginally outside the range where phonons could be playing some role , but the fact that our t = 50 mk data displays the same functional dependence seems to rule out any critical scattering contributions from phonons . </S>",
    "<S> interface roughness ( ir ) scattering should also be considered , but significant ir scattering should also manifest itself in a significant mobility anisotropy @xcite which was not observed in our sample . finally , scattering between the light and heavy hole bands@xcite as well as changes in the effective mass @xcite have also been reported . </S>",
    "<S> however , both of these effects should decrease as the density is lowered and the fermi level moves towards the top of the valence band and away from light hole band .    to explain our experimental observation we calculated the coulomb scattering rate due to background charged impurity scattering and remote charged impurity scattering using a boltzmann transport method@xcite@xmath14 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> screening was taken into account using the random phase approximation ( rpa ) . </S>",
    "<S> the calculation was performed both with and without the inclusion of correlation effects via the hubbard approximation . </S>",
    "<S> the analysis assumed a 3d background impurity concentration of @xmath35 @xmath36 , dopant setback from the center of the quantum well @xmath37 nm , hole effective mass @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the free electron mass , quantum well width @xmath40 nm , and a remote ionized impurity concentration @xmath41 @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ theory](a ) shows a crossover of the mobility exponent changing from @xmath42 to @xmath43 which has the same qualitative behavior as seen in the data in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ n_v_mu ] . </S>",
    "<S> the results of the calculations are compared with the experimental data in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ theory](b ) . </S>",
    "<S> qualitatively , as the hole density is lowered , screening of the remote dopants by the 2d hole gas becomes less effective , and the dominant scattering mechanism transitions from being dominated by uniform background impurities to being dominated by remote dopants . </S>",
    "<S> such a transition point in the density is governed entirely by @xmath44 , @xmath45 , and @xmath46 , and thus it is not surprising that this is the first time ( to our knowledge ) that such a transition has been observed in a single sample within the high mobility regime .    to understand the transition in the transport mechanism observed in our data , it is important to realize@xcite that the impurity scattering strength in the transport theory carries the form - factor @xmath47 at low temperatures where @xmath48 is the typical momentum transfer for resistive scattering by impurities , and @xmath45 is the typical separation of the impurities from the 2d carrier layer . since @xmath49 , it is clear that lowering the carrier density would lead to stronger scattering by remote impurities which is exponentially suppressed at higher values of @xmath50 . for a screened coulomb potential with two impurity contributions </S>",
    "<S> ( remote and background charged impurity ) we can derive the approximate qualitative formula for the mobility @xmath51 where @xmath52 is a density independent constant and @xmath53 is the thomas fermi screening wave vector with the effective bohr radius @xmath54 . in the high - density limit , </S>",
    "<S> @xmath55 the mobility is proportional to the square of the sum of two wave vectors , i.e. , @xmath56 . </S>",
    "<S> however , as @xmath57 ( or , density ) decreases the mobility behaves approximately @xmath58 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , as long as strong localization does not set in , which is the usual situation for lower mobility samples@xcite , lowering carrier density should always lead to a continuous increase of the exponent @xmath9 as scattering from the remote dopant impurities becomes important . </S>",
    "<S> this is exactly the theoretical behavior predicted in the theory ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ n_v_mu ] ) , and experimentally observed in our extremely high - mobility hole sample .    in conclusion , we measured the density dependence of mobility in a very high quality 2dhs . </S>",
    "<S> the 50 mk mobility was found to be 2.6 @xmath0 10@xmath59 @xmath17/vs at a density of 6.2 @xmath0 10@xmath3 @xmath4 in a pristine sample . </S>",
    "<S> the mobility appears to be limited by background charged impurity scattering at high density but in the low density regime is a stronger function of the density indicating an increasingly important scattering contribution from remote impurities . from this data </S>",
    "<S> , we can surmise that increased 2dhs mobility can be realized at low density by significantly increasing the spacer thickness . </S>",
    "<S> such experiments are currently underway . </S>",
    "<S> our work also demonstrates that in samples of sufficiently high quality , where the 2d mit transition is pushed down to very low carrier densities , the theoretically predicted continuous transition from background impurity scattering limited transport to remote dopant scattering limited transport can be quantitatively verified by decreasing the carrier density in a single sample . </S>"
