    "the influence of the pressure ( @xmath15 ) on thermodynamic properties of the superconducting state is one of more interesting issues in the solid state physics .    in the case of simple - metal superconductors with the electron - phonon pairing mechanism for a long time",
    "there was conviction , that the increase of the pressure leads to the decrease of the critical temperature ( @xmath1 ) and the remaining thermodynamic parameters do not demonstrate interesting properties @xcite .",
    "the change took place in the last years when in some of the classical materials the pressure - induced superconducting state of relatively high critical temperature was discovered , for example : in lithium @xmath16_{\\rm max}\\simeq 14 $ ] k for @xmath17 gpa and in calcium , where @xmath16_{\\rm max}\\simeq 25 $ ] k for @xmath18 gpa @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the obtained results are keeping an eye on the metallic hydrogen again , where the existence of the pressure - induced superconducting state with the very high value of the critical temperature ( comparable with the value of the room temperature ) was expected @xcite . from the theoretical point of view",
    "the following facts enable to make the above assumption true @xcite : ( i ) high value of the phonon frequency caused by a small mass of atomic nuclei building the crystal lattice ( single proton ) , ( ii ) large value of the electron - phonon coupling related to the lack of the inner electronic shells and ( iii ) low value of the coulomb pseudopotential ( at least in the range of pressures up to @xmath19 gpa @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "since the time of publishing the ashcroft s work it is stated that the value of @xmath1 for metallic hydrogen is located in the range from @xmath20 k to @xmath21 k for selected pressures lesser than @xmath19 gpa @xcite , @xcite , @xcite . under the extremely high pressure ( @xmath22 gpa ) the metallic state of the hydrogen may transit itself into the superconducting state in the range of the temperatures from @xmath23 k to @xmath24 k @xcite , @xcite .",
    "let us note that in this case the thermodynamic properties of the superconducting state strongly deviate from the predictions of the bcs theory @xcite .    in the range of the `` low '' pressures ( up to @xmath19 gpa ) the thermodynamic properties outside the critical temperature were not studied . for that reason we will calculate the selected thermodynamic parameters of the superconducting state in the molecular metallic hydrogen for the exemplary pressure of @xmath0 gpa . in particular , in the framework of the eliashberg approach @xcite",
    ", we will determine the value of the critical temperature as a function of the coulomb pseudopotential .",
    "next , we will exactly calculate the order parameter ( @xmath25 ) and the wave function renormalization factor . on the basis of obtained results the ratio @xmath7 as a function of the coulomb pseudopotential and the maximum value of the electron effective mass will be determined .",
    "additionally , in the paper , the relationship between the structure of the electron - phonon coupling and the form of the solutions to the eliashberg equations along the real axis will be discussed .",
    "the eliashberg equations can be determined on the real axis , imaginary axis or in the mixed representation ( simultaneously on the real and imaginary axis ) .",
    "each of the mentioned approaches have the unique advantages , but also come with the characteristic mathematical problems .",
    "the exact solution of the eliashberg equations on the real axis composes an extremely difficult mathematical problem @xcite . from the other side ,",
    "the eliahberg equations on the imaginary axis can be solved in a simpler way @xcite . however , in this case in order to interpret physically the obtained results ( e.g. to calculate the value of the energy gap near the temperature of zero kelvin ) the achieved solutions should be analytically continued on the real axis .",
    "unfortunately , the procedure of the analytical continuation is complicated and it demands very high precision during the numerical calculations @xcite .",
    "it is worth mentioning , that the results obtained in a such way are stable only in the range of the low frequencies .",
    "the eliashberg equations in the mixed representation are proclaimed to be a reasonable compromise between the two previously mentioned approaches .",
    "firstly , they can be exactly solved in the much simpler way than equations on the real axis .",
    "secondly , the obtained results are stable even for the very large values of the frequency . in the case of molecular metallic hydrogen",
    "it is an important matter , because the maximum phonon frequency ( @xmath26 ) is equal to @xmath27 mev @xcite .",
