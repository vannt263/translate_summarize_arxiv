    "the average absorption cross section in the gdr is given by @xmath115 here we assume that the gdr width @xmath116 to be used in the sum of the three lorentzians depends on the resonance energy @xmath117 only , in contrast to earlier descriptions  @xcite . the photon energy @xmath50 is given in mev and @xmath118 in fm@xmath112 .",

    "the value @xmath123 = 1.6 was derived from the one - body dissipation model  @xcite and the proportionality parameter stems from a fit to many nuclei including axially as well as triaxially deformed nuclei where the gdr is split into three components with well defined distances from the centroid and relative intensities . we generalize this by using the proposed  @xcite power law dependence for different nuclei and thus reduce the number of parameters for the description of the gdr s by relating the spreading width in all nuclei with mass @xmath121 to the respective resonance energy of their gdr .",
    "it is stressed here again that the lorentzian photon strength function @xmath124 is parameterized in each nucleus by a constant spreading width @xmath125 @xmath126 depending on the photon energy .",

    "[ fig : sm - gp - ga - yield ] are mainly the statistical uncertainties .",

    "to summarize , this paper presents the photodisintegration of @xmath137sm to four exit channels . the @xmath138sm(@xmath1,n )",
    "reaction yield has been compared to the yield calculated using cross sections from previous photoneutron experiments and a comparison of the two data sets leads to a conclusion on the inaccuracies in previous data .",

    "the activation yield for all the photodisintegration reactions has been compared with talys and non - smoker models . in general ,",
    "the experimental activation yields agree within a factor of 2 to the simulated yield using statistical model predictions . in view of the fact , that the codes non - smoker and talys are based on the same theory - the hauser - feshbach model , eventual differences appearing in the model predictions are strongly related to their nuclear physics inputs .",
    "the effect of using different photon strength functions in the talys model calculations has been discussed here . for the @xmath0sm(@xmath1,@xmath10)reaction",
    ", the statistical model description faces the additional problem of the possible emission of low energy photons prior to the alpha emission . in a forthcoming paper",
    "the respective data for @xmath0sm will be presented together with results for a different mass region , and the proper treatment of that process by the two codes will be examined .",
    "the new proposed phenomenological parametrization describes very well the photoneutron cross section data for sm isotopes .",
    "a similar investigation has been performed for the stable even isotopes of mo and same effects has been observed  @xcite .",
    "it is thus worthwhile to point out again that this new fit only needs a very limited number of fit parameters to describe the electric dipole strength in all nuclei with @xmath135 , for which nuclear photoeffect data exist .",
