    "<S> [ fig2](b ) , feature the _ same _ characteristics previously obtained within our minimal model .    in conclusion , we proposed a new mechanism for realizing a topological superconductor which neither involves helical states nor helical magnetic fields . instead , the hybrid system that we suggest is based on an array of antiferromagnetically ordered magnetic atoms deposited on the surface of a conventional superconductor , where edge majorana fermions controllably arise from shiba states . </S>",
    "<S> such atomic afm chains on metallic substrates have already been fabricated and manipulated . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , stm techniques can be used for performing spin - polarized zero - bias anomaly spectroscopy which can resolve the electronic spin texture of the majorana wavefunctions . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , the edge spin - polarization can be reversed by changing the length of the chain by a _ </S>",
    "<S> single _ atom . </S>",
    "<S> the latter property is robust and can herald the emergence of mfs . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , our device can be finely controlled by the combination of supercurrents and _ weak _ magnetic fields , offering a rich test ground for experiments . </S>",
    "<S> the enhanced functionality can make the setup also attractive for applications of majorana fermions for quantum information processing . </S>",
    "<S> finally , our proposal can be extended to a setup where the afm order is established by nano - magnets @xcite or to materials which already exhibit a microscopic coexistence of superconductivity and intrinsic antiferromagnetism such as fe-@xcite or ce-@xcite based superconductors .    </S>",
