    "x - ray observations of the latest outburst of rs oph @xcite have allowed to clearly identify the forward shock wave expanding into the red giant ( rg ) wind and to estimate the time evolution of its velocity , @xmath0 , through the well - known relation for a test - particle strong shock : @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the boltzmann constant , @xmath3 is the measured postshock temperature and @xmath4 is the mean particle mass .",
    "the x - ray emission has revealed that after an ejecta - dominated , free expansion stage lasting @xmath56  days , the remnant rapidly evolved to display behavior characteristic of a shock experiencing significant radiative cooling .",
    "the lack or the very short duration of an adiabatic , sedov - taylor phase differs from the remnant evolution model developed after the 1985 outburst ( see * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "the time - dependence of shock velocity has also been measured by ir spectroscopy @xcite .",
    "although the general behavior of the shock evolution was found to be consistent with that deduced from the x - ray emission , the shock velocities determined from the ir data are significantly greater than those obtained using equation  ( 1 ) together with the x - ray measurements of @xmath3 ( see fig .",
    "we have shown that production of nonthermal particles by diffusive shock acceleration at the blast wave can account for these observations @xcite .",
    "we have proposed that the difference of shock velocities deduced from the ir and x - ray data is due to the use of equation  ( 1 ) , which is known to underestimate @xmath0 when particle acceleration is efficient @xcite .",
    "the observed early cooling of the blast wave is explained by the escape of high - energy particles from the acceleration region , which we found to be much more effective to cool the shock than radiative losses .",
    "thus , nonlinear diffusive shock acceleration has important implications for the evolution of the nova remnant .",
    "the rg wind density can be estimated from both the photoelectric absorption of the postshock x - rays and the free - free absorption of the radio synchrotron emission , which presumably arises from electron acceleration at the blast wave . using the absorbing column density @xmath6 measured with",
    "the _ swift _ x - ray telescope @xcite , and assuming the abundances in the rg wind to be solar ( see wallerstein et al . , these proceedings ) , we obtain from equation  ( 4 ) of @xcite : @xmath7  g  @xmath8 , where @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the rg mass - loss rate and wind terminal speed , respectively .",
    "it is noteworthy that the values of @xmath6 are still uncertain , because they were determined by rough single - temperature fits @xcite .    to calculate the optical depth to radio free - free absorption",
    ", we use the formula derived by @xcite , which allows for the effects of h recombination in the stellar wind . for @xmath11",
    "g  @xmath8 and a uniform wind temperature @xmath12 in the range ( 13)@xmath13  k , we find the time of free - free optical depth unity at 6.03  ghz to be 2030  days .",
    "this result is consistent with the broad peak of radio emission observed with the very large array ( vla ) and merlin after @xmath14  days , but is inconsistent with the early rapid rise of radio emission detected at days 4 and 5 after outburst ( eyres et al . , these proceedings ) . if this early emission is associated with the blast wave expanding at @xmath15  km  s@xmath16 ( fig .",
    "1a ) , it implies @xmath17  g  @xmath8 . from gmrt observations at frequencies @xmath18  ghz , @xcite obtained @xmath19  g  @xmath8 .",
    "however , the x - ray- and radio - based estimates of the rg wind density could be reconciled if the first early peak of radio emission is associated with a synchrotron jet expanding much faster than the blast wave ( see obrien et al . and",
    "rupen et al . , these proceedings ) .",
    "the effects of particle acceleration at the blast wave depend on the strength of the magnetic field just ahead of the shock , @xmath20 .",
    "assuming the magnetic field in the rg wind to be in equipartition with the thermal energy density , we have @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is a factor accounting for a possible amplification of the magnetic field in the shock region and @xmath23 is the shock radius . here and in the following ,",
    "we adopt @xmath24 , @xmath25  g  @xmath8 and @xmath26  k , which give @xmath27  g at @xmath28 . with such values of @xmath20",
    ", we have shown @xcite that accelerated electrons and protons can have achieved tev energies in few days after outburst .    to study the modification of the shock structure induced by the backreaction of the energetic ions , we use the model of nonlinear diffusive shock acceleration developed by @xcite , with the prescription of @xcite for the particle injection .",
    "calculated temperatures of the postshock gas are shown in fig .",
    "1b for two values of the parameter @xmath29 , which is the fraction of postshock thermal protons injected into the acceleration process .",
    "the other parameters of the model are as in @xcite .",
    "we see that the temperatures measured with _",
    "rxte _ and _ swift _ can be well reproduced with @xmath29=1.5@xmath3010@xmath31 . for @xmath29=10@xmath32 ,",
    "the test - particle approximation applies and the standard relation between @xmath0 and @xmath3 ( eq .  [ 1 ] ) overestimates the temperature .",
    "the model also provides the shock compression ratio and acceleration efficiency .",
    "we find that the energy carried off by high - energy particles escaping the shock region represents 10%20% of the total energy flux at @xmath33 .",
    "; _ solid curve _ : @xmath34 ( see text ) .",
    "[ fig2],width=294 ]    we compare in fig .",
    "2 calculated x - ray fluxes with the _ rxte _ and _ swift _ data of @xcite and @xcite , respectively .",
    "using theoretical emissivities from the mekal plasma emission model and calculated values of @xmath3 and the postshock density from the nonlinear shock acceleration model , we determine the characteristic emission volume , @xmath35 , required to reproduce the measured fluxes .",
    "we assume the relative thickness of the x - ray emitting shell to be of the form @xmath36 where @xmath37 and @xmath38 are free parameters .",
    "the two curves shown in fig .  2 are for @xmath39 and @xmath34 .",
    "the first value corresponds to an adiabatic expansion of the shock wave .",
    "it is clear that the observed flux evolution implies a shrinking of the relative shell thickness at @xmath33 , as expected from a cooling shock .",
    "the normalization of the calculated curves to the data gives @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is the source distance in kpc .",
    "this result is consistent with hydrodynamic models of supernova remnant ( snr ) evolution with efficient cosmic - ray acceleration @xcite , as well as with snr observations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "we note that a value of @xmath17  g  @xmath8 , as needed if the early radio emission is associated with the blast wave ( see   2 ) , would require a too large x - ray emission volume to reproduce the measured fluxes ( @xmath42 ) .",
    "this gives some support for the assumption that the early radio peak is due to a fast synchrotron jet .",
