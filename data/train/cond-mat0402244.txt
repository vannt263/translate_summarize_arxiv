    "since the discovery of superconductivity in 1911 this amazing macroscopic quantum phenomena has influenced modern solid state physics more then any other fundamental discovery in the 20th century .",
    "the mere fact that five nobel prizes already have been awarded for discoveries directly connected to superconductivity indicates the worldwide recognition of the exceptional role superconductivity plays in physics .    both at the early stages of the field development and later on , research in basic superconductivity brought surprises .",
    "one of the most fundamental discoveries made in superconductivity was the josephson effect @xcite . in 1962",
    "josephson predicted that when two superconductors are put into contact via an insulating layer ( sis junction ) then ( i ) a dc supercurrent @xmath0 ( @xmath1 is the critical current , @xmath2 is the superconducting phase difference ) flows through the junction in equilibrium ( dc josephson effect ) and ( ii ) an alternating current ( @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the bias voltage ) appears when a voltage is applied across the junction ( ac josephson effect ) .",
    "a year latter both the dc and the ac josephson effect were observed in experiments @xcite .",
    "an important contribution to the experimental proof of the josephson effect has been made by yanson , svistunov and dmitrenko @xcite , who were the first to observe rf - radiation from the voltage biased contact and who measured the temperature dependence of the critical josephson current @xmath5 .    as a matter of fact the discovery of the josephson effect gave birth to a new and unexpected direction in superconductivity ,",
    "namely , the superconductivity of weak links ( weak superconductivity , see e.g.ref .",
    "it soon became clear that any normal metal layer between superconductors ( say , an sns junction ) will support a supercurrent as long as the phase coherence in the normal part of the device is preserved .",
    "using the modern physical language one can say that the physics of superconducting weak links turned out to be part of mesoscopic physics .    during the last decade",
    "the field of mesoscopic physics has been the subject of an extraordinary growth and development .",
    "this was mainly caused by the recent advances in fabrication technology and by the discovery of principally new types of mesoscopic systems such as carbon nanotubes ( see e.g.ref .  [ ] ) .    for our purposes metallic single wall carbon nanotubes ( swnt )",
    "are of primary interest since they are strictly one - dimensional conductors .",
    "it was experimentally demonstrated @xcite ( see also ref .  [ ] ) that electron transport along metallic individual swnt at the low bias voltage regime is ballistic . at first glance",
    "this observation looks surprising . for a long time",
    "it was known ( see e.g. ref .  [ ] ) that 1d metals are unstable with respect to the peierls phase transition , which opens up a gap in the electron spectrum at the fermi level . in carbon nanotubes",
    "the electron - phonon coupling for conducting electrons is very weak while the coulomb correlations are strong .",
    "the theory of metallic carbon nanotubes @xcite shows that at temperatures outside the @xmath6 range the individual swnt has to demonstrate the properties of a two channel , spin-1/2 luttinger liquid ( ll ) . this theoretical prediction",
    "was soon confirmed by transport measurements on metal - swnt and swnt - swnt junctions @xcite ( see also ref .  [ ] , where the photoemission measurements on a swnt were interpreted as a direct observation of ll state in carbon nanotubes ) .",
    "both theory and experiments revealed strong electron - electron correlations in swnts .",
    "undoped individual swnt is not intrinsically a superconducting material .",
    "intrinsic superconductivity was observed only in ropes of swnt ( see refs .  [ ] ) . here",
    "we consider the proximity - induced superconductivity in a ll wire coupled to superconductors ( slls ) .",
    "the experimental realization of slls junction could be an individual swnt , which bridges the gap between two bulk superconductors @xcite .",
    "the dc josephson current through a ll junction was evaluated for the first time in ref .",
    "[ ] . in this paper",
    "a tunnel junction was considered in the geometry ( see subsection 2.2 . ) , which is very suitable for theoretical calculations but probably difficult to realize in an experiment .",
    "it was shown that the coulomb correlations in a ll wire strongly suppress the critical josephson current .",
    "the opposite limit - a perfectly transmitting slls junction was studied in ref .",
    "[ ] , where it was demonstrated by a direct calculation of the dc josephson current that the interaction does not renormalize the supercurrent in a fully transparent ( @xmath7 , @xmath8 is the junction transparency ) junction . in subsection 2.2 .",
    "we re - derive and explain these results using the boundary hamiltonian method @xcite .",
    "the physics of quantum wires is not reduced to the investigations of swnts .",
    "quantum wires can be fabricated in a two - dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) by using various experimental methods .",
    "some of them ( e.g. the split - gate technique ) originate from the end of 80 s when the first transport experiments with a quantum point contact ( qpc ) revealed unexpected properties of quantized electron ballistic transport ( see e.g. ref .  [ ] ) . in subsection 2.1 .",
    "we briefly review the results concerning the quantization of the critical supercurrent in a qpc .    in quantum wires formed in a 2deg",
    "the electron - electron interaction is less pronounced @xcite than in swnts ( presumably due to the screening effects of nearby bulk metallic electrodes ) .",
    "the electron transport in these systems can in many cases be successfully described by fermi liquid theory . for noninteracting quasiparticles the supercurrent in a sns ballistic junction",
    "is carried by andreev levels . for a long ( @xmath9 is the junction length ,",
    "@xmath10 is the superconducting energy gap ) perfectly transmitting junction the andreev - kulik spectrum @xcite for quasiparticle energies @xmath11 is a set of equidistant levels . in subsection 2.3 .",
    "we show that this spectrum corresponds to twisted periodic boundary conditions for chiral ( right- and left - moving ) electron fields and calculate the thermodynamic potential of an sns junction using field theoretical methods . in this approach",
    "there is a close connection between the josephson effect and the casimir effect .    in section 3 of our review",
    "we consider the spin effects in ballistic josephson junctions .",
    "as is well - known , the electron spin does not influence the physics of standard sis or sns junctions .",
    "spin effects become significant for sfs junctions ( here  f \" denotes a magnetic material ) or when spin - dependent scattering on magnetic impurities is considered . as a rule ,",
    "magnetic impurities tend to suppress the critical current in josephson junction by inducing spin - flip processes @xcite .",
    "another system where spin effects play an important role is a quantum dot ( qd ) .",
    "intriguing new physics appears in normal and superconducting charge transport through a qd at very low temperatures when the kondo physics starts to play a crucial role in the electron dynamics .",
    "last year a vast literature was devoted to these problems .",
    "here we discuss the spin effects in a ballistic sns junction in the presence of : ( i ) the zeeman splitting due to a local magnetic field acting only on the normal part of the junction , and ( ii ) strong spin - orbit interaction , which is known to exist in quantum heterostructures due to the asymmetry of the electrical confining potential @xcite .",
    "it is shown in subsection 3.1 .",
    "that in magnetically controlled single barrier junction there are conditions when superconductivity in the leads strongly enhances electron transport , so that a giant critical josephson current appears @xmath12 ( @xmath8 is the junction transparency ) .",
    "the effect is due to resonant electron transport through de gennes - saint - james energy levels split by tunneling .",
    "the joint action of zeeman splitting and superconductivity ( see subsection 3.2 . ) results in yet another unexpected effect - a giant magnetic response , @xmath13 , ( @xmath14 is the magnetization , @xmath15 is the number of transverse channels of the wire , @xmath16 is the bohr magneton ) of a multichannel quantum wire coupled to superconductors @xcite .",
    "this effect can be understood in terms of the andreev level structure which gives rise to an additional ( superconductivity - induced ) contribution to the magnetization of the junction .",
    "the magnetization peaks at special values of the superconducting phase difference when the andreev energy levels at @xmath17 , ( @xmath18 is the zeeman energy splitting ) become @xmath19-fold degenerate .    the last two subsections of section 3 deal with the influence of the rashba effect on the transport properties of quasi-1d quantum wires .",
    "strong spin - orbit ( s - o ) interaction experienced by 2d electrons in heterostructures in the presence of additional lateral confinement results in a dispersion asymmetry of the electron spectrum in a quantum wire and in a strong correlation between the direction of electron motion along the wire ( right / left ) and the electron spin projection @xcite .    the chiral properties of electrons in a quantum wire cause nontrivial effects when",
    "the wire is coupled to bulk superconductors . in particular , in subsection 3.4 .",
    "we show that the zeeman splitting in a s / qw / s junction induces an anomalous supercurrent , that is a josephson current that persists even at zero phase difference between the superconducting banks .    in the conclusion",
    "we once more emphasize the new features of the josephson current in ballistic mesoscopic structures and briefly discuss the novel effects , which could appear in an ac josephson current through an ultra - small superconducting quantum dot .",
    "in this chapter we consider the josephson current in a quantum wire coupled to bulk superconductors .",
    "one could expect that the conducting properties of this system strongly depend on the quality of the electrical contacts between the qw and the superconductors .",
    "the normal conductance of a qw coupled to electron reservoirs in fermi liquid theory is determined by the transmission properties of the wire ( see e.g. ref . [ ] ) . for the ballistic case",
    "the transmission coefficient of the system in the general situation of nonresonant electron transport depends only on the transparencies of the potential barriers which characterize the electrical contacts and does not depend on the length @xmath20 of the wire . as already was mentioned in the introduction , the coulomb interaction in a long 1d ( or few transverse channel ) qw",
    "is strong enough to convert the conduction electrons in the wire into a luttinger liquid .",
    "then the barriers at the interfaces between qw and electron reservoirs are strongly renormalized by electron - electron interaction and the conductance of the n / qw",
    "/ n junction at low temperature strongly depends on the wire length @xcite . for a long junction and repulsive electron - electron interaction the current through the system",
    "is strongly suppressed .",
    "the only exception is the case of perfect ( adiabatic ) contacts when the backscattering of electrons at the interfaces is negligibly ( exponentially ) small . in the absence of electron backscattering the conductance @xmath21",
    "is not renormalized by interaction @xcite and coincides with the conductance quantum @xmath22 ( per channel ) . from the theory of luttinger liquis",
    "it is also known @xcite that for a strong repulsive interaction the resonant transition of electrons through a double - barrier structure is absent even for symmetric barriers .",
    "the well - known results for the transport properties of 1d luttinger liquid listed above ( see e.g. review paper @xcite ) allows us to consider two cases when studing ballistic s / qw / s junctions : ( i ) a transparent junction ( @xmath7 , @xmath8 is the junction transparency ) and ( ii ) a tunnel junction ( @xmath23 )",
    ". these two limiting cases are sufficient to describe the most significant physical effects in s / qw / s junctions .",
    "at first we consider a short @xmath24 is the coherence length and @xmath10 is the superconducting gap ) ballistic s / qw / s junction .",
    "one of the realizations of this mesoscopic device is a quantum point contact ( qpc ) in a 2deg ( see fig .",
    "for a qpc the screening of the coulomb interaction is qualitatively the same as in a pure 2d geometry and one can evaluate the josephson current through the constriction in a noninteracting electron model . then due to andreev backscattering of quasiparticles at the sn interfaces , a set of andreev levels",
    "is formed in the normal part of the junction @xcite . in a single mode short junction",
    "the spectrum of bound states takes the form @xcite ( @xmath25 ) @xmath26 where @xmath2 is the superconducting phase difference .",
    "this spectrum does not depend on the fermi velocity and therefore the andreev levels , eq .",
    "( [ 21]),in a junction with @xmath15 transverse channels are @xmath19 degenerate ( the factor @xmath27 is due to spin degeneracy ) .",
    "it is well known ( see e.g. ref .  [ ] ) that the continuum spectrum in the limit @xmath25 does not contribute to the josephson current , @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the thermodynamic potential .",
    "it is evident from eqs .",
    "( [ 21 ] ) and ( [ 22 ] ) that the josephson current through a qpc ( @xmath7 ) is quantized @xcite . at low temperatures ( @xmath30 )",
    "we have @xcite @xmath31 this effect ( still not observed experimentally ) is the analog of the famous conductance quantization in opcs ( see ref .  [ ] ) .",
    "now let us imagine that the geometry of the constriction allows one to treat the qpc as a 1d quantum wire of finite length @xmath20 smoothly connected to bulk superconductors ( fig .",
    "the 1d wire is still much shorter that the coherence length @xmath32 . how does the weakly screened coulomb interaction in a 1d qw influence the josephson current in a fully transmitting ( @xmath7 ) junction ?",
    "notice that the charge is freely transported through the junction since the real electrons are not backscattered by the adiabatic constriction @xcite .",
    "so , it is reasonable to assume that the coulomb interaction in this case does not influence the josephson current at all .",
    "we will prove this assumption for the case of a long junction in the next section .        if the qw is separated from the leads by potential barriers ( quite a natural situation in a real experiment ) the charging effects have to be taken into account .",
    "as a rule the coulomb correlations , which tend to keep the number of electrons in the normal region ( quantum dot in our case ) constant , suppress the critical supercurrent due to the coulomb blockade effect ( see e.g. ref .  [ ] , where a consistent theory of the coulomb blockade of josephson tunneling was developed ) .",
    "they can also change the @xmath2-dependence of the josephson current .",
    "one possible scenario for how charging effects influence the josephson current in a short sns junction is considered in ref .  [ ] .      a consistent theory of electron - electron interactions effects in weak superconductivity has been developed for a long 1d or quasi-1d sns junction , when the normal region can be modelled by a luttinger liquid ( ll ) . the standard approach to this problem ( see e.g. ref .",

    "is described by the famous josephson current - phase relation , however now the effective transparency @xmath283 defined as @xmath284 ( where @xmath285 ) strongly depends on the aspect ratio of the ll wire @xmath286 ( @xmath287 is the width of the nanowire ) , temperature and electron - electron interaction strength .",
    "this result @xcite is a manifestation of the kane - fisher effect @xcite in mesoscopic superconductivity .",
    "it was also interesting for us ( and we hope for the readers as well ) to find a close connection , rooted in the andreev boundary conditions , between the physics of a long sns junction and the casimir effect ( see section 2.3 . ) .",
    "qualitatively new behavior of the proximity induced supercurrent in nanowires is predicted for systems with strong spin - orbit interactions . the rashba effect in nanowires results in the appearance of chiral electrons @xcite for which the direction of particle motion along the wire ( right or left ) is strongly correlated with the electron spin projection .",
    "for chiral electrons the supercurrent can be magnetically induced via zeeman splitting .",
    "the interplay of zeeman , rashba interactions and proximity effects in quantum wires leads to effects that are qualitatively different from those predicted for 2d junctions @xcite .",
    "it is worthwhile to mention here another important trend in mesoscopic superconductivity , namely , the fabrication and investigation of superconductivity - based qubits . among different suggestions and projects in this rapidly developing field , the creation of a so - called single - cooper - box ( scpb ) was a remarkable event @xcite .",
    "the scpb consist of an ultrasmall superconducting dot in tunneling contact with a bulk superconductor .",
    "a gate electrode , by lifting the coulomb blockade of cooper - pair tunneling , allows the delocalization of a single cooper pair between the two superconductors . for a nanoscale grain",
    "the quantum fluctuations of the charge on the island are suppressed due to the strong charging energy associated with a small grain capacitance . by appropriately biasing the gate electrode it is possible to make the two states on the dot , differing by one cooper pair , have the same energy .",
    "this two - fold degeneracy of the ground state brings about the opportunity to create a long - lived coherent mixture of two ground states ( qubit ) .",
    "the superconducting weak link which includes a scpb as a tunnel element could be very sensitive to external ac fields .",
    "this problem was studied in @xcite , where the resonant microwave properties of a voltage biased single - cooper - pair transistor were considered .",
    "it was shown that the quantum dynamics of the system is strongly affected by interference between multiple microwave - induced inter - level transitions . as a result",
    "the magnitude and the direction of the dc josephson current are extremely sensitive to small variations of the bias voltage and to changes in the frequency of the microwave field .",
    "this picture , which differs qualitatively from the famous shapiro effect @xcite , is a direct manifestation of the role the strong coulomb correlations play in the nonequilibrium superconducting dynamics of mesoscopic weak links .",
