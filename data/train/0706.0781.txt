    "in the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) , there are two charginos @xmath4 and @xmath5 , which are the fermion mass eigenstates of the supersymmetric partners of the @xmath6 and the charged higgs bosons @xmath7 . likewise , there are four neutralinos @xmath8 , which are the fermion mass eigenstates of the supersymmetric partners of the photon , the @xmath9-boson , and the neutral higgs bosons @xmath10 .",
    "their mass matrices stem from soft gaugino breaking terms , spontaneous symmetry breaking in the higgs sector and in case of @xmath11 from the super - potential .",
    "the next generation of future high - energy physics experiments at tevatron , lhc and a future @xmath12 linear collider ( ilc ) will hopefully discover these particles if supersymmetry ( susy ) is realized at low energies .",
    "much work has been devoted to the study of the physics interplay of experiments at lhc and ilc @xcite . particularly at a linear collider",
    ", it will be possible to perform measurements with high precision @xcite .",
    "in fact , the accuracies of the masses of the lighter susy fermions are in the permille region which makes the inclusion of higher order corrections indispensible .    in the framework of the real mssm",
    "important results on quark self - energies were obtained in @xcite-@xcite . in @xcite",
    "the gluino pole mass was calculated to two - loop order . moreover ,",
    "the mssm higgs - sector has been studied in detail , even in the full complex model @xcite-@xcite .    in a previous work",
    "@xcite we studied loop corrections to the neutralino pole masses and found that the relation between the @xmath13-input and the physical observables has to be established at least at the two - loop level in order to match experimental precision .",
    "following these lines , we calculate in this paper the two - loop @xmath0 corrections to the charginos within the mssm .",
    "we conclude that these two - loop corrections are in the magnitude of the experimental uncertainty and therefore they are relevant e.g. for global fits of @xmath13-parameters .",
    "a new feature of this work is the inclusion of complex parameters in the mssm .",
    "we therefore not only study the charginos but also re - analyze the neutralino - masses with complex parameters and study in particular the dependence on the phase of the soft trilinear breaking parameter @xmath14 .",
    "generic analytic formulae for susy qcd corrections in @xmath0 to fermion pole masses in the mssm were already derived in @xcite .",
    "our calculation is , however , completely independent .",
    "more precisely , we use semi - automatic mathematica tools @xcite for the diagram generation and analytic simplifications .    in the appendix",
    "we briefly describe our c - program polxino @xcite developed for the calculation of chargino and neutralino masses with complex parameters up to @xmath0 with a convenient slha - interface @xcite for numerical studies .",
    "( 125,50)(0,0 ) ( -19,-8 )    in fig .  [ ch1loopdiags ]",
    "we show all one - loop diagrams .",
    "similar to the neutralino case we checked our analytic one - loop calculation against previous work @xcite in the on - shell scheme and found agreement .",
    "note that in contrast to the neutralino calculation there are now quark isospin - partners denoted by @xmath15 in the loop which give rise to different tensor reduction formulae . in order to get a pure @xmath16 correction from ( fig .",
    "[ ch2lsquark ] ) it is necessary to shorten the 4-squark coupling to its qcd part .",
    "diagrams with one - loop counter - term insertions ( fig .  [ chct ] ) involve @xmath17 mass counter - terms for quarks and squarks as well as coupling constant counter - terms stemming from the yukawa part of the chargino - quark - squark couplings and counter - terms to the squark mixing matrix , see e.g. @xcite .    for the evaluation of the amplitudes we adopt the strategy of @xcite ,",
    "that is , we use semi - automatic tools @xcite in an mathematica environment and therein auto - create fortran code .",
    "the renormalization prescription we adopt is the familiar -scheme which regulates uv - divergencies dimensionally but introduces an unphysical scalar field for any gauge field in the theory in order to restore the counting of degrees of freedom in supersymmetry .",
    "these unphysical mass parameters can be absorbed in the sfermion mass parameters  @xcite ( the resulting scheme is called @xmath18 ) and hence provide a consistency check for the calculation of the diagrams containing gluon lines .    in order to handle infrared divergencies in the individual diagrams we introduce an infrared regulating mass parameter and check that the resulting contributions as well as the unphysical scalar mass due to the gluon field cancel out in the final result . as the main focus of this work is on the numerical analysis",
    "we do not reproduce the resulting lengthy expressions here .",
    "owing to the fact that we split the contributions into self - energy and counter - term diagrams , we can quite easily check some of the generic formulae obtained in @xcite where we find agreement .",
    "the numerical analysis was performed by implementing tsil @xcite in this fortran program . as in the case of neutralinos",
    "we used the usual t hooft feynman @xmath19 gauge for the gluon field , except for the check of gauge independence .",
