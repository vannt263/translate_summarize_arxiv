    "* supersymmetry * is a reasonable extension of the sm , theoretically motivated but without any direct experimental confirmation for its existence as yet .",
    "the recently revived interest in supersymmetric theories derives from the fact that high precision measurements of the sm parameters at lep @xmath8 cern collider shows that su(3),su(2),u(1 ) gauge couplings merge at a single point at energies @xmath9 if supersymmetry is adopted with an effective susy breaking scale @xmath10 @xcite @xmath11 in order to produce susy particles with such large masses at observable rates high energies and luminocities are required and the question is if there are signals for susy below the supersymmetric particle thresholds .",
    "the three gauge boson vertex will be probed in future experiments with high accuracy and it is perhaps a good place to look for supersymmetric signatures.in particular the static quantities of the w - boson are affected by the radiative effects which are due to supersymmetric particles and deviations from the standard model predictions are expected . +",
    "* are these deviations detectable ?",
    "how they depend on the effective susy scale ?",
    "* + to answer this within the context of the @xmath12 requires a systematic analysis in which alllimitations imposed by the rg and the radiative symmetry breaking are duly taken into account .",
    "the mssm is the minimal extension of the sm in that it is based on the gauge group @xmath13 and has the minimal physical content .",
    "it involves two higgs multiplets @xmath14 , and the minimum number of chiral quark and lepton multiplets to accomodate the matter fermions @xmath15 .",
    "its lagrangian is @xmath16 @xmath17 is its supersymmetric part derived from a superpotential @xmath18 bearing the form @xmath19 and @xmath20 is its supersymmetry breaking part given by @xmath21 the sum extends over all scalar fields involved and all family indices have been suppressed @xcite .",
    "all soft scalar masses @xmath22 , gaugino masses @xmath23 , and trilinear scalar couplings @xmath24 are assumed equal at the unification scale , that is we adopt universal boundary conditions as suggested by grand unification and absence of fcnc . @xmath25",
    "this choice parametrizes our ignorance concerning the origin of the supersymmetry breaking terms in the most economical way but it is in no way mandatory .",
    "the sparticle mass spectrum is completely known once all soft susy breaking and mixing parameters at the unification scale @xmath26 are given as well as the top yukawa coupling .",
    "the number of parameters is reduced to five if we make use of the fact that @xmath27 .",
    "a convenient choice is to take as independent parameters : @xmath28 then by running the rges of all couplings and masses involved the full set of parameters down at energies @xmath29 is known and predictions can be made .",
    "there are some subtleties in this approach which are associated with the breaking of the electroweak symmetry , which takes place via radiative corrections , the appearance of particle thresholds etc . which affect the low energy predictions for the sparticle mass spectrum but these in no way affect the static quantities of the w boson at the one loop order .",
    "a typical mass spectrum is shown in table [ tab1 ] where the one loop corrections to the higgs particles , due to the heavy top and stop sector , have been taken into account . as is well known these",
    "yield large radiative corrections especially to the lightest of the neutral higgses involved .",
