    "recent observational data imply -against any previous belief- that the current expansion of the universe is accelerating  @xcite . since this discovery , the so - called dark energy issue has probably become the most ambitious and tantalizing field of research because of its implications in fundamental physics .",
    "there exist several descriptions of the cosmic acceleration . among them ,",
    "the simplest one is the introduction of small positive cosmological constant in the framework of general relativity ( gr ) , the so - called @xmath1cdm model , but it is well accepted the idea according to which this is not the ultimate theory of gravity , but an extremely good approximation valid in the present day range of detection .",
    "a generalization of this simple modification of gr consists in considering modified gravitational theories  @xcite . in the last years",
    "the interest in modified gravity theories like @xmath2 and @xmath3-gravity as alternatives to the @xmath1cdm model grew up .",
    "recently , a new modified gravity theory , namely the @xmath4-theory , has been proposed .",
    "this is a generalized version of the teleparallel gravity originally proposed by einstein  @xcite-@xcite .",
    "it also may describe the current cosmic acceleration without invoking dark energy . unlike the framework of gr , where the levi - civita connection is used , in teleparallel gravity ( tg ) the used connection is the weitzenbckone . in principle , modification of gravity may contain a huge list of invariants and there is not any reason to restrict the gravitational theory to gr , tg , @xmath2 gravity and/or @xmath4 gravity . indeed , several generalizations of these theories have been proposed ( see e.g. the quite recent review @xcite ) . in this paper , we study some other generalizations of @xmath2 and @xmath4 gravity theories . at the beginning , we briefly review the formalism of @xmath2 gravity and @xmath4 gravity in friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) universe . the flat frw space - time is described by the metric @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the scale factor .",
    "the orthonormal tetrad components @xmath7 are related to the metric through @xmath8 where the latin indices @xmath9 , @xmath10 run over 0 ... 3 for the tangent space of the manifold , while the greek letters @xmath11 ,  @xmath12 are the coordinate indices on the manifold , also running over 0 ... 3 .",
    "@xmath2 and @xmath4 modified theories of gravity have been extensively explored and the possibility to construct viable models in their frameworks has been carefully analyzed in several papers ( see @xcite for a recent review ) . for such theories , the physical motivations are principally related to the possibility to reach a more realistic representation of the gravitational fields near curvature singularities and to create some first order approximation for the quantum theory of gravitational fields .",
    "recently , it has been registred a renaissance of @xmath2 and @xmath4 gravity theories in the attempt to explain the late - time accelerated expansion of the universe @xcite . in the modern cosmology , in order to construct ( generalized ) gravity theories , three quantities  the curvature scalar , the gauss bonnet scalar and the torsion scalar  are usually used ( about our notations see below ) : @xmath13 in this paper , our aim is to replace these quantities with the other three variables in the form @xmath14 where @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 are some functions to be defined . as a result",

    "also we note that the behaviour and the results of @xmath21-gravity may be extremely different with respect to the ones of gr , @xmath2 and @xmath4 gravity theories , so that only the observation of our universe may discriminate between the various gravity theories .",

    "<S> since the discovery of cosmic acceleration , modified gravity theories play an important role in the modern cosmology . in particular , the well - known f(r)-theories reached great popularity motivated by the easier formalism and by the prospect to find a final theories of gravity for the dark scenarios . in the present work , </S>",
    "<S> we study some generalizations of f(r ) and f(t ) gravity theories . at the beginning </S>",
    "<S> , we briefly review the formalism of such theories . </S>",
    "<S> then , we will consider one of their generalizations , the so - called f(r , t)-theory . </S>",
    "<S> the point - like lagrangian is explicitly presented . </S>",
    "<S> based on this lagrangian , the field equations of f(r , t)-gravity are found . </S>",
    "<S> for the specific model @xmath0 the corresponding exact solutions are derived . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we will consider the physical quantities associated to such solutions and we will find how for some values of the parameters the expansion of our universe can be accelerated without introducing any dark component . </S>"
