    "the recent experimental data on deuteron structure and heavier nuclei concern the relativistic domain of the nucleon momenta . their successful theoretical description was achieved @xcite in the framework of light - front dynamics ( lfd ) .",
    "this approach deals with the wave function defined on the four - dimensional space - time plane given by equation @xmath0 .",
    "in general , the relativistic state vector is defined on a space - like surface .",
    "the plane @xmath1 , associated with the non - relativistic quantum mechanics , is a particular case of this surface .",
    "the schrdinger equation describes the dynamical time - evolution of the wave function @xmath2 , or , in other words , from one space - like plane @xmath1 to other one .",
    "this dynamics was called by dirac the `` instant form '' @xcite .",
    "light - front dynamics , also called `` front form '' , is associated with the plane @xmath0 .",
    "the latter is considered as a limiting case of a space - like plane . for completeness",
    "we mention the third form proposed by dirac : the `` point form '' , associated with the hyperboloid @xmath3 .",
    "this paper is a brief review of the explicitly covariant version of light - front dynamics .",
    "we explain its relation to the bethe - salpeter approach and illustrate it by few examples .",
    "namely , we give the wave function of two relativistic scalar particles interacting by scalar exchange , discuss the relativistic deuteron wave function and its electromagnetic form factors in comparison to cebaf / tjnaf data and present our new results concerning the system of three relativistic bosons with zero - range interaction .      the theoretically self consistent description of the relativistic composite system",
    "is based on the quantum field theory .",
    "the state vector of a composite system and even of the vacuum has a very complicated structure .",
    "it is usually described as a superposition of bare quanta , corresponding to non - interacting fields . if we `` switch off '' the interaction between fields , the number of particles is conserved .",
    "as soon as we take into account the interaction , the state vector , is in general a superposition of states with different numbers of particles .",
    "when the interaction is weak , like in the case of quantum electrodynamics , it does not change the state vector too much and the `` dressed '' electron differs from the bare one mainly by small admixture of photon .",
    "the situation is drastically different , when the interaction is strong .",
    "for example , the proton is usually treated as being a three quark system , but these quarks are not the same than those appearing in the initial lagrangian of quantum chromodynamics .",
    "they are constituent quarks , which , in their turn , consist of bare quarks and gluons .",
    "the proton state vector is a huge superposition of bare fields and has not yet been calculated from the qcd first principles .",
    "one should emphasize that not only the proton state , but also the state without physical particles  the vacuum state  is a complicated superposition of the bare particles , or , in other words , of vacuum fluctuations .",
    "this description of emptiness in terms of the very complicated conglomerates of particles seems unnatural",
    ". it would be much better to use an approach , in which the vacuum is indeed nothing but emptiness . simplifying the vacuum wave function ,",
    "we simplify the wave function of the dressed states as well , eliminating from them , like in the vacuum wave function , the field fluctuations . after doing that one can study the real , physical structure of particles and nuclei in a more higienic way .",
    "_ in the light - front dynamics the vacuum is nothing but emptiness _ and here is the main advantage of this approach .",
    "qualitatively it can be understood , by noticing that the front form corresponds to the instant form , studied from a reference system moving with velocity close to the speed of light .",
    "indeed , an observer moving with a velocity @xmath4 along @xmath5-axis describes a physical process in his coordinates @xmath6 , which are related to the laboratory ones by the lorentz transformation : @xmath7 the plane @xmath8 in the moving system corresponds to @xmath9 in the laboratory coordinates . in the limiting case , when @xmath10 , we get the light - front plane @xmath11 .",
    "so , the front form corresponds to the normal form @xmath8 , but studied from the system of reference moving with the limiting speed @xmath12 called since weinberg @xcite the `` infinite momentum frame '' .",
    "consider now the fluctuation creating three particles from vacuum ( e.g. , in the @xmath13-theory ) .",
    "the fluctuation with energy @xmath14 may occur during the time @xmath15 ( here @xmath16 ) . in the infinite momentum frame the momenta @xmath17 and energies",
    "@xmath18 of any particle increase and @xmath19 tends to infinity .",
    "therefore , the fluctuation time @xmath20 tends to zero .",
    "the contribution of this fluctuation to the vacuum wave function disappears . due to the time dilation",
    ", all physical processes are delayed , and fluctuations have no time to occur .",
    "this means that in a thought experiment in the infinite momentum frame we study the particles prepared `` far in advance '' , not spoiled by the vacuum fluctuations . from practical point of view",
    ", it is enough to work in a usual reference frame , but with the state vector defined on the light - front plane .",
    "a disadvantage of this approach is the distinguished role of @xmath5-axis relative to the @xmath21-axes . because of that",
    ", the theory is not explicitly covariant . to overcome it , in the paper @xcite ( see for review @xcite ) the explicitly covariant version of light - front dynamics ( clfd ) was proposed , which deals with the state vector defined on the light - front plane @xmath22{$\\cdot$}}x=0 $ ] , where @xmath23 , @xmath24 .",
    "the theory becomes explicitly covariant , whereas the dependence of the wave function on the light - front plane is parametrized by means of the four - vector @xmath25 .",
    "this is very convenient from the point of view of applications .",
    "in particular the standard approach is recovered when @xmath26 .",
    "the wave functions studied in lfd are the fock components of the state vector , that is , the coefficients in an expansion of the state vector @xmath27 with respect to the basis of free fields : @xmath28{$\\cdot$}}p)d\\tau \\frac{d^3k_1}{(2\\pi)^{3/2}\\sqrt{2\\varepsilon_{k_1 } } } \\frac{d^3k_2}{(2\\pi)^{3/2}\\sqrt{2\\varepsilon_{k_2 } } }   + \\cdots\\ .",
    "\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the dots include the higher fock states . for simplicity , we omit the spin indices . by construction ,",
    "all the four - momenta are on the corresponding mass shells : @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 .",
    "we emphasize the presence in ( [ wfp1 ] ) of the delta - function .",
    "it provides the conservation law : @xmath32 where @xmath33 is a scalar variable responsible for the off - energy shell continuation . the four - momentum @xmath34 is associated , for convenience , with a fictive particle called `` spurion '' .",
    "we would like to emphasize at this point that the use of `` spurion '' does not imply the use of any unphysical degres of freedom in the theory but only a confortable way of parametirsing the off - shell effects . as mentioned above",
    ", the standard lfd corresponds to @xmath26 , or , in the light - front coordinates , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 . in this case ,",
    "equation ( [ sc1 ] ) gives the standard conservation laws for the @xmath38-components of the momenta ( which does not include any @xmath33 ) , but does not constrain the minus - components .",
    "their difference @xmath39 determines the value of @xmath33 . because of non - conservation of the minus - components ,",
    "the wave function is `` off - energy shell '' .",
    "the term `` off - energy shell '' is borrowed from the old fashioned perturbation theory , where it means that for an amplitude which is an internal part of a bigger diagram , there is no conservation law for the energies of the incoming and outgoing particles .",
    "note that any bound system is always off - energy shell , since the sum of the constitutent energies @xmath40 ( in the c.m .- frame of two - body system ) is not equal to mass @xmath41 of the bound system but larger : @xmath42 .",
    "we emphasize the difference between the off - energy shell and off - mass shell amplitudes : in the latters the four - momenta squared are not equal to the masses squared , but satisfy the conservation law for all the four components .",
    "an example of off - mass shell amplitude is the bethe - salpeter function ( see below sect .",
    "[ bsf ] ) .    as mentioned , the wave function , defined on the light - front plane , depends on orientation of this plane . from ( [ wfp1 ] )",
    "we see that this dependence is given by the four - vector @xmath25 .",
    "it is an important property of any fock component . at the same time , the observables , like form factors , do nt depend on @xmath25 . in principle",
    ", the form facors , being scalars , could depend on the scalar products @xmath43{$\\cdot$}}p , \\omega{\\makebox[0.08cm]{$\\cdot$}}p')$ ] , where @xmath44 . since @xmath25 determines a direction only , the theory is invariant relative to the replacement @xmath45 , where @xmath46 is a number .",
    "therefore , the extra scalar products should enter in the form of ratio : @xmath22{$\\cdot$}}p/\\omega{\\makebox[0.08cm]{$\\cdot$}}p'$ ] . to factorize the e.m .- amplitude",
    ", one should impose the condition @xmath22{$\\cdot$}}q=0 $ ] ( equivalent to @xmath47 in the standard approach , see @xcite for details ) . with this condition",
    "we get @xmath22{$\\cdot$}}p/\\omega{\\makebox[0.08cm]{$\\cdot$}}p'=1 $ ] , so the form factor does not depend on @xmath25 .    for the states with spins 1/2 and 1 , decomposing the e.m .",
    "vertex in the form factors , one can construct not only scalar products and not only usual spin structures ( two for spin 1/2 and three for spin 1 ) , but also @xmath25-dependent spin structures .",
    "the scalar coefficients at the front of them are extra , non - physical form factors .",
    "one should separate the physical form factors from non - physical ones .",
    "corresponding formulas extracting the physical form factors from full e.m .",
    "vertex were found in @xcite .",
    "parametrized in terms of the relative momentum @xmath48 , the two - body wave function reads : @xmath49 where @xmath50 in the system where @xmath51 and @xmath52 is the direction of @xmath53 in this system .",
    "we see that the relativistic light - front wave function depends not only on the relative momentum @xmath48 but on another variable  the unit vector @xmath52 .",
    "it is also useful to introduce another set of variables",
    "@xmath54{$\\cdot$}}k_1/\\omega{\\makebox[0.08cm]{$\\cdot$}}p\\ , \\quad r = k_1-xp\\ ] ] and represent the spatial part of the four - vector @xmath55 as @xmath56 , where @xmath57 is parallel to @xmath53 and @xmath58 is orthogonal to @xmath53 .",

    "therefore , @xmath62 and @xmath63 can be chosen as two scalar arguments of the wave function : @xmath64 using the definitions of the variables @xmath62 and @xmath63 , we can readily relate them to @xmath65 and @xmath66{$\\cdot$}}\\vec{k}$ ] : @xmath67{$\\cdot$}}\\vec{k})^2,\\quad                            x=\\frac{1}{2}\\left(1-\\frac{\\vec{n}{\\makebox[0.08cm]{$\\cdot$}}\\vec{k}}{\\varepsilon_k}\\right).\\ ] ] the variables introduced above can be easily generalized to the case of different masses and an arbitrary number of particles  @xcite .",
    "the equation for the wave function is shown graphically in fig .",
    "the dashed line corresponds to `` spurion '' . in the case of a scalar particle , in terms of the variables @xmath68 , this equation has the following form : @xmath69    the kernel of eq .",
    "( [ eqwf3 ] ) depends on the vector variable @xmath52 and on the bound state mass @xmath70 .",
    "this dependence is associated with the retardation of the interaction .    in the non - relativistic limit",
    "the light front wave function turns into the ordinary equal - time wave function .",
    "this limit can be formally obtained at @xmath71 .",
    "then the light - front plane @xmath72 turns into the plane @xmath73 .",
    "therefore the equation ( [ eqwf3 ] ) turns into the schrdinger equation in momentum space , the kernel @xmath74 being the fourier - transform of non - relativistic potential and the wave function no longer depends on @xmath52 .",
    "for a given lagrangian , the amplitudes are calculated by rules of special graph technique , developed in @xcite and adjusted to the light - front dynamics in @xcite .",
    "the diagrams correspond to the time - ordered graphs .",
