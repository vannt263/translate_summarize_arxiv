    "while the phase structure of hadronic matter at high temperature both below and above the chiral phase transition temperature @xmath10 is being mapped out by laboratory experiments with invaluable help from lattice qcd , the situation with high density is vastly different .",
    "there is little information about matter above the nuclear matter density @xmath11 @xmath12 from laboratory experiments and there is practically no guidance from qcd proper since lattice ",
    "the only non - perturbative qcd tool available  can not handle high density and the reliable perturbative qcd approach can access density regime only at asymptotic density where such novel phenomena like color - flavor - locked superconductivity can take place . to theorists disappointments , though , this density regime may be totally irrelevant to nature .",
    "we have a complicated landscape of phases theoretically predicted near and above a chiral restoration @xmath4 which is as rich as the phase structure of water but they are all based on models , the reliability of which is uncertain given the paucity of experimental supports and lack of reliable theoretical control . consequently the plethora of different scenarios for dense stellar systems such as neutron stars , black holes etc .",
    "available in the literature offer little guidance for understanding compact star physics .",
    "the aim of this paper is to exploit a systematic effective field theory framework from three different vantage points to describe with some confidence the phase structure of dense matter @xmath13 relevant to the formation of stable compact stars and its implications on the population of neutron stars and light - mass black holes .",
    "these approaches , particularly the second and the third , rely on one common strategy that hadronic systems under extreme conditions can be accessed reliably by hidden local symmetry  @xcite that incorporates the scaling property of chiral symmetry  @xcite . our reasoning will be backed by detailed analysis of astrophysical observations .",
    "this paper consists of two parts , one on an important phase change in hadronic physics and the other on collapse to black holes in astrophysics .",
    "our aim is to bridge these seemingly disparate branches of physical phenomena . in the first part ,",
    "we discuss recent developments on the most likely phase transition in hadronic matter , namely , kaon condensation , as density increases beyond the nuclear matter density to @xmath14 .",
    "we will develop the thesis that this is the first  and perhaps the last  crucial phase change at high density that matters for the fate of compact stars , leaving wide - open the possibility of other forms of higher - density phases involving quark matter etc . in the second part",
    ", we give compelling arguments why astrophysical observations strongly support that neutron stars of mass greater than @xmath15 ( where @xmath16 is the solar mass ) can not be stable , as a consequence of which any compact star more massive than the maximum stable mass must be in the form of a black hole . these two developments will then be joined to arrive at the conclusion that kaon condensation at @xmath17 implies @xmath9 times more low - mass black - hole , neutron - star binaries than double neutron - star binaries .",
    "although qcd can not provide at present useful and quantitative information for hadronic interactions at high density relevant to the physics of compact stars , there are three vantage points at which we have available reliable effective field theory tools to work with .",
    "the first is the matter - free @xmath18 vacuum about which fluctuations can be described by effective chiral field theory . here there is a wealth of experimental data to guide model building and extrapolating beyond the normal matter density .",
    "the second is the other extreme regime of high temperature and/or density at which chiral symmetry is supposed to be restored , namely , the  vector manifestation fixed point \" in hidden local symmetry formulated by harada and yamawaki  @xcite characterized by the gauge coupling going to zero and the interactions between hadrons becoming weak .",
    "the third is in between the two limits , i.e. , in the vicinity of nuclear matter density at which the fermi - liquid fixed point is located . here",
    "both theoretical and experimental information accumulated since many decades in nuclear physics offers both guidance and control near the nuclear matter density and indicates what needs to be taken into account beyond .",
    "the results of these three approaches giving the critical density @xmath19 have been reported before . what is new is the conceptual link between them provided by the recent development of chiral dynamics in hidden local symmetry theory recently supported by a holographic dual approach in string theory that gives an effective field theory of qcd in terms of ( infinite towers of both ) vector mesons and baryons and pions .",
    "we will approach the state of matter believed to be present in the interior of compact stars from these three vantage points and converge to the result that kaons must condense in the vicinity of @xmath20 .",
    "this then leads us to propose that kaon condensation is the most likely phase transition to take place in hadronic matter in the density regime _ that is relevant _ to the fate of compact stars .",
    "any other possible phases such as e.g. , quark matter , color superconductivity etc . that can appear at higher densities",
    "will then be academic issues for stellar objects , although interesting from a purely theoretical point of view . as we shall outline , the metastable behavior of sn1987a which gave off neutrinos for @xmath21 seconds and then disappeared in all respects is symptomatic of a condensate of negative charge kaons . in a number of papers we have outlined how evidence of a condensate which sends neutron stars into low - mass black holes , black holes not much more massive than neutron stars , is already present , and to us quite convincing , in the spectrum of masses in neutron - star binaries .",
    "it seems highly likely that the densities @xmath22 are reached in neutron stars .",
    "it is touch or go whether they were reached in the progenitor of sn1987a .",
    "however , they certainly are reached in the evolution of binary neutron stars in the case where the two progenitor giant masses are more than @xmath23 different from each other in which case the first born neutron star finds itself in the red giant envelope of the companion giant as the latter evolves .",
    "this neutron star accretes matter from the evolving companion giant hypercritically until its mass is increased @xmath24 , reaching densities enough for kaon condensation which sends it into a low - mass black hole .",
    "if , on the other hand , the two progenitor giants are within 4% of each other in mass , they will burn helium at the same time and avoid the red giant stage of the second giant , which will then end up as a neutron star .      as the first estimate of the critical density for kaon condensation , we approach dense hadronic matter from the @xmath18 vacuum .",
    "this can be efficiently done by resorting to weinberg s  folk theorem \" @xcite using effective chiral field theory .",
    "the basic idea is to construct an eft lagrangian that takes into account @xmath25 relevant degrees of freedom at low energy and @xmath25 pertinent symmetry constraints , in particular , chiral symmetry and do a systematic chiral perturbation theory calculation to as high an order as feasible .",
    "this procedure is by now fairly well established for pion - nucleon interactions as well as , to some degree , for finite nuclei and is being currently extended to nuclear matter  @xcite .",
    "the first approach made in this spirit is the work by kaplan and nelson  @xcite . in this subsection",
    ", we describe a toy description that while perhaps oversimplified , nonetheless brings out the essential feature of the physics involved while ignoring what we consider to be inessential complications .",
    "the key idea here is that kaon condensation can be viewed as the @xmath26 by baryon density of chiral symmetry explicitly broken by the strange quark mass .    to formulate this idea in the most economical way",
    ", it was found to be simplest to take the v - spin projection of the goldstone boson sphere onto the v - spin circle , composed of @xmath7 and @xmath27 in the @xmath28 chiral lagrangian  @xcite .",
    "the hamiltonian for explicit @xmath7 chiral symmetry breaking brings in the kaon contribution to the explicit chiral symmetry breaking in the nucleon @xmath29 and in the kaon mass @xmath30 .",
    "the hamiltonian for explicit chiral symmetry breaking  which is of @xmath31 in the chiral power counting  is h_sb & = & _ kn|n n+12 m_k^2 f_^2 ^2 + & & _ kn |n n(1- ) + 12 m_k^2 f_^2 ^ 2 where the last expression is obtained for small fluctuations @xmath32 . here",
    "we have taken mean field in the baryon sector . dropping the term independent of @xmath32 , we find ^2 = m_k^2 ( 1-)^1/2 .",
    "[ eq2 ] the @xmath29 is _ kn = _ n where @xmath33 are the current quark masses and @xmath34 is the pion @xmath27-term .",
    "lattice calculations @xcite give _ kn 389(14 ) .",
    "we can go one order higher in the  effective mass \" of the kaon ( [ eq2 ] ) by incorporating what is called  range term \" which turns out be important quantitatively  @xcite .",
    "it amounts to changing @xmath29 to _ kn^eff = ( 1 - 0.37 ) _ kn where @xmath35 is the ( anti)kaon energy _ k^- = v_tw^k^- + .",
    "in addition to the scalar attraction ( which can be thought of as giving the kaon an effective mass ) , there is the vector attraction given by the tomozawa - weinberg term @xcite  which is the leading term , i.e. , @xmath36 , in the chiral counting v^k^-_tw",
    "= - n -60 [ eq5]where @xmath1 is nuclear matter density and we have taken the empirical value for the pion decay constant f_93 . [ eq6 ]    in a neutron star the electron chemical potential @xmath37 , which in the progenitor of sn1987a was @xmath38 mev @xcite is the driving force towards kaon condensation  @xcite . once the _ in - medium _ kaon mass @xmath39 is less than @xmath40 then the degenerate electrons in the electron cloud in the neutron star can lower the energy by changing into a kaon condensate .",
    "the kaons are bosons , so they will immediately go into an s - state condensate , which lowers the pressure substantially from that of the degenerate electrons in the cloud in the neutron star . after this drop in pressure , the neutron star will go into a black hole in a light - crossing time .",
    "the above captures the calculation of kaon condensation as it stood for many years that indicated that kaons could condense at @xmath41 .",
    "the principal lesson we learn here is that baryon density plays a prominent role , namely , that the underlying mechanism for condensation is the restoration of the explicitly broken chiral symmetry by baryon density . as noted in @xcite , kaons condense because the s quark mass is neither too light nor too heavy .",
    "the most complete calculation of possible kaon condensation along the general line described above was carried out by thorsson et al .",
    "@xcite with three different @xmath29 , expressed in other terms in their chiral perturbation theory .",
    "this calculation contained the medium dependence of the kaon mass through @xmath29 ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq2 ] ) ) but did not contain the medium dependence of @xmath42 , the in - medium pion decay constant as required by hls theory which we believe is indispensable as we will see below",
    ".     one may raise objections to the above simple treatment on the ground that several mechanisms that could be important are left out in the treatment .",
    "most obvious are the roles of the @xmath43 and hyperons , much discussed in the literature , which when one does fluctuations from the matter - free vacuum , can not be ignored .",
    "when looked at in terms of an rg flow , these degrees of freedom give ",
    "irrelevant \" terms for the location of the critical density , that is , insignificant for the precise value but they play a determinant role in @xmath44 phase transitions .    since the role of the @xmath43 in nuclei and dense matter has been greatly disputed in the past , we clarify what it as well as other related degrees of freedom  such as p - wave hyperon interactions  that we will refer to as  dangerously irrelevant operators \" following condensed matter terminology , do in the condensation phenomenon .",
    "the point we will drive at is that while they may play a crucial role in @xmath45 the system toward instability , once the direction in which the system moves is determined , the location of the critical density is highly insensitive to the strength of such interaction terms involved .",
    "we focus on the contribution of @xmath43 to kaon - nuclear interactions .",
    "the @xmath43-nucleon interactions can be written as four - fermi interactions which have canonical dimension 6 .",
    "as such , it is  irrelevant \" from the usual dimensional counting . to show what such a term does in meson condensation",
    ", we follow the argument given in @xcite for generic meson condensation in strong interaction physics .",
    "it is a toy - model argument but it is applicable to the present case .",
    "the technique used is the one developed by shankar  @xcite for landau fermi liquid theory .",
    "there is a distinct difference , however , between boson condensation and fermi liquid in that while a ",
    "mass \" term is @xmath46 in the renormalization group sense , so figures importantly in the condensation process , the effective mass in the fermi liquid is a fixed - point quantity , so it does not flow .",
    "this is because the fermi surface in the latter is fixed by fiat .",
    "let the meson field be denoted generically as @xmath47 .",
    "we will focus on two terms , one  mass \" term and the other interaction term , with the action written schematically ( apart from the kinetic energy term ) s = s_m + s_i where s_m & = & dd^3q ^ * , + s_i & = & ( dd^3q)^2 ( dd^3k)^2 h ^*^^4 ( , , q , k ) where @xmath48 is the baryon field containing nucleons , hyperons and @xmath43 etc . of course both @xmath49   and @xmath50 subsume many terms with varying powers in the suitable expansion ( e.g. , the chiral expansion in chiral perturbation theory ) .",
    "will contain , aside from the kaon mass , leading @xmath51 term of @xmath52 , the next - to - leading order @xmath53 terms , @xmath54 etc . ] for our discussion we need not specify them here .",
    "the scaling law for the fields involved under scaling transformation determined from the kinetic term ( which is required to be invariant under the scaling ) shows that the  mass \" term is @xmath46 but the interaction ( @xmath50 ) term is @xmath55 .",
    "now the rges are found  la shankar  @xcite by making the scale change @xmath56 with @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the cut - off scale  @xcite , & = & -dh , + & = & -h/2 where @xmath59 and @xmath60 with @xmath61 is a constant depending on @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the fermi momentum of the baryonic system . the solutions to the rges are ( t)&= & ( _ 0 -23dh_0)e^t + 23 dh_0 e^-t/2 , + h(t ) & = & h_0 e^-t/2 . as one decimates down with @xmath64 ( @xmath65 ) integrating out higher lying modes , the boson - fermion interaction gets exponentially suppressed .",
    "we see that if @xmath66 , then the @xmath49 flows toward @xmath67 . on the other hand , for d",
    "> 32 [ cdensity ] the @xmath49 is bound to turn negative , signalling instability against condensation .",
    "this can be seen in figure [ rg - lrs ] .",
    "now @xmath60 and @xmath61 , so that means that ( [ cdensity ] ) can be satisfied by dialling the density .",
    "what matters is the  least irrelevant term \" figuring in @xmath68 that drives flow toward condensation while more irrelevant terms  unless of course numerically enhanced  get suppressed .    once the system , flowing toward instability , reaches the critical point , then what matters will be the least ",
    "irrelevant \" term that  eats up \" the mass , with other irrelevant terms being suppressed .",
    "in fact a detailed analysis shows that the @xmath43 that brings the initial attraction to direct the rg flow figures negligibly in determining the location of the critical point  @xcite : it is found that change of the @xmath43-nucleon interaction strength by orders of magnitude affects the critical density by only a few % .",
    "another objection that could be raised is that no account is made of the strong repulsion that can be generated in nuclear interactions in dense medium that would prevent kaon condensation at such a low density . in  @xcite ,",
    "carlson et al . argue that due account of short - range nuclear correlations could push the critical density above @xmath69 .",
    "this objection will be answered in what follows in terms of  hadronic freedom \" in the vicinity of the critical density which prevents the repulsion from growing at high density .      as the second estimation of the critical density which we favor over the others , we calculate kaon condensation going top - down from the chiral restoration point . for this we adopt the hidden local symmetry approach to chiral dynamics developed by harada and yamawaki ( hy )  @xcite .",
    "it is appealing to think of this theory as a truncated infinite - tower description of holographic dual qcd that arises from string theory ( explained below ) in which all vector mesons lying above the lowest ones , @xmath70 , @xmath71 and @xmath72 , are integrated out .",
    "this theory is characterized by that it has local gauge invariance , which allows a systematic chiral perturbation expansion with the vector mesons included and that the effective theory is matched to qcd  la wilsonian rge and hence  knows \" about qcd .",
    "the crucial outcome of the hy s analysis is that the theory has what is called  vector manifestation ( vm ) \" fixed point to which the theory flows subject to constraints imposed by qcd when the system is driven by either temperature  @xcite , density  @xcite or the number of flavors  @xcite to the critical point at which chiral symmetry is restored .",
    "the fixed point is given by p^*:=(g^ * , a^ * , f_^*)= ( 0 , 1 , 0)[vmfixedpoint ] where @xmath73 is the hidden gauge coupling constant , @xmath74 is the ratio of  parametric decay constants \" of the pion @xmath75 and the longitudinal component of the @xmath70 meson @xmath76 and @xmath42 is the physical pion decay constant .",
    "what is highly pertinent to us is that near the vm fixed point , fluctuations of the hadrons figuring in the theory become well - defined , making processes taking place near the vm fixed point amenable to a simple calculation .",
    "it has been observed that even if a given process takes place away from the vm fixed point , so @xmath77 and @xmath78 , taking @xmath79 can be a good starting point for describing fluctuations in certain processes .",
    "for example , @xmath80 is an accurate approximation for describing the chiral doublers in heavy - light mesons such as @xmath81 and @xmath82  @xcite , the @xmath83-@xmath84 mass difference  @xcite , the nucleon em form factors  @xcite etc .    assuming that kaons condense near , but below , the critical density for chiral restoration @xmath4 , we start from the vm fixed point ( [ vmfixedpoint ] ) and make a renormalization - group flow analysis as density decreases from the vm fixed point as was done in @xcite . in performing this calculation , we exploit two observations on : ( 1 ) the relevant degrees of freedom near the vm fixed point and ( 2 ) the weakness of interaction strength in what is referred to as  hadronic freedom \" zone .",
    "we discuss these observations .",
    "the first and most important observation is that the relevant degrees of freedom for kaon condensation are not those manifest in free space where the elementary kaon - nucleon interaction takes place , but more relevant are the degrees of freedom in the vicinity of the fixed point , since the condensation is in the neighborhood of this point @xmath85 at which chiral restoration takes place .",
    "thus , for example , since @xmath86 is near zero , the hls gauge coupling constant @xmath73 is near zero , making the vector mesons nearly massless as pions are .",
    "this makes chiral perturbation calculation feasible and reliable with the vector mesons and pions treated on the same footing with their masses appearing as small parameters of @xmath31 .",
    "furthermore , the @xmath43 and other excitations which are important near the matter - free vacuum , become irrelevant in the sense defined above , so do not figure in the calculation of the critical density .",
    "we thus have vector mesons and pions as the explicit degrees of freedom .",
    "but then what about baryons",
    "?    in holographic qcd which generalizes harada - yamawaki s hls theory , there are no fermion degrees of freedom .",
    "baryons therefore must arise as solitons . indeed in the holographic dual qcd model of sakai and sugimoto",
    "@xcite which has correct features of chiral symmetry properties of qcd proper , baryons do arise naturally as instantons in five dimensions in which low - energy qcd is dualized or alternatively as skyrmions in four dimensions embedded in an infinite tower of vector mesons .",
    "the chiral properties of the resulting baryons , in particular , nucleons , are very well described in the approximations adopted by the model  @xcite . in order to exploit the vm fixed point",
    ", we need to integrate out all except the lowest members of the tower and treat hadonic matter in terms of skyrmions emerging from hy s hls theory .",
    "indeed hadronic matter at high density has been described in terms of skyrmion matter with an infinite winding number  @xcite .",
    "however there is an indication that skyrmions are not stable at some density @xmath87 above @xmath1  @xcite .",
    "we will argue that this implies that the nucleon goes over to constituent ( or quasi ) quarks at @xmath88 .",
    "we will first develop the argument in temperature and then apply it to the density case .",
    "what happens when hadronic system is heated to near the critical temperature @xmath10 , i.e. , from 120 to 175 mev , was studied by brown et al @xcite using the star peripheral data @xcite . for the peripheral experiments 120 mev was the freezeout temperature ;",
    "i.e. , the hadrons leaving the system at that temperature did not interact further .",
    "the upper temperature @xmath89 mev was taken to be the phase transition temperature @xmath10 at which the vm dictates that the hls coupling @xmath73 go to zero and the parameter @xmath90 go to 1 .",
    "brown et al .",
    "@xcite showed that the widths @xmath91 for @xmath70 decay into two pions were zero at @xmath92 and remained small until just before freezeout at @xmath93 mev .",
    "this was because the @xmath94 s went as @xmath95 and the mass of the @xmath70 was taken to increase from zero at @xmath10 to 90% of the on - shell @xmath94 at 120 mev .",
    "the latter value was called the  flash point \" because the interactions of the @xmath70 s at that temperature was that of ( nearly ) on - shell hadrons .",
    "the @xmath70-mesons in the experiment were recreated by following the pion tracks in the time projection chamber back to the vertex , identified as the @xmath70 , for those which were emitted in @xmath70-decay .",
    "the 120 mev was thus not only the freezeout temperature , but also the temperature at which the hadrons turned into constituent quarks .",
    "we learn from the above observation that the region of temperature from @xmath96 to @xmath97 thus delineates a region in which interactions are negligible , a region governed by the vanishing coupling constant @xmath98 .",
    "we can also deduce what happens to the @xmath90 parameter which is defined by m_^2=a f_^2 g^2 .",
    "as is known by the ksrf relation , @xmath99 , and also from the vector dominance of the pion em form factor , @xmath100 in matter - free space . in the large @xmath101 limit in which the bare hls lagrangian is defined by wilsonian matching , one finds @xmath102 with the @xmath80 point lying on the rg trajectory matched to qcd .",
    "the @xmath100 point is not on that trajectory , implying that in hls theory , @xmath100 can only be an accident .",
    "indeed as mentioned above , nature prefers @xmath79 at least in the leading order of chiral perturbation theory .",
    "it has been shown by harada and sasaki  @xcite that in heat bath , the vector dominance given by @xmath100 is strongly violated as @xmath90 goes to 1 when temperature goes toward @xmath10 .",
    "this suggests that we associate @xmath103 as the flash point at which @xmath104 mev .",
    "we interpret the region between @xmath105 at 120 mev and @xmath80 at @xmath97 to be a region in which the relevant fermionic degrees of freedom are constituent quarks , with the off - shell quarks flowing freely from higher to lower temperature .",
    "nothing detectable goes on here in this region ",
    "it is just a region of space - time without anything except off - shell particles within it , hence called  hadronic freedom \" region .    in dense matter ,",
    "the situation is much less clear , so we are going to make a certain number of guesses and develop a scenario that parallels the temperature scenario .   at the  pseudo - gap density \" which is identified as the flash density  @xcite",
    "this may be a better approximation than @xmath102 adopted below . ]",
    "as mentioned , it is established that the vector manifestation fixed point ( [ vmfixedpoint ] ) is reached when density is at the critical density @xmath4 at which @xmath106  @xcite .",
    "it has also been verified that @xmath107 in the vicinity of the critical density and @xmath108 .",
    "however the question is : where is the density flash point above which the system goes into the hadronic freedom region ? in order to answer this question within the framework of hls theory , we need the baryon degrees of freedom and at present , there is no systematic calculation in hls theory that includes baryons .",
    "what we know now is described in @xcite : up to the nuclear matter density @xmath1 , the available phenomenology in nuclear processes indicates that the hls coupling @xmath73 stays more or less unchanged . beyond @xmath1",
    ", we have no information from data but our basic assumption is that the flash point @xmath87 lies at the point from which @xmath73 drops rapidly arriving at @xmath109 at @xmath110 . from what we discussed above ,",
    "we deduce that it is at @xmath87 that going top - down , the constituent quarks go on - shell forming baryons as the coupling constant becomes strong leaving the hadronic freedom region .",
    "now if one extrapolates linearly from @xmath80 at @xmath4 to @xmath100 at @xmath2 , we arrive at @xmath102 when the density reaches the density n_flash3 n_0.[nflash ] this is the density counterpart of @xmath111 mev .",
    "the hadronic freedom region is identified as the interval @xmath112 .",
    "the putative repulsion one expects naively from the vantage point of the matter - free vacuum can not survive within this region and would not provide the mechanism often invoked for stabilizing a neutron star at as large as @xmath113  @xcite.[multiblock footnote omitted ]      we now have all the pertinent degrees of freedom in the vicinity of @xmath4 .",
    "they are the constituent ( or quasi ) quarks , the ( pseudo)goldstone bosons @xmath115 and @xmath116 and the vector mesons @xmath70 and @xmath71 with their masses comparable to the pion mass .",
    "to describe kaon condensation , we need to take into consideration interactions between the kaon and the quasiquarks .",
    "the lagrangian we have is hls lagrangian that is matched to qcd at a density @xmath117 at a matching scale @xmath118 .",
    "now we need to calculate rge flow in theory with the gauge coupling @xmath73 and the parameter @xmath90 as described above in the density region @xmath119 .",

    "we observe that @xmath120 does not scale appreciably in the matter - free space as found by harada and yamawaki  @xcite .",
    "we shall give an argument why we expect this to be similar in medium .",
    "for this , it will suffice to to know what it is near the nuclear matter density .",

    "] from which we learned that the in medium parametric @xmath75 must be decreased f_f_^ * ( n_0)f_^(n_0)0.8 f_[fpi - ratio ] @xmath122 at @xmath123 .",
    "we have no systematic calculation of @xmath120 beyond the nuclear matter density .",
    "this is because @xmath120 runs with the _ intrinsic density dependence _ dictated by the wilsonian matching of the hls correlators to those of qcd , which is unknown since lattice techniques can not handle density effects .",
    "however one can argue that it will stay more or less unchanged up to the critical density .",
    "in both temperature and density , when one goes beyond the flash point , the vector meson mass @xmath124 and the gauge coupling constant @xmath125 scale in the same way , i.e. proportionally to @xmath126 . hence the ratio @xmath127  with @xmath128  will stay more or less unchanged .",
    "this feature was exploited in the high - temperature case in @xcite . as for the density relevant to kaon condensation , we need not go all the way to the chiral restoration point but one can make a rough estimate of the ratio @xmath129 in a hls model with quasiquarks  @xcite , f_^ * ( n_)/f_~0.77 .",
    "it thus seems justified to take the scaling ( [ fpi - ratio ] ) operative from the flash point to the kaon condensation point .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that the walecka vector mean field used so much in nuclear physics already had this increase in it , so that it is part of the usual phenomenology of nuclear physics .    since the gauge coupling constant",
    "@xmath73 is near zero in the hadronic freedom region , quantum loop corrections can be ignored .",
    "it suffices therefore to do the mean field calculation ( i.e. , tree contributions ) . for the neutron fraction @xmath130 and proton fraction @xmath131 in a compact star ,",

    "this is somewhat smaller but not too far from the electron chemical potential expected at that density , @xmath38 mev  @xcite .",
    "considering the roughness of the estimate , it seems reasonable to identify the flash point as the kaon condensation critical density @xmath114 .",
    "we note that were it not for the presence of the electron fermi sea , the flow of the star matter would end up at the vm fixed point at @xmath85",
    ". however , the decay of electrons into kaons stops the hidden local symmetry ( hls ) flow .",
    "the third way to arrive at the kaon condensation critical density @xmath137 is to fluctuate from the density at which nuclear matter is saturated , namely , @xmath11 @xmath12 .",
    "the basic idea has been presented in previous review articles by the authors , the most recent of which is given in @xcite .",
    "as discussed there , going above the nuclear matter density consists of first writing an effective lagrangian that describes nuclear matter as the fermi - liquid fixed point  la shankar when the mean field approximation is taken .",
    "given such a lagrangian with the parameters determined with the  intrinsic density dependence \" as dictated by the wilsonian matching to qcd prescribed in hls theory , one can make a fluctuation around the fermi liquid fixed point to go to higher density .",
    "the effective lagrangian which is anchored on chiral symmetry is equivalent to walecka s linear mean field lagrangian with the intrinsic density dependence ( i.e. brown - rho scaling ) suitably taken into account .    to proceed to kaon condensation",
    ", we assume as above that the relevant fermionic degrees of freedom are the constituent quarks .",
    "we consider the constituent quark picture applicable at nuclear matter density and above and that the nucleon is made of loosely bound three quasiquarks and the kaon of loosely bound strange quark and chiral anti - quasiquark . now",
    "the mean field nuclear potential has two parts , the vector potential @xmath138 and the scalar potential @xmath139 , which can be viewed as due to exchange of an @xmath71 meson and a scalar meson ( denoted here @xmath140 ) , v_n & = & n , + s_n & = & - n. here we are introducing a fictitious scalar in the line of walecka model with scaling mass and coupling constant but one can actually avoid the scalar degree of freedom by writing the effective lagrangian in terms of a four - fermi interaction ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "now from the phenomenology of walecka model , we know that s_n ( n_0)- v_n ( n_0)-600  mev . taking into account of the fact that the kaon contains only one non - strange quark compared with three in the nucleon , we expect the kaon to feel the attractive potential s_k^- + v_k^- -200  mev . now applying the same reasoning to the compact star matter with a 90% neutron fraction , we find at @xmath141 that _ k^- ( 2n_0 ) ~160  mev .",
    "since the electron chemical potential expected at this density is 173 mev  @xcite , we see that kaon condensation is expected to take place already at @xmath142 in this scenario . thus this picture predicts @xmath143 consistent with the two other estimates .",
    "it is not generally realized that the metastability of sn1987a , _ i.e. _ the fact that it emitted neutrinos for about 12 seconds before disappearing ( and was  never heard from again \" ) , was probably aided substantially by the presence of strange particles in the core @xcite . for this , the fact that the particles were strange was not the important point ; the strange particles with strange quarks , be they the @xmath7 or the hyperon @xmath144 , have negative charges and additional protons would be needed to neutralize their charge .",
    "the additional protons would interact strongly attractively with the neutron main component in the neutron star and increase the binding energy of the star . as the star collapses to a neutron star , once the densities are @xmath145 g @xmath146 the neutrinos",
    "are trapped .",
    "that is , they may try to random walk their way out , in the frame of the infalling matter , but once the density is @xmath145 g @xmath146 the mean free path for neutrino scattering off the nucleons is only a few centimeters , so the neutrino drift ( random walk ) velocity outwards becomes smaller than the velocity of infalling matter .",
    "the neutrinos , above the trapping density , equilibrate with the neutrons and protons so that _ n= _ p + _ e - _ , and the neutrinos fill a fermi sea of fermi energy @xmath147 mev .",
    "thus , the neutrinos contribute to the pressure .",
    "it has been considered likely that the neutron star has @xmath144 hyperons in it .",
    "although the mass of the @xmath144 hyperon is 1197 mev , much heavier than the neutron 940 mev , the neutrons will be degenerate . since the admixture of @xmath144 will have large negative charge",
    ", its presence would bring down the electron chemical potential @xmath40 considerably @xcite .",
    "the @xmath144 at rest can replace both an electron and a neutron .",
    "it begins to come in at a density such that _",
    "^-=_n + _ e. this is generally satisfied at a density @xmath148 ; i.e. , at about twice nuclear matter density @xcite . ( the @xmath58 s come in earlier , at a lower density , but the @xmath58 is charge neutral and does not have the interesting effects that the @xmath144 has . ) as the neutrinos leave , the electrons recombine with the protons to make neutrons and @xmath144 s , and the eos stiffens as the number of protons decreases .",
    "thus , the star will not collapse immediately into a black hole .",
    "kaon condensation will set in later as the star cools down further .    as has been discussed extensively in the literature , the appearance of hyperons in dense matter has been invoked to argue against kaon condensation setting in at a density @xmath149 because the driving force , _",
    "i.e. _ , the electron chemical potential , would get weakened  @xcite .",
    "we believe this argument is not valid .",
    "we have made clear that nucleons and hyperons are no longer the relevant degrees of freedom when the flash point , which we estimate to be at @xmath150 is reached .",
    "the rg flow is run completely by the weinberg - tomozawa vector interaction here , the hyperons having been integrated out , as irrelevant .",
    "our fluctuation about the fixed point rather than about the perturbative vacuum has given a scaling which increases the vector interaction by @xmath151 , increasing from 0.5 in free space to 1 at the fixed point .",
    "this explains much of the increased attraction and , therefore , softening of the eos in our nonperturbative calculation .",

    "brown and h.a .",
    "bethe in w.k .",
    "kellogg radiation laboratory @xcite .",
    "since that time , much improvements on the calculations have been made , the most important one of which being the expanding about the vm fixed point of hidden local symmetry . and furthermore more observational data have been accumulated .    in this second half of the paper , we would like to present a chain of astrophysical observations to link the kaon condensation in hadronic matter developed in the first half to the population of neutron stars and black holes .",
    "the most pertinent and daring prediction on this issue had been made by brown @xcite , who had found the accepted scenario for binary neutron star evolution to be completely wrong .",
    "as we shall outline , the standard scenario accepted up to then assumed that the accretion onto the first - born neutron star , while the companion giant evolved and the neutron star and giant went into common envelope , was limited by the eddington rate and , therefore , negligible .",
    "it was noted in @xcite , after the suggestion by chevalier @xcite , that the rate of accretion necessitated going over to hypercritical accretion and that that was sufficient to send the first - born neutron star into a ( low - mass ) black hole .",
    "it was then suggested that the only way to avoid this was for the two progenitor giants to burn helium at the same time , which allowed the neutron star to avoid the red giant stage of the companion giant .",
    "this point is further developed below .",
    "the brown scenario had the prediction that the two neutron stars in a binary , which must have burned helium at the same time , should be within 4% of each other in mass in order to do this .",
    "as we shall see , this prediction is fulfilled by the most massive neutron star binaries .    in the case of the less massive double neutron stars , _ i.e.",
    "_ , j0737 - 3039 and j1756@xmath1522251 , the pulsars acquire an additional @xmath153 during the helium red giant stage of the companion , which does not take place in the more massive binaries , but aside from this , the pulsar and companion must be within 4% of each other in mass .",
    "the companion in the less massive double neutron stars , i.e. , j0737 - 3039 and j1756 - 2251 have to burn hotter than those in the more massive ones during the helium burning in order to reach the same central temperature of the more massive ones because the surface to volume ratio is larger in the less massive stars .",
    "this means that more energy is lost from the surface .",
    "the result of this is that the progenitors of these two less massive stars go through a helium red giant stage as well as ( earlier ) a hydrogen red giant stage . during the he red giant stage the pulsar accretes @xmath153 of helium .",
    "therefore , the necessary limit of at most 4% difference between progenitor masses of the pulsar and companion can be somewhat larger if the companion of the pulsar gives an additional 0.1 to @xmath154 of helium during the helium shell burning .",
    "note that the helium burning of pulsar and companion progenitors must overlap in time .",
    "the helium red giant stage is put into the evolution of j0737 - 3039 by willems and kalogera @xcite .",
    "we will try to make our arguments for the general physics community .",
    "the general reader would benefit from references to a few review papers , where neutron star structure @xcite , supernova explosions @xcite and binary evolution @xcite are discussed .      in the study of neutron stars , a key tool used in astrophysics",
    "is the acceptance of eddington accretion as the maximum possible rate .",
    "matter falling on a neutron star is bound to the neutron star gravitationally by @xmath122 of its rest mass because of the great mass of the neutron star .",
    "this binding energy is used to produce radiation , say in the form of photons , which are emitted from the surface of the neutron star .",

    "ultimately the density of matter falling onto the neutron star must be sufficiently high that the photons originating from the neutron star by random walk in the framework of the infalling matter actually move out at a lower velocity than the infalling matter has in falling onto the neutron star , so that the photons are swept back onto the neutron star by the adiabatic inflow .",
    "good discussions of this are given by @xcite .",

    "neutrinos were trapped in the collapse of large stars , so the trapping of photons in order to give hypercritical accretion seemed self - evident .",

    "no sign of any other amount of hypercritical accretion , which could simply add to the mass of the neutron star is seen .",

    "the neutron star is already present when the main sequence progenitor of the white dwarf begins to evolve .",
    "the neutron star accretes matter ( and is spun up ) by accretion from the companion red giant in stable mass transfer . the rate of mass transfer is @xmath209 , so it is @xmath188 times slower than in the first case .",

    "we would nonetheless suggest that the reasoning for the two tracks of haensel et al is not valid for the case at hand .",
    "of the two possible phases , quark matter and kaon condensation , the former phase would be favored at high temperature , as is found in collapses like 1987a , and the latter in a cool scenario like the @xmath211 yr accretion from an evolving main sequence star onto the neutron star to make a neutron - star , white - dwarf binary . in 1987a",

    "although the star in the center of sn1987a disappeared , we do know that the original star sanduleak-69@xmath217202 was in star catalogs and did have a mass of @xmath218 .",
    "for many years there was substantial uncertainty in the evolution of giants in the region of masses in which they would begin , with increasing zams mass , to go into black holes .",
    "the most important nuclear process in this evolution was the ^12c ( , ) ^16o reaction .",
    "this reaction determines where the convective burning of carbon stops . in many years of work ,",
    "the stuttgart group @xcite and more recently buchmann and barnes @xcite determined this to be s_tot^300 & = & \\ {    ll 16239  kev  barns & ( stuttgart ) + 80^+20_-20 + 53^+13_-18  kev  barns & ( buchmann  &  barnes )    . .",

    "point out that the fe core mass should be a good indicator of the compact object mass because the decrease in mass from the general relativistic effect is compensated for by fallback in formation of the compact object . ) thus , with the best available nuclear physics to date , the supernova progenitor of sn1987a collapsed into a compact object of @xmath223 , not far from the mass constructed by bethe and brown from the @xmath224 of ni formed in the explosion of @xmath201 .",
    "note that the low - mass black holes will only be formed from zams @xmath225 stars ; i.e. , black holes of @xmath226 .",

    "the deceleration takes place because the product @xmath234 increases going out .",

    ", a shock wave continues at constant speed if @xmath238const because its velocity is u~(p/)^1/2 and @xmath239 is inversely proportional to the enclosed volume .",
    "but if @xmath234 increases , the shock has to slow down , and the material behind it likewise .",
    "this deceleration gradually sharpens into an ingoing shock .",
    "woosley s calculation @xcite shows that when the outgoing shock enters the hydrogen envelope , the deceleration of the shock sharpens into a reverse shock and this shock has been used to deposit @xmath240 back on the compact object @xcite .",

    "@xcite shows the matter being deposited back on the neutron star .",
    "when material sent radially inward by the reverse shock reaches the supernova center , the compact object is no longer there in case the neutron star receives a kick velocity . the material proceeds to move outwards from the original center .",
    "eventually all of the matter will be moving radially outward , through with different speeds depending on the distance from the center .",
    "thus chevalier @xcite suggests that the compact object will end up traveling at the same speed as its kick velocity .",
    "therefore , we may , to a good approximation , consider the compact object to be at rest with respect to its ambient matter and use the bondi @xcite spherical accretion theory to determine @xmath181 , the rate of mass accretion onto the compact object .",
    "brown and weingartner @xcite find that the photons from the initial accretion are trapped by the high density infalling matter , but that in @xmath241 yr one would have accretion at basically the eddington limit .",
    "our prediction on the implication of kaon condensation on neutron stars in a binary has important ramifications on the number of light - mass black holes .",
    "we claim that there should be @xmath242 times more low - mass black - hole , neutron - star binaries than double neutron - star binaries .",
    "now what is the status of the observation ?    the observed pulsars have all been  recycled \" .",
    "that is , they have accreted mass from their companion .",
    "empirically , this accretion of mass @xcite brings down the magnetic field of the pulsar .",
    "the time that a pulsar can be seen is inversely proportional to its magnetic field .",
    "if the magnetic field is brought down a factor of @xmath147 from the recycling , the pulsar will be observable for 100 times longer .",
    "it is convenient to introduce the idea of  observability premium\"@xcite = where @xmath243 is the magnetic field of the pulsar . @xmath244 for fresh , unrecycled pulsars , which would appear in neutron star , black hole binaries , because the black hole can not transfer mass (  recycle \" ) the neutron star . for psr  1913@xmath19516 ,",
    "the hulse - taylor binary , @xmath245 g for the pulsar , so it will be observable for @xmath147 times longer than the black hole , neutron star binary . in table",
    "[ tabdns ] we have 6 double neutron star binaries .",
    "taking 100 to be a typical difference between the observable times for recycled and unrecycled pulsars , we see that we should see @xmath241 neutron - star , black - hole binaries .",
    "in fact , the factor is probably somewhat less than this because the observer would be somewhat biased against claiming something that can not be directly seen , but identifiable only by its effects , such as a black hole in a binary .",
    "an interesting recent development is the discovery of",
    " twins \" @xcite .",
    "these authors show that  binaries like to be twins \" ; i.e. , something in their birth process seems to favor binaries in which the two stars are essentially identical .",
    "if this is true , it would enhance the double neutron star production , because it increases the number of neutron star pairs that are within 4% of each other in mass .",
    "they did not , however , correct for selection effects , which will probably lower somewhat their estimated number of twins .",
    "prompted by the paper on twins by pinsonneault and stanek @xcite , lee et al .",
    "@xcite made an improved calculation of the ratio of neutron star , low - mass black hole mergers to double neutron star mergers .",
    "the latter could be run up if there were lots of twins .",
    "however selection effects not included in @xcite would have to be taken into account before one could estimate the number quantitatively . in the non - twin population ,",
    "lee et al . found that the number of low - mass black - hole , neutron star binaries would be @xmath9 times greater than double neutron - star binaries . for detection by ligo",
    "the  chirp \" mass would be somewhat greater for the former than the latter , because of the greater mass for the black holes .    in summary",
    ", it is clear to us that there are @xmath246 5 times more low - mass black hole binaries than double neutron star binaries . as of now",
    ", the merging of these can not be distinguished in the short - hard @xmath247-ray bursts .",
    "however the consequences in terms of the two neutron stars in a binary having to be within 4% of each other in mass , with small correction made where there has been some he red giant mass transfer , are growing in number .",
    "we have explained why , in the case of sn1987a , the absence of evidence is evidence for a black hole .",
    "we have been able to arrive at the strangeness condensation phase transition critical point @xmath19 from three different starting points , the first from the zero - density vacuum , the second from the vector manifestation fixed point and the third from the landau fermi - liquid fixed point . in the two last cases ,",
    "the estimate was made more reliable by arguments based on renormalization group flow which made all of the quantities whose behavior with density was unknown rotated out . in particular in the second case , rotated out were the role of the scalar condensate @xmath248 , the explicit chiral symmetry breaking through @xmath29 , the role of strange baryons @xmath249 , the @xmath250 which was often viewed as the doorway state for kaon condensation , all of which figure importantly if one starts from the @xmath18 vacuum .",
    "we therefore favor the second scenario over the others .",
    "( in @xcite a detailed discussion of these matters is given . )",
    "we have shown that the hidden local symmetry in the  vector manifestation \" ( hls - vm ) prescribes the medium dependence imposed by ( wilsonian ) matching to qcd of the quantities entering into the strangeness condensation .",
    "in particular , since hls - vm is a fixed point with vanishing gauge coupling constant , chiral perturbation theory is well - defined . assuming that hls theory represents qcd near the fixed point",
    ", one can efficiently calculate the strangeness condensation by fluctuating about the fixed point .",
    "it turns out that the only degree of freedom we need to take into account is the vector degree of freedom in the form of on - shell constituent quarks . in other words ,",
    "the strangeness condensation can be calculated in the constituent quark model , with the strange quark a passive observer .",
    "although we are at a very early stage of understanding , the recent development of holographic qcd , in particular , the sakai - sugimoto model , that presumably encapsulates qcd at low energy in terms of an infinite tower of hidden local fields promises to confirm or invalidate our main theme .",
    "integrating out the higher members of the tower leaving the lowest could lead to hls - vm theory of harada and yamawaki , with the vector manifestation representing the effect of higher members of the tower when constrained to qcd . at present",
    ", it is not known how to go beyond the large @xmath101 and large t hooft limit in the sakai - sugimoto model but once one knows how to handle certain corrections in the dual sector with appropriate matching to gauge theory qcd , the characteristic feature of the vector manifestation such as the hadronic freedom on which our argument relies could be verified .    in a neutron star the @xmath7 chemical potential @xmath251 , essentially the @xmath7 mass ,",
    "will be lowered by the attractive interaction between the quarks in the neutrons and protons , chiefly by the former , so that at a certain density , which we estimate to be @xmath20 , the @xmath251 becomes equal to @xmath37 .",
    "at that point the electrons change into @xmath7 mesons , which go into an s - wave bose condensate . with the accompanying lowering of pressure ,",
    "the star drops into a black hole .",
    "this we believe is the first phase transition dense compact star matter undergoes which determines the fate of star , that is whether it becomes a neutron star or a black hole .    we believe that this scenario describes the fate of the supernova explosion sn1987a .",
    "what we are sure of is that in the evolution of binary neutron stars , the first - born neutron star will go into a black hole if the two progenitor giants are not within 4% of each other in mass .",
    "( for the low - mass neutron - star binary the situation is slightly shifted , as we explained in the text . )",
    "since our main early interest in kaon condensation was in the disappearance of evidences of the existence of neutron star in sn1987a after it had emitted neutrinos for about 12 seconds , we felt it fitting to adduce even more firm astrophysical observations that shows that there are a large number of low - mass black holes in the universe .",
    "most specific is that we showed that double neutron stars in binaries must be within 4% of each other in mass ; otherwise the binary would end up being one of a neutron star and a low - mass black hole .",
    "observations support the necessity of the neutron star being within 4% of each other in mass within any given binary .",
    "this also means that there are @xmath161 5 times more neutron - star , low - mass black hole binaries than double neutron - star binaries in the galaxy .",
    "finally , putting together all of the above leads us back to the proposal of brown and bethe @xcite that the maximum neutron star mass is @xmath252 , not much higher than the mass of the hulse - taylor pulsar 1913@xmath19517 of @xmath253 .",
    "this is the only accurately measured mass of the more massive neutron stars .",
    "we believe , for example , the probability that j0751@xmath1951807 , of mass @xmath254 but with 95% probability @xmath255 has mass @xmath223 to be substantially higher than for the spectrum of neutron stars in binaries that would exist were @xmath203 neutron stars to be stable .",
    "the announced reduction of the measured mass of j0751@xmath1951807 to @xmath256 goes in the direction consistent with the above reasoning .",
    "the harada and yamawaki hls - vm had predictions that countered well established beliefs .",
    "perhaps the most controversial was the prediction in hls - vm of hadronic freedom , that the interactions between hadrons go to zero as the temperature goes up to @xmath10 from below and the density goes up to @xmath4 from @xmath1 .",
    "this directly contradicted the accepted belief in heavy - ion community that interactions between hadrons became more plentiful and stronger as @xmath179 goes up to @xmath257 from below .",
    "we managed to find what we believe to be the crucial experiment to decide this issue , namely the star experiment of peripheral au@xmath195au collisions which measured @xmath258 ratio @xcite .",
    "we discussed this experiment briefly in sec .",
    "the experiment was so useful because in this peripheral experiment the freeze out temperature was equal to the flash temperature , the temperature at which the hadrons went on shell .",
    "the results of this star experiment directly supported the concept of hadronic freedom in temperature .",
    "we are proposing that the same is the case in density and applies to kaon condensation .",
    "we found in this paper that hls - vm gave unambiguous statements about how to handle the medium dependencies and that is why we are so sure of the results .",
    "needless to say , the crucial element in this argument is the existence of the vector manifestation ( vm ) fixed point which requires the vanishing of the vector meson masses ( in the chiral limit ) .",
    "the vm in harada - yamawaki hls theory is an unambiguously falsifiable prediction : it could be invalidated if an unquenched lattice measurement of the spectral function of the @xmath70 channel @xmath259 showed that the ( real - time ) mass of the @xmath70 meson does not vanish in the chiral limit at @xmath92 .",
    "the question we have not addressed here is this : if kaon condensation is inevitable in compact stars once density reaches @xmath17 , will other forms of exotic states that can take place at higher densities , say , @xmath260 , such as color superconductivity , color flavor locking etc .",
    "be relevant for the physics of compact stars ?",
    "we can offer no definitive answer to this question .",
    "our conjecture is that they will be hidden in the  black - hole nothingness \" inaccessible to the observers .",
