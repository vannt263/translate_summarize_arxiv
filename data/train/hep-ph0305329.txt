    "the primary goal of all high energy heavy ion experiments is to find the phase transition between hadronic matter and quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) as predicted by the lattice qcd .",
    "it is natural then to look at experimental results from such perspective and to scrutinize them for the possible signals of qgp formation . in this work",
    "we would like to concentrate on one characteristic feature , which could signal such phase transition , namely it should be accompanied by enhanced fluctuations in some variables @xcite .",
    "for it turns out that , when measuring in final states only hadronic probes produced with small transverse momenta , the only observables surviving the possible phase transition ( and , in principle , actually depending on its form ) is the observed fluctuation pattern in properly selected variables .",
    "following @xcite we shall be interested in the quantity being the ratio of fluctuations in entropy to fluctuations in energy .",
    "the reason is that , in thermodynamical approach to be pursued here , both quantities are well defined for any form of matter ( confined , mixed and deconfined ) both in early stage of collisions and in the final state of the hadronizing system under consideration .",
    "when produced matter can be treated as an isolated system , energy is conserved and entropy is also expected to be conserved during the expansion and freezeout stages of the hadronization .",
    "therefore simultaneous measurements of both quantities are likely to provide us with information on the equation of state ( eos ) of the hadronizing system .",
    "this ratio can be written ( see appendix a for details ) as @xmath1 here @xmath2 characterizes eos , @xmath3 denotes the pressure and @xmath4 energy density with @xmath5 being the volume of our system and @xmath6 its temperature ( statistical equilibrium is assumed ) .",
    "the entropy of the system , @xmath7 , should be connected with the multiplicity of the produced secondaries , @xmath8 and , similarly , energy released in the production process , @xmath9 , should be connected with the measured sum of transverse momenta , @xmath10 .",
    "when variations of the reaction volume ( identified with the volume of system ) can be neglected , i.e. , for @xmath11 , one gets formula proposed in @xcite as the right quantity the energy dependence of which should be investigated experimentally : @xmath12 notice that @xmath13 is directly sensitive to the equation of state ( eos ) of hadronizing matter because of occurrence of parameter @xmath14 . in what follows",
    "we shall assume that @xmath15 we identify throughout this work @xmath16 and @xmath17 with fluctuations caused by _ all possible sources _ ( as only such are accessible in experiment ) , i.e. , also all our results concerning different estimations of @xmath18 by means of eq . ( [ eq : rf ] ) include influences of all possible sources of fluctuations",
    ". in @xcite @xmath13 has been investigated by using some specific statistical model of nuclear collisions .",
    "the predicted very characteristic shape of energy dependence of this quantity ( non - monotonic , with a single `` shark fin''-like maximum ) was then proposed as a possible signal of qgp phase transition which should therefore be subjected to future experimental tests @xcite .    in this work",
    "we would like to bring attention to the fact that apparently similar kind of fluctuations ( but in function of @xmath0 , which can be connected with the reaction volume , rather than energy , as is the case in @xcite ) have been already observed and reported in @xcite and @xcite . in what follows , using some minimal input , we shall in the next section rewrite results of @xcite in terms of variable @xmath13 defined by ( [ eq : rf ] ) and ( [ eq : assume ] ) , clearly demonstrating that it has similar non - monotonic character as that obtained in @xcite .",
    "it is therefore tempting to argue that these data show us either what has been called in the literature the _ softest point _ of the corresponding eos @xcite or what is named in other investigations the _ critical point _ of eos @xcite .",
    "however , at this stage one not only can not distinguish between both possibilities but even one can not take them very seriously , for when confronting these data with similar data obtained recently in @xcite , which use different measure of fluctuations , one discoveres that no such feature are seen there ( defined in @xcite ) at energies @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 agev for the following centrality bins : @xmath22% , @xmath23% , @xmath24% , @xmath25% and @xmath26% . ]",
    ". still , there are some other possibilities offered recently , as , for example , spinodial decomposition occuring at the hadronization stage @xcite , which deserve also attention .    in section iii we shall also analyse ( with the same aim as above , i.e. , looking for a possible signal of qgp ) recent interferometric data , which provide us information on the interaction volume @xcite .",
    "measured here is the freeze - out volume but in our discussion we identify it with the production volume . ]",
    "it turns out that they lead to similar results for eos as data from @xcite ( albeit this time at different energy ) .",
    "the last section contains our summary whereas appendices contain derivation of our basic formulas .",
    "in @xcite the following measure of fluctuations has been presented as a function of the number of participants @xmath0 ( or `` wounded '' nucleons ) : @xmath27 it increases with @xmath0 , reaches maximum at @xmath28 , and decreases for higher values of @xmath0 . whereas in @xcite",
    "such behaviour has been attributed to the peculiar feature of the hadronization model used , namely to the percolation of hadronizing strings produced in collision process , here we shall connect it directly , in a similar way as in @xcite , to the behaviour of eos of the matter produced at the early stage of the collision . this can be done by rewritting @xmath29 in terms of @xmath13 defined in eq .",
    "( [ eq : rf ] ) .",
    "to do so let us first notice that , because @xmath30 one can write @xmath13 as @xmath31 where @xmath32 on the other hand , as shown in appendix b , @xmath29 can be expressed in terms of @xmath33 and parameter @xmath34 , @xmath35 where @xmath36 $ ] , the correlation coefficient between number of particles @xmath37 and @xmath38 , is our minimal input mentioned above depends on fluctuations in @xmath37 _ and _ on fluctuations in @xmath39 , so far in experiment one measures quantities like @xmath40 or @xmath29 in which both type of fluctuations occur together .",

    "\\label{eq : pomoc}\\ ] ] in addition to the _ a priori _ unknown correlation coefficient @xmath34 there is also some freedom in the choice of sign in ( [ eq : sol ] ) . to fix both of them",
    "let us notice the following :    * it is known that purely statistical or broader fluctuations encountered in all multiparticle production processes , i.e. , the fact that @xmath44 , lead to the condition that @xmath45 * furthermore , analysis of recent ceres data @xcite shows clearly , see fig .",
    "[ fig : fig4 ] below , that parameter @xmath46 is very slowly varying function of energy and multiplicity ( esentially @xmath47 ) .",
    "this practical constancy of fluctuations in @xmath48 means that fluctuations of energy @xmath9 , which are given by fluctuations of @xmath49 , is not so much given by fluctuations in @xmath48 but by fluctuations in multiplicity @xmath37 , cf .",
    ", eq.([eq : a ] ) .",
    "these two observations mean therefore that for the multiplicity distributions of the poissonian type and broader , @xmath13 is limited from below : @xmath50 ( for @xmath51 ) . using this limit together with eq . ( [ eq : sol ] ) one obtaines that also @xmath52 is limited from below , namely @xmath53 because , without any additional correlations between @xmath54 and @xmath37 , the @xmath55 increases with @xmath37 , the positive correlation coefficient , @xmath56 , seems to be the only natural choice . in addition , results of phenix @xcite show that @xmath29 is very small ( actually not exceeding @xmath57 ) . neglecting therefore term with @xmath58 in ( [ eq : limit ] )",
    "one can estimate that @xmath59 ( in our calculations we have put it slightly above this limit using value @xmath60 ) .",
    "it means that @xmath13 corresponds to a stronger than poissonian fluctuations . to be consistent with limitations on @xmath13 imposed by ( [ eq : limitr ] )",
    "we shall choose to the solution with positive sign in ( [ eq : sol ] ) ( the other one would lead to unacceptable small values of @xmath13 ) .",
    "we are now prepared to translate , by using eq .",
    "( [ eq : sol ] ) , the experimental knowledge of @xmath29 and @xmath40 as a function of number of participants provided in @xcite into similar dependence of @xmath13 .",
    "the results are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] . the only unknown feature there is the choice of parameter @xmath34 .",
    "in fact for @xmath61const different values result in essentially the same shape of @xmath13 , only shifted accordingly paralelly up or dow .",
    "the case of @xmath62 would lead to some changes , however .",
    "unfortunately at the moment there are no data available to estimate the functional form of @xmath63 .",

    "@xcite ) with increasing centrality fluctuations of the multiplicity become weaker and the respective multiplicity distributions approach poissonian form .",

    "let us now continue discussion of the parameter @xmath13 from the point of view of its possible connection with the phase transition .",
