    "recent observations from supernovae ( sne ) type ia strongly suggest that the bulk of energy in the universe is repulsive and appears like a dark component ; an unknown form of energy with negative pressure [ in addition to the ordinary dark matter ] which is probably of primordial origin@xcite .",
    "the most natural candidate for dark energy is the cosmological constant ( @xmath8 ) , or equivalently , a perfect fluid obeying the equation of state , @xmath9 , which is usually interpreted as the constant vacuum energy density of all fields existing in the universe .",
    "the @xmath8-term is the simplest but not the unique possibility .",
    "other candidates appearing in the literature are : a relic scalar field component ( sfc ) which is slowly rolling down its potencial@xcite , a decaying vacuum energy density , or a time varying @xmath8-term@xcite , the so - called  x - matter \" , an extra component@xcite characterized by an equation of state @xmath10 ( xcdm ) , and the chaplygin type gas whose equation of state is @xmath11 , where @xmath12 and @xmath13 are positive constants@xcite ( see also lima@xcite for a quick review ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the existence of old high - redshift objects is one of the best methods for constraining the age of the universe , as well the basic cosmological parameters@xcite .",
    "such objects also provide an important key for determining the first epoch of galaxy formation . in this connection , quasars are among the most luminous objects known in the universe and their prominent emission - lines contains valuable information to estimate their ages .",
    "the recently reported age estimates of the apm 08279 + 5255 quasar with a lower limit of 2-gyr - old at redshift @xmath14 is therefore a particularly interesting event@xcite . in this article",
    "we investigate some cosmological implications from the existence of this quasar to a large class of decaying vacuum cosmologies proposed by lima and collaborators@xcite .",
    "some constraints on the first epoch of quasar formation are also discussed .",
    "several groups have searched for old objects at high redshifts@xcite .",
    "such discoveries accentuated even further the already classical  age crisis \" and gave rise to a new variant of this problem , which could be named the high-@xmath15 time scale crisis@xcite .",
    "more recently , hasinger and co - workers @xcite reported the discovery of an ionized fe k edge in the @xmath14 broad absorption line quasar apm 08279 + 5255 .",
    "the fe / o ratio of the absorption material is significantly higher than solar abundance ( fe / o@xmath16 ) , and requires a timescale of @xmath17 gyr with a conservative lower limit age of @xmath18 gyr .",
    "the einstein - de sitter model is not able to explains the age of this object@xcite .",
    "let us now examine how the existence of this quasar constrains the basic parameters defining the time varying @xmath1 cosmologies .",
    "the general age - redshift relation in the @xmath1 models proposed by lima and coworkers@xcite is @xmath19^{{1}\\over{2}}}\\equiv h_{o}^{-1}f(\\omega_{\\rm m } , \\beta , z ) .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for @xmath20 and @xmath21 the above expression reduces to @xmath22 , which is the prediction of the einstein - de sitter model@xcite . in this case",
    ", the age of the universe at redshift @xmath23 is nearly 1 gyr which is much less than the lower limit of the quasar age .",
    "following standard lines , we take for granted that the age of the universe at the specific redshift is bigger than or at least equal to the age of the quasar , namely : @xmath24    where @xmath25 is the estimated age of the quasar and @xmath26 is the dimensionless factor defined by eq . ( 1 ) . note that the denominator of the above expression defines a dimensionless age parameter @xmath27 .",
    "for the lower limit age of the quasar its value and the most recent determinations of the hubble parameter ( @xmath28 @xmath29)@xcite , such a quantity takes values on the interval @xmath30 so that @xmath31 .",
    "therefore , for a given value of @xmath32 , only models having an expanding age bigger than this value at @xmath0 will be compatible with the existence of this object . in order to assure the robustness of our analysis",
    ", we will adopt in our computations the lower bound for the above mentioned value of the hubble parameter , i.e. , @xmath33 @xmath34 .",
    "the figures above show the dimensionless age parameter @xmath35 ( see eq .",
    "( 1 ) ) as a function of the redshift for several values of @xmath2 with @xmath36 ( a , b ) , and @xmath5 ( c , d ) .",
    "the shadowed regions in the graphs were determined from the minimal value of @xmath37 .",
    "models with curves crossing the rectangles are ruled out because they yield an age parameter smaller than the minimal value required by the presence of the quasar apm 08279 + 5255 . by assuming an age estimate of 2 gyr one may see from plot ( a ) that the minimal value for the vacuum energy density is @xmath38 , which provides a minimal total age of @xmath39 gyr . from figure ( b ) , we see that the minimal value of @xmath2 required is @xmath40 . for @xmath41 ,",
    "the minimal values of @xmath2 are 0.15 and 0.32 for 2 and 3 gyr , respectively ( see also table arising on figure 2 ) .",
    "such limits are less stringents than the values inferred from angular size - redshift relation where @xmath2 falls on the interval@xcite [ 0.58,0.76 ] .",
    "however , we stress that constraints from angular size redshift relation should be taken with some caution because a statistical analysis describing the intrinsic length distribution of the sources is still lacking . further , although being relatively easy for decaying vacuum cosmologies to solve the age - redshift problem , the same does not happens for other classes of dark energy models like constant @xmath8 or xcdm cosmologies@xcite .",
    "in the present section , we discuss how the age estimates of the quasar apm 08279 + 5255 constrain the epoch of quasar formation .",
    "since we have neglected a possible incubation time in our computations , the obtained redshift formation @xmath42 will be a conservative lower bound . for look - back time calculations",
    ", such a hypothesis can be translated as@xcite @xmath43^{{1}\\over{2 } } } \\geq t_q,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the inequality signal comes from the fact that the universe is older than or at least has the same age of any observed structure .",
    "naturally , models for which @xmath44 are clearly incompatible with the existence of this particular object , being ruled out in a natural way . in fig .",
    "2 we show the @xmath45 plane allowed by the existence of the quasar apm 08279 + 5255 for @xmath1 models . as before ,",
    "two age estimates were assumed : 2 gyr ( solid curve ) and 3 gyr ( dashed curve ) . as should be physically expected ,",
    "since the effect of dark matter is decelerate the cosmic expansion and @xmath42 is smaller for larger values of @xmath46 . ] , the larger the contribution of @xmath46 the larger the value of @xmath42 that is required in order to account for the existence of this quasar within these cosmological scenarios .    in this way",
    ", the smallest value for the formation redshift occurs for a completely empty universe ( @xmath47 ) .",
    "we find @xmath48 .",
    "for a low - density universe with @xmath49 we obtain @xmath50 . for an universe with @xmath51",
    "we obtain @xmath52 .",
    "the basic results are presented in the table appearing in figure 2 .    summarizing",
    ", we have investigated some observational constraints on deflationary cosmologies provided by the age of the old quasar apm 08279 + 5255 .",
    "if the estimated age of this object is correct , at light of the above results , we conclude that such models are more efficient to explain the old quasar at @xmath14 than constant @xmath8 dark energy models . even for a value of @xmath53 the age crisis at high @xmath15",
    "is solved .",
    "concerning the first epoch of quasar formation the minimal redshift formation required is @xmath54 .",
    "naturally , new tests and analysis must be developed in order to know if deflationary cosmologies may be realistic models of the universe .",
