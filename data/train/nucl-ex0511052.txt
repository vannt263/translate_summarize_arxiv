    "the cooler synchrotron ( cosy ) of the forschungszentrum jlich ( fzj )  @xcite accelerates and stores protons up to 2.88gev and deuterons up to 2.23gev both for experiments internal to the ring and for those using an extracted beam . in the case of protons ,",
    "an extensive series of successful measurements with polarized beams and targets was carried out with the internal edda detector  @xcite and , used as a polarimeter , it can determine the polarization of the beam with high precision .",
    "cosy is now embarking on a program of investigations  @xcite with polarized deuteron beams and polarized deuterium storage cell targets  @xcite at the anke magnetic spectrometer  @xcite , placed at an internal target station of the cosy ring  @xcite .",
    "much valuable work has already been carried out to investigate the spin manipulation of the internal deuteron beams in cosy  @xcite . however , in order to accomplish the stated program  @xcite , it is a priority to establish polarization standards for the deuteron beams , which are already available at cosy , to better than 5% .",
    "higher precision than this has recently been achieved in anke for polarized proton beams  @xcite .    due to their much smaller anomalous magnetic moment , deuterons , unlike protons , do not have to cross any first ",
    "order depolarizing resonances while being accelerated in cosy , where the typical working point tunes are @xmath2 through @xmath3  @xcite . even in the case of protons , higher order resonances do not lead to any significant degradation .",
    "it is therefore expected that there should be little or no loss of polarization during acceleration and this has indeed been the experience over many years at the saturne synchrotron , which worked over a similar energy range  @xcite . nevertheless , it is important to check that this is true at cosy .",
    "this has been done by measuring the beam polarization before and during the acceleration , using calibrated polarimeters , and then deriving the analyzing powers for four distinct nuclear reactions at 1170mev that were studied simultaneously with the anke spectrometer : @xmath4he@xmath5 , @xmath6 elastic scattering , @xmath7 , and quasi ",
    "free @xmath8 . in all these cases consistency was found with previously published data .",
    "this confirms that we can use the low energy polarimeter ( lep ) to monitor accurately the beam polarization though , for its accurate determination at high energies , greater reliance would be placed upon measurements within anke itself .",
    "the secondary calibration standards established at 1170mev can , when necessary , be exported to other energies , as is routinely done for protons  @xcite .    in sec .",
    "[ chap : ion - source ] we describe the construction and operation of the polarized ion source , which is based upon the charge exchange with cesium atoms . in the configuration of the radiofrequency transitions used here , the polarized ion source provides one unpolarized plus seven other states . for each of these states",
    "there is an optimal beam vector and tensor polarization .",
    "however , these are never reached in practice and the actual values have to be established using a beam polarimeter .",
    "the deuteron beam is injected into the cosy ring at 75.6mev .",
    "the lep of sec .",
    "[ chap : beam - polarimeter ] , which is based upon scattering from a carbon target , is used to measure the beam polarization at this energy .",
    "unfortunately , the lep is only sensitive to the vector polarization of the beam , but this drawback is well made up by measurements with the edda polarimeter  @xcite using elastic deuteron  proton scattering at 270mev , for which accurate analyzing powers are available  @xcite . consistency is found state  by  state for these two lower energy measurements , though the calibration standard is more precise for the 270mev data .",
    "only the principal elements of the anke spectrometer , including the silicon tracking telescopes ( stt ) used to measure very slow particles emerging from the thin targets , are discussed in sec .",
    "[ chap : anke ] .",
    "the following section [ anke_measurements ] describes the study of the four nuclear reactions of interest in anke and shows that the results obtained from the two measurements of the vector analyzing power and three of the tensor are in complete agreement with previously published results .",
    "our conclusions are drawn in sec .",

    "the polarized colliding beams source at cosy  @xcite comprises three major groups of components , the pulsed atomic beam source , the cesium beam source , and the charge  exchange and extraction region . the set ",
    "up is shown schematically in fig .",
    "[ pis ] .",
    "the atomic beam source produces an intense pulsed polarized atomic hydrogen or deuterium beam .",
    "the gas molecules are dissociated in an inductively coupled rf discharge and a high degree of dissociation is maintained by having a special admixture of small amounts of nitrogen and oxygen that reduces surface and volume recombination .",
    "the current output of the source depends sensitively on the relative fluxes of the gases and on their timing with respect to the dissociator radio frequency .",
    "the atoms are cooled to about 30k by passing through an aluminum nozzle of 20 mm length and 3 mm diameter and the resulting beam is focused by an optimized set of permanent hexapoles into the charge  exchange region . by cooling the supersonic atomic beam , the acceptance of the hexapole system and the dwell time in the charge ",
    "exchange region are increased , though scattering in the vicinity of the nozzle reduces partially these beneficial effects .",
    "a peak intensity of @xmath9atoms / s has been measured within a diameter of 10 mm at the exit of the hexapole chamber .",
    "the atomic @xmath10 beam with high nuclear polarization collides with the fast neutral @xmath11 beam inside the charge ",
    "exchange region and an electron is transferred through the @xmath12 reaction .",
    "the @xmath13 ions are extracted from this region by electric fields before being deflected magnetically through @xmath14 , subsequently they pass a wien filter that provides the proper spin alignment for injection into the cyclotron julic , which is the pre ",
    "accelerator for cosy .",
    "the fast neutral cesium beam is produced in a two  step process .",
    "cesium vapor is thermally ionized on a hot porous tungsten surface at a beam potential around 45kv and the beam is then focused by a quadrupole triplet to the charge ",
    "exchange region .",
    "the space ",
    "charge compensation of the intense beam is improved by feeding @xmath15mbar@xmath16s@xmath17 argon to the beam tube following the extraction .",
    "cesium sputtering and contamination generally impedes long  term reliability so that pulsed operation of the cesium ionizer has been included in the source  @xcite .",
    "the cesium pulses reach peak intensities of over 10ma with a width of about 10ms . for routine operation ,",
    "cesium pulses with a 5ma flat shape of 20ms width and a repetition rate of 0.5hz are used  @xcite , matched to the cosy injection scheme .",
    "a neutralizer is placed between the quadrupoles and the cesium deflector .",
    "this consists of a cesium oven , a cell filled with cesium vapor , and a magnetically driven flapper valve between the oven and the cell .",
    "the remaining @xmath18 beam is deflected in front of the solenoid to the cesium cup .",
    "routinely , a neutralizer efficiency of over 90% is achieved .    the highly selective charge ",
    "exchange ionization produces only little unpolarized background that would reduce the nuclear beam polarization . in the charge ",
    "exchange region , various beam properties can be adjusted .",
    "transverse emittance can be traded for polarization by varying the solenoid s magnetic field .",
    "the field strength during normal operation is 1.8 kg .",
    "the magnitude of the electrical drift field inside the solenoid can be tuned to optimize the energy spread of the beam .",
    "the electric field gradient amounts to 0.51.0v@xmath19 .",
    "a monotonic gradient , in combination with a double buncher system in the injection beam line to the cyclotron , leads to an improved bunching factor of about four , compared to a factor of two for unpolarized beams .    without modification of the system , the colliding ",
    "beams ion source can provide negatively  charged polarized hydrogen and deuterium beams of comparable intensities . to prepare polarized deuterons with the desired combinations of vector and tensor polarization ,",
    "the atomic beam part of the source is equipped with new radiofrequency transitions ( rfts ) .",
    "these transition units are operated at the magnetic fields and radiofrequencies that allow exchange of occupation numbers of the different hyperfine states in deuterium  @xcite .",
    "a set of three installed devices , rft@xmath20 to rft@xmath21 , allows a large number of combinations to be delivered to experiments , as described in the following section .",
    "the polarized @xmath22 or @xmath23 ion beam delivered by the source , is pre  accelerated in the cyclotron julic and injected by charge exchange into the cosy ring .",
    "the acceleration of vertically polarized protons and deuterons at cosy is discussed in detail for example in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the scheme used to produce the polarized deuteron beam consists of eight different states , including one unpolarized state and seven combinations of vector and tensor polarizations , obtained by switching on or off the three radiofrequency transitions rft@xmath24 , where @xmath25 .",
    "the states and the nominal ( ideal ) values of the polarizations ( @xmath0 and @xmath1 ) and relative intensities ( @xmath26 ) are listed in table  [ tablelepedda ] .",
    "the polarized ion source was switched to a different polarization state for each injection into cosy , in order to reduce the systematic errors .",
    "the duration of a cosy cycle was sufficiently long ( @xmath27s ) to ensure stable conditions for the injection of the next state @xcite .",
    "after the seventh state , the source was reset to the zeroth mode and the pattern repeated for the next injection .",
    "the anke data acquisition system received status bits from the source , latched during injection .",
    "this ensured the correct identification of the polarization states during the experiment .",
    "to assist in the optimization of the polarization of the beams inside cosy , a low energy polarimeter ( lep , located in the injection beam line ) consisting of a uhv chamber with eight flanges covered with thin stainless steel foils has been used  @xcite . the moveable target frame is equipped with viewers , allowing adjustment of the beam position .",
    "several carbon targets can be used for polarimetry measurements based on @xmath28c elastic scattering .",
    "it is possible to place detectors at azimuthal angles @xmath29 , @xmath14 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 in the ranges of polar angles @xmath32 to @xmath33 and @xmath34 to @xmath35 .",
    "nai scintillators , directly coupled to photomultipliers , are used for particle identification .",
    "a set of exchangeable apertures , placed in front of the scintillators , defines the acceptance of the detector to be @xmath36 for the measurements discussed here .",
    "the lep is used at the cosy injection energy of @xmath37mev ( @xmath38mev / c ) .",
    "studies of the cross section , analyzing power @xmath39 , and the resulting figure of merit for 70mev  @xcite and 76mev  @xcite deuterons suggest that the polarimeter should work best if the detectors are placed to accept polar angles near @xmath40 .",
    "unfortunately , under such conditions the tensor analyzing powers are very small for this reaction so that the lep is only sensitive to the vector polarization of the beam  @xcite .",
    "taking the two data sets  @xcite together , we deduce that @xmath41 at 75.6mev .",
