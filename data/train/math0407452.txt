    "the transformation is defined on the product space @xmath11 by @xmath12 in this context , the sub-@xmath3-algebra @xmath13 is clearly a factor of @xmath14 .",
    "since the work of abramov and rokhlin @xcite , this kind of construction is known to be the general model for a system with factor : if @xmath4 is a factor of @xmath1 , then there exists an isomorphism @xmath15 between @xmath1 and a skew product @xmath14 constructed as above , with @xmath16 .",
    "in such a situation , we say that @xmath1 is an _ extension _ of @xmath17 .      to understand precisely the way a factor",
    "is embedded in the dynamical system , one is led to study the behaviour of the system _ relative to the factor _ ; to this end , relative properties are defined which are generalizations of absolute properties of dynamical systems .",
    "for example , one can define weak - mixing relative to a factor ( see e.g. @xcite ) , or the property of being a k - system relative to a factor @xcite .",
    "we are interested in this work in the property of being mixing relative to a factor .",

    "@xmath4-relatively mixing _ if @xmath18    as for the absolute property of mixing , it is possible to define mixing relative to a factor of any order @xmath19 . the property described by  ( [ eq : defmr ] ) corresponds to relative mixing of order 2 ( twofold relative mixing ) ; for relative mixing of order 3 ( threefold relative mixing ) , ( [ eq : defmr ] ) should be replaced by    @xmath20    whether ( absolute ) twofold mixing implies threefold mixing is a well - known open problem in ergodic theory .",
    "the main goal of this work is to show that as far as relative mixing is concerned , twofold does not necessarily imply threefold .",
    "[ erm23 ] we can construct a dynamical system @xmath0 with a factor @xmath4 such that @xmath1 is @xmath4-relatively twofold mixing but not @xmath4-relatively threefold mixing .",
    "the dynamical system announced in theorem  [ erm23 ] is constructed as a skew product , whose base @xmath7 is obtained as follows : take @xmath21 equipped with the lebesgue measure @xmath22 on the borel @xmath3-algebra @xmath23 .",
    "the transformation @xmath17 can be viewed as a triadic version of the von neumann - kakutani transformation ; we describe now its construction by the _ cutting and stacking _ method ( see figure  [ fig : base ] ) .",
    "we begin by splitting @xmath9 into three subintervals of length @xmath24 ; we set @xmath25 .",
    "the transformation @xmath17 translates @xmath26 onto @xmath27 , and translates @xmath28 onto @xmath29 .",
    "at this first step , @xmath17 is not yet defined on @xmath30 . in general , after the @xmath31-th step of the construction , @xmath9 has been split into @xmath32 intervals of same length : @xmath33 .",
    "these intervals form a so - called _ rokhlin tower _ with base @xmath34 and height @xmath32 .",
    "such a tower is usually represented by putting the intervals one on top the other , the transformation @xmath17 mapping each point to the one exactly above . at this step , the transformation is not yet defined on @xmath35 .",
    "step @xmath36 starts by chopping the base @xmath34 into three subintervals of the same length , the first of which is denoted by @xmath37 .",
    "the @xmath31-th rokhlin tower is thus split into three columns , which are stacked together to get the @xmath36st tower .",
    "this amounts to mapping @xmath38 onto the second piece of @xmath34 by a translation , and @xmath39 onto the third piece of @xmath34 .",
    "@xmath17 is now defined everywhere except on @xmath40 .",
    "the iteration of this construction for all @xmath41 defines @xmath17 everywhere on @xmath9 .",

    ", @xmath73 is the integer @xmath65 such that @xmath75 is at the step @xmath31 of the construction of @xmath17 .",
    "we then set @xmath76 from the properties of @xmath66 , it is easy to derive that @xmath77 is always an automorphism of @xmath10 . from now on ,",
    "we denote by @xmath1 the skew product on @xmath78 equipped with the product measure @xmath79 defined by @xmath80 let @xmath4 be the factor of @xmath1 given by the @xmath3-algebra @xmath13 .",

    "for each @xmath47 , we denote by @xmath82 the point of @xmath44 defined by @xmath83 . from the construction of the rokhlin cocycle , while @xmath84 has not reached the top of tower @xmath31 , @xmath55 is only transformed by some @xmath85 with @xmath86 .",
    "therefore , in the sequence @xmath87 ( corresponding to the climb of @xmath74 upward tower @xmath31 ) , only the first @xmath31-block is modified and these modifications do not depend on the coordinates of @xmath55 with indices at least @xmath53 .",
    "we are particularly interested in the sequence @xmath88 of coordinates with null index , which we see as a random colouring of the climb of @xmath74 upward tower @xmath31 . from the preceding remark ,",
    "this colouring only depends on the first @xmath31-block of @xmath55 .",
    "therefore there exists some map @xmath89 such that @xmath90    [ taun+1 ] assume further that @xmath74 lies in the base of the first or second column in tower @xmath31 ( @xmath91 or @xmath92 ) .",
    "then @xmath93    it is easily checked by induction on @xmath31 , using the fact that @xmath71 .",
    "lemma  [ taun+1 ] gives a relation between @xmath94 and @xmath95 .",
    "indeed , if @xmath74 lies in @xmath37 , the climbing of @xmath74 upward tower @xmath60 can be seen as three successive climbings of @xmath74 upward tower @xmath31 , whose colourings are given by @xmath96 , @xmath97 and @xmath98 .",
    "it follows that the colouring of the first climbing of @xmath74 upward tower @xmath31 is coded by the first @xmath31-block @xmath56 of @xmath55 , the colouring of the second climbing of @xmath74 upward tower @xmath31 is coded by the second @xmath31-block @xmath99 , and the colouring of the third climbing of @xmath74 upward tower @xmath31 is coded by their termwise product @xmath100 .",
    "hence , if @xmath101 is an @xmath60-block which is the concatenation of the two @xmath31-blocks @xmath59 , we have @xmath102 therefore , the sequence @xmath103 of coding maps is entirely determined by @xmath104 and the recurrence relation ( [ eq : recurrence ] ) .",
    "the proof of the following lemma follows easily :    [ codage_produit ] let @xmath61 and @xmath62 be two @xmath31-blocks .",
    "then @xmath105    from the preceding observations , we can deduce some properties of the conditional law of the colouring process knowing @xmath74 .",
    "[ colourings ] let @xmath72 and @xmath41 .",
    "let @xmath106 be the smallest integer such that @xmath107 .",
    "we denote by @xmath108 , @xmath109 and @xmath110 the respective random colouring of the three successive climbings of @xmath74 upward tower @xmath31 .",
    "the conditional law of @xmath111 knowing @xmath4 satisfies the following properties :    * @xmath108 , @xmath109 and @xmath110 are identically distributed ; * @xmath108 , @xmath109 and @xmath110 are pairwise independent ; * @xmath112 .",
    "since @xmath4 is a @xmath1-invariant @xmath3-algebra , we can always assume to simplify the notations that @xmath113 ( @xmath91 ) .",
    "it follows from what has been seen before that @xmath108 , @xmath109 and @xmath110 are given respectively by @xmath114 , @xmath115 and @xmath116 .",
    "but these three @xmath31-blocks @xmath56 , @xmath99 and @xmath100 are identically distributed and pairwise independent . therefore , the three colourings are themselves identically distributed and pairwise independent .",
    "the equality @xmath112 is a straightforward consequence of lemma  [ codage_produit ] .",
    "it follows easily from proposition  [ colourings ] that the property  ( [ eq : defmr ] ) characterizing twofold mixing relatively to the factor @xmath4 is true when @xmath117 and @xmath118 are measurable with respect to a finite number of coordinates of the colouring process @xmath119 .",
    "indeed , in such a case we can find an integer @xmath31 ( depending on @xmath74 ) such that @xmath117 and @xmath118 are measurable with respect to one of the blocks @xmath120 ( @xmath121 or @xmath122 ) defined in the previous proposition .",
    "then , as soon as @xmath123 , @xmath117 and @xmath124 are given by two blocks @xmath125 ( for some @xmath126 ) which are independent under the conditional law knowing @xmath4 .    then , ( [ eq : defmr ] ) extends by density to every sets @xmath117 and @xmath118 measurable with respect to the @xmath3-algebra generated by @xmath4 and the colouring process @xmath119 . but",
    "this @xmath3-algebra is easily shown to be the whole @xmath127 , since knowing @xmath74 and @xmath119 we can always recover each coordinate @xmath128 , @xmath129 .",
    "( details are left to the reader . )",
    "it follows that the system is @xmath4-relatively twofold mixing .",
    "however , the system is not @xmath4-relatively threefold mixing : if @xmath117 , @xmath118 and @xmath130 are defined by @xmath131 we have @xmath132 but for each @xmath41 and each @xmath74 in the first column of tower @xmath31 , @xmath133",
    "the question of the existence of a system which is twofold but not threefold mixing is strongly connected with the following question : does there exist a joining of three copies of some weakly mixing , zero - entropy dynamical system which is pairwise independent but which is not the product measure ? in @xcite , lemaczyk , mentzen and nakada answer positively to the _ relative _ version of this problem : they construct a relatively weakly - mixing extension @xmath1 of an ergodic rotation @xmath134 , and a 3-joining @xmath135 of @xmath1 identifying the three copies of @xmath134 , which is pairwise but not threewise independent relative to @xmath134 .",
    "however their construction does not seem to come from an extension which is twofold but not threefold relatively mixing .",
    "the example which we have presented above can easily be modified in order to make the dynamical system in the base weakly mixing .",
    "indeed , we can replace the triadic von neumann - kakutani by chacon s transformation , whose construction is similar with the only following difference : in each step of the construction we add a supplementary _ spacer _ interval between second and third column .",
    "the sequence @xmath136 of the heights of the successive towers thus satisfies @xmath137 .",
    "it is well known that chacon s transformation is weakly , but not strongly , mixing . defining @xmath77 in a similar way when @xmath74 does not lie in some spacer , and @xmath138 in any spacer , we get the same conclusion concerning twofold but not threefold relative mixing .",
    "the lack of threefold relative mixing is checked by considering , for @xmath74 in the first column of tower @xmath31 , @xmath139 .",
    "then it is natural to look for a similar result with the dynamical system in the base strongly mixing .",
    "indeed , it is easily shown that if @xmath134 is mixing and if @xmath1 is @xmath4-relatively mixing , then @xmath1 is mixing .",
    "this would give some hope to get a transformation that is twofold but not threefold mixing .",
    "however , there seem to be serious obstacles to achieving the same kind of construction with a mixing base .      in the present work we have used the definition of relative mixing defined by the convergence to zero in probability ( or equivalently in @xmath140 ) of the sequence",
    "@xmath141 an other possible definition of relative mixing is used by rahe in his work on factors of markov processes @xcite : in this paper , a process @xmath142 ( with @xmath143 ) is said _",
    "@xmath4-relatively mixing _ if , for all @xmath117 and @xmath118 measurable with respect of a finite number of cooordinates of the process @xmath144 , the convergence of  ( [ suite ] ) to zero holds almost surely .    the difference between these two definitions",
    "is discussed in a recent work of rudolph @xcite , where it is shown that there exists a system which is relatively mixing with respect to one of his factors in the @xmath140 sense , but not in the almost - sure sense .",
    "rudolph also shows that checking almost - sure convergence of  ( [ suite ] ) to zero for a dense class of subsets @xmath117 and @xmath118 ( as in rahe s definition ) implies that the same convergence holds for _ every _ @xmath117 and @xmath118 .",
    "it is not difficult to see that , for the example we presented here , the same results concerning twofold and threefold relative mixing hold if we replace @xmath140 convergence by almost - sure convergence ."
