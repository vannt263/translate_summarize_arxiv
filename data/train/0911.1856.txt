    "a natural extension of this picture is to apply this effective lagrangian approach to heavy - light meson strong decays involving light pseudoscalar or vector mesons , which would be a good place to examine the validity of the light axial and vector fields in such a transition . on the one hand ,",
    "the quark - meson coupling is the same as that defined in meson photoproduction which is proportional to the meson decay constant . on the other hand , the heavy - light meson in the initial and final state would provide information about the coupling form factor and can be calculated in the quark model framework .",
