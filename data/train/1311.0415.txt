    "since the fabrication of dye - sensitized solar cells ( dsscs ) in @xmath13  @xcite , many researches have been done for enhancing the performance and stability of these cells . during the last two decades",
    ", dsscs have taken a lot of attention because of their low cost and ease of manufacturing .",
    "the efficiency of dsscs can be influenced by various characters such as charge recombination  @xcite , light absorption by dye  @xcite , specific surface area and porosity  @xcite , electron transport  @xcite and so on .",
    "these parameters can be controlled by a variety of approaches like using different dyes  @xcite , semiconductors  @xcite or electrolytes  @xcite , changing morphology  @xcite or band gap of semiconductors  @xcite , photon management for light scattering  @xcite , etc  @xcite . among these methods ,",
    "photon management is used to enhance the photon path length in order to increase the probability of light absorption by dye .",
    "the most successful implementation of photon management in dsscs is usage of diffuse scattering layer  @xcite .",
    "this scattering layer , which is deposited on the top of photoanode main layer , is consisted of large size particles with sizes between @xmath14-@xmath15 nm .",
    "these particles are made of transition metal oxide with high refractive index such as tio@xmath0 . in recent times , disordered structures such as one , two or three",
    "dimensional photonic crystals ( @xmath16dpc , @xmath17dpc , @xmath18dpc )  @xcite and tio@xmath0 hollow spheres  @xcite have been used as scattering layer instead of tio@xmath0 filled spheres .",
    "the replacement of tio@xmath0 hollow spheres with tio@xmath0 filled spheres has leaded to increment of light absorbance as is shown in ref .",
    "[ 20 ] .    in another implementation of photon management ,",
    "a mixture of both small and large particles is employed in photoanode in order to scatter light  @xcite .",
    "usage of porous structures in photoanode is another possibility for light scattering and improving dye absorption  @xcite .",
    "many researches have been carried out to create porosities and cavities in the photoanode thin film .",
    "recently , polystyrene ball embedded in a paste of tio@xmath0 has created cavities during sintering process .",
    "the role of these cavities is to scatter light and increase light absorption by dye  @xcite .    in this research ,",
    "carbon nanospheres powder was synthesized by hydrothermal method that is a facile and low cost method .",
    "different amounts of carbon nanospheres were mixed with a paste of tio@xmath0 nanostructure consisted of @xmath19 @xmath20 nm tio@xmath0 nanocrystals as describe below .",
    "consequentially , effect of tio@xmath0 porosity in photoanode on absorption of dye , light scattering , charge recombination , and chemical capacitance are investigated . ultimately , an energy conversion efficiency up to @xmath12 achieved for @xmath18 @xmath21wt .",
    "of carbon nanospheres mixed with tio@xmath0 .",
    "synthesis of carbon nanospheres was done with polycondensation reaction of glucose under hydrothermal conditions described in ref .",
    "a @xmath22 m aqueous solution of glucose was prepared .",
    "@xmath23 ml of this solution was kept in @xmath24 ml teflon lined autoclave and heated for @xmath25 h at @xmath26c .",
    "the black or brown products were centrifuged and washed with ethanol and water three times and dried at 80@xmath27c for more than @xmath28 h.      for mixing carbon nanospheres powder and commercial tio@xmath0 paste consisting of @xmath19 @xmath20 nm tio@xmath0 nanoparticles , carbon nanospheres were dissolved in ethanol to obtain @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath28 wt.@xmath21 solutions .",
    "these solutions were sonicated to disperse completely and then mixed with tio@xmath0 paste with a weight ratio of @xmath16:@xmath17 .",
    "the resultant mixture was dispersed with ultrasonic titanium probe and then was concentrated with rotary - evaporator to remove ethanol .",
    "five different tio@xmath0 pastes were prepared with various weight percentages of ethanolic solutions of carbon nanospheres about @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath5 , and @xmath32 and named t@xmath33 , t@xmath16 , t@xmath17 , t@xmath18 and",
    "t@xmath28 , respectively .      for preparing dssc working electrode , fto glass ( @xmath18 mm thickness , @xmath34/@xmath35 , dyesol ) was first washed with detergent and rinsed with di water",
    ". then it was cleaned by using an ultrasonic bath with di water , @xmath36 m hcl solution in ethanol , acetone , and ethanol for @xmath37 min each .",
    "the washed fto was heated up to @xmath38c for @xmath37 min . afterwards",
    "a compact blocking layer of tio@xmath0 was deposited onto fto by immersing fto into @xmath39 mm aqueous ticl@xmath40 solution for @xmath41 min at @xmath42c and washed with di water and ethanol .",
    "the next layer was a porous tio@xmath0 layer ( t@xmath33 , t@xmath16 , t@xmath17 , t@xmath18 or t@xmath28 ) deposited by doctor blade technique with @xmath19 @xmath43 @xmath44 m thickness .",

    "after cooling naturally to @xmath50c temperature , tio@xmath0 electrodes were immersed into a @xmath51 mm n@xmath52 ( dyesol ) dye solution in ethanol for @xmath20-@xmath53 h. in this research five different working electrodes ( t@xmath33 , t@xmath16 , t@xmath17 , t@xmath18 , and t@xmath28 ) were prepared corresponding to the different tio@xmath0 pastes .      for preparing dssc counter electrode ,",
    "a hole with diameter about @xmath45-@xmath54 mm was drilled on the fto glass .",
    "then the fto glass was washed as described above for fto working electrode but instead for @xmath45 min .",
    "after that , the fto was heated to @xmath55c for @xmath37 min .",
    "the thermal decomposition method was employed to deposit the pt catalyst on the fto glass .",
    "whit this purpose , a drop of @xmath56 mm h@xmath0ptcl@xmath57 solution in ethanol was applied on the fto glass and annealed at @xmath55c for @xmath37 min .",
    "the electrolyte i@xmath58/@xmath59 consisted of @xmath36 m lii , @xmath36 m i@xmath0 , @xmath22 m @xmath28-tert - butylpyridine , and @xmath60 m tetrabutylammonium iodide in acetonitrile .",
    "the dye loaded porous tio@xmath0 photoanode and the pt counter electrode were sealed together with a @xmath41 @xmath44 m surlyn ( dyesol ) spacer around the tio@xmath0 active area ( @xmath61 @xmath9 ) .",
    "the liquid electrolyte ( i@xmath58/@xmath59 ) was injected into assembled cells . at the end",
    ", the hole of counter electrode was covered by a glass ( @xmath16cm*@xmath16 cm ) and sealed by a spacer .",
    "the morphology of carbon nanospheres and tio@xmath0 nanoparticles and the thickness of the layer were observed by field- emission scanning electron microscope ( hitachi s-@xmath62 ) .",
    "the current - voltage ( i - v ) characteristics of the fabricated dsscs were measured under solar simulator illumination of am @xmath63 ( @xmath1 mw/@xmath9 ) .",
    "the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy ( eis ) measurements of the cells were performed with an iviumstat .",
    "the eis measurements were carried out in dark conditions and in room temperature , by applying a sinusoidal potential perturbation of 10 mv with the frequency ranging between @xmath16 mhz and @xmath64 hz at different applied forward biases .",
    "incident photon to current conversion efficiency ( ipce ) spectra were recorded on a jarrell ash monochromator using a @xmath1 w halogen lamp and a calibrated photodiode ( thorlabs ) .",

    "shows field - emission scanning electron microscopy ( fe - sem ) images of carbon nanospheres ( a ) , as well as cross section ( b ) and top view ( c , d ) of tio@xmath0 thin film . in figure  1a ,",
    "the spherical morphology with the size range of @xmath1-@xmath2 nm is indicated .",
    "figure  1b shows cross sectional fe - sem image of the tio@xmath0 thin film deposited on fto substrate .",
    "this figure confirms that the tio@xmath0 thin film had the thickness of about @xmath43  @xmath44 m .",
    "figure  1c and d show the top view fe - sem images of the sintered tio@xmath0 with and without carbon nanospheres for t@xmath33 and t@xmath18 photoanodes .",
    "these images make the point clear that adding carbon nanospheres to tio@xmath0 paste increases porosity of tio@xmath0 thin films . during tio@xmath0 sintering processes ,",
    "carbon nanospheres were removed at @xmath67c and leaded to the creation of cavities  @xcite .",
    "these cavities enlarged the surface area and thus increased the number of absorbed dye molecules ( n@xmath52 dye ) on the tio@xmath0 thin film .",
    "the i - v curves of the different dsscs fabricated with the t@xmath33 , t@xmath16 , t@xmath17 , t@xmath18 , and t@xmath28 photoanodes are depicted in . table  [ table ] lists photovoltaic parameters of the t@xmath33 , t@xmath16 , t@xmath17 , t@xmath18 , and t@xmath28 dsscs . as seen in table  [ table ] , the absorbed dye molecules for t@xmath18 photoanode is maximum with an increment of about @xmath68 compared to t@xmath33 photoanode . the effect of porosity on the cells has also improved the current density of the cells so that j@xmath69 has increased from @xmath7 ma/@xmath9 for t@xmath33 cell to @xmath8 ma/@xmath9 for t@xmath18 cell .",
    "this improvement of j@xmath69 stems from more dye loading and light scattering due to the presence of the porosity in the photoanode .",

    "the fill factor behaviour can be easily justified based on the change in current density .",
    "the increment of current density causes high electron concentration leading to a greater resistance of the cells and therefore decreases the fill factor .    to determine the absorbance of the dye - loaded porous tio@xmath0 layers , uv - vis spectra were measured .",
    "shows uv - vis spectra of the dye - sensitized t@xmath33 , t@xmath16 , t@xmath17 , t@xmath18 , and t@xmath28 photoanodes . as seen in , light absorbance by the dye - sensitized tio@xmath0 increases from t@xmath33 up to t@xmath18 sample and decreases from t@xmath18 to t@xmath28 .",
    "diffuse reflectance was measured in order to investigate optical properties of t@xmath33 , t@xmath16 , t@xmath17 , t@xmath18 , and t@xmath28 electrodes in the absence of dye sensitization .",
    "diffuse reflectance spectrum is an effective analysis for indicating the light scattering ability of samples . clearly reveals the effect of the carbon nanospheres on diffuse reflectance . as shown in , the ability of light scattering of the samples increases by increasing of the weight ratio of carbon nanospheres mixed with tio@xmath0 . increasing large cavities of size range @xmath98-@xmath2 nm can be ideal for light scattering in visible region .",
    "indicates that the light scattering monotonically increases from t@xmath33 to t@xmath28 . on the other hand , the light absorbance by dye plotted in becomes maximum for t@xmath18 and decreases by increasing the porosity of tio@xmath0 photoanode further .",
    "this behaviour can be explained based on the size of carbon nanospheres . because the carbon nanospheres have the size range of @xmath1-@xmath2 nm , the number of large cavities increase by increasing the weight ratio of carbon nanospheres .",
    "consequently , the light scattering continues to increase from t@xmath18 to t@xmath28 while dye loading starts to decrease beyond the optimum amount of porosity @xmath18 @xmath21 wt ..     photoanodes.,width=283 ]    schematically shows how the presence of large cavities leads to the light scattering and enhances the optical path length in photoanode .",
    "these cavities increase multiple scattering of light and improve optical properties of the cell ( better light trapping and less transmittance ) .",
    "small cavities make high surface area which lead to more dye loading and light harvesting .",
    "the incident photon - to - current conversion efficiency ( ipce ) is plotted in for t@xmath33 and t@xmath18 cells .",
    "this figure demonstrates that t@xmath18 cell has a higher ipce than t@xmath33 cell confirming a higher short circuit current density j@xmath69 for t@xmath18 compared to t@xmath33 as it was also found from i - v figure ( ) .",
    "it is also seen that the peak of ipce curve is shifted from @xmath99 to @xmath100 and the ipce spectrum is broadened over the @xmath98-@xmath2 nm wavelength region which are due to the more dye loading and light scattering in t@xmath18 photoanode .",
    "the eis measurements were carried out to investigate the electron recombination and the band structure in fabricated cells .",
    "the results of eis measurements were fitted using previously developedmodel . from this",
    "fitting the chemical capacitance c@xmath44 and recombination resistance r@xmath101 were found .",
    "the results for c@xmath44 and r@xmath101 are plotted versus voltage in .",
    "as seen in a , the porosity in tio@xmath0 photoanode has no considerable effect on the chemical capacitance c@xmath44 .",
    "since the slope of c@xmath44 reflects the tio@xmath0 density of states  @xcite , it can be concluded that the tio@xmath0 density of state distributions are identical for all the different porosity .",
    "also there is no shift in the chemical capacitance of various cells and consequently no displacement for the tio@xmath0 conduction band edge has occurred .    the recombination resistance can be used as a criterion for the recombination rate so that a larger rate indicates a lower resistance and vice versa .",
    "b shows that t@xmath18 and t@xmath16 cells have the maximum and minimum recombination resistance , respectively .",
    "this behaviour can justify the maximum and the minimum values of v@xmath73 that we found from i - v analysis , see table  [ table ] . considering that increase of recombination",
    "reduces v@xmath73 , a maximum and a minimum v@xmath73 is plausible for t@xmath18 and t@xmath16 cells . the seemingly disputed v@xmath73 result that we found for t@xmath33 and t@xmath16 samples",
    "can also be justified by taking into account the role of recombination .",
    "although the t@xmath16 sample in contrast to the t@xmath33 sample has a higher j@xmath69 and a higher dye loading but the increase in the recombination shown in b leads to a lower v@xmath73 for t@xmath16 compared to t@xmath33 .",
    "the recombination rate of t@xmath17 and t@xmath28 cells are almost the same as seen from b. this is compatible with the rather equal photovoltaic parameters , see table  [ table ] , that we find from i - v figure for t@xmath17 and t@xmath28 cells .",
    "the use of carbon nanospheres mixed with tio@xmath0 nanoparticles in dssc photoanode with a facile method demonstrated a higher photovoltaic performance compared to the tio@xmath0 without any carbon nanospheres . by removing the carbon nanospheres ,",
    "large and small cavities were created in the photoanode and enhanced the recombination resistance .",
    "the large cavities improved the light scattering and therefore an increase in the optical path was achieved .",
    "on the other hand the small cavities increase dye loading in the photoanode .",
    "these results are proven by drs , desorption of dyes , and eis measurements . as a consequence an enhancement of about @xmath6 for current density and about @xmath10 for the cell efficiency",
    "were obtained .",
