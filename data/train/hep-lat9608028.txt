    "the so - called ` naive ' lattice fermions give rise to sixteen species and the absence of the axial anomaly in this case is well understood in terms of cancellation of contributions from different species @xcite .",
    "the wilson fermions avoid species ` doubling ' by introducing generalized ( momentum - dependent ) mass terms through an irrelevant term that makes the doublers as heavy as the cutoff and the axial anomaly comes out correctly with the irrelevant wilson mass term playing the role of a pauli - villars regulator mass @xcite ; while a naive analysis gives fifteen times the ` conformal ' anomaly @xcite . apart from removing doublers , we will be concerned in the following with ward identities in the continuum limit and the role of the bare mass term and irrelevant terms in deriving the chiral anomaly .",
    "all earlier attempts with one - sided difference operators @xcite to remove doublers lacked hermiticity and as a result may have problems with reality properties in the continuum limit and also with numerical simulations .",
    "most importantly , the issue of chiral symmetry breaking and the chiral anomaly was not addressed .",
    "it is important for anomaly - related issues @xcite to keep intact , in the chiral limit , the chiral and hermiticity structure of the dirac operator , @xmath0 .",
    "accordingly , we propose to use , in weyl basis , for free fermions : @xmath1 @xmath2 @xmath3 and @xmath4 with @xmath5 the usual pauli matrices , @xmath6 .",
    "we shall see later the need to add , in the lattice - regularized theory , an explicit chiral symmetry breaking bare mass term .    for massive dirac fermions",
    ", the dirac operator follows from eq .",
    "( [ eq : osdf ] ) : @xmath7 @xmath8 @xmath9 @xmath10 produces an ( irrelevant ) term in the lattice action that formally goes to zero as @xmath11 .    in a vectorlike gauge theory , the fermionic part of the euclidean lattice action is then given by , @xmath12 \\nonumber   \\\\      & + & \\sum_{x,\\mu } \\frac{1}{2a}\\bar{\\psi}_x \\gamma_\\mu \\gamma_5      [ 2\\psi_x - u_{x\\mu}\\psi_{x+\\mu } \\nonumber \\\\       & - & u_{x-\\mu,\\mu}^\\dagger\\psi_{x-\\mu } ]       + m \\sum_x \\bar{\\psi}_x \\psi_x \\ , , \\label{eq : theory}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath13 and @xmath14 are fermion fields at @xmath15 and @xmath16 is the gauge field at the link @xmath17 .",
    "the action has full chiral symmetry for @xmath18 .",
    "the action ( [ eq : theory ] ) leads to the free fermion propagator @xmath19 given in momentum space by @xmath20 where @xmath21 and @xmath22 . to see that it is free from doublers ,",
    "consider @xmath23 note that a zero of @xmath24 for @xmath18 is necessarily a zero of @xmath25 .",
    "but the latter can vanish only when @xmath26 for all @xmath27 in the first brillouin zone .",
    "our propagator is essentially different from the previous cases @xcite where the @xmath28 in the irrelevant term is absent and the inverse propagator is expressible in the form @xmath29 or @xmath30 where @xmath31 is a trigonometric function of the momentum and there are at least some extra non - covariant excitations .",
    "the irrelevant term in our action , however , breaks hypercubic and reflection symmetries @xcite .",
    "reflection symmetry is a necessary condition for reflection positivity , one of the assumptions of the nielsen - ninomiya theorem in the euclidean theory .    as a remedy",
    "we propose to use instead the dirac operator @xmath32 with @xmath33 @xmath34 and correlation functions are to be evaluated only after averaging over @xmath35 . in weyl language , this prescrition resolves the ambiguity , whether to take the forward or the backward difference operator for a particular weyl component , by averaging correlations functions over such possibilities for each @xmath27-component of the difference operator while maintaining the ( anti)-correlation of the finite differences for @xmath36- and @xmath37-handed fermions and hence preserving the chiral and hermiticity structure ( [ eq : osdf ] ) .",
    "a similar averaging prescription has also been applied previously to recover covariance in case of point - split regularization @xcite .",
    "in actuality , in our case the @xmath35 averaging may not be needed after all in the continuum limit since only an irrelevant term is concerned .",
    "the locally derived ward identities for the theory ( [ eq : theory ] ) corresponding to the global u(1 ) vector and axial symmetries , found in the usual way , are @xmath38 @xmath39 @xmath40 @xmath41,\\ ] ] @xmath42.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath43 and @xmath44 are obtained respectively from @xmath45 and @xmath46 by replacing @xmath47 by @xmath48 in the above expressions .",
    "note that the naive continuum limit of the currents @xmath49 and @xmath50 give respectively the expected vector and axial vector currents in the continuum , while @xmath51 and @xmath44 go in the naive continuum limit to zero .",
    "we like to point out that the theory is fully defined by the action and the measure .",
    "the ward identities simply follow from them .",
    "there is an ambiguity for identifying the global currents and the only criterion is for them to assume the expected form in the continuum limit .",
    "this is true also for the usual treatment of global currents with wilson fermions .    in weak - coupling perturbation theory",
    ", we now calculate the @xmath52 and @xmath53 in the limit @xmath54 .",
    "we start from the operator representations : @xmath55 where @xmath56 with @xmath57 the full fermion propagator @xmath58 is given by @xmath59 @xmath60 in ( [ eq : y ] ) and ( [ eq : x ] ) ` @xmath61 ' stands for trace over @xmath62-matrices , and , in non - abelian gauge theory , also over the symmetry matrices .",
    "two factors play key role in the calculation of @xmath53 and @xmath52 : ( i ) terms odd in @xmath63 drop out because of @xmath35-averaging , and ( ii ) in the ` physical ' sector of the loop momentum @xmath64 is of @xmath65 whereas in the ` doubler ' sector @xmath66 it is of @xmath67 and behaves like the mass of a pauli - villars regulator field .",
    "one finally obtains @xmath68 so that the u(1 ) vector current is conserved : @xmath69 however , @xmath70 + @xmath71^{3}}\\ ] ] @xmath72 where @xmath73 and @xmath74 are the field tensor and its dual , ` _ tr _ ' stands for trace over symmetry matrices , and in the continuum limit @xmath75 .",
    "thus the model reproduces the anomalous ward identity : @xmath76 note that the subscript @xmath77 of @xmath78 has the meaning of the number of components of the loop momentum with support in the doubler sector @xmath79 . for finite ` @xmath80 '",
    "the contribution from @xmath81 vanishes in the continuum limit .",
    "if , however , @xmath80 is zero the latter would exactly cancel the anomaly . for a nonvanishing anomaly it is ,",
    "therefore , essential that the continuum limit is taken first and the chiral limit @xmath82 , if necessary , afterwards .    in eq .",
    "( [ eq : anwi ] ) , the first or explicit symmetry breaking term is of course a direct consequence of the nonzero mass and the second or anomalous term results essentially from the square of the irrelevant term of the action .",
    "however , the irrelevant term alone can not produce the anomaly unless @xmath83 .",
    "we have been able to achieve a doubler - free hermitian lattice fermion action producing the chiral anomaly in the continuum limit .",
    "barring a bare mass term which can only receive multiplicative renormalization , the action is chirally symmetric and therefore may be adaptable to chiral gauge theories .",
    "the presence of the mass term on the regulator is crucial to get the chiral anomaly .",
    "the chiral limit may only be taken once the cutoff is removed .",
    "there is growing evidence in helicity - flip interactions in qed and qcd @xcite also suggesting that the role of mass terms is more than just soft symmetry breaking . in wilson fermions too , the anomaly appears in a very similar way .",
    "our analysis indicates that breaking chiral symmetry only in the physical sector may be enough unlike in the wilson case where chiral symmetry is broken also by mass terms for the doublers",
