    "evolution is driven by genetic mutations .",
    "while some mutations affect an organism s ability to survive and reproduce , most are neutral and have no effect .",
    "neutral mutations play an important role in the study of evolution because they generally accrue at a consistent rate over time .",
    "this result , first discovered almost 50 years ago , allows neutral mutations to be used as a  molecular clock \" to estimate , for example , how long ago humans diverged from chimpanzees and bonobos .",
    "we used mathematical modeling to study how the rates of these molecular clocks are affected by the spatial arrangement of a population in its habitat .",
    "we find that asymmetry in this spatial structure can either slow down or speed up the rate at which neutral mutations accrue .",
    "this effect could potentially skew our estimates of past events from genetic data .",
    "it also has implications for a number of other fields .",
    "for example , we show that the architecture of intestinal tissue can limit the rate of genetic substitutions leading to cancer .",
    "we also show that the structure of social networks affects the rate at which new ideas replace old ones .",
    "surprisingly , we find that most twitter networks slow down the rate of idea replacement .",
    "a half - century ago , zuckerkandl and pauling @xcite discovered that amino acid substitutions often occur with sufficient regularity as to constitute a  molecular clock \" .",
    "theoretical support for this observation was provided by kimura @xcite , who argued that observed rates of amino acid substitution could only be explained if the majority of substitutions are selectively neutral . under simple models of evolution ,",
    "a neutral mutation has probability @xmath7 of becoming fixed in a haploid population of size @xmath8 .",
    "it follows that the rate @xmath0 of neutral substitution per generation  given by the product of the population size @xmath8 , the mutation probability @xmath1 per reproduction , and the fixation probability @xmath9is simply equal to @xmath1 .",
    "( a similar cancellation occurs in diploids , leading again to @xmath2 . ) in other words , for any neutral genetic marker , the rate of substitution at the population level equals the rate of mutation at the individual level @xcite .",
    "a number of factors can alter the rate of neutral substitution @xcite , including selection , changes in population demography over time , or mutation rates that vary systematically by demographic classes @xcite or sex @xcite .",
    "the extent to which these factors compromise the applicability of the molecular clock hypothesis to biological sequence data has been intensely debated @xcite .",
    "however , it is generally thought that spatial structure alone ( without spatial variation in the mutation rate@xcite ) can not alter the rate of neutral substitution .",
    "this consensus is based on analyses @xcite of a variety of models of spatially structured populations .",
    "each of these analyses found that the fixation probability of a neutral mutation is @xmath7 , and thus the rate of neutral substitution @xmath10 again simplifies to @xmath1 .",
    "here we show that the absence of spatial effects on the rate of neutral substitution in these models does not represent a general principle of evolution .",
    "rather , it is an artifact of two common modeling assumptions : ( i ) all spatial locations are equivalent under symmetry , and ( ii ) mutations are equally likely to arise in each location . while assumption ( i ) is relaxed in a number of models , assumption ( ii ) is made almost universally .",
    "either of these assumptions alone is sufficient to guarantee @xmath11 and @xmath2 , as we will show .",
    "however , neither of these assumptions is necessarily satisfied in a biological population . in particular , assumption ( ii ) is violated if some spatial locations experience more turnover ( births and deaths ) than others .",
    "since each birth provides an independent opportunity for mutation , the rate at which new mutations appear at a location is proportional to its turnover rate @xcite .",
    "thus , even with a constant probability of mutation per birth , mutations may appear with different frequency at different locations . if , in addition , fixation probability depends on a mutant s initial location , the rate of neutral substitution is altered .    our goal is to identify conditions under which the molecular clock rate is maintained ( @xmath2 ) , accelerated ( @xmath4 ) , or slowed ( @xmath12 ) by spatial population structure .",
    "our main results are as follows ( see also figure [ fig : venn ] ) :    . *",
    "relative to the rate in a well - mixed population ( @xmath2 ) , spatial structure can either accelerate ( @xmath4 ) or slow ( @xmath3 ) the accumulation of neutral substitutions , depending on how birth rates @xmath13 and death rates @xmath14 vary across sites .",
    "the rate is unchanged from that of a well - mixed population ( @xmath2 ) if either death rates are uniform across sites ( result 1 ) , or the birth and death rates are equal at each site ( result 2 ) .",
    "almost all previous studies of neutral drift in spatially structured populations fall into one of these two categories ; thus the effects of spatial structure on the molecular clock rate are unappreciated .",
    "we show that , in general , @xmath0 can take any non - negative value less than @xmath6 ( result 4 ) . if one adds the constraint that the birth rate is the same at each site , then the molecular clock rate can not exceed that of a well - mixed population ( @xmath5 ; result 3 ) . ]    * * result 1 * if the death rate is constant over sites , the molecular clock rate is identical to that of a well - mixed population : @xmath2 . * * result 2 * if the birth rate equals the death rate at each site , the molecular clock rate is identical to that of a well - mixed population : @xmath2 . *",
    "* result 3 * if the birth rate is constant over sites , the molecular clock rate is less than or equal to that of a well - mixed population : @xmath5 . *",
    "* result 4 * in general ( with no constraints on birth or death rates ) , the molecular clock rate @xmath0 can take any non - negative value less than @xmath6 .",
    "our investigations apply to a class of evolutionary models ( formally described in the materials and methods ) in which reproduction is asexual and the population size and spatial structure are fixed .",
    "specifically , there are a fixed number of sites , indexed @xmath15 . each site is always occupied by a single individual . at each time - step",
    ", a replacement event occurs , meaning that the occupants of some sites are replaced by the offspring of others .",
    "the replacement event is chosen according to a probability distribution  called the replacement rule  which depends on the model in question . since we consider only neutral mutations that have no phenotypic effect , the probabilities of replacement events are the same for every population state .",
    "this class includes many established evolutionary models .",
    "one important subclass is spatial moran processes @xcite , in which exactly one reproduction occurs each time - step .",
    "this class also includes spatial wright - fisher processes , in which the entire population is replaced each time - step @xcite . in general , any subset of individuals may be replaced by the offspring of any other subset in a given time - step .    for a given model in this class , we let @xmath16 denote the probability that the occupant of site @xmath17 is replaced by the offspring of site @xmath18 in a single time - step .",
    "thus the expected number of offspring of site @xmath18 over a single time - step is @xmath19 .",
    "the probability that node @xmath18 dies ( i.e. , is replaced ) in a time - step is @xmath20 .",
    "the death rate @xmath14 can also be regarded as the rate of turnover at site @xmath18 .",
    "the total expected number of offspring per time - step is denoted @xmath21 .",
    "we define a generation to be @xmath22 time - steps , so that , on average , each site is replaced once per generation .",
    "we use this framework to study the fate of a single neutral mutation , as it arises and either disappears or becomes fixed .",
    "the probability of fixation depends on the spatial structure and the initial mutant s location .",
    "we let @xmath23 denote the probability that a new mutation arising at site @xmath18 becomes fixed .",
    "( @xmath23 can also be understood as the reproductive value of site @xmath18 @xcite . )",
    "we show in the materials and methods that the fixation probabilities @xmath23 are the unique solution to the system of equations @xmath24 the identity @xmath25 arises because @xmath23 equals the probability that the current occupant of site @xmath18 will become the eventual ancestor of the population , which is true for exactly one of the @xmath8 sites .    to determine the overall rate of substitution , we must take into account the likelihood of mutations arising at each site .",
    "the rate at which mutations arise at site @xmath18 is proportional to the turnover rate @xmath14 , because each new offspring provides an independent chance of mutation .",
    "specifically , if mutation occurs at rate @xmath26 per reproduction , then new mutations arise at site @xmath18 at rate @xmath27 per generation @xcite .",
    "thus the fraction of mutations that arise at site @xmath18 is @xmath28 .",
    "the overall fixation probability @xmath9 of new mutations , taking into account all possible initial sites , is therefore @xmath29 the molecular clock rate @xmath0 is obtained by multiplying the fixation probability @xmath9 by the total rate of mutation per generation : @xmath30 the units of @xmath0 are substitutions per generation .",
    "alternatively , the molecular clock can be expressed in units of substitutions per time - step , in which case the fomula is @xmath31 .",
    "how does spatial structure affect the rate of neutral substitution ? in a well - mixed population , each individual s offspring is equally likely to replace each other individual , meaning that @xmath16 is constant over all @xmath18 and @xmath17 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : symmetric]a ) . in this case , the unique solution to eq .",

    "the spatial structure of a population affects its evolution in many ways , for example by promoting cooperative behaviors @xcite , genetic variation @xcite , and speciation @xcite .",
    "asymmetric spatial structure in particular is known to have important consequences for adaptation @xcite and for genetic diversity @xcite .",
    "our work shows that asymmetric spatial structure also affects the rate of neutral substitution .    in light of results 1 and 2",
    ", we see that the critical factors driving the changes in molecular clock rate are differential rates of turnover ( @xmath14 ) and net offspring production ( @xmath34 ) across sites .",
    "if both @xmath14 and @xmath35 differ across sites , the molecular clock rate will in general differ from that of a well - mixed population ( result 4 ) .",
    "if additionally @xmath13 is constant across sites , result 3 guarantees that neutral substitution is slowed relative to the well - mixed case .",
    "while our class of models includes a number of limiting assumptions ( e.g. , constant population size ) , our qualitative results do not appear to depend on these assumptions .",
    "we expect that differential rates of turnover and net offspring production will also alter molecular clock rates in models outside of the class considered here . however , the result that molecular clock rates can come abritrarily close to @xmath6which depends on the existence of a single  hub \" individual seeding the rest of the population as in figure [ fig : noconstraint]may require modification for sexually reproducing populations .",
    "conditions leading to altered molecular clock rate may occur frequently in natural populations .",
    "asymmetric dispersal may result , for example , from prevailing winds @xcite , water currents @xcite , or differences in elevation @xcite .",
    "differences in habitat quality may lead to variance in birth and death rates across sites ( nonuniform @xmath13 and @xmath14 ) .",
    "it is known that such asymmetries in spatial structure have important consequences for adaptation @xcite and for genetic diversity @xcite ; our work shows that they also have consequences for the rate of neutral genetic change .",
    "in particular , the molecular clock is accelerated if there is greater turnover in  upstream \" subpopulations .",
    "many somatic cell populations have strongly asymmetric patterns of replacement , with small stem cell pools feeding much larger populations of progenitor and differentiated cells .",
    "our results support the idea that infrequent turnover of stem cells suppresses the accumulation of somatic mutations @xcite",
    ". the rate at which these mutations accumulate has significant implications for the onset of cancer @xcite and the likelihood of successful cancer therapy @xcite .",
    "it is important to note , however , that cancer can alter the structure of cell hierarchies ; for example , by altering the number and replacement rate of stem cells @xcite and/or allowing differentiated cells to revert to stem cells @xcite .",
    "this restructuring may , in turn , alter the rate of genetic substitution .",
    "the influence of social network topology on the spread of ideas and behaviors is a question of both theoretical and practical interest @xcite .",
    "the neutral substition rate @xmath0 on social networks describes how innovations spread when they are equally likely to be imitated as an existing convention .",
    "since it depends only on network topology , @xmath36 can be used as a statistic to isolate how this topology affects the rate of social change .",
    "our finding that most twitter ego networks have rates less than those of well - mixed populations contrasts with results from epidemiological models , which generally find that the heterogeneity of real - world social networks accelerates contagion @xcite .",
    "further research is needed to determine which kinds of real - world networks accelerate neutral substitution , and how neutral substitution rates relate to other measures of diffusion and contagion on networks .",
    "if spatial structure remains constant over time , then the neutral substitution rate @xmath0 is in all cases a constant multiple of the mutation rate @xmath1 . in this case , absent other complicating factors such as selection , neutral mutations will accrue at a constant rate that can be inferred from genetic data . however , if the spatial sturcture changes over time  due , for instance , to changes in climate , tumorogenesis , or social network dynamics @xcite  the rate of neutral substitutions may change over time as well .    in our framework ,",
    "the molecular clock rate is assumed to depend only on the rate at which mutations arise and their probability of becoming fixed .",
    "this approach assumes that the time to fixation is typically shorter than the expected waiting time @xmath37 for the next successful mutation .",
    "if this is not the case , then substitution rates are also affected by fixation times .",
    "these fixation times are themselves affected by spatial structure @xcite , leading to further ramifications for the molecular clock rate @xcite .",
    "the starting point of our analysis is that the convention , commonly assumed in evolutionary models , that mutations arise with equal frequency at each site , is not necessarily the most natural choice .",
    "if there is a constant probability of mutation per birth , then mutations instead arise in proportion to the rate of turnover at a site . here",
    "we have applied this principle to study the rate of neutral substitution . however",
    ", this principle also holds for advantageous and deleterious mutations , as well as those whose effect varies with location .",
    "it also applies to frequency - dependent selection @xcite .",
    "re - analyzing existing models using this new mutation convention may reveal further surprises about how spatial structure affects evolution .",
    "in the class of models we consider , there are @xmath8 sites indexed @xmath15 , each always occupied by a single individual . at each time - step , a replacement event occurs , in which the occupants of some positions are replaced by the offspring of others .",

    "we call this probability distribution the replacement rule of the model",
    ". the probability of a replacement event @xmath38 in this distribution will be denoted @xmath45 .",
    "neutrality is represented by independence of the probabilities @xmath45 from the state of the evolutionary process .",
