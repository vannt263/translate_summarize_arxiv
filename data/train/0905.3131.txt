    "<S> standard cosmology poses a number of important questions . apart from its singular origin </S>",
    "<S> , it possesses early and late accelerating phases required to account for observations . </S>",
    "<S> the vacuum energy has been considered as a possible way to resolve some of these questions . </S>",
    "<S> the vacuum energy density induced by free fields in an early de sitter phase has earlier been estimated to be proportional to @xmath0 , while more recently it has been suggested that the qcd condensate induces a term proportional to @xmath1 at late times . </S>",
    "<S> these results have been employed in models which are non - singular and inflationary at early times and accelerating at late times . </S>",
    "<S> here we cast these models in terms of scalar fields and study the corresponding spectrum of primordial perturbations . at early times </S>",
    "<S> the spectrum is found to be not scale - invariant , thus implying that slow - roll inflation is still required after the phase transition induced by the vacuum . at late times </S>",
    "<S> the corresponding scalar - field potential is harmonic , with a mass of the order of the hubble scale , a result that may be understood in the light of the holographic conjecture .    </S>",
    "<S> recent years have witnessed a tremendous accumulation of high resolution data in cosmology . </S>",
    "<S> this has led to the so called standard model , which poses a number of important questions . </S>",
    "<S> apart from having a singular origin , at which laws of physics break down , it also possesses accelerating phases at early and late times . </S>",
    "<S> this has resulted in numerous attempts at generalising the gravitational and energy sectors of gr in order to account for these features . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly all viable models have proved to be very close to the @xmath2cdm .    </S>",
    "<S> an important ingredient expected from quantum considerations is the vacuum energy , which has often been thought to be responsible for the origin of the cosmological parameter @xmath2 . as is well known , it is not easy to obtain the vacuum density in curved spacetimes , even in the simple case of a scalar field @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> an exception is the case of fields with conformal invariance in de sitter spacetime @xcite , for which the renormalized vacuum density has been found to be proportional to @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the hubble parameter . in a general flrw background , </S>",
    "<S> some ambiguities can be fixed by imposing the conservation of the vacuum energy - momentum tensor @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this allows a general expression for the vacuum density to be derived , which was in fact originally used by starobinsky in his pioneering inflationary model @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> recently the de sitter ansatz @xmath3 was employed in a quasi - de sitter setting in order to construct a non - singular scenario , with a phase transition between a past - eternal de sitter phase and a radiation - dominated epoch @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> an underlying assumption was that a dynamical vacuum interacts with matter , since only the conservation of the total energy - momentum tensor is implied by einstein equations . </S>",
    "<S> thus in this model the decaying vacuum acts as a source of relativistic matter during the expansion .    on the other hand </S>",
    "<S> , it has been suggested that the qcd condensate induces a vacuum density proportional to @xmath1 at late times @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this has also been employed to construct models to account for the late acceleration of the universe .    in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we formulate these ansatz in terms of self - interacting scalar fields in a spatially flat flrw spacetime . in this framework </S>",
    "<S> the lagrangian takes the usual form @xmath4,\\ ] ] with the corresponding field equations given by @xmath5 here the prime and the dot denote derivatives with respect to @xmath6 and the cosmological time @xmath7 , respectively .    </S>",
    "<S> we begin with the early phase and consider a potential proportional to @xmath0 , which has a maximum in the asymptotic de sitter limit . </S>",
    "<S> the energy density and pressure of this field are given by @xmath8 and @xmath9 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , we can interpret the material content as formed by a vacuum term with density @xmath10 and pressure @xmath11 , plus a stiff fluid with density and pressure given by @xmath12 . as the transition from the de sitter phase takes place , with the field rolling down the potential , the energy stored in the vacuum term </S>",
    "<S> is transferred to the stiff component , and eventually converted into matter fields by a suitable coupling , as in the usual reheating mechanism .    ) as a function of @xmath6 ( @xmath13).,width=377,height=226 ]    with the ansatz @xmath14 where @xmath15 is a positive constant , it is straightforward , using eqs . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ field equation 1])-([field equation 2 ] ) , to find the solution @xmath16 the corresponding potential , with @xmath17 , is shown in figure 1 .    also , using @xmath18 in eqs . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ field equation 1])-([field equation 2 ] ) , we obtain an evolution equation for @xmath1 , @xmath19 this equation has the equilibrium point @xmath20 , which corresponds to a de sitter universe with energy scale @xmath21 in planck units . </S>",
    "<S> this solution is , however , unstable , as indicated by the solution @xmath22 where we have introduced the re - scaled quantities @xmath23 and @xmath24 , and have conveniently chosen the integration constant .    ) </S>",
    "<S> .,width=377,height=226 ]    the time evolution of @xmath25 is depicted in figure 2 . as @xmath26 the solution approaches the de sitter point , with @xmath20 , as expected . </S>",
    "<S> the solution remains quasi - de sitter during an indefinitely long time . </S>",
    "<S> then , around @xmath27 , it goes through a phase transition , with @xmath1 and @xmath10 decaying very fast . </S>",
    "<S> it is worth noting that for @xmath28 we have @xmath29 during the entire evolution , thus we never enter a trans - planckian regime , where the semi - classical , one - loop derivation of the vacuum density would not be valid .    </S>",
    "<S> this model has a number of appealing features . </S>",
    "<S> in addition to being non - singular , the presence of a quasi - de sitter phase solves some of the problems usually addressed by inflation , such as the horizon and flatness problems . </S>",
    "<S> however , the most important outcome of an inflationary phase is to produce a scale invariant spectrum of primordial perturbations . to be viable as an inflationary scenario , </S>",
    "<S> it is therefore important to check whether the above model can also produce such a scale - invariant spectrum .    </S>",
    "<S> the evolution equation for perturbations in the scalar field is given by @xcite @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the scale factor , @xmath32 is the co - moving wave number of a given mode , and * denotes a derivative with respect to the conformal time @xmath33 .    from ( [ ansatz ] ) , ( [ early hubble ] ) and ( [ field equation 2 ] ) </S>",
    "<S> it is possible to obtain @xmath34 with @xmath35 . in the quasi - de sitter phase we have @xmath36 and , </S>",
    "<S> hence , @xmath37 and @xmath38 . by using @xmath39 and introducing @xmath40 , the perturbation eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ perturbations ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath41 neglecting the term in @xmath42 , the appropriately normalized solution has the form @xmath43,\\ ] ] where @xmath44 is the hankel function of the first kind . for @xmath45 , </S>",
    "<S> this solution reduces to @xmath46 , as expected . </S>",
    "<S> on the other hand , for @xmath47 , when the mode crosses the horizon , we have @xmath48 .    </S>",
    "<S> the power spectrum of scalar perturbations in the metric is given by @xcite @xmath49 using ( [ delta phi ] ) and @xmath50 , we have @xmath51 with the right hand side evaluated at the horizon crossing . </S>",
    "<S> apart from the factor of @xmath52 , this is the same expression we find in slow - roll inflation . </S>",
    "<S> the power spectrum of tensor modes is the same , and hence the extra factor of @xmath52 leads to a stronger suppression of primordial gravitational waves . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , @xmath42 here has a strong dependence on @xmath32 , which makes the spectrum scale - dependent . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , from ( [ epsilon ] ) it is possible to show that , for @xmath36 , @xmath53 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , at the horizon crossing we have @xmath54 , leading to a scalar spectral index @xmath55 . </S>",
    "<S> this result follows from the fact that we do not have a slow - roll potential , since from ( [ ansatz ] ) and ( [ potential ] ) we have , for @xmath36 , @xmath56 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , this scenario can not by itself produce a scale - invariant spectrum . to achieve this , </S>",
    "<S> the phase transition described here must be followed by a usual inflationary epoch .    </S>",
    "<S> let us now discuss the potential role of the vacuum energy at late times . </S>",
    "<S> the free - field vacuum density , of order @xmath0 , is presently too small to be identified with the dark energy . on the other hand </S>",
    "<S> , any contribution proportional to @xmath57 may be absorbed by the gravitational constant in einstein equations @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it is usually believed that , apart from terms in @xmath57 and @xmath0 , the only remaining contribution is a free constant , which may be absorbed by a cosmological constant . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , it has recently been claimed that the introduction of interactions may change this picture @xcite . in particular </S>",
    "<S> , the qcd condensate leads to a vacuum density of order @xmath58 , where @xmath59 mev is the energy scale of the qcd phase transition also appears in models with a modified friedmann equation , in the context of high - dimensional theories . </S>",
    "<S> see , for example , reference @xcite . ] . </S>",
    "<S> although not conclusive , this result gives the correct order of magnitude for the cosmological term , @xmath60 , and , as a byproduct , the dirac large number coincidence @xmath61 .    at present it </S>",
    "<S> is not known whether this linear relation is valid only in the de sitter limit or can also hold in the dynamical regime near this limit . assuming the latter , again in order to ensure the conservation of total energy , matter production would be required . </S>",
    "<S> this scenario was studied recently , by confronting its predictions with the current observations . a joint analysis of sne ia , baryonic acoustic oscillations and the position of the first peak of cmb anisotropy spectrum produced a good concordance @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , the production of dark matter leads to a power suppression in the mass spectrum , which seems to rule out this scenario @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this difficulty may be overcome if we avoid matter production by associating the varying @xmath2 with a quintessence field , as was done in the early - time limit above </S>",
    "<S> . a full study , which also includes matter , is in progress . </S>",
    "<S> here we shall consider the simpler case where only the quintessence field is present , which is reasonable very near the de sitter limit .    with the ansatz @xmath62 , where now @xmath63 , eqs .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ field equation 1])-([field equation 2 ] ) have the solution @xmath64 @xmath65 as can be seen , as @xmath66 , @xmath67 as expected .    </S>",
    "<S> the potential possesses a minimum at @xmath68 , corresponding to the de sitter limit . around this point </S>",
    "<S> the potential can be expanded as @xmath69 where @xmath70 and @xmath71 . </S>",
    "<S> the mass term is worthy of note . in the de sitter limit </S>",
    "<S> we have @xmath72 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the mass of the quintessence field is given by @xmath73 this is the mass expected for elementary degrees of freedom in the context of the holographic conjecture @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , recalling the observable mass in the universe , @xmath74 , and the entropy associated with the de sitter horizon , @xmath75 , we obtain @xmath76 for the mass of each degree of freedom .    in conclusion </S>",
    "<S> , we note that the vacuum energy , usually considered a problem in quantum field theories and cosmology , may actually shed new light on other fundamental problems , such as the initial singularity and the nature of dark energy . at early times </S>",
    "<S> the free - field contribution to the vacuum density , proportional to @xmath0 , leads to a non - singular scenario , which in this paper was modeled by a self - interacting scalar field , with the potential playing the role of the vacuum term . in this context , it was possible to show that the primordial transition from the quasi - de sitter phase does not produce a scale - invariant spectrum of perturbations , for which a subsequent , usual inflationary epoch is required . on the other hand , at late times we have associated the vacuum term with a quintessence field with potential linear in @xmath1 , as suggested by qcd results in the de sitter space - time . </S>",
    "<S> the presence of such a field allows the conservation of the total energy without invoking matter production . near the future de sitter limit </S>",
    "<S> , the quintessence potential is shown to be harmonic , with a mass term in agreement with the holographic prescription . </S>"
