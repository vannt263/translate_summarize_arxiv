    "brane worlds theories on domain walls had achieved successful development in recent years , specially after the important results by randall and sundrum explaining the hierarchy problem in a model with two branes in an ads orbifold @xcite , and the confinement of spin 2 massless gravity with the classical newtonian limit @xcite in one brane model .",
    "most of the development on brane world theory as confinement of chiral fermions , localization of gauge fields , bps solutions , wide and thin domain walls limits etc . had been achieved on 5 dimensional domain walls referencesdw .",
    "domain walls are not free of problems , the lost of energy by radiation , the stability under casimir energy and/or quantum fluctuation , the localization of gauge field , the supersymmetric extension and its relation with inflation and are still unsolved problems currently under research @xcite .",
    "brane worlds also had been proposed on 6 dimensional string - vortices rsvortex and higher dimensional topological defects @xcitebezerra@xcite .",
    "it is natural to expect better phenomenological behavior with more extra non compact dimensions , in the same way that smaller observable size is obtained for larger number of dimensions in aadd models @xcite or greater warping volume factor arises with a greater number of warped dimensions in rs models @xcite@xcite . besides domain walls , vortices are the simplest topological defect . the string - vortex defects are topological charged solutions to the equations of the abelian - higgs model , with non trivial first homotopy group for the vacuum manifold ,  i.e. there exist strings solutions ( or holes in 2 dimensions ) around which any loop will have non trivial winding number .",
    "some important advances as localization of massless gravitons @xciteshaposhnikov , confinement of fermions @xcite , decoupling of graviphotons and graviscalar @xcite and confinement of electromagnetic spin 1 gauge fields @xcite@xcite had been recently achieved for gravitational string - vortex in 6d .",
    "almost all the works relays on numerical @xcite@xcitegiovannini2 or asymptotical approximations @xciteshaposhnikov@xcite@xcite , because there are not known general analytic solutions for curved 6d string - vortices in curved space time , nevertheless rs scenarios based on asymptotical ( and numerical ) solutions had been reported @xcite@xcite@xcite . in order to proceed to future developments as quantization and stability under fluctuations studies",
    "it is important to obtain exact solutions .",
    "so the principal purpose of this paper , is to show new exact solutions to string - vortices on which a rs scenario could be constructed and gravitation localized .    in section",
    "ii we obtain the exact solution of the einstein equations in 6 dimensions for 3 new symmetry breaking potentials : two of which are non polynomial , and one resembles the classical quartic mexican hat . in section iii",
    "we give two different proofs of the localization of the zero massless mode for linearized gravity fluctuations and also prove that massive modes are not bounded to the vortex .",
