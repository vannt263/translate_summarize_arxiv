    "the sun is a benchmark in stellar astrophysics research and establishing a sample of solar analog stars is important to map its past , present and future .",
    "about 50 yr ago , olin wilson and collaborators discovered sun - like activity cycles in a group of @xmath0 stars , now known as the mt.wilson sample ( @xcite ) . additional work over the intervening decades ( e.g. , @xcite ) has made us confident that some of these stars do indeed have ages comparable to that of the sun and that their activity , and chemical and other fundamental properties make them , in many ways , `` solar analogs '' .",
    "many additional studies have allowed the identification of some other stars as solar analogs and some of these have properties that are close enough to those of the sun that they are even called `` solar twins '' .",
    "solar twins are spectroscopically indistinguishable from the sun @xcite for example , 18  sco ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , corot sol 1 @xcite , and hip  102152 ( @xcite ) .",
    "the term  solar analogs \" here refers to stars with 0.9 @xmath1 @xmath2/@xmath3  @xmath4  1.1 and ",
    "solar twin candidates \" refers to stars with 0.95 @xmath1 @xmath2/@xmath3  @xmath4  1.05 and rotation periods of @xmath5 @xmath6 14 days .",
    "solar twins also allow us to decide to what extent the sun itself can be considered a `` typical '' 1.0  @xmath3   star @xcite .",
    "the search for solar twins has been greatly expanded since 1997 @xcite , when only one solar twin was known , and currently more than two dozen twins have been identified ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "solar twins are also important to calibrate fundamental ubv(ri)@xmath7  @xmath8  relations @xcite and to test non - standard stellar models .",
    "a sample of solar twins with determined @xmath5 is also important to study the `` sun in time '' ( see @xcite ) .",
    "a related consideration is how the sun has changed over time , and how its behavior relates to that of other younger and older stars of solar mass .",
    "studying this requires that we assemble a sample of stars whose ages we know well enough to place them all in a time sequence that includes the sun .",
    "however , ages for field stars , particularly for those on the main sequence , are notoriously difficult to derive ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite )",
    ". consequently , the classical distinction between solar - type and analogs or twins does not include age constraints apart from the obvious dwarf / giant distinction .",
    "the various requirements make finding solar analogs and twins difficult . a good way to find such valuable stars",
    "is to take advantage of space missions such as _ corot _ @xcite and nasa s _ kepler _ mission @xcite .",
    "these missions have provided precise observations for thousands of main - sequence stars .",
    "furthermore , we can detect periodic stellar variability for these stars .",
    "such modulation is a signature of the presence of spots on the star s surface and can be used to measure the stellar @xmath5 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . from @xmath5",
    ", ages can be estimated using gyrochronology @xcite .",
    "although recent works have increased the number of solar twins and studied their physical parameters and chemical abundances in detail , their @xmath5 are mostly unknown , except for the two solar twins 18 sco @xcite and corot sol 1 @xcite .",
    "our sample of 75 stars consists of a _ seismic sample _ of 38 from @xcite , 35 additional stars selected from the _ kepler _ input catalog ( kic ) , and 16  cyg  a and b. we selected 38 well - studied stars from the asteroseismic data with fundamental properties , including ages , estimated by @xcite , and with @xmath8  and @xmath9 as close as possible to the sun s value ( 5200  k @xmath1 @xmath8@xmath1 6060  k and 3.63 @xmath1 @xmath9 @xmath1 4.40 ) .",
    "this seismic sample allows a direct comparison between gyro and seismic ",
    "ages for a subset of eight stars .",
    "these _ seismic sample _ were observed in short cadence for one month each in survey mode .",
    "stellar properties for these stars have been estimated using two global asteroseismic parameters and complementary photometric and spectroscopic observations as described by @xcite .",
    "the median final quoted uncertainties for the full @xcite sample were approximately 0.020 dex in @xmath9 and 150 k in @xmath8 .",
    "the 35 selected stars from the improved version of the kic ( @xcite , @xcite ) present stellar parameters @xmath8  and @xmath9 in the range @xmath10  k @xmath4 @xmath8   @xmath11  k and @xmath12 .",
    "the median final quoted uncertainties were approximately [ + 0.070 , -0.280 ] dex in @xmath9 and 160 k in @xmath8 .",
    "we derived isochrone ages for these stars .",
    "we also included the well  studied solar analogs 16  cyg  a and b ( kic  12069424 and 12069449 ; v@xmath136 ) , with estimated ages of @xmath14  gyr for both stars .",
    "so far , for 16  cyg  a & b , there have been no direct measurements of surface rotation .",
    "the age implies that @xmath5 should be near 30 days ( @xcite , @xcite ) for both components .",
    "table  [ tbl : obs ] summarizes the properties of our targets . the sample is displayed in figure  [ evoldig_f1 ] .",
    "we used models computed with the toulouse - geneva stellar evolution code ( @xcite , @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "these models used an initial composition with the @xcite mixture .",
    "rotation - induced mixing and the transport of angular momentum due to rotationally induced instabilities are computed as described by @xcite , and these models take into account internal differential rotation .",
    "the angular momentum evolution follows the @xcite prescription .",

    "models are shown with a dashed black line that indicates the evolutionary point where the subgiant branch starts and which corresponds to hydrogen exhaustion in the stellar core ( i.e. , turnoff point ) .",
    "the 30 stars above this line are subgiants .",
    "the remaining 45 stars below this line are dwarfs and of primary interest here . from these , eight are dwarfs with ages known from asteroseismology .",
    "finally , we determine the individual masses of our sample of dwarf stars by using the evolutionary tracks for the respective metallicities . from this ,",
    "most of the mass determination uncertainty is due to the uncertainties on @xmath8  ( @xmath13150k ) which lead to an error of @xmath130.05 @xmath3 .",
    "our determined values agree with those of @xcite . for dwarfs ,",
    "the mass determination is negligibly affected by the choice of standard or non - standard models , and the uncertainties are smaller than intrinsic errors in the @xmath16 and @xmath8 .",
    "the mass determination uncertainties become significant for subgiants .",
    "the average surface @xmath5 is obtained from light curve modulation analysis . to extract the @xmath5",
    ", we analyze pdc - map and simple aperture photometry light curves @xcite that are corrected for outliers , drifts , and discontinuities and stitched together following the procedures described by @xcite .",
    "the light curves are then high - pass filtered using a triangular smooth function with a cut - off that can change from 40 to 100 days .",
    "we remind readers that the pdc - msmap @xcite corrected data proposed by _",
    "kepler _ can not be used here , because some quarters are filtered with a 20 day high - pass filter ( @xcite ) .        from a lomb ",
    "scargle periodogram @xcite , we searched for the highest peaks below 11.57 @xmath17hz with one daily alias . to ensure that the retrieved peaks are due to stellar signals , we verified that the signal responsible for the @xmath5 is present during most of the observed window .",
    "then , we visually examined the results and any period detected was considered robust if repeated features were visible in different parts of the light curve . finally , we computed the autocorrelation of the signal ( @xcite ) in order to cross - check the results .",
    "we fit a gaussian function to the global wavelet spectrum @xcite , i.e. , the projection into the frequency domain of the time frequency analysis and the uncertainty was obtained from the full width at half - maximum of the gaussian profile .",
    "this uncertainty includes the @xmath5 variation due to differential rotation .",
    "our entire sample is composed of 75 stars , and their derived periods and errors are presented in table  1 .",
    "in order to better interpret @xmath5 , it is important to get an idea of how reliable the fundamental parameters @xcite are .",
    "we compared the kic parameters with those determined by @xcite and with revised @xcite values for all of the stars of the seismic sample and solar analogs and twin candidates , see figure  [ evoldig_f1 ] ( right ) .",
    "the @xmath8  from the kic is systematically lower when compared to values based on the asteroseismic analysis ( figure  [ evoldig_f1 ] , bottom right panel ) .",
    "@xcite incorporated priors results in the distributions of the parameters at fixed temperature and used colors ( e.g. , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 ) with little sensitivity to [ fe / h ] to arrive at more realistic distributions around 0.01 dex in @xmath9 .",
    "we adopted the @xcite values .",
    "we have measured the `` flicker '' as defined by @xcite and validated by @xcite , as a proxy of the granulation properties that scale with the stellar @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "since we analyzed 1440 days of data , we slightly modify the method by dividing the time series into _ kepler _ quarters ( where q1 is a month long and the following quarters are each three months ) and we computed the standard deviation of each sub - series smoothed over an eight hour boxcar ( the same results were obtained using a six hour function ) .",
    "we then corrected the values for the photon noise @xcite .",
    "we applied this procedure to our entire sample . in figure",
    "[ figure_flicker ] , we display @xmath9 as a function of the eight hour flicker f@xmath21 which we measured . for the filled symbols ( dwarfs and subgiants ) , we can clearly see the correlation as shown by @xcite .",
    "the red star represents the sun s @xmath9 , fixed at @xmath22 4.44 , and flicker f@xmath21 @xcite .",
    "we can distinguish two stars ( filled triangle ) , namely kic  2718678 ( @xmath23  11.49 ) and kic  12157617 ( @xmath23  11.89 ) , located close to the position of the sun .",
    "based on @xcite , this plot suggests that these two stars are more likely to be very similar to the sun from their activity level , as measured by the eight hour flicker f@xmath21 .",
    "a second group of stars has similar values of @xmath9 and with a wide range of flicker f@xmath21 .",
    "these stars are represented by open circles belonging to the large - flicker horizontal line shift away from the dashed line .",
    "those might be stars with an activity level at the mid - point of their cycle that is larger than the sun s at solar maximum .",
    "they might be stars younger than the sun or stars expected to have a higher noise ( true for faint magnitudes , @xmath24 ) .",
    "we do not expect to find a solar twin when we horizontally move that far from the dashed line .",
    "( f. bastien 2014 , private communication ) .",
    "our flicker diagram should be encompass solar dwarfs at different age - points and different activity levels .",
    "two stars from this sample are confirmed to be quite similar to 18  sco by @xcite , based on hds@subaru observations .",
    "the rotation rates of these stars permit a deeper understanding of this sample . in figure  [ evoldig_f1 ]",
    "we show the evolution of the averaged rotation period @xmath25 for dwarfs and subgiants .",
    "the @xmath25 increases ( 21@xmath2626@xmath2632@xmath2649@xmath27 ) as stars evolve up the giant branch .",
    "this figure shows the broad trend , constrained by sample size , of the @xmath5 of the subgiants .",
    "however , our real interest , as far as solar analogs and twins are concerned , is in understanding the dwarfs .",
    "the @xmath25 for dwarfs is slightly lower than the solar rotation period .",
    "the @xmath5 that we have measured from the _ kepler _ light curves , together with some solar proxies , permit an independent ( from classical isochrone or seismic ages ) age derivation for the dwarfs using gyrochronology ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the basic idea displayed in figure  [ prot_bv ] is that the , @xmath5 of cool stars are a function of the star s age and mass , allowing the age to be determined if the other two variables are known . in this work ,",
    "we bypass the uncertainties in the color determination by working directly with @xmath8 , converting it to the global convective turnover times @xmath28 using the table  1 in @xcite , and then calculating the age using equation ( 32 ) provided in @xcite . for @xmath29",
    ", we used a value of 1.1days , as suggested in @xcite .",
    "remember that , in principle , gyrochronology only provides good results for main  sequence stars with masses less than about 1.2 @xmath30 .",
    "these gyro - ages for dwarfs are listed in table  1 , along with the uncertainties originating in the @xmath8   and @xmath5 uncertainties .",
    "the inset in figure  [ prot_bv ] displays a comparison between the seismic- and gyro ",
    "ages on a star - by - star basis .",
    "the two ages are in agreement within the errors , with a correlation coefficient of @xmath31 = 0.79 with a significance level of @xmath32 = 0.019 .",
    "the dwarf ages range from under 1gyr to  10gyr , with a median of roughly 3.9gyr , implying that this sample indeed consists of stars that are comparable in age to the sun . for 35 dwarf stars from the kic",
    ", we computed isochrone ages from the model described in section .",
    "[ s_models ] ( figure  [ evoldig_f1 ] ) and gyro - ages ( @xcite ; @xcite )",
    ". figure  [ prot_age ] is consistent with the theoretical predictions of .",
    "as we expected , the isochrone ages are subject to huge systematic errors , reflected in the scattered open circles in figure  [ prot_age ] , coupled with the fact that stellar rotation has a strong dependence on mass .",
    "as a function of stellar age .",
    "filled circles represent the seismic sample dwarfs .",
    "open circles represent solar twin candidates .",
    "the shaded region represents the gyro relations ( @xcite ) with @xmath33 for the sun , with @xmath34 .",
    "diamonds indicate 16  cyg  a and b.,width=321,height=321 ]    we report rotation periods for 30 subgiants and 43 dwarfs , where 34 are main - sequence stars with @xmath35 . for dwarfs , we determine individual masses and ages .",
    "this resulted in the identification of a new sample of at least 22 new solar twin candidates .",
    "eight of these dwarfs stars ( seismic sample ) have asteroseismic ages determined by @xcite and allow a direct comparison between gyro and seismic - ages .",
    "the comparison shows reasonable agreement , mostly within 20@xmath36 and with a correlation coefficient @xmath31 = 0.79 .",
    "@xmath5 for these samples , permit a general elucidation of how the @xmath25 increase as solar analogs evolve during the main - sequence and subgiant phases .",
    "the sample of dwarfs contains stars with @xmath5 as slow as 27 days , however , the @xmath5 histogram distribution for our 43 main - sequence stars indicates a peak in 19 days , making these stars slightly younger than the sun .",
    "this agree with @xcite , who reported that the sun is within 1@xmath37 standard deviation of stars of its mass and age .",
    "the flicker of these stars is also measured and provides a new additional parameter in the search for solar twins based on its activity .",
