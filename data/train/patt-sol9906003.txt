    "solitary waves ( solitons ) can appear when an initial excitation applied to a medium is strong enough to cause nonlinear response .",

    "situations @xcite .",
    "the problems of soliton stability and instability induced dynamics in nonintegrable hamiltonian models have paramount importance for understanding of a wide range of physical phenomena covering such fields as propagation of electromagnetic , water and plasma waves , condensed matter physics and classical field theory @xcite .",
    "several analytical approaches to the stability problem are known .",

    "asymptotic stability theory @xcite , method of adiabatically varying soliton parameters @xcite , lyapunov @xcite and evans @xcite methods .",
    "generally , stability of a solitary wave in a hamiltonian model can be lost due to bifurcations involving appearance of a positive eigenvalue ( _ stationary _ instability ) in the soliton spectrum or a pair of complex conjugate eigenvalues with positive real parts ( _ oscillatory _ instability ) @xcite . both types of these instabilities have been extensively studied in the different solitonic contexts proving their ubiquitousness and fundamental importance , see refs . @xcite and refs .",
    "@xcite , respectively , for the stationary and oscillatory instabilities . in the most of the",
    "known cases the loss of stability is associated with the collisions of the purely imaginary eigenvalues corresponding to the so called internal modes @xcite of the soliton spectrum ( see @xcite for interesting exceptions ) .",
    "applying the above mentioned methods it was shown that in many cases a threshold of stationary instability of multi - parameter solitons is given by the zero of the determinant of the jacobi matrix @xmath1 , where @xmath2 are the soliton parameters and @xmath3 are the associated motion integrals @xcite .",
    "the condition @xmath4 is , in fact , the compatibility condition of the problem arising in the leading ( zero ) order of the asymptotic solution of the eigenvalue problem governing stability of the soliton @xcite . to find expressions for the eigenvalues",
    "it is necessary to proceed further and solve problems arising in higher ( at least first ) orders . up to now",
    "this was done only for the specific class of model equations having single parameter soliton families @xcite . for stationary bifurcations of two - parameter solitons adiabatic method has been applied in refs .",
    "linear approximation of this method actually gives an expression for eigenvalues , for more details see section iv .",
    "however , all known developments of this method fail to give criterion indicating transition to the oscillatory instability , i.e. instability with complex eigenvalues .",
    "it is also difficult to extend this method beyond its first order because of the rather involved calculations .    _",
    "the purpose of this work is to formulate a general asymptotic approach to stability of multi - parameter solitons in hamiltonian models , to show how it can be used to find expressions for the instability growth rates with arbitrary accuracy and to formulate criterion for the oscillatory instability of solitons . _",

    "the neutral modes can be generated by infinitesimal variations of the free parameters of the soliton and thus always be presented as explicit functions of the soliton solution . at the same time continuum eigenmodes",

    "this is an important fact which makes the asymptotic expansion near the neutral modes by the very practical tool of the stability theory .",

    "namely , it describes only eigenvalues @xmath49 corresponding to a specific class of the perturbations which in the zero approximation can be expressed as a linear superposition of the neutral eigenmodes .",
    "thus , generally speaking , on the basis of this approach one can get only _ sufficient _ conditions for soliton instability or , in other words , _ necessary _ conditions for soliton stability",

    "it indicates that each of the zero eigenvalues corresponding to the neutral modes @xmath75 is doubly degenerate one .",
    "this degeneracy originates from the presence of the associated vectors @xmath76 .    to write the explicit expressions for @xmath73 it will be convenient to introduce vectors @xmath77 , where , @xmath78 now each @xmath73 can be presented as @xmath79 where @xmath80 is the determinant of the @xmath81 matrix consisting of the rows @xmath82 and the sum is taken over all such combinations of @xmath83 that @xmath84 .",
    "@xmath85 can be readily expressed via derivatives of the conserved quantities with respect to the soliton parameters : @xmath86 and practical calculation of @xmath87 for @xmath88 can be simplified : @xmath89 note , that in most of the cases solitary solution itself can be found only numerically using any of the well established methods for solving the nonlinear ode s .",
    "recurrent calculations of @xmath90 can be readily reduced to the numerically even simpler problem of solving of the linear inhomogeneous ode s .    because @xmath91 was assumed to be small , eq . ( [ eq16 ] ) has an asymptotic character . therefore to make it work some additional assumptions must be made about orders of @xmath73 .",

    "this is precisely the condition @xmath4 discussed in the introduction .",
    "continuing to the next order one obtains @xmath98 if @xmath99 then the asymptotic expression ( [ eq19 ] ) fails . to have a balanced equation for @xmath95",
    ", we must now assume that @xmath100 .",

    "( [ eq20 ] ) gives two threshold conditions @xmath97 and @xmath102 , see fig .",
    "the latter condition indicates onset of the oscillatory instability for @xmath103 thus we have formulated analytic criterion for the oscillatory instability .",
    "it is also clear that the point @xmath104 is a source for the novel stationary instability , see rightmost region @xmath105 , @xmath106 in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , where an eigenvalue which is positive throughout this region can not be predicted by eq .",
    "( [ eq19 ] ) .",
    "it follows by recurrence that if @xmath107 then to have a balanced equation for @xmath95 we must assume that @xmath108 . in other words asymptotic expansion near the neutral modes can only describe the soliton spectrum in regions of the parameter space which are close to codimension-@xmath109 bifurcation . if @xmath110 then only one condition must be satisfied and our asymptotic approach predicts presence of either two purely imaginary or two purely real eigenvalues , which can collide at zero . if @xmath111 then two conditions must be satisfied and the asymptotic approach predicts presence of two pairs of eigenvalues which can be real , imaginary or complex .",
    "in this situation the soliton becomes oscillation unstable providing that two pairs of imaginary eigenvalues collided .",

    "general formulae ( [ eq16]),([eq16a ] ) giving soliton eigenvalues with any degree of accuracy and criterion for the oscillatory instability ( [ eq20a ] ) are main novel results of this work . at the same time expressions for the eigenvalues near the stationary instability threshold ,",
    "analogs of the formula @xmath113 , have been earlier obtained in a number of papers .",
    "it is instructive now to give explicit expressions for @xmath73 in the two simplest situations of one- and two - parameter solitons and to compare them with previously reported results .",

    "@xmath97 has been previously found for two - parameter solitons in different physical contexts @xcite .",
    "however derivation of an accurate expression for the soliton eigenvalues near this threshold has remained a controvertial problem .",

    "( [ eq19 ] ) , ( [ eq22a ] ) , ( [ eq22b]),([eq22c ] ) and eigenvalues which can be calculated from the ordinary differential equations for soliton parameters presented in @xcite one will discover that results are slightly different @xcite .",
    "it has also been argued @xcite that the sign of @xmath120 , which is the first term in eq .",

    "i would like to mention derivation of finite - dimensional normal forms describing dynamical evolution of the soliton parameters near the oscillatory instability threshold .",
    "a guideline for this work can be theory of g. iooss @xcite for the normal forms of the reversible ordinary differential equations @xcite in vicinity of the codimension-2 bifurcation , wich is an equivalent of the our point @xmath121 .",
    "the simplest case of the codimension-1 stationary instability , @xmath97 , has only one homoclinic orbit separating regions of the periodic oscillations from the spreading or collapse @xcite .",
