    "in this paper , we present a new construction of the minimal unitary representation of @xmath0(_i.e . _",
    "the maximally split real form of the exceptional lie group @xmath2 ) on a hilbert space of complex functions in 29 variables .",
    "the minimal realizations of classical lie algebras and of @xmath3 were given by joseph a long time ago  @xcite .",
    "the existence of the minimal unitary representation of @xmath0was first proved by vogan @xcite who located it within the framework of langland s classification .",
    "later , the minimal unitary representations of all simply laced groups , including @xmath0 , @xmath1and @xmath4were constructed by kazhdan and savin  @xcite , and brylinski and kostant  @xcite by rather different methods .",
    "gross and wallach gave yet another construction of the minimal representation of @xmath0as well as for all exceptional groups of real rank four @xcite .",
    "for the exceptional group @xmath0 the minimal orbit is 58 dimensional , corresponding to its quotient by a distinguished parabolic subgroup .",
    "the representations of @xmath0 over the spaces of functions on the 128 dimensional coset space @xmath5 were studied in @xcite .",
    "while formulas for @xmath3 similar to the ones derived here for @xmath0can be found in  @xcite , however , an explicit realization of the simple root ( chevalley ) generators in terms of pseudo - differential operators for the simply laced exceptional groups was given only very recently  @xcite , together with the spherical vectors necessary for the construction of modular forms .",
    "we present here an alternative realization of @xmath0 , which has the advantage of yielding very compact formulas , in contradistinction to the rather complicated expressions obtained by multiple commutation of the simple root generators @xcite .",
    "the main reason for the relative simplicity of our final expressions ( [ e7gen ] ) and ( [ e7e8gen ] ) is their manifest @xmath6 covariance , in spite of the fact that @xmath6 is not realized linearly .",
    "the compactness of our formulas makes them especially suitable for applications in string and m theory which have primarily motivated the present work .",
    "although the present article is mainly addressed to a physicists audience , let us first summarize the main results in a somewhat more mathematical language .",
    "the minimal representation of a noncompact group @xmath7 corresponds , in general , to the quantization of its smallest co - adjoint orbit . in the case of @xmath0",
    "the minimal co - adjoint orbit is 58-dimensional .",
    "starting from the 5-graded decomposition of the associated lie algebra @xmath8 given in eq .",
    "( 4 ) below , it can be obtained simply as the co - adjoint orbit of the highest root generator ( designated by @xmath9 in eq .",
    "( 6 ) ) . in this 5-graded decomposition of @xmath8",
    "one can readily identify a maximal non - semisimple subalgebra @xmath10 as the annihilator of this generator , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath11=0\\ ] ]    the subalgebra @xmath10 is generated by the grade zero subalgebra @xmath12 together with the grade 1 and grade 2 elements of the full @xmath8 lie algebra ( _ i.e. _ the generators @xmath13 and @xmath9 in eq .  ( 6 ) ) .",
    "the orthogonal complement of this parabolic subalgebra is a 58 dimensional nilpotent subalgebra @xmath14 . in the notation of section  2 ,",
    "the latter is generated by the grade 0 element @xmath15 , the grade @xmath16 elements @xmath17 , and the grade @xmath18 element @xmath19 .",
    "acting with this nilpotent subalgebra on the generator @xmath9 corresponding to the highest root one obtains the generators corresponding to the minimal orbit .",
    "thus we see that the minimal orbit can be identified with the coset space @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the parabolic subgroup generated by @xmath10 .",
    "we were led to this minimal unitary representation rather naturally from the novel geometric realization of @xmath0 on @xmath22 found in our previous work @xcite .",
    "as shown there , the exceptional groups can be realized via conformal or quasiconformal transformations leaving invariant generalized `` light - cones '' ; these transformations are analogous to the non - linear action of the mbius group on the real line .",
    "our construction relied essentially on the connection with jordan algebras and freudenthal triple systems . to proceed from there to the unitary realization on a suitable ( infinite dimensional ) hilbert space of functions",
    ", we must first identify a phase space realization of this system and then quantize it . for the @xmath1subgroup",
    "this phase space realization involves 28 coordinates @xmath23 and 28 momenta @xmath24 , such that all @xmath1variations can be realized via the canonical action @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the appropriate @xmath1charge . for the canonical realization of the full @xmath0we",
    "have to add the momentum @xmath27 conjugate to the 57th coordinate @xmath28 , and replace the mbius action on @xmath28 by the symplectic realization acting on the two dimensional phase space spanned by @xmath28 and @xmath27 . the minimal unitary representation of @xmath0is then obtained by quantization , i.e. replacement of the classical momenta by differential operators .",
    "this requires in addition a prescription how to deal with the ordering ambiguities arising in the non - linear expressions for the lie algebra generators .",
    "the latter are then realized as self - adjoint operators on some dense subspace of @xmath29 .",
    "this coordinate space ( schrdinger ) representation is reformulated in section  3 as an oscillator realization in terms of annihilation and creation operators acting in a particle basis . by going to the corresponding coherent state basis of this oscillator realization labelled by 29 complex coordinates one obtains the fock - bargmann realization of the minimal unitary representation over an hilbert space of holomorphic functions .",
    "the irreducibility of the minimal representation is put in evidence by showing that the quadratic casimir operator of @xmath0 , when expressed in terms of either the coordinate or the oscillator basis reduces to a @xmath30-number ; a general argument shows that likewise the higher order casimirs reduce to @xmath30-numbers in our realization .",
    "when restricted to the subgroup @xmath31 the minimal representation decomposes into an infinite sum ( actually an integral , see @xcite ) of irreducible representations of @xmath31 .",
    "remarkably , the quadratic casimir of @xmath1 obtained from the minimal realization is identical with the quartic invariant of @xmath1 when expressed as a function of the 28 coordinate and 28 momentum operators ( or equivalently , the 28 annihilation and 28 creation operators in the oscillator basis ) .",
    "the irreducible representations of @xmath32 that occur in the decomposition of the minimal representation @xmath0 w.r.t .",
    "@xmath31 are all labelled by the eigenvalues of this quartic invariant .    as already mentioned our chief aim with the present work",
    "is to present the results in such a way that they can be readily applied in the context of string and m theory ( for instance , readers familiar with @xcite should have no difficulties following our exposition ) .",
    "in particular , our results apply in the context of the ( super)conformal quantum mechanics description of quantum black holes  @xcite . in that work ,",
    "unitary representations of @xmath32 played a crucial role in the classification of physical states .",
    "it is therefore an obvious idea to extend these concepts to maximal supergravity .",
    "indeed , the candidate hamiltonian which we obtain as one of the @xmath0lie algebra generators reads @xmath33 \\label{l0}\\ ] ] which is precisely of the form studied by the authors of  @xcite , with the only difference that they have a ( coupling ) constant instead of the differential operator @xmath34 . here",
    "@xmath35 is the quartic invariant of @xmath1expressed as a function of the 28 + 28 variables @xmath23 and @xmath24 ; when acting on one of the irreducible subrepresentations of @xmath1under its subgroup @xmath36 it yields the associated eigenvalue of the quadratic @xmath6 casimir .",
    "as shown for instance in  @xcite in the context of the classical theory , the quartic invariant can assume both positive and negative values , and vanishes for @xmath37 or @xmath38 bps black hole solutions of @xmath39 supergravity  @xcite .",
    "it is therefore tempting to interpret ( [ l0 ] ) as the effective hamiltonian describing ( in some approximation ) @xmath39 quantum black holes , such that every subrepresentation with a fixed eigenvalue of the operator @xmath35 is identified with the space of physical states associated with the corresponding black hole solution of @xmath39 supergravity .",
    "an interpretation along similar lines has also been suggested in  @xcite .",
    "interestingly , for the vanishing eigenvalues of @xmath35 , the hamiltonian simplifies drastically , and the state space reduces to the well known singleton representation of @xmath32 .    another ( and possibly related ) physical application of minimal representations has been outlined in  @xcite . that work evolved from an earlier attempt to determine the @xmath40 corrections directly from the supermembrane and to understand them in terms of so - called `` theta - correspondences ''  @xcite",
    "; see also  @xcite for a related attempt to come to grips with the non - linearities of the supermembrane .",
    "we first recall some basic features of the non - linear realization of @xmath0on @xmath22 coordinatized by 57 real variables @xmath41 ( @xmath42 ) , see  @xcite for our notations and conventions , and further details .",
    "a key ingredient in that construction was the 5-graded decomposition of @xmath0w.r.t .",
    "its subgroup @xmath43 .",
    "denoting its lie algebra by @xmath8 we have @xmath44 an important property of this decomposition is the fact that the subspaces of grade @xmath45 and @xmath46 together form a maximal heisenberg subalgebra .",
    "the corresponding generators @xmath47 and @xmath48 obey the commutation relations @xmath49 } & = & 2{\\mathrm{i}}\\,\\delta^{ij}_{kl } e \\,.\\ ] ] obviously , this algebra can be realized as a classical poisson algebra on a phase space with 28 coordinates @xmath23 and 28 momenta @xmath50 , and one extra real coordinate @xmath28 to represent the central term .",
    "we have @xmath51 it is then straightforward to determine the generators of the @xmath12 subalgebra in terms of these phase space variables ( for instance by requiring that they reproduce the @xmath1variations _ via _ ( [ poisson ] ) ) .",
    "they are realized by the following 63 + 70 bilinear expressions in @xmath23 and @xmath24 @xmath52 g^{ijkl } & : = & -{{\\textstyle { \\frac{1}{2 } } } } x^{[ij } x^{kl ] }                + { { \\textstyle { \\frac{1}{48 } } } } \\epsilon^{ijklmnpq } p_{mn } p_{pq } \\,.\\ ] ]    to extend this canonical realization to the full @xmath0 , we need one more variable , the momentum @xmath27 conjugate to @xmath28 . combining the symplectic realization of @xmath32 with the non - linear variations ( 23 ) and ( 24 ) of  @xcite we",
    "can then deduce the classical ( phase space ) analogs of the @xmath0generators .",
    "owing to the non - linearity of the realization , the resulting expressions are not only quadratic , but go up to fourth order in the phase space variables @xmath23 and @xmath24 , and moreover contain inverse powers of @xmath28 .",
    "thus all generators of @xmath0can be realized on a 58-dimensional phase space coordinatized by @xmath53 . the minimal unitary 29 dimensional representation of @xmath0is then obtained by quantization , i.e. by introducing the usual momentum operators obeying the canonical commutation relations @xmath54 \\;=\\ ; { \\mathrm{i}}\\,\\delta^{ij}_{kl}\\ , , \\qquad [ y , p ] \\;=\\ ; { \\mathrm{i}}\\ , .",
    "{ \\nonumber}\\ ] ] in elevating the @xmath0generators to quantum operators the only problem _ vis -  - vis _ the classical phase space description is the non - commutativity of the coordinate and momentum operators , which requires some ordering prescription ( we note , that the @xmath1generators ( [ e7gen ] ) are insensitive to re - ordering the coordinates and momenta ) .",
    "since we are interested in finding a unitary representation we insist that all operators are hermitean w.r.t . to the standard scalar product on @xmath29 .",
    "we thus arrive at a unitary representation of the @xmath0lie algebra in terms of self - adjoint operators acting on ( some dense subspace of ) a hilbert space of complex functions in 29 real variables @xmath55 .",
    "we emphasize that this realization requires _ complex _ functions , for the same reason that the schrdinger representation of the one - dimensional point particle requires complex wave functionscan be rewritten in terms of bosonic annihilation and creation operators . in the corresponding coherent state basis",
