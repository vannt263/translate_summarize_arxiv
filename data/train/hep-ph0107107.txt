    "lepton flavor violating ( lfv ) interactions are among the most promising candidates to understand the physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "the improvement of their experimental measurements forces to make more elaborate theoretical calculations and to determine the unknown parameters existing in the models used . @xmath0 and @xmath1 decays are the examples for the lfv decays and the current limits for their branching ratios ( @xmath2 ) are @xmath3 @xcite and @xmath4 @xcite respectively .",
    "lfv interactions have been analysed in different models in the literature .",
    "they were studied in a model independent way in @xcite , in the framework of model iii 2hdm @xcite , in supersymmetric models @xcite .",
    "recently , the electromagnetic suppression of the decay rate of @xmath5 has been predicted in @xcite .",
    "further , the processes @xmath1 and @xmath0 have been studied as probes of neutrino mass models in @xcite .",
    "lfv processes do not exist in the standard model ( sm ) if the cabibbo- kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) type matrix in the leptonic sector vanishes and this stimulates one to go beyond .",
    "the general two higgs doublet model , so called model iii , permits such interactions which appear at least in the loop level , with the internal mediating neutral higgs bosons @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "note that , in this case , there is no charged flavor changing ( fc ) interaction .",
    "there are large number of free parameters and their strength can be detemined by the experimental data .",
    "choice of complex yukawa couplings causes the cp violating effects which can also provide comprehensive information in the determination of free parameters of the various theoretical models .",
    "non - zero electric dipole moments ( edm ) of the elementary particles are sign of such violations .    in this work",
    ", we study the possiblity of cp asymmetry @xmath8 of decays @xmath9 and @xmath10 in the model iii .",
    "even if the yukawa couplings are taken as complex in general , the model iii does not ensure cp asymmetry for the decays under consideration .",
    "however , by correcting the decay rates of these processes with the additional complex contribution , which may come from the physics beyond the model iii , a measurable @xmath8 can be obtained . here , we assume that the complexity of the new contribution is due to not the yukawa type couplings , but probably to radiative corrections in this model .",
    "therefore , the forthcoming experimental measurements of possible @xmath8 for both processes open a new window understand the physics beyond the sm .    the paper is organized as follows : in section 2 , we present the possible cp violating asymmetry for lfv decays @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "section 3 is devoted to discussion and our conclusions .",
    "our starting point is type iii 2hdm which permits flavor changing neutral currents ( fcnc ) at tree level .",

    "the bosons @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the neutral cp even @xmath26 and cp odd @xmath27 , respectively since there is no mixing between cp even neutral higgs bosons @xmath28 and @xmath26 at tree level .",
    "the part which produce fcnc ( at tree level ) is @xmath29 the yukawa matrices @xmath30 have in general complex entries .",
    "note that in the following we replace @xmath31 with @xmath32 where `` n '' denotes the word `` neutral '' .",
    "now , let us consider the lepton number violating process @xmath33 . here",
    ", we expect that the main contribution to this decay comes from the neutral higgs bosons , namely , @xmath6 and @xmath7 , in the leptonic sector of the model iii , ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) . using on - shell renormalization scheme",
    "the self energy diagrams vanish and only the vertex diagram ( fig .",
    "[ fig1]-c ) contributes . by taking @xmath34 lepton for the internal line ,",
    "the decay width @xmath35 becomes @xcite @xmath36 where @xmath37 @xmath38 and the function @xmath39 reads @xmath40 with @xmath41 . in eq .",

    "we ignore the contributions coming from internal @xmath46 and @xmath47 leptons , respecting our assumption on the yukawa couplings ( see discussion ) .    at this stage",
    ", we calculate the cp asymmetry @xmath8 of the process @xmath48 , given by the expression @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the decay width for the cp conjugate process .",
    "however , in the framework of the model iii , @xmath8 vanishes and one needs an extra quantity to switch on the cp asymmetry .",
    "therefore , we assume that there is an additional small and complex contribution @xmath51 due to the physics beyond the model iii such that the factor @xmath52 is corrected as @xmath53 further , we force that the complexity of @xmath51 comes from the possible radiative corrections but not from the yukawa type couplings , in the model beyond the model iii .",
    "this choice of @xmath51 brings a non - zero cp violation for the process",
    "@xmath9 : @xmath54 where @xmath55 with @xmath56 , @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "of course , the amount of @xmath8 produced depends on the amount of new quantity introduced , however even a small contribution may bring a measurable @xmath8 for this process .",
    "now , we would like to discuss the similar analysis for another lfv decay , @xmath1 .",
    "the decay width for this process is calculated by taking only the @xmath34-lepton as an internal one @xcite and it reads as @xmath59 [ dwtaumugam ] where @xmath60 and @xmath61 . here the amplitudes @xmath62 and @xmath63 have right and left chirality , respectively . the function @xmath39 is given in eq .",

    "we get @xmath70 where @xmath71 and @xmath72 with @xmath73 and @xmath74 .",
    "similar to the process @xmath0 , the amount of @xmath8 strongly depends on the new quantity introduced and a small contribution may bring measurable @xmath8 for this process also .",
    "in the case of vanishing charged interactions , with the assumption that ckm type matrix in the leptonic sector does not exist , lfv interactions are possible in the one - loop , due to neutral higgs bosons @xmath26 and @xmath27 , in the framework of model iii . in general , the yukawa couplings @xmath75 appearing in the expressions are complex and they ensure non - zero lepton edm . however , this scenario is not enough to get a cp violating asymmetry in the lfv processes , @xmath9 and @xmath10 . to obtain such asymmetry , we introduce a small model independent correction term to the decay width with the following features :    * this term is due to the physics beyond the model iii * it is complex and the complexity does not come from the yukawa type couplings    the additional contributions respecting the above conditions bring non - zero @xmath8 to both processes underconsideration . however , this extra quantity is completely unknown and the number of parameters , namely complex yukawa couplings and new model independent quantity , increases in the numerical calculations . to solve this problem , first",
    ", we assume that the yukawa couplings @xmath76 , are small compared to @xmath77 since the strength of them are related with the masses of leptons denoted by the indices of them , similar to the cheng - sher scenerio @xcite .",
    "further , we take @xmath42 symmetric with respect to the indices @xmath78 and @xmath79 . therefore",
    "only the combination @xmath80 ( the couplings @xmath81 and @xmath82 ) for the process @xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) plays the main role in our analysis .",
