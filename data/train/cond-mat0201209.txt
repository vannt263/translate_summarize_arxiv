    "strong electron correlations in multi - band , orbitally degenerate systems represent an important current theoretical challenge . a lively experimental playground for that is provided by electron- and hole - doped fullerene systems , which exhibit a variety of behavior , including unconventional metals like cubic csc@xmath6@xcite , superconductors of the a@xmath5c@xmath6 family ( a= k , rb , cs)@xcite , superconducting fet devices@xcite , and insulators , presumably of the mott - jahn - teller type@xcite . among them we can place a@xmath7c@xmath6 @xcite , na@xmath8c@xmath6@xcite and the class of compounds nh@xmath5k@xmath5c@xmath6 , nh@xmath5k@xmath8rbc@xmath6 , nh@xmath5krb@xmath8c@xmath6 , as well as nh@xmath5rb@xmath5c@xmath6@xcite . in these ammoniated compounds ,",
    "insertion of the electronically inert nh@xmath5 molecules acts to expand the c@xmath6 lattice , turning the cubic , metallic and superconducting state of k@xmath5c@xmath6 into an orthorhombic narrow - gap antiferromagnetic insulator @xcite . in this transition ,",
    "the increase in volume per c@xmath6 molecule relative to k@xmath5c@xmath6 , with its probable slight decrease of electron effective bandwidth @xmath9 , is believed to play an important role , as confirmed by the pressure - induced reversion to a fully metallic and superconducting  while still orthorhombic ",
    "phase @xcite .    nonetheless , a possible role of the crystal - structure anisotropy in this mott transition  a transition generally believed to occur more readily for reduced orbital degeneracy@xcite , can not be excluded .",
    "it has even been proposed that precisely the splitting of degeneracy@xcite induced by the orthorhombic distortion could be the crucial ingredient driving the transition from the metal and superconductor to the insulator @xcite .",
    "earlier work showed the mott transition in @xmath10-orbitally degenerate lattice models to take place at larger values of @xmath11 for larger degeneracy , roughly proportionally to @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "a strong enough `` crystal - field '' splitting of the threefold degenerate @xmath13 molecular orbital of c@xmath6 caused by orthorhombic anisotropy could remove one or several bands away from the fermi level , effectively reducing the orbital degeneracy @xmath10 , thus shifting the mott transition to a smaller critical value @xmath14 . exploring this concept ,",
    "the basic question is how strong this splitting must be to promote such an effective reduction of degeneracy . in a non - interacting system",
    ", that reduction would clearly require a splitting magnitude similar to or larger than the full electron bandwidth @xmath9 . in a strongly - interacting system , it is important to understand whether influencing the metal - insulator transition will again require anisotropic splittings as large as the bandwidth , or else if some smaller energy scale will emerge in its place .    in this paper",
    "we exploit dynamical mean field theory ( dmft)@xcite to answer this question , studying the effects of a band splitting on the mott transition of an orbitally degenerate , strongly - correlated metal . for that purpose",
    "we adopt the simplest idealization , namely a @xmath15 orbitally degenerate hubbard model with bandwidth @xmath9 and on - site repulsion @xmath16 , and mimic the noncubic anisotropy by a diagonal splitting @xmath0 between the two bands . in this model , we study the @xmath17 phase diagram in the @xmath18 plane , and examine in particular how the mott transition is influenced by the splitting . as the aim of the calculation is understanding a simple , and possibly fairly general physical mechanism , we do not attempt a realistic calculation of the kind that was accomplished recently for ni and fe @xcite .",
    "the main result found is that the effect is remarkably strong at large @xmath16 , where the anisotropy - induced transition between the correlated multi - band metal and the mott insulator takes place very readily , in fact for @xmath19 .",
    "we interpret that as follows . the metallic band , originally of width @xmath9 , is renormalized in the strongly correlated metal into a narrower `` kondo - like '' quasiparticle peak of width @xmath3 , with @xmath20 as @xmath21 .",
    "close enough to the isotropic and orbitally degenerate mott transition at @xmath22 , the correlated two - band metal can be driven effectively one band by a splitting as small as the kondo energy scale @xmath23 .",
    "the one - band metal , in turn , has a lower @xmath24 , so that the resulting state is an insulator .    with this model result in hand ,",
    "we move on to consider nh@xmath5k@xmath5c@xmath6 , where we carry out a dft - lda ( density functional theory in the local density approximation ) electronic - structure calculation to extract an order of magnitude for the effective orthorhombic splitting parameter @xmath25 , found to be of order @xmath26 . despite the obvious differences between the two - band hubbard model and the true three band system",
    ", we suggest that the orthorhombic splitting will similarly drive the initially cubic fulleride with a small quasiparticle residue @xmath27 from metal to insulator . in turn , in the light of our simple - model phase diagram , the return to metallicity of the ammoniated orthorhombic fulleride under pressure leads to an interesting question regarding the effective number of bands in that metal .",
    "it is finally concluded that anisotropy is likely a relevant element in promoting the mott state in this material .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : sec .",
    "[ model : sec ] introduces the model and deals with its simple limiting cases .",
    "the calculation and results within the dmft are described is sec .",
    "[ dmft : sec ] .",
    "the @xmath13 band structure of nh@xmath5k@xmath5c@xmath6 and its splitting due to anisotropy is described in sec .",
    "[ bands : sec ] . the discussion and conclusions are finally presented in sec .",
    "[ discussion : sec ] .",
    "we work with the simplest two - band hubbard model , assuming purely diagonal hoppings between orbitals on different sites , the anisotropic symmetry lowering all embodied in a diagonal on - site splitting term .",
    "we write the hamiltonian as : @xmath28 where @xmath29 creates a spin-@xmath30 electron in orbital @xmath31 at site @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 is the total number of electrons at site @xmath32 , and @xmath35 denotes nearest - neighbor sites .",
    "the first term is a standard tight - binding hopping , simplified to ignore non - diagonal hopping , and also merohedral disorder , both of them present in the real systems .",
    "the second term introduces the anisotropic splitting @xmath0 as a shift of the on - site orbital energy @xmath36 .",
    "the last term is the hubbard on - site interaction , which we take in its simplest form , omitting for example any additional intra - site hund s rule interaction terms .",
    "we also ignore the on - site electron - vibron couplings and the ensuing jahn - teller effects , even if quite important for other aspects@xcite .    in the @xmath37 limit ,",
    "the splitting @xmath38 simply operates a rigid shift of band 2 upwards with respect to band 1 , promoting electron transfer from the upper to the lower band . above a critical value @xmath39 , and for a total electron filling @xmath40 , the upper band is emptied up .",
    "for example , with two symmetric bands of width @xmath9 and @xmath41 electrons per site , the upper band is emptied above @xmath42 . at zero temperature ( where we shall restrict ourselves in this paper ) and zero interaction , @xmath37 , the transition between the `` two - band metal '' and",
    "the `` one - band metal '' is continuous . because the topology of the fermi surface changes , this transition is accompanied by a weak singularity of the total energy first described by lifshitz@xcite .",
    "when the electron - electron interaction @xmath16 is turned on , one expects the emptying of the upper band to take place at smaller values of @xmath43 , owing to the effective band narrowing .",
    "perturbatively in @xmath16 one can show that @xmath44 where the value of the coefficient @xmath45 depends on details of the bands .",
    "in addition , electron - electron interactions might modify the nature of the metal - metal transition singularity relative to the non - interacting case@xcite , a point which we will not further address here .",
    "we restrict to a filling of one electron per site , @xmath46 , discarding the trivial case @xmath47 where the large-@xmath0 state is a band insulator , as well as noninteger @xmath48 , where insulators are not possible .",
    "the @xmath49 and @xmath50 limits reduce then , respectively , to the ( quarter - filled ) two - band and the ( half - filled ) single - band hubbard models , both possessing a metal - insulator transition as a function of @xmath16 @xcite .",
    "in particular , we are not interested in the weak - coupling antiferromagnetic instability , of the ensuing large-@xmath0 half - filled band , associated to nesting in specific hopping structures : we assume a genuine mott transition for the half - filled single - band model to occur at a finite @xmath51 .",
    "the limit of strong interaction @xmath52 is insulating for any value of @xmath0 .",
    "this limit can be studied by mapping the model ( [ hamiltonian : eq ] ) onto a spin and orbital exchange hamiltonian which reads@xcite : @xmath53 where the pseudospin-1/2 operators @xmath54 represent the orbital degrees of freedom , and @xmath55 . for @xmath49 this model has been studied both in one@xcite and two dimensions @xcite , with suggestions that interesting spin - liquid physics could be realized . for our purposes , it suffices to note that the model has no ferro - orbital instability , and has therefore a finite @xmath56 orbital susceptibility . as a consequence it takes a nonzero value of @xmath0 to fully orbitally polarize the ground state . due to",
    "the absence of cross - band terms in the kinetic energy , complete orbital polarization occurs at a finite @xmath57 . for @xmath58 that ground state",
    "is represented by a one band mott insulator plus a totally empty split - off band .",
    "notice , finally , that for the specific case we are interested ( @xmath46 electron in a two - fold degenerate band ) no orbital ordering is present at weak coupling ; the possibility of antiferro - orbital ordering within the mott insulating phase , on the other hand , depends crucially on the details of the hoppings and lattice coordination , and it is , in any case , beyond the scope of any single - site dmft study .",
    "we have now all the elements to illustrate the general layout , sketched in fig .",
    "[ phased_th : fig ] , of the zero - temperature phase diagram of model in eq .",
    "( [ hamiltonian : eq ] ) as a function of @xmath18 for @xmath46 electron per site .",
    "the metal - insulator transition for @xmath48=1 , @xmath15 and @xmath49 , previously studied in dmft by quantum monte carlo @xcite , was found at @xmath59 at the relatively low temperature @xmath60 .",
    "the same transition with @xmath46 in the one - band model ( @xmath61 , or @xmath15 at @xmath62 ) has been similarly calculated at @xmath63 also at @xmath60@xcite .",
    "finite temperature of course must affect somewhat these numerical values , but a common feature with our zero - temperature dmft calculation described below , is that @xmath64 . the ab line in fig .",
    "[ phased_th : fig ] , representing @xmath24 as a function of @xmath0 and separating metals from mott insulators , indicates this trend .",
    "the dm line separates the fully orbitally polarized mott insulator ( at the right ) from the two - band insulator , roughly as @xmath65 for small @xmath0 .",
    "similarly , the cm line separates the fully orbitally polarized metal from the two - band metal : it starts from point c with a linear slope @xmath66 , according to eq .",
    "( [ smallu ] ) . in the region of full orbital polarization",
    "the value of @xmath0 is irrelevant , and this is the reason why the mott transition line mb is horizontal . as @xmath0 increases , for @xmath67 the upper - band emptying transition takes the two - band metal across the cm line over to a one - band metal , while for @xmath68 it leads across the am line to a mott insulating state .",
    "the am line starts off linearly at small @xmath0 .",
    "basically , this occurs since in close proximity of the mott transition the relevant energy scale , to be matched by the orbital splitting @xmath0 , is no longer the bare bandwidth , but rather the width of the kondo - like quasiparticle peak of the correlated metal .",
    "that in turn is of the order of @xmath3 , which is smaller than @xmath9 and proportional to the quasiparticle residue @xmath27 , linearly vanishing with @xmath69 at the mott transition@xcite . as the dmft calculations will show , the effective emptying transition occurs when @xmath0 increases to reach @xmath70 .",
    "the purpose of the dmft calculations is to investigate this phase diagram in greater quantitative detail , in particular in the region of intermediate @xmath71 and @xmath72 .",
    "we have implemented dmft in the exact diagonalization flavor @xcite for the degenerate hubbard model on the bethe lattice , restricted to paramagnetic states @xcite .",
    "the advantage of the exact diagonalization method over the monte carlo approach in the solution of the impurity problem rests primarily in its being less computationally intensive ",
    "useful when studying the phase diagram of a model as a function of more than one parameter  and in its ability to address zero - temperature properties @xcite .",
    "the results of the dmft calculations are summarized in fig .",
    "[ phase_diagram : fig ] .",
    "the values we obtain for @xmath73 and @xmath74 , associated to the disappearance of the metallic state for one and two bands respectively , have been calculated with the same number of discretized bath levels per band @xmath75 .",
    "the associated error bar is estimated by repeating the calculation with @xmath76 .",
    "these values are in substantial agreement with corresponding values obtained by other methods@xcite .",
    "the other points in the phase diagram are obtained by following the stability of the two - band metal for a given value of @xmath16 and increasing @xmath0 , marking the emptying transition to the one - band metal or to the insulator .",
    "a deficiency of this single - site dmft calculation  which is restricted as usual to paramagnetic states only  is the absence of a two - band insulating state for @xmath38 .",
    "in fact , the suppression of the antiferro orbital fluctuations embodied in the exchange model ( [ hexch ] ) produces a fictitious infinite uniform orbital susceptibility which leads to full orbital polarization as soon as @xmath0 is turned on @xcite . despite this limitation ,",
    "the results of the present calculations are suggestive , revealing the announced sharp reduction of the metal - insulator @xmath77 for small but finite @xmath0 . indeed",
    ", our calculations give a @xmath78 which is roughly proportional to the quasiparticle residue @xmath79 of the undistorted ( @xmath49 ) correlated metal at @xmath80 , @xmath81 with a proportionality constant @xmath82 .",
    "since @xmath79 vanishes as @xmath83 , most likely linearly in @xmath69 @xcite , even a very small @xmath25 can be enough to cause a metal - insulator transition in the strongly correlated metal .",
    "for example , following the bold arrow at @xmath84 in fig .",
    "[ phase_diagram : fig ] , a @xmath0 value as small as @xmath85 is sufficient to cross the transition line from the metal to insulator .    further illustrating that , in fig .  [",
    "spec_dens : fig ] we show the behavior of the spectral density @xmath86 @xmath87 being the one - particle green s function of band @xmath31 , on both sides of the metal - insulator transition .",
    "the asymmetry of the upper - band spectral density @xmath88 ( solid lines ) is very pronounced , as this band is nearly ( @xmath89 ) or completely ( @xmath90 ) empty .",
    "as soon as the kondo - like peaks of the two bands differ enough in energy to induce the emptying of band 2 , the lower - band spectral density @xmath91 takes the symmetric shape , characteristic of the half - filled one - band hubbard model . here",
    "the kondo peak disappears completely , as this value of @xmath92 puts the hubbard model of band 1 well inside the insulating regime .",
    "the above model calculations show that a small splitting @xmath93 of the orbitally degenerate band can drive the metal - insulator transition .",
    "we now wish to explore the implications that this result  if assumed to be more general than the simple model where it was derived  can have on the metal - insulator transition which takes place between isoelectronic k@xmath5c@xmath6 and nh@xmath5k@xmath5c@xmath6 ( the former cubic and the latter orthorhombic ) , and on the insulator - metal transition of nh@xmath5k@xmath5c@xmath6 itself under pressure .    to obtain a quantitative estimate of the actual strength of anisotropy in the ammoniated fulleride , we carried out comparative dft - lda electronic structure calculations for k@xmath5c@xmath6 and a simplified but meaningful model of nh@xmath5k@xmath5c@xmath6 using the pwscf package based on plane waves and ultrasoft pseudopotentials@xcite .",
    "we took a lattice constant @xmath94    for fcc k@xmath5c@xmath6 , and @xmath95    for nh@xmath5k@xmath5c@xmath6 , the latter with a centered tetragonal unit cell with @xmath96 , neglecting the exceedingly small difference between @xmath97 and @xmath98 . in both calculations a single - c@xmath6 unit cell was used , as pictured in fig .",
    "[ geometry_nh3:fig ] . in these model structures and calculations , we ignored merohedral disorder , as well as the rich antiferro - rotational structure recently discovered in actual nh@xmath5k@xmath5c@xmath6@xcite .",
    "we used 27  ry and 160  ry plane wave energy cut - offs for the wavefunctions and the charge density , respectively .",
    "the fermi surface was smeared with parameter of 0.3 ev and a @xmath99 monkhorst and pack mesh @xcite .",
    "the density of states ( dos ) was calculated as a sum of gaussians of width @xmath100 ev sampling @xmath101-space with a uniform @xmath102 mesh .",
    "[ bands_nh3:fig ] shows the @xmath13 bands of nh@xmath5k@xmath5c@xmath6 ( a ) , compared to those of k@xmath5c@xmath6 ( c ) ; the corresponding density of states are compared in panels ( b ) and ( d ) .",
    "we find that the presence of the inserted nh@xmath5 molecules modifies only weakly the essentially pure c@xmath6 @xmath13 conduction band , as expected .",
    "the difference in the two band structures are almost entirely due to the different lattice structures of the molecular centers .",
    "small changes appear in the details of the bands throughout the brillouin zone , but both compounds are predicted in lda to be three - band metals , their overall @xmath13 density of states not dissimilar in the ammonia - intercalated and pristine compound . in particular , as apparent from fig .",
    "[ bands_nh3:fig](b ) , the bandwidths of nh@xmath5k@xmath5c@xmath6 and k@xmath5c@xmath6 are close , @xmath103  ev . the main difference in the two band structures is a splitting of the threefold degenerate @xmath13 band of k@xmath5c@xmath6 at the @xmath104 point of nh@xmath5k@xmath5c@xmath6 .",
    "this splitting is precisely a measure of the strength of the non - cubic crystalline environment seen by the @xmath13 orbital on each fullerene molecule in the orthorhombic structure of nh@xmath5k@xmath5c@xmath6 .",
    "its magnitude is roughly a quarter ( 0.2 - 0.3 ) of the total bandwidth ; this represents the main result of the dft calculation .",
    "if this material were an uncorrelated metal , this splitting would have no major consequences , just a change of shape of the fermi surface .",
    "the consequences can be much more important due to strong correlations , as discussed below .",
    "the @xmath104-point @xmath13 band splitting  see fig .  [",
    "bands_nh3:fig](a )  can be taken as a crude estimate of the value of @xmath105  ev in nh@xmath5k@xmath5c@xmath6 , corresponding to a dimensionless ratio @xmath106 .",
    "this value is of course too small to determine a complete emptying of one of the bare , uncorrelated bands , and indeed all three bands of nh@xmath5k@xmath5c@xmath6 still cross the fermi energy @xmath107 .",
    "however , correlations play an important role in fullerides , where the value of @xmath16 is believed to lie between 1 and 1.6  ev @xcite , thus substantially larger than the bandwidth @xmath9 . as the non - ammoniated fullerides a@xmath5c@xmath6 are still generally in the metallic and superconducting phase , it is not unreasonable to assume that their value of @xmath11 @xcite is in all likelihood only marginally smaller than the @xmath108 for the mott transition in the half - filled @xmath109-band cubic system .",
    "indirect evidence that ordinary , uncorrelated electronic bands do not exist , and that the electron spectral function at @xmath107 can more reasonably be assimilated to a narrow , dispersionless kondo - like resonance was provided for k@xmath5c@xmath6 by recent photoemission data@xcite .",
    "the analysis of the metal - insulator transition in our simplified two - band model suggests a mechanism for an anisotropy - induced mott transition in a correlated multi - band fermionic system .",
    "clearly , many ingredients which we have left out of our calculation are expected to be quantitatively important for a realistic description of the @xmath13 doped fullerides .",
    "however , we suggest that the mechanism which we have described in secs .  [ model : sec ] and [ dmft : sec ] , whereby a small orthorhombic splitting of the bands is capable , alone , of turning a strongly correlated metal into a mott insulator , could be a qualitatively important ingredient in the description of these systems .",
    "specifically , we suggest that , in the appropriate @xmath18 phase diagram ( sketched in fig .  [ phased_nh3:fig ] ) , the ammoniation of k@xmath5c@xmath6 into orthorhombic nh@xmath5k@xmath5c@xmath6 could correspond to a displacement@xcite similar to that indicated by an arrow in fig .",
    "[ phase_diagram : fig ]",
    ". inspection of fig .",
    "[ phase_diagram : fig ] shows that , if @xmath16 is close enough to @xmath24 , even a value of @xmath0 substantially smaller than that we have estimated for nh@xmath5k@xmath5c@xmath6 could suffice to drive that metal insulator transition .",
    "very recent conductivity measurements @xcite on the class of compounds nh@xmath5k@xmath110rb@xmath111c@xmath6 suggest indeed the orthorhombic distortion as the main ingredient driving the mott transition in these systems .",
    "we should stress that our picture does not exclude a role , in the metal - insulator transition , for the accompanying ammoniation - driven expansion of the lattice . that role is experimentally proven by the pressure - driven insulator - metal transition , where nh@xmath5k@xmath5c@xmath6 is transformed into a metal and a superconductor , despite the permanence of the orthorhombic structure@xcite . however a new , interesting , question raised in fig .",
    "[ phased_nh3:fig ] is what kind of metal does one recover in nh@xmath5k@xmath5c@xmath6 under pressure , whether a three - band metal like the cubic k@xmath5c@xmath6 , or a new effective two - band metal .",
    "the former might in effect require a smaller deformation .",
    "it would be very interesting in this regard if the fermi - surface topology of nh@xmath5k@xmath5c@xmath6 could be studied under pressure .",
    "another interesting  even if perhaps not practically straightforward  test of this overall picture could be obtained by applying uniaxial stress to cubic superconducting fullerides of the a@xmath5c@xmath6 family .",
    "contrary to standard tendency of hydrostatic pressure toward metallization and lower superconducting @xmath112 , the orbital splitting associated with the appropriate uniaxial strain could drive some of these compounds perhaps first toward higher @xmath112 , and eventually mott insulating .",
    "a similar suggestion has been recently put forward , in the context of field - induced superconductivity @xcite , by koch @xcite , although on rather different grounds .",
    "also , recent calculations @xcite of the size and the effects of the charge - inducing electric field on the 2-dimensional c@xmath6 layer , in the field - induced geometry , suggest that this field induces splittings of the molecular levels which might in turn affect the electrons and holes bands in a qualitatitevely similar way to the one we propose here for the orthorhombic field in 3-dimensional fullerides .    in summary",
    ", we have investigated the role of a symmetry - breaking orbital splitting on the transition to a mott insulating state in an initially orbitally degenerate strongly correlated multi - band metal .",
    "the calculations , carried out in a highly idealized @xmath15 model , have unveiled the kondo quasiparticle energy scale as that which the non - cubic splitting magnitude must reach in order to induce the mott transition even at constant bandwidth and effective coulomb repulsion .",
    "the likely relevance of this main qualitative finding to the fullerides k@xmath5c@xmath6 and nh@xmath5k@xmath5c@xmath6 has been highlighted .",
    "we are indebted to o.  gunnarsson and m.  fabrizio , for useful discussions .",

    "this work was partly supported by the european union , contract erbfmrxct970155 ( tmr fulprop ) , and by miur cofin01 , murst cofin99 .",
    "working at zero temperature is a quite important feature in our specific case , where the competition between the splitting @xmath0 and the small quasi - particle residue @xmath27 might be blurred , within a standard monte carlo approach , by finite temperature effects .",
    "the exact diagonalization method suffers , however , from a severe constraint on the number of discretized conduction band states which can be included . as a consequence , for realistic calculations with three or more degenerate orbitals",
