    "new planetary systems containing one or more gas giants are discovered day by day .",
    "present instruments and methods are , however , not capable of detecting rocky planets , hence these discoveries are considered to be rare events . as instruments are getting more and more developed the number of known terrestrial - mass planets is expected to grow significantly ( csizmadia , 2009 ) .",
    "search for extraterrestrial life is also one of the main goals of esa and nasa .",
    "new interferometers of these space agencies are to be launched in the next decade with the aim of discovering and characterizing new earth - like planets .",
    "therefore it is important to investigate the conditions within which the orbits of these planets are stable in the given system .    what would be the outcome in terms of the stability of the solar system , if the masses of jupiter and saturn had been formed in a different way from the cloud envelope of the protostellar sun ? is the solar system unique ? in this work we discuss different cases similar to the solar system to investigate the conditions of habitability on rocky planets .",
    "our research program consists of two main parts .",
    "the first part focuses on calculations related to celestial mechanics that is the stability of the rocky planets is investigated as a function of the masses of the gas giants and as a function of the mass of the sun .",
    "this latter case is closely related to the second part of our work which is the calculation of the extension of the two kinds of habitable zones : the conventional liquid water habitable zone and the ultraviolet habitable zone .",
    "the studied planetary systems are built up from three inner rocky planets : venus , earth , mars and two outer gas giants : @xmath1 and @xmath2 , where @xmath1 is closer while @xmath2 is located farther from the sun . @xmath3 and @xmath4 are the masses of @xmath1 and @xmath2 , respectively . by changing the masses of the gas giants from 0 to 10 @xmath5 where @xmath5 is the mass of jupiter the integration was made for @xmath6 ( @xmath7 : period of saturn ) which is about 150000 years .",
    "initial orbital elements were obtained for j.d .",
    "= 2415020.0 epoch where @xmath1 and @xmath2 were chosen for the parameters of jupiter and saturn , respectively .",
    "stability of the inner planets is described by the maximum of eccentricities and close encounters . for the latter we investigated several parameters but finally chose the difference between the distance of the outer planet s pericentre and the distance of the inner planet s apocentre .    in the other case",
    "the planets masses were constants and the mass of the sun was altered between 0.1 @xmath0 and 10 @xmath0 where @xmath0 is the mass of the sun .",
    "the integration time was the same as in the previous case that is 5000 @xmath7 .",
    "the stability was characterized by the pericentre and apocentre of the planets and both habitable zones were calculated for a few masses . for the latter",
    "the radius of the star was calculated from its mass using the formulae constructed by zaninetti ( 2008 ) .",
    "the liquid water habitable zone ( lw hz ) is a region around a star in which an earth - like planet could support liquid water on its surface ( kasting et al . ,",
    "1993 ) . in the equation that describes the boundaries of the lw hz",
    "the solar system is used as a reference for the calculations of other planetary systems .",
    "an idea from buccino et al .",
    "( 2006 ) was borrowed that there must be both an inner and an outer boundary for sufficient and necessary uv radiation level respectively ( uv hz ) .",
    "it is well known that this radiation induces dna damage ( especially uvb and uvc ) , inhibits photosynthesis ( uva ) and causes lesion in a wide variety of proteins and lipids ( cockell , 1998 ) .",
    "the action spectrum @xmath8 is commonly used as a measure of damage , quantifying the injurious effects of the uv radiation on the biological processes in function of the wavelength ( coohill , 1991 ; horneck , 1995 ; cockell , 1998 ) .",
    "the action spectrum is determined by exponential functions given by modos et al .",
    "( 1999 ) who measured the spectrum by different dosimeters .",
    "the results of uracil dosimeter were chosen for the calculations as uracil is a compound that can be found within the rna .",
    "the biological effective spectrum for each value of wavelength can be obtained by multiplying the action spectrum with the incident radiation . to get a tractable expression for the calculation of the inner boundary ,",
    "the earth was used again as a reference . this way the following inequality was obtained :    @xmath9     + where @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the distances of the inner boundary and of the earth , @xmath12 is the radius and @xmath13 is the emitted energy of the star and of the sun at @xmath14 wavelength and @xmath15 is the multiplicator of the terrestrial uv radiation that still can be tolerated by dna , proteins and photosynthetic process . in other words",
    "this means that these important compounds can bear even @xmath15 times of the uv radiation on earth .    on the other hand",
    "the uv radiation is an important energy source needed for chemical synthesis of complex molecules .",
    "an expression similar to ( 1 ) can be formulated to describe the outer boundary of the uv habitable zone :    @xmath16     + where @xmath17 is the distance of the outer boundary and @xmath18 is the multiplicator of the terrestrial uv radiation which is absolutely necessary for chemical reactions . obviously @xmath18 should be set to be less than 1 .",
    "the borders of the uv hz can also be calculated for the ancient sun since its radiation has increased by about 30% in the last @xmath19 years ( gough , 1981 ) . in this work",
    "the present radiation level was used for the calculations .",
    "stability is investigated by calculating the extrema of the orbital elements ( semimajor axis , eccentricity , pericentre and apocentre distance ) . using these data stability maps in function of the giant planets masses ( @xmath3 and @xmath4 ) were plotted ( see fig .",
    "[ ex ] ( @xmath20 ) , ( @xmath21 ) and ( @xmath22 ) ) .",
    "axis @xmath15 corresponds to the mass @xmath3 while axis @xmath18 to the mass @xmath4 ( both in units of @xmath5 ) .",
    "yellow coloured regions contain those pairs of masses for which the orbits of the rocky planets are the most stable while black colour indicates the most unstable cases .",
    "one can see the + mark at coordinates ( 1 , 1/3 ) which corresponds to one jupiter and one saturn mass , so this is the case of our solar system .",
    "it can be observed that the figures are almost symmetrical to the @xmath23 diagonal line .",
    "this is not surprising regarding that the masses of the two giant planets are expressed in the same unit .",
    "a slight asymmetry can also be noticed , that is caused by the different distances of the giant planets .",
    "for all inner planets the maximum eccentricity is extremely high ( black colour ) for low @xmath3 mass when @xmath4 is about 9  10 @xmath5 .",
    "the reason is that in these cases @xmath3 gets closer to the sun , at about 3 @xmath24 , thus the inner planets migrate outward .",
    "other conspicuous characteristics are the horizontal lines at 1  2.5 @xmath5 of @xmath4 at high masses of @xmath3 .",
    "the explanation is that the maximum semimajor axis of venus gets higher and thus the planet gets closer to earth . even in some cases",
    "the orbit of venus partially overlaps the orbit of mars .",
    "if we take a look at the stability map of mars a big black area is clearly seen at the top right corner .",
