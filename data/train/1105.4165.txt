    "this measurement of the growth of structure relies on redshift - space distortions seen in galaxy surveys @xcite . even though we expect the clustering of galaxies in real space to have no preferred direction , galaxy maps produced by estimating distances from redshifts obtained in spectroscopic surveys reveal an anisotropic galaxy distribution .",

    "several recent studies of redshift space distortions have provided non - linear descriptions of the matter density field in fourier space @xcite which agree well with direct n - body calculations of the effect .",
    "however , we do not generally observe the matter density but rather tracers which tend to live in dark matter halos .",
    "this introduces further effects which must be carefully modelled if we are to achieve the desired accuracy . in this paper",

    "<S> finally , we note that our simulation results confirm the essential but non - trivial assumption that on large scales , the bias inferred from real space clustering of halos is the same one that determines their pairwise infall velocity amplitude at the per cent level .    </S>",
