    "the vacuum angle allows to introduce such flux in the system",
    ".    we can also use ( [ zgauge ] ) for a first assessment of the continuum limit .",
    "in particular it is interesting to study how well the field theoretical lattice definition of the topological charge ( [ topcharge ] ) can reproduce the expected @xmath80-periodicity of observables as a function of the vacuum angle @xmath0 .",
    "this is not a priori clear , since the definition ( [ topcharge ] ) does not guarantee an integer valued topological charge ",
    "this is expected only in the continuum limit .",
    "the continuum limit is approached via @xmath81 dimensional analysis yields @xmath82=l^2 $ ] which implies that the continuum limit ( [ contlimit ] ) corresponds to keeping a fixed physical volume .",
    "one expects that in the fixed - volume continuum limit observables become @xmath83-periodic in @xmath0 .",
    "we studied the @xmath0-dependence of various observables and as an example in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] we show the plaquette expectation value as a function of @xmath0 on a sequence of lattices that approach the continuum limit ( @xmath84 and @xmath85 at fixed @xmath86 ) .",
    "the results were obtained by evaluating @xmath87 for the pure gauge partition sum as given in ( [ zgauge ] ) .",
    "the tests documented in fig .  [ fig1 ] show that indeed @xmath80-periodicity is recovered and the field theoretical definition ( [ topcharge ] ) is well suited to study the continuum limit of the model with the topological term .",
    "before we come to the presentation of the results for the full model , let us discuss the monte carlo update strategy used for the dual representation . in the dual representation ( [ z_dual ] ) the dynamical degrees of freedom are the integer valued plaquette and matter flux variables , @xmath88 and @xmath89 . the dual variables @xmath90 and @xmath91 are not subject to any constraints and they can be updated independently in the usual way with a local monte carlo update scheme .",
    "more demanding are the variables @xmath45 and @xmath43 which have to obey the constraints of conserved @xmath51-flux at each site and a vanishing of the combined @xmath92- and @xmath51-flux at each link of the lattice .",
    "although it is possible to find a generalization of the worm strategy @xcite to abelian gauge - higgs models in arbitrary dimensions @xcite , for the 2-dimensional model studied here we use a simpler local update for the dual variables .",
    "the update strategy consists of two types of updates :    1 .   a _ local plaquette / link update _ : for a lattice site @xmath10 we randomly choose @xmath93 and propose to change @xmath94 @xmath95 the change is accepted with a metropolis step .",
    "a _ global winding gauge update _ : a @xmath93 is chosen randomly and we propose to change @xmath96 again the change is accepted with a metropolis step .    it is easy to see that these updates leave the constraints intact and that this procedure is ergodic . to be precise , the plaquette update alone is already ergodic , but mixing sweeps of the local plaquette / link update with global winding gauge updates considerably reduces the auto - correlation of observables related to the topological charge . for the results we show here , we typically use @xmath97 such combined sweeps for equilibration followed by @xmath98 measurements separated by 5 combined sweeps for decorrelation .",
    "the error bars we show are statistical errors determined with a jackknife analysis .",
    "the performance of the monte carlo updates ( [ mc1 ] ) , ( [ mc2 ] ) was studied for the 4-d case in great detail in @xcite , and qualitatively the performance behavior is the same in the 2-d case , which is , however , numerically considerably less demanding . as remarked , the update ( [ mc3 ] ) is not necessary for ergodicity , but helps for decorrelating topological quantities since it corresponds to changing the topological sector .",
    "thus the acceptance of this update depends exponentially on the volume , which is , however , not surprising , since the action for an additional charge is extensive for the 2-d u(1 ) case and the exponential volume - dependence is physical ( this is different for su(3 ) in 4-d ) .",
    "now we study the full model with matter fields . as a first consistency check we discuss a simulation at large @xmath25 ,",
    "i.e. , large mass , where the matter fields become static and the results are expected to approach the quenched results from the last section ( the quartic coupling @xmath26 is always set to @xmath99 in this subsection ) .",
    "figure [ fig2 ] shows the plaquette expectation value as a function of @xmath0 for @xmath100 , @xmath101 and @xmath102 .",
    "it is obvious that , as expected , the numerical data from the dual simulation are indeed in very good agreement with the curve obtained from explicitly summing the quenched partition function ( [ zgauge ] ) .     of the full model versus the vacuum angle @xmath0 .",
    "we show data for a large value of @xmath100 at @xmath103 @xmath102 .",

    "we consider the continuum limit for @xmath106 with @xmath107 fixed , and use @xmath108 , @xmath109 , @xmath110 and @xmath111 at fixed @xmath112 . in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] we show the results for the plaquette expectation value as a function of @xmath0 . as before in the quenched case also here",
    "we observe that , as we approach the continuum limit , the @xmath80-periodicity of the observable emerges as expected .",
    "it is remarkable that for this pure gauge observable the dependence on the mass parameter @xmath25 is only very weak and the behavior of the plaquette in the full theory is nearly the same as for the pure gauge case as long as we are in the symmetric phase .                            finally , in fig .  [ fig4 ]",
    "we study the expectation value of the topological charge density @xmath113 as a function of @xmath0 , again using the values @xmath104 , @xmath114 and @xmath111 and approaching the continuum limit with the sequence @xmath108 , @xmath109 , @xmath110 and @xmath111 at fixed @xmath112 . as before we observe the emergence of @xmath80-periodicity in the continuum limit .    here",
    "we remark that the topological charge density @xmath113 is a variable that is odd in @xmath0 , while the plaquette @xmath115 is an even function .",

    "also for the topological charge density @xmath113 we find that the results are essentially independent of the mass parameter @xmath25 .",
    "this indicates that the physics of the model related to the vacuum angle @xmath0 is dominated by the behavior of the gauge sector and the dynamics of the matter field plays only a sub - leading role as long as we are in the symmetric phase ( c.f .",

    "we find a quantitative dependence on the mass parameter but no qualitative one , i.e. , observables acquire a constant shift on top of which they show exactly the same periodic behavior as in the unbroken phase . a clear distinction between the higgs- and the symmetric phase appears for @xmath158 , where we identify a first order behavior of observables in the symmetric phase , which is absent in the higgs phase .    in @xcite",
