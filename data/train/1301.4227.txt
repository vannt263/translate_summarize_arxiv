    "it is well known that metallicity plays an important role in the evolution of massive stars .",
    "first , it affects directly the luminosity and effective temperature of massive stars ( e.g. , hurley , pols & tout 2000 ; tumlinson & shull 2000 ; baraffe , heger & woosley 2001 ; bromm , kudritzki & loeb 2001 ) .",
    "secondly , the metallicity has a strong effect on the mass - loss rate by stellar winds ( e.g. kudritzki , pauldrach & puls 1987 ; leitherer , robert & drissen 1992 ; maeder 1992 ; portinari , chiosi & bressan 1998 ; kudritzki & puls 2000 ; vink , de koter & lamers 2001 ; kudritzki 2002 ; belkus , van bever & vanbeveren 2007 ; pauldrach , vanbeveren & hoffmann 2012 ) .",
    "this may deeply affect the evolutionary path in the hr diagram up to the formation of the final remnant ( e.g. heger et al .",
    "2003a ; mapelli , colpi & zampieri 2009a ; belczynski et al .",
    "2010 , hereafter b10 ) .",
    "an interesting question is whether , and how much , the above effects can influence the overall evolution of star clusters ( scs ) .",
    "observations indicate that there is a trend with metallicity , at least for globular clusters ( gcs ) .",
    "in fact , blue ( i.e. generally metal - poor ) gcs in the milky way and in some nearby galaxies tend to have a larger half - light radius ( by @xmath4 per cent ) than red ( i.e. generally metal - rich ) gcs ( kundu & whitmore 1998 , 2001 ; kundu et al .",

    "no similar studies have been done for young scs ( @xmath5 myr ) and for open clusters .",
    "jordn ( 2004 ) explains the difference in the half - light radii of blue and red gcs as a result of mass segregation combined with the dependence of main sequence ( ms ) lifetime on metallicity , by means of multimass isotropic michie - king models .",
    "according to jordn ( 2004 ) , the observed difference in the half - light radii does not imply a difference in the half - mass radii .",
    "recent monte carlo ( downing 2012 ) and @xmath6-body ( sippel et al . 2012 ; see also hurley et al .",
    "2004 ) simulations of gcs confirm the results by jordn ( 2004 ) , finding that the difference in the half - light radii arises from the dependence of luminosity and stellar lifetime on metallicity . according to downing ( 2012 )",
    ", there may be even a difference in the half - mass radii , but only as a consequence of dynamical interactions , mainly due to the presence of massive stellar black holes ( bhs ) .",
    "finally , schulman , glebbeek & sills ( 2012 ) ran @xmath6-body simulations of young intermediate - mass ( @xmath7 m@xmath8 ) scs with different metallicities .",
    "they find a @xmath9 per cent difference also in the half - mass radius , between metal - poor scs and metal - rich scs .    in this paper",
    ", we discuss the results of @xmath6-body simulations of young intermediate - mass scs with different metallicity and different recipes for stellar winds and remnant formation .",
    "our aim is to investigate the core collapse and post - collapse evolution of young intermediate - mass scs , to better understand the interplay between dynamics , metallicity - dependent stellar evolution and formation of stellar remnants .",
    "the evaporation of stars from the core of a sc removes part of its kinetic energy ( spitzer 1987 ) .",
    "since a sc has negative heat capacity , this leads to gravothermal instability and to the collapse of the core ( binney & tremaine 1987 ) .",
    "core collapse in scs is reversed mostly by three - body encounters ( i.e. close encounters between stars and binaries ) .",
    "in fact , binaries have a energy reservoir ( their internal energy , e.g. binney & tremaine 1987 ) , which can be exchanged with single stars . in particular , hard binaries ( i.e. binaries with binding energy higher than the average kinetic energy of a star in the sc ) tend to transfer kinetic energy to single stars as a consequence of three - body encounters ( heggie 1975 ) . the stars that receive this kinetic energy are either ejected from the entire sc or remain in the periphery of the sc .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the more massive a binary is , the higher its expected encounter rate ( e.g. portegies zwart 2004 ) .",
    "thus , the most massive binaries in the sc tend to dominate the dynamical evolution of the system ( spitzer 1987 ; hurley 2007 ; aarseth 2012 ; hurley & shara 2012 ) .",
    "it has long been debated whether mass - loss by stellar winds and/or supernovae ( sne ) is efficient in affecting core collapse ( e.g. angeletti & giannone 1977 , 1980 ; applegate 1986 ; chernoff & shapiro 1987 ; chernoff & weinberg 1990 ; hurley et al . 2004 ; schulman et al .",
    "2012 ; downing 2012 ; sippel et al .",
    "in fact , stellar winds and sne eject mass from a sc , making the central potential well shallower and quenching the onset of gravothermal instability .",
    "scs with a broad mass - range initial mass function ( imf ) undergo core collapse on a timescale @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the half - mass relaxation timescale ( e.g. portegies zwart & mcmillan 2002 ) . for most gcs , @xmath12 gyr , whereas in young dense scs @xmath13 myr .",
    "this means that core collapse in gcs is expected to occur on a timescale ( much ) longer than the lifetime of massive ( @xmath14 m@xmath8 ) stars .",
    "thus , the stages of core collapse and post - core collapse are expected to be barely affected by sne and stellar winds . instead",
    ", the timescale for core collapse in young dense scs is expected to be of the same order of magnitude as the lifetime of massive stars . thus , mass - loss by stellar winds and sne peaks during the epochs of core collapse and post - core collapse .",
    "actually , mass - loss by stellar evolution is expected to delay the core collapse ( quenching the gravothermal instability ) and/or to reverse more rapidly the core collapse , depending on the interplay between core collapse timescale and massive star lifetime .",
    "two further ingredients of this scenario are the dependence of mass - loss on stellar metallicity and the formation of stellar remnants .",
    "stellar winds are suppressed at low metallicity ( e.g. kudritzki , pauldrach & puls 1987 ; maeder 1992 ; kudritzki & puls 2000 ; vink , de koter & lamers 2001 ) .",
    "thus , metal - rich scs are expected to lose more mass by stellar winds than metal - poor ones .",
    "massive stars that end their life with mass higher than @xmath15 m@xmath8 are expected to collapse directly into bhs , with no or faint sn explosion ( e.g. fryer 1999 ; fryer & kalogera 2001 ) .",
    "massive metal - poor stars lose less mass by stellar winds , and thus are more likely to collapse directly into bhs .",
    "this mechanism allows to form bhs with mass higher than 25 m@xmath2 ( e.g. mapelli et al .",
    "2009a ; b10 ) .",
    "if retained inside the sc , these bhs become the most massive objects in the sc after a few tens myr , dominating the energy budget of three - body encounters .",
    "the simulations were done using the starlabstarlab/ ] public software environment ( portegies zwart et al .",
    "2001 ; see also portegies zwart & verbunt 1996 ; nelemans et al . 2001 ; anders et al .",
    "2009 ) , which allows to integrate the dynamical evolution of a sc , resolving binaries and three - body encounters .",
    "in particular , we used the modified version of starlab described in mapelli et al .",
    "( 2013 , hereafter m13 ) .",
    "this version of starlab includes recipes for the metallicity dependence of stellar radius , temperature and luminosity , using the polynomial fitting formulae by hurley , pols & tout ( 2000 ) .",
    "it also includes new recipes for mass - loss by winds for ms stars , based on the metallicity - dependent fitting formulae given by vink et al .",
    "( 2001 ; see also b10 ) .",
    "we added an approximate treatment for luminous blue variable ( lbv ) and for wolf - rayet ( wr ) stars .",
    "in particular , we assume that a post - ms star becomes a lbv when its luminosity @xmath16 and radius @xmath17 satisfy the requirement that @xmath18 and @xmath19 ( humphreys & davidson 1994 ) .",
    "the mass - loss rate by stellar winds for a lbv is then calculated as @xmath20 m@xmath2 yr@xmath21 , where @xmath22 ( b10 ) .",
    "naked helium giants coming from stars with zero age ms ( zams ) mass @xmath23 m@xmath2 ( e.g. , van der hucht 1991 and references therein ) are labelled as wr stars in the new version of the code and undergo a mass - loss rate by stellar winds defined by @xmath24 m@xmath2 yr@xmath21 , where @xmath25 .",
    "this formula was first used by b10 , and is a combination of the hamann & koesterke ( 1998 ) wind rate estimate ( taking into account wr wind clumping ) and vink & de koter ( 2005 ) wind @xmath26-dependence for wr stars .",
    "stellar winds in asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) stars are modelled as in the standard version of starlab ( portegies zwart & verbunt 1996 ) , i.e. the code does not include any recipes for metallicity - dependent stellar winds in agb stars .",
    "the formation of stellar remnants is implemented as described in m13 . in particular , bh masses for various metallicities follow the distribution described in fig . 1 of m13 ( see also fryer et al .",
    "1999 ; fryer & kalogera 2001 ; b10 ; fryer et al . 2012 ) .",
    "if the final mass , of a star the mass bound to the star immediately before the collapse . ] of the progenitor star is @xmath27 m@xmath8 , we assume that the sn fails and that the star collapses quietly to a bh .",
    "the requirement that @xmath28 m@xmath8 implies that only stars with zams mass @xmath29 and @xmath30 m@xmath2 , can undergo a failed sn at @xmath1 and 0.1 z@xmath2 , respectively . if @xmath31 m@xmath2 , the mass of the bh is derived as @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is the final mass of the carbon oxygen ( co ) content of the progenitor , while @xmath34 and @xmath35 are the residual mass of helium ( he ) and of hydrogen ( h ) , respectively .",
    "@xmath36 is the fraction of he and h mass that collapses to the bh in the failed sn scenario .",
    "the value of @xmath36 is uncertain .",
    "we assume @xmath37 to match the maximum values of @xmath38 at low @xmath26 derived by b10 . in this scenario ,",
    "bhs with mass up to @xmath39 m@xmath8 ( @xmath40 m@xmath8 ) can form if the metallicity of the progenitor is @xmath41 z@xmath8 ( @xmath42 z@xmath8 ) .",
    "bhs that form from quiet collapse are assumed to receive no natal kick ( see fryer et al .",
    "2012 ) . for bhs that form from a sn explosion ,",
    "the natal kicks were drawn from the same distribution as neutron stars but scaled with the square root of the mass ( see m13 for details ) .",
    "we assume that the mass lost by stellar winds and sne is immediately removed from the simulation .",
    "this assumption is correct for sn ejecta and also for the winds of massive stars , which are expected to move fast ( @xmath43 km s@xmath21 for the o stars , e.g. muijres et al . 2012 ; @xmath44 km s@xmath21 for the wr stars , e.g. vink & de koter 2005 ; martins et al . 2008 ) with respect to the escape velocity of the simulated scs ( @xmath45 km s@xmath21 ) .",
    "stellar winds by agb stars have much smaller velocities ( @xmath46 km s@xmath21 , loup et al .",
    "1993 ) , but still sufficiently high to escape from our simulated scs .",
    "furthermore , we show in section  [ sec : result ] that agb stars do not play an important role for the results presented in this paper .",
    "the main properties of the simulated scs are the same as described in m13 .",
    "in particular , we focus on intermediate - mass ( @xmath47 m@xmath2 ) young ( @xmath5 myr ) scs .",

    "finally , our simulations do not include recipes for the tidal field of the host galaxy .",
    "accounting for the tidal field may increase the fraction of mass lost and even transform the scs into unbound associations ( e.g. gieles & portegies zwart 2011 ) .",
    "the effect of tidal fields will be added and discussed in forthcoming papers . in this paper",
    ", we decided not to include tidal fields because we want to look at the intrinsic properties of the simulated scs .",

    "these timescales are of the same order of magnitude as the lifetime of the most massive stars .",
    "the lifetime of a 30 m@xmath2 star is @xmath82 myr , and stellar winds are relatively inefficient for smaller stellar masses ( excluding the agb phase ) .",
    "thus , the most intense phase of mass - loss by stellar winds coincides with the collapse and re - expansion of the sc core : thus , the effects of stellar winds on the structural properties of the sc should be maximal in our simulations .    core - collapse sne span a longer time - range with respect to stellar winds . fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] shows that the rate of sne is maximum at @xmath83 myr , remains quite high up to @xmath84 myr , and drops at @xmath85 myr .",
    "the few sne at @xmath85 myr involve blue straggler stars ( bsss ) , which are the result of either mass transfer or a merger between two ms stars ( e.g. mapelli et al .",
    "2004 , 2006 , 2009b ) . for @xmath86 , the number of sn explosions involving bsss is @xmath87 per sc ( regardless of the metallicity ) , corresponding to a mass - loss of @xmath88 m@xmath2 per sc .",
    "since the total mass - loss in the time interval between 50 and 100 myr is @xmath89 per cent of the initial total mass of the sc ( @xmath90 ) , i.e. @xmath91 m@xmath2 per sc , the mass lost through sn explosions of bsss is negligible .",
    "thus , after @xmath92 myr , the evolution of the core is dominated by three - body interactions and stellar winds of agb stars .    for comparison ,",
    "most gcs have half - mass relaxation timescales and core collapse timescales that are a factor of @xmath93 longer ( e.g. portegies zwart 2004 ; portegies zwart , mcmillan & gieles 2010 ) , indicating that the peak of stellar wind activity and that of sn explosions ended well before the beginning of the core instability phase .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] shows the cumulative mass lost by the sc ( because of both stellar winds and sne ) , as a function of time , for runs a1 , b and c. the effect of different metallicities is maximum between 1 and 4 myr , when the mass lost at @xmath94 z@xmath8 is up to 100 and 10 times higher than the mass lost at @xmath1 z@xmath8 and @xmath95 z@xmath8 , respectively .",
    "the mass lost in these early phases of the sc life is a relatively small fraction ( @xmath96 ) of the total sc mass , but is large when compared to the core mass ( which is @xmath97 ) . as the most massive stars already sank to the core through dynamical friction by the time of core collapse ,",
    "the effect of early mass - loss is particularly strong in the sc core .",
    "for example , at @xmath98 myr the mass - loss is @xmath99 per cent of the core mass at @xmath94 z@xmath2 , and only @xmath100 per cent at @xmath1 z@xmath2 .",

    "[ fig : fig3 ] appears immediately after the collapse , during the first phase of re - expansion : the core radius in metal - rich scs expands more than in metal - poor scs , as mass - loss by stellar winds in metal - rich scs removes more matter from the core potential well . at @xmath102 myr ,",
    "the mass - loss by stellar winds is nearly over , but the differences among core radii at different metallicity remain almost constant up to @xmath103 myr .",
    "the contribution of sn explosions lasts for a longer time ( @xmath104 myr , fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] ) . in our models ,",
    "the mass - loss by sn explosions does not depend on metallicity .",
    "the only important effect of metallicity on sne is that failed sne can take place only at low metallicity ( @xmath105 z@xmath2 ) .",

    "[ fig : fig1 ] ) , as only the most massive stars ( see section  [ sec : method ] ) can undergo a failed sn .",
    "thus , the occurrence of failed sne in low - metallicity scs enhances the difference between metal - rich and metal - poor scs , in the early phase of core - collapse reversal .    at times @xmath85 myr , even the mass - loss by sne is over : the only process that may affect significantly the later evolution of the core radius is represented by three - body encounters .",
    "the differences between metal - rich and metal - poor scs tend to be quenched at late times .",
    "the half - mass radius @xmath107 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fig4 ] ) remains almost constant during core collapse ( as expected , e.g. elson , hut & inagaki 1987 ) , while it starts increasing after the reverse of the core collapse .",
    "the behaviour of @xmath107 ( @xmath108 ) is in agreement with simple analytical predictions ( e.g. elson et al .",
    "the post - core collapse value of @xmath107 for metal - poor scs is systematically larger than that for metal - rich scs , in agreement with schulman et al .",
    "the reason is that the reversal of core - collapse is slower for metal - poor scs .",
    "this implies that metal - poor scs maintain a higher core density in the late core - collapse phase and in the early core - collapse reversal ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : fig5 ] for the evolution of core stellar density . ] ) .",
    "since the rate of three - body encounters scales approximately with the stellar mass density ( e.g. sigurdsson & phinney 1993 ) , metal - poor scs have a higher rate of three - body encounters than metal - rich scs .",
    "three - body encounters pump kinetic energy in the sc halo ( mainly in the form of stars ejected in the outskirts of the sc ) , and are responsible for the expansion of @xmath107 ( e.g. , elson et al .",
    "1987 ) .",
    "the difference at @xmath109 myr between the averaged @xmath107 of @xmath1 z@xmath8 scs and that of @xmath94 z@xmath8 scs is @xmath3 per cent , surprisingly similar to the difference observed between red and blue gcs . on the other hand ,",
    "we stress that the evolution of our simulated young scs is very different from the evolution of gcs .",
    "[ fig : fig6 ] shows that the difference among the half - light radii at different metallicity is larger ( @xmath110 per cent , although with larger fluctuations ) than the difference among the half - mass radii .",
    "this results from the combination between mass segregation , and the metallicity dependence of the adopted stellar luminosity function . in our simulated scs , mass segregation is very efficient , as shown by the fact that the core collapse occurs on a timescale shorter than the half - mass relaxation timescale ( i.e. , it is driven by dynamical friction , e.g. portegies zwart 2004 ) .",
    "thus , the region inside the core radius is dominated by massive stars and remnants , while most low - mass stars are in the outer regions .    according to the fitting formulae by hurley et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , a solar metallicity ms star with mass @xmath111 m@xmath2 is fainter than a sub - solar metallicity ms star with the same mass .",
    "this is apparent from fig .",
    "[ fig : fig7 ] , where we compare the zams luminosity ( @xmath112 ) for stars with different metallicity .",
    "a similar difference persists during the entire ms . because of this difference in the luminosity function , and",
    "because our simulated scs are mass - segregated , the light distribution tends to be more concentrated in metal - rich scs than in metal - poor scs .      in this section",
    ", we estimate the impact on core collapse and post - core collapse phases of other effects connected with stellar evolution , including stellar remnants . to maximize the contribution of bhs to the reverse of core collapse , we consider scs with @xmath113z@xmath2 , where the bh mass can be as high as @xmath39 m@xmath8 .",
    "the comparison between runs a1 ( with @xmath61 ) and a2 ( with @xmath76 ) shows that the existence of primordial binaries has almost no effect on both the core radius ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fig8 ] ) and the half - mass radius ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fig9 ] ) .",
    "in fact , the very hard binaries needed to reverse the core collapse form by 3-body capture during the collapse phase even in the @xmath76 runs .    the difference between runs a1 and a3 is the maximum mass of bhs : 80 and 25 m@xmath2 for runs a1 and a3 , respectively .",
    "this difference was achieved by ejecting impulsively a large fraction of the stellar mass at the time of bh formation in runs a3 .",
    "thus , the core radius in runs a3 increases much faster than that in runs a1 because of this sudden mass - loss ( fig  [ fig : fig8 ] ) . on the other hand",
    ", the half - mass radius ( fig  [ fig : fig9 ] ) increases initially faster in runs a3 than in runs a1 , but then slows down , because of the lower core density and because of the absence of massive bhs .",
    "in fact , massive bh binaries have a larger cross - section for three - body encounters , have ( on average ) a larger reservoir of internal energy and , thus , are more efficient in ejecting stars after three - body encounters ( e.g. downing 2012 ) .",
    "a similar but stronger trend can be observed by comparing runs a1 and a4 . in runs a4 all bhs",
    "are removed from the simulation at birth , by assigning to them a natal kick of @xmath114 km s@xmath21 . immediately after core collapse , the core radius ( fig  [ fig : fig8 ] ) and the half - mass radius ( fig  [ fig : fig9 ] ) in runs a4 become significantly larger than in runs a1 . in fact",
    ", the mass of all the bhs is completely lost from the potential well of the sc . on the other hand",
    ", the removal of all the bhs implies that less energy can be exchanged via three - body encounters .",
    "for this reason , the increase of the half - mass radius slows down at @xmath109 myr .",
    "finally , runs a5 represent the most extreme case , where mass - loss by stellar winds is switched off and the maximum bh mass is @xmath115 m@xmath2 ( the only difference between the bh mass and the zams mass of the progenitor star comes from the recipes for the direct collapse of the star into a bh , see section  [ sec : method ] ) .",
    "if mass - loss is switched off , the core collapse is much more dramatic : it lasts for @xmath14 myr before that three - body encounters can reverse it ( fig  [ fig : fig8 ] ) .",
    "the half - mass radius ( fig  [ fig : fig9 ] ) expands dramatically after core collapse , because of the amount of energy pumped into the halo by three - body encounters .",
    "in this paper , we discussed the effects of metallicity on the core collapse and post - core collapse phase in young intermediate - mass scs .",
    "this was done by means of @xmath6-body simulations including recipes for metallicity - dependent stellar evolution , stellar winds and formation of stellar remnants .    in the simulated scs ,",
    "core collapse is almost coincident with the peak of mass - loss by stellar winds .",
    "metal - rich scs lose more mass by stellar winds than metal - poor scs : the reversal of core collapse is faster and stronger in the former with respect to the latter . on the other hand , the difference in the core radius among metal - rich and metal - poor scs decreases as soon as mass losses by massive stars are over . in the later stages of sc life , the core evolution is ruled mainly by three - body encounters .",
    "since the reversal of core collapse is slower in metal - poor scs , the half - mass radius expands more in metal - poor scs than in metal - rich scs .",
    "the maximum difference among the half - mass radii of @xmath1 and @xmath94 z@xmath8 scs is @xmath3 per cent .",
    "when considering the half - light radii rather than the half - mass radii , the difference at late times is larger ( @xmath110 per cent ) .",
    "this is a consequence of the metallicity dependence of the adopted stellar luminosity function .",
    "we also checked the effects of other aspects of stellar evolution .",
    "when stellar winds are completely suppressed , the core collapse phase lasts much longer and the half - mass radius in the post - core collapse phase can be even 20 per cent larger than in the fiducial model for the same metallicity .",
    "if all the bhs are ejected by natal kick , the core initially expands faster because of the impulsive mass - loss , but all the massive binaries are lost from the sc , quenching the effects of three - body encounters .    in the last few years , young scs were at the centre of important observational campaigns ( e.g. bica et al .",
