    "smooth particle applied mechanics  spam  was discovered about thirty years ago@xcite .",
    "it has become a useful tool in simulating gases , fluids , and solids , and holds particular promise for problems involving large high - speed deformation and failure .",
    "the main advantage of the method is simplicity .",
    "spam closely resembles atomistic molecular dynamics and , in a variety of cases@xcite , the spam particle trajectories are isomorphic to those of molecular dynamics .",
    "a smooth - particle code is less - complicated than typical grid - based continuum codes because the smooth - particle method evaluates spatial gradients in a particularly simple way , explained in more detail below .",
    "the main disadvantages of the method are instability in tension@xcite and the lack of surface tension@xcite .",
    "the present work introduces an idea  density - gradient potentials  designed to address those problems .",
    "the basic smooth - particle approach is to represent all continuum properties ( the density @xmath2 , the velocity @xmath3 , the stress tensor @xmath4 , ... ) as interpolated sums of particle properties , where the particles are described by `` weight functions '' , expressing the range of influence of the particles in space .",
    "simplest _ weight function satisfying five desirable conditions(i ) normalization , ( ii ) finite range @xmath5 , ( iii ) a maximum at the origin , and ( iv and v ) two continuous derivatives everywhere  is lucy s .",
    "normalized for applications in two - dimensional space lucy s weight function is as follows : @xmath6\\ ] ] @xmath7 the density at any point @xmath8 is defined as the sum of all the particle contributions at that point : @xmath9 so that the density associated with particle @xmath10 is @xmath11 other continuum properties at location @xmath8 are likewise calculated as sums over nearby particles : @xmath12 @xmath13/\\rho ( r ) = \\ ] ] @xmath14 it is important to note that the interpolated function @xmath15 at the location of particle @xmath16 is typically different to the particle property @xmath17 at that point .    beyond using the point properties @xmath18 to define the field properties @xmath15 this approach has the crucial advantage that _ gradients _ of the field properties translate into simple sums of particle quantities : @xmath19 @xmath20 = \\sum _ j m_jf_j\\nabla _ rw(|r - r_j| ) \\ .\\ ] ]",
    "expressions for the gradients of density , velocity , stress , and energy make it possible to express the _ partial _ differential equations of continuum mechanics as _ ordinary _ differential equations for the evolution of the particle coordinates , velocities , stresses , and energies@xcite .",

    "where the pressure is hydrostatic , and slowly varying in space , it is noteworthy that the smooth - particle equations of motion are exactly the same as the equations of molecular dynamics , with the weight function @xmath23 playing the rle of a pair potential . in the simple case that the internal energy depends only on volume ( and not on temperature ) the pressure is simply related to the internal energy per unit mass @xmath24 : @xmath25 specifying the density dependence of either the pressure or the internal energy , in such a case , corresponds to giving a full description of the equilibrium equation of state .",
    "the evolving time - and - space dependent smooth - particle sums converge to continuum mechanics as a many - particle limit , just as do the more usual grid - based approximations .",
    "the range of the smooth - particle weight function , @xmath5 , corresponds to a few grid spacings . in practice , for an error level of order one percent",
    ", the weight - function sums must include a few dozen particles .",
    "1 shows the dependence of density sums , @xmath26 on the range of the weight function for three regular two - dimensional lattices . in typical applications , with @xmath27 the density errors are of order one percent .",
    "the density curves in the figure correspond to an actual density of unity .",
    "the many crossings of the curves suggest that energetic flows of highly inhomogeneous fluids would exhibit a complex structure without any definite lattice structure while very slow flows might `` freeze '' into a least - energy crystalline form .",
    "simulations of the rayleigh - bnard problem ( convection driven by a temperature gradient in the presence of gravity ) support this surmise@xcite .",
    "low - energy , high - pressure simulations can actually `` freeze '' , with the smooth particles forming a locked lattice structure rather than flowing . for fluids",
    "this freezing behavior is undesirable . in the next section",
    "we consider the stress - free mechanical stability of the three simplest two - dimensional lattice structures .",
    "when discrete particles are involved there can be difficulties in representing the smooth and continuous nature of fluid flows . by analogy with atomistic molecular dynamics , one would expect that regular lattice arrangements of particles would resist shear . in the atomistic case in two space dimensions",
    "the shear modulus @xmath28 is of the same order as the one - particle hookes - law force constant evaluated from the einstein model : @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the displacement of a single test particle , particle 1 , from its lattice site , with all the other particles fixed . for a sufficiently simple density - dependent potential we can estimate the one - particle force constant @xmath31 analytically .",
    "let us illustrate for the simplest possible density potential , @xmath32 ^ 2 \\ ; \\ \\rho _ j = \\sum _ i m_iw_{ij } \\ , \\ ] ] where @xmath33 is the total potential energy of the system , @xmath34 is the target density minimizing that energy , and all the particle masses are set equal to unity , @xmath35 .",
    "the first derivative , @xmath36 vanishes for @xmath37 the second derivative can be estimated by replacing the particle sum with an integral : @xmath38 fig .",
    "2 shows that this analytic result closely resembles the detailed lattice sums for all three regular two - dimensional lattices .     with the approximate integrated estimate as a function of the range @xmath5 of lucy s weight function .",
    "the top - to - bottom ordering of the curves is [ integrated @xmath39 triangular @xmath39 square @xmath39 hexagonal ] . ]",
    "nevertheless , our detailed investigation of this particular choice of fluid model , @xmath40 revealed that this expectation of a shear strength varying as @xmath41 is unfounded . instead",
    ", regular lattices , with a stress - free , density - based potential corresponding to an athermal fluid constitutive relation , show no shear resistance whatever !",
    "numerical investigation shows that the square , triangular , and hexagonal lattices , arranged _ at _ the target density @xmath34 , are _ all _ unstable to small displacements .",
    "this can be shown by using lattice dynamics , elastic theory , or molecular dynamics . in every case",
    "the regular lattices are unstable to a variety of shear modes .",
    "the perfect - crystal elastic constants@xcite for this potential can be calculated by two chain - rule differentiations of the potential @xmath42 with respect to the elastic strains : @xmath43 @xmath44 here @xmath45 represents an infinitesimal displacement from the perfect - lattice configuration .",

    "the nonvanishing elastic constant @xmath53 is exactly half the bulk modulus @xmath54 .",
    "the range - dependence @xmath55 is shown in fig . 3 for all three lattice structures .     with the range of the weight function @xmath5 for three two - dimensional lattices .",
    "the top - to - bottom ordering of the curves at @xmath56 is [ hexagonal @xmath39 square @xmath39 triangular ] . ]",
    "the results of the preceding section show that the smooth - particle fluid model ( correctly ) is able to flow under an infinitesimal shear stress . for _",
    "solids _ shear resistance is required .",
    "a simple potential supporting shear strength minimizes the gradient of the density : @xmath57 this potential is minimized for regular lattices , in which there can ( by symmetry ) be no density gradient _ at _ the particle sites . for systems with free surfaces  the details are not considered here , but are elaborated in a forthcoming book@xcite  this potential also provides a surface tension , eliminating the tendency of smooth particles to form string - like phases . figs . 4 and 5",
    "illustrate the stability of the hexagonal lattice in the absence , and in the presence , respectively of the density - gradient potential . in the one example detailed here ( which is typical of many we have investigated , with various sizes , initial conditions , and crystal structures ) the individual particle trajectories with and without the density - gradient potential",
    "are shown .",
    "evidently , by choosing the proportionality constants wisely , these potentials can be tuned to reproduce desired flow stresses for solids modelled with spam .",
    "this approach avoids many of the difficulties involved in integrating the smooth - particle equations for the stress rates , ( @xmath58 ) .",
    "the range of lucy s weight function is @xmath59 with the density and the particle mass both chosen equal to unity .",
