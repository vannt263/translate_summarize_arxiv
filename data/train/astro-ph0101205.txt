    "the cmb anisotropy provides direct information of the oldest relics of large - scale structures left from the big - bang .",
    "these cmb photons generally contain two kinds of information at every frequency band , the intensity and the polarization .",
    "though the cmb photons are originated at the last scattering surface near red - shift @xmath6 , they can be re - processed along the light paths before reaching us , notably by the gravitational and doppler effects .",
    "these effects dominantly affect the photon intensity , or the temperature anisotropy ; they can also affect the photon polarization , but only to a much lesser degree .",
    "thus , unlike the temperature anisotropy , it is believed that the cmb polarization is a sensitive probe to the universe at a specific epoch when the photon temperature is about @xmath7 degrees and the photon optical depth @xmath8 about @xmath9 .",
    "the cmb polarization is generated at this optical depth through the thomson scattering of the pre - existing temperature anisotropy by a background of homogeneous free electrons@xcite .",
    "different normal modes in the primordial fluctuations yield different characteristics in the temperature anisotropy , thereby yielding different types of polarization patterns .",
    "it has been pointed out that these different polarization patterns can be divided into two classes : the electric - type ( @xmath1 ) pattern and the magnetic - type ( @xmath0 ) pattern@xcite .",
    "the primordial density perturbations ( scalar modes ) generate only the @xmath1 pattern , but the @xmath0 pattern can only be generated by the primordial gravitational waves ( tensor modes ) and vortex motion ( vector modes ) . since",
    "different patterns were originated from different physics , the ability to separate the @xmath1 and @xmath0 patterns cleanly has become a measure of success for cmb polarization experiments in a forseeable future .",
    "following the conventional approach to temperature anisotropy , most past works that addressed the cmb polarization tended to focus on how the two kinds of polarization patterns may be separated in the fourier domain .",
    "such an approach is natural for the wide - sky maps , such as those planned for the map and planck missions .",
    "however , for the ground - based and ballon - borne experiments , the wide - sky maps are impossible to obtain , and the adopted strategy is often deep exposure of a small - patch of sky@xcite . unlike the wide - sky map , the local maps can not naturally satisfy the periodic boundary conditions , and hence a brute - force fourier analysis to extract the power spectrum can often introduce distortion to the original data and produces un - desirable effects .",
    "the problem is particularly acute for the @xmath0-mode measurement due to the small @xmath0-mode signals .",
    "for this reason , the real - space analysis of local maps has been called for@xcite .    in the past years",
    ", an alternative approach has also been examined in an attempt to alleviating the problem of boundary conditions@xcite . when the measurements are taken along a ring on the sky",
    ", the data will automatically satisfy the periodic boundary condition with discete wavenumbers . as the ring diameter can be over tens of degrees , the large sky coverage of the ring permits one to extract a wide spectrum of discrete modes from the measurement . though this approach solves the problem of boundary conditions",
    ", the separation of @xmath0 and @xmath1 modes is still not natural , as it requires precise short - term calibration of detectors within the individual ring@xcite and long - term calibration across different rings@xcite in order to extract the appropriate stokes @xmath10 and @xmath11 to construct @xmath1 and @xmath0 modes .",
    "recently , it has been proposed that with a suitable projection of the real - space data , one is able to separate the @xmath1 and @xmath0 patterns directly from the local map without resorting to the fourier analysis@xcite .",
    "they also illustrate what the visual appearances of the unfamiliar @xmath1 and @xmath0 tensor patterns are in the projected vector space . in these previous works ,",
    "the polarization tensor is first projected into a vector and a pseudo - vector field through differentiation of the measured data , and these vector fields are further projected into a scalar and a pseudo - scalar through a contour integration of _ arbitrary _ shape .",
    "the scalar component results from the @xmath1 mode and the pseudo - scalar from the @xmath0 mode .    though illuminating , this proposed projection , however , suffers from a differential operation on the data for projecting the polarization tensors into vectors , which invariably amplifies the measurement noises . despite that the differentiation is followed by a contour integration to construct the projected @xmath1 and @xmath0 scalars , which damps out the amplified noises , the noise damping can hardly compensate for the noise amplification .",
    "hence it is desirable to pursue a different method that can also cleanly separate the @xmath0 and @xmath1 patterns in the real space .",
    "a tensor ( vector ) can be projected into a vector ( scalar ) through a vector operation , which can either be a projection - derivative or a projection - integration along a given contour .",
    "both have been used in our previous proposal@xcite . as the differentiation amplifies the data noise ,",
    "the former is ruled out .",
    "for the latter , various projection integrations are available . as will be shown in this paper , the only viable ones , useful for separating the pseudo - tensor patterns from the tensor pattern are those that assume circular integration contours .",
    "it has been pointed out that circular - scan observations allow the @xmath1 and @xmath0 modes to be separated@xcite .",
    "the present work reinforces this observation and shows that the scanning observation along circles is indeed the only one strategy that permits the @xmath0 and @xmath1 modes to be cleanly separated without involving data differencing .",
    "this result is particularly relevant for the scanning observations conventionally conducted by , for example , balloon - borne and ground - based experiments . the recommended circular scanning observation is nothing but integration of data along a given sky circle over a long period of time without distinguishing variations on the circle .",
    "this is to be contrasted to integration along a sky contour of arbitrary shape proposed by @xcite , and contrasted to extraction of discrete modes on a sky circle analyzed by @xcite .",
    "in fact , to achieve the goal of separating @xmath1 and @xmath0 modes , it is also necessary that the polarimeter axis of the detector also rotates as the telescope sweeps along the sky circle .",
    "be precise , the polarimeter axis must always orients toward a fixed direction with respect to the local radial direction of the sky circle .",
    "the amiba telescope can have this capability@xcite .",
    "we will assess how amiba is expected to perform using this observational strategy .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "sec.(2 ) gives the formulation , with which the constraint on the shape of the integration contour is derived .",
    "the implications for the projection integrals with circular contours are examined in sec.(3 ) .",
    "sec.(4 ) addresses the measurement of the @xmath1 modes using this method .",
    "sec.(5 ) discusses the measurement strategy for the much weaker @xmath0 modes .",
    "correlation of @xmath1-mode polarization with temperature anisotropy is addressed in sec.(6 ) . in sec.(7 ) , we study how a finite beam width can affect the sharp - beam cases considered in the previous sections , and show that the ability of the circular - scan strategy for separating @xmath0 modes from @xmath1 modes can be much improved via a finite - size beam .",
    "discussions on the amiba performance are given in sec.(8 ) .",
    "conclusions are given in sec.(9 ) .",
    "throughout this paper , we adopt the flat - sky approximation since the cmb fluctuations of interest are at most few degrees in size .",
    "the polarization tensor @xmath12 can be expressed as@xcite @xmath13 f + [ \\nabla(\\hat z\\times\\nabla)+(\\hat z\\times\\nabla)\\nabla ] g \\nonumber\\\\ & & = q+iu=4\\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial\\bar w^2}(f+ig)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the `` 3 '' and `` 1 '' components of the pauli matrices , respectively , and @xmath16 and @xmath17 are real functions denoting the @xmath1 and @xmath0 components , respectively . moreover , from the third equality on , we have used a complex representation for @xmath12 , where @xmath18 and @xmath19 . a convenient way to construct a scalar from @xmath12 proceeds as follows .",
    "pick a closed contour @xmath20 on the polarization field , contract the tensor @xmath12 with a suitable local tensor to form a scalar / pseudo - scalar at every point on the contour , and then sum up these scalar quantities over the contour to obtain a contour - integrated value .",
    "mathematically , the operation can be written as @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the local tensor for projecting out the scalar @xmath23 , @xmath20 is the closed contour along which the line integration is performed , and the coordinate @xmath24 can be chosen so that the origin is inside the contour . in terms of the stokes @xmath10 and @xmath11 , eq.(2 ) is @xmath25-i\\int_c[(yq - xu)dx+(xq+yu)dy].\\ ] ]    considering the fact that @xmath26 can be expressed as a total derivative , equal to @xmath27/\\partial\\bar w$ ] , and that @xmath16 and @xmath17 are both analytical functions , we arrive at the following expression for @xmath23 of eq.(2 ) , @xmath28,\\ ] ] where @xmath29 . using the stokes theorem and the fact that @xmath30 , eq.(4 ) can further be rewritten as @xmath31 where the surface integration is confined within the area bounded by the contour @xmath20 .",
    "instead of placing an integration limit for the surface integral , we may multiply the integrand of eq.(5 ) by a top - hat filter function @xmath32 and carry out the surface integral without an explicit bound , where @xmath33 inside the contour @xmath20 and @xmath34 otherwise .",
    "this permits a convenient way to evaluate the second equality of eq.(5 ) .",
    "note that @xmath35 in the polar coordinate . with an integration by part , eq.(5 ) becomes @xmath36 \\nabla^2(f+ig ) rdr d\\phi.\\ ] ] note that @xmath37 is a real quantity , and both real and imaginary parts of @xmath23 generally contain a mixture of the real @xmath1-mode @xmath16 and real @xmath0-mode @xmath17 .",
    "however , at some special arrangements , @xmath1 and @xmath0 modes can become separated , with @xmath17 contributing only to the real part and @xmath16 only to the imaginary part , or the opposite .",
    "these situations only happen when @xmath38 depends either on @xmath39 or on @xmath40 , but not on both .",
    "the choice of depending only on @xmath40 can be ruled out since such a window function is not compact .",
    "thus , the one and only one choice for the contour must be such that @xmath41 , and moreover @xmath42 , a circular top - hat filter function of radius @xmath43 .",
    "that is , the only scanning trajectory that is capable of projecting out the desired scalar and pseudo - scalar is when it is a circle .",
    "the circular scan yields the real part of @xmath23 to be entirely contributed by the @xmath0 mode and the imaginary part of @xmath23 by the @xmath1 mode .",
    "it also leaves @xmath23 to depend on a single parameter , i.e. , the radius @xmath43 of the circle .",
    "the above derivation also proves that a special case of circular - scan observations analyzed by zaldarriaga @xcite is indeed a unique one .",
    "we now examine what quantities of the polarization tensor @xmath12 are to be extracted from the projection integration along a circle .",
    "it will also be shown that the projection of @xmath12 defined in eq.(2 ) corresponds to physical rotation of the polarimeter axes , so that they remain fixed with respect to the local radial direction along the circle .",
    "let the circular contour of radius @xmath43 center at @xmath44 , so that @xmath45 .",
    "it then follows from eqs.(3 ) that @xmath46d\\phi\\nonumber\\\\ & & = -ir^2\\int_0^{2\\pi } [ r\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r}(\\frac{1}{r}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r } ) -\\frac{1}{r^2}\\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial\\phi^2 } + \\frac{2i}{r}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial\\phi } ( \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r}-\\frac{1}{2r})](f+ig ) d\\phi\\nonumber\\\\ & & = i\\int_0^{2\\pi}\\int_0^\\infty \\bar w(r ) \\nabla^2(f({\\bf x})+ig({\\bf x } ) ) rdr d\\phi , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the second equality can be straightforwardly derived from eq.(2 ) and the third equality is simply eq.(6 ) with a filter function @xmath47 .",
    "similar expressions for eq.(7 ) have also been derived before@xcite based on a related idea in weak lensing studies@xcite .",
    "the angular factors on the right of the first equality in eq.(7 ) are the familiar ones .",
    "it describes how @xmath10 and @xmath11 rotate as the second - rank tensor components when the coordinate rotates .",
    "in fact , these angular factors mean that the polarization tensor @xmath48 must be rotated to @xmath49 of a preferred coordinate @xmath50 , where the @xmath51-direction is along the local radial direction of the sky circle and the @xmath52-direction along the local azimuthal direction .",
    "this point is central to the present work , in that not only the scanning trajectory should be a circle , but the polarimeter axes of the telescope must rotate as well .",
    "the separation of @xmath1 and @xmath0 modes depends critically on a perfect angular integration and perfect polarimeter - axis alignment .",
    "the quantity @xmath23 thus measures the angular average of @xmath53 of the @xmath1 mode and @xmath54 of the @xmath0 mode .",
    "it turns out that these unfamiliar derivatives of @xmath16 and @xmath17 have the same power spectra as those of @xmath55 and @xmath56 , respectively .",
    "the respective power spectra for @xmath55 and @xmath56 are @xmath57 and @xmath58 , where @xmath59 and @xmath60 are the fourier components of @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "each power spectrum equals the corresponding power spectrum of the polarization tensor : @xmath61 where @xmath62 and @xmath63 are the @xmath1 and @xmath0 contributions to the fourier components of @xmath64 and @xmath65 , respectively , and @xmath66 can be either @xmath16 or @xmath17 .",
    "equation ( 8) is very useful since the measured quantity @xmath67 can be related to the @xmath1 and @xmath0 mode amplitudes directly .",
    "in fact , @xmath55 and @xmath56 are the topological charge and pseudo - charge in the polarization tensor field @xmath12@xcite .",
    "moreover , @xmath68 is a random variable since the circle may be centered at any arbitrary origins @xmath44 .",
    "the variance of @xmath67 can thus be expressed as : @xmath69^{1/2},\\ ] ] where @xmath70 is the fourier component of @xmath71 , @xmath72 stands for the ensemble average of various @xmath44 , and @xmath73 for the area over which the @xmath44 surface average is conducted . here , @xmath74 denotes the measured variance of the polarization brightness temperature for mode @xmath75 , and the factor @xmath76 in eq.(9 ) arises from the product of two factors : a factor @xmath43 , which has been multiplied to the data to construct @xmath23 in eq.(2 ) , and the circumference @xmath77 of the sky circle for the contour integration .",
    "the two factors need to be divided away to obtain the sky surface brightness @xmath74 .",
    "the measured @xmath78 contains the polarization spectral information of either mode , subject only to the smearing by a @xmath79-space filter @xmath80 .",
    "the length scale of smearing depends on the radius @xmath43 , but the details of smearing depend on the power spectrum of the filter function @xmath80 .    finally , we wish to stress that the separation of @xmath1 and @xmath0-modes can , in principle , be achieved with a single - polarization detector . this is because the polarization axis is always rotated to the appropriate direction at every point of the sky circle . on may , for example ,",
    "align the polarimeter axis to the local radial direction to pick up @xmath81 and integrate @xmath82 over a rotation , and then rotate the axis by @xmath83 to integrate @xmath84 over another rotation .",
    "the @xmath1 mode signal is simply @xmath85 . for @xmath0-mode measurements ,",
    "one may orient the polarization axis to either @xmath86 or @xmath87 off the local radial direction , and the @xmath0-mode signal is @xmath88 .",
    "however , detection of the much weaker @xmath0 modes with single - polarization detectors may , in practice , suffer from inaccurate calibration of the two measurements to be subtracted from each other .",
    "since @xmath71 consists of a top - hat disk and a thin shell , its power spectrum oscillates in the @xmath79 space at a particular phase with a well - defined frequency comparable to @xmath89 , the gibb s phenomenon , and the oscillation amplitude declines as @xmath90 . at the first glance , it appears that such a @xmath79-space filter is too extended to be useful .",
    "however , this disadvantage may be turned into an advantage for the polarization measurement .",
    "the power spectrum of @xmath1 mode also oscillates in the @xmath79 space with well - defined frequency and phase .",
    "this allows for the possibility that one may adjust the scan radius @xmath43 to control the oscillation frequency in the power spectrum of @xmath71 so as to optimize the detection of @xmath1-mode signals .",
    "one would like to match the frequencies of the two oscillations to maximize the overlap of @xmath80 and @xmath91 in eq.(9 ) .",
    "however , this does not necessarily produce the maximal power since the two oscillations may be out of phase , giving destructive interference .",
    "the phase of the @xmath79-space oscillation in the @xmath1-mode power spectrum is such that it always oscillates asymptotically as @xmath92 for @xmath93 , where @xmath94 is the oscillation period ; this behavior is rather insensitive to the cosmological parameters , such as @xmath95 and @xmath96 .",
    "most power of @xmath97 in the @xmath1-mode is contained in between @xmath98 and @xmath99 .",
    "it will turn out that @xmath80 has an optimal phase such that it also oscillates as @xmath100 . by adjusting the scan radius @xmath43 so that @xmath101",
    ", we can obtain an optimal overlap of @xmath80 and @xmath91 , whereby considerable power of the @xmath1 polarization is captured .",
    "we now turn to show that @xmath102 at a large @xmath103 .",
    "the two dimensional fourier transformation of @xmath71 is @xmath104 e^{ik r \\cos(\\phi-\\phi_k ) } d^2{\\bf r}\\nonumber\\\\ & & = \\int_0^\\infty rdr [ 2\\theta(r - r)-r\\delta(r - r ) ]",

    "the two can be combined to become @xmath105 . for @xmath106 ,",
    "@xmath107 oscillates as @xmath108 .",
    "thus , @xmath109 asymptotically oscillates at a frequency @xmath89 as @xmath110 .    to illustrate how the filter function @xmath70 captures the oscillating @xmath1 mode power spectrum , we show @xmath80 for three suitably chosen @xmath43 s in fig.(1a ) , ( 1b ) and ( 1c ) , and compare them with the @xmath1-mode power spectra of the @xmath111cdm model with @xmath112 , @xmath113 and @xmath114 , the standard flat cdm model with @xmath114 , and the open cdm model with @xmath113 and @xmath114 respectively . instead of using @xmath79 ,",
    "we have used the conventional spherical - harmonics mode number @xmath115 as the horizontal axis .",
    "identify @xmath116 to be the angle on a flat sky , and the relation @xmath117 for a large @xmath115 follows .",
    "moreover , the conventional power spectrum in the spherical harmonic space @xmath118 is replaced by @xmath119 in eq.(9 ) . also shown in fig.(1 ) is another @xmath80 for a different choice of @xmath43 , where the first lobe of @xmath120 is just large enough to enclose the major peaks in the @xmath1-mode power spectrum .",
    "such an annulus radius is about a factor of @xmath121 smaller than the choice of @xmath43 that matches the @xmath1-mode oscillation .",
    "these are the two specific @xmath43 s that are expected to capture a substantial power of the @xmath1 mode .    plotted in fig.(2 )",
    "are the expected @xmath122 as functions of the circle radius @xmath43 in fig.(2 ) for the @xmath111cdm , standard flat - cdm and open - cdm cosmologies , where @xmath43 is expressed in unit of arcminute .",
    "the primary peak of the polarization brightness corresponds to the smaller one of the two specific @xmath43 s shown in fig.(1a , b , c ) .",
    "it is expected because the first lobe of @xmath123 captures a great deal of the @xmath1-mode power .",
    "this optimal @xmath43 s that yield the peaks in fig.(2 ) capture about @xmath2 of the total @xmath1-mode power for all three cosmologies .",
    "there exist secondary peaks in fig.(2 ) , which partially blend into the primary peaks .",
    "these secondary peaks are given by the larger @xmath43 that produces the oscillating @xmath124 to match the oscillating pattern in the @xmath1-mode power spectrum .",
    "apart from the contributions from the two peaks , the e - mode surface brightness is seen to drop rapidly toward large and small @xmath43 .",
    "the @xmath111cdm and standard flat - cdm cosmologies can hardly be distinguishable at the primary peak except for their different amplitudes .",
    "however , the two cosmologies are distinguishable by the secondary peaks . by contrast , the two peaks in the open - cdm cosmology are rather distinct from those of the other two cosmologies in both scale and amplitude .",
    "it is also noted that for @xmath125 arcmin , the @xmath1 mode power declines by almost a factor of @xmath126 from its respective peak values in the three cosmologies .",
    "this is the scale on which one expects to detect the @xmath0 mode .",
    "the @xmath1 mode on this scale is still much larger than the @xmath0 mode and may create serious contamination for the @xmath0-mode measurement , an issue to be detailed next . in sec.(7 ) , we will show that a finite beam can cure this problem .",
    "although we have shown the plausibility of the circle projection method for @xmath1-mode measurements , a naive application of this method to @xmath0-mode measurements may find it difficult to realize , due primary to the expected ten - times - smaller amplitude in the @xmath0 mode . as measurements of @xmath0 modes offer a much greater science return than measurements of @xmath1 modes , intense efforts on the @xmath0-mode detection are expected to be made in a foreseeable future .",
    "the main challenge here is to defeat not only the noise but also the leakage from the much stronger @xmath1 modes into @xmath0 modes . according to eq.(7 ) , the small real part of @xmath23 ( the @xmath0 mode ) is actually the residue of cancellation among the much stronger @xmath1-mode signals along the circle .",
    "therefore , the experimental setup for @xmath0-mode measurements can be very different from that for the @xmath1-mode .",
    "for example , a telescope that is capable of measuring the @xmath0 mode in a reasonable time span should have a large number of detectors to speed up the observation .",
    "in addition , the strategy using single - polarization detectors to measure @xmath0 mode will likely fail , due to the much weaker signals in the presence of stronger @xmath1 modes .",
    "hence , dual - polarization detectors are needed for constructing the stokes @xmath10 and @xmath11 simultaneously .",
    "we shall first briefly review the characteristics of @xmath1 and @xmath0 modes .",
    "the @xmath1-mode power per log - waveband ( i.e. , @xmath127 ) peaks at the angular scale about @xmath128 arc - minutes for the currently most favorable @xmath111cdm cosmology , c.f . ,",
    "fig.(1a ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the @xmath0-mode power per log - waveband is less than 1@xmath129 of that for the @xmath1-mode and peaks on the angular scale of a couple of degrees . adopting the circular projection integration ,",
    "we show in fig.(3 a , b , c ) how the best choice of @xmath130 may capture the @xmath0-mode power spectra for the three cosmologies indicated in fig.(1 ) . plotted in fig.(4 ) are the squared variances @xmath131 given by eq.(9 ) .",
    "note that the peak power captures about @xmath2 of the total @xmath0-mode power for all three cosmologies .",
    "it is fortunate that the @xmath0-mode power concentrates at a much larger scale than where the @xmath1-mode power does by almost one order of magnitude .",
    "the scale separation can help extract the weak @xmath0 mode from the cmb polarization in the presence of the strong @xmath1 mode by adopting an appropriate beam size .",
    "this is an important subject to be discussed in sec.(8 ) .",
    "the @xmath132 dual - polarization detectors can be regarded as @xmath132 independent telescopes , which observe the same sky circle so as to enhance the signal collection power .",
    "when each detector rotates around the sky circle at a constant rate , the angular integration becomes time integration .",
    "moreover , each detector does its own time integration without referring to others , and therefore the laborious gain calibration across @xmath132 detectors is not needed frequently .",
    "the leakage from @xmath1-modes to @xmath0-modes within each detector can in principle be significantly removed after many periods of rotation , a subject to be discussed shortly .",
    "the total signal is obtained by summing up the signals collected by each detector after many rotations .    the aforementioned scale separation of @xmath1 and @xmath0 modes yields @xmath1-mode variations at discrete frequencies @xmath133 , which is about several to ten times higher than the discrete frequencies of @xmath0 modes , where @xmath134 is the rotational frequency and @xmath135 an integer .",
    "the present projection method is nothing more than to extract the dc component of the signals . in principle , all @xmath1 and @xmath0 modes are periodic in time , and hence the ac signals can be exactly removed in one rotation . in practice , there can be errors introduced in this observing strategy , i.e. , the errors in sweeping an exact sky circle at an exact constant rate @xmath134 .",
    "these are time - dependent drifts associated with mechanical controls and tend to be of low frequency .",
    "they introduce a phase error , i.e. , multiplying @xmath136 to the integrand of eq.(7 ) , where @xmath137 is the efficiency in picking up the @xmath1-mode , @xmath138 characterizes the error magnitude and @xmath139 is some slow function of @xmath40 , which is not necessarily periodic in @xmath40 . if such an error is a random error instead of a systematic error , it is equivalent to broadening the discrete line frequency , @xmath140 with a small random @xmath141 of variance @xmath138 .",
    "that is , one should expect that in reality the measured polarization fluctuations are no longer periodic in time , and therefore it may yield some level of @xmath1-mode leakage into the @xmath0 mode . in the worst case , the efficiency of coupling to @xmath1 modes @xmath142 , and",
    "we shall take this limit for the estimation of the leakage below .",
    "the ac @xmath1-mode leakage , @xmath143 $ ] of finite @xmath135 , acquires a complex gain factor @xmath144 after an integration time @xmath145 , where the integer @xmath146 is chosen to satisfy @xmath147 .",
    "but the dc @xmath0-mode signal gains by a factor @xmath148 during the same time interval .",
    "the numerator of eq.(11 ) can be regarded as random walks with a unit step size and @xmath132 represents the number of steps .",
    "hence @xmath149 increases with the integration time as @xmath150 , and the signal - to - leakage ratio increases with time as @xmath151 .",
    "this estimate is only correct for a finite @xmath135 .",
    "the leakage contributed by the @xmath1 mode of @xmath152 , which is nearly static and modulated by the low - frequency noise , requires a separate estimate .",
    "as mentioned in the last paragraph of sec.(4 ) , the @xmath1-mode power , over a circle of a couple of degrees , is reduced by almost a factor of @xmath126 from its peak value to a level @xmath153 for the @xmath111cdm cosmology .",
    "note also that the gain factor @xmath154 is complex , and it is only the imaginary part that can make the dc @xmath1 mode leak into the dc @xmath0 mode .",
    "thus , the leakage power from the dc @xmath1 mode is @xmath155k@xmath156 after an integration time @xmath148 , where @xmath157",
    "it follows that @xmath158 and the signal - to - leakage ratio increases with time as @xmath159 , which is a factor of @xmath160 smaller than the leakage caused by the ac @xmath1 modes .    in other words ,",
    "the dc @xmath1 mode is the dominant contributor to the leakage . from this estimate",
    ", we notice that the extreme low - frequency sweeping errors , such as @xmath161 noise , may seriously hamper the @xmath0-@xmath1 separation . in the estimate",
    "below , it is found that @xmath132 needs to be of order a few hundreds to suppress the @xmath1-mode leakage at a satisfactory level .",
    "nonetheless , such extreme low - frequency noise can be efficiently removed when the calibration of the scanning trajectory is conducted periodically .",
    "that is , periodic calibration can modulate the low - frequency noise with a finite - frequency , thereby making such noise under control .    to be specific for estimating the number of rotations required to suppress the @xmath1-mode leakage , we take the @xmath111cdm cosmology as a fiducial model .",
    "the peak @xmath0-mode power is @xmath162 at the circle radius @xmath163 degrees ( c.f .",
    ", fig.(4 ) ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the expected @xmath1 leakage power at this ring radius is @xmath164 ( c.f .",
    ", fig.(2 ) ) . hence , the minimum @xmath132 is about @xmath165 in order to suppress the leakage down to the @xmath166 level of the expected signal power , and the total number of rotations is therefore @xmath167 .",
    "as mentioned earlier , the lower bound of @xmath168 can be set by periodical calibration .",
    "take @xmath169 as an example ; one needs @xmath170 rotations to beat down the @xmath1-mode leakage satisfactorily . for a total integration time several thousand hours ( discussed in sec.(8 ) ) , it requires a rotation rate at least one turn per day .",
    "in fact , the leakage from the dc @xmath1-mode can be further reduced by the finite beam size .",
    "this is the most effective means for @xmath1-mode suppression and will be elaborated in sec.(8 ) after the effects of finite beam width are examined in sec.(7 ) .",
    "we now turn to brief discussions on the potentially most serious contaminants to the @xmath0-mode measurement .",
    "the contamination of the scattered polarized photons from the terrestrial environments , such as the 3-degree cmb photons reflected by the ground and observational instruments , can be a serious problem for the polarization measurement .",
    "this problem is even more acute for the @xmath0-mode measurement .",
    "nevertheless , uniform illumination of polarized photons to the detector can contribute no net polarization signal after a perfect line integration as the first equality of eq.(7 ) shows ; neither can the dipole pattern of illuminating sources .",
    "in fact , among all multipole patterns , only the quadrupole patterns can contribute to the polarization measurement for the present observing strategy .",
    "serious measures must be taken to guard against the quadrupole - moment scattered lights in the experiment .",
    "the confusion from polarized point sources can also be a serious concern for the cmb polarization measurement , and they generally contribute almost equally to both @xmath1 and @xmath0 modes .",
    "they are often synchrotron and dust emission sources ; the former is strong at low radio frequencies and the latter dominates at high frequencies@xcite .",
    "since the present method measures small patches of sky in the real space , it is possible to identify the point - source suspects through measurements at very low and very high frequencies _ a priori _ and to avoid these regions .",
    "point - source confusion may thus be a soluble problem .",
    "the @xmath1-mode polarization in the cmbr results from the thomson scattering off the temperature anisotropy of the primordial adiabatic and/or iso - curvature fluctuations .",
    "therefore , the polarization @xmath1-mode is causally related to the temperature anisotropy , with its phase locked to temperature fluctuations .",
    "the correlation between the temperature anisotropy scalar field and the polarization tensor field is conventionally defined in the fourier space as @xmath171\\rangle$ ] per @xmath172 band , where @xmath173 denotes the angular average over the direction of the wave - vector @xmath174 .",
    "plotted in fig.(5,a , b , c ) are @xmath175 of the same three cosmologies as those indicated in fig.(1 ) .",
    "the averaged signals are a factor of few stronger than those of the @xmath1 polarization . in the real space ,",
    "the inverse fourier transformation gives @xmath176    the measured stokes parameters and temperature anisotropy are subject to different filter functions . while the filter function for the polarization tensor field is @xmath71 , the filter function @xmath177 for the @xmath178 scalar field is @xmath179 .",
    "the fourier component of @xmath180 is @xmath181 .",
    "we define the @xmath3 correlation by multiplying @xmath182 on the sky circle to the temperature anisotropy on the same circle .",
    "the filter - weighted @xmath3 correlation , in unit of temperature , is thus @xmath183}{2\\pi a } j_0(kr ) j_2(kr ) kdk.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] plotted in fig.(5 a , b , c ) are also the composite filter function @xmath184 of some choices of @xmath43 for the three cosmologies .",
    "figure ( 6 ) shows @xmath185 as functions of @xmath43 in unit of arcminute . as @xmath186 is not a positive definite quantity , the spatial filtering significantly smears out the @xmath3 correlation and the resulting @xmath187 gives a relatively small signal strength for all filter sizes @xmath43 .",
    "thus , applying the circular - contour integration to measure @xmath3 correlation is probably not an optimal strategy .",
    "nevertheless , if an experiment has a sufficiently high sensitivity to detect the @xmath1-mode variance , it should also be well within its capability to measure @xmath187 .",
    "in a real experiment , the detector beam has a finite width . even with a finite beam width , the present strategy for separating @xmath1 and @xmath0 modes still holds .",
    "below , we specifically consider the scanning - beam observation with a single detector , where the polarimeter axes are rotated to align with the local radial and azimuthal directions defined by the beam - center position @xmath188 .",
    "moreover , the beam also co - rotates with the polarimeter axes so that its orientation remains fixed with respect to the local radial direction .",
    "such a setup measures the following surface brightness weighed by the beam around the circle : @xmath189\\nonumber\\\\ = & & -i\\int_0^{2\\pi } \\frac{d\\phi_q}{2\\pi } e^{i2(\\phi_r-\\phi)}a({\\bf r}-{\\bf r})\\nonumber\\\\ & & [ r\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r}(\\frac{1}{r}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r } ) -\\frac{1}{r^2}\\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial\\phi^2 } + \\frac{2i}{r}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial\\phi}(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r } -\\frac{1}{2r})](f+ig),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the second equality of eq.(7 ) has been used , @xmath190 is the rotating beam pattern , and @xmath191 the azimuthal angle of the beam center .",
    "the beam - center angle @xmath191 , instead of @xmath40 , appears on the right of the first equality because the rotation of polarimeter axes always refers to the beam - center position on the circle .",
    "the beam pattern @xmath73 can generally be expanded in terms of the monopole , quadrupole , etc .. when the beam pattern co - rotates with the polarimeter axis , both angles @xmath191 and @xmath40 always appear in these multipole moments in the combination , @xmath192 .",
    "hence when the beam - center angle @xmath191 is integrated out , we obtain an additional radial window function to account for the fact that the finite - size beam measures a sky annulus of finite width rather than an infinitely sharp ring , as illustrated below .",
    "the radial window function is a real quantity , and therefore the separability of @xmath0 and @xmath1 modes remains intact .    for the purpose of illustration",
    ", we let the beam be symmetric gaussian with a half width @xmath193 , though in practice the beam is not necessary a symmetric one , @xmath194/2d^2}\\nonumber\\\\ & & = \\sum_n i_n(rr / d^2)e^{in(\\phi-\\phi_r)}e^{-(r^2+r^2)/2d^2},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the circle has been taken to have a radius @xmath43 , and @xmath195 is the modified bessel function .",
    "the effective area of the beam is @xmath196 .",
    "the angular average of @xmath191 of eq.(15 ) can then be carried out without involving @xmath40 , and it follows that @xmath197(f+ig).\\ ] ]    in the case when the beam is asymmetric , this method also works , as long as the beam shape remains fixed with respect to the local rotating coordinate around the circle .",
    "for example , when the beam has a quadrupole component , the beam @xmath198 in eq.(16 ) will need to be replaced by @xmath199,\\ ] ] where @xmath200 and @xmath201 are the long and short axes , respectively , and the @xmath191-dependence accounts for the co - rotating beam pattern .",
    "the quadrupole moment in the argument of @xmath73 can be re - arranged to become @xmath202 $ ] .",
    "when such a beam is substituted into eq.(15 ) , the result is similar to eq.(17 ) except for a different radial function in eq.(17 ) .",
    "this nice result allows us to carry out the next manipulation for projecting out the @xmath1 and @xmath0 modes as shown below .",
    "( we shall not dwell on asymmetric beams in the following discussions , but only to point out here that asymmetric beams pose no problem for the proposed @xmath203 separation . )",
    "we now perform an angular average of eq.(17 ) over @xmath40 , corresponding to retaining only the dc component of the signals , and find that @xmath204.\\ ] ] the real and imaginary parts correspond to the @xmath0 and @xmath1 modes , respectively .",
    "identical to what we have found in sec.(2 ) , eq.(19 ) can be re - written as a surface convolution with a window function @xmath71 : @xmath205 \\int \\frac{d^2{\\bf r}'}{2\\pi r^2 }   \\bar w(r - r')\\nabla'^2(f({\\bf r}')+i g({\\bf r}'))\\ ] ] where @xmath206 .",
    "the squared bracket in eq.(20 ) sharply peaks at @xmath207 when the primary beam width @xmath208 ; it becomes @xmath209 and eq.(20 ) is then reduced to eq.(7 ) of the sharp - beam case .",
    "moreover , the convolution surface integral of @xmath210 in eq.(20 ) can further be expressed as @xmath211 after an identical algebra as before .",
    "finally , the averaged surface brightness over the whole beam becomes @xmath212 k^2 ( f_k+ig_k)\\nonumber\\\\ & & = i\\int\\frac{d^2{\\bf k}}{4\\pi^2}j_2(kr ) e^{-(k^2d^2/2 ) } k^2 ( f_k+ig_k )   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and its variance @xmath213^{1/2},\\ ] ] where @xmath91 represents either @xmath214 or @xmath215 .",
    "when @xmath216 , we recover the sharp - beam limit , eq.(9 ) , from eq.(23 ) .",
    "figure ( 7 ) plots the squared variance of the beam weighed surface brightness of @xmath1 and @xmath0 modes as a function of the annulus radius @xmath43 with various @xmath193 s for the fiducial @xmath111cdm cosmology ( @xmath217 , @xmath218 and @xmath114 ) .",
    "the non - zero @xmath193 leads to smearing of the peaks appearing in the sharp - beam limit .",
    "moreover , the drastic decline in the @xmath1-mode power for a non - negligible @xmath219 is also evident in fig.(7 ) .",
    "this is due to the gaussian cutoff in eq.(23 ) .",
    "similarly , when observed with a finite beam , the @xmath3 correlation , eq.(14 ) , becomes @xmath220}{2\\pi a } j_0(kr)j_2(kr ) e^{-k^2d^2 } kdk.\\ ] ] shown in fig.(8 ) are the @xmath3 correlation of the fiducial cosmology for various @xmath193 s .",
    "apparently , the gaussian cutoff is also at work when the beam width is non - negligible .",
    "we return to the discussions on the @xmath1-mode leakage to the @xmath0-mode measurements , especially when the effects of finite beam width are taken into account .",
    "fig.(7 ) clearly shows that when the half - beam width @xmath221 arcmin , the peak @xmath0-mode power decreases from the sharp - beam case by a factor about @xmath222 .",
    "but with such a wide beam , the @xmath1-mode power decreases by a factor of @xmath126 , as compared with the sharp - beam case , at the radius @xmath163 degrees .",
    "hence the @xmath1-mode power is only a factor of @xmath223 greater than that of the @xmath0-mode power around @xmath163 degrees .",
    "this is due precisely to the scale separation between @xmath1 and @xmath0 modes ; the wide beam yields a small @xmath219 for @xmath0 modes but a sizable @xmath219 for @xmath1 modes .",
    "that is , one can always choose an appropriate beam to significantly suppress the @xmath1-modes leakage while not to sacrifice the @xmath0-modes . for the @xmath111cdm cosmology ,",
    "a half - beam of @xmath224 arcminutes is near the optimal for @xmath0-mode detection .",
    "we are now in a position to estimate how likely the @xmath0 and @xmath1 modes may be detected by the circular scan strategy in the near future .",
    "the amiba experiment@xcite is equipped with two separate sets of @xmath225 dishes of different sizes , @xmath226 cm and @xmath227 cm , mounted on a @xmath228 m turntable platform .",
    "it has @xmath229-ghz wide - band receivers with dual polarization capability and operates at @xmath230 ghz , a frequency window in which the galactic synchrotron and dust emissions are both minimal .",
    "the amiba has been designed to operate in the interferometry mode , which has the advantage of easily removing systematic errors . however , amiba can also operate in the single - dish mode , to which the present observing strategy applies . in each single dish ,",
    "both left and right circular - polarization detectors collect independent signals , and the two sets of signals are correlated to obtain the stokes @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "much like the conventional interferometric measurements , correlation of the two independent signals can significantly remove the systematic errors as well as the electronic @xmath161 noise . with the system temperature @xmath231k , bandwidth @xmath232ghz , and antenna efficiency @xmath233 for amiba , the noise level per antenna per polarization after an integration time @xmath234 is @xmath235 and it amounts to @xmath236mk@xmath237 , where the factor @xmath238 corrects for the non - rayleigh - jeans limit for @xmath230 ghz and @xmath239 is @xmath234 in unit of seconds . with @xmath225 antennae and dual polarization",
    ", the system noise is reduced by @xmath240 to become @xmath241k@xmath237 .",
    "thus , in @xmath242-hour integration , one obtains a noise level down to @xmath243k , which is the expected maximum surface brightness of the @xmath1 mode with the @xmath236 m amiba dish , or @xmath244 in fig.(7 ) . in @xmath245 hours",
    ", a @xmath246 @xmath1-mode signal is expected in a single sky annulus of radius in between @xmath247 and @xmath226 arcminutes .",
    "the @xmath0-mode peak strength for the amiba @xmath248 m dish , ( @xmath249 in fig.(7 ) ) is about @xmath250k .",
    "it therefore requires about @xmath5 hours to detect an @xmath4 signal , or @xmath7 hours for a @xmath246 @xmath0-mode signal in a single annulus of radius @xmath251 degrees or so .",
    "so far , we have estimated the signals for the single - field measurement , which are in themselves random fluctuations . to beat down the sample variance and construct the @xmath0-mode curves shown in fig.(7 )",
    ", one needs a more efficient approach for determining the variance of the random signals in the presence of the instrument noise than the deep measurement described above .",
    "the combined error @xmath252 of the sample variance and instrument noise is estimated to be @xmath253 where @xmath254 is the variance of the instrument noise per sky annulus and @xmath255 the number of independent sky annuli measured .",
    "note that @xmath256 , @xmath257 and the total observing time is @xmath258 . for a fixed total observing time ,",
    "we want the single - field integration time @xmath234 such that @xmath259 .",
    "that is , the optimal strategy for the determination of the curves shown in fig.(7 ) is to collect signals with @xmath260 per sky annulus .",
    "thus , the desired integration time per annulus for the @xmath0 mode is therefore @xmath261 hours for amiba with a @xmath224 arcmin half - beam .",
    "the detemination of @xmath262 at the @xmath246 level ( including the sample variance ) requires @xmath263 or a total integration time @xmath264 hours .",
    "this amount of total observing time has become too long to be realistic .",
    "having discussed the capability of amiba for the cmb polarization measurement , we briefly turn to a discussion on the optimal instrument that may be able to realistically measure a substantial part of the @xmath0-mode curve shown in fig.(7 ) .",
    "the guiding principle for an optimal telescope is to collect as many photons as possible , and it thus requires as large a light collecting area as possible for a fixed beam size .",
    "however , the conventional radio telescopes mostly work in the diffraction - beam regime , where @xmath265 with @xmath266 , @xmath267 and @xmath268 being the physical area of the telescope , the beam solid angle and the photon wavelength , respectively , for the reason that these telescopes are designed to maximize the angular resolution for conventional observations .",
    "however , the @xmath0 modes are intrinsically of large scale ( degree scale ) , and the measurements of @xmath0 modes thus require low - resolution telescopes . from the discussions given in the beginning of this section",
    ", we see that a half - beam width about @xmath224 arcmin can just be appropriate for the @xmath0-mode measurement . at @xmath269ghz ,",
    "the dish diameter of a conventional radio telescope that yields a diffraction beam of @xmath224 arcmin is about @xmath248 meters .",
    "such a conventional telescope is not optimized .",
    "an optimized telescope should adopt multi - mode feeds , where the antenna beam may be made much wider than the diffraction beam .",
    "that is , for a fixed beam width , one would like to increase the dish size as much as possible .",
    "( note that the surface brightness signal - to - noise ratio increases linearly with the dish area . ) as an example , a @xmath251-meter dish with a @xmath224-arcmin half beam is @xmath270 times more sensitive than a @xmath248-meter dish with a @xmath224-arcmin half beam .",
    "a large - dish telescope hence has a tremendous advantage over an instrument such as amiba , which consists of @xmath225 dishes of @xmath248-meter diameter with diffraction beams . with the same noise temperature per detector ,",
    "such a @xmath251-meter , single - detector telescope gains a factor @xmath271(ratio of dish area)(ratio of detector number)@xmath272 ) in detection sensitivity over amiba , or a factor @xmath273 reduction in the integration time , thereby making the @xmath0-mode power spectrum measurement a feasible task to conduct .",
    "however , there is a caveat for this muli - mode feed approach . the beam pattern and",
    "the polarization property can be difficult to control . to attain the sensitivity given by the",
    "above example , @xmath270 modes are needed ; the multi - mode bolometer currently in operation contains @xmath126 modes or so for the maxima experiment ( private conversation with paul richards ) .",
    "despite the techincal challenges , it is certainly worthwhile to contemplate the next generation experiments for @xmath0-mode measurements along this direction .",
    "in sum , this work addresses how the cmbr polarization @xmath1 and @xmath0 modes can be separated with a local measurement of stokes parameters @xmath10 and @xmath11 . for scanning observations ,",
    "we show that the only scanning trajectory capable of separating @xmath1 and @xmath0 polarization patterns are those that are circles . moreover , the polarimeter axis also needs to rotate along the circle at the same rate as well . by varying the annulus radius @xmath43",
    ", one can measure @xmath1 and @xmath0 modes of various scales . in terms of the conventional power spectrum ,",
    "this circular scanning observation is equivalent to adopting some particular @xmath79-space filters .",
    "we have presented the expected surface - brightness of @xmath1 and @xmath0 modes as well as the @xmath3 correlation measured through these filters .",
    "\\(a ) the measured peak power of @xmath1 and @xmath0 modes can be about @xmath2 of the total power contained in the cmb polarization fluctuations .",
    "the relatively high efficiency makes this strategy attractive for the detection of @xmath1 and @xmath0 polarization fluctuations in the cmb .",
    "\\(b ) the measurement can be conducted on a turntable platform , where all detectors scan the same sky circle , with each detector performing its own integration of stokes @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "the noise in the @xmath132 detectors are all independent and the data gathered by each detector can be straightforwardly summed together to enhance the signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "this sweeping - beam strategy is particularly useful for the weak @xmath0-mode detection , as the scan can be on an almost perfect circle , which is needed to avoid the @xmath1-mode leakage .",
    "the sweeping - beam strategy also avoids the need for frequent calibration across different detectors , thereby making the observation simple and stable .",
    "\\(c ) the present observing strategy is perfectly valid when the beam has a finite size .",
    "this opens up the possibility that one may effectively suppress the @xmath1-mode leakage to the measurements of @xmath0 modes , and the possibility that the observation of the weak cmb polarization signals can be made efficiently by using a large telescope with a finite beam , a beam that is much larger than the diffraction beam .",
    "\\(d ) even when the beam is asymmetric the circular scan strategy remains valid , provided that the beam shape and orientation remain fixed with respect to the local axes along the circle traced by the beam center .",
    "\\(e ) the present method measures , in effect , the combination of a circular - top - hat - filtered and a circular - ring - filtered polarization patterns . in the fourier domain , both power spectra of the combined filter and the @xmath1 mode oscillate .",
    "there exists a filter ( primarily the ring filter ) of size @xmath43 for the two oscillations to have the same frequencies and phases , so that a substantial power of @xmath1 mode is picked up .",
    "it results in a second peak in the @xmath1-mode surface brightness , which can be used to distinguish the @xmath111cdm cosmology from the scdm cosmology , as shown in fig.(2 ) .",
    "thus , with the above advantages , the present local observational strategy offers an alternative way to detect the cmbr polarization for the ground - based or balloon - borne experiments , where the observation is confined within a relatively small patch of sky .",
    "this method is particularly useful for @xmath0-mode measurements , since @xmath0-mode signals are so weak that deep exposure is indeed needed .",
    "interestingly , the present method of circular scan can also be applied to the interferometric measurements of cmbr polarization@xcite , an observational strategy that originally aims to directly extract the fourier power spectrum rather than making the real - space map .",
    "the details of how it can be achieved will be reported in a separate paper .",
    "after the submission of this work , we noted a relevant work appearing in the literature@xcite , which addresses the extraction of @xmath0 modes in a circular patch of sky . by suitable linear combinations of signals obtained from different concentric sky annuli , it is possible to extract , apart from the axisymmetric modes , the non - axisymmetric @xmath0 modes .",
