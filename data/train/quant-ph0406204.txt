    "many current experiments involving the preparation or manipulation of atoms and ions require a precise coherent control of the system of interest .",
    "this does not only apply to internal degrees of freedom , but also to the external motional degrees of freedom . in the last few years",
    ", the laser cooling of trapped ions or atoms has therefore been a subject of intense research and is now a routine tool in many laboratories .",
    "starting from the first observation of laser cooling  @xcite , many interesting applications have been made possible by laser cooling .",
    "examples are the direct observation of quantum jumps  @xcite , the preparation of atoms in the motional ground state  @xcite , and high - precision spectroscopy  @xcite .",
    "apart from cooling on dipole - forbidden transitions  @xcite and cooling by stimulated raman transitions  @xcite , cooling facilitated by electromagnetically induced transparency ( eit )  @xcite is a promising recent technique to reach the mechanical ground state .",
    "eit cooling has already been observed experimentally  @xcite .",
    "once a trapped atom reaches the lamb - dicke regime e.g. by unresolved doppler cooling , the interaction with a cooling laser field may excite the atom by three kinds of processes .",
    "carrier excitations involve an excitation of the internal electronic degree of freedom of the atom without a change of the motional quantum number .",
    "processes where simultaneously with the internal excitation the motional quantum number is increased ( decreased ) are known as blue ( red ) sideband excitations . both excitation - deexcitation cycles involving carrier- and blue - sideband excitations",
    "may lead to a heating of the trapped system .",
    "red - sideband excitations may cool the system .",
    "the basic idea of eit cooling is to design the absorption properties of the sample to be cooled such that carrier excitations are inhibited , and such that red - sideband transitions dominate over blue - sideband transitions .",
    "the cooling limit is then reached if the heating and the cooling rates become equal , and is typically above zero .",
    "level scheme for the double - eit cooling scheme .",
    "the upper state @xmath0 is connected to three lower states @xmath1 ( @xmath2 ) by dipole - allowed transitions . @xmath3 and @xmath4 are the respective rabi frequencies and detunings of the driving laser fields , and @xmath5 are spontaneous decay rates.,height=113 ]    however the incoherent thermal motion is a source of decoherence and disturbs the precise coherent control of the system .",
    "one way to resolve this problem is to find control schemes for `` hot '' systems which do not require a cooling to the ground state  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless many recent theoretical proposals rely on an atomic or ionic system cooled to the motional ground state in order to allow for a precise control and to avoid decoherence .",
    "typical examples for this are are quantum communication schemes or quantum information processing .",
    "therefore in this article we propose a `` double - eit '' cooling scheme which in addition to the three - level @xmath6-setup in the usual eit scheme makes use of an additional third ground state .",
    "this state is coupled by a strong coupling laser to the upper state , see fig .",
    "[ fig - system ] .",
    "this effectively allows to create two independent eit - structures in the absorption spectrum of the trapped atom , which can be controlled by the two coupling laser fields to cancel the carrier- and the blue - sideband transitions , respectively . with this technique ,",
    "the dominant heating processes of single - eit cooling are suppressed in double - eit cooling .",
    "thus the predicted cooling limit of the double - eit scheme is suppressed by a factor of order @xmath7 as compared to conventional eit cooling , where @xmath8 is the lamb - dicke parameter . for many cooling setups ,",
    "double - eit cooling does not require more effort than single - eit , as the upper state decays to more than two lower states as needed for single - eit cooling . instead of repumping the system arbitrarily ,",
    "a suitable choice of the pump field leads to double - eit cooling and thus to improved cooling performance .",
    "therefore with the double - eit scheme the unwanted additional decay pathways become an advantage .",
    "the system consists of a trapped atom confined in a harmonic potential with trap frequency @xmath9 and mass @xmath10 . internally , the atom has one upper state @xmath0 and three lower states @xmath1 ( @xmath2 ) which are connected by dipole - allowed transitions to the upper state ( see fig .",
    "[ fig - system ] ) .",
    "each of the transitions is driven by a laser field with rabi frequency @xmath3 and detuning @xmath11 ( @xmath2 ) where @xmath12 is the frequency of the @xmath13th laser field and @xmath14 ( @xmath15 ) is the energy of the atomic state @xmath16 .",
    "the upper state may further decay to the lower states with the decay rates @xmath5 , respectively .",

    "this especially holds for double - eit cooling , where the upper state excitation is even lower than in single - eit cooling .",

    "the population decaying the third lower state has to be repumped to the single - eit subspace , which induces additional heating .",

    "also , we verified that the improved cooling dynamics is a double - eit effect by slightly changing the detuning @xmath122 from the optimum value @xmath123 , yielding higher cooling limits for both lower and higher detunings .",
    "the double - eit scheme differs from the conventional single - eit scheme in that the absorption spectrum is designed such that both the carrier- and the blue - sideband excitations are inhibited .",
    "this suppresses the heating processes and the cooling limit by a factor of the order @xmath7 . as with the conventional single - eit mechanism ,",
    "simultaneous cooling in three dimensions is possible if the trap frequencies along the three axes are not too different such that the red - sideband absorption frequencies of all directions are within the narrow peak in the scattering spectrum at @xmath53 .",
    "however while the double - eit scheme generally improves the cooling properties as compared to the single - eit case , a _ simultaneous _",
    "cooling along more than one motional axis to the ground state with efficiency as in the one - dimensional case requires the trap frequencies to be similar , as otherwise the heating processes can not be canceled exactly for all directions at the same time . by coherently coupling more than three lower",
    "levels to the upper state , the cooling scheme can also be extended to multiple - eit cooling .",
    "then simultaneous eit - cooling at different trap frequencies without blue - sideband heating is possible .",
    "[ fig - absorb](b ) shows triple - eit with four lower levels , where @xmath124 ( @xmath125 ) is the motional quantum number for trap frequency @xmath126 ( @xmath127 ) .",
    "alternatively , multiple - eit can be used to cancel further heating processes .",
    "however at higher order in @xmath8 , also the heating via scattering of the cooling fields needs to be taken into account .",
    "it should be noted that in some systems double - eit cooling does not require more effort than single - eit cooling .",
    "typical examples are systems where the upper state decays to more than two lower states . instead of repumping the system arbitrarily as required for single - eit cooling , a suitable choice for the parameters of the pump laser field leads to double - eit cooling and thus to improved cooling performance .",
    "therefore here the disadvantage of additional decay channels becomes an advantage .",
    "other possible systems for double - eit cooling are e.g. ne  @xcite , rb or cs . depending on the choice of the upper state , the latter two systems also allow for multiple - eit cooling with more than three lower states .    in summary",
    ", we have presented a laser cooling scheme which allows to efficiently reach the motional ground state of a trapped atom or ion . with the help of two coupling laser fields , the scattering spectrum for the cooling laser field",
    "is designed such that both carrier- and blue - sideband excitations are inhibited , thus eliminating all heating processes in leading order of an expansion in the lamb - dicke parameter @xmath8 . as compared to the conventional single - eit scheme , this double - eit scheme allows to lower the cooling limit by a factor of order @xmath7 .",
