    "one says that a variety @xmath5 over @xmath6 _ violates the hasse principle _ if @xmath7 for all completions @xmath8 of @xmath6 ( i.e. , @xmath9 and @xmath10 for all primes @xmath11 ) but @xmath12 .",
    "hasse proved that degree  2 hypersurfaces in @xmath13 _ satisfy _ the hasse principle .",
    "in particular , if @xmath5 is a genus  0 curve , then @xmath5 satisfies the hasse principle , since the anticanonical embedding of @xmath5 is a conic in @xmath2 .    around 1940 , lind  @xcite and ( independently , but shortly later ) reichardt  @xcite discovered examples of genus  1 curves over @xmath6 that violate the hasse principle , such as the nonsingular projective model of the affine curve @xmath14 later , selmer  @xcite gave examples of diagonal plane cubic curves ( also of genus  1 ) violating the hasse principle , including @xmath15 in @xmath2 .",
    "oneil in  @xcite constructs an interesting example of an algebraic _ family _ of genus  1 curves each having @xmath10-points for all @xmath16 .",
    "some fibers in her family violate the hasse principle , by failing to have a @xmath6-point .",
    "in other words , these fibers represent nonzero elements of the shafarevich - tate groups of their jacobians .    in  @xcite ,",
    "colliot - thlne and the present author prove , among other things , the existence of non - isotrivial families of genus  1 curves over the base @xmath17 , smooth over a dense open subset , such that the fiber over _ each _ rational point of @xmath17 is a smooth plane cubic violating the hasse principle .",
    "in more concrete terms , this implies that there exists a family of plane cubics depending on a parameter @xmath18 , such that the @xmath19-invariant is a non - constant function of @xmath18 , and such that substituting _ any _ rational number for @xmath18 results in a smooth plane cubic over @xmath6 violating the hasse principle .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to produce an explicit example of such a family .",
    "our example , presented as a family of cubic curves in @xmath2 with homogeneous coordinates @xmath20 , is @xmath21",
    "let us review briefly the construction in  @xcite .",

    "if @xmath24 is a line in @xmath23 meeting @xmath22 in exactly 3 geometric points , and @xmath25 denotes the blowup of @xmath22 along @xmath26 , then projection from @xmath24 induces a fibration @xmath27 whose fibers are hyperplane sections of @xmath22 .",
    "moreover , if @xmath24 is sufficiently general , then @xmath27 will be a lefschetz pencil , meaning that the only singularities of fibers are nodes .",
    "in fact , for most @xmath24 , all fibers will be either smooth plane cubic curves , or cubic curves with a single node .    for some @xmath28 , the above construction can be done with models over @xmath29 $ ] so that for each prime @xmath30 , reduction mod @xmath11 yields a family of plane cubic curves each smooth or with a single node .",
    "one then proves that if @xmath30 , each fiber above an @xmath31-point has a smooth @xmath31-point , so hensel s lemma constructs a @xmath10-point on the fiber @xmath32 of @xmath27 above any @xmath33 .",
    "there is no reason that such @xmath32 should have @xmath10-points for @xmath34 , but the existence of @xmath10-points on @xmath22 implies that at least for @xmath18 in a nonempty @xmath11-adically open subset @xmath35 of @xmath36 , @xmath37 will be nonempty .",
    "we obtain the desired family by base - extending @xmath27 by a rational function @xmath38 such that @xmath39 for each @xmath34 .",

    "to prove this , we enumerate the combinatorial possibilities for a plane cubic , corresponding to the degrees of the factors of the cubic polynomial : see figure  [ planecubics ] .",
    "the euler characteristic for each , which is unchanged if we pass to the associated reduced scheme @xmath60 , is computed using the formula @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the normalization of @xmath60 , @xmath63 is the genus of the @xmath64-th component of @xmath65 , and @xmath66 is the set of singular points of @xmath60 . for example , for the `` conic + tangent , '' formula  ( [ normalization ] ) gives @xmath67    [ smoothpoint ] if @xmath68 $ ] is a nonzero homogeneous cubic polynomial such that @xmath69 does not factor completely into linear factors over @xmath70 , then the subscheme @xmath5 of @xmath2 defined by @xmath71 has a smooth @xmath31-point .",

    "if @xmath5 is a smooth cubic curve , then it is of genus  1 , and @xmath72 by the hasse bound .",
    "otherwise , enumerating possibilities as in figure  [ planecubics ] shows that @xmath5 is a nodal or cuspidal cubic , or a union of a line and a conic .",
    "the galois action on components is trivial , because when there is more than one , the components have different degrees .",
    "there is an open subset of @xmath5 isomorphic over @xmath31 to @xmath17 with at most two geometric points deleted .",

    "the intersection @xmath26 as a subscheme of @xmath76 with homogeneous coordinates @xmath77 is defined by @xmath78 which has discriminant @xmath79 , so the intersection consists of three distinct geometric points .",

    "shows that this affine variety is singular when @xmath94 satisfies @xmath95 the fiber above @xmath96 is smooth , so by lemma  [ twelve ] , the 12 values of @xmath97 satisfying  ( [ singular12 ] ) give the _ only _ points in @xmath98 above which the fiber @xmath86 is singular , and moreover each of these singular fibers is a nodal cubic . the polynomial  ( [ singular12 ] ) is irreducible over @xmath6 , so @xmath86 is smooth for all @xmath99 .",

    "[ smoothpoint ] and hensel s lemma , @xmath86 has a @xmath10-point for all @xmath105 .",
    "[ localpoints ] if @xmath106 satisfies @xmath107 for @xmath108 and @xmath109 , then the fiber @xmath86 has a @xmath10-point for all completions @xmath10 , @xmath16 .",
    "existence of real points is automatic , since @xmath86 is a plane curve of odd degree .",

    "hence lemma  [ smoothpoint ] applies to show that for any @xmath120 , the plane cubic defined by  ( [ ubarfiber ] ) over @xmath121 has a smooth @xmath121-point , and hensel s lemma implies that @xmath86 has a @xmath122-point at least when @xmath109 .",
    "when @xmath123 , the curve reduced modulo  5 , @xmath124 consists of three lines through @xmath125 , so it does not satisfy the conditions of lemma  [ smoothpoint ] , but one of the lines , namely @xmath126 , is defined over @xmath127 , and every @xmath127-point on this line except @xmath128 is smooth on @xmath129 . hence @xmath86 has a @xmath130-point .",
    "the same argument shows that @xmath86 has a @xmath131-point whenever @xmath132 , since the curve reduced modulo  2 is @xmath133 , which contains @xmath134 .    finally , when @xmath135 , the point @xmath136 satisfies the equation  ( [ ufiber ] ) modulo  @xmath137 , and hensel s lemma gives a point @xmath138 with @xmath139 .",
    "this completes the proof .",
    "we now seek a non - constant rational function @xmath140 that maps @xmath36 into @xmath141 for @xmath108 and into @xmath142 for @xmath110 . for @xmath108 , the rational function",

    ", we see that @xmath152 has @xmath10-points for all @xmath16 . on the other hand , @xmath153 , because @xmath154 .",
