    "clusters of galaxies are the largest gravitationally bound structures in the universe and they can be regarded as being representative of the universe as a whole . an important phenomena occurring in clusters is the sunyaev - zeldovich effect ( sze ) , a small distortion of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) spectrum , provoked by the inverse compton scattering of the cmb photons passing through a population of hot electrons @xcite , the sze is quite independent of the redshift , so it provides an useful tool for studies of intermediate and high redshift galaxy clusters , where the cosmological model adopted plays an important role ( for a reviews see @xcite ) .",
    "when the x - ray emission of the intracluster medium ( icm ) is combined with the sze , it is possible to estimate the angular diameter distance ( add ) @xmath10 . in other words , the sze / x - ray method provides distances to the clusters and consequently a measure of the hubble parameter @xmath0 .",
    "the main advantage of this method for estimating @xmath0 is that it does not rely on the extragalactic distance ladder , being fully independent of any local calibrator @xcite .",
    "it should be stressed that the determination of hubble parameter has a practical and theoretical importance to many astrophysical properties and cosmological observations @xcite .",

    "the method adopted is primarily based on the angular diameter distances , @xmath10 , furnished by the sze / x - ray technique .",
    "the degeneracies on the remaining cosmological parameters will be broken by a joint analysis involving bao and cmb signature ( shift parameter ) .      by using an elliptical 2-dimensional @xmath51-model to describe the galaxy clusters geometry , de filippis and coworkers @xcite derived @xmath10 measurements for 25 clusters from two previous compilations : one set of data compiled by reese _ et al . _",

    "the detection of a peak in the large - scale correlation function of luminous red galaxies selected from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) main sample gave rise to a powerful cosmological probe , often referred to as bao scale .",
    "basically , the peak detected at the scale of 100 @xmath54 mpc , happens due to the baryon acoustic oscillations in the primordial baryon - photon plasma prior to recombination , and , such a result , provides a suitable `` standard ruler '' for constraining dark energy models @xcite .",
    "the relevant distance measure is the so - called dilation scale that can be modeled as the cube root of the radial dilation times the square of the transverse dilation , at the typical redshift of the galaxy sample , @xmath55 @xcite : @xmath56^{1/3}\\ , \\ ] ]    recalling that the comoving size of the sound horizon at @xmath57 is @xmath58 , it was pointed out that the combination @xmath59 is independent of @xmath0 , and this dimensionless combination is also well constrained by the bao data @xmath60    the bao quantity @xmath61 is exactly what we add to the @xmath62 , in the joint statistical analysis of the cosmological models studied here .",

    "it is weakly dependent on @xmath50 , since @xmath68 is a smooth function of @xmath50 , and the degeneracies that arise from using r rather than fitting the full cmb power spectrum are well constrained by other data such as bao and sze / x - ray .    in the following computations for the theoretical shift parameter we will apply the correction for @xmath57",

    "<S> in accelerating dark energy models , the estimates of @xmath0 from sunyaev - zeldovich effect ( sze ) and x - ray surface brightness of galaxy clusters may depend on the matter content ( @xmath1 ) , the curvature ( @xmath2 ) and the equation of state parameter ( @xmath3 ) . in this article , by using a sample of 25 angular diameter distances from galaxy clusters obtained through sze / x - ray technique , we constrain @xmath0 in the framework of a general @xmath4cdm models ( free curvature ) and a flat xcdm model with equation of state parameter @xmath5 ( @xmath3=constant ) . in order to broke the degeneracy on the cosmological parameters , we apply a joint analysis involving the baryon acoustic oscillations ( bao ) and the cmb _ shift parameter _ signature . by neglecting systematic uncertainties , for nonflat @xmath4cdm cosmologies </S>",
    "<S> we obtain @xmath6 km s@xmath7 mpc@xmath7(1@xmath8 ) whereas for a flat universe with constant equation of state parameter we find @xmath9 km s@xmath7 mpc@xmath7(1@xmath8 ) . </S>",
    "<S> such results are also in good agreement with independent studies from the _ hubble space telescope _ key project and recent estimates based on _ wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe _ , thereby suggesting that the combination of these three independent phenomena provides an interesting method to constrain the hubble constant . in particular , comparing these results with a recent determination for a flat @xmath4cdm model using only the sze technique and bao [ cunha et al . mnras </S>",
