    "activity cycles like the one observed in the sun have been detected in several late - type stars ( e.g. ) .",
    "the usually accepted model to describe the generation and intensification of magnetic fields in these stars is the @xmath4-dynamo first invoked to explain solar activity @xcite and , thoroughly improved and extended from f- to early - m stars ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "these dynamo models are based on the interaction between differential rotation ( @xmath5-effect ) and convective turbulence ( @xmath3-effect ) in the tachocline .",
    "cool stars with masses lower than about @xmath6 are believed to be fully - convective .",
    "therefore , they do not possess a tachocline and could not support an @xmath4 dynamo .",
    "nevertheless , there is plenty of observational evidence that slow late - type rotators like dme stars are very active and have strong magnetic fields ( @xcite ) . proposed that a pure @xmath7-dynamo could generate large - scale magnetic fields in fully - convective stars .",
    "moreover , the 3-d dynamo model developed by @xcite for m dwarfs reveals that fully - convective stars can generate kg - strength magnetic fields without the aid of a shearing tachocline .    to determine whether there is an onset of cyclic activity near the convective limit",
    ", it is of special interest to study the long - term chromospheric activity in stars of different spectral types , and in particular in middle - m stars . as a contribution to this subject , since 1999 we have developed the hk@xmath3 project , an observing program dedicated to periodically obtain mid - resolution echelle spectra of southern late - type stars , including fully - convective ones . from our data , we found evidences of cyclic activity for the fully - convective m5.5ve star proxima centauri , for the mid - m spectroscopic binary gj 375 and the two early - m stars gj 229 a and gj 752 a @xcite . similarly , studied a sample of stars from the _ harps _ program and found that the long - term activity of 8 early - m stars can be fitted by a sinusoidal signal .",
    "one of the most observed stars of our sample is ad leo ( gj 388 ) , which is a m3ve star @xcite , well - know for its frequent and strong flares ( e. g. @xcite ) .",
    "flares in ad leo have been observed and studied in the optical , euv and x - ray ( e.g. ) .",
    "recently , @xcite obtained a rotational period @xmath8 days for this star .",
    "ad leo is a partially - convective star of mass @xmath9 .",
    "@xcite found that ad leo hosts a magnetic field with similar properties to several fully - convective stars . although it has been extensively observed both in the quiescent and flaring states , most analysis of the chromospheric activity in ad leo are related to its short - term variability . only reported long - term variations in its flare frequency and",
    "suggest a cycle in flaring activity .",
    "this active fast - rotator star is an interesting target to explore the dynamo around the threshold for full convection . here",
    "we present a detailed study of its long - term chromospheric activity .",
    "we delineate in  [ sec.obs ] the main characteristics of the hk@xmath3 project and the asas program . in section  [ sec.res ] we report our results , we analyze of the casleo activity indicators and the long - term magnetic activity derived from casleo data and the asas database .",
    "finally , we discuss our results in the context of the dynamo theory .",
    "to study the long - term chromospheric activity in late - type stars , in 1999 we started the hk@xmath3 project . in this program ,",
    "we systematically obtain mid - resolution echelle spectra ( @xmath10 ) of several late - type stars .",
    "our observations are made at the 2.15  m telescope of the _ complejo astronmico el leoncito ( casleo ) _ , in san juan , argentina .",
    "specific details of the observations and the method used to calibrate the spectra is described in .",
    "our stellar sample was chosen to cover the spectral range from f to m , with different activity levels .",
    "in particular , we included a large number of m stars to study the transition to the completely convective regime .",
    "most of the stars are single dwarfs , although we also include several binaries and a few subgiants . at present",
    ", we have about 5500 spectra of 150 stars .    the standard activity indicator used in df to dk stars",
    "is the mount wilson @xmath11 index , essentially the ratio of the ca h and k line - core fluxes to the continuum nearby .",
    "however , as explained in detail in @xcite , it is not suitable to study the chromospheric activity on ad leo .",
    "following our previous works , we use as a proxy of stellar activity the ca k line - core flux , integrated with a triangular profile of 1.09   fwhm centered in 3933.66   @xcite .",
    "we complement our data with photometry from the all sky automated survey[multiblock footnote omitted ] ( asas ) .",
    "the asas program systematicallyobserves around 10@xmath12 stars brighter than v=14 , simultaneously in the v and i bands . here",
    "we use the v magnitude to analyze the long - term activity of ad leo .",
    "in table [ tab.logs ] we show the observation logs of ad leo at casleo .",
    "there is a total of 38 individual observations , which have been carried out on 19 nights distributed over 12 years between march 2001 and march 2013 .",
    "our observations consist of two successive spectra , to eliminate cosmic rays .",
    "observation times are between 30 and 60 minutes .    observed a large number of short and weak flares occurring very frequently ( flare activity @xmath13  h@xmath14 ) , which can mask the variations of activity due to the cycle .",
    "therefore , before exploring the existence of an activity cycle in this star , we filter out any flares from our observations .",
    "we do it by visual inspection of the observations , since during flares the line fluxes in the two succesive spectra are very different .",
    "we excluded these flaring spectra , which are indicated in table [ tab.logs ] with a `` @xmath15 '' , from the rest of the analysis .",
    "for the non - flaring casleo spectra , we calculated a nightly average of the ca k fluxes .",
    "we plot the resulting time - series of these activity indicators in fig .",
    "[ fig.gl388cas ] . in this figure",
    "we observe that ad leo reaches the minimum of activity ( 40% lower than at the maximum ) at the year 2007 .    on the other hand",
    ", we obtained the v magnitude of ad leo from the asas catalog for the period between 2004 and 2010 .",
    "we only included the best quality data ( see @xcite ) and we discarded 14 outlier observations . in fig .",
    "[ fig.gl388as ] we plot the resulting time - series , which consists of 175 points .",
    "typical errors are around 30 mmag .",
    "the mean magnitude of the whole dataset is around @xmath16 .",
    "we also look for evidence of rotational modulation due to spots and active regions on the stellar surface , probably responsible for the short - scale variations ( @xmath170.5% ) .",
    "to do so , we analyzed the data of each observing season with the lomb - scargle periodogram @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , we did not detect any significant periodicity in the asas seasonal datasets ; probably due to the low - precision of the asas photometry .    to search for long - term chromospheric activity cycles , we first analyzed both independent datasets with the lomb - scargle periodogram .",
    "the false alarm probability ( fap ) of the periods obtained were computed with a monte carlo simulation , described in .",
    "the periodogram obtained for the casleo data is plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig.gl388per ] with a dashed line .",
    "it shows a primary periodicity in the ca k fluxes with a period @xmath18 days with fap=8% , and a second , less significant , harmonic component with period @xmath19 days with fap=30% . to analyze the robustness of our results , we computed the periodograms of the series obtained by eliminating each data point alternatively . in 11 of 14 periodograms",
    "we obtained @xmath20 between 2593 and 2982 days with faps@xmath2130% ( 73% of them were @xmath22 days ) and a secondary peak @xmath23 between 843 and 931 days with larger faps .",
    "to investigate whether the 842-day period is a subharmonic frequency of the prominent peak , we used the monthly sunspot numbers ( @xmath24 ) taken from the national geophysical data center[multiblock footnote omitted ] to take into account that activity does not follow a strictly sinusoidal law .",
    "we used @xmath24 between 1751 and 2012 and rescaled the series in time to the period @xmath25 days ( @xmath177.58 years ) .",
    "we also rescaled the @xmath24 to obtain a time series of the same mean value and standard deviation as our data . to consider data with the same signal - to - noise as ours , we added gaussian noise with errors of 10% at each point .",
    "we took 1000 samples of these data with random starting dates and the same phase intervals that we have in our data and we computed the periodograms . as expected , 55% of the most significant periods detected in each periodogram appart from @xmath25 days in less than 10% . on the other hand , only 0.3% are between 671 and 1007 days ( 842 days @xmath26 ) .",
    "therefore , we can conclude that the peak at @xmath27 days ( @xmath172.3 years ) is not an artifact .",
    "we also performed a similar analysis on a sinusoidal function of period 2769 days with 10%-gaussian noise .",
    "while 82% of the periods detected are 2769 days ( @xmath2810% ) , periods near @xmath29 were not detected .",
    "this analysis confirms that this secondary peak is not due to aliasing .    in fig .",
    "[ fig.gl388per ] we show the periodogram for the asas time series .",
    "we obtained prominent peaks at @xmath30 days ( fap@xmath31 ) and @xmath32 days ( fap@xmath33 ) .",
    "* since the asas data timespan is only @xmath174.5 years , periods longer than @xmath34 are also potentially significant , as indicated by high periodogram power ( fig .",
    "[ fig.gl388per ] ) .",
    "* the large number of points of this series are responsible for these extremely low faps ( see @xcite , eq",
    ". 22 ) . to check that these periods are significantly independent of the data dimension",
    ", we reduce the number of points by binning the data .",
    "we computed the monthly mean v magnitude * ( i.e .",
    "averaging on timescales much longer than @xmath35 ) * , weighted by the error reported in the asas database , and we computed the error of each mean magnitude as the square root of the variance - weighted mean ( see @xcite , eq . 9.12 ) .",
    "for this series we detected a period @xmath36 days , with a fap=@xmath37 . since we smoothed the data plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig.gl388as ] , the secondary period near @xmath17900 days is much less significant ( fap=5% ) in this periodogram .    the ca k fluxes and the mean quarterly magnitudes are plotted together in fig .  [ fig.gl388casas ] .",
    "contrary to the sun , we observe that spots dominate the emission in ad leo as it becomes fainter when the ca emission increases . on the other hand",
    ", there is an evident timelag between both chromospheric series .",
    "both datasets coincide within the normalization constant with a correlation coefficient r=0.95 , if we shift the photometry by 770 days .",
    "@xcite and @xcite have already observed this timelag between photometric and magnetic variations for stars of different spectral types ( g0v - k2v ) .",
    "@xcite showed that , when different stars are compared , this timelag is anti - correlated with effective temperature .",
    "however , the sun does not fit this relation @xcite .",
    "furthermore , here we find that ad leo does not follow this trend , similarly to what we found for other m - stars .",
    "the physical explanation for these timelags remains unknown @xcite .",
    "due both to their red color and faint intrinsical luminosity , it is quite difficult to observe the ca lines in dm stars with adequate signal - to - noise , specially for programs aiming to follow a large number of stars .",
    "therefore , it would be very convenient to find other activity indicators at longer wavelengths .",
    "since we observe simultaneously a long range of wavelenghts , our data provides an excellent opportunity to study the correlation between different spectral features and activity indexes .",
    "furthermore , the long duration of our observing program , the hk@xmath3 project , ( @xmath1714 years ) allows us to analyze if the relation between these indexes depends on the level of activity of each individual star and , therefore , if it is associated to the distribution of active regions in the stellar atmosphere .",
    "@xcite studied the na d lines ( d@xmath38  ; d@xmath39  ) in our stellar sample with casleo spectra .",
    "they constructed a spectral index ( @xmath40 ) as the ratio between the flux in the d lines and the bolometric flux .",
    "they concluded that this index , once corrected for the photospheric contribution , can be used as a chromospheric activity indicator in stars with h@xmath3 in emission . using high - resolution harps",
    "spectra , @xcite were able to integrate the d line flux in narrower windows , and , in 70% of their sample of m stars , they found a significant correlation with the ca flux , even at low activity levels .",
    "in particular , they always obtained a positive correlation for each individual star .    in fig .",
    "[ fig.gl388naca ] we plot simultaneous measurements of the @xmath40 index vs. the ca k fluxes derived from casleo spectra of ad leo . for the non - flaring points , both indexes anti - correlate with a pearson s correlation coefficient r=-0.63 .",
    "if we remove the maximum @xmath40 , a possible anticorrelation is still present , but much less significant ( r=-0.39 ) .",
    "this tendency changes during flares when both activity indicators correlate with r=0.43 .",
    "although in the sun the correlation between the ca k and h@xmath3 line - core fluxes is positive @xcite , @xcite reported that this relation is not always valid for other late stars ( f7v - m5v ) .",
    "each star shows a particular behaviour , ranging from anti - correlations to tight correlations with different slopes , including cases where no correlations are found @xcite .",
    "based on this result , studied the h@xmath3-ca relation during the solar cycle and they found that this correlation and the slope were much larger during solar maximum than during minimum . in @xcite , we show simultaneous measurements of the h@xmath3 and ca k+h fluxes for three solar analogs of different ages .",
    "although they show a low correlation for the whole series , the correlation is strongly positive during active phases .    in several m stars of our sample we found that h@xmath3 and the ca k fluxes were not correlated .@xcite studied this correlation for several m3 dwarfs , using one spectrum for each star , and found a strong positive correlation between simultaneous measurements of ca k and h@xmath3 for the most active stars , with h@xmath3 in emission , including ad leo .",
    "however , they did not analyzed this relation for individual observations of each star .",
    "here , we compute the h@xmath3 flux as the average surface flux in a 1.5  square passband centered in 6562.82  @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ fig.gl388haca ] we plot the h@xmath3 and ca k fluxes for the spectra used in fig .",
    "[ fig.gl388cas ] .",
    "both fluxes are not correlated ( r=-0.145 ) . however , as we found for solar - analogs , those points associated with high activity show a rather strong correlation , with coefficient r=0.64 , and are also correlated during flares , with r=0.65 .",
    "these points are shown as triangles in fig .",
    "[ fig.gl388haca ] .",
    "to explore the dynamo near the fully - convective boundary , we studied the long - term activity of the m3ve dwarf star ad leo ( gj 388 ) .",
    "in particular , we analyzed the ca k line - core fluxes measured on our casleo spectra obtained since 2001 , and the asas photometric data .",
    "both in the photometry and in the ca fluxes , we obtained a possible activity cycle of @xmath177 years and a less - significant shorter one of @xmath172 years with the lomb - scargle periodogram .",
    "it should be noted that we detected similar periods in two completely independent datasets .",
    "these reinforces the significance of the detection , since the probability of a false detection in both datasets should be computed as the product of both faps .",
    "the longer cycle coincides whithin the statistical errors whith the periodic variations in the flare frequency ( for energies above 10@xmath41 ergs ) reported by .",
    "furthermore , the minimum of the @xmath177-yr cycle reached in 2007 also coincides with a significant decrease in flare activity @xcite .",
    "multiple cycles have been already detected in several cool stars ( e.g. ) .",
    "for those stars later than f5 with well - determined rotation and cycle periods , @xcite examined the relation between the cycle ( @xmath42 ) and rotation frequencies ( @xmath5 ) , and found that most cycles fall into three parallel tracks , with @xmath43 , with double cycles falling in different branches .",
    "therefore , both periods are not independent .",
    "in fact , given the primary period of ad leo of around 2800 days and its rotation period of 2.23 days , saar s results imply that if this star presents a secondary cycle , its period should be around 800 days , similar to the one we obtain .",
    "a possible interpretation for this bimodal relation is that each activity cycle has different physical sources @xcite .",
    "probably two dynamos may be operating inside the star : one driven by rotational shear in the near - surface layers ( longer cycle ) and the other in the deep convection zone ( shorter cycle ) .",
    "since ad leo is a * near fully - convective * star , unlike the stars considered in @xcite , a tachocline dynamo may not be feasible in this star .",
    "since we have simultaneous observations of different spectral features we can analyze the relation between chromospheric lines formed at different depths along the activity cycle and during flares . in particular , we found evidences of a possible anticorrelation between the na index and the ca k fluxes . on the other hand , the h@xmath3 and ca fluxes show little correlation during the cycle . since the observed fluxes add the radiation coming from different magnetic structures , like spots and faculae , the resulting fluxes change during the cycle as the filling factors for each of these structures change .",
    "therefore , the correlation between fluxes can depend on each line s contrasts ( see ) .    in particular , during flares we find a positive correlation between the ca , na and h@xmath3 fluxes , suggesting that the flare - heating mechanism in operation from mid- to high - chromosphere does not change with flare strength , suggested by @xcite .",
    "m dwarfs are ideal targets to search for terrestrial planets in the habitable zone .",
    "however , their activity signatures can hinder the detection of orbiting planets .",
    "our results suggest that the level of activity will be appreciably lower during the next minimum , expected around 2015",
    ". this should be the best moment to search for planets orbiting ad leo .",
