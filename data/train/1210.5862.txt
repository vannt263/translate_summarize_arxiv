    "there is now a substantial literature focusing on the geometrical and analytical properties of self - similar fractals , which are commonly described as the unique non - empty compact subset @xmath0 satisfying @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is a finite collection of contractions on an underlying complete metric space @xmath3 .",
    "the existence and uniqueness of @xmath4 is guaranteed by an extension of the usual contraction principle for complete metric spaces ( @xcite , theorem 1.1.4 , for example ) .",
    "a fundamental problem in this area is to calculate the hausdorff dimension , @xmath5 say , of the self - similar fractal @xmath4 , and in a wide class of examples it is now known ( @xcite , corollary 1.5.9 ) that @xmath5 is the unique positive @xmath6 solving @xmath7 , where @xmath8 are the contraction ratios of @xmath2 .",
    "additionally , various stochastic versions of this result have been investigated .",
    "for example , when the underlying metric space @xmath3 is finite dimensional euclidean space , in @xcite a random self - similar set @xmath4 satisfying @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is a random ( finite or countable ) collection of scaling factors and @xmath11 are independent copies ( up to translation ) of @xmath4 , independent of @xmath10 , is constructed and ( assuming @xmath4 is non - empty and @xmath12 fulfils a non - overlapping condition ) the hausdorff dimension of @xmath4 is shown to be @xmath13-a.s .",
    "equal to the unique positive @xmath6 solving @xmath14 which obviously reduces to the deterministic equation when @xmath15 , @xmath13-a.s .",
    "note that we are assuming that all the random variables are defined on an underlying probability space with probability measure @xmath13 , and @xmath16 is the expectation under @xmath13 .",
    "a similar result was proved independently in @xcite .",
    "the aim of this article is to obtain similar hausdorff dimension results to those discussed above for a class of random self - similar trees that do not fit into the usual framework for random self - similar sets .",
    "first though , it is necessary to deal with questions concerning their construction .",
    "our starting point , rather than to define a random set directly , is to consider a fixed fractal subset of @xmath17 and build a random metric upon it .",
    "more precisely , for @xmath18 , set @xmath19 for some constant @xmath20 , and define @xmath21 to be the unique non - empty compact set satisfying @xmath22 , where we now define @xmath23 .",
    "the set @xmath21 , shown in figure [ ssd ] , is easily checked to be a _ dendrite _ , by which we mean that it is an arc - wise connected topological space containing no subset homeomorphic to the circle .",
    "although the euclidean metric is important for its construction , we are only interested in @xmath21 as a topological space .",
    "indeed , the hausdorff dimension of @xmath21 with respect to the intrinsic random metric we construct upon it can be strictly larger than 2 .",
    "( -265,50)@xmath24 ( 0,50)@xmath25    heuristically , we build a random metric on @xmath21 by first supposing that the distance between the `` edge '' from @xmath24 to @xmath25 is of length 1 .",
    "we then replace this by three randomly scaled copies of the edge with new lengths given by @xmath10 , see figure [ edgerep ] , and continue inductively to replace edges independently of each other by triples of scaled edges , with the relevant scaling factors having the same distribution as @xmath10 . as the number of inductive steps increases",
    "our discrete approximations eventually fill out a dense subset of @xmath21 , and ( under certain distributional conditions on the scaling factors ) calculating the `` limiting distance '' between points yields a metric @xmath26 on @xmath21 such that @xmath27 is a compact metric space , and the topology induced by @xmath26 on @xmath21 is the same as the original ( euclidean ) one , @xmath13-a.s .",

    ", and , as a result of this , the distance in @xmath27 between @xmath24 and @xmath25 depends , in general , on all of the steps in the inductive procedure . for reasons related to the construction of the metric @xmath26 as a so - called resistance metric",
    ", we call this limiting distance between @xmath24 and @xmath25 , @xmath34 say , a resistance perturbation .",
    "similarly , the distance between @xmath24 and @xmath35 in @xmath27 is not simply @xmath30 , but equal to @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is the resistance perturbation associated with this `` edge '' of @xmath21 and has the same distribution as @xmath34 .",
    "the fact that @xmath21 is a dendrite means that we can characterise these resistance perturbations in a convenient way that allows us to deduce their distributional properties and perform calculations with them .    in section [ dimension ] ,",
    "we provide conditions on @xmath10 that allow us to deduce the hausdorff dimension of @xmath27 . proving that the @xmath6 defined by ( [ alpha ] ) is an upper bound for the hausdorff dimension it straightforward , and requires no further conditions than those used for the construction of @xmath27 . on the other hand ,",
    "when obtaining a lower bound for the dimension of a fractal defined in a recursive fashion , it is often a problem when parts of the fractal become small too quickly , and this is the case here . for the proof in @xcite of the result described above",
    ", the underlying euclidean geometry of the random sets being considered is critical , but since our fractal trees are not embedded into any fixed metric space there is no easy translation of this argument to our setting .",
    "another common assumption for proving a hausdorff dimension lower bound and related results is that the scaling factors are bounded uniformly away from zero @xcite , @xcite .",
    "we show in theorem [ lowerboundbounded ] one application of this condition in our setting . more interestingly ,",
    "though , is that knowledge of the geometry of the trees in consideration allows us to avoid a uniform lower bound ; in fact , we shall require only that clusters of small scaling factors are not too large .",
    "we construct a random graph approximation to @xmath21 and use a percolation argument upon this to show that this is the case when the scaling factors are independent and their distributions satisfy a simple polynomial tail bound at 0 , see theorem [ hausdorfflower2 ] .",
    "let us complete the discussion of our results related to random self - similar dendrites by outlining a pair of examples .",
    "firstly , one choice of random scaling factors that does not fit into any previously studied set - up but satisfies conditions that allow us to calculate the hausdorff dimension of the fractal @xmath27 is if we suppose @xmath10 are independent identically - distributed @xmath38 random variables .",
    "it is easy to check that the hausdorff dimension is 2 in this case .",
    "note in particular that @xmath39 , @xmath13-a.s .",
    "; consequently there are indeed non - trivial resistance perturbations in this case . secondly ,",
    "although we can not calculate the hausdorff dimension using the techniques of this article , when @xmath10 are the square - roots of a dirichlet @xmath40 triple , the construction of @xmath27 is of interest in its own right .",
    "the reason for this is explained in detail in @xcite , where it is proved that in this case @xmath27 is a version of the continuum random tree of aldous , which is an important random dendrite with connections to many other stochastic tree - like objects @xcite .",
    "the family of random scaling factors that we use to construct the random metric space @xmath27 form what is known as a multiplicative cascade , which is a probabilistic structure that has been studied extensively , see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite . much of this previous work has concentrated on investigating properties of an associated tree - martingale limit ( see section [ multcasc ] for a definition ) , and we add to this body of knowledge by proving a tail bound at 0 for this random variable ( proposition [ lefttailprop ] ) .",
    "we also define the height of a ( generalised ) multiplicative cascade , and derive a simple condition that yields the finiteness of this quantity and its moments , see corollary [ heightupperbound ] and theorem [ heighttheorem ] .",
    "finally , let us remark that , although only one particular self - similar fractal dendrite is considered in this article , at the expense of some additional notation relatively minor refinements of the proofs used here allow the results we obtain to be extended to any post - critically finite self - similar fractal dendrite ( see @xcite for a definition of a post - critically finite self - similar fractal ) .",
    "a treatment of the general case appears in @xcite .",
    "we first introduce an address space to label various objects in the discussion .",
    "fix a finite index set @xmath41 , let @xmath42 , and define the `` shift - space '' of infinite sequences @xmath43 .",
    "the corresponding finite sequences are denoted by , for @xmath44 , @xmath45 where @xmath46 . for @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 ,",
    "we write @xmath50 @xmath51 and @xmath52 @xmath53 . for @xmath54 , we denote by @xmath55 the integer @xmath56 such that @xmath57 and call this the length of @xmath58 . for @xmath59 , @xmath60 , the truncation of @xmath58 to length @xmath61 is written as @xmath62 .",
    "we define a _ multiplicative cascade _ to be a family of random variables @xmath63 which take values in @xmath64 $ ] such that , for @xmath65 , the @xmath66-tuples @xmath67 are independent copies of @xmath68 .",
    "the multiplicative cascade has a naturally associated filtration @xmath69 , defined by @xmath70 . throughout our arguments",
    ", we use the function @xmath71 , for @xmath72 , which is decreasing , continuous and satisfies @xmath73    furthermore , we introduce the notation @xmath74 for @xmath75 , and @xmath76 ; and use this to define the so - called _ tree - martingale _ ( this term was coined in @xcite ) , @xmath77 , by @xmath78 .",
    "it is straightforward to check that , for each @xmath79 , @xmath80 is an @xmath69 martingale . in particular , @xmath81 by the almost sure martingale convergence theorem , this implies @xmath82 @xmath83 for some random variable , @xmath84 , with @xmath85 $ ] . by relabeling",
    ", we have the same distributional properties for the random variables , @xmath86 , defined by @xmath87 it is not difficult to check that for each @xmath56 , @xmath88 is a collection of independent , identically distributed random variables , independent of @xmath89 .",
    "we also have that the following identity holds : @xmath90    to generalise our cascade model , we introduce random perturbations of the @xmath91 , denoted by @xmath92 .",
    "we shall assume that the @xmath93 are identically distributed non - negative random variables satisfying : @xmath94 for every @xmath95 ; and also @xmath96 for all @xmath97 , where @xmath98 is taken to mean `` is independent of '' .",
    "the reason for the introduction of the factors @xmath99 will become apparent later , since perturbations with these properties arise naturally in the construction of our self - similar dendrite .",
    "we can consider the cascade model as a weighted graph tree , rooted at @xmath100 with vertex set @xmath101 and edge set @xmath102 ; where the edge @xmath103 has weight @xmath104 . for two vertices in @xmath101",
    ", we define the distance between them to be the sum of edge distances along the shortest path in the graph .",
    "we then define the _ height _ of the tree to be @xmath105 the usual definition of tree height ( the supremum of distances of vertices from the root ) actually has the sum index starting from 1 , but we shall find this slightly adjusted definition more useful in later sections .",
    "our first main result about multiplicative cascades is theorem [ mainresult ] , a simple corollary of which gives a sufficient condition for the expected height @xmath106 to be finite . in theorem",
    "[ heighttheorem ] , we deal with the unperturbed case and show that the condition is necessary in this case .",

    "@xmath194 , the galton - watson process becomes extinct with probability 1 .",
    "it follows that we can also find a multiplicative cascade with @xmath191 and @xmath195 , @xmath13-a.s .",
    "the problem of whether we have @xmath195 in the general non - trivial case is left open .    if @xmath196 , there exist random variables with @xmath142 and also @xmath197 , @xmath13-a.s . in this case",
