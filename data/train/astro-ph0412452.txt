    "multi - wavelength observations of the galactic center ( gc ) have revealed a supermassive black hole ( sbh ) and a stellar cusp surrounding it .",
    "the mass of the sbh , @xmath1 , is one of the most reliable estimates for massive black holes at the centers of galaxies .",
    "the stellar population within 1pc of the sbh contains a variety of young and massive stars .",
    "some of them are only about 20myr old and get as close as a few light days to the sbh ; while from 0.1 to 0.4pc even younger stars are found with ages 3 to 7myr .",
    "the presence of these young stars in the immediate vicinity of the sbh poses a problem known as the _ youth paradox_. their _ in situ _ formation is problematic since the sbh has a strong tidal influence in this region .",
    "however , the time required for the migration of these stars from @xmath2 by dynamical friction would exceed their inferred ages , unless the migration rate is somehow accelerated .",
    "in addition to their youth , these stars exhibit some peculiar dynamical properties .",
    "one of them is strong clustering .",
    "the sources irs  16 and irs  13 were initially thought to be single sources but later resolved into multiple components .",
    "irs  16 is a collection of young ( 37 myr ) he  i emission - line stars lying @xmath3@xmath4 in projection from sgr a@xmath5 .",
    "they form a co - moving group that is counter - rotating with respect to the galaxy .",
    "irs  13 is another complex , composed of hot bright stars , about @xmath6 south - west of sgr a@xmath5 . in particular ,",
    "irs  13e is a compact , massive star cluster which is a few million years old @xcite .",
    "@xcite and @xcite find that the young he  i emission - line stars in the vicinity of sgr a@xmath5 are all concentrated in two disks , forming two co - moving ( but not gravitationally bound ) populations .",
    "in addition to the clustering , stars within @xmath7 of sgr a@xmath5 , which are about 10myr old , seem to have higher than normal eccentricities @xcite , but this anomaly may be explained by selection effects @xcite .",
    "one possible explanation for the presence of these young stars is that they are not young but _ rejuvenated_. a possible path to rejuvenation , stellar mergers , is shown not to be viable by @xcite .",
    "another path , squeezars , heating of stars by close tidal encounters with the sbh also fails to explain the observed population @xcite .    aside from rejuvenation ,",
    "another possible scenario , especially suggested by the observations of the two counter rotating and coeval disks of young stars around the sbh , is the infall and collision of two molecular clouds in the vicinity of the sbh .",
    "such a collision may provide the required densities for star formation .",
    "@xcite suggest that the stars resulting from the two colliding clouds will form two co - moving populations .",
    "however , since a collision leading to high densities will be highly inelastic , it is not clear that two distinct populations will form . to our knowledge",
    ", the collision and further evolution of dense clouds in the vicinity of a sbh has never been studied in detail .",
    "so , it is hard to decide whether this is a viable scenario .",
    "a possibility that we investigate in this paper is the inspiral of a star cluster by dynamical friction , as suggested by @xcite .",
    "@xcite carried out @xmath8-body simulations to study this scenario . the clusters in their simulations disrupted at @xmath2 from the gc ,",
    "so can not explain the presence the young star population very close to sgr a@xmath5 .",
    "@xcite , again using @xmath8-body simulations , concluded that , for a cluster to reach within the central parsec , it must either be very massive ( @xmath9 ) or have formed near the gc ( at @xmath10 ) .",
    "they found that , in both cases , a very high central density ( @xmath11 ) is required , and concluded that this scenario is implausible .",
    "@xcite suggested that the presence of an intermediate - mass black hole ( imbh ) can stabilize a cluster so that survival all the way to within the central parsec can be achieved with much lower central densities .",
    "in addition , they suggested that an imbh  sbh binary can perturb the young stars into radial orbits with small semi - major axes in a way similar to the jupiter  sun system creating short period comets @xcite .",
    "@xcite performed @xmath8-body simulations similar to those of @xcite but with an additional imbh embedded in the inspiraling cluster .",
    "they found that an imbh does decrease the requirement for a high central density , but its mass must be about 10% of the total cluster mass .",
    "since this is much larger than estimates of the collapsed core mass in dynamical simulations ( 0.1 - 0.2% ; see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) they concluded that a realistic imbh can not help transport young stars into the central parsec .",
    "however , after core collapse , the central object can continue to grow by colliding with the stars that migrate to the center by relaxation .",
    "this growth continues until the massive stars start evolving off the main sequence and lead to cluster expansion by mass loss through winds and supernovae @xcite .    using our dynamical monte carlo code ,",
    "we have carried out simulations where we form an imbh through runaway collisions following core collapse during the cluster s inspiral towards the gc .",
    "we discussed some initial results in a previous paper @xcite . here",
    "we present all our results from simulations of dense star clusters near the gc using a more realistic galactic mass distribution .",
    "we investigate the initial conditions required for these clusters to reach the gc within 310 myr _ and _ undergo core collapse before disruption . in 2 we describe our numerical technique for cluster simulations and the inspiral mechanism .",
    "we present some semi - analytic calculations in 3 , and the results of our full simulations in 4 .",
    "we discuss these results and present our conclusions in 5 .",
    "for our simulations , we use a monte carlo technique , which provides an ideal compromise in terms of speed and accuracy .",
    "it has the star - by - star nature of the @xmath8-body techniques but incorporates physical assumptions which lead to simplifications , reducing the computation time . as a result , we can carry out simulations of systems with @xmath12 stars in @xmath13 cpu hours . for details of our method",
    ", we refer to our previous work ( see @xcite and references therein for basics , and @xcite for treatment of the realistic mass functions ) . here",
    "we only explain in detail the additions to our code for this paper .      for the initial mass function ( imf )",
    "we implemented a salpeter distribution , @xmath14 , with @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "other choices of imf , e.g. , miller - scalo or kroupa , do not change the core collapse time , as long as @xmath17 @xcite .    for the initial structure of our clusters we chose king models ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter 4 ) .",
    "this choice allows us to implement the initial tidal cutoff in a natural way .",
    "in addition , the rate of evolution of the system , which is determined by the central relaxation time @xcite , can be adjusted by a single parameter , the dimensionless central potential @xmath18 . for the sake of simplicity",
    "we chose the tidal radius of the king model equal to the jacobi radius of the cluster .",
    "( see [ ssec_tidal_truncation ] )    throughout this paper we use standard fokker - planck units @xcite : @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is newton s gravitational constant , @xmath21 is the initial total mass of the cluster , and @xmath22 is the initial total energy .",
    "the conversion to physical units is done by calculating the physical mass of the system , and identifying the tidal radius of the king model used with the jacobi radius .",
    "various length and time scales of king models are given in table 1 of @xcite .",
    "in the continuum limit , when a cluster undergoes core collapse , the central density becomes infinite in a finite time .",
    "in addition to being unphysical , high densities require small timesteps and render the dynamical evolution of the system impossible to follow numerically .",
    "when various physical processes and the finite radii of stars are taken into account , the central density can not increase indefinitely .",
    "this can result from energy generation by `` three - body binaries '' ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) , `` burning '' of primordial binaries ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) or physical collisions .",
    "for the young dense clusters we consider here , we expect energy generation from binary formation or binary burning to play a minor role , since for these systems , an interaction with a hard binary is likely to lead to a merger @xcite .",
    "the local collision time , i.e. , the average time after which a star has experienced one collision , is given by @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the velocity dispersion , @xmath25 is the number density of stars , @xmath26 and @xmath27 are the radius and the mass of the star under consideration . in the systems we consider in this paper , @xmath28 is larger than the lifetime of the cluster except for the stars participating in the core collapse .",
    "we used an approximation to exploit this property . rather than treating collisions explicitly as in @xcite",
    ", we introduced a simple boundary condition near the center of the cluster : when a star is part of the collapsing core , we add its mass to a growing central point mass and remove it from the simulation .",
    "this central point mass is then used only during the calculation of the cluster gravitational potential .",
    "we determine whether a star is part of the collapsing core by monitoring its orbit s apocenter .",
    "we have chosen this criterion rather than one based on pericenter or instantaneous position to guarantee that the stars under consideration are restricted to a small region near the center .",
    "the threshold value we have chosen for the apocenter distance is @xmath29 in fokker - planck units . for our models ,",
    "@xmath28 within this radius is @xmath30yr , i.e. , all stars restricted to this region will rapidly undergo collisions .",
    "we determined the threshold value empirically . choosing a large value leads to removal of stars from the system before core collapse .",
    "choosing a very small value is also problematic because of the very short collision times .",
    "if collisions are not taken into account , a few massive stars sinking to the center of the cluster could easily reach energies comparable to the total energy of the cluster and have a substantial effect on the evolution of the system ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "we found that threshold values in the range @xmath31@xmath32 generally avoid these problems and @xmath29 is a number suitable for all the clusters we simulated .",
    "we compared the rate of growth of the central mass in our simulations with results from other monte carlo simulations where collisions between the stars are treated more realistically @xcite .",
    "we found that we typically underestimate the rate of growth slightly , by 20 to 30% .",
    "we have also compared the evolution of the average mass among the innermost 5000 stars and found that , in our simulations , the increase in average mass slightly lags behind , but reaches the same final value .",
    "this is probably related to the slower growth of the central mass in our code .",
    "it is not possible to determine which results are more accurate as these simulations can not be repeated with more direct methods . in any case",
    "we do not expect this small difference to affect our results significantly .      during the course of our simulations",
    ", we remove the stars that gain positive energies because of interactions , or whose apocenter lies beyond the cluster s tidal radius .",
    "this tidal radius depends on the mass distribution in the gc region and the cluster s current position .",
    "the tidal radius of the cluster can be estimated by using the following expression for the jacobi radius @xmath33^{1/3 } r \\ , , \\ ] ] where @xmath34 is the bound mass of the cluster , @xmath35 is the distance from the gc , and @xmath36 is the mass within a circular orbit at this radius .",
    "the latest estimate for the galactic mass distribution near the central bh is given by @xcite .",
    "they estimate the _ stellar _ mass density as a broken power law , @xmath37 with @xmath38 for @xmath39 , @xmath40 for @xmath41 , and @xmath42 .",
    "this mass distribution is a self - consistent description that goes all the way from 0.1 to about 10 pc , but much farther than that it may underestimate the stellar density ( tal alexander , private communication ) .",
    "we derive the formulae for dynamical friction on a point mass , resulting from a broken power law mass density distribution and an additional central bh of mass @xmath43 @xcite , in appendix  [ app_1 ] . as a result of the dynamical friction , the distance of the cluster from the gc changes continuously ; we include the effect of this change by adjusting @xmath44 appropriately in our simulations .    in principle , the treatment we use for dynamical friction is valid only for point masses and extended clusters require a modification of this treatment .",
    "however , the finite size affects only the coulomb logarithm in equation [ eq_fric_acc ] , and , as long as the size of the cluster ( @xmath45 ) is small with respect to the size of the region that contributes to the dynamical friction , this leads only to a small decrease in the drag on the cluster @xcite .",
    "since this condition is always satisfied in our simulations , we do not expect our results to be affected by this approximation .",
    "@xcite established numerically the validity of the formulation we use by making comparisons to more exact @xmath8-body simulations .",
    "for a point mass , the time required to reach the gc from an initial distance @xmath46 can be calculated by integrating equations ( [ eq_dim_dec ] ) and ( [ eq_spi_in2 ] ) . since equation ( [ eq_dim_dec ] )",
    "has a logarithmic singularity near the origin , for the calculations below , we stop the integration at @xmath47 .",
    "most of the mass loss from the cluster takes place near the center , so neglecting the mass loss provides a reasonable first estimate for the inspiral time , @xmath48 .",
    "possible upper limits for @xmath48 are 3 or 10 myr , which are about the lifetimes of the brightest ir stars observed near the gc . by requiring the cluster to undergo core collapse before reaching the gc , we can also obtain a lower limit for @xmath48 .",
    "this can be transformed into a condition on the initial structure of the cluster using @xmath49 @xcite , where @xmath50 is the initial central relaxation time .",
    "we illustrate these constraints in figure [ fig_const ] .",
    "the solid lines correspond to the upper limits on @xmath48 from the stellar evolution timescale . above these lines",
    "it takes more than the denoted time ( 3 or 10 myr ) to reach 0.01 pc for a point mass .",
    "the bow - like dashed lines correspond to lower limits for various king models . to the right of these lines ,",
    "the inspiral time for a point mass is shorter than the core collapse time , hence runaway collisions can not happen unless the system is initially collisional .",
    "for these calculations we have computed the timescales for the king models by assuming their tidal radius is initially equal to their jacobi radius given in equation [ eq_rj ] . in this figure",
    "we also show results of some of our simulations ( see next section ) .",
    "the next step in approximation is using a realistic structure for the cluster but neglecting the changes in structure during the inspiral .",
    "since the structure changes on a relaxation timescale and in the outer parts of the cluster the relaxation time is much longer than the inspiral time , this approximation provides a good estimate for the mass loss during the inspiral , at least until close to disruption .",
    "we have computed the rate of inspiral of different king models for different initial distances from the gc and initial cluster masses .",
    "we present our results for initial distance @xmath51 in figure  [ fig_r_vs_t ] . during the inspiral we calculate the change in bound mass as follows .",
    "first we calculate the tidal radius by using the current mass and distance from the gc by equation  ( [ eq_rj ] ) . from this and the structure of the given king model",
    "a new bound mass is calculated .",
    "this procedure is repeated until the bound mass converges to a value .",
    "failure of convergence marks the disruption .    in figures [ fig_r_vs_t ] and [ fig_rdis_vs_w0 ]",
    "we show the results of our calculations for extended clusters .",
    "unlike a point - mass , an extended cluster disrupts at a finite distance from the gc , @xmath52 .",
    "this distance decreases as more of the cluster s mass is concentrated near its center , but is independent of the total mass in the cluster .",
    "the inspiral time , on the other hand , has a strong dependence on the total mass .",
    "the independence of @xmath52 from total mass can be understood as follows . for a given @xmath18 ,",
    "the disruption happens when the tidal radius reaches a specific fraction of the initial jacobi radius .",
    "the relation between this value and the distance from the gc is independent of the initial cluster mass , since more massive clusters start with a proportionately larger initial jacobi radius .",
    "this is also the main reason for the dependence of @xmath52 on initial distance .",
    "note that , in principle , a cluster can underfill its jacobi radius at formation , i.e. , clusters formed at large distances can have the same size as the clusters formed close to the gc .",
    "the disruption radii we obtain in this approximation are upper limits since mass segregation , the formation of a cusp , and the subsequent imbh will all increase the mass concentration towards the center .",
    "these calculations show that for a wide region of @xmath53 parameter space it is plausible that a cluster can reach to within a fraction of a parsec of the gc in a few million years .",
    "a high initial concentration ( @xmath54 ) is required for the cluster not to disrupt too far from the gc , as well as to guarantee rapid core collapse .",
    "more detailed simulations are required to verify and establish these findings , and to obtain the demographics of the stars that reach the gc . to illustrate this point",
    ", we present a comparison of point - mass and extended cluster models with a full simulation ( model5c , see next section ) in figure  [ fig_comp_three ] .",
    "all calculations presented in this figure start with the same initial mass and initial distance from the gc .",
    "this comparison shows that the effects of dynamical evolution , namely the enhanced mass loss due to expansion , can be quite important .",
    "note that , for clusters with lower initial concentrations , the relaxation will be slower and the difference between full simulation and the extended static model will be smaller .",
    "however the deviations from the point - mass approximation will be larger .",
    "we have performed simulations starting with king models of dimensionless central potentials @xmath55 at a variety of distances and initial masses .",
    "we present our results in table  [ tab_sim_res ] .",
    "we ended our simulations when the number of stars in the cluster dropped to 0.5% of its initial value .",
    "we defined this as the point of disruption and denoted the time to reach this point and distance from gc with @xmath56 and @xmath52 , respectively .",
    "allowing the cluster to evolve beyond this point will not change our results since , at this point , the mass is so low that dynamical friction is no longer effective , and the distance from the gc remains constant .",
    "in addition , as a result of the low number of stars , relaxation and the consequent evaporation of the cluster will be very rapid .",
    "most of the clusters with high initial concentration went into core collapse before disruption and the central point mass described in [ sec_num_tech ] grew during the inspiral .",
    "this accumulated mass is indicated in column 7 of our table . for less dense clusters , the inspiral is faster than the core collapse and in those cases no central point mass is grown .",
    "we did not observe significant post - core - collapse expansion in our simulations .",
    "the growth of the central mass indicates that segregation of massive stars continue beyond the core collapse .",

    "however , this is not true for @xmath52 , which is dependent on the total initial mass for an evolving cluster .",
    "this dependence is a result of the interplay between inspiral time and relaxation time . for a massive cluster containing a large number of stars ,",
    "the inspiral time is short but the relaxation time is long .",
    "hence only the central part of the cluster has time to evolve . for a less massive cluster",
    "the outer parts have time to evolve and expand . as a result ,",
    "the mass loss is enhanced and the disruption happens at a further distance from the gc .",
    "in figure [ fig_const ] we plot the results of some our simulations to compare with point - mass estimates .",
    "we have only plotted models where disruption distance from the gc was small . for models started with @xmath62 , only the ones within 1pc of the gc ; and for the others only the ones disrupted within 2pc of gc are plotted .",
    "we have used black symbols for models with @xmath63 , and gray symbols ( colored red in the online version ) otherwise .",

    "can not be compensated by the increase in central density of the cluster , and leads to disruption happening earlier and/or further from the gc than indicated by the semi - analytical methods .",
    "it is not possible to resolve the core - collapse criterion , indicated by dashed lines in figure [ fig_const ] , for @xmath64 models as is done for @xmath65 case . for @xmath66 ,",
    "the boundary is at low initial mass which correspond to low number of stars .",
    "such clusters have short relaxation times and hence expand and disrupt rapidly before going into core collapse unless they start far from the gc .",
    "in contrast , the boundary for @xmath67 lies at high initial mass and large number of particles , making the simulations of such clusters computationally impractical .",
    "another trend that can be seen in table  [ tab_sim_res ] is that more mass is accumulated at the center for clusters that start at larger distances from the gc .",
    "this is simply because there is more time available for the mass buildup .",
    "this does not necessarily mean that a heavier imbh will be formed in these systems , as the fate of a very massive star being bombarded by other stars is not certain . also ,",
    "being the total available mass , this is strictly an _ upper limit _ to rather than an estimate of the imbh mass .    in the rest of this section we present an analysis of the evolution of our model 5c",

    "after core collapse the central mass grew to a value @xmath71 , which is consistent with the estimate , @xmath72 , by @xcite .",
    "the disruption of the cluster took place at @xmath73 from the gc .      during the inspiral ,",
    "stars become unbound from the cluster as a result of the shrinking jacobi radius .",
    "we present the mass distribution of these stars with respect to their distance from the gc in figure  [ fig_r_vs_m0 ] , and the number of massive stars that leave the cluster within each distance bin in figure  [ fig_r_vs_n ] . in these figures",
    "it is seen that the massive stars leave the cluster predominantly near disruption .",
    "this is because of mass segregation , but also because most stars leave the cluster near disruption and there are relatively few massive stars .",
    "as expected , the average mass of the stars that leave the cluster ( indicated by the white line in figure  [ fig_r_vs_m0 ] ) slightly decreases throughout the inspiral ( see also fig .  7 of @xcite ) .",
    "as the cluster evolves , massive stars sink towards the cluster center , leaving behind less massive stars which are preferentially removed .",
    "our choice of initial conditions ( requirement of core collapse before the end of inspiral ) allows massive stars to segregate faster than the shrinking of the jacobi radius because of the inspiral , so most of them remain bound throughout .",
    "we present the surface density of initial masses of the stars that leave the cluster and compare this with the assumed mass density profile of the galaxy in figure [ fig_surf_den_prof ] . throughout the inspiral",
    ", the contribution to the background surface density is small .",
    "the only detectable signature of a cluster inspiral will be the stars left behind that are significantly more massive and hence brighter than the stars of the galactic background distribution .",
    "near disruption , the cluster forms a power - law cusp , @xmath74 , around the central point mass .",
    "we estimated the power - law exponent to be @xmath75 , which is compatible with the results of theoretical calculations @xcite and @xmath8-body simulations @xcite which yield a value @xmath76 .    the mass function of the stars in this cusp is quite different from the salpeter imf which we adopted at @xmath77 .",
    "the heavy part of the mass function is more populated because of mass segregation , even though the massive stars are preferentially removed via mergers with the central point mass .",
    "we show a comparison of the mass function for the innermost 2000 stars with the salpeter imf in figure [ fig_mass_functions ] .    at disruption , the density of stars from the cluster exceeds the density of background stars .",
    "the ( 3-d ) velocity dispersion at disruption is about 90 kms@xmath78 .",
    "since this is much smaller than the velocities near the gc , the stars would stay together and be observed as a clump , similar to the central cluster @xcite , or the rotating disk - like structures observed by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "additionally , the stars which lie very close to the imbh will remain bound to it longer than the stars lying outside , since these stars will be on keplerian orbits and their relaxation time will be longer , preventing the expansion of the cluster . such a collection of stars may exhibit a structure similar to that of the irs  13e cluster observed by @xcite .",
    "it is not possible to follow reliably the evolution of the cluster near disruption with our method , for several reasons .",
    "when the number of stars decreases to a very small value ( @xmath79 , see @xcite , 2.4.1 ) , the relaxation time becomes comparable to the dynamical time , making it necessary to take the effect of large - angle scatterings into account",
    ". this would be possible in principle , by incorporating these interactions into the monte carlo scheme in a way similar to collisions @xcite , if the rate of these events were low and the relaxation was still the dominant process for the evolution of the cluster .",
    "however , in this regime , the dynamical evolution , in particular the evaporation , of the cluster will not progress on a relaxation timescale and will depend sensitively on these large - angle scatterings .",
    "in addition , as the stars leave the cluster , the potential will get shallower . as a result , the restoring force on the central black hole , which keeps it near the cluster center , will decrease and its wandering will increase ( which we do not model ) .",
    "the central parsec of our galaxy hosts many young stars whose presence there poses a problem because of the unfavorable conditions for their formation .",
    "the range of age estimates and the peculiar dynamical properties ( disk - like structures , clustering , possibility of larger than normal eccentricities ) suggest that there is more than one mechanism at play . in this paper",
    "we consider one of the possibilities .",
    "we investigated whether it is possible to explain the presence of the young massive stars near the gc by bringing them there as members of a cluster . at the same time , we want this cluster to form an imbh , which can then make the stars in its vicinity migrate to inner orbits very near sgr a@xmath5 .",
    "this scenario requires : ( 1 ) rapid inspiral of the cluster , @xmath80 ; ( 2 ) the disruption to take place close to the gc , @xmath81 ; ( 3 ) the cluster to undergo core collapse during the inspiral to form an imbh .",
    "our work extends that of @xcite and @xcite , who carried out semi - analytical calculations , and of @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , who used @xmath8-body simulations of dense clusters spiraling into the gc .    to determine the initial conditions suitable for this scenario",
    ", we carried out semi - analytical calculations and dynamical monte carlo simulations .",
    "a comparison of the results obtained by these methods showed that the change in the cluster structure has a considerable influence on the disruption distance .",
    "following the evolution of the cluster also allowed us to draw conclusions about the demographics of the stars left behind and brought into the central parsec .",
    "the expansion of the outer parts of the cluster because of the relaxation enhances the mass loss and leads to earlier disruption .",
    "our simulations show that for clusters with @xmath82 , an initial mass of at least @xmath83 is necessary .",
    "this is in agreement with the findings of @xcite .",
    "we also found that high concentrations ( @xmath54 ) are required to undergo core collapse during the inspiral .",
    "however , if the core collapse requirement is relaxed , clusters with moderate concentrations ( @xmath84 ) can also survive the inspiral down to @xmath85 , starting with @xmath82 and @xmath86 .",
    "this is because core collapse requires significant relaxation and clusters with low concentration can not survive the accompanying expansion .",
    "the density of the stars that leave the cluster during the inspiral is generally small compared to the galactic background density , except near disruption .",
    "almost all the massive stars that leave the cluster during the inspiral do so near disruption . as a result of the mass segregation ,",
    "most of the cluster mass close to the imbh is in heavy ( @xmath87 ) stars . upon disruption",
    ", these stars will end up on orbits close to the imbh . as a result of their proximity",
    ", they can then undergo strong interactions with the imbh and possibly get scattered into orbits closer to the gc . if such clusters harboring imbhs regularly form in the gc region , the central parsec may be hosting more than one imbh and this process can be realized by participation of multiple imbhs .",
    "the age spread of the young stars in the central parsec ( @xmath88310myr ) implies that there has been more than one instance of star formation in the recent history of the gc region .",
    "although the discussion in this paper has focused on our galactic center , these ideas also have important consequences for other galaxies and for extragalactic astrophysics .",
    "the direct injection into the center of a galaxy of many imbhs produced by collisional runaways in nearby young star clusters provides a potential new channel for building up the mass of a central sbh through massive bh mergers @xcite .",
    "in contrast , minor mergers of galaxies are unlikely to produce massive bh mergers , as the smaller bh will rarely experience enough dynamical friction to spiral in all the way to the center of the more massive galaxy @xcite .",
    "our scenario has important consequences for lisa , the laser - interferometer space antenna , since the inspiral of an imbh into a sbh provides an opportunity for direct study of strong field gravity and for testing general relativity @xcite .",
    "although the sbhs found in bright quasars and many nearby galactic nuclei are thought to have grown mainly by gas accretion ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , current models suggest that lisa will probe most efficiently a cosmological massive bh population of lower mass , which is largely undetected @xcite .",
    "lisa will measure their masses with exquisite accuracy , and their mass spectrum will constrain formation scenarios for high - redshift , low - mass galaxies and , more generally , hierarchical models of galaxy formation ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the main difficulty with our scenario is the requirement of large initial cluster masses for rapid inspiral from @xmath82 .",
    "a massive ( @xmath89 ) cluster with a salpeter imf will contain a larger number of massive stars than currently observed at the gc region , both within and outside the central parsec .",
    "in particular , outside the central parsec , only a few young stars have been observed @xcite , whereas we predict a larger number of these stars would have left the cluster during inspiral .",
    "there are multiple ways to resolve this problem , but it is not possible to determine by observation which , if any , of these mechanisms is most important .",
    "one of them is the formation of a cluster with a steeper imf at the higher mass end , hence suppressing the number of massive stars .",
    "the upper mass cutoff we have chosen ( @xmath90 ) is equivalent to introducing a steep imf @xcite , but even more conservative choices are plausible ( p.  kroupa , private communication ) .",
    "the requirement of a large initial mass is somewhat relaxed if the cluster is initially on an eccentric orbit @xcite . in this paper , we only considered circular orbits , so the mass requirements we find can be seen as upper limits .",
    "the problem of many young stars leaving the cluster during inspiral would be largely avoided by the presence of _ initial _ mass segregation , which is supported both by observations and theoretical arguments @xcite . if the most massive members of the cluster start their life closer to the center , they will have less of a chance to leave the cluster outside the central parsec .",
    "we also note that the lack of observed young stars outside the central parsec could also result from higher extinction in this region ( f.  yusef - zadeh , private communication ) .",
    "the initial mass function of the arches cluster is thought to be significantly shallower than the salpeter mass function @xcite .",
    "if a cluster is formed with a such an imf , the central mass will grow faster and larger , since there are more massive stars .",
    "this may decrease the required total mass of the cluster , at the expense of increasing the fraction of mass in massive stars , since a larger central object can support a cluster more efficiently .",
    "we carried out a few simulations with shallower imfs , power - law mass functions with @xmath91 . to make a fair comparison",
    ", we kept the total mass and the total number of stars in these cluster the same as in our salpeter imf models , and hence modified the minimum mass in the cluster .",
    "this way , the relaxation time is kept constant , and the rate of expansion is expected to be similar for different imfs .",
    "we found that , even though central masses up to twice as large were grown , the changes in the disruption distance were very small in these simulations .",
    "we conclude that growing a large enough central mass to have significant impact on this scenario (  10% of initial",
    "total cluster mass * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is not possible by a modification of the imf .",
    "note that the mass function of the innermost 2000 stars at cluster disruption ( fig .",
    "[ fig_mass_functions ] ) , a result of the mass segregation , is very similar to what is observed in the arches cluster ( * ? ? ?",
    "this indicates that the shallowness of the current mass function of the arches can be explained by dynamical evolution , without the need for a shallow imf .",
    "the young compact cluster irs  13e observed near the gc region provides strong support for the cluster inspiral scenario .",
    "this cluster has a projected diameter of @xmath92 and is at a projected distance of @xmath6 from sgr a@xmath5 .",
    "its members have a common proper motion with velocity @xmath93 and no apparent common radial velocity , putting the cluster on an eccentric orbit .",
    "from these data @xcite conclude that there is an imbh at the center of this cluster with mass @xmath887501300@xmath94 .",
    "it is possible that these stars are the central part of a larger cluster as in the five bright stars in the quintuplet cluster , but @xmath8-body simulations show that such a cluster , consisting of about 2000 stars , will rapidly experience core collapse ( @xmath95 ; h.  baumgardt , private communication ) .",
    "even if there is no imbh in the irs  13e cluster , its presence is a strong indication that clustered star formation took place in the last few million years in the gc region , close enough to sgr a@xmath5 that part of the cluster is now within the central parsec of the galaxy .",
    "@xcite proposed that the young population observed very close ( @xmath96 ) to sgr a@xmath5 are stars which reached this region on radial orbits and displaced stellar mass black holes that reside there .",
    "@xcite suggested that a member of this population , s0 - 2 , is the remnant of a massive binary on an eccentric orbit which got disrupted by the supermassive black hole .",
    "these scenarios naturally complement the one we investigate in this paper .",
    "the stars scattered by the imbh will end up on radial orbits and can further interact with and displace the stellar - mass black holes , or , if they are binaries , they can get disrupted while on these orbits .",
    "this will leave them on less eccentric orbits with smaller semimajor axes .",
    "the orbits of stars in the vicinity of an inspiraling imbh have recently been investigated numerically by @xcite , who showed that eccentric orbits with very small apocenter distances are possible if the inspiraling imbh is on an eccentric orbit .    despite these numerical investigations by @xcite ,",
    "the final fate of a cluster with an imbh , which disrupts within the central parsec , remains highly uncertain .",
    "more theoretical work is needed to understand both the final phases of the disruption and the interaction of the imbh with the surrounding stars .",
    "further observations of the gc , in particular proper motion measurements of the closest stars to understand their eccentricity distribution , and higher resolution observations of the irs  13e cluster to resolve its structure and dynamics , will put constraints on the various scenarios proposed .",
    "we thank tal alexander and andrea ghez for discussions about the mass distribution near the gc , holger baumgardt for providing his simulation results prior to publication , marc freitag , milo milosavljevi ' c , brad hansen and casey law for useful discussions , emrah kalemci for help with the preparation of some of the figures , and ruadhan oflanagan for comments on the manuscript .",

    "in this appendix we derive the formulae for the inspiral rate @xmath97 of a point mass , given a broken power - law galactic mass distribution @xmath98 , and an additional central point mass @xmath99 .",
    "we use @xmath42 to denote the breaking radius , and the subscripts @xmath100 and @xmath101 for regions @xmath39 and @xmath41 respectively .",
    "we follow and generalize the method of ( * ? ? ?",
