    "cold dark matter ( cdm ) models of structure formation have been remarkably successful in explaining a wide range of observations at both low and high redshifts . however , high resolution n - body simulations of the cdm model have revealed two potential conflicts with observations .",
    "first , the inner mass density profiles of simulated halos are cuspy , as opposed to the shallow profiles inferred from the rotation curves of dwarfs and low surface brightness galaxies ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; but see van den bosch et al .",
    "1999 ) , and the observations of soft cores in galaxy clusters by gravitational lensing ( @xcite ) .",
    "second , group - sized halos in simulations contain a large number of low mass subhalos , greatly in excess of the observed number of satellite galaxies in the local group ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "a variety of mechanisms have been proposed recently to reduce the clustering of mass on small scales , while simultaneously retaining the large scale successes of the cdm model .",
    "these mechanisms include breaking the scale invariance of the power spectrum of primordial density fluctuations ( @xcite ) , postulating different collapse histories for dark matter and baryons ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , and modifying the nature of dark matter .",
    "the last option includes dark matter models with a variety of properties  self - interacting ( @xcite ) , warm ( @xcite ) repulsive ( @xcite ) , fluid ( @xcite ) , and fuzzy ( @xcite ) .    in the warm dark matter",
    "( wdm ) model , the linear power spectrum is exponentially damped on scales smaller than the free - streaming length of the warm particle , @xmath2 , relative to the pure cdm model ( @xcite ) .",
    "here , @xmath3 is the ratio of wdm density to the critical density , @xmath4 is the mass of the wdm particle , and @xmath5 is the hubble parameter .",
    "non - linear gravitational evolution transfers power from large scales to small scales , so the clustering of the highly nonlinear mass distribution is insensitive to the shape of the linear power spectrum below the non - linear scale ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "conversely , absorbers seen in the spectra of high redshift ( @xmath6 ) quasars arise from mass density fluctuations in the quasi - linear regime ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , so their properties remain sensitive to the linear power spectrum . in this @xmath7 , we set a lower limit on the mass of wdm particle by requiring that there be enough small scale power in the initial conditions to reproduce the observed properties of the forest at @xmath1 .",
    "we study the forest in both cdm and wdm models with @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , and @xmath12 , where @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the contributions from total mass , vacuum energy , and baryons to the total energy density of the universe , and @xmath16 is the rms density fluctuation in @xmath17 spheres , chosen here to reproduce the observed cluster abundance ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "table 1 lists the parameters of all models investigated .",
    "our wdm models have @xmath18 and @xmath19 ev ( corresponding to @xmath20 ) , spanning the range of wdm masses required to match the phase space density of dark matter cores in disk galaxies and dwarf spheroidal galaxies ( @xcite and references therein ; @xcite ) we also analyze a broken scale invariance model ( bsi , @xcite ) , using an analytic fit to its power spectrum from white & croft ( 2000 ) , with a filtering scale @xmath21 required to fit the observed number density of low mass satellite galaxies in the local group .",

    "we assume the usual three massless neutrino species with a present - day temperature @xmath26 k , and treat the wdm component as a fourth ( massive ) species with @xmath27 .",
    "fifty legendre moments are used to follow the evolution of the wdm phase space .",
    "we compared our wdm power spectra with the fitting function of bardeen et al .",
    "( 1986 ) and find that their formula provides a reasonable approximation for @xmath28 [ if a baryon - corrected shape parameter @xmath29 is used ] , but it overestimates the power spectrum by up to an order of magnitude at higher @xmath30 .",
    "we employ a particle - mesh ( pm ) n - body code that is described in detail in steed et al .",
    "( in preparation ) .",
    "this code computes forces using a staggered mesh ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , and integrates the equations of motion using the leapfrog scheme described in quinn et al .",
    "our periodic simulation volume has @xmath31mpc , with @xmath32 particles and an @xmath33 force mesh .",
    "we assign initial displacements and velocities to the particles using the zeldovich approximation . in the wdm models",
    ", we also add a randomly oriented streaming velocity component that is drawn from a fermi - dirac distribution with an rms velocity , @xmath34 we evolve from redshift @xmath35 in 24 equal steps of the expansion scale factor .",
    "figure 1 shows the linear and non - linear power spectrum of the mass density field at @xmath1 in different models .",
    "the differences between different models are significantly smaller in the non - linear power spectra , compared to the differences in their linear theory power spectra , because non - linear gravitational evolution has regenerated power on small scales . nevertheless , power transfer is not entirely successful in erasing the differences between the power spectra of different models .",
    "thus , at @xmath1 , the wdm200 model has almost an order of magnitude less power on small scales compared to the cdm model , while the models wdm500 , wdm750 , and bsik02 are all deficient by @xmath36  dex .",
    "we also ran these models with a @xmath37 box using the same @xmath38 and @xmath39 , and found similar results on overlapping length scales .",
    "the model cdm200 has the same linear power spectrum as wdm200 , but @xmath40 .",
    "this model gives virtually identical results to the wdm200 model , showing that the velocity dispersion of wdm particles has a negligible effect on the forest at @xmath1 .",
    "hence , we do not show the results for this model in the figures .",
    "the forest arises from a continuous , fluctuating , low - density @xmath41 $ ] gaseous medium whose temperature is determined by the balance between photoionization heating by the uv background and adiabatic cooling due to hubble expansion ( see e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "photoionization equilibrium leads to a power - law relation between temperature and gas density , of the form @xmath42 , with @xmath43 , and @xmath44 ( @xcite ) .",
    "the optical depth to photons ( @xmath45 ) is proportional to gas density , which in turn is proportional to @xmath46 for gas in photoionization equilibrium near @xmath47 .",
    "pressure gradients in this low - density , fairly cool ( @xmath48 k ) gas are small , so gas traces dark matter ( @xcite ) .",
    "hence , the gas density - temperature relation can be translated into a relation between mass density @xmath49 and @xmath45 ( the  fluctuating gunn - peterson approximation \" , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "thus , the transmitted flux of photons @xmath50 $ ] in a quasar spectrum is a map of the mass density fluctuations along the line of sight .",
    "we extract artificial absorption spectra along 400 random lines of sight through each simulation , using the tipsy package ( @xcite ; see http://www-hpcc.astro.washington.edu/tools/tipsy ) .",
    "tipsy calculates the local mass density @xmath49 at the position of each dark matter particle using a cubic spline smoothing kernel ( hernquist & katz 1989 ) enclosing 32 neighbors , and assigns it a temperature @xmath51 .",
    "spectra are then computed from this particle distribution using the algorithm described by hernquist et al .",
    "we sample the spectra with resolution @xmath52 , roughly corresponding to that of the keck hires spectra to which we will compare our model predictions .",
    "we `` fit a continuum '' to each spectral segment , @xmath53 in length , by rescaling all flux values so that the highest pixel has transmission of unity ( @xcite ) . fitting a continuum",
    "makes low - power models appear more like high power models , so it is an important step for conservatively discriminating against models with suppressed power .",
    "the optical depth to photons depends on a number of uncertain parameters including @xmath15 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 , and the intensity of the ionizing background",
    ". however , the cumulative effect of all these parameters is to scale the normalization factor ( @xmath56 ) relating @xmath45 to @xmath57 , as long as collisional ionization is unimportant ( @xcite ) .",
    "we fix @xmath56 in each model so that the mean transmitted flux at @xmath1 , @xmath58 , is 0.684 , as measured by mcdonald et al .",
    "( 1999 ) from keck hires spectra of eight quasars .",
    "figure 2 shows artificial absorption spectra at @xmath1 extracted along four random lines of sight , in three different models : cdm , wdm500 , and wdm750 .",
    "the gas responsible for absorption is in larger and more diffuse structures in wdm models compared to the cdm model .",
    "hence , the wdm spectra are smoother and have less small scale power as compared to the cdm spectra .",
    "the fluctuations in the absorbing gas are also weaker in the wdm models , resulting in absorption lines that are broader and shallower than corresponding lines in the cdm artificial spectra .",
    "= 5.5truein    figure 3 shows the one dimensional power spectrum of the transmitted flux , @xmath59 , computed using 400 artificial spectra for each model .",
    "the solid points show @xmath59 measured by mcdonald et al .",
    "the shape and amplitude of @xmath59 of the cdm model matches the observations very well , in the entire range @xmath60 \\la -1 $ ] .",
    "however , the wdm models predict a wrong shape of @xmath59 .",
    "thus , although the @xmath59 of wdm models match the observations on large scales , @xmath60 \\la -2 $ ] , they have too little power on smaller scales .",
    "this confirms the visual impression from the spectra in fig . 2 , and is also evident in the flux decrement correlation function ( not shown ) .",
    "a higher value of @xmath55 further suppresses @xmath59 on smaller scales , worsening the discrepancy with observations .",
    "note that lowering @xmath61 to make up the power suppressed by wdm is not feasible ; a lower @xmath61 raises the power spectrum on all scales at @xmath1 , and thus would be inconsistent with the observed @xmath59 on large scales .",
    "=    figure 4 shows the probability distribution function ( pdf ) of the transmitted flux ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , computed using 400 artificial spectra for each model .",
    "the solid points show the flux pdf measured by mcdonald et al .",
    "the flux pdf of the cdm model matches observations remarkably well over the entire range of flux values .",
    "as the mass of wdm decreases , there is less small scale power in the mass distribution , the mass fluctuations are weaker , and the gas responsible for absorption is in more diffuse structures .",
    "hence there are fewer pixels where the transmission approaches unity , and more pixels at intermediate fluxes . in the flux range @xmath62 , the flux pdf for all wdm models with @xmath63 differs from observations by @xmath64 .",
    "this mismatch further confirms that the mass fluctuation amplitude of these wdm models is too low at small scales when the fluctuations are normalized to match @xmath59 on large scales .",
    "even the model wdm750t025k , with a higher temperature for the mean - density gas ( @xmath65 ) , does not match the observations as well as the cdm model . on the other hand , while wdm1000 does not match the observations very well , a higher value of @xmath55 can bring its flux pdf to better agreement with observations . since recent determinations of @xmath55 prefer values around @xmath66 ( e.g. , @xcite ) , we conclude that the observed flux pdf can not be reproduced by wdm models with @xmath67 ev .",
    "the bsik02 model is also inconsistent with observations , being similar to wdm500 .",
    "for a given cosmology , the properties of the forest depend on three factors : ( a ) the linear theory power spectrum , taken from a boltzmann code ; ( b ) power transfer from large to small scales during non - linear gravitational evolution , followed using n - body simulations ; and ( c ) the equation of state of the intergalactic medium , governed by photoionization equilibrium . here",
    ", we have used the observed forest at @xmath1 to constrain the shape of the linear power spectrum , and consequently @xmath22 .",
    "our principal conclusions are as follows : ( 1 ) @xmath68 ev is required to match @xmath59 and flux pdf of artificial spectra extracted from simulations of wdm models with keck hires observations of mcdonald et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , for any reasonable @xmath69 .",
    "this limit is similar to that obtained from the maximum observed phase space density of dwarf spheroidal galaxies ( dalcanton & hogan 2000 ) .",
    "high resolution n - body simulations of wdm models with @xmath70 kev predict the observed circular velocity function of satellite galaxies in the local group , but produce cuspy halos ( @xcite ) .",
    "( 2 ) forest properties depend on the shape of the linear power spectrum , and are insensitive to streaming velocities of wdm particles . even for a 200  ev wdm particle , @xmath71 at @xmath1 , an order of magnitude smaller than the thermal velocity of gas at @xmath48  k. hence , any mechanism that suppresses the cdm linear power spectrum more severely than a 750  ev wdm particle will be inconsistent with forest observations .",
    "( 3 ) the bsi model proposed by kamionkowski & liddle ( 1999 ) , with @xmath72 chosen to match the abundance of dwarf galaxies , does not reproduce the observed properties of the forest at @xmath1 . we note that this is the extreme bsi model considered by white & croft ( 2000 ) , hence our conclusion is not in conflict with theirs .",
