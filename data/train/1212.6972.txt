    "galileon theories are a class of models for hypothetical scalar fields whose lagrangians involve multilinears of first and second derivatives , but whose nonlinear field equations are still only second order",
    ".  they may be important for the description of large - scale features in astrophysics as well as for elementary particle theory @xcite .",
    "hierarchies of galileon lagrangians were discussed mathematically for flat spacetime in @xcite , independently of an earlier systematic survey of second - order scalar - tensor field equations in curved 4d spacetime @xcite .",
    "the simplest example involves a single scalar field , @xmath0 .",
    "this galileon field may be coupled universally  to the trace of the energy - momentum tensor , @xmath1 , and upon so doing , it is gravitation - like by virtue of the similarity between this universal coupling and that of the metric @xmath2 to @xmath3 in general relativity .  as might be expected from this similarity and the ubiquitous generation of scalar fields by the process of dimensional reduction , it is possible to obtain some galileon models from limits of higher dimensional gravitation theories .",
    "indeed , galileon models were discovered yet again by this process @xcite .",
    "although higher derivative actions _ usually _ lead to higher derivative field equations , as is well - known , nonetheless it is _ possible _ to accommodate higher derivatives in the action while retaining second - order field equations if the lagrangian is not quadratic in the fields .",
    "the price to be paid is that the second - order field equations are always _",
    "nonlinear_.  this is the basic ingredient that underlies all galileon  models .",
    "this point has already been well - appreciated in the literature , of course , but for purposes of illustration , consider the simplest  cubic , fourth - order lagrangian density , @xmath4 where @xmath5 , etc . , and repeated indices are summed using either lorentzian or euclidean signatures .",
    "the corresponding action @xmath6 has local variation,@xmath7 surface terms , irrelevant for the field equations in the bulk , have been discarded .",
    "that is to say,@xmath8 and the field equation , @xmath9 , is both nonlinear and fourth - order .",
    "however , the order of the field equation may be reduced by adding to the lagrangian a judicious amount of the next - to - simplest  cubic term that involves first , second , or third derivatives .",
    "so far as the field equations are concerned , there is actually only _",
    "one _ other term that can be added , namely , @xmath10 .",
    "superficially different terms , e.g. @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 ,  do _ not _ give independent contributions to the local variation of the action in the bulk , although they differ in their surface contributions .  in particular,@xmath15",
    "i.e. a total divergence .",
    "thus it is sufficient to include in the action any two of the three terms on the lhs , with an arbitrary relative coefficient .",
    "so , rather than ( [ simplestl ] ) , consider instead the lagrangian density@xmath16 with constant @xmath17 .",
    "the variation of the action obtained from ( [ 1parameterl ] ) is@xmath18 thus @xmath19 uniquely eliminates from the variation all derivatives higher than the second , leaving just@xmath20 while this equation is still nonlinear , it is now only second - order .    moreover , the action for the @xmath19 model can be rewritten in various ways upon integrating by parts .",
    "perhaps the most compact and memorable of these is@xmath21 this differs from the previous @xmath22 by a factor of @xmath23 and a boundary term , @xmath24 involving the current @xmath25 indeed , most discussions of this model are developed around @xmath26 , after defining the system s lagrangian to be@xmath27    to complete our discussion of this elementary case , consider the energy - momentum density arising from @xmath28 .",
    "the canonical result is straightforwardly obtained , even though the lagrangian involves higher derivatives , but the resulting density is not a symmetric tensor .",
    "however , minimal coupling to gravity is guaranteed to yield a symmetric tensor , so we take that route .",
    "generally covariant forms of ( [ l2 ] ) and ( [ action2 ] ) are obtained through the replacements @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "thus an invariant action is @xmath31 varying the metric gives @xmath32 .  in the flat - space limit , the result is@xmath33 this is seen to be conserved @xmath34 upon using the field equation , @xmath35 , where@xmath36 the justification for the name galileon  is now apparent .",
    "any shift of the field by a constant , or by a term linear in  @xmath37 , as is reminiscent of a galilean transformation in classical mechanics , will leave the action ( [ action2 ] ) invariant , up to surface terms , and therefore not falsify a solution of the field equation .",
    "an interesting wrinkle now appears : @xmath38 is not traceless on - shell .",
    "consequently , the usual form of the scale current , @xmath39 , is not conserved .  on the other hand ,",
    "the action ( [ action2 ] ) is homogeneous in @xmath0 and its derivatives , and is clearly invariant under the scale transformations @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "hence the corresponding noether current must be conserved .",
    "this current is easily found , at least in four dimensions , since the trace is obviously a total divergence in that case:@xmath42 that is to say , for @xmath43 the virial is the trilinear @xmath44 .",
    "so a conserved scale current is given by the combination,@xmath45 however , the virial here is not a divergence modulo a conserved current .",
    "so the theory is _ not _ conformally invariant despite being scale invariant .",
    "some additional algebra is needed for @xmath46 , but eventually one finds:@xmath47   \\mathcal{e}_{2}\\ .\\label{sconservationanydim}\\ ] ] the last term in  the virial @xmath48 for @xmath46 involves a bilinear current which is conserved merely as a restatement of the field equation:@xmath49 in fact , this current is itself a total divergence,@xmath50 so the field equation for the model is a double divergence for any @xmath51 .",
    "but once again , although the model is scale invariant in any number of dimensions , it is not conformally invariant for @xmath52 .",
    "since ( [ l2 ] ) has the form of the conventional free field lagrangian density @xmath53 the klein - gordon equation , for a massless scalar field , it immediately suggests a generalization to a hierarchy of such systems , where the lagrangian density for the @xmath54th system is just a product of the free field lagrangian density and the equation of motion for the @xmath55st system .",
    "in fact , this simple generalization is easy to formulate in explicit detail .  a systematic theory for the hierarchy",
    "is elegantly expressed using determinants .",
    "_ this section may be skipped by anyone with a phobia for determinants , and definitely should be passed over by anyone under a doctor s orders to cut back on tensor index shuffling .",
    "later sections of the paper rarely invoke results obtained in this section",
    ".  however , the material presented here may be helpful for applications beyond those considered in this primer .",
    "accordingly , the last part (  3.9 ) provides an encapsulation of the results in terms of determinants and standard kronecker symbols .  _",
    "for any @xmath56 matrix @xmath57 , consider the expansion@xmath58 where @xmath59 .",

    "however , from the identity@xmath63 it follows that the @xmath64 obey a recursion relation for any @xmath57,@xmath65 the solution of this recursion for all @xmath66 can be expressed in terms of _ another _ set of determinants , @xmath67 where @xmath68 is an auxiliary @xmath69 matrix containing the various traces:@xmath70{ccccccc}\\mathcal{t}_{1 } & k-1 & 0 & \\cdots & 0 & 0 & 0\\\\ \\mathcal{t}_{2 } & \\mathcal{t}_{1 } & k-2 & \\cdots & 0 & 0 & 0\\\\ \\mathcal{t}_{3 } & \\mathcal{t}_{2 } & \\mathcal{t}_{1 } & \\cdots & 0 & 0 & 0\\\\ \\vdots & \\vdots & \\vdots & \\ddots & \\vdots & \\vdots & \\vdots\\\\ \\mathcal{t}_{k-2 } & \\mathcal{t}_{k-3 } & \\mathcal{t}_{k-4 } & \\cdots & \\mathcal{t}_{1 } & 2 & 0\\\\ \\mathcal{t}_{k-1 } & \\mathcal{t}_{k-2 } & \\mathcal{t}_{k-3 } & \\cdots & \\mathcal{t}_{2 } & \\mathcal{t}_{1 } & 1\\\\ \\mathcal{t}_{k } & \\mathcal{t}_{k-1 } & \\mathcal{t}_{k-2 } & \\cdots & \\mathcal{t}_{3 } & \\mathcal{t}_{2 } & \\mathcal{t}_{1}\\end{array } \\right )   \\ .\\label{deteofmt}\\ ] ] the recursion relation ( [ eofmrecursion ] ) is recovered by expanding @xmath71 in the minors of the first column .",
