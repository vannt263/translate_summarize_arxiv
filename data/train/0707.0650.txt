    "the construction of the cern large hadron collider ( lhc ) has led to many increasingly precise calculations of sparticle production and decay processes .    an important ingredient of the model is the susy qcd sector . in most of the processes with color particles radiative corrections from the strong interactions give a dominant contribution .",

    "renormalizable qcd is considered as an effective theory that can be obtained from a more fundamental one by decoupling of heavy particles .",

    "operators that respect gauge invariance and , consequently , can be absorbed into redefinition of lagrangian parameters and fields .    in section  [ sec : decoupling_escalar ] , we discuss how relations between -parameters and their counter - parts in -scheme can be obtained on the same footing .",
    "the distinction between  and  essentially comes from the presence of so - called @xmath1-scalars .",
    "since the scalars are unphysical , we may assume that they are heavy and decouple them in almost the same way as one decouples physical degrees of freedom .",
    "as an example of the formalism , in section  [ sec : qcd - qcd ] , we consider two - loop matching of  qcd with  qcd .",
    "we show how known relations between  and  qcd parameters ( see , e.g. , ref .  )",
    "are reproduced .    in section  [ sec : qcd - sqcd ] , we use the described technique to calculate a two - loop relation between  and  running masses of the b - quark in qcd and susy qcd part of the mssm . in our approach , we decouple all heavy particles simultaneously ( `` common scale approach '' of ref .  ) . for the tev - scale susy it seems phenomenologically acceptable since the electroweak scale is usually used for matching .",
    "simultaneous decoupling results in a lengthy final expression . as a consequence ,",
    "only numerical impact of the result is presented .    in our calculations we made use of feynarts@xcite to generate needed feynman amplitudes . since @xmath2 transition requires explicit treatment of @xmath1-scalars , the interaction lagrangian for the unphysical fields",
    "was implemented .",
    "some details of the implementation can be found in a series of appendices .",
    "in qcd and its supersymmetric extension it is convenient to use mass - independent ( minimal subtractions or ) renormalization schemes . in these schemes beta - functions and anomalous dimensions have a very simple structure . however , physical quantities expressed in terms of the running parameters exhibit a nonanalytic logarithmic dependence on all mass scales of the theory .    if there is a big hierarchy between mass scales , it is not satisfactory , since due to this nonanalytic mass dependence , a contribution of heavy degrees of freedom to low - energy observables is not suppressed by the inverse power of the corresponding heavy mass scale .",
    "it is said that in -schemes in contrast to momentum subtraction schemes ( mom ) , the appelquist - carrazone decoupling theorem@xcite does not hold .",
    "a proper way to overcome the above - mentioned difficulties of -schemes is to use effective ( low - energy ) theories to describe physics at relevant energy scales @xmath11 .",
    "if at given energies heavy particles with mass @xmath12 can only appear in virtual states one may use an effective field theory with the corresponding heavy fields omitted .    in a general case",
    "low - energy theories are not renormalizable .",
    "moreover , to reproduce physics close to the threshold @xmath13 correctly , they should contain infinitely many nonrenormalizable interactions parametrized by dimensionful couplings .",
    "however , given a more fundamental theory one can relate all the couplings in the effective low - energy lagrangian to fundamental parameters of the high - energy theory .",
    "roughly speaking , one should calculate observables ( or , more strictly , green functions ) in both theories and tune the parameters and field normalization in the effective lagrangian in such a way that both results coincide in the region below the threshold .",
    "this procedure is called matching . as a result of matching one expresses effective theory parameters as functions of fundamental ones . in practice",
    ", one can not deal with an infinite number of interactions .",
    "so one usually performs _ asymptotic _ expansion of green functions defined in high - energy theory in @xmath14 and demands that effective theory should correctly reproduce a finite order of the expansion considered .    in some cases",
    "effective theories are used for energies far below the threshold so a contribution from nonrenormalizable operators is usually suppressed by powers of @xmath14 .",
    "one may even consider _ renormalizable _ effective theory . in this case , the structure of low - energy lagrangian differs from the one of the fundamental theory only by omission of all the heavy fields and their interactions .",
    "one usually says that decoupling of heavy particles is manifest if one can directly use the parameters defined in a fundamental theory to calculate quantities within the effective theory ( and vice versa ) . in a momentum subtraction scheme decoupling is obvious , since all the parameters are defined through green functions evaluated at certain external momenta ( less than @xmath15 ) .",
    "since we demand that green functions in both theories coincide , all the parameters defined in such a way also coincide .    on the contrary",
    ", -parameters are not related to green functions evaluated at some finite momenta .",
    "thus , one does not expect that -parameters have the same value in both the theories . in this sense decoupling in -schemes",

    "one should manually tune the parameters defined in such a scheme .",
    "how does the approach based on effective theories help one to avoid the appearance of large logarithms for @xmath16 in a calculation ?",
    "the trick is to separate @xmath17 into @xmath18 and @xmath19 , where @xmath3 is an arbitrary separation scale which in -scheme is naturally equal to the thooft unit mass .",
    "then one may absorb @xmath18 into low - energy parameters of the effective theory by a matching procedure .",
    "a typical relation between the parameters is @xmath20 where @xmath21 is a dimensionless parameter of the effective theory , @xmath22 denotes its counter - part in the high - energy theory , and @xmath23 are other dimensionless fundamental theory parameters .",
    "the function @xmath24 is called decoupling constant for @xmath22 . generalization of to dimensionful parameters is straightforward .",
    "however , one should keep in mind that the crucial property of @xmath24 is its independence of small energy scales .",

    "given @xmath26 one avoids large logarithms in .",
    "if one knows fundamental parameters at the scale @xmath27 , one can find the values of the effective - theory parameters at the same scale .",
    "clearly , direct application of the parameters @xmath28 in low - energy theory again introduces large logarithms @xmath29 .",
    "however , in the effective theory it is possible to sum these logarithms by the renormalization group method , i.e. , going from @xmath30 to @xmath31 ( see fig .  [",

    "the crucial property of the theory is that it describes not only gluons and quarks ( light fields denoted by @xmath37 ) , but also heavy fields @xmath38 with typical masses @xmath15 : @xmath39 here @xmath40 are gluon , quark , and ghost fields , respectively .",

    "the form of asymptotic expansion represents the perfect factorization property @xcite , since heavy ( @xmath15 ) and light parameters ( @xmath42 ) are fully factorized .",
    "we consider only leading term in the expansion nonrenormalizable local operators built of @xmath37 with the coefficients @xmath55 , so all operators in @xmath56 are renormalizable .",
    "therefore , one can rescale the light fields @xmath57 and write the effective theory lagrangian in terms of @xmath58 @xmath59 where we also introduce new parameters which are related to the initial ones by means of decoupling constants ( @xmath60 )    [ decoupling : general ] @xmath61 where @xmath62    due to the gauge invariance one should obtain the same result for @xmath63 in calculated from different vertices . moreover , since dimensional regularization does not violate the gauge invariance , the longitudinal part of the gluon propagator is not renormalized . as a consequence , for the gauge - fixing parameter @xmath43 one introduces the same decoupling constant as for the gluon field . according to , one can identify underlined parameters with those of qcd .",

    "in dimensional regularization ( dreg ) , the number of space - time dimensions is altered from four to @xmath92 which renders the loop integrations finite .",
    "it is clear , however , that if dreg is applied to a four - dimensional supersymmetric theory , the number of bosonic and fermionic degrees of freedom in supermultiplets is no longer equal , such that supersymmetry is explicitly broken . in order to avoid this problem ,",

    "this leads to complications in the renormalization group analysis , since the running of the couplings is different . secondly , since @xmath100",
    "are scalars , all massive particles that couple to them contribute to the unphysical @xmath1-scalar mass @xmath101 . in order to solve the first mentioned problem",
    ", one must introduce so - called evanescent@xcite couplings for each vertex .",
    "to the second problem there are two approaches .",
    "one may either introduce @xmath1-scalar mass explicitly in the lagrangian and renormalize it minimally ( -scheme ) or use nonminimal counter - term to subtract radiative corrections to @xmath101 at each order of perturbation theory@xcite .",
    "it turns out that these prescriptions give rise to the same final answer for the qcd observables .",
    "we have checked this explicitly by considering two - loop pole mass@xcite of the quark in the  qcd .    in the context of susy",
    "qcd part of the mssm the situation is different .",
    "all the dimensionless evanescent couplings are related to the gluon couplings by susy and , therefore , are not independent .",
    "this circumvents the first problem .",
    "however , two mentioned renormalization conditions for @xmath101 produce different answers .",
    "for example , in  the pole mass of a scalar quark superpartner ( squark ) exhibits a quadratic dependence on @xmath101 .",
    "the authors of ref .   proposed to redefine running squark masses @xmath102 to absorb the unphysical contribution ( @xmath103-scheme ) . at the one - loop level one",
    "has @xmath104 after such a redefinition one obtains the result which is independent of @xmath101 .",
    "the new scheme is equivalent to the prescription with a nonminimal counter - term@xcite .",
    "this statement was also checked explicitly by considering heavy quark pole mass@xcite in susy qcd as an observable .",
    "formula and the reasoning that was used to obtain it allows one to interpret as a first step towards decoupling of @xmath1-scalars in the sense described in the previous section . leading ( but unphysical ) @xmath105 corrections to the pole mass of the squark",
    "are absorbed into redefinition of the corresponding mass parameter .",
    "one may go further and decouple @xmath1-scalars completely .",
    "it seems useless in the context of susy qcd , since without @xmath1-scalars one loses the advantages of dred .",
    "however , it makes sense in the problem described in the paper . for nonsupersymmetric models",
    "-scheme is natural in the sense that contrary to it does not require introduction of evanescent couplings . given the procedure ( see sec .  [",
    "sec : decoupling_framework ] ) , not only physical degrees of freedom can be decoupled but also unphysical @xmath1-scalars .",
    "this leads to a direct relation between @xmath106-parameters of the effective theory and @xmath107-parameters of the full theory .    using these simple arguments we calculate the relation between the @xmath0-quark running mass defined in the  qcd and its counter - part in @xmath107 susy qcd .",

    "the transition from  to  scheme can be achieved almost automatically by decoupling of unphysical @xmath1-scalars together with physical squarks and gluinos . to justify the latter statement , decoupling of @xmath1-scalars",

    "this in turn allows one to determine @xmath10 more precisely from known sm input and implement three - loop running of the mssm parameters ( see  ref .  ) consistently .",
    "the numerical analysis of the correction and its impact on the spectrum is carried out .",

    "the main advantage seems obvious .",
    "one need not to consider evanescent couplings and their renormalization in nonsupersymmetric theories as , e.g. , in refs .  , .",
    "however , one has to pay some price for this simplification , since separate treatment of massive @xmath1-scalars is required .",
    "for our problem we implemented the corresponding feynman rules in feynarts package and generated needed diagrams by computer .",
    "another obvious issue is a simultaneous decoupling of all heavy particles .",
    "this is reasonable only if the corresponding masses are of the same order , which may be not true for some susy scenarios , e.g. for split susy@xcite . in the latter case",
    ", a step - by - step decoupling is needed .",
    "nevertheless , a @xmath2 transition is required at some stage and we think that this step can be carried out by decoupling of @xmath1-scalars .",
    "it is reasonable to do this as soon as possible , since in this case no evanescent couplings appear in the effective nonsupersymmetric theory .",

    "however , in almost all practical calculations one `` scalarize '' the expression for a feynman amplitude by contraction of its free indices with an appropriate projector . in a scalarized expression",
    "the relevant property is @xmath281",
    ".    finally , there are gauge fixing and ghost terms in the lagrangian of four - dimensional qcd @xmath282 clearly , after dimensional reduction these terms do not contribute to the interaction lagrangian for the @xmath1-scalars .",

    "consider the four - dimensional form of the relevant part of the susy qcd lagrangian @xmath283 here @xmath284 is a covariant derivative for gluinos @xmath285 ( see ) and @xmath286 denotes a covariant derivative for squarks @xmath287 that belong to fundamental representation of the color group .",
