    "the karmen collaboration has reported recently  @xcite a null result of the karmen  2 experiment in the search for neutrino oscillations  @xcite in the channel @xmath0 .",
    "this result is very interesting because the karmen neutrino oscillation experiment is sensitive to the same region in the plane of the neutrino mixing parameters @xmath1 and @xmath2 as the lsnd experiment  @xcite whose results provide an evidence in favor of @xmath0 and @xmath3 oscillations .",
    "hence , the statistical interpretation of the karmen  2 null result ( as well as that of the lsnd result ) is crucial in order to obtain an indication on the compatibility or incompatibility of the different results of the two experiments .",
    "the karmen experiment  @xcite is located at at the isis spallation neutron facility of the rutherford laboratories ( uk ) .",
    "the proton beam produced at isis is pulsed in time : two 100 ns wide proton pulses separated by 330 ns are produced every 20 ms .",
    "the proton pulses are directed on a target where they produce positive pions ( the negative pions are absorbed in the source before decaying ) which decay at rest according to the process @xmath4 producing an equal number of @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "the karmen experiment searches for @xmath8 produced by @xmath0 oscillations at a mean distance of 17.6 m. the time structure of the neutrino beam is important for the identification of the neutrino induced reactions in the karmen detector and for the effective suppression of the cosmic ray background .",
    "the karmen experiment started in 1990 and run until 1995 as karmen 1  @xcite . in 1996",
    "it was upgraded to karmen  2 , eliminating the main cosmic ray induced background component in the search for @xmath0 oscillations  @xcite .",
    "so far the karmen  2 experiment measured no events  @xcite , with an expected background of @xmath9 events .",
    "this null result has been analyzed with the following statistical methods :    bayesian approach .",
    ": :    this method is recommended by the particle data group  @xcite    and has been used by the karmen collaboration  @xcite .",

    "the unified approach has the    undesirable feature that when the number of observed events is smaller    than the expected background , the upper limits for the mean    @xmath10 of true neutrino oscillation events decreases    rapidly when the background increases .",
    "hence , by observing less events    than the expected background an experiment can establish a very    stringent upper bound on @xmath10 even if it is not sensitive    to such small values of @xmath10 .",
    "this is what happens in the    unified approach analysis of the karmen  2 null result : the upper limit    for the mean @xmath10 of true neutrino oscillation events is    1.1 and the corresponding exclusion curve  @xcite reproduced in    fig .",

    "from a physical point of view this is rather disturbing , because _ a stringent upper bound for @xmath10 obtained by an experiment which has observed a number of events significantly smaller than the expected background is not due to the fact that the experiment is very sensitive to small values of @xmath10 , but to the fact that less background events than expected have been observed_.    this is the case of the null result of the karmen  2 experiment , from which the unified approach yields an upper 90% cl confidence limit for the mean @xmath10 of neutrino oscillation events of 1.1 events . the corresponding exclusion curve in the plane of the neutrino mixing parameters @xmath1 and @xmath2 is shown in fig .  [ fig1 ] ( the solid curve passing through the filled circles ) and one can see that it is significantly more stringent than the exclusion curve obtained with the bayesian approach ( the solid curve passing through the filled squares ) .",
    "the strictness of the unified approach exclusion curve is due to the non - observation of the expected background events and not to the sensitivity of the experiment ( see the discussion in ref .",
    "@xcite and the sensitivity of the karmen experiment presented in ref.@xcite ) .",
    "this is clearly an undesirable result from a physical point of view , because _ the statistical interpretation of the data produces an exaggeratedly stringent result that could lead to incorrect physical conclusions_.    the discrepancy between the bayesian approach exclusion curve and the unified approach exclusion curve is worrying for a physicist , because the bayesian approach exclusion curve is compatible with a large part of the lsnd - allowed region ( the shadowed area in fig .",

    "@xcite i have proposed _ a new ordering principle _ for the construction of a classical confidence belt which has all the desirable features of the one in the unified approach ( _ i.e. _ an automatic transition with the correct coverage from two - sided confidence intervals to upper confidence limits when the observed number of events is of the order or less than the expected background ) and in addition minimizes the decrease of the upper confidence limit for a given @xmath13 as the mean expected background @xmath14 increases .",
    "the new ordering principle is implemented as the feldman and cousins ordering principle in the unified approach , but for each value of @xmath10 the rank of each value of @xmath13 is calculated from the relative size of the likelihood ratio @xmath39 where the reference value @xmath40 is taken to be the bayesian expected value for @xmath10 : @xmath41 here @xmath42 is the bayesian probability distribution for @xmath10 calculated assuming a constant prior for @xmath43 ( see , for example , @xcite ) : @xmath44 the obvious inequality @xmath45 implies that @xmath46 .",

    "this behaviour of @xmath20 is more acceptable for the physical interpretation of experimental results than the behaviour of @xmath20 in the unified approach .",
    "the 90% cl upper confidence limit for the mean @xmath10 of neutrino oscillation events following from the analysis of the karmen  2 null result with the new ordering approach is of 1.9 events and the corresponding exclusion curve in the plane of the neutrino mixing parameters @xmath1 and @xmath2 is shown in fig .",

    "obtains overcoverage for small values of @xmath10 if @xmath14 is large ( for example , @xmath107 and @xmath108 ) and undercoverage for large values of @xmath10 if @xmath14 is small ( for example , @xmath109 and @xmath110 ) .",
    "however , this calculation is in contradiction with the assumption that @xmath14 is fixed by the procedure , _",

    "( the fact that for @xmath114 the sum of the probabilities is bigger than 0.90 shows the unavoidable overcoverage in the case of a poisson processes due to the discreteness of @xmath13 .",
    "see , for example , refs.@xcite . )    in conclusion of this section , we have seen that the unknown background approach is allowed and the corresponding exclusion curves obtained with four different statistical methods do not differ much . in practice",
    "this result represents a support for the bayesian exclusion curve plotted in fig .",
    "however , it is necessary to emphasize that the unknown background approach is conservative for two reasons : 1 ) the upper confidence limit for the mean @xmath10 neutrino oscillation events is taken to be equal to the upper confidence limit for @xmath12 , where @xmath14 is the unknown mean background events ; 2 ) the choice to use the unknown background approach is done on the basis of the result of the experiment , introducing some overcoverage . hence , we can consider the exclusion curves obtained with the unknown background approach as _ ultra - conservative_.",
    "in their unified approach paper  @xcite feldman and cousins suggested that in the cases in which the measurement is less than the estimated mean background , the experimental collaboration should report also the sensitivity of the experiment , defined as `` the average upper limit that would be obtained by an ensemble of experiments with the expected background and no true signal '' .",
    "this is also recommended by the particle data group  @xcite .    from the definition ,",
    "the sensitivity @xmath115 of an experiment measuring a poisson process with an expected mean background @xmath14 with negligible error is given by with non - negligible error @xmath77 : @xmath116 , with @xmath61 given by eq.([pnmu1 ] ) .",
    "] @xmath117 where @xmath19 is the confidence level of the upper limits @xmath20 .",
    "the sensitivity @xmath115 depends on the values of the upper limits @xmath20 , which are different in the different methods for calculating the confidence belt ( _ e.g. _ in the unified approach and in the new ordering approach ) .",
    "the sensitivity of the karmen  2 experiment for @xmath118 is @xmath119  @xcite in the unified approach and @xmath120  @xcite in the new ordering approach .",
    "the corresponding sensitivity curves are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ( the solid curves passing through the empty circles and triangles , respectively )",
    ".    one could think of considering the sensitivity curve of the karmen  2 experiment as its exclusion curve .",
    "however , this is _",
    "wrong _ for the following reasons . from eq.([sensitivity ] ) it is clear that _",
    "@xmath115 is the expected value of the upper limit @xmath86 under the hypothesis that @xmath37_. this is the only correct meaning of @xmath115 even though the value of @xmath115 depends on the confidence level @xmath19 , the interval @xmath121 $ ] does not have a confidence level @xmath19 from a frequentist point of view .",
    "notice that @xmath115 does not depend on any experimental result and can be calculated for real as well as hypothetical experiments .",
    "if the sensitivity curve corresponding to @xmath122 could be interpreted as an exclusion curve with confidence level @xmath19 , one could obtain exclusion curves ( _ i.e. _ experimental results ) without performing any experiment ! this apparent paradox is solved by noting that @xmath115 is _ not _ calculated by assuming that the number of observed events is zero ( all values of @xmath13 are taken into account in eq.([sensitivity ] ) ) but assuming that the true value of @xmath10 is zero and if the true value of @xmath10 would be known it would be useless to do any experiment to measure it .",
    "each sensitivity curve in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] is shifted to the right with respect to the corresponding exclusion curve , although it is calculated under the assumption that @xmath37 , because the sensitivity curve takes into account the possibility that an experiment with mean background @xmath14 can measure a number of events @xmath123 , even if @xmath37 . for example , in the unified approach with @xmath108 one has @xmath124 , @xmath125 , @xmath126 , and so on . on the other hand , since @xmath127 , an experiment measuring two events , in good agreement with the mean expected background @xmath108 , can draw an exclusion curve that is significantly more stringent than the sensitivity curve for @xmath108 .",
    "since the sensitivity curve of a neutrino oscillation experiment can be calculated before doing the experiment , it is useful in order to plan future experiments that cover approximately the region of interest in the plane of the neutrino mixing parameters @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "the statistical interpretation of the null result of the karmen  2 neutrino oscillation experiment is rather problematic because no events were observed with a mean expected background of @xmath9 events  @xcite .",
    "the exclusion curves obtained with the bayesian approach and with the unified approach  @xcite are significantly different and yield contradicting indications on the compatibility of the karmen  2 result with the neutrino oscillation signal measured in the lsnd experiment  @xcite ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "the analysis of the karmen  2 null result with the new ordering approach  @xcite , which is a frequentist method with correct coverage as the unified approach , yields an exclusion curve close to the one obtained with the bayesian approach . in this way ,",
    "the undesirable discrepancy between frequentist and bayesian interpretations of the karmen  2 null result is removed .",
    "however , some concern still persist on the interpretation of the fact that none of the expected background events have been observed in the karmen  2 experiment .",
    "this concern will increase in the future if the karmen  2 experiment will continue to observe significantly less background events than expected .",
    "hence , it is interesting to investigate other possibilities for the statistical interpretation of the karmen  2 null result .    in this paper",
    "i have discussed three alternative statistical interpretation of the karmen  2 null result : the larger background error possibility in section  [ larger background error ] , the unknown background possibility in section  [ unknown background ] and the sensitivity possibility in section  [ sensitivity ] .    in section  [ larger background error ]",
    "i have presented the formalism that allows to take into account the error of the expected mean background .",
    "however , the conclusion of this section is that taking into account the error of the expected mean background in the karmen  2 experiment , even if it is wrong by an order of magnitude , does not help in solving the problem of the statistical interpretation of the result of this experiment , because the resulting exclusion curves are practically equivalent to the ones obtained assuming no error for the expected mean background .",
    "the unknown background approach discussed in section  [ unknown background ] gives ultra - conservative exclusion curves , which in the case of the karmen  2 experiment tend to support the exclusion curve obtained with the bayesian approach .",
    "obtaining ultra - conservative exclusion curves is generally not desirable , but could be a safe choice in controversial cases as that of the karmen  2 experiment .",
    "the possibility to consider a sensitivity curve as an exclusion curve is discussed in section  [ sensitivity ] and is shown to be wrong . since the sensitivity curve of a neutrino oscillation experiment can be calculated before doing the experiment , its usefulness lies in the possibility to plan future experiments in order to cover approximately the region of interest in the plane of the neutrino mixing parameters @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "finally , i would like to remark that the direct comparison of exclusion curves and allowed regions obtained with different statistical methods does not have a precise statistical significance .",
    "hence , such a comparison can not be used to combine the results of different experiments or to infer with some known confidence level a contradiction between the results of different experiments when the comparison is done on the border of the exclusion curves and of the allowed regions .",
    "hence , the comparison of the karmen  2 exclusion curves and the lsnd - allowed region , which was obtained with a different statistical analysis ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) , must be done with great caution . in the future ,",
    "if the karmen  2 experiment will continue to observe no neutrino oscillations , it will be possible to claim a contradiction between the results of the two experiments only when the exclusion curves obtained from the result of the karmen  2 experiment with different statistical methods will produce similar results and will lie well on the left of the region allowed by the results of the lsnd experiment .",
