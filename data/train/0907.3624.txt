    "two of the most serious problems in modern physics are the creation of turbulence and the quantization of strongly interacting quantum fields ( nonperturbative quantization ) . from ref .",
    "@xcite : `` in the world of physics , the difficulty of understanding turbulence in fluids is legendary .",
    "a famous quotation is also variously attributed to einstein , heisenberg , richard feynman , or arnold sommerfeld : turbulence is the last great unsolved problem of classical physics . '' in a similar way the nonperturbative quantization is unsolved problems in quantum physics .",
    "the nonperturbative quantization problem is connected with the problem of quark confinement or unobservability of a single quark . from wikipedia",
    "@xcite : `` color confinement is the physics phenomenon that color charged particles ( such as quarks ) can not be isolated singularly , and therefore can not be directly observed .",
    "the reasons for quark confinement are somewhat complicated ; there is no analytic proof that quantum chromodynamics should be confining , but intuitively , confinement is due to the force - carrying gluons having color charge .",
    "as any two electrically - charged particles separate , the electric fields between them diminish quickly , allowing ( for example ) electrons to become unbound from nuclei .",
    "however , as two quarks separate , the gluon fields form narrow tubes ( or strings ) of color charge , which tend to bring the quarks together as though they were some kind of rubber band .",
    "this is quite different in behavior from electrical charge .",
    "because of this behavior , the color force experienced by the quarks in the direction to hold them together , remains constant , regardless of their distance from each other . '' here we would like to consider a possible connection between these two problems .    in order to understand the reason of confinement problem in quantum chromodynamics",
    "there are many attempts to compare quantum chromodynamics witn other branches of physics . in ref .",
    "@xcite it was suggested that the confinement of quarks into hadrons may happen due to a condensation of special gluonic configurations called abelian monopoles . in this approach ( the dual superconductivity scenario )",
    "a condensate of the monopoles breaks spontaneously an internal @xmath0 gauge symmetry . according to the dual superconductor idea , the breaking of the dual symmetry gives rise naturally to the dual meissner effect , which insures a formation of a tube , which in turn leads to the confinement the quarks into hadronic bound states . in ref .",
    "@xcite it is supposed that the @xmath1 yang - mills theory in the low - temperature phase can be considered as a nematic liquid crystal . in ref .",
    "@xcite it is proposed that the su(2 ) yang - mills theory can be interpreted as a two - band dual superconductor with an interband josephson coupling .",
    "this approach is based on a slave - boson decomposition @xcite used in the high - t@xmath2 superconductivity models ( similar decomposition used in gauge theories is named as a spin - charge separation @xcite @xcite ) .",
    "the color `` magnetic '' flux tubes which appear in qcd with high baryon density in ref s @xcite-@xcite are considered .",
    "qcd with high density at low temperature is in the color - flavor locked(cfl ) phase , where it exhibits color superconductivity . unlike color electric / magnetic fluxes in gluon plasma ,",
    "those color magnetic flux tubes are topologically and dynamically stable .",
    "they are a mixture of a superconductor vortex and a superfluid vortex and are called a semi - superfluid vortices .",
    "the color magnetic flux tubes also exist ( as bps vortices ) in supersymmetric qcd . in ref",
    "s @xcite-@xcite one can find reviews on this subject .",
    "why such connection between turbulence and quantum chromodynamics may exists ? in both cases we have the fluctuations : velocity , pressure and so on for a turbulent fluid in the first case and fields ( for example , su(3 ) gauge fields for quantum chromodynamics ) in the second case . in the turbulent fluid the fluctuations are statistical ones and in quantum field theory the fluctuations are quantum ones .",
    "the character of fluid flow depends on reynolds number @xmath3 @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the fluid density , @xmath6 is the fluid velocity , @xmath7 is a characteristic length for a given flow and @xmath8 is the fluid viscosity . if @xmath9 then the flow is laminar one , if @xmath10 then the flow is turbulent one . the open question in hydrodynamics is the creation of turbulence by @xmath11 .    in quantum field theory",
    "there are perturbative regime when a dimensionless coupling constant @xmath12 is small enough @xmath13 and nonperturbative regime when @xmath14 ( here @xmath15 is a dimension coupling constant , @xmath16 is planck constant and @xmath17 is the speed of light ) . in quantum field theory",
    "the open question is a nonperturbative quantization for @xmath14 .",
    "for example , the fine - structure constant in quantum electrodynamics is @xmath18 ( @xmath19 is the electron charge ) , @xmath20 for a weak interaction and @xmath14 for a strong interaction .",
    "here we propose a possible connection between hydrodynamics and quantum field theory based on a comparison between reynolds number ( in hydrodynamics ) and dimensionless coupling constant ( in quantum field theory ) .",
    "let us rewrite eq . in following form @xmath21 in such a way that @xmath22 = \\left [ 1/\\tilde g^2 \\right ]",
    "= g \\cdot cm^3 / s^2 $ ] , @xmath23 = \\left [ \\mu l^3 \\right ] = g \\cdot cm^3 / s$ ] .",
    "now we will assume that there is following relation @xmath24 it means that we have following correspondence    * @xmath25 .",
    "in this case a classical theory corresponds to an ideal fluid .",
    "* @xmath26 . in this case",
    "a laminar fluid corresponds to a perturbative regime of quantum field theory .",
    "* @xmath27 . in this case",
    "a turbulent fluid corresponds to a nonperturbative regime of quantum field theory .",
    "how we can use proposed here the similarity between hydrodynamics ans nonperturbative quantum field theory ? one can try to find in hydrodynamics an analog of flux tube from quantum chromodynamics .",
    "at first we will try to examine a static ideal and laminar fluids .",
    "the navier - stokes equations are @xmath28 here we consider incompressible fluid @xmath29 and @xmath30 is the kinematic viscosity . if the viscosity @xmath31 then we have the ideal fluid .",
    "we want to find cylindrically symmetric solution of the navier - stokes equations but not in a pipe .",
    "for the ideal @xmath32 and laminar fluids the equation is @xmath33 but @xmath34 for the flow along axes @xmath35 .",
    "consequently the solution for the ideal fluid does not exist .",
    "for the laminar fluid we have @xmath36 and this equation has a solution in a pipe only .",
    "only one possibility exists to have a nontrivial solution : it is necessary to have the correlation between @xmath37 and @xmath38 in the lhs of eq . .",
    "now we would like to consider a turbulent fluid .",
    "we will try to find an axially symmetric solutions .",
    "we consider the fluid in unbounded space with two sources located at the @xmath39 .",
    "then the equations are @xmath40 we assume that in the first approximation such flow can be described with fluctuating velocities @xmath41 that depend on @xmath42 only .",
    "we use the cylindrical coordinate system @xmath43 .",
    "the flow is along the axes @xmath35 : @xmath44 and @xmath45 , @xmath46 means the statistical overaging .",
    "remember that we consider the solutions in unbounded space , not in a pipe .",
    "now we can write equation for @xmath47 velocity @xmath48 unfortunately it is not too easy to write equation for @xmath37 velocity .",
    "for example , if we write equation in the form @xmath49 and after averaging we will have the correlation @xmath50 because @xmath45 .",
    "it happens because the terms @xmath51 and @xmath52 are not taking into account in eq . .    in order to write equation for @xmath37",
    "we multiply eq . on @xmath37 and only after that we average over the statistical fluctuations . in this case",
    "we assume that one can neglect with the terms @xmath51 and @xmath52 @xmath53 where @xmath54 .",
    "after some manipulations and averaging we have @xmath55 here we neglect with @xmath56 and @xmath57 terms in eq . .",
    "now we have to do some assumptions about correlations functions in .",
    "we should have the information about 2 and 3 points correlation functions .",
    "the most important simplification is that all correlation fuctions are described by one function @xmath58 : @xmath59 here @xmath60 and @xmath61 are some constants , @xmath62 .",
    "the correlation function is choosen in such way because we assume that @xmath63 and conjectural corrections to the first term @xmath64 can be only quadratic compositions : either @xmath65 or @xmath66 .",
    "for @xmath47 we have to use not @xmath47 but : @xmath67 @xmath68   \\label{2 - 150}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath69 is a constant indicating the difference in the scale between longitudinal velocity @xmath47 and the fluctuations of transversal velocity @xmath70 .    according to @xmath71",
    "thus we have following equation @xmath72",
    "now we would like to write equation for @xmath73 velocity component .",
    "after substitution into eq .",
    ", averaging over statistic fluctuation we have @xmath74 here the rhs is similar to the rhs of eq . and consequently similar calculations leads to @xmath75 here the number @xmath69 appears in the consequence of correlations .",
    "thus we have following set of equations for the longitudinal velocity component @xmath76 and fluctuating transversal velocity component @xmath37 @xmath77 where we have introduced dimensionless variables @xmath78 , @xmath79 , @xmath80 , @xmath81 , @xmath82 , @xmath83 and @xmath84 .",
    "the numerical solution of the set is presented in fig .",
    "let us note that the solution exists only for negative values @xmath85 .     and @xmath86 , @xmath87 .",
    "@xmath88 - curve 1 , @xmath86 - curve 2,width=453 ]    our interpretation of this solution is follows .",
    "there exists a turbulent flow moving in @xmath35 direction . in the flow",
    "exists a core ( tube ) with the velocity profile given in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , curve 1 ; the @xmath89component of the velocity at the infinity is @xmath90 ; the profile of statistical fluctuations describing by the function @xmath91 is given by curve 2 in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ; as @xmath92 then at the infinity the flow become laminar one .",
    "it means that we have to choose the solution in such a way that @xmath93 becomes small enough that flow becomes laminar one . in our opinion",
    "it is an analog of a flux tube filled with a gauge fields and stretched between quark and antiquark from quantum chromodynamics .",
    "such kind of solution is characterized by having a strongly pronounced core ( tube ) through which flows the turbulent fluid .",
    "such flux of the turbulent fluid may be inserted either into a flow of a laminar fluid @xmath94 ( that is more probably ) or in a rest fluid @xmath95 ( that is less probably ) .",
    "in summary we list the basic ideas and assumptions in presented approximation :    * all degrees of freedom are splitted into two parts : ordered movement @xmath76 and disordered fluctuations @xmath37 . *",
    "the correlation functions of the second and third orders are expressed in terms of one function ( one - function approximation ) .",
    "* the correlation function of the third order is expressed in terms of the correlation function of the second order .",
    "the last assumption allow us to cut off an infinite equations set relating all correlation functions of all orders .",
    "in this section we would like to show that similar calculations can be done in quantum chromodynamics .",
    "the basic assumptions will be same as listed at the end of section [ turbulence ] .    in this section",
    "we follow the conventions of ref .",
    "starting with the @xmath96 gauge group with generators @xmath97 we define the @xmath96 gauge fields , @xmath98 .",
    "let @xmath99 be a subgroup of @xmath96 and @xmath100 is a coset .",
    "then the gauge field @xmath101 can be decomposed as @xmath102 where the indices @xmath103 belongs to the subgroup g and @xmath104to the coset @xmath100 ; @xmath105 are @xmath96 indices . based on this",
    "the field strength can be decomposed as @xmath106 where @xmath107 where @xmath108 are the structural constants of @xmath96 .",
    "the @xmath96 yang - mills lagrangian can be decomposed as @xmath109 we will specialize to :    * the @xmath1 case when we let @xmath110 , @xmath111 , and @xmath112 ; the indices @xmath113 ( here @xmath114 is the absolutely antisymmetric levi - civita tensor ) . * the @xmath115 case when we let @xmath116 , @xmath117 ; the indices @xmath118 .",
    "for the first case one can assume that the fourth order green function can be decomposed as the product of the second order green functions and obtain ginzburg - landau lagrangian @xcite .    for our purposes",
    "the second case is more interesting : using all assumptions from section [ turbulence ] with some modifications we will show that in su(3 ) gauge theory exists a flux tube . in this case",
    "a longitudinal color electric field @xmath119 will be analog of the velocity @xmath76 and gauge potentials @xmath120 in the coset @xmath121 are the analog of fluctuating transversal velocity @xmath37 .    in quantizing the classical field equations system ( via heisenberg s non - perturbative method @xcite ) one first replaces the classical fields by field operators @xmath122 .",
    "this yields the following yang - mills equations for the operators @xmath123 these nonlinear equations for the field operators of the nonlinear quantum fields can be used to determine expectation values for the field operators @xmath124 , where @xmath125 and @xmath126 is some quantum state .",
    "one can also use these equations to determine the expectation values of operators that are built up from the fundamental operators @xmath124 .",
    "for example , the `` electric '' field operator , @xmath127 giving the expectation @xmath128 .",
    "the simple gauge field expectation values , @xmath129 , are obtained by average eq . over some quantum state @xmath126 @xmath130 one problem in using these equations to obtain expectation values like @xmath131 , is that these equations involve not only powers or derivatives of @xmath131 ( _ i.e. _ terms like @xmath132 or @xmath133 ) but also contain terms like @xmath134 . starting with eq .",
    "one can generate an operator differential equation for the product @xmath135 thus allowing the determination of the green function @xmath136 @xmath137 however this equation will in turn contain other , higher order green functions .",
    "repeating these steps leads to an infinite set of equations connecting green functions of ever increasing order .",
    "this construction , leading to an infinite set of coupled , differential equations , does not have an exact , analytical solution and so must be handled using some approximation . _",
    "the problem is the same as in the turbulent theory . _    for obtaining a tube - like solution in su(3 )",
    "gauge theory we do similar assumptions as in section [ turbulence ] ( here we follow to @xcite ) :    * the gauge field components @xmath138 belonging to the small subgroup @xmath1 are in an ordered phase : @xmath139 @xmath140 is the analog of @xmath76 . * the gauge field components @xmath141 ) are in a disordered phase : @xmath142 * the 2-point green function @xmath143 approximately are @xmath144 here @xmath145 is a real triplet scalar fields .",
