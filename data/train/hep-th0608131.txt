    "similarly , the existence of ( @xmath110)-form rr field in the internal dimensions can induce nonzero logarithmic bounce for @xmath42 .",
    "however , as far as the condition @xmath54 is satisfied , the overall behavior of @xmath42 is essentially the same ( see fig .",
    "3 ) .     for unwrapped subvolume when there exists ( @xmath110)-form rr field in the internal dimensions .",
    "the plot is for @xmath111 , @xmath112 , and @xmath113 , width=302 ]",
    "in the framework of brane gas cosmology , we considered the asymmetric evolution of the universe .",
    "we showed that , provided the dilaton is stabilized by some mechanism , brane gas and rr potential can stabilize the internal dimensions . for a combination of @xmath0-brane gas wrapping the extra dimension and 4-form rr flux in the unwrapped dimensions , it is possible that the wrapped internal subvolume has an oscillating solution around the minimum of the effective potential while the unwrapped subvolume expands monotonically .",
    "one key point of this paper is bulk rr field .",
    "the role of this field is to prevent the internal subvolume from collapsing to zero .",
    "it gives a logarithmic bounce to the effective potential for small values of internal subvolume .",
    "another is the decoupling of the observed and internal dimensions by introducing an integration parameter . with this decoupling",
    ", we could treat the problem analytically in terms of two subvolumes rather than scale factors .",
    "in our analysis we considered only brane gases for the matter part of the einstein equation .",
    "however , there can be supergravity particles corresponding to bosonic and fermionic degrees of freedom",
    ". one can ignore the massive modes since these will decay quickly .",
    "for the massless supergravity particles , if we assume they are homogeneous and isotropic , we can take a perfect fluid form of energy momentum tensor t^m_n = diag ( -_s , p_s , , p_s ) .",
    "it is well known that this term always tends to drive uniform expansion .",
    "so the main result of our analysis will not be changed even if we include the massless supergravity particles . to have more complete stabilization like the one in @xcite , where the extra dimensions are stabilized at the self - dual radius",
    ", one can include the effect of other sources .",
    "for example , including the effect of momentum modes or running dilaton may give damped oscillatory solution in which @xmath41 is driven to the minimum of the potential .",
    "we would like to point out that the configuration in this work is just one of the possibilities to achieve the anisotropic expansion . to make anisotropic expansion between the scale factors of the observed @xmath114 and those of @xmath115 , we considered the configuration where a gas of positive - tension @xmath0-branes wrap the internal dimension . an alternative way to achieve the same anisotropic expansion is to use a gas of negative - tension 3-branes wrapping the observed dimensions .",
    "other combinations of brane gas and rr flux may give more desirable result .",
