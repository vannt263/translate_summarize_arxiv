    "this article is concerned with a programme that has as its goal the development of a theory of quantum space - time . in this programme ,",
    "an outline of which will be given in more detail shortly , an important role is played by certain higher - dimensional analogues of spinors and twistors .",
    "it will be useful to begin , therefore , by remarking that there are two distinct notions of how one extends the concept of spinor into higher dimensions .",
    "this fundamental dichotomy arises in association with the fact that in four - dimensional space - time there is a local isomorphism between the lorentz group @xmath0 and the spin transformation group @xmath1 . in higher dimensions",
    ", however , this relation breaks down and as a consequence we are left with two concepts of spinors ",
    "one for the group @xmath2 , and one for the group @xmath3 .",
    "the spinors associated with @xmath2 , where we allow also for various possible signatures in the quadratic form defining these orthogonal or pseudo - orthogonal transformations when we specialise to the real subgroup @xmath4 with @xmath5 , are the so - called cartan spinors  @xcite .",
    "the study of cartan spinors has a long and interesting history , and there is a beautiful geometry associated with these spinors .",
    "there are also various specific cases of great interest  for example , the cartan spinors associated with the group @xmath6 are penrose s twistors ; and the cartan spinors associated with @xmath7 are intimately linked with the cayley numbers ( octonions ) and the exceptional lie groups .",
    "there are also a number of interesting connections between cartan spinors and massless fields in higher dimensions  @xcite .",
    "the spinors associated with @xmath3 , which are usually now called ` hyperspinors ' , have the advantage of being more directly linked with quantum mechanics .",
    "in fact , we shall show later that a naturally relativistic model for hyperspin arises when one considers ` multiplets ' of two - component spinors , i.e. expressions of the form @xmath8 and @xmath9 , where @xmath10 are standard spinor indices , and @xmath11 is an ` internal ' index . in the general case ( @xmath12 ) we then think of @xmath8 as an element of the tensor product space @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the complex vector space of two - component spinors , and @xmath15 is an infinite - dimensional complex hilbert space .",
    "there is also a link , arising through a further extension of this idea , between hyperspinor theory and the theory of multi - twistor ( hypertwistor ) systems .",
    "indeed , we find that the theory of hyperspin constitutes a natural starting place for building up a theory of quantum geometry or , as we shall call it here , _",
    "quantum space - time_. in summary , we shall be taking the left - hand path in the following diagram :    ( 300,100)(0,0 ) ( 155,80)@xmath16 ( 125,8)@xmath3 ( 240,8)@xmath2 ( 105,-5)hyperspinors  @xmath17 ( 225,-5)cartan spinors ( 196,72)(-1,-1)50 ( 204,72)(1,-1)50    the hyperspinor route has the virtue that the resulting space - time has a rich causal structure associated with it , and as a consequence is unusually well - positioned to form the geometrical basis of a physical theory .",
    "to start , let us review briefly the role of two - component spinors in the description of four - dimensional minkowskian space - time geometry . in what follows we use bold upright roman letters to denote two - component spinor indices ,",
    "and we adopt the standard conventions for the algebra of two - component spinors  @xcite",
    ". then we have the following correspondence between two - by - two hermitian matrices and space - time points , relative to some origin : @xmath18 more explicitly , in a standard basis this correspondence is given by @xmath19 we then have the fundamental relation @xmath20 from which it follows that two - component spinors are connected both with quantum mechanics and with the causal structure of space - time .",
    "it is a peculiar aspect of relativistic physics that there is this link between ( a ) the spin degrees of freedom of spin one - half particles , and ( b ) the causal geometry of four - dimensional space - time .",
    "let us pursue this idea now in a little more detail , and then extend it to higher dimensions .",
    "for the interval @xmath21 between a pair of points @xmath22 and @xmath23 in minkowski space - time we write @xmath24 from which it follows that @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the antisymmetric spinor .",
    "hence if we adopt the standard ` index clumping ' convention and write @xmath27 , @xmath28 , and so on , according to which a pair of spinor indices , one primed and the other unprimed , corresponds to a lower case space - time vector index , then we can write @xmath29 for the corresponding squared space - time interval , and thus we are able to identity @xmath30 as the metric of minkowski space .",
    "there are essentially three different situations that can arise for the interval @xmath31 , each of which represents a certain level of degeneracy .",
    "the first case is @xmath32 ; the second case is @xmath33 and @xmath34 ; and the third case is @xmath35 .",
    "each of these cases gives rise to a canonical form for the interval @xmath36 , with various sub - cases , which can be summarised as follows :    * @xmath32 : @xmath37 * @xmath38 : @xmath39 * @xmath40 : @xmath41    _ causal structure of four - dimensional space - time_. the canonical form of the spinor decomposition of the four - vector associated with a space - time interval determines its causal properties . ]    here it is understood that in case ( iii ) the spinors @xmath42 and @xmath43 do not coincide in direction .",
    "it is interesting to note that once the canonical form for @xmath21 is specified , then so is the causal relationship that it determines on space - time .",
    "this correspondence is illustrated in figure  [ fig:1 ] .",
    "on the other hand , the specification of @xmath36 does not completely determine the spinors @xmath44 and @xmath43 .",
    "in general there is some freedom , and this is expressed by a group of transformations .",
    "in particular , if @xmath36 is null , then this freedom is the phase shift @xmath45 , and the relevant group is @xmath46 .",
    "if @xmath36 is time - like , then the group is @xmath47 , and if @xmath36 is space - like , the group is @xmath48 .",
    "the terminology ` hyperspinor ' is due to finkelstein  @xcite . essentially the same concept ( although introduced for different purposes )",
    "is also touched on in @xcite .",
    "the idea of a hyperspinor is a simple one  we replace the two - component spinors associated with four - dimensional space - time with @xmath49-component spinors .",
    "thus we can regard hyperspin space as the vector space @xmath50 with some extra structure .",
    "in particular , in addition to the original hyperspin space we have three other vector spaces  the dual hyperspin space , the complex conjugate hyperspin space , and the dual complex conjugate hyperspin space .    the theory of hyperspin has been pursued by a number of authors  @xcite , and the material we describe here builds on various aspects of this work .",
    "let us write @xmath51 and @xmath52 , respectively , for the complex @xmath49-dimensional vector spaces of unprimed and primed hyperspinors .",
    "for hyperspinors we use italic indices to distinguish them from the boldface indices used exclusively for two - component spinors .",
    "it is assumed that @xmath51 and @xmath52 are related by an anti - linear isomorphism under the operation of complex conjugation .",
    "thus if @xmath53 , then under complex conjugation we have @xmath54 , where @xmath55 .",
    "the dual spaces associated with @xmath51 and @xmath52 are denoted @xmath56 and @xmath57 , respectively . if @xmath53 and @xmath58 , then their inner product is denoted @xmath59 .",
    "likewise if @xmath60 and @xmath61 then their inner product is @xmath62 .",
    "we also introduce the totally antisymmetric hyperspinors of rank @xmath49 associated with the spaces @xmath51 , @xmath63 , @xmath52 , and @xmath57 .",
    "these will be denoted @xmath64 , @xmath65 , @xmath66 , and @xmath67 , respectively .",
    "the choice of these antisymmetric hyperspinors is unique up to an overall scale factor .",
    "once a choice has been made for @xmath65 , then the other epsilon hyperspinors are determined by the relations @xmath68 where @xmath69 is the complex conjugate of @xmath65 .",
    "now let @xmath70 denote the skew tensor product space @xmath71 . using an analogous notation",
    ", we introduce the spaces @xmath72 , @xmath73 , and @xmath74 for each @xmath75 .",
    "then once the epsilon hyperspinors have been fixed we have a collection of maps of the form @xmath76 as a consequence , a wide range of algebraic theorems can be formulated , which are useful in calculations .",
    "for example , if @xmath77 then @xmath78 must be of the form @xmath79 for some @xmath80 .",
    "now we introduce the complex matrix space @xmath81 .",
    "an element @xmath82 is said to be _ real _ if it satisfies the ( weak ) hermitian property @xmath83 , where @xmath84 is the complex conjugate of @xmath85 .",
    "we shall have more to say about weak versus strong hermiticity conditions in relation to the idea of symmetry breaking .",
    "we denote the vector space of real elements of @xmath86 by @xmath87 .",
    "the elements of @xmath88 constitute what we call the real quantum space - time @xmath89 of dimension @xmath90 .",
    "we then regard @xmath91 as the complexification of @xmath89 .",
    "many problems in @xmath89 are best first approached as problems in @xmath92 , and hence sometimes although we refer to @xmath89 our operations are actually carried out in @xmath92 .",
    "let @xmath85 and @xmath93 be points in @xmath89 , and write @xmath94 for the corresponding separation vector , which is independent of the choice of origin . using the index - clumping convention we set @xmath95 , @xmath96 , @xmath97 , and for the separation of @xmath98 and @xmath99 in @xmath89 we write @xmath100 .",
    "there is a natural causal structure induced on such intervals by the so - called ` chronometric tensor ' . making use of the index - clumping convention",
    ", we define this fundamental tensor ( introduced by finkelstein  @xcite ) by the following basic relation : @xmath101 the chronometric tensor , which is of rank @xmath49 , is totally symmetric and is nondegenerate in the sense that for any vector @xmath31 the condition @xmath102 implies @xmath103 .",
    "we say that @xmath98 and @xmath99 in @xmath89 have a ` degenerate ' separation if the chronometric form @xmath104 vanishes for @xmath100 .",
    "degenerate separation is equivalent to the vanishing of the determinant of the matrix @xmath105 , that is , @xmath106",
    "if the hyperspin space has dimension @xmath107 , this reduces to the usual condition for @xmath98 and @xmath99 to be null - separated in minkowski space . for @xmath108 , however , the situation is more complicated since there are various degrees of degeneracy that can arise between two points of quantum space - time , of which ` nullness ' ( in the minkowskian sense ) is only the most extreme .    as an example , consider @xmath109 .",
    "in this case the quantum space - time has dimension nine , and the chronometric form is given by @xmath110 the different possibilities that can arise for the separation vector are as follows :    * @xmath111 : @xmath112 * @xmath113 and @xmath114 : @xmath115 * @xmath116 and @xmath117 : @xmath118 * @xmath119 and @xmath120 : @xmath121    when the separation of two points of quantum space - time is degenerate , we define the ` degree ' of degeneracy by the rank of the matrix @xmath105 .",
    "null separation is the case for which the degeneracy is of the first degree , i.e. where @xmath105 is of rank one , and thus satisfies a system of quadratic relations of the following form : @xmath122 or equivalently @xmath123 this implies that @xmath105 can be expressed in the ` null ' form @xmath124 for some @xmath125 . in the case of degeneracy of the second degree , @xmath105 is of rank two and satisfies a set of cubic relations given by @xmath126 or equivalently @xmath127 in this situation @xmath105 can be put into one of the following three canonical forms :    * @xmath128 , * @xmath129 , * @xmath130 .    in case ( a ) , @xmath98 lies to the future of @xmath99 , and @xmath31 can be thought of as a degenerate future - pointing time - like vector . in case",
    "( b ) , @xmath31 can be thought of as a degenerate space - like separation . in case ( c )",
    ", @xmath98 lies to the past of @xmath99 , and @xmath31 is a degenerate past - pointing time - like vector .",
    "a similar analysis can be applied to degenerate separations of other ` intermediate ' degrees .",
    "if the determinant of the @xmath49-by-@xmath49 weakly hermitian matrix @xmath105 is nonvanishing , and @xmath105 is thus of maximal rank , then the chronometric form @xmath131 is nonvanishing . in that case",
    "the matrix @xmath105 can be represented in the following canonical form : @xmath132 with the presence of @xmath49 nonvanishing terms , where the @xmath49 hyperspinors @xmath133 are all linearly independent .",
    "let us write @xmath134 for the numbers of plus and minus signs appearing in the canonical form for the matrix @xmath105 given above .",
    "we call @xmath134 the ` signature ' of @xmath105 .",
    "the hyperspinors @xmath135 are determined by the specification of @xmath105 only up to an overall unitary ( or pseudo - unitary ) transformation of the form @xmath136 where @xmath137 , and @xmath138 the signature @xmath134 is nevertheless an invariant of @xmath105 . in the cases for which the signature is @xmath139 or",
    "@xmath140 we say that @xmath105 is future - pointing time - like or past - pointing time - like , respectively .",
    "then recalling the definition ( [ eq:10 ] ) for the associated chronometric form , we define the ` proper time interval ' between the events @xmath98 and @xmath141 by the formula @xmath142 in the case @xmath107 we then recover the standard minkowskian proper - time interval between the given events .",
    "a remarkable feature of the causal structure of quantum space - time is that the essential physical features of the causal structure of minkowski space are preserved . in particular",
    ", the space of future - pointing time - like vectors forms a convex cone .",
    "the same is true when we consider the structure of the associated momentum space , from which it follows that we can also give a good definition of what is meant by ` positive energy ' .",
    "now suppose that @xmath143 defines a smooth curve @xmath144 in @xmath89 for @xmath145\\subset{\\mathbb r}$ ] .",
    "then @xmath144 will be said to be time - like if the tangent vector along @xmath144 , @xmath146 is time - like and future - pointing . in that case",
    "we define the proper time @xmath147 elapsed along @xmath144 by the integral @xmath148^{\\frac{1}{r } } { { \\rm d}}\\lambda .",
    "\\label{eq:21}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in the case of a very small interval , we can also write this in the ` pseudo - finslerian ' form @xmath149 in the case @xmath107 this clearly reduces to the standard pseudo - riemannian expression for the line element .

    ", we can choose the proper time as the parameter along the curve , in which case the resulting affine parameterisation of the curve is determined up to transformations of the form @xmath153 where @xmath154 is a constant .",
    "the equation of motion for the situation in which @xmath144 is a time - like geodesic is obtained by an application of the calculus of variations to formula ( [ eq:21 ] ) . as usual , we assume the variation vanishes at the endpoints .",
    "writing @xmath155 a standard argument shows that @xmath152 describes a geodesic only if the velocity vector @xmath156 satisfies the euler - lagrange equation @xmath157 a calculation shows that this condition is given more explicitly by @xmath158 where @xmath159 if @xmath160 is chosen to be proper time , then @xmath161 and the geodesic equation takes to form @xmath162 where the dot denotes differentiation with respect to proper time .",
    "in the case @xmath107 the geodesic equation ( [ eq:26 ] ) reduces to the familiar relation @xmath163 .",
    "we shall now show that the geodesic equation also implies @xmath163 in the case of a general quantum space - time with @xmath108 .",
    "it suffices to examine the case @xmath109 , which will indicate the relevant line of argument . for @xmath109",
    "the geodesic equation takes the form @xmath164 which can be expressed in terms of hyperspinors in the form @xmath165 this relation can then be written @xmath166 because @xmath167 we know that @xmath168 has an inverse @xmath169 satisfying @xmath170 therefore , contracting ( [ eq:28 ] ) with @xmath171 we obtain @xmath172 this equation shows that if @xmath173 were not zero , then it would have to be proportional to @xmath174 .",
    "however , if that were so , then @xmath175 would imply @xmath176 , contrary to the assumption that @xmath174 is time - like .",
    "it follows that @xmath163 .",
    "a similar argument shows that for all @xmath177 the geodesic equation ( [ eq:26 ] ) implies @xmath163 .",
    "hence we have deduced the following result .",
    "let @xmath99 and @xmath178 be quantum space - time points with the property that @xmath179 is time - like and future - pointing",
    ". then the affinely parametrised geodesic @xmath144 connecting these points in @xmath89 is given by @xmath180^{1/r}}\\ , s\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for @xmath181 , where @xmath182",
    "it is a straightforward exercise to verify that the chronometric form @xmath131 for the separation between two points is invariant when the points of @xmath89 are subjected to transformations of the following type : @xmath183 here @xmath184 represents an arbitrary translation in quantum space - time , @xmath185 is an element of @xmath186 , and @xmath187 is the complex conjugate of @xmath188 .",
    "the relation of this group of transformations to the poincar group in the case @xmath107 should be apparent .",
    "indeed , one of the attractive features of the extension of space - time geometry that we are putting forward here is that the hyper - poincar group allows such a description , which implies a wide range of intuitively plausible physical features .",
    "more generally , we remark that the proper hyper - poincar group preserves the signature of any space - time interval , whether or not the interval is degenerate , and hence leaves the causal relations between events unchanged .",
    "we refer to a transformation of the form @xmath189 as a ` hyper - lorentz transformation ' if @xmath190 for some element @xmath191 . in the case of minkowski space ( @xmath107 ) it is well known that a two - component spinor @xmath192 can be represented by a complex null bivector @xmath193 conversely , the bivector @xmath194 determines @xmath195 up to the transformation @xmath196 this geometrical ambiguity is often referred to as the fundamental ` two - valuedness ' of two - component spinors in relativity theory . in the case of a general quantum space - time of dimension @xmath90 , a hyperspinor @xmath197 can be represented by a complex null @xmath49-vector ( antisymmetric tensor of rank @xmath49 ) of the form @xmath198 the @xmath49-vector @xmath199 is ` null ' in the sense that @xmath200 then @xmath199 determines @xmath197 up to transformations of the form @xmath201 where @xmath202 .",
    "hence we can say that hyperspinors have a fundamental ` @xmath49-valuedness ' ( cf .",
    "holm  @xcite ) .",
    "the real dimension of the hyper - lorentz group is @xmath203 , and thus the real dimension of the hyper - poincar group is @xmath204 .",
    "we observe that the dimension of the hyper - poincar group grows linearly with the dimension of the quantum space - time itself , which is given by @xmath90 .",
    "this can be contrasted with the dimension of the group arising if we endow @xmath205 with a standard lorentzian metric with signature @xmath206 . in that case",
    "the associated pseudo - orthogonal group has real dimension @xmath207 , which together with the translation group gives a total dimension of @xmath208 .",
    "the parsimonious dimensionality of the hyper - poincar group arises from the fact that it preserves the system of causal relations holding between pairs of points in quantum space - time .    in a flat four - dimensional space - time",
    "the symmetries of the poincar group are associated with a ten - parameter family of killing vectors .",
    "thus , for @xmath107 we have the minkowski metric ( [ eq:7 ] ) , and the poincar group is generated by the ten - parameter family of vector fields @xmath209 on @xmath210 satisfying @xmath211 where @xmath212 denotes the lie derivative with respect to @xmath209 . for any vector field @xmath209 and any symmetric tensor field @xmath213",
    "we have @xmath214 if @xmath213 is the metric and @xmath215 denotes the associated covariant derivative satisfying @xmath216 we obtain the killing equation @xmath217 where @xmath218 .",
    "the condition @xmath219 therefore implies that @xmath220 is a killing vector .    for @xmath108",
    "we have no riemannian metric , and the usual relations between symmetries and killing vectors are lost .",
    "what survives , however , is of interest . specifically , to generate a symmetry of the quantum space - time the vector field @xmath209 has to satisfy @xmath221 where @xmath222 is the chronometric tensor . for a general vector field @xmath209 and a general symmetric tensor field @xmath222",
    "we have @xmath223 in the case of the quantum space - time @xmath89 we let @xmath224 be the natural flat connection for which @xmath225 then to generate a symmetry of the chronometric structure of @xmath89 the vector field @xmath209 has to satisfy @xmath226 equation ( [ eq:4.5 ] ) can be written in an alternative form if we define a symmetric tensor @xmath227 of rank @xmath228 by setting @xmath229 then ( [ eq:4.5 ] ) says that @xmath227 satisfies the conditions for a symmetric killing tensor : @xmath230 thus we see that @xmath89 provides an example of a symmetry group generated by a family of killing tensors .",
    "the symmetries of the quantum space - time are generated , more specifically , by a system of @xmath204 irreducible symmetric killing tensors of rank @xmath228 .",
    "the significance of killing tensors is that they are associated with conserved quantities .",
    "for other examples of killing tensors arising in a physical context , see , e.g. , @xcite . in the present",
    "setting it follows that if the vector field @xmath231 satisfies the geodesic equation , which on a quantum space - time of dimension @xmath90 is given , as we have seen , by @xmath232 and if @xmath227 is the killing tensor of rank @xmath228 given by ( [ eq:4.6 ] ) , then we have the following conservation law : @xmath233 in other words , the quantity @xmath234 is a constant of the motion .",
    "it follows from the material of the previous section that in higher - dimensional quantum space - times the main conservation laws and symmetry principles of relativistic physics remain intact .",
    "in particular , the conservation of hyper - relativistic momentum and angular momentum for a system of interacting particles can be given a well - defined formulation , the basic principles of which are similar to those applicable in the minkowskian case .",
    "for this purpose it will be useful to introduce the notion of an ` elementary system ' in hyper - relativistic mechanics .",
    "such a system is defined by its hyper - relativistic momentum and angular momentum .",
    "the hyper - relativistic momentum of an elementary system is given by a momentum covector @xmath235 .",
    "the associated mass @xmath236 is given ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) by the following natural expression : @xmath237 the hyper - relativistic angular momentum of an elementary system is given by a tensor @xmath238 of the form @xmath239 where the hyperspinor @xmath240 is required to be trace - free : @xmath241 . the angular momentum is defined with respect to a choice of origin in such a manner that under a change of origin defined by a shift vector @xmath242 we have @xmath243 in the case @xmath107 these formulae reduce to the usual expressions for relativistic momentum and angular momentum in a minkowskian setting .",
    "the real covector @xmath244 is invariant under a change of origin , and carries the interpretation of the intrinsic spin of the elementary system .",
    "the magnitude of the spin is then defined by @xmath245 in the case of a set of interacting hyper - relativistic systems we require that the total momentum and angular momentum should be conserved .",
    "this then implies conservation of the total mass and spin . in short",
    ", we see that the idea of ` relativistic mechanics ' carries through nicely to the case of a general quantum space - time .    now what is the interpretation of these conservation laws ?",
    "we shall show later , once we introduce the idea of symmetry breaking , that hypermomentum can be interpreted as the momentum operator for a relativistic quantum system .",
    "conservation of hypermomentum then can be thought of as conservation of four - momentum in relativistic quantum mechanics in the heisenberg representation .",
    "in four - dimensional space - time it is useful in many contexts to examine the geometry of the space of complex null vectors at a point in the space - time .",
    "this has the effect of giving us a vivid picture of the local causal relationships in space - time , and by sticking with a complex picture we also retain the link with quantum mechanics .",
    "thus we consider complex vectors @xmath178 satisfying the quadratic equation @xmath246 in spinor terms this relation implies that the corresponding complex matrix @xmath247 is of the special form @xmath248 the space of complex vectors at a point in minkowski space is @xmath249 .",
    "the space of complex directions ( which results if we consider equivalence class of vectors modulo overall proportionality ) is the complex projective 3-space @xmath250 .",
    "the null directions constitute a quadric @xmath251 in that space , which owing to the decomposition ( [ eq:7.1 ] ) has the structure of a doubly ruled surface @xmath252 we can identify the first set of lines ( the @xmath253-lines ) with the projective unprimed spinors , and the second set of lines ( the @xmath254-lines ) with the projective primed spinors .",
    "the quadric @xmath251 is ruled in such a way that two lines of the same type do not intersect , whereas two lines of the opposite type intersect at a point in @xmath251 ( see figure  [ fig:2 ] ) .",
    "this point corresponds to the null direction they jointly determine .",

    "much more detail , along with specific examples for various choices of the equation of state , can be found in @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to note that more or less the same state of affairs prevails in higher dimensions ( see figure  [ fig:11 ] for an example of a sixteen - dimensional class of ` quantum cosmologies ' analogous to the @xmath429 friedmann - robertson - walker models ) . in other words ,",
    "the choice of structure at infinity gives rise to various possible global structures for the quantum space - time , and in particular , to a chronometric form that is in general not flat , thus making @xmath392 a cosmological model . in the case of a standard four - dimensional cosmological model based on einstein s",
    "theory , the existence of structure at ( or ` beyond ' ) infinity has a bearing on the geometry of space - time alone . in the case of a quantum cosmology ,",
    "however , the structure at infinity also has implications for microscopic physics .",
    "for instance , whereas in the four - dimensional de  sitter cosmology the relevant structure at infinity contains the ` invariant ' information of one dimensional constant ( the cosmological constant ) , in the higher - dimensional situation there are in general a number of such constants that may emerge as geometrical invariants of the theory . thus within a single geometric framework one has the scope for introducing structure ( or what amounts to the same thing  the breaking of symmetry ) both on a global or cosmological scale , as well as on the microscopic scales of distance , time , and energy associated with the phenomenology of elementary particles .",
    "one might say that in these models the structure at infinity is playing the role of the higgs fields .",
    "one can even envisage the possibility of explaining , in a purely geometrical language , the basis of the remarkable coincidences involving various fundamental constants of nature that have puzzled physicists for many decades .",
    "as a prelude to our discussion of the idea of symmetry breaking in quantum space - time , we digress briefly to review the notions of weak and strong hermiticity .",
    "this material is relevant to the origin of unitarity in quantum mechanics . intuitively speaking",
    ", we observe that when the weak hermiticity condition is imposed on a hyperspinor @xmath85 representing a space - time event , then @xmath85 belongs to the real subspace @xmath87 . as such",
    ", the hyper - relativistic symmetry of quantum space - time is not affected by the imposition of this condition .",
    "if , however , we break the hyper - relativistic symmetry by selecting a preferred time - like direction , then we can speak of a stronger reality condition whereby an isomorphism is established between the primed and unprimed hyperspin spaces .",
    "we begin with the weak hermitian property .",
    "let @xmath51 denote , as before , an @xmath49-dimensional complex vector space .",
    "we also introduce the associated spaces @xmath56 , @xmath451 , and @xmath57 . in general , there is no natural isomorphism between @xmath52 and @xmath56 .",
    "therefore , there is no natural matrix multiplication law or trace operation defined for elements of @xmath452 .",
    "nevertheless , certain matrix operations are well defined .",
    "for example , the determinant of a generic element @xmath453 is given by @xmath454 the weak hermitian property is also well - defined .",
    "in particular , if @xmath455 is the complex conjugate of @xmath453 , then we say that @xmath453 is weakly hermitian if @xmath456 .",
    "as we have observed , for many applications , weak hermiticity suffices .",
    "now we consider the strong hermitian property . in some situations there",
    "may exist a natural map @xmath457 defined by the context of the particular problem .",
    "such a map is called a hermitian correlation . in this case",
    ", the complex conjugate of an element @xmath53 determines an element @xmath458 .",
    "for any element @xmath459 we define the operations of determinant , matrix multiplication , and trace in the usual manner .",
    "the determinant is @xmath460 and the hermitian conjugate of @xmath461 is @xmath462 .",
    "the hermitian correlation is given by the choice of a preferred element @xmath463 .",
    "then we write @xmath464 where @xmath465 is now called the complex conjugate of @xmath466 .",
    "when there is a hermitian correlation @xmath467 , we call the condition @xmath468 the strong hermitian property .    thus once we break the relativistic invariance by introducing a preferred element @xmath469 that determines a hermitian correlation , we may carry out specific calculations in that frame . to gain a better understanding of this ,",
    "consider an event in complex minkowski space defined by its separation @xmath470 from the origin .",
    "the complex conjugate of @xmath470 is @xmath471 , so @xmath470 is real if @xmath472 .",
    "let @xmath473 be a fixed time - like vector satisfying @xmath474 .",
    "with respect to this choice of @xmath473 , the trace of @xmath475 is defined by @xmath476 once @xmath473 is fixed , we may represent @xmath470 in terms of pauli matrices , according to which @xmath470 admits a matrix representation of the form ( [ eq:2 ] ) .",
    "the time variable is then given by @xmath477 and the minkowski metric is given by the determinant ( [ eq:3 ] ) .",
    "we can also define a commutator for a pair of space - time position vectors @xmath470 and @xmath478 by setting @xmath479 the geometrical meaning of ( [ eq:113 ] ) is that @xmath247 corresponds to the ordinary 3-space cross - product of the projection of the vectors @xmath470 and @xmath478 onto the space - like hyperplane orthogonal to @xmath473 that passes through the origin .",
    "analogously , we can discuss the ` spectral ' properties of vectors with respect to a given choice of @xmath473 and a given choice of origin in space - time .",
    "the two eigenvalues of @xmath470 are then given by @xmath480 .",
    "thus two such vectors @xmath470 and @xmath478 are isospectral if and only if they lie on a common sphere about the origin lying in the given space - like hyperplane .",
    "similar remarks apply to higher - dimensional quantum space - times .",
    "now we proceed to introduce a natural mechanism for symmetry breaking that arises in the case of a standard ` flat ' quantum space - time endowed with the canonical structures associated with reality and infinity .",
    "we shall make the point in particular that the breaking of symmetry in quantum space - time is intimately linked to the notion of quantum entanglement . according to this point of view the introduction of symmetry - breaking in the early stages of the universe",
    "can be understood as a phase transition , or a sequence of phase transitions , the ultimate consequence of which is an approximate disentanglement of a four - dimensional ` classical ' space - time .    in practical terms",
    "the breaking of symmetry is represented in our framework by an ` index decomposition ' . in particular ,",
    "if the dimension @xmath49 of the hyperspin space is not a prime number , then a natural method of breaking the symmetry arises by consideration of the decomposition of @xmath49 into factors .",
    "the specific essential assumption that we shall make at this juncture will be that the dimension of the hyperspin space @xmath51 is _",
    "even_. then we write @xmath481 , where @xmath482 , and set @xmath483 where @xmath484 is a standard two - component spinor index , and @xmath485 will be called an ` internal ' index @xmath486 .",
    "thus we can write @xmath487 , where @xmath488 is a standard spin space of dimension two , and @xmath489 is a complex vector space of dimension @xmath490 .",
    "the breaking of the symmetry then amounts to the fact that we can identify the hyperspin space with the tensor product of these two spaces .",
    "we shall assume , moreover , that @xmath489 is endowed with a strong hermitian structure , i.e. we shall assume that there is a canonical anti - linear isomorphism between the complex conjugate of the internal space @xmath489 and the dual space @xmath491 .",
    "if @xmath492 , then we write @xmath493 for the complex conjugate of @xmath494 , where @xmath495 .",
    "we see therefore that @xmath496 is a complex hilbert space  and indeed although here we consider for technical simplicity the case for which @xmath490 is finite , one should have in mind also the general infinite dimensional situation . for the other hyperspin spaces we write @xmath497 respectively .",
    "these equivalences preserve the duality between @xmath51 and @xmath56 , and between @xmath451 and @xmath57 ; and at the same time are consistent with the complex conjugation relations between @xmath51 and @xmath52 , and between @xmath63 and @xmath57 . hence if @xmath498 then under complex conjugation we have @xmath499 , and if @xmath500 then @xmath501 .",
    "in the case of a quantum space - time vector @xmath105 we have a corresponding structure induced by the identification @xmath502 when the quantum space - time vector is real , the weak hermitian structure on @xmath105 is manifested in the form of a standard weak hermitian structure on the two - component spinor index pair , together with a strong hermitian structure on the internal index pair .",
    "in other words , the hermitian condition on the space - time vector @xmath105 is given by @xmath503    one consequence of these relations is that we can interpret each point in quantum space - time as being a space - time valued operator .",
    "the ordinary classical space - time then ` sits ' inside the quantum space - time in a canonical manner ",
    "namely , as the locus of those points of quantum space - time that factorise into the product of a space - time point @xmath470 and the identity operator on the internal space : @xmath504 thus , in situations where special relativity is a satisfactory theory , we regard the relevant events as taking place on or in the immediate neighbourhood of this embedding of minkowski space in @xmath505 .    this picture can be presented in more geometric terms as follows .",
    "the hypertwistor space @xmath305 in the case @xmath481 admits a segr embedding of the form @xmath506 many such embeddings are possible , though they are all equivalent to one another under the action of the overall symmetry group @xmath507 . if the symmetry is broken and one such embedding is selected out , then following the conventions discussed earlier we can introduce homogeneous coordinates and write @xmath508 for the hypertwistor . here",
    "the greek letter @xmath509 denotes an ordinary twistor index @xmath510 and @xmath485 denotes an internal index @xmath511 .",
    "these two indices , when clumped together , constitutes a hypertwister index . the segr embedding consists of those points in @xmath512 for which we have a product decomposition of the associated hypertwistor given by @xmath513    the idea of symmetry breaking that we are putting forward here is related to the notion of disentanglement in standard quantum mechanics ( cf .",
    "gibbons 1992 ; brody & hughston 2001 ) . that is to say , at the unified level",
    "the degrees of freedom associated with space - time symmetry are quantum mechanically entangled with the internal degrees of freedom associated with microscopic physics .",
    "the phenomena responsible for the breakdown of symmetry are thus analogous to the mechanisms of decoherence through which quantum entanglements are gradually diminished .",
    "some readers may raise the objection that surely it is impossible to unify the unitary symmetries of elementary particle phenomenology with the symmetries of space - time ( cf .",
    ", e.g. , @xcite )",
    ". it should be noted , however , that our approach is not to attempt to embed a relativistic symmetry group in a higher - dimensional unitary group , but rather to embed the unitary group in a higher - dimensional relativistic symmetry group .",
    "our methodology is consistent with the point of view put forward by penrose that for a coherent unification of general relativity and quantum mechanics , the rules of quantum theory must undergo ` profound modification '  @xcite .",
    "the compactified complexified quantum space - time @xmath514 can be regarded as the aggregate of projective @xmath515-planes in @xmath512 .",
    "now generically a @xmath516 in @xmath512 will not intersect the segr variety @xmath517 such a generic @xmath515-plane corresponds to a generic point in @xmath518 .",
    "the @xmath515-planes that correspond to the points of compactified complexified minkowski space can be constructed as follows . for each line @xmath519 in @xmath520",
    "we consider the subvariety @xmath521 where @xmath522 .",
    "for any algebraic variety @xmath523 @xmath524 we define the _ span _ of @xmath525 to be the projective plane spanned by the points of @xmath525 .",
    "we say a point @xmath526 in the ambient space @xmath527 lies in the span of the variety @xmath525 if and only if there exist @xmath236 points in @xmath525 for some @xmath528 with the property that @xmath526 lies in the @xmath529-plane spanned by those @xmath236 points .",
    "the dimension @xmath154 of the span of @xmath525 satisfies @xmath530 ; however , the value of @xmath154 depends on the geometry of @xmath525 .    the linear span of the points in @xmath531 , for any given @xmath519 , is a @xmath515-plane .",
    "this is the @xmath532 in @xmath512 that represents the point in @xmath533 corresponding to the line @xmath519 in @xmath310 .",
    "the aggregate of such special @xmath515-planes , defined by their intersection properties with the segr variety @xmath534 , constitutes a submanifold of @xmath514 , and this submanifold is compactified complexified minkowski space @xmath535 .",
    "thus we see that once the symmetry of quantum space - time @xmath536 has been broken in the particular way we have discussed , then ordinary minkowski space can be identified as a submanifold .",
    "let us now consider the implications of our symmetry breaking mechanism for fields defined on quantum space - time .",
    "as an example , let @xmath537 be a scalar field on quantum space - time .",
    "after we break the symmetry by writing @xmath538 , we consider a taylor expansion of the field around the embedded minkowski space - time .",
    "specifically , for such an expansion we have @xmath539 where @xmath540 and @xmath541 therefore , the order zero term has the character of a classical field on minkowski space , and the first order term can be interpreted as a ` multiplet ' of fields , transforming according to the adjoint representation of the internal symmetry group @xmath542 .",
    "_ symmetry breaking and matter formation in a hypertwistorial quantum cosmology_. in its earliest stages the universe is highly symmetrical .",
    "eventually , symmetry is broken , and a four - dimensional ` classical ' cosmology freezes out , becoming largely disentangled from the reminder of the quantum space - time .",
    "the formation of matter during the disentanglement process may not be confined to the four - dimensional subspace .",
    "if such a scenario prevails , the bulk of this ` dark material ' is likely to remain outside the four - dimensional subspace , though nevertheless having an impact on its dynamics . ]    in this connection we note that the symmetry breaking mechanism that we have proposed here has yet another representation  namely , the expression of a hypertwistor as a multi - twistor system , i.e. as a multiplet of penrose twistors .",
    "the physical and geometrical characteristics of such @xmath490-twistor systems have been analysed at great length by a number of authors ( see , e.g. , @xcite and references cited therein ) , and it is interesting therefore to see the direct link with hypertwistor theory and quantum space - time geometry .",
    "it is fitting also to make a tribute here to the work of zoltan perjs , whose extensive contributions to relativity theory include , in particular , a number of important studies concerning the properties of @xmath490-twistor systems and their symmetries  @xcite .",
    "it is tempting to speculate that even in a more dynamic context some version of the symmetry breaking mechanism provided here will manifest itself . in this picture",
    "we would envisage the earliest stages of the universe as being highly symmetrical , rather in the spirit of penrose s weyl curvature hypothesis  @xcite , with no appreciable distinction between the conventional space - time degrees of freedom and the internal degrees of freedom associated with quantum theory .",
    "nevertheless , the causal geometry of the universe remains well defined , and it is interesting to ask whether there might be some scenario within the rather rich causal structure of a quantum space - time that would allow us to account for the so - called ` horizon problem ' . in any event , once symmetry breaking takes place  and this may happen in stages , corresponding to a successive factorisation of the underlying hypertwistor space  then it makes sense to think of ordinary four - dimensional space - time as becoming more or less disentangled from the rest of the universe , and behaving in a way that is to some extent autonomous .",
    "nonetheless , we might reasonably expect its global dynamics , on a cosmological scale , to be affected by the distribution of mass and energy elsewhere in the quantum space - time as well ( see , e.g. , figure  [ fig:12 ] ) .",
    "the embedding of minkowski space in the quantum space - time @xmath505 given by ( [ eq:11.4 ] ) implies a corresponding embedding of the poincar group in the hyper - poincar group .",
    "this can be seen as follows .",
    "the standard poincar group in @xmath543 consists of transformations of the form @xmath544 and the hyper - poincar transformations in @xmath505 are of the form @xmath545 with the identification @xmath546 , the general hyper - poincar transformation in the broken symmetry phase can be expressed in the form @xmath547 thus the embedding of the poincar group as a subgroup of the hyper - poincar group is given by @xmath548    bearing this in mind , we now construct a class of maps from the general even - dimensional quantum space - time @xmath505 to minkowski space @xmath543 .",
    "it turns out  @xcite that under rather general physical assumptions such maps are necessarily of the form @xmath549 where @xmath550 is a density matrix . as usual , by a density matrix we mean a positive semi - definite hermitian matrix with unit trace .",
    "thus the maps arising here can be regarded as quantum expectations .    in particular ,",
    "let @xmath551 satisfy the following conditions : ( i ) @xmath552 is linear and maps the origin of @xmath505 to the origin of @xmath543 ; ( ii ) @xmath552 is poincar invariant ; and ( iii ) @xmath552 preserves causal relations",
    ". then @xmath552 is given by a density matrix on the internal space .",
    "[ theo:2 ]    the general linear map from @xmath505 to @xmath553 preserving the origin is given by @xmath554 where @xmath555 is weakly hermitian .",
    "now suppose that we subject @xmath505 to a poincar transformation of the form ( [ eq:12.2 ] ) , and require the corresponding transformation of @xmath556 should be of the form ( [ eq:12.1 ] ) .",
    "if @xmath552 satisfies these conditions then we shall say that the map @xmath552 is poincar invariant .",
    "clearly , poincar invariance holds if and only if @xmath557 for all @xmath558 , for all @xmath559 , and for all @xmath560 .",

    "equation ( [ eq:12.8 ] ) implies that @xmath552 is of the form @xmath565 for some @xmath550 .",
    "then ( [ eq:12.9 ] ) implies that @xmath552 must satisfy the trace condition @xmath566 .",
    "finally we require that if @xmath567 and @xmath568 are quantum space - time points with the property that the interval @xmath569 is future - pointing then @xmath570 is also future pointing , where @xmath571 this is the requirement that @xmath552 should be a ` causal ' map .",
    "this condition implies that @xmath552 must be positive semi - definite .",
    "in particular , if @xmath572 is future - pointing then it must be of the form @xmath573 consider therefore the case for which @xmath574 is null .",
    "then we require that the expression @xmath575 should be future - pointing ( or vanish ) for any choice of @xmath8 .",
    "in particular , we require that the vector @xmath576 should be future - pointing if @xmath8 is of the form @xmath577 for any choice of @xmath192 and @xmath494 .",
    "this means that the inequality @xmath578 holds for all @xmath494 , which shows that @xmath550 is positive semi - definite .",
    "since we have shown that the trace of @xmath550 is unity , it follows that @xmath550 is a density matrix .",
    "this result shows how the causal structure of quantum space - time is linked with the probabilistic structure of quantum mechanics .",
    "the concept of a quantum state emerges when we ask for consistent ways of ` averaging ' over the geometry of quantum space - time in order to obtain a reduced description of physical phenomena in terms of the geometry of minkowski space .",
    "we see that a probabilistic interpretation of the map from a general quantum space - time to minkowski space arises as a consequence of elementary causality requirements .",
