    "the astrophysical data from distant ia supernovae observations @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , cosmic microwave background anisotropy @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and large scale galaxy surveys @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , all indicate that the current universe is not only expanding , it is accelerating due to some kind of negative - pressure form of matter known as dark energy ( @xcite , @xcite,@xcite,@xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the combined analysis of cosmological observations also suggests that the universe is spatially flat , and consists of about @xmath0 of dark matter ( the known baryonic and nonbaryonic dark matter ) , distributed in clustered structures ( galaxies , clusters of galaxies , etc . ) and @xmath1 of homogeneously distributed ( unclustered ) dark energy with negative pressure . despite the high percentage of the dark energy component , its nature as well as its cosmological origin remain unknown at present and a wide variety of models have been proposed to explain the nature of the dark energy and the accelerated expansion ( see @xcite-@xcite for review ) . among the different models of dark energy ,",
    "the holographic dark energy approach is quite interesting as it incorporates some concepts of the quantum gravity known as the holographic principle ( @xcite),which first appeared in the context of black holes @xcite and later extended by susskind @xcite to string theory .",
    "according to the holographic principle , the entropy of a system scales not with its volume , but with its surface area . in the cosmological context , the holographic principle will set an upper bound on the entropy of the universe @xcite . in the work @xcite",
    ", it was suggested that in quantum field theory a short distance cut - off @xmath2 is related to a long distance cut - off ( infra - red cut - off @xmath3 ) due to the limit set by black hole formation , namely , if is the quantum zero - point energy density caused by a short distance ( uv ) cut - off , the total energy in a region of size @xmath3 should not exceed the mass of a black hole of the same size , thus @xmath4 .",
    "applied to the dark energy issue , if we take the whole universe into account , then the vacuum energy related to this holographic principle is viewed as dark energy , usually called holographic dark energy @xcite @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the largest @xmath3 allowed is the one saturating this inequality so that the holographic dark energy density is defined by the equality @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is a numerical constant and @xmath7 .",
    "+ as is well known , the hubble horizon @xmath8 as the infrared cut - off , gives an equation of state parameter ( eos ) equal to zero , behaving as pressureless matter which can not give accelerated expansion , and the particle horizon gives an eos parameter larger than @xmath9 , which is not enough to satisfy the current observational data .",
    "the infrared cut - off given by the future event horizon yields the desired result of accelerated expansion with an eos parameter less than @xmath9 , despite the fact that it is based on non local quantities and has problems with the causality @xcite .",
    "an holographic dark energy model which is based on local and non local quantities have been considered in @xcite , @xcite .",
    "based mainly on dimensional arguments , in @xcite , @xcite an infrared cut - off for the holographic density was proposed , which describes the dark energy in good agreement with the astrophysical data , and may explain the cosmic coincidence .",
    "this model exhibits quintom nature ( for some values of the parameters ) without the need to introduce any exotic matter , and has also proven to be useful in the reconstruction of different scalar field models of dark energy which reproduce the late time cosmological dynamics in a way consistent with the observations @xcite .",
    "+ despite the available proposals , the theoretical root of the holographic dark energy is still unknown mostly because our ignorance about the microscopic nature of quantum gravity and the origin of dark energy .",
    "this translates into a lack of details about the holographic cut - off , and therefore in the present paper we assume that this cut - off should be encoded in a function that depends on natural cosmological quantities like the hubble parameter , its time derivative and also should contain a constant term , which represents the first approximation to vacuum energy density ( which could be interpreted , in the context of the holographic principle as giving quantum gravity nature to the cosmological constant ) .",
    "the constant term would act as the first natural approximation to the infrared cut - off for the holographic density , since this term may be identified with a constant vacuum energy density , that adjusts very well to the current observational data .",
    "a discussion about the cosmological constant and the holographic principle is given in @xcite .",
    "we propose an holographic density given by a general function of the form @xmath10 , where @xmath11 should be expanded in powers of his arguments , based on their smallness ( compared to the squared planck mass @xmath12 ) .",
    "the coefficients of the different terms of this expansion must be found by fitting the model with current observations . to obtain the cosmological constraints on the model",
    ", we will use the snia constitution sample ( @xcite ) , complemented with the cmb ( cosmic micro wave background ) anisotropy and bao ( baryon acoustic oscillation ) data . in section 2",
    "we review the main aspects of the model , in section 3 we include the matter content and fit the parameters using the joint constitution , cmb and bao data analysis . in section 4",
    "we give a discussion .",
    "the main inequality discussed above @xmath13 , leads to the restriction involving the uv and ir cut - offs @xmath14 . saturating this inequality we come to the concept of holographic dark energy @xmath15 . to define the infrared cut - off and hence the holographic dark energy density , we propose for @xmath16 a general function which should depend on the main cosmological parameters @xmath17 and @xmath18 , and",
    "is measured in units of @xmath19 , defining the holographic density as follows ( from now on we will set @xmath20 ) @xmath21 setting @xmath22 , we can rewrite ( [ eq5 ] ) as follows @xmath23 introducing the scaled hubble expansion rate @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the present value of the hubble parameter ( for @xmath26 ) , the above friedman equation becomes @xmath27 where @xmath28 solving the equation ( [ eq7 ] ) , we obtain @xmath29 where @xmath30 , @xmath31 is an integration constant and the last equality is written in the redshift variable ( by using @xmath32 ) .",
    "note that even without the matter component , this solution is interesting enough as it contains the cosmological constant , and the second term may give matter - like behavior if the constants @xmath33 and @xmath34 satisfy the restriction @xmath35 , giving rise to the @xmath2cdm model .",
    "evaluating the eq .",
    "( [ eq8 ] ) at @xmath26 ( the flatness condition ) , it follows [ eq9 ] _",
    "thus @xmath36 represents the constant component of vacuum energy density and @xmath31 stands for the new form of `` matter '' , both quantities coming from the holographic principle .",
    "additional constraints may be used to find appropriate values for the parameters .",
    "these constraints are related with the present observational value of the dark energy eos , which between the margins of errors can be set to @xmath37 , and the transition deceleration - acceleration , which occurs in the region @xmath38",
    "( @xmath39 is the transition redshift ) .",
    "the eos in terms of the redshift is given by [ eq10 ] ( z)=-1 + replacing @xmath40 from ( [ eq8 ] ) it follows that [ eq11 ] ( z)=-1- from eq .",
    "( [ eq8 ] ) the deceleration parameter @xmath41 , is given by [ eq12 ] q(z)=-1- note that the hubble parameter ( [ eq8 ] ) and the eqs .",
    "( [ eq11 ] ) and ( [ eq12 ] ) depend on @xmath33 and @xmath34 only through the combination @xmath42 .",
    "therefore , for a given @xmath43 and @xmath44 , we can find the combination @xmath42 and @xmath36 .",
    "note also that @xmath45 gives @xmath46 , as expected from a universe dominated by the cosmological constant .",
    "it is worth examining the special case of @xmath47 . integrating the eq .",
    "( [ eq7 ] ) for @xmath47 , and using ( [ eq10 ] ) to the define the corresponding eos , gives [ eq12a ] ( z)=-1 + , where @xmath48 is the integration constant . at @xmath49",
    "gives @xmath50 .",
    "thus depending on the relative sign of @xmath34 and @xmath48 , we can have quintessence or phantom behavior",
    ". an interesting limit of eq .",
    "( [ eq7 ] ) can be obtained when @xmath51 , which is equivalent to one of the slow - roll conditions used in inflationary models . in this limit @xmath52 , which gives rise to exponential expansion ( @xmath53 ) .",
    "in order to construct a more realistic scenario , we include the contribution of matter , and by using the observational data we can define the parameters of the model .",
    "adding the contribution of matter , the friedmann equation becomes [ eq13 ] h^2=_m0 e^-3x++h^2 + , with the solution given by ( in terms of the scaled hubble parameter ) [ eq14 ] ^2=_m0 e^-3x+_+e^-2x(-1)/+ e^-3x where @xmath54 , @xmath31 is the integration constant and the last three terms represent the contribution of the holographic dark energy .",
    "the third term provides the possibility of crossing the phantom barrier , giving rise to quintom behavior .",
    "note that the last term in ( [ eq14 ] ) makes contribution to the matter sector , which indicates that the present holographic density also contributes to the presureless matter component of the universe , which is about 27% of the total . in what follows",
    "we will consider the sum of the terms proportional to @xmath55 as the matter component ( in fact is an effective matter component ) and the eq .",

    "( [ eq15 ] ) , and the third term may be responsible for possible quintom behavior . the coefficients in eq .",
    "( [ eq15 ] ) are subject to the flatness condition ( at @xmath26 ) [ eq17 ] _m0+_+=1 it is important to note here that the net contribution to the present density parameter of the dark energy comes from the sum of the last two terms in eq .",
    "( [ eq17 ] ) , which we can resume as [ eq18 ] _ de=_+so that the meaning of each separate term in ( [ eq18 ] ) is not important , but what matters is their sum which should contribute about 73% to the total balance in ( [ eq17 ] ) .",
    "note also that as in the previous case of de dominance , @xmath33 and @xmath34 appear in the combination @xmath42 in ( [ eq15 ] ) , and hence we can define the parameter @xmath57 .",
    "this effectively reduce the number of the free parameters of the model to three , as can be seen from ( [ eq15 ] ) by using the above replacement for @xmath33 and @xmath34 and the flatness condition ( [ eq17 ] ) . at the same time this simplifies the procedure of fitting the parameters with the current observational data . in terms of the redshift",

    "in this work we propose a new model of holographic density which incorporates a constant term as the first approximation to the infrared ( ir ) cut - off , and has notorious advantages with respect to the previous models , as it contains the @xmath2cdm model and additional de term which could play an important role in the late time dynamics of the universe .",
    "the cosmological constant in the context of the holographic principle have been discussed in @xcite ( where using thermodynamical arguments it was showed that the most probable value of the cosmological constant is zero , but a very small cosmological constant is still allowed ) , and the presence of a constant term in the holographic density brings a quantum gravity nature to the cosmological constant . moreover",
    ", the current astrophysical data indicates that the constant cosmological constant adjusts very well to the observations , and this fact supports the presence of constant term in the holographic density . adding this constant term to the ir cut - off",
    "may improve even models like the hubble scale which was unable to produce accelerated expansion @xcite , @xcite . in this case if we add a constant term to the squared hubble scale , we obtain the @xmath2cdm model . in order to reduce the number of free parameters , we grouped the terms proportional to @xmath55 in an effective matter density parameter , and the dependence on the initial model parameters @xmath33 and @xmath34 reduces to dependence on the combination @xmath57 . by using the astrophysical data we can fix @xmath60 , and",
    "this means that one of the parameters @xmath33 or @xmath34 still free . if for instance we let @xmath34 free , then the relevant cosmological parameters which dictate the dynamical evolution of the universe do not depend on @xmath34 , and there is apparently not dynamical criteria to fix @xmath34 . to fix @xmath34 we can use geometrical criteria in order to convert the last two terms in ( [ eq5 ] ) in a term proportional to the ricci scalar . in this case",
    "the constant @xmath34 is automatically defined . from the relation",
    "@xmath91 , if we set @xmath92 then the last two terms in ( [ eq5 ] ) become @xmath93 . +",
    "we have also shown that the holographic density contributes to the matter density defining in this way the `` effective '' matter density containing the usual baryonic and dark matter ( see ( [ eq14]-[eq16 ] ) ) .",
    "we can interpret this result as meaning that the present holographic density may account for the dark matter content , and in this sense previously considered models of holographic de based on local quantities @xmath94 and @xmath18 can give rise only to constant de eos parameter .",
    "the model parameters ( @xmath95 ) were constrained using the observational data including the constitution sample of snia , the cmb shift parameter given by wmap5 , and bao measurement from sdss .",

    "@xmath98 . a detailed study of the available data to constraint the parameters will be done elsewhere .",
    "+ resuming , the present model could be relevant because of its simplicity ; it introduces a `` constant '' cosmological term in the infrared cut - off of the holographic density , which puts the cosmological constant in the context of the holographic principle , attributing quantum gravity nature to the cosmological constant ; it improves previously considered holographic models of de based on local quantities ; it may reproduce the standard @xmath2cdm model even without explicitly giving matter content ( see ( [ eq8 ] ) at @xmath35 ) .",
