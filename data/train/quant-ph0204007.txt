    "this paper concentrates on relationships of formal systems with biology . in particular , this is a study of different forms and formalisms for replication .    in living systems",
    "there is an essential circularity that is the living structure .",
    "living systems produce themselves from themselves and the materials and energy of the environment .",
    "there is a strong contrast in how we avoid circularity in mathematics and how nature revels in biological circularity .",
    "one meeting point of biology and mathematics is knot theory and topology .",
    "this is no accident , since topology is indeed a controlled study of cycles and circularities in primarily geometrical systems .    in this paper",
    "we will discuss dna replication , logic and biology , the relationship of symbol and object , the emergence of form .",
    "it is in the replication of dna that the polarity ( yes / no , on / off , true / false ) of logic and the continuity of topology meet . here",
    "polarities are literally fleshed out into the forms of life .",
    "we shall pay attention to the different contexts for the logical , from the mathematical to the biological to the quantum logical . in each case",
    "there is a shift in the role of certain key concepts . in particular , we follow the notion of copying through these contexts and with it gain new insight into the role of replication in biology , in formal systems and in the quantum level ( where it does not exist ! ) .    in the end",
    "we arrive at a summary formalism , a chapter in _ boundary mathematics _",
    "( mathematics using directly the concept and notation of containers and delimiters of forms - compare @xcite and @xcite ) where there are not only containers @xmath0 , but also extainers @xmath1  entities open to interaction and distinguishing the space that they are not . in this formalism",
    "we find a key for the articulation of diverse relationships .",
    "boundary algebra of containers and extainers _ is to biologic what boolean algebra is to classical logic .",
    "let @xmath2 and @xmath3 then @xmath4 and @xmath5 thus an extainer produces a container when it interacts with itself , and a container produces an extainer when it interacts with itself .    the formalism of containers and extainers is a chapter in the foundations of a symbolic language for shape and interaction . with it",
    ", we can express the _ form _ of dna replication succinctly as follows : let the dna itself be represented as a container    @xmath6    we regard the two brackets of the container as representatives for the two matched dna strands .",
    "we let the extainer @xmath3 represent the cellular environment with its supply of available base pairs ( here symbolized by the individual left and right brackets ) .",
    "then when the dna strands separate , they encounter the matching bases from the environment and become two dna s .",
    "@xmath7    life itself is about systems that search and learn and become .",
    "perhaps a little symbol like @xmath8 with the property that @xmath9 produces containers @xmath0 and retains its own integrity in conjunction with the autonomy of @xmath0 ( the dna ) could be a step toward bringing formalism to life .",

    "we start this essay with the question : during the replication of dna , how do the daughter dna duplexes avoid entanglement ? in the words of john hearst @xcite , we are in search of the mechanism for the  emaculate segregation \"",
    ". this question is inevitably involved with the topology of the dna , for the strands of the dna are interwound with one full turn for every ten base pairs . with the strands",
    "so interlinked it would seem impossible for the daughter strands to separate from their parents .",
    "a key to this problem certainly lies in the existence of the topoisomerase enzymes that can change the linking number between the dna strands and also can change the linking number between two dna duplexes .",
    "it is however , a difficult matter at best to find in a tangled skein of rope the just right crossing changes that will unknot or unlink it .",
    "the topoisomerase enzymes do just this , changing crossings by grabbing a strand , breaking it and then rejoining it after the other strand has slipped through the break .",
    "random strand switching is an unlikely mechanism , and one is led to posit some intrinsic geometry that can promote the process . in @xcite",
    "there is made a specific suggestion about this intrinsic geometry .",
    "it is suggested that in vivo the dna polymerase enzyme that promotes replication ( by creating loops of single stranded dna by opening the double stranded dna ) has sufficient rigidity not to allow the new loops to swivel and become entangled . in other words , it is posited that the replication loops remain simple in their topology so that the topoisomerase can act to promote the formation of the replication loops , and these loops once formed do not hinder the separation of the newly born duplexes .",
    "the model has been to some degree confirmed @xcite .",
    "the situation would now appear to be that in the first stages of the formation of the replication loops topoi acts favorably to allow their formation and amalgamation .",
    "then topoii has a smaller job of finishing the separation of the newly formed duplexes . in figure 1",
    "we illustrate the schema of this process . in this figure",
    "we indicate the action of the topoi by showing a strand being switched in between two replication loops .",
    "the action of topo ii is only stated but not shown . in that action , newly created but entangled dna strands would be disentangled .",
    "our hypothesis is that this second action is essentially minimized by the rigidity of the ends of the replication loops in vivo .",
    "@xmath10    * figure 1 - dna replication *    in the course of this research , we started thinking about the diagrammatic logic of dna replication and more generally about the relationship between dna replication , logic and basic issues in the foundations of mathematics and modeling .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to explain some of these issues , raise questions and place these questions in the most general context that we can muster at this time .",
    "the purpose of this paper is therefore foundational .",
    "it will not in its present form affect issues in practical biology , but we hope that it will enable us and the reader to ask fruitful questions and perhaps bring the art of modeling in mathematics and biology forward .",
    "to this end we have called the subject matter of this paper  biologic \" with the intent that this might suggest a quest for the logic of biological systems or a quest for a  biological logic \" or even the question of the relationship between what we call  logic \" and our own biology .",
    "we have been trained to think of physics as the foundation of biology , but it is possible to realize that indeed biology can also be regarded as a foundation for thought , language , mathematics and even physics . in order to bring this statement over to physics one has to learn to admit that physical measurements are performed by biological organisms either directly or indirectly and that it is through our biological structure that we come to know the world .",
    "this foundational view will be elaborated as we proceed in this paper .",
    "in logic it is implicit at the syntactical level that copies of signs are freely available . in abstract logic there is no issue about materials available for the production of copies of a sign , nor is there necessarily a formalization of how a sign is to be copied . in the practical realm",
    "there are limitations to resources .",
    "a mathematician may need to replenish his supply of paper .",
    "a computer has a limitation on its memory store . in biology , there are no signs , but there are entities that we take as signs in our description of the workings of the biological information process . in this category the bases that line the backbone of the dna are signs whose significance lies in their relative placement in the dna . the dna itself could be viewed as a text that one would like to copy . if this were a simple formal system it would be taken for granted that copies of any given text can be made .",
    "therefore it is worthwhile making a comparison of the methods of copying or reproduction that occur in logic and in biology .    in logic",
    "there is a level beyond the simple copying of symbols that contains a non - trivial description of self - replication .",
    "the schema is as follows : there is a universal building machine @xmath11 that can accept a text or description @xmath12 ( the program ) and build what the text describes .",
    "we let lowercase @xmath12 denote the description and uppercase @xmath13 denote that which is described . thus @xmath11 with @xmath12 will build @xmath14 in fact , for bookkeeping purposes we also produce an extra copy of the text @xmath15 this is appended to the production @xmath13 as @xmath16 thus @xmath11 , when supplied with a description @xmath17 produces that which @xmath12 describes , with a copy of its description attached .",
    "schematically we have the process shown below .",
    "@xmath18    self - replication is an immediate consequence of this concept of a universal building machine .",
    "let @xmath19 denote the text or program for the universal building machine .",
    "apply @xmath11 to its own description .",
    "@xmath20    the universal building machine reproduces itself .",
    "each copy is a universal building machine with its own description appended .",
    "each copy will proceed to reproduce itself in an unending tree of duplications . in practice",
    "this duplication will continue until all available resources are used up , or until someone removes the programs or energy sources from the proliferating machines .",
    "it is not necessary to go all the way to a universal building machine to establish replication in a formal system or a cellular automaton ( see the epilogue to this paper for examples . ) . on the other hand ,",
    "all these logical devices for replication are based on the hardware / software or object / symbol distinction .",
    "it is worth looking at the abstract form of dna replication .",
    "dna consists in two strands of base - pairs wound helically around a phosphate backbone .",
    "it is customary to call one of these strands the  watson \" strand and the other the  crick \" strand .",
    "abstractly we can write @xmath21 to symbolize the binding of the two strands into the single dna duplex .",
    "replication occurs via the separation of the two strands via polymerase enzyme .",
    "this separation occurs locally and propagates .",
    "local sectors of separation can amalgamate into larger pieces of separation as well .",
    "once the strands are separated , the environment of the cell can provide each with complementary bases to form the base pairs of new duplex dna s .",
    "each strand , separated in vivo , finds its complement being built naturally in the environment .",
    "this picture ignores the well - known topological difficulties present to the actual separation of the daughter strands .",
    "the base pairs are @xmath22 ( adenine and thymine ) and @xmath23 ( guanine and cytosine ) . thus if    @xmath24 then @xmath25    symbolically we can oversimplify the whole process as    @xmath26    @xmath27    @xmath28    either half of the dna can , with the help of the environment , become a full dna .",
    "we can let @xmath29 be a symbol for the process by which the environment supplies the complementary base pairs @xmath30 , @xmath31 to the watson and crick strands .",
    "in this oversimplification we have cartooned the environment as though it contained an already - waiting strand @xmath32 to pair with @xmath33 and an already - waiting strand @xmath33 to pair with @xmath34    _ in fact it is the opened strands themselves that command the appearance of their mates .",
    "they conjure up their mates from the chemical soup of the environment .",
    "_    the environment @xmath35 is an identity element in this algebra of cellular interaction .",
    "that is , @xmath35 is always in the background and can be allowed to appear spontaneously in the cleft between watson and crick :    @xmath36    @xmath37    this is the formalism of dna replication .",
    "compare this method of replication with the movements of the universal building machine supplied with its own blueprint . here",
    "watson and crick ( @xmath33 and @xmath32 ) are each both the machine _ and _ the blueprint for the dna .",
    "they are complementary blueprints , each containing the information to reconstitute the whole molecule .",
    "they are each machines in the context of the cellular environment , enabling the production of the dna .",
    "this coincidence of machine and blueprint , hardware and software is an important difference between classical logical systems and the logical forms that arise in biology .",
    "one can look at formal systems involving self - replication that do not make a distinction between symbol and object . in the case of formal systems",
    "this means that one is working entirely on the symbolic side , quite a different matter from the biology where there is no intrinsic symbolism , only our external descriptions of processes in such terms .",
    "an example at the symbolic level is provided by the lambda calculus of church and curry @xcite where functions are allowed to take themselves as arguments .",
    "this is accomplished by the following axiom .",
    "* axiom for a lambda algebra * : let @xmath38 be an algebraic system with one binary operation denoted @xmath39 for elements @xmath40 and @xmath19 of @xmath41 let @xmath42 be an algebraic expression over @xmath38 with one variable @xmath15 then there exists an element @xmath40 of @xmath38 such that @xmath43 for all @xmath12 in @xmath41    an algebra ( not associative ) that satisfies this axiom is a representation of the lambda calculus of church and curry .",
    "let @xmath19 be an element of @xmath38 and define @xmath44 then by the axiom we have @xmath40 in @xmath38 such that @xmath45 for any @xmath12 in @xmath41 in particular ( and this is where the  function \" becomes its own argument ) @xmath46 thus we have shown that for any @xmath19 in @xmath38 , there exists an element @xmath12 in @xmath38 such that @xmath47 every element of @xmath38 has a  fixed point . \"",
    "this conclusion has two effects .",
    "it provides a fixed point for the function @xmath48 and it creates the beginning of a recursion in the form    @xmath49    the way we arrived at the fixed point @xmath50 was formally the same as the mechanism of the universal building machine .",
    "consider that machine :    @xmath51    we have left out the repetition of the machine itself .",
    "you could look at this as a machine that uses itself up in the process of building @xmath14 applying @xmath11 to its own description @xmath19 we have the self - replication    @xmath52    the repetition of @xmath12 in the form @xmath53 on the right hand side of this definition of the builder property is comparable with    @xmath54    with its crucial repetition as well . in the fixed point theorem ,",
    "the arrow is replaced by an equals sign !",
    "repetition is the core of self - replication in classical logic .",
    "_ this use of repetition assumes the possibility of a copy at the syntactic level , in order to produce a copy at the symbolic level .",
    "_ there is , in this pivot on syntax , a deep relationship with other fundamental issues in logic . in particular this same form of repetition",
    "is in back of the cantor diagonal argument showing that the set of subsets of a set has greater cardinality than the original set , and it is in back of the g@xmath55del theorem on the incompleteness of sufficiently rich formal systems .",
    "the pattern is also in back of the production of paradoxes such as the russell paradox of the set of all sets that are not members of themselves .",
    "there is not space here to go into all these relationships , but the russell paradox will give a hint of the structure . let ",
    "ab \" be interpreted as ",
    "b is a member of a \"",
    ". then @xmath56 can be taken as the definition of a set @xmath57 such that @xmath13 is a member of @xmath57 exactly when it is _ not _ the case that @xmath13 is a member of @xmath14 note the repetition of @xmath13 in the definition @xmath58 substituting @xmath57 for @xmath13 we obtain @xmath59 , which says that @xmath57 is a member of @xmath57 exactly when it is not the case that @xmath57 is a member of @xmath60 this is the russell paradox . from the point of view of the lambda calculus ,",
    "we have found a fixed point for negation .    where is the repetition in the dna self - replication ?",
    "the repetition and the replication are no longer separated .",
    "the repetition occurs not syntactically , but directly at the point of replication .",
    "note the device of pairing or mirror imaging .",
    "@xmath38 calls up the appearance of @xmath61 and @xmath62 calls up the appearance of @xmath63 @xmath33 calls up the appearance of @xmath32 and @xmath32 calls up the appearance of @xmath64 each object @xmath65 calls up the appearance of its _ dual or paired object _ @xmath66 .",

    "@xmath68 replicates via    @xmath69    @xmath70    whence    @xmath71    the repetition is inherent in the replicand in the sense that the dual of a form is a repetition of that form .",
    "we now consider the quantum level . here",
    "copying is not possible .",
    "we shall detail this in a subsection . for a quantum process to copy a state",
    ", one needs a unitary transformation to perform the job .",
    "one can show , as we explain in the last subsection of this section , that this can not be done .",
    "there are indirect ways that seem to make a copy , involving a classical communication channel coupled with quantum operators ( so called quantum teleportation @xcite ) .",
    "the production of such a quantum state constitutes a reproduction of the original state , but in these cases the original state is lost , so teleportation looks more like transportation than copying . with this in mind",
    "it is fascinating to contemplate that dna and other molecular configurations are actually modeled in principle as certain complex quantum states . at this stage",
    "we meet the boundary between classical and quantum mechanics where conventional wisdom finds it is most useful to regard the main level of molecular biology as classical .",
    "we shall quickly indicate the basic principles of quantum mechanics .",
    "the quantum information context encapsulates a concise model of quantum theory :    _ the initial state of a quantum process is a vector @xmath72 in a complex vector space @xmath73 observation returns basis elements @xmath74 of @xmath75 with probability _    @xmath76    where @xmath77 with @xmath78 the conjugate transpose of @xmath79 a physical process occurs in steps @xmath80 where @xmath81 is a unitary linear transformation .",
    "note that since @xmath82 when @xmath81 is unitary , it follows that probability is preserved in the course of a quantum process .",
    "one of the details for any specific quantum problem is the nature of the unitary evolution .",
    "this is specified by knowing appropriate information about the classical physics that supports the phenomena .",
    "this information is used to choose an appropriate hamiltonian through which the unitary operator is constructed via a correspondence principle that replaces classical variables with appropriate quantum operators .",
    "( in the path integral approach one needs a langrangian to construct the action on which the path integral is based . ) one needs to know certain aspects of classical physics to solve any given quantum problem .",
    "the classical world is known through our biology . in this sense biology",
    "is the foundation for physics .",
    "a key concept in the quantum information viewpoint is the notion of the superposition of states . if a quantum system has two distinct states @xmath72 and @xmath83 then it has infinitely many states of the form @xmath84 where @xmath40 and @xmath19 are complex numbers taken up to a common multiple .",
    "states are  really \" in the projective space associated with @xmath73 there is only one superposition of a single state @xmath72 with itself .",
    "dirac @xcite introduced the  bra -(c)-ket \" notation @xmath85 for the inner product of complex vectors @xmath86 .",
    "he also separated the parts of the bracket into the _ bra _ @xmath87 and the _ ket _ @xmath88 thus    @xmath89    in this interpretation , the ket @xmath90 is identified with the vector @xmath91 , while the bra @xmath87 is regarded as the element dual to @xmath38 in the dual space @xmath92 .",
    "the dual element to @xmath38 corresponds to the conjugate transpose @xmath93 of the vector @xmath38 , and the inner product is expressed in conventional language by the matrix product @xmath94 ( which is a scalar since @xmath11 is a column vector ) .",
    "having separated the bra and the ket , dirac can write the  ket - bra \" @xmath95 in conventional notation , the ket - bra is a matrix , not a scalar , and we have the following formula for the square of @xmath96    @xmath97    written entirely in dirac notation we have    @xmath98    @xmath99    the standard example is a ket - bra @xmath100 where @xmath101 so that @xmath102 then @xmath103 is a projection matrix , projecting to the subspace of @xmath75 that is spanned by the vector @xmath104 .",

    "there is nothing in the box except what is a consequence of its construction . with this in mind , let us look at some mathematical beginnings .",
    "take the beginning of set theory .",
    "we start with the empty set @xmath155 and we build new sets by the operation of set formation that takes any collection and puts brackets around it :    @xmath156    making a single entity @xmath157 from the multiplicity of the  parts \" that are so collected .",

    ", the empty set becomes unique and a hierarchy of distinct sets arises as if from nothing .",
    "@xmath158    all representatives of the different mathematical cardinalities arise out of the void in the presence of these conventions for collection and identification .",
    "we would like to get underneath the formal surface .",
    "we would like to see what makes this formal hierarchy tick .",
    "will there be an analogy to biology below this play of symbols ? on the one hand it is clear to us that there is actually no way to go below a given mathematical construction .",
    "anything that we call more fundamental will be another mathematical construct . nevertheless , the exercise is useful , for it asks us to look closely at how this given formality is made .",
    "it asks us to take seriously the parts that are usually taken for granted .",
    "we take for granted that the particular form of container used to represent the empty set is irrelevant to the empty set itself . but how can this be ? in order to have a concept of emptiness , one needs to hold the contrast of that which is empty with  everything else \" .",
    "one may object that these images are not part of the formal content of set theory .",
    "but they are part of the _ formalism _ of set theory .",
    "consider the representation of the empty set : @xmath159 that representation consists in a bracketing that we take to indicate an empty space within the brackets , and an injunction to ignore the complex typographical domains outside the brackets .",
    "focus on the brackets themselves .",
    "they come in two varieties : the left bracket , @xmath160 and the right bracket , @xmath161 the left bracket indicates a distinction of left and right with the emphasis on the right .",
    "the right bracket indicates a distinction between left and right with an emphasis on the left .",
    "a left and right bracket taken together become a _ container _ when each is in the domain indicated by the other .",
    "thus in the bracket symbol @xmath162 for the empty set , the left bracket , being to the left of the right bracket , is in the left domain that is marked by the right bracket , and the right bracket , being to the right of the left bracket is in the right domain that is marked by the left bracket .",

    "we shall forgo here details about the temperley lieb algebra itself , and refer the reader to @xcite where this point of view is used to create unitary representations of that algebra for the context of quantum computation . here",

    "the approach in this section derives from ideas in @xcite .",
    "here is another use for the formalism of bras and kets . consider a molecule that is obtained by  folding \" a long chain molecule .",

    "we do not assume any identities about moving containers or extainers , since the exact order of the sites along the chain is of great importance .",

    "note that each bra ket pair in a chain is decorated with a distinct letter .",

    "such a traverse can go along the chain or skip across the bonds joining the paired sites .",

    "consequently , that folding , however it is embedded , must contain a knot by the conway - gordon theorem .",

    "molecules that are not bonded move about the lattice ( one lattice link at a time ) with a probability of motion . in the beginning",
    "there is a randomly placed soup of molecules with a high percentage of substrate and a smaller percentage of catalysts .",

    "@xmath265    * figure 5 - proto - cells of maturana , uribe and varela *    in the course of time the catalysts ( basically separate from one another due to lack of bonding ) become surrounded by circular forms of bonded or partially bonded substrate .",

    "the system is not programmed to make the proto - cells .",
    "_ they arise spontaneously in the evolution of the structure over time .",
    "one might imagine that in this way , organisms could be induced to arise as the evolutionary behavior of formal systems .",
    "there are difficulties , not the least of which is that there are nearly always structures in such systems whose probability of spontaneous emergence is vanishingly small .",
    "a good example is given by another automaton ",

    "the cells appear and disappear as marked squares in a rectangular planar grid .",

    "the life automaton is one of many automata of this type and indeed it is a fascinating exercise to vary the rules and watch a panoply of different behaviors . for this discussion",
    "we concentrate on some particular features .",
    "there is a configuration in life called a  glider \" .",
    "see figure 6 .",
    "this illustrates a  glider gun \" ( discussed below ) that produces a series of gliders going diagonally from left to right down the life lattice .",
    "the glider consists in five cells in one of two basic configurations .",
    "each of these configurations produces the other ( with a change in orientation ) . after four steps the glider reproduces itself in form , but",
    "shifted in space .",
    "gliders appear as moving entities in the temporality of the life board .",
    "the glider is a complex entity that arises naturally from a small random selection of marked cells on the life board .",
    "thus the glider is a  naturally occurring entity \" just like the proto - cell in the maturana - uribe - varela automaton .",
    "but life contains potentially much more complex phenomena .",
    "for example , there is the  glider gun \" ( see figure 6 ) which perpetually creates new gliders .",
    "the  gun \" was invented by a group of researchers at mit in the 1970 s ( the gosper group ) .",
    "it is highly unlikely that a gun would appear spontaneously in the life board .",
    "of course there is a tiny probability of this , but we would guess that the chances of the appearance of the glider gun by random selection or evolution from a random state is similar to the probability of all the air in the room collecting in one corner .",
    "nervertheless , the gun is a natural design based on forms and patterns that do appear spontaneously on small life boards .",
    "the glider gun emerged through the coupling of the power of human cognition and the automatic behavior of a mechanized formal system .",
    "cognition is in fact an attribute of our biological system at an appropriately high level of organization .",
    "but cognition itself looks as improbable as the glider gun !",
    "do patterns as complex as cognition or the glider gun arise spontaneously in an appropriate biological context ?",
    "@xmath266    * figure 6 - glider gun and gliders *    there is a middle ground . if one examines cellular automata of a given type and varies the rule set randomly rather than varying the initial conditions for a given automaton , then a very wide variety of phenomena will present themselves . in the case of molecular biology at the level of the dna there is exactly this possibility of varying the rules in the sense of varying the sequences in the genetic code .",
    "so it is possible at this level to produce a wide range of remarkable complex systems .",
    "other forms of self - replication are quite revealing . for example , one might point out that a stick can be made to reproduce by breaking it into two pieces",
    ". this may seem satisfactory on the first break , but the breaking can not be continued indefinitely . in mathematics on the other hand , we can divide an interval into two intervals and continue this process ad infinitum . for a self - replication to have meaning",
    "in the physical or biological realm there must be a genuine repetition of structure from original to copy . at",
    "the very least the interval should grow to twice its size before it divides ( or the parts should have the capacity to grow independently ) .",
    "a clever automaton , due to chris langton , takes the initial form of a square in the plane .",
    "the rectangle extrudes a edge that grows to one edge length and a little more , turns by ninety degrees , grows one edge length , turns by ninety degrees grows one edge length , turns by ninety degrees and when it grows enough to collide with the original extruded edge , cuts itself off to form a new adjacent square , thereby reproducing itself .",
    "this scenario is then repeated as often as possible producing a growing cellular lattice .",
    "see figure 7 .",
    "@xmath267    * figure 7 - langton s automaton *    the replications that happen in automata such as conway s life are all really instances of periodicity of a function under iteration .",
    "the gilder is an example where the life game function @xmath260 applied to an initial condition @xmath62 yields @xmath268 where @xmath269 is a rigid motion of the plane . other intriguing examples of this phenomenon occur .",
    "for example the initial condition @xmath270 for life shown in figure 8 has the property that @xmath271 where @xmath272 is a rigid motion of the plane and @xmath273 and the residue @xmath11 are disjoint sets of marked squares in the lattice of the game .",
    "@xmath270 itself is a small configuration of eight marked squares fitting into a rectangle of size @xmath274 by @xmath275 thus @xmath270 has a probability of @xmath276 of being chosen at random as eight points from @xmath277 points .",
    "@xmath278    * figure 8 - condition d with geometric period @xmath279 *    should we regard self - replication as simply an instance of periodicity under iteration ? perhaps , but the details are more interesting in a direct view .",
    "the glider gun in life is a structure @xmath280 such that @xmath281 further iterations move the disjoint glider away from the gun so that it can continue to operate as an initial condition for @xmath260 in the same way .",
    "a closer look shows that the glider is fundamentally composed of two parts @xmath103 and @xmath282 such that @xmath283 is a version of @xmath103 and some residue and such that @xmath284 where @xmath11 is a rectangular block , and @xmath285 is a mirror image of @xmath103 , while @xmath286 where @xmath287 is a small non - rectangular residue .",
    "see figure 9 for an illustration showing the parts @xmath103 and @xmath282 ( left and right ) flanked by small blocks that form the ends of the gun .",
    "one also finds that @xmath288 this is the internal mechanism by which the glider gun produces the glider . the extra blocks at either end of the glider gun act to absorb the residues that are produced by the iterations .",
    "thus the end blocks are catalysts that promote the action of the gun .",
    "schematically the glider production goes as follows :    @xmath289    @xmath290    whence    @xmath291    the last equality symbolizes the fact that the glider is an autonomous entity no longer involved in the structure of @xmath103 and @xmath292 it is interesting that @xmath282 is a spatially and time shifted version of @xmath293 thus @xmath103 and @xmath282 are really  copies \" of each other in an analogy to the structural relationship of the watson and crick strands of the dna .",
    "the remaining part of the analogy is the way the catalytic rectangles at the ends of the glider gun act to keep the residue productions from interfering with the production process .",
    "this is analogous to the enzyme action of the topoisomerase in the dna .",
    "@xmath294    * figure 9 - p(left ) and q(right ) compose the glider gun *    the point about this symbolic or symbiological analysis is that it enables us to take an analytical look at the structure of different replication scenarios for comparison and for insight .",

    "biological cognition comes from a domain where there is at base no distinction between syntax and semantics . to say that there is no distinction between syntax and semantics in biology is not to say that it is pure syntax .",

    "cognition gives rise to the distinction of syntax and semantics .",
    "cognition gives rise to the possibility of design , measurement , communication , language , physics and technology .    in this paper",
    "we have covered a wide ground of ideas related to the foundations of mathematics and its relationship with biology and with physics .",
    "there is much more to explore in these domains .",
    "the result of our exploration has been the articulation of a mathematical region that lies in the crack between set theory and its notational foundations .",
    "we have articulated the concepts of container @xmath0 and extainer @xmath1 and shown how the formal algebras generated by these forms encompass significant parts of the logic of dna replication , the dirac formalism for quantum mechanics , formalism for protein folding and the temperley lieb algebra at the foundations of topological invariants of knots and links .",
    "it is the mathematician s duty to point out formal domains that apply to a multiplicity of contexts . in this case",
    "we suggest that it is just possible that there are deeper connections among these apparently diverse contexts that are only hinted at in the steps taken so far .",
