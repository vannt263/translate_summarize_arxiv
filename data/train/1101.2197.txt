    "the number of consistent , meta - stable vacua of string , m- or ( predominantly ) f - theory flux compactifications which exhibit broadly plausible phenomenology , including moduli stabilization and broken supersymmetry  @xcite , is popularly estimated  @xcite to be of order @xmath4 .",
    "it is moreover currently in vogue to suggest that degeneracy of common features across these many `` universes '' might statistically isolate the physically realistic universe from the vast `` landscape '' , much as the entropy function coaxes the singular order of macroscopic thermodynamics from the chaotic duplicity of the entangled quantum microstate .",
    "we argue here though the counter point that we are not obliged _ a priori _ to live in the likeliest of all universes , but only in one which is possible .",
    "the existence merely of a non - zero probability for our existence is sufficient .",
    "we indulge for this effort the fanciful imagination that the `` multiverse '' of string vacua might exhibit some literal realization beyond our own physical sphere .",
    "a single electron may be said to wander all histories through interfering apertures , though its arrival is ultimately registered at a localized point on the target .",
    "the journey to that destination is steered by the full dynamics of the theory , although the isolated spontaneous solution reflects only faintly the richness of the solution ensemble . whether the multiverse be reverie or reality",
    ", the conceptual superset of our own physics which it embodies must certainly represent the interference of all navigable universal histories .",
    "surely many times afore has mankind s notion of the heavens expanded - the earth dispatched from its central pedestal in our solar system and the sun rendered one among some hundred billion stars of the milky way , itself reduced to one among some hundred billion galaxies .",
    "finally perhaps , we come to the completion of our odyssey , by realizing that our universe is one of at least @xmath4 so possible , thus rendering the anthropic view of our position in the universe ( environmental coincidences explained away by the availability of @xmath5 solar systems ) functionally equivalent to the anthropic view of the origin of the universe ( coincidences in the form and content of physical laws explained away by the availability , through dynamical phase transitions , of @xmath4 universes ) . nature s bounty has anyway invariably trumped our wildest anticipations , and though frugal and equanimous in law , she has spared no extravagance or whimsy in its manifestation .",
    "our perspective should not be misconstrued , however , as complacent retreat into the tautology of the weak anthropic principle .",
    "it is indeed unassailable truism that an observed universe must afford and sustain the life of the observer , including requisite constraints , for example , on the cosmological constant  @xcite and gauge hierarchy .",
    "our point of view , though , is sharply different ; we should be able to resolve the cosmological constant and gauge hierarchy problems through investigation of the fundamental laws of our ( or any single ) universe , its accidental and specific properties notwithstanding , without resorting to the existence of observers .",
    "in our view , the observer is the output of , not the _ raison dtre _ of , our universe .",
    "thus , our attention is advance from this base camp of our own physics , as unlikely an appointment as it may be , to the summit goal of the master theory and symmetries which govern all possible universes . in so seeking",
    ", our first halting forage must be that of a concrete string model which can describe nature locally .",
    "the greatest mystery of nature is the origin of the universe itself .",
    "modern cosmology is relatively clear regarding the occurrence of a hot big bang , and subsequent planck , grand unification , cosmic inflation , lepto- and baryogenesis , and electroweak epochs , followed by nucleosynthesis , radiation decoupling , and large scale structure formation . in particular",
    ", cosmic inflation can address the flatness and monopole problems , explain homogeneity , and generate the fractional anisotropy of the cosmic background radiation by quantum fluctuation of the inflaton field  @xcite . a key question",
    "though , is from whence the energy of the universe arose .",
    "interestingly , the gravitational field in an inflationary scenario can supply the required positive mass - kinetic energy , since its potential energy becomes negative without bound , allowing that the total energy could be exactly zero .",
    "perhaps the most striking revelation of the post - wmap  @xcite era is the decisive determination that our universe is indeed globally flat , _",
    "i.e. _  with the net energy contributions from baryonic matter @xmath6 , dark matter @xmath7 , and the cosmological constant ( dark energy ) @xmath8 finely balanced against the gravitational potential .",
    "not long ago , it was possible to imagine the universe , with all of its physics intact , hosting any arbitrary mass - energy density , such that `` @xmath9 '' would represent a super - critical cosmology of positive curvature , and `` @xmath10 '' the sub - critical case of negative curvature . in hindsight , this may come to seem as nave as the notion of an empty infinite cartesian space .",
    "the observed energy balance is highly suggestive of a fundamental symmetry which protects the `` @xmath11 '' critical solution , such that the physical constants of our universe may not be divorced from its net content .",
    "this null energy condition licenses the speculative connection _ ex nihilo _ of our present universe back to the primordial quantum fluctuation of an external system .",
    "indeed , there is nothing which quantum mechanics abhors more than nothingness .",
    "this being the case , an extra universe here or there might rightly be considered no extra trouble at all ! specifically , it has been suggested  @xcite that the fluctuations of a dynamically evolved expanding universe might spontaneously produce tunneling from a false vacuum into an adjacent ( likely also false ) meta - stable vacuum of lower energy , driving a local inflationary phase , much as a crystal of ice or a bubble of steam may nucleate and expand in a super - cooled or super - heated fluid during first order transition . in this `` eternal inflation '' scenario",
    ", such patches of space will volumetrically dominate by virtue of their exponential expansion , recursively generating an infinite fractal array of causally disconnected `` russian doll '' universes , nesting each within another , and each featuring its own unique physical parameters and physical laws . from just the specific location on the solution `` target '' where our own universe landed",
    ", it may be impossible to directly reconstruct the full theory .",
    "fundamentally , it may be impossible even in principle to specify why our particular universe is precisely as it is . however",
    ", superstring theory and its generalizations may yet present to us a loftier prize - the theory of the ensemble multiverse .",
    "more important than any differences between various possible vacua are the properties which might be invariant , protected by basic symmetries of the underlying mechanics .",
    "we suppose that one such basic property must be cosmological flatness , so that the seedling universe may transition dynamically across the boundary of its own creation , maintaining a zero balance of some suitably defined energy function . in practice",
    ", this implies that gravity must be ubiquitous , its negative potential energy allowing for positive mass and kinetic energy .",
    "within such a universe , quantum fluctuations may not again cause isolated material objects to spring into existence , as their net energy must necessarily be positive .",
    "for the example of a particle with mass @xmath12 on the surface of the earth , the ratio of gravitational to mass energy is more than nine orders of magnitude too small @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the gravitational constant , @xmath15 is the speed of light , and @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the mass and radius of the earth , respectively . even in the limiting case of a schwarzschild black hole of mass @xmath18 , a particle of mass @xmath12 at the horizon @xmath19 has a gravitational potential which is only half of that required .",
    "@xmath20 it is important to note that while the energy density for the gravitational field is surely negative in newtonian mechanics , the global gravitational field energy is not well defined in general relativity .",
    "unique prescriptions for a stress - energy - momentum pseudotensor can be formulated though , notably that of landau and lifshitz .",
    "any such stress - energy can , however , be made to vanish locally by general coordinate transformation , and it is not even entirely clear that the pseudotensor so applied is an appropriate general relativistic object .",
    "given though that newtonian gravity is the classical limit of general relativity , it is reasonable to suspect that the properly defined field energy density will be likewise also negative , and that inflation is indeed consistent with a correctly generalized notion of constant , zero total energy",
    ".    a universe would then be in this sense closed , an island unto itself , from the moment of its inception from the quantum froth ; only a universe _ in toto _ might so originate , emerging as a critically bound structure possessing profound density and minute proportion , each as accorded against intrinsically defined scales ( the analogous newton and planck parameters and the propagation speed of massless fields ) , and expanding or inflating henceforth and eternally .",
    "inflation , driven by the scalar inflaton field is itself inherently a quantum field theoretic subject .",
    "however , there is tension between quantum mechanics and general relativity .",
    "currently , superstring theory is the best candidate for quantum gravity .",
    "the five consistent ten dimensional superstring theories , namely heterotic @xmath21 , heterotic @xmath22 , type i , type iia , type iib , can be unified by various duality transformations under an eleven - dimensional m - theory  @xcite , and the twelve - dimensional f - theory can be considered as the strongly coupled formulation of the type iib string theory with a varying axion - dilaton field  @xcite .",
    "self consistency of the string ( or m- , f- ) algebra implies a ten ( or eleven , twelve ) dimensional master spacetime , some elements of which  six ( or seven , eight ) to match our observed four large dimensions  may be compactified on a manifold ( typically calabi - yau manifolds or @xmath23 manifolds ) which conserves a requisite portion of supersymmetric charges .",
    "the structure of the curvature within the extra dimensions dictates in no small measure the particular phenomenology of the unfolded dimensions , secreting away the `` closet space '' to encode the symmetries of all gauged interactions .",
    "the physical volume of the internal spatial manifold is directly related to the effective planck scale and basic gauge coupling strengths in the external space .",
    "the compactification is in turn described by fundamental moduli fields which must be stabilized , _",
    "i.e. _  given suitable vacuum expectation values ( vevs ) .",
    "the famous example of kaluza and klein prototypes the manner in which general covariance in five dimensions is transformed to gravity plus maxwell theory in four dimensions when the transverse fifth dimension is cycled around a circle .",
    "the connection of geometry to particle physics is perhaps nowhere more intuitively clear than in the context of model building with @xmath24-branes , where the gauge structure and family replication are related directly to the brane stacking and intersection multiplicities .",
    "the yukawa couplings and higgs structure are in like manners also specified , leading after radiative symmetry breaking of the chiral gauge sector to low energy masses for the chiral fermions and broken gauge generators , each massless in the symmetric limit .    from a top - down view , supergravity ( sugra )",
    "is an ubiquitous infrared limit of string theory , and forms the starting point of any two - dimensional world sheet or d - dimensional target space action .",
    "the mandatory localization of the supersymmetry ( susy ) algebra , and thus the momentum - energy ( space - time translation ) operators , leads to general coordinate invariance of the action and an einstein field theory limit .",
    "any available flavor of supergravity will not however suffice .",
    "in general , extraneous fine tuning is required to avoid a cosmological constant which scales like a dimensionally suitable power of the planck mass .",
    "neglecting even the question of whether such a universe might be permitted to appear spontaneously , it would then be doomed to curl upon itself and collapse within the order of the planck time , for comparison about @xmath25 seconds in our universe .",
    "expansion and inflation appear to uniquely require properties which arise naturally only in the no - scale sugra formulation  @xcite .",
    "susy is in this case broken while the vacuum energy density vanishes automatically at tree level due to a suitable choice of the khler potential , the function which specifies the metric on superspace . at the minimum of the null scalar potential ,",
    "there are flat directions which leave the compactification moduli vevs undetermined by the classical equations of motion .",
    "we thus receive without additional effort an answer to the deep question of how these moduli are stabilized ; they have been transformed into dynamical variables which are to be determined by minimizing corrections to the scalar potential at loop order . in particular , the high energy gravitino mass @xmath26 , and also the proportionally equivalent universal gaugino mass @xmath27 , will be established in this way .",
    "subsequently , all gauge mediated susy breaking soft - terms will be dynamically evolved down from this boundary under the renormalization group  @xcite , establishing in large measure the low energy phenomenology , and solving also the flavour changing neutral current ( fcnc ) problem . since the moduli are fixed at a false local minimum , phase transitions by quantum tunneling will naturally occur between discrete vacua .",
    "we conjecture , for the reasons given prior , that the no - scale sugra construction could pervade all universes in the string landscape with reasonable flux vacua .",
    "this being the case , intelligent creatures elsewhere in the multiverse , though separated from us by a bridge too far , might reasonably so concur after parallel examination of their own physics . moreover , they might leverage via this insight a deeper knowledge of the underlying multiverse - invariant master theory , of which our known string , m- , and f - theories may compose some coherently overlapping patch of the garment edge .",
    "perhaps we yet share appreciation , across the cords which bind our 13.7 billion years to their corresponding blink of history , for the common timeless principles under which we are but two isolated condensations upon two particular vacuum solutions among the physical ensemble .",
    "though we engage in this work lofty and speculative questions of natural philosophy , we balance abstraction against the measured material underpinnings of concrete phenomenological models with direct and specific connection to tested and testable particle physics .",
    "if the suggestion is correct that eternal inflation and no - scale sugra models with string origins together describe what is in fact our multiverse , then we must as a prerequisite settle the issue of whether our own phenomenology can be produced out of such a construction .    in the context of type ii intersecting d - brane models ,",
    "we have indeed found one realistic pati - salam model which might describe nature as we observe it  @xcite .",
    "if only the f - terms of three complex structure moduli are non - zero , we also automatically have vanishing vacuum energy , and obtain a generalized no - scale sugra .",
    "it seems to us that the string derived grand unified theories ( guts ) , and particularly the flipped @xmath28 models  @xcite , are also candidate realistic string models with promising predictions that can be tested at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) , the tevatron , and other future experiments .    in the latter case , the flipped @xmath28 gauge symmetry can be broken down to the sm gauge symmetry by giving vevs to one pair of the higgs fields @xmath29 and @xmath30 with quantum numbers @xmath31 and @xmath32 , respectively .",
    "the doublet - triplet splitting problem can be solved naturally via the missing partner mechanism  @xcite . historically , flipped @xmath28 models",
    "have been constructed systematically in the free fermionic string constructions at kac - moody level one  @xcite . to address the little hierarchy problem between the unification scale and the string scale , the testable flipped @xmath28 model class",
    "was proposed , which introduces extra tev - scale vector - like particles  @xcite .",
    "models of this type have been constructed locally as examples of f - theory model building  @xcite , and dubbed @xmath0-@xmath1  @xcite within that context .",
    "most recently , we have studied no - scale extensions of the prior in detail  @xcite , emphasizing the essential role of the tripodal foundation formed by the @xmath33-lipped @xmath1 gut  @xcite , two pairs of tev scale vector - like multiplets with origins in @xmath33-theory  @xcite model building , and the boundary conditions of no - scale supergravity  @xcite .",
    "it appears that the no - scale scenario , particularly vanishing of the higgs bilinear soft term @xmath34 , comes into its own only when applied at an elevated scale , approaching the planck mass .",
    "@xmath35 gev , the point of the second stage @xmath36 unification , emerges in turn as a suitable candidate scale only when substantially decoupled from the primary gut scale unification of @xmath37 via the modification to the renormalization group equations ( rges ) from the extra @xmath0-theory vector multiplets .",
    "in particular , we have systematically established the hyper - surface within the @xmath38 , top quark mass @xmath39 , gaugino mass @xmath27 , and vector - like particle mass @xmath40 parameter volume which is compatible with the application of the simplest no - scale sugra boundary conditions  @xcite , particularly the vanishing of the higgs bilinear soft term @xmath34 at the ultimate @xmath41-@xmath1 unification scale  @xcite .",
    "we have demonstrated that simultaneous adherence to all current experimental constraints , most importantly contributions to the muon anomalous magnetic moment @xmath42  @xcite , the branching ratio limit on @xmath43  @xcite , and the 7-year wmap relic density measurement  @xcite , dramatically reduces the allowed solutions to a highly non - trivial `` golden strip '' with @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 , and @xmath47 , effectively eliminating all extraneously tunable model parameters , where the consonance of the theoretically viable @xmath39 range with the experimentally established value  @xcite is an independently correlated `` postdiction '' . finally , taking a fixed @xmath48-boson mass , we have dynamically determined the universal gaugino mass @xmath27 and fixed @xmath38 via the `` super no - scale '' mechanism  @xcite , that being the secondary minimization , or _",
    "minimum minimorum _ , of the minimum @xmath49 of the higgs potential for the electroweak symmetry breaking ( ewsb ) vacuum .",
    "these models are moreover quite interesting from a phenomenological point of view  @xcite .",
    "the predicted vector - like particles can be observed at the large hadron collider , and the partial lifetime for proton decay in the leading @xmath50 channels falls around @xmath51 years , testable at the future hyper - kamiokande  @xcite and deep underground science and engineering laboratory ( dusel )  @xcite experiments  @xcite .",
    "the lightest cp - even higgs boson mass can be increased  @xcite , hybrid inflation can be naturally realized , and the correct cosmic primordial density fluctuations can be generated  @xcite .",
    "in the traditional framework , supersymmetry is broken in the hidden sector , and then its breaking effects are mediated to the observable sector via gravity or gauge interactions . in guts with",
    "gravity mediated supersymmetry breaking , also known as the minimal supergravity ( msugra ) model , the supersymmetry breaking soft terms can be parameterized by four universal parameters : the gaugino mass @xmath27 , scalar mass @xmath53 , trilinear soft term @xmath54 , and the ratio of higgs vevs @xmath38 at low energy , plus the sign of the higgs bilinear mass term @xmath55 . the @xmath55 term and its bilinear soft term @xmath56 are determined by the @xmath48-boson mass @xmath57 and @xmath38 after the electroweak ( ew ) symmetry breaking .    to solve the cosmological constant problem , no - scale supergravity was proposed  @xcite .",
    "no - scale supergravity is defined as the subset of supergravity models which satisfy the following three constraints  @xcite : ( i ) the vacuum energy vanishes automatically due to the suitable khler potential ; ( ii ) at the minimum of the scalar potential , there are flat directions which leave the gravitino mass @xmath26 undetermined ; ( iii ) the super - trace quantity @xmath58 is zero at the minimum . without this , the large one - loop corrections would force @xmath26 to be either zero or of planck scale . a simple khler potential which satisfies the first two conditions",
    "is @xmath59 where @xmath60 is a modulus field and @xmath61 are matter fields .",
    "the third condition is model dependent and can always be satisfied in principle  @xcite .    the scalar fields of eq .",
    "( [ ns - kahler ] ) parameterize the coset space @xmath62 , where @xmath63 is the number of matter fields .",
    "analogous structures appear in the @xmath64 extended supergravity theories  @xcite , for example , @xmath65 for @xmath66 , which can be realized in the compactifications of string theory  @xcite .",
    "the non - compact structure of the symmetry implies that the potential is not only constant but actually identical to zero . for the simple example khler potential",
    "given above , one can readily check that the scalar potential is automatically positive semi - definite , and has a flat direction along the @xmath60 field .",
    "likewise , it may be verified that the simplest no - scale boundary conditions @xmath67 emerge dynamically , while @xmath27 may be non - zero at the unification scale , allowing for low energy susy breaking .",
    "the specific khler potential of eq .  ( [ ns - kahler ] ) has been independently derived in both weakly coupled heterotic string theory  @xcite and the leading order compactification of m - theory on @xmath68  @xcite .",
    "note that in both cases , the yang - mills fields span a ten dimensional space - time .",
    "it is not obtained directly out of f - theory , as represented for example by the strong coupling lift from type iib intersecting d - brane model building with d7- and d3-branes  @xcite , where the yang - mills fields on the d7-branes occupy an eight dimensional space - time .",
    "nevertheless , it is certainly possible in principle to calculate a gauge kinetic function , kahler potential and superpotential in the context of type iib interecting d - brane model building , and the f - theory could thus admit a more general definition of no - scale supergravity , as realized by a khler potential like @xmath69 where only three of the moduli fields @xmath70 and @xmath71 may yield non - zero f - terms .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , no - scale supergravity was obtained in the type iib and f - theory compactifications at the leading order .",
    "likewise , the subsequently introduced kklt  @xcite constructions also manifest a no - scale sugra structure at the classical level . indeed , the no - scale features are generically obtained at the tree - level in string theory compactifications due to the presence of three complex extra dimensions . however ,",
    "this classical level result is rather precariously balanced , and may be spoiled by quantum corrections to the superpotential including flux contributions , instanton effects , gaugino condensation , and the next order @xmath72 corrections . in this sense , we consider the kklt type sugra models as a generalization or extension of the elemental no - scale form .    the no - scale @xmath0-@xmath1 model under discussion has been constructed locally in f - theory  @xcite , although the mass of the additional vector - like multiplets , and even the fact of their existence , is not mandated by the f - theory , wherein it is also possible to realize models with only the traditional flipped ( or standard ) @xmath1 field content .",
    "we claim only an inherent consistency of their conceptual origin out of the f - theoretic construction , and take the manifest phenomenological benefits which accompany the natural elevation of the secondary gut unification phase to @xmath73  gev as justification for the greater esteem which we hold for this particular model above other alternatives .",
    "there are , though , also delicate questions of compatibility between the local f - theoretic model building origins and the purely field - theoretic rge running which we employ up to the presumed high scale .",
    "as one approaches the planck mass @xmath74 , consideration must be given to the role which will be played by kaluza klein ( kk ) and string mode excitations , and also to corrections of order @xmath75 from stabilization of the global volume of the six - dimensional internal space in association with the establishment of the string scale @xmath76 .",
    "the most important question is whether our model can in fact be embedded into a globally consistent framework . without such",
    ", we do not know the concrete khler potential of the sm fermions and higgs fields , and can not by this means explicitly calculate the supersymmetry breaking scalar masses and trilinear soft terms .",
    "this construction remains elusive though , and is beyond the reach of the current work .",
    "regardless , one may anticipate that in such a globally consistent model , a string scale of order @xmath77  gev would indeed be realized , as in the weakly coupled heterotic string theory , tying in nicely with our navely projected value for @xmath78 .",
    "it seems additionally that a field - theoretic application of the no - scale boundary conditions might prove to be validated in this case .",
    "moreover , we would not necessarily require the presence of instanton effects or gaugino condensation for stabilization of the modulus @xmath60 as in the kklt mechanism .",
    "this is crucial , because such effects can have the negative side effect of destroying the leading no - scale structure .",
    "in fact , we could have no gaugino condensation at all , or the superpotential from gaugino condensation might only depend on @xmath70 , as again exemplified in the type iib intersecting d - brane models  @xcite",
    ".    such considerations , coupled with the demonstrated testability and phenomenological success of the first order analysis in the simplest no - scale sugra framework , argue for a continuing study of the generalized no - scale sugra picture .",
    "it is important to note that there exist several such generalizations , including the previously mentioned type ii intersecting d - brane models  @xcite , mirage mediation of flux compactifications  @xcite , and the extraction of susy breaking soft terms from the leading order compactification of m - theory on @xmath68  @xcite ; in the latter case we have previously obtained ( in a different model context ) a generalization employing modulus dominated susy breaking  @xcite .    in this paper , however , we maintain a `` first steps first '' perspective , concentrating on the simplest no - scale supergravity and reserving any such extensions for the future .",
    "the potential for stringy modifications duly noted , we then essentially aim to study an f - theory _ inspired _ variety of low energy susy phenomenology , remaining agnostic as to the details of the khler structure .",
    "nevertheless , by studying the simplest no - scale supergravity , we may still expect to encapsulate the correct leading order behavior .",
    "we likewise maintain the simplicity of a leading order approximation by neglecting consideration of any stringy threshold corrections , the substantive onset of which is anyway expected to be deferred to @xmath78 , the true gut scale of this model .",
    "it should be added that since the running of the gauge couplings is logarithmically dependent upon the mass scale , the contributions to the rges from the string and kk mode excitations are quite small .",
    "the single relevant modulus field in the simplest stringy no - scale supergravity is the khler modulus @xmath60 , a characteristic of the calabi - yau manifold , the dilaton coupling being irrelevant .",
    "we consider the gaugino mass @xmath27 as a useful modulus related to the f - term of @xmath60 , stipulating , in other words , that the gauge kinetic function must depend on @xmath60 .",
    "this is realized , for example , in the type iib intersecting d - brane models  @xcite where gauge kinetic functions explicitly depend on both @xmath70 and @xmath71 , as in eq .",
    "( [ kahler2 ] ) . again , since the f - theory may be considered as a strongly coupled formulation of the type iib string theory , it is natural to believe that the gauge kinetic function under this lift depends on @xmath60 as well . while the limit is quite suggestive , lacking still a concrete globally consistent embedding , we can not definitively prove that the superpotential remains unperturbed by @xmath60 .",
    "proceeding tentatively as such , the f - term of @xmath60 generates the gravitino mass @xmath26 , which is proportionally equivalent to @xmath27 . exploiting the simplest no - scale boundary condition at @xmath78 and running from high energy to low energy under the rges",
    ", there can be a secondary minimization , or _",
    "minimum minimorum _ , of the minimum of the higgs potential @xmath49 for the ewsb vacuum .",
    "since @xmath49 depends on @xmath27 , the gaugino mass @xmath27 is consequently dynamically determined by the equation @xmath79 , aptly referred to as the `` super no - scale '' mechanism  @xcite .",
    "it could easily have been that in consideration of the above technique , there were : a ) too few undetermined parameters , with the @xmath80 condition forming an incompatible over - constraint , and thus demonstrably false , or b ) so many undetermined parameters that the dynamic determination possessed many distinct solutions , or was so far separated from experiment that it could not possibly be demonstrated to be true .",
    "the actual state of affairs is much more propitious , being specifically as follows .",
    "the three parameters @xmath81 are once again identically zero at the boundary because of the defining khler potential , and are thus known at all other scales as well by the rges .",
    "the minimization of the higgs scalar potential with respect to the neutral elements of both susy higgs doublets gives two conditions , the first of which fixes the magnitude of @xmath55 .",
    "the second condition , which would traditionally be used to fix @xmath56 , instead here enforces a consistency relationship on the remaining parameters , being that @xmath56 is already constrained .",
    "in general , the @xmath82 condition gives a hypersurface of solutions cut out from a very large parameter space .",
    "if we lock all but one parameter , it will give the final value .",
    "if we take a slice of two dimensional space , as has been described , it will give a relation between two parameters for all others fixed .",
    "in a three - dimensional view with @xmath56 on the vertical axis , this curve is the `` flat direction '' line along the bottom of the trench of @xmath80 solutions . in general",
    ", we must vary at least two parameters rather than just one in isolation , in order that their mutual compensation may transport the solution along this curve .",
    "the most natural first choice is in some sense the pair of prominent unknown inputs @xmath27 and @xmath38 , as was demonstrated in ref .",
    "@xcite .    having come to this point ,",
    "it is by no means guaranteed that the potential will form a stable minimum .",
    "it must be emphasized that the @xmath80 no - scale boundary condition is the central agent affording this determination , as it is the extraction of the parameterized parabolic curve of solutions in the two compensating variables which allows for a localized , bound nadir point to be isolated by the super no - scale condition , dynamically determining _ both _ parameters .",
    "the background surface of @xmath49 for the full parameter space outside the viable @xmath80 subset is , in contrast , a steadily inclined and uninteresting function . in our prior study , the local _ minimum minimorum _ of @xmath49 for the choices @xmath83 gev and @xmath84 gev dynamically established @xmath85 , and @xmath2 .",
    "although we have remarked that @xmath27 and @xmath38 have no _ directly _ established experimental values , they are severely indirectly constrained by phenomenology in the context of this model  @xcite .",
    "it is highly non - trivial that there should be accord between the top - down and bottom - up perspectives , but this is indeed precisely what has been observed  @xcite .",
    "an alternate pair of parameters for which one may attempt to isolate a @xmath82 curve , which we consider for the first time in this work , is that of @xmath27 and the gut scale @xmath86 , at which the @xmath87 and @xmath88 couplings initially meet .",
    "fundamentally , the latter corresponds to the modulus which sets the total magnitude of the gut higgs field s vevs .",
    "@xmath86 could of course in some sense be considered a `` known '' quantity , taking the low energy couplings as input . indeed ,",
    "starting from the measured sm gauge couplings and fermion yukawa couplings at the standard @xmath89  gev electroweak scale , we may calculate both @xmath86 and the final unification scale @xmath78 , and subsequently the unified gauge coupling and sm fermion yukawa couplings at @xmath78 , via running of the rges .",
