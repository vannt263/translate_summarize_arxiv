    "many galaxies display lopsided , rather than bisymmetric , structure , on both large and small scales .",
    "hubble space telescope observations show that the nuclei of m31 and ngc 4486b do not lie at the center of the bulge isophotes ( lauer  1993 , 1996 ; davidge  1997 ) . in our own milky way",
    ", the distribution of molecular gas as measured in co is offset about @xmath1 in longitude and + 15  in velocity from the center ( binney  1991 ) ; other mass concentrations in that region also appear to be off - center ( blitz 1995 ) .",
    "on kiloparsec scales , many galaxies are asymmetric in both their optical appearance and their gas distribution (  baldwin , lynden - bell & sancisi 1980 ) .",
    "working from a sample of 1700 spectra , richter & sancisi ( 1994 ) estimate that about half of all late - type spiral galaxies show clearly asymmetric hi profiles , indicating a lopsided gas disk ; about half of this sample are nearby field galaxies , and none lie in rich clusters where interactions between galaxies are frequent .",
    "zaritsky & rix ( 1997 ) estimate that about 50% of spiral galaxies in the field are significantly lopsided at optical and near - infrared wavelengths ; the asymmetry involves both young and old stellar populations , and most of their lopsided galaxies lack any obvious companions .",
    "asymmetric bars are particularly common in late type or small disk galaxies , less luminous than @xmath2 (  feitzinger 1980 ; odewahn 1996 ; matthews & gallagher 1997 ) .",
    "while some lopsidedness in the outer parts of galaxies is undoubtedly due to recent accretion , the fact that lopsided asymmetries are so common suggests that they can be long - lived .",
    "the origin and persistence of these disk asymmetries remain a mystery .",
    "baldwin ,  ( 1980 ) suggest that the lopsided distortions seen in the outer parts of galaxies are kinematic features ; in that case they should wind themselves into a leading spiral , since the slow pattern speed @xmath3 is negative .",
    "in fact the one - armed spiral often has the same sense of winding as the two - armed components , which presumably trail ( colin & athanassoula 1989 ; phookun  1992 , 1993 ) .",
    "the only analytic disk models which are strongly unstable to lopsided distortions are those with many retrograde - streaming particles ( zang & hohl 1978 ; sawamura 1988 ; sellwood & merritt 1994 ) ; but observed counter - rotation is rare in disk galaxies (  kuijken , fisher & merrifield 1996 ) .",
    "adams , ruden & shu ( 1989 ) suggested that a protostellar disk could become unstable to a lopsided distortion ; in the galactic context , this would correspond to the stellar disk being off - center in the dark halo .",
    "however , heemskerk , papaloizou & savonije ( 1992 ) showed that the @xmath4 distortion is generally evanescent in the disk , so that resonant growth will not occur .",
    "matthias ( 1993 ) , investigating orbits in a weakly ` egg - shaped ' tumbling potential , found that prograde orbits were distorted so as to oppose the ` eggness ' .",
    "miller & smith ( 1992 ) describe an @xmath0-body simulation of an elliptical galaxy in which a central tilted disk developed of an off - center motion , tracing an oscillation in the underlying particle distribution , and taga & iye ( 1998 ) have done simulations in which a massive object wanders off - center in a dense stellar system ; but no similar results have been reported in the literature .",
    "by contrast , kinematic models for lopsided systems have been quite successful ; orbits in the potential of an off - center bar rotating rigidly in an axisymmetric disk can account for the rotation curves of magellanic barred systems ( de vaucouleurs & freeman 1973 ; christiansen & jeffreys 1976 ) , while the gas response has a trailing one - armed form ( colin & athanassoula 1989 ) .",
    "we propose that the key to the puzzling ubiquity of lopsided galactic disks is that they are not dynamically isolated inside the galaxy .",
    "late - type spirals and dwarf galaxies , in which larger - scale lopsidedness is most frequently observed , are most likely to be dominated by dark halo mass :  casertano & van gorkom ( 1991 ) ; ct , carignan & sancisi ( 1991 ) ; broeils ( 1992a , b ) .",
    "( athanassoula , bosma & papaoiannou 1987 suggested that in later - type galaxies the halo core is larger in relation to the radius of the stellar disk , although this was not confirmed by broeils 1992a , b. ) if a disk found itself off - center in a dominant dark halo with a core of nearly constant density that was large compared to the disk dimensions , most of the disk mass would lie in a region where the angular speed of an orbit about the halo center did not vary strongly .",
    "self - gravity might then act to maintain the disk s coherence as it orbits the center of the halo potential well .",
    "this paper presents our investigation of just such a model using a self - consistent , self - gravitating disk embedded in a static dark halo .",
    "we used a tree code (  barnes & hut 1989 ) implemented in nemo ( teuben 1995 ) to follow the development of a rotating disk which was set up in equilibrium at the center of a fixed ` halo ' potential , then displaced off - center ; every disk particle was also given a ` sideways ' velocity appropriate to a circular orbit in the halo potential at the radius of the disk center .",
    "our disk was represented by @xmath5 particles , distributed in a kuzmin - toomre disk ( eq .",
    "2 - 49 of binney & tremaine 1987 ) of unit scale length , which we truncated at @xmath6 .",
    "the velocity dispersion in the disk plane was set so that toomre s ( 1964 ) stability parameter @xmath7 ; for our 3-d simulations , we then ` puffed up ' the disk , by setting the vertical velocity dispersion equal to half that in the radial direction .",
    "the halo was of pseudo - isothermal form : @xmath8 the density @xmath9 is approximately constant within the core radius @xmath10 ; the speed of a circular orbit in this potential rises linearly in the core , becoming flat at large radii .",
    "we took @xmath11 , and chose @xmath12 and the disk density so that the total mass inside @xmath13 is unity .",
    "the halo contributes 90% of this total , and accounts for 60% of the mass within 5 disk scale lengths of the center , consistent with the findings of broeils ( 1992a , b ) for galaxies with @xmath14 .",
    "the time step @xmath15 was @xmath16 , and the explicit softening parameter @xmath17 , close to the optimum suggested by the method of merritt ( 1996 ) ; moderate variations in @xmath18 made little difference .",
    "the opening angle for the tree code was set at @xmath19 , providing a good balance between resolution and speed .",
    "when the disk spin is retrograde with respect to its orbit around the halo center , we find that the disk remains off - center while making several orbits of the halo .",
    "figure  1 shows a run in which the disk center was initially displaced by @xmath20 , so that about 20% of its mass lay at @xmath21 , within the halo core .",
    "the velocity dispersion is sufficiently low that the disk formed a bar , which persisted throughout the simulation .",
    "freeman ( see de vaucouleurs & freeman 1973 ) proposed a model for magellanic barred galaxies in which the bar was displaced parallel to its minor axis from the center of a rotating disk ; calculations of periodic closed orbits in freeman s potential showed that the model could reproduce the observed offset between the center of the rotation curve measured in the gas and the bar center",
    ". the lower section of figure  1 shows the ` stellar ' rotation curve of our model galaxy , as it would be seen by an observer for whom the minor axis of the bar lies in the plane of the sky ; the distance @xmath22 is measured from the centroid of the most - bound bar particles .",
    "the center of rotation , at @xmath23 , is displaced from that centroid , and the rotation curve is clearly asymmetric .    when started with a larger displacement , @xmath24",
    ", our retrograde disk drifted inwards to @xmath25 , just outside the halo core ( see figure  2 ) .",
    "if we gave the disk insufficient angular momentum for a circular orbit in the halo , it first moved inwards , and then onto a near - circular orbit within the core .",
    "the lower portion of figure  2 is for a disk with prograde rotation , which drifts inwards more strongly than one in retrograde orbit ; even so , it stays at @xmath26 while making several orbits of the halo . in runs with @xmath27 , where the core radius of the halo is not large compared with the scale length of the disk ,",
    "neither the prograde nor the retrograde disk remained far off - center .",
    "our experiments imply that a gravitating galactic disk can remain off - center in a halo potential as long as it orbits in a region where the halo has nearly constant density ; the effect is more pronounced if the spin of the disk is in the opposite sense to its orbit around the halo center .",
    "this behavior can be understood in the limit where the disk dimensions are small , and its self - gravity is weak : a particle in near - circular orbit in the halo then follows an epicycle in a sense retrograde to the orbit .",
    "a collection of particles with the same angular momentum , and hence with a common guiding - center radius , would stay together as they orbited the halo center . in the halo core , where the orbital frequency does not vary strongly with radius ,",
    "the disk s self - gravity can fairly easily maintain coherence in approximately this configuration .",
    "the relatively large fraction of lopsided systems found at redshifts @xmath28 , which was apparently a period of rapid galaxy formation (  driver , windhorst & griffiths 1995 ) , suggests that many disks can slowly lose their off - center character as they settle down . in dwarf galaxies ,",
    "the halo is relatively more massive ( broeils 1992a , b ) , so lopsidedness is more easily maintained than in more luminous systems .",
    "the relation between a lopsided disk and the presence of a central bar has not been studied systematically , but both these features are characteristic of magellanic irregular systems .",
    "the lopsided sc galaxy ngc  1637 ( block  1994 ) appears prominently barred in an infrared image , while at optical wavelengths the bar is hidden by dust and confused by star formation .",
    "the spatial scale of the predicted asymmetry is approximately that of the constant - density core ; consistent with this idea , the off - center nuclei of m31 and the elliptical ngc  4486b lie within resolved central cores in those galaxies .",
    "our results are consistent with those of bontekoe ( 1988 ) , who investigated the sinking of a satellite galaxy into a larger system . in his unpublished fifth chapter , he reports that the satellite never sank all the way to the center , but the orbit shrank until it enclosed about 10% of the main galaxy s mass .",
    "the larger system was represented by a series of polytropes ; the more concentrated the polytrope , the closer the satellite sank to its center .",
    "our study also has aspects in common with work on galaxy mergers by miller & smith ( 1995 ) , who found that if two polytropic ` cores ' orbited each other in isolation , dynamical friction caused them to merge within a couple of orbits .",
    "but in the presence of a ` halo ' of constant density , whether it was represented by a fixed potential , or consisted of ` live ' simulation particles , the cores survived for @xmath29 orbits without coming noticeably closer , although the interpretation of the ` live halo ' model was complicated by an overstable oscillation in the cores orbital radii .",
    "persistent off - center disks have not been reported in published @xmath0-body simulations following a galactic disk in an imposed external bulge potential ( see  sellwood & wilkinson 1993 ) ; but in these computations , the mass distribution of the bulge was in general more concentrated than the disk .",
    "we must be concerned about the effect of dynamical friction on the disk , from the particles which would make up a ` live ' galactic halo . in the context of m31 s nucleus , king , stanford & crane ( 1995 )",
    "point out that this drag could well be small , if the bulge stars stream rapidly in the same direction as the orbiting cluster s motion .",
    "it is unclear even how far the usual estimates of dynamical friction are to be trusted .",
    "bontekoe s ( 1988 ) satellite stopped sinking at some distance from the center of the system into which it was accreting .",
    "the physical situation of an off - center disk has much in common with that of a rotating bar , where estimates of the drag from the particles of a spherical halo suggest that the bar should rapidly spin down ( weinberg 1985 ) , and gravitational @xmath0-body experiments also indicate strong braking . but observed galactic bars seem to be fast - rotating : sellwood ( 1996 ) summarizes this confusing situation .",
    "the long - lived pairs of _ counter - rotating _ bars which develop in the gravitational @xmath0-body simulations of sellwood & merritt ( 1994 ) and friedli ( 1996 ) are clearly not discouraged by dynamical friction .",
    "it may well be more useful , instead of calculating only the back - reaction of the halo on the orbiting disk , to look for long - lived modes of oscillation in the combined system .",
    "weinberg ( 1991 , 1994 ) has developed an analytic method for doing this ; examining spherical king models with an isotropic velocity dispersion , he found @xmath4 modes which , once excited , require many orbital times to decay .",
    "the distortions lasted longest in the models in which the core was largest in relation to the total extent of the system .",
    "he then used gravitational @xmath0-body simulations to confirm the existence of these modes .",
    "similar lopsided modes may well exist for a disk within a galactic halo .",
    "we would then expect a relatively long - lived lopsided structure to result when material is accreted such as to push it off - center in the underlying potential . in the central regions of a galaxy , where the gravitational force is provided largely by a ` hot ' stellar system such as a bulge , an inner disk or nuclear star cluster could remain off - center over many orbital periods .",
    "gas might be captured by a galactic disk such as to push it off - center in the halo ; alternatively , accretion of dark matter onto the halo may result in the disk lying off - center .",
    "if the orbit of the disk is retrograde with respect to its spin , the lopsidedness is likely to be stronger and more persistent . to maintain appreciable asymmetry",
    ", the near - constant - density halo core should be large enough to encompass a substantial fraction of the disk mass .",
