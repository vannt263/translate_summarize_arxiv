    "since the discovery of the lafeaso@xmath11f@xmath12 superconductor , various types of iron - based superconductors with layered structures containing fep , feas , fese , and fete layers have been reported .",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite reported superconductivity for fese@xmath11 with @xmath4=8 k , at @xmath13=0.12 and 0.18 .",
    "since then , the @xmath4 of the iron - selenide superconductor has been increased rapidly to 27 k at pressure @xmath14=1.48 gpa  @xcite .",
    "recent studies of the pressure effect on iron - selenide  @xcite reported that @xmath4 reaches 36@xmath1537 k at higher pressure  @xcite , clearly putting fese@xmath11 in the high @xmath4 category with iron pnictides having similar band filling  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath4 has also been increased by partial substitutions of the se site with s or te  @xcite .",
    "in particular , there are a number of reports on fese@xmath11te@xmath12  @xcite , because crystal growth is easy and the material is less toxic than se or as .",
    "the fese system is one of the most attractive systems for solving the mechanism of high @xmath4 superconductors , because it has the simplest crystal structure among the iron - based superconductors reported .",
    "in addition , the parent compound in fese exhibits the superconductivity@xcite unlike other iron - based superconductors . after reported hsu _ et al .",
    "_ , it has been reported that the synthesis method of the fese polycrystalline samples has used mostly solid - state reaction method  @xcite .",
    "there are a few reports of the synthesis method of single crystalline samples using a flux method  @xcite or vapor self - transport method  @xcite .",
    "the above mentioned samples were synthesized with a se deficiency for a nominal composition of fese@xmath11 , and indicated @xmath4@xmath158.5 k or lower at ambient pressure  @xcite .",
    "in addition , fese@xmath11 with se deficiency was reported to exhibit sdw transition / magnetic anomalies near 100 k  @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", ref  @xcite reported that fese exhibited superconductivity at a narrow range of stoichiometric fe@xmath16se , or equivalently , fese@xmath17 without magnetic ordering .",
    "this report is consistent with the nmr experimental results for stoichiometric fese compounds  @xcite .",
    "these suggest that magnetism is driven by anion vacancies in fese@xmath11  @xcite .",
    "our sample was synthesized using the se self - flux method with a nominal compositions of fe : se=1:1.15 based on the phase diagram of fese , and the @xmath4 of our polycrystalline sample was 9.4 k  ( zero resistivity ) and 12.5 k ( onset ) .",
    "in addition , epma revealed a fe : se composition ratio of 1:1  ( @xmath20.02 ) .",
    "as like high @xmath4 cuprate , pseudogap behaviors appeared in the iron based superconductor 1111 system . recently , photoemission spectroscopy(pes ) of the normal state of fese revealed pseudogap - like behaviors .",
    "@xcite .",
    "this paper reports that the fese superconductor exhibits pseudogap - like behavior near 110 k through an analysis of the resistivity using the resistivity curvature mapping ( rcm ) for high @xmath4 cuprates  @xcite , the result of seebeck coefficient measurement , and an analysis of the resistivity under applied magnetic field .",
    "moreover , we report the data of critical current density of fese polycrystalline .",
    "( color online ) x - ray diffraction patterns of the as - grown , 900 @xmath18c , and 400 @xmath18c annealed fese sample .",
    "the patterns show that the sample is composed of tetragonal fese ( @xmath19 ) , with some hexagonal @xmath20-fese and fe - phase as impurities .",
    "after annealing , the fe - phase disappeared .",
    "as shown in the inset , the normalized resistivity of 400 @xmath18c annealed sample is consistent with that of 900 @xmath18c for full temperature range . ]",
    "polycrystalline samples with a nominal composition of fe : se=1:1.5 were prepared with fe powder ( 99.9@xmath21 ) and se grains ( 99.999@xmath21 ) .",
    "about 6.5 g of a stoichiometric quantity was loaded into a small carbon crucible , which was then placed into a mo crucible to avoid a reaction between fe and mo .",
    "the cap covering the mo crucible was welded by an arc welder filled ar gas to prevent the escape of volatile se .",
    "this arc - welded mo crucible was heated up to 1200 @xmath22c for 8 hours and held at that temperature for 122 hours in a self - fabricated vacuum furnace with tungsten mesh heater(vftmh ) .",
    "the mo crucible was come down slowly from the heat source of the furnace at 1.5 mm / hour .",
    "the obtained sample ( as - grown sample ) was polycrystalline with large grain boundaries including a small amount of a secondary phase .",
    "the as - grown sample was then sealed into a small quartz tube under vacuum and annealed at 900 @xmath22c for 3 days .",
    "powder xrd measurements of the as - grown and annealed sample were carried out using a x - ray diffractometer ( rigaku 12k ) with cu - k@xmath23 radiation from 2@xmath24@xmath2510@xmath26 to 70@xmath26 at a scanning rate of 0.02@xmath26 per second .",
    "the resistivity measurements were carried out in a quantum design ppms system using the standard four - probe method from 4 k to room temperature at zero field , and from 4 to 200 k under a magnetic field of 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 , and 9 t. a quantum design mpms was used to measure the temperature dependence of magnetization @xmath27 at @xmath28=50 oe , and the magnetic field dependence of magnetization @xmath29 from -70 to 70 koe .",
    "the seebeck coefficient  ( thermoelectric  power ) was measured from 4 to 300 k under no magnetic field .",
    "1 shows the x - ray diffraction pattern for as - grown sample , and the samples annealed at 900 @xmath18c and 400 @xmath18c .",
    "all the peaks were well indexed using the @xmath19 space group from a rietveld refinement . the calculated lattice constants were @xmath30= 3.7788 and @xmath31=5.5310 @xmath32 .",
    "fe - phase and hexagonal @xmath20-fese were observed a bit in the as - grown sample .",
    "after annealing , the fe - phase disappeared but @xmath20-fese remained as a secondary phase .",
    "most recent studies annealed their samples at between 300@xmath15450 @xmath18c based on ref .",
    "therefore , the samples in this study were annealed at 400 @xmath18c for 3  days . as shown fig.1 , the xrd patterns of the samples annealed at 400 @xmath18c and 900 @xmath18cwere identical .",
    "the normalized resistivity of sample annealed at 400 @xmath18c is consistent with that at 900 @xmath18c for full temperature ranges as shown the inset in fig.1 .",
    "hence , it implies that annealing temperature does not have sensitive effect on the @xmath4 and resistivity , unlike that reported in ref .",

    "the left inset shows the resistivity measurements in magnetic fields of 0 , 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 , and 9 t. the right inset shows the temperature dependence of the upper critical field @xmath33 for @xmath34 , @xmath35 , and @xmath36 . ]",
    "2 shows the temperature dependence of the resistivity of the annealed sample at 900@xmath18c from 4 k to room temperature .",
    "the resistivity began to decrease abruptly at @xmath34=12.5 k due to superconductivity , and dropped to zero at @xmath0=9.4 k. the @xmath0 of our sample was @xmath151 k higher than the 8@xmath158.5 k reported previously .",
    "the ratio of room temperature to residual resistivity ( rrr ) was approximately 9.25 .",
    "furthermore , normal state residual resistivity value and resistivity value at 300 k are smaller than those of other polycrystallines  @xcite .",
    "these values are similar to recently reported data for single crystal fese  @xcite .",
    "therefore , our polycrystalline sample is of good quality .",
    "the left inset in fig .",
    "2 shows the resistivity under a range of magnetic fields . with increasing magnetic field , the superconducting transitions shifted monotonously to lower temperatures .",
    "the right inset in fig .",
    "2 shows that the upper critical fields @xmath37 estimated using the werthamer - helfand - hohenberg ( whh ) formula @xmath37=-0.693@xmath38@xmath39@xmath40 for @xmath36 ( = @xmath41 , @xmath42 is the normal state resistivity value ) , @xmath35 ( = @xmath43 ) , and @xmath34 ( = @xmath44 ) are 19.6 , 23.4 , and 30.2 t. these values are rather large considering that @xmath4 of fese occur at a low temperature .",
    "the coherence length @xmath45=3.3 nm was also estimated by using the ginzberg landau formula @xmath33=@xmath46 , and was similar to that of a single crystal  @xcite .",
    "( color online ) ( a ) in the graphs of resistivity , @xmath47 and @xmath48 all curves showed anomaly near 110 k , i.e. characteristic temperature of a pseudogap @xmath8 .",
    "the sign of @xmath48 changes twice at @xmath8=110 k and 30 k. ( b ) temperature dependence of @xmath9 of fese under magnetic field .",
    "increments of all curves on zero field resistivity increased below 100 k with decreasing temperature and increasing applied magnetic field .",
    "this provide evidence of an opening pseudogap near 100 k . ]    the resistivity curve of fig .",
    "2 showed a slight s shape above @xmath4 and an inflection point near 110 k. this behavior is similar to that reported previously for a structural phase transition near 100 k for fese compounds  @xcite .",
    "the s shape of the resistivity curve is quite interesting because it was reported that an underdoped material of high @xmath4 superconducting cuprates displays this shape in @xmath5  @xcite .",
    "ando @xmath49 @xmath50 reported that the sign of @xmath7 changes from positive to negative at the characteristic temperature of a pseudogap @xmath8 for high @xmath4 cuprates  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath7 and @xmath6 of our sample shown in fig .",
    "3(a ) revealed that the all curves are similar to the results of resistivity curvature mapping ( rcm ) reported by ando @xmath49",
    "@xmath51  @xcite .",
    "as shown fig 3.(a ) , signs of all @xmath7 changed from negative to positive near 110 k. it is different from ando _ et al .",
    "_ , that the sign of @xmath7 changes again to a positive sign near 30 k. this anomalous behavior is similar to the results of the seebeck coefficient mentioned below .",
    "more experimental and theoretical studies will be needed to make out the origin of this behavior near 30 k. fig .",
    "3(b ) shows the temperature dependence of @xmath9 from 4 to 200 k under a magnetic field of 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 , and 9 t. as shown in fig .",
    "3(b ) , the increments of all curves on zero field resistivity increased below 100 k with decreasing temperature and increasing applied magnetic field  ( maximum increment about 7 percent in 9 t above @xmath4 ) .",
    "this temperature is similar to the analysis of the rcm method above and the enhancement of the antiferromagnetic spin fluctuation in the nmr experiment  @xcite .",
    "temperature dependence of the seebeck coefficient of fese .",
    "the sign of the seebeck coefficient of fese changes at approximately 200 k , and in the slope changes around 115 k. as shown the inset , the sign of s changed again near 30 k. ]    fig .",
    "4 shows the seebeck coefficient measurements from 4 k to room temperature for fese .",
    "@xmath10 is small and positive at room temperature .",
    "it then changes sign near 200 k  @xcite , and passes through a negative maximum near 115 k , almost corresponding to the inflection temperature of the resistivity .",
    "the change in sign implies that electrons and holes make an almost equal contribution to the conduction , as in a two carriers material  @xcite .",
    "another interesting anomaly is that the sign of @xmath10 changes again to positive near 30 k , which is consistent with the sign change of @xmath7 near 30 k. there are no reports of a change in the sign of the seebeck coefficient at low temperatures above the @xmath4 .",
    "it is believed that this behavior is strongly associated with the mechanism of superconductivity .    however , it is unclear why the slope of the seebeck coefficient changes near @xmath8 , in a similar manner to that observed with the resistivity .",
    "previous reports of other materials suggest that the decrease in @xmath39@xmath10@xmath39 above @xmath8 is due to an increasing number of thermally excited carriers across the pseudogap  @xcite .",
    "in addition , the results of several experiments for iron based superconductors appear to suggest pseudogap - like behavior  @xcite .",
    "( color online ) temperature dependence of the magnetization of fese measured in a 50 oe . in zero field",
    "cool ( zfc ) , the magnetic onset of superconductivity appears at 9.4 k , which is the same as the zero resistance temperature . ]",
    "5 shows the temperature dependence of magnetization on zero - field cooling ( zfc ) and field cooling ( fc ) .",
    "the inset in fig .",
    "5 shows an enlargement of the low temperature range .",
    "a superconducting transition was observed at @xmath1=9.4 k in zfc , which is the same as the @xmath4 shown in fig .",
    "2 . there was no magnetic anomaly from above @xmath4 to 300 k , which is similar to previous reports for a stoichiometric fese sample with a composition ratio fe : se=1:1 .",
    "the magnetization hysteresis loop in the inset of fig .",
    "6 shows a several isothermal @xmath52-@xmath28 curves at 2@xmath159 k , which are eliminated ferromagnetic elements due to a secondary phase .",
    "the critical current density @xmath53 can be obtained from the @xmath52-@xmath28 loop using the bean model . according to the bean model , @xmath53",
    "is given by @xmath53=20@xmath54 $ ] , where @xmath55 is @xmath56-@xmath57 , @xmath57 and @xmath56 are the magnetization on the sweeping fields up and down respectively , and @xmath58 and @xmath59 are the sample widths(@xmath60 ) .",
    "6 shows the critical current density @xmath53 at several temperatures as a function of the field , and the critical current density calculated from the @xmath52-@xmath28 curves were estimated to be @xmath61@xmath15@xmath62 a/@xmath63 at zero field . as shown fig .",
    "6 , the critical current densities is @xmath15 10@xmath64 - 10@xmath65 a/@xmath63 uniformly up to 300 oe in low temperature .",
    "the small value of @xmath53 in fese which is considerably smaller than those @xmath66@xmath15@xmath67 a/@xmath63 of other iron - based superconductor samples  @xcite imply that our sample is good qualitative with few impurity .",
    "this difference might be due to the large grain boundaries of the sample .",
    "in addition , that may be ascribe to the low carrier and undoped compound .",
    "( color online ) ( a ) a typical superconducting magnetic hysteresis curve could be obtained by subtracting the @xmath52-@xmath28 curve at 11 k from that at temperatures below @xmath4 .",
    "( b ) the diagram shows field dependence of the calculated critical current density for the temperature from the bean s model .",
    "@xmath68 was estimated to be @xmath61@xmath15@xmath62 a/@xmath63 . ]",
    "a stoichiometric fese superconductor was synthesized with @xmath0=9.4 k under a se self - flux .",
    "the critical current density was measured to be @xmath53=@xmath61@xmath15@xmath62 a/@xmath63 from an analysis of the @xmath52-@xmath28 loops .",
    "the seebeck coefficient was 12.3 @xmath3v / k at room temperature , and the sign of @xmath10 changed near 200 k as a two carriers material . in the resistivity measurements , the s shape of the @xmath5 curve , @xmath69 , and @xmath70 exhibited pseudogap - like behavior at @xmath8=110 k by using the rcm method for high @xmath4 cuprates .",
