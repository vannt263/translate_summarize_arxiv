    "recent observational achievements in spectroscopy of galaxies in the very early universe @xcite have enabled us to study starburst galaxies whose star formation rates are very high .",
    "since these galaxies are at @xmath1 , we can observe their ultraviolet continua and ly@xmath0 in the optical band , which can be covered by ground - based large telescopes .",
    "furthermore , ly@xmath0 is one of the most conspicuous emission lines , and the investigation of the ly@xmath0 line transfer becomes important in understanding the physical nature of these galaxies .",
    "the ly@xmath0 profiles of many starburst galaxies in the early universe are categorized into three types : symmetric ly@xmath0 emission , asymmetric or p - cygni type one , and broad absorption in damping wings @xcite . moreover",
    ", local starburst galaxies also show similar characteristics @xcite .",
    "the p - cygni type ly@xmath0 is believed to originate from the expanding neutral medium surrounding the ly@xmath0 source , which is supported by the existence of the low ionization interstellar absorption lines blueshifted relative to the line - center @xcite .",
    "the voigt profile fittings for the broad absorption lines extending to the lorentzian wings and p - cygni type absorption lines revealed that their neutral hydrogen column density @xmath2 or the line - center optical depth @xmath3 .",
    "however , the voigt profile fitting is not satisfactory in the red part of ly@xmath0 emission which is thought to be contributed by back - scattered photons .",
    "this is exemplified by the ill - fitted red part of ly@xmath0 emission in the spectrum of haro 2 @xcite .",
    "no adequate computational method to describe the back - scattered photons has been developed so far .    in extremely thick media of hydrogen , where ly@xmath0 photons wander in both real space and frequency space",
    ", the line transfer can be described by the diffusion approximation . in the diffusion approximation",
    "we assume that only wing scatterings play a significant role in transferring ly@xmath0 photons in space .",
    "however , this approximation does not fully take into account the fact that the photons move back and forth between core and wing wavelength regimes during their transfer in an extremely thick medium . while being a core photon the scatterings are resonant and therefore local .",
    "wing scatterings are associated with significant spatial excursion .",
    "furthermore , the scattering phase functions for resonant scatterings associated with the @xmath4 transitions are different from that associated with wing scatterings which is idential with that of the classical rayleigh scattering .",
    "this fact should be considered in a very careful manner in computing the physical quantities such as the polarization and the angular distribution of the emergent radiation field .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate the ly@xmath0 line transfer in an extremely thick and static medium by using a monte carlo method .",
    "we will focus only on the dustless case in this work , even though the dusty case is more realistic .",
    "the effect of dust was briefly dealt by @xcite and more careful investigation is deferred .",
    "our assumption can be valid for the primeval objects that had not experienced any star - formation episode .",
    "this is the second paper in a series on the ly@xmath0 profile formation in starbursting galaxies . in the first paper",
    "@xcite we studied the ly@xmath0 transfer in moderately thick media .",
    "we use the monte carlo method , which is frequently adopted in the ly@xmath0 line transfer , because of its simplicity and flexibility .",
    "however , the monte carlo method becomes inefficient when the line - center optical depth @xmath5 of scattering medium is very large .",
    "we need to follow the scattering of each photon until the escape , and the number of scattering is proportional to @xmath5 for very thick case .",
    "this means that the number of computations grows in proportional to @xmath5 which could vary by several orders of magnitudes depending on the situation .",
    "our previous version of the code consumes unacceptably long computing time for extremely thick cases .",
    "we therefore extend our efforts to very large optical depth regime in this paper by developing the ` accelerating scheme ' .    this paper is composed as follows . in section 2",
    ", we describe our scheme to accelerate the monte carlo code . in section 3",
    "we show our results . in section 4",
    "we discuss possible applications of our code .",
    "the final section summarizes our major findings .",
    "since we are interested in the emergent ly@xmath0 profiles in various situations , we first introduce the dimensionless parameter @xmath6 defined by @xmath7 which describes the frequency shift from the line - center @xmath8 in units of the doppler shift @xmath9 . here",
    "@xmath10 is the thermal speed of the scattering medium , @xmath11 is the speed of light , and @xmath8 is the line - center frequency . + the medium considered in this study is a plane - parallel slab , which is uniformly filled with pure hydrogen atoms .",
    "the optical depth at the ly@xmath0 line - center from the center to both sides of the medium along the normal direction is @xmath5 .",
    "we consider two types of the source distribution : a source in the midplane , and sources uniformly distributed along the vertical line .",
    "we show the configuration considered in this study in figure  1 .",
    "the underlying ideas for these two cases is that the midplane source can model a giant h  ii region embedded in a neutral region while the uniformly distributed source can mimic the starbursting region which has young stars mixed with the partially ionized gas .",
    "these configurations are the same ones that have been considered in the previous works @xcite .",
    "+ there have been several monte carlo approaches to the resonance line transfer in an optically thick and static medium in the literature @xcite .",
    "the main advantages of monte carlo methods lie in the geometrical flexibility of scattering media and the simplicity in solving the radiative transfer problem , compared with the direct numerical integration of the basic radiative transfer equation .",
    "however , one severe limitation of the technique is that a large amount of computing time is required for the cases with extremely high optical depths . in order to handle the ly@xmath0 transfer for extremely large @xmath5 using currently available computers",
    ", we modified the prototypical monte carlo code developed in our previous papers @xcite .",
    "as was shown numerically in the previous papers @xcite and explained in accordance with @xcite , in extremely thick media , ly@xmath0 photons escape from the media by both frequency diffusion and spatial diffusion .",
    "when a ly@xmath0 photon is emitted with the line center frequency in an optically thick medium , then it experiences a large number of core scatterings . during the core scatterings ,",
    "the photon does not move much because the line - center opacity is very large . during a series of a large number of core scatterings",
    ", the ly@xmath0 photon can be scattered by a rapidly moving atom in the tail of the maxwell - boltzmann velocity distribution .",
    "once the photon is scattered by such an atom , its frequency changes abruptly and it becomes a wing photon . for a wing photon ,",
    "the hydrogen medium becomes more transparent and the photon traverses a longer distance . in a moderately thick medium with @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the voigt parameter , ly@xmath0 photons escape from the medium during at most a few wing scatterings ; but in extremely thick media with @xmath14 , the wing photon can not escape and have to experience a number of continuous wing scatterings , whose number is approximately given by @xmath15 assuming random walk approximation @xcite . here",
    "@xmath16 is the frequency at the peaks of profiles .    during such wing scatterings",
    "some photons become core photons again by the so called ` restoring force ' @xcite , and then these photons suffer a large number of successive core scatterings .",
    "one cycle of these processes is called ` an excursion ' @xcite , and the photon spatially transfers by the repetition of excursions before it eventually achieves its escape from the medium during the wing scatterings : this final step of escape is called ` single longest excursion ' .    considering these transfer processes , we can see that the major consumption of time in the monte carlo code occurs in the step of the computation of the outgoing wavevector associated with resonant or core scatterings , whose number of successive core scattering is order of @xmath17 . therefore , the computing time can be significantly saved if we simplify this step in a clever way .",
    "our code was developed to distinguish the resonant core scattering from the non - resonant wing scattering .",
    "thus , in order to save the computing time , whenever the photon experiences a resonant scattering during its transfer , we can skip following successive resonant scatterings and to describe the next scattering by a fast moving hydrogen atom .",
    "we now explain the skipping procedure in detail .",
    "the main idea for the procedure is to assume that any photons with @xmath18 suffer a large number of core scatterings locally and finally emerges from the local scattering region with frequency shift @xmath19 after a scattering with a rapidly moving atom , where @xmath20 is the critical frequency shift which defines the borderline between core and wing photons . in the accelerating scheme ,",
    "we just skip the core scatterings and assigns @xmath21 in an appropriate way .",
    "for the lorentzian profile of ly@xmath0 scattering , @xmath20 can be safely set to @xmath22 for moderately thick media with @xmath23 , and to @xmath24 for extremely thick media with @xmath25 .",
    "here we obtain @xmath26 from the eq .",
    "( 10 ) by substituting the effective wing optical depth @xmath27 .",
    "we find that the slightly larger @xmath20 can be permitted for even larger @xmath5 .    in order to describe the scattering by a fast moving atom , we select the velocity ( @xmath28 ) of the scattering atom from the volcano - type thermal velocity distribution @xcite @xmath29 where @xmath30 , rather than from a simple gaussian distribution . here",
    "@xmath31 is safely set to be as large as @xmath32 .",
    "we call this method ` the accelerating scheme ' .",
    "we note that this method is valid for @xmath33 only when @xmath34 , which is tantamount to restoring the original code .      in this subsection",
    ", we provide the details of the angular redistribution and polarization of the scattered radiation .",
    "our code treats the scattering of ly@xmath0 photons in a manner very faithful to the atomic physics associated with the fine structure of hydrogen .",
    "the level splitting of @xmath35 , the excited state of ly@xmath0 transition , is @xmath36 , which amounts to the doppler width of @xmath37 . because this is much smaller than the thermal speed in a medium with @xmath38 , one normally neglect the @xmath35 level splitting , treating it as a single level .",
    "however , even though @xmath39 , the level splitting can be negligible when the medium has a large optical thickness .    as is described in @xcite , in our monte carlo code we compute the probability that the given photon is resonantly scattered with one of the two levels @xmath40 and the probability that the scattering occurs in the damping wings at each scattering event .",
    "we adopt the density matrix formalism to describe the angular distribution and polarization of the scattered ly@xmath0 , where the density operator is represented by a @xmath41 hermitian matrix . the density matrix element associated with the scattered photon @xmath42",
    "is related with that of the incident photon @xmath43 by @xmath44 here , the matrix elements due to other @xmath45 terms are neglected , and the radial part of the matrix elements @xmath46 is treated as a constant .",
    "the relevant clebsch - gordan coefficients are found in @xcite .    as is shown by @xcite , scattering of ly@xmath0 in the damping wings",
    "is characterized by the classical rayleigh scattering phase function due to the quantum interference between the two levels @xmath47 . in this case",
    ", one can show that the ly@xmath0 scattering in the wings can be regarded as a resonance scattering between two levels with @xmath48 and @xmath49 as far as the scattering phase function is concerned .",
    "the computation of the matrix elements in this case is straightforward and the result is @xmath50 where the incident radiation is characterized by the wavevector @xmath51 and the outgoing wavevector @xmath52 is correspondingly given with angles @xmath53 and @xmath54 with @xmath55 . here , we assume that the circular polarization is always zero due to the azimuthal symmetry in the scattering geometry and initial condition .    in the case of resonance scattering between @xmath56 and @xmath57 levels , a straightforward calculation shows that the density matrix elements associated with the outgoing photons are given by @xmath58 \\rho_{22 }          -6\\cos\\theta\\sin2\\delta\\phi \\rho_{12 } \\nonumber \\\\ % % \\rho'_{12 } & = & 3\\sin2\\delta\\phi\\cos\\theta ' \\rho_{11 }            + 6(\\cos\\theta\\cos\\theta'\\cos2\\delta\\phi+\\sin\\theta\\sin\\theta '            \\cos\\delta\\phi ) \\rho_{12 } \\nonumber \\\\ & &         + 3\\cos\\theta(-2\\sin\\theta\\sin\\theta'\\sin\\delta\\phi-            \\cos\\theta\\cos\\theta'\\sin2\\delta\\phi ) \\rho_{22 } \\nonumber \\\\ % % \\rho'_{22 } & = & [ ( 5 - 3\\cos2\\delta\\phi)\\cos^2\\theta'+2\\sin^2\\theta ' ) \\rho_{11 }               \\nonumber \\\\ & &             + [ ( 5 + 3\\cos2\\delta\\phi)\\cos^2\\theta\\cos^2\\theta'+                2\\cos^2\\theta\\sin^2\\theta ' \\nonumber \\\\ & &             + 12\\cos\\delta\\phi \\cos\\theta '                \\cos\\theta\\sin\\theta\\sin\\theta'+2\\cos^2\\theta'\\sin^2\\theta                + 8\\sin^2\\theta\\sin^2\\theta ' ] \\rho_{22 } \\nonumber\\\\ & &             + ( 6\\sin2\\delta\\phi\\cos\\theta\\cos^2\\theta'+                2\\sin\\delta\\phi\\cos\\theta'\\sin\\theta\\sin\\theta')\\rho_{12}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    when the scattering is resonant with the level @xmath59 , then the scattered radiation is characterized with the isotropic angular distribution and hence completely unpolarized . therefore , the density matrix is constant and @xmath60 times the identiy matrix irrespective of the incident and outgoing wavevectors .",
    "the density matrix elements associated with the outgoing photon given in eqs .",
    "( 3 - 5 ) are normalized by the unit trace condition .",
    "it is readily verified that a @xmath61 scattering of a completely unpolarized incident photon yields 100 percent polarization in the case of a wing scattering and the degree of polarization in the case of a resonant scattering between @xmath62 becomes @xmath63 ( e.g. @xcite ) .",

    "we note that these are transformed respectively into @xmath93 , @xmath94 , and @xmath95 .",
    "our results are shown in figure  3a and figure  3b .",

    "we see that it also shows deviation from the analytic solution derived by @xcite , which is expected due to the invalidity of diffusion approximation for @xmath97 .",
    "we conclude that our accelerating scheme is valid for the various range of optical depths .",
    "next , we perform monte carlo calculations for hotter media , whose voigt parameter is given by @xmath98 corresponding to @xmath99 .",

    "the solid lines represent the results of our monte carlo calculations , and the dotted lines do analytic solutions .",
    "we see that our numerical results are in very good agreement with analytic solutions for very thick media ( @xmath107 ) . in extremely thick media",
    ", we can safely assume that only wing scatterings contribute to the spatial transfer of ly@xmath0 photons , and so our accelerated code can describe the line transfer process very well .",
    "third , we also perform calculations for sources uniformly distributed along the vertical direction of the slab .",
    "the relevant application for this case can be found in the giant h  ii region , where the ly@xmath0 sources and the scattering media may be mixed together .",
    "we assume that the typical temperature of h  ii region is @xmath108 , and that the size of h  ii region is @xmath109 scale . in this environment",
    "the degree of ionization can lead to the volume density of neutral hydrogen @xmath110 .",
    "hence the total column density of the h  ii region can be @xmath111 , which corresponds to the line - center optical depth of @xmath112 . in the code",
    ", we generate the sources at the location @xmath113 , where @xmath114 and @xmath115 is the uniform random number having range of @xmath116 $ ] .",
    "when photon sources are located near the surface , the optical depth toward the nearest boundary is much less than that toward the midplane of the slab .",
    "hence , we adjust the core - wing boundary frequency ( @xmath20 ) in accordance with the vertical location of photon sources which is denoted by @xmath117 : we used @xmath118 , where @xmath119 is a core - wing boundary frequency in units of thermal velocity for midplane sources .",
    "this formula gives correct behaviors for both thin and thick cases .",
    "clearly @xmath71 as @xmath120 .    in figure  5",
    "we show our results only for the extremely thick cases with @xmath121 and @xmath98 .",
    "we note that the results for the moderately thick cases can be found in the previous paper @xcite .",
    "our results ( solid lines ) are compared with the analytic solutions ( dashed lines ) . from the analytic solutions for the case of midplane source @xcite",
    ", we obtain the analytic solutions for the case of distributed sources by convolving the midplane solution , eq .",
    "( 7 ) , with the uniform source positions ( @xmath122 ) , @xmath123    in the figure we can see that our numerical results agree very well with the analytic ones , and that the peaks are more shifted to the line - center compared to the midplane cases .",
    "this is because the sources near the surface contribute to the central part of emergent profiles .",
    "@xcite argued that in extremely thick media with @xmath25 , the emergent flux depends on the product @xmath79 , not on the individual parameters .",
    "this is evidently seen in eq .",
    "( 7 ) , in which @xmath124 is dependent upon @xmath79 . in order to check this fact , we perform monte carlo calculations for a few pairs of @xmath13 and @xmath5 with common @xmath79 values . for @xmath125 ( or @xmath126 )",
    ", we perform calculations for two pairs ; ( @xmath98 , @xmath127 ) and ( @xmath128 , @xmath129 ) . for @xmath130 ( or @xmath126 ) , we choose ( @xmath98 , @xmath131 ) and ( @xmath128 , @xmath132 ) .",
    "the other pair is ( @xmath98 , @xmath133 ) and ( @xmath128 , @xmath127 ) , which have @xmath134 .",
    "our results are shown in figure  6 , where we see that , for the extremely thick cases @xmath135 , the line profiles for each pair with the same @xmath79 agree very well with each other .",
    "thus we confirm that our code reproduces the results in @xcite very well .",
    "finally , we also consider the radiative transfer of continuum photons near ly@xmath0 .",
    "we simply assume that an input spectrum is flat . in figure 7",
    "we show our results for @xmath136 fixing @xmath81 , where symmetric double peaks and one absorption trough at the line - center are seen .",
    "the absorption trough broadens as @xmath5 gets larger .",
    "we show the wavelength ( @xmath137 ) in units of @xmath138 on the top edge of the figure , which is scaled by @xmath139 . here",
    "@xmath86 is the temperature of the scattering medium .",
    "note again that the spectra are symmetric relative to the line - center .      in this subsection",
    "we consider the directionality of emergent ly@xmath0 photons . in the monte carlo code",
    "we collect emerging photons with the directional information into the equally spaced bins in @xmath140 where @xmath141 is the angle between the normal direction of the slab and the wavevector of the photons . since the number of photons along @xmath142 is proportional to @xmath143 , where @xmath144 is the solid angle",
    ", we obtain the intensity @xmath145 by dividing the number of photons by @xmath142 .",
    "we call the function @xmath145 the ` directionality ' . this definition of directionality is different from that used by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter pm86 ) , who defined it as the intensity normalized with respect to the intensity normal to the slab .",
    "the results are shown in figure  8 .",
    "the curves for @xmath146 are nearly isotropic , because most ly@xmath0 photons escape from the medium by single longest flights : each ly@xmath0 photon is scattered locally near the source and becames a wing photon by frequency diffusion , when the medium gets transparent .",
    "therefore , a large number of local scatterings isotropize the radiation field , which is characterized by no or ( at least a negligible ) polarization .    as @xmath147 , the directionality gradually converges to that of the thomson - scattered radiation emergent from a thomson - thick electron medium represented by the thick solid line .",
    "this thomson limit was obtained by @xcite and was confirmed numerically by pm86 .",
    "pm86 also provided the results for optically thin as well as optically thick cases .",
    "therefore , we compare our results with those from the radiative transfer in a pure electron scattering medium , because thomson scattering shares the same rayleigh phase function as ly@xmath0 wing scattering .",
    "it is convenient to consider the effective wing optical depth , @xmath148 , which is the optical depth at the effective frequency of emergent photons , @xmath16 . from eq .",
    "( 6 ) we can see that @xmath149 we compare this optical depth with the optical depth for the thomson scattering defined by @xmath150 , where @xmath151 is the thomson scattering cross section , and @xmath152 is the electron column density .",
    "when @xmath79 is small , after a large number of local resonant scatterings , a ly@xmath0 photon becomes a wing photons due to the scattering with a fast moving hydrogen atom .",
    "now , for this wing photon the slab is a transparent medium , especially along the normal direction and escape to this direction occurs without subsequent scatterings .",
    "however , to the grazing direction , because of simple geometrical considerations , there can be a significant probability of further wing scatterings before escape .",
    "therefore , the situation becomes quite similar to the electron scattering in a plane - parallel slab that is quite thin and illuminated from the other side .",
    "limb brightening is a natural consequence because we see more sources in the grazing direction , as is shown in figure  8 .",
    "for the extremely thick cases with @xmath25 , the effective wing optical depth is estimated to be @xmath153 by eq .",
    "this corresponds to the result of the thomson scattered radiation in an electron cloud with its optical depth @xmath154 .",
    "this limiting behavior of the directionality may be summarized as @xmath155 which is an approximate relation proposed by pm86 for the numerical solution introduced in the table xxiv of @xcite .",
    "this is shown by a thick solid line in figure  8 .",
    "we see that the directionality of ly@xmath0 , being transferred in an extremely thick hydrogen medium , converges to that for the case of optically thick electron cloud . in this optical depth",
    "regime , the optical depth for ly@xmath0 wing photons becomes large , and the photons spatially transfer in the medium by random walks .",
    "hence , the escape of photons occurs preferentially to the normal to the slab , where the opacity is relatively small .",
    "we regard this phenomenon as a limb darkening , which was also called a ` beaming ' by pm86 .    in an extremely thick medium , ly@xmath0 photons experience a number of successive wing scatterings just before their escape from the medium during their single longest excursion .",
    "how many times do the photons experience the successive wing scatterings just before escape ? according to @xcite , in an extremely thick medium with an isotropic ly@xmath0 source located at the midplane , photons acquire a typical frequency shift @xmath156 during excursions ( see also section 2 of this paper ) . in an extremely thick medium ,",
    "the spatial transfer of ly@xmath0 photons occurs during a series of wing scatterings , and so we can approximate the spatial transfer by random walks . thus from eq .",
    "( 10 ) we can estimate the mean number of successive wing scatterings just before escape ( @xmath157 ) by @xmath158 or @xmath159    in the accelerated monte carlo calculations we count the number of wing scatterings just before escape , and compare the result with the above relationship . in the upper panel of figure  9 we show the spectral distribution of the number of wing scatterings just before escape .",
    "we can see that the photons emerging with larger frequency shift have been experienced more wing scatterings just before escape than those with smaller frequency shift .    in order to check the relationship of eq .",
    "( 13 ) , we show in figure  10 the graph of @xmath160 vs. @xmath161 , where @xmath162 is the value averaged over frequency , and @xmath79 represents the importance of wing scatterings in ly@xmath0 line transfer . here the number of photons for each point is 4000 , and the error in @xmath163 is the flux weighted poisson error .",
    "the least square fitting gives us the following relationship , @xmath164 we see that the power and the coefficient in eqs .",
    "( 13 ) and eq .",
    "( 14 ) are in good agreement with each other .",
    "we have investigated the ly@xmath0 line transfer in extremely thick , dustless , uniform , and static media . in order to reduce the calculation speed , we developed an accelerating scheme for our previous monte carlo code , in which we skip an extremely large number of core scatterings that may occur during the line transfer .",
    "the code also deals with the angular redistribution accurately by using the density matrix formalism where the phase functions calculated in a manner faithful to the atomic physics .",
    "the modified code passes the requirement in both efficiency and accuracy when calculating the ly@xmath0 line profiles emergent from extremely thick media .",
    "we checked that the line profile is dependent only upon @xmath79 , which was argued by @xcite . with the code",
    "we obtained solutions for both the midplane source and the uniformly distributed sources , both of which show excellent agreement with the analytic solutions derived by @xcite . in the latter case ,",
    "the peaks tend to shift toward the line - center due to the sources located near the slab surface .",
    "we also presented our results on the radiative transfer of continuum photons near ly@xmath0 , and the emergent spectra show the double peaks and the broad absorption at the line - center .",
    "however , it is natural to think that dust extinction will destroy a significant fraction of photons forming the double peaks , and eventually a broad absorption trough will form .",
    "we also examined the directionality of emergent ly@xmath0 photons .",
    "when the medium is slightly thick with @xmath165 , we observe a limb brightening effect , because the slab becomes transparent to wing photons . as @xmath79 increase",
    ", the directionality eventually converges to that of the thomson scattered radiation in a thick electron cloud which was investigated by @xcite .",
    "the limiting behavior of the curves is the beaming of ly@xmath0 photons into the direction normal to the slab . in short ,",
    "the ly@xmath0 emission from the star - forming regions that are surrounded by scattering neutral media shows the limb brightening when @xmath166 , and the limb darkening when @xmath14 .",
    "these facts can be physically explained , since both the ly@xmath0 scattering by neutral hydrogen at wings and the thomson scattering in an electron cloud have the same rayleigh phase function .",
    "we also counted the mean number of successive wing scatterings just before escape , which is denoted by @xmath162 , and by monte carlo calculations we confirmed the relationship @xmath167 , which is derived from the diffusion approximation .    in conclusion , it is important to consider the quantum mechanical properties of ly@xmath0 scatterings and the exact transfer processes , and our accelerated monte carlo code can afford those requirements as well as the computing time .",
    "our works can be applied to local and distant starburst galaxies .",
    "approximately half of their ly@xmath0 lines show broad absorption troughs in the lorentzian wings .",
    "these absorption troughs are believed to be formed by optically thick , static h  i media with some amount of dust .",
    "however , the media in this study have been assumed to be dustless , which is unrealistic for almost all situations .",
    "hence , we will take dust effects into account in the future works .",
    "moreover , the emergent profiles are also influenced by the physical quantities such as porosity of dust and homogeneity of the medium as well as dust abundance and h  i column density , so that we are now undertaking investigations about the effects of these components on the line formation .",
    "another half of the starburst galaxies , either nearby or remote , show p - cygni type ly@xmath0 emission .",
    "as @xcite suggested , expanding media around the star - forming regions play an important role in avoiding the destruction of ly@xmath0 photons by dust and forming the p - cygni type ly@xmath0 profiles .",
    "when we calculated the ly@xmath0 line formation in an expanding medium , it is difficult to deal with the back - scattered photons .",
    "we have been investigating this topic by applying the formailsm developed in this paper , and the results will be reported in another paper .    in conclusion ,",
    "ly@xmath0 from starburst galaxies bears important and useful information on the physical environment of those systems including the kinematics , h  i column density , abundance and porosity of dust in the surrounding media of the star - forming regions in those galaxies .",
    "being very luminous in addition to being sensitive to many physical quantities , ly@xmath0 can be easily observed by using the modern observational technology .",
