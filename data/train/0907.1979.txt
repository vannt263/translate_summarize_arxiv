    "experimental evidence has confirmed that flavour transitions are the solution to the former so - called solar and atmospheric neutrino deficit problems@xcite .",
    "further evidence was provided by experiments performed with neutrinos generated in particle accelerators and nuclear reactors , such as kamland@xcite and k2k@xcite .",
    "the mechanism responsible for these transitions requires neutrinos to be massive : the probability of a flavour transition is oscillatory , with oscillation length @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the neutrino energy and @xmath3 is the difference of the squared masses of the different neutrino mass eigenstates .",
    "however , even though this mass - driven mechanism is the dominant one in the energy regimes that have been explored experimentally ( mev - tev ) , there is still the possibility that alternative mechanisms contribute to the flavour transitions in a subdominant manner , which perhaps can manifest at higher energies .",
    "although these alternative mechanisms involving new physics ( np ) are able to produce flavour transitions , it is known that none of them can explain the combined data from atmospheric , solar , accelerator , and reactor neutrino experiments performed in the mev - tev range , unlike the pure @xmath3 oscillation mechanism@xcite .",
    "some of these alternatives@xcite are the violation of the equivalence principle ( vep ) , of lorentz invariance@xcite ( vli ) , of cpt invariance ( vcpt ) , the non - universal coupling of neutrinos to a space - time torsion field ( nucq ) , decoherence during the neutrino s trip , and non - standard interactions ( nsi )",
    ".    typically , these mechanisms result in oscillation lengths @xmath4 that have a different dependence on @xmath2 , usually expressed as a power - law , @xmath5 , with the value of @xmath6 depending on which mechanism is being considered : for instance , @xmath7 for vcpt and nucq and @xmath8 for vep and vli , while with @xmath9 the standard @xmath3 oscillations are recovered . atmospheric events from super - kamiokande (",
    "sk)@xcite were used to find the value @xmath10 at @xmath11 c.l .",
    ", thus confirming the dominance of the @xmath3 oscillation mechanism and forcing any other mechanisms to be subdominant , at least within the energy range and pathlength considered in said analysis .",
    "so far , searches for np effects in neutrino oscillations have been limited to energies ranging from a few mev to a few gev@xcite and have turned out negative .",
    "however , proposals for analyses of atmospheric neutrinos with energies of up to @xmath12 tev in second - generation neutrino detectors such as icecube@xcite and antares@xcite are being considered . due to the energy dependence of the oscillation lengths , the oscillation phases scale as @xmath13 , that is",
    ", the relative dominance of the np contribution grows with the neutrino energy provided that @xmath14 , so that the observation of very energetic neutrinos -such as the ones expected from presumed cosmic accelerators like active galaxies and gamma ray bursts- would offer a means to establish whether the @xmath3 oscillation mechanism is still the dominant one at high energies or to otherwise set stronger bounds on the np parameters .    in this work ,",
    "we have introduced the aforementioned new physics through the use of a modified dispersion relation , and focused our analysis on the case of @xmath7 , corresponding , as we will see , to an energy - independent np contribution to the neutrino flavour oscillation phase .",
    "we have calculated the proportion of each flavour arriving at earth from distant cosmic accelerators and explored how it is affected by the parameters that control the new physics , and whether these effects are observable at all .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows .",
    "section [ section_modificationsqg ] describes how the np arising from a modified dispersion relation affects the flavour - transition probability for neutrinos that travel cosmological distances . in section [ section_observability ]",
    "we explore the case of an energy - independent np contribution and its effects on the flavour ratios . finally , in section [ section_conclusions ]",
    ", we present our conclusions .",
    "the np effects can modify flavour transitions in two ways@xcite : by transforming both the oscillation length and the neutrino mixing angles or by altering only the first .",
    "the former case occurs , for instance , when considering the low energy phenomenological model of string theory , known as standard model extension@xcite and has been examined using sk and k2k data@xcite .",
    "the second case can be achieved by considering a modified dispersion relation which departs from the well - known formula @xmath15 . because we wish to explore whether solely effects on the phase are observable at high energies , we follow this second alternative and consider the following modified dispersion relation@xcite , which allows us to study the contributions of np effects in a model - independent way : @xmath16 where @xmath17 gev is the planck mass",
    ", @xmath18 is an adimensional parameter that controls the strength of the np effects and , following the literature , @xmath19 has been chosen to be of integer value .",
    "such a dispersion relation assumes that the scale of np effects is the planck scale where , according to theories of quantum gravity , space - time might become `` foamy '' . eq .",
    "( [ moddisprel ] ) was recently@xcite used to predict the sensitivity of the antares neutrino telescope to np effects in the high - energy atmospheric neutrino flux .",
    "we now derive the flavour - transition probability in the presence of np effects , for neutrinos that propagate over a cosmological distance .",
    "flavour transitions arise as a consequence of the fact that flavour eigenstates @xmath20 ( @xmath21 ) are not also mass eigenstates @xmath22 ( @xmath23 ) , but rather a linear combination of them , i.e. @xmath24 , with @xmath25 elements of the neutrino mixing matrix .    using the standard dispersion relation ,",
    "it is a common procedure to derive an approximate expression for the momentum of the @xmath26-th neutrino mass eigenstate , @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the mass of the neutrino and @xmath2 is its energy , and are such that , at the energies that we have considered , @xmath29 . from this equation",
    "we obtain the usual expression for the momenta difference : @xmath30 in accordance with the latest bounds obtained from global fits@xcite , we have set the three mixing angles that parametrise @xmath31 to @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "the mass - squared differences have been set to @xmath35 and @xmath36 , and we have assumed a normal mass hierarchy ( i.e. @xmath37 ) , so that @xmath38 . the probability that a neutrino created with flavour @xmath19 is detected as having flavour @xmath39 after having propagated a distance @xmath40 in vacuum is given by@xcite @xmath41 where @xmath42 .",
    "since @xmath33 , @xmath31 is a real matrix , independent of the cp - violation phase , @xmath43 .    in the case of the modified dispersion relation of eq .  ( [ moddisprel ] )",
    "we can also find an expression for the momenta difference . to first order in @xmath44 , and discarding terms higher than second power in @xmath28 or involving @xmath45",
    ", we obtain @xmath46 with @xmath47 , and hence @xmath48 where @xmath49 , for the np mechanism with an @xmath50 energy dependence .",
    "note that it is necessary that the @xmath44 have different values for different mass eigenstates in order to have a nonzero np contribution to the momenta difference .",
    "the corresponding oscillation probability is eq .",
    "( [ probkayserstdb ] ) with @xmath51 ; hence , the np affects solely the oscillation phase , but not its amplitude .",
    "since @xmath52 for high - energy astrophysical neutrinos , @xmath53 is a rapidly oscillating function and so , due to the limited energy resolution of neutrino telescopes , the average flavour - transition probability is sometimes used instead , i.e. @xmath54    let @xmath55 be the standard average probability , that is , when there are no np effects present . if the extra term in @xmath56 has @xmath57 , its effect will be that , at high energies , @xmath58 will oscillate even more rapidly with energy , but still around the same mean value @xmath59 . if @xmath60 , the oscillations will continue up to high energies , also around the same mean , and at a high enough value , when @xmath61 , the probability will tend to zero . however , if @xmath7 , then the extra term in @xmath62 is energy - independent and so when @xmath63 , @xmath58 becomes constant , but different from zero due to the existence of the extra term .",
    "furthermore , when this happens , and depending on the values of the @xmath64 , it is in principle possible for the constant probability to be different from @xmath59 .",
    "such a nonzero , constant probability at high energies could therefore be interpreted as being due to the contribution from energy - independent new physics .",
    "we will focus on this possibility .    although our analysis of np effects using eq .",
    "( [ moddisprel ] ) is model - independent , @xmath65 takes a different form depending on the particular mechanism being considered@xcite . in the energy - independent oscillation mechanism that we are focusing on",
    ", the extra contribution could be due to vcpt through lorentz invariance violation , in which case @xmath66 with @xmath67 the eigenvalues of the lorentz - violating cpt - odd operator@xcite @xmath68 .",
    "alternatively , the contribution could be due to nucq , and in this case@xcite we would consider different couplings , @xmath69 ( for mass eigenstates @xmath26 and @xmath70 ) , to a torsion field @xmath71 , so that @xmath72 strict bounds@xcite have been set on the parameters that control the energy - independent np mechanism using data from atmospheric and solar neutrinos , as well as sk and k2k , with energies up to about 1 tev : @xmath73    because the relative dominance of the np energy - independent phase over the standard oscillation phase increases with neutrino energy , i.e. @xmath74 , we would like to look at the most energetic neutrinos available .",
    "hence , we will consider neutrinos originating at cosmic accelerators , such as active galactic nuclei , where it is presumed that they are created with energies of up to @xmath75 gev . because the typical distance to these accelerators is in the order of hundreds of mpc , we must include in the flavour - transition probability the effect of cosmological expansion .",
    "hence , instead of the argument that appears in the sine of eq .",
    "( [ probkayserstdb ] ) , we define an accumulated phase@xcite @xmath76 as follows : @xmath77 ~,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath78 and @xmath79 are the times at which the neutrino was produced and detected , respectively ; @xmath80 is the age of the universe@xcite ; and we have used the relation between the energy at detection ( @xmath81 ) and production epochs ( @xmath2 ) , in an adiabatically expanding universe , @xmath82 . considering the detection time @xmath83 in the present epoch , @xmath84 , we obtain the accumulated phase @xmath85}{e_{o}\\left[\\text{gev}\\right ] } \\left[1 - \\left(1 + z\\right)^{-5/2}\\right ] ~,\\ ] ] where we have made use of the relation @xmath86 .    by replacing the momenta difference @xmath87 with @xmath62",

    "( [ probkayserstdb ] ) for @xmath58 , we will employ @xmath91 where the explicit expression for @xmath92 is either of eqs .",
    "( [ phistd ] ) or ( [ phinp ] ) , depending on which dispersion relation is being considered , eq .",
    "( [ problun ] ) reduces to eq .",

    "using the flavour - transition probability obtained in the previous section , eq .",
    "( [ problun ] ) , we can calculate the ratio of neutrinos of each flavour to the total number of neutrinos that arrive at the detector from a source with redshift @xmath96 . for @xmath19-flavoured neutrinos ( @xmath21 ) with energy @xmath97 ,",
    "this is @xmath98 where @xmath99 is the ratio at the detector and @xmath100 is the ratio at the source .",
    "the latter is estimated assuming that neutrinos are secondaries of high - energy proton - proton or proton - photon collisions , which produce pions that decay into neutrinos and muons which decay into neutrinos too@xcite : @xmath101 it is easy to see that @xmath102 .",
    "( actually , @xmath103 _ are _ expected to be produced through the decay of @xmath104 charmed mesons generated also in @xmath105 and @xmath106 collisions .",

    "the @xmath108 are very rapidly oscillating functions of energy . taking into account the limited energy sensitivity of current and envisioned neutrino telescopes ( amanda - ii , for instance , had an energy resolution of @xmath109 in the logarithm of the energy of the @xmath110-spawned muon@xcite )",
    ", we see that they are sensitive not to the instantaneous value of the ratios , @xmath111 , but rather to the energy - averaged flavour ratios @xmath112 where @xmath113 , @xmath114 and @xmath115 , with @xmath116 a small energy displacement . without the np effects ,",
    "the high - energy neutrino flux from a distant astrophysical source is equally distributed among the three flavours , i.e. @xmath117 .    in the presence of np effects , however , the detected flavour ratios might be modified .",
    "given that the relative dominance of the energy - independent np phase @xmath118 over the standard phase @xmath76 grows with energy , i.e. @xmath119 , we would expect that any modifications became more pronounced in the uhe range , pev ",
    "eev , or higher . as explained in section [ section_modificationsqg ] , while the np phase remains constant in energy , the standard phase decreases and , as a consequence , beyond a certain threshold ( determined by the values of the @xmath120 ) , the detected ratios @xmath108 would acquire a constant nonzero value , which might differ from the standard ratios @xmath121 , thus providing a distinct phenomenological signature of a possible energy - independent contribution to the oscillation phase .    as a means of estimating the values of the @xmath120 for which the np phase starts to be of importance",

    "[ fignumuratioavg ] shows the predicted ratio calculated for different values of @xmath125 and @xmath126 ( we have assumed that @xmath135 ) as a function of @xmath81 .",
    "[ fignumuratioavg ] shows that @xmath136 indeed becomes constant and different from @xmath137 after a certain energy threshold .",
    "this occurs when the standard phase @xmath138 , so that , effectively , the oscillation phase is reduced to the energy - independent np contribution , i.e. @xmath139 , and the transition probabilities become constant .",
    "note , however , that @xmath136 is constant only for @xmath140 gev in the most promising case , that is , when the @xmath120 equal their current upper bounds .",
    "this is about five orders of magnitude higher than the energy of the most energetic neutrinos expected from cosmic accelerators . for smaller values of these parameters ,",
    "the energy at which the ratio becomes constant is even higher .",
    "using closer or more distant sources , effectively decreasing or increasing @xmath96 , does not affect the energy threshold , but only modifies the constant value reached by @xmath136 .",
    "therefore , we conclude that , given the current upper bounds on the @xmath120 , an energy - independent np contribution to neutrino oscillations would be visible in the high - energy astrophysical neutrino flux only if it modifies the oscillation amplitude ( i.e. the mixing angles ) , as well as the phase .    in light of this conclusion , within the formalism used in the present work , a comparative calculation , with and without np effects , of high - energy astrophysical neutrinos detected at a second - generation neutrino telescope such as",

    "we have considered the effect of a modified dispersion relation on the detected flavour ratios of high - energy neutrinos from cosmic accelerators . in the scenario of new physics that we have explored ,",
    "the flavour oscillation phases are modified by the addition of energy - independent terms which depend on the parameters @xmath120 .",
    "this contribution could correspond to a violation of cpt symmetry or to a nonuniversal neutrino coupling to a torsion field .",
    "the current upper bounds on the @xmath120 are strict : @xmath141 gev and @xmath142 gev .    at sufficiently high energies ,",
    "the oscillation phases are dominated by the energy - independent terms and the flavour ratios become constant and , possibly ( depending on the values of the @xmath120 ) different from the average value of the ratios in the standard oscillation case , when new physics effects are absent .",
    "we have found , however , that even in the best case , when the @xmath120 are set to their upper bounds , the ratios are constant only for energies above @xmath0 gev , about five orders of magnitude higher than the most energetic neutrinos that are expected from cosmic accelerators . lower values of the @xmath120 will only result in higher energy thresholds for the ratios to become constant .    therefore , we conclude that , even though there could be , in principle , a clear signature of the presence of energy - independent contributions to the neutrino flavour oscillations , these are not detectable in the flavour ratios of high - energy neutrinos from cosmic accelerators if they affect solely the oscillation phases .",
