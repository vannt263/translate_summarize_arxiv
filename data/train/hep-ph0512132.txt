    "the problem of why our universe is dominated by matter has been object of intense study in the last decades . in spite of satisfying _",
    " priori _ all the necessary conditions for the implementation of a successful baryogenesis mechanism , the standard model ( sm ) is unable to provide a plausible explanation for the observed baryon asymmetry of the universe ( bau ) . this , and other longstanding theoretical hints in favor of the existence of physics beyond the standard model , have been recently supported by one of the most exciting discoveries of modern particle physics namely , neutrino oscillations . apart from presenting us with the challenge of unraveling the pattern of neutrino masses and mixing",
    ", this discovery may also have a profound impact on our understanding of the universe .    among the various models proposed to explain why neutrinos are massive ( and much lighter than the other known fermions ) , the seesaw mechanism @xcite has become the most popular due its simplicity and versatileness .",
    "however , and in spite of all the attempts done in the direction of finding a way to test it , we are still far from unequivocally select the seesaw mechanism as the one behind neutrino mass generation . the most promising way of achieving this goal seems to be the investigation of physical phenomena capable of constraining the seesaw parameter space .",
    "a possible indirect test relies on the fact that the bau may have been generated through the out - of - equilibrium decays of the seesaw heavy neutrino states via the leptogenesis mechanism  @xcite .",
    "since both the low - energy neutrino mass and mixing pattern and the value of the bau depend on the fundamental seesaw parameters at very high scales , one expects that for example the amount of @xmath0 violation needed to generate a sufficient bau is in some sense related with the strength of low - energy @xmath0 violation in the leptonic sector .",
    "if this is the case , future neutrino oscillation experiments will be crucial to test leptogenesis in the seesaw framework . in this short review",
    "i will analyse some aspects related with the connection between neutrino physics and the thermal leptogenesis mechanism for the generation of the bau .",
    "the most economical framework over which the seesaw mechanism  @xcite can be realized corresponds to the sm extended with @xmath1 right - handed neutrino singlets @xmath2 . in the leptonic sector , the su(2 ) @xmath3 u(1 ) invariant yukawa and mass terms are : @xmath4 where @xmath5 and @xmath6 stand for the left - handed lepton doublets and right - handed charged - lepton singlets while @xmath7 denotes the usual sm lepton higgs doublet with @xmath8 . from now on",
    ", i will consider that the dirac neutrino yukawa coupling matrix @xmath9 is defined in the weak basis where the right - handed neutrino mass matrix @xmath10 and the charged lepton yukawa couplings @xmath11 are diagonal .",
    "the right - handed neutrino mass term is @xmath12 invariant and , as a result , the typical scale of @xmath10 can be much higher than the electroweak symmetry breaking scale @xmath13  gev , thus leading to naturally small left - handed majorana neutrino masses .",
    "the effective light neutrino mass matrix @xmath14 is given by the well - known seesaw formula @xmath15 where i have denoted the light neutrino masses by @xmath16 .",
    "the unitary matrix @xmath17 is the so - called pontecorvo - maki - nakagawa - sakata ( pmns ) leptonic mixing matrix which can be parameterized by three angles and three @xmath0-violating phases in the following way : @xmath18 here , @xmath19 are the leptonic mixing angles and @xmath20 a dirac - type @xmath0-violating phase .",
    "the unitary matrix @xmath21 is a ckm - like mixing matrix and can be written in the standard form as given for instance in ref .",
    "@xcite . since the light neutrinos are predicted to be majorana particles in the seesaw scenario , there are two extra majorana phases @xmath22 and @xmath23",
    ".    the structure of the effective neutrino mass matrix @xmath14 is dictated by @xmath24 and @xmath10 .",
    "although the relation between low and high energy parameters is well established by eq .",
    "( [ meff ] ) , it is straightforward to see that there is no one - to - one correspondence between both parameter spaces .",
    "therefore , even if all the entries of @xmath14 are measured , @xmath24 and @xmath10 can not be reconstructed . in the most natural scenario where the sm is extended with three heavy right - handed neutrino singlets",
    ", @xmath24 contains 15 parameters and @xmath10 is defined by the three heavy majorana neutrino masses @xmath25 . in total , there are 18 parameters to be confronted with the 9 ( 3 masses+3 mixing angles+3 phases ) of @xmath14 at low - energies .",
    "this ambiguity inherent to the seesaw mechanism can be illustrated taking into account that , for fixed @xmath17 , @xmath16 and @xmath25 , the relation @xmath26 where @xmath27 and @xmath28 , is always satisfied for  @xcite : @xmath29 since @xmath30 can be any orthogonal complex matrix it is clear that there is no univocal correspondence between the high and low - energy neutrino parameters .",
    "the meaning of @xmath30 can be suggestively interpreted in terms of the different roles played by the heavy neutrinos in the seesaw mechanism .",
    "in fact , @xmath30 can be viewed as a dominance matrix since it gives the weights of each heavy majorana neutrino in the determination of the different light neutrino masses @xmath16  @xcite .",
    "the fact that @xmath31 are weights for @xmath16 is quite obvious due to the orthogonality of @xmath30 : @xmath32 . on the other hand , the single contribution @xmath33 is also given by : @xmath34 therefore , once @xmath17 is settled , each weight @xmath31 just depends on @xmath35 and on its couplings with the left - handed neutrinos @xmath36 .",
    "consequently , the contribution of each heavy neutrino to @xmath16 is well defined and expressed by the weight @xmath37 . in this sense",
    ", one can say that the heavy majorana neutrino with mass @xmath35 dominates in @xmath16 if @xmath38 which leads to @xmath39 .",
    "so , if one of the heavy majorana neutrinos gives the dominant contribution to @xmath16 , this information is encoded in the structure of @xmath30 .    an alternative way to test the seesaw mechanism relies on the fact that in the supersymmetric seesaw new flavor violating effects appear due to the presence of the dirac type couplings between the heavy right - handed neutrinos and the ordinary sm lepton doublets  @xcite . in particular , even in the case where the supersymmetry breaking mechanism is flavor blind , new contributions are generated in lepton flavor violating rare decays like @xmath40  @xcite . however , in this case there is some intrinsic model dependence due to the fact that neither the high - energy neutrino flavor structure nor the true mechanism of supersymmetry breaking is known",
    ". nevertheless , future experimental data will be of extreme value in testing lepton flavor violation in a wide class of models like those based on grand unification .",
    "in alternative scenarios where , for instance , the seesaw @xmath41 is a heavy triplet , the results are more predictive since the amount of flavor violation induced by radiative corrections is directly related with the low - energy neutrino data  @xcite .",
    "the most recent wmap results and bbn analysis of the primordial deuterium abundance imply the following range  @xcite @xmath42 for the baryon - to - photon ratio of number densities .",
    "although satisfying the three necessary sakharov conditions for the generation of a baryon asymmetry , the sm is not able to justify the number given in ( [ bau ] ) . among the viable mechanisms to account for the matter - antimatter asymmetry observed in the universe ,",
    "leptogenesis  @xcite has undoubtedly become one of the most appealing ones .",
    "indeed , its simplicity and close connection with low - energy neutrino physics render it an attractive and eventually testable scenario asymmetries generated in the decays of heavy majorana neutrinos . for a discussion on alternative leptogenesis scenarios the reader",
    "is addressed to ref .",
    "@xcite . ] .",
    "the crucial ingredient in leptogenesis scenarios is the @xmath0 asymmetry generated through the interference between the tree - level and one - loop heavy majorana neutrino decay diagrams , depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] . for the decay of the heavy majorana neutrino @xmath43",
    ", the @xmath0 asymmetry can be expressed as  @xcite @xmath44}{(y_\\nu^\\dag y_\\nu)_{ii}}\\,\\frac{m_i}{m_j}\\left(\\mathcal{c}_{ij}^v+\\mathcal{c}_{ij}^s\\right),\\ ] ] where @xmath45 and @xmath46 denote the vertex and self - energy contributions , respectively .",

    "if the heavy majorana neutrino masses are such that @xmath51 only the decay of the lightest majorana neutrino @xmath52 is relevant for the lepton asymmetry .",
    "this is a reasonable assumption if the interactions of the lightest majorana neutrino @xmath52 are in thermal equilibrium at the time of the @xmath53 decays , so that the asymmetries produced by the heaviest neutrino decays are erased before the lightest one decays , or if @xmath53 are too heavy to be produced after inflation @xcite . in this case , @xmath54 reduces to @xmath55}{(y_\\nu^\\dag y_\\nu)_{ii}}\\,\\frac{m_1}{m_j}\\,.\\ ] ] as expected , in order to produce a lepton asymmetry , @xmath0 and lepton number must be violated by the interactions of the heavy majorana neutrinos .",
    "the out - of - equilibrium condition for the decay of @xmath52 is attained if @xmath56 , where @xmath57 is the hubble parameter evaluated at @xmath58 .",
    "it is instructive to define a decay parameter @xmath59 in such a way that the out - of - equilibrium condition is translated into @xmath60 .",
    "the produced lepton asymmetry @xmath61 is converted into a net baryon asymmetry @xmath62 through the @xmath63-violating sphaleron processes . by considering the interactions in thermal equilibrium in the thermal plasma and the correspondent balance between the chemical potentials of the different particle species",
    "one can obtain the following relation between the @xmath64 , @xmath65 and @xmath66 number - to - entropy density ratios  @xcite @xmath67 where @xmath68 and @xmath69 are the number of fermion families and complex higgs doublets , respectively .",
    "taking into account that @xmath70 and @xmath71 for the sm , one gets @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",
    "alternatively , one can use the number - to - photon density ratios @xmath74 which , in the case where entropy is conserved , are related to @xmath75 by @xmath76 .",
    "departing from the scenario where no asymmetry is present , the final value of @xmath77 can be simply expressed by the relation : @xmath78 , where @xmath79 is the leptogenesis efficiency factor .",
    "the computation of @xmath79 requires the numerical solution of the boltzmann equations which take into account the different processes in which the heavy majorana neutrinos are involved .",
    "the result depends on the interplay between the terms which produce the lepton asymmetry , and those which tend to erase it .",
    "exhaustive discussions on these matters can be found for instance in refs .",
    "@xcite , where simple fits which allow to calculate @xmath79 in some regimes are also presented .    in a theoretical framework",
    "where neutrino masses are generated through the seesaw mechanism , leptogenesis arises as the natural candidate to explain the baryon asymmetry of the universe .",
    "therefore , it is natural to ask whether leptogenesis is capable of constraining the high and/or low - energy parameter spaces . in the limit where the heavy majorana neutrino masses are hierarchical , two important bounds have been obtained for the light effective neutrino masses  @xcite and for @xmath80  @xcite namely , @xmath81 in particular , the upper bound on @xmath16 is of crucial importance since future experiments will be sensitive to neutrino masses of the order of 0.1 ev .",
    "an example of such an experiment is katrin  @xcite which will probe neutrino masses down to 0.35ev .",
    "therefore , a positive signal at katrin would exclude the most simple thermal leptogenesis scenario .",
    "upcoming neutrinoless double beta decay setups will be important as well , since they can provide relevant information about neutrino masses  @xcite .",
    "from the point of view of model - building , the constraints presented above constitute a necessary condition to be fulfilled by any seesaw model ( with hierarchical heavy majorana neutrinos ) which aims at explaining the value of the bau .",
    "this fact has led many authors to investigate whether there is a connection between flavor , leptonic @xmath0 violation and leptogenesis can be established or not  @xcite .",
    "a very simple example of such interplay has been presented in ref .",
    "@xcite where the flavor structure of the high - energy neutrino sector is similar to the quark one .",
    "the dirac neutrino yukawa coupling matrix reads : @xmath82 where @xmath83 are the up , charm and top quark masses .",
    "the matrix @xmath84 is analogous to the ckm matrix of the quark sector . in the case",
    "where the small mixing in @xmath84 is neglected , the heavy majorana masses are approximately given by @xmath85 for a hierarchical spectrum of the light neutrinos @xmath86 .",
    "it is clear that , for an up - quark mass @xmath87 , this value is far below the lower bound given in ( [ bounds ] ) for @xmath80 . in this case",

    "a similar situation occurs in a model based in the assumption of democratic flavor structures in the leptonic sector  @xcite .",
    "the above discussion shows that the hierarchy in the dirac neutrino yukawa couplings has to be weaker than the one observed in the quark sector in order for leptogenesis to be successful , leading to an enhancement of the @xmath0 asymmetries in the decays of @xmath52 and @xmath89 . ] .    regarding the connection between the @xmath0 violation needed for leptogenesis and that potentially measured in neutrino experiments one can see that , while leptogenesis only depends on the phases of the matrix @xmath84 shown in eq .",
