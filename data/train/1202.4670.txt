    "periodic intensity pulsations at the neutron star spin frequency , thermonuclear x - ray bursts , and burst oscillations ( brightness variations close to the spin frequency during the bursts ) are observed from some neutron star low - mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ; @xcite ) .",
    "modelling of these features can be useful to measure the neutron star parameters , and to probe the strong gravity regime ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "however , in order to use these features as tools , one needs to understand them sufficiently well .",
    "although , their basic properties are well understood , there are several outstanding questions .",
    "for example , why some of the neutron star lmxbs are accreting pulsars ( showing periodic pulsations ) , while others are not ( e.g. , @xcite ) , what creates burning region asymmetry during decays of some thermonuclear bursts and gives rise to burst decay oscillations ( @xcite and references therein ) , what causes the plausible confinement of the burning regions as indicated from timing analysis ( e.g. , @xcite ) , etc .",
    "accreting pulsars showing burst oscillations are the ideal sources to address these questions . in this paper , we report the results of detailed timing and time - resolved spectral analyses of the thermonuclear bursts from the _ rossi x - ray timing explorer _ ( _ rxte _ ) proportional counter array ( pca ) field - of - view ( fov ) of the recently discovered accreting pulsar igr j174982921 with neutron star spin frequency 400.99 hz @xcite .",
    "@xcite reported burst oscillations from this source .",
    "we confirm this feature with a much higher significance .",
    "we also show spectral indication of thermonuclear bursts from confined regions on the neutron star surface .",
    "we analyze all the _ rxte _ pca data ( 32 obsids between august 13 and september 22 ; 146.496 ks exposure ) of the 2011 outburst of the accreting 401 hz pulsar igr j174982921 .",
    "twelve thermonuclear bursts are detected in the entire data ( see   [ discussion ] for discussions on thermonuclear origin , and on the sources which could give rise to these bursts ) .",
    "we carry out timing analysis and time - resolved spectroscopy , mostly using good - xenon data files ( @xmath20.95 @xmath3s time resolution ) , in order to study the nature of these bursts .",
    "the properties of all the bursts are given in table  [ properties ] .",
    "the bursts can be divided into three groups , based on the pre - burst level subtracted peak count rates ( @xmath4 : counts per second per proportional counter unit ( pcu ) ) : two big bursts with @xmath5 , three medium bursts with @xmath6 , and seven small bursts with @xmath7 ( see fig .  [ lc ] ) . however",
    ", this figure also shows that the shape and duration of bursts do not clearly change across the groups .",
    "now we search for oscillations from all the bursts in the entire pca energy range ( using all active pcus ) .",
    "we start with the august 16 big burst , for which burst oscillations were reported ( see   [ introduction ] ) . the entire burst ( above 5% of the peak count rate )",
    "is divided into 33 ( @xmath8 ) segments of 1 s each .",
    "the leahy normalized power spectra ( @xcite ) from all of them are averaged to obtain a power spectrum of 1 hz resolution ; and a range of @xmath9 hz from the known pulsar frequency (   [ introduction ] ) is searched for a candidate peak .",
    "this is because the burst oscillation frequency do not shift from the neutron star spin frequency by more than 3 hz ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "we find a candidate peak of @xmath10 leahy power at 401 hz .",
    "the probability of obtaining a power this high in a single trial from the expected @xmath11 noise distribution ( @xmath12 degrees of freedom ; @xcite ) is @xmath13 . considering a number of trials of 72 ( @xmath14 ; six 1",
    "hz frequency bins are searched for each of 12 bursts ) , the significance of detection is @xmath15 ( estimated rms amplitude @xmath16% ) .",
    "this suggests that a further and stronger detection would be required for confirmation of burst oscillations from igr j174982921 .",
    "therefore , we perform a similar timing analysis for the august 20 big burst for @xmath17 .",
    "a candidate peak ( @xmath18 leahy power ) appearing at 401 hz has the single trial significance of @xmath19 . considering a number of trials of 72 ( as before ) ,",
    "the significance of detection is @xmath20 , which confirms burst oscillations from igr j174982921 ( see fig .  [ powerspec ] ; note that this burst originated from igr j174982921 (   [ discussion ] ) ) . if some of the 12 bursts were not originated from igr j174982921 (   [ discussion ] ) , then the significance of oscillations from both the big bursts would be higher .",
    "the dynamic @xmath21 power spectrum @xcite of the august 20 big burst shows that the oscillations appear intermittently during burst decay , and there is no significant frequency evolution ( panel _ a _ of fig .",
    "[ bigburst ] ) . panel _",
    "b _ of fig .",
    "[ bigburst ] shows the rms amplitude evolution during the august 20 big burst .",
    "however , burst oscillations are not detected from any medium or small burst .",
    "the 3@xmath0 upper limits of rms amplitude are @xmath22% , @xmath23% and , @xmath24% , for all medium and small bursts combined ( fig .",
    "[ powerspec ] ) , for all medium bursts combined , and for all small bursts combined , respectively .",
    "next we perform time - resolved spectroscopy of each burst after dividing them into time segments with sufficient counts .",
    "note that each small burst has just one segment to maintain enough statistics . from each segment",
    ", we create an energy spectrum with dead time correction @xcite , and a background spectrum from the pre - burst emission @xcite , considering only the top layers of all active pcus .",
    "we fit each energy spectrum in @xmath25 kev with a standard absorbed blackbody model ( phabs*bbodyrad in xspec ; @xcite ) for a fixed neutral hydrogen column density @xmath26 @xmath27 @xcite , considering a systematic error of 1% .",
    "the model fits the spectra well , with reduced @xmath28 ( degrees of freedom = 28 ) for @xmath29% spectra , and between 1.0 and 1.5 for almost all other spectra .",
    "the two big bursts show significant cooling in the decay portions , and the best - fit blackbody temperature and normalization ( defined in the caption of fig .",
    "[ bigburst ] ) evolve in a correlated way .",
    "the temperature profile of each big burst shows two peaks , while a normalization peak coincides with the temperature minimum between two peaks ( see fig .",
    "[ bigburst ] for the august 20 burst ) .",
    "this is a clear signature of a photospheric radius expansion ( pre ) burst ( e.g. , @xcite ; see also @xcite ) .",
    "the medium bursts also show a cooling trend during decay ( e.g. , fig .  [ mediumburst ] ) .",
    "this figure also shows a somewhat correlation between the best - fit blackbody temperature and normalization , which is indicative of the pre nature of the august 19 medium burst .",
    "( see   [ discussion ] for a discussion ) .",
    "we find that the best - fit blackbody temperatures of all the bursts are consistent with each other ( see fig .",
    "[ burstspecpar ] and   [ discussion ] ) .",
    "however , the corresponding best - fit normalizations are correlated with the burst fluence ( integrated energy ) values , and both parameters increase roughly by two orders of magnitude from small bursts to big bursts ( see fig .",
    "[ burstspecpar ] ) .",
    "finally , in order to track the temperature evolution in a model independent way , we plot the burst colour ( ratio of pre - burst level subtracted count rate above 6.14 kev to that below 6.14 kev ) with time ( fig .",
    "[ burstcolor ] ) .",
    "this figure supports the finding that the temperatures of all the bursts are consistent with each other , and also shows a cooling trend during the decay of small bursts .",
    "a dip in colour ( fig .",
    "[ burstcolor ] ) near the peak count rate supports a plausible pre nature of the august 19 medium burst ( see above ) .",
    "we discuss the implications of our results in this section .",
    "let us first show that all the 12 bursts are thermonuclear bursts .",
    "the sharp rise and slow decay of intensity , acceptable fitting of burst spectra with a blackbody model , cooling during burst decay and detection of burst oscillations leave no doubt that the big bursts are of thermonuclear origin .",
    "the first three properties are also true for medium and small bursts .",
    "the very similar shape and duration of all the burst profiles argues that , if big bursts are thermonuclear , then others from the same source are thermonuclear bursts too . besides these are not repetitive bursts , and hence are not accretion - powered type - ii bursts ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "these establish that all the 12 bursts are thermonuclear .",
    "the pca fov of igr j174982921 contains five additional known thermonuclear x - ray bursters : xte j1747274 ( or , igr j174732721 ) , sax j1750.82900 , sax j1747.02853 , 1a 1742289 ( or , ax j1745.62901 ) and slx 1744299/300 .",
    "this brings the question whether some or all of the 12 detected bursts (   [ dataanalysisandresults ] ) were not from igr j174982921 .",
    "the two big bursts showed oscillations at the known pulsar frequency of 401 hz , and hence they were definitely from igr j174982921 .",
    "but which sources gave rise to the medium and small bursts ?",
    "the first four of the five above - mentioned additional bursters are transients , and none of them were in outburst during the outburst of igr j174982921 ( otherwise , the scanning programs of satellites , such as _ integral _ ( e.g. , @xcite ) would detect such an outburst ) .",
    "since a thermonuclear burst from the quiescent phase of a transient is very rare ( e.g. , @xcite ) , it is unlikely that the medium and small bursts originated from one of the four known transient bursters , or any other heretofore unknown transient burster in quiescence in the fov .",
    "here we consider that the medium and small bursts have originated from igr j174982921 and/or from the persistent burster slx 1744299/300 though there still remains a small chance that a low - intensity outburst ( missed by x - ray satellites ) of a transient at the edge of the fov could give rise one or more of these bursts .",
    "three bursts were previously observed with pca from slx 1744299/300 @xcite .",
    "we find that the shape and duration of these bursts were similar to those of our 12 bursts .",
    "the peak count rates ( when corrected for the off - axis position of the source ) of all these slx 1744299/300 bursts are less than those of our medium bursts , but greater than those of our small bursts .",
    "therefore , the shape , duration and peak count rate do not reveal whether our small bursts and medium bursts were from slx 1744299/300 or from igr j174982921 .",
    "the table 3 of @xcite shows that the occurrence of slx 1744299/300 bursts per hour was 0.037 for 290 ks of pca observation .",
    "if all our medium and small bursts had originated from slx 1744299/300 , then the burst rate of this source would be 0.246 hour@xmath30 , which is about seven times larger than the known burst rate ( 0.037 hour@xmath30 ) .",
    "even if only the small bursts had come from slx 1744299/300 , its burst rate would be about five times larger than the known rate .",
    "these suggest that not all the medium and small bursts may have originated from slx 1744299/300 , which implies that at least some of these bursts were from igr j174982921 . in order to know",
    "whether this is indeed the case , we attempt to find out if the angular location of a burst is consistent with that of igr j174982921 . for this",
    ", we exploit the fact that the 5 pcus are not perfectly aligned @xcite , and hence the ratio of observed count rates in a pair of pcus depends upon the position of the source within the fov @xcite .",
    "two pcus were on for each of the bursts , except for the august 16 big burst ( 1 pcu ) .",
    "therefore , for each of 11 bursts , we compute the ratio ( @xmath31 , with an error ) of observed total counts ( preburst level subtracted and deadtime corrected ) in the pair of pcus . for the pca observations of igr j174982921 , this source was almost ( within a few arcsec ) at the centre of the fov . therefore , if an @xmath31 value is consistent with the expected value for the centre of pca fov , then the corresponding burst likely originated from igr j174982921 . in order to find out these expected values , we consider several bursts in pca observations from two other sources ( 4u 1636536 and 4u 160852 ) , which were at the centre of pca fov , and for",
    "each of which there is no known burster in the pca fov . for these sources and for each pair of pcus",
    ", we compute a mean burst count ratio ( @xmath32 , with an error ) , in the same way we compute @xmath31 . these @xmath32 s are the expected ratio values for the centre of pca fov .",
    "we compare an @xmath31 value with the @xmath32 value for same pcu pair .",
    "for each of 11 bursts , table  [ properties ] gives the difference between @xmath31 and @xmath32 in the unit of the estimated error in this difference .",
    "a smaller value of this difference implies a higher possibility for a burst to be originated from igr j174982921 .",
    "for example , this difference is less than one for the brightest medium burst ( august 19 ; for which a plausible pre nature is seen (   [ dataanalysisandresults ] ) ) and two small bursts , implying that these bursts were likely originated from igr j174982921 .",
    "based on the above discussion and table  [ properties ] , in the rest of this section we assume that at least one medium burst and at least one small burst were originated from igr j174982921 .",
    "we now ask the question what made some bursts from igr j174982921 so energetic , while one or more other bursts were so weak . was it because of burning of different chemical compositions in different accretion rate regimes ( @xcite and references therein ) ?",
    "we find that this is very improbable , because ( 1 ) the shape and duration of all the burst profiles are similar , indicating the burning of similar compositions ; and ( 2 ) the burst fluence is not correlated with the persistent intensity . for example , the persistent intensities before one of the august 19 small bursts and before the august 29 small burst are respectively slightly higher and slightly lower than the persistent intensity before the august 20 big burst .",
    "hence we try to find if the increase of the fluence from small bursts to big bursts for igr j174982921 is due to the blackbody temperature increase or due to the burning area ( @xmath33 blackbody normalization ) increase .",
    "[ bigburst ] ( _ c _ ) , [ mediumburst ] ( _ b _ ) , [ burstspecpar ] ( _ a _ ) and [ burstcolor ] show that the best - fit temperatures of one burst are consistent with those of others . in fig .  [ burstspecpar ]",
    "( _ a _ ) , the temperatures of small bursts are somewhat systematically less than those of medium and big bursts ; but this is because the former temperatures are average values during burst profiles , while the latter temperatures are maximum values during burst profiles .",
    "note that such a maximum temperature value for a big burst is for the second temperature peak , which corresponds to the touch - down point ( i.e. , settling of the photosphere on the stellar surface after expansion ) .",
    "unlike the temperature , the normalization , which is proportional to the burning area ( see caption of fig .  [ bigburst ] ) , increases significantly with fluence ( fig .",
    "[ burstspecpar ] ( _ b _ ) ;   [ dataanalysisandresults ] ) .",
    "this strongly suggests that the burning area increases from small bursts to big bursts for igr j174982921 , while the other parameters , including the temperature and composition , remain roughly unchanged .",
    "if this is true , then each burst from igr j174982921 should be similarly strong within its confinement ( burning area ) , and hence , even the small and medium bursts from this source could have local photosphere expansion . however , for a smaller burst , a signature of such expansion ( discussed in   [ dataanalysisandresults ] ) is washed away due to the large time bins required to gather sufficient counts for spectral analysis .",
    "nevertheless , such a signature appears for the brightest medium burst ( figs .",
    "[ mediumburst ] ( _ b _ , _ c _ ) ;   [ dataanalysisandresults ] ) , which likely to be originated from igr j174982921 ( see table  [ properties ] , burst 3 ) .",
    "although , a temperature peak before the peak intensity is not there , the following properties indicate the photosphere expansion : ( 1 ) normalization evolution is very similar to that of the big bursts ( compare fig .",
    "[ bigburst ] ( _ d _ ) with fig",
    ".  [ mediumburst ] ( _ c _ ) ) ; ( 2 ) intensity peak corresponds to the normalization peak and a low temperature ; and ( 3 ) a temperature peak ( corresponding to a low normalization ) appears after the intensity peak .",
    "moreover , an observed dip in colour near the burst intensity peak ( fig .  [ burstcolor ]",
    "( _ c _ ) ) suggests a similar dip in temperature ( undetected plausibly due to large time bin as mentioned above ) , and hence a plausible temperature peak before the peak intensity .",
    "however , a conclusion about the pre nature of this burst has to be made cautiously , because ( 1 ) a temperature peak before the peak intensity is not significantly detected , and ( 2 ) the normalization value following the maximum is not lower with at least @xmath34 significance ( as considered by @xcite ) .",
    "if this medium burst is really a pre burst , then , to the best of our knowledge , this is the first time that two pre bursts with a peak count rate ratio of as high as @xmath1 have been detected from the same source ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "this makes the standard method of source distance measurement using pre bursts ( e.g. , @xcite ) somewhat less reliable , at least for pulsars .",
    "all the bursts from igr j174982921 were likely helium - rich , because of there high temperatures , somewhat short durations and the pre nature ( for at least the two big bursts ; see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "the blackbody normalization values for small and medium bursts ( fig .",
    "[ burstspecpar ] ( _ b _ ) ) imply burning areas much smaller than any realistic neutron star surface area ( e.g. , for a stellar radius of @xmath35 km ) , implying burning in confined regions .",
    "note that these normalization values are estimated assuming a source distance of 10 kpc ( see caption of fig .",
    "[ bigburst ] ) .",
    "if the distance is less ( e.g. , 7.6 kpc for igr j174982921 as reported by @xcite ) , the intrinsic normalization values will be smaller ( implying even smaller burning areas ) by a factor same for all the bursts from a given source . a correction due to",
    "the surface gravitational redshift @xmath36 @xcite will make the intrinsic normalization values further smaller by another factor @xmath37 , which is same for all the bursts from a given source .",
    "the absorption and scattering in the neutron star atmosphere makes the observed temperature higher ( relative to the intrinsic temperature ) by a factor @xmath38 , and the observed normalization lower ( relative to the intrinsic normalization ) by a factor @xmath39 , where @xmath38 is the colour factor @xcite .",
    "does this mean that our conclusion about burning in confined regions for igr j174982921 is not robust ? in order to find out , let us examine , if the burning areas of the big bursts cover the entire neutron star surface , then , whether the burning area of a medium burst from igr j174982921 can also cover the entire surface .",
    "how could this happen ?",
    "suppose , the intrinsic temperature of the medium burst is smaller than that of big bursts , and @xmath38 increases with the decrease of temperature to make the observed temperature of the medium burst and big bursts similar .",
    "then the ratio of a big burst intrinsic normalization to the medium burst intrinsic normalization will be lower ( by a factor , say , @xmath40 ) than the ratio of a big burst observed normalization to a medium burst observed normalization ( the observed normalizations are given in fig .",
    "[ burstspecpar ] ( _ b _ ) ) .",
    "if @xmath41 , then the burning areas of the medium bursts could be similar to those of big bursts ( fig .",
    "[ burstspecpar ] ( _ b _ ) ) .",
    "but , considering the relevant extreme @xmath38 values ( 1.64 , 1.22 ) from the tables of @xcite , @xmath42 ^ 4)$ ] . therefore , even if we consider the maximum possible value ( i.e. , the entire surface ) for a big burst burning area , a medium burst ( from igr j174982921 ) burning area can not be more than @xmath43% of the stellar surface , even after considering the effects of colour factor . with the same arguments , a small burst ( from igr j174982921 ) burning area will be even smaller .",
    "this shows that our conclusion about burning in confined regions is robust .",
    "finally , we note that the observed burning areas of some of the bursts may be small due to obscuration ( for example , if the observer is close to one spinning pole , and burning regions are close to the other ) ; but even for this , the burning has to happen in confined regions . even if all the medium and small bursts were from slx 1744 - 299/300 , the difference in normalization values between these two sets of bursts would indicate confined burning for small bursts for this source . however , we note that the confined burning could be more easily explained for igr j174982921 ( than for slx 1744 - 299/300 ) , which is a known pulsar , and hence likely to have a higher neutron star magnetic field ( see the next paragraph ) .",
    "our results support a prediction of @xcite , that the weaker bursts are from small fractions of the neutron stars .",
    "the low values of the upper limits of burst oscillation fractional rms amplitude for small and medium bursts ( see   [ dataanalysisandresults ] ) suggest that the burning regions for igr j174982921 were close to a spinning pole ( assuming a hot spot model ; @xcite ) .",
    "hence , a reasonable assumption that the thermonuclear burning happens close to the magnetic pole(s ) ( as the accreted matter is channeled to these poles for a pulsar ) implies that the spin axis and the magnetic axis of this pulsar are close to each other .",
    "this supports @xcite s model of accreting millisecond x - ray pulsars . what gave rise to oscillations during the decays of big bursts ?",
    "if the burning covered the entire neutron star surface , then the oscillations could be due to a complex asymmetric brightness pattern , caused by rossby waves ( or r - modes ) in the surface layers , shear instabilities , etc .",
    "( e.g. , @xcite ) . finally , what confined the burning region , and why did the burning area change from burst to burst ? detailed theoretical and numerical studies are required to answer these questions .",
    "the confined burning could be due to the magnetic field near the magnetic pole ( but see @xcite ) , or , magnetic field locally enhanced by the convection during thermonuclear flame spreading ( e.g. , @xcite ) , or , magnetic structure ( e.g. , belt ) on the neutron star surfaces ( e.g. , @xcite ) , or , higher local temperature ( sufficient for ignition ) near the magnetic poles , while ignition condition is not reached at rest of the stellar surface @xcite , or , something else",
    ". whatever be the reason , the indication of burning in confined regions reported in this paper may have significant impact in understanding the accreting pulsars , burst oscillations , burst ignition conditions , surface magnetic field structure and its interaction with flame spreading , etc .",
