    "+ the dirac equation ( de ) is the basic tool for description of relativistic electrons in a vacuum in the presence of external fields . its solutions for electrons in the presence of uniform electric and magnetic fields , the coulomb potential , the kronig - penney periodic potential etc .",
    "are known , see e.g. [ 1 , 2 ] .",
    "the dirac equation describes the electron spin @xmath0 so that , if an electron moves in an electric potential , one deals with the spin - orbit interaction . in the so called weakly relativistic limit of de , the spin - orbit term appears explicitly among three terms of the standard @xmath1 expansion [ 3 ] .",
    "however , one should bear in mind that the spin - orbit interaction in de appears automatically once we deal with an electric potential . a good example is given by de for the electron in the coulomb potential .",
    "energies and solutions for this case are known exactly and they contain the well known effects of spin - orbit interaction ( soi ) .",
    "still , the soi has a specific symmetry and for some system geometries it gives no effects .",
    "for example , in the often considered reflection of relativistic electrons from a barrier , the electrons come and are reflected along the direction perpendicular to the barrier and the effects of soi are not felt . however , if the electrons come to the barrier from an oblique direction , the effects of soi appear and the energy spectrum is split for two spin orientations .",
    "this property of de was overlooked in the work of glass and mendlowitz [ 4 ] and it is our purpose to correct this description .   +",
    "our main point can be briefly illustrated by considering the spin - orbit interaction @xmath2 , resulting from the dirac equation in the presence of an external one - dimensional potential @xmath3 . in this case",
    "the soi takes the form   + @xmath4   + in the standard notation . for @xmath5",
    "there is @xmath6 and @xmath7 , so that , if @xmath8 or @xmath9 components do not vanish , i.e. the incidence is oblique , the spin - orbit energy in general does not vanish . in this case",
    "elastic spin - conserving and spin - flip electron reflections have different outcoming directions .",
    "in addition , we want to consider more generally effects of the soi for electrons in systems with a spatial inversion asymmetry ( sia ) .",
    "such systems play an important role in the modern physics of solids , see the review [ 5 ] , and they could become important also for systems involving relativistic electrons .",
    "our paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we describe oblique spin - conserving and spin - flip electron reflections from the barrier according to the dirac equation .",
    "the spin - orbit energy is estimated in section iii for the case when the unperturbed electron spectrum is continuous and a numerical example is given for the reflection .",
    "in section iv we describe the spin splitting of electron energy due to the soi in an asymmetric quantum well .",
    "we discuss our results in section v. the paper is concluded by a summary . in appendix",
    "we consider an almost nonrelativistic approximation to the reflection from the barrier .",
    "+ we describe oblique spin - conserving and spin - flip reflections from a barrier using the dirac equation .",
    "it is well known that stationary de , which is originally a set of four first - order differential equations , can be separated into two sets of two equations each , corresponding to positive and negative electron energies .",

    "( sometimes the term `` pseudo - spin states '' is used . ) in the following we will use the term `` effective spin states '' .",

    "4 . according to eq .",
    "( 14 ) this means that the reflected spin - flip component exists .",
    "the spin - flip amplitude is proportional to @xmath86 , which comes from the spin - orbit interaction .",
    "however , one needs also @xmath49 .",
    "this agrees with the common knowledge that , for the incoming direction perpendicular to the barrier , there is no spin - flip reflection .",
    "the main physical result is that for incoming electrons with a specific polarization of the effective spin , there appear two beams of reflected electrons : one having the same effective spin and another having the opposite effective spin .",
    "a similar reasoning for the initial spin - down electron state gives @xmath100 , where @xmath101 and @xmath76 are the amplitudes of @xmath102 wave function written in eq .",
    ". thus the above conclusions are symmetric with respect to the effective electron spin .",
    "however , as follows from our kinematic considerations illustrated in fig .",
    "1 , for an incoming spin - down electron with the initial wave vector @xmath65 the reflected spin - up beam is characterized by @xmath64 with @xmath103 , contrary to the initial spin - up case .    it should be clear from the above considerations that the electrons , even if they come from far way , are subjected to soi and represent spin - mixed states .",
    "thus , it is the effective spin that is flipped or conserved in the reflection .",
    "if the incoming electrons do not have well defined effective spin , one can consider them to be combinations of spin - up and spin - down components .",
    "for the spin - flip processes , the reflected spin - down component has the direction closer to normal ( see fig .",
    "2 ) , the spin - up component has the direction further from the normal , and the spin - conserving processes give the reflection having the same angle as the incoming beam .",
    "thus the reflected beams on both sides contain spin - polarized electrons while the middle beam contains unpolarized electrons .",
    "this means that the reflection by a potential barrier can be used as a source of spin - polarized electron beams .",
    "+     + the above theory is not complete until one calculates the spin - orbit energy ( soe ) in cases of interest . in principle soe is given by the matrix element of soi as given by eq .",
    "( 1 ) and , in the full relativistic description , as given by eq . ( 3 ) .",
    "the calculation of soe in this case is not trivial because the unperturbed spectrum of incoming and reflected electron is continuous .",
    "we do not go here into an explicit calculation but make some remarks and estimate soe according to eq .",
    "first , it is clear that a vertical barrier corresponds to an infinite electric field since @xmath104 is infinite . in order to avoid this infinity we consider a barrier of a finite slope linear in @xmath105 , rising from 0 to @xmath51 over the width @xmath20 , as illustrated in fig .",
    "3 . then @xmath106 for @xmath107 and it vanishes outside this range . in consequence ,",
    "in this range of @xmath105 values the soi is @xmath108   + since we set @xmath48 , see above .",
    "next one should determine the eigenfunctions @xmath109 of the diagonal terms @xmath110 in eq .",
    "( 3 ) and calculate the @xmath105-part of the matrix element .",
    "we do not carry this procedure but simply assume that @xmath56 is given by eq .",
    "this overestimates somewhat the true value of @xmath56 since @xmath111 , as given by eq .",
    "( 26 ) , does not depend on @xmath105 , but is nonzero only in the range @xmath107 , while the function @xmath12 is normalized in the whole axis @xmath112 .",
    "the function @xmath12 decays quite fast to the right of the barrier , so neglecting this part gives small corrections to the normalization , while they are larger to the left of the barrier where one deals with free electron states .",
    "now we carry numerical estimations to give an idea about the involved orders of magnitude .",
    "let us take @xmath113 ev and @xmath114 cm corresponding to a very high electric field @xmath115 ev / cm .",
    "if an incoming electron is characterized by @xmath116 @xmath117 and @xmath118 @xmath117 , the resulting soe is @xmath56 = 223.65 ev and the spin - up electron energy is approximately @xmath119 ev . the incoming angle with the normal to the barrier is @xmath120 = ctg@xmath121 and the outgoing angle after spin - flip process is : @xmath122 = ctg@xmath123 , so that the difference of angles between spin - conserving and spin - flip reflected electron beams is @xmath124 .",
    "the situation is schematically shown in fig .",
    "2 . as to the amplitudes of reflected beams ,",
    "the corresponding quantities are : @xmath125 @xmath117 , @xmath126 @xmath117 , @xmath127 @xmath117 , so that @xmath128 .",
    "+ the previous subsections dealt with soe for nonquantized electron states . here",
    "we consider the case of bound electron states .",
    "this situation is again nontrivial but for a different reason .",
    "it is known that in a one - dimensional bound state , considered either classically or quantum mechanically , an average force acting on a particle vanishes .",
    "this result is intuitively quite obvious , but it can be proven rigorously , see e. g. [ 10 ] .",
    "if the only source of force is an electric field , it then follows that an average electric field in a bound state vanishes .",
    "this means that in the above situation the spin - orbit energy , which is proportional to the electric field , also vanishes .",
    "however , this result is not true in relativistic mechanics , in which the particle mass depends on velocity and potential , see eq .",
    "it is known that in relativity there exists an additional `` mass term '' in the force . since it is the total force that must vanish in a bound state , the average electric force @xmath129 compensates the mass term , i. e. the average electric field does not necessarily vanish [ 10 , 11 ] .",
    "thus , in order to have a nonvanishing soe for bound states in a quantum well one needs a relativistic approach .",
    "we consider an asymmetric quantum well shown in fig .",
    "4 . it has the width @xmath20 and the asymmetry is introduced by different heights of potential barriers on both sides .",
    "the asymmetry is necessary since , in a symmetric well , an average electric field would obviously vanish . in order to calculate the effect of soi on the electron energy we first solve the differential equation given by the diagonal term in eq .",

    "are then used to calculate soe with the use of formula   + @xmath131   + where @xmath132 is given in eq .",
    "since the potential is nonzero only at the interfaces and changes in the step - like fashion , the integration across the interfaces gives   + @xmath133 + \\right.\\ ] ]   + @xmath134\\right\\}\\ ] ]   + where @xmath135 $ ] ; @xmath136 $ ] , and @xmath137 $ ] . here",
    "@xmath35 denotes the energy of the bound state and the offsets @xmath138 and @xmath139 are defined in fig .",
    "the values @xmath140 and @xmath141 are not equal , it is seen that the nonvanishing @xmath142 results also from the fact that the electron mass @xmath132 depends on the potential @xmath3 which is different at the left and right interface .",
    "this can be traced back to the above mentioned existence of the `` mass force '' appearing in special relativity .",
    "thus both sia and the relativistic effects are necessary to obtain nonvanishing spin - orbit energy for the bound states . as in the case of nonquantized spectrum ,",
    "soe for a one - dimensional potential @xmath3 is proportional to the transverse wave vector @xmath143 .",
    "it follows from eq .",
    "( 29 ) that the spin - orbit energy @xmath56 is larger for more asymmetric wells , i. e. for larger difference between @xmath138 and @xmath139 .",
    "we carry numerical estimations for @xmath144 ev , @xmath145 ev and the width @xmath146 .",
    "calculated energies for @xmath147 @xmath117 are @xmath148 ev and @xmath56 = 0.7 mev . for a narrower well of the width @xmath20 = 0.1@xmath149 and @xmath150 @xmath117 we calculate @xmath151 ev and @xmath56 = 3.2 ev .",
    "+ first , we briefly mention approximate features of our treatment .",
    "there is a certain ambiguity concerning the considered barrier .",
    "most of the time the barrier is assumed to be vertical but , when estimating the spin - orbit energy , we assume its finite slope . this ambiguity is not troublesome because , in order to obtain measurable spin - orbit energy and perceptible difference of reflection angles ( see fig .",
    "2 ) , one needs a very high electric field , i.e. an _ almost vertical _ barrier .",
    "one should also bear in mind that the employed procedure of treating separately the diagonal parts of the hamiltonian and then calculating the matrix elements of the soi nondiagonal parts is approximate .",
    "one should in principle solve exactly the two coupled differential equations , given by eq .",
    "( 3 ) , applying the corresponding boundary conditions involving spin .",
    "however , the approximate procedure is known to give good results if the nondiagonal terms are small .",
    "it was mentioned above , but we want to repeat it explicitly , that the reason for the spin splitting of energy due to the soi in both considered cases is sia of the systems .",
    "it is well known that if a system is characterized by both time and spatial inversion symmetries , the one - electron energies have at least double degeneracy .",
    "both systems considered above possess the time reversal symmetry , it is sia that causes the spin splitting via the spin - orbit interaction .",
    "however , in both cases the soi is manifested only if there is also nonvanishing motion in the transverse direction characterized by @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "we stress again that in the presence of spin - orbit interaction one deals with spin - mixed states characterized by effective spins ( this was also remarked in ref .",
    "thus , the spin - conserving and spin - flip reflections should be understood in terms of effective spins .",
    "such processes are well known in semiconductor physics , where one deals with spin - mixed states due to the soi and spin - flip scattering processes caused by electric perturbations like phonons , impurities , photons etc .",
    ", see ref . 12 .",
    "the possibility of spin - flip processes due to the soi bears the name of elliott - yafet mechanism .",
    "the special feature of the case we consider is that both the spin splitting of energies and the spin - flip reflection processes are caused by the same electric potential of the barrier via the spin - orbit interaction .",
    "observable effects of the soi in both above cases occur for very small widths of the barrier and quantum well resulting in very high electric fields .",
    "one should bear in mind that in the hydrogen atom one deals with the binding energy of 13.6 ev corresponding to the atomic radius of around 0.5 @xmath149 which corresponds to electric fields of about 3@xmath152 v / cm .",
    "in addition , quantum energies are smaller for 1d potentials of our interest here than for 3d potentials . clearly , we chose energies and potentials smaller than @xmath153 in order to avoid the effects of klein paradox .",
    "it should be emphasized that , in both our cases , the proposed effects occur only for the relativistic electrons .",
    "first , because the spin - orbit interaction has the relativistic origin , second , because in an asymmetric quantum well the spin splitting due to the soi is realized via the relativistic dependence of electron mass on external potential .",
    "we mentioned above that the proposed system can serve as a source or a filter of spin - polarized electron beams since it spatially separates electrons with oriented effective spins .",
    "one can also say that this arrangement realizes the stern - gerlach experiment for free electrons in a vacuum which , in its original formulation with a magnetic field , remains a controversial problem [ 13 , 14 ] .",
    "+ we described oblique reflection of spin - polarized relativistic electrons from a one - dimensional potential barrier taking into account the spin - orbit interaction existing in the dirac equation .",
    "it is shown that the spin - conserving and spin - flip reflections have different reflection angles and they can serve as spin filters or spin polarizers .",
    "numerical estimations of reflection angles and amplitudes are given .",
    "a one - dimensional asymmetric quantum well is considered and it is demonstrated that the energy of the electron bound state is split by the spin - orbit interaction if one takes into account relativistic dependence of electron mass on the energy and potential .",
    "general properties of energy splitting due to spin - orbit interaction are considered .",
