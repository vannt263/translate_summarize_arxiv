    "we have taken off - nuclear spectra of 3 radio loud qso s , 3c249.1 , 3c273 and 3c323.1 ( boroson and oke 1984 ) , using the echellette spectrograph and imager ( esi ) ( sheinis et .",
    "al 2000 ) at keck observatory .",
    "each object was observed at several differant position angles and offsets from the nucleus . from these spectra",
    "we have extracted the spatial profile along the slit of the [ oiii ] , @xmath0 line .",
    "each image is the median of four 15 minute exposures .",
    "the data were processed using the information data language ( idl ) .",
    "they were first rectified to remove the instrument distortion , bias subtracted then a two dimensional sky model was subtracted .",
    "after this extraction we fit a linear combination of two gaussian distributions to each of these profiles , using ( idl ) .",
    "figure 1 shows the two - dimensional extraction image for each object . for 3c249.1 ,",
    "three slit position are shown , 3 seconds east , 3.5 seconds north and 3 seconds west are shown .",
    "one position is shown for each of the remaining objects , 3c273 and 3c323.1 .",
    "those positions are 4 seconds east and 3 seconds east .",
    "the lower panels of figure 1 show the results of the gaussian fit for each object , namely the mean , dispersion and magnitude of the gaussian fit for each gas component .",
    "the plots show bright extended emission at tens of kiloparsecs from the galaxy nucleus .",
    "this emission is observed to have peak velocity @xmath1 of 540 , 940 and 535 km / sec for the three slit positions of 3c249.1 , 500 km / sec for 3c273 and 470 km / sec for 3c323.1 .",
    "these velocities are most likely well beyond escape velocity for these galaxies .    *",

    "we have obtained slitless spectroscopy images of several objects .",
    "the four panels of figure 2 show ten minute exposures of one well - studied object , 3c48 ( canalizo 2000 ) taken at four differant position angles , through a six arcsecond wide slit . they have been processed identically to the above images .",
    "additionally , a modelled qso continuum was carefully subtracted to reveal details within a half arcsecond of the nucleus .    in order to deconvolve the velocity and spatial information in the y axis of each image ,",
    "we have produced pairs of images that have the dispersion axis rotated relative each other , by 180 degrees . in objects ( like 3c48 ) that contain well defined clumps of gas moving at a definite velocity , position and velocity can be inferred directly by comparing the two images . in objects with a more complex spatial and velocity structure this method becomes less effective .",
    "figure 2 shows the emission - line gas of 3c48 as viewed through a 6 arcsecond wide by 20 arcsecond long slit .",
    "the two images show two differant position angles separated by 180 degrees . in first pair of images of 3c48",
    "( upper and lower left ) we see one bright gas knot ( x ) redshifted by @xmath2 200 km / sec relative to four smaller knots ( a - d ) that appear to be at similar velocites .",
    "all 5 knots are located to the north of the nucleus .",
    "closer to the nucleus we see one higher dispersion ( @xmath2 600 km / sec ) , higher velocity knot ( @xmath2 500km / sec ) ( e ) to the north and another ( f ) to the south .",
    "a similar evaluation can be done to the rightmost pair of images ."
