    "the static properties of various heterospin chains were correspondingly calculated , @xcite but few effort has been devoted to exploring their dynamic features .",
    "recent nmr observations of 1d ferrimagnets @xcite have thus been motivated and have indeed stimulated the theoretical interest in them .",
