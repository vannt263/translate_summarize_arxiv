    "in the old picture of inflation , originally suggested by a. guth @xcite , the universe is trapped in a meta - stable false vacuum whose energy causes the universe to expand quasi - exponentially .",
    "as the universe expands , bubbles of true vacuum gradually form inside the sea of false vacuum . the transition is completed by the coalescence of bubbles , releasing the latent heat of transition and recovering from the supercooling .",
    "to have the universe expand sufficiently to solve the problems of standard big bang cosmology , the phase transition should be quite slow .",
    "this would prevent the bubbles from percolation and thus the universe would never recover from the inflationary stage .",
    "chain inflation @xcite resolves the problems of old inflation by assuming that more than one stage of inflation is responsible for solving the problems of big bang cosmology . instead , the universe tunnels rapidly through a series of ever lower energy vacua .",
    "the failure of old inflation is avoided because the bubbles of true vacuum are able to percolate at each step since the phase transition is fairly rapid .",
    "the nucleation rate per unit four volume has the form @xcite : @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the euclidean action for the bounce solution extrapolating between false and true vacua and @xmath2 is a determinant factor @xcite , which is generally of order the quartic power of the energy scale of the phase transition . for a first order phase transition , with einstein gravity",
    ", it has been shown that the probability of a point remaining in the false vacuum is given by @xmath3 where @xmath4 is defined by @xmath5 writing eq .",
    "( [ prob - desitter ] ) as @xmath6 , the lifetime of the field in the false vacuum is given by : @xmath7 the number of @xmath8-foldings for the tunneling event is @xmath9 @xmath4 has to be greater than the critical value , @xmath10 , where @xcite lies somewhere between @xmath11 and @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the critical ratio between the volume inside the bubbles and the total volume .",
    "however , we have been inexact and used the term bubble percolation as equivalent to the end of inflation . ]",
    "@xmath14 to achieve percolation and thermalization .",
    "this corresponds to having an upper bound on the number of @xmath8-foldings that that can be obtained in each stage of inflation : @xmath15    the approximate number of @xmath8-foldings which is required to solve the problems of standard cosmology depends on the energy scale of inflation , @xmath16 , and the reheating temperature : @xmath17where @xmath18 gev , @xmath19 gev . for a model with energy scale and reheating temperature around the gut scale , about @xmath20 @xmath8-foldings are required , whereas for the one in which these parameters take values around the qcd scale , minimum number of @xmath8-foldings is reduced to @xmath21 .",
    "this corresponds to having at least around @xmath22 phase transitions for the gut scale chain inflation and around @xmath23 ones for the qcd scale chain inflation .",
    "a study of density perturbations from chain inflation has been performed in @xcite , which found that the right amount of perturbations to match data can be generated .",
    "previous studies can be found in @xcite .",
    "chain inflation can arise in many contexts .",
    "however , we wish to make clear at the outset that many other versions of chain inflation may be very successful . for example , freese , liu , and spolyar @xcite examined chain inflation due to four - forms in string theory where there can be large numbers of potential minima connected by tunneling .",
    "we note that the present result does _ not _ apply to the case of four - form inflation .",
    "in this paper we focus specifically on two variants of chain inflation and show that the model fails for these cases : i ) chain inflation with the qcd axion @xcite and ii ) monodromy chain inflation @xcite .",
    "the basic problem is that , for these two specific examples , the width of the potential is so large that tunneling never takes place .",
    "individual minima are ( meta)stable for extremely long timescales .",
    "we use a triangle potential to approximate the real potentials in obtaining these results .",
    "however , if one considers ",
    "axions \" at any scale , not tied to qcd , then chain inflation can work for the scales discussed here in the paper .",
    "in addition , for potentials with comparable heights and widths , the problem can be avoided as well .",
    "chain inflation fails for some select models but can easily work in others .",
    "first we will review qcd axion inflation and remind the reader how the necessity to avoid the thin wall limit arose in the original paper @xcite .",
    "then we calculate the nucleation rate for the thick wall limit , approximating the potential with triangles .",
    "next we will relax the restriction of taking the inflaton to be the qcd axion .",
    "if the inflaton is some other axion with different mass scales , we can set some constraints on the height and width of the bumps that separate two adjacent minima , in order to have critical nucleation rates .",
    "these constraints could be used in the future to identify proper candidates for realizing chain inflation .",
    "finally , inspired by extended inflation @xcite , we investigate the possibility of overcoming the difficulties of qcd axion inflation by modifying the gravity sector of the theory .",
    "two of us @xcite previously proposed that the qcd axion might be the inflaton if it were supplemented with i ) a large number of minima , corresponding to new heavy fermions participating in the chiral anomaly and ii ) soft symmetry breaking of the peccei - quinn symmetry to provide a tilt to the potential . here",
    "we discuss this model in detail and examine its pitfalls as a proposed inflation model .",
    "the qcd axion is the goldstone boson of the broken @xmath24 peccei - quinn symmetry which was postulated to solve the strong @xmath25 problem of strong interactions @xcite .",
    "as was shown by sikivie @xcite , when this global symmetry is broken , a discrete @xmath26 subgroup remains unbroken , where @xmath27 is the number of quark flavors that rotate under @xmath24 .",
    "the complete form of the axion potential depends on non - perturbative effects .",
    "however , for definiteness , we will focus on the  invisible axion \" model of dine - fischler - srednicki - zhitnitsky @xcite , where the axion is identified as the phase of a complex @xmath28 singlet scalar , @xmath29 .",
    "below the peccei - quinn symmetry breaking scale , @xmath30 , the axion potential takes the following form : @xmath31.\\ ] ] here @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is the decay constant of the axion ; it has to be between @xmath34 gev and @xmath35 gev to satisfy the constraints from stellar evolution @xcite and cosmology @xcite .",
    "in addition , @xmath36 is on the order of the qcd scale , which we take to be around @xmath37 mev .",
    "the axion mass , @xmath38 , is equal to @xmath39 , where @xmath40 ( but see @xcite ) , and @xmath41 mev and @xmath42 mev are respectively the mass and decay constant of the pion .",
    "the energy scale of inflation is around the qcd scale , and thus , as pointed out above , the required number of minima has to be taken to be larger than @xmath43 to obtain a sufficient number of @xmath8-foldings .",
    "this requires the introduction of additional heavy fermions beyond the usual quark and leptons .",
    "they carry color charge as well as pq charge and thus contribute to the qcd anomaly @xcite . to be definite",
    "hereafter we take @xmath44 .",
    "the @xmath24 symmetry is softly broken by adding a term of the form @xmath45 to the lagrangian .",
    "this in turn adds a term of the form @xmath46 to the axion potential , where @xmath47 and @xmath48 are real parameters .",
    "( note that @xmath48 misaligns the qcd and soft breaking minima . )",
    "introducing a new variable @xmath49 , the combined potential for the axion takes the form : @xmath50 there is a limit on @xmath48 from the electric dipole moment ( edm ) of the neutron , namely , from the fact that the minimum of the combined potential should not be shifted from zero : @xmath51 we should impose the edm bounds at the bottom of the potential , which is the end point of tunneling . there",
    "one can show that @xmath52 @xcite .",
    "this constraint can be satisfied in many ways as was discussed in @xcite .",
    "here , for simplicity , we set @xmath53 from the outset .",
    "in the thin wall limit , the euclidean action is given by @xmath54 where @xmath55 is given by @xmath56 da.\\ ] ] thus , we have : @xmath57 for the parameters of the invisible axion @xcite , @xmath58 and thus tunneling is suppressed . in @xcite , it was speculated that being away from the thin wall limit and having @xmath59 , can cure this problem .",
    "however as we will show below , the problem of suppressed tunneling persists even in the thick wall limit .",
    "to compute the nucleation rate , we will use the result of @xcite , where a general one dimensional potential could be approximated by a potential with triangular form ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) , in which case the equation of motion for the bounce can be explicitly solved .",
    "note that @xmath60 and @xmath61 are the values of the field and potential energies at the false and true vacua , respectively , and @xmath62 is the value of the field and potential energy at the maximum of the potential .",
    "the resulting expression for the euclidean action takes on two forms , depending on the condition : is assumed to be satisfied already . ]",
    "@xmath63 here we have defined the quantities @xmath64 , @xmath65 and @xmath66 . if the above condition is satisfied , @xmath1 takes the form : @xmath67 where @xmath68 .",
    "otherwise , if condition ( [ condition1 ] ) is not met , the euclidean action is instead given by : @xmath69 where : @xmath70    in order to connect the parameters of the axion potential to that of the triangle approximation , we first note that @xmath71 , the energy difference between two consecutive minima , is proportional to the soft - breaking parameter @xmath47 .",
    "however we can not make @xmath47 arbitrarily large because once @xmath47 becomes equal to @xmath72 the barrier between two vacua disappears and the field simply rolls down the potential rather than tunneling .",
    "thus , if @xmath27 happens to be close to the critical value , @xmath73 , for which one would obtain enough @xmath8-foldings , the model will not be able to inflate enough if @xmath47 is larger that @xmath74 .",
    "hereafter , we will take @xmath75 since it gives the most rapid tunneling rate without going over to rolling .",
    "we note that , in the middle of the axion potential , the condition ( [ condition1 ] ) is satisfied and hence we may use eq .",
    "( [ se - cond1 ] ) to compute the instanton action . for @xmath76 gev ( or @xmath34 gev ) , we see that @xmath1 is of order @xmath77 ( or @xmath78 ) in the middle of the potential . thus the tunneling is highly suppressed . at the bottom of the potential , where @xmath71 gets smaller ,",
    "condition ( [ condition1 ] ) is not met and we have to use equation ( [ se - cond2 ] ) to calculate the euclidean action . here",
    "the situation gets worse ; for @xmath76 gev ( or @xmath34 gev ) , the euclidean action takes the value @xmath79 ( or @xmath80 ) .",
    "the minute value of the nucleation rate can be understood intuitively by noting that the vacua are very far apart and hence their wave functions can not overlap .    somewhere in the limit of a broad barrier , the coleman transition @xcite ceases to exist .",
    "then the decay instead goes through the hawking - moss instanton @xcite , which physically describes a thermal jump of the field onto the top of the barrier .",
    "however , to have hawking - moss instanton , we must have @xmath81 .",
    "this condition is not satisfied in the case of the qcd axion , for which @xmath82 , as @xmath83 .",
    "thus we conclude that the qcd axion , as suggested in @xcite , is not able to realize chain inflation",
    ".     axions \" not tied to the qcd scale are also ubiquitous in string theory @xcite .",
    "if we relax the requirement that we are dealing with the qcd axion here , and consider  axions \" of arbitrary mass scale , successful chain inflation models can be found that avoid the problem of insufficient tunneling . for a potential of the form ( [ combined - pot ] ) with arbitrary barrier height @xmath84 and decay constant @xmath33 , the instanton action @xmath1 can become of @xmath85 , if the following constraint is satisfied : @xmath86 it would be worthwhile to investigate the realm of string theory axions to see if one can find suitable candidates that satisfy ( [ cosntraint - chain ] ) to realize the idea of chain inflation .",
    "a similar problem of suppressed nucleation rates arises in a particular attempt to realize chain inflation in the string landscape @xcite . in @xcite , the generic distance between minima in the monodromy staircase",
    "is obtained to be large , @xmath87 .",
    "as @xcite requires a shorter inter - minimum distance , this will again lead to suppressed nucleation rates .",
    "in the remainder of this paper , we suggest a way of avoiding the problem of suppressed tunneling rates of qcd and monodromy chain inflation by modifying the gravity sector of the theory .",
    "the remedy is motivated by how extended inflation @xcite amends the graceful exit problem of old inflation .",
    "several approaches have been taken to solve the graceful exit problem of old inflation .",
    "adams and freese @xcite suggested a time - dependent nucleation rate , so that the initial value of @xmath4 defined in eq .",
    "( [ beta ] ) was very small ( and the universe inflates ) but the final value of @xmath4 becomes very large ( so that the bubbles of true vacuum percolate and the phase transition completes ) ; their model is called double field inflation .",
    "around the same time , la and steinhardt @xcite made an alternative suggestion , namely extended inflation , where the gravity part of the action takes a brans - dicke ( bd ) form @xcite , @xmath88,\\ ] ] where @xmath89 is known as the brans - dicke parameter . in the above action",
    ", general relativity is recovered in the limit of @xmath90 and present day tests of general relativity require @xmath91 .",
    "modification of the gravity sector as above will change the expansion from de - sitter to @xcite : @xmath92 here @xmath93 and @xmath94 , where @xmath95 is @xmath96 in the beginning of inflation at @xmath97 and @xmath98 is the value of cosmological constant in the metastable vacuum . for @xmath99 , where @xmath100 , the scale factor expands exponentially .",
    "however after that the behavior of the scale factor changes to power - law , @xmath101 , where @xmath102 .",
    "change in the evolution of the background modifies the rate at which bubble nucleation converts false vacuum to true vacuum .",
    "as shown in @xcite , the probability of a point remaining in the false vacuum is given by @xmath103.\\ ] ] for de - sitter expansion , this reduces to ( [ prob - desitter ] ) .",
    "however , for a power - law background , the probability to remain in false vacuum phase becomes : @xmath104 where @xmath105 @xcite .",
    "as @xmath106 is decreasing much faster than the volume , the universe will soon exit inflation and graceful exit is achieved . however , for the case of extended inflation @xcite , it was understood that the bubbles that form in the beginning of inflation would be stretched to cosmological scales by inflation .",
    "this constraint forced @xmath89 to be less than @xmath107 . with this value of @xmath89 , requiring the scalar spectral index to satisfy constraints from wmap",
    "is impossible .",
    "resolutions that are based on making @xmath89 time - dependent are also very contrived @xcite .",
    "nonetheless , we may apply this idea to chain inflation to see if we can obtain a sensible , even though contrived , solution for the small nucleation rate of qcd and monodromy chain inflation .",
    "we first calculate @xmath108 , the time it takes for the universe to complete the power - law phase .",
    "the volume in the false vacuum phase is @xmath109 where @xmath106 is given in eq .",
    "( [ prob - power ] ) .",
    "the volume in the false vacuum phase starts to contract at time @xmath110 at @xmath111 , the exponential factor in @xmath106 starts to takes over the behavior of @xmath112 and thereafter it starts to decrease exponentially , with an exponent equal to @xmath113 . only within @xmath114 , the volume in the false vacuum phase becomes an infinitesimal fraction of the total volume .",
    "therefore the coalescence of true vacuum bubbles and recovery from the false vacuum phase is achieved within @xmath115 .",
    "the number of @xmath8-foldings obtained in the power - law phase is then : @xmath116 this should be compared with the number of @xmath8-foldings obtained in the de - sitter stage : @xmath117    note that brans - dicke theories with @xmath118 arise naturally in compactifications of sting theory and other kaluza - klein theories @xcite . for @xmath119 , we have @xmath120 where @xmath1 is the euclidean action for the bounce solution which is obtained in the last section . for qcd inflation , at the bottom of the potential ,",
    "@xmath1 was obtained to be of order @xmath79 for @xmath121 gev .",
    "therefore the number of @xmath8-foldings obtained in the power - law phase of the first minimum is much more than enough and can solve the problems of standard big bang cosmology by itself .",
    "there is no need for the other minima in chain inflation .",
    "one can circumvent the long power - law phase by adjusting the value of @xmath89 to be of order @xmath122 .",
    "for such values of @xmath89 the universe expands @xmath123 one @xmath8-fold in the de - sitter stage and recovers from the power - law phase in a small fraction of an @xmath8-fold .",
    "although such small values of @xmath89 are in disagreement with solar tests of general gravity , it may be possible to make the parameter @xmath89 field - dependent ( similar to hyper - extended inflation @xcite ) , so that it takes such small values during inflation but is then driven toward experimentally - viable values afterwards .    in summary",
    ", we have identified a problem of too slow nucleation rates in chain inflation in those models with minima separated by great distances in field space .",
    "the two cases we studied were chain inflation with the qcd axion @xcite and monodromy @xcite chain inflation . to obtain sufficiently rapid tunneling",
    ", one could look for other ",
    "axionic \" candidates that satisfy constraints like ( [ cosntraint - chain ] ) .",
    "we have also suggested another option of resolving the problem by extending the gravity sector of the theory to brans - dicke theory .",
    "this solution is motivated by the mechanism whereby extended inflation solves the graceful exit problem of old inflation ( which also arises due to the small nucleation rate of the inflaton ) .",
    "such a resolution requires an extremely small value for the brans - dicke parameter , @xmath89 , which must therefore become time dependent .",
    "it is interesting to see if string theory can come up with such values for @xmath89 . alternatively ,",
    "many models of chain inflation which have smaller distances between vacua ( or are not described by a potential at all ) easily have rapid tunneling and do not suffer from the problems discussed in this paper at all .",
