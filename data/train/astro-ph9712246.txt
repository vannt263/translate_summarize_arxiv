    "the _ uvby _ and h@xmath0 photometric systems , defined by strmgren ( 1966 ) and crawford & mander ( 1966 ) , were designed to measure fundamental spectral signatures in early- and intermediate - type stars .",
    "their combined use is one of the most suitable photometric methods to determine temperatures , luminosity classes , absolute magnitudes and other stellar parameters of astrophysical interest .    in the case of",
    "be stars , however , the usual techniques of _ uvby_@xmath0 calibration are not suitable . in their observed photometric indices , besides the contribution of photospheric emission and interstellar extinction , there is an additional emission contribution from a circumstellar envelope .",
    "the main purpose of this work is to present a method to determine such intrinsic parameters from _",
    "uvby_@xmath0 photometry .",
    "it has been shown by several authors ( dachs et al .",
    "1986 , 1988 ; kaiser 1989 ) that the continuum emission of the circumstellar envelope is closely correlated with the equivalent width of the balmer lines .",
    "thus , by measuring the balmer emission - line strengths , the underlying star contribution to the photometric indices can be decoupled from the circumstellar disk contribution , and then the usual _",
    "uvby_@xmath0 calibrations can be applied .",
    "a preliminary exposition of this method is given by fabregat & reglero ( 1990 ) , hereafter referred to as fr90 .    in order to accurately determine the relationship between the circumstellar continuum emission and the emission in the balmer lines , we have developed an observational programme of simultaneous _",
    "uvby_@xmath0 photometry and balmer line spectroscopy of be stars in open clusters .",
    "the advantage of studying stars in clusters is that their intrinsic colours and distances can be inferred from the cluster parameters , and thus the anomalies in their photometric indices caused by the continuum emission from the envelope can be directly measured .",
    "uvby_@xmath0 photometry is presented in fabregat et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , hereafter referred to as paper i. the balmer line spectroscopy is presented in torrejn et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , hereinafter paper ii .",
    "in paper i we showed that be stars occupy anomalous positions in the photometric diagrams , which can be explained in terms of the circumstellar continuum radiation contribution to the photometric indices . in the @xmath1  @xmath2 plane be stars appear redder than the non emission b stars , due to the additional reddening caused by the hydrogen free - bound and free - free recombination in the circumstellar envelope .",
    "in the @xmath1  @xmath3 plane the earlier be stars present lower @xmath3 values than absorption - line b stars , which is caused by emission in the balmer discontinuity , while the later be stars deviate towards higher @xmath3 values , indicating absorption in the balmer discontinuity of circumstellar origin .",
    "following fr90 , we will denote @xmath4 and @xmath5 the contribution of the circumstellar emission to the @xmath6 colour and @xmath7 index .",
    "the values of these circumstellar excesses can be directly measured for be stars in open clusters .",
    "we consider the circumstellar excess value as the difference between the observed photometric index and the photometric index corresponding to the absorption - line b stars of the same absolute magnitude .",
    "the loci of the absorption - line b stars in the photometric @xmath1  @xmath2 and @xmath1 ",
    "@xmath3 diagrams has been considered to be well represented by the cluster isochrones . in figure 1 we show graphically how the @xmath4 and @xmath5 values are measured .",
    "the main source of error in the determination of the circumstellar excesses , in addition to the errors of the photometric measurements and the cluster reddening , is the assumption of the isochrone as being representative of the normal star positions . to estimate this error ,",
    "we have computed the standard deviation of the differences between the positions of the absorption - line b stars and the isochrone , measured as explained in figure 1 .",
    "the obtained values are 0.025 and 0.033 mag . for @xmath6 and @xmath7 respectively .",
    "we assume these values as the errors of our @xmath4 and @xmath5 determinations .",
    "it should be noted that with this approach we assume that there are not significant variations of the absolute magnitude of circumstellar origin . to check this assumption , in figure 2",
    "we have plotted the excess in @xmath1 for the be stars in our sample against the h@xmath8 equivalent width .",
    "the @xmath1 excess has been computed as the difference between the absolute magnitude derived from the observations and using the cluster reddening and distance modulus , and the mean @xmath1 for the spectral type of each star .",
    "we have assumed the spectral types determined by slettebak ( 1985 ) . as it can be seen , no trend of absolute magnitude variation with the amount of circumstellar emission is apparent .",
    "on the other hand , zorec & briot ( 1991 ) have studied in depth the overluminosity effects produced by the presence of the circumstellar emission .",
    "they concluded that the mean @xmath1 variation amounts between 0.5 and 0.1 mag .",
    ", for spectral types between b0 and b5 .",
    "as it can be seen in figure 1 , this variation would introduce very small errors in the determination of @xmath4 and @xmath5 , well within the errors estimated in the above paragraph .    with the above precepts we have measured the @xmath4 and @xmath5 values for all",
    "be stars in the clusters @xmath9 and @xmath10 persei , ngc 663 , pleiades , ngc 2422 and @xmath8 persei for which _",
    "uvby_@xmath0 photometry is given in paper i. we have excluded stars 107 and 110 in ngc 663 , because their peculiar position in the photometric diagrams makes the determination of the excesses very uncertain .",
    "we have also considered the cluster isochrones computed in paper i.    the amount of circumstellar continuum emission is closely correlated with the equivalent widths of the balmer emission lines ( dachs et al .",
    "1986 , 1988 ; kaiser 1989 ) .",
    "thus , the circumstellar excesses in the photometric indices should be also correlated with the equivalent widths .",
    "we have determined these relations by comparing our values of @xmath4 and @xmath5 with the h@xmath8 and h@xmath0 equivalent widths presented in paper ii . in paper",
    "i we have shown that be stars earlier and later than b5 present different behavior in the photometric diagrams , showing @xmath5 of opposite sign . in consequence , we have considered separately early and late be stars .    for",
    "the late be stars no clear relations are present between the photometric excesses and the equivalent widths .",
    "this may be caused by the small number of stars considered , only eight .",
    "therefore we will restrict our study to be stars earlier than b5 , which implies that we will consider only stars in the clusters @xmath9 and @xmath10 persei and ngc 663 . from this sample",
    "we obtain the following relations :    @xmath11    where the equivalent widths , expressed in  , are considered negative for emission lines .",
    "@xmath12 represents the standard deviation of the relation and @xmath13 the correlation coefficient .",
    "these relations have been obtained with equivalent widths not corrected for photospheric absorption , as presented in paper ii .",
    "we have also computed the above relations for emission equivalent widths . to correct for photospheric absorption",
    "we have performed the following iterative procedure :    * we have used the above relations to compute the circumstellar excesses for each star , and corrected the photometric indices for circumstellar effects . * with the corrected indices we have computed the @xmath14 and @xmath15 for each star , using the formulae given by balona ( 1994 ) to interpolate in the grid of theoretical _ uvby _ indices computed by lester et al .",
    "( 1986 ) . * with these values",
    "we have computed the equivalent widths of the photospheric absorption lines by means of the kurucz ( 1979 ) atmosphere models .",
    "the obtained values have been subtracted from the uncorrected equivalent widths .",
    "doing this , we are adding to the measured emission line above the continuum the amount of emission filling - in the photospheric absorption line .",
    "* we have computed new correlations , and repeated all the procedure until the result converges .",
    "the final relations for corrected equivalent widths are the following :    @xmath16    the slopes of the corrected relations remain practically unchanged with respect to the uncorrected ones .",
    "the only significant differences are in the zero points , which in the corrected equations are compatible with zero within the errors , as expected because in this last case we are comparing two effects produced by the presence of a circumstellar envelope .",
    "these relations are presented in figure 3 .",
    "equations ( 1 ) and ( 5 ) closely correspond to eq .",
    "( 39 ) in dachs et al .",
    "( 1988 ) , which represents the relationship between the circmstellar excess in the @xmath17 colour and the h@xmath8 equivalent width , found by these authors .    from the @xmath12 and @xmath13 coefficients of the above relations and from figure 3",
    ", the correlation between the photometric excesses and the equivalent widths is apparent .",
    "the correlation seems to be better for the h@xmath0 equivalent width .",
    "this would mean that the region of the circumstellar disc in which the continuum emission contaminating the _ uvby _ indices arises is closer to the region in which the h@xmath0 emission line is formed .",
    "this is expected from the fact that the wavelength of the h@xmath0 line is closer to the _ uvby _ bandpasses .",
    "if the h@xmath0 equivalent width is closely correlated with the circumstellar continuum emission , the photometric @xmath0 index has to be correlated as well .",
    "the @xmath0 index is , by construction , linearly related to the h@xmath0 equivalent width ( golay , 1974 ) .",
    "furthermore , fabregat & torrejn ( 1997 ) have shown that this linear relation is valid even for emission - line stars .",
    "then we have also studied the correlation between the @xmath0 index and the excesses in the photometric indices .",
    "as in the case of the spectroscopic equivalent widths , the value to be correlated with @xmath4 and @xmath5 is not the @xmath0 index , but the excess in the @xmath0 index due to the circumstellar emission , which we will denote @xmath18 .",
    "@xmath18 is defined as the difference between the observed @xmath0 index and the @xmath0 index of the underlying b star .",
    "the latter is not known _ a priori _ , and we have to estimate its value by means of an iterative procedure . as this discussion applies to a rather narrow range of spectral types , o9 to b5",
    ", we have considered a mean value for the @xmath0 index in this spectral range , namely @xmath0 = 2.63 .",
    "we obtain a first approximation to the @xmath0 excess as @xmath18 = @xmath0  2.63 , where @xmath0 is the observed value",
    ". then we correlate these values with the photometric excesses , and obtain a first approximation to @xmath4 and @xmath5 . with the latter value we obtain @xmath3 corrected from circumstellar effects , and from it we determine the @xmath0 value of the underlying star -which we will denote @xmath19 in order to avoid confusion with the observed @xmath0 value -by means of the following relation    @xmath20    ( balona & shobbrook , 1984 ) . the @xmath19 values obtained with this equation can safely replace the observed @xmath0 indices in the range of the early b - type main sequence and giant stars ( balona 1994 ) . with the @xmath19 values obtained in this way we re",
    "- determine @xmath18= @xmath21 , and repeat the procedure until convergence .",
    "as the relations we are now studying are only between photometric indices , we have searched the literature for _ uvby_@xmath0 photometry of be stars in open clusters , in order to derive the relations from as large a sample as possible .",
    "we have used , as well as our photometry for @xmath9 and @xmath10 persei and ngc 663 ( paper i ) , data for be stars in the clusters ngc 3766 ( shobbrook 1985 , 1987 ) and ngc 4755 ( perry et al . 1976 ) .    in the relation obtained after the iterative procedure the zero points are again compatible with zero .",
    "then , with the final @xmath18 values we have computed the correlations assuming no zero point .",
    "the results are the following :    @xmath22    the two first relations are presented in figure 4 . for the sake of completeness ,",
    "we have also computed the relation for the @xmath23 index .",
    "balona & shobbrook ( 1984 ) proposed an alternative to equation ( 9 ) to determine @xmath19 for stars of luminosity class iv - iii .",
    "we have reproduced all the above procedure and the discussion in section 4 using different equations for stars of luminosity class v or iv - iii .",
    "the results obtained are basically the same that those presented here ( torrejn 1997 ) .",
    "we have preferred to construct our calibration using only equation ( 9 ) , because in this way we do not need a previous knowledge of the star s luminosity class .",
    "in the previous section we have derived relations between the emission in the h@xmath0 line , measured through the @xmath0 index , and the excesses in the photometric _ uvby _ indices of circumstellar origin . the existence of such relations opens the possibility to use the h@xmath0 photometry to correct the _ uvby _",
    "indices for circumstellar emission , and then derive the interstellar reddening and the intrinsic indices of the underlying star . these intrinsic indices can be used to estimate the astrophysical parameters of the underlying star by means of the usual _ uvby _ calibrations .",
    "the procedure to obtain the intrinsic _ uvby _ indices of a b star , correcting for the effect of the interstellar reddening , has been given by crawford ( 1978 ) .",
    "in the case of a be star , we have to correct for both interstellar reddening and circumstellar continuum emission . in this section",
    "we propose a procedure to determine the circumstellar excesses , the interstellar reddening and the intrinsic colours of the underlying star .",
    "the basic idea is to use the @xmath0 index as additional information to characterize the circumstellar emission , and then use the crawford ( 1978 ) method to measure the interstellar reddening .",
    "as both effects are coupled , there is not an easy way to decouple the effects of circumstellar and interstellar reddening .",
    "we propose an iterative procedure to determine both of them , which consist in the following steps :    * make a first aproximation of @xmath18 = @xmath0  2.63 .",
    "substitute this value in equations ( 10 ) and ( 11 ) to obtain @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "whit this values obtain @xmath6 and @xmath7 corrected for circumstellar excess .",
    "* whit the above @xmath6 and @xmath7 obtain the interstellar reddening and the intrinsic colours and indices , by means of the crawford ( 1978 ) procedure .",
    "* use the intrinsic @xmath3 index to estimate the value of @xmath19 by means of equation ( 9 ) . *",
    "make a new determination of @xmath18= @xmath24 .",
    "repeat all the procedure until convergence .",
    "the @xmath0 index is the main luminosity indicator for ob stars in the _",
    "uvby_@xmath0 photometric system . in the case of",
    "be stars , however , the @xmath0 index is contaminated by the circumstellar emission , and is not useful to estimate the luminosity . moreover , in the calibration method we are proposing , the @xmath0 index has been used to characterize the circumstellar emission and correct the other indices for circumstellar effects .",
    "there is not any other independent index which can be related with the stellar luminosity , and therefore there is not any way to directly determine the luminosity within our approach .",
    "it has to be considered , however , that the present calibration is to be applied to a rather narrow range of luminosity classes .",
    "when studying absorption - line ob stars , there is a wide range of variation of the @xmath0 index for a given @xmath3 , originated by the differences in the h@xmath0 line strenght between supergiants and main sequence stars .",
    "our calibration deals with be stars , which are , by definition , restricted to luminosity classes iii to v. as we stated in section 2 , within this range of luminosities the value of @xmath0 can be inferred from @xmath3 by means of equation ( 9 ) .",
    "then we propose to estimate the absolute magnitude of be stars from the @xmath3 index alone , by means of the following procedure :    * derive the @xmath19 value from @xmath3 by means of equation ( 9 ) .",
    "* substitute the values of @xmath3 and @xmath19 in the balona & shobbrook ( 1984 ) calibration of absolute magnitude .",
    "to estimate the accuracy of the above procedures we have computed the intrinsic indices , interstellar reddening and absolute magnitude for all the cluster be stars with available _",

    "we have compared the obtained reddening values with the mean reddening of each cluster , and the obtained @xmath1 with the value directly derived from the photometry and the cluster reddening and distance .",
    "we have used the same values for the clusters reddening and distance modulus as in paper i. references for these values are also given in paper i. the results are shown in table 1 . in table 2 we compare the mean values for each cluster obtained with our procedure and the values from the literature given in paper i. columns 4 and 5 are the mean values of the reddening and distance modulus obtained with the procedure presented in section 3 for all the be stars in each cluster with available _ uvby_@xmath0 photometry .",
