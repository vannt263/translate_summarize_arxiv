    "cloud radio access network ( c - ran ) is a promising architecture to address the challenging requirements for the fifth generation ( 5 g ) of wireless communication systems in terms of reduced deployment costs , high data rate and low power consumption @xcite . in a c - ran , a baseband processing unit ( bbu )",
    "implements the baseband processing functionalities of a set of remote radio heads ( rrhs ) that are connected to the bbu by means of fronthaul links .    in order to realize these potential benefits of centralized processing at the bbu ,",
    "it is necessary to deploy reliable and high - speed fronthaul links .",
    "nevertheless , cost and technological limitations dictate the use of fronthauling technologies , such as wireless microwave or mmwave , that fall short of the ideal requirements of high capacity and perfect reliability .",
    "this has led researchers in both industry and academia to investigate the impact of fronthaul _ capacity _ constraints on the spectral efficiency , see , e.g. , @xcite-@xcite , as well as the effect of fronthaul _ latency _ on higher - layer performance metrics @xcite ( see also review in @xcite ) .",
    "this letter contributes to this line of work by studying the implications of , and countermeasures to , the imperfect mutual _ synchronization _ of the rrhs that may result from non - ideal fronthaul connections to the cloud .",
    "illustration of a c - ran downlink with time offset.,width=489,height=205 ]    to this end , we consider the c - ran downlink system in fig . 1 in which the transmission of the two rrhs is characterized by a relative time offset , as well as by a phase offset .",
    "these offsets are unknown to the bbu and are generally caused by imperfections in the transmission and processing of clock - bearing signals on the fronthaul links @xcite .",
    "we specifically concentrate on the design of robust cooperative precoding strategies at the bbu across the two rrhs that account for the existing uncertainty regarding the inter - rrh time offset .",
    "the effect of the phase offset is also included in the model , but it is not the focus of the analysis of this letter .",
    "the presence of an unknown time offset generally precludes the use of cooperative precoding across the two rrhs , since the rrhs only have radio frequency functionalities and can not compensate for fronthaul inaccuracies . owing to the time offset ,",
    "the bbu can not control the correlation of the signals transmitted by the rrhs , which , in turn , makes it impossible to ensure the constructive superposition of the rrhs signals at the desired receivers .",
    "in fact , when the synchronization is imperfect , it may be beneficial to restrict transmission to non - cooperative strategies , as studied in @xcite .",
    "in this work , we introduce and design a robust asynchronous cooperation scheme for c - ran , which is motivated by the coding scheme proposed in @xcite in the context of an asynchronous cognitive multiple access channel . in",
    "the considered set - up , as detailed in sec .",
    "ii , the time offset is known by the bbu to lie in a bounded range . the main idea of the robust scheme , as discussed in sec .",
    "iii , is to correlate the signal to be transmitted by one rrh with different delayed versions of the signal to be transmitted by the other rrh . in this fashion ,",
    "no matter what the actual time offset is , partial correlation between the transmitted signals can be preserved and , with it , cooperative gains can be potentially accrued .",
    "we note that , at a fundamental level , the idea can be thought of as a robust scheme for communication on a compound channel @xcite . for this scheme",
    ", we tackle the problem of maximizing the worst - case minimum rate over the correlation matrices of the transmitted signals while satisfying the per - rrh power constraints in sec .",
    "v provides some numerical results that validate the advantages of the proposed robust scheme as compared to conventional cooperative and non - cooperative strategies .",
    "we consider the downlink of a c - ran shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : system - model ] , in which a bbu manages two rrhs that communicate with @xmath0 user equipments ( ues ) . specifically , by using its fronthaul connections to the rrhs , the bbu wishes to send a message @xmath1 to the @xmath2th ue , where @xmath3 and @xmath4 denote the rate of the message @xmath5 and the coding block length , which is assumed to be sufficiently large to invoke information - theoretic arguments .",
    "we denote the numbers of the antennas of the @xmath6th rrh and the @xmath2th ue as @xmath7 and @xmath8 , respectively , and define the sets @xmath9 and @xmath10 of the ues and rrhs , respectively .",
    "unlike previous works that investigated the impact of fronthaul capacity or latency limitations ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , we study the impact of _ asynchronism _ among the two rrhs , which is caused by non - ideal clock transfer or the fronthaul links .",
    "we model the lack of time synchronization with the baseline scenario in fig .",
    "[ fig : system - model ] , in which rrh 1 has a time offset of @xmath11 channel uses with respect to rrh 2 , where the amount @xmath11 is not known to the bbu .",
    "the bbu only knows that the delay @xmath11 belongs to an uncertainty set @xmath12 , where @xmath13 represents the worst - case delay . as in standard c - ran systems ,",
    "the rrhs have only radio frequency functionalities and hence are not able to compensate for any asynchronism .",
    "no further fronthaul limitations , such as in terms of capacity , are accounted for in the model .    under a flat fading channel model , the signal @xmath14 received by the @xmath2th ue on the @xmath15th channel use , @xmath16 ,",
    "is given as @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the signal transmitted by the @xmath6th rrh during the @xmath15th channel use ; @xmath19 is the channel matrix from the @xmath6th rrh to the @xmath2th ue ; @xmath20 denotes the phase offset between the rrhs , which is also assumed to be unknown to the bbu ; and @xmath21 is the additive noise vector distributed as @xmath22 .",
    "we assume that the channel matrices @xmath23 , the time offset @xmath11 and the phase offset @xmath20 remain constant during each coding block of @xmath4 channel uses , and impose per - rrh transmit power constraints as @xmath24 .",
    "as further detailed next , in this work , we focus on the design of cooperative linear precoding with the aim of ensuring robustness with respect to the time asynchronicity @xmath25 .",
    "the impact of the phase offset will be further studied in sec . [",
    "sec : numerical - results ] via numerical results .",
    "in this section , we describe the proposed asynchronous cooperative scheme for linear precoding across the two rrhs .",
    "the key idea of the proposed robust scheme is to make the signal @xmath26 transmitted by the rrh 2 correlated to both the current and the delayed versions @xmath27 of the transmit signal of rrh 1 .",
    "this follows the idea proposed in @xcite , in which a general information - theoretic formulation was provided in the context of an asynchronous cognitive channel .",
    "the result was then applied in @xcite to a system with _ single - antenna _ transceivers and a _ single _ user .",
    "as mentioned , the robust scheme is designed to counteract the unknown time offset @xmath11 , but it assumes no phase offset , i.e. , @xmath28 . note that , from now on , we do not explicitly indicate the dependence of the signals on the channel use index to simplify the notation .    to elaborate , for any channel use",

    "this represents @xmath31 consecutive symbols from the precoded signal transmitted by rrh 1 and intended for ue @xmath2 , with @xmath32 being the signal sent when @xmath33 .",
    "superimposing the signals intended for different ues , the signal @xmath34 transmitted by rrh 1 when the delay is @xmath11 is then given as @xmath35 the signal @xmath36 transmitted by rrh 2 is also given as the superposition of the signals @xmath37 intended for each ue @xmath2 as @xmath38 moreover , when the time offset is @xmath11 , the received signal vector @xmath39 of ue @xmath2 , denoted as @xmath40 , is given as @xmath41    the key property of the robust precoding scheme is that the signal @xmath42 transmitted by rrh 2 is correlated with the @xmath31 consecutive vectors @xmath43 , @xmath25 , each of which is sent by rrh 1 when the delay is @xmath11 .",
