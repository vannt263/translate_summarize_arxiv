    "coulomb correlations have been the focus of intense study for more than fifty years .",
    "weak coupling conditions , both classical and quantum , are now well understood .",
    "the more interesting and difficult conditions of strong coulomb coupling are well understood only in the limiting cases of zero temperature ( electrons ) and high temperatures ( classical ions ) . renewed interest in the intermediate cross - over domain between quantum and classical limits at arbitrary coupling has followed from new experimental studies of warm , dense matter \" @xcite , new theoretical approaches @xcite , and new path integral monte carlo simulations @xcite .",
    "the objective here is to explore this domain of finite temperatures for the case of charges in a harmonic trap under conditions where confinement , strong coupling , and quantum effects can appear together .",
    "of particular interest is the role of these conditions in the formation and characterization of shell structure .",
    "the approach here is to exploit classical many - body methods that treat coulomb coupling effectively , such as classical density functional theory @xcite , liquid state theory @xcite , or molecular dynamics simulation @xcite .",
    "it is necessary first to embed relevant quantum effects in a classical statistical mechanics .",
    "this has been shown to be an accurate and practical idea recently by perrot and dharma - wardana @xcite using liquid state theory , by introducing a pair potential modified to include exchange and diffraction effects and an effective temperature to admit a finite kinetic energy at zero temperature .",
    "this approach was formalized for a more precise context by two of the current authors @xcite , and a preliminary application to confined charges was described @xcite .",
    "this effective liquid state approach has proved accurate for the thermodynamics and structure of the uniform electron gas over a wide range of densities and temperatures @xcite .",
    "it is particularly useful for the problem posed here since there is now a rather complete study of the classical coulomb balls \" via liquid state theory and classical monte carlo simulations @xcite .",
    "once the effective quantum potentials and thermodynamic parameters are specified , these same methods can be applied directly to the questions of quantum effects on shell formation .",
    "that is the objective of the work presented here .    at equilibrium",
    "the harmonically confined system is specified by the average number of particles in the trap , @xmath1 , the temperature , @xmath2 , and the strength of the confining potential .",
    "the latter determines the volume of the system ( see below ) so that ultimately the harmonic potential parameters can be expressed in terms of the density and temperature . in the classical limit",
    ", all density and temperature dependence of dimensionless quantities occurs only through the classical coulomb coupling constant , @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the charge and @xmath5 is the wigner - seitz length related to the average global density @xmath6 by @xmath7 .",
    "it is a measure of the coulomb energy for a pair of charges relative to the average kinetic energy per particle , @xmath8 where @xmath9 . in the classical case",
    "the primary results are that shell structure ( peaks in the radial density profile ) appear only at sufficiently strong coupling ( @xmath10 ) and sharpen as the coupling increases .",
    "the number of shells is determined entirely by @xmath1 . a mean field description , without correlations , yields no shell structure at any value of @xmath11 .",
    "the equivalent classical system with quantum effects has a different behavior .",
    "initial study of a simple model @xcite  showed the emergence of a new origin for shell structure even at weaker coupling due to exchange effects on the shape of the confining potential . that simple model is reconsidered here in section [ sec3 ] .",
    "however , an improved model considered in section [ sec4 ] shows that mechanism to be significantly diminished @xcite .",
    "the objective here is to explore the onset and competition for all of the potential origins for shell structure - coulomb correlations , diffraction , exchange - as a function of the dimensionless density parameters @xmath12 ( where @xmath13 is the bohr radius in terms of the charge and mass of the confined particles ) and @xmath14 ( where @xmath15 is the ideal gas fermi energy per particle , again in terms of the confined particle s mass ) .    to explore the full range of systems of interest requires a wide range of values for @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",

    "the change in amplitude of the harmonic potential is a reflection of its enhancement relative to @xmath76 and is largely responsible for the increased confinement observed in all density profiles of figure [ fig.2 ] .",
    "as the shells are pulled inwards , this also tends to cause a population transfer to the outer shell .",
    "however , at the lowest temperatures the change in shape from the harmonic form becomes large .",
    "it is this distortion that is responsible for the onset of the new shell structure seen in figure [ fig.2 ] .",
    "this is confirmed in figure [ fig.4 ] which shows the superposition of the shell and the local distortion of the confining potential relative to its harmonic form .",
    "the origin of this distortion is the fermi statistics of the non - interacting particles which force the trap density to go to zero at a finite radius as @xmath136 ( appendix [ apb ] ) .",

    "the intermediate peak diminishes and the new shell at small @xmath146 grows as the temperature decreases until a single dominant peak is formed at the lowest temperature .",
    "in contrast , the outer and intermediate peaks of figure [ fig.5 ] change in a unified fashion as the overall density profile contracts with decreasing temperature .",
    "the two peak structure is maintained with only quantitative changes occurring due to quantum effects - no new shell structure is seen as in figure [ fig.2 ] . as indicated in ( [ 3.10a ] ) ,",
    "the quantum effects on the confining potential are an enhancement of the harmonic form and a distortion of that form .",
    "the distortion @xmath147 is now very much decreased by the inclusion of weak coulomb interactions in the determination of the classical confining potential , eliminating the new `` hard wall '' shell structure of figure [ fig.2 ] .",

    "these studies have been extended in the direction of additional quantum effects .",
    "the method chosen , an equivalent quantum system , allows inclusion of the diverse classical effects into an extension via effective pair potentials and effective confinement potentials .",
    "the quantum effects are included in the modification of these potentials from their classical coulomb and harmonic forms in a controlled way defined by the formalism of references @xcite .",
    "two approximate implementations of that formalism have been described . in both",
    ", the pair correlations among charges expressed by the direct correlation function @xmath76 are calculated from the classical hnc liquid state theory , known to be accurate for strong correlations , e.g. @xmath155 the qualitative effects of quantum mechanics are illustrated in figure [ fig.3]a .",
    "the first approximation for the effective confining potential is that which gives the exact quantum density profile for non - interacting charges . the result is a scaling of the original harmonic trap by a factor @xmath156 which tends to increase the confinement relative to the coulomb correlations .",
    "in addition there is a distortion of the harmonic form at low temperatures that produces a `` hard wall '' associated with the vanishing of the non - interacting density at a finite value of @xmath146 .",
    "this leads to a new shell structure not related to coulomb correlations .",
    "the second choice for the confining potential , described in section [ sec4 ] , is that which gives the density profile for a weak coupling quantum density functional calculation .",
    "this potential includes the effects of coulomb interactions .",
    "it has a similar scaling of the harmonic form , but no longer shows the strong distortion ( compare figures [ fig.3]b and [ fig.6 ] ) and hence no new shell structure .",

    "the choice of parameters @xmath157 was made to insure multiple shells in the reference classical limit .",
    "the brief consideration of @xmath158 in figure [ fig.7 ] confirms that there is no new shell structure induced solely by quantum effects .",
    "clearly there is more to be done with this classical description of a quantum system , such as @xmath159 and much smaller @xmath1 to make direct connection with the literature on quantum dots . presumably , for such conditions the local density approximation will need to be relaxed .",
