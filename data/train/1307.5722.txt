    "the standard - model extension@xcite ( sme ) consists of the most general observer - independent effective field theory incorporating lorentz violation .",
    "it is routinely used by both theorists and experimentalists to study and obtain bounds on possible forms of lorentz violation.@xcite as an effective field theory , the sme can accommodate both explicit and spontaneous lorentz breaking . however , there are differences in these two forms of symmetry breaking that arise in the context of gravity .",
    "this overview looks at these differences and what their primary consequences are .    in a gravitational theory with lorentz violation",
    "it is useful to use a vierbein formalism . in this approach ,",
    "both the local lorentz frames and spacetime frames are accessible and linkage between the symmetries in these frames can be examined .",
    "the vierbein provides the connection between tensor components in local lorentz frames and tensor components in the spacetime frame .",
    "the lagrangian in the sme is formed as the most general scalar function ( under both local lorentz and diffeomorphism transformations ) using gravitational fields , particle fields , and lorentz - violating sme coefficients .",
    "when the lorentz breaking is explicit , the sme coefficients are viewed as fixed background fields . however ,",
    "when the lorentz breaking is spontaneous , the sme coefficients are vacuum expectation values ( vevs ) of dynamical tensor fields .    in the gravity sector of the sme",
    ", a no - go theorem shows that with explicit lorentz breaking an inconsistency can occur between conditions stemming from the field variations and symmetry considerations with geometrical constraints that must hold , such as the bianchi identities.@xcite in contrast , the case of spontaneous lorentz breaking was found to evade the no - go theorem .",
    "the main difference is that in a theory with explicit breaking the sme coefficients are not associated with dynamical fields , while with spontaneous lorentz breaking they are , which creates a difference in the conditions that must hold .",
    "an important consequence of the no - go theorem is that the gravity sector of the sme can only avoid incompatibility with conventional geometrical constraints if the symmetry breaking is spontaneous .",
    "the fact that the sme coefficients must be associated with vevs of dynamical fields that undergo spontaneous lorentz violation leads to a number of effects that must be accounted for in the gravity sector of the sme .",
    "for example , when lorentz symmetry is spontaneously broken , there is also spontaneous breaking of diffeomorphism symmetry .",
    "the spontaneous lorentz breaking occurs when a nonzero tensor - valued vacuum occurs in the local lorentz frames , which is necessarily accompanied by a vacuum value for the vierbein .",
    "when products of the vierbein vev act on the local tensor vevs , the result is that tensor vevs also appear in the spacetime frame .",
    "these tensor vevs spontaneously break local diffeomorphisms in the spacetime frame .",
    "conversely , if a vev in the spacetime frame spontaneously breaks diffeomorphisms , then the inverse vierbein acting on it gives rise to vevs in the local frames .",
    "consequently , spontaneous local lorentz breaking implies spontaneous diffeomorphism breaking and vice versa.@xcite    with spontaneous symmetry breaking of both lorentz and diffeomorphism symmetry , there are standard features in particle physics that need to be investigated .",
    "these include the possible appearance of massless nambu - goldstone ( ng ) modes and massive higgs modes , or there is the possibility of a higgs mechanism in which the ng modes are reinterpreted as additional degrees of freedom in a theory with massive gauge fields .    in the absence of a higgs mechanism",
    ", there can be up to as many ng modes as there are broken spacetime symmetries .",
    "since the maximal symmetry - breaking case would yield six broken lorentz generators and four broken diffeomorphisms , there can be as many as ten ng modes .",
    "a natural gauge choice puts all of the ng modes into the vierbein .",
    "however , this will in general lead to the appearance of ghosts , and it is for this reason that most models involve breaking fewer than ten of the spacetime symmetries .",
    "spontaneous symmetry breaking is usually induced by a potential term in the lagrangian that has a degenerate minimum space .",
    "the ng modes appear as excitations away from the vacuum that stay in the minimum space , while massive higgs modes are excitations that go up the potential well away from the minimum . in conventional gauge theory , the potential involves only scalar fields , and the massive higgs modes are independent of the gauge fields .",
    "however , with spontaneous lorentz breaking , the metric typically appears in the potential along with the tensor fields , and for this reason massive higgs modes can occur that include metric excitations .",
    "this is an effect that has no analog in the case of conventional gauge theory .    in a higgs mechanism , the would - be ng modes become additional degrees of freedom for massive gauge fields .",
    "the gauge fields associated with diffeomorphisms are the metric excitations .",
    "however , a higgs mechanism involving the metric has been shown not to occur.@xcite this is because the mass term that is generated by covariant derivatives involves the connection , which consists of derivatives of the metric and not the metric itself .",
    "however , for the broken lorentz symmetry , where the relevant gauge fields are the spin connection , a conventional higgs mechanism can occur.@xcite this is because the spin connection appears directly in covariant derivatives acting on local tensor components , and when the local tensors acquire a vev , quadratic mass terms for the spin connection can be generated .",
    "note , however , a viable higgs mechanism involving the spin connection can only occur if the spin connection is a dynamical field , which requires nonzero torsion and that the geometry be riemann - cartan ."
