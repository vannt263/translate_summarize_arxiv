    "however , for coupling constants @xmath31 of the above order of magnitude one still needs to construct a suitable mechanism that is able to suppress isocurvature fluctuations @xcite .",

    "we may thus write @xmath140 in squids a flux perturbation @xmath44 is measurable and equivalent to an angle perturbation @xmath43 of the phase difference in the squid ( see eq .",

    "indeed , nothing is known about the electric field @xmath125 involved , except that it must be non - zero ( otherwise one would have @xmath146 , i.e. no perturbation ) and that it must point in the same direction as @xmath126 . also , the area @xmath138 through which the magnetic field is assumed to penetrate is somewhat arbitrary , it can be the area enclosed by the squid but it could also be an arbitrary area different from the squid area , much bigger or much smaller .",
    "the only thing that matters is the ratio @xmath145 .",
    "as @xmath138 is not specified , @xmath147 is not specified either .",
    "there is , however , a condition of constraint .",
    "namely , axion physics is invariant under the transformation @xmath148 , as the cosine potential of the axion is periodic with period @xmath149 .",
    "moreover , also squid physics is invariant under the transformation @xmath150 , as only the phase modulo @xmath149 of the macroscopic wave function matters .",
    "whatever the interaction between squids and axions , performing both transformations simultaneously should not change the physics .",
    "if we transform equation ( [ c ] ) in this simultaneous way , we get @xmath151 since @xmath152 we thus obtain @xmath153 which proves our final result , @xmath154",
    "an interesting future project for experimental measurements would be to get more precise information on the initial misalignment angle @xmath58 from precision measurements of the low - frequency part of the flux noise intensity . as said before , from a theoretical point of view the angle",
    "@xmath58 is constant ( though with an arbitrary value in @xmath155 $ ] ) in models where pq symmetry breaks before inflation , apart from small quantum mechanical fluctuations .",
    "however , in models where pq symmetry breaking occurs after inflation , and where the relevant axion is the qcd axion , @xmath58 has spatial fluctuations of @xmath156 on a scale of the order of @xmath157 m @xcite .",
    "this is the qcd horizon scale expanded to the current scale of the universe .",
    "this means that if the earth moves through the axionic condensate with velocity @xmath100 it will be surrounded by a new value of @xmath58 roughly every @xmath158s , which corresponds to a time scale of 23 days .",
    "this can be experimentally checked .",
    "if these spatial inhomogenities in @xmath58 are still conserved , then the measured flux noise intensity should show significant changes if the identical measurement is performed , say , a month or a year later .",
    "the long - term average value ( over a time scale of years ) of the flux noise amplitude is still given by eq .",
    "( [ 888 ] ) , i.e. by the value @xmath159 ( or some slightly higher value , if non - uniform averaging is performed @xcite ) , but the concrete value of noise amplitude measured at a given time can take on different values between @xmath160 and the maximum value @xmath161 , the measured value being constant on a time scale of about a month until a new value is realized .",
    "stochastic processes of the above type , with a variance that changes on a long time scale , are called ` superstatistical ' in the statistical mechanics community @xcite . from an experimental point of view",
    ", a superstatistical flux noise intensity may look quite peculiar : a flux noise signal strength once measured is different if the experiment is repeated a month later under identical conditions .",
    "this may look like a result that is ` not reproducible ' to the person who performs the measurements . but for a qcd axionic dark matter background fluctuations of o(1 ) in @xmath58 on a time scale of months are possible , in principle at least , for models where pq symmetry breaking occurs after inflation .",
    "however , as said before , other types of axion - like particles and other types of models can be relevant for generating the flux noise , it need not be the qcd axion . in any case , future precision measurement of the initial misalignment angle @xmath58 from low - frequency flux noise spectra and a check of any possible long - time variation would be extremely helpful for theoretical model building ."

    "<S> the predicted form of the spectrum is in excellent agreement with the recent experimental observations of @xcite ; this agreement is achieved without fitting any parameters . </S>",
    "<S> in fact the only relevant parameter involved for the cosmological flux noise is the initial misalignment angle @xmath33 $ ] , which is of utmost importance to theoretically calculate the fraction @xmath85 of axionic dark matter in the universe @xcite . as shown in this paper , </S>",
    "<S> @xmath58 can be extracted from precision measurements of the flux noise intensity . </S>",
    "<S> the results of the various experimental groups @xcite@xcite point to a value @xmath86 , compatible with the cosmologically expected average value 1.8 . </S>",
    "<S> we propose that future systematic experimental tests should aim to separate universal from non - universal ( material and device dependent ) effects . </S>",
    "<S> the universal low - frequency part of the flux noise spectrum may open up a new experimental window to measure power spectra of primordial fluctuations , to provide high - precision estimates of @xmath58 , and to ultimately confirm the existence of an axionic dark matter background surrounding the earth .      </S>",
