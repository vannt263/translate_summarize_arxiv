    "nuclear mass plays an important role not only in studying the knowledge of nuclear structure  @xcite , but also in understanding the origin of elements in the universe  @xcite . with the construction and",
    "upgrade of radioactive ion beam facilities , the measurements of nuclear masses have made great progress in recent years . during the last decade",
    ", hundreds of nuclear masses were measured for the first time or with higher precisions  @xcite .",
    "the astrophysical calculations involve thousands of nuclei far from @xmath2-stability line . however , most of these nuclei are still beyond the experimental reach",
    ". one could use the local mass relations such as the garvey - kelson ( gk ) relations  @xcite and the residual proton - neutron interactions  @xcite to predict unknown masses .",
    "however , the intrinsic error grows rapidly when the local mass relations are used to predict the nuclear masses in an iterative way  @xcite .",
    "therefore , the theoretical predictions for nuclear masses are inevitable to astrophysical calculations .",
    "the early theoretical studies of nuclear masses are mainly macroscopic models , such as the famous weizscker mass formula  @xcite .",
    "it is known that this kind of mass model neglects the microscopic effects , and hence shows systematic deviations for the nuclei near the shell closure or those with large deformations . in order to better describe the nuclear ground - state properties ,",
    "the macroscopic - microscopic and microscopic theoretical models are developed for mass predictions .    by including the microscopic correction energy to the macroscopic mass formula , the macroscopic - microscopic mass model can well take into account the important microscopic corrections . during the past decades ,",
    "a number of macroscopic - microscopic mass models have been developed , such as the finite - range droplet model ( frdm )  @xcite , the extended thomas - fermi plus strutinsky integral ( etfsi )  @xcite , and the koura - tachibana - uno - yamada ( ktuy )  @xcite .",
    "these macroscopic - microscopic mass models have similar accuracy for mass prediction and their the root - mean - square ( rms ) deviation with respect to data in the atomic mass evaluation of 2012 ( ame12 )  @xcite is about @xmath3 mev .",
    "guiding by the skyrme energy density functional , a semiempirical nuclear mass formula , the weizscker - skyrme ( ws ) model , was proposed based on the macroscopic - microscopic method  @xcite . for the latest version of ws model ( ws3 )  @xcite , the rms deviation with respect to @xmath4 known nuclear masses in ame12 is significantly reduced to @xmath5 mev .",
    "on the other hand , great progress has been achieved for microscopic mass models with the rapid development of the computer technology in the new century .",
    "based on the hartree - fock - bogoliubov ( hfb ) theory with skyrme or gogny force , a series of microscopic mass models have been proposed with the accuracy comparable with the traditional macroscopic - microscopic mass models  @xcite .",
    "apart from the non - relativistic microscopic model , the relativistic mean - field ( rmf ) model has also received wide attention due to many successes achieved in describing lots of nuclear phenomena  @xcite as well as successful applications in astrophysics  @xcite .",
    "a systematic study of the ground - state properties for all nuclei from the proton drip line to the neutron drip line with @xmath6 and @xmath7 was performed for such model several years ago , and the rms deviation with respect to known masses is about @xmath8 mev  @xcite .",
    "however , it should be noted that the effective interaction of this rmf mass model was only optimized with the properties of a few selected nuclei . by carefully adjusting the effective interaction of rmf model with the properties of more selected nuclei ,",
    "the deviation can be remarkably reduced . for the @xmath9",
    "even - even nuclei with @xmath10 , the rms deviation with respect to known masses in atomic mass evaluation of 2003 ( ame03 ) is reduced to @xmath11 mev for the effective interaction pc - pk1  @xcite . moreover , the pc - pk1 predictions well reproduce the new and accurate mass measurements from sn to pa  @xcite with the rms deviation of @xmath12 mev  @xcite , and also successfully describe the coulomb displacement energies between mirror nuclei  @xcite .",
    "in addition , inspired by the shell model , the duflo - zuker ( dz ) mass model  @xcite has made considerable success in describing nuclear masses with accuracy of about @xmath13 mev .",
    "although these theoretical models can well reproduce the experimental data , there are still large deviations among the mass predictions of different models , even in the region close to known masses .",
    "a number of investigations on the accuracy and predictive power of these nuclear mass models have been made so far in the literatures , e.g. refs .",
    "@xcite . to further improve the accuracy of nuclear mass model , the image reconstruction techniques based on the fourier transform",
    "is applied to the nuclear mass models and significantly reduces the rms deviation to the known masses with the clean algorithm  @xcite .",
    "later on , the radial basis function ( rbf ) approach was developed to improve the mass predictions of several theoretical models  @xcite . comparing with the clean reconstruction ,",
    "the rbf approach more effectively reduces the rms deviations with respect to the masses first appearing in ame03  @xcite .    to improve the mass prediction of a nucleus",
    ", thousands of nuclei with known masses are involved in the rbf approach  @xcite . however , do all the nuclei involved play effective roles in the improvement of mass prediction for this nucleus ? what are the key nuclei that have to be included in the rbf approach ?",
    "in other words , how far away from the measured region of nuclear mass could we predict with satisfactory accuracy in the rbf approach ?",
    "these questions were not addressed in previous investigations  @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is interesting to investigate the mass correlations between a certain nucleus and those nuclei involved in the rbf approach , and hence to evaluate the predictive power of the rbf approach .    in this work , we will carefully evaluate the predictive power of the rbf approach based on @xmath0 widely used nuclear mass models , ranging from macroscopic - microscopic to microscopic types .",
    "special attention will be paid to the mass correlations among various nuclei .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , a brief introduction to the rbf approach including numerical details is given . in sec .",
    "iii , the mass correlations are first carefully investigated , and then the predictive power of the rbf approach based on different mass models will be evaluated .",
    "finally , the summary is presented in sec .",
    "the rbf approach has been widely applied in surface reconstruction and its solution is written as @xmath14 where @xmath15 denotes the point from measurement , @xmath16 is the weight of center @xmath15 , @xmath17 is the radial basis function , @xmath18 is the euclidean norm , and @xmath19 is the number of the data to be fitted . given @xmath19",
    "samples @xmath20 , one wishes to reconstruct the smooth function @xmath21 with @xmath22 , i.e. , @xmath23 where @xmath24 . then the rbf weights are determined to be @xmath25 once the weights are obtained with the @xmath19 samples @xmath20 , the reconstructed function @xmath21 can be calculated with eq .",
    "( [ eq : sx ] ) for any point @xmath26 .    as in ref .",
    "@xcite , the euclidean norm is defined to be the distance between nuclei @xmath27 and @xmath28 in nuclear chart : @xmath29 the basis function @xmath30 is adopted in this work , since the mass deviation can be reconstructed relatively better with @xmath30 than other basis functions  @xcite",
    ". then the mass difference @xmath31 between the experimental data @xmath32 and those predicted with nuclear mass models @xmath33 could be reconstructed with eq .",
    "( [ eq : dx ] ) .",
    "once the weights are obtained , the reconstructed function @xmath34 can be calculated with eq .",
    "( [ eq : sx ] ) for any nucleus @xmath35 .",
    "then the revised mass for nucleus @xmath35 is given by @xmath36 for training the rbf with eq .",
    "( [ eq : dx ] ) , only those nuclei between the minimum distance @xmath37 and maximum distance @xmath38 are involved , i.e. @xmath39 . if the reconstructed function @xmath34 for a nucleus is obtained by training the rbf including itself , i.e. @xmath40 , it is clear that @xmath34 is just the @xmath41 and hence @xmath42 .",
    "therefore , to test the predictive power of rbf approach , the function @xmath34 for a known nucleus should be reconstructed with @xmath43 .    to evaluate the predictive power of rbf approach , the rms deviation , i.e. , @xmath44 is employed , where @xmath45 and @xmath46 are the theoretical and experimental nuclear masses , respectively , and @xmath47 is the number of nuclei contained in a given set . in this investigation , we only consider nuclei with @xmath48 and @xmath49 and the experimental data are taken from ame12  @xcite , unless otherwise specified . for the theoretical mass models , we take rmf  @xcite , hfb-21  @xcite , dz10  @xcite , dz31  @xcite , etfsi-2  @xcite , ktuy  @xcite , frdm  @xcite , and ws3  @xcite mass models as examples , with the rms deviation spanning from @xmath50 mev to @xmath51 mev with respect to experimental data in ame12 . for convenience ,",
    "the @xmath52 and @xmath53 of nuclear mass models are denoted as @xmath54 and @xmath55 , hereafter .",
    ".the rms deviations in mev between known masses in ame12 and predictions of various nuclear mass models without ( the second column ) and with ( the third column ) the rbf approach .",
    "the fourth column gives the reduction of the rms deviations after combining the rbf approach . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     .",
    "the squares and circles represent the experimental uncertainties in ame03 and ame12 , respectively.,title=\"fig:\",width=283 ] +    by using the systematic trends in the mass surface and its derivative , the mass evaluation method in ame provides the best short - range mass extrapolation  @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is interesting to compare the accuracy between the rbf approach and the method used in ame . taking the nuclei whose",
    "masses are evaluated values in ame03 ( marked by  # \" in the mass table of ame03 ) as an example , the rms deviations with respect to the new experimental data in ame12 are @xmath56 mev . for comparison with the method in ame at the same foot , the experimental data employed in training the rbf should be taken from ame03 as well , and the corresponding results based on different mass models are given in the third column of table  [ tb2 ] .",
    "in addition , the rms deviations @xmath57 for these nuclei are given in the second column of table  [ tb2 ] .",
    "clearly , the rbf approach also remarkably improves the predictive power of various mass models .",
    "it should be pointed out that the rms deviation @xmath58 based on the ws3 mass model is even smaller than that from the method in ame . in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] , the experimental uncertainties in ame12 and ame03 are presented as a function of the isospin asymmetry @xmath59 . it is found that the experimental uncertainties are significantly improved in ame12 comparing with those in ame03 , especially for those nuclei around the border region of experimental data with @xmath60 and @xmath61 . therefore , we further update the data in training the rbf with those in ame12 and the corresponding results are shown in the fourth column of table  [ tb2 ] .",
    "it is clear that @xmath58 can be significantly reduced for most mass models .",
    "based on the ws3 mass model , the predictive accuracy has been reduced to @xmath62 mev .",
    "therefore , the new high - precision experimental data are also very important to improve the nuclear mass models with rbf approach .     based on the measured masses in the ame12 for the rmf [ panel ( a ) ] and ws3 [ panel ( b ) ] mass models .",
    "the dotted lines denote the magic numbers.,title=\"fig:\",width=321 ] +     between those based on the measured masses in the ame12 and those based on the measured masses in ame03 .",
    "the panels ( a ) and ( b ) correspond to the rmf and ws mass models , respectively .",
    "the  new \" nuclei in ame12 are indicated by the black contours.,title=\"fig:\",width=321 ] +    to investigate the radial basis function corrections in detail , the reconstructed functions @xmath34 based on the measured masses in the ame12 are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] by taking the rmf and ws3 mass models as examples .",
    "it is clear that the reconstructed functions are sensitive to the the nuclear mass models . for the rmf mass model ,",
    "the @xmath34 are about @xmath63 mev for the nuclei near @xmath64 , @xmath65 , @xmath66 , and @xmath67 .",
    "this just corresponds to the nuclei whose masses are underestimated in the rmf model  @xcite .",
    "moreover , the overestimation of nuclear masses in the regions near @xmath68 and @xmath69 in rmf model are also well improved by the rbf approach with the @xmath70 mev in these two regions . for the ws3 mass model",
    ", it better describes the nuclear masses than the rmf mass model , while there still exists small but systematically correlated errors  @xcite . with the rbf approach",
    ", these systematic correlations can be well extracted as well . to further investigate the influence of the  new \" masses in ame12 on improving the nuclear mass models with the rbf approach , the differences of the reconstructed functions @xmath71 between those based on the measured masses in the ame12 and those based on the measured masses in ame03 are shown in fig .",
    "it is found that the differences of reconstructed functions @xmath71 are generally within @xmath72 kev for most nuclei , while it is relatively larger for those nuclei around the border region of experimental data , especially for those  new \" nuclei in ame12 . this can be well understood since",
    "significant improvements in the mass measurements are made for nuclei near the border region in recent years  @xcite .",
    "therefore , the rbf approach is sensitive to the experimental masses and it is necessary to adopt the high - precision experimental data to improve the nuclear mass models .",
    "in this work , the mass correlations in the radial basis function ( rbf ) approach are carefully investigated based on @xmath0 widely used nuclear mass models , ranging from macroscopic - microscopic to microscopic types .",
    "the mass correlations usually exist between a nucleus and its surrounding nuclei with distance @xmath73 .",
    "however , the correlation distance is dependent on the nuclear mass models , which can go up to the distance of @xmath74 for the mass models with larger rms deviations , such as the rmf model . to extract these mass correlations",
    ", it is shown that the nuclei at distance @xmath75 are necessary to include in the training of rbf approach . in this way",
    ", the rbf approach can make significant improvements in the mass predictions for different mass models .",
    "the ame95 - 03 - 12 test further shows that the rbf approach provides a very effective tool to improve mass predictions significantly in regions not far from known nuclear masses .",
    "based on the latest weizscker - skyrme mass model , the rbf approach can achieve an accuracy comparable with the extrapolation method used in atomic mass evaluation , which can be further improved by the incorporation of new measurements . as claimed in the introduction , the effective interaction pc - pk1 remarkably improves the mass prediction of the rmf model .",
    "therefore , it is interesting to investigate the predictive power of pc - pk1 mass model with the help of rbf approach when the calculated masses with pc - pk1 for all nuclei in ame12 are available in the future .",
    "in addition , considering the success in improving the nuclear mass predictions , the rbf approach has a great potential to improve theoretical calculations of other physical quantities , such as nuclear @xmath2-decay half - lives , fission barriers , and excitation spectra .",
