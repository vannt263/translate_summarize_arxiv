    "the cold dark matter scenario of the cosmic structure formation predicts that clusters of galaxies are formed via collisions and mergers of smaller groups and clusters . as shown by numerical simulations , merging plays a critical role in the cluster evolution .",
    "x - ray observations have provided many pieces of evidences for cluster mergers , through imaging infalling subclusters and disturbed , irregular morphologies of intracluster medium ( icm ) ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , even in apparently relaxed clusters , discontinuous icm structures so - called `` cold fronts '' are sometimes found from the chandra observations .",
    "the cold fronts are interpreted as contact discontinuity caused by the subcluster collisions @xcite .",
    "although the morphological data are accumulating , the physical states of the icm , particularly the ionization equilibrium state and the kinematics , are yet to be clarified .    in the study of the dynamical evolution of clusters",
    ", we will focus on the cluster outer regions since they are expected to contain important information on the formation process .",
    "the cluster outskirts are connected to the surrounding large - scale structure , where the gas is falling towards the cluster potential and possibly subject to shock heating . once disturbed by the subcluster collisions , it should take long time for the gas to settle due to the low density and large spatial size .",
    "therefore , the outskirts of merging clusters offer us opportunities to look into the gas in its transition to the thermal and ionization equilibriums .    recent x - ray studies with suzaku showed temperature structure of icm to the virial radius ( @xmath0 ) for several relaxed clusters @xcite .",
    "the results show a systematic drop of temperature by a factor of @xmath5 from the center to @xmath0 .",
    "also , the entropy shows a flattening or a small drop , after a monotonous increase with radius , around the outermost region .",
    "it has been interpreted as the deviation between electron and ion temperatures in this region .",
    "numerical simulations for relaxed clusters also suggest that the outskirts of clusters are not in hydrostatic equilibrium ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "compared with the relaxed clusters , however , there is little information about the icm properties in the outer regions of merging clusters . in those dynamically - young systems ,",
    "the icm are thought to be in the early stage of thermal relaxation .",
    "thus , the x - ray observations of merging clusters and comparisons with the relaxed clusters will give us new , valuable information on the icm properties at large radii and help us to draw the global picture of formation and evolution of clusters .",
    "the surface brightness around the cluster virial radius is much lower than the central region ( typically , by a factor of @xmath6 ) .",
    "thus , the detailed estimation of foreground and background emission as well as careful assessment of all the systematic errors is important in this kind of study .",
    "the xis instrument on suzaku has a low and stable background and the behavior of the non - x - ray background ( nxb ) is well known @xcite , which makes xis the most suitable for the study of the cluster outer regions .",
    "an additional science at cluster outer regions is the search for the warm - hot intergalactic medium ( whim ) .",
    "the filamentary structure of the local universe has been probed mainly through galaxy distribution ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "its detailed structure would be directly observed by the whim , which has temperature of @xmath7 k and contains more than half of baryons in the local universe ( e.g.  @xcite ) . because of its extreme faintness , detailed observations of the whim will be the subject of future high - resolution x - ray studies .",
    "the gas density and chemical composition of the whim are still poorly known both theoretically and observationally .",
    "the cluster outskirts are the regions where the icm is connected to the whim and will enable us to place observational constraints about the whim properties . as shown , by e.g. , @xcite , suzaku xis is able to set strong constraints about the redshifted oxygen emission .",
    "abell 2142 ( a2142 , @xmath8 ) is a bright cluster of galaxies , having a high icm temperature of @xmath9  kev .",
    "this object is also known as the first cluster in which the cold fronts have been detected @xcite .",
    "the cold fronts in the south and the northwest are @xmath10 ( or 70  kpc ) and @xmath11 ( or 270  kpc ) off of the cluster center , respectively , and a sharp surface - brightness drop by a factor of about 2 is seen .",
    "since the temperature and density distributions suggest that the pressure is constant across the cold front , it is considered as a contact discontinuity .",
    "the presence of these structures naturally indicates that a2142 is a merger and the subcluster infall seems to be occurring along the northwest  southeast direction .",
    "actually the overall cluster emission is elongated in this direction .",
    "this is likely to coincide with the large - scale structure , and the matter density seems to be enhanced along the filament .",
    "a2142 is also suitable for the search of emission lines from the whim .",
    "given the cluster redshift of @xmath12 , the ovii line ( the rest - frame energy of 0.65  kev ) is shifted to 0.57  kev and then falls into a gap between the galactic ovii line energy and the instrumental line features .",
    "therefore , it makes it possible to distinguish the whim emission from the local one .",
    "in addition , because the redshift of a2142 is not too high , the oxygen line from the whim can be measured with good sensitivity . with these purposes ,",
    "we have carried out suzaku observations of the northwest offset regions of a2142 .    in this paper",
    ", we will use @xmath13 km s@xmath14 mpc@xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "this cosmology leads to 100.4 kpc per arcmin at @xmath8 . the virial radius approximated by @xmath17 , with @xmath18 @xcite . for our cosmology and redshift ,",
    "@xmath0 is 2.48 mpc ( @xmath19 ) with @xmath20 kev . in this paper",
    ", we adopted the solar abundance defined by @xcite and the galactic @xmath21 by @xcite .",

    "we observed abell  2142 in the direction of the possible merger axis with suzaku and detected the icm emission up to the virial radius @xmath0 ( 2.5 mpc @xmath22 ) .",
    "we derived radial profiles of temperature , electron density , and entropy , and compared these properties with the previous results for other relaxed clusters .",
    "we summarize the main features of a2142 as follows ;    * the icm temperature gradually decreases toward the outer region from about 10 kev at @xmath23 to about 4 kev at @xmath0 .",
    "* the temperature profile in the outer region of a2142 agrees well with the results of other clusters observed by suzaku . *",
    "the average temperature profile for different clusters can be described by the formula by @xcite up to @xmath0 , suggesting that non - thermal pressure support is significant in the outer regions . *",
    "the electron density profile decreases down to @xmath24 at the virial radius and well agrees with the @xmath1 model with @xmath2 . *",
    "the entropy profile within about @xmath25 follows @xmath4 , predicted by the accretion shock heating model .",
    "the profile becomes flatter and finally shows a negative slope around @xmath0 , suggesting significant deviation from the equilibrium condition .",
    "* based on the temperature and entropy profiles , and required relaxation time , we discuss that @xmath26 is likely higher than @xmath27 in the outer region of a2142 . *",
    "the derived mass profile is in agreement with the weak - lensing mass .",
    "the difference between x - ray and lensing masses allowed by the error can explain the contribution of the non - equilibrium effect .",
    "resent suzaku results on the temperature and entropy measurements to @xmath0 , including the a2142 ones , jointly suggest that icm in cluster outskirts is deviating from thermal equilibrium in the sense that the electron temperature could be significantly lower than the ion temperature .",
    "this suggests that the icm around @xmath0 has experienced bulk motions and/or turbulence within a time scale of about @xmath28 yr .",
    "such gas motions with a velocity of a few hundred to thousand km s@xmath14 can be observable in future by x - ray microcalorimeters , such as by sxs instrument on astro - h @xcite which has 2030 times higher energy resolution than ccd instruments . since the fov of sxs is rather small ( @xmath29 ) ,",
    "expected counts from fe - k lines are typically around 10 and 60 at @xmath0 and @xmath30 , respectively , for a 300 ksec exposure .",
    "therefore , long exposures for selected good targets with astro - h will be needed to show the dynamical features appearing in the cluster outer regions for the first time .",
