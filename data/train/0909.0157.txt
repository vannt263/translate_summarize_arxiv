    "since arlo landolt s ( 1968 ) discovery of the first dav we have learned much about pulsating white dwarfs .",
    "they are otherwise normal white dwarf stars , and they represent the final stage of about 98% of the stars ( see the recent review of @xcite and references therein ) , so it is a key issue to gain insight into their interiors . while white dwarfs are relatively simple to model , some observed phenomena still challenge theory .",
    "one unsolved mystery is the variability of the pulsational modes amplitudes and frequencies of pnnv , cool dbv and cool dav stars @xcite . while we can find very stable modes in certain white dwarfs which can be used to measure evolutionary effects ( cooling and/or contraction , e.g. hot davs g117-b15a and r548  ` the most stable optical clocks known ' : mukadam , kepler & winget 2001 and references therein ) , in some cases short - term variabilities make it difficult to determine even the pulsational modes .",
    "an example for this latter is the case of pg 1115 + 158 ( dbv ) with its remarkably unstable amplitude spectra @xcite .    in some cases we encounter strange , sudden , short - term variations in the pulsational behaviours of stars : for example the ` sforzando '",
    "effect observed in the dbv star gd 358 in 1996 , where the nonlinear light curve of the star changed into a high amplitude , remarkably sinusoidal one for a short period of time ( @xcite , @xcite ) . in the case of pg 1456 + 103 its luminosity variations almost disappeared just before the whole earth telescope ( wet , @xcite ) run started on the star @xcite .",
    "the frequency and amplitude variations of multiplet components ( mostly for high @xmath7 modes ) observed in gd 358 @xcite are further examples for short - term variations .",
    "possible explanations for these observed phenomena could be non - linear mode coupling , convection / pulsation interactions , mode excitation , and beating of different pulsation modes  such as unresolved rotational splitting . to find the right explanation(s ) for a certain case",
    "is a great challenge .",
    "a crucial first step is to identify the periods of the true pulsation modes of a white dwarf .",
    "one possible way of mode identification when strong amplitude variations occur is to observe the star in many seasons , determine all the observed periods from the different runs and search for the ( nearly ) equidistant period spacings among them , which can be consecutive overtones with the same horizontal degree ( @xmath8 ) value .",
    "@xcite used this method for the first time for a dav star ( g29 - 38 ) where recurring sets of normal modes were identified .    since kuv 02464 + 3239",
    "was found to be a luminosity variable da star near the red edge of the dav instability strip @xcite , we expect to find the short - term variabilities which characterize the pulsation of similar stars . using a 2900s - long light curve , @xcite determined a quasi - period of @xmath9832s for the star s light variation . the long period , large amplitude variations they found with strongly non - sinusoidal light curve along with the presence of harmonic peaks in the frequency spectrum are consistent with the behaviour of a cool dav star .",
