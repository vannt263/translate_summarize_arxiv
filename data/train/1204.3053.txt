    "giant gamma - ray flares are thought to be produced by a large - scale rearrangement of the super - strong magnetic field of a magnetar @xcite .",
    "the large amount of energy released during a flare ( @xmath010@xmath1erg ) likely triggers large - scale vibrations and quakes in the star s crust @xcite .",
    "the observation of strong , long - lived quasi - periodic oscillations ( qpos ) in the decay tails of the giant flares of sgr 1900 + 14 and sgr 180620 has been interpreted as evidence of such starquakes ( @xcite ; hereafter sw06 ) , and much theoretical work has subsequently focused on the physics of starquakes themselves ( e.g.,@xcite , for a recent review see @xcite ) .",
    "comparatively little work has focused on how the physical motion of the crust translates into a detectable qpo ( although see @xcite ) .",
    "this is not a trivial question : some of the qpos have rms fractional amplitudes of up to 20% of the total flux in a pulse , whereas the maximum predicted amplitude of a starquake ( assuming the oscillation is restricted to the crust ) is about @xmath2 ( where @xmath3 is the stellar radius ) .",
    "a persistent starquake will more likely have an amplitude at least 10@xmath4 smaller ( @xcite ; m. gabler , 2012 private communication ) .",
    "a solution could come from the steeply peaked pulse profile in the magnetar tail ( see the pulse profile for sgr 180620 in figure  [ fig : ps_rxte ] ) .",
    "the observed qpos are phase dependent , and are sometimes centered on the steep edge of the pulse ( e.g. , figure 3 of @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite suggested that beamed emission could enhance the observed strength of an underlying oscillation .",
    "as the beam edge sweeps through the observer s line of sight , the underlying starquake will cause the edge to wiggle in and out of the observer s line of sight and amplify the signal .",
    "in this letter we use a toy model for the emission to quantify the effect that the pulse shape will have on an underlying small - amplitude oscillation . the observed oscillation depends strongly both on the pulse profile and its orientation on the surface of the star .",
    "we demonstrate that the observed oscillation can easily be several times larger than the underlying physical motion from a starquake",
    ". however , the enhancement is likely not enough to fully explain the observed amplitudes of the qpos in sgr 180620 and sgr 1900 + 14 , suggesting that the observed oscillations are produced by a changing intensity in the emission rather than physical motion of the beam itself .",
    "to quantify how the signal from a starquake will be modified by the pulse profile requires a description for the oscillation and the emission . we adopt a simplistic model for both the emission and oscillation geometry , and further assume that the emission comes from close to the star s surface and moves with the crust",
    "this can easily be generalized to a more detailed two - dimensional model for both the crust motion and the pulse pattern .",
    "figure [ fig : star ] shows a sketch of the star .",
    "the star rotates with frequency @xmath5 about the @xmath6-axis , which is inclined by angle @xmath7 from the observer s line of sight .",
    "the dashed line shows the observer s viewing parallel : rays parallel to the surface normal on the viewing parallel will be observable . assuming the emission is strongly beamed ( necessary to produce sharp gradients ) , the emission from the star will be visible where it crosses the viewing parallel .",
    "we assume that the emission beam is a narrow strip in which the intensity varies strongly across the strip but stays roughly constant along it .",
    "the beam is seen in close - up in the figure and the line density shows the changing emission intensity .",
    "an oscillation with frequency @xmath8 ( where @xmath9 ) and physical displacement @xmath10 is superposed on top of the star s overall rotation .",
    "the orientation can be random however we consider only the component perpendicular to the beam s gradient , since an oscillation along the gradient will not change the emission profile .",
    "the beam crosses the viewing parallel with angle @xmath11 , so the observed pulse profile is somewhat broadened .",
    "the high - frequency oscillation @xmath10 corresponds to a shift in the rotation phase , @xmath12 : @xmath13    the @xmath14 term arises from the misalignment between the beam and viewing parallel . as the beam oscillates in direction @xmath10 , the change in flux corresponds to a shift in rotation phase @xmath15 larger than the physical displacement .",
    "this is because the observed beam is broadened along the viewing parallel , while @xmath16 probes the ` true ' beam profile .",
    "angles @xmath11 and @xmath17 are unknown : however , we will argue later that they are insufficient to amplify a starquake into the observed features . using the emission profile , @xmath18",
    ", we can calculate @xmath19 and see how the starquake changes the overall variability in the light curve .",
    "since @xmath12 is small , observed profile is:@xmath20 when the gradient of the light curve is large ( @xmath21 ) , the starquake will be boosted and dominate the light curve .",
    "this process will have two other effects on the observed variability .",
    "first , since @xmath22 changes , the observed amplitude of the oscillation varies , which will redistribute the signal power at @xmath8 into a range of frequencies . the width of the signal in the power spectrum can be estimated from the rate of change in the observed oscillation amplitude , i.e. , @xmath23 .",
    "this process will also introduce harmonics of @xmath8 into the light curve .    in summary :",
    "the strength of the oscillation seen by the viewer depends on @xmath10 , @xmath7 , @xmath11 and @xmath24 . @xmath25",
    "determines the width and shape of the feature in the power spectrum , as well as the magnitude of harmonics of @xmath8 .",
    "the high - frequency signals detected in sgr 180620 and sgr 1900 + 14 had resolved widths suggesting that the underlying oscillation is not a purely periodic signal . to understand how the pulse profile changes a signal with a range of frequencies , we add qpos to the light curve of sgr 180620 .",
    "we model qpos as noise processes with a lorentzian distribution of powers as input following the method suggested by .",
    "the power spectrum of the qpo in rms normalization ( e.g. , @xcite ) is given by : @xmath26 in equation  ( [ eq : qpo ] ) , @xmath27 is the nyquist frequency , @xmath28 is the qpo variance , @xmath29 is its full - width at half - maximum ( fwhm ) , and @xmath8 is its central frequency .",
    "the total power of the qpo is the same as for a sinusoid , only distributed over a range of frequencies .",
    "the variance of @xmath30 over time interval @xmath31 is : @xmath32 so that substituting the amplitude from equation  ( [ eq : delphi ] ) , @xmath28 in equation  ( [ eq : qpo ] ) is given by : @xmath33    to produce a time series of length @xmath31 , we generate a realization of its fourier transform by taking the power ( equation  ( [ eq : qpo ] ) ) at each frequency , @xmath34 ( @xmath35 ) and multiplying by a complex number ( @xmath36 ) whose real and imaginary parts are drawn from a gaussian random distribution with a variance of one and mean of zero : @xmath37 the resulting time series has a variance @xmath28 and a mean of zero .",
    "this signal is the offset @xmath38 to the star s",
    "phase @xmath39 as a function of time .",
    "we illustrate how the pulse profile changes an underlying oscillation with an emissionprofile @xmath40 , adopting different values of @xmath41 .",
    "this idealized shape corresponds roughly to the edges of the pulse where qpos have been observed .",
    "we use the same total flux for each profile , and neglect the effect of shot noise .",
    "we adopt a period of @xmath42 for the emission duration a time resolution of @xmath43 .",
    "we add a sinusoidal oscillation to the rotation phase , with amplitude @xmath44 and frequency @xmath45 .",
    "figure [ fig : ps_ex ] shows the power spectra around @xmath46 , for @xmath47 $ ] , increasing from bottom to top .",
    "the inset of figure [ fig : ps_ex ] shows the different emission profiles .",
    "the rms variability from the starquake is measured by integrating the spectrum in an interval of @xmath48 centered at @xmath46 and subtracting the power contribution from the underlying emission profile .",
    "the main effect of steeper profiles is to increase the rms variability of the starquake . for @xmath49 ,",
    "the oscillation is a spike at @xmath50 with an rms amplitude of @xmath51 .",
    "as @xmath41 increases , the amplitude and width of the feature increase , so that for @xmath52 the feature has an rms amplitude of @xmath53a ten - fold increase .    for larger @xmath41 ,",
    "the gradient of @xmath18 also changes substantially , which broadens the feature so that the fwhm for @xmath52 is @xmath54 .",
    "the full properties of the signal for each @xmath41 are summarized in table [ tab : example ] .",
    ".properties of oscillation in power - law light curve[tab : example ] [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     from the generated power spectrum we also measure the starquake harmonics .",
    "the last column of table [ tab : example ] shows the rms of the first harmonic ( at @xmath55 ) for different @xmath41 . even for @xmath52 ,",
    "the power in the first harmonic is much smaller than the fundamental and would not be detectable above photon noise .",
    "these results show that a small oscillation can be substantially increased by a steep gradient of the light curve.we next apply the same technique to the light curve of sgr 180620 , to demonstrate how the beam shape will affect the oscillation amplitude .",
    "the tail of the 2004 giant flare of sgr 180620 showed strongly pulsed emission with two main peaks in the pulse profile .",
    "qpos appeared at different phases in the pulse profile , and also lasted for different lengths of time ( @xcite , sw06 ) .",
    "two of the strongest qpos , one at @xmath56 and one at @xmath57 are associated with steep gradients in the pulse profile .",
    "a dynamic power spectrum of the data showed that the @xmath58 qpo is strongest in the declining edge of the pulse ( figure 3 of sw06 ) .",
    "we therefore focus our study on the same phase as in sw06 .",
    "sw06 found phase - dependent qpos at @xmath59 and @xmath60 in the sgr 180620 giant flare beginning @xmath61 after the main spike .",
    "the inset of figure [ fig : ps_rxte ] shows the averaged pulse profile for the nine subsequent rotation cycles , and the solid lines show the phase segment when the qpos were detected most strongly .",
    "a starquake will only be boosted by rotation - dependent variation of the light curve .",
    "the @xmath62 data of sgr 180620 shows substantial variability , particularly below 100  hz , but the rotation period of the star is closer to @xmath63 .",
    "additionally , at shorter time bins the signal - to - noise ratio drops and the variability from photon noise dominates .",
    "we thus bin and smooth the entire light curve to a time resolution of 0.1  s , removing signal power at frequencies above @xmath64 .",
    "since the resulting feature depends on the gradient of the pulse profile and its derivative ( equation  ( [ eq : qpo_intensity ] ) ) , the binsize and smoothing change the detailed shape and intensity of the feature . experimenting with different binsizes and smoothing prescriptions",
    "shows the amplitude of the feature is robust ( to @xmath65 ) to changes .",
    "the width and shape of the feature are more sensitive to higher derivatives so that the widths and the shapes of the features we produce serve more as qualitative examples than quantitative results .",
    "to probe the effect of the pulse shape on the ouput oscillation strength , we make a light curve with two features , with @xmath66 at @xmath67 and at @xmath68 . we then follow sw06 and examine the light curve @xmath69 after the main flare , calculating the power spectrum of the 3  s phase segment shown in the inset of figure  [ fig : ps_rxte ] .",
    "the rms amplitude of the signal changes between rotations ( from the changing pulse profile ) from @xmath70 to @xmath71 . stacking and averaging the power spectra we measure the average power in each feature .",
    "the stacked power spectrum centered around @xmath72 is shown in figure [ fig : sgr_sine ] .",
    "the feature has an amplitude of @xmath73 and fwhm width of @xmath74 .",
    "the feature at @xmath75 has an rms amplitude of @xmath76 and width @xmath74 .",
    "while the width is still smaller than the widths of the measured features ( @xmath77 for the @xmath75 feature and @xmath78 for the @xmath79 feature ; sw06 ) , it nonetheless demonstrates that a very narrow feature can be substantially broadened by the light curve profile .",
    "the harmonics of the features are stronger than for the power - law case with an rms amplitude of @xmath80 and a large frequency spread in the first harmonic .",
    "this is still undetectable , even when the oscillation has an observed rms amplitude of @xmath81 .",
    "the qpo features detected in sgr 180620 have measurable widths between @xmath82 , and frequencies where photon noise dominates the variability .",
    "both these effects can change the measured properties of qpo , as we study below .",
    "we model the starquake as a quasi - periodic signal as outlined in section  [ sec : qpo ] , defining an input width , central frequency and amplitude .",
    "to simulate photon noise we use the output light curve as a probability function to detect a photon in a given time bin and generate a light curve as a series of discrete events .",
    "since these are both random noise processes , we generate a large number of realizations and measure the qpo properties statistically .",
    "as above , we add two qpos to the phase of the sgr 180620 light curve and calculate the modified profile .",
    "one qpo is centered at @xmath79 with a width of @xmath83 , the second at @xmath75 with a width of @xmath84 .",
    "both have an input amplitude of @xmath85 .",
    "we use the same rotation phase as above , stack the power spectra from nine successive rotations and bin the data with a binsize of @xmath86 .    figure  [ fig : ps_rxte ] shows the power spectrum ( in leahy normalization ) of one realization .",
    "the inset shows the averaged phase profile , with vertical lines denoting the phase segment used to make the power spectrum .",
    "this figure is comparable to figure  2 of sw06 . both qpos are visible by eye . in our spectrum",
    "the power above @xmath87 has been removed from the smoothing applied to the light curve .",
    "the qpo inserted at 93  hz is detected with a mean width of 6.6@xmath881.5  hz , rms amplitude of 21%@xmath881.5% , and average central frequency of 91.7@xmath880.6  hz .",
    "for the 626  hz qpo , the mean width is 2.4@xmath881.4  hz , with an rms amplitude of 15%@xmath881.5% and central frequency 624.9@xmath880.35  hz .",
    "the rms amplitude at 93  hz is not significantly different from adding a sinusoid , but is measurably lower around 626  hz . in both cases , however , the strength of the feature is significantly stronger than the underlying oscillation .",
    "the features show modest broadening with a large dispersion between different realizations .",
    "the systematic offset in the central frequency of the qpo appears because of the binsize . in simulations without photon noise , reducing the binsize shifts the central frequency of the qpo closer to the input one .",
    "harmonics are not detected .",
    "the steep pulse profile seen in the tail of giant magnetar flares substantially alters the observed properties of a starquake , changing both its observed amplitude and power distribution . while this effect is not large enough to transform a starquake with maximum amplitude @xmath89 into a qpo with an rms amplitude of 20% , the boosting can still be considerable , especially if the emission comes from close to the rotation axis of the star , or if the steepest part of the beam gradient is misaligned with the viewing parallel ( small @xmath11 ) .",
    "there are several uncertainties in our calculation that could boost the amplitude of a starquake further .",
    "the first of these is the unknown location of emission on the surface of the star .",
    "if the emission is close to the rotation axis , then a small physical motion produces a larger change in phase than at the equator .",
    "however , to produce a ten - fold increase requires an inclination angle of less than @xmath90 , which is improbable given the strong observed pulsations .    the second way to boost",
    "the amplitude is for the beam to cross the observing parallel obliquely , as in figure  [ fig : star ] . since in this case",
    "the actual beam edge is steeper than observed , the amplification is larger than expected from the observed beam shape . for the extreme case ( @xmath91 ) the beam runs exactly parallel to the line of sight so that no pulse is seen but there is a strong qpo .",
    "this scenario is unlikely , both that @xmath11 is so small and that the beam edge is so much sharper ( by a factor @xmath92 ) than observed . as an example : to produce a feature with a rms amplitude of @xmath76 requires a gradient @xmath93 ( cf . equation ( [ eq : qpo_intensity ] ) ) , which is @xmath94 steeper than the pulse profile in figure  [ fig : ps_rxte ] .",
    "the input amplitudes required to produce the strong qpos of sgr 1806 - 20 are large enough to produce qpos that are observable throughout the entire profile . applying the model across the entire pulse profile ( using 3s segments offset by @xmath95 in phase )",
    ", the oscillation has an output amplitude between @xmath96 and @xmath71strong enough to be detected throughout the rotation .",
    "if the emission model is correct , this requires that the starquake amplitude varies significantly across the surface of the crust and the correlation with the falling pulse edge is somewhat coincidental .",
    "this is expected generically in starquake models , however , and is seen directly in mhd simulations of coupled core - crust oscillations @xcite which show a strong phase dependence in the starquake amplitude .",
    "the toy model suggests that the pulse profile can substantially influence the observed amplitude and other properties of a starquake .",
    "while we have used a simple model for the emission and starquake , this work can be easily generalized to use a physically - motivated model of the surface emission and starquake , in order to put constraints on the pattern of emission on the surface of the star during the quake ."
