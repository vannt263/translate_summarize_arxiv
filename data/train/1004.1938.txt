    "there are many well - known metrics over the symmetric group @xmath2 ( see @xcite ) , of which the hamming metric is by far the most studied .",
    "however , the infinity metric induced by the infinity norm has received recent interest due to its applications @xcite , and will serve as the metric of choice in this work .",

    "anticode _ with maximal distance @xmath1 , if any two of its members are at distance at most @xmath1 apart . in the context of coding theory ,",
    "the first use of anticodes was in @xcite ( see also @xcite for an overview ) .",
    "the anticodes were in fact multisets ( allowing repeated words ) , and were used to construct codes that attain the griesmer bound with equality . as a purely combinatorial question , anticodes ( though not under this name ) appear in earlier works , such as the celebrated erds - ko - rado theorem on @xmath7-intersecting families @xcite .",
    "many other variations on the ambient space and distance measure have created a wealth of anticodes , see for example @xcite .    the following theorem , which is sometimes referred to as the _ set - antiset theorem _ , motivates us to explore anticodes of maximum size .",
    "this theorem was also used before over different spaces and distance measures ( see @xcite ) .",

    "the size of balls in @xmath2 under the @xmath3-metric has been studied in @xcite .",

    "let @xmath20 be a @xmath0-matrix defined by an anticode @xmath27 , then by the previous observation , the set of non - zero entries in @xmath20 is a subset of the non - zero entries of some matrix in @xmath26 .",
