    "the notion of _ motivic nearby fiber _ ( see @xcite , @xcite and @xcite ) avoids this problem by defining a class @xmath61 in the grothendieck ring of varieties so that it should correspond to @xmath55 ( would it exist as a variety ) .",
    "the class @xmath61 can be expressed as a certain linear combination of strata of @xmath52 and does not depend on ambiguity in the choice of @xmath52 thanks to the alternation of signs in the expression of @xmath61 via @xmath52 .    when we pass from @xmath22 to the motivic nearby fiber @xmath61 we loose some homological information .",
    "for example , @xmath61 is the class of the empty set for the degeneration corresponding to a smooth tropical elliptic curve ( or , more generally , a smooth tropical abelian variety ) . under the assumption of theorem [ thm : main ] ,",

    "the second equality of is the combination of the definition of the @xmath63-polynomial and theorem 1 .",

    "theorem [ os ] ) .",
    "for the first equality see also section 11.2.7 of @xcite .    in general , @xmath65 does not determine individual numbers @xmath66 .",
    "in the special case of complete intersections , the lefschetz hyperplane section theorem determines @xmath23 for @xmath67 , and thus @xmath65 ( which can easily be read from the combinatorial data of @xmath0 ) suffices to recover @xmath23 .",
    "this observation appeared in @xcite for the case of hypersurfaces .",
    "note that the tropical limit of @xmath56 introduced in definition [ fine - conv ] does not require to make any choice for the central fiber @xmath52 whatsoever .",
