    "it has been known since ancient times that alloying two metals can give rise to a new material with properties that are improved over those of the constituent metals .",
    "for example , alloys can have superior mechanical or magnetic properties , an increased resistance to corrosion , or constitute good catalysts .",
    "however , not all pairs of metals form stable alloy phases .",
    "the rules governing alloy formation in the bulk were first formulated by hume - rothery.@xcite the first of these empirical laws states that if the atomic size mismatch is greater than 15% , phase segregation is favored over the formation of solid solutions .",
    "thus , many pairs of metals are immiscible ( or nearly so ) in the bulk .    in recent years",
    ", it has become apparent that surface science can extend the chemical phase space available for the search for new alloy systems .",
    "it has long been known that bulk alloys exhibit surface segregation , so that the chemical composition at the surface can differ considerably from that in the bulk . however , the field of surface alloying gained additional interest when it was discovered that even metals that are immiscible in the bulk can form stable surface alloys as a result of the altered atomic environment at the surface.@xcite these alloys display atomic mixing that is confined to the surface layer or , in some cases , the top few layers .",
    "these results were explained by tersoff,@xcite who argued that in cases where there is a large size mismatch , as a result of which the energetics are dominated by strain effects , alloying will be disfavored in the bulk but favored at the surface .    subsequently , another class of surface alloys has emerged , where two metals that differ in size are co - deposited on a third metal of intermediate size . in such systems , any single - component pseudomorphic layer will be under tensile or compressive stress ( that may or may not be relieved by the formation of dislocations);@xcite however if the two elements were to mix , the stress would presumably be considerably relieved .",
    "thus , the strain imposed by the presence of the substrate promotes alloying in the surface layer .",
    "some examples of such strain - stabilized surface alloys are an ag - cu monolayer on ru(0001),@xcite pd - au / ru(0001 ) ,  @xcite and pb - sn / rh(111).@xcite    hitherto , the guiding principle in the search for such systems has been the rule - of - thumb that the ( bulk ) nearest - neighbor ( nn ) distance of the substrate should be the average of the nn distances of the two overlayer elements .",
    "however , this simple criterion does not necessarily work .",
    "for example , thayer _ et al .",
    "_ have studied the co - ag / ru(0001 ) system.@xcite at first sight , this system would seem to be a good candidate for the formation of a strain - stabilized surface alloy , since the nn distance for ag is larger than that of ru by 8% , while that of co is smaller by 7% .",
    "however , instead of forming an atomically mixed structure , it was found that the stable structure consisted of ag droplets surrounded by co. after doing a combined experimental and theoretical study , these authors concluded that chemical bonding between ag and co is disfavored in this system , and the observed structure results from a lowering of stress at the boundary between co and ag islands .    in this paper",
    ", we examine ten different bi - metallic systems on a ru(0001 ) substrate .",
    "some of the questions that we hope to address include : ( i ) is it only the mean size of the overlayer atoms that matters , or do individual sizes also matter ?",
    "( ii ) can one develop a criterion based on atomic size that will predict whether or not a surface alloy will form ?",
    "( iii ) how different are atomic sizes at the surface compared to those in the bulk ? , and ( iv ) what is the relative importance of elastic and chemical interactions ?",
    "the bi - metallic systems we have considered all consist of one magnetic metal @xmath1 ( fe or co ) and one non - magnetic metal @xmath2 ( pt , ag , au , cd or pb ) , co - deposited on ru(0001 ) to form a surface alloy of the form @xmath3 , where @xmath4 denotes the ru substrate .",
    "such systems , involving one magnetic and one non - magnetic element , are of interest because alloying can , in some cases , improve magnetic properties .",
    "conversely , in some applications,@xcite one would prefer that instead of mixing at the atomic level , the system should spontaneously organize into a pattern consisting of alternating domains of the magnetic and the non - magnetic element .",
    "ru(0001 ) was chosen as the substrate , in part because of its intermediate nn distance , and in part because its hardness and immiscibility with the other elements make it less likely that the alloy elements will penetrate into the bulk . the bulk nn distances , @xmath5 , of the two magnetic metals fe and co , are about 7 - 8% less than @xmath6 , the nn separation in the ru substrate , while all five non - magnetic metals we have considered have bulk nn distances , @xmath7 , larger than that of ru .",
    "however , the @xmath2 metals we have chosen display a large variation in size : the nn distance in pt is approximately 3% more than that in ru , while in pb the discrepancy is 26% .",
    "accordingly , only fe - pt and co - pt fall within the 15% range of the hume - rothery criterion for bulk alloys ; alloys of fe and co with au and ag fall slightly outside this range , while those with cd and pb fall well outside the range .",
    "if there is a size - dependent trend that determines whether or not alloying is favored , then one might hope that it will show up upon examining these ten systems . in table",
    "i , we have given the average nn separation , @xmath8 , using experimental values for the bulk metals .",
    "upon examining how close these values lie to @xmath6 = 2.70  , one might expect ( using the simple criterion mentioned above ) that fe - au , fe - ag , co - au and co - ag might be good candidates for forming strain - stabilized surface alloys , and fe - cd , co - cd , fe - pt and co - pt may be possibilities , but fe - pb and co - pb surface alloys should be highly unlikely to form . as we will show below , these simple - minded expectations are not necessarily borne out .",
    "of the ten systems we consider in this paper , we are aware of previous studies on only two of them : co - ag / ru(0001),@xcite and fe - ag / ru(0001).@xcite in both these cases , it was found that chemical interactions dominate over elastic ones , and the atomically mixed phase is disfavored .",
    ".values in   of @xmath9 , the average of the nearest neighbor ( nn ) spacings of @xmath1 and @xmath2 in their bulk structures . by comparing these numbers with @xmath6 , the nn distance of ru in the bulk = 2.70  ,",
    "one expects co - au and co - ag to form stable alloys , and pb alloys to be unstable . in this table , all the values used are experimental values , taken from ref .  . [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     our results for the elastic contribution to the formation energy , evaluated using equations ( [ eq - m0.25 ] ) to ( [ eq - m0.75 ] ) , are displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig - morse ] .",
    "we find that for all ten combinations considered by us , elastic interactions always favor mixing of the two overlayer elements , in accordance with the predictions by tersoff.@xcite    , the elastic contribution to the formation energy , as a function of fractional composition @xmath10 , for ( a ) fe and ( b ) co alloys .",
    "upon considering elastic interactions alone , pb alloys appear to be the most stable against phase segregation , while cd and pt alloys are the least stable . ]    at first sight , our most surprising result appears to be our finding that for both magnetic elements , the pb alloys are the most stable , though upon examining table [ tab - bulk - avg ] or table [ tab - morseavg ] , one might think that this is unlikely . however , this is because for surface alloys , unlike bulk alloys , the phase - segregated forms can cost a high elastic energy , because of the presence of the substrate . since pseudomorphic pb / ru(0001 ) costs a great deal in elastic energy ,",
    "the mixed form is correspondingly favored . in order to make this argument clearer , in fig .",
    "[ fig - histogram ] , we have separated out the individual contributions to the right - hand - side of equation [ eq - m0.5 ] .",
    "the first ( @xmath1-@xmath2 ) term is always positive , while the second ( @xmath1-@xmath1 ) and third ( @xmath2-@xmath2 ) terms are always negative . in order for @xmath11 to be negative , the first term should be small ( the simple mixing rule applies only to this term ) , while the second and third terms should be large in magnitude .",
    "the first term is found to follow the expectations from an elementary consideration of sizes ( either at the bulk or at the surface ) : ag and au alloys are the most favored , followed by pt and cd , and then pb . it is interesting to note that both cd and pt alloys have roughly the same contribution from this first term ; this is because cd undergoes a relatively large contraction in size at the surface , relative to the bulk .",
    "a co monolayer on ru(0001 ) is relatively unhappy ( i.e. , the contribution to the elastic part of the formation energy is significant and negative ) , and a pb monolayer on ru(0001 ) is extremely unfavorable energetically . as a result of these two facts ,",
    "elastic interactions favor the formation of co-@xmath2 alloys over fe-@xmath2 alloys , and lead to the high stability against phase segregation of @xmath1-pb alloys .",
    "however , one should be cautious in interpreting these results , since we have made the assumption that the alloys as well as phase - segregated monolayers remain pseudomorphic .",
    "for the alloys , this is probably a valid assumption , since the elastic energy ( corresponding to the first bars in fig .",
    "[ fig - histogram ] ) is small , i.e. , the stress is unlikely to be high enough to drive the overlayer to relax . despite the significant elastic energy contained in a co / ru(0001 ) monolayer ,",
    "it does not reconstruct.@xcite however , for pb / ru(0001 ) , the very high elastic energy makes it seem possible that this system might reconstruct , presumably via a network of misfit dislocations ; we are not aware of any experimental information on this system .",
    "thus , the high stability we obtain for @xmath1-pb alloys may be misleading ; the stability would be lowered if the phase segregated form were to reconstruct ( since the third term in the elastic energy would then be decreased in magnitude ) .    ) to the elastic contribution to the alloy formation energy , for @xmath10 = 0.5 .",
    "contributions from @xmath1-@xmath2 , @xmath1-@xmath1 and @xmath2-@xmath2 bonds are displayed separately .",
    "all the histograms have been plotted on the same scale , to make comparison easier .",
    "note the very high negative contribution from pb - pb bonds for both fe - pb ( upper panel ) and co - pb ( lower panel ) alloys . ]    , for ( a ) fe and ( b ) co surface alloys on ru(0001 ) .",
    "these graphs have been obtained by subtracting out the elastic contribution from the _ ab initio _ results . ]    finally , in fig  [ fig - chem ] , we display our results for the chemical contribution to the formation energy , obtained by subtracting out the data in fig .",
    "[ fig - morse ] from that in fig .",
    "[ fig - delh ] .",
    "when only chemical interactions are considered , fe alloys are more favorable than co alloys . from this plot",
    ", we note that the stability of pt alloys is largely due to the favored chemical bonds between fe - pt and co - pt ; this is consistent with the fact that these intermetallic systems also form bulk alloys .",
    "the ag alloys are not stable because co - ag and fe - ag bonds cost very high chemical energy , which can not be offset by elastic energy ; this too is consistent with previous results.@xcite also note that fe - au bonds favor mixing , whereas co - au bonds cost energy , which explains the particular order of stability observed in the _ ab initio _ results .",
    "in this paper , we have attempted to gain an understanding into the factors governing the energetics of strain - stabilized surface alloys , by performing _ ab initio _",
    "calculations on ten combinations involving a magnetic and a non - magnetic metal co - deposited on a ru(0001 ) substrate . in many cases , we find the surface alloy to be stable , even though the constituent elements are immiscible in the bulk .",
    "we find that the stability ( against phase - segregation ) does not correlate with expectations based upon the simple argument that the mean atomic size should be as close as possible to the substrate lattice spacing .",
    "one reason for this is that though elastic interactions are an important mechanism governing stability , chemical interactions can also play a crucial role . in some cases ,",
    "the latter are large enough to disfavor atomic - level mixing , even if it helps in lowering the elastic energy .",
    "a second complicating factor is that unlike for bulk alloys , for such strain - stabilized surface alloys , the phase segregated forms can also cost elastic energy .",
    "thus , there are three factors that determine whether or not mixing takes place at the atomic level : ( i ) the elastic energy of the alloy phase , ( ii ) the elastic energies of the phase - segregated monolayers on the substrate , and ( iii ) chemical interactions .",
    "because of this complicated situation , a simple criterion , analogous to the first hume - rothery rule for bulk alloys , does not seem possible for such systems .",
    "we have also found that effective atomic sizes on the ru substrate are not equal to the bulk size ; in some cases this difference is small , while in other cases it is large .",
    "several alloys involving a magnetic and a non - magnetic element on a ru(0001 ) surface are found to be stable against phase segregation ; this is primarily because the effective size of the magnetic elements is smaller than the nearest - neighbor distance in the substrate , while that of the non - magnetic elements is larger , even after accounting for altered sizes at the surface . of the systems we have considered",
    ", we feel that fe - au , fe - cd and co - cd are particularly promising candidates that would be worth experimental investigation . in these systems ,",
    "both chemical and elastic interactions promote alloying .",
    "we have also found that surface alloys involving pb and either fe or co appear to be very resistant to phase segregation ; however , this conclusion is dependent on our assumption that a monolayer of pb on ru(0001 ) does not reconstruct , which may or may not be valid .",
    "we acknowledge helpful discussions with sylvie rousset , vincent repain and yann girard .",
