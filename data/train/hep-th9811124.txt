    "yau @xcite revealed a deep relation between the quantum cohomology of complete intersections in homogeneous spaces with non - negative first chern class and the hypergeometric series .",
    "then , what happens in the quantum cohomology of manifolds with negative first chern class ?",
    "before we turn into this topic , we look back at the quantum cohomology of calabi - yau manifolds . roughly speaking",
    ", the mirror calculation of the quantum cohomology of calabi - yau manifolds consists of two parts .",
    "the first part is the evaluation of the hypergeometric series obtained from the b - model of its mirror manifold and the second part is a translation of the hypergeometric data ( b - model ) into the geometrical one ( a - model ) by a coordinate change of the deformation parameter , i.e. , the mirror map . in @xcite",
    ", givental revealed the fact that in the case of projective fano hypersurface with first chern class @xmath0 , we can do without the second part of the mirror calculation . in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ,",
    "it was argued that the second part has a close relation with a difference between the non - linear sigma model and the gauged linear sigma model , or , in other words , a difference between the moduli space of polynomial maps and its toric compactification .",
    "an easy dimensional counting leads us to the conclusion that we have the same problem in treating the quantum cohomology of a projective hypersurface with negative first chern class .    in this paper",
    ", we give some results arguing that there exists a generalization of two processes in the mirror calculation in the case of the quantum cohomology of the general type projective hypersurface .",
    "our objects that correspond to the hypergeometric series in the case of a hypersurface of nonpositive first chern class is the virtual structure constants obtained by directly applying recursive formulas for the structure constants of the quantum cohomology of fano hypersurfaces with first chern class @xmath1 .",
    "these recursive formulas express the structure constants for degree @xmath2 hypersurface ( @xmath3 ) in @xmath4 in terms of those of @xmath5 . by these formulas",
    ", we can reduce the dimension of the hypersurface conserving its degree .",
    "we constructed them up to mapping degree @xmath6 in @xcite ( we later constructed the recursive formulas for rational curves of mapping degree @xmath7 ) .",
    "we observed that the virtual structure constants of the calabi - yau hypersurface @xmath8 reproduce the coefficients of the hypergeometric series used in the mirror calculation up to mapping degree @xmath7 , and we expect here that these constants produce objects like the hypergeometric series , even in the case of the general type hypersurfaces .",
    "for the second part of the mirror calculation , we propose an idea for construction of the generalized mirror transformation . in this paper , we argue that this transformation can be effectively consturcted from the one for calabi - yau hypersurfaces . in @xcite , we constructed an implicit formula that translates the virtual structure constants into the true ones in the case of the calabi - yau hypersurface , and here , we prove a theorem that implies a close relation between this mirror transformation and schur polynomials , or partitions of integers ( young diagrams ) .",
    "then we conjecture that the structure revealed in our theorem is still conserved in the case of the hypersurface with negative first chern class .",
    "indeed , we construct an explicit form of the generalized mirror transformation in this case up to mapping degree @xmath9 ( we also obtained partial results for mapping degree @xmath6 ) with some technical assumption .",
    "our formula can also be regarded as a prediction formula for the @xmath9-point ( with one insertion of khler form ) gromov - witten invariant of the general type projective hypersurfaces .",
    "our idea of generalization of the mirror transformation has a geometrical origin .",
    "we construct a set - theoretic projective space resolution of the moduli space @xmath10 , that is the moduli space of polynomial maps from @xmath11 to @xmath4 of mapping degree @xmath12 .",
    "the resolution diagram consists of the direct product of @xmath13 ( @xmath14 varies ) and these spaces are labeled by partitions of nonnegative integers , or mapping degree .",
    "we observe that there is one - to - one correspondence between the spaces in the resolution diagram and the terms in the generalized mirror transformation .",
    "on the other hand , as we mentioned in @xcite , dimensional count leads us to the conclusion that we can not see the resolution structure in the case of a fano hypersurface with first chern class @xmath15 . in sum",
    ", we expect a deep relation between this resolution and the ring of symmetric functions @xcite .",
    "we think this point of view should be pursued further .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .    in section 2 ,",
    "we construct a projective space resolution of the moduli space @xmath10 of polynomial maps from @xmath11 to @xmath4 of mapping degree @xmath12 and explain its connection with partitions of integers .    in section 3 , we briefly review the results on the khler sub - ring of the quantum cohomology ring of a projective hypersurface with nonnegative first chern class .",
    "we also introduce here the virtual structure constants .    in section 4",
    ", we construct recursive formulas that represent the structure constants of the quantum cohomology of the hypersuface of degree @xmath2 in @xmath4 in terms of the ones of the hypersuface of the same degree in @xmath16 in the case of non - positive first chern class and construct the generalized mirror transformation up to mapping degree 2 .",
    "next , we state a theorem on the mirror transformation of the calabi - yau hypersurfaces and explain its relation with schur polynomials and with the projective space resolution in section 2 .    in section 5 , which is the main section of this paper , we make a general conjecture on the form of the generalized mirror transformation using the results in section 4 .",
    "then we construct an explicit formula of the transformation in the case of mapping degree @xmath9 , ( we also obtained partial results for mapping degree @xmath6 ) using our conjecture .    in section 6 , we show some explicit examples of the quantum cohomology of general type hypersurface @xmath3 for lower @xmath17 and @xmath2 .",
    "topic of this section is not logically connected to the derivation of the generalized mirror transformation , which is the main topic of this paper , but it gives us a geometrical back - ground of the conjecture that will be proposed in section 5 .    here , we propose a set - theoretic projective space resolution of the moduli space @xmath10 of polynomial maps of mapping degree @xmath12 from @xmath11 to @xmath4 .",
    "note that this moduli space is non - compact and different from the moduli space of stable maps from @xmath11 to @xmath4 .",
    "this point of view is already discussed by many authors and is called `` gauged linear sigma model '' .",
    "let us define that the sequence of maps @xmath18 is set - theoretically exact if @xmath19 is a bijective map between @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "if @xmath20 is the disjoint union of the sets @xmath22 and if the maps @xmath23 are bijection between @xmath24 and @xmath25 , we say that the branched sequence of maps @xmath26 and @xmath27 are set - theoretically exact .",
    "then our resolution diagrams consist of the branched sequences of maps that are set - theoretically exact .",
    "for some lower degrees , the resolution diagrams are given in figure 1 .",
    "let us explain the inductive construction of these diagrams .",
    "first , take an injective map @xmath28 from @xmath10 to @xmath29 in figure 2 .",
    "the map @xmath28 is defined as follows .",
    "@xmath30    note that homogeneous polynomials of degree @xmath12 @xmath31 must not have common divisor of positive degree , because otherwise they correspond to maps of lower degree by a projective equivalence .",
    "obviously , @xmath32 is bijective to the disjoint union of @xmath33 by the following bijection : @xmath34 here , we extend the definition of @xmath28 to the general polynomial maps having a common divisor of positive degree . combining @xmath28 and @xmath35 , we obtain a set - theoretic short exact sequence in figure 3 .",
    "since @xmath36 is isomorphic to @xmath4 , resolution of @xmath37 is given as : @xmath38 now that we have the diagram of figure 3 , what we have to do to construct projective space resolution of @xmath10 is to construct projective space resolution of @xmath39 .",
    "this can be done by applying @xmath40 to each space in the resolution diagram of @xmath41 .",
    "then we can construct the resolution diagram of @xmath10 inductively .    from figure 1",
    ", we can see that each space @xmath42 induced from a sequence @xmath43 appear at least once and only once in the resolution diagram of @xmath10 . including the null sequence @xmath44 in the case of @xmath29 , total number of such integer sequences is @xmath45 .",
    "we also associate a pair @xmath46 with an integer sequence @xmath47 .",
    "these pairs appear in the resolution diagram once and only once .",
    "if we formally associate the pair @xmath48 with @xmath49 , we can see that these pairs cover the diagram . neglecting the order of the integer sequence",
    ", we can take a partition @xmath50 as the label of these pairs .",
    "note that this label has multiplicity or , in other words , not one to one .",
    "we denote the multiplicity of @xmath51 by @xmath52 and multiplicity of @xmath53 , appearing in @xmath51 by @xmath54",
    ". then we have @xmath55 if we denote a set of partitions of integer @xmath2 by @xmath56 , we see @xmath57 which are easy exercises of elementary combinatorics .    as we mentioned in our previous paper @xcite , these resolution structures do not occur in the quantum cohomology of degree @xmath2 hypersurfaces in @xmath4 with @xmath58 as we can see by dimensional counting , but in the case of @xmath59 and especially in the case of @xmath60 , we will see the above structure appears . in these cases",
    ", we expect that a topological invariant obtained from integrating out the closed forms on @xmath10 can be represented as an alternate sum of the contributions from each pair in the resolution diagram ( we denote length of partition @xmath61 by @xmath62 ) : @xmath63 here , we assumed that the contributions from each pair labeled by @xmath61 are the same . in section 4",
    ", we will see the formula that can be regarded as an example of ( [ sisou ] ) .",
    "in this section , we introduce the quantum khler sub - ring of the quantum cohomology ring of a degree @xmath2 hypersurface in @xmath4 .",
    "let @xmath3 be a hypersurface of degree @xmath2 in @xmath4 .",
    "we denote by @xmath64 the sub - ring of the quantum cohomology ring @xmath65 generated by @xmath66 induced from the khler form @xmath67 ( or , equivalently the intersection @xmath68 between a hyperplane class @xmath69 of @xmath4 and @xmath3 ) .",
    "the multiplication rule of @xmath64 is determined by the gromov - witten invariant of genus @xmath49 @xmath70 and it is given as follows : @xmath71    we call @xmath72 the structure constants of weighted degree @xmath12 .",
    "since @xmath3 is a complex @xmath73 dimensional manifold , we see that the structure constants @xmath72 is non - zero only if the following condition is satisfied : @xmath74 we rewrite ( [ sel ] ) into @xmath75 from ( [ flasel ] ) , we easily see that the number of the non - zero structure constants @xmath72 is finite except for the case of @xmath76 . moreover , if @xmath77 , the non - zero structure constants come only from the @xmath78 part and the number of them is @xmath2 , which is independent of @xmath17 .",
    "the @xmath77 region is studied by beauville @xcite , and his result plays the role of an initial condition of our discussion later . in the case of @xmath76 , the multiplication rule of @xmath79",
    "is given as follows : @xmath80 we introduce here the generating function of the structure constants of the calabi - yau hypersurface @xmath8 : @xmath81    in this paper , we assume that @xmath72 is geometrically given by the following formula : @xmath82 here , @xmath83 is the moduli space of the stable maps from @xmath11 with @xmath14 points to @xmath4 of mapping degree @xmath12 .",
    "@xmath84 is the forgetful map and @xmath85 is given by @xmath86 .",
    "@xmath87 is the evaluation map at the @xmath88-th puncture .",
    "the direct image sheaf @xmath89 is considered in the setting of the fibration @xmath90 . the r.h.s . of ( [ total ] ) can be evaluated by the toroidal calculation method of kontsevich @xcite , @xcite and we will use this data to check numerically our prediction formula in section 5 .",
    "let us summarize the results of @xcite . in @xcite",
    ", we showed that the structure constants @xmath72 of @xmath91 , can be obtained by applying the recursive formulas in appendix b , that represents @xmath72 in terms of @xmath92 , with the initial condition @xmath93 ( they are non - zero only for @xmath94 and do not depend on @xmath17 ) and @xmath95 , in the @xmath77 region . these recursive formulas naturally lead us to the relation : @xmath96 of @xmath97 by a descending induction from the result of beauville .",
    "this formula shows that the resolution structure in section 2 do not occur in the case of @xmath58 .",
    "in the @xmath98 case , the recursive formulas receive modification only in the @xmath78 part : @xmath99 this leads us to the following relation of @xmath100 : @xmath101    the structure constant @xmath102 for a calabi - yau hypersurface do not obey the recursive formulas in appendix b. we introduce here virtual structure constants @xmath103 as follows .",
    "let @xmath103 be the rational number obtained by applying the recursion relations of fano hypersurfaces in appendix b for arbitrary @xmath17 and @xmath2 with the initial condition @xmath104 , and @xmath105 .",
    "* remark 1 * in the @xmath106 region , @xmath107 .",
    "we define the generating function of the virtual structure constants of the calabi - yau hypersurface @xmath8 as follows : @xmath108 then we conjectured that @xmath109 gives us the information of the b - model of the mirror manifold of @xmath8 .",
    "more explicitly , we conjectured @xmath110 where the r.h.s .",
    "of ( [ po ] ) is the power series solution of the ode for the period integral of the mirror manifold of @xmath8 , @xmath111 moreover we can obtain the mirror map @xmath112 without using the mirror conjecture : @xmath113 with these conjectures , we can construct the mirror transformation that transforms the virtual structure constants of the calabi - yau hypersurface into the real ones as follows : @xmath114    here we will discuss whether we can obtain useful informations from the virtual structure constants @xmath103 in the @xmath115 region .",
    "note that @xmath103 is non - zero only if @xmath116 .",
    "so a hypersurface with non - positive first chern class has infinite number of @xmath103 , though only a finite number of @xmath72 appear in @xmath117 . in this case , the recursive formulas in appendix b restricted to @xmath118 yield the following recursive relations : @xmath119 then we obtain from ( [ po ] ) @xmath120 the r.h.s .",
    "of ( [ neg ] ) resembles the power series solution of the ode @xmath121 given by @xmath122 these formulas suggest the existence of a mirror manifold of @xmath123 .",
    "so we proceed further expecting that there exists formulas that transforms the virtual structure constants into the real structure constants like the case of @xmath8 .",
    "however , these information are less important in the relation with the structure constants of the real quantum cohomology ring @xmath72 if we reconsider analogy with the case of calabi - yau hypersurfaces . in the case of calabi - yau hypersurfaces ,",
    "the information of @xmath124 , is used to construct @xmath125 , and @xmath126 are thrown away .",
    "that corresponds to the `` trivialization of line bundle factor '' .",
    "one of the reasons why we need @xmath127 comes from the realization of the `` flat metric condition '' , or more formally , we need cancellation of the formulas that express @xmath102 in terms of @xmath128 , if we set @xmath129 or @xmath130 . this condition assures us that the identity operator in @xmath131 does nt receive quantum correction .",
    "similarly , we require the formulas that express @xmath132 , in terms of @xmath133 , to cancel if we formally set @xmath134 or @xmath135 .",
    "moreover , we assume that what we need in constructing @xmath72 , which is non - zero only if @xmath136 , is @xmath137 .",
    "in other words , we threw away infinite number of @xmath138 in the @xmath115 case except for @xmath139 .",
    "later on , we call the formulas that express @xmath72 in terms of @xmath133 , the `` generalized mirror transformation '' .",
    "we introduce the following notation .",

    "we denote by @xmath152 the generalized mirror transformation ( of course , @xmath153 if @xmath58 ) .",
    "then if we can determine @xmath152 , we can construct @xmath145 from equation @xmath154 .",
    "conversely , we can construct @xmath152 if we can construct @xmath145 . in the next section",
    ", we will give some results as some clues for constructing the generalized mirror transformation .",
    "in this subsection , we prove a theorem on the structure constants of @xmath155 , coming from the quantum correction of the @xmath149 part . unfortunately , our method used in the proof of the theorem is effective only in these cases for the general type hypersurfaces .",
    "however , the result gives us a hint for the construction of the generalized mirror transformation proposed in section 5 .    in the case of @xmath156 ,",
    "the following formulas expressing @xmath147 in terms of @xmath157 for the @xmath149 cases hold : @xmath158    _ proof ) _ we roughly show a sketch of the proof along the line of @xcite .",
