    "many experiments have shown that the electrons in cuprate high-@xmath0 superconductors ( hts ) are significantly renormalized by the interaction with collective modes .",
    "this renormalization appears in photoemission measurements as velocity changes in the quasi - particle dispersion ( the `` kinks '' ) accompanied by a drop of the quasi - particle life - time @xcite . in tunneling ,",
    "the renormalization shows up as a depression , or `` dip '' , in the @xmath4 curve with the associated nearby accumulation of spectral weight ( the `` hump '' ) @xcite .",
    "similar signatures observed by tunneling spectroscopy in classical superconductors were successfully explained by the strong - coupling theory of superconductivity @xcite .",
    "there are , however , two striking differences between the structures observed in the cuprates and in low-@xmath0 metals such as pb or hg .",
    "the dip in the cuprates is electron - hole asymmetric , being strongest at negative bias , while no such asymmetry is seen in lead .",
    "the electron - hole asymmetry of the dip is due to the electron - hole asymmetry of the underlying electronic density of states ( dos ) @xcite .",
    "second , while the structures are subtle in low-@xmath0 materials  they induce a change smaller than 5% in the tunneling spectrum  the cuprate dip is generally a strong effect which , for instance , can reach @xmath5 in optimally doped bi@xmath6sr@xmath6ca@xmath6cu@xmath7o@xmath8 ( bi-2223 )",
    "@xcite . it is tempting to attribute this difference of intensities to a difference in the overall coupling strength , as suggested by the largely different @xmath0 values .",

    "tunneling experiments in strongly coupled classical superconductors have been interpreted using a formalism @xcite that neglects the momentum dependence of the eliashberg functions and of the tunneling matrix element , and further assumes that the normal - state dos @xmath13 is constant over the energy range of interest .",

    "hence the scattering rate in 3d is nearly momentum independent and almost constant above @xmath80 .",

    "thus the @xmath38 dispersion simultaneously defeats four players who contribute to make the strong - coupling signatures in the 2d high-@xmath0 superconductors distinctly different from those in 3d metals : the van hove singularity , the particle - hole asymmetry , the momentum dependence , and the strong scattering enhancement at @xmath99 , especially near @xmath91 .    in the curves of figs .",

    "the coherence peaks in the bcs dos are weak logarithmic singularities @xcite while in @xmath3-wave superconductors , they are strong square - root divergences .",
    "the strength of the scattering - rate peak at @xmath80 , and consequently the strength of the dip in the dos and tunneling spectrum , are determined by the strength of the coherence peaks in the bcs dos , as is clear from eq .",

    "( [ eq : sigma ] ) in the @xmath3-wave channel @xcite . still , the strong - coupling signatures appear at the same energy @xmath105  mev in both @xmath2 and @xmath3 wave , due to our choice of the lowest - order model @xmath106 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : sigma ] ) .",
    "the second observation is that the strong - coupling signatures look like steps in the @xmath3-wave dos , like in the classical superconductors @xcite , reflecting the asymmetric shape of the bcs @xmath3-wave coherence peaks .",
    "in contrast , the signatures appear as local minima in the @xmath2-wave dos , because the coherence peaks of the @xmath2-wave bcs dos are nearly symmetric about their maximum .",
    "in short , the strong - coupling features give an `` inverted image '' of the bcs coherence peaks @xcite .",
    "an interesting consequence follows : while in @xmath3-wave superconductors , the strong - coupling structures correspond to _ peaks _ in the second - derivative @xmath1 spectrum , for a @xmath2-wave gap they correspond to _ zeros _ in the @xmath1 spectrum , as demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig4]b .",
