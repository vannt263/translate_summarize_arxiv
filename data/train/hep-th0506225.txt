    "we give a direct evidence of the duality between supersymmetric field theory at strong coupling and supergravity at weak coupling .",
    "this conjectured duality , known as the maldacena conjecture  @xcite , has been studied extensively , and there is considerable qualitative support for it .",
    "most , if not all , of these tests are in some way indirect , because of the difficulty of solving supersymmetric field theories at strong coupling .",
    "the result we present here is unique , in that it is based on a numerical solution of an exactly supersymmetric field theory at strong coupling .",
    "our method is supersymmetric discrete light - cone quantization ( sdlcq )  @xcite .",
    "it is a well established tool for calculations of physical quantities in supersymmetric gauge theory and has been exploited for many supersymmetric yang  mills ( sym ) theories .",
    "briefly , the sdlcq method rests on the ability to produce an exact representation of the superalgebra but is otherwise very similar to discrete light - cone quantization ( dlcq )  @xcite . in dlcq , we compactify the @xmath13 direction by putting the system on a circle with a period of @xmath14 , which discretizes the longitudinal momentum as @xmath15 , with @xmath16 a positive integer . the total longitudinal momentum @xmath17 becomes @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is an integer known as the harmonic resolution  @xcite .",
    "the positivity of the light - cone longitudinal momenta then limits the number of possible fock states for a given @xmath19 , and , thus , the dimension of fock space becomes finite , enabling us to do some numerical computations .",
    "it is assumed that as @xmath19 approaches infinity , the solutions to this large , finite problem approach the solutions of the field theory .",
    "the difference between dlcq and sdlcq lies in the choice of discretizing either @xmath20 or @xmath21 to construct the matrix approximation to the eigenvalue problem @xmath22 , with @xmath23 . for more details and additional discussion of sdlcq",

    "@xcite .    the @xmath0 supersymmetric theory in 1 + 1 dimensions in the large-@xmath1 limit",
    "is discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite ; however , the published results are primitive compared to what can be obtained today , because of our greatly improved hardware and software . in the present paper",
    "we are able to present results for a resolution of @xmath24 . at this resolution",
    "the problem has @xmath2 basis states . by fully exploiting the symmetries of this theory , we only need to deal with a subset of @xmath25 such states",
    ".    we will look at the two - point correlation function of the stress - energy tensor , namely @xmath26 .",
    "the expected behavior in the ultraviolet ( uv ) and infrared ( ir ) regions is @xmath27 , and the predicted behavior in weak - coupling supergravity theory in the intermediate region is  @xcite @xmath28 .",
    "we find the power behavior in @xmath0 theory in the intermediate-@xmath4 region to be consistent with @xmath28 .",
    "an interesting effect in the calculation is that the finite - dimensional representations in sdlcq with odd and even values of @xmath19 result in very distinct solutions of the sym theory .",
    "we saw this result in our work on @xmath6 sym theory in two dimensions  @xcite . only at infinite resolution",
    "are the solutions identical .",
    "one might initially think that having two numerical representations of the supersymmetry is a shortcoming of the sdlcq approach , but it turns out to be an advantage because it provides an internal measure of convergence .",
    "we present new results for the @xmath6 theory , up to resolution @xmath29 , which clearly demonstrate this .",
    "these results for @xmath6 also correct a sign error in our earlier numerical results for @xmath6 .",

    "the reason for this difference is that there are different finite - dimensional representations of the super - algebra  @xcite for even and odd @xmath19 , which only coincide at infinite resolution .",
    "looking at the detailed information of the computation of the correlator at larger @xmath4 , we found that for even @xmath19 there are massless states that contribute to the correlator , while there is no massless state that makes any contribution for odd @xmath19 .",
    "instead , it is the lowest massive states that contribute the most for odd @xmath19 , and these states become massless as the resolution approaches infinity .",
    "the results for the @xmath6 theory are shown in fig .",
    "[ cor_dcor22 ] , and the results for the @xmath97 theory in fig .",
    "[ cor_dcor88 ] .",
    "the results for the @xmath6 theory are obtained for higher resolution and more clearly show the convergence of the two representations .",
    "we are now able to extend our calculation of the @xmath6 sym theory from @xmath24  @xcite to @xmath29 .",
    "to calculate continuum results in sdlcq , it is customary to extrapolate the finite resolution results to infinite resolution .",
    "we have done this for the curves for the @xmath98 and @xmath99 theories by performing the extrapolation at successive values of @xmath4 .",
    "we fit the even and odd resolution points with separate quadratic and cubic functions of @xmath100 to perform four extrapolations .",
    "typical results of these calculations are shown in fig .",
    "[ cor_fit ] for the @xmath101 theory at @xmath102 and at @xmath103 , where @xmath4 is measured in units of @xmath104 .    in the intermediate-@xmath4 region for the @xmath6 theory , clearly the behavior of the correlation in fig .",
    "[ cor_dcor22](a ) changes , and there is a flat region .",

    "note that the region of flattening extends farther out as @xmath19 gets larger , for both odd and even @xmath19 , implying again that the even and odd representations appear to agree as @xmath19 goes to infinity .",
    "unfortunately , there is currently no known prediction for the behavior of the correlator in the intermediate-@xmath4 region this theory or even any reason to believe that the correlator should have a special behavior at intermediate values of @xmath4 .    in the intermediate-@xmath4 region for the @xmath30=(8,8 )",
    "theory , there is a prediction that the correlation should have a special behavior .",
    "this predicted behavior is very different from the behavior we found in the @xmath6 sym theory .",
    "we expect from eq .   that the behavior is @xmath28 . in  @xcite",
    "we found that the correlator may be approaching this behavior , and we indicated that conclusive evidence would be a flat region in the derivative of the scaled correlator at a value of @xmath106 . in fig .",
    "[ cor_dcor88](b ) we see that as @xmath4 increases , the slope approaches @xmath106 .",
    "it overshoots @xmath106 and then appears to approach @xmath106 from below and to remain consistent with that value for an extended range of @xmath4 . beyond this point",
    ", we see that the errors increase significantly .",
    "thus , there is a finite range of intermediate values of @xmath4 over which the numerical solution of strong - coupling sym theory is consistent with the @xmath28 prediction of weak - coupling supergravity .",
    "we have presented numerical results for the two - point correlation function of the stress - energy tensor , using sdlcq in @xmath107 dimensions in the large-@xmath1 approximation , for @xmath6 sym theory up to resolution @xmath29 and for @xmath108 sym theory up to resolution @xmath24 .",
    "there are two distinct classes of representations for these sym theories , one for the resolution @xmath19 even and one for @xmath19 odd , and these representations become identical as @xmath109 . the two - point correlators of the stress - energy tensor",
    "behave like @xmath27 in the uv ( small @xmath4 ) and ir ( large @xmath4 , @xmath19 even ) regions .",
    "the large-@xmath4 behavior for @xmath19 odd , on the other hand , has an exponential decay , since in the odd @xmath19 representations the massless states become massless only as @xmath110 .    while there is no known prediction for the correlator of the stress energy tensor at intermediate values of @xmath4 for the @xmath6 theory , it is interesting that we find the dominant power law behavior @xmath105 .",
    "there is clear convergence over a wide range of intermediate values of @xmath4 .",
    "the results presented here also include a correction to our earlier work on the @xmath6 theory .",
    "we recently found a sign error in one term in our numerical calculations .",
    "this correction does not change the qualitative behavior found in our previous calculation ; the quantitative change is quite small .    in @xmath0 sym theory in @xmath107 dimensions , the correlator is expected to behave like @xmath28 in the intermediate region .",
    "we were able to confirm this power - law behavior with a flat region in the derivative of the scaled correlator .",
    "we have done this by calculating the correlator at successive values of the resolution and extrapolating the function to infinite resolution .",
    "the maximum resolution we reached was @xmath24 .",
    "at that resolution the total number of basis states in the sdlcq approximation is @xmath2 . using all of the symmetries of the @xmath0 theory , including some that are specific to the sector where the correlator is non - vanishing",
    ", we were able to reduce the number of basis states that we needed to consider to @xmath25 .    while just a few years ago it seemed inconceivable that one could reach these resolutions in sdlcq , advances in our understanding of the problem as well as advances in software and hardware have allowed us to do so .",
    "we remain confident that we can , in fact , reach even higher resolutions . at this point",
    "we believe that the most important direction is to increase the number of fields that we consider .",
    "in particular , we are interested in considering theories with both extended supersymmetry and fundamental matter .",
