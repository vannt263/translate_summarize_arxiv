    "the scattering imbalance between up and down spins at the interface between a non - magnetic metal and a ferromagnetic metal is at the heart of the principle of the magnetic tunnel junctions or multilayers celebrated in the field of spintronics @xcite .",
    "although these devices use the quantum mechanical spin degree of freedom and electron tunneling , they do not exploit a crucial degree of freedom involved in quantum mechanics : the phase of the electronic wave function . in most of the devices",
    "studied so far , this aspect has not been developed owing to the classical - like motion of charge carriers in the conductors used @xcite .",
    "quantum wires or molecules have emerged recently as a promising means to convey spin information @xcite . in these systems ,",
    "the electronic gas is confined in two or three directions in space , making quantum effects _ a priori _ prominent . in this context ,",
    "most of the studies have been carried out in two terminal devices , i.e. with two ferromagnetic contacts .",
    "the need for integration and more complex architectures for manipulating spin information @xcite brings on the question of what happens when a spin active nanoscale conductor is connected to more than two reservoirs .",
    "multi - terminal transport has been central in ( spin independent ) mesoscopic physics , in particular with the observation of non - local electric signals due to the delocalization of electronic wave functions @xcite .",
    "can this quantum mechanical non - locality survive and ultimately be exploited in spintronics devices combining nanoscale conductors and ferromagnets ?     for sample",
    "i as a function of the external magnetic field @xmath0 for side gate voltages @xmath1 , @xmath2 and a back gate voltage @xmath3 . ]    in this article , we address this question through multi - terminal spin dependent transport measurements in single wall carbon nanotubes ( swnts ) with ferromagnetic and non - magnetic contacts .",
    "non - local voltage and conductance measurements reveal that the spin as well as the orbital phase are conserved along the whole active part of our swnts .",
    "we observe a _",
    "non - local spin field effect transistor_-like action which is a natural consequence of quantum interference in a few channel conductor . in spite of the inherent complexity of the spectrum of our devices , we can account well for our findings using a simple theory based on a scattering approach .",
    "these results bridge between mesoscopic physics and spintronics .",
    "they open an avenue for nanospintronics devices exploiting both the spin and the orbital phase degrees of freedom , which could provide new means to manipulate the electronic spin , because the orbital phase of the carriers can easily be coupled to the local electric field in nanoscale conductors .",
    "the principle of non - local transport measurements is to use a multi - terminal structure with two terminals playing the roles of source and drain , and the others the role of non - local voltage probes .",
    "since the pioneering work by johnson and silsbee in metals@xcite , non - local spin dependent voltages have been studied in various multichannel diffusive circuits based on semiconducting heterostructures@xcite , metallic islands@xcite and graphene@xcite .",
    "these signals are well captured using a _ classical _ bipartite resistors network , with two branches corresponding to opposite spin directions @xcite .",
    "the non - local spin signal stems from the imbalance between the up spin and down spin branches of the network , which reflects the imbalances between e.g. the two spin populations .",
    "importantly , this interpretation is valid only when one can neglect quantum mechanical non - local signals which arise from the delocalization of the carrier s wave function .",
    "coherence effects induce only corrections to transport at low temperatures in metals or semiconducting heterostructures which involve many conducting channels@xcite .",
    "in contrast , coherence becomes essential in understanding transport in molecules or quantum wires where quantum mechanics primarily controls conduction .",
    "the studies of non - local spin transport in the coherent regime have been elusive so far .",
    "here , we use the high versatility of single wall carbon nanotubes ( swnt ) to achieve the required devices and to explore these phenomena .",

    "our devices are made out of a swnt connected to 4 electrodes labelled 1,2,3 and 4 from the left to the right , with 2 and 3 ferromagnetic @xmath5 electrodes and 1 and 4 non - magnetic @xmath6 electrodes .",
    "in addition , the device is capacitively coupled to a back - gate electrode with voltage @xmath7 and two side gate electrodes with respective voltages @xmath8 and @xmath9 , acting mainly on sections @xmath10 and @xmath11 of the nanotube respectively . throughout the paper ,",
    "the temperature is set to @xmath12 .",
    "a sem picture of a typical device is shown in figure [ devicesem]a .",
    "we use chemical vapor deposition with a standard methane process to fabricate our swnts on a si substrate .",
    "we localize the swnts with respect to au alignment markers by scanning electron microscopy ( sem ) or atomic force microscopy ( afm ) .",
    "we fabricate the contacts and gates using standard e - beam lithography and thin film deposition techniques .",
    "we deposit the normal and the ferromagnetic contacts in one fabrication step using shadow evaporation techniques .",
    "the central ferromagnetic electrodes consist of a 30nm - thick @xmath13 layer below a 70nm - thick @xmath6 layer .",
    "the normal contacts consist of 70 nm of pd .",
    "such a method allows to achieve two probe resistances as low as 30kohm between the normal and the ferromagnetic reservoirs .",
    "in addition to the highly doped si substrate with @xmath14 @xmath15 which is used as a global backgate , we fabricate two side gates whose voltages @xmath8 and @xmath9 are used to modulate transport in our devices . each nanotube section defined in this manner",

    "our measurements are carried out applying an ac bias voltage @xmath18 of about @xmath19 to @xmath20 between the normal electrode @xmath21 and the ferromagnetic electrode @xmath22 , at a typical frequency of @xmath23 .",
    "this generates a finite non local voltage @xmath24 between the ferromagnetic electrode @xmath25 and the normal electrode @xmath26 .",
    "we also measure simultaneously the conductance @xmath27 .",
    "note that a finite @xmath24 has already been observed in similar but non - magnetic devices due to coherent propagation of electrons in the swnt and lifting of the k / k degeneracy@xcite . here , we focus on the specific effects due to ferromagnetic leads .",
    "a spin contrast is obtained by comparing the electric signals in the parallel ( p ) configuration ( magnetizations of electrodes 2 and 3 pointing in the same direction ) and in the ( ap ) configuration ( magnetizations pointing in opposite directions ) .",
    "a finite magnetic field is applied in plane parallel to the easy axis of the ferromagnetic electrodes ( for samples i and iii ) , which is transverse as shown by mfm characterization carried out at room temperature ( see figure [ devicesem]b ) .",
    "the observed magnetic contrast shows the presence of large transverse domains of a typical size of @xmath28 . due to the different widths of respectively @xmath29 and @xmath30 , the coercive fields of the two ferromagnetic electrodes are different .",
    "generally , this leads to a sharp switching at about @xmath31 for one of the electrodes .",
    "for the lower field switching , it turns out to be more difficult to obtain systematically switchings as sharp as those of sample i. the p and ap configuration can be obtained selectively by sweeping the external magnetic field .",
    "we determine @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "the magnetic field dependence of the non - local voltage @xmath24 of sample i is shown in figure [ device]b . upon increase and decrease of the external magnetic field @xmath0 , the characteristic hysteretic switching of a spin valve is observed .",
    "we observe sharp switchings which show that the external field is well aligned with the magnetic anisotropy of both electrodes in this case . upon increasing @xmath0 ( see red line in figure 1b ) , we obtain the ap configuration for @xmath34 $ ] , and the p configuration otherwise . for the particular gate voltage set used in figure [ device]b ,",
    "@xmath24 changes from @xmath35 to @xmath36 upon switching from the p to the ap configuration , leading to a finite @xmath37 . unlike the majority of our samples",
    ", this spin signal is superimposed to an intrinsic background here ( see discussion in section iv ) .",
    "a finite @xmath37 has already reported in multichannel incoherent diffusive conductors @xcite .",
    "one of the main results of the present work is the observation of a _ gate control _ of @xmath37 , as a consequence of quantum interferences , which contrasts with these previous works .",
    "such a fact not only sheds light on the peculiar nature of spin injection in coherent few channel conductors , but also allows to rule out non - spin injection effects related to stray fields for example as we will see in section iv .",
    "as soon as a metallic electrode is deposited on the top of a swnt , a scattering region is created below the contact , which partially decouples the two sides of the nanotube defined by the electrode .",
    "the multi - dot nature of our devices appears on figure [ greyscale]a , where @xmath38 is represented in a greyscale plot as a function of @xmath8 and @xmath9 for sample i. we observe white horizontal and vertical stripes , rather regularly spaced , which correspond to negative anti - resonances in @xmath38 .",
    "such a `` tartan '' pattern is very much alike the stability diagram of a double quantum dot in the electrostatically decoupled regime @xcite .",
    "the stripes correspond to discrete energy levels `` engineered '' by defining the 3 different sections of the nanotube with the 4 electrodes .",
    "the fact that horizontal as well as vertical stripes are observed shows that the side gate electrodes control essentially independently different parts of the device , which carry different energy levels .",
    "our devices can be seen as a series of three fabry - perot electronic interferometers with local gate control .",
    "the nature of the coupling between these interferometers is a crucial question for the development of orbitally phase coherent spintronics .     of sample i in the p configuration .",

    "the prediction from the multi - terminal scattering theory of ref .",
    "27 with the parameters described in the appendix . ]",
    "one can measure the spin signals by placing the system in the remanent state of magnetization either in the p or in the ap configuration ( for samples with a sufficiently high stability ) .",
    "this is done by imposing to the device a `` minor loop '' which is represented in figure [ greyscale]b .",
    "in such a cycle , the magnetic field is swept in such a way as to reverse selectively one magnetization without reversing the other .",
    "depending on how the external field is swept back to zero , one can reach either the p or the ap configuration .",
    "then , for each of these configurations , we measure in a single shot the gate dependence of @xmath24 .",
    "this method has been used to obtain @xmath37 in figure 2c .",
    "the existence of quasi bound - states inside the nanotube induces variations of both @xmath24 and @xmath37 as a function of the gate voltages .",
    "this effect can be observed when @xmath9 is swept , @xmath8 being kept constant , for example ( see fig .",
    "[ greyscale]c ) .",
    "the interference fringes observed correspond to the `` tartan '' pattern of figure [ greyscale]a . for @xmath1 and @xmath3 , @xmath38 and @xmath39 evolve almost in parallel as a function of @xmath9 .",
    "this results in a weakly gate dependent @xmath37 with a constant positive sign as shown in figure [ greyscale]c . we find that @xmath38 and @xmath39 can be of opposite sign , as well as of the same sign depending on the values of @xmath9 and @xmath8 . in carbon nanotubes ,",
    "this phenomenon originates both from transverse and longitudinal size quantization .    in the spectroscopy of our devices ,",
    "coulomb blockade effects are generally absent ( see e.g. fig . [ nonlocalmr]b ) .",
    "this motivates a comparison between our data and the non - interacting scattering model of ref .",
    "27 ( see appendix for details ) .",
    "this model uses four scattering channels , to account for the up / down spins and the k and k orbitals of carbon nanotubes . for simplicity ,",
    "we assume that the spin and k / k degrees of freedom are conserved along the whole device . between two consecutive contacts @xmath40 and @xmath41 , electrons acquire a `` winding '' quantum mechanical phase @xmath42 .",
    "the effect of each metal / nanotube contact is described with a scattering matrix which depends on the contact transmission probability . in the case of a ferromagnetic contact",
    ", we also take into account the spin - polarisation of the transmission probabilities and the spin dependence of interfacial phase shifts @xcite .",
    "this scattering model is fully coherent , i.e. the phase of the electronic wave function is conserved even when electrons pass in the nanotube sections below the ferromagnetic contacts 2 and 3 .",
    "the results of the scattering theory of ref .",
    "27 , shown in magenta in figure [ greyscale]c , are in qualitative agreement with our data .",
    "the variations of @xmath38 are well accounted for as well as the sign and the order of magnitude of @xmath37 .",
    "importantly , the coherent model of ref .",
    "27 involves resonance loops which are extended on several sections of the nanotube , e.g. between leads 1 and 3 .",
    "the gate modulations of @xmath38 as well as the gate dependence of @xmath37 is a natural consequence of delocalization of the electronic wave function in our devices . similarly to optics ,",
    "the multiple reflections at the contacts give rise to ( electronic ) interference which lead to gate modulations of the physical signals .",
    "it is important to note that the origin of this gate modulation is not related to the spin - orbit interaction which lead to energy splittings of the order of @xmath43 in swnts@xcite .",
    "this fact will become even clearer in section v where we identify the energy scale responsible of the modulations as the single particle level spacing of one of the nt section ( namely section @xmath10 ) .",
    "finally , it is important to note that here , contrary to the multichannel diffusive case , coherence naturally couples the spin and the charge of carriers .",
    "therefore , a non - local measurement does not `` separate spin and charge transport '' as is often stated@xcite in the coherent few channel case .",
    "rather , it gives a new path for manipulating spin information with electric fields at low temperature .",
    "for sample i as a function of the external magnetic field @xmath0 for @xmath44 and @xmath45 . the curves for @xmath46 has been shifted up to make them coincide with those for @xmath44 at zero field . ]",
    "as one can see in figure [ device]b , there is a finite background for the non - local voltage as a function of the magnetic field , superimposed to the hysteresis .",
    "this might question the effect of the stray fields on the observed signals .",
    "note , however , that no background is observed in figure [ nonlocal]a and c , a behavior which is common to the majority of our samples",
    ". this makes the device essentially insensitive to stray fields for the majority of samples studied . in order to rule out the stray field effects for sample i",
    ", we present in figure [ background ] hysteresis loops for two of the different gate voltages , namely @xmath44 and @xmath46 . the curves for @xmath46",
    "have been shifted up to make them coincide with those for @xmath44 at zero field .",
    "as one can see on this figure , while the backgrounds are almost exactly the same ( up to small gate shifts ) , the mv s clearly differ .",
    "therefore , the observed gate dependence of the mv for sample i can not be attributed to stray field effects .",

    "this contrasts with our devices as shown in fig .",
    "[ nonlocal]b and d where @xmath57 is obtained . in order to show that the spin signals observed in @xmath51 and @xmath24 arise from a property of the device as a whole ,",

    ", the external magnetic field has been applied in plane , _ perpendicular to the magnetic anisotropy _ of the ferromagnetic electrodes . in such a situation",
    ", the motion of the magnetic domains often displays a complex behavior which is revealed by the complex switching features of both @xmath24 and @xmath51 in figure [ nonlocal]a and b. because of their complexity , these features show that the hysteretic behaviors of @xmath24 and @xmath51 have strong correlations .",
    "as expected , we obtain more regular switchings if the magnetic field is applied _ along _ the easy axis anisotropy , as shown in figures [ device]b , [ nonlocal]c and [ nonlocal]d . as highlighted by the vertical dashed green lines , both the shape and the sign of the spin signals",
    "are again strongly correlated , which confirms that they have the same physical origin i.e. the change in the relative magnetic configuration of the two ferromagnetic contacts . due to quantum interferences , @xmath58 naturally depends on @xmath9 ( see figure [ nonlocal]b and [ nonlocal]d)@xcite .",
    "therefore , we observe a spin field effect transistor action which is non - local with respect to the position of both the ferromagnetic electrodes and the gates .",
    "note that in figure [ nonlocal]a and [ nonlocal]c , we observe a _ negative _ @xmath37 .",

    "the simultaneous measurement of @xmath51 and @xmath58 as a function of @xmath9 is shown in figure [ nonlocalmr]c . here , we have measured @xmath58 versus @xmath9 by recording a full hysteresis cycle for each set of gate voltages . as shown on the bottom panel , @xmath59 oscillates from @xmath65 to @xmath66 when @xmath9 is swept .",
    "oscillations of about @xmath67 are also found in @xmath58 .",
    "the solid magenta lines correspond to the result of the scattering theory at @xmath68 .",
    "we find a very good agreement with our experimental findings . from the theoretical fit of figure [ nonlocalmr]c , we conclude that @xmath58 varies due to changes in @xmath69 but also @xmath70 and @xmath71 .",
    "first , the gate electrode 2 , which is nearby section 34 of the device , also acts on @xmath71 and @xmath70 thanks to the long range nature of coulomb interaction ( an effect described e.g. by @xmath72 in the appendix ) .",
    "second , the @xmath58 signal is also affected by @xmath9 due to the spatial extension of the carriers wave function over the whole device . the non - local transistor - like action shown in figure",

    "importantly , in figure [ nonlocalmr]c , the position of the maxima in @xmath59 do not coincide with those of @xmath58 as highlighted by the vertical orange dashed lines .",
    "this reveals that @xmath73 oscillates in a similar fashion as @xmath59 but with a _",
    "different phase_. the phase shift between @xmath59 and @xmath73 clearly illustrates that the phase of the carriers is conserved upon scattering below the ferromagnetic contact 2 . indeed , this effect can only be explained by invoking coherent electronic wave functions which extend from contact 1 to 3 at least , and give rise to spin - dependent resonance effects sensitive to the magnetic configuration of both leads 2 and 3 .",
    "the theoretical curve of figure [ nonlocalmr]c reproduces accurately this effect .",
    "we conclude that , in our devices , both the spin and the orbital phase are conserved over the whole active part of the nanotube , _ even below the ferromagnetic contacts_.",
    "in this work , we have studied various non - local transport phenomena in single wall carbon nanotubes connnected to two ferromagnetic and two normal electrodes . these multiterminal spintronics",

    "27 ) . due to the unitarity of the contact scattering matrices , the transmission from lead 2(3 ) to the nanotube",
    "is set by the above parameters .",
    "the results of the scattering theory at @xmath68 shown in magenta correspond to the set@xmath82 in figure [ greyscale]c and to the set@xmath83 in figure [ nonlocalmr]c .",
    "the capacitances are in @xmath84 units . for the second case ,",
    "contrarily to the case of sample i , we had to include a finite sdips at the ferromagnetic contacts to enhance the amplitude of the oscillations in @xmath58 @xcite .",

    "we use a coarse - grained version of the poisson equation which we solve self - consistently in order to determine the different side gate actions . our calculation proceeds along the lines of ref . @xcite .",
    "we start with the full electrostatic matrix capacitance of our devices which can be derived from the electrostatic diagram of figure [ electrostatics ] .",

    "this would go beyond the scope of this work .",
    "for the sake of simplicity , we assign a constant value for the electrochemical capacitance of each section .",
    "this assumption is reasonable in our case because the high coupling of the swnt to the normal electrodes reduces the energy dependence of the electrochemical capacitance .",
    "the self - consistent equation for the electrostatic potential of each nt section reads :          for a realistic set of capacitances @xmath99 of about @xmath100 , we find @xmath101 and @xmath102 which are in good agreement with the observed slopes in the different tartan patterns .",
    "for example , for the above parameters , we get the following coupling matrix : @xmath103 for each fitting procedure , one has to adjust the values of the @xmath101 and the @xmath102 in order to account for the gate dependence of the observed signals .",
