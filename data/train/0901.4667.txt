    "fflo superconductivity was predicted in 1960 s by fulde and ferrel  @xcite and also by larkin and ovchinnikov  @xcite .",
    "in addition to the u@xmath2-gauge symmetry , a spatial symmetry is spontaneously broken in the fflo state owing to the modulation of superconducting ( sc ) order parameter .",
    "after nearly 40 years of fruitless experimental search for fflo states , recent experiments appeared to give first evidences for such a phase  @xcite .",
    "moreover , fflo phase is attracting growing interests in other related fields such as the cold fermion gases  @xcite and the high - density quark matter  @xcite .",
    "extensive studies of fflo state had been triggered by the discovery of a novel sc phase at high fields and low temperatures in the heavy fermion superconductor cecoin@xmath1  @xcite .",
    "possible fflo states have been discovered also in some organic materials  @xcite .",
    "all of these candidate materials are close to the antiferromagnetic quantum critical point ( afqcp ) , and then the @xmath0-wave superconductivity is expected .",
    "although it has been expected that the afqcp significantly influences the superconducting state , almost all of the theoretical works on the fflo state are based on the weak coupling theory and neglect the antiferromagnetism . we have examined the fflo state near afqcp by analyzing the two dimensional hubbard model using the flex approximation , and found that the @xmath0-wave fflo state is stable in the vicinity of afqcp owing to some strong coupling effects  @xcite .",
    "another intriguing relationship between fflo superconductivity and antiferromagnetism has been indicated in cecoin@xmath1 .",
    "several experimental results suggest the emergence of a fflo state in cecoin@xmath1  @xcite . on the other hand , nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) and",
    "neutron scattering data rather indicate the presence of antiferromagnetic ( afm ) order in the high field phase of cecoin@xmath1  @xcite .",
    "the pressure dependence of phase diagram  @xcite seems to be incompatible with the afm order in the uniform sc state , because the afm order is suppressed by the pressure in the other ce - based heavy fermions  @xcite while the high field phase of cecoin@xmath1 is stabilized by the pressure  @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is expected that the coexistent state of fflo superconductivity and afm order is realized in cecoin@xmath1 at ambient pressure , where the afm moment is induced by the andreev bound states around the fflo nodal plane  @xcite",
    ".    another important issue of fflo superconductivity is the role of disorders . in this paper",
    ", we investigate the @xmath0-wave fflo state near the afqcp in the presence of randomness on the the basis of the mean field bdg equations .",
    "the roles of disorder on the fflo state has been investigated by many authors  @xcite , and it has been shown that the fflo state is suppressed by the disorders . however , the disorder average is approximately taken in these studies , and therefore , the regular spatial structure is artificially restored .",
    "the spatial inhomogeneity is accurately taken into account using the bdg equations adopted in this paper .",
    "we focus on the spatial structure of the disordered fflo state and clarify the relationship with the magnetic properties .",
    "the spatial structure of @xmath3-wave fflo state in the presence of weak box disorder has been investigated in ref .",
    "it is expected that the response to the disorder is quite different between the @xmath3-wave superconductor and @xmath0-wave one , because the @xmath3-wave superconductivity is robust against the disorder in accordance with the anderson s theorem  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0-wave fflo state in the presence of moderately weak point disorders has been investigated , and the configuration transition from two - dimensional structure to one - dimensional one has been pointed out  @xcite .    in this paper , we show that the spatial structure of disordered fflo states significantly depend on the feature of disorders . in case of weak box disorders , the sc order parameter has distorted nodes , while more complicated spatial structure indicating the fflo glass state is induced by the strong point disorders . in the former , the magnetic properties are governed by the spatial nodes of sc order parameters , on which the local spin susceptibility is larger than that in the normal state . on the other hand , the magnetic properties are dominated by the disorder - induced - antiferromagnetism in the latter .",
    "it is expected that most of our results are generally applicable to the fflo state with non-@xmath3-wave paring .",
    "for example , the spatial structure of sc order parameter is independent of the details of hamiltonian . on the other hand ,",
    "the disorder - induced - antiferromagnetism is a characteristic property of systems near afqcp .",
    "therefore , the magnetic properties in the presence of point disorders are significantly affected by the afqcp .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in  2",
    ", we formulate the bdg theory for the microscopic model which describes the d - wave superconductivity near afqcp . the phase diagram for the magnetic field and temperature in the clean limit",

    "we investigated the disordered fflo state with focus on the spatial structure of sc order parameter and the magnetic properties .",
    "in particular , the @xmath0-wave superconductivity near the afqcp has been investigated in details .",
    "it has been shown that the spatial dependence of sc order parameter is relatively simple in case of the box disorder ; the fflo nodal plane is modulated . on the other hand ,",
    "the spatial structure is complicated in the presence of point disorders .",
    "then , the spatial nodes are strongly pinned to the locally dirty region .",
    "there are many configurations in which the nodes are pinned to the point disorders , and therefore a glassy behaviour appears .",
    "we called this state `` fflo glass '' in analogy with the vortex glass state .",
    "we have shown that the magnetic properties in the sc state significantly depend on the character of disorders . in the fflo state with box disorders ,",
    "the magnetic properties are governed by the nodal plane of sc order parameters , on which the local spin susceptibility is larger than that in the normal state . on the other hand , the magnetic properties in the bcs state",
    "are mainly determined by the quasiparticle interference effect , which gives rise to an oscillation with a small amplitude .",
    "a weak disorder - induced - antiferromagnetism is induced by the inhomogeneity of sc order parameters in the bcs state as well as in the fflo state .",
    "the magnetic properties are dominated by the disorder - induced - antiferromagnetism in the presence of point disorders .",
    "we found that the disorder - induced - antiferromagnetism is enhanced by the superconductivity in both bcs and fflo states .",
    "the local spin susceptibility in the locally clean region is suppressed in the bcs state , while that is increased in the fflo state owing to the spatial nodes of sc order parameter .",
    "finally , we examine the distribution function of local spin susceptibility @xmath91 and discuss the nmr measurements for cecoin@xmath1 .",
    "it has been known that the distribution function shows a double peak structure in the fflo state in the clean limit  @xcite .",
    "we have shown that the two peaks merge into the single peak in the presence of box disorders and/or point disorders .",
    "however , the distribution function is affected in a different way by the box disorder and point disorder .",
    "the single peak structure is induced by the box disorders because of the displacement of fflo nodes , while the disorder - induced - antiferromagnetism is the main cause of the broad single peak in the presence of point disorders .",
    "we can distinguish these two cases by analyzing the line width of @xmath91 .",
    "the line shape of @xmath91 is very broad and its width does not change through the bcs - fflo transition in case of the point disorder ( fig .",
    "this is because the local antiferromagnetism occurs near the point disorders in both bcs and fflo states ( fig .",
    "8) . on the other hand ,",
    "the line shape is significantly broadened in the fflo state through the bcs - fflo transition in case of the box disorders , as shown in fig .",
    "the latter seems to be consistent with the nmr measurement for cecoin@xmath1 at the in(1 ) site  @xcite .",
    "another nmr spectrum at the in(2 ) site has shown the double peak structure with large splitting and indicated the afm order in the high field phase of cecoin@xmath1  @xcite . a clear experimental evidence for the afm order has been obtained by the recent neutron scattering measurement  @xcite .",
    "we have shown that the afm order can occur in the fflo state near the afqcp and the phase diagram suggested in refs .",
    "@xcite is consistent with the coexistence of antiferromagnetism and fflo superconductivity  @xcite .",
    "although the double peak structure of the nmr line shape is also induced by the disorder - induced - antiferromagnetism ( fig .",
    "9 ) , this is not the case in cecoin@xmath1 .",
    "the direction of the afm moment is parallel to the applied magnetic field in case of the disorder - induced - antiferromagnetism .",
    "however , the neutron scattering measurement shows the magnetic moment perpendicular to the magnetic field  @xcite , which means the spontaneous symmetry breaking .",
    "therefore , the true long range order of antiferromagnetism seems to occur in the experiments of refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "our results in this paper suggest that the single peak structure of nmr spectrum at in(1 ) site , which is less sensitive to the afm order than in(2 ) site , can be caused by the disorder .",
    "but , the afm order may be another cause .",
    "we are planning to investigate the magnetic properties in the coexistent state of afm order and fflo superconductivity . from the experimental point of view",
    ", it would be interesting to investigate the pressure effect in cecoin@xmath1 .",
    "it is expected that the afm order is suppressed by the pressure while the fflo superconductivity is enhanced  @xcite .",
    "the latter has been observed in ref .",
    "therefore , the pure fflo state may be realized at high pressures .",
    "according to these considerations , the point disorder is not the main source of the randomness in cecoin@xmath1 .",
    "however , the point disorder can be induced by substituting ce ions with la ions or in ions with cd ions .",
    "thus , ce@xmath110la@xmath111coin@xmath1 and cecoin@xmath112cd@xmath113  @xcite will be an intriguing playground of the fflo superconductivity with point disorders .    in summary ,",
    "we investigated the fflo superconducting state in the presence of randomness .",
    "the spatial structure of sc order parameter and magnetic properties are clarified in details .",
    "it has been proposed that the experimental results on cecoin@xmath1 can be understood by assuming the fflo state realized in the high field phase and taking into account both the afm spin correlation and a weak disorder .",
