    "progress requires improved observational constraints on the properties of dense gas clumps that are on the verge of massive star and star cluster formation , such as the cold , high column density clouds that reveal themselves as irdcs , silhouetted against the mir emission from the galactic diffuse interstellar medium ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "this method has the disadvantage of requiring knowledge of both the emissivity and temperature of dust in the cloud .",
    "single dish observations are needed to recover the total flux , but these have relatively poor angular resolution ( e.g. 11  fwhm angular resolution for the @xmath14 mm observations of @xcite with the iram @xmath15 m telescope ; @xmath1622  for the @xmath17 observations of @xcite with _",

    "extinction mapping is a temperature - independent method to probe cloud structure .",

    "furthermore , the location of irdcs at @xmath22kpc distances in the crowded galactic plane , with nir sources at a range of distances , necessitates statistical methods that limit the effective angular resolution of the maps to @xmath23 .",
    "thus , mir extinction ( mirex ) mapping has proven more effective at probing irdcs , e.g. with 2  angular resolution achieved with _ spitzer_-irac glimpse @xcite @xmath0 images ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "using the foreground estimation method of @xcite , the maximum @xmath10 that can be probed depends on the noise level of the images : a @xmath24 level of @xmath25mjy / sr for glimpse images leads to a maximum , `` saturation '' , mass surface density of @xmath26 for typical inner galaxy irdcs . since it compares specific intensities towards the irdc with those of its surroundings , mirex mapping has difficulties at lower @xmath10 values , where it tends to underestimate true extinctions by @xmath27mag .",
    "this deficiency can be fixed by combining mir and nir - derived maps @xcite .    here",

    "the final combined image consists of 12 mosaiced @xmath41 pointings , resulting in @xmath42 regions that have different total exposures , @xmath43 noise and instrumental background levels ( figure  [ fig : cloudc]a ) . for each region with area",

    "apply an offset to each saturated region equal to the difference between @xmath50 and its local value .",
    "we expect these offsets result from varying instrumental background noise .",

    "the average estimate of @xmath52 is @xmath53mjy / sr ( @xmath54mjy / sr greater than the @xcite value ) .",
    "lack of areal coverage of the archival data means we must use the background model derived from glimpse @xcite .",

    "the above equation for @xmath67 is also useful for seeing the effect of errors in estimating the background specific intensity , @xmath30 .",
    "this is expected to show fluctuations about the median interpolated level : @xcite find the hwhm of the distribution of background intensities around irdc c to be a factor of 1.2 .",
    "this introduces an error of @xmath70 , which is only a @xmath71 error for @xmath72 , growing to 20% in the optically thin limit .    in several locations ,",
    "@xmath10 `` holes '' are seen , where @xmath10 is significantly lower than the surrounding pixels .",
    "this could be caused by the presence of a real mir - bright point source or by an instrumental artifact , such as a bad pixel .",
    "to identify the latter , we use the original glimpse @xmath73 image as a reference .",
    "if there is no source in the glimpse image , then the hole in the new image is corrected by replacing the bad pixel with the mean of the nearest unaffected pixels .",
    "this typically occurs far from any of the centers of our core sample (  [ s : cores ] ) , with the exception of c1 , which had a hole directly adjacent to core center .",
    "finally , we follow @xcite to merge the mirex map with a nir extinction map of the region , derived using the method of @xcite and data from the _ ukirt / galactic plane survey _ @xcite . the technique estimates nir extinction towards background stars by comparing their nir colors to those of stars in a nearby reference field .",
    "the zero - point calibration uncertainty is estimated to be @xmath3mag . to combine the nir and mir extinction maps ,",
    "a relative dust opacity - law of @xmath74 is adopted @xcite .",
    "the net effect of the combination is a zero point shift of the mirex map by @xmath27mag , which varies at the resolution of the nir map of 30 . in regions where @xmath75mag , the nir map is not accurate so we interpolate its value from surrounding regions .",

    "some stars have started to form in irdc c ( e.g. the mir - bright sources ; see also * ? ? ?",

    "the pdf shows no indication of a high - end power law tail ( indeed there is no room for such a tail if the pdf peak is dominated by the log - normal ) , observed in some clouds ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ) ( however , see * ? ? ?",
    "since the observed line - widths (  [ s : dynamics ] ) indicate the overall cloud is self - gravitating , this may imply that a self - similar , self - gravitating hierarchy of structure is present over the complete range of spatial scales in the cloud probed by our extinction map and that such a hierarchy produces a log - normal - like @xmath10 pdf ( see also * ? ? ?",

    "<S> we use deep @xmath0 spitzer - irac imaging of a massive infrared dark cloud ( irdc ) g028.37 + 00.07 to construct a mid - infrared ( mir ) extinction map that probes mass surface densities up to @xmath1 ( @xmath2mag ) , amongst the highest values yet probed by extinction mapping . </S>",
    "<S> merging with a nir extinction map of the region , creates a high dynamic range map that reveals structures down to @xmath3mag . </S>",
    "<S> we utilize the map to : ( 1 ) measure a cloud mass @xmath4 within a radius of @xmath5pc . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath6co kinematics indicate that the cloud is gravitationally bound . </S>",
    "<S> it thus has the potential to form one of the most massive young star clusters known in the galaxy . </S>",
    "<S> ( 2 ) characterize the structures of 16 massive cores within the irdc , finding they can be fit by singular polytropic spheres with @xmath7 and @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> they have @xmath9  relatively low values that , along with their measured cold temperatures , suggest magnetic fields , rather than accretion - powered radiative heating , are important for controlling fragmentation of these cores . ( 3 ) determine the @xmath10 ( equivalently column density or @xmath11 ) probability distribution function ( pdf ) for a region that is near complete for @xmath12mag . </S>",
    "<S> the pdf is well fit by a single log - normal with mean @xmath13mag , high compared to other known clouds . it does not exhibit a separate high - end power law tail , which has been claimed to indicate the importance of self - gravity </S>",
    "<S> however , we suggest that the pdf does result from a self - similar , self - gravitating hierarchy of structure being present over a wide range of scales in the cloud . </S>"
