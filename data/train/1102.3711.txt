    "consider a simple model of a vortex in a thin film disk with thickness @xmath1 .",
    "we estimate the core energy and how it varies with the reduction in the magnetization in the pinning potential for both fixed @xmath38 and fixed @xmath46 .",
    "we model the pinning potential as a circular region of radius @xmath63 of uniformly reduced magnetization @xmath69 .",
    "we assume that the vortex can be described as a core region within a radius @xmath70 where the magnetization points out of plane , and an outer region @xmath71 where the magnetization is directed azimuthally .",
    "our approach is to estimate the change in vortex energy as @xmath69 is varied in the pinning potential region , @xmath72 . for simplicity , we just consider the case for @xmath73 .    in the core region , the magnetization is uniform , and the energy density is magnetostatic , thus we can approximate the energy of the core as @xmath74 in this expression we have assumed that @xmath75 for simplicity .",
    "the divergence of the magnetization in the outside region , @xmath76 , is zero and the magnetization is perpendicular to the stray fields from the core region , so the energy in the outside region is entirely exchange energy .",
    "since the magnetization outside @xmath63 does not depend on @xmath69 and the geometry of the vortex is fixed ( exactly in this simple model and approximately in a full simulation ) , the energy of the magnetization from @xmath63 out to @xmath77 , the radius of the disk , does not change . ignoring that constant contribution leaves the @xmath69-dependent change in the exchange energy from @xmath70 to @xmath63 @xmath78 as a further approximation",
    ", we ignore any exchange energy associated with the sharp transition from vertical to in - plane magnetization at the core boundary , @xmath70 .",
    "so far , the core radius has been left as a variable , and we determine its value by minimizing the total energy @xmath79 .",
    "the result is @xmath80 and the minimized energy is @xmath81\\ ] ] or equivalently , @xmath82.\\ ] ]    therefore , from eqs .",
    "( [ eq : e_a ] ) and ( [ eq : e_lex ] ) , the ratio of the total energy changes using constant @xmath38 compared to constant @xmath46 is @xmath83 for @xmath63 = 10  nm and @xmath46 = 5.7  nm , the ratio is @xmath84 2.1 . that is , the energy is more sensitive to variations in @xmath69 for fixed @xmath46 than for fixed @xmath38 .",
    "with @xmath38 fixed , a decrease in @xmath69 results in an expansion of the core radius [ see eq .",
    "( [ eq : lex ] ) ] such that the decreased magnetostatic energy density within the core is compensated by an increased core volume , yielding no net change in the magnetostatic energy .",
    "the net energy change is due to a decrease in the exchange energy as the region @xmath85 becomes smaller as @xmath70 increases .",
    "in contrast , for fixed @xmath46 , the geometry of the core is fixed , and there is a decrease in the magnetostatic energy of the core associated with a decrease in @xmath69 .",
    "further , with @xmath46 fixed it can be seen from ( [ eq : lex ] ) that @xmath38 must decrease with @xmath86 , and this results in reduced exchange energy calculated in the region @xmath87 .",

    "<S> a vortex gyrating in a magnetic disk has two regimes of motion in the presence of disorder . at large gyration amplitudes , </S>",
    "<S> the vortex core moves quasi - freely through the disorder potential . </S>",
    "<S> as the amplitude decreases , the core can become pinned at a particular point in the potential and precess with a significantly increased frequency . in the pinned regime , </S>",
    "<S> the amplitude of the gyration decreases more rapidly than it does at larger precession amplitudes in the quasi - free regime . in part , this decreased decay time is due to an increase in the effective damping constant and in part due to geometric distortion of the vortex . a simple model with a single pinning potential illustrates these two contributions . </S>"
