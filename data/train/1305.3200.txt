    "the measurement of a rather large reactor mixing angle by the daya bay  @xcite , reno  @xcite , and double chooz  @xcite collaborations adds further complexity to an already difficult puzzle of flavour .",
    "perhaps the best way to address this dilemma is to utilise the methods developed in the era of an unmeasured reactor angle and introduce an additional discrete family symmetry , @xmath6 , under which all fields transform .",
    "this family symmetry will then be spontaneously broken in order to generate the observed fermionic masses and mixings @xcite .",
    "however before even considering the construction of a model , it may be insightful to know some of the possible candidate symmetries for @xmath6 .",
    "herein lies the goal of this work , shedding light on a particular class of candidates for @xmath6 , i.e. the @xmath0 groups .    in the following text , we demand that the discrete group @xmath6 be a subgroup of the continuous group @xmath7 ( or @xmath8 ) because its fundamental representation is @xmath9-dimensional .",
    "we further restrict ourselves to working with the @xmath10 subgroups of @xmath7 due to the past and current popularity of @xmath11 ( @xmath12 ) in flavour model building ( see @xcite and references contained therein ) as well as recent publications demonstrating that @xmath13 ( @xmath14)@xcite , @xmath15 ( @xmath16)@xcite , @xmath17 ( @xmath18)@xcite and @xmath19 ( @xmath20)@xcite generate phenomenologically viable predictions for the lepton mixing angles .",
    "in contrast to the above studies , here we consider the infinite series of groups @xmath0 as candidates for a family symmetry group .",
    "we exploit the presentation of the @xmath0 series to elucidate all possible mixing patterns resulting from all possible klein subgroups for each @xmath0 group where @xmath1 is an even integer .",
    "we consider only @xmath0 groups where @xmath1 is even because these are the only cases which can contain a _ complete _",
    "klein subgroup , i.e. all _ four _ klein subgroup elements with generators denoted by @xmath21 , where the invariance of the neutrino mass matrix under the klein symmetry group is sufficient to completely fix the neutrino mass matrix for majorana neutrinos ( for a review see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "we remark that @xmath0 family symmetry models in which the klein symmetry is not identified as a subgroup of the family symmetry have also been studied ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "thus with the preliminary assumptions and goals of this work put forth , we proceed by introducing the framework in which we will work .",
    "afterwards , a brief review of the representations of @xmath0 will be given .",
    "finally , the details of our method elucidated and the results presented .",
    "as previously mentioned , to address the puzzling issue of flavour , we will introduce a discrete family symmetry which will be spontaneously broken to different subgroups in the charged lepton and neutrino sectors , thereby generating the observed lepton masses and mixings .",
    "in such a _ direct model _ of flavour @xcite , the family group is broken to some abelian subgroup @xmath22 ( @xmath23 an integer ) in the charged lepton sector and to the @xmath24 klein symmetry group in the neutrino sector .",
    "the superscripts denote that @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 are the generators of their corresponding @xmath28 group in the diagonal charged lepton basis .",
    "hence , the @xmath24 transformations on @xmath29 and the @xmath22 transformations on @xmath30 leave the lagrangian invariant .",
    "this implies that @xmath31=[u , m^\\nu]=0 \\text { and } [ t , m^e]=0 , \\label{gcommutem}\\ ] ] where @xmath32 and @xmath33 represent the mass matrices multiplied by their hermitian conjugates .",
    "since @xmath25 and @xmath27 commute with @xmath32 they are diagonalised by the same matrix @xmath34 .",
    "similarly @xmath26 and @xmath33 are diagonalised by the same matrix @xmath35 .",
    "since @xmath32 and @xmath33 relate to the left - handed fields , the pmns matrix is then given by @xmath36 to obtain the matrices @xmath34 and @xmath35 , and hence the pmns matrix , we only need to identify the generators @xmath25 , @xmath27 and @xmath26 and diagonalise them . in practice , this amounts to finding the eigenvectors of @xmath25 , @xmath27 and @xmath26 which form the columns of @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "this is straightforward for @xmath26 since the eigenvalues are non - degenerate due to the fact that @xmath26 must be an element of @xmath6 of order 3 or greater .",
    "however for the @xmath25 and @xmath27 generators the situation is slightly different because they are @xmath37 matrices of _ order 2_. thus , each eigenvalue of @xmath25 or @xmath27 can only be @xmath38 . without loss of generality , we choose @xmath39 , so that each generator has two @xmath40 eigenvalues , rendering the corresponding eigenvectors non - unique .",
    "since the three matrices @xmath25 , @xmath27 and @xmath41 each have one ( unique ) @xmath42 eigenvalue this allows for the calculation of three unique eigenvectors ( one for each non - trivial klein group generator ) , each providing an @xmath43th column of the matrix @xmath44 : @xmath45 in this way all three columns of @xmath34 can be obtained .    the remarkable method outlined in this section",
    "enables the calculation of the lepton mixing matrix by only considering the family group s representation matrices @xcite .",
    "however , this certainly requires explicit representation matrices for the @xmath0 group s representations .",
    "we construct these in the next section .",
    "the @xmath0 groups are finite non - abelian subgroups of @xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) of order @xmath46 .",
    "they are isomorphic to the semidirect product  @xcite , @xmath47 the klein group @xmath48 ( in direct models ) can either originate purely from the @xmath49 or it will involve the @xmath50 generators as well , both possibilities requiring even @xmath1 .",
    "we may re - express eq .",
    "( [ semidirect ] ) in a more illuminating form by taking advantage of the structure of @xmath50 : @xmath51 notice that in eq .",
    "( [ semidirectredef ] ) , @xmath52 forms a normal , abelian subgroup of @xmath0 , generated by the elements @xmath53 and @xmath54 , and @xmath55 is nothing more than @xmath50 rewritten in terms of its generators @xmath56 and @xmath57 . from eq .",
    "( [ semidirectredef ] ) follows that the relevant presentation of @xmath0 is  @xcite : @xmath58    another advantage of the presentation in eqs .",
    "( [ semidirect])-([semidirectredef ] ) is that every group element can be written as @xmath59 with @xmath60 , @xmath61 and @xmath62 , making the computation of all group elements for a certain representation / basis computationally simple .",
    "all that needs to be known next is the explicit forms of generators .    in order to find the explicit forms for the generators , we restrict ourselves to 3-dimensional irreducible representations of @xmath0 .",
    "then , it can be shown that @xmath0 has @xmath63 3-dimensional irreducible representations denoted by @xmath64 and explicitly generated by @xcite : @xmath65 where @xmath66 ; @xmath67 ; and @xmath68 .",
    "we further restrict ourselves to working with only faithful irreducible representations of @xmath0 .",
    "thus , we exclude all representations in eq .",
    "( [ explicitd96 ] ) where @xmath69 divides @xmath1 , as they are unfaithful . of the remaining representations , @xmath64 and @xmath70",
    "are complex conjugates of each other if @xmath71 .",
    "therefore , they will provide complex conjugated mixing matrices .",
    "the remaining representations provide the same sets of mixing matrices because the generators @xmath56 and @xmath57 are the same for all @xmath69 and @xmath72 then , by considering eq .",
    "( [ elementsstandardorder ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ cdreprel ] ) it is clear that each power of the @xmath53 and @xmath54 generators will appear in every 3-dimensional irreducible representation . for these reasons",
    ", it suffices if one only considers @xmath25 , @xmath26 , and @xmath27 as representation matrices from @xmath73 .",
    "notice that @xmath74 has been chosen because in this case the determinant of the elements of order 2 is + 1 .",
    "having reduced the possible cases needed for consideration , the next step is to calculate all klein subgroups of @xmath0 .",
    "this is accomplished by first calculating all order two elements . from the generators and rules given in eq .",
    "( [ d96pres ] ) it follows that all order 2 elements in @xmath0 are given by : @xmath75 where @xmath76 .",
    "the order 2 elements found in eq .",
    "( [ order2elem ] ) serve as a starting point for calculating klein symmetry groups of @xmath0 . using eq .",
    "( [ d96pres ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ order2elem ] ) reveals the klein subgroups of @xmath0 for even @xmath1 to be : @xmath77 where @xmath78 .",

    "( [ numklein1 ] ) corresponds to the klein symmetry originating completely from @xmath49 whereas eqs .",

    "( [ explicitd96 ] ) , one of the klein generators ( taken to be @xmath25 ) is diagonal for all cases , while in the case of eq .",
    "( [ numklein1 ] ) both klein generators @xmath21 are diagonal.)-([numklein4 ] ) , in @xmath79n=4@xmath80@xcite , it was found that for the bi - trimaximal mixing example @xmath81 and @xmath82 , implying that these generators are contained in the klein subgroups defined in eq .",
    "( [ numklein3 ] ) . ]    as previously discussed , the @xmath26 generator which controls the charged lepton sector must be at least of order 3 . as shown in the appendix , only the minimal order 3 case is phenomenologically viable and so we only consider this possibility . in @xmath0 groups where",
    "3 does not divide @xmath1 , all elements of order 3 are expressible as @xcite :    @xmath83    where @xmath84 .",
    "is divisible by @xmath9 , there exist more order three elements given by @xmath85 , @xmath86 , @xmath87 , @xmath88 , @xmath89 , @xmath90 , @xmath91 , @xmath92 . in the basis of eq .",
    "( [ explicitd96 ] ) , these are diagonal matrices of phases . since @xmath25 is also diagonal in this basis , this would result in phenomenologically unacceptable predictions for leptonic mixing . ] without loss of generality we may choose the order three generator to be @xmath93 since @xmath56 and @xmath94 only differ by a permutation of rows and columns and in the basis of eq .",
    "( [ explicitd96 ] ) , it can be seen that multiplication by @xmath95 only yields phases which may be absorbed into the charged lepton fields .",
    "notice that the @xmath26 of eq .",
    "( [ tprimedef ] ) can be diagonalised by the matrix , @xmath96 where @xmath97 .",
    "the ordering of the columns and rows in the above @xmath98 determines the ordering of the eigenvalues in @xmath26 : @xmath99 for example , changing the order of the eigenvalues of @xmath26 by applying @xmath100 to @xmath26 by @xmath101 ( @xmath102 ) changes @xmath98 to @xmath103 which just permutes the rows of @xmath104 in eq .",
    "( [ vpmns ] ) .",
    "note that it is not always the case that the generators @xmath105 above generate the full @xmath0 group .",
    "it turns out that the klein subgroup in eq .",
    "( [ numklein2 ] ) , in combination with the residual @xmath106 in eq .",
    "( [ tprimedef ] ) , will only generate the full @xmath0 symmetry group if and only if @xmath107 does not divide @xmath1 . from our top down point of view",
    "this is acceptable since we are only interested in the possible predictions that can arise from @xmath0 .",
    "using the results of the previous section one can compute the columns of the lepton mixing matrix which correspond to each possible klein subgroup of a certain @xmath0 group where @xmath1 is even and we assume @xmath108 .",
    "the steps for this procedure are summarised as follows .",
    "we shall generate all klein group elements in eqs .",
    "( [ numklein1])-([numklein4 ] ) in the explicit @xmath109@xmath110 representation matrices given in eq .",

    "eq.([ttransform ] ) . here , the eigenvectors with + 1 eigenvalue correspond to the columns of possible mixing matrices as in eq .",
    "( [ columns ] ) .",
    "since the ordering of the columns and rows of the mixing matrix calculated this way is arbitrary , without loss of generality we take the smallest absolute value from each mixing matrix and assign this as @xmath111 with its corresponding column being the third column eigenvector of @xmath104 .",
    "this completed procedure is unique up to interchanging the second and third rows of @xmath104 , corresponding to two predictions for the atmospheric angle .    implementing the preceding procedure for calculating the mixing matrix resulting from the klein group in eq .",
    "( [ numklein1 ] ) with @xmath108 yields the _ old _ trimaximal mixing matrix@xcite which is given by the @xmath98 in eq .",
    "( [ ve ] ) up to permutation of its rows and columns . clearly , this is not a phenomenologically viable mixing matrix , so we discard this possibility .",
    "we do not have to consider all the klein groups in eqs .",
    "( [ numklein2])-([numklein4 ] ) since they all result in identical pmns matrices up to permutations of rows and columns .",

    "the other elements of the same klein subgroup also provide columns of @xmath104 which is then up to the order of rows and columns given by @xmath121 where @xmath122 ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) . since @xmath123",
    ", we obtain discrete predictions for the mixing angles corresponding to @xmath124 .",
    "in general we can not predict the order of the rows and columns with this method , so we pick the entry with the smallest absolute value and assign it to be @xmath125 .",
