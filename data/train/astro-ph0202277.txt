    "imaging and spectral data from the infrared through the extreme ultraviolet provide important information on the makeup of the surfaces and atmospheres of the galilean satellites io , europa , ganymede , and callisto ( carlson _ et al . _ 1999 , barth _ et al .",

    "we report the results of high - spatial resolution x - ray observations of the jovian system with the _ chandra x - ray observatory _ showing that the galilean satellites and the ipt are also x - ray emitters , and we discuss the physical processes that may contribute .",
    "the _ chandra x - ray observatory _ ( weisskopf _ et al . _ 2000 ) observed the jovian system on 25 - 26 nov 1999 with the advanced ccd imaging spectrometer ( acis ) , in support of the galileo flyby of io , and on 18 dec 2000 with the imaging array of the high resolution camera ( hrc - i ) , in support of the cassini flyby of jupiter ( gladstone _ et al .",

    "the spacecraft was repointed four times to allow for the planet s motion and was always oriented to allow the planet to move along the ccd s second node .",
    "these data were corrected for charge - transfer - inefficiency effects ( townsley _ et al .",
    "_ 2000 ) , and only the standard asca grades 0 , 2 , 3 , 4 , and 6 were retained in order to reduce the background induced by charged particles .",
    "charge - transfer - inefficiency refers to the loss of charge during ccd readout for pixels furthest away from the readout node , leading to a low estimate for the event energy .",
    "event grades depend on the distribution of charge induced by the event about the center pixel .",
    "x - ray and charge particle events produce different event grade distributions , allowing a powerful way to reduce unwanted background events .",
    "one acis pixel is 0.492 arcsec by 0.492 arcsec and the half - power diameter of the _ chandra _ system level point - spread function is about 0.8 arcsec .",
    "no repointings were necessary during the hrc - i observations , spanning 36.0 ks ( approximately one rotation of jupiter ) , because of the instrument s larger field of view and the observation s shorter length .",
    "one hrc - i pixel is 0.1318 arcsec by 0.1318 arcsec .",
    "although the acis s3 optical filter is optically thick to optical light , there is an interference peak in its transmission near @xmath19,000  ( @xmath11.4 ev ) which is likely to affect acis s3 observations of solar system objects and nearby bright late - type stars .",
    "indeed , the acis s3 data for jupiter were compromised by the throughput in low energy channels of large numbers of optical photons from the planet s bright disk . to eliminate this problem for our analysis ,",
    "all events within 34.4 arcsec ( @xmath11.4 times jupiter s radius ) of the planet s center were removed from the data . in any event ,",
    "removal of this data is required for analysis of the galilean satellites in order to avoid contamination by events associated with jupiter .",
    "the planet s optical emission also produced a bump in the acis bias frame , and all events within 34.4 arcsec of the center of this bump were removed from the data . for sufficiently bright x - ray sources , x - ray events occurring during the 41 ms necessary to read out each 3.2 s acis accumulation appear as a streak , or trailed image , in the data . for our acis jupiter observations , optical photons from the planet s disk do not contribute to a trailed image , as 41 ms is too short a time for sufficient accumulation to mimic an x - ray event .",
    "the trailed image from jupiter s true x - ray events is a small effect for e @xmath0 @xmath1440 ev , where we have reasonably accurate knowledge of jupiter s x - ray spectrum . from an extrapolation of jupiter s x - ray spectrum to lower energies",
    ", we infer that the trailed image is also not a dominant effect for our analysis of the io plasma torus at energies down to 250 ev .",
    "the trailed image is unimportant for our analysis of x - ray emission from the galilean satellites . since we wished to remove x - ray events associated with jupiter , we removed events within 34.4 arcsec of the planet s center from the hrc - i data .",

    "because this image was produced from four overlapping observations , and also because of the instrumental effects discussed above , we show an exposure map ( right panel ) for the image in figure  [ fig : iptacis ] .",

    "furthermore , we must consider the x - ray production processes that originate from the surfaces of the galilean satellites as distinct and different from the x - ray processes that lead to emission from the ipt .",
    "we first consider the surface emissions from io and europa . based on the results of model calculations ( peres _ et al .",
    "_ 2000 ) , the energetic particles that constitute the outer radiation belts of jupiter , and are found within the ipt , provide energy fluxes to the surfaces of io and europa @xmath120 and @xmath1110 , respectively , times larger than the solar x - ray flux during solar maximum conditions with active flares .",

    "even along europa s trailing hemisphere , we suspect the total energetic ion dose dominates the energetic electron dose down to about tens of microns in depth , below which point the situation is reversed ( paranicas , carlson , & johnson 2001 ) .",
    "this , together with the clustering of x - ray event energies between 500 and 700 ev , suggests that the observed emission can not be due to electron bremsstralung .",
    "since the cross - sections for interaction and the efficiency for x - ray production from energetic ion impact and from fluorescence excited by solar x - rays are comparable , we conclude that the x - ray emission from io and europa is ultimately powered by the energetic ion population in the ipt .",
    "the surfaces of the galilean satellites are exposed to bombardment by energetic ions diffusing radially inward through the region of the ipt .",
    "the incident flux is made up of energetic h , o and s ions ( paranicas _ et al .",
    "_ 2001 , cooper _ et al .",
    "although io and europa have ionospheres which deflect low energy ions , more energetic ions with large gyro - radii will reach their surfaces and produce x - rays through particle - induced x - ray emission ( johansson , campbell , & malmqvist 1995 ) .",
    "in fact the large gyro - radii for the x - ray producing ions means the effective cross - section of the galilean satellites to ipt ions is larger than their physical size ( pospieszalska & johnson 1989 ) .",
    "io s atmosphere arises from sublimation of surface so@xmath33 frost , sputtering of the surface by jovian magnetospheric particles , and volcanic activity , with the latter perhaps being the dominant contributor .",

    "as energetic ions diffuse inward through the region of the io plasma torus they are constantly subject to both electron stripping and charge exchange .",

    "similar considerations show that ion stripping by dust grains leading to x - ray emission also fails to explain the apparent line emission .",
    "a large fraction of the ipt x - ray flux may result from bremsstrahlung radiation from non - thermal electrons . above a few tens of ev ,",
    "the electrons energy distribution is well - described by a power law rather than a maxwellian ( sittler & strobel 1987 , meyer - vernet , moncuquet , & hoang 1995 ) .",

    "_ 1998 ) show the need for a large , additional source of energy .",
    "the nature of this energy source remains speculative , but it may result from wave - particle heating ( barbosa 1994 ) or inward diffusion of energetic ions and electrons from jupiter s middle and outer magnetosphere ( smith _ et al .",
    "previous remote sensing observations have provided limited data on these non - thermal electrons , since uv and longer wavelength emissions are primarily sensitive to electrons with energies below a few ev .",
