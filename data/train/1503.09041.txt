    "this presentation concerns itself with two concepts that at a first glance seem to be entirely separate , whose interplay however is actually non - trivial and rather interesting .",
    "the first concept is the idea of promoting simultaneous conjugation of charge and parity of fields ( cp ) to a symmetry of a model : this means that at some high energy one requires the lagrangian of the model not to change when every field is replaced by its cp - conjugate . in the standard model ( sm ) , this is not the case and the question is whether this violation of cp - invariance happens spontaneously . to study this question , one needs to look at models that are explicitly invariant under cp conjugation at some high energy . in the work presented here",
    ", cp is added to the symmetries of the standard model in the unbroken state .",
    "however , it will not be discussed how exactly the breaking of cp invariance happens , because it is possible to determine the possible low - energy predictions independently of the breaking mechanism .",
    "generally , these predictions would be quite general , but in the interplay with discrete flavour symmetries they become discrete ( i.e.  predictive ) and specific . in particular will it be possible to obtain predictions for the values of all mixing parameters , including the majorana phases .    in the standard model , the three generations ( or flavours , or families ) of fermions",
    "are completely independent and are merely copies of each other .",
    "flavour symmetries @xcite provide a link between the three generations by assigning them to representations of a flavour group in one way or another and demanding that the lagrangian remains unchanged when fields are transformed according to their representation under the flavour group . in this article , only left - handed leptons are considered because this is already sufficient to arrive at low energy predictions for their mixing matrix . furthermore , the three doublets of leptons are assigned to a 3-dimensional irreducible representation of the flavour group @xmath5 .",
    "thus in the unbroken state the theory is to be invariant under all of the following transformations allowed by @xmath5 @xmath6 where @xmath7 is a @xmath8 matrix that correponds to group elements @xmath9 of the flavour group @xmath5 in the representation under which the three generations of leptons transform .",
    "the invariance under the flavour group will eventually need to be broken and from breaking it differently for charged leptons and neutrinos the mixing matrix will arise . again independently of the actual mechanism , imagine therefore that @xmath5 is broken to different subgroups , namely @xmath10 for neutrinos and @xmath11 for charged leptons : the lagrangian will be invariant under the following transformations in the broken state @xmath12 where now @xmath13 and @xmath14 are @xmath15-matrices that correspond to elements of the subgroups that remain unbroken but only in their sector , @xmath11 and @xmath10 respectively , again in the same representation as in the unbroken state .    after having defined flavour symmetries above , the same needs to and will be done for cp transformations in the next section . there , it will also be discussed why one has to be careful how to define cp transformations in the presence of several generations of fermions and in particular if the theory is to be invariant under a flavour symmetry .",
    "this leads to a consistency requirement which cp and flavour transformations have to obey if not one is to accidentally violate invariance under the other .    in the section",
    "thereafter , it will be explained how predictions for the mixing matrix can be obtained from this symmetry - based approach in the different types of models with flavour symmetries . for the most constrained and predictive class of models with flavour symmetries ,",
    "only @xmath1 groups remain viable flavour symmetry groups .",
    "group are not always the minimal flavour group for a certain mixing pattern , however , all candidate groups are subgroups of a @xmath1 group and the 3-dimensional irreducible representations are inherited by @xmath1 . ] after that , the predictions for mixing parameters including majorana phases will be presented for several classes of models employing @xmath1 groups with one free unitary rotation , respectively .",
    "it will turn out that despite the free continuous parameters , the predictions are rather constrained .    in the final section ,",
    "conclusions are drawn and possible directions for future work are indicated .",
    "the kind of cp transformations that are sometimes called canonical cp transformations act on a scalar field @xmath16 in the following way : @xmath17 where @xmath18 is a phase that might depend on the kind of field and @xmath19 is the parity - conjugated spacetime coordinate . but now imagine that several copies of the field @xmath20 exist in such a way that the lagrangian allows for unitary rotations transforming these copies into each other . if all of the copies of @xmath20 would still transform under cp in the canonical way , then one could think that the cp properties of the set of copies would be basis - dependent , which is unphysical . however , this argument is wrong , because the unitary rotations mix the different states in an arbitrary way which is incompatible with canonical cp transformations acting diagonally on the copies of fields .",
    "so already the existence of several copies of a field that allow changes of basis demands that a cp transformation allows for these changes of basis @xcite .",
    "this can be achieved by promoting the phase @xmath21 to a unitary matrix , here called @xmath22 , where now @xmath23 is the multiplet of the copies of the field @xmath20 : @xmath24 indeed it can be shown , that in situations similar to the one above , canonical cp can be violated while observables of cp show no cp violation because generalised cp is conserved correctly @xcite .",
    "this means that in such a situation the correct definition of cp is the generalised one because it accommodates for changes of basis .",
    "the above applies exactly in the same way to several copies of fermions because in cp transformations of fermions only an additional matrix appears that acts on spinor indices and not among copies of the fields and thus can be neglected without loss of generality .",
    "this situation is complicated further if the theory already is invariant under some symmetry group that acts on the same multiplets that allow for generalised cp transformations . in this case",
    "flavour and cp symmetry transformations need to fulfill a consistency condition @xcite : assume that the lagrangian is invariant under flavour transformations like in eq.([flavour_unbroken ] ) of a flavour group @xmath5 .",
    "a matrix @xmath22 can appear in a generalised cp transformation acting on the multiplet of leptons if @xmath5 contains elements @xmath9 and @xmath25 such that the following equation is fulfilled @xmath26 where @xmath7 and @xmath27 are the @xmath8-matrices that correspond to @xmath9 and @xmath25 in the representation of the leptons .",
    "because the symmetry of the model is enhanced by the flavour symmetry , matrices @xmath22 can appear that are connected to the identity not only by basis transformations but also by appropriate flavour transformations .",
    "for the groups considered in this paper , the @xmath22 matrices allowed in cp transformations are proportional to the representation matrices of the flavour group @xcite : @xmath28 with an additional phase @xmath29 that will cancel in physical predictions but is shown here for completeness .",
    "when the flavour group @xmath5 is broken to its subgroups @xmath11 and @xmath10 in the different sectors , then invariance under cp can be spontaneously broken as well .",
    "this follows from the fact that @xmath22 matrices that are consistent with @xmath11 or @xmath10 in one sector respectively are not necessarily consistent in the other sector .",
    "consider a multiplet of majorana or dirac fields @xmath30 with projections on left / right - handed components @xmath31 that have the following mass terms after all symmetry breakings have occured : @xmath32 invariance under the transformations in eq.([eq2 ] ) puts the following constraints on the mass matrices @xmath33 whereas from invariance under transformations as in eq.([gcp ] ) follows @xmath34    both majorana and dirac mass matrices can be diagonalised by appropriate unitary matrices @xmath35 or @xmath36 respectively , where the lower case @xmath37 denote the columns of the matrices .",
    "the convention chosen is that the mixing matrices act actively on the multiplets of fields such that the physical mixing matrix that appears in the vertex of w - boson , neutrino , and antifermion becomes @xmath38 . for majorana fermions one can define the following matrices : @xmath39 @xmath40@xmath41    together with the identity matrix these form a @xmath3 group .",
    "for 3 massive and non - degenerate neutrinos this is the maximal residual symmetry in the following sense : the subgroup @xmath10 of @xmath5 that is conserved by the majorana mass term needs to be a subgroup of a @xmath3 group ( or equal to it ) or the constraints imposed on @xmath42 from the invariance under @xmath10 force neutrinos to be degenerate or even massless . but this would not impose any further constraints on the mixing matrix . ]    depending on how much of this residual symmetry is identified with a subgroup of @xmath5 , models can be classified and will have different properties : firstly , models where the whole residual @xmath3 is identified with @xmath10 are called direct models . in this case , all 3 @xmath43 are known in a certain basis and the mixing matrix of the neutrinos is fixed in that basis , even including the dirac phase but not including the majorana phases .",
    "the reason for this is that the @xmath44th column of the mixing matrix is an eigenvector of @xmath43 with eigenvalue @xmath45 : @xmath46 the majorana phases remain free because they are just overall phases on the columns . in this case , all mixing matrices that are allowed in a @xmath5-symmetric model can be obtained by listing all @xmath3 subgroups of @xmath5 .",
    "if on the other hand @xmath47 and @xmath10 is identified with one of the @xmath4 factors of the residual @xmath3 , a model would be called semidirect and only one of the columns of the mixing matrix is determined from symmetry as an eigenvector of the corresponding @xmath43 . again , it is possible to list all @xmath4 subgroups of @xmath5 .",
    "every @xmath4 subgroup gives rise to a class of mixing matrices that can be parametrized as @xmath48 where @xmath49 is a unitary matrix with one of the three columns fixed as an eigenvector of the @xmath43 coming from @xmath5 and the other columns arbitrary but fixed throughout the analysis .",
    "@xmath50 is a unitary matrix that rotates the two free columns and e.g.  in case of having the first column of @xmath49 determined by @xmath51 has the form @xmath52 where @xmath53 and @xmath20 are real parameters and analogous for the other columns .    if the flavour group @xmath5 is broken completely in the sector of neutrinos , @xmath54 , then no constraints on the mixing matrix follow from the invariance under @xmath5 in this immediate way from symmetry but can be obtained in a different way @xcite . in this work ,",
    "direct and semidirect models are considered .    what is peculiar about the residual symmetry is that it is an accidental symmetry that always exists as defined by eqs.([gres1]-[gres3 ] ) independently of it being incorporated into a bigger group .",
    "that one has chosen the wrong @xmath5 or that it is simply not big enough . in a way , direct models thus seem more natural , because all accidental symmetries are accounted for . ]    similar to the way described in this section so far , also the mass term of a multiplet of dirac fermions has a maximal residual symmetry which forms a @xmath55 group which corresponds to an overall phase on the mass matrix which will not impact the subsequent discussion . ]",
    "@xmath56 in particular , @xmath55 contains all groups of the kind @xmath57 as subgroups with @xmath58 natural numbers .",
    "if the form of one of the @xmath59 factors is known from @xmath5 and @xmath60 , then the mixing matrix can be completely determined as the eigenvectors of the generator of this @xmath59 group . only if @xmath61 , then similarly to the semidirect case for majorana fermions , only one column of the matrix @xmath62 is fixed .",
    "the latter case will be called charged - lepton - semidirect and in this case the mixing matrix of the charged leptons , @xmath62 , will contain a free unitary rotation as in eqs.([semidirect1 ] ) and ( [ semidirect2 ] ) .",
    "this is interesting because in contrast to the neutrino - semidirect case , in the physical mixing matrix the free rotation will act on rows instead of columns which opens the field for new mixing predictions as will be seen in the discussion of semidirect models .",
    "the discreteness of the residual symmetry for majorana neutrinos could be seen as a motivation for considering discrete flavour groups @xmath5 : generally ( and as will be shown for an example later ) continuous groups allow for an infinite number of @xmath3 subgroups and thus a discrete and specific prediction for the mixing matrix from symmetry would become impossible .",
    "on the other hand , dirac fermions would be perfectly happy with a continuous residual symmetry .",
    "many discrete groups were considered as candidates for @xmath5 in direct , semidirect and indirect models , often motivated by the conjecture that the reactor neutrino mixing angle is zero , @xmath63 . after the measurement of a non - zero @xmath64 @xcite , many of these models were ruled out and searches for other groups started , in particular using the group theory program gap @xcite . in two such searches @xcite , it was discovered that only groups that belong to the class of groups called @xmath1 @xcite could provide columns that would remain viable in direct or semidirect models .",
    "motivated by this finding all @xmath1 groups were studied for their possible predictions in direct and semidirect models @xcite .",
    "later it was proved @xcite by listing all possible mixing matrices in direct models for general finite groups , that only @xmath1 groups and certain subgroups thereof can provide mixing matrices that remain experimentally viable .",
    "as mentioned earlier , the procedure of deriving the structure of mixing matrices from a partially broken flavour group can not predict majorana phases . on the other hand , by combining a flavour symmetry with a cp symmetry consistent with it , all phases of the mixing matrices can be calculated and are predicted to particular discrete values in a direct model or can additionally only depend on up to two parameters that are strongly constrained by measurements in semidirect models .",
    "taking this as an incentive , the possible predictions for mixing matrices from @xmath1 groups combined with their consistent cp transformations were examined in @xcite .",
    "it is the results and consequences of these studies , starting from @xcite , that will be reported in the following .",
    "the groups @xmath1 are isomorphic to a semidirect product @xmath65 and are not as obscure as the name or notation suggests .",
    "an easy way to present these groups is in terms of four generators called @xmath66 , where @xmath67 and @xmath68 generate the @xmath69 subgroup and @xmath70 and @xmath71 each generate one @xmath72 subgroup . @xmath70 and @xmath71 commutate , while @xmath67 and @xmath68 have to fulfill the rules of cycling three objects and interchanging two : @xmath73 the semidirect product , `` @xmath74 '' , imposes conditions on products of @xmath75 with @xmath76 @xcite .",
    "this presentation has the advantage that every group element @xmath77 can be expressed by the generators in the following way @xmath78 with @xmath79 ; @xmath80 ; @xmath81 . in a way the groups",
    "can be thought of as two cyclic groups with @xmath82 elements with permutations of three objects acting on them .",
    "the @xmath1 groups for small @xmath82 are well - known : @xmath83 , @xmath2 , @xmath84 and @xmath85 . constraining the representation of lepton doublets to a 3-dimensional one , the @xmath1 groups still have to offer @xmath86 different representations .",
    "however , it can be shown that it is sufficient to only consider one of these representations @xcite . in the representation chosen without loss of generality for this analysis ,",
    "the generators have the following matrix form : @xmath87 with @xmath88 .",
    "to arrive at the mixing matrix predictions , first all @xmath3 subgroups are listed as candidates for @xmath10 .",
    "concerning @xmath11 , only @xmath89 groups turn out to produce experimentally viable mixing matrices , although other candidates for @xmath11 had been considered @xcite . knowing @xmath10 and @xmath11 in a direct model completely determines the mixing matrix including the dirac cp phase except for the ordering of rows and columns .",
    "it is found that one column always is trimaximal , i.e.  @xmath90 and has to serve as middle column of the mixing matrix .",
    "additionally , one requires that the entry with the smallest absolute value becomes @xmath91 .",
    "the only freedom that remains after that , is interchanging the second and third row , which corresponds to two different predictions for @xmath92 .",
    "as the majorana phases can not be predicted using this symmetry approach , the effect of additionally imposing cp transformations consistent with @xmath1 was examined .",
    "out of these , only cp transformations that are consistent with @xmath10 can be imposed onto the neutrino mass matrix @xmath42 , while analogously only cp transformations that are consistent with @xmath11 can be used to constrain the charged lepton mass matrix . after this procedure ,",
    "in the pdg convention @xcite all experimentally viable mixing matrices have the form @xmath93ie^{-i6\\pi(\\gamma+x)/n}&0\\\\0&0&[i]i\\end{pmatrix}\\ ] ] with @xmath94 and the parts in square brackets correspond to different possible choices of the majorana phases . each value of @xmath95 correponds to a different @xmath3 subgroup . in figure",
    "[ u13vsn ] the possible predictions for the value of @xmath96 in direct models with @xmath1 flavour groups is shown . there",
    ", each dot corresponds to a different choice of @xmath95 and thus a different @xmath3 subgroup .",
    "when @xmath97 divides @xmath82 , points are missing because for such @xmath1 groups those subgroups are missing which in a way renders such groups more predictive . in the limit @xmath98 ,",
    "a prediction of the value of @xmath64 becomes impossible . as @xmath99 this constitutes an example for a continuous group that does not predict discrete and specific values of a parameter in a direct model .",
    "for an arbitrary but fixed @xmath95 , it is currently not possible to determine the ordering of the second and third row from experiment .",
    "thus for each value of @xmath64 two values of @xmath92 are predicted .",
    "this can also be expressed by the sum rule @xmath100 a further important prediction is that the dirac cp phase is zero : @xmath101 whereas global fits are starting to show a slight preference for a non - zero value @xcite . to summarize ,",
    "these predictions are general for all finite groups where the lepton - doublets transform in a 3-dimensional representation and where the flavour group is broken to a @xmath3 subgroup for neutrinos .",
    "if the lepton mixing parameters are experimentally found to differ from the above predictions and corrections through renormalisation can not account for the difference , then direct flavour models with finite groups are excluded as a paradigm .     in direct models with @xmath1 flavour groups .",
    "each dot corresponds to a different choice @xmath3 subgroup and the horizontal lines indicate the central value and three sigma range from @xcite .",
    "when @xmath97 divides @xmath82 , points are missing because for such @xmath1 groups those subgroups are missing.,scaledwidth=68.0% ]    the previous discussion exhausts the topic of direct models with discrete flavour groups . in the following we focus on the possible predictions for the lepton mixing matrix that can be obtained in semidirect models with a @xmath1 flavour group .",
    "we consider breaking the flavour group in such a way that only one unitary rotation is free as in eqs.([semidirect1 ] ) and ( [ semidirect2 ] ) .",
    "this will entail neutrino - semidirect breaking , where @xmath47 while the charged lepton mixing matrix is completely fixed , i.e.  @xmath102 , as well as charged - lepton - semidirect breaking , where @xmath103 and @xmath104 .",
    "each combination of @xmath11 and @xmath10 will provide one column of the physical mixing matrix in the neutrino - semidirect case and one row of the mixing matrix in the charged - lepton - semidirect case . in table 1",
    "the fixed columns for each combination are shown for @xmath47 . a tick mark",
    "denotes that this column is experimentally viable as one of the columns of the physical mixing matrix , possibly requiring reordering of rows of the matrix . in table 2",
    "the predicted rows of the mixing matrix are shown for @xmath103 , again not barring reordering .    out of all possible combinations of subgroups shown in tables 1 and 2",
    "only three different columns are found for @xmath47 that are not experimentally excluded , while only one distinct row is found for @xmath103 . even when combining these columns and rows with a free unitary rotation of the remaining two columns or rows respectively and allowing for arbitrary permutations of the mixing matrices , only five classes of mixing matrices are produced that are not immediately excluded by experiment .",
    "the full form of all matrices can be found in @xcite .",
    "there , the mixing matrices originating from @xmath105 and @xmath106 allow for two permutations that produce viable mixing parameters . in figures",
    "[ semidirect_theta12]-[semidirect_alpha31 ] , these are shown in the left and middle panel in the top row for each observable where only values of mixing parameters are shown for combinations of group parameters for which every measured observable lies within the experimental limits .",

    "[ semidirect_theta12]-[semidirect_alpha31 ] , it can be seen that despite the additional free parameters , the predictions for mixing parameters can often only take discrete or small ranges of values .",

    "the predictions tend to lie increasingly dense until a certain continuous range is filled in the limit @xmath98 .",

    "in this presentation , lepton mixing predictions in direct and semidirect models invariant under @xmath1 groups and consistent cp transformations have been examined . in direct models ,",
    "all mixing angles and the dirac cp phase are predicted purely from symmetry principles .",
    "the inclusion of broken invariance under consistent cp transformations additionally allows to predict majorana phases .",
    "furthermore , only @xmath1 groups remain viable flavour symmetry groups in direct models . as all members of the @xmath1 group series",

    "<S> an important class of flavour groups , that are subgroups of @xmath0 and that predict experimentally viable lepton mixing parameters including majorana phases , is the @xmath1 series . </S>",

    "<S> i present results of several extensive studies of lepton mixing predictions obtained in models with a @xmath1 flavour group that preserve either the full residual @xmath3 or a @xmath4 subgroup for neutrinos and can include a generalised cp symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> predictions include mixing angles and dirac cp phase generally ; and if invariance under a generalised cp symmetry is included , also majorana phases . </S>",
    "<S> for this , the interplay of flavour group and generalised cp symmetry has to be studied carefully . </S>"
