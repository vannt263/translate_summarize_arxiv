    "indeed , models with two sterile neutrinos with @xmath18 have been extensively studied , specifically because of the possibility of observable cp violation effects which can arise through the 4 - 5 interference term which appears in the appearance oscillation probability in this scenario @xcite .",

    "at present , the most significant evidence for sterile neutrino oscillations at @xmath22 ev@xmath23 and @xmath24 comes from the lsnd experiment @xcite .",
    "lsnd was a @xmath25 decay - at - rest experiment which employed a liquid scintillator detector to identify @xmath26 events from possible @xmath27 oscillations by detecting the delayed coincidence of scintillation light emitted by a positron in the @xmath28 reaction and light emitted by the subsequent @xmath29 capture . in a search for @xmath30 oscillations at @xmath31  0.4 - 1.4 m",

    "instead , the observed @xmath2 data in that energy range were found consistent with background prediction .",
    "however , a @xmath36 excess of @xmath2 was observed at lower energy , below 475  mev , corresponding to a significantly different @xmath33 than that of the lsnd excess .",

    "other interpretations include heavy sterile neutrino decay @xcite and other non - standard physics scenarios such as altered neutrino dispersion relations @xcite , extra dimensions @xcite , cpt - violation @xcite , and non - standard neutrino interactions @xcite . at the same time , the possibility of mis - estimated background has been considered and ruled out by independent measurements at miniboone @xcite , in particular for the case of nc single - photon events , which make up the most dominant background to the miniboone @xmath2 appearance search at low energy . however , the possibility of a new background , such as that contributed by anomaly - mediated single - photon production @xcite , remains a viable interpretation for the miniboone low energy excess .",

    ", global fit results have revealed increasing tension between neutrino and antineutrino data sets when tested under the sterile neutrino oscillation hypothesis .",
    "the apparent differences are such that they can not be accommodated by any cp violation allowed within the model .",

    "an example of such model has been presented in this paper .",

    ", it suggests observable effects in higher - energy neutrino and antineutrino experiments .",
    "therefore , the data provided by minos , icecube and t2k will be crucial in addressing the viability of the model .",
