    "in quantum field theory , fermi liquids are completely described in terms of single - electron green s functions and renormalized charge / current vertex functions @xcite .",
    "the green s functions satisfy the corresponding dyson equations , and the vertex functions the bethe - salpeter equations . in electronic systems with parabolic dispersions and weak residual interactions",
    "the problem of solving these two self - consistent equations reduces to analyzing the semiclassical landau - silin transport equations for nonequilibrium distribution functions @xcite .",
    "the details about electron - electron interactions are hidden in renormalized electron dispersions and in transport relaxation rates .",
    "electrodynamic properties of such systems are well known and are usually expressed in terms of the nominal concentration of conduction electrons , or the electron density of states at the fermi level , and in terms of the well - known landau scattering functions .",
    "the effective mass of conduction electrons and the effective density of states are introduced to describe the effects of residual electron - electron interactions in the simplest way .",
    "almost all observables look the same as in the theory of noninteracting fermions , with the exception that the electron mass and the electron density of states are replaced by their effective values .",
    "in contrast , when the residual interactions among conduction electrons are strong , e.g. in underdoped cuprates @xcite , there is no way to simplify the original self - consistent equations . in addition ,",
    "when these equations are treated beyond the leading ( hartree - fock ) approximation , it is necessary to replace bare electron - electron interactions by irreducible four - point interactions .",
    "consequently , the resulting expressions for different transport coefficients , for the real and imaginary parts of the dielectric function , and for many other response functions can not be mapped onto standard fermi liquid expressions .",
    "the concentration of conduction electrons and the bare density of states are no longer quantities which enter in observables as multiplicative parameters .",
    "they are replaced by different forms of the effective number of charge carriers and different effective densities of states @xcite .",
    "more importantly , in such a general formulation of the response functions , there is no need for using concepts such as the transport or optical electron mass .",
    "the residual electron - electron interactions in graphene are presumably weak , but the electron dispersions are very different from the parabolic dispersion .",
    "therefore , to understand electrodynamic properties of pristine and doped graphene , as well as to answer open questions regarding the behaviour of conduction @xmath0 electrons in the presence of external electromagnetic fields , we are forced once again to use the original dyson and bethe - salpeter equations instead of the semiclassical landau - silin equations , and to treat the dispersions of @xmath0 electrons beyond the dirac cone approximation . however",

    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we consider the multiband quantum transport equations in the hartree - fock approximation @xcite .",
    "these equations are expected to be appropriate for studying relaxation processes in graphene at low enough temperatures where the conduction electrons are scattered primarily by static disorder and by phonons . in these equations",
    "there are two types of damping energies : the single - electron damping energy [ i.e. , the half width of the quasi - particle peak in angle - resolve photoemission spectra ( arpes ) @xcite ] and the electron - hole damping energies ( i.e. , the intraband and interband relaxation rates in the dc and optical conductivity @xcite ) .",
    "the charge continuity equation is responsible for the fact that @xmath3 scattering processes drop out of the intraband electron - hole damping energies . on the contrary ,",
    "the single - electron damping energies depend quite drastically on the intensity of these scattering processes .",
    "we use the multiband ward identity relations @xcite to determine the structure of the effective number of charge carriers in the two - band version of the transverse conductivity sum rule , and show that this effective number does not depend on the relaxation rates . in sec .",
    "iii , low - order perturbation theory is used to emphasize different roles played by vertex corrections in the intraband and interband quantum transport equations . in sec .",
    "iv , the observed dc conductivity of lightly doped graphene samples @xcite is analyzed by using the current - dipole conductivity formula , with particular care devoted to two types of damping energies and to two types of contributions to the effective number of charge carriers .",
    "we use the relaxation - time approximation , for simplicity , with reasonable values of the relaxation rates .",
