    "the way to achieve the solution is by the algorithm of quantum annealing : slow variation of external experimental parameters , so that , as the adiabatic theorem says , the system develops with time adiabatically in its energetically ground state . at the end of the quantum annealing time the d - wave presents the solution of the optimization problem . in this sense",

    "the two current states are no more degenerate .",
    "the illumination with short ( ns ) near resonant photon pulse in the radiofrequency range is followed by oscillations between the two current states , called ramsey fringes , as the qubit is left to develop free with time .",
    "the experimental observation is : the probability for switching between the two current states decays with time and reaches a finite value for the excitation probability larger than zero .",
    "this observation is interpreted as  loss of coherence  and the suggested causes for the damping of the amplitude of the oscillations range from experimental imperfections and poor control of the electromagnetic environment of the flux qubit , to external and internal noises of different nature and the involvement of various dissipative channels ( charge noise , photon noise , quasiparticle excitations above the superconducting gap , radiative and dielectric loss , etc . ) .",

    "stochastic approaches , providing quantum master equation for the rate of excitation of a two - level system in an environment of quantum harmonic oscillators , yield an exponential decay of the excitation probability . using the parameters from the experiments , zero limiting value of the excitation probability and no oscillatory behaviour with time is the result @xcite .",

    "( this is in contrast to the ramsey interference experiment where radiofrequency laser pulses of nanosecond duration are used , followed by a time interval of free development of the flux qubit . )",
    "the exponential decay of the amplitude of the rabi oscillations , achieving a constant non - zero value at time of the order of 80 ns , is attributed to decoherence due to dynamic low - frequency noise , which is treated within a quantum stochastics approach and a quantum master equation .",
    "this approach is most often used to simulate non - specified noise due to an environment . however , a much higher temperature of the environment , compared with the experimental temperature of the order of mk , has been used to reproduce the decay of the rabi oscillations of a single flux qubit @xcite . + a non - oscillatory exponential decay of the occupation of the excitated state to zero value has indeed been observed with a single flux qubit ( ref .",

    "this experimental procedure , using long time illumination , allows to establish the equilibrium occupation of the excitated state and to follow its time development .",
    "as it is expected , if boltzmann statistics dominates the distribution over the states of the flux qubit , the probability for occupation of the excited state decays exponentially without oscillations , approaching the value zero at delay time of the order of 80 ns .",
    "this trend can be fitted to bloch - redfield like master equation for a two - level system in thermal equilibrium with the electromagnetic modes .",
    "+ decoherence theory would claim that the oscillations in the ramsey interference experiment with the single flux qubit are the result of collapse in one or the other current states .",
    "but then , if collapse in a single flux qubit occurs on the time scale of 20 ns , how can the collapses in an interacting ensemble of five hundred flux qubits be avoided to enable the coherent operation of the d - wave quantum computer ?",
    "+ we must conclude that quantum stochastic approaches and decoherence theory can not provide the explanation of the long coherence time of the d - wave machine , being unable to describe the time development of a single flux qubit .",
    "what the stochastic approach provides for a single flux qubit is simply a statistical boltzmann behaviour at temperature significantly higher than that used in the experiments .",
    "+ the problem we focus on is the discrepancy of 8 orders of magnitude in the coherence time of a single flux qubit and the coherent operation of the d - wave machine consisting of many flux qubits . we solve the time dependent schrdinger equation with a hamiltonian including the entanglement of the current states to gravonons , existing in high dimensional spacetime .",

    "the clue to this result is the entanglement of the persistent currents in the flux qubits with the gravonons , the massive quanta of the gravitational field , which live in high spacial dimensions .",
    "the necessary condition for this result is weak coupling of the local quantum fields to an environmental continuum of high density of states , which is satisfied only by the gravonons in high spacial dimensions .",
    "+ the major results of the present study of the d - wave quantum computer can be summarized :    * the  coherence  time observed experimentally of a single flux qubit is explained , obtaining acceptable agreement with experiment .",
    "the explanation is based on entanglement with the gravonon continuum . *",
    "the entanglement to gravonons also explains the coherence time of the d - wave quantum computer . * the entanglement to gravonons also explains why phonons do not perturb the quantum annealing process of the d - wave machine and it lets the temperature dependence of the success probability of the d - wave quantum computer appear comprehensible .",
    "these results as well as the experimental observations on the d - wave quantum computer can not be reproduced and explained either by stochastic quantum approaches or within conventional decoherence theory in four dimensions .",
    "this has , however , not been explicitely demonstrated in the paper so far .",
    "+ emerging quantum mechanics reproduces experimental observations of very different nature , where orders of magnitude discrepancies have been found by computations based on conventional quantum mechanics in three dimensional space .",
    "they include quantum diffusion of adsorbates on solid surfaces @xcite , and double slit diffraction experiments with massive molecules @xcite . in these cases localization of quantum particles in three dimensional space",
    "is the result of the entanglement with the gravonons which live in high spacetime dimensions .",

    "<S> previous judgements of whether the d - wave device should be thought of as a quantum computer have been based on correlations of the input - output behaviour of the d - wave machine with a quantum model , called simulated quantum annealing , or classical models , called simulated annealing and classical spin dynamics @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> explanations for a factor of @xmath0 discrepancy between the single flux qubit decoherence time and the long - time coherent quantum behaviour of many integrated flux qubits of the d - wave device have not been offered so far . in our contribution </S>",
    "<S> we investigate a model of four qubits with one qubit coupled to a phonon and ( optionally ) to environmental particles of high density of states , called gravonons . </S>",
    "<S> the calculations indicate that when no gravonons are present , the current in the qubit is flipped at some time and adiabatic evolution is discontinued . </S>",
    "<S> the time dependent wave functional becomes a non - correctable superposition of many excited states . </S>",
    "<S> the results demonstrate the possibility of effectively suppressing the current flip and allowing for continued adiabatic evolution when the entanglement to gravonons is included . </S>",
    "<S> this adiabatic evolution is , however , a coherent evolution in high dimensional spacetime and can not be understood as a solution of schrdinger s time dependent equation in four dimensional spacetime . </S>",
    "<S> compared to schrdinger s time development , the evolution is considerably slowed down , though still adiabatic . </S>",
    "<S> the properties of our model reflect correctly the experimentally found behaviour of the d - wave machine and explain the factor of @xmath0 discrepancy between decoherence time and quantum computation time . </S>",
    "<S> the observation and our explanation are in anology to the @xmath0 discrepancy factor found , when comparing experimental results on adsorbate quantum diffusion rate with predictions of schrdinger s time dependent equation , which can also be resolved in a model with the coupling to gravonons included .     </S>",
