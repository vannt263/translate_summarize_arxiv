    "in pressurized water reactors of nuclear plants , the pressure vessel constitutes one element of the second safety barrier between the radioactive fuel rods and the external environment .",
    "it is made of 16mnd5 ( a508 ) steel which is forged and welded . in case of operating accidents such as loca ( _ loss of coolant accident _ )",
    ", the pressure vessel is subjected to a pressurized thermal shock due to fast injection of cold water into the primary circuit .",
    "if some defects ( _ e.g _ cracks ) were present in the vessel wall this may lead to crack initiation and propagation and the brittle fracture of the vessel .",
    "the detailed study of the embrittlement of 16mnd5 steel under irradiation is thus a great concern for electrical companies such as edf .",
    "the brittle fracture behavior of the 16mnd5 steel has been thoroughly studied in the last decade using the local approach of fracture theory @xcite and the so - called beremin model @xcite , which assumes that cleavage is controlled by the propagation of the weakest link between a population of pre - existing micro - defects in the material .",
    "this approach has been recently coupled with polycrystalline aggregates simulations @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the main idea is to model a material representative volume element ( rve ) as a polycrystalline synthetic aggregate and compute the stress field under given load conditions . as a post - processing a statistical distribution of defects ( carbides )",
    "is sampled over the volume . in each gauss point of the finite element mesh the cleavage criterion is attained somewhere along the load path if a ) the equivalent plastic strain has attained some threshold ( cleavage initiation ) and b ) a griffith - like criterion applied to the size of the carbide in this gauss point is reached ( cleavage propagation ) . within the weakest link theory the failure of a single critical carbide induces the failure of the rve .    from a single rve simulation ( i.e. a single stress field ) various distributions of carbides",
    "are drawn , each realization leading to a maximal principal stress associated to failure .",
    "then the distribution of these quantities is fitted using a weibull law @xcite . in such an approach",
    ", the current practice of computational micromechanics assumes that the rve is large enough to represent the behavior of the material so that a single polycrystalline analysis is carried out ( the large cpu required by polycrystalline simulations also favours the use of a single simulation ) .",
    "however it is believed that numerous parameters such as grain geometry and orientation may influence the stress field and thus the final result .",
    "the connection between micromechanics and stochastic methods has been given much attention in the past few years , as shown in @xcite .",
    "many papers are devoted to developing probabilistic models for reproducing a random microstructure , @xcite .",
    "the specific representation of polycrystalline microstructures has been addressed in @xcite among others .",
    "the propagation of the uncertainty on the microstructure through a micromechanical model in order to study the variability of the resulting strain and stresses has not been addressed much though ( see @xcite ) .    in this paper",
    "it is proposed to identify the properties of a stress random field resulting from the progressive loading of a polycrystalline aggregate .",
    "more precisely , assuming that the stress random field is gaussian , a procedure called _ periodogram method _ is devised , which allows one to identify the correlation structure of the resulting stress field .    the paper is organized as follows : in section  2 basics of gaussian random fields are recalled and the periodogram method is presented @xcite . the polycrystalline aggregate computational model is detailed in section  3 .",
    "the methodology for identifying the correlation structure of the resulting stress field is presented in section  4 .",
    "two application cases are then investigated , namely an aggregate with fixed grain boundaries and random crystallographic orientations ( section  5 ) and an aggregate with both random geometry and orientations ( section  6 ) .",
    "the variance of the resulting stress field as well as the spatial covariance function and its correlation lengths is investigated in details .",
    "the properties of the identified random fields will be used in a forthcoming study in the context of the local approach to fracture , as explained above .",
    "in this section an identification method called _ periodogram _ is presented , which uses an estimator of the _ power spectral density _ ( psd ) in order to identify the correlation structure of a _",
    "gaussian homogeneous random field_. based on original developments by @xcite and @xcite for unidimensional fields , it has been extended to two - dimensional cases by @xcite .",
    "as it relies upon the use of the fast fourier transform ( fft ) its computational efficiency is remarkable .",
    "a gaussian random field @xmath0 is completely defined by its mean value @xmath1 , its standard deviation @xmath2 and its auto - covariance function @xmath3 .",
    "it is said _ homogeneous _ if the mean value @xmath1 and the standard deviation @xmath4 are constant in the domain of definition of @xmath5 and the auto - covariance function @xmath3 only depends on the shift @xmath6 .",

    "@xmath7th statistical moment _ @xmath8 and the spatial average @xmath9 : @xmath10    the field is said _ ergodic _ if its ensemble statistics is equal to the spatial average , @xmath11 @xcite .",

    "gaussian and exponential models are plotted in figure  [ fig - ii.1 ] for the sake of illustration . note that we call _ correlation length _ the parameters that appear in the definition of the covariance functions .",

    "one can observe the mean strain - stress relationship in each grain as shown in figure [ fig - iii.7 ] . because of the different crystallographic orientations in each grain , the mean elastoplastic behaviour is different from grain to grain .",

    "it is observed that the scattering around the mean curve increases with the macroscopic strain .",
    "indeed , for the final loading step corresponding to @xmath146 the mean strain in the grain is about 4.54% , while the local strain varies form 2.4 to 9% .",

    "this operation is carried out using internal routines of code_aster .",
    "note that a slice of width @xmath149 ( @xmath150 of total size ) is discarded along the edges of the aggregate in order to avoid the effect of boundary conditions on the computed stress field , as suggested in @xcite .",
    "a typical maximal principal stress field is shown in figure  [ fig - iv.10 ] .",
    "as it was described in section  2 the periodogram method assumes that the random field under consideration is _",
    "homogeneous_. from the available realizations @xmath151 one first checks empirically this assumption using the following approach :    * the _ ensemble mean and variance _ of the field is computed point - by - point throughout the grid for an increasing number of realizations @xmath152 : @xmath153 if the field is homogeneous these quantities should tend to constant values that are independent from the position @xmath154 when @xmath90 tends to infinity . * in order to measure the magnitude of the spatial fluctuation of the latter , the _ spatial average _ and _ spatial variance _ of a realization of a field @xmath155 sampled onto a @xmath41 grid is defined by : @xmath156 whereas the associated `` spatial '' coefficient of variation is defined by : @xmath157 * the spatial coefficient of variation of the ensemble mean and variance ( eqs.([eq - iv.25])-([eq - iv.26 ] ) ) are computed and plotted as a function of @xmath90 . if the underlying random field is homogeneous it is expected that the curves of @xmath158 and @xmath159 converge to zero .      from a visual inspection of the obtained empirical periodograms",
    "it appears that a gaussian or an exponential model of periodogram such as those presented in table  [ tab:01 ] may be consistent with the data .",
    "however it appeared in the various analyses that the peak of the periodogram is not always in zero .",
    "an _ initial frequency _ is thus introduced which shifts the theoretical periodogram . finally , due to lack of fitting of the single - type periodogram ( gaussian and exponential ) ,",
    "a combination thereof is also fitted .",
    "the most general model finally reads : @xmath160 l_{y1 } \\mbox{exp }      \\left[\\pi^2 l_{y1}^2 ( f_y - f^{(1)}_{y0})^2 \\right ] \\\\      & + \\sigma_2 ^ 2 \\frac{2l_{x2}}{1 + 4\\pi^2 l_{x2}^2 ( f_x -        f^{(2)}_{x0})^2 } \\frac{2l_{y2}}{1 + 4\\pi^2 l_{y2}^2 ( f_y -        f^{(2)}_{y0})^2 }    \\end{split}\\ ] ] where @xmath161 are correlation lengths in each direction @xmath162 and @xmath129 ( aniso - tropic field ) for each component ( 1 ) ( gaussian part ) and ( 2 ) ( exponential part ) .",

    "it is interesting to interpret the fitted parameters reported in table  [ tab:05 ] .",
    "first it is observed that the amplitude of each component of the mixed periodogram is similar since @xmath206 .",
    "the variance of the field is equal to @xmath207 6,309  mpa@xmath208 .",
    "the associated standard deviation is 79.4  mpa .",
    "as the mean principal stress is 720  mpa at 3.5% macroscopic strain , the coefficient of variation of the field is about 11% .    in order to interpret the correlation length parameters",
    "let us define the mean size of a grain @xmath209 such a two - dimensional aggregate .",
    "as the volume of edge length equal to 1,000 corresponds to 100  grains , the equivalent diameter of a single grain reads : @xmath210 thus the correlation lengths obtained from the fitting vary from 0.55 to 1.3@xmath211 .",
    "this shows that the characteristic dimension of the underlying microstructure ( @xmath211 ) is of the same order of magnitude as these parameters . in other words",
    "the scale of local fluctuation of the stress field is related to the grain size , as heuristically expected .",
    "moreover , it appears that the lengths in the @xmath162 and @xmath129 directions are almost identical .",
    "the stress field does not show any significant anisotropy in this case .      in this section the stability of the fitted parameters as a function of the number of available realizations @xmath90 used in the average periodogram method",
    "is considered . in practice",

    "the evolution of the initial frequencies @xmath215 is shown in figure  [ fig - iv.20 ] .",
    "from these figures it appears that the fitted parameters tend to a converged value when at least 20  realizations of the stress field are used for their estimation .      in this section the evolution of the parameters of the fitted periodograms as a function of the macroscopic strain",
    "is investigated . for this purpose",
    "the methodology presented in section  [ sec:5 - 2 ] is applied using the realizations of the maximal principal stress fields corresponding to various levels of the loading curve , various values of the equivalent macroscopic strain @xmath216 .",
    "the evolution of the standard deviations @xmath213 is shown in figure  [ fig - iv.18a ] .",
    "the two components of the periodogram ( gaussian and exponential ) contribute for approximately the same proportion to the total variance of the field since the curves are almost superimposed .",
    "note that these standard deviations increase with the applied load in the same way as the mean load curve ( figure  [ fig - iii.6 ] ) .",
    "the evolution of the correlation lengths @xmath214 is shown in figure  [ fig - iv.19a ] .",
    "the evolution of the initial frequencies @xmath215 is shown in figure  [ fig - iv.20a ] .",
    "it is observed that once plasticity is settled ( once the macroscopic strain @xmath217 is greater than @xmath218 ) the parameters describing the fluctuations of the maximal principal stress field are almost constant .",
    "this conclusion is valid for both the correlation lengths and the initial frequencies .",
    "note that the convergence is faster for the parameters related to the @xmath162 direction , the direction that is transverse to the one - dimensional loading .",
    "finally it is also observed that @xmath219 is almost equal to zero whatever the load level , thus the zero value in table  [ tab:05 ] .",
    "in this section both the randomness in the grain geometry and in the crystallographic orientations are taken into account .",
    "a total number of 35  finite element models are run . in each case",
    ", the grain geometry is obtained from a uniform sampling of points from which a vorono tessellation is built .      as in section  [ section-5 ] the homogeneity of the maximal principal stress field",
    "is checked using the methodology proposed in section  [ section-4.2 ] .",
    "figure  [ fig - iv.22 ] shows the evolution of @xmath158 and @xmath159 .",
    "these quantities regularly decrease and it is seen that they would tend to zero if a larger number of realizations was available .",
    "this leads to accepting the assumption that the random field is homogeneous .",
    "the average empirical periodogram obtained from @xmath169 realizations of the maximal principal stress field @xmath147 at 3.5% of macroscopic strain is plotted in figure  [ fig - iv.23]-a .",
    "three types of theoretical periodograms have been fitted as in the previous section , which lead to the conclusion that the mixed model that combines a gaussian and an exponential component is best suited .",

    "as far as the contribution of each component of the periodogram is concerned , the symmetry reported in case # 1 is not existing anymore since the standard deviation of the exponential contribution ( @xmath221 ) is much greater than that of the gaussian part ( @xmath222 ) .",
    "the total variance of the field is 7940  mpa@xmath208 , corresponding to a standard deviation of 89.1  mpa and a coefficient of variation of 12% .",
    "thus there is a little more scattering in the random stress field obtained in case  # 2 when considering both the random grain geometry and orientations .",
    "cccccccccccc & @xmath170 & & + & ( eq.([eq - iv.33 ] ) ) & @xmath171 & @xmath172 & @xmath173 & @xmath174 & @xmath175 & @xmath176 & @xmath177 & @xmath178 & @xmath179 & @xmath180 + case # 1 & @xmath193 & @xmath194 & @xmath195 & @xmath196 & @xmath197 & @xmath186 & @xmath198 & @xmath199 & @xmath200 & @xmath201 & @xmath202 + case # 2 & @xmath223 & @xmath224 & @xmath225 & @xmath226 & @xmath227 & @xmath186 & @xmath228 & @xmath229 & @xmath230 & @xmath231 & @xmath186 +    the correlation lengths associated with the exponential part do not differ much in case  # 2 compared to case  # 1 ( corresponding here to 1.5 to 2.4  @xmath211 ) .",
    "in contrast the correlation lengths related to the gaussian part are increased , which tends to produce less rapidly varying realizations .",
    "this may be explained by the fact that the grain boundaries are `` averaged '' in case  # 2 whereas they were fixed in case  # 1 .",
    "the stress concentrations that are usually observed at the grain boundaries are thus smoothed in case  # 2 compared to case  # 1 .      in this section one",

    "the evolution of the standard deviations @xmath213 and the initial frequencies @xmath232 is shown in figure  [ fig - iv.26 ] ( note that @xmath233 in the present case ) . the evolution of the correlation lengths @xmath214 is shown in figure  [ fig - iv.27 ] .    from these figures it clearly appears that the fitted parameters are almost constant when the number of realizations of the stress field used in their estimation increases .",
    "the minimal number of @xmath234 could be used here without significant errors although it is recommended to keep a value of @xmath235 as in case # 1 for robustness .      finally the evolution of the parameters of the fitted periodograms as a function of the macroscopic strain @xmath217 is investigated . for this purpose",
    "the identification method is applied using the realizations of the maximal principal stress fields corresponding to various levels of the loading curve , various values of the equivalent macroscopic strain @xmath216 .",
    "the evolution of the two standard deviations look similar to the results obtained in case  # 1 ( figure  [ fig - iv.28 ] ) .",
    "it is observed that the ratio @xmath236 is almost constant all along the loading path up to 3.5% strain .",
    "as far as the initial frequencies are concerned , there is a complete independance with the load level as soon as @xmath217 is greater than @xmath218 , when plasticity has settled in the aggregate .",
    "the same conclusion can be drawn for the various correlation lengths .",
    "the distribution of stresses in a material at a microscopic scale ( where heterogeneities such as grain structures are taken into account ) has been given much attention in the context of computational homogenization methods .",
    "however the current methods usually stick to a deterministic formulation . starting from the premise that any representative volume element ( such as a polycrystalline aggregate ) is a single specific realization of a random quantity",
    ", the present paper aims at using methods of computational stochastic mechanics for representing the ( random ) stress field .    after recalling the basic mathematics of gaussian random fields ,",
    "the paper presents a _ periodogram method _ for estimating the parameters describing the spatial fluctuation of a random field from a collection of realizations of this field .",
    "this method is adapted in two dimensions from well - known techniques originating from signal processing .",
    "the material under consideration , namely the 16mnd5 steel used in nuclear pressure vessels is then presented together with a local modelling by polycrystalline finite element calculations . from a collection of 35 realizations of the ( maximal principal ) stress field , the spatial correlation structure of the latter is identified . by fitting various theoretical periodograms , a mixed model combining a gaussian and an exponential - type contribution",
    "is retained .",
    "these two contributions may be empirically interpreted as follows : the gaussian part corresponds to the fluctuation from grain to grain ; the ( less smooth ) exponential component corresponds to the sharp grain boundaries stress concentrations .",
    "two cases are considered , namely a `` fixed - geometry '' case in which only the crystallographic orientations changes within the 35 realizations ( fixed grain boundaries ) , and a `` variable geometry '' in which the grain geometry is randomly sampled for each realization . in both cases ,",
    "a good convergence of the procedure is observed when the number of realizations increases .",
    "a set of 20  realizations is recommended , although good results are already obtained for @xmath2378  realizations in case # 2 .",
    "moreover it is shown that the correlation lengths are of the same order of magnitude as the grain size .",
    "the initial frequencies that are required for a best fitting of the periodogram and that translate into some kind of spatial periodicity in the covariogram could be explained by spurious edge effects due to the limited size of the aggregate .",
    "this should be investigated more in details in further analysis .",
    "another important result is drawn from the comparison of the fitted parameters at various load levels . once plasticity is settled within the aggregate , the parameters describing the spatial fluctuations of the field are almost constant .",
    "moreover the variance of the field ( sum of the variance of each component of the periodogram ) increases proportionally to the mean strain / stress curve , meaning that the coefficient of variation of the stress field is almost constant ( around 11% for the fixed geometry and 12% for the variable geometry ) .",
    "the results presented in this paper should be confirmed by additional investigations under different types of loading ( biaxial loading ) .",
    "the tools that are presented here may be applicable to three - dimensional aggregates and stress fields at a much larger computational cost though .",
    "this work is currently in progress .",
    "the identified stress fields may eventually be re - simulated : new realizations of the stress fields are straightforwardly obtained at a low computational cost by random field simulation techniques such as the spectral approach or the circulant embedding method @xcite .",
    "this allow us to apply local approach to fracture analysis ( such as that presented in @xcite ) for the assessment of the brittle fracture of metallic materials , as shown in @xcite .",
