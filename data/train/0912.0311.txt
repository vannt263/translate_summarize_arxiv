    "coronagraphy , a means of suppressing bright starlight so as to search for faint companions or circumstellar material , has garnered much interest in the past decade .",
    "a number of new optimized coronagraph concepts has been considered for dedicated exoplanet - finding projects at both ground- and space - based observatories ( see the rather exhaustive survey of @xcite ) .",
    "four groups of coronagraphs can be identified . in the pupil plane",
    "coronagraph family , there are : ( a ) amplitude apodization ( via either intensity modification , or pupil shaping ) , and the phase induced amplitude apodization ( piaa ) approach , in which the mirrors are warped to reshape the distribution of light in the pupil to yield an apodized shape , ( b ) pupil plane phase apodization , and in the focal plane coronagraph family , there are ( c ) amplitude masks ( classical lyot coronagraphs and band - limited profiles ) , and ( d ) phase mask coronagraphs of various types . unlike `` lyot family '' amplitude coronagraphs , focal - plane phase masks such as the four - quadrant phase - mask ( fqpm , see @xcite , and @xcite for a recent review on the fqpm ) and optical vortex coronagraphs @xcite have the great advantage of providing a very small inner working angle ( iwa ) , which is one way of making use of smaller telescope apertures .    the optical vortex coronagraph family is a promising and nearly ideal phase mask solution , proposed almost concurrently by @xcite and @xcite , and confirmed later in @xcite .",
    "an optical vortex is a phase singularity in an optical field , a point of zero intensity , resulting from a phase screw dislocation of the form @xmath4 , with @xmath5 being the so - called topological charge radians that the phase of the scalar wave accumulates along a closed path surrounding the phase singularity @xmath6 where the integration path encircles the central singularity . ] , and @xmath7 the azimuthal coordinate .",
    "this anomaly forces the intensity to vanish by a total destructive interference , creating a dark core .",
    "this dark core propagates and is conserved along the optical axis @xcite . whether a dark core is created in the pupil or focal plane of a telescope",
    "will determine the way it further evolves . in @xcite , we demonstrated that the creation of a vortex of any even topological charge @xmath5 at the focal plane can lead to a perfect coronagraph in the ideal case ( no further phase aberrations in the system ) .",
    "this result has been confirmed later on by @xcite . even if `` optical vortex '' rigorously refers to a property of an optical beam , for the sake of simplicity we will use this denomination in the following to refer either to the optical property or the optical element that induces it .",
    "there are two kinds of optical vortices ( and thus of elements that induce them ) :    * scalar optical vortex , based on the longitudinal phase delay ( which applies to both polarizations identically ) , and implemented by a structural helical phase ramp @xcite ; * vectorial optical vortex , based on the `` geometrical '' or pancharatnam phase ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see appendix ) , obtained by manipulating the transverse polarization state of the light with space - variant birefringent elements .",
    "both approaches are still technically immature , but a scalar vortex optical element has already seen use on a small telescope @xcite . here",
    "we report laboratory results with the first prototype vectorial vortex coronagraph .",
    "after several years of effort toward annular groove vortex masks @xcite , a new promising technique has been identified to manufacture the vortex phase profile .",
    "this technology is based on birefringent liquid crystal polymers ( lcp ) which are oriented and hardened in a circular pattern .",
    "we show in this paper that the liquid crystal polymer optical vectorial vortex coronagraph ( lcp ovvc ) is a viable approach to generating the phase helix , with a promising technological path to very high performance coronagraphic masks , both in the near - infrared , where they could be used on current adaptive optics corrected ground - based telescopes to augment high contrast imaging capabilities , and in the optical , where these developments can be applied to more ambitious space - based coronagraph missions .",
    "we note that because of their small inner working angle , and lack of `` features '' anywhere on the mask ( except at the very central singularity ) , their discovery space is close to maximal in terms of search area for faint companions ( no dead zones ) .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : the second section is devoted to a condensed theoretical description of the optical vectorial vortex , as opposed to the optical `` scalar '' vortex .",
    "the third section describes the technology chosen to synthesize them as well as the manufacturing process of the first prototype . in the fourth section",
    ", the lab setup and measurement methodology will be presented . in section 5 , we will present the coronagraphic measurements results , that will subsequently be put in perspective in section 6 , before concluding in section 7 .",
    "making the helical phase profile @xmath4 of optical vortices is difficult because of the accuracy required in the phase profile control . to build a scalar vortex , i.e. by acting on the longitudinal phase delay",
    ", one has to directly etch the helix in a piece of glass .",
    "the total etched thickness @xmath8 must be precise to a tiny fraction @xmath9 of @xmath10 , @xmath11 being the wavelength of the impinging light and @xmath12 the refractive index of the glass , respectively . in the most demanding applications such as earth - like planet detection",
    ", one would have to structurally control the phase ramp profile at the nanometer level , which is very challenging , even for state - of - the - art etching techniques inherited from the micro - electronics industry ( e - beam lithography and reactive ion etching ) .",
    "moreover , the induced phase profile using this approach , @xmath13 , is very chromatic , with a hyperbolic dependence to the wavelength of light and subject to the glass refractive index dispersion .     and @xmath14 are the unit vectors of the chosen cartesian basis .",
    "@xmath15 and @xmath16 , are the local @xmath17 and @xmath18 optical axis unit vectors of the birefringent medium .",
    "[ spvarsch ] ]    a vectorial vortex optical element possesses no structural phase ramp per se .",
    "it is simply a halfwave plate ( hwp ) in which the optical axes rotate about the center ( see fig .",
    "[ ovvc2pol ] ) . in the following",
    "we will show that the rotationally symmetric spatial variation of the optical axes manipulates the transverse polarization state in such a way that a _ virtual _ phase ramp is embedded to the so- called `` geometrical '' phase ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see appendix ) .",
    "when the local birefringence characteristics of an optical component vary from point to point , it is said to be space variant .",
    "space - variant birefringent optical elements ( svboe ) are extensively used as polarization control devices @xcite .",
    "the range of applications is manifold : polarimetry , laser - beam shaping , laser machining , tight focusing , particle acceleration , atom trapping , contrast enhancement microscopy , image encryption , etc .",

    "it is very dependent on the technological approach chosen to render the phase helix ( see sect . [ manuf ] ) . for the vectorial vortex ,",
    "chromatic effects appear in the wavelength dependence of the local polarization characteristics of the birefringent medium , i.e. the retardance and the ordinary and extraordinary transmittances .",
    "the consequence is that the weighing coefficient @xmath61 and @xmath63 are wavelength dependent : @xmath75 and @xmath76 . to improve the achromaticity of the vectorial vortex ,",
    "the first obvious solution is to make the polarization characteristics immune to wavelength changes .",

    "both the polarizer and the substrate are continuously rotated during the exposure process in order to create a continuous variation in photo - alignment orientation as a function of azimuthal location on the substrate .",

    "indeed , most of the stellar peak energy falls within the beam fwhm , @xmath87 . the total rejection , r , should be approximately    @xmath101^{-1}\\ ] ]    where @xmath102 is the encircled energy function at the angular separation @xmath103 , @xmath104 being the defect size ( central region of disorientation ) .",

    "( [ nullingform ] ) according to the single - layer design ( dashed line ) .",
    "the most important conclusion evident in fig .",
    "[ perf1 ] is that our simple analytical model results for the performance of the coronagraph ( eq .",
    "( [ model ] ) ) , based on the identified central defect of the prototype and chromaticity , approximately matches the measurements ( table [ table1 ] ) to the first order .    the best results at 1550 nm ( fig .",

    "results in white light are consistent with the model of eq .",
    "( [ model ] ) , even if limited by photon noise because of the low power of a single mode white light source .",
    "the bench will soon be upgraded with a supercontinuum white light source to enable higher contrast observations .",
    "next , we consider what happens if we cover the central region of disorientation of our prototype with an opaque mask . to precisely assess the diffraction effect that this would induce , numerical simulations with proper were used .",
    "proper is an optical propagation library for idl developed by john krist ( * ? ? ?",

    "it allows us to model the propagation through a realistic model of the coronagraphic mask using fourier transforms , from the entrance pupil to the final image plane .",

    "one very interesting outcome of these simulations of the covering or _",
    "hybridization _ of the phase mask with a very simple amplitude profile , is that it can help us to mitigate the chromaticity ( see the dash - dotted curve linking hollow diamonds in fig .",
    "[ perf1 ] ) .",
    "covering the central region of disorientation thus not only helps us to reach the chromatic limit , but also to beat it significantly , as represented by the vertical arrows in fig .",
    "[ perf1 ] .",

    "our uncertainty for the diameter of the central region of disorientation to use ( owing to our simplistic hole model ) is represented by the horizontal error bars on the measurement points.[perf1 ] ]",
    "our simple model ( eq . ( [ model ] ) ) , which has been confirmed to first order by measurements ( fig .",
    "[ perf1 ] ) , can be used to predict future performance as a function of error terms in eq .",
    "( [ model ] ) , under the assumption that potential second - order defects which are currently not identified can be ignored .",
    "note that for small defect , the rejection is @xmath107^{-1}\\ ] ] if we set a rejection goal , we can conversely derive the following individual constraints , since each term must be smaller than @xmath108 , we have @xmath109 @xmath110    however , in general , these two terms must be combined as in eq .",
    "( [ model ] ) , and as plotted in the solid curves of fig .",
    "[ perf2 ] . once again , we next considered covering up the central region of disorientation by an opaque mask .",
    "the main results of the optical propagation analysis with proper is that by covering up the central zone , the device can once again operate at the chromatic limit for much larger central defects ( fig .",
    "[ perf2 ] , dash - dotted line ) .",
    "thus , by covering up the central defect , the constraint of eq .",
    "( [ model3 ] ) can be dramatically relaxed .",
    "our numerical simulations using proper also show that the size of the occulting zone ought to be within @xmath111 in diameter , beyond which too much of the vortex is covered .    ]",
    "we have demonstrated for the first time that a vortex synthesized out of a space - variant birefringent element , i.e. a vectorial vortex acts as a viable coronagraph , as predicted .",
    "thanks to ground - breaking advances in lcp technology , a usable sample was produced in a very short time . even though the first prototype falls short of the specifications of next generation ground - based instruments for exoplanet imaging and characterization , such as sphere @xcite , gpi @xcite , palm-3000 @xcite , and hicio @xcite , we have easily identified the major achille s heel of the prototype , the central region of disorientation .",
    "we have good reasons to believe that this purely mechanical problem can be overcome ( sect . [ carac ] ) .",
    "it is currently being addressed , with the objective of reducing this region from 68 microns to a few microns . at such scales , as seen above , a simple occulting mask should be sufficient to hide the remaining defects without affecting the vortex effect down to the levels required by earth - like planet detection .",
    "the ability of lcp to synthesize optical vortices is excellent , with the potential of high - level achromatization and the straightforward possibility of implementing very high topological charges ( samples of topological charge of 8 have already been produced , scott mceldowney , personal communication ) .",
    "prototyping operations with the purpose of assessing this potential in detail are underway at jpl with our industrial partner jdsu , both in the visible wavelength range on the high contrast imaging testbed ( hcit ) , in the context of a small space - based observatory dedicated to exoplanet imaging @xcite , and in the frame - work of extreme adaptive optics preparatory experiments from the ground @xcite .",
    "this work was carried out at the jet propulsion laboratory ( jpl ) , california institute of technology ( caltech ) , under contract with the national aeronautics and space administration ( nasa ) .",
