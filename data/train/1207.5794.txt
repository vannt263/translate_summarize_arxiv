    "the c@xmath0 molecule , buckminsterfullerene , was discovered in laboratory experiments aimed at understanding the formation of long carbon chains in the circumstellar environment of carbon stars and their survival in the interstellar medium ( ism , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in these experiments ,",
    "graphite was vaporized in a hydrogen - poor atmosphere using helium as a buffer gas , resulting in clusters of carbonaceous particles of different sizes . amongst the cluster population ,",
    "the particles with 60 carbon atoms were the most stable species and the researchers concluded that these species are structured like a truncated icosahedron  often compared to the geometry of a black and white soccer ball .",
    "fullerenes are now known as a class of carbon based molecules in the shape of a hollow sphere or ellipsoid .",
    "fullerenes can be formed very efficiently in laboratory experiments , converting a few percent of graphite into c@xmath0 @xcite .",
    "as soon as they were discovered , it was suggested that their extreme stability , in particular against photodissocation , makes fullerenes ideally suited to survive the harsh radiation field in the ism , and thus could be widespread in the galaxy ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) . once injected into the ism",
    ", they could contribute to interstellar extinction , heating , charge exchange with ions , and provide active surfaces for complex chemical reactions @xcite .",
    "they have also been suggested to be responsible for the dust - correlated excess in microwave background radiation observed in some molecular clouds @xcite .",
    "recently , we have detected and identified the vibrational modes of the fullerene species c@xmath0 and c@xmath2 in the spitzer - irs spectrum of the young planetary nebula tc  1 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* paperi hereafter ) .",
    "c@xmath0 has now been detected in many more evolved stars : a handful of pne in the milky way @xcite and the magellanic clouds @xcite ; in the protoplanetary nebula @xcite ; in the post - agb stars , @xcite and @xcite ; in the surroundings of a few r  cor  bor stars @xcite and in the peculiar binary object @xcite .",
    "these detections suggest that fullerenes are formed by the complex , rich circumstellar chemistry that occurs in the short transition phase from agb star towards pn ( paper i , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , or more generally in the circumstellar environments of carbon - rich evolved stars .",
    "however , it is not clear how the fullerenes form .",
    "proposed mechanisms include the formation in hydrogen - poor environments ; photo - chemical processing of hydrogenated amorphous carbon ( a - c : h or hac ) grains ; high temperature formation in carbon - rich environments or the formation of fullerenes from the destruction of pahs .",
    "the ir c@xmath0 bands have also been seen in the interstellar medium and in young stellar objects .",
    "following their earlier suggestions @xcite , @xcite confirmed the presence of c@xmath0 in the reflection nebulae and , and showed that in ngc7023 , the fullerenes emision comes from a different location than that of the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon ( pah ) bands .",
    "@xcite furthermore report the detection of c@xmath0 in the orion nebula , and @xcite found the c@xmath0 bands in a few young stellar objects and a herbig ae / be star .",
    "these detections show that fullerenes can survive the conditions in the ism and become incorporated into the regions around young stars and , possibly , planetary systems",
    ".    a key question in the studies of fullerenes in astrophysical environments is what drives the excitation of these species .",
    "this is fundamentally important , since it determines how the fullerene bands can be used to probe the physical conditions of the environment in which they reside .",
    "while the presence of circumstellar and interstellar fullerenes is now firmly established , many questions about their excitation mechanism remain ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for a review ) .",
    "three different mechanisms have been considered . in paper",
    "i , we showed that the relative strength of the c@xmath0 and c@xmath2 bands in tc  1 are consistent with a thermal distribution over the excited states .",
    "such an excitation mechanism could be understood if the fullerenes are not free gas - phase species , but are instead in the solid state or attached to dust grains .",
    "such a solid state origin could also explain the lack of anharmonicities in the band profiles and the apparent lack of ionized fullerenes .",
    "@xcite and @xcite on the other hand assume that the fullerene emission originates from ir fluorescence of isolated free molecules in the gas phase .",
    "they compare the band ratios of the 7.0@xmath1m/18.9@xmath1 m fullerene bands in their observations to monte carlo simulations for stochastic heating and fluorescent cooling , and find agreement for one object but not the other @xcite .",
    "the third mechanism is based on chemical excitation , and involves h atom recombination in hac materials @xcite .    in spite of clear spectral differences resulting from both mechanisms ( see   [ sect : excitation ] )",
    ", there is no clear consensus yet on the precise mechanism that operates in the astrophysical environments where fullerenes reside , and observational support for either mechanism can be found . in several cases where the 17.4 and 18.9@xmath1 m bands are detected ,",
    "the 7.0 and 8.5@xmath1 m bands are very weak or absent , and this is hard to understand when considering fluorescence . on the other hand , little variation has been reported in the relative band strengths of the 17.4 and 18.9@xmath1 m bands , which is hard to understand in the framework of thermal models .",
    "two contributing factors have hampered progress in determining the excitation mechanism .",
    "first , most observations that exhibit the fullerene bands are strongly affected by pah emission , which makes a good determination of the fullerene band strengths very difficult at best .",
    "second , there is a large scatter in the existing literature about what are the intrinsic band strengths of the fullerene bands .",
    "consequently , the measured observational values could lead to quite different conclusions depending on what intrinsic values are used .",
    "+ in this paper we analyze and compare the spitzer - irs spectra of three pne exhibiting clear and strong emission of circumstellar fullerenes .",
    "two of these pne , tc1 and have been published in the literature , while the mid - ir spectrum of the third object , , is presented here for the first time .",
    "the three pne are ideally suited to study the excitation mechanism of circumstellar fullerenes : there is no discernible pah emission present that could have a big contaminating influence on the fullerene band strengths ; the relative strength of the fine - structure lines furthermore indicates that the overall excitation conditions in the three nebulae are different ; and we have some additional spatial information for one object ( tc  1 ) . at the same time , the three spectra offer intriguing clues about the formation of circumstellar fullerenes .",

    "* ) on board the spitzer space telescope ( sst , * ? ? ?",
    "the mid - ir spectrum of tc1 was published by @xcite and our group ( paperi ) and consists of observations at high resolution covering the 1036@xmath1 m range ( using the short - high ( sh ) and long - high ( lh ) modules ) as well as observations using the short - low ( sl ) and long - low ( ll ) modules covering the wavelength range between 5.436@xmath1 m at a variable resolution of 60120 .",
    "smp  smc  16 was part of the sample presented by @xcite but we have re - extracted its spectrum with our method for consistency . the spectrum of smp  lmc  56 is obtained from the spitzer archive ( aor key @xmath3 22423808 , pid@xmath340159 , pi : a.g.g.m .",

    "both smp  lmc  56 and smc  smc  16 were observed at low resolution only using the sl and ll modules .",

    "the extraction procedures for these two objects follow those of our earlier papers ( paper i ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; we summarize the main steps below .",
    "the data reduction started from the basic calibrated data products ( bcd ) .",
    "first , rogue or unstable pixels were removed and replaced using the irsclean tool .",
    "then the different cycles were combined for a given module and order . to remove the background , the nod positions for a given module and order combination where subtracted from each other .",
    "there seems to be some extended emission in smp  lmc  56 around 33@xmath1 m in the ll1 module which could affect the 33.4@xmath1 m line .",
    "similarly , this spectrum also shows a slight difference in the absolute flux between nod1 and nod2 in the ll modules ( @xmath412% ) .",
    "none of these affect in any way the conclusions of the paper .",
    "the final step is to extract the differenced images .",
    "both objects are a point source for the spitzer - irs beam and thus we used the optimal extraction algorithm implemented in _",
    "smart_. after optimal extraction , any remaining glitches that may have prevailed from the previous steps were removed manually .",
    "finally , the two nods were combined to increase the signal - to - noise .",
    "no scaling was needed between the modules .",
    "the resulting spectra are shown in figure  [ fig : rawspectra ] .      to aid further discussions ,",
    "we provide a brief description here of the different features in the spectra . as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : rawspectra ] , the spectra of tc1 , smp  lmc  56 , and smp  smc  16 reveal the same overall shape : a strong rising dust continuum on which many emission features are superposed .",
    "some of these are better seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : normspec ] where we show continuum subtracted , as well as normalized , spectra .",
    "the spectra exhibit many low excitation fine - structure lines .",
    "these show up clearly as narrow lines in the high resolution part of the spectrum of tc 1 ( @xmath5 m ) which makes it straightforward to distinguish them from other spectral features . in the low - resolution observations ,",
    "the much larger line width makes it harder to separate the fine - structure lines from other bands .",
    "the most prominent lines are [ ] ( 6.99@xmath1 m ) , [ ] ( 8.99@xmath1 m ) , [ ] ( 12.81@xmath1 m ) , [ ] ( 15.55@xmath1 m ) and [ ] ( 18.7 @xmath1 m ) .",
    "a weak line at 10.51@xmath1 m is present as well . in tc  1 ,",
    "the line at 18.7@xmath1 m is perched on top of the much broader c@xmath0  band . in the low - resolution spectra of smp",
    "lmc  56 and smp  smc  16 , the presence of the [ ] can be inferred from band asymmetries ( see appendix ) .",
    "we note that the 34.8@xmath1 m line of in smp  lmc  56 is contaminated by the extended emission mentioned in  2.1 , and we can not determine how much of it originates from the actual source .",
    "these spectra furthermore clearly show fullerene emission bands , and it is remarkable how similar the relative strength of the fullerene bands are in these three pne ( fig .",
    "there is little to no contamination by pah features , and thus these three objects represent some of the clearest detections of fullerenes .",
    "most notable are the strong and broad c@xmath0 bands at 7.0 , 8.5 , 17.4 and 18.9@xmath1 m .",
    "tc1 furthermore also exhibits weaker features at 12.7 , 14.8 , 15.6 and 21.8@xmath1 m that are attributed to @xmath6 ( paperi ) ; c@xmath2 also contributes ( @xmath4 10% of the total power ) to the 17.4 and 18.9@xmath1 m bands . these features could be present in the spectrum of smp  lmc  56 , but seem absent in smp  smc  16 .",
    "individually , the spectra show little evidence for the presence of pahs , which are typically seen in carbon - rich pne .",
    "however , the three spectra do show a weak bump at 11.3@xmath1 m ; emission at these wavelengths is generally attributed to pahs .",
    "smp  lmc  56 also shows a feature near 12.7@xmath1 m where another pah band is commonly seen ; however , in our case , this feature may be due to c@xmath2 .",
    "other pah bands are not easily identified .",
    "notably absent is the usually strong 7.7@xmath1 m pah band .",
    "there is a very weak bump near 6.2@xmath1 m in tc1 and smp  lmc  56 , which is not clear or present in smp  smc  16 while any possible 8.6@xmath1 m pah emission will be blended with the c@xmath0 feature .",
    "very striking in the spectra of all three pne are the broad emission plateaus between 69@xmath1 m and between 1013@xmath1 m . similar plateaus in these spectral regions have been attributed to modes of alkane and alkene groups on the periphery of polycyclic aromatic systems in proto - pne by @xcite .",
    "the 69@xmath1 m plateau is seen in very few other pne and could thus well be related to the fullerene formation process .",
    "in fact , @xcite hypothesize that these features are due to hacs , and that fullerenes are formed from the decomposition of these hac grains .",
    "we discuss this further in  5 . in this paper",
    "we use the term hac in its broader sense to include the whole family of these materials ( e.g. petroleum , coals , quenched carbonaceous composite a - c : h , a - c , etcetera ) .",
    "the 6 - 9@xmath1 m plateau reveals some substructure as well .",
    "this substructure is present in both nod positions , and in each of the three objects confirming that these are real spectral features .",
    "tc 1 and smp  lmc  56 have features at 6.49 and 6.65 @xmath1 m .",
    "these are also observed in a few post - agb stars @xcite .",
    "in addition , there is a fairly broad feature between roughly 7.35 and 7.85@xmath1 m best seen in smp smc 16 and smp lmc 56 .",
    "the width of the feature is about the same as that of the c@xmath0 bands .",
    "it is interesting to note that 7.5@xmath1 m is about the wavelength where a c@xmath7 band is expected @xcite .",
    "tc1 and smp  lmc  56 also show a small peak at about 7.48@xmath1 m , most likely due to the recombination line .",
    "finally , smp  lmc  56 and smp  smc  16 show a feature at 8.15@xmath1 m which is not present in tc1 .",
    "the plateau emission in the 10 - 13@xmath1 m region is quite strong in tc  1 and smp  smc  16 , and weaker in smp  lmc  56 .",
    "a 10 - 13@xmath1 m emission plateau is also observed towards other pne @xcite and is generally attributed to sic @xcite .",
    "however , the profile of the plateau in our three pne is quite different from those pne , and suggests that here , a different carrier might be responsible .    in all three sources ,",
    "we also detect the so - called 30@xmath1 m feature that is commonly seen in carbon - rich pne .",
    "this feature is often attributed to mgs @xcite , but could also have a carbonaceous origin ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "finally , smc smc 16 shows an asymmetric feature that peaks at 14.5@xmath1 m ; it is not clear what the origin is of this feature .",

    "we mapped the distribution of the thermally emitting dust by using the flux at 9.46@xmath1 m . from fig .",

    "as it has been suggested before , these conditions ( young , carbon - rich , low excitation ) appears to favor the formation of fullerenes .    although the conditions in the three pne are quite similar , they are not the same .",

    "[ fig : diagplot8.5_17.4 ] it is clear that already at unrealistically low photon energies of 1 ev ( the lowest point on the curves ) , the fluorescence models predict a band at 8.5@xmath1 m that is about 1020% of the 18.9@xmath1 m band . for more reasonable values of the absorbed energy ( 510 ev ) , the 8.5@xmath1 m band should be about 4060% of the 18.9@xmath1 m flux . however , the measured ratio is @xmath25 which then implies a low photon energy ( @xmath26 ev ) .",
    "in fact , for tc  1 ( and the weighted mean value ) , we can exclude excitation by 5  ev photons at the 5@xmath27 ( or better ) confidence level , independently of the chosen source of intrinsic band strengths .",
    "such low photon energies would be very hard to understand since it would imply that the fullerenes do not get excited through their strong electronic transitions at uv wavelengths in spite of a strong radiation field .",
    "since this result holds for all sources of intrinsic strength , and since the 8.5 @xmath1 m band strength is well determined ( i.e. it is not possible that we miss a large fraction of the flux in this band ) , the 8.5 @xmath1 m band strength thus excludes quite strongly the possibility that the observed fullerene emission is due to fluorescence by isolated molecules in the gas phase .",
    "note that for the 7.0@xmath1 m band ( fig .",
    "[ fig : diagplot7.0_17.4 ] ) , the same conclusion holds , but then for opposite reasons : explaining the observed 7.0@xmath1 m band strength requires unreasonably high energies for the exciting photons .",
    "thermal models on the other hand require a temperature in the range 300 - 400k to explain the 8.5@xmath1 m band strength which at first sounds reasonable .",
    "however , since the relative strength of the 8.5@xmath1 m band is nearly the same in all three objects , this implies that also the fullerene temperatures are nearly exactly the same in all three sources ; this would be either very coincidental , or an important factor in explaining the presence of fullerenes .",
    "furthermore , the observed 7.0@xmath1 m flux is much higher than would be expected for thermal excitation , and this holds for all sources of band strength .",
    "thus , the observations are only consistent with thermal models if the 7.0@xmath1 m band would be primarily due to [ ] and only a small fraction of the 7.0 @xmath1 m flux could be attributed to c@xmath0 .",
    "in such a case , the intrinsic strengths listed by @xcite are fully consistent with the observations ( which were the values we used in paper i ) .",
    "however , we do not believe this to be the case ( see appendix )  most of the 7.0@xmath1 m seems to be originating from c@xmath0 .",
    "thus , we have to conclude that neither thermal nor fluorescence models can explain the observations completely .      in spite of the difficulties in reconciling the observations with models , the three spectra presented here offer important clues to the excitation mechanism . an important ingredient in understanding the excitation of fullerenes in our sources",
    "is the spatial distribution of some of the spectral components in tc  1 ( sect .",
    "[ sect : spatial ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : spatial ] ) . as we discussed , the c@xmath0 emission peaks at a distance of about 8000  au from the central star .",
    "given the central star s effective temperature of @xmath28k , classical `` graphitic '' dust in equilibrium with the radiation field would be very cold , with temperatures of only 2025k .",
    "however , we find that hydrogen - rich hac nanoparticles can be maintained at temperatures of 100150 k at distances of 3000 to 10000 au because of their low emissivities at far - infrared wavelengths .",
    "this is still not sufficient to heat the fullerenes to the required thermal temperatures of @xmath4300  k. the spatial information thus rules out thermal emission , and favours fluorescence . for fluorescence ,",
    "the average photon energy @xmath24 absorbed by the molecules is a function of the local radiation field and the absorption cross section of the molecule ; this then quite naturally explains why the fullerene band strengths are so similar in the three objects since their central stars have comparable effective temperatures and thus the average absorbed photon energy is very similar as well ; for thermal models such a coincidence would required fine - tuned conditions in all three pne .    however , as we discussed above , the observations are not consistent with models for fluorescent ir emission either : for realistic energies , all models for fluorescence predict a much stronger 8.5@xmath1 m band and a much weaker 7.0@xmath1 m band ( all relative to the 18.9@xmath1 m band ) than is observed , and this is the case for all sources of intrinsic band strength .",
    "note that the normalization to the 18.9@xmath1 m band in itself is not the issue either  if the 18.9@xmath1 m band would be weaker than we measure , this could conceivably bring the 8.5@xmath1 m band flux in agreement with models , but then the problem with the 7.0@xmath1 m band would even be worse .    since it is clear that we are not seeing emission from isolated , free c@xmath0 molecules , an obvious first question is whether we re maybe seeing emission from fullerene clusters or nano - crystals .",
    "such entities that are larger than single molecules could still undergo single - photon heating and ir fluorescence through the same vibrational modes , but their larger heat capacity would result in different band ratios  with lower fluxes at shorter wavelengths .",
    "this could possibly explain the discrepancy for the 8.5 @xmath1 m band , but not for the 7.0@xmath1 m band , where the problem would be even bigger .",
    "it is instructive to look at the issue starting from the 8.5 @xmath1 m band , since this band does not seem contaminated by other emission components .",
    "the problem is then that both the observed 18.9 @xmath1 m and the 7.0@xmath1 m bands are too strong to be explained by fluorescence of free isolated c@xmath0 molecules .",
    "this then indicates that other materials are contributing to the 7.0 and 18.9 @xmath1 m band . for the 18.9@xmath1 m band",
    "we have already identified one contributor : c@xmath2 . given the strength of the other c@xmath2 bands in the same wavelength range ( for tc  1 )",
    ", it seems unlikely though that we severely underestimate its contribution to the 18.9 @xmath1 m band ; to explain the discrepancies , we would require roughly four times more c@xmath2 than we have currently estimated . for the 7.0@xmath1 m band on the other hand , we have not considered a possible contribution of c@xmath2 yet .",
    "the intrinsically strongest c@xmath2 band occurs indeed near 7.0@xmath1 m .",
    "when using thermal models at the fairly low temperatures we derived in paper i , the transitions at the shorter wavelengths are suppressed significantly , to the point where this band becomes unmeasurably weak .",
    "when using fluorescence models however , this is not the case , and based on the intrinsic strength of the band , it could well be responsible for a large fraction of the observed discrepancy .",
    "note that c@xmath2 still has other features at wavelengths between 510@xmath1 m that should then be reconsidered in the framework of fluorescence , and it is not clear whether attributing the 7.0@xmath1 m flux to c@xmath2 is consistent with the expected strengths of these features .",
    "the three spectra we present here also offer intriguing clues to the formation of circumstellar fullerenes . indeed , as we discussed in sect .",
    "[ sect : data ] , the three pne share other notable spectral features in addition to the fullerene bands . of particular importance for the discussion on fullerene formation mechanisms",
    "are the plateaus .",
    "several formation routes are possible in the laboratory or have been proposed , including : 1 ) low - temperature formation in the absence of hydrogen @xcite ; 2 ) high - temperature ( @xmath29k ) formation in which case hydrogen may be present @xcite ; 3 ) photo - chemical processing of hydrogenated amorphous carbon ( hac , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; and 4 ) destruction of pahs @xcite .",
    "the plateaus are particularly interesting in this context since @xcite attribute the 69@xmath1 m and 1013@xmath1 m broad features in their sample of pne to unprocessed clusters of small carbonaceous grains and/or large pah clusters .",
    "@xcite on the other hand propose that these are due to hacs , which they then suggest become photo - chemically processed to produce the fullerenes .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : spechac ] we show the 614@xmath1 m ir spectra of tc1 , smp  lmc  56 and smp  smc  16 compared to the ir spectra of hac / a - c : h particles with a radius of 3 nm at a temperature of 200k and with varying atom hydrogen fractions of 0.23 , 0.29 and 0.35 ; this is equivalent to band gaps of 1.0 , 1.25 and 1.5 ev , respectively @xcite .",
    "the spectra of these particles are dominated by aliphatic and aromatic cc and ch bands @xcite . as shown by @xcite these materials",
    "appear to also contain few olefinic bands .",
    "the overlapping of the aliphatic , aromatic , and olefinic bands results in a plateau - like region underlying the c@xmath0 7.0 and 8.5@xmath1 m bands and also in bands in the 1113@xmath1 m plateau regionm the strength of the bands are not well characterized .",
    "the comparison of the observations and models in this region remains qualitative , particularly in terms of the band strengths . ] .",
    "we note that the shape of the continuum matches the observed 6 to 9@xmath1 m plateau emission under the fullerene bands and the atomic lines rather well in these continuum - subtracted spectra .",
    "these spectral bands , underlying the fullerene bands , appear to be rather invariant from source to source , suggesting that the particles responsible for these plateaus are therefore small enough to be stochastically heated .",
    "however , there is a band at 6.5@xmath1 m in the observed spectra that we are unable to identify .",
    "the spectra of tc1 , lmc56 and smc16 appear to be consistent with these h - rich carbonaceous materials ( h atomic fraction 0.35 @xmath30 0.47 ) .",
    "since exposure to uv radiation tends to reduce the hydrogen content of these hac / a - c : h particles and aromatize the carbonaceous content , this indicates that the particles have not been long - exposed to a strong radiation field . in the diffuse ism , where the dust is exposed to uv irradiation for millions of years , the small hac / a - c : h particles are expected to be h - poor , with an h atom fraction of the order of only 0.05 ( e.g. , *",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "typical pahs ( i.e. meaning strictly pure aromatics ) can be ruled out based on the presence of aliphatic bands in the 6 - 9  @xmath1 m spectral region and the shape of the 11 - 13  @xmath1 m plateau .",
    "one possible scenario that could therefore explain the particularity of the fullerene sources is that small carbonaceous hac / a - c : h particles have recently emerged , either by being released from larger ( coagulated / accreted ) particles or by the ablation of matter from a denser medium , where the a - c : h materials were h - rich .",
    "thus , the carbonaceous dust in these sources would appear to be rather young , in that it has not yet been exposed to stellar radiation for long enough for it to be significantly dehydrogenated and aromatized .",
    "this could be understood in the context of optically thick dust not allowing the uv radiation to penetrate until very recently , on its way to becoming optically thin .",
    "it is perhaps these conditions that are conducive to fullerene molecule formation by a top - down formation from much larger , 3d carbonaceous particles ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) rather than via the pah - warping mechanism proposed by @xcite .",
    "as we saw in  3 the central stars of the three pne have similar ( low ) effective temperatures ( @xmath43000045000  k ) .",
    "so far , fullerenes have been detected in low excitation environments ( e.g. proto - pne , reflection nebulae , ysos ) .",
    "the link with low excitation environments has been noted by evans et al 2012 in their study of r coronae borealis stars . as discussed in @xcite , fullerene formation",
    "is not favored in very low t@xmath21 sources because of the lack of sufficient uv photons to dehydrogenate and heat the dust .",
    "if it is too high however , fullerenes may not be formed because h - rich carbonaceous particles are destroyed before they can form fullerenes .",
    "conversely , the fullerenes would be ionized in which case they have many more bands and their emission will be diluted making them much more difficult to detect .",
    "it is important to note that not all low excitation pne show fullerene emission and so , other factors may play a role in the formation / destruction of fullerenes .",
    "we have analyzed and compared the mid - ir spectrum of the three fullerene - rich pne tc1 , smp  smc  16 , and smp  lmc  56 to study the fullerene excitation conditions and formation mechanisms .",
    "the pne are low excitation and carbon - rich nebulae with low electron temperature and thus are presumably young .",
    "while other factors may be involved , these conditions seem to favor fullerene formation .",
    "spectroscopically , these unique pne share many properties : they show the strongest and clearest circumstellar fullerene bands ( c@xmath0 ) detected so far while showing little to no evidence for pah emission .",
    "in addition , they all have strong broad bands in the 69@xmath1 m and 1013@xmath1 m range , a similar shape of the dust continuum emission , and emission of the so called 30@xmath1 m emission feature .",
    "the observed fullerene band strengths in the three sources is fairly similar ( within uncertainties ) as well .",
    "however , the intensity of the radiation field in these objects ( as inferred by the fine - structure line ratio [ ] 15.5@xmath1m/[]12.8@xmath1 m ) varies by more than a factor 10 .",
    "furthermore , the spatial profile of different dust components in tc  1 indicates that the fullerene emission ( c@xmath0 ) peaks far away ( 6300 - 9700 au ) from the central source .",
    "all this is hard to reconcile with a thermal origin for the fullerene excitation , and thus favors fluorescence as the excitation mechanism .",
    "fluorescence of free , isolated c@xmath0 molecules would be consistent with the observed band ratios if fluorescent emission from c@xmath2 contributes significantly to the 7.0@xmath1 m band .",
    "additional emitting materials could also be present and this needs to be further investigated .",
    "it is likely that the observed broad bands at 69 and 10 - 13@xmath1 m are related to the fullerene formation process .",
    "we present model spectra of hac particles of 3  nm and show that these can reproduce the 6 - 9@xmath1 m band with some degree of success , which may imply that fullerenes are formed by photo - chemical processing of hac .",
    "the detection of c@xmath0 and of other unidentified features in these nebulae is very intriguing .",
    "additional information and a larger sample are required to discern the mechanisms that trigger fullerene formation , and set their importance and role in the ism , but it seems that when the conditions are met , pne can be important sources of fullerenes .",
    "we characterized the dust continuum by fitting a cubic spline through anchor points free of emission features along the spectrum of each source ( see figure  1 ) .",
    "we have not attempted to define the continuum beyond @xmath425@xmath1 m because this position marks approximately the onset of the 30@xmath1 m feature , which usually extends beyond 40@xmath1 m .",
    "we quantified the amount of dust emission in each source by integrating the dust continua from 525@xmath1 m ( see table  [ table : fluxes ] ) .",
    "we then measured the fluxes in the fullerene bands and estimated the associated uncertainties in the following way .    in the high - resolution spectrum of tc  1 ,",
    "the strong [ ] line at 18.7@xmath1 m is much narrower than the broad fullerene emission band , and it is thus straightforward to determine its contribution to the flux in the emission band .",
    "the fullerene flux can thus be measured by simply integrating over the entire band and subtracting this [ ] contribution .",
    "the nominal uncertainty on the flux value obtained in this way is of the order of a percent .",
    "however , we feel that there is a larger source of uncertainty that originates from the positioning of the underlying continuum . to estimate this uncertainty",
    ", we fitted the observed band profile with three components : a broad gaussian profile for the fullerene bandm fullerene band is fairly symmetric , and can be well reproduced by a gaussian profile . ] , a narrow gaussian profile for the [ ] line , and a linear baseline that extends well beyond the band on both sides . in our best fit model ,",
    "the uncertainty in the flux contained in this linear baseline is about 15% of the flux contained in the broad gaussian representing the fullerene band , and represents a much larger uncertainty on our flux measurements since it is not clear whether the flux in our baseline really belongs to the continuum , or to the fullerene band ( which would imply the true fullerene band profile is not gaussian ) .",
    "our best estimate for the fullerene flux thus includes half of the flux in this baseline .",
    "we note that we also expect c@xmath2 fullerenes to contribute to this band , and thus we subtracted the estimated c@xmath2 contribution ( see paper i ) to finally obtain the c@xmath0 flux ( see table  [ table : fluxes ] ) .    in the low - resolution observations of smp  smc  16 and smp  lmc  56",
    ", the [ ] line does contribute to the 18.9@xmath1 m band , but it is much harder to separate from the fullerene band .",
    "once again , we fitted the entire band using two gaussian profiles and a linear baseline .",
    "this time though , we fixed the central wavelength of one component to the position of the [ ] line and its width to the instrumental resolution .",
    "again , we can reproduce the observations quite well , and we follow the same approach as for tc  1 to determine the fullerene flux and to estimate the uncertainty ( see table  [ table : fluxes ] ) . + in the spectrum of tc  1 , the observed 17.4@xmath1 m band is not as symmetric as the 18.9@xmath1 m band , and shows some clear structure in its profile .",
    "furthermore , there is weak emission in the red wing of the band amongst others due to a [ ] line at 17.88@xmath1 m , these however represent less than 10% of the total flux in the band .",
    "we still used a gaussian fit to the band to estimate the uncertainty introduced by mispossitioning the continuum ; but since the band profile is asymmetric , we used the total integrated flux over the band ( minus the contaminants and minus half the baseline flux ) rather than the flux in the gaussian fit as the best estimate for the fullerene flux . as before , we used the flux in the baseline as our uncertainty estimate . for smp",
    "smc  16 and smp  lmc  56 , we could not estimate the contribution of the contaminants ; therefore , the actual fullerene flux values are probably slightly lower than what we listed in table  [ table : fluxes ] ; however , the contribution of these weak lines is probably smaller than the uncertainty on the flux value .",
    "the 8.5@xmath1 m band was only observed at low - resolution in all three sources .",
    "there are no clear contaminants , and in all three sources , the band can be well reproduced by a gaussian profile ( with possibly a small red wing asymmetry in the spectra of smp  smc  16 and smp  lmc  56 ) . for tc  1 ,",
    "even the error introduced by continuum effects is very small ; for the other sources , a slight red wing asymmetry is the largest source of uncertainty ( of the order of 15% ) .",
    "as was noted in paper  i , the observed 7.0@xmath1 m band in tc  1 is a blend of c@xmath0 emission and an unresolved [ ] line that occurs at nearly the same wavelength .",
    "thus , it was not clear what fraction of the emission band was due to c@xmath0 . here , we tried the same approach as for the 18.9@xmath1 m band in the low - resolution spectra of smp smc 16 and smp lmc 56 : we carried out a two - component gauss fit , where the central wavelength of one component is fixed to the position of the [ ] line and its width to the spectral resolution . in this way",
    ", we find that for tc  1 , most of the 7.0@xmath1 m emission band is in fact due to fullerenes ; only about 15% of the flux is due to the [ ] line .",
    "this agrees well with an estimate for the [ ] flux obtained from the following abundance argument .",
    "@xcite compare tc  1 to ic418 , and find that these two pne are very similar in terms of excitation properties and physical conditions .",
    "however , while the ionic abundance of ar@xmath31 is the same for both objects , that of ar@xmath32 is 5.8 times higher in tc  1 than in ic 418 .",
    "clearly , the discrepancy arises from the fact that the 7.0@xmath1 m flux was interpreted as pure [ ] emission and no contribution of c@xmath0 was taken into account .",
    "this then implies that the flux measured in the 7.0@xmath1 m band mostly originates from the fullerene band , and only about 1/6 of the emission is originating from the [ ] line , consistent with our measurements above . for smp smc 16",
    ", we similarly find that the [ ] flux is about 15% of the total emission in the band ; for smp lmc 56 however , the best fit solution has no contribution of [ ] ( see table  [ table : fluxes ] ) . for this band ,",
    "the uncertainty on the baseline is small , and the uncertainty on the flux values is dominated by the noise on the observations ."
