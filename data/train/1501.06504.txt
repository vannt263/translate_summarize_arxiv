    "commonly , the sliding current of an incommensurate charge density wave ( cdw ) is driven by the electric field @xmath3 in the direction @xmath4 of chains , which is originated by the applied voltage @xmath5 and mediated by the normal current density @xmath6 .",
    "new experiments @xcite on mesa junctions in a high magnetic field ( hmf ) @xcite show , for the first time , that the cdw can be driven also by the hall voltage @xmath7 originated by the normal current passing in a transverse direction , fig.[fig : scheme+mesa ] .",
    "the observations are quite counterintuitive with respect to the common notion . in a narrow channel cut",
    "transversely to the chains , the conductivity drops below the threshold rather than rising , shapiro steps are quantized in voltage rather than in current , etc .    facing these challenges",
    ", we shall discuss here the hall effect in the deformable cdw at the quantum limit of normal carriers .",
    "our other studies show that the regime of classically strong magnetic fields ( before installing the quantum hall regime at lowest lls ) can not reproduce the complex of experimental dependencies on b and sizes and the scale of the universal josephson ratio for shapiro steps . as a minimal model of the basic experimental geometry shown in fig.[fig : scheme+mesa ] ( left panel ) , we shall consider a hall bar with the current and the magnetic field applied orthogonally in the interchain directions @xmath8 .",
    "small pockets of electrons can be present in the otherwise gapped cdw state . in a layered system at hmf",
    "the carriers are concentrated at one or a few lowest lls forming fractionally ( @xmath9 ) filled qh state .",
    "as always , the lorentz force pushes electrons to one edge @xmath10 of the bar forming the slightly over / under charged boundary layers which give rise to the hall voltage which strength @xmath11 compensates for the lorentz force .",
    "but now , the gigantic polarizability of the cdw reduces the electric field allowing for so strong redistributions of electronic densities which are unthinkable in usual circumstances .",
    "e.g. at low temperature t<1k , the experimental @xmath12 forces all carriers to completely fill a fraction @xmath1 of the chain length , thus forming there the integer qh state , while leaving the fraction @xmath2 of the chain length unoccupied .",
    "in a ( quasi)-2d system at a hmf the electrons form essentially quantum states .",
    "but with transitions among the lls being frozen , the kinetic energy leaves the game , then the density is determined classically by the electric potential @xmath13 .    at edges of usual qh setups ,",
    "the density distribution follows almost slavishly the strong coulomb potential which has been build up already before the hmf was applied ; it comes from pronounced finite size effects for the 2d electron gas embedded to the 3d geometry of the device , see @xcite .",
    "but for electrons in pockets upon the cdw , deformations of the cdw phase are able to neutralize any charge so that electrons are allowed to form themselves highly inhomogeneous distributions . here",
    "they are originated intrinsically , to provide the electric field opposing the lorentz force . at low @xmath14 , that extents to separation of the mean carriers density @xmath15 among a fully depleted - @xmath16 region where @xmath17 and an overfilled one - @xmath18 where @xmath19 , i.e. between the two , both nonconducting , regions where the same ll is either full or empty .",

    "each chain segment bears a few @xmath27 electrons . in the hmf",
    "they are supposed to occupy the lowest ll which can acquire as much as @xmath28 electrons .",
    "the mean ll filling is @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the magnetic length .",
    "the profile for the density of carriers @xmath31 is @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the fermi distribution function at a given t and we have assumed that the ll energy @xmath34 is included to the definition of the fermi potential energy @xmath35 .",
    "the level @xmath35 is determined at the fixed number of particles by the condition @xmath36 the in - plane current density in the direction @xmath37 is given by properties of the landau eigenfunctions in crossed electric and magnetic fields : @xmath38 integration over @xmath4 gives the overall @xmath37 current as a function of only values of the boundary potentials : @xmath39 + 1 } { \\exp[(\\phi_{f}-\\phi(l))/t]+1 } \\label{j , v0,v1}\\ ] ]    in the limit @xmath40 and if all states are filled ( @xmath41 which requires that both @xmath42 ) , then we recover the standard result of the iqhe @xmath43 . in the limit @xmath40 for the partial filling @xmath0 ,",
    "the states are all filled over a segment @xmath44 and all are depleted beyond , i.e. @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 ; then @xmath48 depends explicitly only on the potential at one boundary . but",
    "this is only a part of the total voltage : the electric potential keeps growing also in the depleted region @xmath49 .",
    "the solution of the elementary electrostatic problem yields the value of @xmath50 at the depleted boundary .",
    "finally the mean current density reproduces the standard result for the classical hall conductance @xmath51 : @xmath52 we have got that , in spite of the iqh filling of the populated area , because the division line between the areas is displaced with changing @xmath53 .    by now , there was no voltage drop in @xmath37 direction which can be only the dissipative @xmath54 with a negligible @xmath55 . for that , the longitudinal conductivities @xmath56 , @xmath57 should be small with respect to the transverse one @xmath58 . in conventional qh devices",
    "it comes from localization of carriers ( as the consequence of absence of their kinetic energy ) at irregular potential of dopants . for electrons in nbse3 , with its @xmath59 hierarchy , at least the interchain conductivity @xmath57 is very small which ensures the condition @xmath60 for domination of the transverse ( @xmath61 ) currents @xmath62 and of the lorentz force .    allowing the cdw to start sliding brings about the normal counter - current @xmath63 .",
    "the lorentz force component appears in @xmath37 direction giving rise to the additional voltage @xmath64 .",
    "its magnitude is given by the universal law similar to ( [ j , v0,v1 ] ) with interchanged indices @xmath4 and @xmath37 ( and the opposite sign ) .",
    "for the current per chain we get ( the second line in ( [ delta - vy ] ) is written for @xmath65 ) : @xmath66 here @xmath67 is the mean interchain voltage drop ; literarily , it is concentrated only over the filled stripe @xmath68 and it is zero elsewhere while actually the source and the drain edges are expected to be equipotential .",
    "following the experience @xcite from the traditional iqhe , that can be corrected by a consistent @xmath69 solution for the distribution of the carries density and the electric field .",
    "by now , we have imposed the perturbation from the @xmath4 currents upon the already solved case of the bias @xmath37 current .",
    "the last step is to remind that the cdw countercurrent , per chain , is @xmath70 and it requires for phase slips to annihilate with the normal current @xmath71 at @xmath72 .",
    "let each phase slip absorbs / releases @xmath73 electrons per chain , then the repetition frequency is @xmath74 we arrive at the josephson relation with an additional factor @xmath73 ; according to experiments , with a good accuracy @xmath75 which provocatively coincides with the number of electrons per chain .",
    "it can happen that each phase slip swallows all electrons at the enriched end to deliver them at the depleted end .",
    "such a strong event can not be localized only near the ends and the whole dynamical problem needs to be modeled .",
    "recall some relevant properties of the cdw in nbse3 .",
    "the most important feature is the gigantic dielectric constant @xmath76 which source is the cdw polarization .",
    "there are several sources in the literature : @xmath77 at t=50k @xcite ; @xmath78 at t=42k , and @xmath79 at t=20k @xcite ; @xmath80 at t=22k @xcite",
    ". we can extrapolate that to lower @xmath81 with a common wisdom ( while not verified at low @xmath14 ) that @xmath82 which itself is known to be @xmath83 with @xmath8415.2k @xcite . taking this law , or just points from plots in @xcite",
    ", we expect a 20 times reduction from @xmath85 to @xmath86 and 3 times from @xmath87 ; then we get the low @xmath14 saturation at @xmath88 .",
    "notice that @xmath89 corresponds to the pinning length @xmath90 , then there will be no bulk pinning at all for our length scales .",
    "now we summarize the facts related to normal carriers in nbse3 at hmf .",
    "hereafter all numerical estimations will be done for @xmath91 .",
    "zeeman splitting is @xmath92 , but still small to fully polarize the pocket of electrons which partial fermi energy is @xmath93 , then @xmath94 of electrons are available to form spinless pairs for an exchange with the cdw condensate .    \\2 .",
    "magnetic length @xmath95 is very short in comparison with the chain length @xmath96 .",
    "there are two types @xmath97 of carriers : extrinsic @xmath98 which are electrons and intrinsic @xmath99 which are holes , with effective masses @xmath100 in the @xmath101 plane .",
    "@xmath102 are the cyclotron frequencies where @xmath103 for electrons and an expected bigger value for lighter holes which are for sure in the truly quantum regime , since b>1 t @xcite .",
    "we shall suppose that bandwidths in the heaviest @xmath104 direction are smaller than @xmath105 which statement is marginal for electrons and may be ensured for holes",
    ". then electrons or at least holes form a 2d state within every @xmath101 plane .",
    "the filling factor @xmath1 of one ll is @xmath106 .",
    "then only one - two lls are necessary to accommodate the present @xmath107 electrons per chain segment and only a small fraction of one ll is sufficient for expected @xmath108 holes . precisely for these numbers : for electrons , the @xmath16 ll will be full and the @xmath109 ll will be filled with a fraction @xmath110 ; for holes , the @xmath16 ll will be filled with the fraction @xmath111 .",
    "we shall proceed with a minimalistic model which concentrates upon only one type of carriers at a zero ll ; the spin splitting is not taken into account .",
    "we shall ignore the special low t states : the fractional qhe at special rational values of @xmath112 and the wigner crystallization ( its source , the long range coulomb repulsion , is strongly suppressed in presence of the cdw ) .",
    "electronic interaction will be taken into account only via the self - consistent slowly varying coulomb potential @xmath113 .",
    "this hartry approximation was used effectively @xcite in theory of inhomogeneous iqhe near gates boundaries in semiconductors .",
    "we shall use the parameters as : chain length @xmath114 , pinning length @xmath115 ( corresponding to @xmath116 ) , temperature @xmath117 , magnetic field @xmath91 , number of particles @xmath118 per @xmath119 ( like for holes ) , filling factor of the ll as @xmath120 and @xmath121 .",
    "we tested @xmath122 and @xmath123 corresponding to the threshold voltage and to the maximal one in experiments .",
    "for static distributions , the analytic treatment is possible at t=0 which may be applicable at the lower experimental limit @xmath124 .",

    "the @xmath65 solution confirms the full charge segregation which sets in when @xmath126 the critical value @xmath127 at @xmath128 is the energy of coulomb interaction between the over- and under charged areas .",

    "the results presented in fig.[fig : plots(x , t ) ] were obtained for @xmath189 , @xmath190 , @xmath191 , @xmath192 , @xmath193 .",
    "also we put @xmath194 which fixes the time scale .",
    "the left panel of fig.[fig : plots(x , t ) ] shows a plot of the electric field @xmath195 .",
    "it demonstrates two domain walls of the propagating depinning which collide and annihilate giving rise to a stationary sliding depinned state with essential but smooth variations over the length .",
    "the plot at the right panel shows that the phase velocity is not as sensitive to the passing walls but gives a strong , very narrow in time peak at their collision .",
    "the interpretation is that electric fields ( created by electrons redistributions near the boundaries ) exceed the threshold field while the bulk is still below that .",
    "the depinning penetrates into the pinned region by propagating sharp fronts of the electric field .",
    "an overshoot will be noticed if we plot also the distribution @xmath196 : behind the fronts the occupation numbers are flat at 1 ( the transient iqhe state ) or zero ( the full depletion ) .",
    "but later on the smooth profiles are established .    by now",
    ", we studied only the single run ( after switching on of the boundary potentials ) assuming a source and a drain for the cdw current by phase slips .",
    "the implementation to the hall bar and particularly to observed oscillations is anticipated to be the following , recall sec.2 .",
    "the cdw sliding is arrested at the boundaries by conversion of particles between the condensate and the normal states which job is made by phase slips .",
    "the rate is governed by difference of chemical potentials of the two reservoirs ( notice the discrepancy between black and brown lines in plots of the fig.[fig : x - plots ] ) .",
    "we expect that each impulse of the phase slip will reduce the conditions to the bare ones and the development similar to the above modeling will repeat itself sequentially .",
    "it seems that emergence of depinning waves in our modeling may be of an significant insight to other , more conventional experimental situations on sliding cdws .",
    "in the bulk of sliding cdws , the normal @xmath197 and the collective @xmath198 currents flow in the same direction while regulating their participation ratio depending on the geometry and the background @xcite . a curious question may be posed : if the partial currents can flow to opposite directions ? even more , if they can be compensated to a limit when the total current is zero ?",
    "it happens to be possible indeed in new circumstances when the on - chain currents are driven by the hall voltage in a geometry with the closed circuit in a narrow @xmath4 direction of the hall bar , as described in this article and most probably already seen in the experiment @xcite .",
    "actually , the old experiments @xcite on sliding under the temperature gradient alone should also be understood as the case of compensating currents .",
    "the picture of counter - currents ( the collective and the normal ones ) closing the loop by annihilating at the hall bar boundaries looks rather fantastic and even suspicious as a _",
    "perpetuum mobile_. still it is feasible , as well forgotten fundamentals of the conventional hall effect in semiconductors @xcite can tell us . in this old science",
    "there is a silently supposed and well forgotten feature of processes with more than one kind of carriers : presence of partial hall currents for electrons and holes ; the currents are compensated so that only the total one is zero . there , the currents of electrons and holes should be compared with the normal and the collective currents of the cdw . in both cases",
    "the equilibration among the carriers is hindered : by necessity of the energy relaxation across the gap in semiconductors or of making phase slips in the cdw .",
    "the cdw has a drastic influence already in the stationary regime , before the onset of sliding .",
    "recall the theory @xcite of inhomogeneous iqhe near gates boundaries in semiconductors . in those cases",
    "the stripe structure of electronic density appeared in response to the built - in electrostatic field spread from the gate boundary which is present already at @xmath199 . in our case , the inhomogeneous distribution of concentration of electrons is caused internally by the hall voltage .",
    "any spread density profile deviating from the background charge of donors and the gate would be prohibited in a 2d electron gas in semiconductors because of the very high cost of coulomb energy . in our case ,",
    "the deformations of the cdw background allows to reduce the field by the gigantic dielectric constant @xmath76 .",
    "the redistribution of charge caused by the hall voltage alone , up to segregation into the overcharged fully filed iqh segment and the undercharged fully depleted one , is unthinkable in usual circumstance of the qhe .",
