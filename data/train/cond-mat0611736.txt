    "investigations of a wide class of complex hamiltonians show a coexistence of ordered and more disconnected chaotic dynamic regions in their phase space in a semiclassical limit @xcite .",
    "respective parameters , fractions of the regular and chaotic regions of the phase space were used for the evaluation of statistical characteristics of the related quantum spectra .",
    "namely , explicit formulae for the nearest - neighbour level spacing distributions @xcite and the averaged level number variances or the @xmath5 statistics @xcite were illustrated by a model of two coupled quartic oscillators .",
    "the level repulsion at small level spacings was shown to be reduced by the fractionating of the chaotic region which substantially complicated related numerical calculations ( level spacing distributions ) .",
    "discrepancies between the numerical data and the analytical formulae for the above mentioned short - range and also the middle and long - range fluctuation statistics were ascribed especially to quantum effects like the tunnelling between regular regions through chaotic barriers and the quantum interference effects .",
    "finally , the chaos - assisted tunneling approach to the calculation of the level repulsion implied the correct behaviour of the level spacing distributions in the limit of small level separations @xcite . this kind of tunnelling was shown to be connected with the fractal dimension of a two - dimensional phase space due to a hierarchical phase space structure of a chaotic system @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we try to show that one of the systems which exhibit fluctuation properties typical for a transition region between order and chaos with varying ( nonuniversal ) degree of nonintegrability is the @xmath1 jahn - teller ( jt ) model .",
    "the model is represented by two degenerate electron levels coupled to two phonon ( vibron ) modes via two different interaction strengths .",
    "unitary diagonalization of the hamiltonian in the electron space transforms the system onto two highly nonlinearly coupled quantum oscillators in two dimensions .    in a recent paper @xcite",
    ", we have initiated the study of the statistical evidence of quantum chaotic patterns emerging in this model .",
    "we have shown that the ( short - range ) statistics of the nearest - neighbour level spacings ( nns ) in the range of interaction parameters apart from the particular symmetry cases ( e@xmath6e jt and exciton model ) is nonuniversal and tends to a well - defined limit close to the semi - poisson law @xmath7 .",
    "this intermediate statistics between the poisson ( uncorrelated levels ) and the wigner - dyson distribution of a correlated fully chaotic level system was found within the frame of random matrix theory as a critical distribution in the metal - insulator transition region in the anderson model of disorder @xcite as well as in several models with not fully developed chaotic dynamics by bogomolny @xcite .",
    "namely , the semi - poisson distribution of the level spacings in the plasma model was ascribed to the screening ( restriction to a finite number of nearest neighbours ) of the logarithmic pair interaction potential .",
    "statistical methods for energy levels and eigenfunctions of disordered systems were reviewed by several authors @xcite .    in section 2 , we shall concentrate on the complementary item of the long - range statistics for the excited spectra of the @xmath8 jt model with broken rotation symmetry .",

    "the use of the @xmath17-statistics instead of the level number fluctuations @xmath21 is justified by the fact that its variance is suppressed when compared to that of @xmath22 @xcite .    the random matrix theory ( rmt )",
    "predicts the scaling of this measure as @xmath23 ( or @xmath24 ) for the domain of fully developed chaos , meanwhile for the completely uncorrelated sequences of levels a linear scaling @xmath25 is expected @xcite .    for the poisson ensemble of an uncorrelated sequence of levels one",

    "the number variance @xmath28 was calculated for a set of ensembles within rmt supposed to model the behaviour of anderson type systems @xcite .",
    "its asymptotic form was shown to be similar to the uncorrelated case but with the coefficient ( level compressibility ) @xmath29 , @xmath30 for large @xmath2 .",

    "the interest for such a generalization has various sources , in particular : ( a ) different coupling constants are likely to be caused by a spatial anisotropy in a crystal plane ; ( b ) two vibron modes need not have necessary the same frequencies . in this case",
    ", the hamiltonian can be appropriately rescaled to the present model with equal frequencies but different coupling strengths ( in what follows we set @xmath77 ) ; and , last but not least , ( c ) the generalized jt system with broken rotational symmetry presents more rich variety of generic chaotic properties than its simpler prototype . as it was shown @xcite it stands closer to the generic models of quantum chaotic behaviour .    in the following we use the vibron eigenfunctions of the transformed hamiltonian @xmath78 @xcite @xmath79",
    "exactly diagonalized in the electron subspace by the fulton - gouterman ( fg ) unitary operator @xmath80 where @xmath81 is the vibron reflection operator imposing high nonlinearity in the system and the parity @xmath82 .",
    "it is easy to see that in the fg representation the parities @xmath82 are exactly mirror images of each other and can be mapped one onto another by a mere change of the sign in the definition of the phonon-2 displacements ( @xmath83 ) , thus the system remains doubly degenerated and the parity does not have any impact on the properties of the spectrum ; in what follows we choose @xmath84 .    in the representation of radial coordinates in the plane @xmath85 , @xmath86 the transformed hamiltonian",

    "let us note the apparent fractal nature of the space distribution of the state amplitude .",
    "but the system itself is not invariant with respect to this interchange .",
    "for example , the ground state is essentially different in the domains of heavy ( @xmath92 ) and light ( @xmath93 ) polarons @xcite .",
    "however , in the fock state representation the components of the corresponding wave vectors differ up to the sign change which does not affect the fractal properties of wavefunctions in the spectral representation and , hence , the symmetry of exposed results with respect to the said transformation . ] .",
    "the hamiltonian ( [ ham ] ) commutes with the operator of the angular momentum @xmath94 if @xmath74 .",
    "thus , the eigenfunctions of the symmetric model can be chosen each to pertain to a state with a good quantum number @xmath95 @xcite .     for @xmath96 , @xmath97 and @xmath98 .",
    "]    the last term in ( [ ham ] ) breaks the rotational symmetry and involves interactions of the basis states with different @xmath99 .",
    "hence , a wavefunction of the full hamiltonian is now distributed over a range of values of the angular momentum ( figure [ fig:2 ] ) .",
    "an analogy to the two - dimensional anderson model of disorder can be traced if the base functions with definite @xmath99 are considered as pseudosites over which the wavefunction is spread .",
    "similarly as in the anderson model , the properties of the model are determined by the relative strengths of the intersite ( different @xmath99 ) and the onsite interactions .",
    "the microscopic reason for this analogy is the assistance of phonons-2 in transitions between the levels ( [ ham ] ) which allows for the emerging of the pseudolattice . to our opinion , it is just these transitions with changing symmetry ( @xmath88 ) which ensured the similarity of the results for nns distribution @xcite to the anderson model close to the m - i transition ( marginal in two - dimensions ) .",
    "traces of quantum chaos cause the sequence of these coefficients to be distributed in a random fashion with varying @xmath36 thus supporting the analogy to the anderson model with _ a priori _ given random coefficients .",
    "-space for @xmath100 .",
    "evidently , the states exhibit different extent of localization . ]    calculating the angular part of the matrix elements of the symmetry breaking term in ( [ ham ] ) between the states of harmonic oscillator the selection rules can be obtained which assert that the element with definite @xmath99 is directly connected to the elements with @xmath101 ( cf.especially figure 2 with @xmath102 where only every odd ` pseudosite ' @xmath99 is populated ) .",
    "this reminds us of an analogy with the ` daisy models ' of random matrix ensembles @xcite with dropping every second term which were shown to lead directly to the semi - poisson distribution of nns .",
    "the natural length of our pseudolattice ( for a given interval of energy ) is thus the maximal number of allowed values of angular momentum for a given n ( level number ) , that is @xmath103 ( a state with main quantum number @xmath104 of a two - dimensional harmonic oscillator is @xmath105 times degenerated with auxiliary quantum number ranging between @xmath15 and @xmath106 , hence @xmath107 ) .",
    "thus , the analogy to the anderson type models with m - i transition whose intrinsic characteristics is the length @xmath52 of a system appears now more pronounced .    in order to calculate the long - range averaged characteristics of the energy spectra of ( [ h ] ) we numerically diagonalized the hamiltonian matrix in the representation of the base fock states of the vibrons @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "taking @xmath108 and @xmath109 base fock states for each vibron we introduced an appropriate ordering of sites @xcite so that a state vector turned to be a vector with @xmath110 elements .",
    "numerical determination of high energy states produces an inevitable error because of truncating the base space . varying the numbers of the base states we investigated the convergence of the results . for practical purposes we limited ourselves by the base size @xmath111 from whence about 1100 - 1200 states appeared to be trusty ( giving the convergence up to 0.1@xmath112(characteristic level spacing ) ) .",
    "this number of energy levels was used in the following calculations .",
    "thus , the obtained spectrum needs to be unfolded in order to ensure its homogeneity ( that is normalized so that the local averaged level spacing is unity ) . to do",
    "so it is necessary to fit the staircase @xmath12 ( or the corresponding level density @xmath113 ) by a reasonably chosen smooth function .",
    "different choices of the latter are possible .",
    "the calculations below used the unfolding by fitting the level density by a third - order spline polynomial ( after smoothing the data via gaussian smoothing with the smoothing constant @xmath114 ) in the domain of interest , that is for level numbers @xmath115 . in this interval",
    "the level density of our two - vibron system grows almost linearly with the energy ( we note by passing that this behaviour is in a qualitative accordance with the semiclassical weyl formula giving generically a linear growth of the level density for a two - vibron system ) , so that such fitting turns to be more than satisfactory .",
    "we performed sample calculations with an increasing order of polynomials , and using other algorithms of producing the smoothed level density @xmath116 as well ( in particular , varying the parameters of the gaussian smoothing and using the smoothing via moving average / median ) ; the results appeared indistinguishable within statistical errors .    in order to compile a statistical ensemble out of the ( deterministic ) quantum problem one has to perform averaging of the numerical quantities of interest over different parts of the spectrum taken as members of this ensemble .",
    "we included into the statistical analysis the energy intervals centered at different starting values ranging between 100 - 1100 levels which corresponded to the energy values between @xmath117 and @xmath118 and between @xmath119 and @xmath120 depending on the values of ( @xmath121 ) .",
    "however , as it follows from the results below , the ensemble averaged properties can show a bias ( sensitivity to the starting point in the energy range ) , therefore this procedure must be followed with maximal care . to improve the statistics we also followed the standard procedure of collecting statistical data from small intervals in the space of parameters @xmath122 . to be exact , for a given point of interest @xmath123 we collected the energy values from the square @xmath124 in the parameter space with the step @xmath125 .",
    "( the exception of this rule was collecting the data for the points where @xmath126 .",
    "there , this restriction was followed for choosing the neighboring parameters for the sampling ) . from figure 4",
    "it follows that indeed the averaged statistical data present a slight bias when taking different energy intervals .",
    "therefore we presented the results in figure [ fig:4 ] separately in two energy bins for lower ( 100 - 600 ) and higher ( 600 - 1100 ) levels .",
    "it is worth noting that the nonsymmetric parameter values ( @xmath61 ) appear to present more robust statistics with respect to the energy interval than the symmetric ones ( @xmath74 ) .",
    "the same conclusion was already drawn from the investigation of the short - range statistics @xcite where we showed that the spectral properties of the nonsymmetric jt models were more homogeneous with respect to the choice of the energy interval .",
    "taking smaller energy bins than those of figure 4 however did not change much the appearance of the corresponding figures .",

    "it is seen that the spectral rigidity shows up serious deviations from the poisson behaviour as well as from the logarithmic dependence expected in the frame of rmt . for large @xmath127",
    "it supposedly tends to a saturation , and a characteristic linear domain is evident for small @xmath2 ( up to @xmath131 ) .",
    "( level compressibilities ) of the long - range statistical measure for different model parameters @xmath132 for different parts of the spectra .",
    "the grid lines indicate the poisson line ( 1/15 ) and the marginal semi - poisson limit ( @xmath133 ) .",
    "the dispersion of the probability distributions pertaining to the displayed mean values is @xmath134 .",
    "the pictures show a strong dependence on the position of the fragment within the spectra . ]    in figures [ fig:4 ] and [ fig:5 ] , we plot the level compressibilities ( slopes @xmath135 of the @xmath136 curves ) for a range of parameters @xmath137 .",
    "the slopes in figures [ fig:4]a , [ fig:4]b were calculated from averaging over 500 levels in the ranges 100 - 600 and 600 - 1100 , respectively .",
    "taking lower levels would bring us below the diabatic line where the system feels only one potential well of the effective potential ( see @xcite for a detailed discussion ) .",
    "it is seen from figure 4 that results for different intervals of energy show differences , but , nevertheless , similar tendencies . apart from the cases close to the special symmetries ( @xmath74 and @xmath138 , @xmath139 ) the slopes show a markable accumulation close to the value @xmath140 ( the horizontal grid line at 0.033 ) indicating the semi - poisson limit .",
    "this limit is more pronounced at higher levels ( interval 600 - 1100 ) , where even the points corresponding to the symmetric cases @xmath74 are close to this line . for lower energy interval ( levels 100 - 600 ) this universality is seen less , although all @xmath17 curves points are far from both poisson and rmt limits . for lower energies",
    "there is also a more pronounced difference between symmetric and nonsymmetric models : meanwhile the nonsymmetric values of parameters still tend to the semi - poisson limit , the symmetric points however show essential deviation from this limit towards the poisson case .    in figure [ fig:3 ] ,",
    "the @xmath136 curves for @xmath141 for @xmath96 ( scaled by @xmath77 ) averaged over the whole relevant extent of the spectra ( up to the level @xmath142 ) are situated very close one to another , i.e. they are getting close to a limit with the minimal slope .",
    "averaged over the relevant extent of the spectra .",
    "large deviation of the points @xmath143 , @xmath144 from the suggested marginal line is explained by their relative proximity to the symmetric point @xmath145 . ]",
    "the said marginality also emerged in the statistics of nns @xcite .",
    "we have shown that the dispersions @xmath146 of nns distributions in the range of parameters far from the mentioned special symmetry cases tend to a limit @xmath147 characteristic for the m - i transition of the anderson model .",
    "it is interesting to discuss the mapping between the exposed results and the semiclassical description of the same system .",
    "the search for the quantum chaotic patterns historically meant looking for quantum correspondence to the chaotic behaviour of the classical trajectories .",
    "first of all it is to be noted that the passage to the ( semi)classical description in a two- or many - level electron - phonon system can be performed in several fashions . the most straightforward `` semiclassical '' description of the quantum jt problem is obtained if we pass to the real bloch variables made of pseudospin pauli matrices :    @xmath148    and perform the appropriate decoupling of the oscillatory ( phonon ) and electron variables in the initial hamiltonian ( [ h : init ] ) within the framework of the born - oppenheimer approximation : @xmath149 etc .",
    "another way of passing to the semiclassical description follows from the form of the hamiltonian ( [ h ] ) where the electron degrees of freedom are exactly eliminated at the cost of the strongly nonlinear coupling of the phonon degrees of freedom .",
    "the semiclassical decoupling then means the decoupling of the vibrons 1 and 2 .",
    "the classical equations of motions in this variant are implied by the following classical hamiltonian as a function of the coordinates @xmath150 and respective momenta @xmath151 :    @xmath152 + \\alpha \\gamma_1 \\mp \\beta\\gamma_2 \\exp\\left(-2(\\gamma_1 ^ 2+\\pi_1 ^ 2)\\right ) \\label{h : clas}\\ ] ]    the trivial linear stability analysis shows that the stationary point @xmath153 is unstable unless @xmath154 , @xmath138 or unless the parameters ( @xmath121 ) are located in the small domain near the point @xmath155 .",
    "the crucial characteristics of interest is however the chaoticity of the phase space , in particular , its fraction @xmath33 occupied by the chaotic trajectories .",
    "the formulae which relate this quantity to the parameters of the statistics of quantum levels for both short- and long - range statistics are widely known @xcite .",
    "we investigated the chaoticity of the trajectories implied by the hamiltonian ( [ h : clas ] ) and performed rough estimations of the chaoticity parameter @xmath33 for different energies .",
    "we studied the sensitivity of the classical equations of motion to the initial conditions checking whether two initially neighboring trajectories diverge in the course of time ( that is studying the lyapunov index @xcite ) .",
    "the fraction of the chaotic trajectories at given energy @xmath13 was then estimated by taking at random the initial points respecting @xmath156 .",
    "the detailed quantitative presentation of this work is to be given elsewhere ; for the sake of the present contribution we just mention the results briefly .",
    "the classical phase space in the energy range corresponding to the energies of quantum levels used ( that is up to @xmath157 ) appears to be pronouncedly chaotic .",
    "the fraction of chaotic levels increases rapidly with the increase of energy and reaches its maximum @xmath158 for the energies typically @xmath159 which roughly corresponds to the lower energy bin of figure [ fig:4 ] ( levels 100 - 600 ) . with further increasing energy",
    "the value of @xmath33 then slowly decreases .",
    "its estimations for @xmath13 between 20 - 30 range from @xmath114 to @xmath160 strongly depending on the parameters @xmath161 and @xmath162 .",
    "this latter energy interval approximately corresponds to the higher energy bin of figure [ fig:4]b .",
    "we note once again the more pronounced universality of the quantum characteristics at the upper bin ( figure [ fig:4]b ) which appears to correspond to the moderate values of the degree of the classical chaoticity .",
    "the quantitative conclusions for this item is however a challenge for a separate study .    in any case , the above results confirm the nonuniversal degree of the classical nonintegrability demonstrated by the dependence of the chaoticity parameter @xmath33 on the model parameters @xmath163 and @xmath162 and on the location of the energy segment in the spectra .",
    "moreover , the linear dependence of the spectral rigidities in certain parts of the spectra implies a strong suppression of the level repulsions because of the presence of regions with various degree of chaoticity and related chaos - assisted tunneling between the regions of small degree of chaoticity .",
    "analogous nonuniversal behaviour of the level compressibilities presented in figure [ fig:4 ] indicates a cumulation of most of their values in the chaotic region @xmath164 close to the semi - poisson values @xmath165 depending on the spectral segment where the chaoticity parameter is correspondingly reduced .",
    "an independent quantitative analysis of the properties of the e@xmath166 excited spectra can be obtained by exploring the scaling of the inverse participation ratio ( [ d ] ) and ( [ ipr ] ) in the spectral representation of fock states and following calculation of related fractal dimensions . in figure 6 , we give the samples of the scaling of @xmath167 ( from equation ( [ ipr ] ) ) for several successive states as functions of the box size @xmath168 ( @xmath169 ) comprising @xmath51 fock states . the linear slope in the log - log coordinates stretches up to the box sizes 8@xmath1128 which indicates the existence of a well determined quantity @xmath170 for each level , although the generalized fractal dimensions show slight level - to - level fluctuations .     as a function of the box size @xmath168 in the box - counting algorithm as the illustration of the reliability of the scaling ( [ ipr ] ) for our model .",

    "the only relation @xmath195 derived by kravtsov and lerner @xcite was the first bridge between the fractal dimension @xmath170 and the long - range level statistics .",
    "however , it is proven to be valid only for small values of compressibility and does not fit to our calculations .",
    "we have also revealed the corresponding nonuniversal and inhomogeneous behaviour of the chaoticity parameter - the fraction of the chaotic phase space of the classical trajectories .",
    "the detailed analysis of this parameter in the whole phase space would be very useful for further considerations of phenomena especially related to the mixing @xcite of the phase space between the regions of different degrees of chaoticity .",
    "the presence of the mixing phenomena is supported by the multifractal behaviour of the wavefunctions . because of the nonexistence of the extended states in our model we can conclude on the concept of the chaos - assisted tunnelling between the domains with reduced stochasticity through those with high degree of stochasticity .    besides the anderson model close to the metal - insulator transition @xcite another models sharing the universal semi - poisson statistics are known - in particular , the bogomolny @xcite plasma model with screened coulomb interactions and the daisy models @xcite .",
