    "quantum walks are the quantum mechanical analogs of random walks in classical systems , and like their classical counterparts they have provided a useful framework for the construction of efficient quantum algorithms  @xcite .",
    "in addition to the development of quantum walk approaches to known quantum algorithms such as the grover search  @xcite , triangle finding  @xcite , and element distinctness  @xcite , several quantum algorithms were obtained using quantum walks that were previously not found within the standard quantum circuit or adversary models , such as the traversal of glued - tree graphs with randomness  @xcite , and the solution of nand trees  @xcite , min - max trees  @xcite , and general boolean functions  @xcite .",
    "more recently it has been shown that quantum walks are able to perform arbitrary quantum computational tasks  @xcite .    in the continuous - time approach to universal",
    "quantum walks  @xcite , computational basis states are represented by long linear graphs ( tails ) which support plane wave modes characterized by momentum eigenstates .",
    "a single quantum walker is initialized in a momentum eigenstate of a single semi - infinite line out of @xmath4 such tails representing @xmath5 qubits .",
    "quantum operations on the encoded information are carried out by interspersing the tails with small graphs .",
    "the scattering of the plane waves off these graphs mixes the amplitudes on different tails and adds possible phase shifts .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , a small number of such graphs were identified that could generate a universal set of @xmath5-qubit unitary gates for a fixed momentum @xmath6 ( all length units are suppressed for convenience ) .",
    "the two graphs needed for single - qubit operations are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : childsgraphs ] .",
    "the first of these , depicted in fig .",
    "[ subfig : childsgraphs - phaseshift ] , is a disconnected seven - vertex graph that yields the unitary @xmath7 neglecting unimportant overall phases ( @xmath8 denotes a rotation about axis @xmath9 by an angle @xmath10 , and @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 are the pauli matrices ) .",
    "the upper subgraph is a two - site graph , so with the tails encoding the @xmath14 and @xmath15 attached it has the effect of changing the length of the full tail by one lattice spacing . for plane waves of the form @xmath16 , this corresponds to a scattering phase shift of @xmath17 on the @xmath18 state .",
    "the lower subgraph , attached to the @xmath19 input and output tails on the same vertex , produces no scattering phase shift and one thus obtains the desired rotation .",
    "this subgraph furthermore has the desirable property of also having an _ effective length _ of one lattice spacing , so that the registers @xmath19 and @xmath18 maintain their spatial coherence after the scattering event . under this scheme",
    "the various paths through a graph be of equal length , and there must be an identity gate with the same effective length for a given momentum to act on all registers where no gate is desired .",
    "this identity requirement is trivial to satisfy in the case of graphs with integral effective lengths , but as we show below graphs can have lengths that are non - integral , or even irrational .    the second graph , shown in fig .",
    "[ subfig : childsgraphs - basischanger ] , is a connected graph that yields @xmath20 , again neglecting unimportant overall phases .",
    "the hadamard gate can be constructed via @xmath21 , and combinations of @xmath22 and @xmath23 can produce any single - qubit unitary at fixed accuracy  @xcite . while these two graphs are sufficient to generate a universal set of single - qubit gates , and a universal set of gates when an entangling gate is included  @xcite , it is not clear if there are other graphs that could be chosen instead .",
    "an immediate question is : are there other graph combinations that work equally well for @xmath6 , or for other values of the momentum ? because the number of non - isomorphic graphs grows exponentially in the number of vertices @xmath1 , one might expect a plethora of choices which would be useful in the design of quantum algorithms based on quantum walks .",
    "yet it is also conceivable that larger graphs will simply reproduce the unitaries found for smaller graphs , or that as @xmath1 increases the requirement that there be perfect transmission from each of the input tails to the combination of the two outputs , with equal effective lengths on all four paths , will become increasingly difficult to satisfy .    in the present work , we explore these issues numerically by calculating the single - qubit unitary operators resulting from two input tails scattering to two output tails , off every possible graph with up to nine vertices",
    ". momentum eigenstates @xmath24 where @xmath25 and @xmath26 for integer @xmath27 are considered ; we study only positive values of @xmath28 for two reasons .",
    "mathematically there is a symmetry between positive and negative momenta such that negating @xmath28 conjugates the reflection and transmission coefficients ; physically if one considers propagating wavepackets with tightly peaked momenta instead of un - normalizable plane waves , the negative momenta result in the initial state traveling away from the scattering graph instead of toward it , under the definitions we use .",
    "note that in ref .",
    "@xcite the graphs of fig .",
    "[ fig : childsgraphs ] are utilized at momentum @xmath6 because the hamiltonian employed therein is equal to the adjacency matrix of the graph , rather than its negative .",
    "we find that the number of graphs meeting the requirements for implementing single - qubit rotations does indeed grow exponentially with @xmath1 .",
    "the most prolific momentum we investigate is @xmath29 , which results in a total of 98 unique unitary operations on graphs of nine or fewer vertices .",
    "there is a supplemental data file associated with this manuscript , available on the arxiv pre - print server @xcite , and our main focus here is the analysis of those data .",
    "this manuscript is organized as follows .",
    "the mathematical formalism underlying the scattering of plane waves by graphs is briefly reviewed in sec .",
    "[ sec : formalism ] , followed by a description of the numerical strategy to enumerate graphs .",
    "the results of the survey are given in sec .",
    "[ sec : results ] , and are summarized in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "the theory underpinning the scattering of plane waves by graphs has been discussed in detail by varbanov and brun  @xcite , so it will only be sketched here .",
    "one considers a finite graph @xmath30 with @xmath31 a set of @xmath1 vertices and @xmath32 a set of edges defined by the graph adjacency matrix @xmath33 .",
    "each vertex @xmath34 has attached to it @xmath35 semi - infinite tails ( @xmath35 may vanish for as many as @xmath36 of the vertices of @xmath37 ) , with the adjacency matrix of tail @xmath38 on vertex @xmath39 defined as @xmath40_{ij}=\\delta_{i , j+1 } + \\delta_{i+1,j}$ ] where @xmath41 .",
    "vertices on the tails are denoted @xmath42 , with the attachment vertex on the graph labeled @xmath43 where the index @xmath38 is kept only to match the tail labeling , i.e.  @xmath44 .",
    "the adjacency matrix associated with the connection of the tails to the graph is @xmath45 , and the total adjacency matrix for the scattering system as a whole is @xmath46 to describe single - qubit unitary transformations we are interested only in those cases with four tails  two input and two output  attached to @xmath37 .",
    "that is , we require @xmath47    for the moment though , suppose that the graph @xmath37 consists of a single point .",
    "in this case , two semi - infinite tails corresponding to the input and output states fuse into a single infinite line .",
    "the ( unnormalized ) eigenstates of the graph hamiltonian @xmath48 are plane waves @xmath49 with eigenvalue @xmath50 , where @xmath51 is the momentum quantum number .",
    "one can envisage the input as a wavepacket strongly peaked at momentum @xmath28 scattering off a single point , resulting in an identical output wavepacket .",
    "now consider an arbitrary number of tails connected to an arbitrary finite graph @xmath37 , again defined by adjacency matrix @xmath52 and corresponding hamiltonian @xmath53.one again assumes that the input and output states are plane - wave eigenstates of their respective semi - infinite lines , with eigenvalue @xmath54 ; that is , the scattering has not changed the value of @xmath28 , equivalent to the conservation of momentum and energy . in principle",
    "the graph could mix momenta on different input and output tails ; this possibility is not included in the analysis , because it would imply that the quantum information encoded in the wavepackets would travel down the tail at different rates .",
    "consider a momentum eigenstate @xmath55 with incoming component only on tail @xmath38 of vertex @xmath39 , and possible outgoing components on every attached tail including the incoming one .",
    "this leads to transmission and reflection coefficients , @xmath56 and @xmath57 respectively , defined by the expressions @xmath58 the first and second terms in eq .",
    "( [ eq : definer ] ) represent the incoming and reflected component of the state respectively .",
    "the term on the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eq : definet ] ) represents the component of the incoming state that is transmitted to the other tails ( for which @xmath59 or @xmath60 ) .",
    "these are eqs .",
    "( 4 ) and ( 5 ) of varbanov and brun  @xcite .",
    "the momentum eigenstates @xmath61 can be expressed in terms of their components on the graph vertices @xmath62 and the tails : @xmath63 where the prime on the second sum indicates that all possible values of @xmath64 and @xmath65 for which @xmath59 or @xmath60 are being summed over . enforcing the condition that @xmath66 and simplifying",
    ", one obtains that @xmath67 must satisfy @xmath68 this is eq .",
    "( 10 ) of varbanov and brun  @xcite .",
    "the solution to the scattering problem consists of determining the vector @xmath62 and from it obtaining the reflection and transmission coefficients . because the reflection and transmission coefficients at the attachment points must be the same as on the tails , eqs .",
    "( [ eq : definer ] ) and ( [ eq : definet ] ) can be expressed more conveniently in terms of @xmath67 and the graph vertex states as @xmath69    in order to interpret the scattering event as implementing a single - qubit operation , one assumes that the finite graph @xmath37 has four semi - infinite tails attached .",
    "two of the tails are considered as inputs and two as outputs .",
    "a continuous - time quantum walker in a wavepacket state with momentum tightly peaked about @xmath28 propagates toward @xmath37 along the two input tails .",
    "it scatters from an initial superposition supported on these tails to a superposition with support on the two output tails . any relative phase shift or change in probability amplitude between the two tails corresponds to a unitary transformation of the input computational state .",
    "in general , a momentum eigenstate incoming on the first input , @xmath70 , can be thought of as mapping incoming to outgoing states according to    [ eq : generalscattering ] @xmath71 similarly , a momentum state with incoming component on the second input , @xmath72 , scatters to outgoing components as @xmath73    so in order for these scattering processes to correspond to a unitary operation mapping @xmath74 and @xmath75 to superpositions of @xmath76 and @xmath77 we must identify combinations of graphs @xmath37 ; tail attachment points @xmath78 , @xmath79 , @xmath80 , and @xmath81 ; and momenta @xmath28 such that there is neither reflection along either input tail nor transmission from one input tail to the other .",
    "that is , we require @xmath82 when the conditions eq .",
    "are met , the transformations eq .",
    "simplify to    @xmath83    i.e.  an arbitrary input vector @xmath84 is transformed by the operator : @xmath85 we must now show that this operator is unitary . to simplify notation ,",
    "let us label the two input tails by @xmath86 and @xmath87 , and the output tails by @xmath88 and @xmath89 .",
    "a general scattering process on a graph with four attached tails yields an s - matrix @xmath90 where @xmath91 corresponds to the state on tail @xmath92 , which varbanov and brun show is unitary @xcite .",
    "our restriction that we consider only graphs satisfying eq .   does not change the unitarity of @xmath93 in those cases , and corresponds to @xmath94 .",
    "we then assume an initial state with support only on the input tails , @xmath95 , with @xmath96 .",
    "the restricted s - matrix acts on such a state as @xmath97 but this is precisely the action of @xmath98 on @xmath84 under the identification @xmath99 with @xmath100 , @xmath101 , @xmath102 , and @xmath103 . since @xmath93 is unitary in general , it remains so when restricted to the cases of interest that define @xmath98 .",
    "the number of non - isomorphic simple graphs on @xmath1 vertices grows super - exponentially with @xmath1 , and for each graph the number of ways to attach four tails goes as @xmath104 . using the ` geng ` ( _ _ gen__erate _ _ g__raphs ) software package , part of the popular ` nauty ` ( _ _ n__o _ _ aut__omorphisms , _ _",
    "y__es ? ) suite of graph theoretic tools @xcite , we first generate the adjacency matrices @xmath33 of all non - isomorphic simple graphs on @xmath1 vertices for @xmath105 . for each graph",
    "we then enumerate the set of all combinations of attachment points for four tails , each of which defines a set @xmath106 satisfying eq .  .",
    "one can see by symmetry arguments that the one - vertex graph with four tails attached can not transmit from one of the tails to only two of the remaining three , so at least two vertices are required to implement a computational unitary gate . with two or more vertices available ,",
    "it is trivial to implement the identity gate and the @xmath107 or @xmath11 gate by constructing a graph with two isolated vertices and attaching an input and an output tail to each one , as exemplified in fig .",
    "[ subfig : trivialiandx ] . if the computational labels ( i.e.  @xmath19 and @xmath18 ) agree on each vertex then an identity is performed ; otherwise the @xmath11 gate is applied .",
    "the first unitaries that can not be trivially produced in this manner appear when there are five vertices .",
    "an example of such a graph can be found in fig .",
    "[ subfig : nontrivialon5 ] .",
    "+    for each momentum value @xmath28 under consideration , for each adjacency matrix @xmath33 and attachment set @xmath108 , eq .   produces a set of @xmath1 linear equations to be solved for the coefficients of @xmath67 .",
    "these in turn yield the reflection and transmission coefficients from eqs .   and .",
    "due to the large number of such combinations of @xmath28 , @xmath108 , and @xmath33 ( of order @xmath109 under the chosen constraints ) , we solve these equations numerically using the gnu scientific library @xcite and lapack @xcite software libraries . if a particular combination results in reflection and transmission coefficients satisfying eq .   then there is zero transmission from the input tail to one of the three possible output tails . in this case , we solve the equations again with the incoming portion of the momentum eigenstate instead on this unused tail . if the conditions are again satisfied , with the same two tails supporting the output , then the current combination implements a unitary transformation @xmath110 defined by the operator .",
    "the final step is to determine the effective length through the graph from each input to each output .",
    "if paths of different length exist , then a quantum walker initially in a superposition of one wavepacket on either input tail would acquire a spatial shift between the two output wavepackets after traversing the graph . the effective length to output @xmath111 from input @xmath92",
    "is defined as @xcite @xmath112 this can be understood when one considers the case of a single input attached to one end of a linear graph of @xmath113 segments , with a single output tail at the other end .",
    "clearly the transmission from one end to the other has unit magnitude at all momenta , and the phase difference between the ends results in a transmission coefficient of @xmath114 .",
    "equation then yields @xmath115 , as expected .",
    "we calculate this derivative numerically on each candidate graph , using a nine - point stencil , and require that the four values @xmath116 agree whenever @xmath117 .",
    "our goal is to determine any potential computational advantage to increasing the number of vertices in @xmath37 , so we record the current system only if @xmath110 meets all of the stated criteria and has not been found at the same momentum and effective length on a smaller graph .",
    "if it has been previously found , we keep track of how many times it has appeared .",
    "the number of non - isomorphic simple graphs on @xmath1 vertices , @xmath118 , does not have a simple closed - form solution .",
    "nevertheless , the counts are well documented for many values of @xmath1 ( see , for example , ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) , and the total number of such graphs on nine or fewer vertices is @xmath119 . for each graph on @xmath1 vertices ,",
    "the number of distinct ways to attach @xmath28 tails is @xmath120 and we have chosen to investigate scattering at nine different momenta with four attached tails .",
    "this results in @xmath121 combinations of momenta , attachment points , and graphs to be numerically examined . of these",
    ", it turns out that @xmath122 have the properties required to implement a computational gate .",
    "figure [ fig : countvsn ] shows that the number of unitary and non - identity operations both increase super - exponentially in the number of vertices , following the growth of the total number of graphs , and that this is true at each momentum investigated .",
    "+    there is significant redundancy within these gates however , where many different graphs yield the same unitary for a given value of the momentum and effective length .",

    "there are @xmath129 graphs which do not have commensurate identity graphs , leaving @xmath130 candidates for inclusion in computational sets .",
    "there is further redundancy among these graphs , since two graphs performing the same operation with different effective lengths at the same momentum are for our purposes equivalent if each has a corresponding identity operation .",
