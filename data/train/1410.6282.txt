    "the qcd sum rules ( sr ) approach suggested in @xcite for description of the static properties of mesons and later employed for nucleons @xcite is based on the dispersion relation for the function describing the propagation of the system which carries the quantum numbers of the hadron . in the case of the proton this function , usually referred to as the `` polarization operator '' ,",
    "can be written as @xmath2 with @xmath3 the four - momentum of the system , @xmath4 , @xmath5 is the unit matrix .",
    "the dispersion relations @xmath6 are considered at @xmath7 .",
    "this enables to expand the left hand sides ( lhs ) of eq .",
    "( [ 2 ] ) in powers of @xmath8 .",
    "the coefficients of the expansion are the qcd condensates.this is known as the operator product expansion ( ope ) @xcite .",
    "this provides the perturbative expansion of the short distance effects , while the nonperturbative physics is contained in the condensates .",
    "the higher terms of the ope contain the condensates of the higher dimension .    the left hand side of eq .",
    "( [ 2 ] ) can be written as @xmath9 where the lower index @xmath10 is the dimension of the corresponding qcd condensate .",
    "the lowest order ope contribution to the structure @xmath11 is the quark loops , and does not contain condensates .",
    "we denote it as @xmath12 . the lowest order ope contribution to the structure",
    "@xmath13 is proportional to the scalar quark condensate @xmath14 , which has dimension @xmath0 .",
    "this contribution contains a quark loop .",
    "next comes the term with the gluon condensate @xmath15 with dimension @xmath1 , also containing the quark loops .",
    "the ope terms of the higher dimension do not contain loops .",
    "the loops provide the logarithmic terms @xmath16 on the left hand side , while the contributions with @xmath17 provide the power corrections @xmath18 .",
    "the physical spectrum of polarization operator contains the single - particle states @xmath19 , etc . and the many - particle states , e.g. protons and pions .",
    "the former manifest themselves as the poles of the integrand on the right hand side ( rhs ) of eq .",
    "( [ 2 ] ) while the latter correspond to its cuts .",
    "both the logarithmic terms and the power corrections on the lhs contribute to the terms originated by the poles and the cuts on the rhs .",
    "the rhs of eq .",
    "( [ 2 ] ) is usually approximated by the `` pole+continuum '' model @xcite in which the lowest lying pole is written down exactly , while the higher states are described by continuum .",
    "the spectral function on the cut corresponding to continuum is approximated by discontinuity of the logarithmic terms on the lhs . under the latest assumption eqs .",
    "( [ 2 ] ) take the form @xmath20 here @xmath21 ,  @xmath22 .",
    "the upper index ope means that several lowest ope terms are included .",
    "one usually applies the borel transform [ 1 - 3 ] to both sides of eq .",
    "( [ 2 ] ) , which converts the functions of @xmath23 to the functions of the borel mass @xmath24 .",
    "an important assumption is that there is an interval of the values of @xmath24 where the two sides of the sr have a good overlap , approximating also the true functions .",
    "the standard interval ( `` duality interval '' ) is @xmath25 gev@xmath26 gev@xmath27 .",
    "the proton mass @xmath28 , the residue at the nucleon pole @xmath29 and the continuum threshold @xmath30 are the unknowns of the qcd sr equations .",
    "the set of parameters @xmath31 which minimize the function @xmath32 with @xmath33 and @xmath34 the borel transforms of the rhs and lhs of eq.([3 ] ) correspondingly is referred to as the solution of the qcd sum rules equations . here",
    "@xmath35 is a set of @xmath36 points in the duality interval .",
    "we put @xmath37 .    the `` pole + continuum '' model for the spectrum makes sense only if the contribution of the proton pole ( treated exactly ) to the rhs of eq .",
    "( [ 3 ] ) exceeds that of the continuum ( treated approximately ) .",
    "we treat a solution which satisfy this condition as the physical one .",
    "otherwise we call it an unphysical solution @xcite .    in order to obtain the value of @xmath28 close to the physical value @xmath38 mev",
    "one should include the ope terms up to those with @xmath39 .",
    "if only the loop terms @xmath12 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 are included on the lhs of eq .",
    "( [ 3 ] ) ( `` loop approximation '' ) , we immediately find a trivial solution @xmath42 , @xmath43 , in which the logarithmic terms on the lhs correspond to the second term on the rhs of eq.([3 ] ) .",
    "this solution exists for any value of the nucleon mass @xmath28 .",
    "there was a general believe that this is the only solution in the loop approximation .",
    "this was viewed as one of the week points of the `` pole+continuum '' model and of the qcd sr approach as a whole @xcite .    here",
    "we demonstrate that limiting ourselves to the terms with @xmath44 and even with @xmath45 we have also another solution , which can be treated as a good lowest order approximation to the solution with @xmath46 .",
    "keeping only the terms which contain the logarithmic loops we find @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "the explicit form of the contributions depends on the form of the local operator @xmath49 with the proton quantum numbers , often referred to as  current \" .",
    "the form of @xmath49 is not unique , and we assume @xmath50 , suggested in @xcite .",
    "one can find @xcite , @xcite @xmath51 with @xmath52 the ultraviolet cutoff , @xmath53 , while @xmath54 and @xmath55 are the scalar quark condensate and the gluon condensates multiplied by certain numerical factors @xmath56 the factors @xmath57 include the radiative corrections .",
    "following @xcite we consider several cases .",
    "the radiative corrections are neglected , in this case @xmath58 .",

    "the lla terms and the nonlogarithmic corrections of the order @xmath60 are taken into account .",
    "all radiative corrections are included in the lowest order of @xmath60 .",
    "the lla terms are expressed in terms of the function @xmath61 in eq .",
    "( [ 4a ] ) @xmath62 is the qcd scale , while @xmath63 is the normalization point , the standard choice is @xmath64gev . in the case",
    "ii we have @xmath65 , while @xmath66 . in the case",
    "iii @xcite , @xcite @xmath67 with @xmath68gev@xmath69 . in the case",
    "iv the value of @xmath70 changes to @xmath71 while @xmath72 remains the same as in the case ii .",
    "since the contribution of the term @xmath41 is numerically small , we do not include the nonlogarithmic corrections here , keeping @xmath73 for the cases ii and iii .",
    "actually the standard procedure is to consider the sr for the operators @xmath74 .",
    "the factor @xmath75 is introduced in order to deal with the values of the order of unity ( in gev units ) .    finally the sr equations in the loop approximation , except the case iv can be written as @xmath76 and @xmath77 with @xmath78 , while @xmath79 if all radiative corrections are neglected ( i ) , @xmath58 . in the lla ( ii )",
    "@xmath80 , while @xmath66 . in these cases eq .",
    "( [ 22 ] ) and eq.([22a ] ) are just the lowest terms of the standard nucleon sum rules [ 2,3 ] . adding the nonlogarithmic corrections of the order @xmath60 to the lla terms we obtain ( iii ) @xmath81 for the case when all corrections of the order @xmath60 are treated perturbatively ( iv ) , the first term on the lhs of eq .  ( [ 22 ] ) takes a more complicated form .",
    "it should be modified as @xcite @xmath82-\\frac{\\alpha_s}{\\pi } \\big[m^4w^2(1+\\frac{3}{4}\\gamma)e^{-\\gamma}+m^6{\\cal e}(-\\gamma)\\big ] , \\label{25}\\ ] ] with @xmath83 .",
    "now we try to find the values of @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 which minimize the difference between the lhs and rhs of eqs .",
    "( [ 22 ] ) and ( [ 22a ] ) .",
    "we employ the value @xmath84 mev .",
    "thus in the radiative corrections @xmath85gev@xmath86 .",
    "we vary the value of the scalar condensate around the point @xmath87mev@xmath88 , corresponding to @xmath89 gev@xmath90 we present also the results for @xmath91 gev@xmath90 corresponding to @xmath92mev@xmath88 and for @xmath93 gev@xmath90 corresponding to @xmath94mev@xmath88 .",
    "they are shown in table i for the case when only the terms @xmath12 and @xmath40 are included , and in table ii , where the contribution @xmath41 is added .",
    "here we employ the numerical value @xmath95 gev@xmath96 .",
    "since the contribution of @xmath41 is numerically small , we do not vary the value of @xmath55 .",
    "we see that the nucleon mass becomes closer to the physical value when we include the condensate with dimension @xmath1 .",
    "it also becomes closer to the physical value while we include the radiative corrections .",
    "the accuracy of the solution for the case when radiative corrections are included perturbatively is illustrated by fig .  1 .    in .",
    "2@xmath54-@xmath97 we show dependence of the parameters @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 on the actual value of the scalar condensate for the same case with the largest dimension of the condensates involved @xmath98 and @xmath99 @xcite .",
    "the qcd sum rules provide a solution with observed value of the nucleon mass if the terms with the dimension up to @xmath39 are included @xcite @xmath100 now we study the influence of the terms with @xmath17 by `` smooth switching on '' their contribution to the sum rules . to do this we construct the operators @xmath101 tracing dependence on the solutions on @xmath102 .",
    "the results are shown in fig .  3",
    "one can see that our solution converts smoothly to a physical one at @xmath103 .",
    "the solution with @xmath104 , @xmath43 turns to the unphysical one .",
    "the latter was studied in details in @xcite .",
    "taking into account only the condensates of the lowest dimension @xmath0 or @xmath105 one immediately finds a trivial exact solution @xmath42 , @xmath43 for the nucleon qcd sum rules in framework of the `` pole+continuum '' model for the spectrum of the polarization operator . for a long time",
    "there was a general believe that this is the only solution if the condensates with @xmath106 are included .",
    "we find a nontrivial solution for the qcd sum rules equations in this case . assuming that @xmath107 we find a set of values @xmath108 and @xmath30 , which minimize the function @xmath109 defined by eq.([3x ] ) . it can be treated as the lowest order approximation to the ope solution .",
    "this is important since the condensates of the lowest dimension @xmath14 and @xmath15 can be either calculated or related in terms of observables , while the condensates with larger dimensions are known with bigger uncertainties .",
    "the convergence of the ope series is illustrated by fig .",
    "2 . in fig .",
    "3 we show how the trivial solution turns to an unphysical one during the smooth switching on of the condensates of higher dimension . in the same figure",
    "we show how our solution turns to the physical one .",
