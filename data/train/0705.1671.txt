    "atomic magnetometers , developed since 1960 s @xcite , have today a central role in the field of high sensitive magnetometry with important applications in geophysics , medicine , biology , testing of materials and of fundamental physics symmetries .",
    "technical advances reached in the last years , will make optical magnetometers more suitable than squids in most of these applications because of the comparable - in some cases , even better @xcite - sensitivity and the possibility to operate at room temperature with no need of cryogenic cooling .",
    "recently a direct measure of geophysical - scale field , with the impressive sensitivity of @xmath2 was demonstrated in a non - linear magneto - optical rotation experiment @xcite .",
    "detection of weak biological - scale magnetic fields ( magneto - cardiometry ) has been demonstrated using optically pumped magnetometers @xcite based on the ` double optical - rf excitation ' .",
    "direct rf magnetic excitation , anyway , does not permit the realization of fully optical sensors as rf coils have to be placed next to the vapor cell .",
    "all - optical sensors based on coherent population trapping ( cpt ) effect can be instead built .",
    "cpt effect occurs when two long - lived ground states are coupled to a common excited state by two coherent laser fields .",
    "when the frequency difference of the laser fields exactly matches the frequency separation of two not coupled ground levels , the population is trapped in the so called ` dark ' state .",
    "this is a quantum - mechanical superposition of both ground states that is not coupled to the laser fields .",
    "an accumulation of population in such coherent state gives rise to a resonant transparency @xcite .",
    "cpt resonances have line - widths much narrower than the natural line - width of the corresponding optical transitions .",
    "this makes them particularly suitable for precision spectroscopy applications in many other fields besides magnetometry @xcite like metrology @xcite , detection of gravitational waves @xcite , laser physics @xcite and laser cooling@xcite .    in this work we present the characteristics of an all - optical magnetometer , working as a compact , automated device able to measure magnetic fields in wide range of amplitudes and time - scales , for example the daily earth magnetic field variations or weak signals varying in the msec time - scales , superposed on the earth magnetic field .",
    "the sensor works in the magnetically polluted environmental conditions typical of a scientific laboratory .",
    "neither additional rf magnetic field excitation nor particular magnetic field shielding are necessary .",
    "the principle of operation of our cpt magnetometer can be described as follows .",
    "couples of laser fields , such that their frequency separation matches the energy splitting between the zeeman sub - levels of a given hyperfine ground state of cs , are produced by frequency modulation of the diode laser junction current in the @xmath3  khz  -  @xmath3  mhz range .",
    "the obtained frequency modulated radiation is characterized by a very high modulation index ( @xmath4 @xmath5 ) and the spectral structure of the laser can be seen as a comb of coherent modes with an overall width of the order of the doppler broadened optical transition .",
    "with such a broad band excitation almost all the atomic velocity classes interact with resonant light and furthermore the power absorbed by each single class is very low .",
    "the first feature allows us to increase the resonance contrast , the second one reduces the power broadening .",
    "it is worth noting that this solution allows us to work without complex laser phase locking systems and , furthermore , without expensive and bulky highly stable microwave oscillators that are , instead , necessary in the case of cpt generation on zeeman sub - levels of different hyperfine ground states@xcite .",
    "a sketch of the experimental setup is presented in fig.[setup ] .",
    "the sensor measures the resonant absorption of laser light by cs vapor contained in a cylindrical cell 2.5  cm in diameter and 1  cm in length .",
    "the cell is kept at room temperature and contains 2  torr of @xmath6 as a buffer gas .",
    "@xmath6 minimizes the multiple , incoherent re - absorption thanks to the quenching of the resonant fluorescence .",
    "the laser radiation is tuned to excite the hyperfine transitions between the ground state with total angular momentum @xmath7 and the excited @xmath8 states with @xmath9 .    , width=264 ]    the laser is a single - mode edge - emitting pigtail laser ( @xmath10= 852  nm ) with 100  mw of laser power and an intrinsic line - width of less than 5  mhz .",
    "optical feedback is avoided by means of 40  db optical isolator and the laser light is coupled into a 10  m long single - mode polarization - maintaining fiber .",
    "the laser head containing the laser chip , the optical isolator and the fiber collimator is closed in a butterfly housing of only @xmath11 .",
    "the beam coming from the fiber is collimated and its polarization is transformed from linear to circular using a quarter - wave plate . in order to increase the light - atom interaction time the beam waist is expanded to 4.3  mm and the laser intensity used for atom excitation is reduced to @xmath12 using a set of neutral filters . the transmitted laser light is detected and analyzed .",
    "cpt resonance is created when two different zeeman sublevels are coherently coupled to a third common zeeman sublevel . the three - level system involved is called @xmath13 system in the case the third common coupled level is the highest in energy , @xmath14 system in the case it is lowest . in our case a number of @xmath13 and @xmath14 systems are created with circularly polarized light preserving the selection rules and .",
    "chains of @xmath13 systems are formed on the @xmath15 group of transitions , while chains of v systems are formed on the @xmath16 .",
    "the magnetic field under measurement breaks the zeeman degeneracy and makes adjacent ( @xmath17 ) sublevels separated by @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the planck constant , @xmath20 is the bohr magneton , @xmath21 is the land factor of the considered ground - state , @xmath22 is the larmor frequency and @xmath23 is the magnetic field strength . in fig.[levels ] , as example , is represented the schematics of @xmath13-system chains formation for the @xmath24 system of transitions .    -system chains for the @xmath25 system .",
    "the quantization axis is parallel to the magnetic field and perpendicular to the laser beam .",
    "circular polarization is decomposed in two in - quadrature linearly polarized waves , one of which is in turn decomposed in two counter rotating fields circularly polarized around the quantization axis .",
    "the complete scheme would involve also the hyperfine components @xmath26 . in the table",
    "are reported the gyromagnetic factors @xmath27 for all the hyperfine levels of interest .",
    "[ levels],width=264 ]    the rf signal used to produce couples of suitably separated frequency components in the spectral profile of the laser emission is swept in a small interval around the resonant value @xmath22 .",
    "a set of data acquired along the frequency sweep allows for visualizing the cpt resonance profile .    as the magnetic field strengths of interest range from few @xmath28 t to few mt , the modulation frequency @xmath29 ranges from few tens of khz to few mhz .",
    "the @xmath29 is generated by a waveform generator ( agilent 33250a 80-mhz function generator ) that is coupled to the laser by means of a passive circuit specially designed to make the response of the laser rather flat in the frequency range of interest .",
    "the circuit uses capacitors to ac couple the rf to the laser junction , and resistors of rather large value ( several hundreds ohm ) to convert the voltage to current at the output of the generator .",
    "a pair of inductive elements , oriented so that possible spurious magnetic pick - up is canceled , are connected in series with the dc supply in order to prevent the modulating signal from being significantly counteracted by the laser current driver . as an overall",
    ", this coupling allows for achieving very large modulation indexes .",
    "the envelope of the unresolved frequency components of the resulting comb of laser frequencies can be observed using a fabry - perot spectrometer ( see fig.[pigtail_sp ] ) .",
    ".,width=264 ]    in order to increase the s / n of the detected transmitted light , a phase sensitive detection ( psd ) is performed .",
    "the @xmath29 is thus frequency - modulated at @xmath30 and the atomic response in phase with a reference signal at @xmath30 is extracted .",
    "laser electric field can be expressed by : @xmath31\\}+c.c.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath32 and @xmath33 are the usual unitary vectors perpendicular to the laser wave - vector , @xmath34 is the optical frequency , @xmath35 accounts for the laser linewidth invoking for instance the celebrated phase - diffusion model , @xmath36 is the modulation index of the rf modulation and @xmath30 is the psd modulation frequency with its modulation index @xmath37 .",
    "one typical fm spectrum of the cpt profile is presented in fig.[fm_sp ] where @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "the central feature is used for magnetic field determination .",
    ".,width=264 ]    an improvement in the noise rejection and hence in the sensitivity can be achieved using a differential sensor .",
    "such arrangement is very appropriate when a registration of very weak magnetic fields is desired @xcite . in this case ,",
    "two identical sensors are assembled in parallel , at a distance of 11  cm .",
    "the light is coupled to the second arm of the sensor using an intensity beam splitter ( see fig.[setup ] ) . when evaluating the efficiency of the differential setup in rejecting the noise , we distinguish three kinds of noise contribution .",
    "the first is due to the detection and amplification stages .",
    "this contribution , which is generally smaller than the others is increased ( nominally by a factor @xmath40 ) .",
    "the second kind is due to intensity fluctuations of the laser emission ( rather small in our case ) and to frequency noise of its optical frequency , in turn discriminated by the doppler profile .",
    "this kind of noise is effectively rejected . as a third kind",
    "one can consider the noise due to magnetic field fluctuations generated by magnetic sources different from the one under examination ( e.g. consider the case of earth magnetic field fluctuation while measuring weak biological fields generated by close sources ) . in this case , provided that both the cs cells are in conditions of cpt resonance , the differential sensor responds to the ( usually very small ) gradients of the field generated by far - located sources ( while their common mode field is canceled ) and to the field generated by sources ( if any ) located very close to one of the two cells . in this sense depending on the application ,",
    "the differential setup can be used either as a gradiometer or as detector of field variations produced by close sources placed in magnetically polluted environment .",
    "the components of both arms of the differential sensor , _",
    "i.e. _ the fiber collimator , quarter - wave plates , beam expanders , neutral filters , cs - n@xmath41 cells and the pds ( we use large area , low noise , non - magnetic photo diodes ) including a reference cs - vacuum cell are assembled in a separate plate and can be placed away from the instrumentation .",
    "all used materials are highly non - magnetic so that the sensor does not perturb the magnetic field to be measured . in the condition of our laboratory an improvement of the signal to noise ratio ( s / n ) of a factor of 5 was obtained .",
    "the magnetic field measurement operatively consists in the determination of the central frequency @xmath42 of the resonance profile ( 2@xmath43 is the estimate of @xmath22 ) .",
    "the registered cpt profile , read at the output of the lock - in , reproduces the first derivative of the cpt ( reduced absorption ) resonance .",
    "one typical cpt profile is presented in fig.[cpt_profile ] .",
    "the error bars are evaluated by the lock - in amplifier from the standard deviation of the output signal in steady conditions .",
    "routinely , the noise measurement is done only once - after setting the lock - in operation parameters , because it is a time consuming operation , and can not be performed at each step .    .",
    "the lock - in time constant is 30  ms with 12  db / oct output filter which determines the detection bandwidth of 4.16  hz . the linewidth resulting from the fit procedure is @xmath44  =  700  hz .",
    "[ cpt_profile].,width=264 ]    the central frequency and the linewidth of the resonance are estimated by means of a best fit procedure . the fitting function is the first derivative of a lorentzian profile with central frequency @xmath42 and fwhm @xmath44 .",
    "it allows for achieving an excellent agreement of fit with the data detected in the experimental conditions described above , provided that the rf scan is performed in a narrow range around the @xmath42 .",
    "discrepancies appear for wider ranges of scan . in this condition we found that adding a secondary small , odd function with the same center as the principal derived lorentzian , removes the discrepancy in the wings , making the fit result insensitive to the position of the center of the resonance with respect to the center of the scan .",
    "we used another ( smaller and broader ) lorentzian derivative , to take into account such slower decays in the wings .",
    "the uncertainty on the resonant frequency evaluated by the fit procedure , converted in magnetic field units , is consistent with the following estimation : @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the noise level at the output of the lock - in , @xmath47 is the measuring time ( it depends on both the time - constant and the slope of the output filter in the lock - in ) , @xmath48 is the slope of the cpt curve and @xmath27 is the atomic gyromagnetic factor .",
    "the noise level @xmath46 can be estimated , as written above , by direct measurement from the lock - in amplifier , while the resonance central slope is simply related to the ratio between the amplitude and the fwhm of the signal . in typical working conditions ,",
    "@xmath46 amounts to about 3 times the photo - current shot - noise level , and is mainly due to fast laser frequency fluctuations ( the measured noise decreases to the expected shot - noise level provided that the optical frequency is tuned out of resonance ) , while the fwhm line - width is about 700  hz .",
    "the cpt parameters , 1/@xmath27 factor in our configuration and the noise pattern of our registration system , including the magnetic noise in the laboratory , set the ultimate sensitivity of the sensor to 260  pt/@xmath49 according to eq .",
    "[ deltab_min ] .",
    "this sensitivity limit is far above the very ultimate theoretical limit of the sensitivity , which considering only contribution of the light - atom interaction volume and cs - cs spin exchange collisional rate is 8  @xmath50 @xcite .    in general , in order to improve the sensitivity limit versus the theoretical one , one has to reduce the resonance line - width @xmath44 , to increase the signal - to - noise ratio and to work in a highly shielded room .",
    "the main cpt resonance broadening mechanism , in our case , is the limited light - atom interaction time and contributes to the total linewidth by an amount of the order of 600  hz .",
    "unshielded environmental conditions and , in particular , magnetic field gradients and ac magnetic fields , also contribute to the cpt line broadening .",
    "the maximum magnetic field gradient is estimated to be in the range of @xmath51 , leading to , worst case , a broadening contribution of the order of 280  hz .",
    "ac magnetic fields contribute , instead , mainly with the 50  hz and its harmonics spectral components , with an overall intensity of 40  nt , determining a corresponding broadening of about 140  hz .",
    "smaller broadening contributions are furthermore given by the light shift and the non - linear zeeman effect @xcite .",
    "the experimental procedure is totally controlled by a dedicated labview program .",
    "the program is used to synchronously communicate with the lock - in amplifier and the rf wave generator so that the cpt response can be recorded in appropriate and reproducible conditions .",
    "the cpt profile is registered by querying the lock - in output after having set the rf and having waited the settling time . alternatively ,",
    "as described below , the program performs numerically psd , using large data sets produced by a 16 bit adc card .",
    "the program also contains routines devoted to an on - line analysis of the collected data .",
    "in particular , after that each rf scan is completed , a minimum @xmath52 fit procedure is launched to determine the parameters of cpt resonance profile .",
    "when performing numerical psd , in contrast with what reported in section [ cpt profile and noise ] , the noise level is evaluated at each @xmath29 step . in both cases ,",
    "we obtain rather good values for the minimized @xmath52/dof ( degrees of freedom ) , demonstrating the reliability of the noise estimation and the suitability of the fitting procedure .",
    "the external lock - in amplifier ( bulky and expensive ) can be replaced by a compact adc card .",
    "we successfully tested and used a system based on a commercial 16 bit , 50  ks / s card usb interfaced to the pc and sets to operate at 40  ks / s .",
    "the principle of operation was slightly changed with respect to the one of the lock - in amplifier .",
    "specifically , the rf is externally frequency modulated at 20  khz using a square wave signal obtained by scaling by two the frequency of a clock signal generated by the adc card .",
    "consequently , the adc data array @xmath53 corresponds to high and low values of the rf , accumulated in the even ( @xmath54 ) and odd ( @xmath55 ) elements , respectively .",
    "the psd signal and its uncertainty are then obtained by considering the @xmath56-size array of differences @xmath57 and evaluating the average @xmath58 and the standard deviation @xmath59^{1/2}$ ] scaled by @xmath60 , respectively .",
    "the number @xmath61 of the acquired data is chosen accordingly to the desired integration time of the psd system , and its upper limit is set by the size of the data buffer in the adc card ( 64  kb  /  2  bytes  =  32767 readings which corresponds to 0.8  sec integration time ) .",
    "it is worth noting that the relatively large amount of data to be transferred makes the choice of usb 1.0 devices not very advantageous , because it introduces a relevant dead - time at each measurement .",
    "multi - frequency diode laser comb excitation is suitable for producing narrow and high contrast cpt signals in free - running lasing conditions .",
    "the optical frequency stabilization by the laser current and temperature controllers provides the needed short - term stability .",
    "such passive stabilization method works well over time intervals of the order of 1  min , but over longer time - scales slow drifts of both temperature and current make it unsuitable .",
    "for this reason a long - term active stabilization system must be employed , allowing for relatively rough ( accurate within some mhz ) but reliable re - adjustments of the optical frequency .",
    "we adopted a simple method based on a commercial usb adc - dac card with 12 bit resolution , which periodically and automatically ( e.g. once per minute ) performs a scan all over the doppler profile , numerically determines center and width of the absorption curve , and finally provides a dc signal , which , sent to the modulation input of the laser current driver , establishes detuning with respect to the maximum of the absorption profile , in terms of the measured linewidth . in spite of the low cost and simplicity , such sub - system was demonstrated to be very effective and reliable for long - term compensation of the optical frequency drifts .",
    "furthermore it made the whole system comfortable to be operated during the optimization as well as suitable for applicative long - lasting use .",
    "additionally , we note that such approach , at the expense of periodically suspending the cpt measurement for a few seconds , does not need any additional laser modulation ( which would have effect on the cpt measurement ) or external modulation elements ( such as electro optical modulators ) , which would make the set - up much more complex and expensive .",
    "we have quantified the root mean square fluctuations @xmath62 of the optical frequency , i.e. the center of the broadband laser spectrum used for cpt creation , observing the apparent fluctuation of the fitted doppler maximum position when scanning the laser current in the same range of nominal values over the doppler absorption . from the observed rms variation of the fitted maximum we get @xmath63 over time scales of the order of 1  sec .      when a higher rate in the magnetic field measurements is required the time needed to perform rf scan in order to determine the center of the cpt resonance",
    "can be avoided performing single readings of the lock - in output .",
    "this fast operation uses the central , essentially linear , slope of the cpt resonance ( the lorentzian derivative profile ) resulting from the fit , to convert the lock - in output voltage in frequency units and hence in field units .",
    "initially , one complete @xmath29 scan is accomplished , the fitting procedure runs , and , provided that the @xmath52 /dof is reasonably close to unity , the best - fit parameters are passed to the routine devoted to evaluate the field from single readings of the lock - in and to keep @xmath29 locked to the resonance center .",
    "the fit procedure gives the values of both the slope @xmath64 and the offset @xmath65 at the center of resonance @xmath42 .",
    "when the single reading procedure starts working , @xmath29 is set at @xmath42 , and the lock - in output @xmath14 is queried .",
    "the deviation @xmath66 is used in a linear approximation to obtain a new estimate of the central frequency @xmath67 and hence of the field . at each step , @xmath29 is updated to the new estimated @xmath42 in order to keep the system working at the center of the cpt resonance , with the double aim of maintaining the linear estimation appropriate , and preventing possible large drifts of the field from bringing the system out of the cpt resonance .",
    "the lock - in time - constant can be selected with different values for the scan and the single - reading operations . obviously , to obtain a comparable noise rejection in single - reading operation",
    "it is necessary to increase the time - constant .",
    "the lock - in settling time derived from the time - constant and the lock - in output filter slope is taken into account in the lock operation in order to update @xmath29 with a rate @xmath68 allowing for locking the system at the actual center of resonance with the maximum speed , but without risks of oscillations .",
    "@xmath29 is actually updated at the rate @xmath69 of the readings ( this value is limited by the rs232 communications , and generally exceeds @xmath68 ) consequently , the @xmath29 increment is scaled by a factor @xmath70 .    the evaluated magnetic field is immediately saved on disk , possibly simultaneously with other reference signals ( for instance , in the perspective of applications in magneto - cardiography , ecg signals will be saved as a reference , in view of offline analysis to be performed over long - lasting acquisitions ) .",
    "the dependence of the amplitude of the cpt resonance as a function of the laser optical detuning is shown in fig.[cpt_ampl_ls]a , where the cpt amplitude , the doppler broadened fluorescence line and the frequency position of the hyperfine transitions are reported .",
    "the cpt resonance amplitude shows a two - lobe structure that reflects the bridge - shaped spectral intensity profile shown in fig.[pigtail_sp ] , with the two maxima separated nearly by the same amount ( about 600  mhz ) .",
    "the reason for the vanishing resonance at intermediate detunings lies in the opposite phase of the beating at @xmath29 of the fm laser spectrum .",
    "actually , each couple of adjacent sidebands in the laser spectrum , with their amplitudes @xmath71 , @xmath72 , which produce a beating signal at @xmath29 , contains one odd and one even bessel function so that , due to the fact that @xmath73 the beat phases is opposite for the couple ( m ,  m+1 ) and ( -m ,  -(m+1 ) ) respectively , i.e. for the couples belonging to the right and left wings of the bridge . from this point of view , depending on the optical detuning , a synchronous excitation @xcite of different velocity classes of atoms is performed , having a unique phase in the case where one side only of the bridge is in resonance with the doppler profile , and two opposite phases when the bridge center coincides ( about ) with the doppler center .",
    "a deeper analysis puts in evidence that the two lobes in fig.[cpt_ampl_ls]a are different in amplitude , with higher values on the blue side .",
    "this is related to the dominance of the @xmath74 and @xmath75 transitions on the blue wing of the doppler line . on the other hand ,",
    "the cpt resonance vanishes when the laser is tuned in the vicinity of the @xmath76 transition , and the maxima of the two lobes are symmetric with respect to such detuning , accordingly with the fact that this latter , closed transition gives the most relevant contribution to the cpt .",
    "besides the evident variation of the resonance amplitude discussed above , changing the optical detuning determines also a variation both in the resonance linewidth ( fig .",
    "[ cpt_ampl_ls ] b ) and in the resonance center frequency .",
    "the linewidth dependence on optical frequency affects mainly the sensitivity of the instrument according with eq .",
    "[ deltab_min ] .",
    "the shift of the cpt resonance center versus optical detuning , also called light - shift or ac stark effect , is due to the finite dephasing rate among ground states involved in the cpt preparation ( see [ @xcite ] ) .",
    "this effect represents an essential systematic error in the determination of the cpt resonance center and then affects both the accuracy and the sensitivity of the magnetometer .",
    "the cpt center frequency shift rate versus optical detuning is presented in fig.[cpt_ls ] for laser intensity of 36  .    , width=264 ]    the optimal optical detuning , in view of best magnetometer operation , is around 400  mhz red detuning , where the light - shift rate passes through a minimum value and the cpt resonance has lower linewidth .",
    "the magnetometer performance was checked by registration of the earth magnetic field variation in time .",
    "a record of few hours continuous magnetic field registration with our magnetometer @xcite is shown in fig.[long_run ] together with the corresponding data of the laquila geomagnetic station @xcite .    , width=264 ]    both the procedures , when fitting the cpt resonance for determination of its center and using fast acquisition , were considered and investigated . in the first one ,",
    "the whole cpt profile is registered and fitted as described above . in this case",
    "the measuring time , limited by the time necessary for cpt profile registration together with the subsequent data analysis , is of the order of 8  sec .",
    "such procedure does not make possible to register fast magnetic field variations and in this respect can find application in geophysics , archaeology , material science , etc .",
    "a trace of the earth magnetic field variation obtained in fast operation is shown in fig.[lockrun_zoom ] . in this case",
    "the acquisition rate was increased by a factor of 40 ( 210  ms per reading ) .     ,",
