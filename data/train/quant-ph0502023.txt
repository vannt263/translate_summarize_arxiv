    "the microscopic limit of the applicability of thermodynamics is still poorly understood @xcite . down",
    "to which length scales can its standard concepts meaningfully be defined and employed ?",
    "however , despite its fundamental relevance this topic has only received little attention for a long time @xcite .",
    "the situation drastically changed in recent years , since the issue became highly relevant for experiments .",
    "significant progress in the synthesis and processing of materials with structures on nanometer length scales has created a demand for better understanding of thermal properties of nanoscale devices , individual nanostructures and nanostructured materials @xcite .",
    "experimental techniques have improved to such an extent that the measurement of thermodynamic quantities like temperature with a spatial resolution on the nanometer scale seems within reach @xcite .    to provide a basis for the interpretation of present day and future experiments in nanoscale physics and technology and to obtain a better understanding of the limits of thermodynamics , it is thus indispensable to clarify the applicability of thermodynamical concepts on small length scales starting from the most fundamental theory at hand , i. e. quantum mechanics .",
    "here we focus on the question whether temperature can be meaningfully defined on those small length scales .",
    "the existence of thermodynamical quantities @xcite , i. e. the existence of the thermodynamic limit strongly depends on the correlations between the considered parts of a system .",
    "hence , local temperature is only expected to exist in systems with short range interactions , where the interaction between a region in space and its surrounding only takes place at the surface of that region .",
    "being only a surface effect , correlations between the region and the surrounding thus become less important as the size of the region increases , since the energy contained in the region grows with its volume ( diameter@xmath5 ) while correlations only grow with the surface ( diameter@xmath6 ) @xcite .",
    "this scaling of interactions between parts of a system @xcite thus sets a minimal length scale on which correlations are still small enough to permit the definition of local temperatures . in this paper",
    "we study this connection quantitatively .",
    "we adopt here the convention that a local temperature exists if the considered part of the system is in a canonical state , where the distribution is an exponentially decaying function of energy characterized by one single parameter .",
    "this implies that there is a one - to - one mapping between temperature and the expectation values of observables , by which temperature is usually measured .",
    "temperature measurements based on different observables will thus yield the same result , contrary to distributions with several parameters @xcite .",
    "in large systems composed of very many subsystems , the density of states is a strongly growing function of energy @xcite .",
    "if the distribution were not exponentially decaying , the product of the density of states times the distribution would not have a pronounced peak and thus physical quantities like energy would not have `` sharp '' values .",
    "based on the above arguments and noting that a quantum description becomes imperative at nanoscopic scales , the following approach appears to be reasonable : consider a large homogeneous quantum system , brought into a thermal state via interaction with its environment , divide this system into subgroups and analyze for what subgroup - size the concept of temperature is still applicable .",
    "harmonic lattice models are a standard tool for the description of thermal properties of solids .",
    "we therefore apply our theory to a harmonic chain model to get estimates that are expected to be relevant for real materials and might be tested by experiments .",
    "recently , spin chains have been subject of extensive studies in condensed matter physics and quantum information theory .",
    "thus correlations and possible local temperatures in spin chains are of interest , both from a theoretical and experimental point of view @xcite .",
    "we study spin chains with respect to our present purpose and compare their characteristics with the harmonic chain .",
    "we consider a homogeneous ( i.e. translation invariant ) chain of elementary quantum subsystems with nearest neighbor interactions .",
    "the hamiltonian of our system is thus of the form @xmath7 where the index @xmath8 labels the elementary subsystems .",
    "@xmath9 is the hamiltonian of subsystem @xmath8 and @xmath10 the interaction between subsystem @xmath8 and @xmath11 .",
    "we assume periodic boundary conditions .",
    "we now form @xmath12 groups of @xmath1 subsystems each ( index @xmath13 ) and split this hamiltonian into two parts , @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the sum of the hamiltonians of the isolated groups , @xmath16 and @xmath17 contains the interaction terms of each group with its neighbor group , @xmath18 the eigenstates of the hamiltonian @xmath15 are products of group eigenstates , @xmath19 where @xmath20 .",
    "@xmath21 is the energy of one subgroup only and @xmath22 .",
    "we assume that the total system is in a thermal state @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the partition sum and @xmath25 the inverse temperature with boltzmann s constant @xmath26 and temperature @xmath0 .",
    "we are interested in the matrix representation of the state ( [ candens ] ) in the product basis , the eigenbasis of @xmath15 .",
    "the diagonal elements are the expectation values of the density operator ( [ candens ] ) in the states @xmath27 , @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the energy of the ground state and @xmath30 the upper limit of the spectrum @xcite .",
    "@xmath31 is defined as follows : the state @xmath27 is not an eigenstate of the total hamiltonian @xmath32 .",
    "thus , if @xmath32 would be measured in the state @xmath27 , eigenvalues of @xmath32 would be obtained with certain probabilities : @xmath31 is the density of this probability distribution .",
    "since the hamiltonian @xmath32 is the sum of hamiltonians of the groups , the situation has some analogies to a sum of random variables .",
    "this indicates that there might exist a central limit theorem for the present quantum system , provided the number of groups becomes very large @xcite . since the state @xmath27 is not translation invariant and since @xmath32 also contains the group interactions , the central limit theorem has to be of a lyapunov ( or lindeberg ) type for mixing sequences @xcite .",
    "one can indeed show that such a quantum central limit theorem exists for the present model @xcite and that @xmath31 thus converges to a gaussian normal distribution in the limit of infinite number of groups @xmath12 , @xmath33 where the quantities @xmath34 and @xmath35 are defined by @xmath36 @xmath34 is the difference between the energy expectation value of the distribution @xmath31 and the energy @xmath37 , while @xmath38 is the variance of the energy @xmath39 for the distribution @xmath31 .",
    "note that @xmath34 has a classical counterpart while @xmath38 is purely quantum mechanical .",
    "it appears because the commutator @xmath40 $ ] is nonzero , and the distribution @xmath41 therefore has nonzero width .",
    "the two quantities @xmath34 and @xmath38 can also be expressed in terms of the interaction only ( see eq .",
    "( [ hsep ] ) ) , @xmath42 meaning that @xmath34 is the expectation value and @xmath38 the squared width of the interactions in the state @xmath27 .    the rigorous proof of equation ( [ gaussian_dist ] ) is given in @xcite and based on the following two assumptions : the energy of each group @xmath43 as defined in equation ( [ isogroups ] ) is bounded , i. e. @xmath44 for all normalized states @xmath45 and some constant @xmath46 , and @xmath47 for some constant @xmath48 .    in scenarios where the energy spectrum of each elementary subsystem has an upper limit , such as spins , condition ( [ bounded ] ) is met a priori .    for subsystems with an infinite energy spectrum , such as harmonic oscillators ,",
    "we restrict our analysis to states where the energy of every group , including the interactions with its neighbors , is bounded .",
    "thus , our considerations do not apply to product states @xmath27 , for which all the energy was located in only one group or only a small number of groups . since @xmath49 , the number of such states is vanishingly small compared to the number of all product states .",
    "if conditions ( [ bounded ] ) and ( [ vacuumfluc ] ) are met , equation ( [ newrho ] ) can be computed for @xmath49 @xcite : @xmath50 \\left[\\textrm{erfc } \\left ( \\frac{e_0 - \\overline{e}_a + \\beta \\delta_a^2}{\\sqrt{2 } \\ , \\delta_a }",
    "\\right ) - \\textrm{erfc } \\left ( \\frac{e_1 - \\overline{e}_a + \\beta \\delta_a^2}{\\sqrt{2 } \\ , \\delta_a } \\right ) \\right ] \\end{split}\\ ] ] where @xmath51 and @xmath52 is the conjugate gaussian error function @xcite .",
    "the second error function in ( [ newrho2 ] ) only appears if the energy is bounded and the integration extends from the energy of the ground state @xmath29 to the upper limit of the spectrum @xmath30 .",
    "note that @xmath53 is a sum of @xmath12 terms and that @xmath35 fulfills equation ( [ vacuumfluc ] ) .",
    "the arguments of the conjugate error functions thus grow proportional to @xmath54 or stronger .",
    "if these arguments divided by @xmath54 are finite ( different from zero ) , the asymptotic expansion of the error function @xcite may thus be used for @xmath55 : @xmath56 for @xmath57 and @xmath58 for @xmath59 . inserting this approximation into equation ( [ newrho2 ] ) and using @xmath60 shows that the second conjugate error function , which contains the upper limit of the energy spectrum , can always be neglected compared to the first , which contains the ground state energy .",
    "the off diagonal elements @xmath61 vanish for@xmath62 because the overlap of the two distributions of conditional probabilities becomes negligible .",
    "for @xmath63 , the transformation involves an integral over frequencies and thus these terms are significantly smaller than the entries on the diagonal .",
    "we now test under what conditions the density matrix @xmath64 may be approximated by a product of canonical density matrices with temperature @xmath65 for each subgroup @xmath66 . since the trace of a matrix is invariant under basis transformations , it is sufficient to verify the correct energy dependence of the product density matrix .",
    "if we assume periodic boundary conditions , all reduced density matrices are equal and their product is of the form @xmath67 .",
    "we thus have to verify whether the logarithm of rhs of equation ( [ newrho2 ] ) is a linear function of the energy @xmath37 , @xmath68 where @xmath65 and @xmath69 are constants .    applying the asymptotic expansion of the error function in equation ( [ newrho2 ] )",
    ", one realizes that equation ( [ log ] ) can only be true for @xmath70 and @xmath71 where @xmath72 and @xmath73 are arbitrary real constants .",
    "note that @xmath34 and @xmath38 need not be functions of @xmath37 and therefore in general can not be expanded in a taylor series .    to ensure that the density matrix of each subgroup @xmath74 is approximately canonical",
    ", one needs to satisfy ( [ cond_linear_1 ] ) for each subgroup @xmath74 separately ; @xmath75 where @xmath76 , @xmath77and @xmath78@xmath79 .",
    "temperature becomes intensive , if the constant @xmath72 vanishes , @xmath80 if this was not the case , temperature would not be intensive , although it might exist locally .    it is sufficient to satisfy conditions ( [ cond_const ] ) and ( [ cond_linear_2 ] ) for an adequate energy range @xmath81 only .",
    "the density of states of large many body systems is typically a rapidly growing function of energy @xcite .",
    "if the total system is in a thermal state , occupation probabilities decay exponentially with energy .",
    "the product of these two functions is thus sharply peaked at the expectation value of the energy @xmath82 of the total system @xmath83tr@xmath84 , with @xmath29 being the ground state energy .",
    "the energy range needs to be centered around this peak and large enough . on the other hand it must not be larger than the range of values",
    "@xmath21 can take on .",
    "therefore a pertinent and `` safe '' choice for @xmath85 and @xmath86 is @xmath87_{\\text{min } } \\ , , \\",
    ", \\frac{1}{\\alpha } \\frac{\\overline{e}}{n_g } + \\frac{e_0}{n_g } \\right)\\\\[0.4 cm ] e_{\\text{max } } & = & \\text{min } \\left ( \\left[e_{\\mu}\\right]_{\\text{max } } \\ , , \\ , \\alpha \\frac{\\overline{e}}{n_g } + \\frac{e_0}{n_g } \\right ) \\ , , \\end{array}\\ ] ] where @xmath88 and @xmath82 will in general depend on the global temperature . in equation ( [ e_range ] ) , @xmath89_{\\text{min}}$ ] and @xmath89_{\\text{max}}$ ] denote the minimal and maximal values @xmath21 can take on .    for a model obeying equations ( [ bounded ] ) and ( [ vacuumfluc ] ) , the two conditions ( [ cond_const ] ) and ( [ cond_linear_2 ] ) , which constitute the general result of this article , must both be satisfied .",
    "these fundamental criteria will now be applied to some concrete examples .",
    "we are now going to examine equations ( [ cond_const ] ) and ( [ cond_linear_2 ] ) for some special models .",
    "as discussed in the introduction , those terms in ( [ cond_const ] ) and ( [ cond_linear_2 ] ) , which contain the interactions between neighboring groups ( @xmath90 and @xmath91 ) are independent of the group size , while the `` background '' term @xmath21 grows approximately linear with the group size @xmath1 .",
    "hence , the interaction terms become less important compared to @xmath21 with increasing group size . therefore , taking into account the energy range ( [ e_range ] ) , conditions ( [ cond_const ] ) and ( [ cond_linear_2 ] ) can be used to determine a minimal group size @xmath2 .",
    "technical details of this calculation can be found in @xcite and @xcite .    for each model ,",
    "the results depend , besides the global temperature @xmath92 , on two `` accuracy '' parameters , @xmath93 and @xmath94 , which quantify the tolerated deviations from a canonical distribution .",
    "the first parameter , @xmath93 , has already been introduced in equation ( [ e_range ] ) .",
    "it is a measure for the energy range , where one demands ( [ cond_const ] ) and ( [ cond_linear_2 ] ) to be fulfilled .",
    "the second parameter , @xmath94 , is the ratio between the terms in the lhs of condition ( [ cond_linear_2 ] ) , which are linear in @xmath21 , and those , which are of higher order .",
    "thus @xmath95 means that all terms in the lhs of ( [ cond_linear_2 ] ) which are not linear in @xmath21 are at least two orders of magnitude smaller than the linear ones .      as a representative for the class of systems with an infinite energy spectrum , we consider a harmonic chain of @xmath96 particles of mass @xmath97 and spring constant @xmath98 . in this case , the hamiltonian reads @xmath99 where @xmath100 is the momentum of the particle at site @xmath8 and @xmath101 the displacement from its equilibrium position @xmath102 with @xmath103 being the distance between neighboring particles at equilibrium .",
    "we divide the chain into @xmath12 groups of @xmath1 particles each and thus get a partition of the type considered above . describing the groups in debye approximation",
    "( see @xcite for details ) we calculate the minimal group size @xmath2 .    here , we only present the results for the present model , which are shown in figure [ temp ]",
    ".    for high ( low ) temperatures @xmath2 can be estimated by @xmath104 where @xmath105 is the debye temperature , a characteristic constant of the respective material , which can be found tabulated @xcite .    as an extra result ,",
    "we get , that whenever local temperature exists , it is equal to the global one , i. e. temperature is intensive .      in this section",
    "we consider an ising spin chain in a transverse field .",
    "for this model the hamiltonian reads , @xmath106 where @xmath107 and @xmath108 are the pauli matrices .",
    "@xmath109 is the magnetic field and @xmath110 a coupling parameter .",
    "we will always assume @xmath111 .",
    "running through a similar calculation as for the harmonic chain , the details of which can be found in @xcite , we get the result shown in figure [ l=0 ] .    as for the harmonic chain",
    ", temperature is intensive whenever it exists locally , i.e. then local temperatures are equal to global ones .",
    "we have considered a linear chain of particles interacting with their nearest neighbors .",
    "we have partitioned the chain into identical groups of @xmath1 adjoining particles each . taking the number of such groups to be very large and assuming the total system to be in a thermal state with temperature @xmath0 we have found conditions ( equations ( [ cond_const ] ) and ( [ cond_linear_2 ] ) ) , which ensure that each group is approximately in a thermal state .",
    "furthermore , we have determined when the isolated groups have the same temperature @xmath0 , that is when temperature is intensive .",
    "the result shows that , in the quantum regime , these conditions depend on the temperature @xmath0 , contrary to the classical case .",
    "the characteristics of the temperature dependence are determined by the width @xmath35 of the distribution of the total energy eigenvalues in a product state , which in turn is related to the fact that the commutator @xmath40 $ ] is nonzero . in particular",
    ", the ground state of the total system does not factorize with respect to any partition @xcite .",
    "we have then applied the general method to a harmonic chain and an ising spin chain in a magnetic field . when applied to specific models , conditions ( [ cond_const ] ) and ( [ cond_linear_2 ] ) determine a minimal group size @xmath2 for which a local canonical state and hence local temperature can exist .",
    "we have given order of magnitude estimates of @xmath2 for these models .",
    "grains of a smaller size are no more in a thermal state and temperature measurements with a higher resolution should therefore no longer be interpreted in a standard way",
    ".    for the spin chain and the harmonic chain , the temperature dependencies of @xmath2 for low temperatures coincide , @xmath112 , because both couplings have the same structure and the upper limit of the spectrum of the spin chain becomes irrelevant at low temperatures .      for spins at very high global temperatures ,",
    "the total density matrix is almost completely mixed , i. e. proportional to the identity matrix , and thus does not change under basis transformations .",
    "there are thus global temperatures which are high enough , so that local temperatures exist even for single spins .    for the harmonic chain , this feature does not appear , since the size of the relevant energy range increases indefinitely with growing global temperature , leading to the constant minimal length scale in the high energy range .",
    "since harmonic lattice models in debye approximation have proven to be successful in modeling thermal properties of insulators ( e.g. heat capacity ) @xcite , our calculation for the harmonic chain provides a first estimate of the minimal length scale on which intensive temperatures exist in insulating solids , @xmath113 let us give some numerical estimates : choosing the `` accuracy parameters '' to be @xmath114 and @xmath95 , we get for hot iron ( @xmath115k , @xmath116 ) @xmath117 m , while for carbon ( @xmath118k , @xmath119 ) at room temperature ( @xmath120k ) @xmath121 m .",
    "the coarse - graining will experimentally be most relevant at very low temperatures , where @xmath122 may even become macroscopic .",
    "a pertinent example is silicon ( @xmath123k , @xmath124 ) , which has @xmath125 cm at @xmath126k ( again with @xmath114 and @xmath95 ) .        in the scenarios of global equilibrium , which we consider here ,",
    "a temperature measurement with a microscopic thermometer , locally in thermal contact with the large chain , would not reveal the non existence of local temperature .",
    "one can model such a measurement with a small system , representing the thermometer , coupled to a heat bath , representing the chain .",
    "it is a known result of such system bath models @xcite , that the system always relaxes to a thermal state with the global temperature of the bath , no matter how local the coupling might be .",
    "this , however , does not mean that the existence or non existence of local temperatures had no physical relevance : there are indeed physical properties , which are determined by the local states rather than the global ones .",
    "whether these properties are of thermal character depends on the existence of local temperatures .",
    "a detailed discussion of such properties will be given elsewhere @xcite .",
    "the length scales , calculated in this paper , should also constrain the way one can meaningfully define temperature profiles in non - equilibrium scenarios @xcite . here , temperature measurements with a microscopic thermometer , which is locally in thermal contact with the sample , might indeed be suitable to measure the local temperature . an explicit study of this possibility",
    "should be subject of future research ."
