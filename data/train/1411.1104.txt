    "superluminous supernovae ( slsne ) are a recently discovered class of stellar explosion with peak magnitudes of @xmath321mag ( for a review see * ? ? ?",
    "their hosts are predominantly low - luminosity blue compact dwarfs ( bcds ) first monitored by non - targeted wide - field surveys , so they went undetected until 2005 ( sn2005ap ; * ? ? ? * ) , although some events were later reclassified as slsne @xcite .",
    "slsne are divided into two classes : slsne type ii have hydrogen in their spectra and they often resemble type iin sne .",
    "their energy probably stems from interactions with the circumstellar medium or previously ejected h - rich material @xcite .",
    "type i are hydrogen - poor with late spectra similar to broad - lined type ic sne @xcite .",
    "their energy is emitted at large radii suggesting interactions with pre - explosion shells @xcite ( similar to what has been suggested for a gamma - ray burst in 2010 ; * ? ? ?",
    "alternatively , they could be powered by a magnetar ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) or they are pair - instability sne @xcite .",
    "the hosts of slsne are distinctively different than other sn hosts . only recently @xcite and @xcite published two studies of slsn host samples .",
    "they conclude that type i slsn hosts are consistently low - luminosity low - mass objects with low metallicities and high specific star - formation rates ( ssfrs ) while type ii hosts are more massive and metal - rich @xcite , pointing to a different progenitor . while @xcite claim a similarity between long grb ( lgrb ) and slsn - i hosts , @xcite argue that slsn - i hosts are often even more extreme and belong to the class of extreme emission line galaxies ( eelgs , see e.g.",
    "in this paper we present a detailed analysis of different parts of the host of ptf12dam and derive conclusions on the progenitor star .",
    "ptf12dam at z@xmath10.107 was detected by the palomar transient factory on april 20 2012 @xcite and shown to be a hydrogen - poor slsn similar to sn2007bi @xcite .",
    "its host is a `` tadpole galaxy '' @xcite with a compact core consisting of several sf regions , where the sn was located , and a fainter tail .",
    "global spectra of the host have been presented by @xcite and @xcite showing very strong emission lines and a low metallicity which point to recent starburst . throughout the paper",
    "we use a planck cosmology with @xmath40.315 , @xmath50.685 and h@xmath667.3 .",
    "we obtained longslit spectra using osiris at the gtc @xcite at two different slit angles ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : fc ] ) on feb .",
    "28 2014 and apr .",
    "slit1 was put at a parallactic angle covering the sn position while slit 2 was placed across the tadpole and also covers the sn site . at each epoch",
    ", we used the r2000b and r2500r grisms with a combined wavelength range from 3950 to 7700  and which provide resolutions of 2165 ( 0.85 / pix ) and 2475 ( 1.04 / pix ) respectively .",
    "exposure times were 3@xmath7400s at the first epoch and 4@xmath7400s at the second epoch .",
    "relative flux calibration was obtained by observing the standard stars g191 and gd143 at epoch 1 and 2 .",
    "the seeing was good with 1.2 and 0.9 arc sec in the two nights respectively .",
    "the spectra are then divided into 3 spatial bins each and analyzed separately .",
    "the bins have a width of 812 pixels to cover different parts of the galaxy ( see fig.[fig : fc ] ) .",
    "we also extract the integrated spectrum for both slit positions .    on august 4 , 2014",
    ", we performed tunable narrow - band filter observations with osiris / gtc of the field around ptf12dam .",
    "observations consisted of @xmath8s exposures using a 12 filter in steps of 8 around the central wavelength of h@xmath9 at the redshift of ptf12dam .",
    "an additional 200s continuum image was taken , scaled to the flux of each narrow band filter and subtracted from the frames after psf matching .",
    "both spectra show a multitude of emission lines ( see table [ table : emission ] and fig . [",
    "fig : wr ] ) .",
    "in addition to the strong nebular and auroral lines of [ oii ] , [ oiii ] , h@xmath9 , [ nii ] and [ sii ] , we detect 16 lines of the balmer series in emission , several transitions from he ii , [ neiii ] , [ feiii ] and [ ariv ] , the t@xmath10 sensitive [ oiii ] line @xmath11 4363 , [ oi ] @xmath11 6300 and most of the permitted transitions of he i. [ neiii]/[oiii ] is constant with oxygen abundance due to their similar ionization structure , but [ neiii ] is often missed because of its lower line strength .",
    "he ii , [ ariv ] and [ feiii ] require a hard radiation field to be ionized as it is usually provided by wr stars , but other sources are possible .",
    "[ oi ] is indicative of shocks and can be used to distinguish between excitations by agns and hii regions .",
    "the location in the diagnostic diagram of log(oi / h@xmath9 ) vs. log([oiii]/h@xmath12 ) confirm its origin in a normal hii region ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .",
    "the host is an eelg as are @xmath050% of slsn - type i hosts @xcite . with ews of [ oiii]@xmath115008 @xmath1  945@xmath132 and h@xmath9@xmath1814@xmath139 ( rest - frame ) in the integrated spectrum of the galaxy ,",
    "it is the most extreme example in the sample of @xcite ."
