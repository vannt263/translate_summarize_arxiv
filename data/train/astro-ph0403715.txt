    "motivated by the close separation of cl 1604 + 4304 and cl 1604 + 4321 in both radial velocity ( 4300  km  s@xmath6 ) and position on the sky ( @xmath10 ) , @xcite performed deep multi - band imaging with the palomar 5-m telescope covering the area between the two clusters .",
    "the imaging revealed an overdensity of red galaxies whose colors were consistent with early - type galaxies at @xmath0 , suggesting that the clusters were part of a high - redshift supercluster .    to verify this conclusion , map the supercluster structure , and obtain a large sample of cluster galaxies with measured spectroscopic properties",
    ", we are conducting an extensive spectroscopic survey spanning the region between cl 1604 + 4304 and cl 1604 + 4321 . in this letter , we present spectroscopic confirmation of this large scale structure and a discussion of its properties based on the currently known supercluster members .",
    "we assume a @xmath11cdm cosmology with @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "here we briefly describe the spectroscopic survey of the cl 1604 supercluster .",
    "a full discussion of the data acquisition and analysis procedures will be presented in the catalog paper ( gal , lubin & oke 2004 , in preparation ) .",
    "the survey was conducted using lris and the deep imaging multi - object spectrograph ( deimos ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) on the keck 10-m telescopes .",
    "target selection was based on multi - band imaging @xcite taken at the palomar 5-m telescope .",
    "a contiguous area of @xmath14 ( 4.8 mpc @xmath15 mpc ) between the original two clusters was imaged in @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and gunn @xmath18 filters .",
    "the galaxy catalog reaches a depth of @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 for a @xmath22 detection .",
    "the resulting color - magnitude diagrams reveal a well - delineated red sequence of galaxies whose colors ( @xmath23 ) are consistent with spectroscopically - confirmed , early - type galaxies in the two original clusters ( see figures 2 & 4 of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in figure  [ pal ] ,",
    "we indicate on the composite @xmath18 band image all of these galaxies by overlaying contours of red galaxy density .",
    "these contours clearly delineate the large system of galaxies encompassing the original clusters .",
    "we also observe two strong concentrations of red galaxies directly between cl 1604 + 4304 and cl 1604 + 4321 , suggesting the presence of two additional clusters .",
    "objects within the red sequence were preferentially ( but not exclusively ) targeted for slit assignment in our current spectroscopic survey .",
    "targets were observed with a combination of lris and deimos slitmasks .",
    "lris slitmasks covering parts of this region were observed on ut may 4 - 7 , 2000 .",
    "a total of six slitmasks were used , with @xmath24 objects per mask .",
    "objects with magnitudes down to @xmath25 were included .",
    "data were taken using the 400 l / mm grating blazed at 8500 , with a central wavelength of 7000 .",
    "this setup provides spectral coverage from 5500  to 9000  and a dispersion of 1.86  pix@xmath6 ; with the @xmath26 slits utilized , the resolution is 7.8  ( 550 km s@xmath6 at @xmath27 ) .",
    "seeing was typically @xmath28 .",
    "four of the masks were exposed for @xmath29s each , one mask for @xmath30s , and one for @xmath31s .",
    "hgnearkr arc lamps , as well as flat fields , were observed immediately before and/or after each set of target exposures to provide wavelength calibration with the instrument and telescope in the same configuration , minimizing errors due to flexure .",
    "the data were processed using standard iraf tasks and scripts .    to obtain a larger sample of objects , extending to fainter galaxies , and covering a wider spatial area , further spectroscopy was obtained with deimos on ut 25 - 26 may 2003 .",
    "galaxies as faint as @xmath32 were selected , as well as some objects previously observed with lris but for which no redshift was obtained .",
    "we targeted @xmath33 objects on each mask .",
    "the instrument was configured with the 1200 l / mm grating , blazed at 7500 .",
    "the central wavelength was set to 7700  such that oii@xmath34 and ca h and k @xmath35 at the redshift of the supercluster would be easily visible .",
    "slit widths were 1  , and where possible , slits were aligned with the major axis of the galaxy .",
    "this configuration results in a pixel scale of 0.33  pix@xmath6 , a resolution of @xmath361.7  ( 120 km s@xmath6 in the cluster frame ) , and spectral coverage from 6385  to 9015 . we observed four masks with a total exposure time of 12600s ( @xmath37s ) per mask .",
    "the large number of exposures permits excellent cosmic ray subtraction and a significant reduction in background noise .",
    "seeing ranged from 0.9  to 1.5  on the first night and was nearly constant at @xmath38 on the second night .",
    "for each mask setup , we obtained a set of three internal flatfields , as well as an arc line calibration exposure with the nearkrxe lamps .",
    "data reduction was performed using the deep2 @xcite version of the spec2d data reduction pipeline . based upon the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) spectral reduction package",
    ", this idl software performs all of the standard processing steps , producing sky - subtracted , wavelength - calibrated one- and two - dimensional spectracooper / deep / spec2d/ ] .",
    "redshifts for the lris and deimos observations were all measured using an iraf task called _ redsplot _ ( t.  small , private communication ) .",
    "this tool allows the user to interactively identify features in the one - dimensional spectra and displays the locations of other possible features from a user - provided spectral line list . in this way",
    ", one can centroid various visible features and test different redshifts to find which produces a consistent set of identified lines .",
    "median velocity errors for the lris and deimos data are 150 and 90  km  s@xmath6 , respectively .",
    "the six lris masks contained a total of 179 slitlets ; of these , 156 were distinct targets .",
    "an additional four objects were found serendipitously for a total of 160 unique objects .",
    "identifications were made for 147 of these , with 116 ( 80% ) being extragalactic , and 65 of these ( 56% ) having redshifts within the supercluster range of @xmath39 .",
    "the four deimos slitmasks had 326 unique slitlets .",
    "an additional 57 objects were detected serendipitously , yielding a total of 383 objects .",
    "of these , we were able to identify 309 objects , only 22 of which are stars .",
    "over 40% ( 122 ) of the identified objects were part of the supercluster complex .",
    "the combined lris and deimos data give 378 unique extragalactic redshifts .",
    "our analysis also includes the original sample of lris spectroscopy measured for cl 1604 + 4304 and cl 1604 + 4321 ( o98 ) .",
    "objects observed as part of that survey were distributed over an approximately @xmath40 region centered on each cluster .",
    "redshifts were measured for 103 and 135 galaxies in the fields of cl 1604 + 4304 and cl 1604 + 4321 , respectively ( p98,p01 ) .",
    "the combined spectroscopic survey yields a total of 597 unique extragalactic redshifts . in figure  [ zhist ]",
    ", we show the redshift histogram for the 289 galaxies in the range @xmath41 . there are four clear peaks in this distribution which correspond to the four member clusters of the supercluster .",
    "redshift peaks at @xmath1 and @xmath2 belong to the original clusters , cl 1604 + 4304 and cl 1604 + 4321 , respectively .",
    "the new clusters identified through the multi - band imaging ( see figure  [ pal ] ) correspond to the redshift peaks at @xmath4 ( cl 1604 + 4314 ) and @xmath5 ( cl 1604 + 4316 ) .",
    "table  [ clusterdata ] lists the name , the reference letter used throughout the letter , the central coordinates , and the median redshift for each cluster .",
    "the central coordinates and median redshift are measured from those galaxies which are counted as members in the detailed analysis of cluster membership presented in  3 .    figure  [ gal_posns ] shows the location of all 597 spectroscopic galaxies , with the 229 confirmed supercluster members coded by cluster membership .",
    "although the galaxies belonging to each member cluster appear reasonably concentrated and separated from one another , there is significant overlap throughout the supercluster region .",
    "in addition , the spatial distribution of galaxies suggests that we have not yet reached the edge of this structure .",
    "we note , however , that the region has not been uniformly sampled .",
    "velocity dispersions are notoriously difficult to calculate for galaxy clusters , although this has not prevented the publication of results using as few as ten redshifts per cluster . selecting cluster members , a radius in which to include objects , the mathematical technique , and even the mean cluster redshift",
    "each pose their own subtle issues .",
    "these problems are compounded in densely populated areas where the individual clusters overlap in a larger structure .",
    "nevertheless , we present initial estimates of the cluster velocity dispersions , while postponing detailed discussion for a future work , with the goal of demonstrating that the supercluster constituents are indeed significant structures , as suggested by p01 .    to determine the membership of each supercluster component , we utilize the rostat package @xcite , which measures a wide variety of estimators for the location ( median ) and scale ( line - of - sight dispersion ) of a set of measurements .",
    "it avoids assumptions of gaussianity in the underlying velocity distributions ( which is unlikely to be true for interacting clusters ) and includes bootstrap and jackknife error estimation for the cluster redshifts and dispersions .",
    "many of these estimators are significantly more resistant to non - gaussianity in the sample than the traditional gaussian ; large differences between the different scale estimates can be a sign of deviations from gaussianity ( either in shape or due to outliers ) in the sample .",
    "we first visually divide our redshift histograms into separate ( but overlapping ) redshift ranges for each cluster , selecting a conservative ( broad ) range for each which clearly includes the entire structure .",
    "the median redshift of each cluster is measured , and initial , cosmologically corrected peculiar velocities for each galaxy in the cluster are calculated .",
    "these velocities are input into rostat , which computes the biweight median velocity , and the line - of - sight dispersions @xmath42 and @xmath43 , among others .",
    "we then apply a shift to the velocities of each galaxy such that the biweight median velocity is zero , while preserving the dispersion .",
    "objects with @xmath44 are then clipped from the sample , and the median and dispersions recalculated .",
    "this procedure is iterated until either the various dispersion measures converge , or there are no more objects to be clipped .",
    "for all clusters , the clipping results in removal of fewer than 10% of the input galaxies .",
    "the shaded regions in figure  [ zhist ] show the final redshift range for each cluster .",
    "inspection of the spatial distribution of the clipped galaxies reveals that they are typically at large clustocentric distances .",
    "we note that using only those galaxies within the central 1.5 mpc yields comparable dispersions .",

    "such discrepancies highlight the fact that velocity dispersions of clusters ( and their error estimates ) based on small ( @xmath57 ) redshift samples are subject to strong systematics and should be regarded with skepticism , especially in the presence of larger scale structures .      one goal of this study is to determine whether or not these clusters are components of a larger system ( a supercluster ) or a chance projection on the sky .",
    "we estimate the cluster centers ( listed in table  [ clusterdata ] ) by starting with the position of the peak in red galaxy density for each cluster ( see figure  [ pal ] ) .",

    "as seen in figure  [ gal_posns ] , we may not yet have reached the outer limits of this structure , and future wide - area imaging and additional spectroscopy will be required to measure its full extent .",
