    "cosmological models filled with lattices of black holes have received considerable attention over recent years , as they provide an inhomogeneous alternative to the spatially homogeneous and isotropic friedmann - lematre - robertson - walker ( flrw ) solutions , while remaining simple enough to solve using analytic methods .",
    "they therefore present us with an opportunity to investigate some of the foundational assumptions that go into the standard concordance model of cosmology , which both neglects the effects of inhomogeneity on the large - scale expansion @xcite , whilst simultaneously requiring the existence of a `` dark sector '' @xcite .",
    "this is of particular interest as it is theoretically possible for small - scale inhomogeneities to play a role in the large - scale dynamics of cosmological models @xcite , and because inhomogeneities can have consequences for a wide array of cosmological observables @xcite .",
    "it is important to ensure that we understand all of these effects , especially with the advent of precision cosmology and in anticipation of future surveys .",
    "black hole lattices provide a valuable contribution to the literature on this subject , as they all include all relativistic effects at all orders .",
    "the work in this paper builds on the seminal works by lindquist and wheeler @xcite and misner @xcite , who considered time - symmetric initial data for black holes in vacuum .",
    "this work was recently extended and investigated within a cosmological context @xcite , and the evolution of this space has now been studied using numerical methods @xcite .",
    "the present study contributes to this literature by constructing exact initial data for a universe that contains both black holes and a cosmological constant , @xmath0 .",
    "these reduce to the models in @xcite in the limit where @xmath0 vanishes .",
    "these models do not require any approximations or perturbative methods , and therefore include all relativistic effects .",
    "this means that while the distribution of matter is highly idealised , the treatment of the gravitational field is exact and unambiguous .",
    "the lattice models we consider for the majority of this paper are based on 3-spheres tessellated with regular polyhedra , with a schwarzschild de - sitter - like mass placed at the centre of each .",
    "they therefore represent closed cosmological models , and have a degree of homogeneity if coarse - grained over large enough scales .",
    "there are six different ways of constructing such models , with either @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 or @xmath6 masses . in the absence of @xmath0 , each of these geometries is a time - symmetric hypersurface with vanishing extrinsic curvature , corresponding to a closed flrw universe at its maximum of expansion . with the inclusion of a non - zero @xmath0",
    "we find that solutions that correspond to spaces of constant mean extrinsic curvature have the terms involving weyl curvature and spatial curvature cancel each other out in the hamiltonian constraint equation . in a friedmann cosmology",
    ", this would correspond to the moment when the density parameters for dust and spatial curvature are equal in magnitude , and opposite in sign .",
    "recent related works of particular significance are the numerical studies of yoo _ et al _ @xcite , and perturbative constructions of sanghai _ et al _ @xcite .",
    "the first of these constructs a flat , infinite , cubic lattice of black holes with a non - zero cosmological constant , and numerically solves the constraint and evolution equations for the spacetime .",
    "the second study extends the post - newtonian formalism to include a cosmological constant , and then joins together cells of perturbed minkowski spacetime using the israel junction conditions .",
    "both of these studies are motivated by the fact that a positive - valued cosmological constant causes accelerated expansion of the universe at late times , and so is a prime candidate for `` dark energy '' .",
    "our work differs from these previous studies as we make no approximations when modelling the geometry of space , and because we solve the constraint equations using a fully analytic approach .",
    "the topology of our model is also different to that of yoo _ et al _ , which allows us the benefit of studying six different tessellations ( rather than the one tessellation that exists in flat space ) .",
    "this paper is organised as follows . in section [ sec :",
    "solution ] we present the initial data problem for a universe containing black holes and a cosmological constant . in section [ sec : propermass ] we determine the mass of these black holes by looking for a particular constant mean curvature slice of the schwarzschild - de sitter spacetime . section [ sec : decel ] introduces the cosmological deceleration parameter , and presents results for how it is affected by back - reaction in our inhomogeneous models . in section [ sec : horizons ] we derive a formula for locating apparent horizons within each of our lattice models , which are used in sections [ sec : distances ] to determine the distance between black holes .",
    "section [ sec : extremal ] then contains a presentation of the extremal values of @xmath0 in cosmologies of this type .",
    "finally , we discuss our results in section [ sec : discuss ] . throughout this paper",
    "we use geometrised units where @xmath7 .",
    "we use the second half of the greek alphabet ( @xmath8 ) as indices to denote spacetime coordinates , whilst the second half of the latin alphabet @xmath9 are used as indices to denote spatial coordinates .",
    "the @xmath11 decomposition of einstein s equations yields the hamiltonian and momentum constraint equations , @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the ricci scalar of the hypersurface , @xmath14 is the extrinsic curvature , @xmath15 its trace , @xmath16 is the matter density , @xmath17 is the intrinsic metric of the hypersurface and @xmath18 is the covariant derivative with respect to this metric .",
    "we can then write the extrinsic curvature in terms of its trace and trace - free part , @xmath19 , as @xmath20 and performing a conformal rescaling of the 3-metric , such that @xmath21 , then allows us to write the ricci scalar as @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the ricci scalar of @xmath24 , and @xmath25 is the covariant laplacian associated with @xmath24 .    substituting eqs .",
    "( [ k1 ] ) and ( [ r1 ] ) into eqs .",
    "( [ 1 ] ) and ( [ 2 ] ) then gives @xmath26 where we have made the substitution @xmath27 .",
    "it can be seen that for non - vanishing extrinsic curvature and/or @xmath0 we have that eq .",
    "( [ 5 ] ) is non - linear in @xmath28 , making it extremely difficult to solve in general .",
    "however , it can be seen that if we take @xmath29 then eq . (",
    "[ 6 ] ) is satisfied identically , and eq .",
    "( [ 5 ] ) becomes linear in @xmath28 : [ helmholtz ] 8 ^ 2 = .",
    "if @xmath23 is constant , then this is simply the helmholtz equation . if @xmath30 then it is just the laplace equation . in either case , it has known solutions . what is more , due to the linearity of eq .",
    "( [ helmholtz ] ) , we can add any number of particular solutions to obtain new solutions .",
    "this makes it highly amenable to the study of the many - body problem in cosmology .    for the study that follows",
    ", we take the conformal metric of the initial hypersurface to be a 3-sphere of constant curvature , with line - element @xmath31 this means that @xmath32 , and that solutions exist to eq .",
    "( [ helmholtz ] ) of the form @xmath33 . due to the linearity of eq .",
    "( [ helmholtz ] ) , this means that we can sum arbitrarily many such solutions to obtain @xmath34 as each term in this sum corresponds to a different mass , we have a solution that corresponds to @xmath35 masses on a 3-sphere .",
    "the parameters @xmath36 are a set of constants that we refer to as the `` mass parameters '' , and the @xmath37 are a set of source functions of the form @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is the @xmath40 coordinate after a rotation so that the @xmath41th mass appears at the coordinate position @xmath42 .",
    "this is exactly the same intrinsic geometry that one obtains for the corresponding situation on a time - symmetric hypersurface in the absence of @xmath0 ( see @xcite for further details ) .",
    "it should be noted that while the @xmath36 in eq . ( [ 9 ] ) look like mass parameters , they are not the masses that one would determine from observing gravitational interactions from within the spacetime .",
    "this is due to the existence of interaction energies , which themselves gravitate and must be accounted for in order to calculate the total proper mass of each of the black holes @xcite . in this section",
    "we outline the method we use to extract the proper mass of each of the black holes in our models .",
    "the basic idea here is to look at the asymptotic form of the geometry given in eq .",
    "( [ 9 ] ) in the limit @xmath43 , where we have rotated the coordinate system so that the @xmath41th mass is located at @xmath44 . taking",
    "this limit corresponds to looking at the black hole from infinity , in the asymptotically flat region on the far side of the einstein - rosen bridge ( for an explanation of this interpretation in terms of reflection operators and embedding diagrams , see @xcite ) .",
    "once we know the leading - order part of the gravitational field in this limit , we can compare it to the same limit of the schwarzschild - de sitter ( or kottler ) solution , and read off a value for the mass parameter .",
    "this process works , as we expect the geometry of space to approach that of a suitably chosen slice through the schwarzschild - de sitter solution as we approach @xmath44 .",
    "the schwarzschild - de sitter spacetime has a line - element , in standard schwarzschild coordinates @xmath45 , that can be written as @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the mass of the black hole .",
    "this solution has both black hole and cosmological horizons , provided that the combination of parameters @xmath48 lies within the range @xmath49 .",
    "we now need to take a slice through this spacetime that can be compared to the geometry of our initial data , as outlined in section [ sec : solution ] .",
    "the initial data constructed in section [ sec : solution ] has constant mean curvature ( cmc ) , which means we need to look for a cmc foliation of the schwarzschild - de sitter spacetime in order to determine the mass of our black holes . in order to do this",
    "it is convenient to write the metric as @xcite @xmath50 where @xmath51 and @xmath52 are the lapse and shift respectively , and where @xmath53 . insisting on a cmc foliation , with @xmath54 constant",
    ", then gives @xcite [ cmc ] ^-1 = 1- + ( k + ) r^2 , where @xmath55 , and where @xmath47 is the mass parameter from eq .",
    "( [ sds ] ) .",
    "the value of @xmath56 in this expression is constrained to be a function of @xmath57 only , and must obey the following evolution equation = m - + ( - ) a r^3 . for further details about this foliation , including explicit forms for the shift and lapse functions ,",
    "the reader is referred to ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the particular leaf we require is the one on which @xmath58 . from eq .",
    "( [ cmc ] ) , this gives us a hypersurface with intrinsic geometry ds^2 = ( 1 + ) ^4 ( d^2 + ^2 ( d^2 + ^2 d ^2 ) ) , where we have transformed to an isotropic radial coordinate using @xmath59 .",
    "this is manifestly the same intrinsic geometry as a time - symmetric slice though the schwarzschild geometry .",
    "given that the intrinsic geometry in eqs .",
    "( [ le ] ) and ( [ 9 ] ) is also identical to that of a time - symmetric slice through the schwarschild solution , this means that the proper mass of the @xmath41th black hole must be given by @xcite [ 15 ] m_i = _ j i , where the indices @xmath41 and @xmath60 label each of the @xmath35 masses in our cosmological model , and where @xmath61 is the coordinate distance @xmath40 between the mass @xmath62 and the mass @xmath63 , after rotating so that one of these is at @xmath64 .",
    "the sum in eq .",
    "( [ 15 ] ) is over all other masses in the spacetime , and therefore has a total of @xmath65 terms .",
    "this means that the mass of any given black hole in this model depends on the location and mass parameter of every other black hole , through @xmath61 and @xmath66 , respectively .",
    "one can not , therefore , determine the properties of any region of space without knowing the positions and magnitudes of every other mass in the universe .",
    "we are now in a position to be able to calculate some of the differences in the large - scale behaviour of a regular lattice of black holes in the presence of @xmath0 , and a homogeneous and isotropic flrw model containing dust and @xmath0 .",
    "one of the most relevant and interesting quantities for a comparison of this kind is the deceleration parameter , @xmath67 , which is a dimensionless quantity that measures the rate of change of expansion of space . for an flrw universe ,",
    "the deceleration parameter is defined as @xmath68 where overdots denote derivatives with respect to the proper time of comoving observers , @xmath69 .",
    "the friedmann equations for an flrw universe containing pressureless dust and @xmath0 , which give us the values of @xmath70 and @xmath71 in terms of the matter content , are given by @xmath72 where @xmath73 is the spatial curvature constant and @xmath16 is the energy density in the dust .",
    "the situation we considered in section [ sec : solution ] , where we constructed our initial data , was one in which @xmath74 and where @xmath75 .",
    "the most closely analogous flrw solutions are therefore those that obey the conditions @xmath76 this is because @xmath77 in an flrw solution , because @xmath78 , and because the electric part of the weyl tensor ( proportional to @xmath79 ) plays the role of the energy density in the effective friedmann equations @xcite . substituting these conditions into eq .",
    "( [ q1 ] ) then gives @xmath80 which is the expression we will use for the deceleration in both our black hole lattice and our comparison flrw space . in the former of these cases the energy density , @xmath16 , will be taken to be the sum of proper masses of all black holes , and in the latter case it will simply be the energy density in dust at the moment described in eq .",
    "( [ moment ] ) .",
    "a quantity that can now be used as a measure of back - reaction in our black hole lattice models is the ratio of deceleration parameters between these two types of universe , which according to the discussion above is given by @xmath81 where subscripts @xmath82 and @xmath83 on a quantity denote that it is associated with either the lattice of black holes or the fluid of dust , respectively .",
    "one may note that for vanishing @xmath0 the first term on the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ q2 ] ) diverges , and so this quantity can not be defined in that case . for non - zero @xmath0 , however , the deceleration parameter is finite , and the quantity in eq .",
    "( [ 19 ] ) is well defined .",
    ".ratios of scale factors for discrete and continuous universes for each of the six possible lattice configurations on a 3-sphere @xcite . [ cols=\"^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     in order to fully specify @xmath84 we now need to impose one further condition , which essentially corresponds to choosing which of the infinite family of solutions that obey the conditions eq . ( [ moment ] )",
    "we wish to compare to our lattice universe .",
    "we choose this condition to be such that the total mass of the dust fluid is equal to the sum of the masses in the black hole lattice , as in ref .",
    "this uniquely specifies a single flrw solution , and gives the energy density in the lattice and fluid models as @xmath85 where @xmath86 is the total mass in the universe , where @xmath87 and @xmath88 denote the global scale factors in the lattice and fluid models . in each case",
    "we have taken the volume of a hypersurface of constant @xmath69 to be given by @xmath89 .",
    "it now remains to identify an appropriate scale factor for each of the two models .    in an flrw model",
    "the choice of scale factor is unique and unambiguous . for a universe with positive spatial curvature ( @xmath90 ) , at the moment specified by eq .",
    "( [ moment ] ) and for the energy density specified in eq .",
    "( [ rhos ] ) , we have @xmath91 the corresponding quantity in the lattice model is more difficult to identify , as the length of any given curve in the space depends on its location and orientation ( the space is both inhomogeneous and anisotropic ) .",
    "we choose to take the curves that constitute the edges of the lattice cells in order to define a scale factor in this case .",
    "these curves are uniquely determined by the symmetries of the lattice , and are maximally far away from every black hole , making them as close as possible to a measure of the scale of the cosmology .",
    "the scale of these curves , as a ratio of curves that subtend the same angle at the centre of the conformal 3-sphere , is given in table [ tab : table1 ] .",
    "these ratios are the same as in the absence of @xmath0 @xcite , as the intrinsic geometry in eqs .",
    "( [ le ] ) and ( [ 9 ] ) is unchanged from that case . together with eq .",
    "( [ af ] ) , these ratios determine the scale factor @xmath92 for each of the six possible tessellations of the 3-sphere .",
    "we now have all the information needed to calculate the ratio of deceleration parameters in eq .",
    "( [ 19 ] ) , as a function of the combination @xmath93 .",
    "it can be seen that in the limit @xmath94 , both @xmath95 and @xmath96 tend to @xmath97",
    ". for small values of @xmath0 the deceleration parameters @xmath95 and @xmath96 are both large and positive ( diverging in the limit @xmath98 , as discussed above ) .",
    "these properties are true for each of the six tessellations of the 3-sphere , and in each case we find that @xmath99 rapidly as @xmath0 is increased .",
    "this is non - surprising , and is due to the form of the expression in eq .",
    "( [ 19 ] ) .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] shows the ratio of our two deceleration parameters , evaluated at different values of @xmath0 .",

    "when @xmath0 is large , @xmath103 , the ratio of deceleration parameters is approximately unity regardless of @xmath35 .",
    "again , this is to be expected from the form of the expression in eq .",
    "( [ 19 ] ) .",
    "when @xmath0 is very small , the ratio of deceleration parameters reduces to @xmath104 .",
    "this is shown by the curves corresponding to @xmath105 and @xmath106 , which are indistinguishable from each other . on the other hand , for intermediate values of @xmath0 , when @xmath107 , the same ratio diverges . using eqs .",
    "( [ rhos ] ) and ( [ af ] ) this occurs at @xmath108 , for which the green curve is a good indicator of this divergence in ratio .",
    "all values of @xmath0 below this critical value give @xmath109 , while all values above it give @xmath110 .",
    "we now wish to determine the effect a non - zero cosmological constant has on the locations of horizons in each of our lattice models .",
    "the apparent horizons in this case are defined as closed 2-surfaces that have outgoing future - directed normal null geodesics with vanishing expansion .",
    "such surfaces are marginally outer trapped , meaning that light rays are neither able to escape to infinity nor fall towards the singularity @xcite . to find the positions of these surfaces we use the orthonormal frame approach @xcite , with non - zero @xmath0 but in the absence of matter , and follow the approach used in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "we first consider a unit time - like vector @xmath111 and its covariant derivative , decomposed as @xmath112 where @xmath113 is the expansion scalar , @xmath114 is the shear tensor , @xmath115 is the vorticity tensor and @xmath116 is the projection tensor . if @xmath117 is orthogonal to our initial hypersurface then we immediately have [ 25 ] k=- , a_ij = _ , _ = 0 , where @xmath118 are coordinates in this space .",
    "we now need to consider the electric part of the weyl tensor .",
    "this quantity is obtained by taking the trace free part of the riemann tensor , @xmath119 , and decomposing it into its electric and magnetic parts @xcite .",

    "( [ 25 ] ) , the electric part of the weyl tensor can be written as @xmath120 where @xmath121 is the ricci tensor of the initial hypersurface .",
    "this result is obtained using the general expressions for the gauss embedding equation in orthonormal frame variables @xcite , and is identical to the result that one obtains in the absence of @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "we will now use it to locate the position of the apparent horizons .    consider three orthogonal space - like unit vectors , @xmath122 arranged so that @xmath123 points outwards from the black hole .",
    "these three vectors , along with @xmath124 , complete our orthonormal frame .",
    "we can now write the condition that outgoing null geodesics @xmath125 should have zero expansion as @xcite @xmath126 where @xmath127 is the screen space projector , which is an induced two - dimensional metric that can be written as @xmath128 .",
    "the first term in eq .",
    "( [ 27 ] ) is directly related to the extrinsic curvature of the initial hypersurface , and does not vanish if @xmath0 is non - zero . the second term in eq .",
    "( [ 27 ] ) is the expansion of @xmath123 in the screen space .",
    "we treat the black hole horizons as being non - expanding in the initial data , so that @xmath129 .",
    "the null raychaudhuri equation then tells us that the shear of the integral curves of @xmath125 must also vanish , which means that the positions of the apparent horizons in the initial data must have constant mean curvature and hence must be totally geodesic with indeterminate lines of curvature @xcite .",
    "these properties mean that the space - like normal to the apparent horizons must be a principal direction of the ricci tensor of the 3-space @xcite . from eq .",
    "( [ er ] ) this means that we have @xmath130 at all points on the apparent horizon , and hence that @xcite @xmath131 where @xmath132 is a frame derivative , @xmath133 is the expansion of @xmath123 , @xmath134 is a symmetric 2-index object and @xmath135 and @xmath136 are components of the electric part of the weyl tensor .",
    "( [ ee ] ) can be used to find the positions of the horizons in our initial data .",
    "let us now rotate our lattice of black holes so that one of the masses appears at @xmath42 , and consider the points at which the horizon of this black hole intersects curves that exhibit local rotational symmetry ( such as the edges of cells , or the curves that connect it to neighbouring black holes ) .",
    "at these points we have @xmath137 @xcite , which means that the second term on the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ ee ] ) vanishes . for the value of @xmath138",

    "( [ 27 ] ) in the second equality , and where in the third equality we have used to fact that @xmath127 contains only two of the three orthonormal basis vectors .",
    "the @xmath140 after the final equality indicates the fact that our initial data can describe either an expanding ( @xmath141 ) or a collapsing ( @xmath142 ) space .",
    "we can repeat the analysis above for marginally inner trapped surfaces , which will also be of interest in the models we are constructing . in this case",
    "( [ 27 ] ) should be modified so that it instead gives @xmath143 . by exactly the same logic , this yields @xmath144 where the @xmath145 sign here corresponds to expanding ( @xmath142 ) or collapsing ( @xmath141 ) space .",

    "[ penrose ] shows the hypersurfaces we have been considering , for some arbitrary value of @xmath0 , in a penrose - carter diagram .",
    "we have indicated how both expanding and contracting hypersurfaces fit into this diagram .",

    "on the left of the diagram the spacetime approaches perfect schwarzschild - de sitter , while on the right it approaches the complicated cosmological region ( separated off by the curve ) . at the mid - point , within the black hole region , each of the two spaces contains a throat that has a finite , non - zero minimal radius . in the limit",

    "similarly , it is stretching the definition somewhat to call the sphere at @xmath42 a horizon , as this corresponds to a sphere at infinity on the far side of the einstein - rosen bridge .",
    "nevertheless , it is useful to identify these points as `` cosmological horizons '' , as they become more interesting when @xmath171 .",
    "turning on @xmath0 reveals that the horizons change positions , as indicated in table [ tab : tab2 ] . for the inner trapped surfaces with @xmath172 , the black hole horizon at @xmath167 moves",
    "outwards with increasing @xmath0 , while the cosmological horizon at @xmath173 moves inwards as @xmath0 increases .",

    "this corresponds to the black hole horizon moving outwards on the far side of the einstein - rosen bridge , while the cosmological horizon moves inwards from infinity .",

    "when the black line and the coloured lines cross , eq . ( [ 31 ] ) is satisfied , and a value for the position of a horizon , @xmath181 , can be read off . for small enough values of @xmath0",
    "there are four occasions where this happens . however ,",
    "if the value of @xmath0 is increased sufficiently then these lines do not cross at all , and the horizons cease to exist .    the @xmath40 values from the positions of the horizons can be plotted separately , and in the first panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : fig4 ] these values are shown for the 5-mass model .",
    "the subsequent panels in fig . [",

    "these diagrams show all four possible horizons , both inner and outer black hole horizons as well as inner and outer cosmological horizons .",
    "the extremal values of @xmath0 , in both the inner and outer regions , are displayed in the diagrams as vertical lines . as the number of masses",
    "is increased , these two extremal values for @xmath0 converge , until they become indistinguishable by eye in the case of the 120-mass and 600-mass configurations .",
    "the black hole horizons meet at @xmath168 , as expected @xcite , and in every case the largest @xmath175 value is simply the midway point between the two masses .",
    "the information presented in fig . [ fig : fig4 ] can be used to determine the distance between neighbouring black holes for every value of @xmath0 , in each of the six possible configurations .",
    "cosmological and black hole horizons exist in the schwarschild - de sitter spacetime provided @xmath182",
    ". in our lattice models there also exist bounds on the combination @xmath183 , but the value of the upper limit is not always equal to @xmath184 .",
    "this is an interesting result , as it appears that the fact the black holes exist within a cosmology changes the value of @xmath159 for which the black holes can be said to be extremal ( for a given value of @xmath0 ) .",
    "the vertical lines in fig . [ fig : fig4 ] have already been used to denote the location of the point where the black hole and cosmological horizons become degenerate . here",
    "we will collect these results , for each of the six lattice models , to consider the behaviour of the upper bound on @xmath183 as a function of the number of masses in the universe .",
    "we present this information numerically in table [ tab : tab3 ] , and illustrate it graphically in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig5 ] .",
    "it is manifest that two different phenomena arise as the number of masses increases .",
    "the first is that the critical values for @xmath0 , after which there are no horizons , converge to the same value for both @xmath177 and @xmath185 .",
    "the second is that the value to which they converge is the same value as the upper bound in the schwarschild - de sitter solution , @xmath186 .",
    "this is not unexpected , as for large values of @xmath35 the distance between neighbouring masses increases , and the overall contribution from any individual black hole to the spacetime of any other diminishes . in other words",
    ", increasing @xmath35 isolates each black hole to the point that it can be very well approximated by the schwarzschild - de sitter solution .     as a function of the number of masses , for the outer horizons ( blue ) and the inner horizons ( yellow ) .",
    "the solid line corresponds to the schwarzschild - de sitter value of @xmath187.,scaledwidth=90.0% ]    it is also interesting to see if there is a varying lower limit for @xmath188 exists , or whether it is always bound from below by zero .",
    "one way of determining this is to look at the gradients of both sides of eq .",
    "( [ 31 ] ) and see if it always true that @xmath189 , for arbitrarily small values of @xmath0 . if it is , then the inner black hole and cosmological horizons should be expected to exist , and to remain separate .",
    "we calculated these two functions numerically , and found the condition to be valid down to values of @xmath190 and @xmath191 for all six lattice models .",
    "this indicates the lower bound on @xmath188 is always zero , at least as far as can be determined with machine precision calculations .",
    "this result agrees with the results of ref .",
    "@xcite , who found that an inner cosmological horizon always exists in the case of an infinite flat lattice .",
    "inhomogeneous cosmological models are important for understanding the role of small - scale structures on the large - scale dynamics of the universe , and in turn the consequent effects that this has on observable quantities .",
    "this paper contributes to the literature on this subject by providing and studying exact initial data for a universe that contains regularly arranged black holes in a hyperspherical universe and in the presence of a cosmological constant . in section [ sec : solution ] we presented the constraint equations for such a universe , and solved them in closed analytic form . in section",
    "[ sec : propermass ] we then determined the proper mass of the black holes by considering the constant mean curvature foliation of the schwarzschild - de sitter spacetime .",
    "we then studied the change in deceleration parameter due to inhomogeneity in spaces of this type , by comparing to positively curved flrw models that contain the same cosmological constant and dust with the same total proper mass .",
    "the results of this were presented in section [ sec : decel ] .",
    "we found that the back - reaction effect from inhomogeneity decreases as the number of masses is increased , and as the value of the cosmological constant becomes large .",
    "we then found expressions for the locations of the black hole and cosmological horizons in section [ sec : horizons ] , and determined numerical values for the positions of these horizons in each of the six possible lattice universes in section [ sec : distances ] .",
    "we found that there are upper bounds on the value of @xmath188 , where @xmath159 is the proper mass of the black holes in this spacetime , and that this upper bound converges to the schwarschild - de sitter value as the number of masses in the universe is increased .",
    "these results give qualitative agreement with the numerical work found performed in ref .",
    "@xcite when considering the inner black hole and cosmological horizons , but appear to disagree when considering the outer horizons .",
    "we expect that the source of this disagreement is due to the freedom that exists to change the scale of the size of the cells in the flat lattice that the authors of this study had been considering .",
    "no such freedom exists in the hyperspherical lattices that we have studied , which makes them much more rigid , and thus changes the relationship between the positions of black hole horizons and cosmological horizons .",
    "the initial data we have constructed and studied can be evolved numerically , as was done for the 8-mass case with vanishing @xmath0 in ref .",
    "in fact , it may be that the present set of initial data has certain benefits over the corresponding set without @xmath0 .",
    "this is because the initial hypersurface when @xmath168 is time - symmetric , meaning that evolving the initial data in either direction in time means evolving it towards a cosmological singularity , where numerical errors are likely to increase .",
    "initial data for eternally expanding lattice universes has so far only been achieved numerically @xcite , which inevitably leads to numerical errors that can grow during the evolution . in our case",
    ", we strongly suspect that , for the initial data we presented in section [ sec : solution ] , there will be values of the parameter combination @xmath188 that lead to eternally expanding universes .",
    "the fact that the initial data is exact in this case may then mean that errors in the future evolution are easier to control . using the friedmann equations , and the values given in eq .",
