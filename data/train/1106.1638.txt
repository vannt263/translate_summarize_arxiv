    "probabilistic forecasts aim to provide calibrated and sharp predictive distributions for future quantities or events of interest . as they admit the assessment of forecast uncertainty and",
    "allow for optimal decision making , probabilistic forecasts continue to gain prominence in a wealth of applications , ranging from economics and finance to meteorology and climatology ( gneiting 2008 ) .",
    "the general goal is to maximize the sharpness of the predictive distributions subject to calibration ( murphy and winkler 1987 ; gneiting , balabdaoui and raftery 2007 ) .",
    "for a real - valued outcome , a probabilistic forecast can be represented in the form of a predictive cumulative distribution function , which might be discrete , mixed discrete - continuous or continuous , with the latter case corresponding to density forecasts .    in many situations , complementary or competing probabilistic forecasts from dependent or independent information sources",
    "are available .",
    "for example , the individual forecasts might stem from distinct experts , organizations or statistical models .",
    "the prevalent method for aggregating the individual predictive distributions into a single combined forecast is the linear pool ( stone 1961 ) .",
    "while other methods for combining predictive distributions are available ( genest and zidek 1986 ; clemen and winkler 1999 ; 2007 ) , the linear pool is typically the method of choice , with the pioneering work of winkler ( 1968 ) and zarnowitz ( 1969 ) , and recent papers by mitchell and hall ( 2005 ) , wallis ( 2005 ) , hall and mitchell ( 2007 ) , jore , mitchell and vahey ( 2010 ) , kascha and ravazzolo ( 2010 ) and garratt et al .",
    "( 2011 ) being examples in the case of density forecasts .",
    "similarly , linear pools have been applied successfully to combine discrete predictive distributions ; for recent reviews , see ranjan and gneiting ( 2010 ) and clements and harvey ( 2011 ) .    despite the ubiquitous success of the linear pool in a vast number of applications , fragmented recent work points at potential shortcomings and limitations .",
    "hora ( 2004 ) proved that any nontrivial convex combination of two calibrated density forecasts is uncalibrated . in the discrete case , dawid ,",
    "degroot and mortera ( 1995 ) and ranjan and gneiting ( 2010 ) showed that linear combination formulas with strictly positive coefficients fail to be coherent and demonstrated potential improvement under nonlinear aggregation .",
    "our goal here is to unify these results and to extend them in various directions . towards this end",
    ", we develop novel theoretical approaches to studying combination formulas and aggregation methods , where we think of an aggregation method as a class of combination formulas .",
    "for example , the traditional linear pools comprises the linear combination formulas with nonnegative weights that sum to one .",
    "technically , we operate in terms of cumulative distribution functions , which allows us , in contrast to earlier work , to provide a unified treatment of all real - valued predictands , including the cases of density forecasts , mixed discrete - continuous predictive distributions , probability mass functions for count data and probability forecasts of a dichotomous event , all of which are important in applications . the extant literature compares combination formulas by examining whether or not they possess certain analytic characteristics , such as the strong setwise function and external bayes properties ( genest and zidek 1986 ; french and ros insua 2000 ) .",
    "again in contrast to much of the earlier work , we assess combination formulas and aggregation methods from the perspectives of coherence , calibration and dispersion .",
    "section [ sec : theory ] sets the stage by introducing the key tool of a prediction space , which is a probability space tailored to the study of forecasts and combination formulas .",
    "we revisit the work of gneiting et al .",
    "( 2007 ) and ranjan and gneiting ( 2010 ) in the prediction space setting and show , perhaps surprisingly , that if the outcome is binary , probabilistic calibration and conditional calibration are equivalent . throughout the technical parts of the paper , information sets",
    "are represented by @xmath0-algebras , and a predictive distribution is considered ideal if it agrees with the conditional distribution of the predictand , given the information basis or @xmath0-algebra at hand .",
    "section [ sec : methods ] is devoted to the study of specific , linear and non - linear combination formulas and aggregation methods .",
    "a key result is , roughly , that dispersion tends to increase under linear pooling .",
    "this helps explain the success of linear combination formulas in aggregating underdispersed component distributions , and leads us to unify and strengthen the aforementioned results of dawid et al .",
    "( 1995 ) , hora ( 2004 ) and ranjan and gneiting ( 2010 ) .",
    "in particular , any linear combination formula with strictly positive coefficients fails to be coherent , and the traditional linear pool fails to be flexibly dispersive . in view of these limitations , we investigate parsimonious nonlinear alternatives , including generalized linear pools ( dawid et al .",
    "1995 ) , the spread - adjusted linear pool , which has been used successfully in the meteorological literature ( berrocal , raftery and gneiting 2007 ; glahn et al .",
    "2009 ) , and the beta - transformed linear pool ( ranjan and gneiting 2010 ) , which we demonstrate to be flexibly dispersive .",
    "section [ sec : examples ] turns to a simulation study and data examples on density forecasts for daily maximum temperature at seattle - tacoma airport and s&p 500 returns .",
    "the paper ends in section [ sec : discussion ] , where we summarize our findings from applied and theoretical perspectives , suggest directions for future work and , in addition to discussing probabilistic forecasts , hint at the closely related problem of the fusion of expert judgements that are expressed in terms of probability distributions .",
    "in a seminal paper , murphy and winkler ( 1987 ) proposed a general framework for the evaluation of point forecasts , which is based on the joint distribution of the forecast and the observation .",
    "dawid et al .",
    "( 1995 ) developed and used a related framework in studying multiple probability forecasts for a binary event .",
    "here we respond to the call of dawid et al .",
    "( 1995 , p.  288 ) for an extension , and we start with an informal sketch of a fully general approach , in which the observations take values in just any space .",
    "the most general setting considers the joint distribution of multiple probabilistic forecasts and the observation on a probability space @xmath1 .",
    "more explicitly , we assume that the elements of the sample space @xmath2 can be identified with tupels of the form @xmath3 where each of @xmath4 is a probability measure on the outcome space of the observation , @xmath5 . for @xmath6",
    ", we require the random probability measure @xmath7 to be measurable with respect to the sub-@xmath0-algebra @xmath8 that encodes the forecast s information set or information basis , consisting of data , expertise , theories and assumptions at hand .",
    "the probability measure @xmath9 on @xmath10 specifies the joint distribution of the probabilistic forecasts and the observation .    in this setting ,",
    "the probabilistic forecasts @xmath4 might stem from distinct experts , organizations or statistical models , as commonly encountered in the practice of forecasting . in aggregating them , the theoretically optimal strategy is to combine information sets , that is , to issue the conditional distribution of the observation @xmath5 given the @xmath0-algebra @xmath11 generated by the information sets @xmath12 .",

    "transformation parameters @xmath358 are estimated from training data , say @xmath359 . if the predictive cumulative distribution functions @xmath360 are absolutely continuous with lebesgue densities @xmath361 for @xmath362 , the aggregated predictive distributions are also absolutely continuous , and our preferred estimation technique is to maximize the mean ( or sum ) of the logarithmic score ( matheson and winkler 1976 ; gneiting and raftery 2007 ) over the training data , namely @xmath363 where @xmath364 denotes the classical beta function . the logarithmic score is simply the logarithm of the value that the density forecast attains at the realizing observation .",
    "it is positively oriented , that is , the higher the score , the better , and it is proper , in the sense that truth telling is an expectation maximizing strategy .",
    "alternatively , the corresponding estimates can be viewed as maximum likelihood estimates under the assumption of independence between the training cases .",
    "the optimization can be carried out numerically using the method of scoring , for which we give details in appendix b. approximate standard errors for the estimates can be obtained in the usual way , by evaluating and inverting the hessian matrix for the mean logarithmic score or log likelihood function . however , the estimates of the weights @xmath202 need to be nonnegative .",
    "thus , if unconstrained optimization results in negative weights , we turn to the active barrier algorithm implemented in the constrained optimization routine constroptim in r ( development core team 2011 ) . similarly , linear , generalized linear and spread - adjusted linear combination formulas can be fitted by maximizing the mean logarithmic score over training data . for reasons of simplicity and tradition",
    ", we frequently refer to the resulting estimates as maximum likelihood estimates .",
    "we now illustrate and complement our theoretical results in simulation and data examples on density forecasts .",
    "this corresponds to the prediction space setting , where the cdf - valued random quantities @xmath200 are absolutely continuous almost surely , and thus can be identified with random lebesgue densities @xmath263 . throughout the section ,",
    "we fit combination formulas by maximizing the mean logarithmic score over training data , in the ways described above and in appendix b. to lighten the notation , we use the acronyms pit , tlp , slp and blp to refer to the probability integral transform and the traditional , spread - adjusted and beta transformed linear pool , respectively .    the recent work of ranjan and gneiting ( 2010 ) and clements and harvey ( 2011 ) contains a wealth of simulation and data examples on the combination of probability forecasts for a binary event . in the concluding section [ sec : discussion ]",
    "we summarize these experiences and relate them to the findings in the case studies hereinafter .      .maximum likelihood estimates with approximate standard errors ( in brackets ) for the parameters of the combined density forecasts in the simulation example .",
    "[ tab : sim.mle ] [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     finally , we consider the predictive performance of a more comprehensive predictive model , which addresses both the first and the second order dynamics , in that @xmath365 where @xmath366 and @xmath367 are ma(1 ) and student-@xmath368 garch(1,1 ) processes , respectively .",
    "the maximum likelihood estimates in this mixed specification are @xmath369 and @xmath370 for the ma parameters , and @xmath371 , @xmath372 , @xmath373 and @xmath374 for the garch parameters .",
    "the resulting density forecast can be thought of as combining information sets with respect to the first and second order dynamics , as opposed to combining the corresponding component forecasts @xmath375 and @xmath376 .",
    "it outperforms the other types of density forecasts and achieves a mean logarithmic score of 3.638 for the training period and 3.473 for the test period .",
    "we have studied methods for combining predictive distributions . from a theoretical perspective",
    ", our approach deviates from previous work in major ways .",
    "technically , we operate in terms of prediction spaces and cumulative distribution functions , which allows for a unified treatment of all real - valued predictands including , for example , density forecasts for continuous variables and probability forecasts of a binary event .",
    "conceptually , our work is motivated by applications in probabilistic forecasting , and thus we assess combination formulas and aggregation methods in terms of coherency , calibration , and dispersion .",
    "while it is not difficult to construct coherent combination formulas , the formulas typically used in practice tend to be incoherent .",
    "our analytical results about the linear pool extend and unify extant work by dawid et al .",
    "( 1995 ) , hora ( 2004 ) and ranjan and gneiting ( 2010 ) , and show that any linear combination formula with strictly positive coefficients fails to be coherent . in this sense , combined evidence is nonlinear .",
    "an interesting open problem is whether or not parsimonious ramifications , such as spread - adjusted or beta transformed linear combination formulas , are coherent .",
    "that said , the applied relevance of the notion of coherency is limited , as predictive distributions or expert opinions issued in practice are hardly ever ideal . in typical practice ,",
    "underdispersed or approximately neutrally dispersed predictive distributions are to be aggregated . in the case of underdispersed components ,",
    "the tendency of linear combination formulas to increase dispersion can be beneficial , and helps explain the success of linear pooling in applications ( madigan and raftery 1994 ) .",
    "however , if the components are neutrally dispersed , the failure of the traditional linear pool to be flexibly dispersive is a serious limitation .",
    "berrocal et al .",
    "( 2007 ) , glahn et al .",
    "( 2009 ) and kleiber et al .",
    "( 2011 ) observed this empirically in the context of probabilistic weather forecasts , and proposed a special case of the spread - adjusted linear pool as an ad hoc remedy .",
    "our theoretical results document the increased flexibility of the spread - adjusted linear pool , and demonstrate that the beta - transformed linear pool is exchangeably flexibly dispersive .",
    "not surprisingly , the parsimonity principle and the bias - variance tradeoff apply in the practice of the combination of predictive distributions .",
    "thus , in data poor settings , where training data are scarce , the parsimonious traditional linear pool might be the method of choice , despite its theoretical shortcomings , as demonstrated persuasively in the recent simulation study of clements and harvey ( 2011 ) . in data rich settings , where predictive models can reliably be estimated , linear aggregation tends to be suboptimal .",
    "hence , we have studied parsimonious nonlinear alternatives , including the spread - adjusted linear pool ( slp ) and the beta transformed linear pool ( blp ) .",
    "further options include consensus methods ( winkler 1968 ) and nonparametric approaches , such as isotonic recursive partitioning ( luss , rosset and shahar 2011 ) .",
    "as winkler ( 1986 ) noted , `` different combining rules are suitable for different situations '' .",
    "the slp and blp approaches can also be used to provide calibration and dispersion corrections to a single predictive distribution , similar to the methods described by cox ( 1958 ) , platt ( 1999 ) , zadrozny and elkan ( 2002 ) and primo et al .",
    "( 2009 ) in the context of probability forecasts for a binary event .",
    "an interesting question then is whether dispersion adjustments ought to be applied to the individual components prior to the aggregation . in situations in which the components show substantially differing degrees of dispersion , or are uniformly under- or overdispersed",
    ", we indeed see potential benefits in doing this , with ( here unreported ) simulation experiments providing partial support to this view . in our temperature example , the components derive from point forecasts , which is the most extreme form of underdispersion , and prior to aggregating the components we apply a simple gaussian technique , which obtains approximately neutrally dispersed individual density forecasts .",
    "in addition to their relevance in probabilistic forecasting , our findings bear on the related problem of the fusion of expert opinions that are expressed in the form of probability distributions .",
    "ha - duong ( 2008 ) reviews methods for doing this , and applies them to combine expert opinions about the climate sensitivity constant , which is a key quantity in the study of the greenhouse effect .",
    "our analytic results imply that if each individual expert is neutrally dispersed , linear aggregation results in combined assessments that are underconfident and show an unduly wide range of uncertainty , when in fact a sharper assessment could be made . in situations of this type , the parsimonious slp technique with its single , easily interpretable spread - adjustment parameter , @xmath162 , might be preferable to the blp , particularly when the individual components are symmetric and unimodal .",
    "our theoretical results show that neutrally dispersed components require values of @xmath269 , with more specific recommendations depending on the subject matter and situation at hand .",
    "the case @xmath271 corresponds to the traditional linear pool and can be a useful choice in situations in which overconfident experts make underdispersed judgements .",
    "let @xmath131 denote the probability integral transform of the cdf - valued random quantity @xmath127 .",
    "then the random variable @xmath377 has expectation @xmath177 and its cumulative distribution function is @xmath378 . in particular , @xmath379 is uniformly distributed .",
