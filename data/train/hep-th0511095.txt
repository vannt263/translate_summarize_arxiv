    "the decay of a metastable vacuum state is a quite universal problem in quantum field theory .",
    "the decay proceeds through nucleation and subsequent classical expansion of the bubbles of the true vacuum .",
    "the classical bubbles can exist only starting from a certain critical radius at which the energy loss due to the surface terms is compensated by the gain in the volume energy .",
    "the formation of the critical bubbles is thus a quantum tunneling process@xcite which tunneling can be described by an euclidean - space configuration of the field , called a ` bounce'@xcite .",
    "the space - time nucleation rate of the critical bubbles , @xmath0 , i.e. the probability of such nucleation per unit time and per unit volume , is proportional to the exponent of the classical action on the bounce configuration : @xmath1 , while the pre - exponential factor requires a calculation of the functional determinant at the bounce .",
    "the exponential factor is readily found@xcite in the so called thin wall limit , namely when the radius of the critical bubble is much bigger than the effective thickness of its wall .",
    "this limit is always realized at a small difference @xmath2 between the vacuum energy density of the false and the true vacua , with the other parameter determining @xmath3 being the surface tension @xmath4 of the bubble wall , i.e. of the boundary between the metastable and the stable phases .",
    "the pre - exponential factor in the bubble nucleation rate is known in a closed form only in ( 1 + 1 ) dimensional models@xcite , where in the thin wall limit it is determined only by the parameter @xmath2 , with only partial results found in ( 2 + 1 ) dimensions@xcite , and virtually no result known in the ( 3 + 1 ) dimensional case .    similarly to the behavior in the decay of a metastable phase in a thermal setting , the presence of matter in the false vacuum generally provides ` centers of nucleation ' for the bubbles of the true vacuum .",
    "thus one can consider the false vacuum decay induced by the presence of a particle@xcite , by particle collisions@xcite , by matter with finite density@xcite , as well as by the matter being in a thermal equilibrium where the problem goes back to the more conventional thermodynamic setting@xcite . in this paper",
    "we revisit the calculation of the bubble nucleation rate associated with the presence of a particle in the false vacuum .",
    "the particle - induced nucleation can also be viewed as the decay of the particle ( albeit in the process the initial ` vacuum ' state also gets destroyed ) , whose rate @xmath5 generically can be written in the form @xmath6 , where the constant @xmath7 , which can be naturally called the ` catalysis factor ' , is the main subject of our consideration .",
    "the catalysis is most efficient for the particles which have zero modes localized on the boundary between the false and the true vacua .",
    "the reason for this behavior is that in this case the energy corresponding to the mass of the particle @xmath8 in the initial state is fully transferred to the bubble degrees of freedom , since in the final state the particle ends up as a zero mode localized on the bubble wall .",
    "this effectively corresponds to the upward shift by @xmath8 of the energy at which the tunneling takes place@xcite , and results in @xmath7 being proportional to the exponential factor @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the ( euclidean ) time on the tunneling trajectory .",
    "the exponential behavior due to the shift of the energy for the tunneling trajectory can be found explicitly both in ( 1 + 1 ) dimensions@xcite and in higher - dimensional models@xcite .",
    "however the pre - exponential factor has been calculated only for the bosons of the master field in a ( 3 + 1 ) dimensional case@xcite , for which bosons the existence of the zero mode is always true . here we calculate the pre - exponential behavior of the catalysis factor for the same bosons in lower dimensions , and also find a closed formula for this factor in ( 1 + 1 ) dimensions for a fermion , whose field has a zero mode on the inter - vacua boundary .",
    "the existence of such fermionic mode is a generic phenomenon and is guaranteed in the case where the mass term for the fermions changes sign across the bubble wall@xcite .    our consideration , similarly to ref.@xcite , is generally limited to models with weak coupling , which implies that the masses @xmath8 of the both types of considered particles are small in comparison with the scale of the surface tension @xmath4 . in this case",
    "the deformation of the tunneling trajectory due to the energy shift by @xmath8@xcite can be neglected , so that , in particular , the tunneling time @xmath10 coincides with the radius @xmath11 of the critical bubble , @xmath12 , as it does in the spontaneous vacuum decay@xcite .",
    "furthermore , we also assume the applicability of the thin wall limit , which implies the condition @xmath13 , and which is always valid in the limit of small @xmath2 .",
    "the catalysis factor @xmath7 , as defined , has the dimension of the spatial volume .",
    "thus it would be natural to compare the pre - exponential factor in @xmath7 with the spatial volume of the critical bubble of the radius @xmath14 .",
    "under our assumptions we find that for a fermion in ( 1 + 1 ) dimensions this factor is indeed of order @xmath14 , while the catalysis factor for the bosons is enhanced in comparison with the volume of the bubble by inverse powers of the ( small ) coupling constant .",
    "it should be noted that technically the bosonic catalysis factor in lower dimensions can be found by a straightforward application of the treatment of ref.@xcite .",
    "such application is fully justified in a ( 2 + 1 ) dimensional case .",
    "however in ( 1 + 1 ) dimensions there is a potential complication in estimating the effect of the quantum fluctuations arising from an infrared behavior of the modes of the bosonic field over the bounce background .",
    "we demonstrate for this case that the large infrared terms in fact cancel due to the specific properties of the soft modes .",
    "the material in the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in sec.2",
    "we briefly review the calculation of the spontaneous decay rate of false vacuum and present a calculation of the decay rate induced by a boson of the scalar field , which defines the vacuum states .",
    "in sec.3 the problem of the infrared behavior of the one - loop correction to the calculated decay rate in ( 1 + 1 ) dimensions is considered and it is shown that this problem is resolved due to a cancellation of the contributions to this correction between the negative mode and the sum over the positive soft modes of the field of the bounce . in sec.4",
    "the catalysis factor is calculated for a fermion in a ( 1 + 1 ) model .",
    "we then discuss the decay of metastable states in the sine - gordon model with added linear term , the so called ` sine - gordon staircase ' . using the equivalence@xcite of this bosonic model and the massive fermionic thirring model in an external electric field , we find the induced decay rate for both the weak coupling limit ( sec.5 ) and for the strong coupling limit ( sec.6 ) , the latter corresponding to a weak coupling in the thirring model .",
    "finally , in sec.7 we discuss possible implications of our calculation for other models .",
    "in what follows we assume a situation where the energy density of a scalar field @xmath15 , the ` master field ' , has a local minimum at @xmath16 , which is higher than in a neighboring minimum at @xmath17 .",
    "the vacuum state defined by the former minimum is referred to as the false vacuum , while the latter is the true vacuum .",
    "a typical example of such situation is provided by the well known model of a scalar field with the potential v()=^2 8 ( ^2 - v^2 ) ^2 + a  , [ pot ] where @xmath18 , @xmath19 , and @xmath20 are constants . at @xmath21",
    "the potential has two degenerate minima at @xmath22 , while at small positive @xmath20 the degeneracy is lifted in such a way that the minimum at @xmath23 has energy density bigger than that of @xmath24 by the amount @xmath25 .",
    "the vacuum state at @xmath23 , being stable at @xmath26 becomes metastable at positive @xmath20 and decays by nucleation and subsequent expansion of the bubbles filled with the phase @xmath24 . at small @xmath20 the surface density of the bubble wall can be approximated@xcite by the surface density of the soliton with the field profile ( x ) = v [ wall ] interpolating between the two degenerate vacua in the limit @xmath27 : = _",

    "we assume throughout this paper that this ratio is a small parameter , which thus corresponds to weak coupling .    in the euclidean - space formulation of the problem of the false vacuum decay@xcite the calculation of the spontaneous decay rate amounts to a semiclassical evaluation of the imaginary part of the energy of the false vacuum from the path integral z=",

    "let us consider the contribution to the integral ( [ dprop ] ) arising from the configurations , where the bounce is far ( in units of its radius ) from either of the points @xmath45 and @xmath46 , i.e. where @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "the propagators @xmath49 and @xmath50 in the integral in eq.([dprop ] ) describe the exponential attenuation of the correlation ( @xmath51 does not have this exponential behavior . for this reason at @xmath52 the integrand in eq.([dprop ] ) is maximized for @xmath44 lying on the straight line running between @xmath45 and @xmath46 : @xmath53 , and the integration can be split into the longitudinal , over the parameter @xmath54 along this line , and the transversal , over @xmath55 .",

    "when the bounce is far from the endpoints of integration over @xmath54 , i.e. @xmath58 and @xmath59 , the value of the form factor in fact does not depend on @xmath54 and is a constant @xmath60 .",
    "since the contribution of the excluded regions around the endpoints is only of relative order @xmath61 , the integral in eq.([dprop ] ) can be replaced at large @xmath62 by d(x , y ) = i 2 w_0 f_0 d^dz d_0(x - z ) d_0 ( y - z )  , [ dprop1 ] where @xmath60 should be calculated from the configuration shown in fig.1b .",

    "we will show however that the sum over the soft modes gives zero for this infrared contribution due to a cancellation between one negative and all positive modes . in order to demonstrate this we consider the parametrization of the shape of the bounce in the polar coordinates @xmath94 on a plane , so that the effective action ( [ act ] ) for the soft modes takes the form s=_0 ^ 2 ( - 1 2 r^2 ) d= ^2 + _ 0 ^ 2 2 ( ^2 - ^2 ) d + o(^4 ) , [ act2 ] where the latter expression shows the two first terms of expansion in the small deviation @xmath95 of the radial variable @xmath96 from its stationary value @xmath97 , and the dot stands for the derivative over @xmath98 .",

    "let us also remark on the decay of a moving particle in the false vacuum .",
    "if particle moves with a constant velocity then the probability depends on the velocity through the standard lorentz factor .",
    "however if it moves with the constant acceleration situation is more subtle since in the particle frame vacuum behaves as the thermal bath due to unruh effect .",
    "the effective temperature is defined through the acceleration as t_eff = a 2 hence probability of the particle decay is modulated by the thermal effects .",
    "the most essential effect corresponds to the possible deformation of the classical bounce .",
    "since temperature corresponds to the periodicity in the euclidean time then the deformation of the bounce happens when period corresponding to the temperature becomes comparable to @xmath109 .",
    "that is deformation of the bubble emerges if the acceleration is larger then a_crit=. and our approximation fails .",
    "the very existence of fermions in a model is known to modify ( without any fermions being present in the initial state ) the pre - exponential factor in the rate of the false vacuum decay in the situation where the complex fermion field @xmath110 has a zero mode on the boundary between the vacua ( in the limit @xmath111 ) .",
    "such situation takes place when the mass term for the fermion changes sign between the two vacua@xcite .",

    "the linear perturbation term in the sine - gordon model corresponds to the constant electric field in the thirring model realization , so that the problem of false vacuum decay can be discussed in both formulations . in the thirring model it corresponds to the schwinger pair production .",
    "the probability of the spontaneous vacuum decay in the sine - gordon model and equivalent schwinger process in thirring model has been found in @xcite .",
    "the one - loop result coincides with the general formula @xmath144 , while in the special case of @xmath145 , corresponding to @xmath146 , the exact result is found as w_th = -2 ( 1 -e^- ^2 / ) note that in this case the bose - fermi equivalence allows to perform the summation over the multiple bounces in the sin - gordon theory .",
    "now we can discuss the decay of the false vacuum in the presence of a particle corresponding to the field @xmath15 in the sine - gordon model . in the weak coupling regime for the bosons ,",
    "i.e. at small @xmath147 , the soliton is much heavier then the boson particle , which corresponds to the situation where the external particle does not deform the classical bounce configuration .",
    "hence the decay rate can be immediately read off eq.([catb ] ) . in this case",
    "the process corresponds in the thirring model to the nonperturbative decay of the light electrically neutral meson in the electric field and the catalysis factor of this process is k_th = 32 ^2 e^2 m_b / where @xmath148 is the meson mass .",
    "note that this process is the two - dimensional counterpart of the induced schwinger processes discussed in four dimensions in @xcite in the exponential approximation .",
    "the boson - fermion correspondence in this model actually allows to find the meson decay rate in the limit , opposite to what has been considered so far in this paper , namely for strongly coupled bosons , when the boson mass is close to the kink - antikink threshold .",
    "this limit corresponds to a small positive @xmath131 , and the boson mass ( at @xmath71 ) is @xmath149 .",
    "the near - threshold dynamics of the soliton - antisoliton pair can be considered nonrelativistically as a motion of a pair with the reduced mass @xmath150 in the local potential @xmath151 , which correctly reproduces the energy of the bound state ( the boson ) . for a nonzero @xmath2",
    "the nonrelativistic hamiltonian for this system takes the form : h = p^2 - x -2 g ( x )  .",
    "[ hamnr ] the problem of the boson decay in the false vacuum is reduced in terms of this equivalent nonrelativistic system to that of ionization of the bound state in the external electric field @xmath2 .    in order to solve the ionization problem we start with considering the euclidean time propagator (  the heat kernel \" ) defined as @xmath152 , and the corresponding energy dependent green s function at the negative ( i.e. below the threshold ) energy @xmath153 : g(x , y ;",
    "-^2 ) = _ 0^(x , y ; ) ( -^2 ) d[nrgf ] at @xmath154 and @xmath155 .",
    "we remind that if only the kinetic term is retained in the hamiltonian ( [ hamnr ] ) , i.e. at @xmath156 and @xmath146 , these functions are @xmath157 and @xmath158 . at @xmath159 and a nonzero @xmath131 the green s function for the hamiltonian ( [ hamnr ] ) is found as g_=0 ( 0,0 ; -^2/ ) = g_0(0,0 ; -^2/ ) 1- 2 g g_0(0,0 ; -^2/ ) = 2 1 1- g /  .",
    "[ gg ] the latter expression contains explicitly the pole at @xmath160 corresponding to the bound state .",
    "when both the @xmath2 and @xmath131 are nonzero the equation ( [ gg ] ) is modified by replacing the green s function @xmath161 by that for a nonvanishing @xmath2 : @xmath162 .",
    "the latter green s function can be expressed in terms of the corresponding propagator @xmath163 which can be found in the textbook @xcite : _ ( x , y ; ) =  , [ ke ] g_(0,0 ; -^2 ) = _ 0^ ( ^2 12 ^3 -^2 ) d  , [ ge ] and the pole position is thus determined from the equation 2 g g_(0,0 ; -^2 ) = 1  .",
    "[ pole ]    the peculiarity of the latter equation is that the integral in eq.([ge ] ) is formally divergent , which is the usual situation in a calculation of the energy of an unstable state . in order to make physical sense , both that energy and the integral in eq.([ge ] )",
    "should be understood as a result of an analytical continuation in the parameters of the model from the region where the considered state is stable . in terms of eq.([ge ] ) this corresponds to a continuation from the region of ( formally ) negative @xmath164 where the integral is convergent .",
    "the result of such analytical continuation to physical positive @xmath164 can be formulated as follows@xcite : the integration runs along the real axis of @xmath10 from @xmath165 to the value of @xmath10 where the integrand has minimum , i.e. to @xmath166 . from that point",
    "the contour of integration should be turned parallel to the imaginary axis of @xmath10 , corresponding to the direction of the steepest descent ( see fig.2 ) .",
    "this contour rotation gives rise to an imaginary part of the integral , and hence to an imaginary part of the energy of the resonant state , corresponding to the decay width of the resonance .",
    "following this procedure one can readily find the real and the imaginary parts of the integral in eq.([ge ] ) and reduce the equation ( [ pole ] ) for the position of the pole to the form g = 1  , which corresponds to the decay rate of the bound state = 2 g^2 ( - 4 3 g^3 ^2 )  .",
    "[ gf ] it can be noted that the exponential factor in this formula is the standard wkb tunneling exponent in a linear potential , while the pre - exponential factor is a new result .",
    "the described derivation of the formula ( [ gf ] ) assumes that the integral in eq.([ge ] ) can be evaluated in the saddle point approximation , which implies that the parameter in the exponent in eq.([gf ] ) is large , i.e. that @xmath167 .",
    "in this paper we have refined the calculations of the decay rate of the boson in the false vacuum and have found the decay rate of fermion in the false vacuum in ( 1 + 1 ) dimension with the pre - exponential factor .",
    "all calculations , except for the one in sec.6 , have been performed in the approximation when the back reaction of the external particle on the euclidean bounce solution can be neglected .",
    "the account of the back reaction amount to several new effects which are different for d=2 and @xmath168 .",
    "in the ( 1 + 1 ) dimensional case the back reaction deforms the classical solution which deformation has been described classically in ref.@xcite however the calculation of the pre - exponential factor is beyond our approximation",
    ". such calculation could be potentially interesting from the stringy perspective .",
    "indeed , the worldsheet theory on nonabelian string in several models can be identified with the @xmath169 model ( see @xcite for a recent review ) which has one true vacuum and a set of metastable ones . at large n",
    "this theory can be treated perturbatively and the issue of the decay of metastable vacua or in other terns exited strings can be discussed , similarly one can discuss the fate the different excitations on the exited metastable string which is just the problem we have considered . in some situations",
    "the pre - exponential factor is of the prime importance since in some range of parameters the n dependence disappear from the exponent @xcite .",
    "however it is unclear if the regime with the negligible back reaction could exist in the worldsheet theory .",
    "it seems that the analysis similar to one in section 6 could be applicable in this case .    in higher dimensions",
    "the situation is more complicated .",
    "the point is that the initial particle evolves along a trajectory in the complexified minkowski space@xcite . at the first stage of the process",
    "the initial particle `` produces '' the oscillating bubble in the minkowski space which later develops the path in the euclidean space .",
    "the overlap of the initial particle and the bubble happens out of the real axis .",
    "let us also note that there is a possibility of the resonant decay of the particle in the false vacuum when the particle mass coincides with the energy levels of the quantized bubbles in the minkowski space .",
