    "a natural and very general extension of the einstein - maxwell lagrangian yielding a general system of equations for a non - minimal coupling between the gravitational and electromagnetic fields , with non - linear terms , was set up and studied in @xcite",
    ". within this general theory , a special theory , worth of discussion , arises when one restricts the general lagrangian to a lagrangian that is einstein - hilbert in the gravity term , quadratic in the maxwell tensor , and the couplings between the electromagnetism and the metric are linear in the curvature terms .",
    "the motivations for setting up such a theory are phenomenological , see , e.g. , @xcite for reviews and references.this theory has three coupling constants @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 , which characterize the cross - terms in the lagrangian between the maxwell field @xmath10 and terms linear in the ricci scalar @xmath11 , ricci tensor @xmath12 , and riemann tensor @xmath13 , respectively .",
    "the coupling constants @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 have units of area , and are a priori free parameters , which can acquire specific values in certain effective field theories .",
    "more specifically , the action functional of the non - minimal theory linear in the curvature is @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the determinant of the spacetime metric @xmath16 , and the lagrangian of the theory is @xmath17 here @xmath18 , @xmath19 being the gravitational constant and we are putting the velocity of light @xmath20 equal to one , @xmath21 is the maxwell tensor , with @xmath22 being the electromagnetic vector potential , and latin indexes are spacetime indexes , running from 0 to 3 .",
    "the tensor @xmath23 is the non - minimal susceptibility tensor given by @xmath24 where @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 are the mentioned phenomenological parameters .",
    "the action and lagrangian ( [ action1])-([susceptibility2 ] ) describe thus a three - parameter class of models , non - minimally coupled , and linear in the curvature @xcite .",
    "lagrangians of this type have been used and studied by several authors .",
    "the first and important example of a calculation of the three couplings was based on one - loop corrections to quantum electrodynamics in curved spacetime , a direct and non - phenomenological approach considered by drummond and hathrell @xcite .",
    "this model is effectively one - parameter since the coupling constants are connected by the relations @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 .",
    "the positive parameter @xmath3 appears naturally in the theory , and is constructed by using the fine structure constant @xmath28 , and the compton wavelength of the electron @xmath29 , @xmath30 . in these models",
    "it is useful to define a radius @xmath31 , an effective radius related to the non - minimal interaction , through @xmath32 .",
    "thus , the corresponding effective radius for the non - minimal interaction in this case , is the drummond - hathrell radius @xmath33 , given by @xmath34 . in @xcite",
    "one also finds a quantum electrodynamics motivation for the use of generalized einstein - maxwell equations .",
    "phenomenological models , i.e. , models based on external considerations to obtain the couplings , or parameters , @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 , have also been considered .",
    "prasanna @xcite wanting to understand how the strong equivalence principle can be weakly violated in the context of a non - minimal modification of maxwell electrodynamics , has shown that @xmath35 , @xmath3 a free parameter , is a good phenomenologically model .",
    "another type of requirement , one with mathematical and physical motivations , is to impose that the differential equations forming the non - minimal einstein - maxwell system are of second order ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "for instance , in @xcite , by imposing a kaluza - klein reduction to four dimensions from a gauss - bonnet model in five dimensions , thus guaranteeing second order equations for the electric field potential @xmath36 , and metric @xmath16 , it was discussed a model in which @xmath37 and @xmath38 , i.e. , with @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "so the extra non - minimal term is a kind of gauss - bonnet term , and the model is called the gauss - bonnet model .",
    "yet another type of requirement , this time purely mathematical , was suggested in @xcite .",
    "the idea is connected with the symmetries of the non - minimal susceptibility tensor @xmath23 ( see eq .",
    "( [ susceptibility2 ] ) ) .",
    "for instance , one can recover the relations @xmath37 and @xmath38 , used in @xcite , by the ansatz that the non - minimal susceptibility tensor @xmath39 is proportional to the double dual riemann tensor @xmath40 , i.e. , @xmath41 , for some @xmath42 ( see , @xcite for details and motivations ) .",
    "analogously , one can use the weyl tensor @xmath43 in the relation @xmath44 , for some @xmath45 , or the difference @xmath46 instead of @xmath40 , to introduce some new linear relations between @xmath47 , namely @xmath48 and @xmath49 . yet",
    "another type of requirement is to choose the parameters so that one obtains exact solutions . as we will see",
    "this will lead to a model with @xmath37 and @xmath9 , i.e. , @xmath5 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 . since this model is integrable",
    "we call it the integrable model",
    ". a subcase of this has additional interest and is called the fibonacci soliton .    up to now",
    "we have a theory defined through eqs .",
    "( [ action1])-([susceptibility2 ] ) , with each chosen set of values for the parameters @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 , giving a model .",
    "we have seen that the reduction from three - parameter models to one - parameter models , specified by the one parameter @xmath3 and the relations between @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 , happens in several instances , either through direct calculation , as in @xcite , or through phenomenological and other considerations , as in @xcite-@xcite or @xcite and here .",
    "this certainly simplifies the analysis , and we will consider this one - parameter type of models , in which @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 , have a specified relation to the parameter @xmath3 .",
    "for all these models , one can pick an effective radius @xmath50 , as in the drummond - hathrell case , which gives the range of the non - minimal interaction between the gravitational and electric fields .",
    "of course , @xmath31 can be set to zero , in the case the world is pure einstein - maxwell , or otherwise can have a given specified value .",
    "the radius @xmath33 defined above is a candidate but in principle not the unique choice .",
    "thus , possible estimations of the parameter @xmath3 , and so of @xmath31 , from , for instance , astrophysical observations , are undoubtedly of interest ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "now , after choosing a model , specified by @xmath3 and by the relations between @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 , it is important to study exact solutions .",
    "exact solutions of the equations of non - minimal electrodynamics in non - linear gravitational wave backgrounds were obtained in @xcite@xcite , and a non - minimal bianchi - i cosmological solution was discussed in @xcite in this context . here",
    "we want to study charged black hole and other charged solutions of non - minimal models .",
    "the reissner - nordstrm solution is a standard solution in pure einstein - maxwell theory , with two horizons , an event and a cauchy horizon , and a timelike singularity at the center ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "paradigmatic charged black hole solutions also appear in the framework of einstein theory minimally coupled to non - linear electromagnetic fields , as well as other matter fields .",
    "such solutions were found by bardeen and others @xcite-@xcite and the main feature is that they are regular , without singularities inside the horizon . within quartic gravity non - singular charged black hole solutions",
    "have also been found @xcite . since the non - minimal theory we are considering possesses new degrees of freedom , namely , the phenomenological parameter @xmath3 and its relations to @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 , we believe that these allow to introduce new aspects to the problem of finding black hole and other solutions of each chosen model .",
    "three aspects can be mentioned .",
    "first , one wants to have a gauge in order to compare the new solutions .",
    "thus , we study the reissner - nordstrm solution , the trivial solution in this context , where @xmath51 with @xmath52 , in order to understand the novel features , such as causal and singularity structure , of the new solutions .",
    "second , one should try to search for models exactly or quasi - exactly soluble .",
    "this requirement will take us , among the models cited above and the many other possible models , to two interesting models .",
    "they are , the gauss - bonnet type model where @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 , and the integrable model where @xmath5 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 . in both models",
    "we perform a detailed analysis .",
    "third , we vary @xmath3 within each of the two nontrivial models and in trying to consider non - minimal extensions of the reissner - nordstrm solution , we search for features that are similar or distinct from the two paradigmatic solutions , the reissner - nordstrm solution itself and the bardeen solutions . in our search for charged black hole solutions in non - minimal models we work in schwarzschild coordinates and impose certain requirements .",
    "the first requirement is connected with the electric field @xmath53 .",
    "we demand it is a regular function on the interval @xmath54 , the origin being also regular ( i.e. , the value @xmath55 is finite ) , and for large values of @xmath56 the electric field is coulombian , @xmath57 , where @xmath58 is the electric charge . the second requirement is concerned with the metric functions @xmath16 .",
    "these should take finite values at the center ( @xmath59 ) .",
    "horizons at @xmath60 are not excluded , and far away the solutions should be asymptotically flat . upon these conditions and solving the non - minimal equations in certain cases we will find electric charged solutions with one horizon only , thus causally distinct from the reissner - nordstrm . however , like reissner - nordstrm , the solutions have a singularity at the center , although here the singularity is spacelike instead , as the schwarzschild case , but conical , thus much milder .",
    "we have also found in one model a gravitational charged soliton , without horizons , where the fields are well behaved , apart from a mild conical singularity at the center .",
    "although this and other solutions with horizons are almost regular at the center , we have not obtained strictly non - singular black hole of the type found by bardeen and others @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the difference is based on two aspects .",
    "firstly , we consider spherically symmetric static solutions with @xmath61 , in contrast to the schwarzschild , reissner - nordstrm , and minimal regular bardeen solutions .",
    "secondly , we assume that the values @xmath62 and @xmath63 are finite , but can differ from one .",
    "moreover , we admit , that @xmath62 can , in principle , be equal to zero . this means that the scalar curvature invariants for such a metric can take infinite values at the center , and the solution of the non - minimal einstein equations is not regular at the center in this general sense .",
    "however , in many cases the singularity is a conical one , so much milder than the nasty ones of schwarzschild and reissner - nordstrm . in summary , we find charged black hole solutions different in horizon structure from the reissner - nordstrm but similar to bardeen black holes , and although singular , in certain cases can be considered quasi - regular conical singularities , in - between schwarzschild and reissner - nordstrm types of singularities and the no singularities of bardeen .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section [ genericalities ] , in particular in subsection [ genericalities2 ] , using the lagrangian formalism of the introduction , we establish a three - parameter non - minimal einstein - maxwell model . in subection",

    "it is a soliton , in the sense that is made of the very own fields of the theory , the gravitational and electric fields , it is a solution without horizons , and it is quasi - regular , with a conical singularity at the center .",
    "note also that the value @xmath405 can be regarded as a critical one .",
    "there are two reasons for this .",
    "first , it is clear from fig .",
    "[ electricfieldinnonamemodel ] , that for the unique case @xmath405 there exists a bifurcation point , in which the two branches of the curve @xmath392 , or @xmath449 , intersect .",
    "when @xmath500 , the coulombian branch of the electric field curve is discontinuous . when @xmath501 , three continuous regular branches exist .",
    "the second reason is that at @xmath405 the corresponding curve on fig .",
    "[ metricinnonnamemodel ] plays a role of a separatrix ; when @xmath502 , desirable curves , continuous and regular at the center , exist , otherwise they do not appear .      in fig .",
    "[ table ] we present a table in which the results of the various models studied are summarized .",
    "we have shown that the original non - minimal einstein - maxwell theory with three parameters @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 , is reducible in natural different ways to a theory with one parameter @xmath3 only , in which the three parameters obey two relations between themselves .",
    "we have then studied two special models for static spherically symmetric solutions obeying the following requirements : the electric field @xmath53 is regular everywhere in the interval @xmath503 , being coulombian far from the center . from the solutions of this class we extract the ones , for which the metric coefficients @xmath256 and @xmath94 are regular at the center @xmath108 and tend to one asymptotically as @xmath504 .    the first non - minimal model , the gauss - bonnet model ( with @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath3 free ) , displays charged black hole solutions with one horizon only , when the dimensionless non - minimal quantity @xmath162 , with @xmath259 naturally appearing in the model , exceeds a critical value @xmath296 , @xmath270 . although the black hole is electrically charged the solutions found have one horizon only , and are similar in this connection to the schwarzschild solution . when @xmath333 , the solutions are discontinuous in the interval @xmath503 , or irregular at the center @xmath108 .",
    "another main result in this model is that there exists a unique solution , the solution for the critical value @xmath505 , which does not possess horizons and is characterized by regular fields @xmath53 , @xmath261 and @xmath94 , with @xmath506 and @xmath507 , although the curvature invariants blow at the origin .    the second model , the integrable model ( with @xmath508 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath3 free ) ,",
    "is also characterized by one critical value @xmath509 of the non - minimal quantity @xmath162 .",
    "when @xmath267 or @xmath500 , the solutions are irregular .",
    "when @xmath502 one obtains black holes with electric field regular everywhere and with only one horizon , like the schwarzschild solution . finally , when @xmath405 , i.e. , at the critical value of the quantity @xmath162 , there exists a solitonic solution with a conical singularity at the center , but otherwise well behaved",
    "this solution can be called the fibonacci soliton , since the well - known @xmath510 number ( @xmath511 ) , associated with the golden section , appears naturally in the expressions for the central values of the electric field @xmath512 and the metric coefficients are also related to @xmath510 , namely @xmath513 and @xmath514 $ ] .    summing up , we can say that the non - minimal curvature induced interaction between the gravitational and electromagnetic fields provides an electric field , of static spherically symmetric charged objects , which is regular everywhere for different relations between the coupling constants @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 . as for additional regularity of the metric coefficients",
    "@xmath94 and @xmath93 , the non - minimal interaction can provide models which have very specific , critical , values for the coupling constants , in which the geometry has at most a conical , and thus mild , singularity .",
    "this is in line with problem posed by bardeen @xcite , where one should look for theories with regular black hole solutions .",
    "we have partially solved it within these models .",
