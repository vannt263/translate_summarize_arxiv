    "large photometric surveys have established that the observable galaxy population forms two distinct sequences in colour - magnitude space : a red sequence of predominantly early - type galaxies and a star - forming , late - type dominated blue sequence ( e.g. hogg et  al .  2002 ; blanton et  al .  2003 ; baldry et  al .  2006 ) .",
    "recent observational evidence suggests that growth of the red sequence since @xmath4 is dominated by increasing numbers of low - luminosity ( @xmath5 ) red galaxies with cosmic time at the expense of the low - luminosity star - forming galaxy population ( e.g. bell et  al .  2004 ;",
    "bundy et  al .  2006 ; brown et  al .  2007 ;",
    "faber et  al .",
    "2007 ) . hence",
    ", our understanding of growth and evolution in the red sequence is closely related to our knowledge of processes responsible for quenching star formation in blue - sequence galaxies , enabling their subsequent evolution onto the red sequence .",
    "the dichotomy of observed galaxy colours carries with it an increasingly well - described environmental dependence whereby galaxies inhabiting high - density regions are on average redder , older , more concentrated and more massive than galaxies found in the field ( e.g. oemler 1974 ; dressler 1980 ; goto et  al .",

    "this strong correlation of red - sequence galaxies with local galaxy density has led to a significant body of work devoted to exploring the environmental factors responsible for creating these predominantly red populations from the blue , star - forming population of field galaxies . of the possible mechanisms for suppressing star formation , ram - pressure stripping ( e.g. gunn & gott 1972 ; hester 2006 ) , mergers ( e.g. toomre & toomre 1972 ; negroponte & white 1983 ; somerville & primack 1999 ; mcintosh et  al .",

    "1996 ) are the most frequently invoked to account for the increasing number density of red galaxies . identifying _ which _ of these possible processes represents the dominant evolutionary path , however , remains an active field of research .",
    "the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) has proved fundamental in exploring the environmental dependence of galaxy properties , and has been used to show that the transformation of galaxies from blue to red takes place over relatively long timescales , @xmath6gyr , through the slow exhaustion of gas available for star formation , rather than rapid , violent removal ( e.g. kauffmann et  al .  2004 ; van den bosch et  al .  2008 ) .",
    "the dominance of so called `` strangulation '' ( balogh & morris 2000 ) precludes cluster - cores as dominant sites for blue galaxy transformation as disruption processes in high - density regions , e.g. ram - pressure stripping and harassment , act over relatively short timescales ( e.g. abadi , moore & bower 1999 ; quilis , moore & bower 2000 ) .",
    "this supports earlier work from the 2df galaxy redshift survey ( 2dfgrs ) which found that the fraction of star forming galaxies is lower with respect to the field even at the relatively low surface densities of loose groups , @xmath31 - 2 galaxies / mpc@xmath7 , i.e. well outside dense cluster cores ( e.g. lewis et  al .",

    "spectral analyses provide a vastly increased level of detail for determining paths of galaxy formation and evolution relative to photometry , but they are often hindered by smaller sample sizes and relatively high observational expense .",

    "an average bias was subtracted from all frames and bad pixel columns were identified and repaired .",

    "recession velocities and velocity dispersions were fit simultaneously using the penalised pixel - fitting ( ppxf ) software of cappellari & emsellem ( 2004 ) .",
    "pixel fitting methods are notoriously sensitive to the templates used , so it is important to minimise the effects of so - called template mismatch on kinematic measurements .",
    "the ppxf code is an extension of the gauss - hermite fitting method of van der marel & franx ( 1993 ) which allows for fitting to be carried out using a linear combination of template spectra , all but eliminating template - mismatch - induced errors .",
    "as our input templates we use 50 stellar spectra from the miles standard star library ( snchez - blzquez et  al .",
    "2006 ) spanning a broad range of spectral types .",
    "the particular choice of stars used to construct templates has only a minimal effect on the results derived using ppxf as long as they span a similar range of spectral types .",
    "we have investigated this briefly by fitting a sub - sample of our galaxy data with sets of 50 randomly chosen stars from the miles library and find typical deviations of @xmath34 - 5kms@xmath9 in velocity dispersion .    in order for ppxf to provide meaningful velocity dispersion outputs we need to account for the difference in instrumental dispersion between our aaomega spectra and the miles stellar library .",
    "overlap between the lick and miles stellar libraries is significant , so we have used the lick standard stars observed throughout our aaomega observing run to effectively measure the wavelength dependent broadening offset between aaomega and the miles library . in total",
    "we use 5 lick / miles stars to measure the median broadening difference .",
    "we find that scatter in our broadening measurements is significant for wavelengths below 4700 , but above this wavelength the dispersion offset is relatively stable at @xmath357.7kms@xmath9(2.3  fwhm ) .",

    "we find a mean offset between aaomega and 6dfgs spectra of 103.6kms@xmath9(4.1  fwhm ) .",
    "adding in quadrature the previously measured offset between aaomega and the miles library in this spectral region we adopt a total broadening of 118.6kms@xmath9(4.7  fwhm ) .",
    "the difference in aperture size between the 6df and aaomega fibres ( 6.7@xmath17 vs. 2.1@xmath17 ) will result in an additional broadening difference between the two galaxy spectra , independent of instrument resolution , of order 5 percent ( jrgensen , franx & kjrgaard 1995 ) .",
    "we do not take this aperture effect into account when calculating our broadening as the statistical nature of the jrgensen et  al .",
    "( 1995 ) correction will likely only serve to introduce scatter in our relatively small number of galaxies , particularly given our broad range of galaxy types .    prior to measuring kinematics using ppxf ,",
    "miles template spectra are smoothed to the aaomega and 6dfgs resolution using the measured broadening offsets .",
    "the ppxf code allows for a penalty to be applied to the higher order terms of the gauss - hermite polynomials and here we adopt a moderately high bias of 0.8 throughout fitting in order to limit spurious results from undersampled or low s / n data .",
    "random errors on our kinematic measurements are then calculated using a series of monte carlo simulations spanning a range of velocity dispersions and s / n .",
    "the scatter in our determination of instrumental broadening discussed above adds an additional , systematic uncertainty to our velocity dispersion measurements of 22kms@xmath9and 41kms@xmath9for aaomega and 6dfgs galaxies respectively , which we include in quadrature .",
    "we identify emission - line galaxies through examination of residuals to the best fit ppxf templates , and for 24 galaxies in our sample we find evidence for emission in some combination of h@xmath18 , [ oiii]@xmath19 , [ oiii]@xmath20 , [ ni]@xmath21 and [ ni]@xmath22 .",
    "while we can estimate emission - line fluxes from the residuals of our template fits , the underlying absorption in these regions is generally poorly constrained as emission contaminated lines are masked in the template fitting process .    a far more robust method is to fit for absorption- and emission - line kinematics simultaneously , which we carry out using the gandalf software of sarzi et  al .",
    "this is an extension of the ppxf pixel fitting routine described in @xmath14[rv_sig ] which fits simultaneously a set of absorption and emission templates , eliminating errors introduced by fitting emission line residuals separately .",
    "fits to emission lines are conducted using a set of independent gaussian profiles whose kinematics can be varied as required . here",
    "we treat the kinematics of nebular and balmer - line emission separately , tying each to the kinematics of the dominant features in appropriate regions of our spectra ( h@xmath18 or h@xmath0 and [ oiii]@xmath20 or [ nii]@xmath23 for balmer and nebular lines respectively ) .",
    "our choice to fit separately the kinematics of balmer and nebular emission lines has a negligible effect on our results as we find no galaxies with a significant kinematic difference between the two ( where both are detected ) .",
    "there is generally good agreement between kinematics measured using ppxf and gandalf ; the largest offsets are observed in velocity dispersion , and are only significant in galaxies with strong emission lines and relatively weak continuum flux .",
    "gandalf also allows for spectra to be cleaned of detected emission .",
    "here we follow sarzi et  al .",
    "( 2006 ) and adopt an amplitude - to - noise ( a / n ) threshold of 4 , where noise is defined as the scatter about the best - fit absorption template . as both [ ni ] and h@xmath18 emission strongly affect our lick index measurements",
    "the removal of these lines results in a significant improvement in the quality of stellar population fits for emission - line galaxies ( see discussion in section [ fitting ] ) .",
    "the approximate detection threshold of emission lines in our data can be calculated as a function of s / n using our adopted a / n and typical line broadening . if we assume a typical intrinsic line width of @xmath33050kms@xmath9 , then our sensitivity is @xmath30.6  for aaomega data and @xmath30.9  for 6dfgs data at the median s / n of our galaxy data .",
    "we use the h@xmath0/h@xmath18 balmer decrement to calculate the extinction correction for our emission - line fluxes where applicable using the @xmath24 reddening curve of cardelli , clayton & mathis ( 1989 ) and an intrinsic h@xmath0/h@xmath18 line ratio of 2.85 ( osterbrock 1989 ) . in galaxies with very low extinction",
    "the errors on our line - flux measurements can sometimes result in a negative extinction estimate .",
    "as this is clearly non - physical we adopt @xmath25 as an upper limit of extinction and assign this to galaxies with low or spurious ( i.e. negative ) extinction measurements .",
    "here we use lick absorption features ( burstein et  al .  1984 ;",
    "trager et  al .",
    "1998 ) to characterise the stellar populations of our galaxies .",
    "lick indices are defined based on their particular sensitivity to either age or metallicity , and so are useful for describing these parameters in integrated spectra .",

    "we omit from our lick index measurements fe5782 , nad , tio@xmath26 and tio@xmath27 as these fall in the wavelength range of the aaomega dichroic where sensitivity is decreasing rapidly .      in order to properly compare measured indices with ssp models it is important that the total broadening of any given absorption feature matches the wavelength - dependent broadening of the lick / ids system . galaxies with combined instrumental and velocity - dispersion broadening less than the target lick resolution are broadened as necessary using a wavelength - dependent gaussian kernel to match the description of the lick / ids resolution given by worthey & ottaviani ( 1997 ) .    in cases where the combined instrument and velocity dispersion broadening is greater than the required lick / ids system resolution",

    "photometry ( 0.5 and 0.3dex respectively , see paper i ) , we consider our star formation rates to only be proportional to the star formation activity in any given galaxy , but by no means a clear indicator of the absolute star formation rate .    in fig .",

    "motivated by the possible dependence of sfr on galaxy  icm / igm interaction , we have also examined the star formation rate relative to a simple expression proportional to the igm ram pressure , @xmath71 , where @xmath72 is the igm density and @xmath73 is the galaxy velocity @xmath74 relative to systemic group velocity @xmath75 .",

    "nevertheless , while these data do not allow us rule out the role of interactions with intragroup gas as influencing the observed star formation in these galaxies , they seem to hint that these effects are relatively limited in this case .    an alternative possibility for triggering or enhancing",
    "star formation is through galaxy  galaxy interactions .",
    "hydrodynamic simulations modelling gas have shown that tidal interactions can enhance or induce central star formation by driving gas from the disk to the central regions ( e.g. barnes & hernquist 1992 ; di matteo et  al .",
    "2007 ) , which supports observations of enhanced star formation in close pairs of galaxies ( e.g. lin et  al .  2007 ; ellison et  al .  2008 ) .",
    "an examination of dss images for the 22 galaxies with [ oii ] emission shows that only 2 galaxies , fs90 134 and fs90 137 , exhibit clear evidence for ongoing interaction .",
    "several other galaxies show some evidence of disturbed morphology ( i.e. boxy bulges and disturbed disks ) , however it appears that the majority of recent star formation activity we see in the ngc5044 group is not driven by currently ongoing galaxy  galaxy interactions .",
    "nebular metallicity and underlying , stellar metallicity are intimately related via star formation .",
    "the evolution of stellar metallicity ( as measured by absorption features ) is strictly dependent on a galaxy s star formation history , while nebular metallicities continue to vary as previous generations of stars evolve and enrich the interstellar medium .",
    "we are therefore able to use the relative offset of emission- and absorption - line metallicities to extract information related to the last significant star formation episode . here",
    "we use a reparameterisation of the kewley & dopita ( 2002 ; hereafter kd02 ) @xmath78 method presented by kobulnicky & kewley ( 2004 ; hereafter kk04 ) to derive gas - phase metallicities for a subsample of our emission - line galaxies .",
    "we exclude from this analysis galaxies exceeding the maximum starburst limit shown in fig .",
    "[ bpt ] as likely hosting agn ( ngc5044 , ngc5037 and fs082 ) .",
    "the @xmath78 metallicity calibrator is typically defined using emission line fluxes , however this requires spectra to be properly flux calibrated as line ratios spanning a significant wavelength range will otherwise be incorrect .",
    "an alternate approach is to use measurements of equivalent width in place of line fluxes to compute ew-@xmath78 , which avoids the issues of flux calibration and extinction correction , but introduces the problem of potential variation in the underlying stellar continua ( particularly between old and young spectra ) . in a statistical sense ,",
    "the variation between @xmath78 and ew-@xmath78 results in an an additional error on the final metallicity determination of @xmath30.11dex ( kobulnicky & phillips 2003 ) , however in our relatively small sample where we _ know _ the underlying stellar populations vary significantly , the uncertainty between @xmath78 and ew-@xmath78 can have a potentially significant effect on our results .",
    "considering both the wide range of spectra types and uncertain flux calibration of our data , we estimate nebular metallicities using both @xmath78 and ew-@xmath78 . since the effects of varying stellar continua and flux calibration affect emission - line metallicity measurements differently , by using both of these measurements we can assess the reliability of our conclusions .",
    "comparison of ew-@xmath78 and @xmath78 shows that the scatter between the two measures is @xmath30.08dex , or @xmath30.11dex in terms of the final determination of @xmath79 ( kobulnicky & phillips 2003 ) , which is generally less than the intrinsic error in the calibration of @xmath78 to nebular oxygen abundance . in our own data ,",
    "the scatter between ew-@xmath78 and @xmath78 is @xmath80dex , but this scatter is primarily driven by two galaxies with significant offsets between ew-@xmath78 and @xmath78 . excluding these galaxies the scatter on our data falls to @xmath30.07dex .",
    "we therefore exclude these deviant galaxies from the remainder of our emission line analyses and consider measurements on the remaining galaxies to be reliable .",

    "[ met_comp ] we show the comparison between the converted nebular metallicities and stellar metallicity .",
    "we find that , in general , derived nebular metallicities are super - solar , and in some cases nearly 1dex higher than their stellar counterparts .",
    "the relatively shallow relation between stellar and nebular metallicities is somewhat puzzling , as it implies a significantly weaker mass - metallicity relation among star - forming galaxies than is generally observed ( e.g. tremonti et  al .",
    "2004 ) .    given this somewhat curious result",
    "we are motivated to examine the relative difference between nebular and stellar metallicity as a function of other galaxy properties . in fig .",
    "[ gas_offset ] , the relative offset between nebular and stellar metallicity is plotted against galaxy stellar mass , age and @xmath0-element abundance .",
    "the relationship between metallicity offset and stellar mass in fig .",
    "[ gas_offset ] is driven primarily by the mass  metallicity relation and shows that the most massive galaxies have the lowest measured nebular ",
    "stellar metallicity offsets as a result of the relatively uniform , high nebular metallicities measured .    in terms of age , those galaxies with the lowest metallicity offsets also have the youngest luminosity - weighted ages , which is consistent with the observed stellar population forming recently from gas present in these galaxies .",
    "interestingly , while the trend of metallicity offset with age is consistent with our understanding of galaxy formation , the magnitude of this offset is large , nearly 1.5dex in the case of the lowest - mass galaxies .",
    "this offset is difficult to explain through pure passive evolution of the stellar populations in these galaxies , i.e. through enrichment from snii and snia , which in extreme cases can account for @xmath31dex of metallicity increase ( see , e.g. sansom & proctor 1998 ) .",
    "an alternate explanation is that _ ongoing _ star formation has helped to enhance the observed gaseous metallicities through the evolution of metal - enriched stars . in this case",
    "the integrated stellar populations should also appear both younger and more metal rich in those galaxies hosting the largest nebular ",
    "stellar metallicity offsets , in conflict with the trends in fig .",
    "[ gas_offset ] .",
    "finally , these data could be explained in a scenario where the gas reservoirs of low - mass galaxies are being preferentially depleted over high - mass galaxies , which would increase the effect of any subsequent enrichment due to supernovae .    in order to explain these observations in terms of gas removal , we require that the removal process must be more efficient in low - mass galaxies , ruling out agn activity as a possibility due to its strong scaling with mass .",
    "starburst outflows , primarily driven by snii , satisfy the above stated mass dependence but would also likely affect the observed [ @xmath0/fe ] ratio of stars formed from any remaining gas , in conflict with fig .",
    "[ gas_offset]c . galaxy ",
    "igm interactions such as ram - pressure stripping ( gunn & gott 1982 ) and viscous stripping ( nulsen 1982 ) satisfy both the inverse mass dependence and non - preferential gas removal ( i.e. gas - phase metals from snii and snia must be removed more - or - less equally ) stipulated by these observations . strictly speaking , we can not rule out any processes from contributing to the observed galaxy processes , however our data are best explained by galaxy  igm dominating gas removal in the ngc5044 group .",
    "in this second of two papers , we have undertaken a spectroscopic investigation of galaxies in the group environment , deriving stellar masses , ages , metallicities and @xmath0-element abundance ratios for 67 of the 111 spectroscopically confirmed ngc5044 group members described by mendel et  al .",
    "these measurements have allowed us to examine the star formation histories of these group members , both as a population in their own right and in the context of the group environment and their location in it .",
    "the mass  metallicity relation plays a fundamental role in describing galaxy populations , and we see strong evidence of this in the overall tightness of the mass  metallicity relation in our group data over multiple orders of magnitude in stellar mass . in the context of environment , by comparing the mass  metallicity relation of ngc5044 group galaxies with galaxies in the local group and the shapley supercluster , we show that galaxies appear to form a continuous mass  metallicity relation across several orders of magnitude in system mass and spanning upwards of six orders of magnitude in galaxy stellar mass .",
    "these data argue for a relative independence of the mass - metallicity relation from environment ( e.g. maiolino 2008 ; van den bosch et  al .",
    "2008 ) .    in terms of galaxy ages and @xmath0-element abundances",
    ", we find no evidence for strong trends with galaxy mass .",
    "our @xmath0-element abundance data do not rule out the interpretation of star formation efficiency as the primary driver of the mass  metallicity relation . particularly at higher stellar masses ( @xmath83 ) and metallicities , where wide separation of model grids allow for finer abundance measurements ,",
    "our data show hints of a trend of increasing @xmath0-element ratio with mass , consistent with literature results ( e.g. terlevich & forbes 2002 ; thomas et  al .",
    "we have shown that the surface described simultaneously by age , mass and metallicity is vital to analyses of galaxy data spanning a broad range in mass .",
    "most notably , mass dependence is vital to interpretation of the galaxy age  metallicity relation .    in terms of the galaxy radial distribution",
    ", we find no apparent radial dependence in either age or @xmath0-element abundances .",
    "a ks test finds that low - mass and low - metallicity galaxies have radial distributions inconsistent with their high - mass and high - metallicity counterparts , and an examination of this apparent difference shows that we observe _ no _ galaxies with @xmath84 within @xmath3100kpc projected radius from the group centre . in the context of previous analyses of the ngc5044 group , m+04 and fm05 have both noted the apparent lack of dwarf galaxies in the group s central regions using the photometric catalogue of fs90 .",
    "our spectroscopic observations confirm that the dwarf galaxy distribution observed by m+04 and fm05 is not due to the inclusion of significant foreground or background contamination in the fs90 catalogue ( see paper i ) .",
    "of the possible scenarios for explaining this deficit , the most plausible seems to be that dwarf galaxies are being tidally disrupted or destroyed through interactions with the group or central galaxy potential .",
    "our data are consistent with the simulations of fm05 in their prediction of stellar - to - total mass ratios for disrupted galaxies of @xmath85 , corresponding to @xmath86 .",
    "deep wide - field imaging is required to confirm this conclusion , as the models of fm05 predict stars from the disrupted population of dwarf galaxies to contribute nearly 35 percent of the total group luminosity , consistent with estimates of intracluster light for other groups at a similar mass ( e.g. gonzalez , zaritsky & zabludoff 2007 ) .    with regard to similar types of analyses on other groups and clusters ,",
    "coma is the only cluster analysed to a similar depth with stellar population measurements .",
    "smith et  al .",
    "( 2008a ) have examined radial gradients of coma cluster dwarf galaxies , finding strong trends towards younger ages and higher metallicities with increasing cluster - centric radii . while these results are at odds with our own , we believe this disagreement to be largely driven by the galaxy selection employed by smith et  al .",
    "( 2008a ) .",
    "the trends observed by smith et  al .  (",
    "2008a ) are consistent with the interpretation that the south - west `` infall '' region of coma has already undergone a passage through the cluster centre .",
    "observations of younger ages and higher metallicities in a `` quenched '' dwarf population would then be consistent with the idea of induced star formation from galaxy encounters with the dense / hot igm ( e.g. poggianti et  al .  2004 ) .",
    "the fact that we do not see such a trend would seem to suggest that we either fail to measure galaxies at sufficient radii to see effects of induced star formation in our galaxies , or that such dramatic interactions are not occurring within the central regions we probe here .",
    "it is worth noting that in paper i we identified a possible infalling substructure to the north - east of ngc5044 at @xmath31.4mpc projected separation , but our stellar population measurements do not extend that far and so we are unable to comment on possible trends at these large radii .    while we do not see any obvious trends of stellar populations with radius , as smith et  al .",
    "do , we do perhaps find a more subtle interpretation of galaxy evolution in the group environment through analysis of emission - line properties .",
    "comparison of emission- and absorption - line metallicities has allowed us to extract information regarding the previous star - formation episodes of galaxies through the relation of nebular and stellar metallicities .",
    "what we find is that the relative offset between these two metallicity estimates is too large to be explained by either pure passive evolution of galaxies , which can account for at most @xmath87dex of offset , or ongoing star formation , which is inconsistent with other observed galaxy properties .",
    "the mass - dependence of our emission ",
    "absorption metallicity offset instead is consistent with a scenario in which galaxies are being stripped of their gas primarily through galaxy  igm interactions , and therefore subsequent ism enrichment is having a larger effect on the observed emission - line metallicity .",
    "we require a larger sample of galaxies to confirm such an analysis , however this method provides a novel technique for probing environmental effects on galaxy evolution .",
    "we turn , finally , to the question of ngc5044 s evolution as a group and what information the galaxy population holds in this regard .",
    "the relative lack of radial trends in the stellar population data limit the extent to which the gradual accretion scheme present in semi - analytic models of group formation ( e.g. de lucia et  al .",
    "2006 ; berrier et  al .",
    "2008 ) can be acting in the ngc5044 group , at least without considerable mixing of the galaxy distribution with radius ( e.g. ludlow et  al .",
    "the large peculiar velocity of ngc5044 itself relative to the group mean ( @xmath63kms@xmath9 ) , possible presence of substructure on the outer regions of the group ( see paper i ) and recent detection of a `` sloshing '' type cold front in the group s x - ray distribution ( gastaldello et  al .",
    "2008 ) suggest that the group is still growing and in the process of relaxation . however , the group s gaussian line - of - sight velocity distribution and relatively uniform x - ray profiles argue against any recent , dynamically violent evolution of the group .",
    "the work presented here represents the first targeted effort at constraining the stellar population trends of group galaxies .",
