    "this phenomenon , known as simple aging , is observed in many glassy systems such as polymers and supercooled liquids  @xcite , as well as spin glasses  @xcite .",
    "one of the most striking manifestations of the electron glass is the anomalous field effect : after the equilibration of the sample at some gate voltage @xmath4 , subsequent traces of conductivity as a function of gate voltage keep a long - lasting memory of these equilibrium conditions in the form of a symmetric dip around @xmath4 .",

    "in anderson insulators , the unscreened coulomb interactions between the localized carriers are the crucial ingredient which lead to strong electron - electron correlations , the formation of the coulomb gap and glassy behavior . an approximate description of such systems is given by the classical lattice hamiltonian  @xcite @xmath12 where @xmath13 are the occupation numbers of randomly positioned lattice sites @xmath14 , and we fix the average occupation to @xmath15 .",

    "they predominantly differ in the bare density of states @xmath22 , see app .  [ semiconductors_models ] : in the cib the disorder @xmath18 is due to randomly distributed charged impurities , so that the disorder is of the order of the nearest neighbor interactions between carriers , and @xmath23 . in the as ,",
    "the disorder is due to strong local inhomogeneities , and can be much larger than the nearest neighbor interaction , @xmath24 . in indium - oxides , one can tune from the cib - regime ( low @xmath21 ) to the as - regime ( high @xmath21 ) by controlling the carrier density @xmath21 , the crossover occurring around @xmath25 .",

    "it is not obvious that these high density systems can still be described by the lattice model  ( [ hamiltonian ] ) , since typically the number of carriers per localization volume is larger than one .",

    "the coulomb gap fills in gradually , and is essentially smeared out for @xmath37 , even though a small depression due to coulomb correlations should persist .",
    "the presence of a coulomb gap at low temperatures leads to a crossover of the variable range hopping conductivity form motts s law @xmath38 with @xmath39 to the efros - shklovskii law @xmath40 with @xmath41 .",

    "[ theory ] , we will be concerned with the modification of the conductivity as the density of states is driven out of equilibrium by the application of a gate voltage .    for a long time , experimental evidence for the coulomb gap in doped semiconductors was only indirect in the form of the efros - shklovskii hopping law , and it is difficult to extract detailed information on coulomb correlations from the temperature dependence of the resistivity @xmath45 alone .",
    "however , _ differential _ measurements represent direct fingerprints of correlations since they are only sensitive to _ changes _ in the electron configuration as an external parameter is varied .    in the last ten years , several tunneling experiments on weakly insulating samples provided direct evidence for a pseudogap in the density of states around the fermi level  @xcite .",
    "however , such experiments are restricted to the regime relatively close to the metal - insulator transition . from this point of view",
    ", the analysis of the anomalous field effect represents a convenient method to probe coulomb correlations also deeper in the insulating regime .      a key ingredient to the understanding of the memory effect is the glassiness of the electrons at low temperatures .",
    "such a behavior can be expected from the theoretical consideration that coulomb systems are very similar to frustrated antiferromagnets , for which recent experiments have demonstrated the existence of a thermodynamic phase transition and spin - glass - like out of equilibrium behavior in almost pure samples  @xcite .    from numerical simulations , it is well established that at sufficiently low temperatures there is a multitude of metastable states , which are not ergodically connected within timescales accessible in a simulation , since they are separated by large activation or tunneling barriers  @xcite . extrapolating to experimentally relevant timescales , one expects that a dynamical glass transition takes place in real systems as well .",
    "more theoretical insight can be gained from mean - field theory  @xcite .",
    "let us first discuss the case of strong disorder ( @xmath46 ) , which corresponds to most experiments in indium - oxide ( @xmath47 ) . in 3d systems , a locator approximation to the high temperature expansion predicts a glass transition at finite temperature  @xcite @xmath48 valid for large disorder , @xmath49 .",
    "applying the same approach to 2d systems in the strong disorder limit , one obtains the prediction @xmath50    it is possible that in systems in low dimensions the sharp mean field thermodynamic transition is rounded due to activation over finite but high barriers . in this event , @xmath1 in eqs .",

    "one may therefore expect glassy behavior in strongly disordered films in a substantial range of temperatures @xmath53 where the coulomb gap is hardly developed yet .",
    "it is indeed not unusual that the glass transition occurs at a temperature where the density of states does not yet exhibit any of its prominent low temperature features .",
    "this is for example the case in the sherrington - kirkpatrick model of long range spin glasses where a linear pseudogap starts to open only well below @xmath1 .",
    "the same is predicted by the mean field solution for strongly disordered coulomb glasses .    in the case of moderate disorder ,",
    "@xmath54 ( the cib model ) mean field theory predicts a rather low glass transition temperature  @xcite in 3d , @xmath55 consistent with the small values found in simulations on irregular lattices without on - site disorder  @xcite .",
    "we expect a similar situation in weakly disordered 2d systems .    in indium - oxide films , a rapid drop of the relaxation time",
    "is observed as the carrier density is decreased below @xmath56 , while keeping the temperature constant  @xcite .",

    "the effects of the gate voltage are twofold : ( _ i _ ) the new carriers successively fill the empty ( quasiparticle ) levels close to the fermi energy , shifting the chemical potential to @xmath89 , while the minimum in the density of states remains at the old value of @xmath90 ( cf .  fig .",

    "( _ ii _ ) the assumption that the asymptotic conductivity @xmath150 is well estimated by the non - equilibrium conductivity at @xmath83 is probably incorrect at very low temperatures . in order to illustrate this point ,",
    "let us consider a large gate voltage @xmath151 with @xmath152 , such that the shift of the chemical potential is of the order of @xmath105 .",
    "this will take the system into a high energy state where fast relaxation processes lead to the formation of a new coulomb gap .",
    "the sites within the new gap will be mostly different from the sites in the old one , and it is likely that the total deficit of density of states in this new coulomb gap is initially smaller than the one in the equilibrium state .",
    "more precisely , one may expect that the linear slope @xmath153 of the density of states in the new configuration is slightly larger than that in the ground state , and the corresponding efros - shklovskii temperature @xmath154 is smaller accordingly ( see app .  [ percolationtheory ] ) .",
    "this would suggest that @xmath149 scales like @xmath155 and thus _ increases _ with decreasing temperature .",
    "in this temperature regime , one may expect an additional increase of conductivity with increasing gate voltage , even beyond the instability point @xmath83 . the description of the conductivity in that regime would require to take into account partial relaxation processes which goes beyond the present approach .",

    "moreover , from eq .",
    "( [ vins ] ) we see that the width of the memory dip should be proportional to the bare density of states @xmath157 , which increases with carrier concentration as discussed in section  [ localizedmodel ] : in the impurity band regime , @xmath158 , one expects @xmath159 , while for large carrier concentration the density of states crosses over to a free electron - like behavior @xmath160 .",
    "this scenario agrees rather well with the observed bending of the dip width as a function of carrier density in indium - oxide films  @xcite .    at high temperatures ,",
    "the percolation approach predicts a decrease of the cusp amplitude like @xmath161 , which is weaker than what is usually observed in experiments  @xcite .",

    "let us briefly discuss the effect of varying the disorder strength or applying a magnetic field .",
    "experimentally , both changes seem not to affect the width of the memory dip .",
    "furthermore , even strong magnetic fields change the amplitude @xmath149 only slightly .",
    "these experimental observations are quite surprising since both the variation of disorder and magnetic field affect the conductivity @xmath162 itself appreciably .    the first observation can be naturally explained within our picture if we assume that changing the disorder ( by annealing ) or applying a magnetic field mostly affects the localization length without altering the bare density of states @xmath22 . since the instability criterion originates from a static consideration within the classical model hamiltonian ( [ hamiltonian ] ) , it is insensitive to the localization length .",
    "the width of the memory dip remains thus constant under variations of disorder or magnetic field .",
    "the near constancy of @xmath149 with magnetic field is more subtle . in terms of the percolation approach the variation of the localization length simply changes the parameter @xmath30 , while leaving @xmath105 fixed . from fig .",

    ", the anomalous field effect maintains the characteristic width of the initial temperature @xmath164 for a rather long time before narrowing down .",
    "this effect can be understood in terms of the instability criterion proposed above : the energy minima or valleys in which the electron glass typically settles at temperature @xmath164 will be stable upon injection of additional carriers up to the critical density @xmath166 . after a temperature quench the system will in general remain in this valley , and the stability threshold of the higher temperature will be preserved temporarily .",
    "finally , slow relaxation processes allow the system to dig itself deeper down into a subvalley of the energy landscape , since the thermal fluctuations are now smaller .",
    "these lower lying states will have a reduced stability threshold , as will be reflected by a smaller dip width @xmath8 .",
    "so far , slow electronic relaxation was observed only in very few cases of moderately doped semiconductors  @xcite .",
    "the natural question thus arises as to why glassy effects , such as in indium - oxide , are not more frequently encountered .",

    "furthermore , it was found that at sufficiently high carrier densities , the density of states in the range of localized states is in surprisingly good agreement with free - electron estimates , @xmath172 this reflects the fact that the kinetic energy @xmath173 of the localized wavefunctions dominates over the effects of inhomogeneities in the electrostatic potential .",

( [ dosimp ] ) ) is to be expected around @xmath174 where @xmath175 , i.e. , @xmath176        in granular metals , the role of the localized sites in the model ( [ hamiltonian ] ) is taken by the grains . as a consequence of impurities and the disorder in the size and the arrangement of the grains ,",
    "the cost to introduce one more particle on a grain is a random quantity of the order of the typical charging energy @xmath105 or the level spacing @xmath177 in the grain , whichever is larger .",
