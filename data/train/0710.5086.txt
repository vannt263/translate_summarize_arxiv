    "the nuclei heavier than iron ( z @xmath3 26 ) are synthesized mainly by neutron - capture reactions - the astrophysical r- and s- processes .",
    "the 35 neutron deficient stable isotopes between se and hg that are shielded from the rapid neutron capture by stable isobars are classically referred to as the p - nuclei . from the current understanding ,",
    "best possible sites for the production of p - nuclei are o - ne rich layers of type ii supernova explosions .",
    "their production mechanism is understood as chains of photodisintegrations like ( @xmath2,n ) , and ( @xmath2,@xmath4 ) on r- or s- seed nuclei  @xcite .",
    "the solar system isotopic abundances of the p - nuclei are generally only in the order . for an overview on the experimental techniques , status and problems associated with p - nuclei studies , see  @xcite .    for p - process nucleosynthesis modelling ,",
    "precise knowledge of the astrophysical reaction rates is important . despite the efforts in recent years , very few experimental data for photodisintegration cross sections exist .",
    "therefore , the reaction rates presently used are based on the cross sections obtained from hauser - feshbach statistical model calculations .",
    "the aim of our experiments with real photons is to determine the cross sections experimentally to test the statistical model calculations .",
    "the present paper focuses on the results from photodisintegration studies of the p - nuclei @xmath0mo and @xmath1sm .",
    "the nuclide @xmath1sm has been in the frame of the p - process chronometer @xmath5sm  @xcite .",
    "there were several efforts to determine the @xmath5sm/@xmath1sm production ratio experimentally which varies due to uncertainties in different inputs entering into the calculation , see  @xcite .",
    "one of the important nuclear physics input is the proper optical potential at energies of astrophysical relevance which has been derived from @xmath1sm(@xmath4,@xmath4)@xmath1sm elastic scattering  @xcite .",
    "we have investigated the @xmath1sm(@xmath2,@xmath4)@xmath6nd reaction via photoactivation method for the first time . with the rapid transport system for activated samples ,",
    "the short - lived nuclides following the reaction @xmath1sm(@xmath2,n)@xmath7sm were identified .",
    "photodisintegration studies on @xmath0mo are performed aiming to test the underprediction of the mo species in the network calculations .",
    "preliminary results from @xmath0mo data have been presented  @xcite .",
    "in order to study the photodisintegration reactions on @xmath0mo and @xmath1sm , photoactivation measurements are being performed at the bremsstrahlung facility of the superconducting electron accelerator elbe ( electron linear accelerator of high brilliance and low emittance ) of fz dresden - rossendorf  @xcite .",
    "elbe delivers electron beams of energies up to 20 mev with average currents up to 1 ma which is appropriate for probing photon - induced reactions .",
    "the primary electron beam is focussed onto one of the several niobium radiators with thicknesses varying between 1.7  mg/@xmath8 and 10  mg/@xmath8 corresponding to @xmath9 and @xmath10 radiation lengths . behind the radiator",
    ", the electron beam is separated from the photons by a dipole magnet and dumped into a graphite cylinder with a conical recess .",
    "the length of the cylinder is 600 mm and diameter is 200 mm .",
    "the photoactivation site is located behind the beam dump where available photon fluxes amount up to 10@xmath11 @xmath12 s@xmath13 mev@xmath13 , see station b in fig . 1 .    in this high - flux photoactivation area , targets of mo or sm were irradiated together with au samples . at the same time",
    "another au sample was irradiated together with a @xmath14b sample at the photon - scattering site , which is separated from the high - flux site by a heavy - concrete wall .",
    "a 2.6 m long collimator placed in the wall shapes the photon beam that hits the photon - scattering target with a photon flux of about 10@xmath15 @xmath12 s@xmath13 mev@xmath13 .",
    "photons scattered from @xmath14b were measured with four high - purity germanium ( hpge ) detectors surrounded by escape - suppression shields consisting of bismuth - germanate ( bgo ) scintillation detectors .",
    "the photon flux at the photon - scattering site was determined by means of the known integrated cross sections of the states in @xmath14b depopulating via @xmath2 rays . using the known cross section for the @xmath16au(@xmath17 ) reaction and the activities of the au samples at the photon - scattering site and the high - flux site ,",
    "the activation yields of the mo and sm isotopes were deduced .",
    "the molybdenum targets used were of natural abundance ( discs with mass 2 - 4 g and diameter 20 mm ) .",
    "for the activation of samarium we used fine sm@xmath18o@xmath19 powder filled in polyethylene capsules ( mass 3 - 4 g and diameter 18 mm ) .",
    "au samples were of mass @xmath20 200 mg and were irradiated both in the photoactivation site and in bremsstrahlung cave .",
    "the number of activated nuclei produced during the activation was determined offline by measuring the decay in a low - level counting setup by hpges with an efficiency 90% or 60% relative to a 3``@xmath213 '' nai detector .",
    "an air - driven pneumatic delivery system ( rabbit system ) has been built for experiments with short - lived isotopes resulting from activation .",
    "a sketch of the setup is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : rabbitsys ] .",
    "the whole system uses compressed air to transport the samples through polyamide ( pa ) tubes with a diverter making way to the to - and - fro movement of the sample cartridges .",
    "the samples to be irradiated are enclosed in polyethylene cassettes and loaded in station a. they are shot to the high photon flux area behind the vacuum steel vessel aligned on the axis of the electron beam ( station b ) . after irradiation ,",
    "the samples are transported within about 15 s to the lead - shielded low - level counting setup where the decay is measured with a coaxial hpge detector .",
    "the loss time of 15 seconds arises from the time taken for transport of the sample plus placing the sample center above the hpge detector .",
    "the variation in horizontal positioning of the samples by the rabbit system is very small , as the samples are stopped and then pushed back into position by a slowly operating pneumatic feedthrough .",
    "after the decay measurement , samples are shot to a radiation shielded container ( depot , see figure ) .",
    "the gamma - ray spectra for an activated sample of samarium after 10 minutes of irradiation using the rabbit system is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : spectra ] . in the overlayed figure on the left panel",
    ", upper spectrum was taken 1 minute after an irradiation and the lower one after 9 minutes .",
    "the decays following @xmath1sm(@xmath2,n)@xmath22sm and @xmath1sm(@xmath2,n)@xmath7sm reactions with half - lives 66 s and 8.75 min respectively are clearly seen .",
    "the @xmath1sm(@xmath2,n)@xmath22sm reaction is identified with the unique line at 754 kev and the @xmath1sm(@xmath2,n)@xmath7sm with the lines above 1000 kev .",
    "on the right panel , exponential decay of the ground state of @xmath7sm is shown .",
    "the measured half - life is 8.83@xmath23 0.08 min which is in good agreement with the recent literature value 8.75@xmath230.08 min  @xcite .",
    "in activation experiments , the sample to be studied ( target ) is irradiated always with a gold sample as normalization standard .",
    "the reaction @xmath16au(@xmath2,n ) is well suited as a standard for activation experiments and has been measured previously by different methods  @xcite .",
    "the number of @xmath24au nuclei produced during the activation is determined by counting the gamma decay in the shielded detector setup .",
    "the absolute efficiency of the hpge detectors is based on measurements with several calibration sources from ptb and amersham ( systematic uncertainty in activity 0.6 - 1.5% ) in the energy range from 0.12 to 1.9 mev  @xcite .",
    "the sources were positioned at the same distance as the center of the irradiated samples .",
    "the effect of source extension and self - absorption of gamma - rays was determined with efftran  @xcite and geant3  @xcite simulations . for the counting geometry directly on top of the detector the efficiency of the sm@xmath18o@xmath19 samples is reduced by 3% compared to the point source value , whereas for the rabbit - system counting geometry the efficiency is reduced by 2% .",
    "coincidence summing effects are minimized by using a cd absorber with 1.5 mm thickness .",
    "they depend strongly on the decay scheme .",
    "the three dominant decay transitions of @xmath24au used for analysis are at 333 , 356 and 426 kev . for the transition at 333kev , the coincidence summing correction amounts to 24% and for 356 kev it is 6% both with a relative uncertainty of 5% .",
    "the number of radioactive nuclei @xmath25 produced in a photo - activation experiment is proportional to the integrated product of the absolute photon flux @xmath26 and the photodisintegration cross section @xmath27 with the integral limits from the reaction threshold energy @xmath28 up to the bremsstrahlung spectrum end - point energy @xmath29 .",
    "the symbol @xmath30 denotes the emitted particle .",
    "@xmath31 after irradiation , the number of radioactive nuclei @xmath32 is determined experimentally by measuring the decay using a hpge detector and the formula reads : @xmath33 @xmath34 stand for the dead - time and pile - up corrected full - energy peak counts of the observed transition , the absolute efficiency of the detector at the energy @xmath35 and the emission probability of the photon with energy @xmath36 respectively .",
    "the factor @xmath37 accounts for the decay losses during irradiation , in between irradiation and decay measurements and during the measurement .",
    "the activation yield is denoted by @xmath38 and is expressed as the ratio of the number of activated nuclei to the number of target atoms in the sample .",
    "for example , for the @xmath0mo ( @xmath2,@xmath4 ) reaction , @xmath39 the experimental data are compared to the yield integrals calculated with a simulated thick - target bremsstrahlung spectrum and photodisintegration cross sections predicted by hauser - feshbach models  @xcite .",
    "measured activation yields relative to the @xmath16au(@xmath2,n ) reaction yield for photodisintegration reactions in @xmath0mo and @xmath1sm are shown in fig .",

    "the neutron separation energy is 10.5 mev and the proton separation energy 6.7 mev .",
    "the @xmath1sm(@xmath2,n ) reaction produces @xmath7sm or @xmath22sm .",
    "since both of them are short - lived the irradiation was carried out using the rabbit system , see sect .",

    "yield agrees within 20% to the simulated yield integrals with cross sections predicted by theoretical models  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath1sm(@xmath2,@xmath4 ) reaction was identified by the transition at 1596 kev from @xmath6pr which is the short - lived daughter of the @xmath40 reaction product @xmath6nd .",
    "for @xmath1sm the @xmath41 value is -0.145 mev .",
    "half - lives for @xmath6nd and @xmath6pr are 3.37 days and 3.4 minutes respectively .",

    "[ fig : actyield ] . the preliminary experimental data for @xmath1sm(@xmath2,@xmath4 )",
    "relative yield is much below the simulated values.the theoretical models  @xcite in this case differ strongly which could be an indication for the different @xmath4-nucleus potentials entering into the calculation .",
    "the predictions given by the two models are also dependent on the different parametrization of dipole strength functions , level densities and the mass models used .",
