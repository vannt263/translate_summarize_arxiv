    "stellar clusters constitute unique laboratories for studying past and present star formation episodes in galaxies .",
    "their ages and metallicities provide valuable insights into the star formation history as well as the chemical evolution of the host galaxy .",
    "star clusters are especially important for understanding the history of galaxies beyond the local group .",
    "these galaxies are too far away for their stars to be easily resolved individually , so that most of the information is derived from the integrated properties of star clusters , especially of the brightest , most massive ones .",
    "this field has seen impressive developments during the past decade thanks to the advent of the _ hubble space telescope _ ( _ hst _ ) and large ground - based telescopes .",
    "one of the main contributions to date of the refurbished _",
    "hst _ is the discovery of young clusters with typical globular cluster ( gc ) masses in galaxies beyond the local group .",
    "while the formation of gcs was previously thought to be restricted to the early history of the universe , the discovery of such candidate young gcs shows that the formation of massive stellar clusters , with masses @xmath1 , continues today .",
    "young and/or intermediate age massive clusters , sometimes referred to as `` super star clusters '' ( sscs ) by virtue of their high luminosities , have been detected mostly in interacting and merging galaxies .",
    "the accumulation of such observations ( e.g. holtzman et al .",
    "1996 , zhang , fall & whitmore 2001 , de grijs et al .",
    "2001 ) have highlighted a clear causal link between strong starbursts on the one hand and tidal interactions ( e.g. the starburst galaxy m82 which is interacting with its spiral neighbour m81 ) and/or mergers of galaxies ( e.g. the merging pair the `` antennae '' ngc  4038/4039 ) on the other hand .    with the possible exception of the large magellanic cloud",
    ", m82 is the nearest galaxy hosting multiple populations of such massive stellar clusters , thus making it a strikingly interesting object .",
    "based on _ hst _ ( oconnell et al .",
    "1995 ) and ground - based imaging ( satyapal et al .",
    "1997 ) , a swarm of young stellar clusters have been unveiled in the central regions of m82 .",
    "the galactic centre is not the only region where prolific star formation has recently taken place , however .",
    "a region extending @xmath2  400  -  1000pc along the major axis northeast of the galactic centre , labelled m82  b ( nomenclature from oconnell & mangano 1978 ) , has long been suspected to have also gone through a major star formation episode several hundred million years ago .",
    "de grijs et al .  ( 2001 ) obtained _ hst _ multi - passband optical / near infrared observations of this fossil starburst site in which they discovered some 100 star clusters .",
    "+ in this paper , we perform a detailed study of this cluster system , highlighting its cluster formation history and its chemical evolution .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section 2 briefly describes the irregular galaxy m82 and the fossil starburst site m82  b. section 3 explains how we use spectral synthesis models to determine simultaneously the age and the metallicity of the m82  b clusters .",
    "section 4 presents the cluster formation history and the chemical evolution of the m82  b region as well as evidence for the dynamical destruction over time of the clusters .",
    "finally , our conclusions are presented in sect .",
    "m82 is the prototype starburst galaxy , being the nearest and , therefore , the best studied example of this class of galaxies .",
    "freedman et al .  ( 1994 ) estimated its distance to be 3.6mpc ( i.e. its distance modulus is @xmath3 ) .",
    "such a proximity makes it uniquely valuable for a wide range of studies regarding extragalactic star clusters .",
    "m82 belongs to the nearest group of interacting galaxies , whose other prominent members are the large spiral m81 and a fainter elliptical companion , ngc  3077 . from optical images only , this set of three galaxies appears quiescent , showing little sign of tidal interactions .",
    "however , a completely different conclusion is reached from radio surveys .",
    "a map of neutral hydrogen obtained with the _ very large array _",
    "( yun et al .  1994 ) reveals huge streams of neutral hydrogen gas connecting the three galaxies as well as several fainter ones .",
    "these hi streams are dominated by filamentary structures , loops and twists thus suggesting that the three largest members of the m81 group have gone through several close encounters .",
    "the corresponding tidal interactions have most probably triggered the formation of some of the m82 star clusters .",
    "for instance , they may be responsible for channeling large amounts of gas into the central regions of the galaxy , thus inducing the active starburst in the central regions ( rieke et al .",
    "the study of the off - centre region m82  b is particularly valuable since it has been shown to contain a more evolved star cluster system , and to have the characteristics of an older burst of star formation ( e.g. , oconnell & mangano 1978 , marcum & oconnell 1996 , de grijs et al .",
    "therefore , the study of m82 b will enable us to probe the galaxy s history to earlier times .",
    "+ starburst regions are often obscured so heavily by dust that their study at infrared wavelengths represents a definitive advantage with respect to the optical .",
    "de grijs et al .  ( 2001 ) used the _ wide field planetary camera  2 _ ( _ wfpc2 _ ) as well as the _ near - infrared camera and multi - object spectrometer _",
    "( _ nicmos _ ) , on board _ hst _ , to obtain high resolution imaging of m82  b in both the optical and the near infrared .",
    "two adjacent 35  square fields , named `` b1 '' and `` b2 '' , were imaged , the `` b2 '' region being the closest to the galactic centre and the active starburst .",
    "despite the fact that b1 and b2 simply correspond to two adjacent fields , this differentiation , i.e. m82b1 and m82b2 instead of m82b , will often be used throughout this paper as both regions show distinct differences in their chemical evolution ( see sect .",
    "4.4 ) . their _ hst _ observing run provided de grijs et al .",
    "( 2001 ) with the @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 magnitudes of the star clusters detected in m82  b. the availability of these four magnitudes allows us to disentangle the extinction , age and metallicity effects . while the way of estimating simultaneously the age and the metallicity is presented in sect .  3.1",
    ", we now briefly summarize how de grijs et al.(2001 ) derived the intrinsic colour indices of the m82  b clusters , these colour indices being used in our study .    in a @xmath8 vs @xmath9 diagram , the aging trajectories",
    "( i.e. the colour evolution with time at a given metallicity ) and the extinction vector are not entirely degenerate for this choice of optical colors , showing that the @xmath10 diagram could be used to estimate the colour excesses by which a cluster is reddened ( de grijs et al .",
    "2001 , their fig .",
    "this method also allows to derive extinction values for each cluster individually .",
    "this is useful in a galaxy like m82 , which has a significant and highly variable extinction and which can not be characterized by a single mean value for the internal extinction and reddening . assuming that the metallicity of the m82  b clusters is roughly solar , de grijs et al .",
    "( 2001 ) used this property to estimate their intrinsic colour indices , their extinction and their absolute magnitudes .    using the colour indices dereddened as explained above , de grijs et al .",
    "( 2001 ) determined the age distribution of the m82  b clusters , which contains information about the cluster formation rate .",
    "the age of the m82  b clusters ranges from 200  myr to over 10  gyr , a time interval over which clusters have been forming continuously , although not at a constant rate . the most striking feature is a strong peak of cluster formation starting about 1gyr ago and lasting about 600myr ( de grijs et al .",
    "2001 ) , a time roughly corresponding to the last perigalactic passage of m81 and m82 ( brouillet et al .",
    "the close match between both of these independently determined time - scales provides , therefore , very strong evidence that interactions between galaxies lead to enhanced star _",
    "formation .",
    "while de grijs , bastian & lamers ( 2002 ) study the dynamical history of the m82  b star cluster system in great detail , we focus on its chemical evolution . in order to carry out such an analysis",
    ", we refine the results obtained by de grijs et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , that is , we redetermine both the age and the _ metallicity _ of the star clusters .",
    "since the pioneering papers of tinsley ( 1972 ) and searle , sargent & bagnuolo ( 1973 ) , spectral population synthesis , i.e. the modeling of the spectral energy distribution of a star cluster , has become a standard technique to study the integrated stellar populations of galaxies . assuming that stellar clusters are single - age and single abundance groups of stars , their integrated colours reflect their age and metallicity ( for a given initial mass function , imf ) . + in order to perform a self - consistent comparison of our results with those obtained by de grijs et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , we use the same spectral synthesis model , i.e. the bruzual & charlot ( 1996 , hereafter bc96 ) model .",
    "we consider the photometric properties of simple stellar populations ( ssps ; i.e. single - age and single abundance groups of stars ) with a salpeter imf from 0.1m@xmath11 up to 125m@xmath11 .",
    "bc96 provides the temporal evolution of the broad - band colours of such ssps for a wide range of metallicities . in the following , we consider the three intrinsic colour indices @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 whose observational counterparts were obtained by de grijs et al .",
    "we show below how the addition of the @xmath14 colour index enables us to estimate both the age and the metallicity of the clusters .",
    "a greater age or a higher metallicity both lead to redder colours , an effect known as the age - metallicity degeneracy .",
    "for instance , in a @xmath12 versus @xmath13 plot , the iso - metallicity tracks ( i.e. the locus of an ssp at different ages for a given metallicity ) and the isochrones are parallel and located in the same part of the optical colour - colour diagram , precluding therefore any simultaneous estimate of age and metallicity .",
    "de grijs et al .",
    "( 2001 ) also obtained the _",
    "j_-band magnitude for each cluster .",
    "figure 1 explores the suitability of a @xmath15 colour - colour diagram to lift this age - metallicity degeneracy .",
    "thin lines represent isometallicity tracks , i.e. aging trajectories , and thick lines refer to isochrones ( from left to right , log@xmath16=8.5 , 9.0 , 9.5 and 10.0 ) .",
    "the grid defined by the isometallicity tracks and the isochrones shows that a @xmath14 vs @xmath13 diagram is well suited to disentangle the effects of age and metallicity . + as mentioned in sect .  2 , the cluster intrinsic colours were determined by de grijs et al .",
    "( 2001 ) based on the hypothesis that the metallicity of the clusters in m82  b was roughly solar .",
    "however , the next section shows that m82  b hosts very metal - poor ( z @xmath17 0.02z@xmath11 ) and super - solar abundance ( z @xmath18 z@xmath11 ) clusters in addition to solar abundance ones .",
    "therefore , one can question the validity of the present analysis which makes use of the intrinsic colours determined by de grijs et al .",
    "the solar metallicity track and the extinction trajectories being not entirely degenerate in a @xmath12 vs @xmath13 diagram , de grijs et al .",
    "( 2001 ) were able to estimate the visual extinction and the colour excess for each cluster ( see sect .  2 ) .",
    "furthermore , the iso - metallicity tracks are at the same locus of the diagram , with the distance between two subsequent tracks of distinct metallicity being smaller than the photometric uncertainties . as a consequence , the visual extinction values and the colour excesses ( or , equivalently , the intrinsic colours ) estimated by de grijs et al .",
    "( 2001 ) on the basis of the solar metallicity hypothesis , can be used throughout this work irrespective of the metallicity of the clusters .",
    "[ fig : vij ]      the medians of the @xmath19 error distributions for the different colour indices are @xmath20 0.08 , @xmath21 0.08 and @xmath22 0.15 .",
    "let us first assume that the uncertainties of the observed colours constitute a good approximation of the intrinsic colour uncertainties .",
    "the typical uncertainties in @xmath9 and @xmath23 are superimposed on the age - metallicity grid in fig .  1 for the solar metallicity ssps of 600myr and 10gyr",
    ". the corresponding uncertainties in age are the smallest for ssps with ages from 300myr to 1gyr .",
    "for instance , for an ssp of solar metallicity the typical error in the estimated age is not greater than 40% at an age of 600myr , while it is as large as a factor of 2 for a 10gyr old ssp .",
    "this greater uncertainty at greater age , which is related to the tightening of the isochrones at log @xmath24 in the @xmath15 diagram , is another aspect of the decrease in sensitivity of the colour indices to ages as an ssp ages ( e.g. worthey et al .",
    "interestingly , the diagram shows the greatest sensitivity to ages within the time interval of interest to us , namely the age of the burst of cluster formation at @xmath25 .",
    "+ as for the accuracy of the metallicity estimates , the differences in the @xmath14 colour index between the isometallicity tracks z = z@xmath11 , z=0.4z@xmath11 and z=0.2z@xmath11 are of a similar order of magnitude as the uncertainty @xmath26 so that we can not easily distinguish among such close - to - solar metallicities based on the available data set . however , the @xmath15 colour - colour diagram can , in fact , be used to distinguish solar metallicity sscs from very metal - poor ( i.e. z=0.02z@xmath11 ) and super - solar abundance ( i.e. z @xmath18 z@xmath11 ) populations .",
    "we caution however that this reasoning does not take into account the _ extinction _ uncertainties .",
    "figure 1 displays the extinction vector in the @xmath15 diagram and clearly shows that extinction uncertainties can not be neglected as they will combine with the colour uncertainties quoted above to enlarge the error boxes in fig .  1 .",
    "this reasoning therefore applies only to clusters whose intrinsic and observed colours are not significantly different . in sect .",
    "4.2 , we will estimate in a more careful way how the magnitude uncertainties ( i.e. @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 ) propagate as extinction , age , mass and metallicity uncertainties .",
    "in this section , we estimate the age , the metallicity and the mass - to - light ratio of the m82  b clusters by comparing their extinction - corrected colours to those predicted as a function of age and metallicity by bc96 .",
    "we will then derive the cluster formation history of the m82  b region .",
    "the age ( @xmath31 ) and the metallicity ( @xmath32 ) of each stellar cluster are estimated simultaneously by means of a least - squares minimisation : @xmath33    @xmath34   t@xmath35 and z@xmath35  .    in this relation ,",

    "3 ) , the mass - to - light ratio predicted by the bc96 model we use assumes a salpeter imf . however , there is now ample evidence that a single power - law salpeter imf can be ruled out at masses lower than 1m@xmath11 , the imf slope becoming clearly much shallower than the salpeter imf .",
    "for instance , the imf observed in the solar neighbourhood may be roughly flat at the lower end of the stellar mass spectrum or may even peak at a mass around 0.25m@xmath11 and decline into the brown dwarf regime ( larson 1998 ) .",
    "the salpeter imf obviously overestimates the relative number of subsolar - mass stars .",
    "these stars being those with the largest mass - to - light ratio , a salpeter imf causes an overestimate of the individual cluster masses , _ although the relative mass distribution of our entire cluster sample remains unaffected_. if we had used more modern imfs ( e.g. kroupa , tout & gilmore 1993 ) this would have resulted in lower cluster mass estimates , by a factor @xmath17 2 - 3 ( see de grijs et al .",
    "2002 ) with respect to the mass estimates presented in this paper . + our best age , mass and metallicity estimates for each cluster , along with their uncertainties ( see the following section ) are listed in tables 1 and 2 for b1 and b2 , respectively .",

    "our photometric mass estimates show an accuracy of well within an order of magnitude .",
    "tables 1 and 2 show that the mass estimates are more robust than the age estimates ( see also fig .",
    "this pattern comes from the combination of two effects .",
    "firstly , the mass - to - light ratio grows with time at a slower rate than time itself ( i.e. the evolution of @xmath79 vs @xmath58 exhibit a linear behaviour with a slope of less than unity , see bc96 ) .",
    "in addition , the impact upon the mass estimate of mass - to - light ratio variations is partially counterbalanced by extinction variations . in order to illustrate this ,",
    "let us consider a cluster for which the extinction has been overestimated .",
    "the adjustment of the extinction to a more appropriate ( i.e. lower ) value leads to a smaller cluster intrinsic brightness which , alone , would lower the photometric mass estimate .",
    "at the same time however , the extinction decrease causes a rise of the cluster age estimate ( see the extinction vector in fig .  5 ) and , therefore , an increase of the cluster mass - to - light ratio . these effects , a luminosity decrease and a mass - to - light ratio increase , act upon the mass estimate in opposite ways .",
    "for instance , considering a roughly solar metallicity model , a decrease of 0.6magnitude in @xmath80 causes an age increase of @xmath81 at the time of the burst ( see fig .  5 ) .",
    "accordingly , the mass - to - light ratio grows by a factor of @xmath17 2.7 .",
    "the new mass estimate is thus larger than the previous one by a factor 2.7/2.5@xmath82 . in summary , while an age increase leads to a growth of the mass estimate through the age dependent mass - to - light ratio , this mass increase is reduced by a decrease in extinction , which acts in the opposite way .",
    "it is worth to mention that this extinction - induced reduction of the mass variation is not so important for intermediate and old populations .",
    "in fact , due to the tightening of the isochrones at older age ( see fig .",
    "5 ) , a given extinction variation corresponds to a greater age range at older age than at the burst epoch and , therefore , to a larger mass - to - light ratio variation .",
    "the relative reduction of the mass uncertainty thanks to the extinction variation is thus much weaker at old age than at the burst age .    as a result of the variations with time of the mass - to - light ratio , the lower and upper mass limits",
    "are strongly coupled to the lower and upper age limits , respectively .

    "clusters have been forming continuously , their age ranging from more than 10gyr down to about 10myr .",
    "in addition , the b1 and b2 regions exhibit a period of enhanced cluster formation , from about 1.5gyr ago until 500myr ago .",

    "the m82  b burst was followed by a sharp decline in the cluster formation rate .",
    "less than one fifth of the clusters are younger than 500myr .",
    "starbursts are likely to be strongly self - limited by supernova - driven outflows which remove the remaining cool gas from the immediate starburst region .",
    "it is interesting to note that the b2 region , which is closer to the active starburst , has formed a few clusters more recently than b1 .",
    "+ it has long been suspected that the tidal interactions between the m81 group members ( i.e. m81 , m82 and ngc  3077 ) are responsible for the starburst nature of m82 and for the hi bridges connecting these galaxies .",
    "brouillet et al .  (",
    "1991 ) used an n - body model , representing m81 , m82 and ngc3077 , to simulate the deformations of the neutral hydrogen distribution due to the tidal interactions : their results reproduce the observed hi bridges and tails rather well . according to their simulation , the last perigalactic passage of m82 and m81 took place some 500myr ago .",
    "the onset of the burst about 1.5gyr ago is thought , therefore , to coincide with the beginning of the tidal interactions between m82 and its prominent neighbour m81 .",
    "the m82  b cluster system is characterized by a wide range of metallicities ( see fig .",
    "3 ) as it hosts both very metal - poor clusters ( z@xmath170.02z@xmath11 ) and super - solar abundance ones ( z@xmath18z@xmath11 ) .",
    "such a pattern must be related to the region s chemical evolution . in order to illustrate this , each panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : histo_feh ] shows the cluster age distribution at a given metallicity for regions b1 ( left column ) and b2 ( right column ) .",
    "the metallicities shown are , from top to bottom , @xmath83 , @xmath84 , @xmath85 , @xmath86 , @xmath87 , @xmath88",
    ". +    from the birth of its first clusters until about 1gyr ago , m82  b formed clusters with roughly solar and subsolar metal abundances only . in both subregions b1 and b2 , the formation of the first clusters with significantly super - solar ( i.e. @xmath89 ) metallicities coincides with the onset of the burst .",
    "the stellar ejecta from the evolution of older stars have most probably contributed to the chemical enrichment .",
    "+ while this chemical evolution up to super solar metallicities at the burst epoch is a feature in common for b1 and b2 , both subregions nevertheless exhibit a striking difference regarding the most metal - poor clusters . at the time of the burst , and despite the chemical enrichment noticed above , b2 managed to form a significant subpopulation of very metal - poor clusters ( i.e. @xmath90 ) with respect to b1 ( top panels in fig .",
    "we stress that half of these b2 clusters have very well - constrained ages ( @xmath91 ) and metallicities ( @xmath92 ) , so that we probably do not face a spurious effect .",
    "either some interstellar gas in b2 managed to escape the chemical enrichment driven by the older stellar populations , or alternatively some `` fresh '' metal - poor gas was injected into the b2 region shortly before the burst . whereas the first scenario is hard to explain , the second is more appealing .",
    "a large amount of circumgalactic cold material is orbiting m82 , stripped from the gas - rich outskirts of the m81 group spirals by tidal interactions .",
    "these interactions involve quite a few galaxies , of which three are of a non - negligible size ( i.e. m81 , m82 and ngc3077 ) .",
    "it is therefore not unreasonable to assume that tidal interactions and gas tidal stripping were at least somewhat important even before m81 and m82 almost collided about 0.5gyr ago .",
    "if the bridges of circumgalactic gas were indeed already present 1gyr ago ( i.e. 500myr prior to the perigalactic passage ) , gas infall from this reservoir onto the b2 region may have induced the formation of this subpopulation of metal - poor clusters .",
    "alternatively , some metal - poor gas associated with the m82 outskirts could have been driven onto b2 by tidal interactions .    in comparing the properties of the clusters of b1 with those of b2",
    ", we implicitely assume that their respective current and birth locations , with respect to the galactic centre , coincide .",
    "the validity of this assumption may be questioned as , at the distance from the centre of region b , one would expect m82 s differential rotation ( shen & lo 1995 ) to have caused the starburst area to disperse .",
    "however , the lack of bright clusters like those in m82  b outside this region does not meet this expectation and , on the contrary , indicates that the fossil starburst region has remained relatively well constrained .",
    "the reason for this is likely found in the complex structure of the disc .",
    "it is well - known that the inner @xmath93 kpc of m82 ( i.e. the radial extent of m82  b ) is dominated by a stellar bar ( e.g. , wills et al .",
    "2000 ) in solid - body rotation . from observations in other galaxies",
    ", it appears to be a common feature that central bars are often surrounded by a ring - like structure .",
    "if this is also true for m82 , it is reasonable to assume that stars in the ring are trapped , and therefore can not move very much in radius because of dynamical resonance effects . as a consequence , not only has the fossil starburst site managed to stay together , both subregions b1 and b2",
    "may also have conserved their own specificity for about 1gyr ( see also de grijs 2001 ) . in the next section ,",
    "we show that the presence ( b2 ) , or the absence ( b1 ) , of a subpopulation of very metal - poor clusters at the burst epoch is not the only difference between b1 and b2 .",
    "a high - pressure medium favours the formation of pressure - bound clouds , which may be the progenitors of future stellar clusters .",
    "for instance , fall & rees ( 1985 ) suggested that the formation of the halo gcs in our galaxy occured in dense and cold clouds which are in pressure equilibrium with a hot and diffuse background .",
    "this two - phase medium is thought to have been formed by the collapse of the protogalaxy . in the frame of their theory ,",
    "the gc progenitor clouds are thermally supported and made of primordial gas .",
    "to explain the metallicities of the galactic halo gcs , parmentier et al .",
    "( 1999 ) further developed this picture for gc formation and proposed that the halo gc gaseous progenitors went through a self - enrichment phase .",
    "a self - enrichment scenario assumes the formation of a first generation of stars in the central regions of each proto - globular cluster cloud .",
    "when the massive stars explode as type ii supernovae , they chemically enrich the surrounding cloud gas and trigger the formation of a second stellar generation , more metal - rich than the first one .",
    "these second generation stars form the proto - globular cluster .",
    "supernovae having long been thought to disrupt the cloud of gas out of which they have formed , parmentier et al .",
    "( 1999 ) studied the ability of pressure - truncated clouds to retain supernova ejecta and further showed that such a process is able to explain galactic halo gc metallicities .",
    "assuming that the number of supernovae is the maximum number predicted by their model ( i.e. a few hundred ) , a self - enrichment episode in pressure - bound clouds shows up as a correlation between the mass and the achieved metallicity of the progenitor cloud in the sense that the least massive clouds are the most metal - rich .",
    "such a trend emerges because if the bound pressure is higher , the mass of the pressure - truncated cloud will be lower , and its ability to retain supernova ejecta will be greater . regarding the resulting system of gcs , a tight mass - metallicity correlation should not be expected , however .",
    "the star formation efficiency ( i.e. the ratio between the mass of the second stellar generation and the mass of gas ) and the number of supernovae ( which determines the amount of metals dispersed within the cloud ) may vary from cloud to cloud , imprinting therefore a scatter on the initial mass - metallicity correlation ( see parmentier & gilmore 2001 for a more detailed discussion ) . in spite of this scatter , parmentier & gilmore ( 2001 ) showed that such a mass - metallicity correlation is statistically present in the milky way old halo , i.e. the group of old and coeval halo gcs ( e.g. rosenberg et al .",
    "1999 ) . at this stage",
    ", it is worth keeping in mind that the search for a mass - metallicity relation must be restricted to a coeval population of clusters .",
    "the ( surviving ) correlation primarily reflects the variations in the pressure by which the clouds are bound and has nothing to do with the chemical enrichment with time .",
    "+ both the m82 interstellar medium and the hot protogalactic background are high - pressure mediums . therefore , a tempting question is whether the almost coeval population of clusters formed during the burst ( 0.5 @xmath94 1.5gyr ) have undergone a self - enrichment process in pressure - truncated progenitor clouds .",
    "these m82  b clouds were most likely mainly supported by non - thermal effects ( e.g. turbulence and magnetic fields ) and resembled more closely giant molecular clouds than the neutral hydrogen clouds described by the fall & rees ( 1985 ) theory .",
    "as mentioned above , however , the key parameter leading to a trend between the mass and the metallicity of stellar clusters is the pressure of the medium in which their progenitor clouds were embedded .",
    "it is widely believed that the boundary of giant molecular clouds is set by pressure balance with the surrounding , more diffuse , interstellar medium ( e.g. mclaughlin & pudritz 1996 ) .",
    "therefore , the hypothesis of a mass - metallicity relation among the clusters of the m82  b system makes sense . in order to explore the possibility of a self - enrichment event ( superimposed on an unavoidable pre - enrichment phase owing to the young age of the clusters ) , we now search for such a mass - metallicity correlation among the @xmath171gyr old clusters in the b1 and b2 regions .",
    "again , b1 and b2 exhibit different patterns ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : zlogm_bb ] , b1/b2 : top / bottom panel ) .",
    "the b1 sample shows a mass - metallicity correlation in the sense expected by the self - enrichment model , i.e. the most metal - rich clusters are , on average , least massive : the linear pearson correlation coefficient is @xmath950.70 , corresponding to a correlation probability of @xmath96 = 99.5% .",
    "the scatter in metallicity at a given mass interval ( e.g. @xmath97 ) remains significant but this is not unexpected because of the scatter sources mentioned above .",
    "the age of the vast majority of the b1 burst clusters is well constrained ( @xmath98 for 11 of the 13 clusters ) and so is their mass ( see the horizontal error bars in the top panel of fig .  7 ) .",
    "in addition , the metallicity error bars are rather limited as well . as a result , the error bars , both in mass and metallicity , do not significantly corrupt the correlation .",
    "+ in contrast to b1 , the b2 burst clusters do not exhibit any mass - metallicity correlation . removing the most metal - poor clusters",
    "( i.e. those assumed to have formed from circumgalactic gas ) does not change the situation .",
    "this difference between the b1 and b2 mass - metallicity diagrams might be related to the formation of some metal - poor clusters in b2 at the burst epoch .",
    "if these low metal abundance clusters indeed formed out of the arrival of `` fresh '' gas , a shock wave would have accompanied the gas injection , perturbing the external pressure and preventing therefore any self - enrichment in pressure - bound clouds .",
    "+ while the scenario presented above is tentative , the fact that b1 and b2 exhibit different behaviours from the points of view of the chemical evolution ( top panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : histo_feh ] ) and of the mass - metallicity relation ( fig .",
    "[ fig : zlogm_bb ] ) is puzzling and suggests actual differences between the cluster formation histories in both regions at the time of the burst .",
    "+      [ fig : logmlogt ]    figure 8 shows the evolution with time of the mass of the clusters in b1 and b2 .",
    "the most striking feature is the deficit in low - mass clusters ( i.e. @xmath99 ) during the pre - burst phase ( log@xmath38/yr @xmath100 ) with respect to the burst period .",
    "however , this effect is likely mainly caused by an observational bias , that is , due to the fading of stellar populations with time low - mass clusters are more difficult to detect at old and intermediate age than at young ages ( see also de grijs et al .",
    "+ in order to consider only cluster candidates with good photometry , de grijs et al .",
    "( 2001 ) selected clusters brighter than @xmath101  22.5 ( corresponding to the 100% completeness limit ) .",
    "the equivalent upper limit in absolute visual magnitude is @xmath1025.3 .",
    "the temporal evolution of the corresponding lower mass limit is shown as the solid line in the two panels of fig .",
    "this fading line is based on the mass - to - light ratio predicted by the bc96 model for a metallicity of z@xmath17  0.02z@xmath11 .",
    "we can afford to use a model with such a low metallicity , and therefore a low mass - to - light ratio , since very metal - poor clusters are detected at any age up to the burst epoch .",
    "a comparison of the fading line with the distribution of points in top and bottom panels of fig .",
    "8 shows that the deficit in low - mass clusters at large age can not be accounted for solely by the selection effect , especially in b1 .",
    "systems of young clusters are well known to show a cluster initial mass function scaling as @xmath103 , where @xmath43 is the cluster initial mass and @xmath104 is the number of clusters with mass between @xmath43 and @xmath105 .",
    "observations show that the slope @xmath106 is @xmath107 ( zhang & fall 1999 ; whitmore et al .",
    "1999 ; bik et al .",
    "2002 ; see also sect .",
    "4.6 ) . at an intermediate age of 5gyr ( log@xmath108 ) , the mass detection threshold is @xmath109 ( log@xmath110 ) .",
    "if the cluster initial mass function had remained unaffected ( above the fading line ) , the ratio between the number of clusters with masses @xmath111 and the number of clusters with masses @xmath112 would be @xmath113 to make use of the solar metallicity model raises the fading line by @xmath114 at most in the @xmath115 vs @xmath58 plot through an increase of the metallicity dependent mass - to - light ratio .",
    "this therefore leads to a decrease in the number of detectable clusters whose mass is lower than @xmath116 . even in that case",
    "however , the proportion between the number of high - mass clusters ( @xmath117 ) and the number of lower - mass clusters ( i.e. clusters whose mass is larger than the solar metallicity fading line and lower than @xmath118 is still @xmath119 .",
    "there is an obvious discrepancy between these theoretical ratios , whatever the metallicity of the fading line , and the observed ratios as the majority of the clusters in the pre - burst phase have masses greater than @xmath120 . we emphasize here that the mass error bars do not affect this outcome significantly .",
    "for instance , let us consider the old and high - mass cluster , b1 - 36 ( @xmath121 , @xmath122 ; see table 1 ) .",
    "the rather large mass error bar suggest that its mass may be as low as @xmath123 , so that it may contribute to the low - mass clusters of the pre - burst phase .",
    "however , its age and its mass errors are strongly correlated through the age - dependent mass - to - light ratio , that is , the lower mass limit is coupled with the lower age limit ( @xmath124 ) and not with the best age estimate ( see sect .  4.2 ) . as a result",
    ", the high - mass clusters whose minimal estimate is lower than @xmath125 are not expected to contribute to the low - mass clusters class of the pre - burst phase .",
    "+ the depletion in low - mass clusters at intermediate age shown by fig .",
    "8 is a real effect and illustrates the dynamical evolution of the m82  b cluster system .",
    "the disruptive processes working on time - scales on the order of a hubble time include the tidal interactions between the clusters and the gravitational field of the parent galaxy and the evaporation through two - body relaxation within clusters , the latter being enhanced by the former .",
    "they affect mostly the low - mass clusters ( e.g. gnedin & ostriker 1997 , de grijs et al .",
    "the detection of such evolutionary effects is not unexpected because of the dense environment achieved in this fossil starburst of the low - mass galaxy m82 .",
    "a similar cluster disruption time - scale was derived in the dense centre of the massive spiral m51 ( boutloukos & lamers 2002 ) .",
    "furthermore , de grijs et al .  (",
    "2002 ) show that the mean densities in m82  b and in the centre of m51 are remarkably similar , within an order magnitude .",
    "this therefore suggests that cluster disruption time - scales are primarily driven by the density of the environment in which the clusters are embedded , irrespective of the mass of the host galaxy .",
    "such a result is not unexpected .",
    "the cluster stars which venture to large enough distance from the cluster centre are stripped off due to the tidal influence of the host galaxy , leading to a cluster which is tidally truncated at a finite tidal radius @xmath126 given by : @xmath127 where r is the galactocentric distance of the cluster and @xmath128 is the mass of the galaxy within @xmath129 . equation ( 12 ) also implies that the density of a gc , @xmath130 , can not be less than three times the average density of the host galaxy inside @xmath129 , @xmath131 , that is @xmath132 . if its orbital motion drives the cluster towards higher density regions of the host galaxy , the corresponding shrinkage of the cluster tidal radius causes a runaway tidal stripping of the outer cluster stars , thus decreasing the cluster mass and making it even more sensitive to the galactic tidal field .",
    "ultimately , this may lead to the cluster s disruption .    even in the magellanic clouds ( mcs ) , which constitute environments dynamically and tidally more gentle than m82  b and m51 ,",
    "do low - mass clusters dissolve with time through normal internal process . due to the smaller ambient density ,",
    "the time - scale for depleting low - mass clusters is not that short in the mcs however : clusters with masses between @xmath133 and @xmath134 survive for a few gyr ( elson & fall 1985b , 1988 , mackey & gilmore 2002a , b ) , which is not the case in m82  b. in the next section , we show that the depletion of low - mass clusters in m82  b is already at work at the burst time .",
    "[ fig : mf ]    figure 9 displays the cluster mass functions for b1 and b2 combined .",
    "we have considered the clusters with ages 8.6 @xmath135 log@xmath16 @xmath135 9.1 . to include older clusters in our sample",

    "the relation between the disruption time - scale and the cluster mass mentioned above shows that significant disruption must have already affected clusters with masses below 5.9 @xmath138 10@xmath139m@xmath11 . for the clusters formed at @xmath140=9.1 ( i.e. almost at the onset of the burst )",
    ", the same relation indicates that the upper mass of the clusters significantly affected by disruption is even greater , i.e. 3.8 @xmath138 10@xmath141m@xmath11 .",
    "thus , the dynamical destruction processes have strongly altered the whole range of the initial mass function of the m82  b clusters with ages 8.6 @xmath135 log@xmath16 @xmath135 9.1 . as a result , the current mass spectrum of these clusters ( see fig .",
    "9 ) no longer represents the formation conditions of the cluster system .",
    "+ in galaxies hosting systems of young clusters for which deep _ hst _ observations are available , the cluster luminosity functions do not show strong evidence for any turnover .",

    "the stellar ejecta from older stellar populations have most probably enriched the interstellar medium out of which the 1gyr old clusters formed . at almost the same time however , a subpopulation of very metal - poor clusters formed in b2 , i.e. the part of m82  b nearest the galactic centre . their formation may have been stimulated by infall , onto b2 , of `` fresh '' circumgalactic gas which had escaped the chemical enrichment of the interstellar medium while orbiting m82 .",
    "the clusters in b1 , the eastern part of m82  b , may have been self - enriched at the time of their formation since they show a mass - metallicity correlation in the sense expected by simple self - enrichment models applied to pressure - truncated clouds . in b2 however , a clear - cut relation does not show up .",
    "due to the infall of circumgalactic gas , the pressure may not have been stable enough to allow the formation of pressure - bound clouds .",
