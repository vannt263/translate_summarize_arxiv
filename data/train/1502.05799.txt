    "<S> we present a general framework for contextuality tests in phase space using displacement operators . </S>",
    "<S> first , we derive a general condition that a single - mode displacement operator should fulfill in order to construct peres - mermin square and similar scenarios . </S>",

    "<S> the concept of contextuality highlights the fundamental departure of the quantum description of the world from that of classical models . in everyday life </S>",
    "<S> , the result of a measurement occurs irrespectively of which other compatible measurements ( the so - called  context \" ) are simultaneously measured together with it . </S>",
    "<S> quantum mechanics , however , as originally shown by kochen and specker @xcite , does not allow the noncontextual assignment of values to physical quantities , giving rise to testable differences in predictions of quantum and noncontextual theories @xcite , as in bell s theorem @xcite ( locality being a special case of noncontextuality ) . </S>",
    "<S> remarkably , this can happen irrespectively of the quantum state , i.e. , state - independent contextuality ( sic)@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> contextuality has been confirmed in experiments with genuine microscopic systems , such as two qubits @xcite and qutrits @xcite , and it has been recognized as a critical resource for quantum computing @xcite and for several quantum information - theoretic tasks @xcite . recently , there has been a growing interest in exploring quantum features such as quantum superposition closer to the classical realm . along this line , a far - reaching attempt , perhaps , is to experimentally probe the quantum contextuality in continuous variable systems with most  classical - like \" operations in phase space .    </S>",
    "<S> phase space displacement operators exhibit favorable properties , making them very suitable for investigating contextuality in phase space . </S>",
    "<S> for one thing , their phase space functions given by weyl - wigner correspondence are bounded and , thus comply with the explicit assumption used for the derivation of the existing noncontextuality inequalities in which the classical variables take on a limited range of values . </S>",
    "<S> this is in contrast to , e.g. , parity operators as they are described by an unbounded delta function in phase space . </S>",
    "<S> that is why parity correlation measurements can lead to the violation of bell s inequality for states represented by positive wigner functions @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , displacement operators , unlike quantum operations such as kerr nonlinearities , do not transform coherent states into nonclassical states characterized by negative - valued wigner functions . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , displacement operators reveal a characteristic geometrical feature of quantum mechanics in phase space originated from the canonical commutation relations between position and momentum operators .    in this letter </S>",
    "<S> , we present a general approach to quantum contextuality in phase space , and in particular to sic . </S>",
    "<S> this is done by giving an explicit recipe to witness sic in continuous variable systems . </S>",
    "<S> our results include as a special case a previous proposal of observing quantum contextuality in infinite dimensions @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> our approach offers a simple and optimal scheme for experimental implementations of the tests via measurements of modular variables , i.e. , the hermitian components of the displacement operator . modular variables play a significant role in various tests of quantum nonclassical effects , such as the ghz theorem @xcite , macroscopic realism @xcite and entanglement detection @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> _ preliminary notions. _ let us consider nine dichotomic observables @xmath0 , @xmath1 , such that triplets of observables sharing a common index @xmath2 or @xmath3 are compatible . here </S>",
    "<S> , compatibility means that they can be measured jointly or sequentially without disturbing each other . in quantum mechanics </S>",
    "<S> this is , for instance , the case if the observables commute . </S>",
    "<S> thus , we can measure the following mean values @xcite : @xmath4 such conditions are satisfied by the following choice of @xmath5 , also known as peres - mermin ( pm ) square  @xcite , @xmath6 leading to a value of @xmath7 , for any quantum state , since the product of operators along each row and column is @xmath8 , except in the last column , where it is @xmath9 . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> the maximal value of @xmath10 is 4 for all noncontextual hidden variable ( nchv ) theories , i.e. , classical probability theories assigning a definite @xmath11 value to each observable independently of the measurement context . </S>",
    "<S> this can be verified by a direct substitution of all possible @xmath12 values . </S>",
    "<S> hence , the pm square exhibits sic .    to obtain the same construction in phase space , </S>",
    "<S> we introduce the single - mode displacement operator , @xmath13 , where @xmath14 ( @xmath15 ) is the creation ( annihilation ) operator of a single bosonic mode and @xmath16 is a complex displacement amplitude . by using the baker - campbell - hausdorff formula , i.e. , @xmath17/2}$ ] , where @xmath18 $ ] is a constant , </S>",
    "<S> we obtain the known relations @xmath19 and @xmath20 the phase factor indicates that displacements in different directions do not commute in general .     which span a triangle of area @xmath21 and </S>",

    "<S> this constraint yields the following algebraic relations for the displacement operators similar to pauli matrices , namely , @xmath29 a simple example satisfying condition is given by amplitudes @xmath30 with equal lengths @xmath31 and rotated by an angle @xmath32 with respect to each other . as we will show below , this condition also extends to the discrete phase space .    from eq . </S>",
    "<S> we can straightforwardly construct a pm square analogous to for two bosonic modes , @xmath33 where @xmath34(@xmath35 ) denotes a displacement operator for mode 1(2 ) . </S>",
    "<S> operators @xmath36 within each row or column are mutually commuting , and the same holds for their real and imaginary hermitian parts , i.e. , the modular variables @xmath37 and @xmath38 . </S>",
    "<S> the product of three operators in each row and column is @xmath39 , except in the last column where it is @xmath40 . </S>",

    "<S> the displacement operators in do not represent physical observables , and in each experimental run , we can only measure either the real or imaginary parts , @xmath37 and @xmath38 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , instead of eq .  , we now consider the real - valued form @xmath41 where @xmath42 for products of three displacement operators in the same row and , analogously , @xmath43 for operator products in the same column . </S>",
    "<S> explicitly , in terms of modular operators we obtain @xmath44    _ classical bound. _ since only @xmath37 or @xmath38 can be measured , and not directly @xmath0 , we must compare the observed values with the most general nchv theory , where those observables are associated with independent variables . </S>",
    "<S> in this case , the products @xmath45 and @xmath46 can assume values between @xmath47 and @xmath48 , and for correlations measured as in eqs . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : r ] ) , we obtain an upper bound of @xmath49 , which is the double of the quantum value @xmath50 . to recover a lower classical bound , we enforce the additional constraints @xmath51 , satisfied in qm , to our nchv model , by adding `` punishment '' terms that lower the classical bound whenever such a condition is violated ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> thus , we can define @xmath52 and proceed to maximize the expectation value of @xmath53 with the only assumption that @xmath37 and @xmath38 are represented by noncontextual classical random variables @xmath54 taking values in @xmath55 $ ] . </S>",

    "<S> appendix ) that for @xmath56 , the maximal value for the expression in any nchv theory is @xmath57 . </S>",
    "<S> this extends the bound derived by plastino and cabello  @xcite , which holds only for a restricted set of nchv theories where the condition @xmath51 is assumed , and makes contextuality tests in phase space generally applicable .    </S>",
    "<S> _ contextuality with a single mode. _    in close analogy to the case of qubits , </S>",
    "<S> the pm square   has been constructed for two modes . </S>",
    "<S> a natural question arises , whether a similar set of operators with identical relations could already be identified for a single continuous - variable degree of freedom . </S>",
    "<S> as we show now , this is not possible in a strict sense , but a pm square for single mode displacement operators can be realized with an arbitrary good approximation , when large displacements are allowed .    </S>",
    "<S> let us consider a set of nine single mode displacement operators @xmath58 , labeled by the corresponding two - dimensional displacement vectors @xmath59 . to obtain the same relations as for the two mode case , we require first of all , that the product of three operators within each row and column commute and are proportional to @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> this is given by the conditions @xmath60 , etc , for some integer @xmath3 , implying @xmath61 , etc . </S>",
    "<S> finally , the product of all three displacements is @xmath62 meaning that @xmath3 must be even , except for the third column where the product is @xmath9 , and therefore , @xmath3 must be odd . by putting together the above relations for the displacement vectors we prove the following result :    * observation . * </S>",
    "<S> it is not possible to represent the commutation and product relations of the pm square with displacement operators on a single mode .    by the linear relations , it is sufficient to consider four vectors @xmath63 , and define @xmath64 etc . </S>",
    "<S> then , the cross product relations give us @xmath65 where @xmath66 are even , while @xmath67 is odd . a direct , but tedious </S>",
    "<S> , calculation allows us to remove the vector variables , obtaining a conditions only for the integers @xmath68 @xmath69 from this , one can directly see that , if the first five @xmath68 are even , the remaining @xmath67 has to be even . the other interesting cases , where , e.g. three @xmath68 are even and the three remaining @xmath70 are odd , are also not possible . </S>",
    "<S> this proves the claim .     </S>",
    "<S> used for the approximate construction of the pm square for a single mode . </S>",
    "<S> see the text for further details . ]    nevertheless , as we will show now , it is possible to approximate the pm square on a single mode arbitrarily well , if the displacement is allowed to be large . since any experimental implementation of the perfect pm square is only an approximation , this can still be a way to test hidden variable models , if the occurring errors are quantified by additional measurements of the compatibility @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> to start , we set the vectors of the first row as @xmath71 implying that the length of @xmath72 is @xmath73 . </S>",
    "<S> the other rows are defined in a similar way , but rotated by @xmath32 ( cf . </S>",
    "<S> fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ mpsingle ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> again , we have to impose the conditions on the area of the spanned triangles , but here we make a slightly different choice , by demanding that the product of five rows or columns should be @xmath74 , while for the remaining one it should be @xmath75 one can easily see that this leads to the same contradiction as the usual pm square .    </S>",
    "<S> our conditions can then be written as follows : @xmath76 with odd @xmath68 for @xmath77 , corresponding to the three rows . </S>",
    "<S> for the first and second column , it follows that @xmath78 with odd @xmath68 for @xmath79 . </S>",
    "<S> the factor @xmath80 comes from the fact that the vectors form an equilateral triangle ( see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ mpsingle ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> finally , for the last column , we have @xmath81 with an even @xmath82 this , however , follows automatically from the previous condition , since @xmath83 . with odd @xmath84 and </S>",
    "<S> @xmath85 big enough , we can approximate arbitrarily well @xmath80 , i.e. , @xmath86 we then choose @xmath87 as @xmath88 , and the conditions in eq .  </S>",

    "<S> furthermore , with this choice we have @xmath89 so the conditions from eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ cond2 ] ) are approximately fulfilled . </S>",
    "<S> the approximation improves with increasing values of @xmath84 and @xmath85 , which requires an increasing displacement @xmath87 . to give a concrete example , with displacements up to a maximal @xmath90 </S>",

    "<S> finally , it can be shown that the geometric phase @xmath148 giving rise to contextuality diminishes under decoherence and disappears in classical limit . </S>",
    "<S> this motivates us to consider it as a quantum resource which can be used for characterizing and quantifying contextuality .    _ </S>",
