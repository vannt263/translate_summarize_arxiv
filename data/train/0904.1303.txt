    "the volume operator in loop quantum gravity ( lqg ) plays a central role in the quantum dynamics of the theory . without it ,",
    "it is not possible to define the hamiltonian constraint operators @xcite , the master constraint operators @xcite , or the physical hamiltonian operators @xcite . the same applies to truncated models of lqg such as loop quantum cosmology ( lqc ) @xcite which is believed to describe well the homogeneous sector of the theory . in lqc",
    "the quantum evolution of operators that correspond to classically - singular dirac observables typically remains finite .",
    "this can be traced back to the techniques used to quantize inverse powers of the local volume that enter into the expression for the triad , co - triad and other types of coupling between geometry and geometry , or geometry and matter @xcite .",
    "specifically , such derived operators arise as commutators between holonomy operators and powers of the volume operator .    in view of its importance , it is of considerable interest to verify whether the classical limit of the lqg volume operator coincides with the classical volume . by this",
    "we mean that ( i ) the expectation value of the volume operator with respect to suitable semiclassical states which are peaked at a given point in phase space , coincides with the value of the classical volume at that phase space point , up to small corrections ; and ( ii ) its fluctuations are small .",
    "it should be remarked that there are actually two versions of the volume operator that have been discussed in the literature @xcite .",
    "these come from inequivalent regularisations of the products of operator - valued distributions that appear at intermediate stages .",
    "however , only the operator in @xcite survives the consistency test of @xcite , namely , writing the volume in terms of triads which then are quantised using the commutator mentioned above , gives the same operator up to @xmath0-corrections as that obtained from direct quantisation .",
    "this consistency check is important as otherwise we could not trust the triad and co - triad quantisations that enter the quantum dynamics .",
    "a semiclassical analysis of the volume operator has not yet been carried out , although , in principle , suitable semiclassical ( even coherent ) states for lqg are available @xcite .",
    "this is because the spectral decomposition ( projection - valued measure ) of the volume operator can not be computed exactly in closed form .",
    "however , this is needed for exact , practical calculations .",
    "more precisely , the volume operator is the fourth root of a positive operator , @xmath1 , whose matrix elements can be computed in closed form @xcite but which can not be diagonalised analytically .    in more detail , the volume operator has a discrete ( that is , pure - point ) spectrum and it attains a block - diagonal form where the blocks are labelled by the graphs and spin quantum numbers ( labelling the edges of the graph ) of spin - network functions ( snwf ) @xcite .",
    "snwf form a convenient basis of the lqg hilbert space @xcite which carries a unitary representation of the spatial diffeomorphism group and the poisson@xmath2algebra of the elementary flux and holonomy variables @xcite .",
    "the blocks turn out to be finite - dimensional matrices whose matrix elements can be expressed in terms of polynomials of 6j symbols . fortunately , these complicated quantities can be avoided by using a telescopic summation technique @xcite related to the elliot - biedenharn identity @xcite , so that a manageable closed expression results .",
    "however , the size of these matrices grows exponentially with increasing spin quantum numbers and , since the expression for coherent states is a coherent superposition of snwf s with arbitrarily large spin quantum numbers , a numerical computation of the expectation value using the numerical diagonalisation techniques , that are currently being developed @xcite , is still a long way off .",
    "one way forward is to use the semiclassical perturbation theory developed in @xcite , and applied already in @xcite .",
    "the basic idea is quite simple . in practical calculations",
    "one needs the expectation value of @xmath3 where @xmath4 is a rational number in the range @xmath5 . in order to attain",
    "that , one has to introduce the ` perturbation operator ' , @xmath6 , where the expectation value @xmath7 of the positive operator @xmath1 is exactly computable .",
    "notice that @xmath8 is bounded from below by @xmath9 .",
    "then trivially @xmath10^q>$ ] .",
    "now we exploit the existence of positive numbers @xmath11 such that the classical estimates @xmath12 are valid for all @xmath13 .",
    "finer estimates of this form involving arbitrary powers of @xmath14 are also available @xcite . by virtue of the spectral theorem ,",
    "this classical estimate survives at the quantum level and we have @xmath15 where @xmath16 .",
    "it follows that @xmath17 $ ] .",
    "however , @xmath18 and @xmath19/<q>^2 $ ] is proportional to the relative fluctuations of @xmath1 , which are of order of @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "it follows that to zeroth - order in @xmath0 we may replace @xmath20 by @xmath21 which is computable , as are the error estimates in the way shown above .",
    "the exact computation of @xmath22 is feasible , but it is still quite involved . at this point",
    "it is convenient to use the fact that ( see @xcite ) , to zeroth - order in @xmath0 , the computation of these expectation values ( more generally , the expectation values of low - order polynomials in the flux operators ) for @xmath23 spin - network states coincides with the corresponding calculations for @xmath24 spin networks . on the latter ,",
    "the volume operator is even diagonal .",
    "hence we conclude that , as long as we are only interested in the zeroth - order in @xmath0 contribution , we may evaluate the expectation value of the volume operator for a fictitious theory in which the non - abelian group @xmath23 is replaced by the abelian group @xmath24 .",
    "this dramatically simplifies all the calculations .",
    "the coherent states developed so far for lqg have all been constructed using the complexifier method reviewed in @xcite .",
    "this generalises the coherent - state construction for phase spaces that are cotangent bundles over a compact group ; see @xcite .",
    "this construction involves computing the heat - kernel evolution of the delta distribution ( which is the matrix element of the unit operator in the schrdinger ( position ) representation ) with respect to a generalized laplace operator , called the ` complexifier ' , followed by a certain analytic continuation .",
    "now the unit operator in lqg can be written as a resolution of unity in terms of snwf s and , although the heat kernel is a damping operator , since the snwf are not countable ( the lqg hilbert space is not separable ) , the resulting expression is not normalisable .",
    "however , it does give a well - defined distribution ( in the algebraic dual of the finite linear span of snwf s ) which can be conveniently written as a sum over cut  off states labelled by finite graphs .",
    "these states , called `` shadows '' in @xcite , _ are _ normalisable , and can be used to perform semiclassical calculations .",
    "of course , one expects that the good semiclassical states will only be those cut ",
    "off states that are labelled by graphs which are sufficiently fine with respect to the classical three - metric to be approximated .",
    "thus the input in the semiclassical calculations consists in the choice of a complexifier and the choice of a graph .",
    "one may wonder why the complexifier has to be chosen _ a priori _ rather than being dictated by the dynamics of the theory : that is , why do the coherent states remain coherent under quantum time evolution ?",
    "for example , for the harmonic oscillator , the complexifier is just the laplacian on the real line .",
    "the reason is two - fold . on the one hand",
    ", one could perform a constraint quantisation so that we are working at the level of the kinematical hilbert space on which the quantum constraints have not yet been imposed .",
    "in this situation , all that is needed is to ensure that the volume operator , which is not gauge invariant ( and thus does not preserve the physical hilbert space ) , has a good classical limit on the kinematical hilbert space .",
    "we would certainly not trust a constraint quantization for which even that was not true .",
    "on the other hand , one could also work at the level of the physical hilbert space , as outlined in @xcite .",
    "then , one would expect that the time evolution of any reasonable choice of complexifier coherent states with respect to the physical hamiltonian should remain coherent ( and peaked on the classical trajectory ) for sufficiently short time intervals .",
    "note that for interacting theories , even the simple example of the anharmonic oscillator , globally stable coherent states have yet to be found .",
    "the choice of the complexifier will be guided by practical considerations : namely ( i ) it is diagonal on snwf s ; and ( ii ) it is a damping operator that renders normalisable the heat - kernel evolution of the delta distribution restricted to a graph .",
    "moreover , it should be gauge invariant under the @xmath23 gauge group .",
    "as for the choice of graph , for practical reasons one will use graphs that are topologically regular , that is , have a constant valence for each vertex .",
    "indeed , the semiclassical calculations performed in @xcite were done using graphs of cubic topology , with good results .",
    "the existing literature on such coherent states for lqg can be divided into two classes , depending on a certain structure that defines them .",
    "the first are _ gauge - covariant flux _ coherent states , which depend on collections of surfaces and path systems inside them @xcite .",
    "the second are _ area _ coherent states , which also depend on collections of surfaces but involve area operators rather than flux operators @xcite . in our companion paper @xcite we have reviewed and generalised both constructions . in its most studied incarnations ,",
    "the collection of surfaces involved in @xcite is defined by a polyhedronal partition of the spatial manifold , while the collection used in @xcite uses a plaquette of foliations of the spatial manifold .",
    "the main objective of this series of two papers is to analyse the semiclassical properties of the volume operator with respect to both classes of coherent state . in @xcite",
    "we employed the states of @xcite .",
    "in this paper we employ the states of @xcite .",
    "this exhausts all known coherent states for lqg .",
    "the result of our analysis is that , if we use the states @xcite , _ the correct semiclassical limit is attained with these states for @xmath25 only_. if instead we use the states @xcite , the correct semiclassical limit is attained _ only _ for : 1 ) artificial rescaling of the coherent state label ; and 2 ) particular embeddings of the 4-valent and 6-valent graphs with respect to the set of surfaces on which the complexifier depends .",
    "however , the combinations of euler angles for which such embeddings are attained have measure zero in so(3 ) , and are therefore negligible . thus the _ area",
    "complexifier coherent states are not the correct tools with which to analyse the semiclassical properties of the volume operator_.    if one wants to obtain embedding independence , a possible strategy is to sample over graphs ( dirichlet - voronoi sampling @xcite ) as outlined in @xcite .",
    "what this strategy amounts to is that , instead of singling out one particular coherent state @xmath26as defined in terms of a single graph @xmath27one considers an ensemble of coherent states constructed by averaging the one - dimensional projections @xmath28 onto the states @xmath26 over a subset @xmath29 of the set of all allowed graphs . in other words ,",
    "one considers a mixed state ( with an associated density matrix ) rather than a single coherent state .",
    "in such a way , if the subset @xmath29 is big enough , it can be shown ( @xcite ) that it is possible to eliminate the embedding dependence ( the ` staircase problem ' for a surface @xmath30 .",
    "if we compute the expectation value for @xmath31 with respect to a coherent state @xmath26 , such that the surface @xmath30 intersects transversely one and only one edge @xmath32 of @xmath27 , then the expectation value of the area operator coincides with the classical value @xmath33 .",
    "however , if the surface @xmath30 lies transversally to the edges , then we do not obtain the correct classical limit . ] ) .",
    "it is straightforward to deduce that the area complexifier coherent states can not be used to construct embedding - independent , mixed coherent states because of condition 2 ) above .",
    "we thus claim that _ area complexifier coherent states should be ruled out as semiclassical states altogether if one wants to attain embedding independence_. instead one should use the flux coherent states , as was done in @xcite . for such states",
    "we will show that _ the correct semiclassical limit is attained only for @xmath25 _ .",
    "in other words , _ up to now , there are no semiclassical states known other than those with cubic - graph topology ! _",
    "thus the implication of our result for lqg is that the semiclassical sector of the theory is spanned by snwf that are based on cubic graphs .",
    "this has some bearing for spin - foam models @xcite which are supposed to be ",
    "but , so far , have not been proved to be  the path - integral formulation of lqg .",
    "spin foams are certain state - sum models that are based on simplicial triangulations of four manifolds whose dual graphs are therefore 5-valent .",
    "the intersection of this graph with a boundary three - manifold is 4-valent , and therefore we see that spin - foam models , based on simplicial triangulations , correspond to boundary hilbert spaces spanned by spin - network states based on 4-valent graphs only . however , we have proved that the correct semiclassical states for analysing the semiclassical properties of the volume operator are the _ gauge covariant flux _ states . for such states , only those of cubic topology",
    "give the correct semiclassical value of the volume operator .",
    "even if the mismatches between the 4-valent sector of lqg and the boundary hilbert space of spin foams could be surmounted , the result of our analysis seems to be that _ the boundary hilbert space of current spin - foam models does not contain any semiclassical states !",
    "_ this apparently contradicts recent findings that the graviton propagator derived from spin - foam models is correct @xcite .",
    "however , it is notable that these latter results only show that the propagator has the correct fall - off behaviour : the correct tensorial structure has not yet been verified .    one straightforward way of possibly repairing this situation is to generalise spin - foam models to allow for arbitrary  in particular , cubic  triangulations , as suggested in @xcite .    in the present paper we will perform detailed calculations of the expectation value of the volume operator for the 4- , 6- , and 8-valent graphs using the area coherent states reviewed in @xcite .",
    "the main difference between the flux coherent states and the area coherent states is that the former depend on a discrete set of flux operators while the latter depend on a continuous family of area operators .",
    "in particular , the surfaces on which the area operators depend fill all of space .",
    "hence the question arises whether the area coherent states depend less severely on the relative orientation of the chosen cut - off graph with respect to the system of surfaces .",
    "specifically , it would be interesting to know if the calculations of the expectation values are insensitive to euclidean motions of the graph ( translations and rotations ) when the spatial metric to be approximated is the euclidean one .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows . in section [ s4 ]",
    "we calculate the expectation value for a general graph .",
    "the expectation value depends on the edge metric , already encountered in @xcite , which is close to diagonal when the edge lengths , @xmath34 , are much larger than the lengths , @xmath35 , of the boundaries of the surfaces . in order to compute the off - diagonal metric entries we stick to the graphs defined in our companion paper as",
    "otherwise we encounter severe ` bookkeeping ' problems .",
    "these graphs are dual to tetrahedronal , cubical and octahedronal triangulations , all of which derive from a cubulation of the spatial manifold , as discussed in @xcite .",
    "one can expand the expectation value into a convergent power series in @xmath36 .",
    "we establish that , contrary to the results in @xcite , to zeroth - order in both @xmath0 and @xmath36 the correct expectation value is obtained for @xmath25 and @xmath37 , but _ only _ for specific embeddings of the graph with respect to the surfaces on which the area operators depend .",
    "however , we show that such embeddings have measure _ zero _ in @xmath38 .",
    "moreover , by using the coherent states in @xcite we also find that the graphs ( 4- , 6 , and 8-valent ) are all euclidean invariant , up to sets of measure zero in @xmath38 and up to linear order in @xmath36 .",
    "nonetheless , the embeddings with non - zero measure all fail to give the correct semiclassical value for the volume operator .",
    "this shows that coherent states @xcite are not the correct tools for analysing the semiclassical properties of the volume operators .",
    "in section 3 we perform an explicit calculation of the expectation value of the volume operator for 4- , 6- , and 8-valent graphs , including the higher - order effects in @xmath36 .",
    "this contribution is only euclidean - invariant up to linear order . for each of these valences",
    "we first consider a graph constructed in terms of regular simplicial , cubical and octahedron cell complexes , as done in @xcite .",
    "after that , we study the effects of rotations and translations .",
    "in section 4 we summarise our results and draw appropriate conclusions .",
    "the more technical calculations have been transferred to an appendix in order not to distract from the line of argument in the main text .",
    "in this section we compute the expectation value of the operator @xmath39 for an arbitrary @xmath40-valent vertex , @xmath41 , for the stack family coherent states using the replacement of @xmath23 by @xmath24 .",
    "this uses the calculational tools developed in @xcite , to which we refer for our notation .",
    "we may , therefore , replace the @xmath23 right - invariant vector fields by @xmath24 right - invariant vector fields @xmath42 acting on @xmath43 .",
    "the crucial simplification is that these vector fields mutually commute .",
    "their common eigenfunctions are the spin - network functions which , for @xmath24 , take the explicit form [ 4.0.5 ] t_,n(a)=_ee ( ) _ j=1 ^ 3 [ a^j(e)]^n_j^e we will refer to them as ` charge network states ' because the @xmath44 are integer valued . using the spectral theorem we may immediately write down the eigenvalues of @xmath39 on @xmath45 as [ 4.0.6 ] _",
    "n , v=_p^3    what follows is subdivided into four parts .",
    "we begin by performing the calculation for a general graph .",
    "this leads to the inverse of the edge metric which , for large graphs , is beyond analytical control . in the second part",
    "we restrict the class of graphs , which lets us perform perturbative computations of the inverse of the edge metric .",
    "this gives a good approximation of the actual expectation value . in the third and fourth parts we consider the dependence of our results on the relative orientation of the graph with respect to the family of stacks .",
    "the coherent state associated with an @xmath40-valent graph in which more than one edge intersects a given plaquette @xmath30 , is as follows : [ 4.1 ] _ z , = _ ne^- n^ttn e^z^t n t _ , n the norm of the coherent states is given by [ 4.2 ] ||_z,||^2 = _",

    "the expectation value for the volume operator is [ 4.3 ] < > _ z,= = where [ 4.4 ] _",
    ", v(n)=_p^3 are the eigenvalues of the volume operator @xmath39 .",
    "we have introduced the notation [ 4.5 ] _",

    "n^e_k n^e^_l    the semiclassical limit of the volume operator is obtained from ( [ 4.3 ] ) in the limit of vanishing @xmath53 .",
    "that is , it is the zeroth - order in @xmath53 of the expansion of ( [ 4.3 ] ) in powers of @xmath53 .",
    "since ( [ 4.3 ] ) converges slowly for small values of @xmath53 , we will perform a poisson transform which replaces @xmath53 by @xmath54 which converges quickly . to this end ,",
    "analogous to @xcite , we introduce the following variables [ 4.6 ] t_e:=t_ee , t_e:=,x^e_j:= t_e n^e_j , y^e_j(x):=x^e_j / t_e , c^e_j:=p^e_j / t_e , w^e_j(n):=n^e_j / t_e , a_e",
    "e^jk:= a_e e ^jk:= notice that the diagonal entries of @xmath55 equal unity .",
    "the off - diagonal ones , however , are bounded from above by unity by the schwarz inequality applied to the scalar product defined by @xmath55 and are restricted to the six - dimensional subspace restricted to vectors with non - zero entries for the @xmath56 components only .      in order to perform the gaussian integrals in ( [ 4.8 ] )",
    "we notice that , by construction , @xmath55 is a positive - definite , finite - dimensional matrix , so that its square root , @xmath58 , and its inverse are well defined via the spectral theorem .",
    "hence we introduce as new integration variables [ 4.9 ] z^e_j:=_e,k ( ) ^ee_jk x^e_k , y^e_j(z)= x^e_j = _ e k ( [ ] ^-1])^ee_jk z^e_k the jacobian from the change of variables drops out in the fraction , and ( [ 4.8 ] ) becomes [ 4.10 ] < > _ z , =    now one would like to shift @xmath59 into the complex domain by @xmath60 and then perform the ensuing gaussian integral .",
    "this is unproblematic for the denominator of ( [ 4.8 ] ) which is analytic in @xmath59 ; however , the numerator is not .",
    "the careful analysis in @xcite shows the existence of branch cuts in @xmath61 of the fourth - root function involved . in turn",
    ", this shows that , in the semiclassical limit , both numerator and denominator are dominated by the @xmath62 term while the remaining terms in the series are of order @xmath63 ( i.e they decay as @xmath64 for some @xmath65 ) .",
    "see @xcite for the details .",
    "the upshot is that to any polynomial order in @xmath0 we may replace ( [ 4.10 ] ) by [ 4.11 ] < > _ z , = which is now defined unambiguously because the argument of the fourth root is the square of a real number .",
    "the denominator of ( [ 4.11 ] ) simply equals @xmath66 .",
    "therefore , the only @xmath0-dependence of ( [ 4.11 ] ) lies in the numerator in the function @xmath67 .",
    "we now note that the eigenvalues of the volume operator come with a factor of @xmath68 , as displayed in ( [ 4.4 ] ) . pulling it under the square root into the modulus , and noticing that the modulus is a third - order polynomial in @xmath69",

    "is now easy .",
    "first note that the matrix elements of both @xmath55 and @xmath70 are of order unity .",
    "since @xmath51 is some macroscopic length scale , the first term that is proportional to @xmath59 in ( [ 4.13 ] ) is therefore of order @xmath71 , while the second is of zeroth - order in @xmath53 .",
    "therefore @xmath72 is of the form [ 4.14 ] f(z)=4 where @xmath73 is a certain sixth - order polynomial in @xmath74 with no zeroth - order term , while @xmath1 is independent of @xmath59 .",
    "moreover , @xmath75 is non - negative for all @xmath59 because it is the square of a third - order polynomial in @xmath59 . in particular",
    ", this holds at @xmath76 , and therefore @xmath1 is also a non - negative number .",
    "then , provided @xmath77 , we can define [ 4.15 ] f(z):==:4 where @xmath78 is a sixth - order polynomial with no zeroth - order term which is bounded from below by @xmath9 .",
    "now , as in @xcite , we exploit the existence of @xmath79 such that [ 4.16 ] 1 + r - r r^2f1 + r for all @xmath80 . inserting this estimate into ( [ 4.11 ] )",
    "we can bound the integral from above and below because the gaussian is positive .",
    "the integrals over @xmath78 and @xmath81 are finite and are at least of order @xmath53 because odd powers of @xmath59 do not contribute to the gaussian integral .",
    "this is as far as we can go with the calculation for a general graph .",
    "notice that the inverse of the edge metric appears in this expression and , for a general graph , this is beyond analytical control .",
    "therefore we will now make restrictions on the graph so as to analyse ( [ 4.18 ] ) further .",
    "* _ coordinate chart _ + the graph , the region @xmath78 and the families of stacks lie in a common coordinate chart @xmath82 .",
    "this is not a serious restriction because the general situation may be reduced to this one by appropriately restricting attention to the various charts of an atlas that covers @xmath83 . *",
    "_ tame graphs _ + we assume that the graph is _ tame _ with respect to the stacks .",
    "by this we mean that for each direction @xmath84 , and each stack @xmath85 , a given edge , @xmath32 , of the graph enters and leaves that stack at most once .",
    "this means that the graph does not ` wiggle ' too much on the scale of the plaquettes .",
    "analytically , it means that @xmath86 vanishes whenever @xmath87 for any @xmath32 , and that , for given @xmath32 , the number @xmath88 is non - vanishing at most for either @xmath89 or @xmath90 but , not both , and independently of @xmath85 .",
    "finally , it means that the sets @xmath91 are connected . * _ coarse graphs _ + we assume that the graph is much coarser than the plaquettation in the sense that any edge intersects many different stacks in at least one direction @xmath84 . * _ non - aligned graphs _ + we exclude the possibility that distinct edges are ` too aligned ' with each other in the sense that the number of stacks that they commonly traverse is much smaller than the number of stacks that they individually traverse .        a consequence of the tameness , coarseness and ` alignedness ' assumption is that @xmath92 for all @xmath56 , as is immediately obvious from the formulae displayed in our companion paper because the number of stacks with @xmath93 will be very much smaller than the number of stacks with @xmath94 or @xmath95 . hence the edge",
    "metric will be almost diagonal .",
    "this is important because we need its inverse , which can only be calculated with good approximation ( that is , for large , semiclassically relevant graphs ) if it is almost diagonal .",
    "the graphs that we will eventually consider are embeddings of subgraphs dual to tetrahedronal , cubical or octahedronal triangulations of @xmath96 .",
    "these correspond to embeddings of regular @xmath97-,@xmath98-,@xmath99-valent lattices , which ensures the non - alignedness property .",
    "thus , without loss of generality , we may choose the stacks and plaquettes as follows . using the availability of the chart @xmath100 we consider the foliations",
    "@xmath101 defined by the leaves @xmath102 where for @xmath103 we set @xmath104 .",

    "after these preparations , we can now analyse ( [ 4.17 ] ) and ( [ 4.18 ] ) further . recall that [ 4.19 ] e^e_j=_,i dt e_j(p^i_t ) ( p^i_t , e ) and [ 4.20 ] t^_ee=_i dt ( p^i_t , e ) ( p^i_t , e ) by the assumption about the graphs made above , the signed intersection number takes at most the numbers @xmath111 and independently of @xmath85 , so that @xmath112 for certain @xmath113 which takes",

    "there we also explained why one must have @xmath140 actually equal to @xmath141 and not just of the same order : while one could use this in order to favour other valences of the volume operator , the expectation value of other geometrical operators such as area and flux would be incorrect .",
    "assuming @xmath137 we write ( [ 4.29 ] ) as [ 4.30 ] <",
    "> _ z,=:v_v(e ) g_,v thereby introducing the graph geometry factor @xmath142 .",
    "it does not carry any information about the phase space , only about the embedding of the graph relative to the leaves of the three - foliations . from the fact that ( [ 4.30 ] ) reproduces the volume of a cube up to a factor",
    ", we may already anticipate that the geometry factor will be close to unity for , at most , a cubic graph . whether this holds for an arbitrary orientation of the graph with respect to the stack family will occupy a large part of the analysis which follows .",
    "we start by investigating the behaviour of the graph geometry factor @xmath142 under diffeomorphisms , @xmath143 , of @xmath83 , that is , under @xmath144 while the linearly - independent families of stacks are left untouched .",
    "this will answer the question of how much the geometry factor depends on the relative orientation of the graph with respect to the stacks .",
    "in fact , the orientation factor @xmath145 is invariant under diffeomorphisms of the spatial manifold @xmath83 .",
    "the signature factor [ 4.31 ] _ e , ee^()=_ijk ^i_e ^j_e ^k_e^ is obviously invariant under any diffeomorphism that preserves the foliations @xmath101 , i.e. which map leaves onto leaves , because [ 4.32 ] ^i_e=_e dx^a _ abc _ l_it dy^bdy^c ( x , y ) where @xmath146 is any leaf in @xmath53 which intersects @xmath32 transversely .",
    "since we consider graphs whose edges are embedded lines in @xmath96 with the same embedding that defines the stacks , it follows that the geometry factor is invariant under any embedded global translations in @xmath96 .",
    "next , since global rescaling in @xmath96 preserves the foliations and the topological invariant ( [ 4.32 ] ) , the geometry factor is also invariant under embedded global rescalings of @xmath96 .",
    "finally , any embedded global rotations of @xmath96 that preserves all the orientation factors @xmath147 will leave the geometry factors invariant .",
    "since the orientation factors only take the values @xmath148 ( depending on whether an edge agrees , disagrees with the orientation of the leaves , or lies within a leaf ) , there will be a vast range of euler angles for which this condition is satisfied , if the graph is an embedded , regular lattice of constant valence .",
    "hence , in order to check whether the geometry factor is rotationally invariant under any rotation we need only worry about those rotations which lead to changes in the @xmath147 .",
    "likewise , if we rotate a graph which is dual to a polyhedronal complex , we expect that the expectation value remains invariant as long as the graph remains dual to the complex .    fortunately , using the explicit formulae derived for the edges and vertices for @xmath37- , @xmath98- , @xmath99-valent graphs displayed in @xcite we can calculate the @xmath147 for each edge @xmath32 . intuitively , it is clear , that whenever many of the @xmath147 change from @xmath114 to @xmath9 , we can expect a drastic change of the expectation value . however , one has to take into account the combined effect of these changes , and this is what makes rotational invariance possible . as a first step",
    "we determine the action of a rotation on the sign factors .      in what follows we discuss the cases that show a drastic change in the value of @xmath149 caused by a change in the values of @xmath147 .",
    "to carry out this calculation we will perform a rotation of each of the three different types of lattice analysed so far : namely , the @xmath97- , @xmath98- and @xmath99-valent lattices .",
    "these rotations will be parameterised by euler angles and will be centred at a particular vertex of the lattice , for example @xmath150 .",
    "the effects of a rotation will depend on the distance of the vertices from the centre of the rotation .",
    "in fact , the position of each vertex in the lattice after rotation will depend on both the distance from the centre of the rotation and the euler angles used in the rotation .",
    "fortunately , the values of the terms @xmath147 will not depend on the former but only on the latter .",
    "this is easy to see since the value of @xmath147 can be either 1 , -1 or 0 depending on whether the edge is outgoing , ingoing , or lies on the plaquette in the direction @xmath84 .",
    "thus it will only depend on the angle the edge makes with the perpendicular to the plaquette in any given direction , i.e. it will depend on the angles the edge makes with respect to a coordinate system centred at the vertex at which the edge is incident .",
    "clearly , only the values of the euler angles of the rotation will affect the angles each edge has with respect to the vertex at which it is incident .",
    "in particular , since the graph we are using is regular , following the rotation , all edges which were parallel to each other will remain such , and thus will have the same angles with respect to the vertex at which they are incident .",
    "this implies that in order to compute the values of the terms @xmath151 , we can consider each vertex separately and apply the same rotation to each vertex individually .    on the other hand",
    ", the distance from the centre of the rotation affects the position of each vertex with respect to the plaquette structure , and thereby affects both the values of the terms @xmath152 and the number of them that are different from zero .",
    "these effects can be easily understood with the aid of the two - dimensional diagram ( figure [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "it is clear that , for any two parallel edges , the angle each of them has with respect to the vertex at which they are incident , is independent of the distance of the edge from the centre of rotation . on the other hand , the values of the @xmath152 will depend on both the rotation and the distance of the centre of rotation , since the position of the rotated vertex with respect to the plaquette depends on both these parameters .",
    "therefore , we can tentatively assume that two different geometric factors will be involved in the computation of the volume operator :    1 .",
    "@xmath153 , which indicates how the terms @xmath151 are affected by rotation .",
    "this geometric factor affects all orders of approximation of the expectation value of the volume operator .",
    "2 .   @xmath154 , which indicates the effect of rotation on the terms @xmath152 .",
    "this term affects only the first- and higher - order approximations of the expectation value of the volume operator , not the zeroth - order .    in",
    "what follows we will analyse the geometric term @xmath155 : i.e. , we will analyse the changes in the values of the @xmath156 due to a rotation applied at each vertex independently .",
    "we will do this for the 4- , 6- and 8-valent graphs separately . the geometric factor @xmath154 will be analysed in subsequent sections .",
    "as we will not see , our calculations show that for all 4- , 6- and 8-valent graphs , the rotations that produce drastic change in the values of @xmath157 have measure zero in @xmath38 since they occur for specific euler angles rather than for a range of them .",
    "let us start with the 6-valent graph ( figure [ fig6 ] ) .",
    "in order to compute the change in the values of the individual @xmath156 , we will divide into eight small sub - cubes the cube formed by the intersection of the plaquettes in the three directions and containing the vertex we are analysing ( @xmath150 ) .",
    "it is then easy to see that for each edge @xmath32 , the corresponding value of @xmath158 depends on the sub - cube in which it lies . in particular",
    ", we have the following table for the values of @xmath147 .       where @xmath159 , @xmath160 , @xmath161 , @xmath162 , @xmath163 , @xmath164 , and the quantities @xmath165 , @xmath166 , @xmath167 are the @xmath14- , @xmath69- , @xmath59-coordinates of the vertex @xmath168 . in all the above formulae the term @xmath169 comes from the fact that @xmath170 for all edges @xmath171 .            c. rovelli .",

    "<S> such requirements are not present when analysing dual cell complex states , we conclude that coherent states whose complexifiers are squares of area operators are not an appropriate tool with which to analyse the semiclassical properties of the volume operator . moreover , </S>",
    "<S> if one intends to go further and sample over graphs in order to obtain embedding independence , then the area complexifier coherent states should be ruled out altogether as semiclassical states .    </S>",
