    "the following discussion will focus on results concerning quantized gauge fields in rindler spaces or equivalently quantized gauge fields as seen by a uniformly accelerated observer .",
    "the metric of rindler spaces incorporates the physics of the relativistic generalization of a homogeneous gravitational field and can therefore be used locally as an approximation to more complicated spaces such as the space close to the horizon of a schwarzschild black hole . since the discovery of the so called unruh effect @xcite , i.e. the appearance of a heat bath as a result of the acceleration and its relation to hawking radiation about 30 years ago , conceptual questions concerning the presence or absence of radiation have played an important role ( for a review cf .",
    "applications of such studies have addressed the motion of particles in accelerators ( cf.@xcite ) , acceleration induced decays of particles @xcite or the possibility of thermalization in relativistic heavy ion collisions @xcite . while most of the results have been obtained for scalar fields no systematic investigations of the properties of gauge fields in rindler spaces have been carried out .",
    "a uniformly accelerated observer in @xmath0 dimensional minkowski space moves along the hyperbola @xcite @xmath1 the acceleration is denoted by @xmath2 and the d-1 coordinates transverse to the motion by @xmath3 .",

    "the light cones indicate that in region i signals can be transmitted to region ii but not received from it .",

    "is called rindler space and its metric is given by @xmath20 observations in the accelerated frame can be interpreted equivalently as observations of a stationary observer in a gravitational background .",
    "indeed the rindler metric accounts for the gravitational field in the near horizon limit of a schwarzschild black hole ( cf.@xcite ) with the black hole horizon at @xmath21 and the acceleration given by the inverse of the schwarzschild radius . in the non - relativistic limit , @xmath22 ,",

    "the hamiltonian of the scalar field in rindler space is given by @xmath50 unlike in minkowski space , the energy @xmath51 of rindler particles is independent of the transverse momentum @xmath52 and mass though the solutions of the wave equation ( [ wxi ] ) depend non - trivially on these quantities as is illustrated in fig.[mcd ] for two eigenfunctions with the same energy .",
