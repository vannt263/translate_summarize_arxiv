    "it seems appropriate to honour the founder of our subject , after whom this award is named , by recalling one of his most elegant pieces of work . in 1879",
    "josef stefan had published his famous law @xcite stating that the power per unit area radiated by an ideal black body is proportional to the fourth power of its absolute temperature @xmath1 . in terms of the energy density @xmath2 in the radiation field , this may be written as @xmath3 where @xmath4 is stefan s constant , and @xmath0 here is not the conformal anomaly number of my title , but the ( even more ubiquitous ) speed of light .",
    "stefan apparently based his empirical law on the analysis of experimental data of john tyndall @xcite , a victorian scientist now more famous for his work in magnetism as well as glaciology .",
    "stefan was boltzmann s advisor @xcite , and it must have been a great pleasure to him when his former student produced @xcite a theoretical derivation of this law based on thermodynamic reasoning .",
    "it is worth recalling boltzmann s derivation , as it illustrates the power , as well as the potential pitfalls , of combining ideas from two different branches of physics .",
    "he imagined a box , filled with black - body radiation , of which one wall is a piston which is moved by the pressure of the radiation . according to classical electromagnetism , the pressure @xmath5 is related to the energy density by @xmath6 .",
    "the heat - energy balance equation then reads @xmath7 dividing through by @xmath1 and using the fact that @xmath8 is a complete differential , @xmath9 which simplifies , after some algebra , to @xmath10 , that is , @xmath11 .",
    "space dimensions an analogous argument leads to @xmath12 . ]",
    "this simple yet elegant argument was praised by lorentz in 1907 @xcite as ` a jewel of theoretical physics . ' but , with hindsight , we see that boltzmann was either fortunate , or , more likely , inspired , in juxtaposing results of classical electromagnetism with the idea that radiation behaves like a fluid . for the immediate question",
    "is then `` a fluid of what kind of particle ? ''  and of course this was not answered , even heuristically , until planck made his hypothesis , and , more systematically , until the quantization of the radiation field . indeed , as every student knows , @xmath13 , and , once again with hindsight , a little dimensional analysis would have shown boltzmann that , if stefan s constant depends on fundamental constants , one of these must contain the dimensions of mass and therefore be something which at the time was unknown in the classical physics of the pure radiation field .    in more modern terms ,",
    "the equation @xmath6 , which was the starting point of boltzmann s argument , is equivalent to the statement that the energy - momentum tensor @xmath14 is traceless : @xmath15 this equation is true for the classical maxwell field , but boltzmann was implicitly assuming that it also holds for the quantized field . yet nowadays we know many examples of field theories for which the energy - momentum tensor is traceless at the classical level , but not when the theory is quantized properly .",
    "examples are electrodynamics coupled to ( massless ) particles , with non - trivial vacuum polarization effects ( so in fact stefan s law does not hold in qed at high temperatures ) , and non - abelian gauge theories .    in fact it is now understood that in a quantum field theory @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the renormalization group ( rg ) beta - function which is the object of the subsequent discussion . ] .",
    "this means that , even when fluctuations ( either quantum or thermal ) are taken into account , the trace @xmath18 vanishes at rg fixed points , that is , in a critical theory at which the correlation length diverges .",
    "thus we expect a generalized stefan - boltzmann law to hold at all quantum critical points which have a relativistic dispersion law @xmath19 at low energies , where , however , @xmath20 does not have to be the speed of light , but could , for example , be the fermi velocity or the speed of sound . in 1 + 1 dimensions ,",
    "with which we shall henceforth be concerned , there are many such examples : free fermions at finite density , luttinger liquids , quantum hall edge states , and many critical quantum spin chains . in that case , the 1 + 1-dimensional analogue of the stefan - boltzmann law takes the form @xmath21 where now @xmath0 is not the speed of light , but , as a simple calculation in quantum statistical mechanics shows @xmath22 however , in general , @xmath0 is fractional , and indeed is the first appearance of the ubiquitous conformal anomaly number .",
    "in order to understand how @xmath0 arises in conformal field theory , let us consider the simplest possible example of a single scalar field @xmath23 with action @xmath24 in 2 space dimensions , this might represent the energy in the electrostatic field , or of spin waves at low temperatures",
    ". many important models of statistical physics in 2 or 1 + 1 dimensions can be ` bosonized ' into this simple form . in order to understand why this is conformally invariant , it is useful to define so - called complex coordinates @xmath25 in terms of which @xmath26 in two dimensions conformal mappings correspond locally to analytic functions @xmath27 , and we can see that , classically , @xmath28 is indeed invariant under these , since @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 . indeed , the trace @xmath32 , as calculated by noether s theorem , vanishes identically .",
    "the non - zero components , in complex coordinates , are @xmath33 under a conformal mapping @xmath27 , we see that classically @xmath1 transforms simply : @xmath34 and similarly for @xmath35 .    however , once the fluctuations are taken into account , this is no longer the case .",
    "in fact @xmath1 as defined above is divergent , since @xmath36 , so @xmath37 .",
    "one way to define it properly is by point - splitting : @xmath38\\ ] ] where @xmath39 is a short - distance cut - off of the order of the lattice spacing .",
    "however this subtraction does not in general commute with conformal mappings , because in the @xmath40-plane we should still subtract off @xmath41 rather than @xmath42 .",
    "the result is the appearance of an anomalous term in the transformation law for @xmath1 : @xmath43 where @xmath44 ( the schwartzian derivative ) , and in this case @xmath45 .",
    "this is a classic example of the appearance of an anomaly in quantum field theory , when a symmetry ( in this case , conformal symmetry ) is not respected by the necessary regularization procedure .",
    "in fact the form of the last term on the rhs of ( [ t ] ) , although complicated , is completely fixed by the requirement that it hold under a general iterated sequence of conformal mappings .",
    "the only arbitrariness is in the coefficient @xmath0 , which is thereby a fixed parameter characterizing the particular cft or universality class .    although ( [ t ] ) might appear rather technical , from this result in fact flow all the various ubiquitous physical manifestations of @xmath0",
    "consider a critical 1 + 1-dimensional quantum system ( with a linear dispersion relation @xmath19 at low energies ) of length @xmath46 , at low but finite temperature @xmath1 . as feynman taught us , the partition function @xmath47 is given by the path integral in imaginary time with periodic boundary conditions modulo @xmath48 , where @xmath49 .",
    "that is , it is equivalent to a 2-dimensional classical system on a cylinder ( see fig .  [ fig1 ] ) of circumference @xmath48 .",
    "this is conformally related to the plane by the mapping @xmath50 . applying ( [ t ] ) and using the fact that @xmath51 , we find @xcite the result for the energy density @xmath52 the 1 + 1-dimensional version ( [ sb ] ) of the stefan - boltzmann law , in units where @xmath53 .",
    "note that this corresponds to a linear specific heat . in principle , this can be compared with experiment , although this requires a separate determination of @xmath20 .",
    "equivalently , we can think of the coordinate along the cylinder as representing imaginary time , in which case we have a 1 + 1-dimensional quantum theory defined on a finite spatial interval @xmath54 , with periodic boundary conditions . in that case ( [ u ] ) gives the finite - size corrections to the ground state energy , @xmath55 , once again in units where @xmath53 .",
    "this is one the most effective ways of determining @xmath0 from numerical or analytic diagonalization of the hamiltonian @xmath56 .",
    "as with any quantum theory , it is advantageous to realise the symmetries of cft in terms of generators acting on the hilbert space of states of the theory . in this case",
    "these are the so - called virasoro generators @xmath57 ( and analogously @xmath58 ) .",
    "the transformation law ( [ t ] ) is completely equivalent to the virasoro algebra @xmath59=(n - m)l_{n+m}+\\ffrac1{12}c\\,n(n^2 - 1)\\delta_{n ,- m}\\,.\\ ] ] in particular @xmath60 and @xmath61 generate scale transformations and rotations , and the scaling fields of the cft correspond to eigenstates of these operators , with eigenvalues giving all the critical exponents .",
    "thus the study of the representation theory of the virasoro algebra gives a way of classifying all possible cfts and thereby universality classes in 2d .",
    "the breakthrough in this direction came following the seminal 1984 paper of belavin , polyakov and zamoldchikov ( bpz ) @xcite in which they showed that , for certain special rational values of @xmath62 , the cft closes with only a finite number of representations of the virasoro algebra , and , for , these cases , all the critical exponents and multi - point correlation functions are calculable . shortly thereafter",
    "friedan , qiu and shenker @xcite showed that unitary cfts ( corresponding to local , positive definite boltzmann weights ) are a subset of this list , with @xmath63 and @xmath64 an integer @xmath65 .",
    "this gives rise to what might be termed the ` conformal periodic table ' ( table  [ pt ] ) .",
    ".the first few elements in the conformal periodic table . [ cols=\"^,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     the first few examples may be identified with well - known universality classes .",
    "the ` hydrogen atom ' of cft is the scaling limit of the critical ising model , ` helium ' is the tricritical ising model , and so on .",
    "note , however , that at the next value of @xmath66 two possible ` isotopes ' arise . in the second ,",
    "corresponding to the critical 3-state potts model , not all the scaling dimensions allowed by bpz in fact occur , but some of those that do actually appear twice .",
    "in fact the constraint of unitarity is not sufficient to determine exactly which representations actually occur in a given cft .",
    "the answer to this is provided by demanding consistency of the theory on a torus @xcite , by interchanging the intepretations of space and imaginary time similar to the case of the cylinder mentioned above . for the torus",
    ", this is a modular transformation , and the requirement of modular invariance has become another powerful tool in classifying cfts , completely solved in the case @xmath62 by cappelli , itzykson and zuber @xcite .",
    "in recent years , @xmath0 has been playing a new role in quantifying the degree of quantum entanglement in the ground state of a 1 + 1-dimensional critical system ( for example , a quantum spin chain . )",
    "there is by now a huge literature on this @xcite , but here i will concentrate on the simplest possible scenario : a long system , of length @xmath46 , near a quantum critical point which is divided into two halves @xmath67 and @xmath68 at the origin .",
    "we assume that the degrees of freedom in @xmath67 are accessible only to observer a , and conversely those in @xmath68 only to b. in the ground state , a s observations are entangled with those of b : if a performs a measurement with a certain outcome , this can restrict the possible outcomes of measurements b can subsequently make . a very useful way to measure the entanglement between @xmath67 and @xmath68 is through the a s reduced density matrix @xmath69 and the so - called rnyi entropies @xmath70 the limit @xmath71 gives the well - known von neumann entropy @xmath72 .",
    "if the state @xmath73 is unentangled , @xmath74 has a single eigenvalue @xmath75 , so that @xmath76 .",
    "however , a maximally entangled state will give rise to @xmath77 eigenvalues all of the same order , so that @xmath78 .",
    "it turns out that @xmath79 is given by the path integral , or partition function , on an @xmath80-sheeted surface @xmath81 with a branch cut running from the origin to the boundary , as shown for the case @xmath82 in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] .",
    "is evaluated.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    this however , is related the full plane by the conformal mapping @xmath83 .",
    "using once again ( [ t ] ) , we then find @xmath84 this behaviour means that the branch point behaves like the insertion of a scaling operator with dimension @xmath85 , and thus the partition function on @xmath81 goes like @xmath86 at the critical point , or @xmath87 away from it , where @xmath88 is the correlation length .",
    "thus @xmath89 for @xmath90 , with @xmath46 replaced by @xmath88 in the opposite limit .",
    "this result @xcite has been verified by numerous analytic computations in exactly solvable models , and has become the gold standard for measuring @xmath0 numerically , using , for example , density matrix rg methods .",
    "however , it is but the tip of the iceberg in results of this type : taking , for example , @xmath67 to consist of two disjoint intervals gives access to the entire spectrum of scaling dimensions of the cft , as well as the operator product expansion coefficients @xcite .",
    "these are too numerous to list exhaustively , but some of my favourites are :    * if we put a cft on a manifold of euler character @xmath91 and linear size @xmath46 , the free energy has the asymptotic form as @xmath92 @xcite @xmath93 this works even for a disc , with @xmath94 . if there are corners on the boundary , however , the coefficient is modified in a known manner .",
    "* one can not give a survey of the role of @xmath0 without mentioning zamolodchikov s beautiful @xmath0-theorem @xcite : _ there exists a function @xmath95 of the coupling constants @xmath96 which is decreasing along rg flows and is stationary at rg fixed points , where it equals @xmath0__. this implies that rg flows , at least in 2d , go ` downhill ' and rules out ( at least for unitary theories ) exotic behaviour such as limit cycles . remarkably , no analogous result has been shown in higher dimensions ( except in the case of a high degree of supersymmetry ) , and it remains an open question as to whether it is in fact true .",
    "_ _ _ * one nice consequence of the above is the @xmath0-theorem sum rule @xcite : suppose that we move slightly away from the critical point by adding , for example , a magnetic field @xmath97 .",
    "then in that case the @xmath98-dependent susceptibility @xmath99 is analytic at wave vector @xmath100 , and its curvature there , by scaling , goes like @xmath101 .",
    "in fact the coefficient is universal : @xmath102 where @xmath39 is the usual critical exponent in @xmath103 .",
    "this is only a very selective list .",
    "indeed , one may truthfully say that , at least in two or 1 + 1 dimensions , @xmath0 is everywhere !",
    "i am immeasurably grateful to all the collaborators and other colleagues who have supported my research over the years , many of whom have played no small part in achieving many of the results described above .",
    "i thank the members of the iupap c3 commission on statistical physics for the award of the boltzmann medal on this occasion , which i consider to be a recognition of the whole field theoretic approach to critical behaviour and the work of all the people who have contributed to this effort ."
