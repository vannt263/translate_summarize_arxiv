    "we adopt stellar and disk parameters as inferred from previous studies , which well reproduce the source spectral energy distribution ( sed ) ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "we use stellar spectral type k0 ( @xmath10  k ) , stellar luminosity @xmath11  @xmath12  and stellar mass @xmath13  @xmath14  as determined by @xcite .",
    "the uv spectrum @xcite is reproduced by an uv excess @xmath15 and a power law slope @xmath16 .",
    "the effect of x - ray radiation from the stellar corona of t tau n ( @xmath17  ergs@xmath1 , @xcite ) is taken into account following @xcite and @xcite .",
    "following @xcite we assume a disk inner radius @xmath18  au , a dust mixture of astronomical silicates @xcite and amorphous carbon @xcite with relative abundances of 62.5% and 37.5% , and a grain size distribution @xmath19 with @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the number of dust particles with radius @xmath22 , and the minimum / maximum grain size are @xmath23  @xmath24 m  and @xmath25  mm .",
    "this implies a dust mass of @xmath26 @xmath14  to reproduce the observed mm emission @xcite . using the average ism dust - to - gas ratio of @xmath27 ,",
    "the gas mass is 0.013  @xmath14 .",
    "the dust - to - gas ratio can be different from the ism value in evolved disks ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , as the cn lines are optically thick in the disk , their flux is independent on the gas mass , hence on the assumed dust - to - gas ratio .",
    "the sed is well reproduced by assuming a disk surface density @xmath28 and scale height @xmath29 @xcite . to obtain a dust distribution similar to the two - layers model adopted by @xcite",
    ", we assume that grains larger than @xmath30  @xmath24 m  have settled to a smaller scale height than the gas , @xmath31 , with @xmath32 . as pah emission is generally not detected in ttss ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the pah fraction , @xmath33 , is set to @xmath27 with respect to the ism abundance of @xmath34 pah particles / h - nucleus .",
    "lower values , @xmath35 , do not affect the cn emission .",
    "the adopted stellar and disk parameters are summarized in table [ tab : model_par ] .",
    "as the cn line fluxes and profiles are very sensitive to the assumed disk outer radius , @xmath7 , and inclination , @xmath6 , we proceed through two steps .",
    "first , we run a grid of models at low resolution ( 50@xmath3650 grid points ) adopting @xmath7 and @xmath6 values which cover the range of estimates from previous studies ( @xmath37  au , @xmath38 au , @xcite ) .",
    "then , we run a high resolution model ( 100@xmath36100 grid points ) for @xmath7 and @xmath6 which best fit the observations , to better resolve the chemical and temperature gradients and the vertical extent of the line forming region in the disk .",
    "the predicted fwhm and peak separation do not depend on the model resolution while the line fluxes are lower by up to @xmath39% when increasing the resolution .",
    "the line profiles and fluxes are obtained by first solving the statistical equilibrium with 2d escape probability to obtain the level populations , and then using 2d ray - tracing . as the three brightest lines of each cn 54 j ",
    "j transition are blended and the three undetected components are more than one order of magnitude fainter , the model computes the sum of the cn 54 j=9/27/2 and j=11/29/2 lines .",
    "the results obtained for the grid of models ( figure [ fig : grid ] ) show that the cn line fluxes depend mainly on the disk size and increase for increasing outer radii .",
    "this is due to the fact that , as suggested by their profiles , the cn lines originate from the outer region of the disk .",
    "the best fit of the cn line fluxes is obtained for @xmath40  au . however , as model - predicted fluxes are affected by @xmath39% uncertainty , values of @xmath7 between @xmath41  au produce cn line fluxes which are still in agreement with the observations .",
    "the ratio between the 566.9 and the 566.7 ghz lines predicted by the models , @xmath42 , is slightly lower but still in agreement with the observed one ( @xmath43 ) .",
    "the peak separation and fwhm predicted by the models depend on both @xmath7 and @xmath6 . for @xmath44  au the observed @xmath45 and fwhm are reproduced if the disk inclination is low ( @xmath46 ) .",
    "this is in agreement with the conclusions by @xcite and @xcite based on the modeling of the sed and near- , mid - infrared visibilities .",
    "larger inclination angles of @xmath47  @xcite are excluded based on the observed cn profiles .    following the results obtained from the grid of models we adopt @xmath48  au , @xmath3  and compute the fluxes and profiles of all the lines covered by our observations using the high resolution model .",
    "figure [ fig : cn_model ] shows the region in the disk where 50% of the cn n=54 j=9/27/2 and j=11/29/2 lines originate according to our model .",
    "this is obtained using vertical escape probability and without accounting for disk inclination .",
    "the model indicates that the cn lines are excited in a disk upper layer located at 40110 au distance from the star , which is irradiated by the stellar uv field .",
    "this heats the gas up to temperatures of @xmath49 k , while the gas density is @xmath50  @xmath8 , thus the cn lines are almost thermalized and optically thick ( @xmath51 ) in the line emitting region .",
    "in this disk layer , cn is produced by h + cn@xmath52 , and c + no reactions , and photo - dissociation of hcn , while the main destruction route is photo - dissociation of cn . in figure [ fig : hifi_lines ] and table [ tab : lines ] the model - predicted line profiles and fluxes are compared with the observed ones . for cn lines , the model predicts a fwhm of 3.9  kms@xmath1  and peak separation of 2.6 kms@xmath1 , in agreement with observations ( fwhm@xmath53  kms@xmath1 , @xmath54 kms@xmath1 ) .",
    "also the line fluxes agree with observations within a factor @xmath55 .",
    "the sum of the fluxes of the n=21 components , instead , is about an order of magnitude lower than what observed by @xcite , who suggest that the line is dominated by envelope emission .",
    "the co , @xmath56co , h@xmath0o , and so line fluxes predicted by the disk model are from a factor four to two orders of magnitude smaller than observed , as well as for the high - j co , h@xmath0o , oh , and atomic [ ] , [ ]  lines previously observed with pacs ( see table 4 by @xcite ) .",
    "this is a further evidence that these lines are dominated by envelope and outflow emission , as already suggested by the fact that [ ] , [ ]  emission is spatially extended with pacs ( @xmath57 ) and by the broad profiles of co , h@xmath0o , so , and [ ]  obtained with hifi .",
    "the _ herschel_/hifi observations of the t tau system show emission in a number of molecular and atomic lines .",
    "the origin of the emission lines in embedded , accreting / ejecting sources is highly debated , being crucial to identify a tracer to dig out the faint disk emission ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in the case of t tau , the co , h@xmath0o , and [ ]  lines clearly trace high - velocity outflowing gas .",
    "by contrast with those lines and with previously observed cn 21 lines @xcite , the cn 54 lines show narrow double - peaked profiles centered at the systemic velocity , suggesting an origin in the outer disk of t tau n. disk modeling predicts cn line fluxes and profiles in agreement with observed ones and constrains the size of the gaseous disk of t tau n ( @xmath2  au ) and its inclination ( @xmath3@xmath4 ) .",
    "this study demonstrates that high - j cn lines are a unique tool to probe the gaseous disk of strongly accreting / ejecting sources and paves the way for future observations of embedded disks with alma ."
