    "we have classified these as single cloud systems , and plotted them in the @xmath73 bin , since the low ionization gas is predominantly still in a single gas cloud with an internal velocity dispersion is less than 6.6  . a similar asymmetry in single cloud line profiles",
    "was also noticed by @xcite in hires / keck high resolution spectra .",
    "however , their formal fitting procedure , with the lower @xmath42 data , did not statistically favor a two component fit .",
    "the occasional asymmetry in the line profile is likely due to a contribution to the low ionization absorption from a slightly offset higher ionization gas cloud .",
    "photoionization models have succeeded in reproducing the observed asymmetry in the line profile using a single low ionization phase and separate high ionization phases ( e.g. , see the ionization models for @xmath69 and @xmath74 systems in @xcite and the @xmath71 system in @xcite .",
    "we have therefore chosen to classify the above nine systems as single cloud systems .    taking this into account ,",

    "a spearmann - kendall test supports the null hypothesis that the equivalent width is statistically uncorrelated ( spearman s @xmath78 ) with the redshift of the absorber . in strong absorbers ,",
    "the low ionization absorption is never confined to a single cloud .",
    "the line profiles are often kinematically complex with the absorption spread in several clouds separated in velocity . from the statistical analysis of 23 strong systems along 18 quasar lines of sight",
    ", @xcite found an average of @xmath79 clouds per system , with the absorption profile of one system resolved into as many as 19 different components .",

    ".    the large scatter in the observed ratios between the various transitions can be brought about by a number of factors , and can be exploited to diagnose the physical conditions of the absorber . for a given strength of , the spread in the strength of the other transitions can be due to variations in abundance patterns or to differences in the density / ionization parameters of the gas clouds ( addressed in   [ sec:4.2 ] ,  [ sec:4.6 ] and  [ sec:5 ] ) .",
    "there is also the possibility that absorption from two different ions arises in separate phases , in which case the scatter between their equivalent widths could be quite large .",
    "if we are to distinguish between these different factors , it is important not to use the observed equivalent widths since they average together the contributions from different clouds .",

    "a number of factors such as differences in ionization parameter , differences in the elemental abundances and/or contributions from different gas phases can combine to produce these observed trends , which are discussed in the next section .",
    "in addition , differential depletion of elements onto dust can lead to deviations from solar composition .",

    "the observed column densities of the other prominent low and intermediate ionization transitions - namely , , , , , and , and their ratios to - are used .",
    "the ionization fraction for a given element is controlled by the density in the gas cloud as well as by the strength of the incident ionizing radiation .",
    "weak systems are not known to reside at small impact parameters ( d  @xmath24  kpc ) from luminous star - forming galaxies ( @xmath103 , @xcite ) .",
    "hence the ionization balance in them is likely dictated by the intensity of the extragalactic background radiation ( ebr ) .",
    "we choose the @xcite model for the ebr which incorporates ionizing photons from quasars and star - forming galaxies after propagation through a thick igm .",
    "a 10% escape fraction from galaxies is used for ionizing photons with @xmath104   .    to determine the overall properties for our sample of weak absorbers , we generate a grid of cloudy models for a range of ionization parameters ( @xmath105 log @xmath106 ) and neutral hydrogen column densities ( @xmath107 log @xmath108 ) .",

    "we adopt a solar abundance pattern for the cloudy models , but discuss the effects of abundance variations . in the following sections , we discuss the constraints that the various ions provide towards the chemical and ionization conditions in the absorbing gas .      in our sample ,",
    "the column densities of the individual clouds in weak absorbers fall within the range @xmath117  .",

    "figure  [ fig:7 ] presents how the column densities of the various ions change with respect to the ionization parameter , log @xmath120 , for different values of @xmath121 and metallicity . for a given metallicity and ionization parameter , i.e. , a certain density , an increase in @xmath121 would correspond to an increase in the size of the absorber",
    "also , with increasing ionization parameter , the neutral fraction of hydrogen declines such that to converge on the same value of @xmath121 , the size of the absorber has to further increase .",

    "thus , higher @xmath7 can be recovered by raising either @xmath121 or metallicity .",
    "for example , at @xmath124  , by raising the metallicity by 1 dex ( to z@xmath27 ) , we find that the ionization models reproduce the observed column densities in the weaker systems ( @xmath125  ) in our sample .",
    "for the same @xmath121 value , at 10z@xmath27 , a substantial fraction of the range of observed @xmath7 is covered by the ionization models , except for those systems with @xmath126  .",
    "alternatively , with a 1 dex increase in @xmath121 , the curves shift correspondingly such that systems with @xmath127   can be produced in 0.1z@xmath27 gas .",
    "however , for @xmath128  , the low ionization gas cloud is an optically thick , lyman - limit absorber ( i.e. able to produce a break in the spectrum of the background quasar at @xmath129   in the rest - frame of the absorber ) .",

    "the ratio of column density between various ionization stages does not depend on metallicity since all individual column densities scale linearly .",
    "an exception to this can occur ( discussed in   [ sec:4.4 ] ) for certain ions at supersolar metallicities where cooling leads to much lower gas temperatures . in the optically thin regime , for a given abundance pattern",

    "we notice that the column density ratios of all clouds in our sample confine the ionization parameter to log @xmath143 , corresponding to @xmath144   ( for log @xmath145 at @xmath112 ) . at 0.1z@xmath136 , the systems with detected require column densities greater than @xmath146  . by increasing the metallicity , the grids shift to the right proportionately such that the same to ratios can now be recovered from weaker lines ( @xmath147  ) .",
    "thus , if the low ionization gas is thin in neutral hydrogen , the metallicity in systems where is detected is constrained to solar or super - solar values .    in the sample of 17 single cloud weak absorbers studied by rigby ( 2002 ) , a subset of systems with log @xmath148 > -0.3 $ ] were classified as _ iron - rich_. these systems were found to have high metallicity ( @xmath149 ) , particularly strong constraints on density ( log @xmath150 , @xmath151  ) , and small sizes [ @xmath152  , r @xmath153  pc ] .",
    "the relatively high to ratio indicated that the high density , low ionization gas in the _ iron - rich _ systems is not @xmath6-enhanced .",
    "following the definition of @xcite , we find that 30 clouds in our sample are _ iron - rich _ , excluding censored data points .",
    "comparing the data to the cloudy grid , we find that the ionization parameter in these systems is constrained to an upper limit on the ionizing parameter between -3.2 and -3.7 depending on the difference in ionizing photon number density between @xmath112 and @xmath154 respectively .",
    "a limit of log @xmath155 translates to a density of @xmath156   in the low ionization gas for log @xmath157   ( the number density of ionizing photons with @xmath158  ev at @xmath111 ) .",

    "changing the abundance of any element from this pattern would result in a corresponding change in all ionization stages of that element .",
    "thus , the _ iron - rich _ systems can have a lower constraint on density if the abundance of iron in the low ionization cloud is enhanced relative to the solar abundance pattern , since the cloudy grids would be shifted upwards .",
    "such an abundance pattern is not physically well motivated . on the other hand ,",
    "an @xmath160enhanced abundance pattern is ruled out for these _ iron - rich _ systems as its effect would be to shift the cloudy grids further down such that the ionization models will not be able to reproduce the observed to ratio .",

    "the ionization model , in that case , would infer higher densities for the low ionization gas .",

    "the bin size is equivalent to the gap in the distribution that @xcite found for their sample .",
    "the distribution from our sample does not suggest a bimodality , either for single or multiple clouds .",
    "this remains true for smaller bin sizes as well .",
    "hence the apparent gap that was suggested by the @xcite data can be attributed to inadequate sample size .",
    "additionally , we also note that there is no difference in the observed to ratio between single and multiple cloud systems .",
    "the individual clouds in the multiple cloud systems have the similar log @xmath120 constraints as single clouds , with _ iron - rich _ systems detected in both category .      in this section",
    ", we explain the constraints that are available from the observed to ratio in weak systems . in the past , single phase photoionization models ( using cloudy 90 ; @xcite ) have failed to reproduce the observed to ratio in some strong systems @xcite .",
    "the / ratio derived from the models was lower than the observed neutral to singly - ionized ratio . to circumvent this ,",
    "a separate phase was proposed in which the ionization fraction is higher @xcite . this separate phase would have a higher density ( @xmath162  ) and lower temperature ( @xmath163  k ) than the gas phase associated with the absorption .",
    "the lines corresponding to such low temperatures are very narrow ( @xmath164  ) and are therefore unresolved at the @xmath55 of the earlier hires and uves observations . however",
    ", through superhigh spectral resolution observations , at @xmath165 ( @xmath166  ) , it has been demonstrated that the lines are not narrower than what is derived for @xmath55 ( narayanan 2007 ) .",

    "the neutral magnesium fraction ( mg@xmath167/mg@xmath168 ) is thus small , compared to the fraction ( /mg@xmath168 ) , in these systems .",
    "this most likely explains the large scatter in the range of limits , evident in figures  [ fig:5 ] and  [ fig:6 ] , since we are sampling a large number of quasar spectra with differences in sensitivity .",
    "the spectra with the highest @xmath42 ratio in our sample , however , constrain the column density to values as low as @xmath169  , @xmath170  dex smaller than @xmath7 , indicating that the neutral fraction in the phase is indeed not very high .",

    "in fact , the observed ratio of to in strong absorbers can also now be explained without invoking a separate cold phase for .",

    "the fraction / is expected to decrease with an increase in the ionization conditions in the gas .",

    "this is consistent with the log @xmath120 derived using the to ratio in the corresponding systems allowing for a single low ionization phase solution .",
    "the density of this low ionization phase would be smaller than what is estimated for the _ iron - rich _ systems .",
    "unfortunately , such a definite statement can not be extended for all the other systems plotted in figure  [ fig:15 ] , as their measurements are upper limits .",
    "nonetheless , even these limits are consistent with a low density .",
    "many of the detected clouds in figure  [ fig:8 ] did not appear in figure  [ fig:15 ] because could not be measured for them due to contamination or lack of coverage .",
    "for these clouds the inferred ionization parameters range from log @xmath187 to @xmath188 .",

    "such a direct comparison between the measured and may not apply because may arise partly from a higher ionization phase .",
    "in addition to the low ionization phase , most weak systems also have an associated high ionization phase where the density is low ( @xmath190  ) . although dominated by higher ionization states of carbon ( and ) , the ionization fraction ( i.e. /c@xmath168 ) can be non - negligible in this phase .",

    "the @xmath7 contribution from this high ionization phase is negligible . in summary ,",
    "even though is detected in all weak systems , since it does not arise exclusively in the low ionization phase , it may not provide as robust a constraint on the ionization parameter as does .",

    "a supersolar metallicity could help to explain some systems with a low to ratio , such as the @xmath202 system towards q  @xmath203 described in misawa ( 2007 ) .",
    "however , for many of these systems , the most likely explanation would be a reduction of the aluminum abundance relative to magnesium by up to @xmath2040.7 dex .",
    "a reduction would effectively shift the grids down by the same amount .",
    "such an abundance pattern is feasible , since it is consistent with @xmath6-enhancement .",

    "assuming that the and are produced in the same phase , for the detections , the ionization parameter ranges from @xmath205 log @xmath106 .    in the previous section , in order to reconcile the to grid with the points below that grid , we proposed a reduction of the aluminum abundance relative to magnesium .",
    "if this is applied to the , it shifts this grid downwards so that it does not cover some of the data points . if the systems with small to also have small to this is not a problem , though it does require large log @xmath120 for even these systems",

    "for all of the systems below the grid ( see figure  [ fig:13 ] ) , @xmath54 ( )  @xmath206 .",
    "although we have not identified specific clouds for which and can not arise in the same phase , we note that some of our detections imply large ionization parameters , log @xmath207 .",
    "this is even more the case if we rely on a decrease of the aluminum abundance .",
    "so either there is a sub - population of weak clouds which are of a higher ionization state , or some of the is produced in a higher ionization phase , such as the one giving rise to the bulk of the absorption .      in damped ly-@xmath6 ( dla )",
    "systems , the chemical abundance estimations are often carried out under the assumption that the ionization corrections are not significant , since the gas is expected to be predominantly in the low ionization phase . however , the detection of lines at the same velocity as the low ionization lines in several dlas lead @xcite to investigate the relevance of ionization corrections for these systems . in their analysis , @xcite observed that the @xmath208@xmath209 ratio in dla systems exhibits an anti - correlation with @xmath121 .",
    "this relationship was described as intrinsic to dlas , and was used to suggest that the to ratio in these systems could be a sensitive probe of the ionization conditions in the gas . using a sample of sub - dla systems , @xcite examined if this anti - correlation extends to lower @xmath121 .",

    "the ratio is @xmath211  dex higher than what has been measured for the other two classes of systems .",
    "this indicates that the ionization conditions are higher in weak systems than in dla or sub - dla systems .",

    "one of our objectives in carrying out the chemical and ionization analysis on a large sample of weak systems is to find out if there are any evolutionary trends observable in the absorber population .",

    "photoionization constraints have already suggested that a range of ionization properties and metallicities can be expected for the low ionization phase .",
    "it would be unusual to assume that the entire population of weak systems are tracing some unique type of physical process / structure , given these variations and the large redshift interval surveyed .",
    "to investigate , we compared the observed to ratio between the various systems , as it is a reliable constraint on density and chemical enrichment history . figure  [ fig:17 ] shows the measured @xmath8 as a function of redshift . because of the many non - restrictive limits at small @xmath180 , particularly for low redshift clouds , it is hard to evaluate whether there is a significant relationship between @xmath8 and @xmath11 . in order to consider this issue , we separated clouds with log @xmath212 , those that were likely to have only limits on ( based on inspection of figure  [ fig:8 ] ) , and considered only the stronger of the weak clouds , plotted in _ red _ color in the top panel of figure  [ fig:17 ] .",
    "it appears that there is an anti - correlation between @xmath8 and @xmath11 . at high redshift , there is an absence of detections with larger @xmath8 values , while at low redshift there are many detections with large @xmath8 and few limits that could even be consistent with small @xmath8 values .",

    "we find that there is a probability of only p(ks ) = 0.006 ( ks statistic d = 0.505 ) that the two samples are drawn from the same distribution .",
    "the probability is likely to decrease if upper limits could be replaced with actual detections .",
    "thus we find that the observed anti - correlation of @xmath8 with @xmath11 is statistically significant for log @xmath213 clouds .",
    "we have found an absence of log @xmath213 clouds at high redshift with large values of @xmath8 and an apparent absence of log @xmath213 clouds at low redshift with small values of @xmath8 .",
    "there are a number of low redshift clouds with limits that could be consistent with small values .",
    "furthermore , for weaker clouds ( with log @xmath212 ) , there are some examples of low @xmath8 values at low redshifts .",
    "we conclude that large @xmath8 clouds are present only at @xmath214 and not at higher redshifts . the other population with small @xmath8 exists both at low and high redshifts .",
    "as demonstrated earlier , systems in which log @xmath215 are constrained to have a high density ( log @xmath155 , @xmath216  ) . those with a lower to ratio have lower densities , ranging down to log @xmath143 , which corresponds to @xmath217  .",
    "the observed trend in the to ratio with redshift , therefore , could imply the absence of high density clouds in the low ionization phase in weak absorbers at high-@xmath11 .",
    "such variations in the phase structure are plausible if the weak systems are probing a different combination of astrophysical systems / processes at @xmath5 and @xmath218 .",
    "furthermore , if the absorbers are optically thin clouds , then we are also seeing a change in the thicknesses of the low ionization gas clouds , from kiloparsec - scale at @xmath5 to a range of values including both parsec - scale and kiloparsec - scale clouds at @xmath4 .",
    "alternatively , gas clouds that are enriched primarily by type ii sne events will have [ @xmath6/fe ] @xmath219 , in which case the observed to column density ratios will be low .",
