    "thus defined , @xmath44 is a riemannian metric on the space @xmath45 of curves starting at the origin , @xmath12 ; this space can be identified with the quotient of @xmath35 by the group of translations .",
    "the metric @xmath44 belongs to the family of sobolev type metrics . since it involves first order derivatives of the tangent vectors , it is a first order metric .",

    "first order metrics have been studied in @xcite and higher order metrics in @xcite .",
    "what distinguishes the metric @xmath44 defined in   among other possible choices is the existence of the square root velocity transform , @xmath49 we equip @xmath50 with the @xmath51-inner product , viewed as constant ( and hence flat ) riemannian metric .",
    "the transform @xmath52 has some important properties .",

    "@xmath52 is a diffeomorphism between @xmath45 and @xmath53 ; 2 .",
    "@xmath52 is an isometry between @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "a proof can be found in @xcite .",
    "this means that at least locally the geodesic distance between two curves @xmath56 is given by @xmath57 which is exactly the distance  .",
    "the global behaviour of the distance depends on the dimension @xmath58 of the ambient space .",
    "assume @xmath59 .",
    "the space @xmath53 is not convex and since geodesics are straight lines , it is also not geodesically convex .",
    "nevertheless we are able to smoothly perturb any path that passes through the origin in such a way that the perturbed path avoids the origin and hence the geodesic distance on all of @xmath45 is given by  .",

    "it is easy to extend geodesics in the space of srvfs , that is on the image side of @xmath52 .",
    "we can also extend @xmath64 , given by @xmath65 from @xmath62 to @xmath36 and we have @xmath66 with @xmath67 .",
    "however the extended map is not a diffeomorphism any more : if a function @xmath68 passes through the origin , then @xmath69 is not surjective .",
    "thus the geodesic completion of @xmath45 is @xmath70 as a set , but with the differential structure , that is induced by @xmath64 .",
    "we can perform the same construction when @xmath17 . for functions",
    "@xmath71 , the interval @xmath2 often parametrises time and @xmath3 itself represents functional , i.e. time - dependent , data . because of the importance of functional data in applications we want to describe the above construction in this particular case .",
    "after removing the origin , @xmath72 becomes disconnected and thus the space of regular curves becomes @xmath73 the set of strictly increasing and decreasing functions .",
    "for the riemannian metric we have @xmath74 and so @xmath75 the square root velocity transform is simply @xmath76 each connected component of @xmath77 is convex and thus the geodesic distance on each one is given by @xmath78 the space of srvfs is @xmath79 , which is disconnected as well and we can consider @xmath80 as its geodesic completion . note that this choice is not unique : we could also take two copies of @xmath80one for positive and one for negative srvfs  as the geodesic completion .",
    "however we choose to glue the two connected components together .",
    "for the curves itself this means that the set @xmath81 is the geodesic completion of @xmath77 and   is the geodesic distance on @xmath81 . as for plane curves we make no statement about the differentiable structure of the geodesic completion .",

    "we look at the formula for @xmath64 , @xmath65 and we see that if @xmath83 , then @xmath84 is an absolutely continuous curve . in fact we can extend @xmath52 to a bijective map @xmath85 where @xmath11 is the set of absolutely continuous curves @xmath86 with @xmath12 .",
    "we will show in sect .",
    "[ sec : srvt ] that this map is a homeomorphism , but not differentiable .",

    "it is instructive to compare the behaviour of @xmath44 , which is a first order metric , to higher order sobolev metrics as well as to the @xmath51-metric .",
    "we will talk about closed curves here , since most references only treat closed curves .",
    "for the @xmath51-metric the picture is simple : the geodesic distance on @xmath89 , induced by the reparametrisation invariant @xmath51-metric is identically zero @xcite and hence there is no completion worth speaking of .    for sobolev type metrics of order",
    "@xmath90 the completion of the space of smooth , regular curves is @xmath91 the space of regular curves of sobolev order @xmath46 .",
    "two differences jump out : for the first - order metric the completion leaves the class of @xmath51-based sobolev spaces and the completion contains non - regular curves , e.g. the constant curve .",
