    "knowing the reddening of an active galactic nucleus ( agn ) is crucial because it affects our ideas of the luminosity of agns , the true spectral energy distribution ( sed ) , emission - line ratios , and the detectability of agns .",
    "as @xcite commented , even a small amount of reddening has a dramatic effect at uv wavelengths and changes the shape of the sed . without knowledge of the true sed of an agn",
    "we can not understand agn accretion discs .",
    "we also can not use the correct ionizing continuum in modelling emission lines to determine physical conditions and covering factors of the broad - line region ( blr ) and torus .",
    "masses of black holes are commonly estimated using the widths of broad lines and the optical luminosity @xcite .",
    "an error in the luminosity thus leads to an error in the black hole mass .",
    "since sizes of the blr and torus can be found from reverberation mapping and these sizes depend on the square root of the luminosity , distances to agns can be found by comparing the inferred luminosities with observed luminosities @xcite .",
    "however , if agns are to be used as cosmological probes , the extinction needs to be known .",
    "it is thus clear that knowledge of reddening is critical for almost all aspects of studies of the nature of the agn phenomenon and of the demographics and evolution of supermassive black holes .    even though the existence of optically - thick dust beyond the accretion disc is an essential part of orientation - dependent schemes to unify thermal agns @xcite ,",
    "the reddening of agns has been controversial for half a century ( see @xcite for a early review ) .",
    "the reddening question has also been intimately entwined with what has been referred to as `` the hydrogen - line problem . ''",
    "hydrogen lines are the strongest broad lines in the spectra of agns .",
    "@xcite gave general calculations of expected balmer line intensities under two assumptions : `` case a '' where the gas is optically thin in the lyman lines , and `` case b '' where the gas is optically thick in the lyman lines .",
    "in practice , because the lyman lines are resonance lines and the abundance of hydrogen is high , case b is the most relevant for most astrophysical situations . over the years",
    "many calculations have been made of hydrogen emission line intensities under baker and menzel case b conditions and these calculations show good agreement .    because the balmer decrement ( the intensity ratios of the balmer lines , in particular h@xmath0/h@xmath1 ) , is relatively insensitive to temperature @xcite ,",
    "the balmer decrement has long been used as a reddening indicator .",
    "however , @xcite noted that significant optical depths in the balmer lines would lead to steeper h@xmath0/h@xmath1 ratios .",
    "this is because when the lower lyman lines have very high optical depths ( i.e. , case b ) , h@xmath0 is scattered but h@xmath1 , after being absorbed by the @xmath3 to @xmath4 transitions , can be converted to p@xmath0 and h@xmath0 .",
    "this reduces the number of h@xmath1 photons and increases the number of h@xmath0 photons .",
    "there are similar conversions for the higher - order balmer lines but because the optical depths decrease sharply as one goes up the balmer series it is the h@xmath0/h@xmath1 ratio that is increased first .    in the first study of the intensities of hydrogen lines in an agn",
    ", @xcite found the balmer decrement of the narrow - line region ( nlr ) of ngc  1068 to be steeper than case b. this immediately raised the question of whether agns were reddened , or whether the intrinsic hydrogen line ratios were different from case b. osterbrock & parker assumed that there was insufficient internal extinction in ngc  1068 to explain the steep balmer decrement and instead favoured the observed steep decrement being a consequence of high optical depths in the balmer lines .",
    "the first spectrophotometry of the blr of agns @xcite showed that the observed broad - line decrements were also not case b. @xcite noted that reddening of @xmath5 could explain the balmer decrement of ton 1542 but also suggested that h@xmath0 could be collisionally enhanced . by comparing high- and low - redshift agns , @xcite estimated the ly@xmath0/h@xmath0 ratio as @xmath6 , which would correspond to ly@xmath0/h@xmath7 rather than the case b value of @xmath8 .",
    "starting with the photoionization models of @xcite it was assumed that there was significant collisional enhancement of ly@xmath0 and it became standard to assume ly@xmath0/h@xmath9 . however , composite spectra of large numbers of agns @xcite confirmed that ly@xmath0/h@xmath7 .",
    "the first direct observations of ly@xmath0 in a low - redshift agn @xcite and of h@xmath0 in a high - redshift agn in the ir @xcite supported these results .",
    "these results accelerated observational and theoretical work on the hydrogen line problem .",
    "a large amount of effort was put into trying to reproduce steep balmer decrements and low ly@xmath0/h@xmath0 ratios with optically - thick photoionization models of the blr ( see @xcite for a review ) .    because the density was clearly high for the blr ( e.g. , @xcite ) it was natural to assume that collisional and optical depth effects would be important . however , it was not clear that these effects were important for the much lower density nlr .",
    "@xcite showed by using [ sii ] @xmath104072 and @xmath1010,320 lines sharing common @xmath11 upper levels ( see @xcite ) that reddening was substantial and consistent with that implied by the nlr balmer decrement . with the advent of modern digital detectors permitting high - quality spectrophotometry",
    ", @xcite was able to show that , contrary to the early photographic work of @xcite , nlr hydrogen line ratios of seyfert 2 galaxies are consistent with reddened case b values . from the balmer decrement of ngc  1068",
    "koski obtained @xmath12 which was consistent with wampler s estimate of 0.5 from the [ sii ] lines .",
    "further comparisons of a variety of independent reddening indicators for additional objects @xcite validated the use of the nlr decrement in general as a reddening indicator .",
    "furthermore , photoionization models @xcite showed that the balmer decrement of the blr was unlikely to be far from case b. there was thus no need to invoke special effects to modify balmer line ratios for the nlr .",
    "even though there has thus been clear evidence for a long time that the _ narrow_-line region of agns is reddened there has continued to be strong resistance to the idea that the _ broad_-line region and continuum are reddened .",
    "it is common to correct spectra only for the small amount of reddening along the line of sight in the milky way and to assume that any internal reddening in agns is negligible ( see , for example , @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "there have been several reasons for the belief that internal reddening is negligible .",
    "as @xcite pointed out , if the lines are reddened , then the continuum is probably reddened too and this makes agns an order of magnitude more luminous .",
    "@xcite also pointed out that de - reddening of the continuum would produce a spectrum that rose towards the ultraviolet , which was considered unlikely prior to the introduction of the thermal accretion - disc model by @xcite .",
    "@xcite gave two strong additional arguments against agn spectra being reddened .",
    "the first was a lack of the @xmath102175 interstellar absorption feature in agn spectra and the second was the apparent lack of steep downward curvature of the continuum going into the far uv ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the success of sophisticated photoionization models such as _ cloudy _",
    "@xcite in producing steep balmer decrements under blr conditions also made reddening of the blr seem unnecessary for explaining hydrogen line ratios .",
    "despite the strong arguments against reddening of the blr and continuum , @xcite argued that the solution to the hydrogen problem was that both the blr and continuum of agns suffer substantial extinction of the order of @xmath13 .",
    "they suggested that such high reddening could be reconciled with the lack of evidence for reddening in the uv if the extinction curve of dust near an agn differed significantly from an average milky way reddening curve .",
    "@xcite concurred that substantial reddening could be the cause of the low observed ly@xmath0/h@xmath1 ratios .",
    "@xcite found that the blr ly@xmath0/h@xmath0 ratio depended on the optical to uv continuum slope in a manner consistent with a reddening of @xmath14 .",
    "observational support for substantial blr and continuum reddenings in agns came from the discovery of correlations of continuum colours and balmer decrements with host - galaxy inclination , @xcite .",
    "these showed that there was significant _ optical _ reddening of at least @xmath15 from dust in the planes of the host galaxies @xcite . over the next decade a variety of studies pointed to typical agn reddenings of @xmath16 ( see section 4.2 below ) but the continuing lack of @xmath102175 absorption and , in particular , the lack of a strong downwards curvature of the spectrum into the far uv continued to point towards a lack of significant internal reddening @xcite .",
    "the discovery that the reddening curve of dust in the small magellanic cloud ( smc ) lacked the @xmath102175 absorption feature @xcite showed that it was possible for there to be dust without this feature , but the smc reddening curve rises even more steeply into the far ultraviolet than galactic curves and so should produce a strong downward curvature in agn spectra .",
    "the solution to the reddening dilemma was provided by @xcite who showed , as @xcite had speculated , that the reddening curve of dust close to the inner regions of an agn is radically different from previously known curves .",
    "not only did the reddening curve lack the @xmath102175 absorption feature , but the curve was essentially flat in the uv and showed no rise into the far uv ( see also @xcite , @xcite and @xcite ) . for a typical face - on",
    ", radio - selected agn @xcite estimated the reddening to be @xmath17 @xmath18 .    in this paper",
    "i first estimate the velocity - integrated , unreddened h@xmath0/h@xmath1 and ly@xmath0/h@xmath1 ratios for the blr and show that , contrary to what has been generally assumed for the last half century , the ratios are consistent with the case b values .",
    "i then discuss the implications of this for the reddening of agns , the structure of the blr , and dust covering factors .",
    "i argue that the hydrogen line ratios emitted by the highest velocity gas close to the black hole are case c. i propose that the discrepancy in accretion disc sizes found by reverberation mapping and microlensing when compared with classical accretion disc models is mostly explained by reddening .",
    "the most widely quoted line ratio for agns is h@xmath0/h@xmath1",
    ". it has been widely assumed , for reasons just outlined , that the unreddened ratio is steeper than case b. optically - thick photoionization models also show that the intrinsic ratio varies with physical conditions ( see for example , @xcite ) . are these assumptions correct ? to find the unreddened h@xmath0/h@xmath1 ratio one can not simply look for the lowest reported h@xmath0/h@xmath1 ratios since these will be outliers due to measuring errors . since the size of the blr is not much greater than the radius of the accretion disc producing the optical continuum emission ( light weeks compared with light days , say ) , it is reasonable to assume that the lines and the continuum have similar reddenings and therefore to look at the agns with the bluest continua",
    ". measuring errors might cause some extremely blue agns might be outliers in the distribution of _ continuum slopes _ but this will not affect the estimation of the h@xmath0/h@xmath1 ratios .",
    "contrary to expectations , @xcite have found from a careful study of a sample of blue agns ( which they considered to have negligible reddening ) that the velocity - integrated h@xmath0/h@xmath1 ratio shows a surprisingly low scatter of only 0.03 dex after allowance for observational errors .",
    "this strongly supports the use of h@xmath0/h@xmath0 as a reddening indicator for the blr .    if we accept that the observed velocity - integrated h@xmath0/h@xmath1 ratio primarily depends on reddening , it is reasonable to ask to what extent the blue agn sample of @xcite really is unreddened and whether the intrinsic velocity - integrated h@xmath0/h@xmath1 ratio is actually _ less _ than the value of 3.06 they propose .",
    "i argue here that this is indeed the case .",
    "h@xmath0 lies within the spectral coverage of the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) for @xmath19 .",
    "@xcite chose a sample of @xmath20 sdss dr4 spectra of agns within this redshift range and with a median signal - to - noise ( s / n ) ratio per pixel @xmath21 . from these they selected the 446 agns with spectral index @xmath22 ( where @xmath23 ) @xmath24 is measured from @xmath104030 to @xmath105600 ) .",
    "this corresponds to the bluest @xmath25% of the agns in the sdss sample . for these they present the intensities and many profile parameters of h@xmath0 and h@xmath1 after careful subtraction of contaminating lines etc .",
    "( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "because the agns are very blue , host - galaxy starlight was assumed to be negligible .    in order to investigate the extent to which the blue agn sample of @xcite is reddened",
    ", i have constructed a subset of extremely blue agns with @xmath26 .",
    "this extremely blue sample consists of 27 agns or about 0.6% of sdss agns with @xmath19 and s / n @xmath21 .",
    "@xcite noted that their blue agn sample is of systematically higher luminosity compared to less blue , low - redshift sdss agns .",
    "this could be because reddening decreases with luminosity as suggested by @xcite . to reduce the effect of possible luminosity - dependent reddening",
    ", a luminosity - matched control sample was constructed from the @xmath27 sample for comparison purposes .",
    "this subset was constructed as follows : for each of the bluest agns , two control agns were taken from the @xmath27 agns , the one immediately above the bluest agn in luminosity and the one immediately below it in luminosity .",
    "@xcite estimate a typical error in @xmath24 to be @xmath28 .",
    "properties of the @xmath26 agns were compared with those of the luminosity - matched subset of @xmath29 agns .",
    "properties compared were the redshift ( @xmath30 ) , the black hole mass , the eddington ratio , the luminosity of h@xmath0 , the equivalent width of h@xmath0 , the balmer decrement , the curvature of the optical spectrum , the fluxes in the _ galex _ fuv ( @xmath101528 ) and nuv ( @xmath102271 ) passbands , the uv to optical spectral shape , the radio luminosity , and line profile parameters ( line asymmetry , kurtosis , shape , fwhm , and dispersion  see @xcite for definitions ) .",
    "@xcite fit a single log - normal function to the distribution of balmer decrements .",
    "however , given that they made an arbitrary continuum colour cutoff at @xmath31 and since the observed ( uncorrected ) balmer decrement will be correlated with the observed continuum colour when there is reddening , the relative lack of steep h@xmath0/h@xmath1 ratios is simply a consequence of the colour cutoff .",
    "if redder agns ( @xmath32 ) had been included , the distribution would extend to much higher h@xmath0/h@xmath1 ratios .",
    "such ratios are well known in other samples ( for example , @xcite present cases of agns with extremely large h@xmath0/h@xmath1 ratios ) .",
    "the value of the mean h@xmath0/h@xmath1 ratio found by @xcite is thus affected by the continuum colour cutoff of the sample .    in order to estimate the unreddened h@xmath0/h@xmath1 ratio",
    "let us make three assumptions : ( a ) the velocity - integrated h@xmath0/h@xmath1 has a precise value , ( b ) steeper balmer decrements are only due to reddening , and ( c ) there is a flat distribution of @xmath17 for agns .",
    "the distribution of reddened h@xmath0/h@xmath1 ratios will then be a step function .",
    "the observed distribution will be this step function convolved with scatter due to measurement error and intrinsic spread . by fitting this to the low h@xmath0/h@xmath1 side of the distribution ,",
    "the unreddened ratio and the scatter can be estimated under these idealized assumptions .",
    "the assumption that the distribution of reddening is a step function is a conservative one .",
    "the result does not depend strongly on the assumed distribution of reddenings .",
    "if the distribution falls off with increasing reddening ( i.e. , there are fewer agns with higher reddenings ) , the analysis gives a somewhat higher intrinsic balmer decrement .",
    "however , there is a limit to this .",
    "the extreme case is that the distribution of reddenings is a @xmath33-function at zero .",
    "this corresponds to the assumption of @xcite that their blue agns are unreddened .",
    "a rising distribution of reddening ( unreddened agns are rare ) gives a lower intrinsic decrement .",
    "the limit of this is where there is a rising distribution with no scatter due to observational errors . in this limit",
    "the distribution of ratios is the just the distribution of reddenings and the intrinsic h@xmath0/h@xmath1 ratio is the lowest observed value .",
    "the distributions of h@xmath0/h@xmath1 ratios for the entire @xcite sample and for the @xmath26 subsample are shown in figure 1 .",
    "as expected , the bluest agns ( shown as a histogram at the bottom of figure 1 ) have a significantly flatter balmer decrement .",
    "the geometric mean ratio is h@xmath0/h@xmath34 .",
    "the corresponding geometric mean ratio for the luminosity - matched subset of the @xcite sample is h@xmath0/h@xmath35 ( consistent with the mean of 3.06 for the entire @xcite sdss sample ) .",

    "these correspond to the bluest 11% of @xmath19 agns observed by the sdss .",

    "the smooth ( red ) curve shows the same distribution if there is scatter of 0.055 dex due to measuring errors etc .",
    "this has been fit to the points shown as solid circles .",
    "the histogram at the bottom shows the distribution of balmer decrements for the bluest agns alone ( @xmath37 ) .",
    "this has been multiplied by a factor of four for ease of comparison.,width=302 ]    figure 1 also shows the fit of the hypothetical step - function distribution discussed in section 2.2 and its convolution with a log - normally distributed scatter .",
    "this is fit to the low h@xmath0/h@xmath1 side of the observed distribution ( the solid black circles ) .",
    "this gives an unreddened h@xmath0/h@xmath1 ratio of @xmath38 , which is slightly lower than the geometric mean for the very blue agns .",
    "as noted above the intrinsic ratio derived is not sensitive to the assumed form of the distribution of reddenings .",
    "the extreme case of a declining distribution is the @xcite vaue of h@xmath0/h@xmath39 .",
    "however , this is greater than the geometric mean ratio of 2.86 for the very bluest agns considered here so this is unlikely .",
    "the limit of the assumption that there is a rising distribution and no observational errors gives h@xmath0/h@xmath40 .",
    "these limiting cases thus support the intrinsic value being @xmath41 as given by the assumption of a flat distribution of reddenings .",
    "comparison of other properties between the bluest agns and the luminosity - matched control sample shows no significant differences for redshift , mass , eddington ratio , ultraviolet spectral shape ( as given by the fuv - nuv colour index ) , line widths or profile shapes .",
    "the only significant differences ( @xmath42 ) are in the uv luminosities , which are higher for the bluest agns , particularly compared with the @xmath43 band , and in the ratio of 2 @xmath44 m flux to @xmath45-band flux , which is higher for the redder agns .",
    "the bluest agns also have lower radio power but this is only marginally significant ( @xmath46 ) .      as noted , reddening decreases with luminosity ( see @xcite ) so the least reddened agns should be those with the highest luminosities .",
    "an independent derivation of the bluest h@xmath0/h@xmath1 ratio was made by looking at the highest luminosity agns from the larger sdss dr7 sample of @xcite . for the bluest half of agns with @xmath47 ( 2.5% of the dr7 agns with @xmath19 ) the median h@xmath0/h@xmath48 using the line intensity measurements from @xcite .",

    "these results were confirmed with additional observations by @xcite and @xcite .",

    "figure 2 shows the ly@xmath0/h@xmath1 ratio versus continuum slope from the combined data sets of @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "these data have the advantage of higher signal - to - noise ratio than the early observations because the uv spectra come from the _ hubble space telescope _ rather than from the _ international ultraviolet explorer _ for lyman @xmath0 observations of low - redshift agns , and there were also major improvements in ir detectors for observations of h@xmath1 in the high - redshift agns @xcite .",
    "the rest - frame uv and optical observations of the samples were also effectively simultaneous .",

    "note that neither set of observations was corrected for the host galaxy starlight contribution to the continuum flux at @xmath104861 .",

    "the scatter of the continuum flux ratio about the reddening line in figure 2 is only @xmath62 dex ( i.e. , less than 50% ) .",
    "this is consistent with observed object - to - object agn continuum to starlight ratios in typical spectroscopic apertures ( see , for example , table 12 of @xcite ) .",
    "the lack of differences between the extremely blue , low - redshift sdss agn sample constructed here , and the luminosity - matched control sample ( see section 2.1 ) indicate that _ there are no fundamental differences in the properties of the two samples other than those caused by reddening . _",
    "as noted , the agns are indistinguishable by mass , eddington ratio , or line profile ( which depends on the eddington ratio and the orientation ) .",
    "the marginally - significant difference in radio power is attributable to the spectroscopy targeting algorithm of the sdss .",
    "radio - loud agns in the sdss are steeper than radio - quiet ones because the sdss preferentially targeted point - source matches to _ first _ radio sources _ without reference to their colours _ , whilst radio - quiet agn candidates could only be selected by having non - stellar colours ( see @xcite for details ) .",

    "this greater ratio means that the optical continuum is , on average , 34% brighter relative to the ir flux in the bluest agn subset of the @xcite sample . for a standard milky way reddening curve this corresponds to a difference of @xmath72 .",

    "radio emission is a powerful tool for estimating the orientations of agns ( see , for example , @xcite ) and the important study of @xcite showed that extinction is very high ( @xmath81 1 to 1.5 ) in agns viewed at high inclinations ( lobe - dominated sources ) .",

    "these reddenings mean that agn luminosities are seriously underestimated if internal reddening is ignored . for h@xmath0/h@xmath88 , even if @xmath89 is only 3.1 , ( the typical galactic value ) there is a whole magnitude of extinction at @xmath105100 . if @xmath87 the extinction at @xmath105100 is 1.4 magnitudes .",
    "this means that luminosities at @xmath105100 for low - luminosity agns are underestimated by a factor of @xmath90 . at @xmath101450",

    "than the optical extinction because reddening curves with a higher @xmath89 are flatter in the uv . ] since the agn reddening curve is flat shortwards of @xmath101450 this means that the bolometric luminosity of well - studied , low - luminosity agns ( such as ngc  5548 ) is often underestimated by an order of magnitude or more .",
    "the largest sample of agns used for statistical purposes is now from the sdss .",
    "these are strongly biased towards blue objects @xcite .",
    "they also include many objects of higher luminosity .",
    "not surprisingly therefore , the median h@xmath0/h@xmath1 ratio for agns in the sdss is lower than for the well - studied nearby seyferts . for the dr7 agns the median ratio is 3.48 .",
    "if the unreddened h@xmath0/h@xmath1 ratio is 2.72 , the median reddening of the dr7 sample is @xmath92 .",

    "this value is lower than what is given here because they assumed the steeper intrinsic balmer decrement of @xcite .",
    "note also that the nai d and other absorption lines @xcite identify in stacked sdss spectra as interstellar absorption lines in the host galaxies are actually _ photospheric _ lines in stars of the host galaxies ( see the spectra and measurements of @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "the variation in equivalent widths of these lines is due to varying amounts of host galaxy starlight , not to varying interstellar absorption in the host galaxies . ]      by construction , the mean @xmath105100 luminosities of the bluest sdss agns and the control sample considered in section 2.2 are identical .",
    "agns are variable and the _ galex _ observations were not made at the same time as the sdss spectroscopy , but nonetheless for the bluest agns the ( geometric ) mean fuv and nuv fluxes are greater than those of the rest of the @xcite blue agn sample by a factors of @xmath94 and @xmath95 respectively . these numbers are only an upper limit to the relative extinctions ( colour excess ) between @xmath105100 and the _ galex _ bands because @xcite did not subtract out the host galaxy starlight contribution to the flux at @xmath105100 ( i.e. , the greater extinction of the control sample produces less of a change in the @xmath105100 flux than in the uv fluxes because the @xmath105100 flux includes a starlight contribution ) .",
    "for @xmath17 of 0.07 , the @xcite and @xcite reddening curves ( which are essentially identical after normalization ) predict that the fuv flux will be 1.3 times greater .",
    "this is consistent with the observed limit .",
    "if agns are reddened by an smc - like reddening curve , as advocated by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , the fuv will be @xmath96 times greater , which is marginally consistent with the observed limit .",
    "the similarity of the ( fuv - nuv ) colour index for the two samples is the most important constraint for the reddening curve . _",
    "a steep , rising , smc - like reddening curve is strongly ruled out _ because it predicts a 0.75 magnitude greater mean ( fuv - nuv ) colour for the control sample whereas the actual difference is only @xmath97 .",
    "the observed difference in uv colors is in good agreement , however , with the predictions of the flat @xcite and @xcite reddening curves ( @xmath98 and 0.13 magnitudes respectively ) or of the @xmath87 curve of @xcite ( 0.10 magnitudes ) .",
    "an additional major problem for a steep smc - like reddening curve is that for a typical nearby , well - studied seyfert with h@xmath0/h@xmath99 , an smc curve predicts an _ enormous _ reduction in the continuum and line flux at lyman @xmath0 .",
    "this is a factor of 170 if the intrinsic h@xmath0/h@xmath1 ratio is 2.72 as advocated here , or a factor of 35 is the @xcite ratio is used .",
    "an extinction curve that is flat in the uv solves other problems .",
    "for example , @xcite showed that the redder uv continua of low - ionization , broad - absorption - line quasars ( lo - bals ) could be explained by reddening , but noted that the low reddening they deduced assuming an smc reddening curve failed to explain the strong ir - to - optical flux ratios .",
    "a flat uv extinction curve removes this difficulty .",
    "the small change in the uv sed now corresponds to a much larger @xmath17 and can produce an order - of - magnitude increase in the ir - to - uv flux ratio as found by @xcite .",
    "what is remarkable about the unreddened h@xmath0/h@xmath1 ratios found here is that , rather than being steeper than case b , as in the vast number of optically - thick models calculated over the four decades or so , _ the ratio seems to be identical to a case b value . _ similarly , the ly@xmath0/h@xmath1 ratio , rather than being much less than case b , is also consistent with being case b. in contrast to this , models of line ratios with high optical depths in the balmer lines do _ not _ naturally produce case b line ratios",
    ". inspection of table 3 of @xcite or figure 3 of @xcite , for example , shows that a wide range of ratios are produced depending on the physical conditions .",
    "i believe that case b line ratios are a natural consequence of the structure of the blr .",
    "@xcite(gkn ) argue that the blr is a flattened ensemble of small clouds above the plane of the accretion disc and that it is optically thick in the equatorial direction . as a consequence",
    "the inner blr clouds shield the outer blr clouds from the ionizing radiation from the inner disc and corona .",
    "this produces strong radial stratification in ionization of the blr in excellent agreement with observations ( see gkn and @xcite ) .",
    "previous blr models had a focus on resolving the hydrogen line problem by having very high optical depths .",
    "the individual clouds were optically thick and the models only considered radiation escaping from the illuminated front side of the cloud and the unilluminated back side .",
    "this fails to produce the observed ionization stratification ( see @xcite ) .",
    "these optically - thick cloud models ignore that fact that photons are at least twice as likely to escape _ sideways _ from the cloud .",
    "in contrast to the standard modelling approach , in the gkn model the _ ensemble _ of clouds is optically thick in the lyman continuum ( i.e. , the ensemble matter - bounded in the equatorial direction ) but _ each individual cloud is optically thin . _",
    "because type 1 agns are always seen close to face on , the radiation we see comes directly out from the clouds and hence the path of escape has a very low optical depth .",
    "this is illustrated in the cartoon in figure 3 .",
    "we can thus see that the gkn model _ requires _ case b line ratios because of the ease of escape of line photons from individual clouds .",
    "the evidence for case b hydrogen line ratios is thus strong support for the gkn model .      .",
    "@xcite discovered that the blr balmer decrement was significantly flatter in the high - velocity wings ( see also @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "given that the decrement for the velocity - integrated profile is well within the range of values for case b , this means that the h@xmath0/h@xmath1 ratio in the high - velocity wings ( only a small part of the total line flux ) is _ less _ than the standard case b value .",
    "this has a very natural explanation : the case b balmer decrement becomes flatter at higher densities .",
    "figure 4 shows the theoretical case b h@xmath0/h@xmath1 ratios as a function of density , @xmath100 .",
    "these have been calculated using _ cloudy 13.03 _ @xcite .",

    "if the higher velocity blr gas closer to the centre of the accretion disc has a higher density it will therefore have a flatter balmer decrement as is observed .",
    "the higher density is the cause of the much higher heii / h@xmath0 ratio at high velocities as well ( see @xcite . )",

    "both observationally and in _ cloudy _ calculations this increase of ly@xmath0/h@xmath1 in the high - velocity wings is a much stronger effect than the corresponding decrease in h@xmath0/h@xmath1 .",
    "the observed increase of ly@xmath0/h@xmath1 can be a factor of @xmath105 ( see figure 1 of @xcite ) .",
    "the case b calculations of @xcite do not reproduce this behaviour .",
    "this is because they did not consider continuum fluorescence in the lyman lines .",
    "the case where this is important has been called case c @xcite .",
    "unlike case a and case b , case c does not give definite predicted ratios depending on density and temperature .",
    "instead , for a given continuum shape , the line ratios are a strong function of the optical depths in the lyman lines ( see @xcite ) . for low optical depths the ly@xmath0/h@xmath1 can be as great as @xmath106 or more .",

    "if , for the sake of argument , we assume that a typical blr cloud has a density of @xmath107 @xmath102 and that these clouds are located a few light days from the center of an agn with a luminosity of @xmath108 ergs s@xmath109 ( typical numbers of a low - luminosity agn ) , then the curves in figure 5 give the predicted ly@xmath0/h@xmath1 ratio as a function of cloud size for different distances from the centre .",

    "even though the ratio of ly@xmath0/h@xmath1 is high , the amount of ly@xmath0 produced is less than 1% of the amount produced by radiation - bounded clouds .",
    "a solution to this is to have a high _ continuum _ optical depth through the cloud system ( as in the gkn model ) while maintaining a low ly@xmath0 optical depth in each individual cloud .",
    "this is readily accomplished if there is a velocity difference between the clouds @xcite .",

    "although @xmath113 is usually been thought of as a macroscopic covering factor with 100% absorption of uv radiation within some angle of the equatorial plane and 0% absorption in the polar directions , @xmath113 can equally well be thought of as a microscopic covering factor and thus including directions in which the optical depth is not large .",

    "@xcite had similarly argued that the non - linear relationship between x - ray luminosity and optical luminosity was also due to luminosity - dependent extinction .",

    "@xcite get a similarly high covering factor for these agns .",
    "a 100% average covering factor is physically impossible because any individual agn must have @xmath122 and there is a wide spread in @xmath119 which will give a wide spread in @xmath113 among these agns .",

    "raising @xmath124 for the lowest luminosity agns by a factor of several , as advocated here , removes this problem .",
    "another advantage of the extinction corrections proposed here is that they remove the discrepancy between energetics estimates of the dust covering fraction and estimates from the relative fraction of type-2 agns at low luminosities . as noted in 6.2.1 ,",
    "if no extinction corrections are applied to the energetics calculations ( as was the case , for example , in the estimates of @xcite and @xcite ) much higher covering factors are found for the lowest luminosity agns . in contrast to this , radio , ir , and volume - limited samples all agree in showing no change in the fraction of type-2 agns ( about 50% ) with luminosity @xcite .",
    "allowance for extinction brings the estimates into agreement .",
    "the bluest agn subset of the @xcite sample considered in sections 2.1 and 2.2 is expected to have almost zero reddening .",
    "therefore their ratio of ir to optical flux ( see section 6.1 ) should be close to the intrinsic ratio .",
    "on the basis of optical and near - ir colours @xcite defined a class of what they call  hot - dust - poor\"(hdp ) agns .",
    "these are about 8 - 10 % of sdss agns @xcite .",
    "they considered most non - hdp agns to be essentially unreddened .",
    "however , inspection of the optical and optical  ir spectral indices in figure 1 of @xcite shows that if the non - hdp agns are reddened then their hdp agns are consistent with simply being unreddened agns .",
    "compared with the hdp agns , typical non - hdp agns have a reddening of @xmath125 as advocated here .",
    "likewise , figure 10 of @xcite shows that the @xmath126 ratio is a factor of two less for the hdp agns than for sdss agns .",
    "this is again in excellent agreement with the mean extinction being proposed here .",
    "it should be noted , however , that two of the three @xmath127 agns identified by @xcite as lacking near - ir dust emission have a @xmath126 ratio _ much _ lower than the hdp agns of @xcite ( see figure 10 of @xcite ) .",
    "these very high redshift agns do indeed seem to be genuinely lacking hot dust .",
    "it is interesting to note that even the bluest 10% of the low - redshift agns targeted by the sdss ( i.e. , the @xcite sample ) still have significant reddening . if the differences in @xmath24 and h@xmath0/h@xmath1 are due to reddening this corresponds to the subset of the bluest agns ( 0.6% of the sdss dr4 agns ) having a reddening that is lower by @xmath93 than the control sample . note that we can not be sure that even this bluest 0.6% is unreddened .",
    "while @xmath93 is a modest visual extinction of 0.44 magnitudes ( a factor of 50% ) for an @xmath87 reddening curve , at @xmath101450 the flux has been underestimated by a factor of 1.8 .",
    "the bluest 0.6% of the low - redshift sdss dr4 agns are really a _ much _ smaller fraction of the total agn population than 0.6% for a couple of reasons .",
    "firstly , because of the steepness of agn luminosity functions , if low - luminosity agns are reddened by @xmath128 this will have increased the fraction of the bluest agns in a flux - limited sample by a factor of @xmath51 . secondly , colour - based selection will further favour blue objects .",
    "infra - red selection finds large numbers of reddened agns .",
    "@xcite estimate that these heavily reddened agns ( @xmath129 ) make up 25% to 60% of the underlying type-1 agn population .",
    "we have to remember in addition that more than half of agns have the blr and accretion disc hidden from our direct line of sight ( i.e. , they are type-2 agns or are totally obscured ) . for example , @xcite find that agns with @xmath130 @xmath131 make up about about @xmath132% of the number density and luminosity density of the accreting supermassive black hole population with @xmath133 erg / s , averaged over cosmic time .",
    "an important thing we can deduce from this extreme rareness of thermal agns with low reddening is that _ the presence of dust above the accretion disc and blr is a ubiquitous part of the thermal agn phenomenon .",
    "_ this should not be a surprise since dust surrounding an agn has long been recognized to be an essential part of thermal agns @xcite .",
    "the dust in agns , which has properties very different from typical interstellar dust @xcite , has been expelled from the equatorial plane and it is quite likely that this dusty outflow _ is _ what is commonly called the torus ( e.g. , as proposed by @xcite ) .",
    "this scenario is supported by mid - ir interferometric observations which show that the dust is elongated on parsec scales in the polar direction @xcite and that this dust accounts for the _ majority _ of the mid - ir emission ( see discussion in @xcite ) .",
    "radiation is also removed from our line of sight by scattering as well as absorption .",
    "the albedo of dust grains from the near ir to the near uv is about 0.6 and at short wavelengths the scattering is strongly in the forwards direction @xcite .",
    "when the dust is optically thin along our line of sight this scattering will produce small scattering halos around agns .",
    "such halos have been observed .",
    "in fact they dominate the light in many agns .",

    "@xcite also point out that the predicted fraction is a lot less than the @xmath139 predicted from energetics .",
    "they suggest that the solution to this discrepancy is that rather than obscuration being  all or nothing \" ( 0% for type 1 agns and 100% for type 2 agns ) , many type-1 agns are seen through partial obscuration .",

    "cool molecular gas in the equatorial plane is not shown.,width=313 ]      the amount of reddening found here is substantially greater than the reddening of the nuclei of normal early type galaxies .",
    "this suggests that the dust is associated with the active nucleus . since the size scale of the nlr",
    "is known approximately in agns , the relative reddenings of the nlr and the blr are an important clue to the location of the dust .",
    "@xcite found that the balmer decrements of the blr were steeper than those of the nlr ( see their figure 2 ) .",
    "more recent data confirm this and the nlr reddening seems to be an approximate lower limit to the blr reddening ( see figure 8 of @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite also show that both the equivalent width of [ oiii ] @xmath105007 and the [ oiii ] @xmath105007/h@xmath1 ratio increase with the blr balmer decrement in a manner which is consistent with the dust being located between the blr and nlr .",
    "there therefore seems to be foreground dust which reddens both the nlr and the inner regions of agns , but when there is heavy reddening of the continuum and blr it is caused by dust located between the blr and the nlr ( or in the innermost part of the nlr ) .",

    "most agns are within an order of magnitude or so of the eddington limit .",
    "the standard eddington limit is calculated for electron scattering . however , dust grains have a much higher cross section than electrons ( see , for example , @xcite ) , so when dust forms it will readily be blown away from the agn by radiation pressure .",

    "it can be seen that these angles are broadly consistent with the half - opening angle predicted by the type-1/type-2 ratio and the half - opening angle of scattering cones ( see above ) . in real agns",
    "the dust will have a clumpier distribution than shown in figure 6 .",
    "the maximum outflow velocity is of the order of 800 km s@xmath109",
    "@xcite    close to the centre of the agn the dust temperature will be close to the sublimation temperature .",
    "the dust temperature will fall off as the flow moves away from the centre . for type-1 agns",
    "we observe the side of the dust outflow coming towards us since the far side will be heavily attenuated by the cold , dense molecular gas in the equatorial plane .",
    "@xcite find that the ir reverberation lags of the hot dust in response to continuum variability vary little with wavelength and show how this is a natural consequence of the dust being in a bi - conical outflow since the cones will be roughly parallel to the iso - delay surfaces of reverberation mapping ( see their figures 2 and 3 ) .",
    "as was shown by @xcite , a classical accretion disc has a @xmath142 radial gradient in surface temperature . by wien s law",
    "the effective emission radius for any wavelength therefore varies as @xmath143 .",
    "lynden - bell also showed that such a disc gives an @xmath144 spectrum . when the disc reprocesses variable short wavelength radiation from the innermost regions of the agn the difference in radii producing different wavelengths can be found from the time lags between the responses of the different wavelength regions @xcite and hence the radius producing a given wavelength can be found . from a study of wavelength - dependent lags of the optical continua of 14 agns",
    "@xcite discovered that the observed sizes of the discs were systematically larger than predicted by the luminosities of the agns ( see their figure 2 ) .",
    "they pointed out that agreement would be better if the absolute magnitudes of the agns were about a magnitude brighter .",
    "a detailed re - analysis and interpretation of the @xcite observations is given by @xcite .",
    "the size discrepancy is also confirmed in the recent reverberation mapping study of ngc  5548 by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "completely independent confirmation of this discovery has been provided by gravitational microlensing studies .",
    "microlensing fluctuations are sensitive to the half - light radius of the region responsible for emission at the wavelength of observation @xcite .",
    "@xcite found that microlensing of pg 1115 + 080 implied a substantially larger size than would be expected for a standard accretion disc .",
    "@xcite found that this was generally true for microlensed agns . @xcite and",
    "@xcite , looking at a large number of cases of microlensing , find this size discrepancy to be a factor of four or five .",
    "the median h@xmath0/h@xmath1 ratio for the 14 agns for which @xcite estimated wavelength - dependent delays is 4.04 .",
    "if we take the unreddened broad - line balmer decrement to be 2.72 , as advocated here and adopt a standard milky way extinction curve , this gives a median reddening of @xmath17 = 0.36 .",
    "this means that the agns of @xcite are indeed a magnitude brighter at @xmath105100 as they speculated .",
    "however , for dust with a flat reddening curve , @xmath89 will be larger , perhaps as large as @xmath145 ( see @xcite ) . in this case",
    "the agns are @xmath146 magnitudes brighter at @xmath105100 .",
    "this is a factor of four in optical luminosity and a factor of @xmath147 in the uv .",
    "since the size of the accretion disc scales as the square root of the luminosity , this naturally explains the larger disc sizes found by @xcite and by the more recent microlensing studies .",
    "the radius of the region in a disc emitting most of the radiation at a given wavelength also depends on the radial temperature gradient in the disc @xcite .",
    "this temperature gradient is flatter than the @xmath142 gradient of a classical accretion disc ( see @xcite ) .",
    "this causes the region to be somewhat larger than predicted in the classical case but this effect is not enough in itself to explain the observed large sizes @xcite .      as discussed in 4.2 , for a typical sdss agn with an internal reddening @xmath125 the intrinsic flux at @xmath101450 is 4 or 5 times greater than observed .",
    "if the extinction curve to shorter wavelengths is flat , as suggested by @xcite , then the bolometric luminosities are also 4 or 5 times greater . if the curve is rising to shorter wavelengths ( something _ not _ favoured by the observations considered here ) , the corrections to the bolometric luminosities would be much greater .",
    "an increase in the bolometric luminosity means that the total mass of black holes in the universe estimated by the sotan argument @xcite has to be increased .",
    "recent work on the stellar dynamical measurement of black hole masses to which agn black hole masses are scaled , has also been leading to an upward revision of the black hole mass scale by a factor of three or so for various reasons @xcite .",
    "if the total bolometric luminosity of agns and the black hole masses are both increased by comparable amounts then there is no change in the mean radiative efficiency .",
    "the number density of agns and the typical sed are important factors influencing the intergalactic radiation field ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "hard radiation from agns could dominate the reionization of the universe with little need for a contribution from normal star - forming galaxies @xcite .",
    "@xcite have shown that comparison of the most recent statistics for the low - redshift ly@xmath0 forest with simulations of the intergalactic medium ( igm ) require the metagalactic photoionization rate to be a factor of five higher than had been predicted .",
    "they call this the `` photon underproduction crisis ''",
    ". if our ideas about the low - redshift igm are not to be abandoned then the flux of ionizing photons at low redshifts must be increased .",
    "the reddenings argued for here offer a natural solution to this problem without the need to invoke an undetected population of agns , or to invoke exotic new sources of photons ( e.g. , decaying or annihilating dark - matter particles ) .",
    "because the extra photons are coming from a change in the far uv sed , there is no difficulty in satisfying the constraints of the x - ray background ( i.e. , the x - ray sed of agns is unchanged ) . by considering the heii proximity effect in the intergalactic medium , @xcite also conclude that the 1  4 rydberg radiation field from agns is considerably harder than normally assumed .",
    "conclusions are as follows :    1 .",
    "even the bluest 10% of sdss agns still have significant reddening .",
    "the unreddened , velocity - averaged balmer decrement of the broad - line region of agns is probably a case b value of h@xmath0/h@xmath148 .",
    "the correlation between the ly@xmath0/h@xmath1 ratio and optical to uv spectral index supports the velocity - averaged ly@xmath0/h@xmath1 ratio also being case b. 3 .",
    "the uv colours of the bluest sdss agns considered here argue strongly against the extinction curve of agn dust being smc - like .",
    "instead , the observations are consistent with the flat agn reddening curve of @xcite .",
    "these observations also support the idea that the intrinsic uv / optical / ir colours of agns are similar .",
    "case b hydrogen ratios are a natural consequence of the self - shielding blr model of @xcite where the ensemble of blr clouds is optically thick parallel to the accretion disc but individual blr clouds are optically thin and line photons readily escape perpendicular to the disc .",
    "5 .   the flatter balmer decrement in the high - velocity wings of the lines is a consequence of higher densities closer to the black hole .",
    "the greatly enhanced ly@xmath0/h@xmath1 ratio in the high - velocity wings is a consequence of lyman line fluorescence ( i.e. , case c conditions ) in the optically - thin gas closest to the black hole .",
    "the ensemble of clouds is optically thick in the lyman continuum , but individual cloudlets are optically thin in the lyman lines because of the turbulence of the blr .",
    "the reddenings of agns implied by observed hydrogen line ratios imply that the typical , nearby , optically - selected agn is almost an order of magnitude brighter in the far uv .",
    "this resolves the problem of accretion disks being larger than expected for apparent agn luminosities .",
    "allowance for the greater average extinction in low - luminosity agns removes the problem of dust covering factors apparently exceeding 100% .",
    "so - called  hot - dust - poor \" agns are simply normal agns which happen to have low reddening .",
    "the inner most dust attenuating type-1 agns originates in a dust driven outflow of the narrow - line region gas from the outer edge of the broad - line region .",
    "the extra ionizing radiation from agns potentially solves the intergalactic medium `` photon underproduction crisis '' .",
    "the mass of black holes in the universe is greater than hitherto thought .",
    "i am most grateful to ski antonucci and bill mathews for numerous comments and discussions .",
    "i have also benefitted considerably from discussions of hydrogen line ratios with gary ferland , and discussions of agn reddening and dust issues with victor oknyansky , clio heard , and jonathan stern .",

    "<S> + low - redshift active galactic nuclei ( agns ) with extremely blue optical spectral indices are shown to have a mean , velocity - averaged , broad - line h@xmath0/h@xmath1 ratio of @xmath2 , consistent with a baker - menzel case b value . comparison of a wide range of properties of the very bluest agns with those of a luminosity - matched subset of the dong et al . </S>",
    "<S> blue agn sample indicates that the only difference is the internal reddening . </S>",
    "<S> ultraviolet fluxes are brighter for the bluest agns by an amount consistent with the flat agn reddening curve of gaskell et al . </S>",
    "<S> ( 2004 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the lack of a significant difference in the _ galex _ ( fuv  nuv ) colour index strongly rules out a steep smc - like reddening curve and also argues against an intrinsically harder spectrum for the bluest agns . </S>",
    "<S> for very blue agns the ly@xmath0/h@xmath1 ratio is also consistent with being the case b value . </S>",
    "<S> the case b ratios provide strong support for the self - shielded broad - line model of gaskell , klimek & nazarova . </S>",
    "<S> it is proposed that the greatly enhanced ly@xmath0/h@xmath1 ratio at very high velocities is a consequence of continuum fluorescence in the lyman lines ( case c ) .    </S>",
    "<S> reddenings of agns mean that the far - uv luminosity is often underestimated by up to an order of magnitude . </S>",
    "<S> this is a major factor causing the discrepancies between measured accretion disc sizes and the predictions of simple accretion disc theory . </S>",
    "<S> dust covering fractions for most agns are lower than has been estimated . </S>",
    "<S> the total mass in lower mass supermassive black holes must be greater than hitherto estimated .    </S>",
