    "the question of possible modifications of hadron properties in the nuclear medium has attracted considerable interest in recent years .",
    "this interest stems from the hope that studies of these effects can clarify the interplay of the competing degrees of freedom in the nucleus .",
    "in particular it may be possible to learn about explicit quark degrees of freedom in the nucleus through such studies .",
    "there have been several theoretical as well as experimental investigations of these effects , and evidence is gathering that indeed such modifications do take place .",
    "several studies have been carried out for the modifications of meson properties in heavy ion and other collisions @xcite .",
    "photonuclear reactions also lend themselves to investigations of this type @xcite . in particular ,",
    "a promising area of investigation is the photoproduction of @xmath0 mesons on nuclei in the energy range corresponding to the second resonance region of the nucleon .",
    "the fact that one resonance , the s@xmath1(1535 ) , dominates the production process at these energies , makes it attractive to look at these reactions for clues on changes in its properties in the nuclear medium .",
    "three pioneering and complementary measurements of the inclusive eta photoproduction on nuclei have been reported in recent years .",
    "the earlier measurements of robig - landau _",
    "et al _ @xcite at mami included cross sections on a number of nuclei from threshold up to a photon energy of 800 mev .",
    "these cross sections displayed the expected rise on the low energy side of the resonance .",
    "few years later measurements of the same reaction were performed at kek @xcite , extending the energy range to 1gev .",
    "this group reported that a broad resonance due to the excitation and decay of the s@xmath1 resonance in the nucleus has been observed for the first time .",
    "in a recent investigation , kinoshita _ et al _",
    "@xcite reported on measurements of this reaction on c and cu targets at lns , for photon energies up to 1.1 gev .",
    "these authors indicated the importance of the contributions from other nucleon resonances in the second resonance region in addition to the dominant s@xmath1 , at energies higher than 900 mev .",
    "the authors of references @xcite performed calculations for their data using an adaptation of the quantum molecular dynamics model .",
    "@xcite performed calculations based on the semi - classical buu transport model .",
    "another approach was that of maruyama and chiba @xcite who carried out relativistic calculations in infinite nuclear matter based on an effective lagrangian and a scaling factor to account for the final state interactions of the @xmath0 mesons .    in the present paper we present an analysis of the data based on a relativistic model for the inclusive photoproduction on finite nuclei .",
    "the main ingredients of model are the use of an effective lagrangian approach ( benmerrouche _ et al_@xcite ) and the relativistic mean field approach to nuclear dynamics @xcite .",
    "the final state interactions of the outgoing @xmath0 meson are taken into account .",
    "this fully non - local model has been discussed recently for the cases of exclusive and incoherent photoproduction @xcite .",
    "these non - local calculations , in contrast to earlier local ones @xcite , allow us to include possible density dependent changes in the mass and width of the resonances in the nuclear medium .",
    "the justification for the claim that the inclusive data from kek , mainz and lns may reveal changes in the properties of the s@xmath1 resonance requires some discussion .",
    "it is known that the s@xmath1 is the main contributor to the @xmath0 photoproduction cross section on free nucleons in the 0.6 - 1gev range .",
    "there are contributions from neighboring resonances and from nucleon born terms as well as meson exchange diagrams ; but these are small by comparison .",
    "we will show in the course of our discussion that this situation carries over to the inclusive production on nuclei .",
    "the contributions are only at the few percent level , a situation which allows us to probe whether the existing data does reveal any information regarding the properties of the s@xmath1 in the medium . as we shall show there are remaining uncertainties regarding other aspects of the analysis which are more important compared to the small contributions of other diagrams .",
    "the plan of the paper follows a recent discussion of the non - local relativistic model for the exclusive quasifree photoproduction of @xmath0 mesons .",
    "the reaction amplitude is cast in a general form in section [ form ] where the method of evaluation of the amplitude in its non - local form is outlined .",
    "the results of the model and the discussion are given in section [ results ] .",
    "conclusions are given in section [ conclusion ] .",
    "in the inclusive reaction , a photon is absorbed by the nucleus and as a result an @xmath0 meson is produced .",
    "this meson is the only detected particle and there is no information about the final state of the nuclear system . in the present work it is assumed that the inclusive reaction is based on the exclusive reaction in which a single nucleon is ejected in the continum in the course of the production process @xcite .",

    "@xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 are wave functions describing the final nucleon , initial nucleon and @xmath0 meson , respectively .",

    "calculations without inclusion of the final state interaction of @xmath0 meson revealed that the u - channel contribution ( second term in ( [ eq1 ] ) ) is less by two orders of magnitude than that of s - channel ( first term in ( [ eq1 ] ) ) . as a result",
    "the non - locality and possible medium modifications of the former will have a negligible effect on the calculated cross section .",
    "we thus ignore this very small change and treat the u - channel locally as in @xcite .",
    "the dominant s - channel diagram is treated in the non - local approach .",
    "the medium modifications of the properties of the nucleon resonance are often expressed in terms of changes of its mass and width from their free values in a manner dependent on the nuclear density @xcite .",
    "our non - local approach can accommodate these density dependent parameters for the resonance . after implementing the density dependent mass and width for the resonance in the s - channel part of the above amplitude , we calculate the resulting integral following an approach similar to the one used in ref.@xcite .",

    "the inclusive cross section is obtained by numerical integration of the exclusive cross section over the phase space of the final nucleon and summing over all energy levels of the target nucleus .    in the following section we shall explore whether the available data can be used to clarify the issue of possible modifications of the mass and width of the s@xmath1 resonance . for this purpose",
    "we will adopt phenomenological forms of these parameters suggested by earlier works @xcite .",
    "for mass we use a density dependent form suggested by the quark - meson coupling model for hadrons @xcite .",
    "@xmath45 for width we use a density dependent form given in @xcite which includes the broadening of the resonance width due to its collisions with hadrons in the medium , @xmath46",

    "it is well known that the photoproduction process on the nucleon , in the second resonance region , is dominated by the s@xmath1(1535 ) diagram .",
    "we begin our discussion by showing that this situation carries over to the inclusive reactions on nuclei .",
    "the collective contributions from other diagrams are small by comparison .",
    "this is shown in fig.1 .",
    "figure 1(a ) shows the angular distribution of the inclusive cross section of the reaction on @xmath48c at a photon incident energy e@xmath49 = 820 mev .",
    "the solid curve gives the s@xmath1 contribution while the dashed curve includes the additional contributions due to the d@xmath50 , the nucleon pole terms and the meson exchange diagrams .",
    "the total inclusive cross section on @xmath48c for photon energies in the range 0.65 - 1.1 gev is depicted in fig.1(b ) .",
    "the dominance of the s@xmath1 contributions is clearly evident from these comparisons .",
    "it is worth mentioning here that this rather fortunate circumstance arises not only from the relative smallness of the contributions of the other diagrams , but also from strong cancellations among these contributions .",
    "fig.2 shows the inclusive angular distributions for c , al and cu . for each target nucleus",
    ", we show the distributions at two photon energies from among those measured : 740 mev and 980 mev .",
    "the data are those of kek @xcite , lns @xcite and mainz ( only for @xmath48c at 740 mev ) @xcite .",
    "the solid curves represent non - local calculations that assume free propagation for the s@xmath1 resonance .",
    "we take the free mass and width of the resonance to be 1535 mev and 160 mev , respectively . in these and",
    "subsequent figures these curves are labeled free. general trends in the data are reproduced and the agreement is almost quantitative in some cases .",
    "the main exception is the case of al at 980 mev .",
    "there are some disagreements among the measurements from kek and lns in the case of cu and our theoretical calculations show better agreement with the latter measurements .    the dashed curves in fig .",
    "2 represent calculations in which , following suggestions of ref.@xcite , the width of the s@xmath1 resonance is assumed to undergo density dependent broadening in the medium of the form given in eq([eq8 ] ) with c = 50 mev .",
    "we note that the broadening leads to reduction in the cross sections for all three nuclei .",
    "it may be argued that the effect leads to a worsening in the accord with the data for c at the lower energy ( 740 mev ) and by contrast to a slight improvement at 980 mev . for al",
    "the quality of agreement with the data remains about the same , whereas for cu , the disagreement between measurements makes it difficult to judge the outcome .",
    "we now consider the effect of a reduction of mass on the angular distributions . in the discussion of ref.@xcite",
    ", the authors suggested that the nucleon mass in the medium is reduced according to eq.([eq7 ] ) with a value of the reduction parameter b = 0.14 .",
    "fig.3 shows the results of the angular distribution for the same targets and photon energies as in fig.2 .",
    "the dash - dotted curves are obtained when the above value is used for the reduction of the mass of the s@xmath1 .",
    "compared to calculations with no medium effects ( solid curves ) , we note a large decrease in the cross section .",
    "this also brings the calculated cross section much below the data .",
    "this clearly indicates that if the mass of the s@xmath1 were reduced in the medium , the scale of reduction would be much smaller than is indicated by the value of b given above .",
    "if the reduction in mass is made weaker the effect becomes smaller .",
    "for example the dashed curves show the calculations for a much smaller value of b ( b = 0.014 ) . here",
    "the effect on the cross section is relatively small .",
    "we note that at the lower energy the effect leads to a slight increase in the magnitude of the cross section while the effect at the higher energy is a slight decrease .",
    "the data for the total inclusive cross section ( obtained by integrating the angular distributions discussed above ) are shown in figs.4 - 6 .",
    "these include the data for the three nuclei c , al and cu from kek , mainz and lns .",
    "fig.4 displays the inclusive data for c. in fig.4(a ) we show the effects of changes in the mass of the s@xmath1 on the behavior of the total inclusive cross section in the energy range from near threshold to 1.1 gev .",
    "the solid curve represents the case of no medium modification of the mass .",
    "we note that these calculations provide reasonable agreement with the data particularly over and beyond the peak , but are slightly lower at the lower energies .",
    "the dashed and dash - dotted curves represent the two cases where the mass modification parameter b of eq.([eq7 ] ) has the values 0.014 and 0.035 , respectively . the latter value , though it improves the accord with the data on the lower energy side of the peak somewhat , still gives a strong suppression on the higher energy side .",
    "calculations with the smaller value of b lie blew the data at energies above 900 mev .    in fig.4(b )",
    "we present similar comparisons involving changes to the width of the resonance .",
    "we show two cases for density dependent changes in the width of the form given in eq.([eq8 ] ) .",
    "the dash - dotted curve is for a value of c = 25 mev and the dashed curve is for c = 50 mev .",
    "both these calculations lead to a lowering of the cross section away from the data .",
    "figs.5 shows similar comparisons for the kek inclusive cross section on al and fig.6 compares the calculations with the kek and lns data for cu .",
    "the qualitative features of the results are similar . again",
    "the data rule out any strong reduction ( associated with b = 0.14 ) in the mass of the resonance . a reduction in the mass of s@xmath1 corresponding to a value of b = 0.014 brings the calculations somewhat closer to the data for al , but leads to a reduced cross section at higher energies for cu . in the case of the modification of width",
    "we note that the density dependent width of eq.([eq8 ] ) , with c = 50 mev , leads to a suppression of the cross section away from the data .",
    "we have argued earlier that the dominance of the s@xmath1 contributions is used to limit the forgoing comparisons and discussions to this contribution . in fig 7",
    "we revisit this question . in part",
    "( a ) we show the results for the case of production on c for the s@xmath1 .",
    "we compare this with the results in the lower panel ( b ) based on calculations in which the small contributions from the d@xmath50 , the nucleon pole and the t - channel vector meson diagrams are included .",
    "these contributions , being small , are calculated using the local approximation ( the non - local corrections in this case are expected to be negligible ) .",
    "each of the curves in panel ( a ) has a counterpart in panel ( b ) : the solid curves represent the free calculations , the dashed curves represent calculations in which the mass reduction is affected by a value b = 0.014 .",
    "the dash - dotted curves represent calculations in which we make changes in both mass and width of the resonance .",
    "we assumed the width is reduced to 150 mev ( from 160 mev ) and in the meantime the mass is reduced as above .",
    "it is seen from the figures that the inclusion of the additional contributions , though it modifies the cross section slightly , does not alter the character of the comparison with the data , from those involving only the s@xmath1 contributions .",
    "the preceding comparisons were based on calculations using the optical potential dw1 to describe the final state interaction of the @xmath0 meson .",
    "the calculations of the cross sections are sensitive to the optical potential used .",
    "for example we show in fig.8 a comparison of the cross sections calculated using one of the optical potentials derived by oset _",
    "et al._@xcite .",
    "these calculations of the eta optical potential depend on the magnitude of the real part of s@xmath1 self energy in the medium , and we have used the case for which the real part of the s@xmath1 self - energy is -50 mev .",
    "the cross sections are seen to lie below those calculated using the dw1 potential .",
    "it is clear that this type of uncertainty should be kept in mind before a final verdict is gleaned form the data as to the extent of any medium modifications of the properties of the resonance .",
    "a relativistic non - local model for the inclusive photoproduction of @xmath0 mesons from complex nuclei is introduced .",
    "this model is based on the dominance of the contributions due to the formation of the s@xmath1 resonance .",
    "the inclusion of non - local effects is the main improvement over our earlier work which was applied to the limited data available at the time .",
    "moreover , the non - local approach makes it possible to include mass and width parameters of the resonance that may depend on the nuclear density .",
    "calculations were first carried out using the free mass and width for the resonance ( i.e. no medium effect ) .",
    "comparison of the results of these calculations with the data available for c , al and cu , reproduce the over all shape of the angular distributions as well as the total cross section data up to 1.0 gev .",
    "it is worth noting that our results are in somewhat better agreement with the recent data of lns than with the older data .",
    "the influence of possible medium modifications of the properties of the resonance was also studied .",
    "simple density dependent forms for the mass and width of the resonance were used to test the effect these have on the calculated cross sections and their accord with the data .",
    "comparison with the data showed that reductions in the mass of s@xmath1 on a scale similar to that suggested for the nucleon leads to cross sections that disagree strongly with the data .",
    "the data can accommodate much weaker changes in the mass and some broadening of the width . although one can claim some scattered instances of improvement with these changes , it is not possible to claim that the data show clear evidence of medium modifications of resonance parameters .",
    "the lack of this evidence is due in part to the occasional disagreement between different measurements .",
    "there is also the inherent weakness in our present knowledge of the final state interaction of the eta meson with nuclei ( represented here by the optical potential ) , which adds to the uncertainty . in conclusion",
    "we would estimate that if any medium modifications of the properties of the s@xmath1 resonance existed , they would likely be rather small .",
    "this is in agreement with the general conclusions reached by the authors of refs.@xcite .",
    "we would like to thank t. yorita and t. kinoshita for their helpful communications regarding their data .",
    "we also are grateful to e. sumber , from computing and network services at university of alberta for parallelizing our computer code and to west grid for allowing us to use their facilities to perform our computations .",
