    "consider the task of finding the smallest area rectangular region that encloses a given number @xmath0 of circular disks of equal diameter .",
    "the circles must not overlap with each other or extend outside the rectangle .",
    "the aspect ratio of the rectangle , i.e. , the ratio of its height to width , is variable and subject to the area - minimizing choice as well as the positions of the circles inside the rectangle .",
    "packing circles in a square has been the subject of many investigations @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite . because the aspect ratio is not fixed in our present problem , the solutions are typically different from the dense packings in a square .",
    "for example , the density @xmath5 of the proved optimum ( see @xcite ) for packing 25 congruent circles in a square ( see figure  [ fig:25]a ) can be increased to @xmath6 , if we let the rectangle assume its best aspect ratio ( see figure  [ fig:25]b ) .",
    "our experiments offer only three values of @xmath0 for which the dense packing in a square is also a solution to our present problem : @xmath7 , and of course , @xmath8 .    ) in a square , and , @xmath9 ) in a rectangle with variable aspect ratio .",
    ", width=624,height=374 ]        similarly , dense packings in long rectangles with a fixed aspect ratio usually do not yield solutions for our problem . according to a long - standing conjecture attributed to molnar ( see @xcite ) ,",
    "dense packings in long fixed rectangles tend to form periodic up and down alternating triangular `` teeth , '' as in the example shown in figure  [ fig:224 ] .",
    "we can usually increase the density of such packings by slightly changing the aspect ratio of the rectangle .",
    "the present problem has been occasionally mentioned among packing problems ; for example , web enthusiasts have recently began discussing it .",
    "however , the problem was considered as early as in 1970 in @xcite , where the optimum packings were determined for all @xmath10 and conjectured for @xmath11 .",
    "we learned about ruda s results after we performed our computations and made our conjectures .",
    "fortunately , our conjectures restricted to the values @xmath12 agree with the results and conjectures in @xcite !",
    "it appears that the complexity of the proofs of optimality in the packing - circles - in - a - square problem increases exponentially with @xmath0 ; computer generated / assisted proofs of optimality of such packings do not reach @xmath13 ( see @xcite ; proofs that do not utilize computers have not been found except for quite small values of @xmath0 ) , while conjectures extend to @xmath14 and even much larger values ( see @xcite ) .",
    "similarly , it seems to be difficult for the present problem to prove optimality for the configurations we find .",
    "this paper describes an experimental approach , where good packings are obtained with the help of a computer .",
    "some of these packings hopefully will be proved optimal in the future . at present , most of the statements about the packings made in this paper are only conjectures , except for a few which we explicitly claim as proven . for instance , we prove that the best packings found are better than any other in their class , e.g. , that the packing of 79 circles with a monovacancy ( see figure  [ fig:79]a ) , while non - optimal , is better than any hexagonal or square grid packing of 79 circles without a monovacancy . also , we prove that @xmath15 is the smallest @xmath0 for which a hexagonal packing as in figure  [ fig:11 ] is better than any square grid packing of @xmath0 circles .",
    "since it is well known that the hexagonal arrangement of congruent circles in the infinite plane has the highest possible density , ( see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite,@xcite ) , before plunging into our experiments , we expected to obtain good finite packings by `` carving '' rectangular subsets out of this infinite packing .",
    "it will be useful to classify here such finite arrangements . for that we will discuss packings in figures [ fig:25]b , [ fig:11 ] , [ fig:49]a , [ fig:49]b , and [ fig:79]a , irrespective of their optimality ( which will be discussed in the following sections ) .",
    "for the purpose of exposition , we will pretend in this section that there are no holes in the arrangements in figures  [ fig:49]b and [ fig:79]a , that is , the question mark in the figures is covered with an additional circle of the common radius .        )",
    "the best in the class of hexagonal packings , @xmath9 ) a best in the class of hexagonal packings with monovacancies ( one of 17 equally dense packings with the hole ) , @xmath16 ) the best we found . , width=681,height=432 ]    ) a best in the class of hexagonal packings with possible monovacancies , and , @xmath9 ) the best we found . ,",
    "width=624,height=374 ]        under such an assumption , the arrangement in figure  [ fig:79]a consists of @xmath17 alternating rows with @xmath18 circles in each , a total of @xmath19 circles .",
    "arrangements as in figures  [ fig:25]b ,  [ fig:11 ] , [ fig:49]a , and [ fig:49]b , are obtained by depleting such @xmath20 arrays of some circles along one side of the array .",
    "the ways of performing the depletion depend on the parity of @xmath21 .",
    "if @xmath21 is even , then the depletion can be done in only one way by removing @xmath22 circles .",
    "figure  [ fig:25]b presents an example with @xmath23 .",
    "the case of an odd @xmath21 presents two possibilities : we can remove @xmath24 circles on a side as in the example of figure  [ fig:49]b , or @xmath25 circles on a side as in the example of figure  [ fig:49]a .",
    "alternatively , one can consider rectangular square grid arrangements as candidates for the best packings , e.g. , see those in figure  [ fig:12 ] .",
    "the density of a square grid arrangement is fixed at @xmath26 independent of @xmath0 .",
    "when both sides @xmath21 and @xmath27 of the carved rectangle tend to infinity , the hexagonal packing density tends to @xmath28 which is the density of the hexagonal packing in the infinite plane .",
    "since @xmath29 , one naturally wonders for which @xmath0 the best hexagonal grid arrangement becomes better than the square grid arrangement .",
    "a natural question is whether or not both arrangements exhaust all possibilities for the best packing . in other words , does there exist an optimal packing of @xmath0 disks in a rectangle such that it _ can not _ be represented as being carved out by a rectangle from either square grid or hexagonal grid packing of the infinite plane ?",
    "to tackle the problem by computer , we developed a `` compactor '' simulation algorithm .",
    "the simulation begins by starting with a random initial configuration with @xmath0 circles lying inside a ( large ) rectangle without circle - circle overlaps .",
    "the starting configuration is feasible but is usually rather sparse .",
    "then the computer imitates a `` compactor '' with each side of the rectangle pressing against the circles , so that the circles are being forced towards each other until they `` jam . ''",
    "possible circle - circle or circle - boundary conflicts are resolved using a simulation of a hard collision so that no overlaps occur during the process .",
    "the simulation for a particular @xmath0 is repeated many times , with different starting circle configurations .",
    "if the final density in a run is larger than the record achieved thus far , it replaces this record .",
    "eventually in this process , the record stops improving up to the level of accuracy induced by the double precision accuracy of the computer .",
    "the resulting packing now becomes a candidate for the optimal packing for this value of @xmath0 .    in this way we found that the square grid pattern with density @xmath26 supplies the optimum for @xmath30 , and that @xmath31 is the smallest number of circles for which a density better than @xmath26 can be reached ; the density of this packing is @xmath32 the corresponding conjectured optimum pattern for @xmath15 is shown in figure  [ fig:11 ]",
    "the pattern is hexagonal . for @xmath33 and 13",
    "the square grid pattern briefly takes over as the experimental optimum again ( see figure  [ fig:12 ] for the case of @xmath34 ) .",
    "remarkably , ruda @xcite _ proves _ that for @xmath10 , the square - grid packings are optimal .",
    "his conjectures for @xmath11 also agree with our findings .",
    "our simulation results show that for @xmath35 , the best densities are larger than @xmath36 .",
    "this statement is also easy to prove , considering examples of ( not necessarily optimal ) two - row hexagonal packings like that in figure  [ fig:25]b for odd @xmath37 , or the ones with equal length rows for even @xmath38 .",
    "assuming the circles have radius 1 , the following inequalities @xmath39 for @xmath40 and @xmath41 for @xmath42 have to be satisfied .",
    "the left - hand sides in and are the areas of the enclosing rectangles for the two - row hexagonal packings , and the right - hand sides are the areas for the corresponding square grid packings .",
    "it is easily seen that all integers @xmath43 satisfy either inequality .",
    "these correspond to all integer values of @xmath35 .",
    "a surprise awaited us at the value @xmath44 .",
    "we found two different equally dense packings .",
    "one , shown in figure  [ fig:15]a , is of the expected hexagonal type .",
    "however , the other , shown in figure  [ fig:15]b , is not , nor can it be carved out of the square grid .",
    "it is easy to verify that two equally dense packings @xmath45 and @xmath9 of these types also exist for any @xmath0 of the form @xmath46 , @xmath47 . packing @xmath45 , such as that in figure  [ fig:15]a , has two alternating rows , with one row one circle shorter than the other , and with the longer row consisting of @xmath48 circles .",
    "packing @xmath9 , such as that in figure  [ fig:15]b , has 4 rows , the longest row having @xmath49 circles , three bottom rows alternate , the middle one having @xmath50 circles , and the 4th row of @xmath27 circles stacked straight on the top ( or on the bottom ; these would produce the same configuration ) .",
    "our experiments suggest that for @xmath51 and 4 , i.e. , for @xmath52 and 31 , these pairs of configurations might also be optimal ; however , they are provably not optimal for other values of @xmath53 .",
    "the packings of pattern @xmath9 for @xmath54 , 19 , and 31 , if they are proved to be optimal , answer positively the second question posed in section  [ sec : hexandsq ] .",
    "thus , the optimal container for 15 bottles apparently can have two different shapes , as can the optimal containers for 19 and 31 bottles ! in an obvious way , more than one optimum container shape also exists for square grid packings of @xmath0 circles if @xmath0 is not a prime",
    ". see figure  [ fig:12 ] for the example of @xmath34 ; there are three different rectangles which are equally good and probably optimal for @xmath34 .",
    "apparently , three is the maximum number of rectangular shapes , any number @xmath0 of circles can optimally fit in .",
    "it seems that for @xmath55 and 31 , there are exactly two shapes . for all other",
    "@xmath0 tested , only one best aspect ratio was found experimentally .",
    "another packing surprise awaited us at @xmath56 .",
    "figures  [ fig:49]a and [ fig:49]b show two among several equivalent packings achieved in our simulation experiments .",
    "the configuration @xmath45 is hexagonal , while configuration @xmath9 contains a monovacancy , that is , a hole than can accommodate exactly one circle .",
    "monovacancies in hexagonal arrays of congruent circles appear often in the simulation experiments for @xmath57 but only in packings of inferior quality , so that a better quality hexagonal packing without monovacancies could always be found .",
    "no higher density hexagonal packing without monovacancies was found for @xmath56 .",
    "such large @xmath0 already present substantial difficulties for our simulation procedure .",
    "the procedure failed to produce a packing which is better than those in figures  [ fig:49]a and [ fig:49]b .",
    "however , it is easy to prove that the density of a hexagonal packing in a rectangle with a monovacancy can be increased .",
    "for example , to improve the packing in figure  [ fig:49]b we relocate circle @xmath58 into the vacancy and then rearrange circles @xmath59 and @xmath60 along the side .",
    "this reduces the width of the rectangle by a small but positive @xmath61 as shown in figure  [ fig:49]c , where @xmath62 of the circle radius .",
    "the density of @xmath16 is @xmath63 .",
    "it is not known whether or not the resulting configuration @xmath16 can be further improved .",
    "however , using the exhaustive search we show ( see next section ) that the optimum packing for 49 circles in a rectangle , whatever it might be , can not be purely hexagonal .",
    "the value @xmath64 is apparently the smallest one for which neither square - grid nor perfect hexagonal pattern delivers the optimum .",
    "the simulation method becomes progressively slower for increasing @xmath0 .",
    "however , by exercising the simulation for smaller @xmath0 we are able to refine the idea of the class of packings which might deliver the optimum .",
    "we have chosen the class that consists of square grid and hexagonal packings and their hybrids ; we also allow for monovacancies in configurations of the class , although these configurations are never optimal .",
    "we have extended our computing experiments to larger values of @xmath0 using exhaustive search . for a given @xmath0 ,",
    "the method simply evaluates each candidate in the class by computing the area of the rectangle and selects the one with the smallest area .",
    "note that for each @xmath0 in this class , there are only a finite number of candidates .",

    "the longest row consists of @xmath27 circles . assuming all monovacancies are filled with circles , among the @xmath21 hexagonal rows , @xmath73 rows consist of @xmath74 circles each , the remaining @xmath75 rows consist of @xmath27 circles each , and among the @xmath72 square grid rows , @xmath76 rows consist of @xmath74 circles each , and the remaining @xmath77 rows consist of @xmath27 circles each .",

    "this method of relocation applies to all marked cases in the tables when @xmath21 is odd .",
    "for example , for the case of @xmath65 , when @xmath94 the relocation can be done as illustrated in figure  [ fig:5h3 ] .",
    "this applies to the cases @xmath95 , 107 , and 142 in table  [ tab:54t213 ] . in all these cases , before using this method , we should replace listed in the tables variant that has @xmath96 with the variant that has @xmath97 . this would produce a configuration with the pattern of the side as in figure  [ fig:5h3]a .",
    "we would then improve this configuration by relocating circles @xmath59 , @xmath58 , @xmath60 , @xmath92 , and @xmath93 to yield a configuration as in figure  [ fig:5h3]b .",
    "the value of the improvement here is @xmath98 of the circle radius .",
    "a similar method works for even @xmath21 .",
    "sometimes during these improvements , some circles become the so - called _ rattlers _ , i.e. , they become free to move and hit their neighbors , like the two unshaded circles in figure  [ fig:79 ] . for glass bottles tightly packed in an empty box , packings with rattlers",
    "should definitely be avoided even though the box area was minimal !",

    "all such cases in the table also happen to have @xmath100 .",

    "the best possible packing for 393 circles in a rectangle in the class of hexagonal packings with possible monovacancies must have two of them .    with two holes , we have more freedom to improve the quality of the packing than having just one hole .",

    "the changes to the aspect ratios are due to the @xmath61 shrinkages of the rectangles in those cases with monovacancies , such as those in figures  [ fig:49 ] , [ fig:79 ] , and [ fig:5h3 ] . presumably these are small in number and should not be noticeable in figure  [ fig : hovbst ] .",
    "the data points tend to form patterns of descending and ascending `` threads . '' to examine the threads in detail , a rectangular box which is close to the @xmath154-axis in figure  [ fig : hovbst ] is magnified and represented in figure  [ fig : boxa ] .",
    "all data points present in the box can be found in tables  [ tab:1t53 ] and [ tab:54t213 ] .",
    "the steep downward threads correspond to configurations with fixed height , and with widths increasing by 1 from one point to the next as we move down the thread .",
    "each such thread eventually terminates in either direction which means that the optimum rectangle can not be too flat or too tall .",
    "the less steep upward and downward threads ( they are dotted ) correspond to sequences ( @xmath155 ) , where from one point to the next @xmath27 increases by 3 or 6 and @xmath21 increases by 1 or 2 , respectively .         magnified .",
    "each data point in figure  [ fig : hovbst ] is replaced here with the corresponding number of circles.,width=700,height=595 ]    to compute the optimum aspect ratio of the rectangle that encloses the optimum packing for large @xmath0 , we analyze the area wasted along the rectangle sides .",
    "note that in the infinite hexagonal packing , the uncovered area is @xmath156 per each @xmath157 of the covered area .",
    "this is obvious from examining a single triangle @xmath158 in figure  [ fig : waste ] and observing that the entire infinite packing is composed of such triangles .",
    "the waste @xmath72 here is the area of the central triangle formed by three circular arcs and it is equal to the full area @xmath159 of triangle @xmath158 ( assuming circle radius is 1 ) minus @xmath157 , which is the total area of the three @xmath160 sectors covered .",
    "( by the way , we remind the reader that the density of the infinite hexagonal packing is @xmath161 . )",
    "the structure of the uncovered area in the infinite hexagonal packing can be also understood if we think of each covered circle bringing with it two curved uncovered triangles @xmath72 , those adjacent to this circle on its right - hand side . with such bookkeeping , each triangle @xmath72 will be counted exactly once .",
    "we conjecture that these two triangles @xmath72 per each circle is the unavoidable , i.e. , fixed , waste in any finite hexagonal packing carved out by a rectangle .",
    "there will be additional , i.e. , variable , waste along the rectangle sides and we are trying to minimize this variable waste .    along the bottom and top sides , for each 2 units of length , like the side @xmath162 of rectangle @xmath163 in figure  [ fig : waste ] , the additional waste is the area of rectangle @xmath163 minus two covered quarter - circle areas and minus @xmath72 .",
    "this @xmath72 represents one of the two curved triangles attached to the right - hand side of the circle with the center at @xmath58 and as an unavoidable waste should not be included .",
    "hence the waste per unit length of the top and bottom sides is @xmath164 .",
    "the waste along the left- or right - hand sides per two alternating rows , i.e. , per @xmath165 units of length , is the area of the semicircle that is cut in half by the side plus or minus additional area depending on the side . along the left - hand side ,",
    "all additional uncovered area is additional waste , since we assume that the curved triangles @xmath72 are attached to the right - hand side of the covered circles .",
    "the addition consists of two triangles @xmath72 and two halves of triangles @xmath166 as shown in figure  [ fig : waste ] .",
    "the left - hand side waste per @xmath165 of length is thus @xmath167 .",
    "along the right - hand side we subtract from the area of the semicircle the outstanding two half triangles @xmath166 because these are necessary in the infinite packing .",
    "the right - hand side waste per @xmath165 units of length is thus @xmath168 . averaging this for both sides and dividing by @xmath165",
    ", we have @xmath169 as the additional waste per unit length of left - hand or right - hand sides .",
    "now we should take @xmath170 as the ratio of height over width that yields the optimal balance between the waste along the sides of the enclosing rectangle and hence the minimum area .",
    "figure  [ fig : hovbst ] includes a horizontal line at the level of the aspect ratio @xmath171 .",
    "as pointed out in the beginning of the paper , we hope that these computational results will lead to proofs of optimality for larger ( or even infinite classes of ) @xmath0 .",
    "our experiments suggest that the frequency of occurrence of non - hexagonal best packings increases with @xmath0 .",
    "it is not clear whether or not the frequency has a limit as @xmath4 and if it has , whether of not this limit is smaller than 1 . while it is not easy to find small @xmath35",
    "for which the best packing is not perfectly hexagonal , it might be more difficult to find large @xmath0 for which the best packing _ is _ perfectly hexagonal .",
    "do there exist infinitely many @xmath0 , for which the densest packing of @xmath0 circles in a rectangle is hexagonal ?",
    "so that , @xmath178 , etc .",
    "the fractions @xmath179 are actually ( alternate ) convergents to @xmath180 , and it has been conjectured by nurmela et al .",
    "@xcite that for these @xmath0 , a `` nearly '' hexagonal packing of @xmath0 circles in a square they describe is in fact optimal .",
    "@xmath182 where @xmath183 thus , @xmath184",
    "so that @xmath185 , etc . no such @xmath186 for @xmath187 is indeed found to be irregular in our experiments .",
    "the best packing found experimentally for such an @xmath186 has @xmath188 alternating rows of full length @xmath189 with @xmath100 , @xmath190 , in the notation of section  [ sec : exhaust ] and tables  [ tab:1t53 ] and  [ tab:54t213 ] .                k.  j. nurmela and p.  r.  j. stergrd , optimal packings of equal circles in na square , in : _ combinatorics , graph theory , and algorithms _ , vol .",
