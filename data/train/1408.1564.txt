    "vigorous nuclear burning in the core of evolved stars can leave almost no signs on their surface .",

    "it is thought that the convection reaches up to the hydrogen shell that provides an entropy barrier against mixing ; the mixing can trigger hydrogen burning ( @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "however , off - center ignition of helium because of neutrino cooling prior to ignition ( e.g. , @xcite ) , or a weaker barrier in low metallicity stars ( @xcite ; @xcite for @xmath1 < -2.5 $ ] ) , lead to some mixing . as",
    "a result of this mixing ignition of a large amount of hydrogen occurs in these rgb stars ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . @xcite deposited the energy at the bottom of the envelope , and showed that suffice that few percents of the energy released by the hydrogen burning leak to the envelope to cause a substantial envelope expansion .",

    "considered the propagation of p - waves through the convective envelope of an agb star and noticed that their amplitude grow by a large factor when reaching the outer regions of the envelope .",
    "@xcite further argued that the high amplitude of the p - waves can substantially increase the mass loss rate . in that study the p - waves where excited by a massive planet or a brown dwarf orbiting deep in the agb envelope .",
    "the wave luminosity was low , and convective viscosity did not influence much the wave propagation @xcite .    in the study of @xcite",
    "the p - wave luminosity can be super - eddington , and they argue for p - waves dissipation mainly in the outer layers of the envelope .",

    "in the previous two subsections we argued that the pressure formed by the gas oscillatory motion set by the sound waves is sufficient to cause substantial envelope expansion , before even wave dissipation is considered . here",

    "they dismiss the possibility of envelope expansion as suggested by @xcite because the total wave energy deposited at @xmath38 generally exceeds the binding energy of the star at @xmath89 .",

    "the wave will not eject mass , but rather inflate the outer envelope .",
    "since the dynamical time of the star is longer than the time to explosion , the star will not have time to response , and no pre - explosion outburst ( peo ) will take place in this case .    when @xmath98 then @xmath100 .",

    "after a time @xmath90 the waves reach the stellar surface and deposited energy of @xmath101 in the layer residing above @xmath38 .",
    "this energy , by definition , is sufficient to cause a major expansion of this layer . and",
    "since @xmath90 is about the dynamical time , the layer has the time to response and expand .",
    "therefore , both the density and the temperature , hence the sound speed , drop at the initial radius @xmath38 . by the definition of @xmath38 ( below eq .",
    "[ eq : lmaxconv1 ] ) , the new radius @xmath38 must move inward in mass coordinate to maintain the equality @xmath102 .",
    "our conclusion is that once the gas reaches the outward speed @xmath103 , it will absorb no more energy as wave energy is deposited in further inner envelope layers .",

    ".    we can summarize this section by strengthening the argument of @xcite that high power waves excited near the core will cause major stellar expansion rather than a major mass ejection .",
    "both the pressure caused by the gas oscillatory motion below @xmath38 and wave dissipation in the outer envelope contribute to this expansion .",
    "of course , when the wave power is set to values much larger than those given in table 2 of @xcite , some mass will eventually be ejected .",

    "a large part of the injected energy is absorbed by stellar mass at radii of @xmath163 ( right panel of fig .",
    "[ figure : density40 ] ) , where the dynamical time is @xmath164 .",
    "the outer regions are more likely to expand slowly , with velocity less than the escape velocity , than maintain hydrostatic equilibrium .",
    "we can safely conclude that the results show that the expanding envelope can absorb a large fraction of the injected energy .",
    "namely , the outcome of wave energy deposition is not a fast and light mass ejection , but rather a slowly expanding massive envelope .",
    "this holds both for our rsg model studied in section [ subsec : rsg ] and for the bsg studied here .",
    "let us quantify the above statement .",
    "the initial energy injection radius is @xmath165 , and the mass above this radius is @xmath126= 0.13 m_\\odot$ ] .",
    "the inner boundary of the energy injection zone at the end , @xmath166 , is @xmath167 , and the mass above this radius is @xmath168= 0.84 m_\\odot$ ] .",
    "if the entire injected energy of @xmath169 is chandelled to kinetic energy of this mass , its velocity would be @xmath170 .",
    "this is the escape velocity from a radius of @xmath171 .",
    "since the energy is deposited while the mass is at smaller radii , the mass will not escape .",
    "the mass might form an extended ` effervescent zone ' .",
    "an explosion will occur before the outer region manages to fall back .",
    "as most of the energy is channelled to envelope expansion , no bright outburst with massive mass ejection will take place from this process .",
    "our results give a bright star , but we expect that in a dynamical calculation there will be no time to transfer energy , and the luminosity will be much lower . the extra energy that is not radiated will be in the kinetic energy of the slowly expanding envelope .",
    "a way to form an outburst is if a massive main sequence companion enter ( collide with ) the extended envelope .",
    "a strong shock is formed , and in addition the companion can accrete mass and liberate more gravitational energy .",
    "the companion needs to be on an orbital separation of @xmath172 , preferentially on an eccentric orbit .",
    "finally , we note that the progenitor of sn  1987a was a bsg , although with a lower initial mass of @xmath173 , but no pre - explosion outburst was observed from it .",
    "so definitely not all ccsne have such a phase of large expansion .",
    "the heterogenous group of erupting objects having luminosity between novae and supernovae ( sne ) is composed mainly of intermediate luminosity optical transients ( ilots ; also termed intermediate luminosity red transients or red luminous novae ) and major outbursts of luminous blue variables ( lbv ) .",
    "now there are evidences for pre - explosion outbursts ( peos ) that reside in this regime as well .",
    "there are two classes of models to account for ilots , lbv major outbursts , and peos .",
    "one school attributes the eruptions and their energy source to single star evolution , e.g. , the porous - atmosphere model that was suggested by @xcite for the super - eddington nineteenth century great eruption of @xmath174 car , the single star model of sn  2008s and ngc  300  ot @xcite , and the model of @xcite to the peo of sn  2010mc .",
    "@xcite already argued that single star models , such as the rotation - based singe star scenario of @xcite , fail in explaining the bipolar nebula of @xmath174 car .",
    "@xcite argue that single - star models for ilots of evolved giant stars , such as ngc  300  ot and sn  2008s , encounter severe difficulties .",
    "the other school argues that the source of energy is gravitational energy released by either mass transfer in a binary system or by stellar merger .",
    "although the event might be triggered by an instability in one star , binary interaction is at the heart of these eruptions .",
    "examples include mass transfer processes as in the binary model for the great eruption of @xmath174 car @xcite , ngc  300  ot @xcite , and in the early outbursts of sn  2009ip @xcite .",
    "a binary merger process occurred for example in v1309 scorpii @xcite .",
    "a strong binary interaction , including violent mass transfer to a binary companion , can take place when the giant star suffers rapid expansion and inflates a massive extended envelope .",
    "the envelope of lbv stars has radiative and convective layers , such that magnetic energy can be stored in the radiative zone @xcite .",
    "the release of the magnetic energy can lead to envelope distortion that leads to huge envelope expansion and mass loss @xcite that facilitate binary interaction , such as in @xmath174 car .    in the present paper we looked at a different triggering of envelope expansion .",
    "we studied the process suggested by @xcite and @xcite , where waves excited by the vigorous burning in the core of pre - exploding supernovae years to hours before explosion , dissipates in the outer envelope .",
    "@xcite also preferred a single star model for the peo of sn  2010mc and adopted the porous - atmosphere model @xcite .",
    "we instead argued in this paper that the powerful waves lead to envelope expansion rather than mass ejection . to account for the peo , a binary companion that interacts with the extended envelope powers the peo @xcite .",
    "the high binary fraction among massive stars , e.g. @xcite , makes binary interaction of a hugely expanding giant star very likely .    in section [ sec : pwavep ]",
    "we estimated the energy and pressure content of the waves , and presented arguments that show that most of the energy carried by the waves will lead to envelope expansion rather than mass ejection at the escape speed .",
    "we showed that in red supergiants ( rsg ) the waves start to increase the pressure , and hence cause envelope expansion deeper in the envelope than where convection driven by waves become supersonic ( @xmath84 ) .",
    "the envelope will expand , rather than ejects its outer part . in section [ subsec : meject ]",
    "we strengthen this conclusion by simple arguments regarding the dissipation of the wave energy .",
    "in section [ sec : numerical ] we used the mesa code to study energy injection over about a year for a model of a rsg , and over about a month into a blue supergiant ( bsg ) stellar model .",
    "we used several simplifying assumptions as to the place of energy injections .",
    "we found that for the wave powers as listed by @xcite the stars can absorb the energy and arrange themselves in a structure with a very extended massive envelope .",
    "this extended envelope is likely to have a slow expansion , and the sn explosion might occur before the outer extended envelope sets into a full hydrostatic equilibrium .",
    "it is with such a very extended envelope that a binary companion can interact . due to the large mass at large radii ,",
    "if the companion orbits through the envelope it can accrete a large fraction of the mass in the extended envelope .",
    "@xcite modelled the light curve of 11 type iin supernova and derived the circumstellar medium properties . in some cases the high mass loss rate from the progenitor started at least 60 years prior to explosion .",
    "if caused by nuclear burning , it requires the stage of carbon burning .",
    "the carbon burning has insufficient energy to cause mass loss rate by wave dissipation , but it can inflate the envelope",
    ". binary interaction , e.g. , by tidal interaction , can take place and enhance mass loss rate .",
    "a low mass companion might spiral - in due to tidal interaction .",
    "it spins - up the envelope and increases the mass loss rate . as mass loss proceeds the envelope slows down and mass loss decreases .",
    "such a scenario might account for the decreases in mass loss rate found for one of the systems studied by @xcite .",
    "we predict that the common morphology of the circumstellar matter of sn iin is bipolar .",
    "we thank the referee , takashi moriya , for helpful comments .",
