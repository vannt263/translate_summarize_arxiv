    "low - dimensional and geometrically frustrated spin systems exhibit some of the most interesting physical phenomena seen in condensed matter physics . due to the low site connectivity and competing interactions classical order",
    "is often suppressed by quantum and thermal fluctuations giving rise to novel ground states and quasiparticle excitations . beside the spin liquid states",
    "@xcite where no long range order exists , certain geometries , such as the ising model on the stacked triangular lattice antiferromagnet ( tla ) , possess partially disordered ground states @xcite .",
    "theory predicts two phases beside the paramagnetic phase .",
    "the first phase consists of two antiferromagnetically ordered sublattices and a disordered third one , while the low temperature phase has one fully ordered site and two partially ordered site with opposite moment direction and zero net moment .",
    "the most prominent experimental realizations of the ising model on the tla are cscobr@xmath0 @xcite and ca@xmath0co@xmath6o@xmath1 @xcite .",
    "both compounds have strongly coupled ising chains perpendicular to the triangular plane .",
    "while cscobr@xmath0 has antiferromagnetic chains , ca@xmath0co@xmath6o@xmath1 has ferromagnetic chains producing magnetization plateaus @xcite .",
    "we propose a novel frustrated system with ising spins on the stacked tla with strongly coupled ferrimagnetic chains of alternating ni@xmath2  and ir@xmath7ions : sr@xmath0niiro@xmath1@xcite .",
    "sr@xmath0niiro@xmath1  together with ca@xmath0co@xmath6o@xmath1 belong to a larger family of spin - chain systems with general formula a@xmath0mmo@xmath1 ( @xmath8 alkaline - earth metal , @xmath9 transition metals ) that have attracted much attention in recent years , due to their reduced dimensionality .",
    "sr@xmath0znrho@xmath1 @xcite , sr@xmath0cuiro@xmath1 @xcite , ca@xmath0corho@xmath1 @xcite , sr@xmath0curho@xmath1 @xcite , ca@xmath0corho@xmath1 @xcite are the most studied ones showing magnetization jumps , large thermoelectric power and magnetoresistance @xcite .",
    "the crystal structure consists of 1d chains that are oriented along the @xmath3-axis and arranged in a triangular lattice in the @xmath4 plane , see fig .  [",
    "fig : struct ] .",
    "the chains are formed by alternating face - sharing mo@xmath1 trigonal prism and mo@xmath1 octahedra and intercalated by a@xmath2 cation , thus forming a triangular arrangement .    beside the strongly one dimensional crystal structure these compounds possess strong spin anisotropy .",
    "it originates from either the single ion property of the mo@xmath1 site as for ca@xmath0co@xmath6o@xmath1 where the weak spin orbit coupling ( soc ) can induce a large orbital moment on the high spin carrier co@xmath10 due to the distorted symmetry of the trigonal prism @xcite . beside for heavier transition metals such as rhodium or iridium , the strong soc can induce anisotropic exchange interaction as for sr@xmath0cuiro@xmath1 @xcite . in sr@xmath0niiro@xmath1",
    "both of these mechanisms are potentially active , where the ni@xmath2  occupy the trigonal prism site with @xmath11 electronic configuration ( @xmath12 ) and the ir@xmath7  taking the octahedral site with a novel @xmath13 electronic state .",
    "recent ab initio results have shown that the coupling along the chain is afm @xcite but only if the soc is taken into account which results in a ferrimagnetic order due to the different moment sizes of the two magnetic ions .",
    "the observed low temperature magnetic structure of sr@xmath0niiro@xmath1  is also intriguing .",
    "lefranois et al .  found a @xmath14 magnetic order with strongly reduced magnetic moments using neutron diffraction @xcite .",
    "the refinement revealed that all magnetic moments are parallel to the @xmath3-axis and within each ni - ir chain the moments are ferrimagnetically ordered .",
    "however from diffraction alone the global phase of the structure can not be determined .",
    "this gives two qualitatively different solutions ( with a continuum of possibilities between ) .",
    "in the first solution one chain in the unit cell is fully ordered , while the other two has ordered moments reduced by half and the ferrimagnetic moment pointing in the opposite direction .",
    "the second solution has two fully ordered chains with opposite ferrimagnetic moment and a completely disordered third chain .",
    "both of these structures are predicted theoretically for the ising model on the stacked tla .",
    "previous rixs study on sr@xmath0niiro@xmath1  found a band of magnetic excitations centered at 95 mev@xcite at 10 k. the observed inelastic intensity and the size of the gap was gradually decreasing with increasing temperature . at room temperature",
    "the excitations were centered at 50(5 ) mev .",
    "since the excitations were measured using the resonant @xmath15-edge of iridium , the experiment shows selectively the magnetic signal only on the iridium atoms .",
    "the authors did not discuss , whether the width of the observed excitations is resolution limited .    a good understanding of the magnetic properties of sr@xmath0niiro@xmath1  requires both high energy - resolution probing technique and spin wave calculations , in which the soc is presented in the form of anisotropic exchange interaction and spin anisotropies . in the present work ,",
    "we show a combination of inelastic neutron scattering ( ins ) measurements and spin wave calculation for sr@xmath0niiro@xmath1  revealing a very anisotropic exchange hamiltonian and an effective ising model on the stacked triangular lattice .",
    "polycrystalline sample of sr@xmath0niiro@xmath1  was prepared by solid - state reactions of nio , iro@xmath6 and srco@xmath0 .",
    "the sr@xmath0niiro@xmath1  sample used in the present study is the same sample used in our previous neutron diffraction study @xcite .",
    "the x - ray powder diffraction study at 300 k and neutron diffraction study at 100 k show that the sr@xmath0niiro@xmath1  sample was single phase and crystallized in the space group r@xmath16c .",
    "the ins measurements were performed on 6 g of sample using the high count rate time - of - flight chopper spectrometer , merlin at the isis facility , uk . to reduce the neutron absorption problem from iridium",
    ", we filled the fine powder of sr@xmath0niiro@xmath1  in an aluminum foil envelope rolled into a cylindrical shape with a diameter of 40 mm ( and a height of 45 mm ) and then inserted into a cylindrical aluminum can and finally mounted into a closed - cycle refrigerator under he - exchange gas .",
    "the average sample thickness was less than 1 mm .",
    "we corrected the data for neutron absorption , which was calculated to be 15% of the incident beam .",
    "the ins measurements were carried out with various incident neutrons energies : @xmath17 , 80 , 150 and 500 mev and temperatures between 5 k and 300 k. we also measured a standard vanadium sample at the same set of incident energies to determine the energy resolution at the elastic line and to convert the intensities into normalized units of cross section , mbr / sr / mev / f.u . , where f.u .",
    "stands for formula unit of sr@xmath0niiro@xmath1 .",
    "the inelastic neutron scattering data reveals two types of excitations . at momentum transfers above 4 @xmath18  strong inelastic scattering",
    "was observed with intensity increasing proportionally to the momentum transfer square ( @xmath19 ) and with increasing temperature .",
    "these properties clearly indicate scattering due to phonons .",
    "we also observed inelastic scattering below 4 @xmath18  between 29.5 and 39 mev that decreases in intensity with increasing momentum transfer and temperature , see fig .",
    "[ fig : peak ] .",
    "we assign these excitations to magnetic scattering . to separate the magnetic and phonon scattering we collected data at room temperature that contains only phonon scattering and used this data to subtract the phonons from the magnetic signal ( for details see appendix [ sec : fit ] ) .",
    "the magnetic signal is well defined in the magnetically ordered phase below @xmath20 k and survives up to 200 k with gradually decreasing intensity , see fig .",
    "[ fig : peak](b ) . at low temperatures",
    "the signal is due to spin wave scattering , while in the paramagnetic phase is due to low dimensional scattering of the strongly correlated chains .",
    "the momentum transfer dependence of the magnetic signal follows the @xmath21 ( spin only ) form factor of the ni@xmath2  ions , see fig .",
    "[ fig : f2 ] .",
    "the energy width of the excitations far exceeds the instrumental resolution which is a sign of dispersive modes .",
    "moreover the peak is asymmetric with a well developed shoulder at the high energy side .",
    "we also measured inelastic neutron scattering using 150 mev and 500 mev incident energy to confirm the previous rixs results , however we only found a very weak scattering centered at 87 mev . due to the low signal to noise",
    "ratio we could not unambiguously assign this scattering to the magnetism of the iridium ions .",
    "there are two reasons why the iridium signal is so weak compared to the nickel signal for ins . due to the smaller spin-1/2",
    "effective quantum number of ir@xmath7  it gives half the intensity compared to the spin-1 ni@xmath2  ions .",
    "beside at increasing energies , the lowest momentum transfer that is measurable by a direct time of flight instrument is also increasing which gives strongly reduced intensity due to the magnetic form factor . in the following",
    "we assume the upper iridium mode is centered at 95 mev with unknown bandwidth .",
    "the observed magnetic excitations of sr@xmath0niiro@xmath1  in the ordered phase can be modeled using linear spin wave theory .",
    "we will do this in two steps .",
    "first we propose a one dimensional ni - ir alternating chain model , where we neglect the interchain couplings . afterwards to improve the model we will introduce additional magnetic exchange interactions between the chains and we will show that the interchain interactions are necessary to adequately fit the data .    to be able to model the magnetic excitations using linear spin wave theory , we need a classical magnetic ground state",
    ". however experimentally determined magnetic structures are incompatible with a zero temperature classical ground state . in the following we propose model hamiltonians with ground state close to the observed one and we will show that the calculated excitation spectrum is insensitive to the details of the magnetic ground state .",
    "the simplest model hamiltonian to describe the observed spin waves is the ni - ir alternating chain along the @xmath3-axis . due to the 3-fold symmetry along the @xmath3-axis ,",
    "the most general spin hamiltonian ( up to two spin exchanges ) allowed by the symmetry is the following :    @xmath22    where @xmath23 denotes the @xmath13 quantum number of iridium ions if @xmath24 and the @xmath12 spin of nickel ions if @xmath25 .",
    "also we assumed that only the nickel ions have single ion anisotropy ( @xmath26 ) .",
    "the dzyaloshinskii - moriya ( dm ) interaction is also allowed with the dm vector parallel to the @xmath3-axis @xmath27 and the sign of @xmath28 is positive for @xmath29 and negative otherwise .",
    "the classical zero temperature ground state of the above hamiltonian for dominating antiferromagnetic @xmath30 exchange is the ferrimagnetic chain in agreement with neutron diffraction experiments .",
    "if the exchange interactions are heisenberg type ( @xmath31 ) as one would expect for transition metals the excitation spectrum would have a zero gap ( up to small value due to negative @xmath26 ) .",
    "however we observed a spin wave gap much larger than the bandwidth of the excitations which implies that @xmath32 .",
    "this anisotropic exchange is also compatible with the strong spin orbit coupling expected for iridium .",
    "the energy width of the measured magnon band is due to a dispersive mode , which is related to the size of @xmath33 and the double peak structure is due to the van hove singularities at the bottom and top of the magnon band smeared by the finite instrumental resolution .",
    "the separation of the nickel and iridium spin wave modes is the consequence of the different weiss field of the magnetic ions that happens even for completely isotropic interactions .",
    "since the weiss field is linear with the spin quantum number of the neighbors , it is larger on the iridium ions than on the nickel ions .",
    "thus the spin wave modes that mainly localized on the ir acquire a larger gap than on the ni . due to the large energy separation",
    "the mixing of the spin wave modes is negligible .",
    "this also means that we can not fit any coupling between iridium spins ( @xmath34 and @xmath35 ) since it only influence the upper iridium spin wave band of which we know only the position but not the shape as a function of energy .    in order to fit the observed powder data",
    ", we extracted a single cut through the inelastic signal integrated from 2 @xmath18 to 3 @xmath18 and binned in energy with 0.5 mev steps .",
    "this data was compared with the calculated spin - spin correlation function of the above hamiltonian using linear spin wave theory with spinw @xcite .",
    "the powder averaged neutron scattering cross section is calculated using the equation : @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the spin - spin correlation function including the magnetic form factors of the different ions and the integration runs in reciprocal space covering the sphere with radius @xmath38 . in the simulation we numerically integrated over 987 @xmath39-points covering the @xmath40 @xmath18  radius sphere with near uniform spacing (",
    "the points were generated according to @xcite ) .",
    "we chose to use a fixed set of @xmath38 points , since a random distribution of @xmath38 points would make the fit unstable .",
    "the calculated powder averaged spectrum was convoluted with the instrumental energy resolution function ( see appendix [ sec : res ] ) .",
    "this calculated data was then fitted to the measured data using weighted least squares refinement . to determine the optimal parameters of eq .",
    "[ eq : eq1 ] , we applied a stochastic optimization method ( described in appendix [ sec : fit ] ) .",
    ".comparison of the best fitting parameters of different spin wave models of sr@xmath0niiro@xmath1 . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "in order to fit the parameters of a model spin hamiltonian to inelastic neutron scattering data collected on polycrystalline sample we used the following method . in the first step we removed the phonon scattering from the raw data .",
    "this can be done using a few different methods . to remove coherent phonons",
    ", we collected the spectrum at high temperature where the magnetic signal is weak and used it as a background for the low temperature data . before the subtraction we applied an energy dependent scaling to correct for the temperature dependent cross section due to the bose statistics of phonons and magnons : @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the temperature of the phonon data ( 300 k in our case ) , while @xmath43 is the temperature of the magnetic data ( 5 k ) .",
    "after this correction , a weak q dependent background remained that increased linearly with @xmath44 and it seemed to originate from incoherent phonon scattering .",
    "this survived the previous subtraction probably due to the change in the debye - waller factor at high temperature that we did not accounted for . to subtract the incoherent phonons , we averaged the scattering intensity above @xmath45 @xmath18 : @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the measured inelastic scattering intensity on a @xmath48 pixel centered at @xmath49 and @xmath50 is the number of pixels above @xmath51 with a fixed @xmath52 value .",
    "afterwards we subtracted the @xmath53 value from each @xmath48 pixel .",
    "after these corrections the inelastic signal was clean from phonon scattering up to 4 @xmath18 see fig .",
    "[ fig : fit ] .    fitting the complete measured dataset",
    "is challenging , due to the computationally intensive powder averaging . to speed up the fitting process , we fitted only a single cut integrated between 2 - 3 @xmath18 .",
    "the spin wave spectrum was simulated at 5 different @xmath38 points evenly distributed in the same range .",
    "due to the weakly dispersive nature of the spectrum as a function of @xmath38 , the result of the fit is insensitive to the number of @xmath38 points averaged .",
    "the most common method to calculate the powder average is to use a monte carlo technique to average the spectrum over a @xmath54const .",
    "sphere in reciprocal space .",
    "however this method is not ideal for a fitting purpose since the simulated data would contain a noise .",
    "we used a deterministic method to generate evenly distributed points on a unit sphere according to ref .",
    "the number of points to average over has to be a fibonacci number , we chose 987 which gave a reliable average ( it gave less than a 1% error in estimating @xmath55 compared to simulations including more points on the unit sphere ) .",
    "we used the least squares method to define the goodness of the fit : @xmath56 where @xmath57 are the measured intensities along the cut and @xmath58 are the simulated intensities .",
    "since we do not have reliable data on the upper iridium band , we used the available rixs data @xcite to fix the position of the upper iridium band to 95 mev . to constrain the energy of the upper band we summed up all simulated intensity above 65 mev and calculated the center of mass .",
    "we added the squared deviation of the upper band to the calculated @xmath59 with a large weight which effectively gave a constraint .    to minimize the @xmath59 value we used a particle swarm optimization method @xcite .",
    "unfortunately due to the noisy nature of both the data and the simulation ( due to powder averaging ) there is no reliable method to extract the standard deviations of the fitted parameters . to compare different simulations with different number of fit parameters we calculated the reduced @xmath59 : @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the number of data points along the cut , @xmath62 is the number of fitting parameters . for a dataset with reliable",
    "error bars a good model fit should give @xmath63 .",
