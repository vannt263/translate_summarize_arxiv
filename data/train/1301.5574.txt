    "the modeling of pedestrian crowd dynamics can be developed at different representation scales , namely micro- and macro - scales with the intermediate approach of the kinetic theory , where the dependent variable is a probability distribution over the micro - state of pedestrians .",
    "the interested reader is addressed to the review paper @xcite , where the existing literature is reviewed and critically analyzed focusing at different modeling scales .",
    "namely , at the micro - scale by ordinary differential equations , see among others @xcite ; at the macro - scale obtained by the classical approach by conservation equations , among others @xcite ; or by stochastic models related to evolving probability measure @xcite .",
    "the interplay between individual - based and macroscopic models is studied in @xcite .",
    "additional bibliography and conceptual links with the modeling of vehicular traffic are proposed in @xcite .",
    "a detailed analysis of empirical data is delivered by various papers @xcite among others .",
    "this present paper specifically refers to @xcite , where the main hint , further stressed in @xcite , is that the modeling approach should retain , as far as it is possible , the complexity features of crowds to be viewed as a living , hence complex , system .",
    "this paper presents an introduction to modeling where pedestrians move with only velocity modulus and change their velocity directions both due to interactions with other pedestrians and to the search of their specific target , for instance the exit zone .",
    "this present paper shows how the dynamics at the micro - scale of pedestrians is transferred to the dynamics of collective behaviors .",
    "modeling and simulations include interactions between pedestrian that move toward different targets , while their dynamics can be induced , by signals from the outer environment to an exit direction . a qualitative analysis of the initial value problem , and some sample simulations are presented .",
    "the approach developed in this paper is based on the methods of the kinetic theory of active particles , which shows the ability to retain various complexity features .",
    "this approach has been applied to the modeling of several living systems as documented , among others , in the modeling of vehicular traffic @xcite , swarms @xcite , social competition @xcite , and migration phenomena @xcite .",
    "the contents are proposed through four additional sections . in details ,",
    "section 2 presents the mathematical model obtained as a development of that given in @xcite to include the dynamics on the velocity modulus and interactions of pedestrians that move toward different directions @xcite .",
    "section 3 introduces the problem of existence of solutions to the initial value problem in unbounded domains and announces the existence theorems for arbitrary large times .",
    "the technical proofs are developed in sections 4 and 5 .",
    "simulations obtained by application of the splitting method , are presented in section 6 with a detailed computational analysis of the dynamics of the moving boundary of the domain occupied by the crowd .",
    "finally , the last section first critically analyzes the use of the kinetic theory approach and subsequently looks ahead to research perspectives focusing on the modeling panic conditions .    .5truecm",
    "let us consider a large system of pedestrians moving in a bounded domain @xmath0 , which may include , as shown in figure [ fig : geometry_domain ] , internal obstacles .",
    "the boundary of @xmath1 is denoted by @xmath2 .",
    "the modeling approach also refers to unbounded domains in two space dimensions .",
    "pedestrians can be subdivided into two different groups , moving toward two different targets , denoted by @xmath3 and @xmath4 , respectively .    :",
    "pedestrians enter from @xmath5 and can move towards two different targets : pedestrians at @xmath6 and at @xmath7 move to @xmath4 and @xmath3 , respectively . , scaledwidth=55.0% ]    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     .5truecm",
    "various approaches to modeling crowd dynamics corresponding to different representation scales and related mathematical tools have been reviewed and critically analyzed in the survey paper @xcite .",
    "the mesoscopic approach in this present paper has been selected , out of this overall analysis , as the most appropriate , according to the authors bias , to capture the complexity features of the system under consideration . moreover ,",
    "the use of discrete velocity variables has been adopted to model the micro - scale state of pedestrians in order to capture the granular features of their dynamics @xcite .",
    "the use of discrete velocity variables was introduced , as already mentioned , to model vehicular traffic@xcite , while the approach was further developed toward crowd modeling in @xcite .",
    "the discretization is here applied to the velocity variable . in principles , it can be referred also to the space variable as already known for models of vehicle dynamics @xcite . however , the technical difficulty of dealing with more than one space variables creates nontrivial technical problems , which do not seem yet solved at present .",
    "the modeling approach proposed in this paper refers to normal flow conditions , namely when pedestrians are sufficiently relaxed to behave normally . on the other hand ,",
    "the behavioral influence of panic conditions can play an important role in the modification of the usual dynamics @xcite .",
    "this objective can be pursued by an appropriate tuning of the model proposed in this paper also by taking advantage of recent studies on the behavioral dynamics of pedestrians @xcite , and evolutive game theory @xcite .",
    "accordingly , the guidelines toward this important objective are given :    * pedestrians undergo a trend to higher values of the activity variable .",
    "moreover , the dynamics over the said variable has to be necessarily inserted in the model ; * the effective visibility zone becomes larger and signals from large distance become important , while in the case of normal conditions short distance signals appear to be more important ; * pedestrians appear to be sensitive to crowd concentration , while in normal conditions they attempt to avoid it",
    ". therefore different weights @xmath8 need to be used ; * the role of boundary conditions needs to be properly modeled arguably by means of nonlocal conditions                                                d.  helbing and m.  moussaid , analytical calculation of critical perturbation amplitudes and critical densities by non - linear stability analysis for a simple traffic flow model , _ eur .",
