    "the corresponding expectation value of the hamiltonian approaches a lower bound for the case of a particular @xmath3-dimensional hubbard model in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "we conclude that the presented variational state approaches the ground state or an eigenstate which is degenerate to the ground state if the ground state is not unique .    for a second model , a special hubbard chain ,",
    "the analytical expectation value deviates significantly from the numerically calculated ground state energy . although it is shown that the numerical ground state and the variational state exhibit the same symmetries , it remains unclear , how well the ground - state physics of the chain is described by our variational ansatz .",
    "this appendix provides a proof that the state @xmath47 [ eq .  ( [ eq:7 ] ) ] of the @xmath1- particle @xmath3- dimensional system vanishes , if the system extends an even number of unit cells in each direction .",

    "the eigenvalues are given by the familiar cosine bands @xmath109 .",
    "if all system length contain an even number of unit cells , one of the eigenvalues vanishes , because one of all possible @xmath63- vectors equals @xmath110 . therefore , the state @xmath111 and the projected state @xmath112 vanishes as well .",
