    "giant ly@xmath0nebulae , or `` blobs , '' are extended sources at @xmath1 @xmath2 26 with typical ly@xmath0sizes of @xmath65  ( @xmath650kpc ) and line luminosities of @xmath7ergs@xmath4 .",
    "the low number counts , strong clustering , multiple embedded sources , and location in over - dense environments of the largest ly@xmath0blobs indicate that they lie in massive ( @xmath8 @xmath2 @xmath9@xmath10 ) dark matter halos , which will evolve into those typical of rich galaxy groups or clusters today @xcite .",
    "therefore , ly@xmath0blobs are unique tracers of the formation of the most massive galaxies and their early interaction with the surrounding intergalactic medium ( igm ) .",
    "this interaction is probably tied on some scale to the source of the blobs extended ly@xmath0emission , but that mechanism is poorly understood .",
    "emission from ly@xmath0blobs could arise from several phenomena , which may even operate together , including shock - heating by galactic superwinds or gas photoionized by active galactic nuclei .",
    "another possibility is smooth gas accretion , which is likely to play an important role in the formation of galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and which should channel some of its gravitational cooling radiation into atomic emission lines such as ly@xmath0 .",
    "another scenario is the resonant scattering of ly@xmath0photons produced by star formation or active galactic nuclei ( agn ) @xcite in the embedded galaxies .    to resolve the debate about the nature of ly@xmath0blobs requires  at the very least",
    " that we discriminate between between outflowing and inflowing models .",
    "because ly@xmath0is a resonant line and typically optically thick in the surrounding intergalactic medium , studies even of the same ly@xmath0blob s kinematics can disagree .",
    "on one hand , @xcite argue that their integral field unit ( ifu ) spectra of a ly@xmath0blob are consistent with a simple model where the ly@xmath0emission is absorbed by a foreground slab of neutral gas swept out by a galactic scale outflow . on the other ,",
    "@xcite explain the same data as arising from the infall of the surrounding intergalactic medium .",
    "worse , @xcite claim that the same symmetric ly@xmath0profiles are most consistent with static surrounding gas .    to distinguish among such possibilities",
    "requires a comparison of the center of the ly@xmath0line profile with that of a non - resonant line like h@xmath0 @xmath116563or [ ] @xmath115007 .",
    "these rest - frame optical nebular lines are better measure of the ly@xmath0blob s systemic velocity , i.e. , of the precise redshift , because it is not seriously altered by radiative transfer effects and is more concentrated about the galaxies in the ly@xmath0blob s core .",
    "we illustrate this line offset technique in figure [ fig : cartoon ] . while gas accretion models predict different line profile shapes depending on various assumptions , e.g. , the location of ionizing sources , the detailed geometry , and the velocity field , they all predict that the overall ly@xmath0line profile , originating from the central source or the surrounding gas , will be blue - shifted with respect to the center of a non - resonant line such as h@xmath0 that is optically thin to the surrounding gas @xcite .",
    "this is because the red - side of the ly@xmath0profile will see higher optical depth due to the infalling ( approaching ) gas . in other words ,",
    "the h@xmath0 kinematics represent the true underlying velocity field if the ly@xmath0blob is accreting gas from the intergalactic medium .",
    "the same is true if the gas is outflowing , except that the ly@xmath0line will be redshifted with respect to h@xmath0 .",
    "thus , if we measure the direction of the ly@xmath0h@xmath0 and/or ly@xmath0[]line offset ( hereafter defined as v_ly@xmath3 ) , we can distinguish an inflow from an outflow .",
    "the first such analysis for two ly@xmath0blobs shows that ly@xmath0is coincident with or redshifted by @xmath2200kms@xmath4  from the h@xmath0 line center ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see also mclinden et al .",
    "these offsets are much smaller than the @xmath21000kms@xmath4expected from superwind models and even smaller than those typical of lyman break galaxies ( lbgs ) , which are widely believed to have galactic outflows @xcite .",
    "thus , if v_ly@xmath3  is a proxy for outflow velocities ( @xmath12 ) , our initial results suggest that star formation- or agn - produced winds may not be required for powering ly@xmath0blobs , making other interpretations of their emission more likely .    however , we do not yet know if these results are representative of _ all _ ly@xmath0blobs or if we have failed to detect strong flows due to the projected orientations of these two sources .",
    "for example , the gas flow may not be isotropic .",
    "as in bipolar outflows in m82 , a galactic - scale outflow may occur in the direction of minimum pressure in the surrounding interstellar medium ( ism ) , often perpendicular to the stellar disks . or , if gas accretion is taking place in ly@xmath0blobs , numerical simulations suggest that the gas infall may occur preferentially along filamentary streams @xcite . thus , if the bulk motion of gas ( either infalling or outflowing ) happens to be mis - aligned with our line of sight ( los ) , then we may underestimate or even fail to detect the relative velocity shifts .",
    "therefore , it is critical to measure v_ly@xmath3for a larger sample to average over any geometric effects and obtain better constraints on the incidence , direction , speed , and isotropy of bulk gas motions in blobs .    in this paper , in order to overcome this geometry effects , we present new x - shooter optical and near - infrared ( nir ) spectroscopy of the six more ly@xmath0blobs at @xmath13 . note that the survey redshift of this ly@xmath0sample has been carefully selected to allow all important rest - frame optical diagnostic lines ( e.g. , [ ] @xmath113727 , [ ] @xmath115007 , h@xmath14@xmath114868 , h@xmath0@xmath116563 ) to fall in nir windows and to avoid bright oh sky lines and atmospheric absorption @xcite . with the resulting large sample of v_ly@xmath3measurements ( a total of eight ) ,",
    "we determine the relative frequency of gas infall versus outflow .",
    "benefiting from x - shooter s high spectral resolution and wide spectral coverage ( 3000   2.5 ) , we constrain the gas kinematics in ly@xmath0blobs using three different tracers : ( 1 ) the offset of the ly@xmath0profile with respect to a non - resonant nebular line , ( 2 ) the offset of an interstellar metal absorption line in the rest - frame uv with respect to the nebular emission line , and ( 3 ) a new indicator , the profile of the spectrally - resolved [ ] emission line .    this paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : observation ] , we review our sample selection and describe the x - shooter observations and data reduction . in section [ sec : result ] , we present the results from the x - shooter spectroscopy , confirming the ly@xmath0blobs redshift ( section [ sec : spec1d ] ) .",
    "we present 1d and 2d spectra in section [ sec : spec1d ] and section [ sec : spec2d ] , respectively .",
    "we briefly summarize the properties of individual systems in section [ sec : individual ] . in section [ sec :",

    "section [ sec : conclusion ] summarizes our conclusions . throughout this paper ,",
    "we adopt the cosmological parameters : @xmath15 = 70kms@xmath4mpc@xmath4 , @xmath16 , and @xmath17 .",
    "we observe six ly@xmath0blobs from the @xcite sample .",
    "these targets were chosen such that they are not x - ray detected [ @xmath18 @xmath5 ( 0.3  4.2)@xmath19@xmath20 ergs@xmath4 ; @xcite ] , and thus are not obvious agn , as our primary goal is to cleanly detect gas infall or outflow .",
    "these six blobs lie in the extended chandra deep field south ( ecdfs ) and were discovered via deep narrowband imaging with the ctio-4 m mosaic  ii camera and a custom narrowband filter ( _ nb_403 ) .",
    "this filter has a central wavelength of @xmath21 , designed for selecting ly@xmath0-emitting sources at @xmath13 . in figure",
    "[ fig : image ] , we show the images of these six ly@xmath0blobs ( cdfs - lab06 , 07 , 10 , 11 , 12 , 13 , 14 ) at various wavelengths ( _ ubk _ , ly@xmath0 , _ spitzer _ irac 3.6and _ hst _ f606w ; @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .    with x - shooter , we are targeting intermediate luminosity ( @xmath22@xmath2 10@xmath23 ergs@xmath4 ) ly@xmath0blobs : the higher ly@xmath0blob i d indicates the lower ly@xmath0luminosity in our sample .",
    "our sample was obtained from a blind survey , so combined with the two brightest ly@xmath0blobs presented in @xcite , the full sample ( a total of eight ) spans a wide and more representative range of ly@xmath0luminosity and size .",
    "furthermore , the transition from compact ly@xmath0emitters ( laes ; isophotal area of a few arcsec@xmath24 ) to extended ly@xmath0blobs ( @xmath2510arcsec@xmath24 ) is continuous @xcite , thus the gas kinematics for our faintest ly@xmath0blobs might share the properties with those of bright laes .",
    "we refer readers to @xcite for details of the sample selection and to @xcite for the first results of our spectroscopic campaign .",
    "we obtained high resolution optical ",
    "nir ( 3000 2.5 ) spectra of the six ly@xmath0blobs using x - shooter , a single object echelle spectrograph @xcite , on the vlt ut2 telescope in service mode between 2010 november 6 and 2011 january 28 . in table",
    "[ tab : obslog ] , we summarize the x - shooter observations . in figure",
    "[ fig : image ] , we show the location of the spectrograph slit on the sky , which was placed on uv - brightest galaxy or galaxies embedded at or near the ly@xmath0blob center .",
    "these galaxies or galaxy fragments also lie in the region of brightest ly@xmath0emission .",
    "later , we assume that their redshifts mark the systemic redshift of the ly@xmath0blob .",
    "x - shooter consists of three arms ( uvb , vis , nir ) , which covers the spectral ranges of 30005500 , 55001 , and 12.5 , respectively .",
    "this enormous spectral coverage allows us to obtain both ly@xmath0and h@xmath0lines with a _",
    "single _ exposure in contrast to our previous approach @xcite involving both optical and nir spectrograph .",
    "furthermore , x - shooter can detect at least one of the nebular lines ( [ ] , h@xmath14 , [ ] , h@xmath0 ) , which will provide the systemic velocity of the embedded galaxies .",
    "because at the redshift of our targets ( @xmath26 ) most of the emission lines of interest ( ly@xmath0 , , , [ ] , [ ] , h@xmath0 ) are located in the uvb or nir arms , we focus only on the uvb ( @xmath27 = 9001660 ) and nir ( @xmath27 = 30207500 ) part of spectra in this paper .",
    "the observations were carried out over eight nights and 14 observing blocks ( obs ) of one hour duration each . the sky condition was either clear or photometric , and the guide camera seeing ranged from 06 to 12 with a median of 08 depending on the ob .",
    "we adopted 16 and 12-wide slits for uvb and nir , yielding a spectral resolution of @xmath28 @xmath2 3300 and @xmath29 , respectively .",
    "the slit length is rather small ( 12 ) compared to typical long - slits . in each ob",
    ", we placed the slit on a target using a blind offset from a nearby star .",
    "using acquisition images taken after the blind - offset , we estimate that the telescope pointing and position angle of the slit are accurate within 0.2  and 0.5  on average , respectively .",
    "the individual exposure times were 680s and 240s for uvb and nir , respectively , and the telescope was nodded along the slit by @xmath30 2  while keeping the science targets always on the slit but at different detector positions .",
    "total exposure times were 0.8  3.2 hours depending on the targets . in general , we were always able to detect both ly@xmath0and at least one of the optical nebular lines within one ob .",
    "for accurate wavelength calibration , we took thar lamp frames through pinhole mask right before the science exposures and at the same telescope pointing to compensate for the effect of instrument flexure .",
    "for the uvb arm , we obtained another thar arc frame at the end of each ob in order to verify the wavelength solution where no bright sky lines are available .",
    "telluric standard stars ( b  type ) were taken after or before the science targets with similar airmass to correct for atmospheric absorption in the nir .",
    "spectrophotometric standard stars were observed with 5-wide slits once during the night as a part of the observatory s baseline calibration plan .",
    "we reduce the data using the eso x - shooter pipeline ( version 1.3.7 ) . in the uvb arm ,",
    "the frames are overscan - corrected , bias - subtracted , and flat - fielded with halogen and deuterium lamps .",
    "the sky background is then subtracted in the `` stare''-mode of the pipeline by modeling the sky in 2d as described in @xcite . in the nir arm ,",
    "dark current and sky background are removed from each science frame by subtracting the dithered `` sky '' frame ( `` nodding''-mode of the pipeline ) .",
    "then , we flat - field the data and correct for cosmic - ray hits and bad pixels . in both arms , these flat - fielded , sky - subtracted frames were corrected for the spatial distortions using multi - pinhole arc frames .    because we will compare the velocity centers of the ly@xmath0and h@xmath0 lines , we carefully verify the wavelength calibration . in the nir",
    ", we compare the wavelength solutions obtained from the oh sky lines in the science frames to those from the daytime arc lamps and flexure - compensation frames , i.e. , the pipeline solutions . in the uvb",
    ", we also compare the wavelength solutions obtained from the attached thar arc frames with the pipeline solutions .",
    "our wavelength calibration is accurate within @xmath24kms@xmath4 in both arms .",
    "furthermore , in the cases where we visited sources multiple times , all spectra agree each other .",
    "these frames are then rectified ( resampled ) and combined to create 2d spectra .",
    "we collapse the 2d spectra in the wavelength direction to measure the spatial extent of each emission line .",
    "then we extract 1d spectra from [ @xmath31 , @xmath32 apertures , where the @xmath33 is the gaussian width of the spatial profile .",
    "the aperture sizes are 2 35 in the uvb and 15  25 in the nir depending on the target .",
    "finally , the 1d spectra are corrected to heliocentric velocities and transformed to the vacuum wavelength .",
    "various emission lines in the uvb and nir arms confirm that ly@xmath0blobs lie at the survey redshift , @xmath34 .",
    "in addition to ly@xmath0and h@xmath0 , we cover other uv emission lines and the non - resonant [ ] @xmath353727,3729 , [ ] @xmath354959,5007 , and h@xmath14 @xmath114861lines . in figure [ fig : spec1d ] , we show 1d and 2d spectra of the six ly@xmath0blobs .",
    "the first three columns show the rest - frame uv emission lines ( ly@xmath0 , , ) from the x - shooter uvb arm , and the remaining columns show the rest - frame optical nebular emission lines ( [ ] , h@xmath14 , [ ] , h@xmath0 ) from the nir arm .    among the rest - frame optical nebular lines , the [ ]",
    "line is the brightest and detected with highest signal - to - noise ( s / n ) ratio in all cases , partly due to the low sky background and thermal instrument background in _",
    "we determine the systemic redshift using [ ]  doublets . in one case ( cdfs - lab14 ) , the brighter [ ]  line ( @xmath36 ) falls on top of an oh sky line , thus making it impossible to determine the line center . in this case",
    "we used the fainter [ ]  line ( @xmath37 ) .",
    "the vertical dashed lines in figure [ fig : spec1d ] indicate the line centers determined by [ ]  lines , which are then overlayed on other emission line profiles . as expected , we find that the line centers of all non - resonant emission lines agree well each other , to within @xmath210kms@xmath4 , showing that all of these lines are good indicators of systemic velocity .",
    "thus , the brightest [ ]  line can serve as best emission line to target for this survey redshift and instrument .",
    "the ly@xmath0 profiles are significantly broad compared to the non - resonant lines ( h@xmath0and / or [ ] ) in six cases out of the sample of eight ly@xmath0blobs , including the two from our previous work @xcite .",
    "these integrated 1d profile shapes range from an asymmetric single - peaked profile ( cdfs - lab06 , 07 , 10 ) , to a double - peaked profile with a stronger red peak ( cdfs - lab02 , 13 ) , to a double - peaked profile with two similar intensity peaks ( cdfs - lab14 ) .",
    "the ly@xmath0profiles of even this small sample show extremely diverse morphologies consistent with simple radiative model predictions @xcite with varying geometry and outflow velocities ( see also * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the remaining two ly@xmath0profiles are narrower _ relative to _ the [ ] lines and show slightly extended wings ( cdfs - lab01 and 11 ) .",
    "note that the ly@xmath0line width of cdfs - lab01 is one of the largest among our sample , but the blue side of its ly@xmath0profile agrees well with its h@xmath0profile @xcite . while there is an underlying broad component in cdfs - lab11 ,",
    "the width of the dominant narrow component is small , comparable to that of the [ ] line ( see  [ sec : type2 ] ) .",
    "these are the two ly@xmath0blobs where and emission lines are also detected indicating that they contain a hard ionizing source , possibly an agn . if photo - ionization by an agn is indeed responsible for the and emission , and possibly the extended ly@xmath0emission as well , the discovery of narrow ly@xmath0profiles suggests that the ly@xmath0blob gas is highly - ionized , i.e. , that the resonant scattering of ly@xmath0is not effective enough to alter the profile significantly",
    ". we will further investigate the details of these , emission lines and the implications for agn in a future paper ( y.yang in preparation ) .",
    "the fraction of double - peaked profiles is significant : @xmath238% ( 3/8 ) , which is roughly consistent with the findings for lbgs and laes at @xmath1 = 23 . among lbgs",
    ", @xcite find that @xmath230% of lbgs with ly@xmath0emission show multiple - peaked profiles .",
    "@xcite also find that @xmath250% of lae s profiles have multiple peaks .",

    "the third column shows the spatial profiles along the slit , i.e. , collapsed in the wavelength direction .",
    "the last column shows the 1d ly@xmath0and [ ] profiles that are extracted from the different parts of the slit , as indicated with vertical arrows in the third column .    in four cases ( cdfs - lab06 , 10 , 13 , 14 )",
    ", the ly@xmath0 spectrum is spatially extended relative to the [ ] line , confirming the narrowband imaging result that the ly@xmath0-emitting gas extends beyond the embedded galaxies that are probably responsible for the [ ] emission .",
    "note that the x - shooter spectroscopy reaches much shallower ly@xmath0surface brightness limit ( @xmath21.53@xmath19@xmath38ergs@xmath4@xmath39arcsec@xmath40 ) than the narrowband imaging ( @xmath25@xmath19@xmath41ergs@xmath4@xmath39arcsec@xmath40 ; 3@xmath33limit ) .    in two ly@xmath0blobs ( cdfs - lab06 and 10 ) , the [ ] lines",
    "are spatially resolved . however , there is no evidence that the [ ] or h@xmath0lines are extended beyond the uv continuum emission arising from stars in the embedded galaxies seen in figure 2 .",

    "second , we constrain the outflow speed from the interstellar metal absorption lines in three galaxies where we are able to detect the rest - frame uv continuum in the spectrum .",
    "lastly , we present a new tracer of kinematics in four ly@xmath0blobs : characterizing the breadth and asymmetry of the [ ] line profile . note that while we detect an asymmetric wing in some [ ] line profiles , it does not affect the line centroid , which is essential in determining the systemic velocity in the first technique above .",

    "we adopt the second measurements in this paper and show these fits in figure [ fig : line_comparison ] and table [ tab : lyman ] .",
    "none of the conclusions in this paper are affected by this choice .",
    "figure [ fig : voffset ] shows the distribution of v_ly@xmath3  of the eight ly@xmath0blob galaxies in comparison with 41 lbgs that have both h@xmath0 and ly@xmath0spectra @xcite . because the spectral resolutions of our ly@xmath0spectra obtained from vlt / x - shooter and magellan / mage are higher than those of the ly@xmath0profiles of the lbgs ( fwhm @xmath45 370kms@xmath4 ) , we test if the different spectral resolutions affect the ly@xmath0blob  lbg comparison .",
    "we repeat the measurement of v_ly@xmath3  after convolving our ly@xmath0profiles to the spectral resolution of lbg sample .",
    "the v_ly@xmath3  values change by a negligible amount ( only @xmath3050kms@xmath4 ) except for cdfs - lab02 , where v_ly@xmath3  increases by + 100kms@xmath4because of its sharp red peak .",

    "the v_ly@xmath3  distribution for galaxies within our ly@xmath0blobs reveals smaller velocity offsets than typical of lbgs , confirming previous claims ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see also mclinden et al .",
    "galaxies within blobs have v_ly@xmath3= @xmath4660 @xmath47 + 400kms@xmath4  with an average of @xmath48 = 160kms@xmath4 , while lbgs at similar redshifts have v_ly@xmath3= 250 ",
    "900kms@xmath4  with @xmath48 = 445kms@xmath4 .",
    "the remaining question is how to interpret these small v_ly@xmath3  values .",
    "two possibilities are : ( 1 ) v_ly@xmath3  is a proxy for the gas outflow velocity ( @xmath12 ) , suggesting that the outflows here are weaker than in other star - forming galaxies at @xmath1 = 23 @xcite , or ( 2 ) there is less neutral gas close to the systemic velocity of the embedded galaxies @xcite , and v_ly@xmath3  is independent of the outflow speed .",
    "we discussed the caveats associated with interpreting v_ly@xmath3  in @xcite and revisit this issue in  [ sec : dvlya ] .    in the direction of the embedded galaxies ,",
    "we do not find any ly@xmath0profile that is blue - peak dominated , i.e. , v_ly@xmath3@xmath5 0kms@xmath4 .",
    "therefore , there is no evidence along these lines - of - sight for infalling gas ( but see  [ sec : cdfs - lab10 ] ) . while the statistics are still small , we place an upper limit on the covering factor of infalling gas ( if any ) detectable with the v_ly@xmath3  technique . here",
    "the covering factor of any inflowing streams like those predicted by cold - mode accretion @xcite must be less than @xmath213% ( 1/8 ) .",
    "we further discuss the covering factor of cold streams in  [ sec : covering_factor ] .              while strong emission lines such as ly@xmath0and [ ]  are relatively easy to detect , interstellar metal absorption lines provide a less ambiguous way to measure the outflow velocity of neutral gas lying _ in front of _ the galaxies targeted with our spectroscopic slit .",
    "however , due to the faint uv continuum ( @xmath49 = 23.826.5 mag ) of our targets , even 8-m telescope struggles to detect their continuum for absorption line studies .",
    "therefore , we obtain higher - s / n absorption line profiles by stacking several lines in each galaxy .",
    "our aim is to test the mild outflow interpretation of our v_ly@xmath3  results by comparing the velocity offset of the stacked ism absorption profile to the systemic velocity of the galaxy : @xmath50 .    among the six ly@xmath0blobs ,",
    "only the uv continua of the galaxies in cdfs - lab07 and cdfs - lab14 have s / n higher than 1.5 per spectral pixel ( @xmath22030kms@xmath4 ) , allowing us to marginally extract the absorption profiles .",
    "figure [ fig : spec_abs](top ) shows the rest - frame uv spectra of these two galaxies in comparison with the lbg composite @xcite . for comparison , we also show the boxcar - smoothed spectra over 20 pixels , corresponding to a velocity width of 450600kms@xmath4 .",
    "while it is difficult to identify the absorption lines in the un - binned spectra , the smoothed spectra show a good match to the composite spectrum , revealing several low- and high - ionization lines .",
    "as suggested above , it is still difficult to measure individual absorption line profiles , so we stack the five low - ionization lines : @xmath111260 , @xmath111302 , @xmath111334 , @xmath111526 , @xmath111670 to increase the s / n .",
    "we do not include the and lines in the stacking , as these high ionization lines are contaminated with broader absorption features arising from stellar winds from massive stars @xcite , which are hard to remove in our low s / n spectra .",
    "furthermore , it is possible that these high ionization lines trace different state of gas , while the low ionization lines show similar profiles @xcite . in figure",
    "[ fig : spec_abs](bottom ) , we show the stacked absorption profiles for three galaxies , including the re - analyzed cdfs - lab02 spectrum that we obtained earlier with magellan / mage @xcite .",
    "the stacked absorption profiles here are consistent with weaker outflows than required by the super / hyperwind hypothesis for ly@xmath0  blob emission .",
    "these profiles are also consistent with the interpretation of small v_ly@xmath3  indicating small outflow speed , as discussed in ",
    "[ sec : shift ] . in two galaxies",
    "( within cdfs - lab02 and 07 ) , the absorption profiles have minima around @xmath46200kms@xmath4and might extend up to @xmath46500kms@xmath4 , although the exact end of the profile is uncertain due to the low s / n .",
    "the shapes of these two absorption profiles are similar to those of typical star - forming galaxies ( i.e. , lbgs ) at the same epoch @xcite , and the implied outflow velocities are comparable to or slower than in the lbgs . by fitting a gaussian profile ,",
    "we obtain @xmath50= @xmath46177@xmath3031kms@xmath4and @xmath46236@xmath3031kms@xmath4for cdfs - lab02 and cdfs - lab07 , respectively .",
    "we do not find any redshifted absorption component , which is consistent with the absence of any blueshifted ly@xmath0emission line associated with these galaxies .",
    "in contrast , the profile of cdfs - lab14 s galaxy has a minimum at @xmath51 @xmath45 0kms@xmath4  ( @xmath50= @xmath4659@xmath3032 kms@xmath4 ) without any significant blueshifted ( outflowing ) component .",
    "while the other two profiles terminate roughly at @xmath51 @xmath45 0kms@xmath4 , cdfs - lab14 s profile extends to @xmath51 @xmath25 0kms@xmath4 .",
    "thus , its ism absorption and ly@xmath0  profiles are both consistent with the simple rt model expectation that a symmetric , double - peaked ly@xmath0profile should emerge from static gas or the absence of of bulk motions .",
    "furthermore , the absorption profile is almost saturated , indicating that the column density in this ly@xmath0blob could be higher than for the other two systems .",
    "we will place a constraint on the column density of its ly@xmath0-emitting gas in  [ sec : column_density ] .    for cdfs - lab14 ,",
    "the location of the dip between the blue and red ly@xmath0velocity peaks changes little for the two extraction apertures shown in figure [ fig : spec2d ] : one along the line of sight toward the embedded galaxy ( the [ ] source ) and the other encompassing the spatially extended gas around @xmath52 = @xmath460.5 .",
    "note that such a trough between ly@xmath0peaks is often interpreted as arising from absorption by the neutral media between the ly@xmath0source and observers .",
    "for example , @xcite claim that their ifu spectra of a ly@xmath0blob ( ssa22-lab02 ; steidel blob 2 ) suggest that the ly@xmath0emission is absorbed by a foreground slab of neutral gas swept out by a galactic scale outflow .",
    "more recently , @xcite show instead that the absorption troughs in the ly@xmath0emission are actually located at the systemic velocity determined by the [ ] emission line , i.e. , there are negligible velocity offsets between any foreground screen and the systemic velocity .",
    "cdfs - lab14 also demonstrates that a coherent velocity trough , at least over a @xmath210kpc scale , can arise entirely from complicated radiative transfer effects even if there are no significant bulk motions in the ly@xmath0-emitting gas .",
    "the central galaxies in four ly@xmath0blobs ( cdfs - lab06 , 07 , 13 , 14 ) show a broad and/or shifted underlying component to the [ ] profile , which provides additional constraints on the kinematics of warm ionized gas in the vicinity of the galaxies . to the authors knowledge , this is the first detection of broadened , asymmetric [ ] profiles from narrowband - selected ly@xmath0-emitting galaxies at high redshifts , demonstrating that high spectral resolution is required to fully exploit the nir spectroscopy of ly@xmath0galaxies .",
    "we emphasize again that these broad underlying components , even when shifted in velocity , do not affect our measurements of [ ] line centers , because the [ ] flux density at the core is dominated by the narrower component , which is likely to arise from nebular regions in the embedded galaxy . as discussed previously , the line centers determined from other non - resonant emission lines ( e.g. , h@xmath0and h@xmath14 ) agree to within @xmath210kms@xmath4 .",
    "therefore , our measurements of systemic velocity , critical for determining v_ly@xmath3   and @xmath50 , remain unchanged .    in figure [",
    "fig : o3profile ] , we show close - ups of the [ ] profiles . in cdfs - lab11 , which has the narrowest and the most symmetric ly@xmath0profile , the [ ] line is also symmetric .",
    "cdfs - lab10 is excluded from the following analysis because its [ ] line is elongated in position - velocity space , suggesting some velocity shear , and the neighboring galaxy ( cdfs - lab10a ) makes it difficult to reliably extract its profile ( see  [ sec : cdfs - lab10 ] for more details of this system ) . in the remaining four ly@xmath0blobs ,",
    "the [ ] profile either has an asymmetric wing ( cdfs - lab06 , 07 , 13 ) or a symmetric broad component or components ( cdfs - lab14 ) .",
    "note that the cdfs - lab06 profile in figure [ fig : o3profile ] also includes the light from a faint neighbor or clump to the northwest that is slightly blueshifted ( @xmath250kms@xmath4 ) .",
    "therefore , the somewhat redshifted wing of cdfs - lab06 is not due to this contamination .    to extract the underlying broad components",
    ", we fit the line profiles with two gaussian functions ( the two dot - dashed lines in figure [ fig : o3profile ] ) and list the results in table [ tab : o3profile ] . in the appendix",
    ", we describe our fitting procedures in detail .",
    "we adopt a two - component fit for simplicity and for comparison with previous studies ( although we can not rule out the possibility that the velocity wings consist of multiple small narrow components ) .",
    "the line center of the broad component ( @xmath53 ) agree with that of the narrow component in cdfs - lab14 , is blueshifted in cdfs - lab07 , and in cdfs - lab13 , and is marginally redshifted in cdfs - lab06 .",
    "the widths of the broad components , corrected for the instrumental resolution , are relatively small : @xmath54 = 45  120kms@xmath4(fwhm = 100  280kms@xmath4 ) , which would not be detected with lower resolution or lower s / n spectra .    to quantify the contribution of the broad components , we measure the `` broad - to - narrow ratio '' ( @xmath55 ) , which is defined as the ratio of the flux in the broad [ ] emission line to the flux in the narrow component . because the fluxes in the two gaussian components are anti - correlated with each other , this ratio has large uncertainties .",
    "we also list the `` broad flux fraction '' ( @xmath56 ) , which is the ratio of the flux in broad emission to the total [ ] flux ( @xmath57/@xmath58 ) . the broad emission component is significant with @xmath55 = 0.4  0.8 constituting 30%45% of the total [ ] line flux ( although the uncertainties are fairly large ) .",
    "the measurements of the underlying components are highly dependent on the s / n of spectra . due to the low s / n in the @xmath59-band , we are not able to reliably measure the broad line components from permitted lines such as h@xmath0or h@xmath14 , but similar broad wings are also present in the h@xmath0profiles of at least two galaxies ( cdfs - lab07 and 14 ; see figure [ fig : spec1d ] ) .",
    "what is the mechanism responsible for the broad component in the [ ] profiles ?",
    "a broad component with a larger line - width ( @xmath60 ) of a few hundred kms@xmath4is generally interpreted as a signature of starburst - driven galactic winds , and often observed in local dwarf starbursts ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) and in local ultraluminous infrared galaxies ( ulirgs ) ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) . while broad components in forbidden lines such as [ ] are not related to the broad line region ( blr ) of type 1 agn , they might still arise from the shocked narrow line region ( nlr ) in agn",
    ". however , the composite spectrum of all of our x - shooter sample has a line ratio @xmath61([]/h@xmath0)@xmath5 @xmath62 , excluding any significant contribution from agn ( y.  yang et al .  in preparation ) .",
    "furthermore , in cdfs - lab11 , whose and emission lines hint at the presence of an agn , no broad component is detected .    at high redshift ( @xmath63 ) , broadened emission lines were first reported by @xcite .",
    "they found that the stacked spectrum of @xmath64 star - forming galaxies ( sfgs ) shows broad ( fwhm @xmath2 550kms@xmath4 ) emission underneath the h@xmath0+[]line complex .",
    "more recently , stacked spectra of higher s / n data have revealed that the broad emission is spatially extended over a half - light radius @xcite .",
    "broad emission lines are now detected from individual sfgs and even from giant star - forming clumps within them @xcite .",
    "@xcite show that @xmath64 sfgs show broad wings of h@xmath0emission with fwhm @xmath2 300 ",

    ". thus , the broad component in these galaxies is attributed to powerful galactic outflows . for compact ly@xmath0emitters , although there are increasing number of detections of [ ] and h@xmath0(e.g .",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , broad emission in [ ] has not been reported so far , perhaps due to the lower spectral resolution or lower s / n of these studies .",
    "therefore , at the moment , it is not clear whether the broad component and sometime line asymmetry that we observe in ly@xmath0blobs is a general property of ly@xmath0-selected galaxies .    as in local ulirgs and in high redshift sfgs",
    ", the detection of a broad component in the [ ] profile here suggests warm ionized outflows from the galaxies within ly@xmath0blobs , presumably driven by supernovae and stellar winds .",
    "however , while the flux fraction of our broad emission is comparable to those of sfgs , the broad [ ] wings are narrower ( @xmath54 = 45  120kms@xmath4 ) and the inferred velocities much smaller @xmath65= 150  260kms@xmath4 .",
    "therefore , at face value , the warm ionized outflows from the ly@xmath0blob galaxies are not as strong as those in sfgs at similar redshift .",
    "furthermore , these estimates for outflow velocity are roughly consistent with the values obtained from our two other kinematic measures , v_ly@xmath3and @xmath50([sec : shift ] and  [ sec : absorption ] ) , independently discounting shock - heating via super / hyperwinds as a viable powering mechanism .",
    "constraining the physical state of the ly@xmath0-emitting gas in a ly@xmath0blob is a critical step to understand its emission mechanism and to directly compare the observations with the numerical simulations , which predict the ly@xmath0emissivity maps from the gas density , temperature , and uv radiation fields . in this section , as a first step , we estimate the column density of a ly@xmath0blob , cdfs - lab14 .",
    "the v_ly@xmath3and @xmath50analyses of cdfs - lab14 are consistent with a simple rt model in which the surrounding gas is static or without bulk motions .",
    "the third kinematic indicator , the [ ] profile , which suggests a mild outflow , either contradicts the other indicators or is sensitive to gas in a different state ( e.g. , warm , ionized instead of cold , neutral ) or distribution ( e.g. , around galaxy instead of in galaxy ) .",
    "here we use the ly@xmath0emission and ism absorption line profiles to place a constraint on the amount of neutral hydrogen in this ly@xmath0blob .",
    "ultimately , by comparing the ly@xmath0profile with detailed rt models , one could extract a wealth of information , including outflow speed , optical depth , and column density ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "we defer such detailed analysis to the future papers and consider the most simplistic case in this section .",
    "ly@xmath0line transfer in an extremely thick medium of neutral gas has been studied over many decades , and the analytic solutions for simple geometries ( like a static homogeneous slab or uniform sphere ) are known @xcite .",
    "we consider a simple geometry in which a ly@xmath0source is located at the center of a static homogeneous slab with optical depth of @xmath68 from the center to the edge . because ly@xmath0photons generated at the center escape the system through random scattering in the frequency space , the emergent line spectrum is double - peaked profile with its maxima at @xmath69 , where @xmath70 represents the line frequency in units of doppler width @xmath71 . @xmath72 and @xmath68 are the voigt parameter and ly@xmath0optical depth at the line center , respectively @xcite . in terms of velocity ,",
    "the separation between blue and red peaks with same the intensity is @xmath73 where @xmath74 and @xmath75 represent the doppler parameter ( @xmath76 ) and the column density of neutral hydrogen , respectively . if we adopt a uniform sphere geometry instead of a slab , the coefficient of the above equation will decrease to 336kms@xmath4 , and the product ( @xmath74 @xmath75 ) will increase by a factor of two for a fixed @xmath77 value .",
    "note that the blue - to - red peak separation is degenerate between two parameters , @xmath74 and @xmath75 .    from the ly@xmath0profile of cdfs - lab14 ( figure [ fig : spec1d ] and [ fig : spec2d ] ) , we measure the separation between the blue and red peaks , @xmath77 = 790@xmath3039kms@xmath4 . in the analytic solution ,",
    "the peaks on the blue and red sides of the systemic velocity are each symmetric , whereas for cdfs - lab14 they are slightly asymmetric . as a result ,",
    "the rt in this system may require ultimately a more complicated model than the assumed simple geometry .    to constrain @xmath75 ,",
    "we consider two extreme cases for the doppler parameter @xmath74 : first , as a lower limit , @xmath74 @xmath25 12.85kms@xmath4 , obtained by assuming a temperature @xmath78 = 10@xmath79k and ignoring the turbulence term .",

    "second , this gas might be tidally - stripped material arising from a galaxy - galaxy interaction : the two galaxies ( b and c ) are separated by @xmath230kpc in projected distance and @xmath2200kms@xmath4 in velocity space .",
    "lastly , but most interestingly , this blueshifted ly@xmath0emission could be the long - sought , but elusive cold gas accretion along filamentary streams @xcite .",
    "note that similarly blueshifted ly@xmath0emission has been reported in a faint ly@xmath0emitter at @xmath1 = 3.344 , which was discovered in an extremely deep , blind spectroscopic search @xcite .",

    "@xcite suggest that this blueshifted ly@xmath0emission can be explained if the gas is inflowing along a filament behind the galaxy and emits fluorescent ly@xmath0photons induced by the ionizing flux escaping from the galaxy .",

    "still , we were able to successfully link the ly@xmath0and [ ] sources with the embedded galaxies in this complex system and to find blueshifted ly@xmath0emission that might point to gas inflow .",
    "this example raises concerns about how to identify the sources of ly@xmath0emission and to interpret the gas morphologies and kinematics solely from ly@xmath0lines .",
    "elongated or filamentary ly@xmath0morphologies may be a sign of bipolar outflows @xcite or related to filamentary cold streams . in cdfs - lab10 ,",
    "the ly@xmath0spectrum shows two kinematically distinct components around the brightest galaxy a : the upper ( @xmath42 @xmath25 0 ) and lower parts are blue- and redshifted , respectively . in the absence of [ ] spectroscopy , the ly@xmath0data appear to be consistent with either of the above outflow or infalling stream scenarios .",
    "however , our detailed analysis including the [ ] line clearly shows that one of the ly@xmath0components arises from the faint galaxy c , which would be difficult to detect without _ hst _ imaging and is likely the dominant source of ly@xmath0emission .",
    "therefore , we stress that interpreting the ly@xmath0morphology and spectra requires deep high - resolution imaging and the determination of the systemic velocity through nir spectroscopy .",
    "under the assumption that inflowing gas streams ( if any ) are randomly distributed , and from the non - detection of any blueshifted ly@xmath0h@xmath0or ly@xmath0[]offset in the direction of the eight embedded galaxies tested here ( although see section [ sec : cdfs - lab10 ] ) , we constrain the covering fraction of inflows to be @xmath51/8 ( 13% ) . likewise ,",
    "if all of our v_ly@xmath3offsets are different projections of the same collimated outflow from the galaxies and are a proxy for outflow speed , the covering fraction of _ strong _ outflows , i.e. , super / hyper - winds , is less than @xmath213% .",
    "the covering fraction of gas flows to which we are referring here has a different meaning than often discussed in the literature . in these theoretical papers ,",
    "the covering factor is defined as how many sight - lines will be detected in metal or  _ absorption _ when bright background sources close to the galaxies are targeted . what we measure in this paper is how often the inflowing gas is aligned with observer s sight - lines so that the column of neutral gas becomes optically thick and blue - shifts ly@xmath0lines against systemic velocity . nonetheless , predict that the covering factor within the virial radius ( @xmath89 @xmath45 75kpc ) from their simulated galaxies with a halo mass of @xmath90 = 3@xmath19@xmath91@xmath10  at @xmath92 is relatively small : @xmath23% and 10% for dlas and lyman limit systems ( lls ) , respectively . within 0.5@xmath19@xmath89 ,",
    "this factor increases to @xmath210% and 30% , respectively , and presumably will be much higher directly towards the galaxies ( i.e. , for a pencil beam or looking down - the - barrel ) . note that ignore galactic winds in order to isolate the inflowing streams , so we expect that there will be enough dense material arising from gas accretion to affect the transfer of ly@xmath0photons in our experiments .",
    "what is uncertain is that how the velocity field of this dense material near the galaxy will shift the emerging ly@xmath0profiles and the statistics of v_ly@xmath3 , because answering this requires full ly@xmath0radiative transfer treatment .",
    "unlike rt models with simple geometry ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , cosmological simulations @xcite predict that the gas inflow can only slightly enhance the blue ly@xmath0peak , implying that the overall profile will be still red - peak dominated if the effects of outflows from the galaxies and igm absorption are fully considered . therefore , according to these simulations , our non - detection of infall signatures does not contradict the cold stream model .",
    "the ly@xmath0profiles calculated from cold - stream models are in general the integrated profiles of ly@xmath0-emitting gas around the galaxies , which are not detectable by our study .",
    "what we need are the predictions for how ly@xmath0profiles are modified and/or shifted against optically - thin lines along the line - of - sight to the galaxies embedded in the extended gas . in this way",
    ", the distribution of predicted v_ly@xmath3can be compared directly with the observations .",
    "it is also critical to take into account the effect of simultaneous outflows and inflows .",
    "for example , the h@xmath0 and [ ] detections suggest that the galaxies embedded in the blobs are forming stars , which could generate mechanical feedback into the surrounding gas cloud .",
    "thus , one might have expected that the innermost part of the gas cloud , close to the galaxies , has galactic scale outflows similar to those of other star - forming galaxies at @xmath93 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "gas infall ( if any ) may dominate at larger radii ( up to @xmath250 kpc , the typical blob size ) . in this case",
    ", the emerging ly@xmath0profile will be more sensitive to the core of the ly@xmath0blob , presumably the densest part of the cgm , than to the gas infall . as a result",
    ", it might be difficult to detect the infalling gas by measuring v_ly@xmath3 . this kind of more realistic , infall+outflow model has not been considered yet in rt calculations , so its spectral signatures are unknown .      in our sample of eight ly@xmath0blobs , the embedded galaxies have smaller velocity offsets ( @xmath48 = 160kms@xmath4 ) than those of lbgs ( 445kms@xmath4 ) . the remaining question is how to interpret these small v_ly@xmath3values .",
    "we consider two possibilities here .    first , if we assume a simple geometry where the outflowing material forms a spherical shell that consists of continuous media , v_ly@xmath3originates from the resonant scattering of the ly@xmath0photons at the shell as discussed in @xcite .",
    "note that the emerging ly@xmath0profile is independent of the physical size of the shell as long as the shell have the same outflow velocity .",
    "therefore , this model is applicable to ly@xmath0blobs . in this shell model , a central monochromatic point source is surrounded by an expanding shell of neutral gas with varying column density ( @xmath94 ) and doppler @xmath74 parameter ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "a generic prediction is that the ly@xmath0emission is asymmetric , with the details of the line shape depending on the shell velocity , doppler parameter @xmath74 , and optical depth of  column in the shell .",
    "in this simple geometry , the v_ly@xmath3  values can be used as a proxy for outflow velocity of expanding shell , i.e. , @xmath12 @xmath45 0.5v_ly@xmath3 .",
    "if this is the case , outflow velocities from blob galaxies are much smaller than the values expected from models of strong galactic winds .",
    "furthermore , these offsets are even smaller than the typical ly@xmath0h@xmath0 offsets ( 250900kms@xmath4 ) of lbgs @xcite .",
    "in particular , while cdfs - lab14 has the largest v_ly@xmath3  for its red peak , its blue and red peaks have similar intensity , which is a characteristic of a static medium or no bulk motions @xcite .",
    "second , in an `` expanding bullet '' or `` clumpy cgm '' model @xcite , the outflowing material , which consists of small individual clumps , has a wide velocity range rather than a single value , and the ly@xmath0profiles are determined by the doppler shift that photons acquire when they are last scattered by the clumps just before escaping the system . in this case , the ly@xmath0h@xmath0  offsets are primarily modulated by the amount of gas that has @xmath95 component ( though it is not clear where this material is spatially located ) ; thus v_ly@xmath3  is not directly correlated with outflow velocity .",
    "if this is the case , the small v_ly@xmath3  value of the galaxies in our ly@xmath0blobs simply indicates that there is less neutral gas at the galaxies systemic velocity ( presumably near the galaxy ) compared to lbgs .",
    "testing these two hypotheses for ly@xmath0blobs or lbgs first requires a detailed comparison between high resolution ly@xmath0profiles and rt predictions .",
    "this test is beyond the scope of this paper and will be discussed in the future . as emphasized by @xcite ,",
    "one also needs to check the consistency of the ly@xmath0profiles with ism metal absorption profiles , which depends on high s / n continuum spectra that are not available here . nonetheless , we attempted such an analysis by stacking many low - ionization absorption lines in three galaxies ( section [ sec : absorption ] ) .    for those three embedded galaxies with measured v_ly@xmath3  and @xmath50",
    ", the outflow velocity estimates from both methods roughly agree within the uncertainties arising from low s / n and from rt complications .",
    "however , closer inspection reveals a discrepancy between the observations and the simplest rt models in that we obtain @xmath50@xmath2 @xmath46200kms@xmath4and also v_ly@xmath3@xmath2 200kms@xmath4while the rt model with an expanding shell geometry predicts @xmath50= @xmath46@xmath12= @xmath96 v_ly@xmath3 .",
    "this discrepancy has also appeared in lbgs @xcite , and @xcite show that the stacked ly@xmath0profile of lbgs with double - peaked profiles can not be reproduced accurately by the shell model . for a wide range of parameters ( @xmath12 , @xmath74 , @xmath97 ) , @xcite can not reproduce the location of the red peak , the width of the ly@xmath0  profile , and the metal absorption profile at the same time .",
    "we attribute this discrepancy to the very simple nature of the shell model . by construction or by definition of the expanding `` shell ''",
    ", the internal velocity dispersion of the media that constitute the shell should be much smaller than the expansion velocity of the shell itself , i.e. , @xmath12/@xmath74 @xmath88 1 .",
    "therefore , one expects that the metal absorption lines arising from this thin shell have very narrow line widths @xmath98 similar to @xmath74 , typically @xmath2tens of kms@xmath4 .",
    "however , such narrow absorption lines are not observed in either lbgs or ly@xmath0blobs . clearly , rt calculations with more realistic geometries and allowing a more thorough comparison with the observed ly@xmath0profiles are required .",
    "given that the galaxies within our ly@xmath0blobs were selected , by definition , as ly@xmath0emitters with high equivalent width ( ew ) , the comparison with laes suggests that small v_ly@xmath3  values are a general characteristic of all high ew ly@xmath0-selected populations , be they compact or extended .",
    "in addition to this work and @xcite , there are recent studies that measure v_ly@xmath3  for bright compact ly@xmath0-emitters @xcite and ly@xmath0blobs @xcite , which also find small ly@xmath0[]offsets for laes ranging from 35  340kms@xmath4 . a kolmogorov  smirnov test fails to distinguish the v_ly@xmath3distribution of our eight ly@xmath0blobs from that of ten compact laes compiled from the four studies mentioned above .",
    "thus , we now have a fairly large sample of high ",
    "ew ly@xmath0emitters ( compact or extended ) with v_ly@xmath3  = @xmath4660 @xmath47 + 400kms@xmath4 , which is clearly different from the distribution for lbgs ( see section [ sec : shift ] ) .",
    "the smaller v_ly@xmath3of laes and labs might be related to their higher ly@xmath0equivalent widths .",
    "an anti - correlation between ew(ly@xmath0 ) and v_ly@xmath3 in a compilation of lae and lbg samples has been suggested @xcite . even within the lbg population itself",
    "there is an indication that v_ly@xmath3decreases as ew(ly@xmath0 ) increases .",
    "@xcite find an anti - correlation between the ew(ly@xmath0 ) and the velocity offsets between interstellar absorption and ly@xmath0emission lines , @xmath99 .",
    "is used in @xcite . ] from the stacked spectra of lbgs binned at different ew(ly@xmath0 ) , they show that with increasing ly@xmath0line strength from @xmath4615to 53 , @xmath100 decreases from 800kms@xmath4to 480kms@xmath4 .",
    "because @xmath100 = v_ly@xmath3 + @xmath101 , we can infer that v_ly@xmath3is likely to decrease as ew(ly@xmath0 ) increases unless the observed anti - correlation is entirely due to @xmath101 .    the origin of the apparent relationship between larger ew(ly@xmath0 ) and smaller v_ly@xmath3  is not understood .",
    "it is possible that other physical properties drive this anti - correlation : for example , lbgs tend to have brighter continuum magnitudes , thus likely higher star formation rates and stellar masses , than are of typical laes . @xcite",
    "propose that low column density , and thus a small number of resonant scatterings of ly@xmath0photons , might be responsible for the strong ly@xmath0emission and small v_ly@xmath3of ly@xmath0emitters .",
    "what we do know from our v_ly@xmath3  measurements is that laes and ly@xmath0blobs are kinematically similar .",
    "therefore , the mystery remains as to what powers ly@xmath0  nebulae , or , in other words , why certain galaxies have more spatially - extended ly@xmath0  gas ( i.e. , blobs ) than others ( i.e. , compact laes ) with similar v_ly@xmath3  and ew(ly@xmath0 ) . while the answer may be related to photo - ionization from ( buried ) agn ( e.g. , see section [ sec : type2 ] or @xcite ) , an extended proto - intracluster medium that can scatter or transport the ly@xmath0photons out to larger distances , or less dust to destroy ly@xmath0  photons ( cf .",
    "* ) , discriminating among these possibilities will require a multi - wavelength analysis of a large sample of ly@xmath0blobs .",
    "for now , the similarity here of labs and laes suggests that differences in gas kinematics are not responsible for the extended ly@xmath0halos .      from the nearly symmetric ly@xmath0profile ( fig .",
    "[ fig : cdfs - lab11 ] ) , and detection , and rest - frame optical line ratios , we hypothesize that an agn in cdfs - lab11 ionizes the gas surrounding the galaxies , making ly@xmath0  _ relatively _ optically thin and preventing the resonant scattering of ly@xmath0photons from dominating the shape of the profile .",
    "while fitting the profile requires an underlying broad component ( fwhm @xmath45 480kms@xmath4 ) , the narrow component ( redshifted by @xmath45 80kms@xmath4 ) has a small velocity width ( fwhm @xmath45 110kms@xmath4 ) , comparable to that of the [ ] line ( @xmath4580kms@xmath4 ) .",
    "therefore , if we assume that ly@xmath0and [ ] photons originate from the same region , resonant scattering by the igm / cgm does not broaden the intrinsic profile significantly . in other words , at least along our los , the optical depth of cdfs - lab11 s igm / cgm is smaller than for the other ly@xmath0blobs in our sample and for typical ly@xmath0emitters at high redshifts .",
    "a nearly symmetric and narrow ly@xmath0profile such as cdfs - lab11 s is rarely observed among high-@xmath1 ly@xmath0-emitting galaxies .",
    "however , ly@xmath0radiative transfer calculations show that such ly@xmath0profiles can be generated in the presence of a central ionizing source . for example , @xcite investigate the emerging ly@xmath0profiles from an collapsing / expanding sphere centered on an ionizing source ( an agn ) for different luminosities ( see their figures 11 and 12 ) .",
    "they find that if the ionizing source is strong and the ly@xmath0is _ relatively _ optically thin ( line - center optical depth @xmath68 @xmath5 @xmath102 ) , the separation of the characteristic double - peaks become smaller ( @xmath77 @xmath103 100kms@xmath4 ) as the ionizing source gets stronger .",
    "the overall profile becomes symmetric , and is blue or redshifted depending on the flow direction , but again by small amount ( v_ly@xmath3@xmath103 100kms@xmath4 ) .",
    "these authors were skeptical that the sign of the ly@xmath0shift and the small ly@xmath0offset ( v_ly@xmath3@xmath2 a few tens kms@xmath4 ) from the systemic velocity could be measured .",
    "however , with the right strategy ( i.e. , high spectral resolution and a careful choice of survey redshift ) , we are able to reliably measure the predicted small offset .",
    "clearly , more detailed comparisons with the rt models are required .    a broad , asymmetric ly@xmath0profile with a sharp blue edge ( e.g. , cdfs - lab06 and 07 ) is characteristic of high-@xmath1 ly@xmath0-emitters . in spectroscopic",
    "follow - up observations of ly@xmath0-emitter candidates , where spectral coverage is limited , these characteristics alone are often used to discriminate high-@xmath1 ly@xmath0emitters from possible low-@xmath1 interlopers .",
    "the example of cdfs - lab11 demonstrates that caution is required because a narrow and symmetric ly@xmath0line can also arise when the ism or cgm of a candidate galaxy is significantly photo - ionized , e.g. , by agn . on the bright side ,",
    "our v_ly@xmath3  velocity offset technique could be used for studying gas infall or outflow in high-@xmath1 qsos instead of relying on only the ly@xmath0line profile ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "exploring the origin of ly@xmath0nebulae (  blobs \" ) at high redshift requires measurements of their gas kinematics that are difficult with only the resonant , optically - thick ly@xmath0line . to define gas motions relative to the systemic velocity of the nebula",
    ", the ly@xmath0line must be compared with non - resonant lines , which are not much altered by radiative transfer effects .",
    "we made first comparison of non - resonant h@xmath0 @xmath116563to extended ly@xmath0emission for two bright ly@xmath0blobs in @xcite , concluding that , within the context of a simple radiative transfer model , the gas was static or mildly outflowing at @xmath104250kms@xmath4 .",
    "however , it was unclear if these two ly@xmath0blobs , which are the brightest in the sample , are representative of the general ly@xmath0blob population .",
    "furthermore , geometric effects  infall along filaments or bi - polar outflows  might hide bulk motions of the gas when only viewed from the two directions toward these two ly@xmath0blobs .",
    "with vlt x - shooter , we obtain optical and near - infrared spectra of six additional ly@xmath0blobs from the @xcite sample . with a total of eight ly@xmath0blobs , we investigate the gas kinematics within ly@xmath0blobs using three techniques : the ly@xmath0offset from the systemic velocity ( v_ly@xmath3 ) , the shape and shift ( @xmath50 ) of the ism metal absorption line profiles , and the breadth of the [ ] line profile .",
    "our findings are :    1 .",
    "both ly@xmath0and non - resonant lines confirm that these blobs lie at the survey redshift ( @xmath34 ) .",
    "we also detect the [ ] @xmath353727,3729 , [ ] @xmath114959 , [ ] @xmath115007 , and h@xmath14 @xmath114861lines .",
    "all non - resonant line velocities are consistent with each other and with arising from the galaxy or galaxies embedded in the ly@xmath0blob .",
    "[ ] , which is observed at high signal - to - noise in all cases and whose profile is an rt - independent constraint on the gas kinematics , is a particularly good diagnostic line for this redshift and instrument .",
    "the majority of the blobs ( 6/8 ) have broadened ly@xmath0profiles indicating radiative transfer effects .",
    "these ly@xmath0profiles are consistent with being in the same family of objects as predicted by rt , with profile shapes ranging from symmetric double - peaked , to asymmetric red peak dominated , to a single red peak .",
    "the fraction of double - peaked profiles is @xmath238% ( 3/8 ) .",
    "3 .   the narrow ly@xmath0profile systems ( cdfs - lab01a , cdfs - lab11 )",
    ", whose ly@xmath0profile is not significantly broader than the [ ] or h@xmath0lines , have the smallest v_ly@xmath3offsets , the most spatially compact ly@xmath0emission , and the only and lines detected , implying that a hard ionizing source , possibly an agn , is responsible for the lower optical depth toward the central embedded galaxies .",
    "4 .   with a combination of v_ly@xmath3 , the interstellar metal absorption line profile , and a new indicator , the spectrally - resolved [ ] line profile , we detect gas moving along the line of sight to galaxies embedded in the ly@xmath0blob center .",
    "although not all three indicators are available for all ly@xmath0blobs , the implied speeds and direction are roughly consistent for the sample , suggesting a simple picture in which the gas is stationary or slowly outflowing at a few hundred kms@xmath4from the embedded galaxies .",
    "these outflow speeds are similar to those of laes , suggesting that outflow speed is not the dominant driver of extended ly@xmath0emission .",
    "furthermore , these outflow speeds exclude models in which star formation or agn produce `` super '' or `` hyper '' winds of up to @xmath21000kms@xmath4 . + more specifically : 1 .",
    "we compare the non - resonant emission lines [ ] and h@xmath0to the ly@xmath0profile to obtain the velocity offset v_ly@xmath3 .",

    "the small v_ly@xmath3 in the ly@xmath0blobs are consistent with those measured for compact laes .",
    "2 .   by stacking low - ionization metal absorption lines",
    ", we measure the outflow velocity of neutral gas in front of the galaxies in the ly@xmath0blobs .",
    "galaxies in two ly@xmath0blobs show an outflow speed of @xmath2250kms@xmath4 , while another has an almost symmetric absorption line profile centered at @xmath50= 0kms@xmath4 , consistent with no significant bulk motion .",
    "the ism absorption line profiles here have low s / n , but are very roughly consistent with those of some lbgs ( at the level of several hundred kms@xmath4outflows ) .",
    "the high spectral resolution of our data reveals broad wings in the [ ]  profiles of four ly@xmath0blobs .",
    "this new kinematic diagnostic suggests warm ionized outflows driven by supernovae and stellar winds .",
    "these broad line components are narrower ( @xmath54 = 45  120kms@xmath4 ) and have a maximum blueshifted velocity ( @xmath65= 150  260kms@xmath4 ) smaller than those of @xmath64 star - forming galaxies ( sfgs ) , implying weaker outflows here than for lbgs and sfgs at similar redshifts .",
    "4 .   if we assume that the detected outflows are different projections of the same outflow from the ly@xmath0blob center , we can estimate the effects of flow geometry on our measurements given that our large sample size allows averaging over many lines - of - sight .",
    "the absence of any strong ( @xmath21000kms@xmath4 ) outflows among the eight galaxies tested is not a projection effect : their covering fraction is @xmath51/8 ( 13% ) .",
    "likewise , the lack of a blue - peak dominated ly@xmath0profile , at least in the direction of the embedded galaxies ( see point 6 .",
    "below ) , implies that the covering factor of any cold streams @xcite is less than 13% .",
    "the channeling of gravitational cooling radiation into ly@xmath0may not be significant over the radii probed by our techniques here .",
    "constraining the physical state of ly@xmath0-emitting gas in a ly@xmath0blob is a critical step in understanding its emission mechanism and in comparing to simulations . for one ly@xmath0blob whose ly@xmath0profile and ism metal absorption lines suggest no significant bulk motion ( cdfs - lab14 ) , at least in its cool and neutral gas , we assume a simple rt model and make the first column density measurement of gas in a embedded galaxy , finding that it is consistent with a dla .",

    "to test if two velocity components are needed to fit our spectrally - resolved [ ] profiles and to extract the line parameters , we employ the [ ] profiles with two gaussian functions using a markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) technique .",
    "we use the emcee software @xcite to sample the distributions of six parameters : line center , width , and fluxes for the two gaussian profiles .",
    "we require that ( 1 ) the line widths of both components are larger than the instrumental line width ( 31kms@xmath4 ; the vertical dotted lines in figure [ fig : o3mcmc ] ) , ( 2 ) the peak of each component should be at least 5% of the observed peak intensity , and ( 3 ) the peak of the narrow component is higher than that of the broad component . the latter two priors are imposed to prevent the mcmc chains from getting stuck in parameter spaces with extremely broad lines but with negligible fluxes .    in figure",
    "[ fig : o3mcmc ] , we show the likelihood distributions of the line widths of the two components : @xmath105 and @xmath106 .",
    "note that we exclude cdfs - lab10 in this analysis because its neighboring galaxy ( cdfs - lab10a ) makes it difficult to reliably extract its profile ( see sections [ sec : o3profile ] and [ sec : cdfs - lab10 ] ) .",
    "except for cdfs - lab11 , the likelihood distributions of the two line - widths do not overlap significantly , and the peaks of the joint 2d distributions are not located near the @xmath105 = @xmath54 line ( the dashed line ) .",
    "therefore , we conclude that the remaining four systems ( cdfs - lab06 , 07 , 13 , 14 ) are likely to consist of two components . the uncertainties of the parameters are determined from the 68.2% confidence interval of the marginalized distribution .",

    "<S> the absence of stronger outflows is not a projection effect : the covering fraction for our sample is limited to @xmath51/8 ( 13% ) . </S>",
