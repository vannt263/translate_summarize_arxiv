    "the existence of massive neutrinos is one of the main motivations for physics beyond the standard model .",
    "there are many possible theoretical frameworks where one could understand the origin of neutrino masses . in my opinion ,",
    "the simplest way to classify these scenarios is using the @xmath2 symmetry , where @xmath3 and @xmath4 stand for baryon and lepton number , respectively .",
    "now , one can have scenarios where @xmath2 is a local symmetry or scenarios where @xmath2 is not a local symmetry at the low - scale . at the same time",
    "there are several appealing ideas for physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) such as supersymmetry and grand unification which deserve our attention .",
    "then , it is important to understand the origin of neutrino masses in theories where susy is present or not , and in the context of grand unified theories , where one can understand the origin of the sm interactions and the correlation between fermion masses .",
    "it is easy to understand that combining all these ideas one finds different interesting theoretical frameworks and we should investigate the possible predictions that one could test at future neutrino experiments , at the lhc , or in the context of a grand unified theory , one should investigate the predictions for proton decay .",
    "the sm fermionic spectrum is very peculiar .",
    "we do not understand why the electron mass is much smaller than the top mass , and in general it is difficult to explain the hierarchies between the charged fermion masses .",
    "now , the neutrino is the only neutral fermion in the sm and today thanks to the effort of many experimental collaborations we know that they are massive .",
    "we believe that the explanation of the fermion hierarchies demands the existence of physics beyond the sm , and in particular since the neutrino masses are so tiny , @xmath5 ev , perhaps they are special and the mechanism needed to explain their masses is different",
    ".    in the neutrino sector one defines the so - called pmns mixing matrix , @xmath6 , where @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the different mixing angles and the dirac phase , respectively . in general",
    "there are two more free phases in the case of majorana neutrinos .",
    "thanks to all experimental collaborations one has very good constraints on the mixing angles and the mass squared difference , @xmath9 ev@xmath10 , @xmath11 ev@xmath10 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 . unfortunately , still we do not know if the spectrum for neutrinos has a normal hierarchy ( nh ) , inverted hierarchy ( ih ) or is quasi - degenerate ( qd ) .    now , let us start with the properties of the neutrinos in the standard model . as it is well - known the neutrinos are massless in the sm due to the conservation of the lepton number in each family , i.e. @xmath15 , with @xmath16 , are accidental global symmetries .",
    "in general the neutrinos can be a _",
    "dirac _ or _ majorana _ fermions . in the dirac case one has to introduce a sm singlet , @xmath17 , and the relevant interaction is given by @xmath18 where @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the leptonic doublet and the higgs , respectively .",
    "then , in this case after electroweak symmetry breaking ( ewsb ) the neutrino mass matrix reads as : @xmath21 , with @xmath22 the vacuum expectation value ( vev ) of the sm higgs .",
    "then , @xmath23 should be around @xmath24 in order to reproduce the correct neutrino mass  scale \" , @xmath25 ev .",
    "this scenario is possible , however one has to _ impose by hand _ the conservation of the total lepton number .",
    "now , if higher - dimensional operators in the sm are allowed one expects that the neutrinos are naturally majorana fermions since one finds the dimension five operator  @xcite : @xmath26 where @xmath27 , typically called as the seesaw scale , corresponds to the scale where @xmath4 is broken .",
    "after ewsb one finds that @xmath28 .",
    "now , if one assumes that the unknown coefficient @xmath29 is of order one the scale @xmath30 gev in order to reproduce the neutrino scale .",
    "then , one could think that physics needed to explain neutrino masses is connected to the idea of grand unification since the unification scale is @xmath31 gev . however , since in general the coefficient @xmath29 is a free parameter one could have the case where the scale @xmath27 is close to the electroweak scale .",
    "it is important to say that this possibility is appealing since one can hope to test directly this idea at the lhc or at future collider experiments .",
    "now , what is the origin of the operator in eq.([majorana ] ) ?",
    "there are many possible scenarios where one could understand the origin of this operator and those will be discussed in the next section .",
    "let us discuss the simplest mechanisms for generating neutrino masses at tree level and one - loop level .",
    "the simplest mechanisms at tree level are the following :    * _ _ *  @xcite : this is perhaps the simplest mechanism for generating neutrino masses . in this case one",
    "adds a sm singlet , @xmath17 , and using the interactions : @xmath32 in the limit @xmath33 one finds @xmath34 where m is typically defined by the @xmath2 breaking scale .",
    "then , one understands the smallness of the neutrino masses due to the existence of a mass scale , @xmath35 . here , again if we assume @xmath36 the scale @xmath37 gev .",
    "now , in general it is not possible to make predictions for the neutrino masses and mixing in this framework since we do not know the matrices @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "then , one should look for a theory where one could predict these quantities .",
    "* _ _ *  @xcite : in this scenario one introduces a new higgs boson , @xmath40 , which couples to the leptonic doublets and the sm higgs boson : @xmath41 and when the neutral component in @xmath42 gets a vev , @xmath43 , one finds : @xmath44 notice that if @xmath45 and @xmath46 gev the vev @xmath47 should be of order @xmath48 ev .",
    "however , in general the triplet mass can be around the tev scale and @xmath49 can be small .",
    "now , one should know the matrix @xmath38 , @xmath49 and @xmath50 in order to make predictions for neutrino mixing and masses . then , as in the previous case , one should look for a theory where one can predict these quantities .    here",
    "i can not discuss the testability of seesaw mechanisms at the lhc since this topic is beyond the scope of this talk but i would like to mention an interesting scenario .",
    "suppose that @xmath51 tev and @xmath52 gev .",
    "in this case one could produce at the lhc the doubly and singly charged higgses present in the model and through the dominant decays , @xmath53 and @xmath54 , we could learn about the neutrino spectrum . in fig . 1",
    "one can see the predictions for the branching ratios of @xmath55 versus the lightest neutrino mass  @xcite .",
    "decay branching fractions versus the lowest neutrino mass for nh ( left ) and ih ( right).,title=\"fig:\",width=264 ]   decay branching fractions versus the lowest neutrino mass for nh ( left ) and ih ( right).,title=\"fig:\",width=264 ]    notice that using the properties of the doubly charged higgs decays in each spectrum one can distinguish between nh , ih or qd .",
    "now , in the case when the majorana phases play an important role the predictions in fig .",
    "1 can change dramatically , and in order to learn about the neutrino spectrum it is better to use the singly charged higgs decays  @xcite . then , as it has been proposed in ref .",

    "here one faces the same problem , if we want to make predictions for neutrinos masses and mixings , a theory where @xmath38 and @xmath62 can be predicted is needed . in the next section",
    "we will discuss this issue in the context of grand unified theories .",
    "we have mentioned the simplest mechanisms at tree level .",
    "now , if supersymmetry is realized in nature one has the extra possibility to generate neutrino masses through the r - parity violating couplings .",
    "r - parity is defined as @xmath63 , and the r - parity violating interactions are given by @xmath64 where the last term violates b and the others break l. the problem with this possibility is that in general one has too many free parameters .",
