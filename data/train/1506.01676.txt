    "however , there are different alternative theories for the dynamical de scenarios which have been proposed to interpret the accelerating universe",
    ". one of these models , which has arisen a lot of enthusiasm recently , is hde .",

    "@xcite that in quantum field theory a short distance cutoff could be related to a long distance cutoff ( ir cutoff l ) due to the limit sets by black hole formation . if the quantum zero - point energy density is due to a short distance cutoff , then the total energy in a region of size @xmath13 should not exceed the mass of a black hole of the same size , namely @xmath14 .",

    "since in the present work we consider the late time cosmology where the de dominates , we shall assume the factor @xmath17 to be constant .    depending on the ir cutoff , @xmath13 ,",

    "interestingly enough , we found that @xmath12 provided the parameters of the model are chosen suitably .",
    "for example , for @xmath97 , @xmath155 , and @xmath100 , @xmath156 the squared sound speed is always positive during the history of the universe , and so in this case the stable de dominated universe can be achieved .",
    "this is in contrast to hde in standard cosmology , which is instable against background perturbations and so can not lead to a stable de dominated universe @xcite .",
    "this implies that the presence of the extra dimension in hde model , can bring rich physics and in particular it has an important effect on the stability of the hde model .",
    "this issue deserves further investigations",
