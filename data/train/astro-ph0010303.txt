    "ngc 6934 ( @xmath13 , @xmath14 , j2000.0 ) is an intermediate - metallicity globular cluster . in his catalog harris ( 1996 )",
    "adopted for it @xmath7}=-1.54 $ ] .",
    "the color magnitude diagrams of this cluster were obtained by harris and racine ( 1973 ) , brocato et al .",
    "( 1998 ) and piotto et al .",
    "the cluster was extensively searched for variable stars by sawyer - hogg & wehlau ( 1980 ) , who listed 51 variable stars , 50 of which were rr lyr variables . they have found mean periods for 45 rrab and 5 rrc stars equal to @xmath15days and @xmath16days , respectively .",
    "these values place ngc  6934 among oosterhoff type i clusters .",
    "observations analyzed in this paper were obtained as result of a side - survey conducted during project direct ( kaluzny et al .",
    "1998a ; stanek et al .",
    "the cluster was monitored with the 1.2  m telescope at the f.l .",
    "whipple observatory ( flwo ) , where we used `` andycam '' camera ( szentgyorgyi et al .",
    "2000 ) containing loral 2048@xmath17 back - side illuminated ccd .",
    "the pixel scale was @xmath18 , giving field of view roughly @xmath19 .",
    "the monitored field covers most of the cluster area as the tidal radius of ngc  6934 is estimated at @xmath20 ( harris 1996 ) .",
    "the data were collected from 1997 july 15 to september 23 .",
    "the cluster was observed early in the night when main targets of the direct project , m31 and m33 , were located too far east to observe .",
    "photometry of variable stars presented in this paper is based on 78 @xmath12-band images , 22 @xmath21-band images and 21 @xmath22-band images , collected during 15 nights . for",
    "almost all @xmath12-band images an exposure time was set to @xmath23sec and the median value of seeing for that filter was @xmath24 .",
    "preliminary processing of the ccd frames was done with the standard routines in the iraf ccdproc package .",
    "initially we reduced our data by extracting profile photometry with the daophot / allstar package ( stetson 1987 , 1991 ) .",
    "we followed a procedure adopted by the direct team , which is described in detail in kaluzny et al .",
    "( 1998a ) .",
    "inspection of derived data bases lead to recovery of 50 out of 51 variables listed in sawyer - hogg & wehlau ( 1980 ) .",
    "the only unrecovered variable , star v15 , was missed due to fact that its images were overexposed on most of frames .",
    "in addition we identified 27 new variables located in the cluster field .",
    "we attempted to improve quality of derived light curves by employing image subtraction package isis.v2.1 ( alard & lupton 1998 ; alard 2000 ) .",
    "it resulted not only in better quality of photometry for already identified variables but also allowed us to find six additional variable objects .",
    "we followed prescription given in the isis.v2 manual to obtain differential light curves expressed in adu units .",
    "an additional step is needed to convert isis light curves into magnitudes .",
    "this was accomplished by using daophot / allstar based profile photometry derived from individual images selected as templates ( one image for every filter ) . for every variable its total flux registered on a template image",
    "was derived based on its individual magnitude and an appropriate aperture correction for a given frame .",
    "for some variables their profile photometry turned out to be unreliable due to problems caused by crowding in the innermost part of the cluster .",
    "for these stars we decided to give up on transforming their isis based light curves into magnitude units .",
    "specifically we transformed to magnitude units only stars for which allstar returned profile photometry with @xmath25 and @xmath26 . in the following discussion",
    "we are using solely light curves based on isis results .",
    "transformation from the instrumental magnitudes to the standard @xmath27 system was accomplished based on observations of a few dozen stars from several landolt ( 1992 ) fields .",
    "these date were collected on 2 photometric nights .",
    "the following relations were adopted for the night of sep 22/23 , 1997 : @xmath28    we estimate that total uncertainties ( including uncertainty of aperture corrections ) of the zero points of cluster photometry should not exceed @xmath29mag for all three filters used .",
    "in our search for variables in ngc 6934 we have identified 85 stars .",
    "50 of them were previously known ( sawyer hogg & wehlau 1980 ) and 35 are new discoveries .",
    "all previously known variables are rr lyr stars with five objects belonging to bailey type c and 45 belonging to bailey type ab . among newly identified variables",
    "we have detected 24 rrab stars , five rrc stars , two eclipsing w uma - type stars , one sx phe star and three other objects .",
    "basic elements ( coordinates , periods , peak - to - peak @xmath12 amplitudes , intensity averaged @xmath0 magnitudes and types ) for all variables from our sample are presented in table  1 .",
    "we assigned names nv52-nv84 to the newly identified objects .",
    "transformation from rectangular coordinates returned by daophot to the equatorial coordinates was obtained based on positions of 40 stars from the usno - a2 catalog ( monet et al .",
    "1996 ) identified in our field .",
    "rectangular xy coordinates listed in table  1 are tied to the system used in the clement ( 1997 ) catalog . for variables",
    "v1-v51 we adopted periods from clement ( 1997 ) . the exception from that rule",
    "are variables v1 , v11 , v20 , v23 and v45 for which we obtained revised periods based on our data alone .",
    "these new periods produce less scattered light curves than old ones .",
    "periods for the newly identified variables nv52-nv86 , as well as for five other objects listed above , were derived using ort algorithm developed by schwarzenberg - czerny ( 1997 ) .",
    "finding charts for all variables discussed in this paper are shown in fig .  1 .",
    "each chart is @xmath30  arcsec wide with north up and east to the left . in fig .  2 we present @xmath12-band light curves for variables whose isis based photometry was transformed into magnitude units .",
    "light curves which were left in the differential counts units are shown in fig .",
    "3 .    in fig .",
    "4 we show the map of the inner part of ngc  6934 with positions of the variables marked by open circles .",
    "the dotted line marks the central part of the cluster with @xmath31  arcmin . in this circle , for clarity",
    ", we do not plot the constant stars .",
    "note that we find variable stars all the way to the center of the cluster .    in fig .",
    "5 we present a @xmath32 and @xmath33 color - magnitude diagrams derived for the field of ngc  6934 . for every filter presented photometry was obtained by averaging allstar results obtained from 5 - 11 frames . identified variable stars are marked with special symbols in fig .",
    "we note that our survey increased by almost 60% population of known rr  lyr variables in ngc  6934 .",
    "similar results were recently reported for other well studied clusters like m5 ( olech et al .",
    "1999 ) , m55 ( olech at al .",
    "1999a ) or ngc  6362 ( mazur , kaluzny & krzeminski 1999 ) .",
    "it seems that contrary to some claims ( eg .",
    "suntzeff , kinman & kraft 1991 ) , the sample of rr  lyr variables identified up to date in galactic globular clusters is significantly incomplete .",
    "the majority of variable stars identified in ngc 6934 are of rr lyr type . among them",
    "there are 10 rrc stars and 69 rrab stars .",
    "such a large ratio of rrab to rrc variables is common for oosterhoff type i globular clusters . according to smith ( 1995 ) the average ratio between the number of rrc stars and all rr lyr variables @xmath34 in oosterhoff type i clusters is equal to 0.17 and for oosterhoff type ii clusters it is equal to 0.44 . for ngc 6934",
    "we obtained @xmath35 .",
    "the periods of rrab variables from ngc 6934 are between 0.4548 and @xmath36days with the mean value of @xmath37days .",
    "periods of rrc stars are between @xmath38 and @xmath39days with the mean at @xmath40days . according to smith ( 1995 )",
    "the mean periods of rrc and rrab stars are @xmath41days and @xmath42days in oosterhoff type i clusters and @xmath43days and @xmath44days in oosterhoff type ii clusters .",
    "the values of the peak - to - peak amplitudes @xmath45 and periods @xmath46 presented in table  1 are used to plot the period - amplitude ( @xmath47 ) diagram shown in fig .",
    "open circles denote rrc stars , filled triangles rrab stars with @xmath48 ( for definition of @xmath49 see kovacs & kanbur 1998 ) and open triangles rrab variables with @xmath50 .",
    "the solid line represents a linear fit to rrab variables in m3 ( kaluzny et al .",
    "1998 ) an another oosterhoff type i globular cluster .",
    "one can see that rrab variables from ngc 6934 follow closely the linear relation for m3 .",
    "it is not surprising because both clusters have very similar metallicities .",
    "we fitted our @xmath12-band light curves with fourier sine series of the form : @xmath51 where @xmath52 . to find the values of @xmath53 , @xmath54 and @xmath55 we employed the method developed by schwarzenberg - czerny ( 1997 ) and schwarzenberg - czerny & kaluzny ( 1998 ) .",
    "the elements of the fourier decomposition of the light curves are used in the following subsections for determination of the physical parameters for rr lyr variables from ngc 6934 .",
    "it was demonstrated by simon & clement ( 1993 ) that fourier decomposition of light curves of rrc variables is a very useful technique for determining physical parameters of these stars .",
    "the equations of simon & clement ( 1993 ) are : @xmath56 @xmath57 @xmath58 @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the mass of the star in solar units , @xmath61 is the first overtone pulsation period in days , @xmath62 is the luminosity in solar units , @xmath63 is the effective temperature , @xmath64 is the relative helium abundance and @xmath65 .",
    "the phases marked by asterisk are obtained from a cosine fourier series ( used by simon & clement 1993 ) and differ from our phases which were obtained from a sine series ( cf . equation 4 ) .",
    "for @xmath66 we have @xmath67 .    from eqs .",
    "( 5)(8 ) we computed masses , luminosities , effective temperatures , relative helium abundances and absolute magnitudes of rrc stars in ngc 6934 .",
    "these are presented in table 2 together with the values of @xmath68 , @xmath69 , @xmath70 and @xmath66 .",
    "the errors presented in table 2 are calculated from the formal errors of the fourier coefficients using the error propagation law .    using the formula of kovcs ( 1998 ) we can also compute the absolute magnitude @xmath71 : @xmath72 the above equation",
    "is calibrated using luminosities derived with the baade - wesselink method .",
    "it implies relatively faint absolute magnitudes of rr lyr stars .",
    "we decided also to use the values of @xmath73 of rrc stars for computing the other way absolute visual magnitudes of rrc stars in ngc 6934 .",
    "the values of @xmath74 ( presented in the last column of table 2 ) were calculated assuming a value of 4.70 for @xmath75 of the sun and using the bolometric correction @xmath76}+0.06 $ ] adopted after sandage & cacciari ( 1990 ) .    from a sample of 10 rrc stars detected in ngc 6934 we excluded two variables for which only isis photometry is available .",
    "four out of the remaining eight stars have errors of @xmath66 larger than 0.2 and these objects were also excluded from further analysis . for the four retained objects the mean values of the mass , luminosity , effective temperature and helium abundance are @xmath77 , @xmath78 , @xmath79 , and @xmath80 , respectively .      in recent years",
    "several authors suggested that rrc stars with periods from the range @xmath81days may be in fact rre variables , i.e. rr lyrae stars pulsating in the second overtone .",
    "walker & nemec ( 1996 ) found four such candidates in the globular cluster ic 4499 .",
    "other authors ( alcock et al , 1996 ; olech 1997 ) analyzing the period distributions of rr lyr variables in lmc and in the galactic bulge found three peaks at periods 0.58 , 0.34 and 0.28 days , corresponding to the rrab , rrc and possibly to rre stars , respectively .",
    "most recently kiss et al .",
    "( 1999 ) presented the detailed study of v2109 cygni - an ultra - short , small amplitude rrc star .",
    "they concluded that it occupies different regions on the period - amplitude diagrams than other rrc stars and thus is indeed rre star . on the other hand kovcs ( 1998a ) presented some arguments against observational evidence for presence of rre stars with @xmath82days .",
    "the variable nv69 is the shortest period and lowest amplitude rr  lyr star in ngc  6934 . on the period - amplitude relation shown in fig .",
    "6 it occupies completely different location than other rrc stars .",
    "we also constructed other diagrams with @xmath83 , @xmath84 and @xmath85 relations , where @xmath86 .",
    "these relations are shown in fig .  7 , where rrc variables are plotted with open circles and rrab variables with solid triangles .",
    "solid circle denotes the variable nv69 and solid square corresponds to v2109 cygni . due to the nearly sinusoidal shape of light curves of rrc stars their phases @xmath87 and @xmath88 are often determined with low precision what leads to large uncertainties of @xmath70 and @xmath66 estimations .",
    "thus nv69 and v2109 cygni within error bars may lay close to the whole group of rrc stars in @xmath84 and @xmath85 plots . fortunately the errors of amplitudes @xmath69 and @xmath89 are relatively small and therefore we can determine @xmath90 with good precision . on the @xmath83 plot nv69 and v2109 cyg are located far away from rrc stars what supports hypothesis that they are the second overtone pulsators and belong to rre variables .    a possible argument against classifying v69 as rre variables comes from theoretical models published by bono et al . ( 1997 ) .",
    "these models predict that for periods shorter than about 0.33 days , the amplitude of pulsations observed for rrc stars should decrease with decreasing period ( the period - amplitude relation becomes parabolic ) .",
    "however , decrease of period is accompanied by increase of @xmath91 and consequently rrc stars with very small amplitudes are expected to be bluer than their counterparts with larger amplitudes .",
    "we may comment that average color ( b - v ) observed for v69 is comparable to colors of 4 other rrc stars from ngc  6934 .",
    "specifically we obtained @xmath92 equal to 0.25 , 0.28 , 0.27 and 0.28 for v11 , v26 , v46 and v53 , respectively .",
    "for v69 we measured @xmath93 .",
    "kovcs & jurcsik ( 1996 , 1997 , and references quoted therein ) have extended the fourier analysis of simon & clement ( 1993 ) into rrab stars .",
    "they derived the formulae that connect the periods , amplitudes and phases of rrab stars with their physical parameters such as absolute magnitude , metallicity , intrinsic colors and temperatures .",
    "these equations are : @xmath94 } = -5.038 - 5.394 p_0 + 1.345\\phi_{31}\\ ] ] @xmath95 @xmath96 @xmath97}\\ ] ] where @xmath98 ( cf . equation 4 ) .",
    "the above equations are valid only for rrab stars with regular light curves , i.e. variables with a deviation parameter @xmath49 smaller than 3 ( see kovcs & kanbur 1998 for definition of @xmath49 ) .",
    "table 3 summarizes the results obtained using equations ( 10)-(13 ) .",
    "this table does not contain the variable nv61 due to its poor light curve and uncertain period .",
    "the parameters such as @xmath66 , @xmath99 , @xmath74 , @xmath100 , [ fe / h ] and @xmath101}$ ] are listed only for stars with @xmath102 .",
    "the mean values of the absolute magnitude , metallicity and effective temperature for 24 stars with @xmath48 are @xmath103 , @xmath7}=-1.31\\pm 0.04 $ ] and @xmath104 , respectively .",
    "one can see that the value of [ fe / h ] derived from equation  10 differs by about @xmath105 from the value adopted by harris ( 1996 ) . on the other hand we should remember that the metallicity computed from equation ( 10 ) is in the scale of jurcsik ( 1995 ) which is connected with scale of zinn & west ( 1984 ) by the formula : @xmath94_{jurcsik } } = 1.431{\\rm [ fe / h]_{zw}}+0.880\\ ] ] and thus @xmath7}=-1.31 $ ] on the jurcsik s scale corresponds to @xmath7}=-1.53 $ ] on the zinn & west scale .",
    "therefore our final determination of metallicity of rr lyr from ngc 6934 on zinn and west ( 1984 ) scale is @xmath7}=-1.53\\pm 0.03 $ ] .",
    "this result agrees very well with the value adopted by harris ( 1996 ; @xmath106}=-1.54 $ ] ) in his catalog of globular clusters .",
    "previous determinations of reddening for ngc  6934 range from @xmath107 ( piotto et al .",
    "1999 ) to @xmath108 ( harris & racine 1973 ) .",
    "the reddening map of schlegel et al .",
    "( 1999 ) gives @xmath109 for the cluster position .",
    "we can provide an independent estimate of reddening for ngc  6934 using the method developed originally by preston ( 1964 ) and sturch ( 1966 ) . following blanco ( 1992 ) for rrab variables",
    "the interstellar reddening can be estimated from the formula : @xmath110 where @xmath111 is the observed mean color in the 0.5 - 0.8 phase interval , @xmath46 is the fundamental period and @xmath112 is preston s metallicity index .",
    "based on the globular cluster metallicity scale adopted by zinn and west ( 1984 ) suntzeff et al .",

    "for these stars we have used equation ( 15 ) and derived @xmath114 for the assumed @xmath115=-1.54 $ ] .      recent determination of distance modulus for ngc  6934 was published by piotto et al .",
    "they used an observed @xmath12 magnitude level of the zero age horizontal branch ( @xmath116 ) as a distance indicator and obtained for the cluster @xmath117 .",
    "that estimate is based on a measured value @xmath118 and an adopted @xmath119 . the value of @xmath116 obtained for ngc  6934 by piotto et al .",
    "( 1999 ) is noticeably fainter than earlier estimates available in literature .",
    "harris & racine ( 1973 ) used their photographic data to obtain @xmath120 while brocato et al .",
    "( 1996 ) listed @xmath121 based on the ccd data .",
    "to clarify this apparent discrepancy we used our photometry to derive yet another estimate of the horizontal branch level for the cluster .",
    "a histogram showing distribution of @xmath12 magnitudes for non - variable hb stars from our sample with @xmath122 ( the same color interval was used by piotto et al .",
    "( 1999 ) ) is presented in fig .",
    "the peak of that histogram is located at @xmath123 .",
    "[ fig : fourier ]    we conclude that the zero point of the hst - based photometry presented by piotto et al .",
    "( 1999 ) is shifted by about @xmath124mag relatively to three independent ground - based studies of ngc  6934 .",
    "that would imply downward revision of the distance modulus advocated by piotto et al .",
    "( 1999 ) to @xmath125 if we adopt @xmath126 as indicated by our data ( the quoted error includes only uncertainty of measured value of @xmath127 ) .",
    "an alternative way of determining the distance modulus to ngc 6934 is to compare observed magnitudes of rr  lyr stars with their absolute magnitudes .",
    "tables 2 and 3 contain values of @xmath128 derived using 3 different methods . by adopting absolute magnitudes",
    "derived for rrc stars with the kovacs calibration ( column 10th in table 2 ) one obtains @xmath129 . in case of simon & clement calibration ( last column in table 2 )",
    "we arrive at @xmath130 . finally by using absolute magnitudes derived for rrab variables with kovacs & jurcsik calibration ( table 3 ; only stars with @xmath131 are considered ) we get @xmath132 .    the most secure calibration of absolute magnitudes of rrab stars available at the moment is  in our opinion  that proposed by gould & popowski ( 1998 ) and based on the statistical - parallax method . using purely observational data they derived @xmath133 at @xmath7}=-1.60 $ ] . after correcting for a 0.01 mag offset reflecting slightly lower metallicity of the cluster we may adopt @xmath134 for rrab stars in ngv  6934 ( we used relation @xmath135}=0.18 $ ] following fernley et al .",
    "( 1997 ) ) . from our sample of cluster rrab stars we selected 24 objects with stable light curves and obtained for them an average value of @xmath136 .",
    "this in turn leads to an apparent distance modulus of the cluster @xmath137 which is very close to the value @xmath138 listed in the catalog of harris ( 1996 ) .    concluding this section we note that four out of five methods used here to estimate an apparent distance modulus of ngc  6934 give results which are consistent with each other within quoted errors .",
    "only the method based on calculation of @xmath128 for rrc stars with formulas given by simon & clement ( 1993 ) leads to a relatively larger distance modulus of the cluster . by taking an un - weighted mean of four consistent determinations we obtain @xmath139 for ngc  6934 .",
    "we have used the absolute brightness calibration for w uma - type binaries ( rucinski 2000 ) to estimate the absolute magnitudes @xmath74 for the two newly discovered contact binaries in ngc  6934 .",
    "rucinski s equation gives the relation between @xmath74 at maximum light and the period , unreddened color @xmath140 and metallicity : @xmath141 we adopted @xmath142 for both stars .",
    "the apparent distance modulus for each system was calculated as the difference between its observed @xmath143 magnitude and @xmath74 derived from equation ( 17 ) .",
    "the last column of table 4 presents the resulting values of distance modulus .",
    "both binaries are most likely the foreground variables because their estimated distance moduli are much smaller than distance modulus of ngc 6934 .",
    "a sx phe variable nv52 is located in the blue straggler region of the cluster color - magnitude diagram ( see fig .  6 ) .",
    "large peak - to - peak amplitude and asymmetrical light curve indicates that nv52 is a fundamental mode pulsator .",
    "thus we can use the relation of mcnamara ( 1997 ) connecting the absolute magnitude of the fundamental sx phe pulsators with their periods : @xmath144 the resulting absolute magnitude of nv52 is @xmath145 what leads to estimated distance modulus @xmath146 .",
    "such a value is consistent with the assumed cluster membership of the variable .",
    "the variable nv77 is a rather faint and blue object and it possibly belongs to the group of the cluster blue or yellow stragglers .",
    "it is hard to say based on our data if there is any periodicity in its light curve .",
    "the variable is located in the outer part of the cluster but that location certainly does not preclude cluster membership .",
    "observed colors suggests that nv77 may be a composite system .",
    "we note that the variable is bluer than the cluster turnoff on the v / b - v diagram while it is redder than the cluster turnoff on the v / v - i diagram .",
    "the variable nv85 is located on the red side of the cluster giant branch and about @xmath147mag below its horizontal branch ( see fig .",
    "our data are best phased with the period @xmath148days but @xmath149days is also possible .",
    "further data are needed to clarify type of variability and membership status of that star .",
    "the variable nv86 is located at the tip of the cluster red giant branch .",
    "our data indicate presence of variations with a period close to @xmath150days .",
    "the star belongs most likely to semiregular , bright variables , which are common among agb stars in globular clusters .",
    "we have presented the photometry of 85 variables in the globular cluster ngc 6934 .",
    "the photometry was obtained using the newly developed image subtraction method ( alard & lupton 1998 ; alard 2000 ) . as first demonstrated by olech et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , image subtraction method provides a very powerful tool for extracting photometry of variables located in central regions of globular clusters .",
    "as many as 35 variables from our sample are new discoveries . among these newly identified stars",
    "we have detected 24 rrab stars , 5 rrc stars , 2 eclipsing w uma systems , one sx phe star and three other variables .",
    "our total sample contains photometry for 68 rrab and 10 rrc stars .",
    "suntzeff et al .  (",
    "1991 ) estimated that only 6% of the rr  lyr variables hosted by galactic gcs remain to be discovered .",
    "the case of ngc  6934 and recent results obtained by our group for some other clusters ( m5 , m55 and ngc  6362 ) shows that incompleteness of available samples is much higher . in case of ngc  6934",
    "we have identified 29 new rr  lyr stars what amounts up to about 37% of the total sample for this cluster .",
    "the periods of rrab variables from ngc 6934 are between 0.4548 and @xmath36days with the mean value of @xmath37days",
    ". periods of rrc stars are between 0.2470 and @xmath39days with the mean at @xmath151days .",
    "only four rrc stars from our sample have the light curves with quality good enough for computing their physical parameters from the fourier decomposition coefficients .",
    "the mean values of the mass , luminosity , effective temperature and helium abundance for these rrc stars are @xmath77 , @xmath152 , @xmath153 , and @xmath154 , respectively .    out of 69 rrab variables",
    "only 24 showed stable light curves during our observations .",
    "for this sub - sample we used the method developed by kovcs & jurcsik ( 1996 , 1997 ) to derive values of the absolute magnitude , metallicity and effective temperature which are equal to @xmath103 , @xmath7}=-1.53\\pm 0.04 $ ] ( zinn - west scale ) and @xmath155 , respectively .    from the @xmath9 color at minimum light of the rrab variables we obtained the color excess to ngc 6934 equal to @xmath156 .",
    "it is marginally consistent with the recent determination of piotto et al .",
