    "the theory of shot noise in mesoscopic systems has developed along two parallel lines , one fully quantum mechanical , the other semiclassical ( see @xcite for reviews ) .",
    "the semiclassical method treats the dynamics of the electrons according to classical mechanics , but includes quantum statistical effects following from the pauli exclusion principle .",
    "the fully quantum mechanical method includes interference effects that are ignored in the semiclassical approach . both methods",
    "are expected to give identical results in the limit that the fermi wavelength goes to zero , or equivalently , in the limit that the number of scattering channels @xmath0 goes to infinity , corresponding to a conductance large compared to the conductance quantum @xmath1 .",
    "for example , in a diffusive conductor the shot - noise power @xmath2 in the limit @xmath3 ( with @xmath4 the mean current ) , and this result has been obtained both quantum mechanically ( using random - matrix theory @xcite or green functions @xcite ) and semiclassically ( using the boltzmann - langevin equation @xcite ) .",
    "another example of the correspondence principle between quantum mechanics and semiclassics in the large-@xmath0 limit is the shot noise of a double - barrier tunneling diode @xcite .",
    "the shot - noise power is the second cumulant of the charge transmitted through the conductor in a certain time . for the complete counting statistics",
    ", one needs to know the higher cumulants as well",
    ". the only existing semiclassical calculation of higher cumulants was done for the double - barrier tunneling diode @xcite , and was found to be in complete agreement with the quantum mechanical theory @xcite in the large-@xmath0 limit .    in this paper",
    "we present a semiclassical theory for the counting statistics of charge transported through a chaotic cavity , using the ` minimal correlation ' approach developed recently by sukhorukov and one of the authors @xcite .",
    "much to our surprise , we do not recover the quantum mechanical results in the large-@xmath0 limit : the fourth and higher cumulants differ .",
    "we need to introduce dephasing into the quantum mechanical theory ( by means of a voltage probe @xcite ) to obtain agreement with semiclassics .",
    "we consider a chaotic cavity ( or quantum dot ) connected to two equilibrium reservoirs by ballistic contacts ( fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] ) .",
    "( because our results do not depend on the dimensionality of the cavity we focus on the two - dimensional situation , which simplifies notation . )",
    "a voltage @xmath5 is applied between the reservoirs .",
    "the reservoirs are described by equilibrium fermi functions , which at zero temperature ( the case of interest in this paper ) have the form @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "the cross - sections of the contacts are denoted by @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "since we want to exploit the chaotic dynamics of the electron motion , we assume that there is no direct transmission between the contacts .",
    "in addition , the contacts are narrow as compared to the circumference of the cavity , but are classical in the sense that the number @xmath10 , @xmath11 of propagating modes through each contact is large .",
    "we are interested in the statistics of the charge transmitted through any of the contacts in a given time interval @xmath12 , @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the fluctuating current .",
    "we take the limit @xmath15 . for definiteness",
    ", we consider the current through the left contact , with the convention that positive current is directed towards the sample . in the long - time limit the charge transmitted through the right contact is the same , due to current conservation .",
    "the average transmitted charge gives the average current @xmath16 , and the variance of the transmitted charge gives the zero - frequency shot - noise power , @xmath17 higher cumulants of @xmath18 determine higher - order correlation functions of the current .",
    "classically , the current is expressed in terms of the distribution function @xmath19 , with @xmath20 the direction of momentum .",
    "the absolute value of the momentum @xmath21 may be regarded as a constant .",
    "the current is given by @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the outward normal to the surface of the cavity at the location of the left contact ( fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] ) , @xmath24 is a point at the cross - section of the contact , and we have abbreviated @xmath25 .",
    "the angular integral is normalized to unity , @xmath26 .",
    "electrons incident from the left reservoir ( @xmath27 ) are described by the non - fluctuating distribution function @xmath28 .",
    "( we ignore thermal fluctuations . )",
    "the distribution function of the electrons with @xmath29 carries information about the chaotic dynamics inside the cavity . on average ,",
    "it only depends on energy , since the coordinate and angular dependence averages out due to the multiple scattering from the surface of the cavity .",
    "this average distribution function inside the cavity is readily found from the condition that the current in each energy layer is conserved @xcite , @xmath30 the number of modes @xmath10 , @xmath11 is given by @xmath31 , with @xmath32 the width of the contacts .",
    "the mean transmitted charge ( [ trcharge ] ) is thus @xmath33 this result could also be obtained by series addition of the ballistic conductances @xmath34 and @xmath35 of the two contacts .",
    "fluctuations of the transmitted charge at zero temperature are entirely determined by the fluctuations of the distribution function inside the cavity .",
    "following ref.@xcite , we assume that the fluctuations of the distribution function @xmath36 inside the cavity may be decomposed into two parts , @xmath37 the function @xmath38 describes the purely ballistic motion and obeys the equation @xmath39 with @xmath40 the fermi velocity .",
    "this equation is supplemented by the expression for the equal - time correlator , @xmath41 where @xmath42 and @xmath43 is the density of states .",
    "eq.([fluct2 ] ) has the same form as in equilibrium , although the function @xmath44 describes the non - equilibrium state in the cavity .",
    "the reason is that the only source of noise at equilibrium as well as in the case of a deterministic chaotic cavity is the partial occupation of states .",
    "the uniform fluctuating term @xmath45 accounts for the fact that at long times the motion inside the cavity is not purely ballistic , and ensures the current conservation at any time in any energy interval .",
    "the fluctuations in the current due to the term @xmath46 are given by @xmath47 and similarly for @xmath48 .",
    "the condition that the current at any time in any energy interval is conserved can be used to eliminate the fluctuation in the current due to the term @xmath45 .",
    "the total fluctuation of the current is then given by @xmath49    eqs .",
