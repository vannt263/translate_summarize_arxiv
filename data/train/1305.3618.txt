    "the formation and propagation of subsurface stress - induced damage zones is of great practical interest for oil extraction , geothermal energy , and co@xmath0 sequestration ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "for all three applications , it is desirable to understand how human activities may affect permeability in the subsurface . in order to achieve this goal ,",
    "it is important to understand a complex array of interrelated factors including local geological features , the in situ stress state , and which of several modes of stress - induced failure are most likely to dominate in a given scenario .",
    "two commonly employed mechanical failure criteria are the tensile and mohr - coulomb criteria .",
    "the type of rock failure likely to occur is governed by the conditions of in situ stress and the pressure of the fluid being injected . if the injection pressure is high enough to exceed the minimum principle in situ stress , a tensile `` hydraulic fracture '' is created .",
    "walls of the fracture are pushed open by the fluid pressure creating a high permeability pathway through which the injected fluid can flow along the hydraulic fracture .",
    "the permeability of such an open fracture is commonly represented by a cubic law , where the permeability at any point in the fracture varies as the cube of the local fracture aperture and an empirically determined friction factor . published results ( @xcite ) show that the aperture , and hence the permeability , of such a hydraulic fracture varies smoothly over the majority of the fracture length , dropping sharply to a very small value near the crack tip . for examples of analytic studies of tensile fracture propagation ,",
    "see @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "rock failure can also occur at fluid pressures below the minimum principle earth stress through the mechanism of shearing .",
    "such failure is often described using the mohr - coulomb criterion ( for more detail , see @xcite ) .",
    "the determining quantity in this case is the relative magnitude of the shear stress and the effective normal stress in the rock .",
    "the effective normal stress decreases as the fluid pressure increases .",
    "when the rock fails in shear , the fractures can dilate but do not display large aperture widening as in the case of hydraulic fractures , although a significant increase in permeability does take place in the plane of failure ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the situation is more complex than that of a fracture open in tension , and there are no simple analytical expressions relating fracture geometry to permeability that are widely applicable",
    ". published results ( @xcite ) show an increase in permeability by factors up to 100 or so under shear failure .",
    "a complete analysis of the problem requires solving the coupled nonlinear equations of fluid flow , heat transfer , and mechanical deformation of the rock mass , necessitating the use of numerical models .",
    "however , useful insight into the behavior of the system can be obtained using simplified conceptual models that allow the system of governing equations to be decoupled .",
    "we solve the fluid flow problem , while incorporating the influence of the mechanical deformation and rock failure aspects implicitly through a prescribed step change in the permeability , with a low permeability for rock in an undamaged state and a higher permeability for rock that is in a fully damaged state .",
    "that is , we conceptualize the system as comprised of two zones - a zone containing the rock at pre - failure conditions and a second zone with post - failure conditions in the rock .",
    "simplification is introduced by treating rock permeability and porosity as constant within each zone , with an abrupt change in the transition zone , which we approximate as infinitely thin .",
    "further , we take the ratio of the post - failure to pre - failure permeability to be an empirically determined constant .",
    "we study two modes of failure . in the first",
    ", rock failure is driven by high fluid pressure , with a fixed specified pressure above which rock failure occurs and below which no damage occurs .",
    "we take this threshold pressure to be constant , which assumes an isothermal environment as well as an approximately uniform initial stress field . in the second case ,",
    "rock failure is driven thermally due to a large temperature difference between fluid and the surrounding medium ( see , e.g. , @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "while in this case there is no assumed threshold pressure , our analysis does assume that differences in stress between one side of a propagating damage front and the other are approximately constant in time as the front propagates .",
    "using these assumptions we derive approximate expressions for the position of the interface between damaged and undamaged regions during failure of a porous matrix induced by fluid injection .",
    "afterward , we show how to relate these expressions to the mass flow rate during constant pressure injection , which is a commonly employed observable quantity .",
    "finally , we show how our model leads to one plausible interpretation of flow rate data obtained during constant pressure injection at a site near desert peak , nevada .",
    "the following are the main contributions of this paper :    1 .",
    "the model we present can be used to predict the position of the damage front without explicitly solving the coupled equations governing stress and fluid flow .",
    "2 .   the model relates subsurface damage to mass flow rates during constant pressure fluid injection .",
    "the model includes no assumption regarding whether failure occurs as a result of tension or shear .",
    "4 .   the model is a new application of the stefan - type solution method .      in section [ stefananalogy ]",
    "we first draw an analogy with the stefan problem and present the governing equations .",
    "then we present an analytical expression for the position of , and pore pressures on either side of , a vertical damage front ; we then derive an approximate closed form expression for the position of the front in section [ frontposition1 ] .",
    "next , in section [ horizfront ] , we show that the effect of gravity is small for sufficiently small times .",
    "we then adapt our model to calculate the approximate damage front position in the case of thermally driven failure .",
    "expressions for flow rates under constant pressure injection for spherical damage front geometry are derived in section [ flowrates ] followed by comparison of the closed form solutions from our model with the field data from desert peak , nevada in section [ disc ] .",
    "consider a semi - infinite horizontal slab of fully saturated porous material with a high pore pressure , @xmath1 , maintained at the left end and such that , at all times , the pressure approaches a much lower pressure @xmath2 as @xmath3 approaches infinity .",
    "the initial pressure is @xmath2 everywhere , and material properties are initially uniform . following the discussion of last section",
    ", we assume that there is a sharp boundary separating damaged and undamaged material . at times",
    "@xmath4 a damage front will travel in the positive @xmath3 direction , and all positions to the left of the front will be in the `` damage '' zone .",
    "on the other hand , all points to right of this point will have their initial permeabilities and porosities .",
    "the permeability is clearly a function of pressure , being a higher value on the left side of the damage front than on the right side ; this pressure dependence causes the mass balance equation ( see below ) to become nonlinear .",
    "however , the constancy of material properties on either side of the damage front motivates the idea of splitting the solution domain into two halves , solving linear mass balance equations on each half , and pasting the resulting solutions together at the damage front .",
    "this situation is exactly analogous to that in the classical stefan problem ( see @xcite , @xcite ) .    in one version of the classical stefan problem ,",
    "the half plane corresponding to @xmath5 is filled with ice while that corresponding to @xmath6 is filled with liquid water .",
    "as time progresses , an ice front propagates toward positive values of @xmath3 as the ice phase removes heat from the liquid .",
    "the problem is to solve for both the temperature as a function of time and space for all @xmath6 and the position of the ice - water interface as a function of time .",
    "mathematical problems of a similar type arise in the study of systems that have moving boundaries separating regions with distinct physical properties ( for many such examples , see @xcite ) .      on each side of the damage front",
    "the permeability and porosity are taken as constants , but such that each displays a discrete jump in crossing from one side of the front to the other .",
    "the fluid on each side of the damage front therefore obeys a mass conservation equation    @xmath7    where @xmath8 is the fluid density , @xmath9 is the porosity , @xmath10 is the volumetric flux , and the subscript @xmath11 , represents the damaged or undamaged side of the front .",
    "the volumetric flux is given by darcy s law    @xmath12    where @xmath13 is the permeability , @xmath14 is the dynamic viscosity , @xmath15 is the pressure , @xmath16 is the gravitational acceleration , and @xmath17 is the vertical coordinate taken as positive upward .",
    "we include variations in the fluid density only in the unsteady term and neglect the gradient of the fluid density ( see the appendix for a detailed justification of this assumption ) . on each side of the front",
    ", the porosity and the density are related to the pressure via    @xmath18    and    @xmath19,\\ ] ]    where @xmath20 is a constant , @xmath21 is the fluid compressibility , and the subscript zero refers to initial values .",
    "the reasoning leading to ( [ porospres ] ) can be found in @xcite .",
    "the increase in @xmath9 in crossing from the undamaged to the damaged side of the front is assumed constant and equal to @xmath22 . combining ( [ massconserve1 ] ) through ( [ denspres ] )",
    ", we obtain    @xmath23    where    @xmath24    and where @xmath25 is the total compressibility ( liquid plus porous medium ) in region @xmath26 .",
    "we impose the boundary conditions    @xmath27    where @xmath28 is the position of the damage zone at time @xmath29 , @xmath30 is an abbreviation for the value of @xmath31 as @xmath32 approaches infinity , and @xmath33 is defined as the pore pressure at the damage front . for uniqueness of the solution , one more boundary condition must be imposed at the damage front . over an increment of time ,",
    "the fluid mass into the interior ( damaged ) side of the damage front must equal that out of the exterior ( undamaged ) side minus the amount of fluid taken up by an increase in pore volume due to progression of the front . requiring mass conservation across an element of area @xmath34 of damage front over a time @xmath35 thus yields the boundary condition    @xmath36    where @xmath37 is the total volume traversed by the front over @xmath35 , @xmath38 , and * n * is the unit normal to @xmath34 ( see figure [ stefancondition ] ) . in ( [ stefancond1 ] )",
    "we have neglected variations in fluid density due to progression of the damage front ; this we justify in section ( [ neglectdens ] ) . substituting ( [ volflux ] ) into ( [ stefancond1 ] ) gives the final boundary condition as    @xmath39      if the damage front is assumed to be a vertical plane , and if the fluid flux parallel to the plane of the front is negligible compared to the flux normal to the plane of damage , then ( [ massconserve2 ] ) becomes    @xmath40    and equation ( [ stefancond2 ] ) becomes    @xmath41    where the damage front is located at @xmath42 .",
    "the partial differential equation plus boundary and initial conditions given above can be solved exactly as in @xcite , pg .",
    "285 , with the substitutions @xmath43 , and @xmath44 ; however , for the conveniance of the reader we now briefly recapitulate the argument leading to a solution .",
    "scale analysis suggests that the solution to ( [ diffusionequ ] ) depends only on the dimensionless combination @xmath45 ( see @xcite ) . substituting @xmath15 as a function of @xmath45 into ( [ diffusionequ ] ) results in an ordinary differential equation that can be easily integrated to give the solution    @xmath46    where @xmath47 is the error function , defined as    @xmath48    the first two boundary conditions from ( [ boundaryconds ] ) yield    @xmath49    so that it only remains to find the constants @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    "the third of equations ( [ boundaryconds ] ) yields    @xmath52+p_l = p_d.\\ ] ]    the first and middle expressions can only be equal to the constant on the right if @xmath53 for some constant @xmath54 .",
    "substituting this expression for @xmath55 into ( [ continuity ] ) allows one to solve for both @xmath50 and @xmath51 as functions of the undetermined constant @xmath54 .",
    "application of condition ( [ stefancondhoriz ] ) then results in the equation    @xmath56    which determines @xmath54 implicitly . in general , equation ( [ implicitlambda ] ) can be solved for @xmath54 only numerically in combination with the constraints on @xmath50 and @xmath51 from equations ( [ continuity ] ) ; however , in the next section we show how to obtain an approximate closed form expression for @xmath57 .      in the absence of any damage ,",
    "i.e. , @xmath58 , the effect of the high pressure at @xmath59 is governed by ( [ diffusionequ ] ) and will travel a distance @xmath60 in time @xmath29 given approximately by the characteristic diffusive length scale    @xmath61    in fact , the form of this length scale does not depend on the problem geometry - it depends only on the fact that the relevant process is one of diffusion ( @xcite , @xcite ) . in the case of a propagating damage front , the pressure at the @xmath59 boundary has influenced that at the damage front , by definition , enough to raise the pressure there to @xmath33 .",
    "furthermore , the speed at which an effect from the high pressure boundary can propagate is limited by the lower permeability of the undamaged region as well as by increased fluid storage due to the porosity increase upon damage .",
    "therefore , the diffusive time scale for region one is short compared to that governing the movement of the damage front ; this fact implies that the pressure in region one at all times assumes approximately a linear steady - state profile with gradient    @xmath62    this approximation improves as @xmath33 approaches @xmath1 . in region two , the pressure effect from the damage front propagates to roughly the distance @xmath63 in time @xmath29 .",
    "therefore , an approximation similar to ( [ approxgradient1 ] ) , using the distance @xmath63 instead of @xmath55 , can be used to estimate @xmath64 ; the approximate pressure gradient in region two is given as    @xmath65    see figure [ 1d - pressures ] for a comparison between ( [ approxgradient1 ] ) and ( [ approxgradient2 ] ) and the exact solution slopes given by ( [ 1dstefansoln ] ) .",
    "putting ( [ approxgradient1 ] ) and ( [ approxgradient2 ] ) into ( [ stefancondhoriz ] ) leads to    @xmath66    we search for a solution of the form @xmath67 for some undetermined @xmath68 . putting this expression into ( [ approxstefancond ] ) yields    @xmath69    the only way that this equation can be satisfied for all times",
    "is for the powers of @xmath29 to equal one another ; the only value of @xmath68 for which such is the case is @xmath70 .",
    "@xmath55 therefore takes the form @xmath71 and ( [ approxstefancond ] ) becomes    @xmath72    there is only one positive root of this equation , leading to the approximate damage front position    @xmath73    table [ lambdacompare ] shows values of @xmath54 calculated from ( [ approxfrontposition ] ) and values computed numerically from equation ( [ implicitlambda ] ) via the bisection method for a wide range of permeabilities and porosities for the damaged and undamaged zones .",
    "every row in the table corresponds to @xmath74 mpa , @xmath75 mpa , @xmath76 mpa , @xmath77 pa @xmath78 s , and @xmath79 pa@xmath80 , but the results are not very sensitive to changes in these parameters .",
    "we note that the relative error with respect to the computationally derived value of @xmath54 does not exceed three percent .",
    "the largest relative errors occur when flow on the exterior side of the damage front is largest , because approximation ( [ approxgradient2 ] ) is not as good an approximation as ( [ approxgradient1 ] ) .",
    "the expression for @xmath54 can be further simplified if there is a large contrast in the porosity and permeability on crossing from one side of the damage front to the other . to affect the simplification ,",
    "we first re - write the approximate expression for @xmath54 as    @xmath81    the second term on the right side is greater than    @xmath82    so if the absolute value of the first term on the right side of ( [ approxlambda ] ) is much less than this quantity , it may be neglected .",
    "this condition may be written as    @xmath83    which is completely equivalent to    @xmath84    therefore , if ( [ approxcondition1 ] ) holds , the first term on the right side of ( [ approxlambda ] ) may be neglected . but",
    "( [ approxcondition1 ] ) is also the condition that the factor multiplying ( [ regiononeterm ] ) in equation ( [ approxlambda ] ) is approximately equal to unity .",
    "satisfaction of condition ( [ approxcondition1 ] ) therefore results in    @xmath85    condition ( [ approxcondition1 ] ) can be made more transparent by using ( [ definitiondiffuse ] ) to eliminate @xmath86 and assuming that @xmath87 .",
    "then ( [ approxcondition1 ] ) takes the form    @xmath88    hence , if the contrast in material properties between regions one and two is large enough to satisfy ( [ smallpermcond ] ) , equation ( [ simplelambda ] ) may be employed to estimate the position of the damage front as @xmath89 .",
    "equation ( [ simplelambda ] ) is the same expression that would have been obtained if flow across the damage front had been neglected in equation ( [ approxstefancond ] ) , i.e. , if the term involving @xmath64 had been neglected .",
    "therefore , condition ( [ smallpermcond ] ) is also the condition that flow across the damage front toward the lower permeability region may be neglected in determining the position of the front . as an example",
    ", if @xmath90 pa@xmath80 , @xmath91 m@xmath92 , @xmath93 pa , @xmath94 m@xmath92 , and @xmath95 , the quantity on the left hand side of ( [ smallpermcond ] ) is equal to @xmath96 .      in the previous section we assumed that the damage front is a vertical planar surface",
    "; gravity did not appear in the boundary or initial conditions because fluid flow in the vertical direction was assumed negligible compared to that in the horizontal direction .",
    "we now consider the case such that the damage front is a horizontal planar surface and vertical fluid flow dominates .",
    "the presence of gravity in the volumetric flux gives rise to a boundary condition that prevents the method of solution employed section [ vertfront ] ; however , it is still possible to derive an approximate formula for the position of the damage front .    in the present case ,",
    "equation ( [ stefancond2 ] ) becomes    @xmath97    if condition ( [ smallpermcond ] ) holds , we may neglect flow across the damage front .",
    "then , by using ( [ approxgradient1 ] ) , equation ( [ stefancondvert ] ) may be written in the form    @xmath98    this equation can not be easily integrated , but a useful solution can still be obtained by noting that the second term on the right hand side is small relative to unity when    @xmath99    for typical orders of magnitude of the quantities on the left hand side , this inequality becomes @xmath100 m. when this condition holds , we may take @xmath101 as a small parameter . the solution may then be represented as a perturbative series    @xmath102    substituting ( [ perturbseries ] ) into ( [ nonseparableequ ] ) , setting coefficients of differing powers of @xmath103 equal to zero , and neglecting powers of @xmath103 greater than unity yields the equations    @xmath104    and    @xmath105    this equation is dimensionally homogeneous because @xmath106 has dimensions of length squared , due to @xmath103 having dimensions of @xmath107length .",

    "for example , if @xmath113 m@xmath92 , the correction is small for times that are small compared to ten days .",
    "the effect of gravity is to slow the progression of an upward moving front , and this effect is more pronounced as @xmath29 , or equivalently @xmath114 , increases ( `` equivalently '' because @xmath114 is monotonically increasing in @xmath29 ) .      in spherical coordinates , the steady - state solution to ( [ massconserve2 ] ) does not have the simple linear profile employed above ; therefore , we separately derive a formula for the approximate damage front position in spherical geometry . in the steady state and in spherical coordinates with radial symmetry , equation ( [ massconserve2 ] )",
    "becomes    @xmath115    the solution to this equation is readily found to be    @xmath116    where @xmath50 and @xmath51 are constants .",
    "the pressure profiles in the damaged and undamaged zones are then approximately ( using reasoning similar to that in section [ frontposition1 ] )    @xmath117    and    @xmath118    where @xmath119 is the radius of the injection well , i.e. , @xmath120 .",
    "using these expressions , condition ( [ stefancond2 ] ) becomes    @xmath121    to affect a solution , we consider the case where @xmath122 and @xmath123 .",
    "then ( [ stefancondsphr ] ) becomes    @xmath124    which is separable and has the solution    @xmath125      when damage is driven by thermal effects rather than over - pressure , it is no longer reasonable to assume that the pressure at the damage front is approximately constant .",
    "we will now explore the consequences of letting @xmath33 vary , from @xmath126 when the front is at the injection source to @xmath127 as the front approaches infinity . the simplest assumption consistent with this behavior",
    "is that @xmath128 increases linearly with @xmath129 .",
    "that is ,    @xmath130    where @xmath131 is the distance at which @xmath132 . in the following",
    ", we will only consider the system behavior for @xmath133 . in the case of spherical geometry ,",
    "we substitute ( [ pressuredrop ] ) into ( [ stefancondsphr ] ) and again assume that @xmath122 , obtaining    @xmath134    which has the solution    @xmath135    if @xmath136 is the time at which @xmath137 , we may solve for @xmath131 in terms of this time as    @xmath138    where we have assumed that @xmath139 .",
    "figure [ frontcompare ] shows a comparison between front positions predicted via ( [ thermalsphrfront ] ) versus ( [ sphrdamage ] ) , using the parameters shown in table [ fieldcompare ] and @xmath140 .    according to this model , then",
    ", the damage front progresses much faster in the case of thermally driven damage than in the case of pressure driven damage .",
    "this behavior results from the fact that , when @xmath141 increases with time , the mass flow on the damage - side of the damage front increases with time , and this increased flow drives the front forward much more quickly than when @xmath141 is constant , as in the pressure driven case .",
    "the fluid mass flow rate measured at the ground surface as a function of time is a commonly measured quantity in applications .",
    "we first derive an expression for the flow rate in the absence of damage .",
    "afterward , we show how to obtain predicted flow rate for a spherical subsurface failure front geometry .",
    "consider the case of fluid injection at constant pressure @xmath1 into a homogeneous medium of pressure @xmath142 , and with no ensuing damage front . in this case , a pressure pulse spreads out radially from the injection point to approximately the radius @xmath143 after a passage of time @xmath29 . using ( [ sphericalgensoln ] ) , we approximate the pressure profile as    @xmath144    the pressure gradient near the injection point is thus    @xmath145    neglecting gravitational effects and integrating the volumetric fluid flux over the surface of a sphere of fixed radius @xmath119 yields the flow rate    @xmath146    therefore , the flow rate is expected to approach the constant    @xmath147    as @xmath148 .",
    "this formula also describes the flow rate for the case of `` full damage '' , i.e. , the situation that prevails after a damage front has progressed as far as possible and damage has ceased .",
    "we now consider the case of an over - pressure induced spherically shaped propagating damage front . using equation ( [ sphrpresleft ] ) to calculate the volumetric flux at the injection well and integrating this flux over the surface of a sphere with radius @xmath119 yields    @xmath149    where @xmath150 is given by equation ( [ sphrdamage ] ) .",
    "this flow rate approaches ( [ nodamageconstant ] ) as @xmath151 , regar@xmath152 where @xmath153 is the thermal diffusivity , regardless of the particular form that @xmath150 takes . in the case of thermally",
    "induced damage , substituting ( [ pressuredrop ] ) into ( [ sphereflowrate ] ) yields    @xmath154    where @xmath150 is now given by ( [ thermalsphrfront ] ) . in this case",

    "up until now we have assumed that , upon mechanical failure , the porosity increases . however , in some cases it is possible for the permeability to change by a large amount while the change in porosity is very small .",
    "it makes sense , then , to inquire into the possibility that the increase in porosity is zero or near zero ; however , our formalism must be slightly altered in this case .",
    "for example , equation ( [ approxlambda ] ) can be written    @xmath162    and in the limit @xmath161 the quadratic term vanishes .",
    "hence , the correct formula in this case is not ( [ approxlambda ] ) but    @xmath163    in the case of zero damage , i.e. , when @xmath164 , the above equation gives @xmath165 as expected .",
    "we have neglected variations in fluid density resulting from movement of the damage front , but we now show that these variations are negligible . for the same case as in section [ vertfront ] , suppose that the damage front moves from position @xmath166 to @xmath167 over a small interval of time .",
    "then the pressure at @xmath166 during this interval will have increased by amount    @xmath168    where @xmath169 .",
    "this pressure increase , by ( [ denspres ] ) , leads to an increase in density    @xmath170    hence , the discrete form of condition ( [ stefancondhoriz ] ) , when modified to include this density variation , is    @xmath171    in the limit as @xmath172 , equation ( [ stefanwithdens ] ) reduces to ( [ stefancondhoriz ] ) .",

    "@xcite have reported surface flow rate data during constant pressure subsurface injection over the course of 100 days for a site near desert peak , nv ( see figure [ chaboradatafig ] , red circles ) .",
    "most of the data was gathered within the first 16 days , with one data point at 100 days .",
    "there is an interruption in data for about 3 days starting at day 12 due to pump failure .",
    "because the resumed flow rate curve strongly resembles a continuation of the initial curve at a later time , and because the time during cessation of pumping is small relative to the thermal relaxation time of the reservoir , we align the resumed curve with the initial one as shown also in figure [ chaboradatafig ] ( a `` continuous '' curve is depicted with red circles at earlier times and blue ones at later times ) .",
    "the resulting curve would likely have resulted if the pump had not failed .",

    "on the other hand , the injection pressure was 13.1 mpa , compared to an in situ pressure of about 9 mpa ; therefore , rock failure was likely dominated by effects of thermal contraction .",
    "consequently , we employ formula ( [ sphereflowratetherm ] ) above to calculate flow rates associated with the rock failure .",
    "because we are ignoring the effect of gravity , we attempt to match only the data from the first 16 days .",
    "the flow rate is approximately constant for the first several days , and according the formulae we have developed above , such a curve suggests that damage has no yet been initiated .",

    "the transition time , @xmath176 , occurs at about five days after injection begins . if @xmath176 and @xmath35 are expressed in units of days , @xmath175 is then one inverse day , because it is a normalization factor converting time into the dimensionless time that is appropriate for the argument of an exponential function .",
    "the injection and in situ far - field pressures are constrained from observation and from the hydrostatic pressure profile , respectively .",
    "the fluid viscosity and density are determined from the average fluid pressure and temperature together with standard equations of state for pure water .",
    "the radius of the injection wellbore is known to be about @xmath178 m. for the pre - damage curve to match the flow rates at times less than five days , @xmath179 must be set equal to @xmath180 m@xmath92 . for the flow rates corresponding to rock failure ,",
    "@xmath131 is determined from equation ( [ maxdistance ] ) and noting that the observed flow rate curve appears to level off starting at about forty days , giving @xmath181 40 days ( we are here assuming that the flattening of the curve starting at around this time corresponds to a transition to cessation of damage ) .",
    "we also note that , as @xmath182 , the resulting flow rate is not very sensitive to the time chosen for @xmath136 .",
    "the predicted curve corresponding to a spherical damage front ( using ( [ sphereflowratetherm ] ) ) can only match the observed flow rates past five days if @xmath179 is set to about @xmath183 m@xmath92 - about twelve times the pre - damage permeability .",
    "if we assume that the damage front coincides at all times with some isotherm - regardless of whether the temperature transitions smoothly from one side of the damage front to the other or whether , like the damage front , it has a sharp transition - then the velocity of the damage front can be used to estimate the relative strengths of diffusive versus total ( advective plus diffusive ) heat transfer . assuming that the damage front is far from @xmath119 and differentiating equation ( [ thermalsphrfront ] ) with respect to time",
    "gives    @xmath184    the velocity of a purely diffusive temperature front is roughly    @xmath185    where @xmath153 is the thermal diffusivity . dividing [ velocdamage ] by [ diffusefront ] yields the dimensionless number    @xmath186    assuming that @xmath187 and using the values in table [ fieldcompare ] , we obtain the result that @xmath188 .",
    "hence , the model predicts that advection is very significant compared to diffusion for this system .",
    "finally we note that , although we have not included the effects of thermal expansion on the density in equation ( [ sphericalmassconserve ] ) , the error comitted is small as long as the fractional change in density is small .",
    "this is because the second term on the left side of the steady state mass balance equation    @xmath189    is small compared to the first if @xmath190 is small compared to unity . even in the present case of thermally driven damage ,",
    "the fractional change in density is only on the order of ten percent ; therefore , the error committed in neglecting the density variation is acceptable for the purposes of this study .",
    "damage induced by fluid injection modifies subsurface permeabilities and porosities , causing both to be functions of pore pressure .",
    "even though this dependence on pressure renders the mass balance equation nonlinear , we have been able to obtain a global analytic solution for the pore pressure in the case of a vertical propagating damage front front via an analogy with the classical stefan problem , where a moving surface of discontinuous material properties splits the solution domain into two parts .",
    "a formula was derived stating that gravitational effects may be ignored for sufficiently small times .",
    "we have also derived approximate expressions for the position of the damage front as a function of time , which are valid for the cases of planar and spherical propagation front geometries .",
    "these expressions show that a thermally - induced damage front propagates much faster than one induced by over - pressure , for the same values assigned to the model parameters . finally , using these expressions , we derived approximate formulae for the surface flow rates under constant pressure injection for the case of spherical damage front geometry .",
    "when compared to recorded flow rate data from a particular site near desert peak , nv , our model suggests one possible interpretation of the data is that subsurface failure began at about five days after commencement of fluid injection , transitioning from the pre - damage regime to one of spherical damage front geometry over the course of 16 days .",

    "substituting ( [ volflux ] ) , ( [ porospres ] ) , and ( [ denspres ] ) into ( [ massconserve1 ] ) yields              now consider a small vertical section of porous material of height @xmath196 over which the pressure varies by amount @xmath197 , and suppose the time variation of @xmath15 over an interval of time @xmath35 is equal to @xmath198 for some constant @xmath199 .",
    "then the first term on the left hand side is in order of magnitude              and is small compared to unity except for very large values of @xmath197 .",
    "therefore , for the parameter regime of interest in this study , the dominant balance in equation ( [ fullmassbalance ] ) is between the first and second terms on the left hand side .",
