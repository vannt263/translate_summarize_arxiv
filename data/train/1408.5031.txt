    "constantly growing needs of numerical simulations in science and engineering often require considering problems which are naturally formulated in unbounded domains .",
    "typical examples can be found in many problems originating from fluid dynamics , solid mechanics , aerodynamics , electrodynamics , acoustics , etc .",
    "however , the numerical solution of such problems requires a finite region .",
    "there are basically two approaches which can be used to reformulate problems in infinite domains as problems in finite domains .",
    "the first approach is to map the originally unbounded domain to a bounded one .",
    "simple as the problem sounds the solution in practical applications is far from known .",
    "this is mostly due to reasons which are connected with singularities of the new equation that results from the mapping .",
    "the second approach , which we follow in this work , is to impose fictitious boundaries to truncate the domain of interest .",
    "such artificial boundaries require special boundary conditions so that the boundary value problem is well - posed and its solution is an accurate approximation to the restriction of the solution in the unbounded domain . in other words ,",
    "these boundary conditions have to be transparent to or , as they are usually called , absorbing for solutions propagating outwards the artificial boundary .",
    "it is commonly recognized that absorbing boundary conditions ( abcs ) play a key role in computations on unbounded domains and have a profound impact on the accuracy of numerical methods . over the past thirty years",
    ", abcs have developed into a vigorous research direction including a wide spectrum of methods and approaches .",
    "the description of these techniques is out of the scope of this work and therefore we restrict ourselves to referring the reader to the comprehensive review articles  @xcite and the references therein .",
    "the focus of this work is on construction of abcs for high - intensity focused ultrasound ( hifu ) which plays an important role in many medical and industrial applications such as diagnostic ultrasound  @xcite , thermotherapy of tumors  @xcite , lithotripsy  @xcite , ultrasound cleaning and sonochemistry .",
    "linear models of wave propagation are not applicable in hifu due to nonlinear effects requiring more sophisticated acoustic equations to be taken into account . in this work ,",
    "we develop local in space and time abcs for the westervelt equation used as a basic acoustic model in various hifu simulations .",
    "the westervelt equation is one of the fundamental equations governing the propagation of acoustic waves in nonlinear regimes  @xcite : @xmath0 where @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 is the acoustic pressure , @xmath4 is the speed of sound , @xmath5 is the acoustic diffusivity , @xmath6 is the mass density , @xmath7 with @xmath8 standing for the parameter of nonlinearity of the fluid , @xmath9 is the final time at which the problem is to be solved .",
    "all the parameters are assumed to be constant .",
    "we rewrite in a form more convenient for further treatment @xmath10 with @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and complement by initial conditions @xmath13 and by inhomogeneous neumann and absorbing boundary conditions @xmath14 where @xmath15 , subscript @xmath16 denotes the normal derivative on the boundary , and the operator @xmath17 , on the absorbing boundary @xmath18 , is an annihilating operator for outgoing waves which we specify in due course .    in spite of the intensive research activity in the field of transparent boundary conditions ,",
    "most results have been obtained for linear problems with constant coefficients .",
    "wave equations with variable coefficients have received much less attention , not to mention nonlinear models .",
    "there are only few papers devoted to problems with variable coefficients  @xcite , convective  @xcite and nonlinear  @xcite terms . despite the existence of some approaches to the construction of abcs for nonlinear wave models",
    "their application to concrete equations is rather sophisticated and still out of the scope of most research works .    in this work",
    "we design abcs based on the theory of pseudo - differential  @xcite calculus",
    ". we will also address a possible approach via para - differential  @xcite calculus in the appendix .",
    "the first approach is applicable to linear wave equations with variable coefficients .",
    "therefore it is used for the westervelt equation linearized in a neighborhood of a reference solution .",
    "the second approach will be directly applied to the nonlinear westervelt equation . before going into detail with the derivation of abcs",
    ", we remark that both theories have been already used in the construction of transparent boundary conditions . for example",
    ", the pseudo - differential calculus was exploited by engquist and majda in  @xcite to design abcs for the linear wave equation with variable coefficients .",
    "transparent boundary conditions for the semilinear wave equation as well as for the nonlinear schrdinger equation with the help of para - differential operators were obtained in  @xcite and  @xcite , respectively .",
    "[ rem : beta0 ] the nonlinearity in the westervelt equation comes along with a strong damping term @xmath19 .",
    "in fact , this strong damping , besides being a physically imposed term , also plays a quite particular mathematical role . as already observed in @xcite , @xcite in the context of different boundary conditions , strong damping @xmath20 is essential in two and higher space dimensions in order to compensate the nonlinearity and avoid degeneracy in the equation , ( whereas in 1-d we have wellposedness also in case @xmath21 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the strong damping term destroys the wave like character of the equation since it implies decay of the energy and a rather parabolic than hyperbolic behaviour of the equation , cf .",
    "this results in the observation that the ( linearized ) differential operator defining the westervelt equation with strong damping is not amenable to a factorization ( see , e.g. , below ) as required for constructing absorbing boundary conditions . for this reason",
    ", we skip the strong damping term during derivation of the abcs .",
    "of course it has to stay in the pde , though ( for physical reasons and since otherwise wellposedness would fail , as mentioned above ) .",
    "it is clear that the inevitable use of integration by parts in deriving energy estimates for the pde causes the appearance of boundary terms resulting from the presence of the term @xmath19 .",
    "so these terms finally have to be taken into account in the abc as well . as mentioned already",
    ", the factorization approach based on pseudo- or paradifferential calculus is not appropriate for doing so .",
    "thus , incorporation of the @xmath22-term in the boundary conditions will be done as a postprocessing step after the pseudodifferential factorization , and it will be done on the basis of energy considerations . the latter will also allow to prove well - posedness of the resulting initial boundary value problems for the westervelt equation .",
    "the novelty of our work lies in the derivation and analysis of high - order abcs for the westervelt equation which have not been construct so far .",
    "we will do so for the one- and two dimensional versions of the westervelt equation  ( [ westervelt ] ) first of all in a domain without corners , see section [ sec : abcwestervelt ] .",
    "additionally , we will provide well - posedness results for the westervelt equation with zero and first order conditions in one and two space dimensions in section [ secwell ] .    in this section",
    "we summarize the boundary conditions derived in this paper together with the main well - posedness results .    for the case of one space dimension we will derive zero , @xmath23 first @xmath24 and second order abc @xmath25 ( with @xmath26 defined as in ) in section [ sec : linwestervelt_1d ] .",
    "in 2-d , the zero order abcs derived in section [ sec : linwestervelt_2d ] are @xmath27 and the first order ones are @xmath28 where subscript @xmath29 denotes the tangential derivative . here the zero order abc and the first line of the first order abc are exactly what one would expect from the linear case with constant coefficients",
    ".    note that for reasons outlined in remark [ rem : beta0 ] above we set @xmath21 in these derivations .",
    "the energy considerations in section [ subsec : beta ] will allow us to appropriately take into account the third order derivative term going with @xmath22 .",
    "with the according modifications in the abcs , , , , and denoting @xmath30 we will obtain the following local in time well - posedness results for sufficiently small initial data @xmath31 , and @xmath32    [ theo : zero1d ] for @xmath33 , any open interval @xmath34 and any @xmath35 there exists @xmath36 such that for all initial data @xmath31 satisfying @xmath37 , a solution @xmath38 to @xmath39 exists and is unique .",

    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : abcwestervelt ] we derive absorbing boundary conditions for the westervelt equation via ( formal ) pseudodifferential calculus in one and two space dimensions . section [ secwell ] is devoted to energy estimates and the proofs of theorems [ theo : zero1d][theo : first2d ] . in section [ sec : numres ] we provide numerical results .",
    "in our derivation , without loss of generality we consider the simple domains @xmath46 $ ] in 1-d and @xmath46\\times\\mathbb{r}$ ] in 2-d , where @xmath47 plays the role of the outward unit normal and ( in 2-d ) @xmath48 is the tangential direction .",
    "moreover , we will skip the term @xmath49 for the reasons outlined in remark [ rem : beta0 ] .",
    "as it was already mentioned , the direct reformulation of  ( [ westervelt ] ) in terms of pseudo - differential operators is not possible because of the nonlinear term on the right hand side .",
    "therefore we consider some linearization around a reference solution @xmath50 @xmath51 of this equation .",
    "after derivation of the abcs from this inhomogeneous linear wave equation with variable coefficients , we will re - insert @xmath52 to arrive at abcs for the westervelt equation .",
    "the reason for using ( as was also done for the wellposedness proof in @xcite ) and not the standard linearization according to first order taylor expansion , which would be @xmath53 is that the offset terms @xmath54 would lead to problems with the commutativity of the pseudodifferential operators below .    for simplicity of exposition we first of all consider the one - dimensional version of the westervelt equation  ( [ westervelt ] ) @xmath55 in 1-d the linearization reads as @xmath56 where we set @xmath57 with @xmath58 and point out that the analysis of the westervelt equation is based on estimates that actually make sure positivity of @xmath59 , so that @xmath60 is a natural assumption . in order to derive transparent boundary conditions for the linearized westervelt equation  ( [ westervelt_1d_u1 ] )",
    "we make use of the theory of pseudo - differential calculus . for the purpose of this formal derivation",
    ", @xmath61 is assumed to be a @xmath62 function both in time and space , as needed for applying pseododofferential calculus . since we do not prove this smoothess , our derivations are only formal .    the key idea behind the derivation of abcs",
    "is mostly based on the nirenberg factorization of  ( [ westervelt_1d_u1 ] ) written in terms of pseudo - differential operators . to construct approximate boundary conditions one can factorize the operator @xmath63 as @xmath64 where @xmath65 and @xmath66 are pseudo - differential operators with symbols @xmath67 and @xmath68 from the space @xmath69 the differential operator @xmath70 is defined as @xmath71 with the imaginary unit @xmath72 , and @xmath73 is a smoothing pseudo - differential operator with the schwartz kernel @xmath74",
    "satisfying  @xcite    @xmath75    developing factorization  ( [ nfact_westervelt_1d_u1 ] ) , we get @xmath76 at the symbolic level , factorization  ( [ nirfact_d1_op3 ] ) reduces to @xmath77 with the correspondence @xmath78 between the frequency and the ( physical ) time domains , and where by a slight abuse of notation , for a function @xmath79 , we denote the symbol of the zero order differential operators @xmath80 ( multiplication operator ) again by @xmath79 .",
    "now , we have to define symbols @xmath81 and @xmath82 in  ( [ nirfact_d1_sym1 ] ) .",
    "for doing so , it is worth to remark that formally these symbols admit the following asymptotic expansions    [ asympexp_ab_1d ] @xmath83 and @xmath84    where @xmath85 and @xmath86 are homogeneous of degree @xmath87 in @xmath88 . to proceed ,",
    "one has to substitute  ( [ asympexp_ab_1d ] ) in  ( [ nirfact_d1_sym1 ] ) and equate symbols of the same degree of homogeneity on both sides of equality  ( [ nirfact_d1_sym1 ] ) .",
    "however , before this substitution , we recall the reader the definition of the product of two pseudo - differential operators which are used owing to the term @xmath89 in  ( [ nirfact_d1_sym1 ] ) .    in accordance to the theorem on the product of two pseudo - differential operators  @xcite , @xmath90 and @xmath91 with symbols @xmath92 and @xmath93 respectively , a composition operator @xmath94 has the asymptotic expansion of its symbol @xmath95 given by @xmath96 for every nonnegative integer @xmath97 and with the standard multi - index notation @xmath98 and @xmath99 , @xmath100 , @xmath101 , @xmath102 and @xmath103 .",
    "thus , the symbol @xmath104 of the product of the pseudo - differential operators @xmath105 , is asymptotic to @xmath106    substitution of  ( [ asympexp_ab_1d ] ) and  ( [ pdoproduct2 ] ) in  ( [ nirfact_d1_sym1 ] ) and casting - out @xmath73 lead to @xmath107 evidently , the more coefficients are taken in  ( [ nirfact_d1_sym2 ] ) the more accurate abcs are . however , taking more coefficients also makes the abcs more complicated and involved to implement since they will contain higher order derivatives .",

    "in this section we will show well - posedness of the westervelt equation with zero or first order abc derived above in one or two space dimensions .",
    "note that zero order abc have already been considered in @xcite .",
    "however , the conditions there do not take into account the nonlinearity in the highest order time derivative .",
    "moreover , the proof in @xcite is carried out in higher space dimensions , which necessitates the use of higher order energies . in 1-d this",
    "is not required ( simply due to the fact that in 1-d already @xmath177 embeds into @xmath178 ) and the proof is on one hand much simpler , on the other hand it enables existence also of spatially less smooth solutions and well - posedness in the absence of interior damping ( i.e. , with @xmath21 ) .",
    "for these reason we will also provide the well - posedness proof for the 1-d westervelt equation with zero order abc here .    since we derive energy estimates by only multiplying with @xmath179 for zero order abc in 1-d , the strong damping term and the terms resulting from its integration by parts at the boundary will be easily tractable in that case .",

    "therefore we will modify the first order abc accordingly to account for the strong damping and arrive at decaying energies . note that in the derivations of section [ sec : abcwestervelt ] we had omitted the @xmath22 terms since they would have destroyed commutativity .",

    "i.e. , the ( formal ) nirenberg factorization from there would not have helped in obtaining energy dissipation .",
    "in fact it turns out that the abcs derived in section [ sec : abcwestervelt ] ( plus the @xmath22-modifications made here ) only allow us to show local in time well - posedness .",

    ", we will derive some energy identities ( especially we will carry over the energy identities used in the well - posedness proof for first order abcs in @xcite ) for inhomogeneous wave equations with variable coefficients and strong damping of the form @xmath180 with @xmath181 , @xmath182 @xmath183 , @xmath184 , @xmath185 and initial conditions @xmath186 , @xmath187 .",
