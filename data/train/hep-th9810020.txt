    "in the last few years , remarkable progress has been made on understanding supersymmetric gauge theories .",
    "an important part of the progress is the so - called seiberg duality @xcite , which states that two distinct supersymmetric gauge theories describe the same physics in the infrared limit . in some cases both theories are in the non - abelian coulomb phase , with scale - invariant dynamics and no particle interpretation , _",
    "i.e. , _ asymptotic states can not be defined . in two - dimensions ,",
    "there are techniques developed in conformal field theories which allow the calculation of correlation functions of conformal fields exactly , thanks to the infinite - dimensional extension of the conformal symmetry .",
    "unfortunately , much less is known about four - dimensional scale - invariant theories .",
    "we attempt to extract some physical quantities from the proposed dual supersymmetric scale - invariant theories .",
    "since there is no particle interpretation for conformal fields , one can not discuss @xmath9-matrices among quarks and gluons in these theories .",
    "this situation is somewhat similar to the real - world qcd , where quarks and gluons can not appear as asymptotic states , even though the reason for failure here is the color confinement rather than scale - invariant dynamics .",
    "the similarity suggests the study of `` @xmath1 '' cross sections , which have direct physical meaning even in the absence of the precise knowledge of the excitations in the dynamics , and are known to be useful in studies of qcd .",
    "the problem then is to develop a technique to calculate these total cross sections exactly in scale - invariant supersymmetric theories .",
    "we point out that the nsvz beta - function allows us to determine the vacuum polarization amplitudes with global symmetry current operators exactly in the infrared limit for these theories , thanks to scale invariance . by analytically continuing them to the time - like region",
    ", we obtain the exact `` @xmath1 '' cross sections even if the theory is strongly - coupled .",
    "this allows us to compare results in the electric and magnetic theories and check the duality assumption .",
    "we find that the `` @xmath1 '' cross sections indeed agree between the proposed dual theories .",
    "we then show that the agreement between the total cross sections is guaranteed by the anomaly matching condition , which was required in @xcite to determine if the two theories are dual .",
    "on the other hand , checking that both theories yield the same `` @xmath10 '' total cross sections is not enough to guarantee that the two theories in questions are dual : _ all _ physical processes have to agree in the infrared limit .",
    "we next investigate the `` @xmath11 '' and `` @xmath12 '' scattering amplitudes and , even though we are unable to compute them exactly , address the issue of their possible connection to the global anomalies .",
    "in this section , we review the consistency checks on scale - invariant theories done originally in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we do this review in order to make our discussion of the two dual theories more complete .",
    "it also serves the purpose of defining some notation and deriving some results that will be used in the remainder of this letter .",
    "we use the so - called nsvz exact beta - function of the gauge coupling constant , which is given in terms of the one - loop beta function and the anomalous dimension of the matter fields .",
    "we first determine the exact value of the anomalous dimensions in the infrared and then check that they agree with the expectation from superconformal symmetry , which relates the @xmath14 charges to the conformal weights of the chiral superfields .",
    "the nsvz exact beta - function for @xmath15 pure yang ",
    "mills theory was originally obtained heuristically by jones @xcite and also by novikov ",
    " vainshtein ",
    "zakharov @xcite using the instanton technique .",
    "it was further generalized to theories with matter fields in @xcite .",
    "all of these results can now be obtained from the rescaling anomaly @xcite .",
    "the result in @xcite is that this is the form of the beta - function one obtains in the wilsonian effective actions for canonically normalized fields with manifestly supersymmetric and holomorphic regularizations .",
    "it is even non - perturbatively exact in theories with an anomalous @xmath16 symmetry but with no condensates @xcite .. ] the nsvz beta - function relates the running of the gauge coupling constant to the anomalous dimension factor @xmath17 of the matter fields , @xmath18 which can be analytically integrated to @xmath19 where @xmath20 . here",
    ", @xmath21 is the ( half of the ) dynkin index for the adjoint representation , @xmath22 is the ultraviolet cutoff , @xmath23 the renormalization scale , @xmath24 the one - loop beta - function coefficient , @xmath25 the ( half of the ) dynkin index for the matter field @xmath26 in the representation @xmath27 , and @xmath28 is the wave - function renormalization factor at the renormalization scale @xmath23 in the wilsonian action . for @xmath29 gauge groups , @xmath30 and @xmath31 for the fundamental representation .    in the @xmath15 @xmath29 qcd ( sqcd ) , there are @xmath32 quarks @xmath33 in the fundamental representation and @xmath34 anti - quarks @xmath35 in the anti - fundamental representation .",
    "this will also be referred to as the electric theory @xcite .",
    "the one - loop beta function coefficient is therefore @xmath36 , and @xmath37 independent of the flavor .",
    "the claim in @xcite is that the theory is scale - invariant if @xmath38 . in order for the theory to be scale - invariant , the gauge coupling constant should not run .",
    "therefore the last two terms in eq .",
    "( [ eq : nsvz ] ) must cancel .",
    "that is guaranteed if @xmath39    for scale - invariance to be consistent with supersymmetry , the theory must be superconformal , which requires the conformal dimension of the chiral superfields to be given by @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is the ( non - anomalous ) @xmath14 charge . in sqcd ,",

    "( [ eq : zq ] ) . in general , the exponent of @xmath46 is @xmath47 .",
    "the conformal dimension of the matter fields determined by the vanishing nsvz beta - function is consistent with that determined by the superconformal symmetry from the @xmath14 charge .",
    "symmetries , the scale invariance does not determine the @xmath14 symmetry uniquely .",
    "we do not know the anomalous dimensions of the matter fields uniquely either . ]",
    "this consistency check was first performed by seiberg @xcite .",
    "it is instructive to discuss the case where the infrared fixed point coupling constants are perturbative @xcite .",
    "this occurs in the electric theory when @xmath32 is very close to but slightly below @xmath48 , which is possible for large @xmath49 .",
    "writing @xmath50 , we find @xmath51 this expression can be compared to the perturbative 1-loop expression @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the second - order casimir invariant for the ( anti ) fundamental representation .",
    "the required anomalous dimension is obtained with a fixed - point coupling @xcite @xmath54 up to @xmath55 corrections .",
    "note that @xmath56 is the relevant combination for large @xmath49 and @xmath57 is indeed small ( order @xmath58 ) in the limit above .",
    "this makes perturbation theory applicable in the entire energy range @xcite , and justifies the omission of @xmath55 corrections a posteriori .",
    "the coupling constant above is indeed the infrared fixed point value ; the gauge coupling constant approaches the above value in the infrared limit from either larger or smaller ultraviolet couplings .",
    "it also proves to be useful to consider limits @xmath59 ( @xmath60 ) to check some of the results we will obtain later . in this one - sided limit , requires a different analysis because the theory in this case is free . for us , it is enough to discuss the one - sided limit . ]",
    "the infrared fixed - point coupling can become arbitrarily small , and the lowest - order in perturbation theory should yield exact results .",
    "we now proceed to check that the magnetic theory is also superconformal @xcite .",
    "the magnetic theories @xcite are given by @xmath61 sqcd with @xmath62 and @xmath32 dual quarks @xmath63 and anti - quarks @xmath64 together with a meson field @xmath22 , and the superpotential @xmath65 . and assume that the meson field @xmath66 has canonical dimension one .",
    "this way , we can avoid confusion with the renormalization scale @xmath23 , and the perturbative discussion on the meson yukawa coupling @xmath67 to the dual quarks is clearer . ]",
    "the meson field @xmath66 in the magnetic theory corresponds to the gauge - invariant composite operator @xmath68 in the electric theory .",
    "the magnetic theory is claimed to describe exactly the same physics as the electric theory in the infrared limit .",
    "one implication of this is that the magnetic theory must also be scale - invariant in the infrared for @xmath69 .",
    "the same consistency check done in the electric theory can be done for the @xmath70 gauge coupling constant .",
    "the wave - function renormalization factor of the dual quarks are determined to be , in the infrared , @xmath71 such that , according to the nsvz formula eq .",
    "( [ eq : nsvz ] ) , the gauge coupling constant does not run .",
    "this wave - function renormalization factor is consistent with the conformal dimension of the dual quarks expected from their @xmath41-charge and the superconformal symmetry .",
    "it is interesting to note that the form of the anomalous dimension of @xmath33 in the electric theory and @xmath63 in the magnetic theory is the same , even though the magnetic theory also includes meson fields .",
    "an additional check is that the yukawa coupling of the meson field to the dual quarks should also not run . from the @xmath41-charge assignment of the meson field @xmath72 and superconformal symmetry ,",
    "we need @xmath73 exactly , in the infrared .",
    "one can easily check that @xmath74 , which guarantees that the yukawa coupling constant does not run : @xmath75 this consistency check follows from the requirement that the total @xmath14 charge of the superpotential is 2 , as shown below .",
    "the general formula for the exponent of @xmath46 in the wave - function renormalization factor required from the superconformal symmetry is @xmath47 , as discussed earlier .",
    "the renormalization of the coupling is then given by @xmath46 to the power @xmath76 .",
    "the superpotential has @xmath41-charge 2 , and hence @xmath77 .",
    "this guarantees the absence of running for the yukawa coupling .. the analysis here shows that the coupling is renormalized by the ratio @xmath46 with the exponent @xmath78 , and hence the operator becomes @xmath79 with the new cutoff @xmath23 .",
    "therefore , the _ dimensionless _ coupling @xmath67 also does not run .",
    "the same argument holds for higher dimensional operators in the superpotential . ]",
    "the infrared fixed point couplings are perturbative if @xmath32 is close to but slightly above @xmath80 ; in other words , @xmath81 .",
    "following the same discussion as before , the scale - invariance of the theory requires @xmath82 comparing the results above to perturbative 1-loop expressions @xmath83 one finds the fixed point couplings : @xmath84 up to @xmath85 corrections . again",
    "the omission of higher order terms is a posteriori justified when @xmath58 is small .",
    "we depicted the renormalization - group flow of the coupling constants on the @xmath86-plane for @xmath87 in fig .",
    "[ fig : flow ] . for the region shown in the plot , where both couplings are perturbative , all initial conditions flow to the fixed point in the infrared .",
    "one can also analyze the @xmath86-plane to determine the region where the magnetic theory is asymptotically free in both coupling constants . keeping only order @xmath58 terms",
    ", the renormalization group equation can be rewritten as @xmath88 where @xmath89 and @xmath90 .",
    "note that @xmath91 and @xmath92 are small ( order @xmath58 ) , according to the expressions derived above for the fixed point couplings ( the infrared fixed point is @xmath93 and @xmath94 ) .",
    "there are 2 other fixed points : @xmath95 and @xmath96 , @xmath97 .",
    "@xmath98 is both infrared and ultraviolet unstable , while @xmath99 serves as the ultraviolet fixed point ( this was mentioned briefly in @xcite ) if the couplings specified at some intermediate scale @xmath100 belong to a particular region of the @xmath86 plane .",
    "this region is indicated in fig .",
    "[ fig : flow ] . to the best of our knowledge",
    "this analysis was not done elsewhere .",
    "the form of asymptotically free region can be easily understood .",
    "first note that there are two lines in the @xmath101-plane where d@xmath102d@xmath103 and d@xmath104d@xmath103 vanish , respectively : @xmath105 and @xmath106 .",
    "it is clear that @xmath107 is the intersection of these two lines .",
    "if @xmath108 is above the second line , @xmath92 ( @xmath109 ) clearly flows to infinity in the ultraviolet , while if @xmath108 is below the first line it is @xmath91 ( @xmath67 ) that blows up in the ultraviolet .    in the region between the two lines , both d@xmath102d@xmath103 and d@xmath104d@xmath103",
    "are negative , _ i.e. , _ the infrared flow is towards _ larger _ values of @xmath101 . note that points inside of this region are confined to it when running towards the infrared .    in light of the above discussion",
    ", determining the asymptotically free region is equivalent to determining the set of points in the region above that can not be reached by outside points when flowing towards the infrared .",
    "the boundaries of this region are determined quantitatively , by looking at the infrared flow of points very close to unstable fixed points but outside the region between the two lines .",
    "it is clear from the infrared flow , for example , that @xmath110 ( where @xmath111 are infinitesimal ) can not be reached by any outside infrared flow . as a matter of fact , this point flows to @xmath99 in the ultraviolet .",
    "note that numerically this behavior is somewhat `` masked , '' and it looks as though all the infrared flow is almost horizontal until the @xmath105 line is reached .",
    "then , it appears that the flow is along that line until the infrared fixed point is reached .",
    "the reason for this is clear .",
    "note that d@xmath102d@xmath112 while d@xmath104d@xmath113 .",
    "since @xmath114 , the above numerical behavior is obvious and the asymptotic free region is well approximated by the triangle @xmath115 $ ] in the @xmath101-plane .",
    "scale - invariant theories do not admit particle interpretation for their conformal fields unless their conformal dimensions are those of free fields .",
    "even though seiberg duality states that the electric theory gives precisely the same physics as the magnetic theory in the infrared limit , it is still not clear to the authors what physical quantities can be compared between these superconformal theories .",
    "the challenge is to identify suitable physical quantities of interest and to develop techniques to calculate them exactly in the infrared limit . unlike in two - dimensional space - time ,",
    "techniques are not well developed to work out correlation functions of conformal fields in four dimensions ( see , however , @xcite ) .    historically , the study of the non - trivial gauge dynamics of qcd was done very effectively with @xmath1 experiments . here ,",
    "a global symmetry ( @xmath116 ) of qcd is gauged weakly and the gauge boson ( photon ) is produced off - shell from the @xmath1 annihilation to create excitations in qcd .",
    "we would like to follow this program to gain more insight into the scale - invariant theories and especially their equivalence .",
    "we first study the gauging of @xmath117 in sqcd , and introduce `` electrons '' which are charged under @xmath117 but not under the sqcd gauge group .",
    "we would then like to calculate the total cross section of creating excitations in sqcd from `` electron - positron '' annihilation .    at first sight",
    ", the cross sections do not appear to be the same in the electric and magnetic theories . at the tree - level",
    ", one can easily compute the drell ratio @xmath41 ( cross sections normalized by the `` point '' cross section @xmath118 where both `` electron '' and `` muon '' carry @xmath117 charge unity ) . and",
    "@xmath119 for one chiral super - multiplet ( _ i.e. _ , weyl ) rather than a full dirac multiplet .",
    "the same comment applies to the @xmath120 production , which will include entire super - multiplets .",
    "all the expressions are simpler with this definition .",
    "if one wishes to go back to the traditional definition of the `` point '' cross section for a massless dirac muon but no scalars , one should multiply our @xmath41 by a factor of 3/4 .",
    "] one finds @xmath121 in the electric theory , while @xmath122 in the magnetic theory .",
    "they clearly do not agree .",
    "of course , this is only a tree - level result and receives corrections at all orders in perturbation theory .",
    "these results are only valid in the ultraviolet limit , where asymptotic freedom allows the approximation of @xmath41 by its tree - level value . in the infrared limit ,",
    "if the two theories describe the same physics , the drell ratios must agree after corrections from all orders in perturbation theory are included .",
    "the challenge is to find a way to calculate @xmath41 in both theories exactly in the infrared limit and compare them .",
    "we describe such technique below .",
    "a similar technique was employed by anselmi _",
    "et al _ @xcite in the context of superconformal field theory .",
    "the trick is to employ the nsvz beta function for the running of the @xmath117 coupling constant , and read off the vacuum polarization function from the beta function .",
    "since the nsvz beta function sums up contributions from all orders in perturbation theory , the result on the vacuum polarization function also includes contributions from all orders .",
    "one caveat is that it depends on the anomalous dimensions @xmath17 which usually needs to be calculated in perturbation theory . in the infrared limit , however , the anomalous dimension factors for sqcd are known exactly , as discussed in the previous section , and one obtains the exact result for the vacuum polarization function",
    ". then it can be analytically continued to time - like momenta and its cut yields the cross section .    in general ,",
    "the running of a @xmath16 coupling is given by @xmath123 where the vacuum polarization amplitude does not include the @xmath16 coupling constant . ]",
    "@xmath124 depends on the euclidean momentum @xmath125 with the metric @xmath126 . comparing it to the nsvz formula eq .",
    "( [ eq : nsvz ] ) , we find @xmath127 if the functional dependence of @xmath128 on @xmath23 is known , the analytic continuation of the vacuum polarization function gives the @xmath1 cross section : @xmath129 at the squared center - of - momentum energy @xmath130 .",
    "we apply this technique to the electric and magnetic theories in the infrared limit .",
    "the first step is to calculate the running of the @xmath117 gauge coupling constant .",
    "we use the nsvz formula with the infrared exact wave - function renormalization factors derived earlier ( _ e.g. _ eq .  ( [ eq : zq ] ) ) . in the electric theory",
    ", we find @xmath131    the same calculation can be done in the magnetic theory .",
    "the dual ( anti ) quarks carry baryon number @xmath132 , while the meson field has baryon number zero .",
    "the application of the nsvz formula gives @xmath133 therefore the running of the @xmath117 coupling precisely agrees with what we obtained in the electric theory , despite quite distinct expressions at the intermediate stage of the calculations .",
    "this agreement makes the physical equivalence of the two theories much more direct and intuitive .    using the definition of the vacuum polarization function ( [ eq : pi ] )",
    ", one finds @xmath134 this is the _ exact _ result in the infrared limit @xmath135 where @xmath136 is the dynamical scale of the gauge theory . by analytically continuing @xmath137 to the time - like region ,",
    "the logarithm produces a cut , and one finds @xmath138 in the infrared limit ( @xmath139 ) . because the running of the @xmath117 coupling is precisely the same in the infrared limit for the electric and magnetic theories , this value of @xmath41 is also common for the two theories .",
    "this illustrates the equivalence of the two theories , at least in a limited fashion .",
    "it is amusing to note that the result does not depend on @xmath32 at all . from the point of view of electric theories , the result is the same for all values of @xmath32 from @xmath80 to @xmath140 . on the other hand from the point of view of the magnetic theories ,",
    "the result depends only on @xmath141 .",
    "another interesting point is that when the infrared fixed point coupling is perturbative , which happens when @xmath32 is close to but slightly less than @xmath140 in the electric theory , the exact result ( [ eq : irr ] ) and the tree - level result in the electric theory ( [ eq : uvre ] ) agree approximately .",
    "they agree exactly in the limit @xmath142 as noted earlier .",
    "the same comment applies when @xmath32 is close to but slightly above @xmath80 ; the exact result ( [ eq : irr ] ) and the tree - level result in the magnetic theory ( [ eq : uvrm ] ) agree approximately .",
    "they agree exactly in the limit @xmath143 .    for illustrative purpose , in fig .",
    "[ fig : r ] the behavior of the @xmath41 is depicted as a function of @xmath130 in both the electric and magnetic theories for @xmath32 close to but slightly less than @xmath140 . in this case",

    "we find : is approximated by the corresponding one in the space - like region with @xmath145 .",
    "this is a common assumption in high - energy @xmath1 annihilations .",

    "@xmath146 where @xmath147 .",
    "this expression smoothly interpolates the infrared and ultraviolet limits ( eqs .",
    "( [ eq : irr ] ) and ( [ eq : uvre ] ) ) given the fixed point coupling eq .",
    "( [ eq : fixed ] ) .",
    "the magnetic theory is strongly coupled ; however we calculated @xmath41 in two extreme limits : @xmath139 and @xmath148 .",
    "we do not know how the two extreme values are interpolated .",
    "some possible behaviors are illustrated in the plot .",
    "one sees a few remarkable facts in this plot .",
    "first of all , the values of @xmath41 are the same in both theories in the low - energy limit , while they differ in the high - energy limit ; this is precisely what is expected from the duality conjecture .",
    "second , the @xmath41-values `` drop '' at the dynamical scale ( this was observed , in a different context , by the authors of @xcite ) .",
    "the effect is especially prominent in the strongly coupled side ( the magnetic theory for the particular example in the plot ) .",
    "there is a plateau at the low - energy side , it goes through an interpolating region with either a smooth or wild behavior around the dynamical scale , and a new plateau sets in .",
    "the new plateau is _ lower _ than the other one .",
    "the behavior which interpolates two plateaus is reminiscent of a threshold in qcd , _",
    "e.g. _ , the @xmath149 region if it contains many bumps , or the @xmath150 threshold if it is smooth .",
    "however , thresholds in qcd always make the plateau _ higher_. the behavior in the plot appears , therefore , `` exotic '' , _",
    "i.e. _ , contrary to common intuition .",
    "the drop is , of course , due to the decrease in the gauge coupling constant from the infrared fixed - point value to the asymptotically small coupling rather than the threshold effect of exciting new degrees of freedom .",
    "the same analysis holds for the @xmath151 non - abelian gauge groups .",
    "the result in the electric theory is in the sqcd because of the @xmath152 anomaly .",
    "one needs to add new particles to the theory to cancel the anomaly .",
    "the comparison of the running coupling , however , is not affected by the presence of the additional fields thanks to the nsvz formula . ]",
    "@xmath153 in the magnetic theory , the dual quarks as well as the meson fields contribute to the running .",
    "we find @xmath154 similarly to the @xmath117 case , the running of the coupling constants precisely agree .",
    "one can introduce `` leptons '' coupled to the @xmath151 gauge group , and discuss the `` lepton anti - lepton annihilation '' experiment .",
    "the cross sections agree between the electric and magnetic theories in the limit @xmath155 .",
    "the second term in the bracket @xmath156 gives the `` hadronic '' cross section from `` lepton anti - lepton '' annihilation .",
    "note that the first term @xmath157 is related to the production of `` @xmath158 '' from the @xmath130-channel `` @xmath159-boson '' and is irrelevant for our discussion .",
    "we do not go into further details in this letter .",
    "we have seen in the previous section that the running of the gauge coupling constants for gauged global symmetries in sqcd precisely agree in the infrared limit between the electric and magnetic theories for the entire @xmath160 range , where the theories are scale - invariant .",
    "this in turn guarantees that physical quantities , such as the @xmath1 cross sections , are the same in the two theories . a natural question to address",
    "is whether the agreement of the cross sections poses a new constraint on duality or if it follows from conditions imposed in @xcite . for the original arguments for duality to be sufficient , the agreement of the cross sections should not impose any new constraints but should follow from the conditions already imposed .",
    "we indeed find that the  t hooft anomaly matching condition guarantees the agreement of the cross sections in these scale - invariant supersymmetric theories , and show why this is the case below .",
    "this was first pointed out , in a different context , in @xcite . as discussed in the previous sections ,",
    "the wave - function renormalization factors in scale - invariant theories are given by @xmath161 because of superconformal symmetry .",
    "first of all , it is interesting to check how the gauge coupling constant runs . using the nsvz formula , @xmath162 the condition that the gauge coupling constant does not run is then given by @xmath163 .",
    "this is the same condition as the requirement that @xmath14 be anomaly free under the gauge group , summetries , any linear combination of @xmath14 and the additional @xmath16s still satisfy the same condition .",
    "we can not determine the @xmath14 symmetry uniquely in this case .",
    "but the equivalence of the nsvz beta functions between electric and magnetic theories , which we will see below , still holds whatever @xmath14 is chosen .",
    "] because the @xmath14 charge of the gaugino is @xmath164 , and the fermionic component of the matter super - multiplet @xmath26 has @xmath41-charge @xmath165 .",
    "now we apply the same analysis to the gauged global symmetry .",
    "the nsvz formula is precisely the same except that @xmath166 and the group theory factors @xmath167 and @xmath168 are now those of the gauged global symmetry .",
    "the condition that the gauge coupling constant runs in the same way translates to the condition that the combination @xmath169 is the same between electric and magnetic theories , and this is nothing but the anomaly matching condition for @xmath170 , where @xmath171 is the global symmetry .",
    "it is reassuring that the  t hooft anomaly matching condition , checked in all proposed dualities , is enough to guarantee that physical observables , such as the cross sections discussed in the previous section , are the same in the infrared between the electric and magnetic theories in the superconformal window .",
    "it is noteworthy that the  t hooft anomaly matching condition is presumably not enough to guarantee the equivalence of the cross sections in two scale - invariant theories without supersymmetry , such as those proposed in @xcite . in the absence of supersymmetry",
    ", there is no reason for any one of the @xmath16 symmetries of the theory to be related to the conformal transformation .",
    "the combination @xmath172 was important in the supersymmetric theories because @xmath14 is in the same multiplet as the dilation and hence is indeed related to the dilation anomaly ( _ i.e. _ , running coupling constant ) of the @xmath171 coupling . in non - supersymmetric theories , it is quite possible that the check of ",
    "t hooft anomaly matching is far from enough to guarantee that the two theories describe the same infrared physics .",
    "the agreement of the cross sections considered here should be checked as an independent requirement for duality .",
    "we have seen that one can gauge global symmetries in sqcd and compare the running of the couplings in the electric and magnetic theories .",
    "we could furthermore calculate the `` @xmath1 '' cross sections in the infrared exactly in both theories and check that they are indeed the same . even though these examples made the physical equivalence of two theories more manifest and explicit , they are only a few out of an infinite number of physical observables",
    ". all of them must be the same in the infrared when comparing the electric and magnetic theories if these are indeed dual .",
    "it is also important to see if the agreement of all observables follows from the  t hooft anomaly matching condition or other consistency checks already done in the literature .",
    "the problem is that there are only very limited known methods of calculating other physical observables in theories with scale - invariant dynamics in four dimensions , unlike in the two dimensional case .",
    "for instance , one can try to calculate the `` light - by - light scattering '' cross sections of the @xmath117 `` photons , '' induced by loops of quarks .",
    "the effective operator @xmath173 can be defined with a suitable infrared cutoff @xmath174 . at the lowest order in perturbation theory , the coefficient @xmath175 is proportional to @xmath176 in the electric theory and @xmath177 in the magnetic theory ; they are clearly different .",
    "there is , as of today , no known powerful technique which would allow one to work out such a coefficient _ exactly _ in superconformal theories .    in this section",
    ", we will develop a very simple argument that allows one to constrain the form of @xmath175 and other related physical quantities .",
    "the hope is that these coefficients will be calculated exactly using the machinery of superconformal field theories , similar to what was accomplished in @xcite . by constraining the form of the exact answer",
    ", it might be possible to gain some insight towards performing these computations , and , hopefully , to decide if the anomaly matching condition is enough to explain the agreement of these physical observables .",
    "the argument proceeds as follows : we have already mentioned that lowest - order perturbation theory agrees with the exact answer in the limit @xmath178 for the electric theory and @xmath179 for the magnetic theory .",
    "we will use these limits to constrain the exact result .",
    "returning to the total `` @xmath180 '' cross section , the exact answer must be @xmath181 for @xmath178 and @xmath182 for @xmath179 . further requiring that the exact answer be written in terms of the global anomalies of the theory ( which are guaranteed to be the same by anomaly matching ) , an obvious candidate appears : @xmath183 .",
    "this candidate also satisfies another important constraint : the answer has to be invariant under simultaneous rescaling of the @xmath184 gauge coupling by @xmath185 and the charge assigned to individual fields by @xmath186 , that is if @xmath187 and @xmath188 physical results should remain the same .",
    "note that @xmath189 and the final answer must therefore include @xmath184 charges squared in order to guarantee this invariance .    by this sort of argumentation",
    "one can not say that the correct answer has been determined , but an acceptable candidate has certainly been found .",
    "the exact answer , which was derived from superconformal invariance and the nsvz exact beta function , in fact agrees with the naive guess above .",
    "we now turn to the amplitude of @xmath11 , and start from the same set of assumptions : ( _ i _ ) the theories yield the same coefficient in the infrared ; ( _ ii _ ) the exact result must agree with the lowest order perturbation theory in the two @xmath34 limits above ; ( _ iii _ ) these coefficients can be written in terms of the global anomalies of the theory ; ( _ iv _ ) the coefficient must be proportional to the @xmath184 charge to the fourth power .",
    "all global anomalies can be easily computed and they are @xcite @xmath190 where @xmath191 and @xmath192 ( @xmath193 are @xmath194 indices , @xmath195 are @xmath194 generators ) .    according to the assumptions above , a candidate for the exact result must be : @xmath196 where @xmath197 are arbitrary functions of @xmath198 and @xmath199 these will be referred to as the `` invariant anomalies '' , because they are not sensitive to rescalings of the @xmath184 charge assignments . note that , in order to make sense out of the @xmath194 anomalies , one has to sum over all @xmath194 indices .",
    "finally , conditions on @xmath26 , @xmath109 and @xmath200 have to imposed such that @xmath201 and @xmath202 for any value of @xmath203 , according to assumption ( _ ii _ ) .",
    "there is no linear combination of integer products of the invariant anomalies that can meet these conditions .",
    "there are , of course , less `` obvious '' candidates .",
    "note that exact infrared results , whatever they might be , are functions exclusively of @xmath203 and @xmath34 ( there are no other independent parameters in the theories ) , and it is always possible to write @xmath203 and @xmath34 in terms of a group of anomalies .",
    "one can , for example , take the @xmath204 and the @xmath205 anomalies and simply solve for @xmath203 and @xmath34 : @xmath206 having done that , it is easy to come up with a ( simple ) function of @xmath34 and @xmath203 that satisfies the conditions eqs .",
    "( [ conds ] ) .",
    "@xmath207 clearly does the job , and a candidate for the exact answer that satisfies the conditions imposed above is @xmath208 where we used eq .",
    "( [ ncnf ] ) .",
    "next we address , within the same spirit , the `` @xmath209 '' scattering amplitude generated via quark loops .",
    "the subscript @xmath210 refers to the @xmath194 group under which @xmath33 and @xmath63 transform ( @xmath35 and @xmath64 transform under @xmath211 ) . note that the coefficient of the amplitude is proportional to @xmath212 ( @xmath195 are @xmath194 generators ) , which can be written in terms of the @xmath194 tensors present in the anomalies , namely @xmath213 and @xmath214",
    "a candidate for the exact coefficient is @xmath215 the expression above can easily be written in terms of the anomalies with the help of eqs .",
    "( [ ncnf ] ) and the fact that @xmath216 note that the expression for @xmath217 in terms of anomalies only is highly non - trivial and involves , for example , inverse square - roots of polynomials of anomalies .    as one last example , we mention @xmath218 scattering .",
    "the amplitude for this process must vanish at @xmath219 and be proportional to @xmath34 ( remember that for the magnetic theory there are the meson fields that transform under both @xmath194 flavor groups ) at @xmath220 .",
    "therefore the candidate for the exact result can not be a ratio of @xmath203 and @xmath34 to arbitrary powers ( as in the previous cases ) , but has to be , for example , proportional to @xmath221 .",
    "we do not write the candidate in terms of anomalies , but it is clearly possible .",
    "note that , since it was shown that any function of @xmath203 and @xmath34 can be reexpressed in terms of anomalies ( as , for example , in eqs .",
    "( [ ncnf ] ) ) , it is always possible to write exact infrared results in terms of anomalies .",
    "it is , however , unclear whether the agreement between the electric and magnetic theories is guaranteed by the anomaly matching condition .",
    "given the expressions outlined above , it is at best nonintuitive that future superconformal field theory exact computations will yield highly non - trivial functions of the anomalies as their results , especially because the candidates are very simple functions of @xmath203 and @xmath34 .",
    "the situation outlined above should be contrasted to the `` @xmath222 '' total cross sections , described in the previous two sections .",
    "finally , it is clear that the `` candidates '' pointed out above are by no means guaranteed to be the exact answer .",
    "they agree with the exact answer in the limit when either the electric or the magnetic theory is arbitrarily weak ( @xmath223 ) , but other functions of @xmath203 and @xmath34 also have the same property .",
    "more constraints can be imposed on our candidates if one tries to analyze the superconformal theories when they are perturbative throughout the entire energy range ( @xmath224 for the electric theory ) . in this case , next order in perturbation theory can be used and , because @xmath225 and @xmath58 are related in the infrared ( see _ e.g. _ eq.([eq : fixed ] ) ) , one can compare the order @xmath225 1-loop correction to the order @xmath58 correction obtained from the candidate exact result .",
    "note that this is indeed the case for the perturbative expression for @xmath41 , eq .",
    "( [ r ] ) .",
    "such a highly non - trivial check would be a very strong indication that one has indeed found the exact infrared answer for a given observable .",
    "we do not perform the next - order ( 2-loop ) calculation for the amplitudes discussed above ; it goes beyond the scope of our letter .    in summary , we hope we have raised and addressed in a limited fashion the following question : are all ( or some ) physical observables in superconformal field theories ( in four dimensions ) related to anomalies ?",
    "if this indeed turns out to be the case , anomaly matching would be enough to guarantee the physical equivalence of two superconformal theories , which would shed light towards a `` physical '' understanding of seiberg s dualtity statements .",
    "on the other hand , if it is proven that there are physical observables which are not related to anomalies , then their exact computation would prove to be an extra duality condition .",
    "in this letter we tried to verify that seiberg s duality conjecture is indeed correct .",
    "such a check is at best non - trivial , given that one would have to perform computations in ( very ) strongly coupled theories .    to bypass this problem we have concentrated on the non - abelian coulomb phase , where both theories are superconformal and there is hope that some exact results can be obtained .",
    "the first challenge in this phase is to come up with appropriate physical observables that can be readily compared in both the electric and magnetic theories , especially because conformal theories do not , in general , allow any particle interpretation .",
    "we have described total cross sections , related to the process of gauging the global symmetries of the theories , that can be used to check the duality conjecture .",
    "some exact results were obtained and they agree between the magnetic and the electric theories .",
    "next we checked if the equality of these total cross sections poses any new duality conditions .",
    "for sqcd the anomaly matching condition is enough to guarantee that the total cross sections mentioned above are the same , thanks to superconformal invariance .",
    "we pointed out that the situation is different in non - supersymmetric dualities , and that the equalities of such cross sections should be included as an extra constraint .",
    "finally we analyzed other physical observables and tried to determine if their agreement between the electric and magnetic theories could also be explained by the anomaly matching condition .",
    "we found that that the functional form of the candidate exact result is highly non - trivial when expressed in terms of the global anomalies of the theories .",
    "it is not clear that superconformal field theory computations would yield such results .",
    "it is , therefore , possible that the exact results do not have any relation to the global anomalies of the theory , and the fact that all physical processes agree for both theories is not guaranteed by seiberg s criteria alone .",
