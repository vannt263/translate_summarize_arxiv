    "m30 ( ngc  7099 ) is one of 21 galactic globular clusters that show strong evidence of having undergone core collapse @xcite .",
    "the collapsed state of the core has been confirmed by _ hubble space telescope _",
    "( _ hst _ ) imaging @xcite .",
    "@xcite has placed an upper limit of 19 ( 0.08  pc ) on the core radius of m30 from high - resolution _ hst _  faint object camera imaging .",
    "the extraordinarily high central density of m30 , which may exceed @xmath2 , makes its core and the surrounding power - law cusp one of the highest density environments in the galaxy .",
    "a high rate of stellar interactions is expected in the core and cusp regions , resulting in blue straggler formation via stellar mergers , binary formation via tidal capture and/or 3-body interactions , and binary interactions such as exchange encounters @xcite .",
    "m30 shows some of the strongest evidence of stellar interactions seen in any globular cluster .",
    "it has a very high blue straggler frequency , a very large bluer - inward color gradient , and a large deficit of bright giants in the inner region @xcite .",
    "thus , the central region of m30 is expected to be a conducive environment for the formation of x - ray binaries .",
    "like the nearby collapsed collapsed - core globular cluster ngc  6397 , m30 does not contain any bright ( @xmath3 ) low - mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) .",
    "this opens the possibility of studying the distribution of low - luminosity sources near the center of m30 , which would be hindered by the presence of bright sources .",
    "previous rosatobservations of m30 detected low - luminosity x - ray emission from the vicinity of the core , with about 10@xmath4 positional accuracy @xcite . since this is comparable to the size of the cusp region , the rosat  detection is consistent with either a single source or a centrally concentrated source population . in order to further investigate the x - ray source population of m30 , we have obtained and analyzed a medium - depth _ chandra_-acis exposure .",
    "as expected , we detected a central population of x - ray sources .",
    "we describe the x - ray data , analysis method , and results in the following sections .",
    "we obtained a 49.4  ksec acis - s exposure of m30 on 2001 nov 11 , with the center of the cluster placed in the s3 chip .",
    "we chose the back - illuminated s3 chip for its high sensitivity and spectral resolution .",
    "the cluster center was offset by @xmath5 in the y - coordinate from the nominal acis - s aimpoint , to ensure that the half - mass region of the cluster was well covered by the chip .",
    "the location of the cluster center was approximately 25 from the nearest chip edge .",
    "we used the timed exposure mode with the faint telemetry format .",
    "the low reddening ( @xmath6 ) toward m30 results in a low neutral hydrogen column density , @xmath7 .",
    "we have adopted a distance @xmath8  kpc for m30 , based on the _ hipparcos _ results of @xcite .",
    "our adopted detection threshold of 4.5 counts , for the 49.4  ksec acis - s exposure , translates to a flux of @xmath9 in the 0.56  kev energy band , for a range of spectral models , e.g.  a 6  kev thermal plasma spectrum .",
    "this limiting flux corresponds to a luminosity of @xmath10 .",
    "we reprocessed the data from level 1 data products using the ciao 3.2 software , using current calibration files and excluding the pixel randomization that is performed in the standard processing to remove the artificial substructure introduced by the precession of the spacecraft .",
    "an exposure of 50  ksec includes a sufficient number of dither cycles ( @xmath11 ) to smooth out the substructure without additional randomization .",
    "the exclusion of randomization is expected to sharpen the image slightly , which is useful in this case because of potential source image crowding in the collapsed core region .",
    "we used the acis_run_hotpix ciao script to identify bad columns and bad pixels , and removed these as well as events not exhibiting one of the standard asca grades .",
    "we also applied time - dependent gain corrections and charge transfer inefficiency corrections where appropriate .",
    "periods of high background were searched for , but none was found .",
    "the _ chandra_-acis x - ray background is energy dependent , with a fairly sharp rise above 7  kev .",
    "figure  [ fig : acis_1024_0.3 - 7 ] shows an @xmath12 region about the cluster center , in the 0.37  kev energy band , with the cluster half - mass radius ( @xmath13 = 115 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) indicated and the detected sources labeled with the numbers from table  [ tab : sources ] .",
    "there is a strong concentration of sources about the cluster center , with a decreasing density toward the half - mass radius .",
    "figure  [ fig : acis_64_all ] shows a central 32@xmath1432  region of the acis - s image with the standard 05 binning .",
    "three bright central sources ( labeled a1 , b , and c ) are clearly visible and two additional fainter sources ( a2 and a3 ) are seen within the core .",
    "we shall refer to the brightest source in the field as source d.    the optical center of the cluster is located about 18 ( 3.6 pix ) south of the centroid of the brightest source a1 , as determined from our boresight correction ( see  [ astrometry ] ) . figure  [ fig : acis_64_lo - hi ] shows a comparison of images of the central region in low- and high - energy bands ( 0.32.5  kev versus 2.57  kev ) .",
    "note that source a1 nearly disappears in the high - energy band , indicating that it has an extremely soft spectrum . as discussed below",
    ", this provides strong evidence that it is a quiescent low - mass x - ray binary ( qlmxb ) .",
    "we used the ciao wavdetect @xcite and pwdetect @xcite utilities for detecting sources in the 0.37  kev band , after experimenting with several choices of detection bands and source detection programs .",
    "we used spatial scales of 1 , 1.4 , 2 , and 2.8 pixels for both the wavedetect and pwdetect runs .",
    "we find that pwdetect is very effective at identifying faint x - ray sources within a few arcseconds of brighter sources , but appears to identify some spurious sources and to miss real sources when applied across large fields .",
    "wavdetect appears to have a more accurate algorithm for detecting faint uncrowded x - ray sources without false detections .",
    "the source a2 ( but not a3 ) is detected in the 2.57  kev energy band ( but not in softer or broad - band images ) by wavdetect , while pwdetect detects both a2 and a3 in broad - band images .",
    "we ran pwdetect on the s3 chip , and wavdetect on a circular region with radius 45 centered on the cluster ( i.e.  extending out to @xmath15 ) .",
    "we also ran wavdetect on an image of the entire acis - s detection array ( 6 chips ) , binned by a factor of two to accommodate the increasing size of the _ chandra _  point - spread function .",
    "the reason for extending beyond the s3 chip , in both wavdetect runs , was to search for possible _ chandra _  source counterparts in the cluster halo . for each run , we choose a significance threshold designed to produce at most two false detections per image .",
    "our final source list includes the detections from the 0.37  kev wavdetect run , removing three sources that we judge spurious ( one having less than four counts and two from spurious double detections of off - axis sources ) , and adding the sources a2 and a3 identified in the pwdetect run .",
    "fifty sources were detected within 45 of the cluster center , and these sources are listed in table  [ tab : sources ] .",
    "an additional 46 sources were found on the remainder of the array , after rejecting spurious sources ; these sources will be discussed elsewhere .",
    "table  [ tab : sources ] ( located at end of text ) lists parameters for the 50 sources within 45 of the cluster center , including position , distance from the cluster center ( see  [ astrometry ] ) , counts in the 0.37 kev band , x - ray flux , x - ray color indices , and other identifiers .",
    "of these sources , 13 lie within the cluster half - mass radius and are thus the most likely candidates to be actual cluster members .",
    "source extractions were performed using the idl script acis_extract @xcite , which uses ciao and ftools tools and tara idl software .",
    "we follow the general procedures of @xcite ; we briefly discuss the method here .",
    "point - spread functions ( psfs ) were generated for each source , and polygonal extraction regions were generated to match the 90% encircled - energy contour ( at 1.5 kev ) for most sources .",
    "for a few bright sources , we chose a larger encircled energy ; for sources a1 , a2 , and a3 we chose a smaller region due to crowding .",
    "we refined the positions of all sources by iteratively centroiding the counts within the extraction regions .",
    "event lists , spectra , and light curves were extracted for each source , and response files , background spectra , and effective area files were constructed for each source using current ( caldb 3.03 ) quantum efficiency degradation corrections and the new mkacisrmf tool to generate responses .",
    "the psf fraction enclosed by the extraction regions was calculated at five energies and interpolated for other energies , and the effective area functions were altered to take account of these aperture corrections .",
    "we computed background - subtracted photometry for each source in several bands .",
    "x - ray energy fluxes for each source were derived by computing photon fluxes in seven relatively narrow bands .",
    "we computed the transformation from photon fluxes to unabsorbed energy fluxes for each band , assuming the photoelectric absorption appropriate for the distance to m30 , for two very different spectra : a 6  kev thermal plasma spectrum and a @xmath16  k hydrogen - atmosphere spectrum .",
    "the differences between the transformation coefficients were less than 4% for bands below 2 kev , and less than 7% for higher energy bands .",
    "we adopted the 6  kev thermal plasma spectrum and summed the unabsorbed energy fluxes ( and errors ) from each band to obtain the fluxes ( and errors ) presented in table  [ tab : sources ] .",
    "relatively few sources in our field exhibit clear signs of variability .",
    "a kolmogorov - smirnov test ( from acis_extract ) , which was applied to the light curve of each source , finds that only 3 of 50 sources show variability at the 99% confidence level or higher , viz.sources 37 , 39 , and 40 ( cxou j214030.86 - 231308.2 , 214033.30 - 231236.3 , and 214008.37 - 231118.9 , respectively ) ; all three are located beyond 3  from the cluster center . of these ,",
    "source 39 has a likely identification as a bright foreground star ( see   [ other_sources ] , [ other_ids ] ) .    in order to estimate the number of sources that are likely members of m30 , we computed the expected background density of extragalactic sources based on @xcite .",
    "their counts predict a background source density of @xmath17 detected above 4.5  counts in the 0.37  kev band , corresponding to a flux limit @xmath18 in the 0.56  kev band for a power - law spectrum with photon index 1.7 .",
    "[ fig : bkgd_corr ] shows the cumulative radial distribution of the excess number of sources over the background level .",
    "the cumulative excess source profile flattens at about 1 , in agreement with the expectation that the source distribution should be concentrated within the half - mass radius ( @xmath19 ) .",
    "[ fig : bkgd_corr ] indicates that the background - corrected number of cluster sources within @xmath13 is about @xmath20 , where the expected number of background sources within @xmath13 is 3.2 .",
    "( we note that the error represents the statistical uncertainty in the background correction only . ) for comparison , @xcite report the detection of a total of 7 sources within the half - mass radius of m30 to a limiting luminosity of @xmath21 ( 0.56  kev ; which corresponds to a flux limit of @xmath22 for our adopted cluster distance of 9.0  kpc ) , based on an analysis of the same chandra observations reported here .",
    "they estimate that 12 of these are background objects , using extragalactic source counts from @xcite .",
    "we note that two of our detected sources are located just inside of @xmath13 , as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : acis_1024_0.3 - 7 ] , and thus may not have been counted by @xcite .",
    "it can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : bkgd_corr ] that there is a second rise in the excess number of sources over the expected background between @xmath13 and @xmath23 .",
    "while the @xcite counts predict a total of 9.6 extragalactic sources in this region , the actual number of detected sources is 14 .",
    "this excess persists if we adopt a higher flux limit of @xmath24 ( 0.56  kev ) , for which 4.5 sources are predicted while 9 are detected .",
    "while this difference does not have a high level of statistical significance , we note that similar overdensities of sources interpreted as belonging to the background population have been seen outside the half - mass radii of other globular clusters @xcite , suggesting that some of these objects may actually be x - ray sources in the cluster halo .",
    "such sources might have been ejected into the halo from the central regions or else might naturally reside in the halo owing to their low masses .",
    "@xcite have reviewed the issue of possible cosmic variance in the extragalactic source counts , concluding that there is some evidence for significant number fluctuations below fluxes of about @xmath24 . in light of this",
    ", we also investigated by how much the background source density would have to be increased to eliminate the apparent excess of sources beyond @xmath13 .",
    "this would require that the density be increased by about 30% ( which is within the variance range discussed by * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which would increase the expected background number within @xmath13 to 4.2 .",
    "such an upward adjustment in the background count level would reduce the likely source population within @xmath13 by just one source .      as in our previous studies of globular cluster",
    "x - ray source distributions , we have analyzed the radial distribution of the likely cluster sources by fitting models to the two - dimensional source distribution using maximum - likelihood techniques ( c.f . * ? ? ?",
    "given the small sample size ( @xmath2510 sources above background within @xmath13 ) and the small optical core radius of m30 ( @xmath26 ) , we have fit a pure power - law model .",
    "we took the background level to be that given by the @xcite extragalactic source counts , as discussed in ",
    "[ source_properties ] , and use the monte - carlo procedure described in @xcite to correct for background .",
    "the best - fit power - law slope of the source surface density profile @xmath27 is @xmath28 ; the uncertainty represents the 68% range about the median value for 1000 bootstrap resamplings of the source sample .",
    "figure  [ fig : radial ] shows this fit to the cumulative source distribution , demonstrating that it provides a good fit to the profile . since m30 is a collapsed - core cluster , the relation between cusp slope and object mass presented by @xcite is appropriate ; we have previously applied this analysis to the source distribution in the collapsed - core cluster ngc  6397 @xcite .",
    "the predicted slope of a component with mass @xmath29 is , @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the mass of the component that dominates the cusp potential , for which @xmath32 .",
    "@xcite has determined a cusp slope of @xmath33 for a turnoff mass group in m30 . from this value and an assumed turnoff mass of @xmath34 from (",
    "* assuming a cluster age of 14  gyr ) , we may infer from eqn .",
    "[ eqn : cusp_slope ] that the cusp is dominated by stars with characteristic mass @xmath35 ; we interpret this as representing an admixture of massive white dwarfs and neutron stars .",
    "our measured slope of @xmath36 for the x - ray sources then implies a characteristic source mass of @xmath37 .",
    "given the range of uncertainty , this includes both cvs and lmxbs .",
    "we note that the surface - brightness profile of m30 steepens significantly from the central cusp slope beyond @xmath38 from the cluster center @xcite .",
    "thus , the measured slope for the source population within the @xmath39 half - mass radius may be best interpreted as the mean slope for the cusp and the immediately surrounding region .",
    "overall , the measured cusp slope suggests that the characteristic x - ray source mass is either comparable to or somewhat higher than that of the typical object that dominates the cusp .      in order to provide some quantification of the x - ray source spectral properties",
    ", we computed x - ray color indices following the approach of other studies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "since the majority of detected sources are expected to be nonmembers , at a large range of distance , a distance - independent color - color diagram provides a useful adjunct to a color - magnitude diagram .",

    "* ) with temperatures of @xmath46 5.9 , 6.0 , 6.1 and 6.2 .",
    "we have plotted both color and luminosity for hydrogen - atmosphere neutron star spectra in figure 6 , for an assumed 1.4  , 10 km radius neutron star at a distance of 9.0  kpc .",
    "we have also plotted the effects of increasing @xmath47 upon a power - law model of photon index 1.5 , typical of quasars or cvs that may suffer intrinsic absorption , from the cluster standard of @xmath48 to @xmath49 , @xmath50 , and @xmath51 .    as discussed in  [ spectral_analysis ] and  [ counterparts ] , we have identified a likely qlmxb ( source a1 ) and two likely cvs ( sources b and c ) .",

    "the two likely cvs , sources b and c , have similar color index values , which are considerably harder than that of source a1 and approximately consistent with a @xmath2510  kev mekal spectrum or a power law of index 1.5 .",
    "the general similarity of the colors of source a2 ( plotted as an open triangle ) to those of sources b and c ( filled triangles ) , combined with its nearly certain cluster membership , suggests that it may also be a cv .",
    "we discuss its possible positional coincidence with a moderately bright , extremely blue star in  [ source_a2 ] below .",
    "the two sources that we believe are quasars , based on their optical spectra ( see  [ other_ids ] ) , are plotted as filled squares , while source d , which appears more likely to be a quasar than a cv based on its optical spectrum ( see  [ source_d ] ) , is plotted as an open square .",
    "source d and one of the two likely quasars are indistinguishable from cvs through their x - ray colors , while the other likely quasar has a softer spectrum , suggestive of a photon index between 2 and 3 or a very low - temperature mekal spectrum .",
    "this difference in x - ray color evidently indicates a difference in the intrinsic reddening and/or the x - ray emission mechanism in these three likely quasars .",
    "we note that the fainter x - ray sources lying beyond the half - mass radius ( indicated by the star symbols without error bars in fig .

    "the similarity of the colors of likely quasars with those of likely cvs indicates that color indices alone can not be used to distinguish between these source classes .",

    "the object detected on the edge of the error circle for source 13 lies on the main sequence in both cmds .",
    "thus , this object does not appear likely to be the source 13 counterpart , despite its close proximity to the source 13 location .",
    "we attempted to determine optical counterparts for additional _ chandra _  sources listed in table  [ tab : sources ] , by comparison of the _ chandra _ , _ hst _ , and ground - based images , and then obtaining hydra spectroscopy for candidate counterparts .",
    "as noted above , the crowded conditions , even outside of the half - mass radius , proved challenging for the spectroscopic program . at both ctio and wiyn , the minimum fiber size is 2 .",
    "the goal of this effort was to determine whether any other _",
    "chandra _",
    "sources are likely to be associated with cluster objects , particularly for sources , such as d , that lie beyond the half - mass radius .",
    "any source in the cluster halo that is confirmed as a cluster member is a good candidate for having been ejected from the cluster core by an energetic binary interaction .",
    "chandra source 39 ( cxou j214033.30 - 231236.3 ) at 32 from the cluster center coincides with a bright star that is almost certainly a foreground object .",
    "this star is listed as # 1 in the photometry of @xcite and has @xmath186 , which place it at the magnitude level of the tip of the giant branch but 0.6 mag bluer in  color .",
    "the color index indicates a spectral type of approximately g2 . the x - ray to optical flux ratio of @xmath187 is within the range observed for main - sequence early g stars @xcite .",
    "the soft x - ray spectrum of this source provides additional evidence that it is a foreground star ( see  [ other_sources ] ) .",
    "the ctio and wiyn hydra spectroscopy described previously resulted in the tentative identification of three of the other chandra sources , numbers 16 , 27 , and 50 in table  [ tab : sources ] ( cxou j214016.05 - 230957.3 , 214015.01 - 231217.5 , and 214037.03 - 231337.1 , respectively ) .",
    "these objects are located at distances of 16 , 22 , and 44 respectively , from the cluster center . while the spectra of the apparent counterparts to sources 16 and 27 are blended with neighboring stars ,",
    "there are broad emission lines apparent in each of the spectra that give consistent redshifts .",
    "these lines are enhanced when a smooth continuum is fit and subtracted .",
    "for source 16 , ly-@xmath45 , @xmath1881549 , and ] @xmath1881909 give a mean redshift of @xmath189 .",
    "for source 27 , ly-@xmath45 , @xmath1881240 , + ] @xmath188 1400 , and @xmath1881549 give a mean redshift of @xmath190 .",
    "source 50 is positionally coincident with an apparent elliptical galaxy with a redshift of 0.27 , based on a detection of the mg  b triplet and the h & k break .",
    "it is not surprising that these three sources , which all lie well outside of the cluster half - mass radius , are background objects .",
    "however , this does not resolve the issue of whether a small number of the other sources near or outside of @xmath13 may actually be cluster members that were ejected from the central region .",
    "this will require additional spectroscopy , under more favorable observing conditions . the use of a long slit or slitlets would facilitate separation of objects from close neighbors .",
    "in addition to the tentative identifications just described , source 40 ( cxou j214008.37 - 231118.9 ) lies within about 1  of a @xmath191 star , located at 32 from the cluster center , that lies about 0.06 mag to the blue of the ridgeline of the giant branch in the ( @xmath136 , ) cmd of @xcite .",
    "this star is also detected by @xcite with nearly the same @xmath136 magnitude ( @xmath192 ) and a  color that is about 0.08 mag to the blue of the giant branch in the ( @xmath136 , ) cmd .",
    "examination of the object in deep @xmath155 , @xmath136 , and @xmath137 ctio 1.5 m images ( kindly provided by m.  bolte ) indicates an elongation to the northeast that becomes more prominent at shorter wavelength .",
    "this suggests that the optical object may be the superposition of a faint blue star with a much brighter giant .",
    "the separation between the two apparent objects is of order 05 .",
    "the spectra for the combined object , obtained at both ctio and wiyn , show definite emission components in the red and blue wings of the absorption line , as can be seen in figure  [ fig : ha_emission ] .",
    "this suggests that the putative blue object has a broad single - component  emission feature that overlies the absorption line of the giant .",
    "given the small offset between this apparent emission object and the much brighter giant , further spectroscopic study will require high angular resolution .",
    "if a broad  emission feature at a velocity consistent with cluster membership were confirmed , then source 40 may be consistent with being a cv that was ejected from the cluster core .",
    "we checked the positions of the eight variable stars that were identified by @xcite within the go-7379 field .",
    "we find that none of these stars is positionally coincident with a _",
    "chandra _  source .",
    "it is interesting to ask whether the observed size of the x - ray source population in m30 accords with expectation . @xcite",
    "have shown that for 12 globular clusters observed by _",
    "chandra _ , the x - ray source population size scales approximately linearly with the predicted stellar encounter rate .",
    "they interpret this as strong empirical evidence that the long - observed overabundance of exotic binaries in clusters is primarily the result of dynamical formation in the dense core regions .",
    "following @xcite , they define a normalized encounter rate @xmath193 as the volume integral to the half - mass radius of @xmath194 , where @xmath195 is the total mass density , @xmath196 is the velocity dispersion , and single - mass @xcite model structure is adopted for the radial profiles of @xmath195 and @xmath196 .",
    "most of the contribution to @xmath193 comes from the core and the immediately surrounding region ; a simple computation using an analytic king model shows that about 90% of the interactions occur within @xmath197 . as noted by @xcite , this formalism leads to the scaling @xmath198 .",
    "m30 is one of the clusters included in the @xcite sample and their estimate of its background - corrected population size of @xmath2556 _ chandra _  sources within the half - mass radius agrees well with their prediction of @xmath255 sources from their empirical @xmath199@xmath193 relation .",
    "our estimate of the background - corrected source population size is twice as large , at @xmath20 , where the error represents the uncertainty in the background correction only , as do the error bars in fig .  2 of @xcite .",
    "our background - corrected source count suggests that m30 has a source excess relative to its computed interaction rate @xmath193 , although small number statistics are clearly an issue here .",
    "somewhat surprisingly , m30 has the fourth smallest interaction rate in the @xcite sample , notwithstanding its very high central density .",
    "this is a consequence of its small core size .",
    "@xcite adopted values of core radius , central density , and central velocity dispersion from the @xcite compilation ( 2003 february online version ) ; the values for m30 are @xmath200 and @xmath201 .",
    "we note that given the collapsed - core status of m30 , these values are rather uncertain . @xcite has placed an upper limit of @xmath202 on the core radius , suggesting a preferred value of @xmath203 , and has estimated a central density of @xmath204 from dynamical modeling .",
    "these large changes in @xmath205 and @xmath206 produce partially compensating changes in the value of @xmath193 , increasing it by a factor of 1.3 for @xmath207 held fixed and by a factor of 1.7 for @xmath208 ( as for a king model ) .",
    "another source of uncertainty is that a single - mass king model does not give a good description of the collapsed - core structure of m30 .",
    "it is interesting to note that another of the three core - collapsed clusters in the @xcite sample , ngc  6397 , significantly deviates from the empirical @xmath199@xmath193 relation in the sense of having an overabundance of x - ray sources relative to the encounter rate computed from the @xcite values of core parameters , including a core radius of @xmath209 .",
    "we note that even with an hst - based analysis of the star count profile of ngc  6397 , the core radius value remains uncertain .",
    "@xcite find a best fit value of @xmath210 ( 1-@xmath211 errors ) .",
    "this uncertainty range leads to a corresponding uncertainty in @xmath193 , since @xmath212 if the central surface brightness and central velocity dispersion are fixed .",
    "given the uncertainties arising from the core - collapsed status of m30 and its consequently small core size , we suggest that its relation to the other clusters in the @xcite sample is not entirely clear .",
    "simple models for core collapse produce the scalings @xmath213 and @xmath214 @xcite . these result in @xmath215 , indicating that clusters undergoing core radius oscillations should experience episodic bursts of strongly enhanced binary formation and ejection as the core passes through its densest phases .",
    "thus , the size of the x - ray binary population in a collapsed - core cluster may undergo substantial fluctuations in time . in light of these issues , detailed dynamical simulations of the evolution of binary populations in clusters undergoing core collapse",
    "would be very helpful .",
    "our _ chandra _  acis - s imaging of the collapsed - core globular cluster m30 has detected a centrally concentrated population of x - ray sources , including six within 12  of the cluster center and three within the 19 core radius . there is a net excess of about 10 sources above background within the half - mass radius . the brightest core source ( a1 )",
    "has an x - ray flux and spectrum that are both consistent with it being a qlmxb .",
    "the other central sources ( a2 , a3 , b , and c ) all have x - ray properties consistent with being cvs .",
    "we have identified likely optical counterparts to sources b and c that are similarly consistent with a cv interpretation .",
    "while we have suggested possible counterparts to sources a1 and a2 , the status of these is uncertain and will require further investigation .",
    "sources 7 and 10 , which lie at 17  and 51  from the cluster center , respectively , have possible active binary counterparts .",
    "there remains a possibility of a significant number of additional faint sources in and near the core that lie somewhat below our detection limit of about 4.5 counts ( corresponding to to a source luminosity of @xmath216 ) .",
    "chandra _",
    "imaging would be very useful in searching for a fainter source population .",
    "our analysis of the radial distribution of the sources suggests that those belonging to the cluster are largely confined to the half - mass radius .",
    "there is some evidence for a small excess of sources over the expected background between @xmath13 and @xmath23 ; some of these may have been ejected from the central regions .",
    "the radial profile of the sources within @xmath13 implies a typical source mass of about @xmath217 , which is consistent with a variety of binary systems , including cvs .",
    "our analysis of the x - ray spectrum of source a1 indicates that it is best fit by a model for a neutron star thermally radiating through a hydrogen atmosphere , consistent with the qlmxb interpretation .",
    "while the spectral modeling does not provide tight constraints on the neutron star mass and radius , it does demonstrate consistency with standard neutron star structure models .    our effort to identify additional sources using ground - based optical spectroscopy with the ctio and wiyn hydra multiobject spectrographs demonstrated that two of the sources beyond the half - mass radius are quasars .",
    "the optical spectrum of source d , the brightest source in the field , shows no evidence for  emission , while it does show a possible redshifted emission line .",
    "thus it is more likely consistent with a background agn than with a cluster cv .",
    "the spectroscopy did identify an object , also located beyond the half - mass radius , that shows  emission wings about an absorption line .",
    "this object appears to be the superposition of two stars that are not well resolved by ground - based imaging and are outside of the field of hst imaging .",
    "further investigation of this intriguing object is clearly warranted .",
    "the core - collapsed status of m30 complicates a comparison of its _ chandra _  source population size @xmath199 with the empirical relation between @xmath199 and collision rate @xmath193 established for other clusters .",
    "while the observed population of about 10 sources above background within the half - mass radius is twice as large as the prediction of the relation , the determination of an appropriate @xmath193 value for m30 is challenging given its very small core size and strong deviation from king - model structure in the inner region .",
    "a deeper x - ray luminosity function and detailed modeling of source population evolution in a collapsed - core cluster would facilitate further investigation of this issue .",
