    "motivated by the hierarchy problem , the hypothesis of large extra dimensions @xcite ( led ) is that there may exist @xmath0 compactified extra dimensions so that the einstein - hilbert action of general relativity ( gr ) becomes : @xmath1 where @xmath2 . integrating out these extra dimensions",
    "one obtains : @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the size of the extra dimensions in the simplest case of toroidal compactification .",
    "this means that if the volume of the compactified extra dimensions is large in tev units , then the scale @xmath5 at which quantum gravity ( qg ) should manifest itself is much lower then the usual planck scale @xmath6 .    the important point ( see @xcite@xcite for a review )",
    "is that , if we assume that only gravity can propagate in the @xmath0 extra dimensions , then observable effects are to be expected only in high energy physics and in deviations from the newtonian potential at distances smaller than @xmath4 .",
    "for example setting @xmath7 tev we have @xmath8 .",
    "since the experimental data impose @xmath9 mm , we immediatly see that : @xmath10 is a serious possibility . on the other hand in high energy physics",
    "the processes of phenomenological interest are elastic scattering , for example @xmath11 at the lhc @xcite or @xmath12 for the physics of cosmic rays @xcite , and black hole creation , which however is model dependent ( see @xcite for a brief overall review ) .",
    "we will consider elastic scattering , which can be nicely computed in the eikonal regime , leaving out black hole creation over which there are serious theoretical uncertainties .",
    "defining the @xmath13-dimensional newton constant as @xmath14 , the relevant length scales are : @xmath15^{\\frac{1}{n+1}}\\ ] ] where @xmath16 is the de broglie wavelength , @xmath17 is the planck scale ( at which qg appears ) , and @xmath18 is the schwarzschild radius ( at which curvature effects become large ) .",
    "it is important to notice that in this @xmath13-dimensional framework we also have the length scale : @xmath19 which can not be defined if @xmath20 and moreover it goes to infinity if @xmath21 with @xmath22 fixed .",
    "we can thus say that @xmath23 is related to the size of the classical region in the impact parameter space .    since the true theory of qg is not known , we are interested in model independent predictions .",
    "first of all let us assume that @xmath24 , which is certainly true at sufficiently high energy .",
    "notice that for impact parameter @xmath25 gravity can be linearized .",
    "moreover if @xmath26 then @xmath27 , which means that qg effects are expected to be small",
    ". finally , in the case of forward scattering at small angles , we are able to perform a predictive computation using the eikonal resummation or the shock - wave method , as we will see in the following . in conclusion , in the transplanckian eikonal regime defined by : @xmath28 it is possible to obtain a neat and model independent prediction which relies only on quantum mechanics ( qm ) and linearized gr .",
    "notice that all this can be of phenomenological interest only in a led scenario with the qg scale @xmath5 lowered down to a few tev .",
    "as shown in @xcite and @xcite , a first approach for the evaluation of the transplanckian amplitude at small angles is the so - called `` eikonalization '' , which amounts to resum an infinite number of feynman diagrams with graviton exchanges which are one by one ultraviolet ( uv ) divergent but whose sum is finite and independent of the regulator . in performing this sum one neglects the virtuality of gravitons in the matter propagators and makes use of the on - shell vertices .",
    "the final result is : @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the momentum transfer , which is mainly transverse ( @xmath31 ) , and : @xmath32 notice that this amplitude is spin independent and moreover there is no uv sensitivity .",
    "this means that in this regime we can obtain a prediction in perturbative qg which does not depend on the details of the uv completion .",
    "however , as we said , this prediction relies only on qm and gr , and thus it should be computable without passing through feynman diagrams .",
    "this is realized in a different approach which is due to t hooft @xcite .",
    "the idea is to replace one of the two particles with its gravitational field , and then to solve the equations of motion ( eom ) for the other particle in this background .",
    "the solution of the einstein equations for a very energetic particle is the aichelburg - sexl shock wave ( sw ) metric @xcite : @xmath33 where the particle is moving in the positive @xmath34 direction , while : @xmath35 and we have generalized the sw to the case of @xmath36 extra dimensions . all one has to do is to solve the klein gordon equation in this background ( we consider a scalar particle for simplicity ) . a fast way to do",
    "this @xcite is to perform a discontinuous coordinate transformation @xmath37 in order to make the metric continuous across @xmath38 . at @xmath39",
    "we have : @xmath40{l}% x^{+}=x^{\\prime+}+\\theta(x^{-})\\ , \\phi(x_{\\perp } ) \\\\",
    "x^{i}=x^{\\prime i } \\qquad ( i=1,2)\\ , \\ , .",
    "\\end{array } \\right.\\ ] ] then we solve the equations of motion for the other particle in this shock - wave spacetime , which consists of two flat semispaces glued together at @xmath38 with the discontinuity ( [ coordinatetransformation ] ) . for a particle with energy @xmath41 which is moving in the negative @xmath34 direction ( @xmath42 ) the wavefuction is , before the collision : @xmath43 while immediatly after the collision the continuity in the @xmath44 coordinates implies : @xmath45 thus we obtain the eikonal amplitude in inpact parameter representation : @xmath46 it is easy to see that @xmath47 is exactly the eikonal @xmath48 of equation ( [ eikonal ] ) .",
    "notice that the @xmath49 term in ( [ eikonalamplitude ] ) gives a contribution proportional to @xmath50 , which corresponds to the trivial part of the scattering , while the overall factor can be obtained by properly normalizing the wavefunctions .",
    "notice that the total elastic cross section is given by ( see @xcite ) : @xmath51 which is basically the area of a disk of radius @xmath23 ( apart from the case @xmath52 ) , while that for black hole creation can be only estimated as : @xmath53 which is parametrically smaller .",
    "besides the theoretical interest in the subject _ per se _ , why should one worry about attaching radiation to the eikonal amplitude ( [ eikonalamplitude ] ) ? from a phenomenological point of wiew we are interested in the case in which at least one of the two incoming particles is a hadron . in our case",
    "the momentum transfer @xmath54 is typically much larger than the qcd scale , for example for values of @xmath5 which are relevant at the at the lhc we have @xmath55 .",
    "this means that the typical impact parameter is much smaller then the proton size , and we expect the parton picture to be applicable ( ie no multiple parton interaction ) .",
    "we then write : @xmath56 where @xmath57 are the parton distribution functions ( pdf ) and @xmath58 is the factorization scale at which they are normalized .",
    "this scale is choosen in order to minimize the higher order corrections to the cross section , for example in the usual deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) the correct prescription is @xmath59 .",
    "this scaling violating evolution of the pdf is actually the main effect which is due to the qcd radiation , and it is taken into account by just normalizing the pdf at the correct scale ( see eg @xcite for a full reference ) .",
    "thus the problem of including radiation amounts first of all to determine the correct factorization scale .",
    "the reason why we expect something nonstandard is very intuitive .",
    "the usual dis is a pretty quantum phenomenon in which the momentum transfer @xmath60 is basically carried by a single particle , for example a photon @xmath61 . in transplanckian scattering instead the same is true only if the impact parameter is larger than @xmath23 , ie @xmath62 .",
    "if @xmath63 then the process is semiclassical , which means that a large number of graviton is exchanged , with the result that the typical momentum of an exchanged graviton is now @xmath60 divided by the total number of gravitons which are exchanged . for this heuristic reason , in @xcite the following factorization scale was proposed : @xmath64{l}% q\\,\\quad\\text{if}\\quad q < b_{c}^{-1}\\,,\\\\ q^{\\frac{1}{n+1}}\\left ( b_{c}^{-1}\\right ) ^{\\frac{n}{n+1}}\\,\\text{\\quad if\\quad}q > b_{c}^{-1}\\ , .",
    "\\end{array } \\right .",
    "\\label{eq : mu}%\\ ] ] the first purpose in including radiation in a consistent way is to check this nonstandard fact through a direct computation .",
    "in order to compute the qcd radiation corrections to the amplitude ( [ eikonalamplitude ] ) the best way to proceed is to generalize t  hooft method , in which the amplitude emerges as a whole in a nonperturbative way . to do this ,",
    "we consider the simplified case in which only one of the two incoming particles can radiate .",
    "we then replace the other particle with its gravitational field and do perturbative quantum field theory in the sw background for the remaining particle _ and _ its radiation .",
    "this is what is done in @xcitein full detail : the relevant feynman rules are there derived together with a formalism which allows to easily write down the relativistic amplitudes with the two particles in the initial state .    in this section",
    "the same result for the amplitude with radiation will be obtained in a more direct way , which is basically perturbation theory in position space , and which makes even more evident the connection with t hooft method .",
    "rewrite the eikonal amplitude as : @xmath65 then the solutions of the eom which reduce to plane waves in the past or in the future are : @xmath66.x}% + \\theta(x^{-})\\int\\frac{d^{2 } q_\\perp}{(2\\pi)^{2}}\\,i(p^{-},q_\\perp% ) \\,e^{i[p+ q_\\perp].x}\\ , , \\\\",
    "\\phi_{p}^{\\text{out}}(x ) & = & \\theta(x^{-})e^{i[p].x}% + \\theta(-x^{-})\\int\\frac{d^{2 } q_\\perp}{(2\\pi)^{2}}\\,i(p^{-},q_\\perp% ) \\,e^{i[p- q_\\perp].x}\\ , , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the vector in square brackets  notation denotes an on - shell 4-vector whose @xmath67 component is computed in terms of the known @xmath68 and @xmath69 components , i.e. @xmath70^+ \\equiv ( p_\\perp+q_\\perp)^{2}/p^{-}$ ] .",
    "analogously one has to solve the eom for a vector particle , obtaining @xmath71 , and one has to take care of the discontinuity of the polarization across the sw .",
    "the simplest thing to do is to use the covariant light cone gauge : @xmath72 so that one can fix @xmath73 in terms of @xmath74 and @xmath75 and forget about the change in polarization across the sw , since @xmath75 is continuous ( we refer to @xcite for details ) .",
    "consider now for simplicity a scalar quark with momentum @xmath76 which scatters across the sw changing its momentum into @xmath77 and emitting a gluon with momentum @xmath74 .",
    "then apart from some overall factors the matrix element is : @xmath78 this integral can be decomposed in the cases in which the gluon is emitted respectively after and before the sw , ie @xmath79 .",
    "apart from normalizations and delta functions one obtains : @xmath80 this is the correct amplitude at lowest order in qcd but nonperturbative in gravity , in the transplanckian regime .",
    "notice from ( [ eq : m1geval ] ) that the gluon re - interacts with the sw if it is emitted before the collision .",
    "notice also that in the soft limit @xmath81 one has @xmath82 , so that the integral in @xmath83 becomes trivial and the sum of @xmath84 and @xmath85 becomes equal to the amplitude without radiation times the weinberg current : @xmath86 this corresponds to the fact that the gravitational interaction of the gluon is negligible if its energy is small .    as a first application of this result",
    ", we can determine the scale of the process by studying the large logarithms coming from @xmath87 .",
    "we focus on the initial state radiation ( [ eq : m1geval ] ) , which is directly related to the evolution of the pdf ( while the final state radiation ( [ eq : m1geval : initial ] ) is clearly completely standard ) . to this purpose ,",
    "the relevant enhancement is not that related to softness , instead it is that related to collinearity @xmath88 , while @xmath89 can be a relevant fraction of the total energy .",
    "remember that , in general , factorization means the following fact ( see @xcite for a practical review ) .",
    "consider an amplitude @xmath90 in which there are @xmath91 external final state legs , one of which is a photon with momentum @xmath74 .",
    "then in the limit in which @xmath74 becomes collinear to one of the other legs ( call @xmath92 this leg and @xmath93 the perpendicular component with respect to the direction of this leg ) we have : @xmath94 is the splitting function for particle @xmath92 in @xmath92 plus gluon , and @xmath34 is the energy fraction which remains to particle @xmath92 after the splitting . for a radiated gluon",
    ", one has to integrate from an infrared cutoff @xmath95 which is basically the qcd scale up to @xmath93 of order of the momentum transfert @xmath60 .",
    "this is the reason why ( see @xcite for a full account ) one gets large logarithms @xmath96 which can be reabsorbed into the pdf once they are evolved according to the dokshitzer - gribov - lipatov - altarelli - parisi ( dglap ) equations and normalized at the scale @xmath60 .",
    "let us see what happens in the transplanckian case .",
    "it can be shown @xcite that , if @xmath97 is a relevant fraction of @xmath98 , then instead of reproducing ( [ factorization ] ) the modulus square of ( [ eq : m1geval ] ) , multiplied by the phase space of the gluon , behaves as : @xmath99 integrating over this peculiar gluon distribution up to @xmath100 one obtains exactly the factorization scale ( [ eq : mu ] ) , thus confirming the proposal of @xcite through an explicit computation .",
    "the problem of taking radiation into account in transplanckian elastic scattering has been shown to become a tractable problem after reducing it to a computation of quantum field theory in curved background .",
    "this can be done by generalizing an earlier idea of t hooft , in which one of the two particles is replaced by its gravitational field , the aichelburg - sexl shock wave .    using this method ,",
    "it has been proved the proposal of emparan , masip and rattazzi about the correct factorization scale in transplanckian processes involving hadrons . in doing so",
    ", one discovers that the probability distribution of the radiated partons has a peculiar shape , which depends directly on the number of extra dimensions .",
    "thus , related to this fact , there could be interesting experimental signatures at colliders , which require further investigation .",
