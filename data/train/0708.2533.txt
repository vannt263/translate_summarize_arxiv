    "seems at least at first sight quite difficult , even for this very symmetric and simple scenario .    to get a simpler formalism we may consider , not the spin vector @xmath0 itself , but the spin vector we _ would _ get if we momentarily would stop the gyroscope ( relative to a certain inertial frame ) by a pure boost ( i.e. a non - rotating boost )",
    "this object we will call the _ stopped _ spin vector .",
    "while being a four - vector it is effectively a three - dimensional object ( having zero time component in the inertial frame in question ) and we will show that the spatial part of this object undergoes pure rotation with a constant rate for the example of motion along a circle in special relativity .    knowing that there is a simple algebraic relation between the stopped and the standard spin vector , the stopped spin vector can be used as an intermediate step to easily find the standard spin vector .",

    "any @xmath19 components within the bracketed expressions will cancel due to the anti - symmetrization as is easy to see .",

    "@xmath54 this is the famous thomas precession , in stopped spin vector three - formalism . introducing @xmath55 as the precession vector , around which the stopped spin vector rotates , we can alternatively write ( [ aye ] ) as @xmath56 looking at ( [ ayea ] ) component - wise , it is a set of coupled differential equations , just like the standard fermi equations . unlike the fermi - equations however , the new equations correspond to a simple law of rotation ( precession ) .      as a specific example we may consider , as in the introduction , the precession of a gyroscope transported at constant speed @xmath3 around a circle of radius @xmath43 in the @xmath57 plane . assuming a motion with a clockwise angular velocity @xmath58 , the counterclockwise angular velocity @xmath59 for the precession of the stopped spin vector",

    "the local time per lap is simply @xmath61 and hence the net precession angle ( in radians ) around the plane normal is given by @xmath62 . if the circular motion is counter - clockwise , the precession is clockwise and vise versa .",
    "we can also trivially find the solution for the standard ( projected ) spin vector for the case of circular motion with constant speed with initial conditions as listed in the example in the introduction .",
    "we know that the standard ( projected ) spin vector is related to the stopped spin vector through a lengthening of the stopped spin vector in the forward direction of motion @xmath63 by a @xmath18-factor .",
    "we have then @xmath64 using the notation of the previous subsection we have then trivially for the case at hand @xmath65 using these expressions in ( [ hpp ] ) we immediately get the desired solution . using elementary rules for manipulating the trigonometric functions we can write it in the form of ( [ hm1])-([hm3 ] ) .",
    "if we are interested also in @xmath66 , it is given by the orthogonality of the standard spin vector and the four - velocity as @xmath67 .",
    "note that by use of the stopped spin vector formalism there is effectively no differential equation solving involved for this simple case .      for motion in a circle with constant velocity ,",

    "what about if we consider motion with constant velocity along some other curve , say a part of a parabola or some more irregular curve ? then the fermi equation would likely appear to be very complicated to solve analytically in the general case . using the method with the stopped spin vector the solution can however trivially be found for arbitrary curves .",

    "this theorem is easily proven by dividing an arbitrary smooth curve into infinitesimal segments within which we can consider the local curvature radius to be constant . letting @xmath5 denote the counter - clockwise angular velocity of the forward direction of motion @xmath63 ( so @xmath72 ) ,",
    "we have according to ( [ how ] ) the clockwise angular velocity as @xmath73 .",
    "thus the net angles of the gyroscope precession and the turning of the forward direction of the curve , along the segment in question , are related through @xmath74 .",
    "adding up the precession contributions from all the segments of the curve we get @xmath75 thus the theorem is proven .",
    "note that while the motion is assumed to be in a plane , the spin vector may point off the plane .",
    "we can draw a conclusion from the above proven theorem ( also knowing that there is a simple algebraic relation between the stopped and the standard spin - vector ) that can be expressed in terms of the standard spin vector , without reference to the stopped spin vector .",
    "consider then a smooth simple closed curve and let a certain point along this curve be the initial position for the gyroscope . for given initial spin vector , initial direction of motion and constant speed @xmath3 , the final spin vector ( after one lap around the loop ) is independent of the shape of the loop as illustrated in figure [ xf1 ] .",
    "but of course , the theorem is stronger than this . given an arbitrary , not necessarily closed but smooth curve along which we transport the gyroscope with constant velocity , we can trivially find the standard spin vector at any point along the curve .",
    "we take the spatial part of the initial spin vector and shorten the part parallel to the direction of motion by a @xmath18-factor to form the initial stopped spin vector . for any given curve @xmath76",
    "we then calculate the initial direction of the curve together with the direction of the curve at the point in question .",
    "then , modulo a winding number times @xmath77 we only get the turning angle @xmath69 up to a term @xmath78 , where @xmath79 is an integer , from the local quantity @xmath80 , we can trivially find the corresponding @xmath69 and thus through ( [ hh ] ) the corresponding stopped spin vector at the point in question . lengthening the parallel part of the stopped spin vector by a factor @xmath18 , we get the spatial part of the standard spin vector at the point in question . if we are interested in the zeroth component of the standard spin vector it is given by @xmath81 . thus solving a possibly very complicated differential equation",
    "is reduced to performing a few algebraic steps .      for motion in a plane where the velocity is not constant ,",
    "the procedure is analogous to that described in section [ concon ] except that we need to integrate ( a single integral which may or may not be complicated to solve analytically ) to find @xmath82 .",
    "for the most general motion , not necessarily confined to a plane and with a speed that may vary , it is however not just a matter of ordinary integration . given an arbitrary motion @xmath83 along a smooth curve we can however solve a differential equation , given by ( [ ayea ] ) and ( [ ayeb ] ) , for @xmath84 .",
    "likely this differential equation will be simpler to solve than the fermi equation .      to gain further intuition on the meaning of the stopped spin vector it may be useful to explore how it is related to other vectors of physical interest connected to the gyroscope spin . in particular we may consider the gyroscope intrinsic angular momentum , and the momentary direction of the gyroscope axis as perceived in the reference system in question ( where the observers are integral curves of @xmath16 ) .",
    "consider then a gyroscope moving along a straight line in the @xmath4-plane in special relativity ( using inertial coordinates ) with constant speed .",
    "the gyroscope axis is assumed to lie in the plane of motion and to be tilted somewhere between the forward and the sideways direction . in 2 + 1",
    "dimensions we can easily visualize the worldsheet of the gyroscope central axis as well as various vectors of interest , see figure [ xf2 ] .    we note that there are ( at least ) three different spatial directions of relevance for the gyroscope .",
    "it is easy to realize ( length contraction ) that the direction of the gyroscope axis is simply related to the direction of the stopped spin vector through a gamma factor . given any of these directions the other two can thus easily be found .",
    "furthermore one can show , at least for an idealized scenario as considered in [ spinapp ] , that the the intrinsic angular momentum , that we will denote @xmath85 , is in fact given by @xmath86 .",
    "the various vectors involved are illustrated in figure [ xf3 ] .",
    "consider a spatial vector @xmath87 that connects the base of the gyroscope to the tip of the gyroscope , as perceived in the reference system connected to @xmath16 .",
    "we understand that this vector evolves according to a simple rule of rotation given by ( [ aye ] ) modulated by a contraction by a factor of @xmath18 in the direction of motion .",
    "it is a short exercise to show that this means that @xmath87 in fact obeys a rather compact differential equation @xmath88.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we can perform a corresponding analysis for the projected spin vector to find @xmath89.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the equations for the stopped spin vector can be written in the form @xmath90 from ( [ rall5 ] ) , letting @xmath91 , we readily find @xmath92 - \\gamma^2 v \\frac{dv}{dt } { \\bf s}{_{{\\textrm{\\scriptsize l}}}}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] comparing the four differential equations we see that they are all quite compact , although the equation for the stopped spin vector , corresponding to a pure rotation , is more likely to be simple to solve ( as we have seen for the example of motion on a circle ) .",
    "one might argue that the object of physical interest is the intrinsic ( spin ) angular momentum of the gyroscope which is given by @xmath93 , or perhaps the observed direction of the gyroscope central axis . from this point of view",
    "the stopped spin vector is in a sense a means to an end . by using the stopped spin vector as an intermediate step we can find the solutions to otherwise quite complicated differential equations for the objects of physical interest . from a mathematical point of view",
    "this is certainly sufficient to motivate the use of the stopped spin vector .",
    "there is however more to the stopped spin vector than this .",
    "in particular we note that the stopped spin vector _ directly _ gives us the spin as perceived in a comoving system .",
    "for instance , if the stopped spin vector is at a @xmath94 angle with respect to the forward direction ",
    "so it will be with respect to a system comoving with the gyroscope .",
    "this is contrary to the standard spin vector which only gives the spin direction with respect to the comoving system after a lorentz transformation .",
    "consider the following example .",
    "a gyroscope is suspended inside a satellite such that no torque is exerted on the gyroscope as seen from the satellite .",
    "the satellite is assumed to be orbiting along some predetermined smooth simple closed curve , on a plane in special relativity . ] , using it s jet engines to stay on the path .",
    "suppose then that we wish to measure , from the satellite , the precession angle of the gyroscope ( as predicted by relativity ) after a full orbit ( or maybe several full orbits ) .",
    "we note that the direction of the gyroscope relative to the satellite itself is not a good measure . assuming that we have a couple of fixed stars",
    ", we can however use the direction of these stars ( as perceived from the satellite ) as guidelines to set up a reference system within the satellite for this scenario the stopped spin vector is exactly the physical object that we are interested in .",
    "it exactly represents the gyroscope direction relative to the star - calibrated reference system of the satellite .",
    "thus if the stopped spin vector turns a certain angle , that is precisely the turning angle of the gyroscope relative to the star - calibrated reference system of the satellite .",
    "while we are here focusing on spinning gyroscopes , it should also be noted that the formalism of the stopped spin vector is immediately applicable to describe the resulting rotation of _ any _ object which has zero _ proper _ ( comoving ) rotation .    in conclusion , the stopped spin vector may be used as an intermediate step to simplify the calculation of the evolution of the intrinsic angular momentum ( spin ) of a gyroscope , or the perceived direction of the gyroscope axis . the stopped spin vector is however also of direct physical importance since it gives us the spin as perceived in a comoving system .",
    "so far we have only given examples that apply to flat spacetime , and inertial reference frames .",
    "as we will see in the following sections the stopped spin vector can be just as useful also for curved spacetimes and non - inertial reference frames .",
    "the transport equation ( [ kottfinal ] ) tells us how the stopped spin vector deviates from a vector that is parallel transported with respect to the spacetime geometry .",
    "this by itself is however not really what we are after if the reference congruence is non - inertial . to get a truly three - dimensional formalism , we in stead want an expression telling us",
    "how fast the stopped spin vector deviates ( rotates ) from a vector that is parallel transported with respect to the _ spatial _ geometry determined by the congruence .",
    "as is demonstrated in @xcite and in @xcite , it is possible derive a _",
    "spacetime _ transport law corresponding to a _ spatial _ parallel transport . for the simple , and perhaps most useful , case of a rigid congruence",
    "the issue is sufficiently simple that we will briefly review it in the coming subsection .",
    "suppose then that we have a rigid congruence with nonzero acceleration @xmath95 , nonzero rotation tensor @xmath96 but with vanishing expansion - shear tensor @xmath97 , the acceleration vector @xmath98 , the shear tensor @xmath99 and the rotation tensor @xmath100 .",
    "furthermore we employ what we denote the expansion - shear tensor @xmath101 . ] .    in figure [ fig3 ]",
    "we show an illustration of the spacetime transport of a vector orthogonal to the congruence .",
    "it is easy to show that in the coordinates of a freely falling system @xmath102 , locally comoving with the congruence , the velocity of the congruence points ( assuming vanishing @xmath97 ) is to first order given by @xmath103 knowing that the velocity of the congruence is zero to lowest order , relative to the inertial system in question , we need not worry about length contraction and such .",
    "it is then easy to realize that the proper spacetime transport law of a spatial vector @xmath104 corresponding to standard spatial parallel transport is @xmath105 here @xmath106 can easily be determined from the orthogonality of @xmath104 and @xmath16 follows ( differentiate @xmath107 along the gyroscope worldline ) that @xmath108 .",
    "contracting both sides of ( [ init ] ) by @xmath109 gives @xmath110 . ] .",
    "here we have then a spacetime transport equation corresponding to spatial parallel transport , for the case of a non - shearing ( non - expanding ) congruence .      for a more complicated congruence that is shearing and expanding , it is not quite so obvious how to define the spatial parallel transport .",
    "indeed as discussed in e.g @xcite and @xcite , there are several ways of doing this .",
    "we will here follow the approach of @xcite , and consider two different such parallel transports .",
    "these transports are connected to two different ways of defining a spatial curvature for a test particle worldline , with respect to the congruence @xmath111_\\perp = [ a^\\mu]_\\perp+2v ( { \\omega^\\mu}_\\alpha t^\\alpha + [ { \\theta^\\mu}_\\alpha t^\\alpha]_\\perp )    + v^2 \\frac{n{_{{\\textrm{\\scriptsize ps}}}}^\\mu}{r{_{{\\textrm{\\scriptsize ps } } } } } \\\\[3 mm ] \\textrm{new : } & & \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2 } \\left[\\frac{du^\\mu}{d\\tau}\\right]_\\perp = [ a^\\mu]_\\perp+2v { \\omega^\\mu}_\\alpha t^\\alpha + v^2 \\frac{n{_{{\\textrm{\\scriptsize ns}}}}^\\mu}{r{_{{\\textrm{\\scriptsize ns } } } } }    .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath112 and @xmath113 are the curvature and the curvature direction that we get if we project the the spacetime trajectory down along the congruence onto a local timeslice ( orthogonal to the congruence at the point in question ) .",
    "the suffix ps stands for projected straight. the curvature @xmath114 and the curvature direction @xmath115 are defined with respect to deviations from a certain ( new ) notion of a spatially straight line .",
