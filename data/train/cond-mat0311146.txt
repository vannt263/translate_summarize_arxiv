    "below an order - disorder temperature , nanoscale phases of various symmetries can be found in block copolymer melts @xcite .",
    "for example , for diblock copolymers that consist of two chemically distinct but covalently bonded monomers , six distinct phases that result from microphase separation have been documented @xcite .",
    "they differ by the symmetry of their composition modulation .",
    "one of the most actively investigated microphases is the lamellar phase , which can be observed around 50 - 50 composition ( symmetric mixture ) .",
    "however , when melts are processed by thermal quenching or solution - casting from a disordered phase , a macroscopic size sample usually exhibits polycrystalline configurations comprised of many locally ordered but randomly oriented domains ( grains ) and large amounts of topological defects , such as grain boundaries , dislocations , and disclinations .",
    "such state of partial ordering is undesirable for many applications , with significant affects on e.g. , the optical and mechanical performance of the material .",
    "therefore , the realization and control of long - range orientational order of domains has been of great interest in both experimental and theoretical studies .",
    "several methods have been used experimentally to achieve microstructural alignment in block copolymer melts since the discovery of flow - induced alignment by keller _",
    "one of the most common ways to induce global order in bulk samples is to impose an oscillatory or steady shear between two parallel plates , which not only has the advantage of easily characterizing the shear stress and monitoring the aligning progress , but also can bring some interesting new physics . for the case of lamellar morphology that we are interested in here , the two most often observed alignments relative to the imposed shear are parallel ( with the lamellar layers parallel to the shearing plane ) , and perpendicular ( with the lamellar layers normal to the vorticity of the shear flow ) .",
    "both alignments have been observed in nearly symmetric diblock copolymer systems such as poly(ethylenepropylene)-poly(ethylethylene ) ( pep - pee ) @xcite and polystyrene - polyisoprene ( ps - pi ) . which of these two possible alignments is selected in a given experiment depends on temperature , and shear strain amplitude and frequency @xcite .",
    "a third alignment direction , the so called transverse orientation in which the lamellar normal is parallel to the shear direction , has been found to coexist with parallel orientation for entangled poly(styrene - b - ethylenepropylene ) ( s - ep ) diblock copolymer at high frequency and in the strong segregation limit @xcite .",
    "other studies have focused on the kinetics of global alignment and have shown that the ordering rate increases with shear frequency , strain amplitude , and temperature @xcite .",
    "experiments on ps - pi diblocks further show nonlinear effects of the strain amplitude on the alignment rate , and that the time scale for the development of alignment exhibits a power law dependence on the strain amplitude , with an exponent equal to @xmath0 or @xmath1 depending on the stage of alignment and in different frequency regimes @xcite .",
    "furthermore , many experiments have indicated that the motion of topological defects plays an important role in the global alignment of microdomains under shear , including the evolution of kink band defects and tilt boundaries @xcite , as well as the migration and annihilation of partial focal conic defects , boundaries , and tilt walls @xcite .",
    "a coarse - grained description of a diblock copolymer melt has been used , both in the weak segregation and strong segregation @xcite regimes , to theoretically understand the effect of shear flow and the mechanisms of morphology evolution @xcite .",
    "the analytic studies of cates and milner @xcite , and fredrickson @xcite focused on the order - disorder transition from the isotropic state to the lamellar phase and the related alignment dynamics for systems subjected to steady shear flow . below the transition temperature , the stability of uniform lamellar structures under an oscillatory shear flow has been addressed in both two - dimensional ( 2d ) @xcite and three - dimensional ( 3d ) @xcite cases .",
    "bifurcation diagrams , including secondary instabilities ( eckhaus and zigzag ) were given .",
    "these analyses found that although all three types of lamellar orientations could be linearly stable under specific conditions , the stability range of the perpendicular orientation is larger than that of the parallel one , which in turn is larger than the region of stability of the transverse orientation .",
    "the perpendicular alignment was also shown to be the preferred orientation following the decay of unstable parallel or transverse lamellae .",
    "in addition to these analytic work , computer simulations have been performed to investigate the dynamics of lamellar alignment in bulk samples under steady @xcite or oscillatory @xcite shear flow .",
    "the effects of strain amplitude and shear frequency on the degree of sample alignment have been examined , as well as annihilation processes of defects ( such as dislocations and disclinations ) @xcite .",
    "also , domain coarsening in 2d diblock copolymer melts has been addressed although in the absence of shear @xcite .",
    "little is known about the effect of shear on coarsening of block copolymers .",
    "few of the previous theoretical studies discussed above focused on the detailed dynamics and quantitative properties of topological defects motion under shear , which are crucial for the understanding of alignment and coarsening . in this paper",
    "we study the detailed mechanisms of grain boundary motion under an oscillatory shear flow building upon stability results of uniform lamellar patterns @xcite .",
    "we use a simplified 2d configuration which involves only two lamellar domains of parallel and transverse orientations respectively , separated by a grain boundary , and focus on shears of small amplitude ( less than @xmath2 ) and low angular frequency .",
    "compared to previous numerical simulations @xcite , the aspect ratio ( defined as the ratio between the lateral extent of the system and the lamellar wavelength ) is larger , so that important dynamic features associated with grain boundary motion , such as diffusive relaxation of lamellae , phase shift of boundary velocity , and wavenumber adjustment in the transverse region , can be quantitatively analyzed .",
    "these features were absent in earlier work on lamellar ( roll ) systems without shear @xcite , and we argue below that they are important when the system is under oscillatory shear .    this paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec_model ] we introduce a dimensionless model equation based on the swift - hohenberg equation to describe the dynamic evolution of symmetric diblock copolymer melts under shear , and describe the grain boundary configuration used .",

    "the system under consideration is a symmetric diblock copolymer melt below the order - disorder transition temperature @xmath3 . for length scales larger than the microscopic monomer scale (",
    "i.e. , at a mesoscopic level ) and time scales long enough compared to the molecular relaxation of the polymer chains , a coarse - grained description of the block copolymer melt can be used , with an order parameter field @xmath4 representing the local density difference of the two constituent monomers . in the weak segregation limit , i.e. , close to @xmath3 , a coarse - grained free energy functional has been derived @xcite : @xmath5 = \\int d{\\bf r } \\left \\ { -\\frac{\\tau}{2 } \\psi^2 + \\frac{u}{4 } \\psi^4 + \\frac{\\xi}{2 } \\left [ \\left ( \\nabla^2 + { q_0^*}^2 \\right )   \\psi \\right ] ^2 \\right \\ } , \\label{eq_f}\\ ] ] where @xmath6 denotes a reduced temperature variable which is a measure of the distance from the order - disorder transition and is positive below @xmath3 , and @xmath7 is the wavenumber of the periodic lamellar structure . under the assumption that changes in the local composition field @xmath8 are driven by the free energy minimization and advection by the flow ,",

    "we are interested here in the case of a @xmath28 grain boundary with two mutually perpendicular lamellar sets a and b , a configuration that is known to be stable against small perturbations in the absence of shear @xcite .",
    "the two domains are under an imposed shear flow @xmath29 where @xmath30 represents the shear rate with strain @xmath31 , @xmath32 is the angular frequency , @xmath33 the strain amplitude , and all quantities are assumed dimensionless .",

    "the stability diagrams presenting secondary instability boundaries ( for zigzag and eckhaus modes ) for 2d system have also been given in ref . .",
    "we focus below solely on shears for which both uniform parallel and transverse lamellae are linearly stable .",
    "in addition , we consider the case in which shear effects are of the same order of magnitude as diffusive relaxation of the order parameter .",

    "[ fig_shear ] : first , transverse lamellae in the bulk rigidly follow the oscillatory shear flow , leading to a periodic change in their orientation .",
    "second , during part of the cycle the region of parallel lamellae b grows as transverse lamellae in the boundary region break up and reconnect as parallel lamellae ( cross roll instability ) .",
    "this process is partially reversed during the rest of the cycle .",
    "the grain boundary exhibits oscillatory motion with a nonzero net average as shown in figs .",

    "[ fig_xstar ] with decreasing @xmath93 , or negative velocity @xmath92 in fig .",
    "[ fig_vgb ] .    whereas rigid distortion of transverse lamellae is the dominant response to shear in the bulk , order parameter diffusion is important in the boundary region , and is the mechanism that enables dissipation of the excess free energy stored in the bulk transverse region due to shearing . on the one hand ,",
    "transverse lamellae are elastically compressed by the shear , resulting in a net free energy increase in region a relative to b. as a consequence , the elastic contribution to the system s energy is expected to drive grain boundary motion toward the transverse domain at all times during the shear cycle . on the other hand , backward motion",
    "is also observed in figs .",
    "[ fig_xstar ] and [ fig_vgb ] in those portions of the shear cycle in which the magnitude of the shear strain @xmath94 is small , indicating diffusive relaxation of the order parameter field near the grain boundary .",
    "the competition between the two determines the net rate of advance of the boundary .",

    "note that the power law dependence is consistent with experiments in ps - pi copolymers @xcite , in which the rate of global alignment of a bulk sample is a power law of the strain amplitude , with an exponent in the range @xmath104 .",
    "bulk transverse lamellae elastically compressed by the shear would have a wavenumber @xmath105 in the laboratory frame , or @xmath106 , constant , in the sheared frame .",

    "in addition to the motion in the position of the peak of the structure factor , fig .",
    "[ fig_qx](a ) also shows a decreasing amplitude and broadening of the peak .",
    "this is due to the finite size of the configuration ; as the grain boundary moves , the region occupied by transverse lamellae decreases .",

    "( e.g. , @xmath190 in fig . [ fig_phasea](a ) ) , the wavenumber change can be observed in the whole transverse domain , with @xmath191 corresponding to the stationary peak position of the structure factor @xmath107 presented in fig .",
    "[ fig_qx](a ) ( @xmath192 there ) .",
    "we find that @xmath193 , the wavenumber shift discussed in sec .",

    "[ fig_phasea](a)and ( b ) .",
    "a coarse grained order parameter model has been used to study the motion of a grain boundary separating two regions of uniform parallel and transverse lamellae under an imposed shear flow .",
    "the motion of the boundary is oscillatory , and the driving force for motion is the excess energy stored in the elastically strained transverse phase that can only be relieved through diffusive relaxation of the order parameter in the boundary region .",
    "diffusive relaxation , however , is complex as the response of the order parameter field is out of phase with the shear , and lamellae break up and reconnect during each of the cycles",
    ". as expected , the effects of diffusive relaxation are more pronounced for small shear strain and low angular frequency , as seen in both the time dependent behavior of boundary velocity ( fig .",
    "[ fig_vgb ] ) or the time averaged velocity ( figs .",
    "[ fig_v_w ] and [ fig_v_gamma ] ) .",
    "although under the conditions of the study both transverse and parallel orientations are linearly stable , we observe net motion of the boundary toward the region occupied by transverse lamellae .    as the boundary moves over time ,",
    "we have observed that the wavenumber of the transverse lamellae does not remain constant and equal to @xmath27 .",
    "instead , it is slowly readjusted by wavenumber diffusion , as shown by both direct solution of the coarse grained model of sec .",
    "[ sec_num ] and the corresponding complex amplitude equations of sec .",
    "[ sec_ampl ] .",
    "the wavenumber shift @xmath195 is approximately independent of shear frequency @xmath32 , but strongly dependent on the strain amplitude @xmath33 . in order to understand the physical origin of wavenumber compression ( or lamellae expansion )",
    "that occurs in the transverse region a , we focus on the lamellae near the grain boundary , since the calculation in sec .",
    "[ sec_ampl ] shows that wavenumber change is initiated at the boundary , and then propagates into the bulk .",
    "since the amplitude of the transverse lamellae go to zero at the boundary region , it is possible to create or eliminate lamellar planes there in a way that it is not possible in the bulk for the parameters of our study @xcite .",
    "first consider the stability diagram of the swift - hohenberg model ( [ eq_s - h ] ) at zero shear @xcite .",
    "for fixed @xmath196 and @xmath197 , the closest instability boundary in the @xmath198-@xmath196 diagram is the eckhaus instability given by @xmath199 for @xmath68 and @xmath26 , we have the eckhaus boundary at @xmath200 . in our case",
    "@xmath198 is the wavenumber of the transverse lamellae in the lab frame , and equal to @xmath105 if we assume that the lamellae are rigidly distorted by the shear .",
    "the maximum value of @xmath198 is then @xmath201 so that for @xmath79 we have @xmath202 .",
    "although this is not sufficient to destabilize the bulk transverse region ( according to the stability diagrams in ref .",
    "obtained by floquet analysis over the entire period of the oscillation ) , it appears to be sufficient to induce lamellar elimination at the grain boundary region , as seen in figs .",
    "[ fig_qx ] and [ fig_phasea ] .",
    "the figures show that @xmath203 , corresponding to the elimination of @xmath120 transverse lamellae .",
    "as @xmath33 decreases @xmath204 also decreases , becoming smaller than @xmath205 , and eventually lamellae elimination is expected to cease .",
    "this is consistent with our results shown in fig . [",
    "fig_qx](b ) . with decreasing value of @xmath33 from @xmath96 to @xmath206 , the number of lost transverse lamellae decreases from @xmath120 to @xmath123 .    in summary , for small shear strains and low frequencies such that diffusion of order parameter",
    "is of the same order as advection by the flow , the excess free energy in the transverse region relative to the marginal parallel region is dissipated through order parameter diffusion in the grain boundary region .",
    "the latter includes break up and reconnection of transverse lamellae , and a weak eckhaus instability developing at the grain boundary that diffuses into the bulk transverse lamellae leading to dynamical wavenumber readjustment . a weakly nonlinear analysis , as well as the amplitude equations derived , capture quantitatively all aspects of grain boundary motion , including the boundary velocity and the wavenumber readjustment .",
    "the order parameter distribution in the boundary region can be represented crudely by introducing an adiabatic approximation into the amplitude equations , which gives a reasonable approximation to the net boundary velocity toward the transverse region , and be well reproduced by the direct solution of the amplitude equations .",
    "although our study is confined to the case of a transverse / parallel grain boundary in two dimensions , we expect that our results will qualitatively hold for both three dimensional transverse / parallel and transverse / perpendicular cases . in three dimensions , however , there is a completely different type of tilt boundary , that between parallel and perpendicular lamellae .",
    "both orientations are marginal with respect to the shear .",
    "this configuration is currently under investigation ."
