    "the origin of cosmological magnetic fields still remains an enigma in modern precision cosmology  @xcite .",
    "in particular , how to make magnetic fields on mpc scales would be a big challenge . as an attractive possibility , creation of primordial magnetic fields from inflation has been discussed  @xcite . in particular , a nonminimal kinetic term of vector fields in supergravity can be used to generate primordial cosmological magnetic fields  @xcite .",
    "recently , the backreaction issue in this mechanism is raised  @xcite . there",
    ", it is pointed out that magnetic fields from inflation may not be a viable mechanism when the backreaction is taken into account .",
    "the difficulty to create magnetic fields from inflation originates in the existence of electric fields whose energy density rapidly grows and soon catches up with the energy density of inflaton .",
    "thus , the backreaction begins to work .",
    "the crucial assumption here is that the backreaction destroys inflation .",
    "hence , creation of magnetic fields can not be compatible with a sufficiently long inflation .",
    "however , no one has proved the above assumption .",
    "rather , there is a counter example that the backreaction of vector fields does not spoil inflation  @xcite .",
    "hence , it is worth studying magnetogenesis from inflation by taking into account the backreaction .    in this paper , we reconsider generation of magnetic fields during inflation .",
    "we take into account the backreaction of electromagnetic fields in an inflationary scenario .",
    "it turns out that the resultant cosmological evolution with backreaction is drastically different from the one without backreaction .",
    "indeed , the dynamics of inflaton is quite different and the universe is anisotropically inflating although anisotropy is very small  @xcite . in this new background , we consider generation of magnetic fields and conclude that cosmological magnetic fields could be hardly produced during inflation due to the backreaction although inflation still continues in spite of backreaction .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows . in section",
    "ii , we present our model and clarify the condition when the backreaction becomes important . in section iii",
    ", we review a naive perturbative analysis and reveal the necessity of the backreaction . in section iv , we take into account the backreaction and show that the backreaction changes the dynamics of inflaton significantly . in this new inflationary background , we study generation of magnetic fields and calculate the power spectrum of magnetic fields .",
    "we find that it is difficult to produce magnetic fields from inflation due to backreaction although inflation still continues .",
    "the final section is devoted to conclusion .",
    "in this section , we present our models and basic equations for discussing the backreaction  @xcite . here , we envisage the chaotic inflation although it is easy to extend analysis to other scenarios .",
    "we consider electromagnetic fields in a homogeneous anisotropic universe and explain why it is believed that inflation is spoiled when the backreaction of electromagnetic fields becomes important .",
    "then , treating electromagnetic fields perturbatively , we clarify in which case the backreaction becomes important .",
    "let us consider the following action for the gravitational field , the inflaton field @xmath0 and the electro - magnetic vector field @xmath1 coupled with @xmath0 : @xmath2 \\ , \\label{action1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath3 is the reduced plack mass , @xmath4 is the determinant of the metric , @xmath5 is the ricci scalar , @xmath6 is the inflaton potential , @xmath7 is the coupling function of the inflaton field to the vector one , respectively .",
    "the field strength of the vector field is defined by @xmath8 .",
    "thanks to the gauge invariance , we can choose the gauge @xmath9 .",
    "without loss of generality , we can take @xmath10-axis in the direction of the vector .",
    "hence , we take the homogeneous fields of the form @xmath11 and @xmath12 note that we have assumed the direction of the vector field does not change in time , for simplicity .",
    "this field configuration holds plane symmetry in the plane perpendicular to the vector .",
    "then , we take the metric to be @xmath13 \\ , \\label{metric}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the cosmic time @xmath14 is used . here",
    ", @xmath15 is an isotropic scale factor and @xmath16 represents a deviation from the isotropy .",
    "it should be noted that we need to consider an anisotropic spacetime from consistency when we treat a background vector field . with above ansatz , one obtains the equation of motion for the vector field which is easily solved as @xmath17 where an overdot denotes a derivative with respect to the cosmic time @xmath14 and @xmath18 denotes a constant of integration . substituting ( [ eq : ax ] ) into other equations , we obtain basic equations @xmath19 \\ ,   \\label{hamiltonian}\\\\ \\ddot{\\alpha } & = & -3\\dot{\\alpha}^2 + \\frac{1}{m_p^2 } v(\\phi )   + \\frac { p_{a}^2}{6 m_p^2}f^{-2}(\\phi ) e^{-4\\alpha -4\\sigma } ,   \\label{evolution : alpha}\\\\ \\ddot{\\sigma } & = & -3\\dot{\\alpha}\\dot{\\sigma }   + \\frac { p_{a}^2}{3 m_p^2}f^{-2}(\\phi ) e^{-4\\alpha -4\\sigma }   \\label{eq : sigma } , \\\\ \\ddot{\\phi } & = & -3\\dot{\\alpha}\\dot{\\phi } -v_\\phi(\\phi )   + p_{a}^2 f^{-3}(\\phi ) f_\\phi ( \\phi ) e^{-4\\alpha -4\\sigma }   \\label{eq : phi } \\ , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath20 denotes the derivative of @xmath21 with respect to @xmath0 .    from eq.([hamiltonian ] ) , we see the effective potential @xmath22 determines the inflaton dynamics .",
    "as the second term is coming from the vector contribution , we refer it to the energy density of the vector .",
    "let s check if inflation occurs in this model . using eqs.([hamiltonian ] ) and ( [ evolution : alpha ] ) , equation for acceleration of the universe",
    "is given by @xmath23   \\ .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] it is easy to see that if the energy density of the vector is dominant inflation soon ends .",
    "this is the reason why it is usually supposed that the backreaction spoils inflation .",
    "however , as we will see in section iv , the relevance of backreaction does not necessarily imply the energetic dominance of the electromagnetic fields .",
    "to see when the backreaction of electromagnetic fields becomes relevant , we consider electromagnetic fields in the isotropic universe . from eq.([hamiltonian ] ) , it is apparent that the fate of the electric field depends on the behavior of coupling function @xmath7 . by considering the critical case @xmath24",
    "for which the energy density of the vector field remains almost constant during inflation , we can determine the functional form of @xmath25 under the assumption of slow - roll inflation .",
    "we can use conventional slow - roll equations @xmath26 then , we have an equation @xmath27 this can be easily integrated as @xmath28 here , we have absorbed a constant of integration into the definition of @xmath29 .",
    "thus , we obtain @xmath30 for the polynomial potential @xmath31 , we have @xmath32 let us consider more general cases by introducing a parameter @xmath33 in the following form  @xcite : @xmath34 where we have used the relation @xmath35 we notice that the energy density of the vector field during inflation would be negligible when @xmath36 and remains constant when @xmath37 . while it grows when @xmath38 and the growth rate of the energy density of vector fields can be calculated as @xmath39 apparently , we need to take into account the backreaction for @xmath40 . in the next section ,",
    "we consider generation of magnetic fields in the conventional inflationary background driven by an inflaton .",
    "there , we will recognize that @xmath40 is necessary for creating cosmological magnetic fields and therefore the backreaction turns out to be important .",
    "in this section , we review the arguments made in the paper by demozzi et al .  @xcite .",
    "let us consider the maxwell fields @xmath41 \\ , \\label{action1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we assumed a general coupling function ( [ key ] ) .",
    "we will consider the isotropic inflationary background @xmath42 where , for convenience , we switched to the conformal time @xmath43 .",
    "it is well known that the physical degrees are described by the transverse vector which can be written in fourier space as @xmath44 where @xmath16 denotes degrees of polarization and polarization vectors @xmath45 satisfy the relation @xmath46 and @xmath47 assuming the isotropic frw universe ( [ frw ] ) , we can deduce the action for physical modes @xmath48 \\ , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where a prime represents a derivative with respect to the conformal time .",
    "let us quantize the system by promoting @xmath49 and the conjugate momentum @xmath50 to operators satisfying @xmath51     = i \\delta^{\\sigma \\rho } \\delta({\\bf k}-{\\bf k}')\\ , $ ] and others are zero . using creation and annihilation operators satisfying @xmath52     = \\delta^{\\sigma \\rho } \\delta({\\bf k}-{\\bf k } ' )   \\ , $ ] we can expand @xmath53 as @xmath54 where mode functions have to satisfy equations of motion @xmath55 and the normalization conditions @xmath56 from the correlation function of the vector field @xmath57 we can read off the power spectrum @xmath58 similarly , we can deduce the power spectrum of the magnetic fields @xmath59 @xmath60 where we used the formula @xmath61 the vacuum state @xmath62 can be specified by the initial condition for the positive frequency mode at a sufficiently past time @xmath43 @xmath63 the above mode function on subhorizon scales connects to the superhorizon solutions @xmath64 where @xmath65 and @xmath66 are constants of integration . for the coupling function , we take @xmath67 where @xmath68 is a parameter and @xmath69 is the scale factor at the end of inflation @xmath70 . in the case of the conventional slow roll inflation , following ( [ key ] ) , we have @xmath71",
    ". then , the solution ( [ u : solution ] ) becomes @xmath72 where we used the relation @xmath73 and rescaled constants of integration . here",
    ", the hubble parameter during inflation @xmath74 is assumed to be constant .",
    "there are two branches where magnetic fields can be created . for a negative @xmath33 , there exists no backreaction problem because the electric fields do not exist in this case . for this case , however , the analysis is not reliable due to the strong coupling problem  @xcite .",
    "hence , we will not consider this case hereafter .",
    "for a positive @xmath33 , the second term of ( [ u : new ] ) which depends on time is a relevant one . by matching ( [ u : initial ] ) and ( [ u : new ] ) at the horizon crossing @xmath75 , the constant @xmath66 can be determined .",
    "thus , we obtain @xmath76 where we defined @xmath77 . substituting ( [ result ] ) into ( [ magnetic ] ) , we obtain magnetic fields at the end of inflation @xmath70 as @xmath78 where @xmath79 is the physical wavelength at the end of inflation corresponding to the comoving wavenumber @xmath80 . to get the flat spectrum , we need @xmath81 . assuming the gut scale inflation @xmath82",
    ", we get @xmath83 at the end of inflation .",
    "since @xmath84 , this implies @xmath85 at the end of inflation .",
    "if we assume the instantaneous reheating and take @xmath86 as a reheating temperature , we have @xmath87 where we used the temperature @xmath88 gev at present @xmath89 . taking into account the relation @xmath90",
    ", we obtain @xmath91 at present .",
    "this is close to the expected value @xmath92 g from observations . in that case , however , the energy density of the electromagnetic fields @xmath93 exceeds the energy of the inflaton .",
    "in fact , from the formula for the energy - momentum tensor @xmath94 \\ , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we can calculate the energy density for the electro - magnetic fields @xmath95 \\ , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which can be estimated as @xmath96 where @xmath97 is the beginning of inflation .",
    "once the energy density of the electro - magnetic fields @xmath93 becomes comparable to the energy density of the inflaton @xmath98 , namely , @xmath99 , we need to consider the backreaction .",
    "more precisely , after the time @xmath100 we need to consider the backreaction .",
    "usually , it is believed that once the electromagnetic fields becomes dominant , the backreaction spoils inflation . however , in the next section , we will see inflation continues opposed to the naive expectation .",
    "this is because the backreaction affects the dynamics of inflaton before the energy density of the electromagnetic fields dominates that of the inflaton .",
    "thus , it is worth reexamining generation of magnetic fields from inflation with the backreaction .",
    "we consider the potential @xmath101 in this section .",
    "hence , we adopt the coupling function @xmath102 . since we are going to look into the situation where the electromagnetic field is not negligible",
    ", it is natural to consider an anisotropic spacetime with a coherent vector field . however , as the energy density of the vector field should be subdominant during inflation , the anisotropy is negligible to the lowest order . hence we ignore @xmath16 in the basic equations and regard it perturbative quantity .",
    "the inflaton dynamics described by eqs.([hamiltonian ] ) and ( [ eq : phi ] ) can be written as @xmath103   \\ , \\label{h3 } \\\\ \\ddot{\\phi } & = & -3\\dot{\\alpha}\\dot{\\phi } -m^2\\phi   + \\frac{c}{m_p^2 } \\phi e^{-\\frac{c}{m_p^2 }                      \\phi^2 - 4\\alpha   } p_{a}^2\\label{eq : phi3 }       \\ .",
    "\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] when the effect of the vector field is comparable with that of the inflaton field as source terms in ( [ eq : phi3 ] ) , we get the relation @xmath104 . if we define the ratio of the energy density of the vector field @xmath105 to that of the inflaton @xmath106 as @xmath107 we find the ratio becomes @xmath108 when the above relation holds .",
    "since inflation takes place typically at @xmath109 , the ratio goes @xmath110 .",
    "thus we find that the effect of the vector filed in ( [ h3 ] ) is negligible even when it is comparable with that of the scalar field in ( [ eq : phi3 ] ) .",
    "we notice that the above situation is not transient one but an attractor .",
    "suppose that @xmath111 is initially negligible , @xmath112 .",
    "in the conventional slow - roll inflationary phase ( [ slow1 ] ) , the relation @xmath113 holds as was shown in ( [ critical ] ) . hence , the ratio @xmath114 varies as @xmath115 as we now consider @xmath40 , @xmath111 increases rapidly during inflation and eventually reaches @xmath110 .",
    "whereas , if the ratio is initially @xmath116 , the inflaton climbs up the potential due to the effect of the vector field in ( [ eq : phi3 ] ) , hence @xmath111 will decrease rapidly and again @xmath110 will be realized soon .",
    "thus irrespective of initial conditions , @xmath111 will track @xmath117 .    from these arguments ,",
    "the inflaton dynamics after tracking is governed by the modified slow - roll equations @xmath118 we refer to the phase governed by the above equations as the second inflationary phase , compared to the first one governed by the equations ( [ slow1 ] ) .",
    "using above equations , we can deduce @xmath119 this can be integrated as @xmath120^{-1 }   , $ ] where @xmath121 is a constant of integration .",
    "this solution rapidly converges to @xmath122 thus , we found @xmath111 becomes constant during the second inflationary phase  @xcite .",
    "in particular , from ( [ attractor ] ) , the relation @xmath123 holds in this phase .",
    "thus , when the backreaction becomes relevant , we effectively have @xmath124 .",
    "we note that the backreaction makes the expansion anisotropic .",
    "in fact , as is done in a previous work  @xcite , we can obtain a remarkable result from ( [ eq : sigma ] ) as @xmath125 where @xmath126 is a slow roll parameter and @xmath127 is the anisotropic expansion rate normalized by the hubble parameter .",
    "typically , we have a small anisotropy @xmath128 .",
    "however , it is not impossible to detect this small number by planck  @xcite .",
    "in the situation where magnetic fields have a scale free spectrum @xmath81 , the formula ( [ field ] ) tells us that the electric fields have a red spectrum . hence , the largest scale has a dominant contribution to the energy density .",
    "we can assume the coherent electric fields with a definite direction dominate the energy density of the electromagnetic fields .",
    "then , the result in the previous subsection is applicable .",
    "now , we will take into account the backreaction .",
    "the point is as follows .",
    "before the backreaction becomes important , we have the relation @xmath129 however , once the backreaction becomes important , we have an attractor behavior @xmath130 that means the effective @xmath131 changes from @xmath132 to the critical value @xmath124 due to backreaction . since we have the formula ( see eq.([electric ] ) ) @xmath133 the transition point @xmath134 occurs at @xmath135 , i.e. @xmath136    we are now in a position to calculate the power spectrum of magnetic fields .",
    "first , we consider the modes which exit the horizon before @xmath134 .",
    "the superhorizon evolution of the mode function before @xmath134 is given by @xmath137 where we should note @xmath138 is defined by @xmath139 from the continuity at @xmath134 . since the evolution after @xmath134 becomes @xmath140 , we obtain the mode function after @xmath134 as @xmath141 from the formula ( [ magnetic ] ) , we obtain magnetic fields @xmath142 compared to the cases with no backreaction ( [ final ] ) , the amplitude is reduced by the factor @xmath143 for the flat spectrum @xmath81 , we can deduce magnetic fields at the end of inflation as @xmath144 without backreaction , we anticipated @xmath145 g for the scale invariant case @xmath81 .",
    "however , by taking into account the backreaction , we have a suppression factor @xmath146 in ( [ main ] ) which is about @xmath147 .",
    "hence , we can expect at most @xmath148 g on mpc scales at present . for modes which exit the horizon after the transition time @xmath134 , by setting @xmath37 in ( [ u : ev ] )",
    ", we obtain @xmath149 where @xmath138 is now defined by @xmath150 .",
    "thus , we can calculate magnetic fields at the end of inflation as @xmath151     for the case @xmath81 .",
    "there exists a break at @xmath152 in the spectrum due to the backreaction .",
    "as can be seen , the amplitude of magnetic fields on mpc scales gets a suppression by @xmath147 due to this break . , width=359,height=264 ]    the resultant spectrum for @xmath81 is schematically depicted in fig.1 . as is expected , we have a flat spectrum on large scales before the backreaction becomes relevant .",
    "however , once the backreaction becomes important , the spectrum becomes blue .",
    "thus , after taking into account the backreaction , we realized that primordial magnetic fields on large scales from inflation can not be expected .",
    "we studied cosmological magnetic fields in an inflationary scenario . we have explained how the backreaction works in magnetogenesis in the inflationary scenario . in usual analysis , it has been assumed that the backreaction spoils inflation . however , there is no justification for this assumption .",
    "hence , we have incorporated the backreaction into the analysis and reanalyzed the production process of magnetic fields from inflation . as a consequence",
    ", we have shown that inflation still continues after the backreaction becomes important . in spite of this fact , it turned out that creation of primordial magnetic fields is still significantly suppressed due to the backreaction .",
    "the main point is that the energy density of electric fields have to grow in order to have sufficient amplitude for magnetic fields , which causes the backreaction .",
    "what we have found is that the backreaction changes the dynamics of inflaton and , as a consequence , makes the genesis of magnetic fields difficult .",
    "however , inflation is not spoiled by the backreaction . instead , an anisotropic inflationary universe has been created due to backreaction .",
    "although magnetic fields are negligible , since the expansion of the universe is anisotropic , other interesting phenomenology such as the statistical anisotropy of primordial curvature perturbations can be expected  @xcite .",
