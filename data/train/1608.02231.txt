    "<S> ultra - relativistic heavy - ion collision ( hic ) generates very strong initial magnetic field ( @xmath0 ) inducing a vorticity in the reaction plane . </S>",
    "<S> the high @xmath1 influences the evolution dynamics that is opposed by the large faraday current due to electric field generated by the time varying @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the resultant effects entail a significantly large directed flow ( @xmath2 ) of charm quarks ( cqs ) compared to light quarks due to a combination of several favorable conditions for cqs , mainly : ( i ) unlike light quarks formation time scale of cqs , @xmath3 is comparable to the time scale when @xmath0 attains its maximum value and ( ii ) the kinetic relaxation time of cqs is similar to the qgp lifetime , this helps the cq to retain the initial kick picked up from the electromagnetic field in the transverse direction . </S>",
    "<S> the effect is also odd under charge exchange allowing to distinguish it from the vorticity of the bulk matter due to the initial angular momentum conservation ; conjointly thanks to its mass , @xmath4 , there should be no mixing with the chiral magnetic dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> hence cqs provide very crucial and independent information on the strength of the magnetic field produced in hic .    * </S>",
    "<S> pacs * : 25.75.-q ; 24.85.+p ; 05.20.dd ; 12.38.mh    the properties of the hot and dense phase of matter referred to as quark - gluon plasma(qgp ) expected to be produced in nuclear collisions at relativistic energies are governed by light quarks and gluons  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the heavy flavors namely , charm and bottom quarks play crucial roles in probing the qgp  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the special role of cqs as a probe of the qgp resides on the fact that their mass , @xmath5 is significantly larger than the typical temperatures ( @xmath6 ) achieved in qgp and the qcd scale parameter ( @xmath7 ) , @xmath8 , i.e. the production of heavy quarks is essentially limited to the primordial stage of a heavy - ion collision with a formation time @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the probability of cqs getting annihilated or created during the evolution is much smaller compared to light quarks and gluons . as a consequence cqs witness the entire space - time evolution of the system and </S>",
    "<S> can act as an effective probe of the created matter .    </S>",
    "<S> the two main experimental observables related to cqs which have been extensively used as qgp probes are : ( i ) the nuclear suppression factor , @xmath10 which is the ratio of the @xmath11 spectra of heavy flavored hadrons ( d and b ) produced in nucleus + nucleus collisions to those produced in proton + proton collisions and ( ii ) the elliptic flow , @xmath12 , a measure of the anisotropy in the angular distribution that corresponds to the anisotropic emission of particles with respect to the reaction plane . in the present work we demonstrate that the directed flow @xmath13 of cqs is a superior probe to estimate the magnetic field generated in non - central hics .    </S>",
    "<S> several theoretical efforts have been made within the ambit of fokker planck  @xcite and relativistic boltzmann transport approaches  @xcite to calculate @xmath14  @xcite and @xmath15  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> essentially all the models show some difficulties in simultaneously describing the @xmath16 and @xmath17 and such a trait is not only present at rhic but also appears in a stronger way at lhc energy . </S>",
    "<S> however it has been shown in ref.@xcite that a drag nearly constant or slightly rising with t in the range of @xmath18 is able to simultaneously describe @xmath19 and @xmath20 at least at rhic energy , while at lhc energy it still remains uncertain also due to the large experimental error bars ( see  @xcite ) .    in recent years </S>",
    "<S> it has been recognized that a very strong magnetic field is created at early times in heavy ion collisions  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the impact of the magnetic field was explored mainly in relation to the chiral magnetic effect @xcite , but also to jet energy loss @xcite as well as on thermal photon and dilepton productions @xcite , and very recently on the cq diffusion coefficients @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the estimated values of the initial field strengths , @xmath21 and @xmath22 at rhic and lhc energies respectively , which is several orders of magnitude higher than the values predicted at the surface of magnetars . since the cqs are produced at the early stage of hics , we argue that their dynamics will be affected by such a strong magnetic field and they will be able to retain these effects till its detection as @xmath23 mesons in experiments . the @xmath0 field generated in non - central hics is dominated by the @xmath24-component which induces a faraday current in the @xmath25 plane . in particular due to the expansion along the @xmath26 axis the lorentz force is directed along the negative ( positive ) @xmath27 direction in the forward ( backward ) rapidity region for positively ( negatively ) charged quarks . </S>",
    "<S> this can be seen as a classical hall effect that generates a directed transverse flow . </S>",
    "<S> in addition to the hall effect the time dependence of @xmath0 generates a large electric field due to faraday effect which is expressed as , @xmath28 . the induced faraday current opposes the drift due to the magnetic field . the combination of the two effects result in a finite @xmath2 .    to study quantitatively the global dynamics of cqs we solve the relativistic langevin equation in an expanding qgp background . </S>",
    "<S> in this work the initial conditions for solving the langevin equation for the cqs and the relativistic transport code for the background are constrained by the experimental data on the @xmath19 and @xmath15 of @xmath23 meson  @xcite and the transverse momentum spectra and the elliptic flow of the bulk , see  @xcite for more details . </S>",
    "<S> the dynamics of the cqs in the qgp is largely determined by the drag coefficient @xmath29 that we have set to a weak @xmath6 dependence in the interval @xmath30 according to ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite that , as mentioned above , has been shown to provide a reasonably good descriptions of @xmath16 and @xmath17 for d meson at rhic and lhc collisions . </S>",
    "<S> the initial condition for the bulk in the transverse @xmath31-space is taken from the glauber model assuming boost invariance along the longitudinal direction . the value of the maximum temperature in the center of the fireball at the initial time , @xmath32 fm / c is set as @xmath33 mev . </S>",
    "<S> the initial spatial and momentum distributions of the cqs are set respectively by the @xmath34 and the fonll scheme of the charm production in proton+proton collisions  @xcite at the same @xmath35 .    </S>",
    "<S> the determination of the electromagnetic field generated in ultra - relativistic hic has been intensively studied in the recent years @xcite . in the present work we aim to make the first study on the impact of the electromagnetic field on heavy quark dynamics under the assumption of a constant electrical conductivity ( @xmath36 ) of the qgp . </S>",
    "<S> this will enable us to obtain analytic solutions , highlight the core physics and avoiding further numerical complications . </S>",
    "<S> we refer to  @xcite for the details of the space - time dependent solutions of @xmath37 and @xmath1 ( see also  @xcite ) . with the @xmath26 and @xmath38 axes along the beam and impact parameter directions </S>",
    "<S> respectively the @xmath0 generated in non - central hic will point along the @xmath39 axis on the average , _ </S>",
    "<S> i.e. _ @xmath40 while the other components , @xmath41 . the electric field , @xmath42 due to faraday effect will align along the @xmath38 axis .    </S>",

    "<S> @xmath47 the @xmath48 and @xmath49 signs indicate the spectators moving along @xmath48 and @xmath49 @xmath26 directions respectively and the total magnetic field is the sum of @xmath50 generated by @xmath51 point - like charges as  @xcite [ totby ] e b_y & = & -z_-^ d _ x_in()^x_out( ) d  _ -( ) + & & ( eb^+_y ( , , , ) + eb^-_y ( , , , ) ) , where @xmath52 is the azimuthal angle , @xmath53 is the proper time , @xmath54 the space - time rapidity , and @xmath55 and @xmath56 are the endpoints of the @xmath57 integration regions that define the crescent - shaped loci where one finds protons either moving @xmath48 or @xmath49 @xmath26 directions but not both . </S>",
    "<S> these are given by [ xpm ] x_in / out( ) = (  ) + , where @xmath58 is the radius of the nucleus , and @xmath59 is the impact parameter of the collision . </S>",
    "<S> the main ingredient of eq.([totby ] ) is the magnetic field @xmath60 at an arbitrary space - time point @xmath61 generated by a single charge located at @xmath57 moving in the @xmath62 direction with velocity @xmath63 . </S>",

    "<S> the @xmath71component of the electric field produced by the charges moving along @xmath48 z direction can be obtained as : [ esingle ] e e^+_x ( , , , ) = e b^+_y ( , , , ) ( y_b- ) , which again has to be convoluted with the transverse charge distribution @xmath72 as for the magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> the other components of the electromagnetic field averaged over initial conditions will vanish . </S>",
    "<S> however , it is has been shown in  @xcite that the large fluctuations in event by event central collisions ( not of interest here ) can generate other components of the fields with magnitudes comparable to @xmath73 and @xmath74 . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , in principle one should also include the electromagnetic field generated by the participant protons , however , it has been shown in @xcite that its magnitude is sub dominant especially in the initial stage that plays the leading role for the directed flow considered here .     and @xmath74 fields for @xmath75 in @xmath76 collisions at @xmath77 for @xmath78 at @xmath79 . </S>",

    "<S> the electric field vanishes at this position due to symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> we observe a rapid decrease of @xmath73 especially at central space rapidity @xmath89 . </S>",
    "<S> an important factor for sizable directed flow is certainly the fact that cqs are produced in the early stage . </S>",
    "<S> in fact in this region the @xmath73 reduces by about an order of magnitude between @xmath90 to @xmath91 . in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1 ] ( lower panel ) we depict the time dependence of both @xmath73 ( solid dark line ) and electric field @xmath92 ( light solid line ) along the direction of the beam with @xmath93 , @xmath83 . </S>",
    "<S> we note that for @xmath94 there is a large difference between the @xmath73 and @xmath74 , although they become equal at later time . </S>",
    "<S> we will see that this plays an important role in determining the sign and the size of the directed flow @xmath95 .    </S>",
    "<S> the dynamics of the cqs , with charge @xmath96 and momentum @xmath97 , is governed by the langevin equation in the presence of electromagnetic field , given by t&= & + t & = & -t+ * f*t+ * f*_extt , [ eq.le ] where the first term represents the dissipative force and the second term represents the fluctuating force @xmath98 regulated by the diffusion coefficient @xmath99 , see below . the third term in eq .

    "<S> we study the evolution with a standard white noise ansatz for @xmath98 , _ i.e _ @xmath100 and @xmath101 . the ensemble @xmath102 denotes the averaging of many trajectories for @xmath97 each consisting of different realizations of @xmath103 at each time step . to solve the langevin equation for an expanding system one needs to move to the local rest frame of the background fluid @xcite , where an element moving with velocity @xmath104 with respect to the laboratory frame will be subjected to both @xmath105 and @xmath106 as determined by lorentz transformations . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath107 in the fluid rest frame will be _ ext & = & q*e * + *p * where @xmath108 is the energy of the heavy quark with momentum @xmath97 .    in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2 ] we show the resulting directed flow @xmath2 as a function of the rapidity of charm black ( solid ) line and anti - charm quarks ( dashed ) line . </S>",
    "<S> we can see that there is a substantial @xmath2 at finite rapidity with a peak at @xmath109 . </S>",
    "<S> the flow is negative for positive charged particle ( charm ) at forward rapidity which means that the hall drift induced by the magnetic field dominates over the displacement caused by the faraday current associated with the time dependence of the magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> this is a non trivial result and it is partially due to the fact that the formation time of cqs is very close to the time at which the magnetic field attains its maximum , causing a large drift due to hall effect . </S>",
    "<S> we have followed the dynamics up to @xmath110 , but observed that the directed flow saturates already at @xmath111 for @xmath112 , and at @xmath113 for @xmath114 ( fig.[fig2 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the slope @xmath115 is determined in the very early stage of the collision @xmath116 . </S>",
    "<S> the time scale of the saturation of @xmath2 as a function of @xmath117 follows the persistence of the @xmath73 and @xmath74 fields with increasing @xmath81 shown in fig.[fig1 ] ( upper pannel ) .     as a function of the rapidity in @xmath76 collision at @xmath118 for @xmath119 for d meson [ @xmath120 black ( solid ) and anti - d meson [ @xmath121 ( dashed ) line at @xmath122 ( see text ) . </S>",
    "<S> red dash - dot ( blue dash - dot - dot ) line indicates @xmath2 of @xmath23 meson at @xmath123 ( @xmath124 ) . ]    </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the @xmath2 , in particular its slope @xmath125 , is mostly formed in the very early stage and its sign and magnitude is essentially controlled by the large value of @xmath73 for @xmath126 . </S>",
    "<S> the predicted value of @xmath95 for d meson [ @xmath120 is quite large and the odd behavior of @xmath127 doubles the effect that can be measured , also it would be a distinctive signal of the electromagnetic field , distinguishable from the @xmath95 that can be generated by angular momentum conservation as studied in @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> it is important to stress that there is another feature of the cqs that turns out to favor the formation of a sizable directed flow . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , the relaxation time of cqs can be estimated as @xmath128 which is much larger than the light quark and gluon equilibration time , @xmath129 . </S>",
    "<S> we have observed that if we artificially increase the drag @xmath130 by a factor 5 to enforce early thermalization of the cqs then the magnitude of @xmath95 turns out to be smaller by an order of magnitude . </S>",
    "<S> this indicates two important general physical aspects behind the build - up of @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> the first is the importance of considering the strength of the cqs scattering rate with that correctly reproduce the measured @xmath19 . </S>",
    "<S> the second aspect is more general and tells us that the signal of @xmath2 is kept largely intact also because the relaxation time of cqs is comparable with the lifetime of the qgp . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , one can expect that for light quarks the @xmath2 will be damped due to their smaller relaxation time . </S>",
    "<S> certainly the strength of the electromagnetic field is important to have a sizeable transverse flow , but the underlying dynamics is more subtle . in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3 ] we display the @xmath95 as a function of @xmath117 that is generated if we switch off artificially the electric field and keep the action of the magnetic field on . </S>",
    "<S> we notice that in such a situation the @xmath95 ( light lines ) generated is much larger than the one displayed in fig.[fig2 ] .     with @xmath117 generated by the drift due to hall effect(@xmath131 , @xmath132 ) ( generated by faraday effect ( @xmath133 , @xmath134 ) in @xmath76 collision at @xmath118 for @xmath135 . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath95 for charm ( anti - charm ) is denoted by the solid ( dashed ) line . ]    </S>",
    "<S> we observe also that when only the electric field is considered the effect of the faraday current generates @xmath2 with opposite sign and a magnitude similar to the hall drift </S>",
    "<S> . therefore , the value of @xmath2 is not only decided by the magnitude of the fields , but depends critically on the balance between @xmath37 and @xmath1 fields . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , the magnitude of the magnetic hall drift , depending on the absolute magnitude of @xmath73 , is large at the formation time of the cqs . </S>",
    "<S> this entails a dominance of the hall drift that is kept till the end of the evolution . </S>",
    "<S> instead light quarks likely fail to feel the presence of the early high magnitude of @xmath136 due to their late formation . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , looking at fig.[fig1 ] ( lower panel ) and fig . [ fig3 ] it is straightforward to envisage that if the charged particles would be produced at @xmath137 or if the simulation of the dynamics starts at similar times then the electric and magnetic field nearly compensate their effects , consequently @xmath95 with smaller magnitude and opposite sign will be produced  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> we have also checked the impact of the electromagnetic field on @xmath19 and @xmath20 and found that the former are not altered by the electromagnetic force ; while an effect of the b - field on @xmath15 can come indirectly from the anisotropy induced in the bulk as conjectured in @xcite .    in summary , the present study suggests that @xmath2 of cqs can be considered as an efficient probe to characterize the evolving magnetic field determined by the electrical conductivity of the qgp in hic . </S>",
    "<S> our central focus has been to show that the electromagnetic field can generate a sizable @xmath2 for cqs and hence for d meson , thanks to several concurring favorable effects for this to happen . </S>",
    "<S> the formation time of cqs is of about @xmath138 that is when the intensity of the @xmath1 field is maximum , even more important aspect is that the dynamics at time @xmath139 is governed by the opposite action of @xmath74 and @xmath73 provides significant amount of net flow . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the cqs , due to their large relaxation time in contrast to light quarks , are capable of retaining the memory of the initial non - equilibrium dynamics more effectively and hence lending stronger signal of the early magnetic dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , a large number of light hadrons originate from the gluons , not directly coupled to the electromagnetic field . also in this respect cq would provide a much cleaner and direct probe of the magnetic field dynamics . all these favorable conditions largely overwhelm the small suppression of the lorentz force by a factor , @xmath140 due to their finite mass . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , for @xmath141 the cq dynamics is not significantly affected by the chiral dynamics , therefore , the splitting between charge and anti - charge would not mix with the chiral magnetic effect ( cme ) and/or with possible chiral vortex effect ( cve ) that can also generate a matter / anti - matter splitting @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> thus , cqs would provide an independent way to scrutinize and quantify the initial magnetic field which can in turn also contribute to a more quantitative assessment of the cme and cve . </S>"
