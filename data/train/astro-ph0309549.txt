    "wz  sge is the prototype of a class of cataclysmic variables that exhibit extreme characteristics : short orbital periods , extremely large dwarf nova outbursts , long outburst recurrence times , and low",
    " mass companion stars .",
    "wz  sge displays @xmath07.5 mag outbursts separated by @xmath023 decades and has a stellar mass ratio of 1325 : 1 with a companion star that is less than 0.11 @xmath2 and perhaps as low as 0.03 @xmath2 ( steeghs et al .",
    "2001 , ciardi et al .",
    "these extreme characteristics make wz  sge an ideal proving ground for accretion disk theory .    among the many challenges wz  sge offers",
    "is the origin of the rapid 27.87  s and 28.96  s oscillations .",
    "first seen in the optical by robinson , nather & patterson ( 1978 ) , these oscillations have been detected in the uv ( welsh et al .",
    "1997 , skidmore et al .",
    "1999 ) , infrared ( skidmore et al .  2002 ) and in the x - ray ( patterson et al .",
    "1998 ) , though weakly .",
    "the oscillations are complex , with large changes in amplitude , phase jitter , and transient signals at nearby periods .",
    "sometimes both periodicities are present in the light curve .",
    "robinson et al .  ( 1978 ) proposed that the oscillations are due to non ",
    "radial @xmath1mode pulsations of the white dwarf , a hypothesis supported by the simultaneous presence of the incommensurate 27.87  s and 28.96  s periodicities .",
    "further support comes from analogy with gw  lib , a cataclysmic variable that almost certainly is a _ bona fide _ pulsating white dwarf ( van zyl et al .",
    "2000 , szkody et al .",
    "2002 ) .",
    "an alternative hypothesis , proposed by patterson ( 1980 ) , attributed the oscillations to a magnetized white dwarf channelling the accretion flow .",
    "the white dwarf s rotation provides the stable clock driving the 27.87  s fundamental periodicity .",
    "the other complex , transient oscillations are due to reprocessing of radiation in the accretion disk ( see patterson et al .",
    "1998 for more details ) .",
    "wz  sge would then be a member of the dq  herculis ( or intermediate polar ) class of cataclysmic variables .",
    "the detection of a 27.87  s periodicity in _ asca _ observations added much support to this magnetic accretor model .",
    "however , despite the success of this `` oblique rotator '' model in other cataclysmic variables , the presence of the simultaneous incommensurate periodicities in wz  sge remains an obstacle for this interpretation .    in their investigation of quasi ",
    "periodic oscillations in cataclysmic variables , warner & woudt ( 2002 ) developed the `` low inertia magnetic accretor '' ( lima ) model and this yields a third possibility for the origin of the oscillations .",
    "the model contains two elements : ( i ) magnetically  controlled accretion onto a rapidly rotating belt on the white dwarf and ( ii ) a prograde travelling wave at the inner edge of the disk that produces a vertical thickening which acts as a site for reprocessing and can also occult part of the disk and/or white dwarf . in this scenario ,",
    "the 27.87  s periodicity arises from magnetic accretion onto the white dwarf , but unlike the dq  her model , the belt can slip on the white dwarf s surface and hence the oscillation can vary in phase , amplitude and even period quite naturally .",
    "the 28.96  s signal comes from the reprocessing of the 27.87  s signal by the travelling wave whose orbital period is @xmath0740  s. while the model can satisfactorally explain the periodicities , and perhaps even the enigmatic @xmath015  s quasi  periodic oscillation ( qpo ) discovered by knigge et al .  ( 2002 ) , no other dwarf nova shows persistent qpos in quiescence , requiring wz  sge to be unique in this regard .    understanding the nature of the periodicities in wz sge is important not only for its own sake , but because of the implications for accretion disk physics in general . due to its extreme outburst characteristics ,",
    "wz  sge is believed to have a low mass  transfer rate from its companion star ( e.g.  osaki 1996 ) . yet",
    "this alone is insufficient to allow accretion disk models to match the outburst size and timescale .",
    "one solution requires that the accretion disk have a `` hole '' at its center ( lasota et al .",
    "this inner disk region may be evacuated by ( i ) a magnetic field , as in the dq  her stars where the white dwarf s magnetic field truncates the inner disk ( warner et al .",
    "1996 ; lasota et al .",
    "1999 ) ; or ( ii ) evaporation via a `` siphon '' into a hot corona ( meyer & meyer ",
    "hofmeister 1994 ) .",
    "this coronal siphon mechanism has properties related to adaf mechanisms in black - hole accreting systems ( e.g.  mineshige et al .  1998 ,",
    "hofmeister & meyer  2001 ) .",
    "another solution requires the quiescent viscosity in wz  sge s accretion disk to be very low : @xmath3 , compared to a more typical value of @xmath4 in `` normal '' accretion disks ( e.g.  smak 1993 ; osaki 1996 ; meyer ",
    "hofmeister , meyer & liu 1998 ) .",
    "if wz  sge can be shown to be a dq  her  like system , then the `` universality '' of the viscosity parameter is preserved and no seemingly _ ad hoc _ low value for @xmath5 is necessary .",
    "on the other hand , if wz  sge is a white dwarf pulsator , then either the coronal siphon must be operating and we have a white dwarf analog of a black hole accretion disk , or an anomalously low viscosity is required .",
    "either way , understanding the nature of the oscillations in wz  sge can have an important impact on our understanding of accretion disks .    in 2001",
    "july wz  sge went into outburst , 23 years after its previous outburst ( see patterson et al .",
    "2002 for extensive coverage of the 2001 outburst ) .",
    "sion et al .",
    "( 2003 ) obtained _ hubble space telescope ( hst ) _ observations of wz  sge on the decline from outburst and in this paper we present a time series analysis of those same data .",
    "these observations provide compelling evidence against a simple white dwarf non  radial @xmath1mode pulsation interpretation of the oscillations .",
    "as part of the director s discretionary time , wz sge was observed with the _ hst _ at four epochs : 2001 september 11 , october 10 , november 10 , and december 11 .",
    "each observation lasted approximately 39 min , just under half of the 81.6 min binary orbital period .",
    "the uv light was probably dominated by emission from the heated white dwarf from october to december ; in september the disk contribution may have been substantial and spectral decomposition into disk and white dwarf emission is much less certain ( sion et al .",
    "see figure 1 in long et al .",
    "( 2003 ) for the outburst light curve and the placement of the september , october and november hst observations .",
    "the _ hst _ _ stis fuv mama _ detector was used in _ time - tag _ mode with a wavelength coverage of 1140  1735   ( see sion et al .",
    "2003 for additional information regarding the observations ) .",
    "data reduction was carried out with the standard pipeline software .",
    "the data were cast into 2  s or 5  s time bins then binned over wavelength into a single uv light curve at each epoch .",
    "the september observation took place just prior to the minimum before the final re  brightening ( or `` echo outburst '' ) of wz sge s slow and erratic decline .",
    "the light curve shows large amplitude rapid flickering ; a rms variation of 10.5% of the mean flux ( 21.8  mjy ) was present .",
    "in contrast , the october , november and december light curves show much less flickering , with variations only slightly above the noise level . figure  1 shows the four light curves , with respect to the start time of each observation .",
    "the mean uv flux dropped by a factor of 2.4 between the september and december observations .",
    "figure 2 shows the power spectrum at each epoch , after prewhitening the light curves with a sliding boxcar average of width @xmath0146  s. since the duration of the light curves were short and therefore the frequency resolution poor ( @xmath6 hz , or formally equivalent to a period resolution of only 0.36  s at 28.96  s ) , the power spectra were oversampled by a factor of 2 , so only every other bin is independent .",
    "the power density is normalized such that a sinusoid of amplitude @xmath7 gives a power of @xmath8 . in all four cases , a spike consistent with the previously known 28.96  s periodicity is present .",
    "henceforth we shall refer to this feature as the p29 signal .",
    "the period and amplitude of the p29 signal were determined via least  squares sine fitting .",
    "table 1 lists the observed characteristics of the p29 signal .",
    "the luminosity of the p29 signal dropped by a factor @xmath04.5 between september and october , but thereafter remained fairly constant . in flux units ,",
    "the amplitude changed from @xmath00.42  mjy in september to @xmath00.09  mjy in october  december , while the fractional amplitude dropped from @xmath01.9% to @xmath00.9% .",
    "the p29 luminosity experienced a larger decrease than the mean uv luminosity , suggesting that p29 responds more quickly to changes in the global mass accretion rate than the mean system .",
    "one possible explanation is that the long cooling time of the white dwarf keeps the mean system luminosity well above its quiescent value ; indeed in december wz  sge was still much brighter in the uv than when in quiescence .",
    "the 27.87  s periodicity was not detected , nor was the @xmath015  s quasi ",
    "periodicity seen by knigge et al .",
    "( 2002 ) in _ hst _ uv observations earlier in the outburst . however , a broad feature near 18  s is present in the september observations which we identify as a quasi  periodic oscillation ( qpo ) .    in fig .",
    "3 we show the september observations in more detail .",
    "the power spectrum was recomputed using only a linear detrending , thus the rapid rise in power at low - frequencies due to flickering remains present .",
    "3 also shows the mean light curve and the amplitude ( from the square root of the power ) of the p29 and qpo periodicities .",
    "the p29 and qpo amplitudes were computed from short segments of the light curve , each 118  s in duration .",
    "fifty such segments were used ; they are not independent , having 61% overlap between them .",
    "the frequency resolution of such short light curves is very poor so the power spectrum was oversampled by a factor of 4 . after removing the white noise background ,",
    "the power was summed over the intervals 27.833.7  s for the p29 signal and 16.919.7  s for the qpo signal .",
    "the flickering red noise background remains present in these bandpasses , so these amplitudes are still somewhat biased high ; the uncertainties in the amplitudes are roughly half the values of amplitudes themselves .",
    "the most noticeable features of the amplitudes are their rapid variations and lack of correlation with the mean light curve or each other .",
    "no periodicity in p29 or qpo amplitude is apparent .",
    "it is interesting to note that despite the p29 signal being present at 4 epochs spanning 3 months , the signal can vary from being quite strong to undetectable in a span of less than a few hundred seconds .",
    "long  term stability is present while short  term stability is not .",
    "although hard to quantify , the amplitude of the qpo is roughly 0.31  mjy or 1.4% of the mean system brightness .",
    "if only a single sinusoid is fit to the broad qpo signal , an amplitude of 0.27  mjy ( 1.3% ) at a period of 17.95  s is measured .",
    "the relationship , if any , between this weak qpo and the much stronger @xmath015  s and @xmath06.5  s qpos seen 20 days earlier in the outburst ( knigge at al .",
    "2002 ) is unclear .",
    "based on the same _ hst _ uv spectra as used in this work , sion et al .",
    "( 2003 ) measured the white dwarf s temperature decline from 29,000  k in 2001 september to 18,000  k in december .",
    "although some of the lines used in the analysis seem unusually narrow , the interpretation of a cooling white dwarf is fairly secure based on the success of the models in matching the observations , in particular the continuum and broad ly @xmath9 absorption .",
    "further evidence of an elevated white dwarf temperature comes from the lack of strong quasi ",
    "molecular h@xmath10 or c  i absorption lines that are prominent in quiescence .",
    "nevertheless , the interpretation that the white dwarf completely dominates the uv spectrum at these epochs is not fully established . if we omit the september observations on the presumption that the accretion disk contributes significantly to this uv spectrum there still remains a 5000 k drop in white dwarf temperature between october and december .",
    "the uncertainties in these temperature estimates are roughly 10% , though the errors are largely systematic rather than statistical .",
    "a similar change in white dwarf temperature was deduced from analysis of _ far ultraviolet spectroscopic explorer ( fuse ) _",
    "observation by long et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , with temperatures dropping from @xmath025,000  k to @xmath022,600  k between september 29 and november 8 .",
    "part of the difference in estimated white dwarf temperature between the non  simultaneous _ hst _ and _ fuse _ spectra comes from the uncertainty in the contribution of the disk to the total spectrum . nevertheless the trend",
    " a substantial cooling of the white dwarf  seems secure .",
    "outburst cooling of the white dwarf has been well - documented in other dwarf novae , e.g. , in vw  hyi ( gnsicke & beuermann 1996 , sion et al .",
    "1995 ) , u  gem ( sion et al .",
    "1998 ) , and al  com ( szkody et al .  1998 ) .    because of its critical importance in the interpretation to come , we repeat the statement in godon et al .",
    "( 2003 ) regarding the temperature of the white dwarf in wz  sge .",
    "the temperature increase of the white dwarf , due to the enhanced accretion during outburst , is not confined to a thin outermost layer .",
    "such a layer would very quickly radiate away heat gained during the outburst and therefore would remain at an elevated temperature only while substantial accretion is present",
    ". however , compressional heating takes place deeper in the star ( though still in the outer layers ) and takes months to cool , as is the case in wz  sge ( sparks et al .",
    "so while irradiation from the boundary layer and inner disk heats the surface of the white dwarf , compression gets under the white dwarf s skin ( sion  1995 , 1999 ) .",
    "thus the dwarf nova outburst accretion episode , which dumps on the order of @xmath11 of matter onto the white dwarf ( godon et al .",
    "2003 ) , produces a deep and significant heating of the white dwarf s envelope .",
    "before we present the primary conclusion of our investigation , we briefly summarize the plausibility of the pulsation hypothesis .",
    "the original , and in some ways still best , argument in favor of the white dwarf pulsation hypothesis is the observed simultaneous presence of the incommensurate p28 and p29 periodicities ( robinson et al .  1978 ) .",
    "incommensurate periodicities are common for the zz ceti class of stars ( isolated non  radial @xmath1mode pulsating white dwarfs ; see kepler & bradley 1995 for a good review of white dwarfs and pulsation ) .",
    "also , the white dwarf in gw  lib is known to exhibit zz  ceti  type pulsations ( van zyl et al .",
    "2000 ; szkody et al .",
    "2002 ) . additional support , albeit weak , comes from the uv spectrum of the oscillations that are consistent with a white dwarf photospheric origin ( skidmore et al .  1999 ,",
    "welsh et al .",
    "1997 ) .",
    "yet the zz ceti stars ( and gw  lib ) have much longer periods ( hundreds of seconds ) than wz sge .",
    "furthermore , the quiescent temperature of the white dwarf in wz  sge , @xmath014,600  k ( cheng et al .  1997 , godon et al .",
    "2003 ) , exceeds the nominal upper temperature limit ( the `` blue edge '' ) of @xmath013,500  k of the instability strip for zz ceti stars .",
    "however , more massive white dwarfs have a hotter `` blue edge '' than the canonical 0.6 @xmath2 white dwarf ( bradley & winget 1994 ; bergeron et al .  1995 ;",
    "giovannini et al .",
    "1998 ) and recent studies do in fact suggest wz  sge has a massive white dwarf , exceeding @xmath00.8 @xmath2 and perhaps even as high as 1.2 @xmath2 ( steeghs et al .  2001 ;",
    "skidmore et al .",
    "2000 ; knigge et al .  2002 ; long et al .",
    "2003 ; godon et al .",
    "2003 ) . by linearly extrapolating the blue edge temperature versus mass presented in giovanninni et al .",
    "1998 , a @xmath1mode pulsating white dwarf with a temperature of 14,600  k would require a white dwarf mass @xmath12 , barely within acceptable mass estimates .",
    "however , the extrapolation to values above @xmath13 is highly uncertain so this crude mass limit should be taken as nothing more than a statement that @xmath1mode pulsations can not be ruled out by quiescent white dwarf temperature arguments . furthermore , as was suggested by szkody et al .",
    "( 2002 ) for gw  lib , it could be that the temperature determined for wz  sge is a global average , and a cooler region could be responsible for the pulsations  for gw  lib , a two  temperature white dwarf model fits substantially better then a one temperature model .",
    "note that the thickness of the surface convective zone responsible for the pulsations in wz  sge should be very thin compared to other zz  ceti stars since the timescale of the periodicity depends on the depth of the base of the convective zone ( e.g.  see bergeron et al .",
    "1995 )  fast periodicities require a shallow convective zone .",
    "skidmore et al .  ( 1999 ) extrapolated the observed temperature  period relation of zz  ceti stars using the data in clemens ( 1993 ) and found the extrapolation falls tantalizingly close to the quiescent temperature and period of wz  sge .",
    "this bolstered the viability of the white dwarf pulsation hypothesis , and mitigated the objection that the 28  s and 29  s periods are too short to be related to the zz ceti phenomenon .",
    "we re - examined this extrapolation of figure 2 of clemens ( 1993 ) and while the _ observed _ temperature  period relation for zz ceti stars does project close to wz  sge , the _ theoretical _ relation makes a dramatic drop to very fast periodicities at temperatures just higher than the observed zz  ceti star temperatures . from figure 3 of clemens ( 1993 ) , for a temperature of 14,600  k the thermal timescale at the bottom of the ionization zone where the pulsations are generated ( which should be approximately equal to the observed periodicity )",
    "is on the order of only 0.01  s. there are large uncertainties in both the theory and observed temperatures , so this 0.01  s timescale should not be overinterpreted , but the conclusion remains thus : extrapolation of the observed temperature  period relation of zz  ceti stars to the wz  sge regime can not be trusted .",
    "however , we can be confident that if wz  sge is a non  radial @xmath1mode pulsator , it should follow , at least crudely , the _ trend _ of the temperature  pulse period relation for isolated white dwarf pulsators : hotter surface temperatures stars have shorter periods and smaller pulsation amplitudes ( clemens 1993 ) .    given the significant and deep heating of the white dwarf s envelope discussed in  4.1 , it would be astounding if the periods of any non - radial @xmath1mode pulsations in wz  sge did not change substantially as the white dwarf s temperature changed . yet in this work we have shown the continued presence of the 29  s periodicity while the white dwarf cools by over 10,000 k. during the outburst decline , wz  sge no longer lies near the extrapolated empirical zz  ceti period  temperature relation and , more importantly , _ the observed period of the p29 oscillation is independent of the white dwarf s temperature .",
    "_ these observations therefore rule out non ",
    "radial @xmath1mode pulsations of the white dwarf as the _ sole _ origin of both the 28  s and 29  s pulsations .",
    "having claimed the observations of the p29 oscillation herald the end of the simple non ",
    "radial @xmath1mode pulsation hypothesis , we are now left with a challenge : can the observations be interpreted within the framework of the magnetically  channelled accretion flow models ?    patterson ( 1980 ) proposed the magnetic oblique  rotator model for wz  sge ( i.e.  the dq  her  type scenario ) based on the stability of the 27.87  s oscillation and the ability to match some of the complex sideband structure in the power spectrum ( the `` satellite periods '' ) with simple integer multiples of the orbital frequency . in this model",
    "the rotation of the white dwarf provides a stable clock that produces the primary 27.87  s oscillation while the accretion disk provides ( transient ) structures that reprocess the primary signal .",
    "cheng et al .",
    "( 1997 ) measured a rapidly rotating white dwarf ( @xmath14 km s@xmath15 in quiescence ) supporting the magnetic rotator model , though this rotational velocity has not been confirmed with post ",
    "outburst observations . as patterson et al .",
    "1998 showed , this fast rotation requires a high  mass ( 0.81.1@xmath2 ) white dwarf if the period of rotation of the white dwarf is 28  s. finally , the presence of a periodicity at 27.86  s in _ asca",
    "_ 26  kev light curves , along with a weaker signal in the 0.42   kev band ( one half cycle out of phase ) , lends considerable support for the dq  her interpretation ( patterson et al .",
    "lasota et al .",
    "( 1999 ) expand upon the dq  her model and suggest that the rapidly spinning white dwarf actually ejects most of the matter transferred from the secondary star via a magnetic propeller .",
    "the p29 signal is caused by reprocessing of the p28 signal by blobs at the _",
    "outer _ edge of the disk .",
    "a prediction of the model is that the white dwarf can not be massive ( @xmath16 ) , potentially a serious problem if recent estimates suggesting a massive white dwarf are correct .",
    "the lima model of warner & woudt ( 2002 ) is similar in spirit to the dq  her model of patterson ( 1980 ) , but has added flexibility : the periodicities are not tied to the white dwarf s rotation , but instead to a thin belt on the white dwarf . since the belt contains much less inertia than the white dwarf , significant short timescale changes in rotation rate are possible . in this model the belt itself amplifies the white dwarf s magnetic field , allowing a white dwarf with very low magnetic field strength to channel the accretion flow .",
    "one particularly attractive feature of the model is that the vertical thickening at the inner disk can also explain the `` dips '' seen in wz  sge s light curve .",
    "while the model seems very promising for the dwarf nova oscillations ( dnos ) and qpos seen in other cataclysmic variables , wz  sge presents more of a challenge . for all other systems",
    "the dnos are present only in outburst , while in wz  sge the dno signal , p28 , is often present in quiescence and seems to have disappeared during the outburst .",
    "the p28 signal is not present in outburst ( e.g. patterson et al .",
    "1981 ; knigge et al .",
    "2002 ; this work ) , and remained hidden for nearly 18 years after the 1978 outburst . in the standard dq  her scenario , the lack of the p28 oscillation during outburst can be explained by the greatly enhanced mass accretion rate ( see patterson et al .",
    "1998 ) : the ram pressure of the accreting gas overwhelms the magnetic pressure and effectively crushes the magnetosphere back onto the surface of the white dwarf and accretion takes place along the equator , not at the magnetic poles .",
    "the magnetic field is too weak to channel the accretion flow during outburst , hence the photometric modulations vanish .",
    "even when deep in quiescence , observations do not always show the p28 signal ; this is a puzzle .",
    "when present , the p28 signal maintains long  timescale clock  like stability , though short ",
    "term phase and amplitude changes are frequent .",
    "inhomogeneities in the disk and or accretion flow must be such that the p28 signal is either not produced , hidden , or canceled for extended durations of time .",
    "patterson et al .  (",
    "1998 ) claim that sometimes when the p28 signal was absent other nearby periodicities that could be identified as sidebands of the p28 signal were observed , suggesting the p28 signal was present , just not detected .",
    "while the prolonged absence of the p28 signal after the 1978 outburst is not quite fully understood , a plausible reason exists , and the stability , sidelobes , and x  ray modulation can be interpreted , at least consistently , within the context of the dq  her model .",
    "as seen here and many times previously , the p29 signal can exhibit rapid changes in amplitude and phase on timescales as short as minutes ( e.g.  skidmore et al .",
    "1997 ) , yet the mean period is constant and on occasion the signal remains quite stable  perhaps even retaining phase coherence for up to a week ( patterson et al .",
    "the p29 signal exists throughout most of the dwarf nova eruption cycle : before , during and after the superoutburst  though perhaps not close to the peak of outburst ( knigge et al .",
    "the p29 signal does not correlate with the instantaneous luminosity of the system ( and hence the inferred instantaneous @xmath17  see fig .",
    "3 ) , though its amplitude is somewhat tied with the average brightness of the system on the decay from outburst . as we have shown in this work ,",
    "p29 is de - coupled from the white dwarf temperature .    as patterson ( 1998 ) stated , the p29 signal does not naturally appear as any known simple ratio or sum of periodicities in the system ( orbital or spin ) . in the dq",
    "her model , the p29 signal is created by the reprocessing of the p28 signal by some structure in the disk : p29 is the `` beat '' between p28 and a blob orbiting in the disk with a period of @xmath0740  s , most likely at the inner edge of the disk .",
    "similarly , in the lima model of warner & woudt ( 2002 ) , the p28 signal corresponds to a dno while the p29 signal corresponds to a qpo , created by the reprocessing of the dno signal .",
    "while a periodicity of 741  s has been detected in wz  sge s light curve ( warner & woudt 2002 ) , it is very rare , and the dno driving signal ( i.e.  p28 ) was not present at that time .    in the dq  her model , the p28 period remains constant during outburst since it is maintained by the rotation of the entire white dwarf .",
    "in contrast , on the rise to outburst the period of the p29 signal should increase as the radius of the reprocessing inner disk shrinks , and the signal disappear entirely when the disk reaches the white dwarf . as the disk hole ( i.e.  magnetosphere ) re",
    " opens during the outburst decline , the p29 oscillation should re  appear and decrease back to its quiescent period .    in the lima model , the dno period should decrease as more and more angular momentum is accreted into the belt during the rise to outburst .",
    "the p29 ( qpo ) signal would also experience a period change , for two reasons : it is being driven by the faster dno and the inner radius of the disk where reprocessing is occurring is shrinking . on the decline from outburst , the periods should increase . a strong period ",
    "luminosity relationship through the outburst should exist , as is the case for dnos of other systems ( see woudt & warner 2002 and references therein ) .    in both magnetic accretor scenarios ,",
    "the p29 signal should vary during the outburst .",
    "yet as we have shown here , this is not the case in wz  sge : the p29 signal remains constant in period on the decline from outburst , and with the same period it has in quiescence .",
    "in fact , just the presence of the p29 signal in the absence of the p28 signal during the outburst decay presents a significant problem for the magnetic accretor models . in the dq  her model , if the magnetosphere is crushed onto the white dwarf thereby quenching the p28 signal , the inner edge of the disk is now coincident with the white dwarf s surface .",
    "so not only is there no inner disk region to reprocess any modulation , there is no modulation to reprocess . and yet the p29 signal is quite strong , stronger in fact than in quiescence , at least in the 2001 september observations . as in the dq  her model , the lima model requires the presence of the dno at 28  s to drive the qpo at 29  s. the complete absence of the p28 signal in the observations presented here is vexing .",
    "we clearly do not understand the mechanism producing the p29 signal .",
    "the continued presence of the p29 signal during the outburst decay , as the disk reforms and the mass accretion rate and white dwarf temperature dramatically change , suggests that a clock of exceptional ( long  term ) stability is involved .",
    "the most immediate candidate is the rotation of the white dwarf , but how this could work is not at all apparent . we conclude that while the rotating magnetic accretor models remain viable , they are sorely incomplete .",
    "we present ultraviolet light curves of the dwarf nova wz  sge as it declined from its 2001 july superoutburst .",
    "the observations were made with the _ hst _ stis and were obtained on 2001 september , october , november and december .",
    "the well  known 28.96  s periodicity was present at all four epochs , but the 27.87  s periodicity was absent .",
    "we also note the appearance of a qpo with period @xmath018  s in the september light curve .    between 2001",
    "september and december the temperature of the white dwarf dropped from @xmath030,000  k to @xmath018,000  k ( sion et al .  2003 ) .",
    "we argue that by analogy with the zz  ceti stars , the white dwarf non  radial @xmath1mode pulsation model for the origin of the 27.87  s and 28.96  s periodicities ( robinson et al .",
    "1976 ) demands a large change in the pulsation period as the white dwarf s temperature changes .",
    "however , these observations do not support this prediction : the 29  s oscillation period is observed to be independent of the white dwarf s temperature .",
    "we consider this the _ coup de grace _ of the non  radial @xmath1mode pulsation hypothesis as the _ sole _ origin of both the 28  s and 29  s pulsations .    in light of these observations , the alternative hypotheses for the origin of the periodicities , the venerable dq  her magnetic rotator model ( patterson 1978 ) and the lima model of warner & woudt ( 2002 ) , do not fare particularly well either . in these models",
    "the 28  s periodicity is related to rotation of either the entire white dwarf or an accretion belt on the white dwarf .",
    "the 28  s modulation is ultimately responsible for driving all the other periodicities including the 29  s modulation .",
    "the presence of a relatively strong 29  s periodicity in the total absence of the 28  s periodicity is a problem for the models .",
    "while the models remain viable , they must be considered incomplete . finally",
    ", we remark that while non  radial @xmath1mode pulsations can not be responsible for the oscillations in wz  sge , this does not necessarily imply that other modes of white dwarf pulsation are ruled out . in particular , the periods of non  radial @xmath18modes ( papaloizou & pringle 1978 ) can be near those of wz sge and are not very temperature sensitive so they may play a role in wz  sge s puzzling behavior .",
