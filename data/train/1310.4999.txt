    "bursts of immediate breakings triggered by damage sequences are analogous to acoustic outbreaks in loaded specimens .",

    "the global acceleration of the dynamics that can be observed in fig .",
    "[ fig : timeseries ] is the consequence of the increasing load on the intact part of the system due to subsequent load redistributions , while the fluctuations of the burst size @xmath2 and waiting time @xmath3 emerge due to the quenched heterogeneity of fibers strength in qualitative agreement with experiments @xcite .    in order to quantify how the accelerating dynamics appears on the microscale we determined the rate of bursts @xmath5 as a function of the distance from the critical point @xmath6 .",

    "perfect agreement can be observed in fig .",
    "[ fig : omori_illesztes]@xmath7 between the simulated data and the analytic form of equation ( [ eq : omori ] ) . in the case of earthquakes ,",
    "the omori law describes the decay rate of aftershocks following major earthquakes @xcite . for creep rupture",
    "we observe the inverse process : considering the macroscopic failure as the main shock , the breaking bursts are foreshocks whose increasing rate is described by the ( inverse ) omori law .    as a crucial point , our approach makes it posssible to clarify how the characteristic time scale @xmath10 of the omori law emerges : fig.[fig : omori_illesztes]@xmath12 illustrates that due to the increasing load on intact fibers shorter and shorter damage sequences are sufficient to trigger bursts .",
    "however , this acceleration is limited such that for @xmath13 the average length of damage sequences @xmath14 saturates between @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "the origin of this high susceptibility is that the load of intact fibers @xmath15 gradually increases to its quasi - static critical value @xmath16 ( see fig.[fig : omori_illesztes]@xmath12 ) @xcite .",
    "hence , the omori time scale @xmath10 is determined by the condition @xmath17 , where @xmath16 can be obtained from the quasi - static constitutive equation of fbms @xcite .",
    "note that the condition @xmath18 marks the point of instability where the avalanche can not stop anymore and it becomes catastrophic .",
    "[ fig : omori_illesztes]@xmath7 also demonstrates that the saturation rate @xmath9 does not depend on the external load @xmath19 , however , the characteristic time scale @xmath10 linearly increases @xmath20 , indicating that at higher load saturation sets on earlier .",
    "our simulations revealed that the omori exponent is @xmath21 , it does not depend on any details of the damage law @xcite such as the @xmath22 exponent and the disorder distributions until the load redistribution is long ranged .",
    "the event rate @xmath5 is practically the inverse of the average waiting time between events occurring at time @xmath23 .",
    "more detailed characterization is provided by the probability distribution of waiting times @xmath24 which is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : waiting_time ] corresponding to the system of fig .",
    "[ fig : omori_illesztes ] . along the distributions",
    "two characteristic time scales can be identified : for waiting times below a threshold @xmath25 , the distributions have constant values , while in the limit of large waiting times @xmath26 a rapidly decreasing exponential form is obtained .    for the intermediate regime",
    "@xmath27 the waiting time distributions exhibit a power law behavior @xmath28 where the exponent proved to be universal @xmath29 . increasing the external load @xmath19 the upper cutoff @xmath30 decreases",
    ", however , the lower characteristic time @xmath31 is independent of @xmath19 . since the temporal occurrence of events",
    "is determined by the global increase of the breaking probability due to the increasing load on intact fibers , the above results suggest that the time evolution of crackling noise of heterogeneous materials undergoing creep rupture can be described as a non - homogeneous poissonian process ( nhpp ) . for nhpp",
    "the waiting time distribution of a series of @xmath32 events with duration @xmath33 can be obtained analytically from the event rate as @xcite @xmath34    to verify the consistency of the nhpp picture for our creeping system , first we fitted the event rate functions by the omori law determining the value of the parameters @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 .",
    "then the analytic form equation ( [ eq : omori ] ) of @xmath5 with the numerical parameters was plugged into equation ( [ eq : wait_nhpp ] ) and the integral was calculated numerically taking into account the load dependent lifetime @xmath35 of the sample @xcite , as well . in fig .",
    "[ fig : waiting_time ] an excellent agreement can be observed between the waiting time distributions obtained from the simulations @xmath36 and the analytic prediction @xmath37 of equation ( [ eq : wait_nhpp ] )",
    ". an important consequence of the above results is that the lower cutoff @xmath31 of @xmath36 can be obtained from the saturation event rate @xmath38 , which does not depend on the external load .",
    "the upper cutoff @xmath30 is determined by the other time scales as @xmath39 . inserting the basquin law of creep life @xmath40 reproduced by our model @xcite and",
    "the linear load dependence of it follows that the upper cutoff @xmath30 scales with the external load as @xmath41 .",
    "the results show that details of the damage process control the global time scale of rupture , however , they do not affect the omori and waiting time exponents .",
    "power law distributions of interoccurrence times in fracture phenomena are usually considered to be the fingerprint of correlations between consecutive events @xcite .",
    "our analysis revealed that for creep phenomena this is not necessarily true , the global acceleration of a heterogeneous system can lead to power law distributed inter - event times without any local correlations .",
    "the comparison of theoretical results to the experimental findings and different types of measurements to each other can be problematic because in laboratory experiments the time series of bursts is never complete : small size bursts generate only low amplitude signals which may fall in the range of background noise @xcite .",
    "devices also have a finite time resolution resulting in a deadtime of detection , during which bursts generated at different positions in space can not be distinguished from each other @xcite .",
    "incompleteness of the time series , especially in field observations , may also be caused by the fact that recording does not start exactly at the time when the load was set .",
    "hence , the beginning of the time series is missing and the measurement is more focused on the vicinity of the failure point where intensive crackling occurs @xcite .    in order to capture the effect of the detection threshold of the measuring equipment in the data evaluation , we introduced a threshold value @xmath42 for the size of bursts @xmath2 , i.e. bursts with size @xmath43 are ignored in the time series .",
    "since the size of bursts increases when approaching global rupture ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : timeseries ] ) , the detection threshold removes events typically at the beginning of the time series decreasing the rate of events in this regime .",
    "it can be observed in fig.[fig : omori_hatter]@xmath7 that as @xmath42 increases the functional form of the event rate @xmath44 remains nearly the same described by the omori law equation ( [ eq : omori ] ) , however , the exponent @xmath11 monotonically increases with the threshold value @xmath42 . for the corresponding waiting time distributions @xmath45 in fig.[fig : omori_hatter]@xmath12",
    ", the exponent @xmath46 of the power law regime also increases with increasing @xmath42 , however , the nhpp nature of the event series is preserved at any values of @xmath42 . for nhpps",
    "the two exponents @xmath46 and @xmath11 have the simple relation @xcite @xmath47 which holds with a high accuracy in our system for the numerically determined exponents at any values of @xmath42 ( see fig.[fig : omori_hatter]@xmath48 ) .",
    "it is important to emphasize that the exponents increase due to the non - stationary nature of creep rupture : the simultaneous increase of the rate and size of events towards failure has the consequence that the finite detection threshold mainly affects the beginning of the time series resulting in a few long waiting times up to the first bigger bursts .",
    "their statistics is characterized by a peak or small bump in fig.[fig : omori_hatter]@xmath12 , while the rest of waiting times have a steeper power law distribution .",
    "the results demonstrate that the detection threshold has a dramatic effect on the outcomes of the analysis of crackling time series , just varying @xmath42 practically any values can be obtained for the waiting time exponent @xmath46 between @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "the finite time resolution @xmath49 of the detectors has the consequence that bursts pile up , i.e. since bursts can not be distinguished within the duration @xmath49 , the size of bursts sums up giving rise to larger event sizes in the time series .",
    "the effect of the deadtime is captured in the data evaluation such that if an avalanche of size @xmath50 occurred at time @xmath51 , all those avalanches which appeared in the interval @xmath52 are added to @xmath50 . in fig.[fig : holdido_dist]@xmath7 at zero deadtime @xmath53 where all avalanches are distinguished the size distribution @xmath54 has a power law form @xmath55 followed by an exponential cutoff . the value of the exponent @xmath56 is equal to the usual mean field burst exponent of fbms @xcite .",
    "as @xmath49 increases the pile up of bursts promotes large events while the small ones get suppressed . due to the acceleration of the failure process",
    "pile - up gets dominating in the vicinity of macroscopic failure , hence , in fig.[fig : holdido_dist]@xmath7 the value of @xmath49 is compared to @xmath31 of the waiting time distribution . as a consequence ,",
    "the waiting time distributions hardly change , however , the burst size distribution @xmath57 has a crossover to a power law of a significantly lower exponent @xmath58 showing the higher frequency of large events in the statistics . in fig.[fig : holdido_dist]@xmath7 pile up becomes dominating already at @xmath59 , which shows the importance of the results for real experiments .",
    "recently , laboratory experiments on earth materials have revealed that the b - value , i.e. the exponent of the probability distribution of the energy of the time series of acoustic events of rupture cascades decreases in the vicinity of failure @xcite . to investigate the possibility of an analogous phenomenon in creep rupture",
    ", we constrained the data evaluation to events occurring in a time interval of duration @xmath60 preceding macroscopic failure and determined the probability distribution @xmath61 .",
    "it can be observed in fig .",
    "[ fig : holdido_dist]@xmath12 that approaching macroscopic rupture @xmath62 , where the largest avalanches are triggered , the burst size distribution @xmath61 exhibits a crossover : at a characteristic burst size @xmath63 the exponent of @xmath61 has a striking change from @xmath56 to a surprisingly low value @xmath64 .",
    "the value of @xmath63 extends to the largest avalanche as @xmath65 decreases .",
    "the crossover is accompanied by the change of the waiting time distribution , as well : since in the regime @xmath62 the event rate is constant , the power law regime of @xmath66 disappears and the distribution turns to a pure exponential as it is expected for homogeneous ( constant event rate ) poissonian processes @xcite .",
    "acoustic outbreaks generated by nucleating and propagating cracks provide the main source of information on the microscopic temporal dynamics of creep rupture . for the understanding of acoustic monitoring data of engineering constructions and of field measurements on steep slopes or rock walls in mountains",
    "requires the application of statistical physics .",
    "our analysis showed that time - to - failure power laws of macroscopic quantities such as creep rate commonly observed in experiments are accompanied by the emergence of omori type acceleration of the bursting activity on the microscale .",
    "the origin of the omori time scale is that the aging system drives itself to a critical state where a few breakings are sufficient to trigger extended bursts .",
    "the omori law is known to describe the relaxation of the rate of aftershocks following major earthquakes @xcite , and it has also been confirmed for foreshocks when observed @xcite .",
    "our results suggest the interpretation that acoustic bursts in creep behave like foreshocks of the imminent catastrophe .",
    "our investigations unveiled that the evolving time series of crackling events is the result of an underlying non - homogeneous poissonian process .",
    "it has the striking consequence that observing power law distributed waiting times in fracture may not imply the presence of dynamic correlations , up to a large extent it can be caused by the global acceleration of the system .",
    "we showed that special care should be taken when comparing results of model calculations to measurements on crackling noise , since the deadtime of devices and the finite background noise to signal ratio can even affect the measured value of critical exponents .",
    "varying solely the detection threshold of events , for the distribution of waiting times any exponents can be obtained between @xmath0 and @xmath1 covering the range of experimental results @xcite . due to the finite deadtime of electronics bursts pile up which gives rise to a crossover to a lower exponent of the size distribution of bursts .",
    "recently , avalanches have been identified with a high spacial resolution along a propagating crack front using optical imaging techniques @xcite .",
    "considering global avalanches in the same experiment integrates bursts along the front , giving rise to a significantly lower exponent in agreement with our predictions @xcite .",
    "components of engineering constructions are mainly subject to creep loads @xcite , and creep rupture often lies at the core of natural catastrophes such as landslides , snow and stone avalanches , as well @xcite",
    ". we demonstrated that restricting the measurement to the close vicinity of ultimate failure , the size distribution of bursts exhibits a crossover to a significantly lower exponent , which is accompanied by the change of the functional form of the waiting time distribution .",
    "since the crossover is controlled by the time scale of the omori law these results can be exploited for forecasting the imminent catastrophic failure event .",
    "here we focused on the case of long range load redistribution following failure events .",
    "when the load sharing is localized the spatial correlation of failure events leads to the emergence of a propagating crack front .",
    "the load accumulated along the crack front gives rise to an overall acceleration of the failure process again with a non - homogeneous poissonian character .",
    "however , at short time scales correlated clusters of events may arise inside the time series .",
    "the results imply the interesting question to clarify when studying burst time series under creep whether there is anything in the dynamics beyond non - homogeneous poissonian processes .",
    "we use a generic fiber bundle model @xcite of the creep rupture of heterogeneous materials which has succesfully reproduced measured creep behavior @xcite .",
    "the sample is discretized in terms of a bundle of @xmath67 parallel fibers having a brittle response with identical young modulus @xmath68 .",
    "the bundle is subject to a constant external load @xmath19 below the fracture strength of @xmath69 the system .",
    "it is a crucial element of the model that the fibers break due to two physical mechanisms : immediate breaking occurs when the local load @xmath70 on fibers exceeds their fracture strength @xmath71 , @xmath72 .",
    "time dependence is introduced such that those fibers , which remained intact , undergo an aging process accumulating damage @xmath73 @xcite .",
    "the rate of damage accumulation @xmath74 is assumed to have a power law dependence on the local load @xmath75 of fibers @xmath76 , where @xmath77 is a constant and the exponent @xmath22 controls the time scale of the accumulation process .",
    "fibers can tolerate only a finite amount of damage so that when the total damage @xmath73 accumulated up to time @xmath23 exceeds a local damage threshold @xmath78 the fiber breaks .",
    "the two breaking thresholds @xmath79 and @xmath78 , @xmath72 of fibers are independent random variables which are for simplicity uniformly distributed between @xmath80 and @xmath0 . after each breaking event the load dropped by the broken fiber",
    "is equally redistributed over the remaining intact ones @xcite .",
    "the separation of time scales of slow damage and of immediate breaking leads to the emergence of a bursty evolution of the system : damaging fibers break slowly one - by- one , gradually increasing the load on the remaining intact fibers .",
    "after a certain number of damage breakings the load increment becomes sufficient to induce the immediate breaking of a fiber which in turn triggers an entire burst of breakings . as a consequence , the time evolution of creep rupture occurs as a series of bursts corresponding to the nucleation and propagation of cracks , separated by silent periods of slow damaging .",
    "the size of burst @xmath2 is defined by the number of fibers breaking in a correlated trail , while the waiting time @xmath3 between consecutive events is the duration of the damage sequence of @xmath81 breakings which triggers the next event .",
    "macroscopic failure occurs in the form of a catastrophic avalanche at time @xmath33 which defines the lifetime of the system @xcite .",
    "our model reproduces the basquin law of creep life , i.e. the lifetime @xmath33 decreases as a power law of the external load @xmath40 , where the exponent coincides with the exponent of damage accumulation @xmath22 @xcite .",
    "computer simulations were carried out in our fbm with @xmath82 fibers averaging over @xmath83 samples for each parameter set except for fig .",
    "[ fig : timeseries ] where intensionally a small bundle of @xmath84 fibers were considered .",
    "the exponent @xmath22 of the damage law mainly sets the global time scale of the evolution , hence , the simulation results are presented only for @xmath85 .",
