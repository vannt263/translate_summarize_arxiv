    "* ) and the inventory of dust mineral composition , organic materials , water abundances , ices , and gas content in the planet forming regions is now routinely determined from remote sensing spectrophotometry obtained by the nasa _",

    "however , the process by which micron - sized dust grains , volatile ices , and gas coalesce , aggregate , and grow leading to large planet - sized bodies is not well understood . within our solar system , the main belt and near - earth asteroids ( neas ) , are relics from the epoch of planet - building @xcite . these objects can be statistically surveyed to characterize the size - frequency distribution , related to the evolution of planetesimals the solar system , to determine the albedo distribution , a measure of compositional gradients extant at the epoch of planet building , and to constrain models of solar system evolution ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "we re - analyze the asteroid photometry from iras and msx with the standard thermal model and the more recent near earth asteroid thermal model to derive revised albedo and diameter estimates for asteroids detected in these surveys .",

    "the iras catalog was produced for asteroid sightings in iras survey data @xcite .",
    "the flux catalog consists of 12 , 25 , 60 , and 100   photometric data of varying qualities for 9244 asteroid sightings . in this catalog , the data quality flags ( dqf )",
    "range from values of 1 ( low - quality ) to 5 ( high - quality ) , the latter dqf value denoting asteroids detected a minimum of twice in a given iras photometric bandpass .",
    "we selected all asteroids from the iras catalog with a dqf value of 3 or greater , and with reported fluxes in either three or four iras bandpass for analysis .",
    "these selection criteria produce a catalog of 5940 sightings of 1425 individual asteroids .    the msx sightings catalog @xcite contains 325 individual sightings of asteroids .",
    "data quality from msx is not flagged ; therefore , our msx selection criterion accepts all asteroids for which fluxes in either three or four bands are reported for a given single sighting .",
    "this results in a dataset of 185 sightings of 92 individual asteroids .",
    "table  [ table : csac_tab ] , the criteria - selected asteroid catalog ( csac ) , summarizes all asteroids extracted from the iras and msx catalogs .",
    "the entire table is available in an one - line electronic compilation .      to determine the albedos and diameters of asteroids present in iras and msx data , we have utilized both the standard thermal model ( stm ; * ? ? ? * ) and the near earth asteroid thermal model ( neatm ; * ? ? ?",
    "we used these models to generate a best - fit spectral energy distribution ( sed ) from all flux measurements simultaneously obtained at a given epoch for each asteroid in our csac database .",
    "our approach differs from the methodology employed by @xcite where albedos and diameters were determined in each observation band and then averaged for the reporting of a  bulk \" albedo .",
    "the stm and the neatm commonly used to obtain diameters and albedos of asteroids from mid - infrared ( ir ) photometry incorporate a variety of assumptions , the validity of which can be tested given extensive and reliable observational data .",
    "briefly , we highlight the assumptions of each model with particular emphasis on how model assumptions influence the derivation of diameters and albedos .",
    "the stm @xcite is the model used for the analysis of iras data by @xcite .",
    "this model assumes that : an asteroid is a perfect sphere ; the asteroid temperature distribution is function of angular distance from the sub - solar point ; the ir flux scales linearly in magnitudes with phase angle ; and the thermal flux from an asteroid only arises from the illuminated `` day - side '' of an asteroid .",
    "the stm also invokes use of a fixed parameter , @xmath2 , referred to as the beaming parameter .",
    "the value of @xmath2 is chosen such that the diameters of asteroids ceres and pallas derived from ir observations of @xcite are equivalent to those determined from stellar occultation experiments ( i.e. , direct measures ) .",
    "the @xmath2 parameterization accounts for surface roughness and thermal inertia , tacitly assuming that all asteroids have a similar surface characteristics , and presupposes that all compositions have the same thermal inertia .",
    "the thermal distribution assumed for the stm is defined as    @xmath4^{\\frac{1}{4 } } \\times [ cos ( \\omega)]^{\\frac{1}{4 } } \\label{eqn : stm_e}\\ ] ]    where the temperature , t is in kelvin , a is the geometric bond albedo , s@xmath5 is the solar constant ( w  m@xmath6 ) , r@xmath7 is the heliocentric distance ( au ) , @xmath8 is the emissivity of the object ( assumed to be 0.9 ) , @xmath9 is the stefan - boltzmann constant , and @xmath10 is the angular distance from the sub - solar point .    because the stm does not provide good fits to neas , @xcite introduced the neatm model .",
    "the neatm assumes an asteroid is a perfect sphere , the temperature distribution on the asteroid is a function of both latitude and longitude , the asteroid has a spin axis perpendicular to the sun - earth plane , and only the  day - side \" of the asteroid contributes to the thermal flux .",
    "this model does not scale the thermal flux as a function of phase angle , rather it numerically calculates the actual thermal flux detected from the illuminated portion of a smooth sphere visible at a given phase angle .",
    "the neatm also utilizes a beaming parameter ( @xmath2 ) , but rather than treating it as a fixed value the model defines @xmath2 as a measure of deviation from a smooth body with zero thermal inertia . as a free parameter , @xmath2 is best - fit simultaneously with the geometric albedo of a target .",
    "the object thermal distribution assumed for the neatm is :    @xmath11^{\\frac{1}{4 } }   ( cos \\phi)^{\\frac{1}{4 } } ( cos \\theta)^{\\frac{1}{4 } }   \\label{eqn : neatm_e}\\ ] ]    where @xmath12 is the latitude , and @xmath13 is longitude .",
    "all other variables in this relation are defined as in eqn .",
    "[ eqn : stm_e ] .",
    "our implementation of the stm and the neatm fits the observed photometric data using the downhill simplex method of chi - squared minimization @xcite .",
    "the asteroid diameters are derived from the relation of @xcite ,    @xmath14    where @xmath0 is the geometric albedo and h is asteroid absolute magnitude for both models .",
    "values for h are taken from the minor planet center ( mpc ) .",
    "many h - values have significantly changed and updates have been made to mpc compilations since the original dates of the iras and msx publications ( e.g. , table  [ table : csac_tab ] ) .",
    "those objects detected with signal - to - noise ratios @xmath15 have their fluxes over predicted by the iras point source extraction routines @xcite ; however , these flux overestimates are linear with respect to signal - to - noise ratio and can be corrected with a multiplicative factor . the point source extracted fluxes ( columns labeled `` flux '' ) , the multiplicative flux correction factor ( columns labled `` flux correction '' ) , and overestimate corrected fluxes ( columns labeled `` corrected flux '' ) are reported in the csac .",
    "we also utilize the color corrections published for iras and msx @xcite ; these color corrections are calculated in 10 degree bins .",
    "we do not color correct the iras photometry based on the sub - solar temperature .",
    "instead , we apply the color correction using the mean temperature of the illuminated face of the asteroid which allows the asteroid to have a non - zero thermal inertia ( e.g. , dependent on surface properties , rotational periods ) .",
    "the effective blackbody temperature of the asteroid seds utilizing the iras fluxes for a given sighting are cooler ( i.e. , the seds peak near 25  ) than that of the sub - solar temperature inferred for the effective heliocentric distance .",
    "therefore , we calculate the mean temperature ( from the temperature distribution defined in each model ) as a proxy for the effective temperature of the object for the purposes of color correction .",
    "use of the sub - solar temperature for the color correction is especially problematic for the neatm fits to asteroid photometry , as the adoption of a sub - solar temperature for the color correction introduces a somewhat simplified first order assumption regarding the thermal inertia of the body ( i.e. , the body has zero thermal inertia such that it is in instantaneous equilibrium with the radiation field ) , and hence complicates interpretation of the derived values of @xmath2 .",
    "our approach is a departure from the @xcite methodology results which utilize the sub - solar temperature for color corrections .",
    "table  [ table : flux_color_fixed ] reports example orbital parameters and fluxes utilized interatively in the thermal model fitting of iras data after : ( 1 ) flux overestimation corrections have been applied to iras point source fluxes ( table  [ table : csac_tab ] ) ; and ( 2 )  mean temperature analysis ( an intermediate interative modelling step ) color corrections are applied to the observed fluxes .",
    "geometric albedoes and diameters derived from using the mean temperature color corrected fluxes in each model are also provided in this table .",
    "entries in table  [ table : flux_color_fixed ] should enable corroboration of our methodology . the entire table is available in an one - line electronic compilation .",
    "the @xmath16 minimization fitting of the asteroid photometric data from the stm and the neatm do not yield formal errors for each fit parameter . to determine the uncertainty of the albedo , diameter , and where applicable @xmath2 derived from the models , a monte carlo code was utilized in conjunction with the observed photometry to create 100 synthetic asteroid sightings per sighting for each body in table  [ table : csac_tab ] .",
    "the 100 synthetic sightings retained the orbital information such as heliocentric ( @xmath17 ) and geocentric distance ( @xmath18 ) , but varied the photometric flux within the photometric uncertainties cited in each of the original source catalogs for a given asteroid .",
    "results of our model fits with monte carlo simulation of the photometric uncertainty is presented in table  [ table : mc_sum ] .",
    "this table contains both the stm and the neatm albedo and diameter determinations for each sighting . in the",
    "solutions catalog entries for which the stm solutions did not converge are marked with a value of -1000.0 in the albedo , albedo error , diameter , and diameter error columns .",
    "mean albedo and diameter values for asteroids from msx and iras are reported in our ancillary on - line catalog , whose format and example entries are given in table  [ table : on_line_examp ] .",
    "all subsequent analysis , discussion , and conclusions in this manuscript are based on the data in table  [ table : on_line_examp ] .",
    "comparison of our stm results with those in previously published studies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , indicate that the albedos obtained using an ensemble of four simultaneous measured photometric bands are systematically bluer than those determined from the mean of single channel ( i.e. , single photometric band ) albedos .",
    "the offset between the mean single channel albedos and simultaneous ensemble albedos is 12% of as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : ensem_v_single ] .",
    "the neatm fits of asteroid albedo yield an albedo distribution for the main belt asteroids that are redder and narrower than the solutions from the stm .",
    "this effect is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : hist_n_s ] , a histogram distribution of the derived geometric albedos of each model .",
    "the mean albedo for asteroid neatm fits is @xmath0(neatm mean)@xmath1 while the mean albedo for the stm solutions is @xmath0(stm mean)@xmath19 .",
    "canonically , the mean albedo adopted for main belt asteroids is 0.11 @xcite .",
    "comparison of the albedos we have derived for individual objects cataloged in both the iras and msx databases , to those estimated through use of either the iras or msx observations alone differ with a dispersion of @xmath20 4% , fig .  [",
    "fig : ivn_fig ] .",
    "though many asteroids have multiple iras sightings , most of these sightings are separated by minutes .",
    "this observational cadence does not allow one to obtain infrared light curves for asteroids whose rotational periods have timescales of hours to days .",
    "the majority of asteroids sighted in the msx catalog have photometry for only a single sighting , thus the photometry of these targets is not as robust as the observations from iras .",
    "shape and inhomogeneous surface compositions as well as flux measurement errors could also account for the observed dispersion between the iras and msx albedos .",
    "independent best - fits seds generated using the stm and the neatm to the identical asteroid photometric datasets can yield very disparate results for derived diameters and albedos . for example , the nea 1627  ivar was observed in the ir by @xcite . the solutions for this target using the stm and the neatm yield geometric albedos ranging from 0.05 to 0.20 , corresponding diameters between 9.12  km to 7.94  km respectively .",
    "the radar derived effective diameter @xcite of ivar is 8.5  km .",
    "the validity of thermal models fits to the iras photometric data of @xcite is difficult to assess as the model - estimated diameters of ceres are not equivalent to the occultation - derived determinations .",
    "this discrepancy is problematic as the stm model was optimized with a beaming parameter @xmath2 set to 0.756 for the large asteroids ceres and pallas which may have thermal characteristics that are distinct from the general asteroid population @xcite .",
    "the derived diameters for the largest asteroids observed by iras apparently are systematically low due to the use of `` band - to - band '' albedo corrections @xcite .",
    "the band - to - band correction is a multiplicative factor of 1.12 which is applied to 25 and 60   derived albedos such that their values come into agreement with those albedos derived from 12   photometry .",
    "derivation of the band - to - band correction is not clearly explained in either @xcite , @xcite , or @xcite , hence examination of the underlying assumptions ( e.g. , wavelength dependent @xmath2 ) and their overall validity is difficult .",
    "however , to test the general applicability of the @xcite invoked band - to - band corrections , we ran the stm on the single channel photometry at 12 , 25 and 60   and determined the mean difference between occultation and radar derived diameters ( many of which were not earlier extant ) to those derived from iras data . in this analysis we utilized occultation and radar derived diameters of 80 asteroids and find the mean difference between the occultation - derived diameters and the 12   only diameters was @xmath21% , and @xmath22% and @xmath23% for the 25 and 60   only diameters , respectively .",
    "this analysis suggests that use of a single channel albedo correction has highest fidelity when applied to iras 60   photometry .    to determine which thermal model ( either the neatm or the stm ) approach generates diameters that are commensurate with asteroid diameters determined by independent and/or direct measurement techniques ,",
    "we have compared object diameters in table  [ table : on_line_examp ] to those diameters established by radar or occultation observations .",
    "cross - correlation of catalog entries in the iras , radar , and occultation databases yields 118 asteroids for this inter - comparison , table  [ table : adtro ] .",
    "generally , the stm underestimates asteroid diameters by @xmath24% when compared to radar and occultation derived estimates , while the neatm underestimates diameters by @xmath25% as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : mods_v_ro_fig ] . in absolute terms ,",
    "application of the neatm approach yields refined diameters commensurate with radar and occultation measurements , fig .",
    "[ fig : neatm_radar_fig ] . however , there are moderate uncertainties ( @xmath26% ) in the formal error of the derived diameters quoted for many asteroids observed with either radar or occultation technique .",
    "thus , application of either the stm or the neatm approach to model ir asteroid photometry is reasonable with appropriate assumptions and caveats .",
    "the beaming parameter , @xmath2 , within the main belt asteroids follows an approximate gaussian distribution for the 1481 bodies in our sample population , fig .",
    "[ fig : eta_fig ] . the cut - off in the histogram distribution at values of @xmath27 and @xmath28",
    "are artifacts due to truncation criteria set within our code .",
    "the mean @xmath2 for asteroids is @xmath3 ( exclusive of those within the histogram bins at 0.75 or 2.75 ) .",
    "the smooth distribution of @xmath2 suggests that the beaming parameter is independent of asteroid properties such as composition .",
    "comparison of the derived asteroid beaming parameters as a function of @xcite taxonomic type indicates that @xmath2 for s - type and c - type asteroids are identical within the standard deviation of the population beaming parameters .",
    "@xcite assert , based on recent analysis of iras asteroid photometry , that the thermal inertia behavior of asteroids is a power - law function of diameter , with a break in the relationship occurring at size of @xmath29  km .",
    "@xcite speculate that this change in functional behavior may be due to differing regolith properties of small versus large asteroids .",
    "if regolith properties are size - dependent , trends in model - derived @xmath2 values should be apparent on our analysis .",
    "figure  [ fig : eta_diam_fig ] presents the beaming parameter fits as a function of asteroid diameter derived from the neatm modeling . for diameters",
    "@xmath30 100  km , @xmath2 has a fairly narrow range of values , @xmath31 .",
    "asteroids with smaller diameters have a much greater range of @xmath2 , and only asteroids with diameters less than @xmath29  km are values of @xmath2 significantly greater than 1.6 frequently apparent .",
    "the latter trend is consistent with the thermal inertia behavior suggested by @xcite .    whether or not the behavior of @xmath2 as a function of asteroid diameter is solely dependent on size and therefore unique requires that affects of size - dependent rotation rates are minimal .",
    "faster rotational periods also can give rise to increased @xmath2 depending on the pole orientation .",
    "figure  [ fig : diam_eta_period ] presents the period , diameter , @xmath2 surface for all asteroids in our survey which have tabulated rotational periods in the catalog of @xcite .",
    "there are no systematic trends or correlations between @xmath2 values and rotation periods for a given diameter .",
    "asteroids with high @xmath2 values ( @xmath32 ) are not required to be monoliths rather that rubble piles .",
    "the diameter discrepancies between the stm and the neatm confirm that use of a fixed beaming parameter @xmath33 in the stm is not valid , especially for those asteroids with diameters @xmath34 100 km .",
    "the diameters obtained by @xcite are commensurate with those we have derived using the neatm ( table  [ table : sn_v_delbo ] ) .",
    "hence the neatm appears to be the preferable model to invoke to derive diameters from photometry .",
    "our thermal model analysis of asteroid seds derived from simultaneous multi - band photometry enables quantitative assessment of the relative quality of albedo and diameter determined for asteroids that have only single photometric band ( i.e. , single - channel ) measurements .",
    "comparison of albedos derived solely from 12   photometry to those resulting from model fits to seds differ by @xmath35% , while the variance between 25   only albedo fits and seds estimates are @xmath36% .",
    "this discrepancy between albedo solutions may account for the distinct differences in our derived diameters and albedos ( table  [ table : on_line_examp ] ) compared to those previously published in the literature @xcite even though a band - to - band correction of the order 12% was applied to the 25 and 60   derived albedos from @xcite .",
    "however , the 12   only albedo fits are in better consonance with those derived from the ensemble sed model - fits because the 12   bandpass from iras is narrower than the 25   bandpass .",
    "although color corrections exist for all iras wavebands , constraining albedo by use of the 25   photometry is difficult as the bandpass is @xmath37 15   wide , and many albedo solutions can fit this single photometric point .",
    "asteroid albedos derived from msx photometry show no clear divergence between the albedos determined from 4-channel simultaneous photometry ( sed modeling ) and albedos obtained using the 12 and 14   channels individually .",
    "however , use of either the shortest or longest wavelength photometry does produce discrepant albedo estimates : the 21   photometry yields a variance of @xmath38  10% , while the 8   produces an incongruity of @xmath38  54% compared to the sed derived values .",
    "the large differences in the derived albedos using the 8   photometry is most likely due to solution ambiguities arising from the steepness of the greybody curve on the wien side of the planck flux distribution and the 20% photometric uncertainty of the reported 8   flux densities .",
    "future all sky surveys , such as currently being conducted by the wise mission or those planned by pan - starrs @xcite or the large synoptic survey telescope @xcite , require a means to relate asteroid colors to albedos in order to assess the nea size , population , and earth impact threat . in the optical , the precise correlation of albedo and ( b - v ) color is uncertain .",
    "@xcite find two loci in albedo vs. ( b - v ) color , one clustering near ( albedo , b - v ) = ( @xmath39 ) , the other near ( @xmath40 ) which we can reproduce from asteroids albedos derived from our neatm models and their corresponding ( b - v ) colors derived from catalog entries curated at the planetary data system node @xcite . to break this degeneracy",
    "many of the newer asteroid surveys are expanding into the near - ir ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the bus - demeo taxonomy @xcite is the first system which extends asteroid taxonomy to the ir ( out to 2  ) .",
    "inspection of the neatm albedos for the bus - demeo taxonomic types ( table  [ table : demotax ] ) indicates that the s- and c - type complexes have relatively narrow ranges of albedo .",
    "the neatm albedo histogram distributions of asteroids with known bus - demeo s- , c- and x - type classifications is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : taxonomy_albedos ] .",
    "the neatm albedo values for these classes are lower in value than the stm derived albedos . the neatm albedo range best - matches the spectroscopically inferred compositions of s- and c - class asteroids as suggested by laboratory albedo measurements of ordinary chondrite and carbonaceous chondrite materials @xcite .",
    "possibly , observations of asteroids in photometric bands akin to the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) filter set , when extended into the near - ir , could provide a basic taxonomic classification of a newly discovered object reliable enough to obtain an asteroid diameter within @xmath24% .",
    "however , the veracity of this assertion can not be assessed as asteroids selected for our thermal analysis ( table  [ table : csac_tab ] ) are sufficiently large enough in size that they would have saturated the sdss images and are thus not present in their moving target catalog @xcite .",

    "<S> rectified diameters and albedo estimates of 1517 main belt asteroid selected from the iras and msx asteroid photometry catalogues are derived from updated infrared thermal models , the standard thermal model ( stm ) and the near earth asteroid thermal model ( neatm ) , and monte carlo simulations , using new minor planet center ( mpc ) compilations of absolute magnitudes ( h - values ) constrained by occultation and radar derived parameters . </S>",
