    "an interesting subject related to heavy ions isospin physics @xcite is the process leading to the equilibration of the charge / mass ratio between the main partners of the reaction as well described in ref.@xcite . the so called `` isospin diffusion '' phenomenon is the relevant mechanism acting between the reaction partners in binary processes@xcite . in particular , in the collision of the 124 and 112 tin isotopes at 50 mev / nucleon @xcite , evidence of partial equilibrium in the charge / mass ratios of the quasi - projectile and quasi - target has been deduced through the study of the iso - scaling parameters related to the isotopic distributions . in this case",
    "dynamical calculations based on the boltzmann - uehling - uhlenbeck model @xcite show that the degree of equilibration depends on the behavior of the symmetry potential @xmath1 as a function of the density .",
    "the analysis of the experimental data in this kind of studies is based on the linear relation between the iso - scaling parameter and the relative neutron excess @xmath2 of the emitting sources ( typical in several statistical models ) .",
    "it is also assumed that both quantities weakly depend on the secondary statistical decay processes . in general , as discussed in ref.@xcite , this last condition can be affected by the fragment excitation energies , ( or temperatures ) and by the distinctive features of the models used to simulate the secondary decay stage . in this work",
    "we want to extend the study of the isospin equilibration processes , looking at the whole system , by using the following quantity @xmath3 .",
    "the sum on the index @xmath4 is performed on all the @xmath5 protons of the system .",
    "@xmath6 corresponds , apart from the elementary charge @xmath7 , to the time derivative of the total dipole of the system .",
    "the velocities @xmath8 are computed in the center of mass ( c.m . )",
    "reference frame .",
    "several studies were based on this dynamical variable to describe pre - equilibrium @xmath9-ray emission ( see refs.@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "various reasons suggest us to use the same variable to also describe isospin equilibration processes .",
    "- ( i ) after the pre - equilibrium stage , starting from the time @xmath10 , when a second stage characterized by an average isotropic emission of the secondary sources ( statistical equilibrium ) takes place , the ensemble average of @xmath6 satisfies the following relation : @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "the average value of this dynamical variable at @xmath10 is in fact invariant with respect to statistical processes and therefore the value of @xmath12 is determined only by the complex dynamics which characterizes the early stage of the collision , when fast changes of the average nuclear density are expected . in particular , @xmath12 can be expressed as a function of the charge @xmath13 , mass @xmath14 , average multiplicity @xmath15 and the mean momentum @xmath16 of the detected particles having charge @xmath13 and mass a in the generic event : @xmath17 @xmath18 is the correlation function between the multiplicity and the mean momentum .",
    "this correlation function plays a key role for the invariance property and therefore requires for an event by event analysis in which many - body correlations can not be neglected .    for symmetry reasons , @xmath12 lies on the reaction plane .",
    "it is directly linked with a weighted mean of the charge / mass ratio , as eq.(1 ) suggests .",
    "it also takes into account the average isospin flow direction through the momenta @xmath19 .",
    "-(ii ) in the general case , we find attractive the following decomposition : @xmath20 where @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the average dipolar signals associated to the gas `` phase '' ( light charged particles ) and to the `` liquid '' part @xcite , corresponding to the motion of the produced heavy fragments .",
    "the signal @xmath23 is instead associated to the relative motion of the two `` phases '' . by supposing , for simplicity , that the gas `` phase '' is formed by neutrons and protons",
    ", @xmath12 can be further decomposed as : @xmath24 in the above expression the first term represents the contribution related to the neutron - proton relative motion of the gas `` phase '' expressed through the relative velocity @xmath25 ; the second term concerns the relative velocity @xmath26 between the centers of mass of the `` liquid '' complex and the `` gas '' ; the last term represents the contribution produced by the relative motion of the fragments .",
    "a similar expression can be obtained including others light particles in the gas `` phase '' as , for example , the intermediate mass fragments ( imf ) . from this decomposition",
    "we can see how the isospin equilibration condition ( @xmath27 ) , for the total system , requires a very delicate balance which depends on the average neutron excess ( @xmath28 ) of the produced `` liquid drops '' @xmath29 , on the one associated to the gas `` phase '' @xmath30 , and on the relative velocities between the different parts . to enlighten the role played by some of the terms reported in eq.(3 ) , we can discuss the idealized decay of a charge / mass asymmetric source through neutron and proton emission ( or the case in which the liquid drops are produced through a statistical mechanism @xmath31 ) .",
    "moreover , for simplicity , we can consider uncorrelated fluctuations between the velocities , masses and neutron excesses .",
    "in absence of pre - equilibrium emission or for identical colliding nuclei the second term of eq.(3 ) is zero ( @xmath32 ) , and the isospin equilibration requires a neutron or proton gas `` phase '' or absence of relative neutron - proton motion . for non- identical colliding nuclei , if pre - equilibrium emission exists , then @xmath33 . in this case , if @xmath34 , due , for example , to the isospin `` distillation '' phenomenon , the first term has to be necessarily different from zero and it will contribute to the neutron - proton differential flow ( see also sect.iii ) .",
    "therefore , according to our description , the understanding of the isospin equilibration process for the total system requires the gas `` phase '' contribution to be taken into account .",
    "this term can be regarded as a kind of `` dissipation '' with respect to the system formed by the liquid part . in this work , as an example , we will discuss the results obtained through the constrained molecular dynamics - ii approach ( comd - ii ) @xcite applied to the charge / mass asymmetric system @xmath0 at 40 mev / nucleon .",
    "the study is performed by using different options for the symmetry potential term . before to show the results of our calculations , in the following section we briefly recall the way in which the isospin interaction is introduced in comd - ii model .",
    "according to the results obtained in ref.@xcite , in the simple case of large and compact systems , the isospin dependent part of the interaction is expressed , in the so called non - local ( n.l . ) , approximation as : @xmath35 \\\\",
    "\\alpha ' & = & \\frac{1}{4}\\frac{\\partial^{2 } \\alpha}{\\partial \\beta^{2}}|_{\\beta=0}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath36 terms are neglected in the previous expression .",
    "@xmath37 represents the correlation coefficient related to the difference in the dynamics of the n - p couples with respect to the n - n and p - p ones .",
    "it is evaluated at @xmath38 and describes the main effect of the many - body correlations on the iso - vectorial interaction .",
    "@xmath39 depends on the average overlap integral per couples of nucleons @xmath40 which reflects the degree of compression .",
    "the coefficient @xmath41 determines the strength of the iso - vectorial interaction at the ground state density ( @xmath42 ) .",
    "f is a form factor which modulates the changes of the iso - vectorial interaction as a function of the average overlap integral @xmath43 . in particular for the stiff1 option we use @xmath44 , for the stiff2 case @xmath45 and for the soft option @xmath46 . from eq.(4 ) we note that the isospin forces if treated in a self - consistent many - body approach generates , beyond the @xmath47 dependent potential , also another iso - vectorial density dependent term , not proportional to @xmath47 , but proportional to the degree of correlation @xmath39 .",
    "as discussed in @xcite , at small asymmetries , this term determines the high sensitivity of the experimental observable to the different functional form of @xmath48 . the limiting case corresponding to vanishing values for the correlation @xmath39 represents the so called iso - vectorial mean field approximation ( i.m.f.a . ) . in this case",
    "the average overlap integrals per couple of nucleons related to neutron - neutron , proton - proton and neutron - proton interactions have the same values and the iso - vectorial interactions generate only the usual symmetry potential term which is proportional to @xmath47 ( see eq .",
    "4 ) . a comparison between results obtained by full comd - ii calculations and the one derived in the i.m.f.a .",
    "limit will be discussed in the next section .",
    "now we discuss the results concerning the isospin equilibration process for the @xmath0 system at 40 mev / nucleon . for this collision , as an example , in fig .",
    "1 we show the average total dipolar signals evaluated through comd - ii calculations along the @xmath49 beam direction @xmath50 and along the impact parameter direction @xmath51 , @xmath52 , respectively . the reference frame is the c.m . one .",
    "the impact parameter @xmath53 is equal to 3 fm , in panels ( a ) and ( c ) , and 1.5 fm in panels ( b ) and ( d ) . in fig.1(a ) and fig.1(c ) , the average dipolar signals are shown for the first 150 fm/@xmath54 .     for b=3 fm along the @xmath49 direction are plotted as a function of time in the intervals 0 - 150 fm / c ( panel ( a ) ) and 100 - 400 fm / c ( panel ( b ) ) .",
    "different lines indicate different options for the isospin interaction ( see the text ) .",
    "panels ( c ) and ( d ) display the average dipolar signals along the @xmath51 direction for b=1.5 fm and in the same time intervals like panels ( a ) and ( b ) respectively.,width=226 ]    different lines refer to different iso - vectorial potentials .",
    "the isospin independent compressibility is equal to 220 mev , according to ref .",
    "@xcite . in the first 150 fm/@xmath54",
    "we can see that in all the cases wide oscillations exist .",
    "they are responsible for the pre - equilibrium @xmath9-rays emission @xcite .",
    "the damped oscillations converge towards smaller and constant values ( within the uncertainty of the statistics associated to the ensemble average procedure ) .",
    "this can be seen in fig .",
    "1(b ) and fig .",
    "1(d ) in which the dynamical evolution is followed from 100 fm/@xmath54 up to 300 fm / c .",
    "the time interval in which the stationary behavior is reached is related to the life time of the coherent dipolar collective mode and it is strictly linked to the average time for the formation of the main fragments and pre - equilibrium emission . for the asymptotic components ,",
    "global results are shown in fig.2 .",
    "and @xmath50 evaluated for different value of the @xmath55 parameter ( see the text ) .",
    "different symbols indicate different options for the iso - vectorial interaction.,width=226 ]    they concern different impact parameters and different interaction options . in particular , in fig.3(a )",
    ", we show for @xmath53=3 fm the charge distribution evaluated after 650 fm / c for the stiff2 option .",
    "the shape of the distribution clearly show that at this impact parameter the mechanisms evolve essentially throughout a multi - fragmentation process . under the same conditions , we show in fig.3(b ) and in fig.3(c ) the ratio @xmath56 between @xmath49 asymptotic components of the dipolar signal related to the light particles ( first 2 terms of eq.(3 ) ) and the one associated to the two biggest fragment ( last term of eq.(3 ) ) .",
    "@xmath57 is plotted as a function of the reduced impact parameter @xmath58 ( @xmath59fm ) . in fig.3(b ) we can see that for central and mid - peripheral collisions the `` gas '' component ( pre - equilibrium contribution ) is comparable or larger than the one associated to the `` liquid '' one .",
    "fig.3(c ) shows that the relevance of the `` gas '' light particle signal rapidly decreases with the increasing of the impact parameter .",
    "as discussed in the introductory section when the collision partners are not identical nuclei the isospin equilibration process produce a neutron - proton differential flow contribution if the neutron and proton `` gases '' have different c.m .",
    "these pre - conditions are verified for the studied collision . for @xmath60 fm and for the stiff1 and soft options in fig.3(d ) we show the neutron - proton differential flow @xmath61 as a function of the particles rapidity , @xmath62 , normalized to the projectile one @xmath63 .",
    "the rapidity values are evaluated in the c.m . reference frame . from the figure",
    "we can see that , on average , the neutron - proton transversal velocity has a negative value .",
    "this reflects the `` bending '' of the relative motion between the c.m . of the emitted neutrons and protons , through the half - plane",
    "opposite to the impact parameter direction .",
    "these results can be compared with the calculations displayed in fig.3(e ) obtained by subtracting , event by event , the c.m .",
    "relative neutron - proton motion related to the `` gas '' phase .",
    "as can be seen , similarly to the case of identical nuclei , this correction restores ( within the errors associated to the statistics of simulations ) the almost specular of the @xmath61 behavior with respect the rapidity axes .",
    "the correction acts also along the beam direction .",
    "the final results also show an enhanced sensitivity to the options related to the isospin potential .",
    "distribution of the reaction products obtained at 650 fm/@xmath54 for the stiff2 option and @xmath53=3 fm . in panels ( b ) and ( c ) , the @xmath56 ratio ( see the text ) is plotted as a function of the reduced impact parameter .",
    "panel ( d ) displays neutron - proton differential flow @xmath61 as a function of the c.m .",
    "different symbols refers to different options describing the iso - vectorial interaction .",
    "( e ) the same quantities reported in the panel ( d ) are plotted after the correction for the relative velocity associated to the c.m . of the neutron an protons `` gases''.,width=264 ]    in the following",
    "we want to discuss in some detail the sensitivity of the dipolar signal to different options concerning the iso - vectorial interaction and different approximation scheme . in fig.4(a ) we show as a function of the reduced impact parameter @xmath58 ( @xmath59fm ) the asymptotic values of @xmath52 and @xmath50 .",
    "the arrow indicates the direction of increasing impact parameters corresponding to the marked points .",
    "different symbols represent different options . in the region of the bending of the lines , around @xmath60 fm ,",
    "we observe the greater sensitivity to the different options .",
    "this result is particularly evident by studying the ratios @xmath64 .",
    "is plotted as a function of the corresponding @xmath50 value for different @xmath55 values and different options ( different symbols ) .",
    "the arrow indicates the direction of increasing impact parameters .",
    "-(b ) relative changes @xmath65 for the ratio @xmath66 ( see the text ) evaluated for different couples of options as a function of the @xmath55 reduced impact parameter .",
    "-(c ) values of @xmath65 evaluated for the stiff1-stiff2 options as a function of @xmath55 are plotted in the case of full comd - ii calculations and in the case of the i.m.f.a .",
    "approximation ( see the text ) .",
    "the lines which join the points are meant only to guide the eye through the shown trend.,width=226 ]    in fig .",
    "4(b ) we in fact show the relative change @xmath67 between couples of different options .",
    "we can see that for @xmath55 less than about 0.6 large changes are predicted according to the different form factor shapes .",
    "this impact parameter region is clearly dominated by large overlap between projectile and target nuclei which gives rise to processes changing from incomplete fusion reactions to imf production .",
    "the region of intermediate impact parameters show the higher sensitivity when the mechanism evolves with respect to the essentially binary processes which take place at the higher impact parameters . for @xmath55 greater than 0.6 ,",
    "in fact , the sensitivity is strongly reduced .    in particular , according to what previously observed ( see for example point ( ii ) ) , we have evaluated the partial contributions @xmath68 and @xmath69 related to the two main fragments . as an example , for @xmath60 fm and for the stiff2 option , the `` liquid '' asymptotic values are @xmath70 and @xmath71 while the total contributions are @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",
    "it results therefore that the contributions carried by the two main fragments only partially contribute to the isospin equilibration process .",
    "the remanent part ( `` gas '' ) , which in this case we have associated to particles and to the imf , generates a term with opposite sign and similar strength for both directions .",
    "it contributes in a decisive way to the global equilibration process . in particular , as an example , for @xmath60 fm , in fig 4(b ) we show with the star symbol , the sensitivity parameter @xmath65 evaluated by changing the option from stiff1 to stiff2 and by only taking into account the two main fragments contributions . as we can see",
    ", the partial contribution shows a rather reduced sensitivity to the different options as compared to the case obtained by using the complete information of the system .    finally ,",
    "in the following , we show the role of the correlation coefficient @xmath39 , introduced in sec.ii , into determine the sensitivity of the investigated observable to the density dependence of the iso - vectorial interaction .",
    "for this aim , in fig.4(c ) , we compare , for different impact parameters , the values of @xmath65 obtained for the stiff2-stiff1 options with the ones obtained in the i.m.f.a .",
    "4(c ) clearly shows that in the i.m.f.a .",
    "case , at the investigated energies , the sensitivity of our investigated phenomenon to the behavior of the symmetry interaction is rather reduced .",
    "the i.m.f.a . also strongly affects the values of @xmath12 .",
    "in particular , independently from the used options , it produces for @xmath55=0.4 , values of @xmath74 about four times larger than the ones obtained with full comd - ii calculations indicating a reduced capacity to obtain the isospin equilibration along the @xmath49 direction .",
    "in summary , in this work the isospin equilibration process for the asymmetric charge / mass system @xmath0 at 40 mev / nucleon has been investigated by studying the ensemble average of the time derivative of the total dipole @xmath12 evaluated through comd - ii calculations . some general properties of this quantity have been discussed . in particular , it allows to generalize the definition of isospin equilibration also in complex reactions evolving through multi - fragmentation processes .",
    "comd - ii calculations show that the asymptotic values of @xmath12 for these processes are quite sensitive to different symmetry potential options ; moreover , in central and mid - peripheral , the dipolar contribution associated to the pre - equilibrium emission of charged particles is relevant to determine the value of @xmath12 and the related sensitivity to different density dependent form factors .",
    "comd - ii calculations performed in the so called i.m.f.a .",
    "scheme also highlights the fundamental role played by the many - body correlations in the study of the isospin equilibration processes .",
