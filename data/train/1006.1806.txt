    "analytic regularization of quantum field - theory  @xcite ,  @xcite is not new , but the operator regularization approach  @xcite ,  @xcite has not in general been used in conjunction with feynman diagrams , although such use has been implied  @xcite ,  @xcite .",
    "operator regularization has the distinct advantage that it can be used with formally non - renormalizable theories  @xcite ,  @xcite since the divergences are not reabsorbed , but each is removed and replaced by an arbitrary factor ; so it might seem well worth the effort of having it work with feynman diagrams , as it has so far been limited to the more complicated schwinger approach .",
    "while operator regularization does not cure the non - predictability problem of non - renormalizability , it has the advantage that the initial lagrangian need not be extended , as would be the case for regularization approaches that do not remove the divergences and so would need the addition of extra terms in the original lagrangian to accommodate them .    for use with feynman diagrams ,",
    "operator regularization in renormalizable theories needs to give results equivalent to other methods of regularization ; the results will not be identical however , since operator regularization , unlike say dimensional regularization , removes divergences .",
    "the use of operator regularization with feynman diagrams to one - loop was tackled previously  @xcite .",
    "we begin with a description of operator regularization , how it works , and why it should give equivalent results to dimensional regularization .",
    "this is followed by one and two - loop examples to show how operator regularization in practice is no harder then dimensional regularization .",
    "the use of analytic continuation to deal with the divergences of quantum field theory has been criticized  @xcite , but even the formulae use in dimensional regularization to deal with all but the logarithmic divergence involve analytic continuation .",
    "the operator regularization scheme is governed by the identity :    @xmath1    where the @xmath2s are arbitrary , and it is enough that the degree of regularization ( @xmath3 ) is the loop order .",
    "there are two separate aspects to this procedure , first the regularization and then the continuation , where the divergences are replaced by arbitrary factors ; these aspects could be separated if so desired .",
    "look at operator regularization for a divergent @xmath4    @xmath5 where the @xmath2s are arbitrary .    noting that @xmath6 has the laurent expansion    @xmath7 one can now see that the effect of operator regularization is to replace the divergent poles by arbitrary constants    @xmath8 to yield the finite interpretation    @xmath9      operator regularization may be generalized to multiple operators , as appear in multi - loop cases .",
    "@xmath10    where the @xmath2s are arbitrary , and it is sufficient that @xmath3 is the loop order ; this may be more compactly written as    @xmath11      the operator regularization method was first introduced in the context of the schwinger approach , which while know to be equivalent to the feynman approach , might still leave one asking if operator regularization has the same effect in both .",
    "so one is lead to asking if operator regularization of the logarithm as used in the schwinger approach    @xmath12    is equivalent to operator regularization as used in the feynman diagram context , namely :    @xmath13    the schwinger form can be transformed into the feynman form using    @xmath14 to yield    @xmath15 which simplifies to    @xmath16 and can be seen to differ from the feynman form ( equation  [ eqn : feynman ] ) , so one might initially perceive a difference between the results of operator regularization in the schwinger approach from that in the feynman approach .",
    "however , so long as one includes all the arbitrary factors in operator regularization    @xmath17    they then yield equivalent results .",
    "it is one thing that operator regularization should yield the same results for the schwinger and feynman approaches , but another that operator regularization yield equivalent results as other more well known regularization procedures such as dimensional regularization .",
    "this has been covered previously in the schwinger approach  @xcite but the main purpose here is to use operator regularization with feynman diagrams .",
    "starting from the basic integral that carries the divergences in one - loop feynman diagrams    @xmath18 the other versions follow by differentiating with respect to @xmath19 , so one can concentrate on this one alone .",
    "one needs to show that operator regularization and dimensional regularization treat the result    @xmath20    in equivalent ways when divergent , namely in the limit @xmath21 .    in operator regularization",
    "this is    @xmath22    while for dimensional regularization it is    @xmath23    where @xmath24 and having put @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the number of space - time dimensions .",
    "we are interested in comparing these when the original expression is divergent , namely when @xmath27 etc .",
    "the operator regularized expression evaluates in this case to ( using the help of mathematica  @xcite )    @xmath28    while the dimensionally regularized expression has the laurent expansion    @xmath29    where @xmath30 is the polygamma function .",
    "these agree in form , and so all one - loop results should be equivalent when using operator regularization or dimensional regularization .",
    "this investigation began with the suggestion to look at the simpler divergent integral associated with scalar particles at one - loop in 6 dimensions , and continued with probing questions at the two - loop level .",
    "looking at this integral ( rotated to euclidean space )    @xmath32    this integral can be prepared by using the feynman parameter ` trick '    @xmath33^{a_1 + a_2}}\\ ] ] to yield    @xmath34 ^ 2 } \\label{eqn : starting}\\ ] ]    one can now proceed by comparing the use of operator regularization for this divergent integral to that of dimensional regularization .      using the generalized operator regularization scheme ,",
