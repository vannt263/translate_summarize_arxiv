    "surface air shower arrays and air - fluorescence detectors have observed cosmic - ray showers with energies up to @xmath0 ev . however , despite decades of effort ( the first @xmath6 ev showers were seen in the 1960 s @xcite ) , we still know very little about these particles .    at energies below @xmath7 ev , direct measurements by balloon and satellite detectors have shown that cosmic rays include nuclei , from hydrogen to iron with a sprinkling of heavier elements .",
    "this is consistent with the composition that is expected from supernovae @xcite , a likely source for lower energy cosmic rays .",
    "however , at higher energies the composition is poorly known .",
    "higher energy fluxes are too low for direct measurements so we must use indirect approaches , with much larger terrestrial detectors that observe the shower particles created when the cosmic - ray interacts in the atmosphere .",
    "the atmosphere is 28 radiation lengths ( 11 hadronic interaction lengths ) thick , so measuring the cosmic - ray composition is akin to doing particle identification from the back of a calorimeter .",
    "detectors measure the total energy , not the energy per particle .",
    "the challenge is to distinguish a @xmath8 ev proton ( for example ) from a @xmath8 ev ( total ) iron nucleus , with @xmath9 .",
    "as @xmath10 rises , the initial energy is spread among more particles and the shower develops faster , reaching its maximum particle count higher in the atmosphere .",
    "shower development has been studied by air fluorescence detectors , which observe nitrogen fluorescence induced by charged particles moving through the atmosphere .",
    "these measurements are calorimetric , so they provide a fairly direct measure of the total shower energy of the shower .",
    "one can also observe the shower development as it progresses through the atmosphere , and thereby probe the composition .",
    "shower particles that reach the surface are studied with air shower arrays , grids of scintillator or water / ice cherenkov sampling detectors which sample the electrons and photons which reach the ground .",
    "these arrays can cover up to 3000 km@xmath5 .",
    "they measure the shower arrival direction ( using timing ) , energy ( via particle density measurements ) , and lateral spread , with the lateral spread being somewhat sensitive to composition .",
    "co - located muon detectors measure muons from pion and kaon decay .",
    "most of these muons have energies of a few gev .",
    "the ratio of muons to electromagnetic energy is also composition sensitive , with heavier nuclei producing more muons .",
    "unfortunately , the inferred energy and composition are dependent on the hadronic interaction model used to simulate the showers .",
    "the lep experiments have used magnetic spectrometers to study cosmic - ray muons with energies up 3 tev / c @xcite .",
    "tev muons can also be studied by putting a detector underneath a kilometer or more of rock or ice .",
    "these muons are produced early in the shower , and so are somewhat more directly sensitive to the initial ion composition .",
    "however , a very large detector , ( @xmath11 to @xmath12 m@xmath5 ) is needed to get good statistics .",
    "for example , the 72 m by 12 m macro experiment in the gran sasso laboratory lay below 1500 meters of water equivalent ( mwe ) of rock shielding @xcite .",
    "these experiments have measured the muon energy spectra and multiplicities , and also the lateral separation ( decoherence ) .",
    "these distributions are compared with models with varying cosmic - ray compositions .",
    "unfortunately , the choice of hadronic interaction model can have a significant affect on the inferred composition .",
    "macro also took data in coincidence with the eastop air shower array .",
    "more recently , the spase air shower array at the south pole and amanda in - ice detector took data in coincidence .",
    "these combined datasets have reduced , but still significant sensitivity to the choice of hadronic model . because these muons are predominantly produced from low @xmath4 pions and kaons , these models are necessarily quite phenomenological @xcite .    figure [ fig : amanda ] shows the spase / amanda composition measurement @xcite .",
    "the x axis shows the surface energy measured by spase , while the the y axis shows the aggregate muon energy in amanda .",
    "the blue shading shows the expectation for all - proton and all - iron simulations .",
    "the data ( points ) are in - between , indicating an intermediate composition .",
    "high @xmath4 muons will allow perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) to be used to interpret the data and infer composition .",
    "since tev muons are created high in the atmosphere , the high @xmath4 muons are isolated from the bundle of predominantly lower @xmath4 muons .",
    "the lateral separation @xmath13 from the shower core at the earths surface is @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the interaction height and @xmath16 is the muon energy . for a typical interaction height of 25 km , a 500 gev muon with @xmath17",
    "gev / c will be 200 m from the shower core .",
    "the macro collaboration has measured muon pair decoherence ( separations ) out to 50 meters , as in fig .",
    "[ fig : amanda ] ( right ) , and compared them to different models .",
    "they also used detailed simulations , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : icecubeevent ] ( left ) to relate separation to mean @xmath4 . in macro",
    ", 50 m corresponds to a mean @xmath4 of 1.2 gev , not fully in the pqcd regime .    with a 1 km@xmath5 surface area , the icecube detector and icetop surface array will be able to measure muons out to much larger separation distances , where pqcd holds robustly .",
    "rate estimates for charmed quarks and for pions and kaons in jets depend on the minimum accessible @xmath16 and @xmath13 , but the complete icetop / icecube should observe hundreds of high @xmath4 muons each year .",
    "most of these muons are from charmed particle decays , with a smaller number from pions and kaons in jets .",
    "the composition has a large effect on the muon @xmath4 spectra , especially near the kinematic limits .",
    "there are many more @xmath18 ev partons in a @xmath8 ev proton than in a @xmath8 ev iron nucleus , at any @xmath19 .",
    "figure [ fig : icecubeevent ] ( right ) shows one event found by icecube , showing an isolated muon about 400 m from the shower core .",
    "the collaboration has also observed near - horizontal muon pairs .",
    "these muons have a initial energies of at least several tev @xcite .",
    "the proposed km3net detector could make similar studies .",
    "the measured muon decoherence spectrum can be compared with predictions based on pqcd and different composition models . in the longer run",
    ", one can also use this data to probe shadowing at low bjorken@xmath20 .",
    "because of the fixed - target geometry , the observed muons are produced in the far - forward region , and come from the collision of a high@xmath20 parton in the incident particle with a low-@xmath3 parton in the @xmath21 or @xmath22 target .",
    "the data will therefore be sensitive to shadowing in nitrogen or oxygen .",
    "the accessible kinematic range will depend on the minimum observable muon - core distance , but it may reach below @xmath23 @xcite .     and separation determined by macro @xcite .",
    "( right ) an interesting event observed by icecube .",
    "an air shower hits the 11 stations in the icetop surface array , and light is seen in 96 buried optical modules .",
    "84 of the modules are on 4 strings near the extrapolated air shower core .",
    "the remaining 12 modules are on another string about 400 meters from the projection @xcite .",
