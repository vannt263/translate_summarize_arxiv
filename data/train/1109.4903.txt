    "our contribution to the _ viii mexican workshop on gravitation and mathematical - physics 2010 _ focused on explaining the implementation of the deformation quantization formalism to a gravitational field coupled to matter .",
    "also it was considered its application to diverse cosmological models and the baby universe system .",
    "the analysis included a minisuperspace approach of the de sitter model , the kantowski - sachs universe ( for the commutative and non - commutative cases ) and finally we discussed the case of string cosmology with a dilaton exponential potential .",
    "the detailed construction is presented in @xcite ( and references therein ) and will not be repeated here .",
    "instead we will apply the formalism to another case using the minisuperspace approach of string cosmological models involving axion and dilaton fields in a curved space .",
    "the issues we will discuss in section two involve mainly a brief review of the weyl - wigner - groenewold - moyal ( wwgm ) formalism of deformation quantization @xcite in the context of quantum cosmological models .",
    "this is an integral functional formalism and it is well defined in the case of the whole wheeler s superspace of 3-metrics in the adm s description of gravity and matter .",
    "the four dimensional low energy effective field theory action of string theory contains at least three massless fields : the graviton , the axion and the dilaton @xcite .",
    "indirect evidences of low energy string theory can appear in the physical consequences of the axion in a curved spacetime @xcite .",
    "in string theory the dilaton is quite relevant since it defines the string coupling constant .",
    "one of the most important models of string cosmology is the pre - big - bang scenario @xcite .",
    "it incorporates the target space string duality through the _ scale factor duality_. this predicts a decreasing curvature for negative values of the time coordinate .",
    "this curvature is the specular image of the so - called _ post - big - bang _ cosmology .",
    "the pre - big - bang cosmology scenario is important as it is a modification produced by string theory which is ( at least perturbatively ) a consistent theory of quantum gravity .",
    "thus it is expected to describe the correct modification to standard general relativity at very early times .",
    "the prediction is that there is not a standard big - bang singularity since it is smoothed by the scale factor duality coming from target space duality . in the present paper",
    "we study precisely the quantum cosmological model regarding the pre - big - bang scenario in the context of the quantization of the phase space of the minisuperspace of these models .",
    "in particular we discuss the cosmological model of a string theory in four dimensions with axion and dilaton fields in a curved space @xcite .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section three , we apply the deformation quantization formalism to string cosmology with axion and dilation in a curved minisuperspace approach and we find the exact wigner functional which is equivalent to the quantum states of the universe . in the last section ,",
    "we give our final remarks .",
    "we start by giving a brief overview of the hamiltonian formalism for the gravitational field .",
    "in particular we consider the adm decomposition of general relativity coupled to matter ( see for instance @xcite ) .",
    "we take a globally hyperbolic spacetime modeled with a pseudo riemannian manifold @xmath0 where @xmath1 and @xmath2 with signature @xmath3 . here",

    "we will deal with fields at the moment @xmath17 ( on @xmath5 ) and we put @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "the kind of systems considered here are invariant under diffeomorphisms thus their canonical hamiltonian is pure constraint .",
    "therefore we only should worry to solve the constraints of the theory .",
    "these are the momentum and the hamiltonian constraint .",
    "this latter is written as @xmath20 where @xmath21 , @xmath22 , with @xmath23 stands for the matter lagrangian , @xmath24 is the cosmological constant , @xmath25 is the scalar curvature of @xmath5 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 denotes partial derivative with respect to @xmath28 and @xmath29 is the determinant of @xmath4 .",
