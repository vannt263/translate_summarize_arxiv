    "the typical ohmic contact resistance is @xmath109 as determined by the difference between two and four - terminal resistances ( corrected for known cryostat wiring resistances ) .",
    "therefore the ohmic contacts should not effect thermalization .",
    "a wet etch is used to define the conductive mesa , and au - ge - ni ohmic contacts and ti - au top - gates are then deposited by thermal evaporation .",
    "photolithography is used at each stage to define the layer pattern in photoresist on the substrate .",
    "measurements on the devices were performed in a dilution refrigerator with a base temperature of . a ruthenium oxide thermometer attached to the mixing chamber of the dilution refrigerator",
    "was used to measure @xmath5 .",
    "rojek  _ et al . _ consider a fixed electrical power input into a two - dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) that results in an elevated electron temperature @xmath110 with respect to the lattice temperature @xmath5 . in the steady - state ,",
    "the power input to the 2deg is balanced by the heat loss to the lattice .",
    "then , one can derive from the continuity equation for heat and charge flow a diffusion equation for @xmath111 ,    @xmath112    here @xmath7 is the thermal conductivity of the 2deg , @xmath0 the energy relaxation length , and @xmath113 is the spatial coordinate along which the temperature varies ( for the temperature variation within the bgt , relevant for eq .  4 ,",
    "this is the @xmath113-direction while for the temperature variation within the 2deg strip , relevant for eq .  5 ,",
    "this is the @xmath93-direction , see fig .  1 of the main text ) .",
    "an applied gate voltage changes the electron density @xmath3 which , in turn , modifies the transport properties , in particular the elastic and inelastic scattering times @xmath40 and @xmath50 , the thermal conductivity @xmath7 , and the energy relaxation length @xmath0 .",
    "their @xmath3-dependences are described by power laws with the following exponents :    @xmath114    for each region with constant electron density ( the gated region ii(iii ) and the ungated region i(iv ) of the bgt , relevant for eq .  4 , as well as the 2deg strip , relevant for eq .  5 ) , the general solution of eq .",
    "[ diffusionequation ] is @xmath115 where the coefficients @xmath116 and @xmath117 have to be determined by boundary conditions .      for the bgt , the spatial position @xmath113 is defined relative to the interface between the 2deg strip and the gated region ii .",
    "there are two regions of constant electron density ( the gated and the ungated one , i and ii ) which requires four boundary conditions to fully determine the temperature profile .",
    "one is given by @xmath118 at @xmath119 , the quantity to be measured by the bgt .",
    "furthermore , the ohmic contact at @xmath120 fixes the electron temperature to the lattice temperature , @xmath121 . finally , at @xmath122 ( the interface between the gated ( i ) and the ungated ( ii ) region ) , both the temperature @xmath70 and the heat current @xmath123 have to be continuous .",
    "it is , then , a matter of solving a set of four linear equations to express the coefficients of eq .  [ tprofile ] in terms of @xmath118 .",
    "however , the only relevant feature of the full temperature profile that enters the thermovoltage is the temperature at the interface between region i and ii , @xmath60 . plugging @xmath124 into the full solution immediately leads to the compact formula eq .  4 , where @xmath125 originates from the boundary condition of the heat current to be continuous .    in the limit of a large gated region , @xmath126 , the coefficient @xmath117 of the exponentially increasing term in eq .  [ tprofile ] vanishes , @xmath60 goes to zero , and the ungated region does not influence the measure thermovoltage . for @xmath127",
    ", however , the ungated region becomes important .",
    "ignoring it leads to an inadequate fit to the data , as shown in fig .  2 of the main text .",
    "the modelling of the temperature profile along the @xmath93-direction in the 2deg strip is analogous to that of the bgt .",
    "since the electron density is constant in the 2deg strip , only two boundary conditions are needed .",
    "they are given by fixing @xmath70 to @xmath128 at @xmath129 and to @xmath55 at the ohmic contact @xmath130 .",
    "formally , determining the temperature profile along in the 2deg strip is just a special case of the calculation for the bgt .",
    "therefore eq .",
    "5 follows from eq .  4 by performing the replacements @xmath131 , @xmath132 , @xmath133 , @xmath134 , and @xmath135 .",
    "figure s 1 shows the sensitivity of a model fit to the fitting parameters . the particular data used to demonstrate this corresponds to @xmath136 at @xmath106 , although similar results are obtained for all other values of @xmath25 and @xmath26 used in this experiment .",
    "the optimum fit is contrasted to the resulting fit when a specific fitting parameter is changed by a given percentage . in panel",
    "( a ) @xmath70 was varied by 10% in each direction , in panel ( b ) and ( c ) , @xmath2 and @xmath0 were varied by 20% in each direction respectively .",
    "the result is a clearly deviated and inadequate fit in each case .",
    "however these percentage changes are chosen such that the quality of the fit visibly deteriorates .",
    "in fact the residual of the fit is more sensitive to changes in a single fitting parameter , for example , doubling for a 5% change in @xmath70 .",
    "this highlights the technique s usefulness as an electron thermometer ."

    "<S> however , probing heat transport mechanisms in these systems has proven more challenging , primarily due to the lack of convenient low-@xmath4 thermometers that couple directly to the electron gas . conventional low-@xmath4 thermometers such as germanium or ruthenium - oxide films are sensitive only to the lattice temperature @xmath5 , the temperature of the crystal that hosts the 2deg . </S>",
    "<S> at @xmath6 the coupling between electrons and phonons becomes relatively weak , and therefore @xmath1 can differ significantly from @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> the electrical resistance of the 2deg itself becomes insensitive to @xmath1 at these temperatures , since the majority of scattering events are from static impurities . </S>",
    "<S> these both therefore become ineffective at measuring @xmath1 in this regime . </S>",

    "<S> the weak localization characteristics of 2degs  @xcite can also be useful as they depend sensitively on the phase - coherence length which is @xmath1-dependent . </S>",

    "<S> this method was recently employed to measure @xmath8 in mesoscopic 2degs  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> usefully , the relatively large size of the bar - gates eliminates the need for electron beam lithography which simplifies the fabrication process . </S>",
    "<S> however , it was noted in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite that the data systematically deviated from the mott prediction . </S>",
    "<S> rojek  _ et al . _  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite attributed these deviations to the spatial extent of the bar - gate thermometers ( bgts ) being comparable to the energy relaxation length @xmath0 in the 2deg and developed a model to account for this . in this work </S>",
    "<S> we adapt the model developed by rojek and knig to refine the analysis of the signal produced by a bgt , and to make an accurate measurement of @xmath0 .    figure  [ fig1]a shows a false - colour sem image of a typical device . </S>",
    "<S> please see the supplementary material  @xcite for wafer and fabrication details . </S>",
    "<S> the device consists of a heating element and a longitudinal strip of 2deg ( of width and length @xmath21  =  ) which together form a ` t ' shape , with three bgts along the strip . </S>",
    "<S> the first bgt is at a distance @xmath22 from the heating element . </S>",
    "<S> a top - gate sits over the heating element and the strip and is used to tune the electron density @xmath3 in these regions . </S>",
    "<S> this design minimizes any power reflection at the interface between the heating element and the strip . the strip is terminated by a large ohmic contact .    throughout the experiment </S>",
    "<S> all ohmic contacts through which no current is passed were assumed to be at @xmath5 , since they are in direct thermal contact to the mixing chamber via the measurement wiring . </S>",
    "<S> figure  [ fig1]b shows a schematic of a single bgt . </S>",
    "<S> it is a symmetric structure consisting of two arms flanking the 2deg strip . </S>",
    "<S> the left ( right ) arm is formed by a gated region labelled ii ( iii ) , followed by an ungated region labelled i ( iv ) , and terminated by an ohmic contact . </S>",
    "<S> the lengths of the gated and ungated regions of the arms are @xmath23 and @xmath24 , respectively .     within the gated region . </S>",
    "<S> this model ignores any effects of the temperature profile along the bgt , and therefore the only fitting parameter is @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> the fit is clearly inadequate with the fit systematically deviating from the experimental data . </S>",
    "<S> this kind of deviation was found to be typical across the parameter space of @xmath25 and @xmath26 explored in this experiment.,width=288 ]    the experiment involves passing a current @xmath25 at frequency @xmath27 through the heating element which joule heats the electron gas with a power of @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the four - terminal electrical resistance of the heating element . </S>",
    "<S> this establishes a temperature gradient along the length of the 2deg strip . </S>",
    "<S> the thermovoltage @xmath10 generated across a thermometer in response to @xmath25 is detected at @xmath30 using a lock - in amplifier . </S>",
    "<S> figure  [ fig2 ] shows @xmath31  ( see fig .  </S>",

    "<S> an almost identical result is obtained when gate iii is swept , except that @xmath10 is opposite in sign . </S>",
    "<S> the thermovoltages developed across the second and third bgts were found to be negligible for even the largest used heating currents . </S>",

[ mottformula ] . here </S>",

    "<S> figure  [ fig2 ] also shows the best fit to the data by assuming that hot electrons relax to @xmath5 within a distance @xmath47 and therefore over the gated region , regardless of the carrier density @xmath48 beneath the gate . in this simple picture </S>",
    "<S> the temperature profile along the bgt arm is not relevant , and the only unknown is @xmath1 between the bgt arms . </S>",
    "<S> however the quality of the fit is clearly inadequate and this is found to be the case across the parameter space of @xmath25 and @xmath26 explored in this experiment .    </S>",
    "<S> we first describe why it is essential to consider the contribution from _ all _ the regions @xmath49  i to iv towards @xmath10 . at low-@xmath4 and especially in high - mobility 2degs , the energy relaxation length @xmath0 over which hot electrons relax through inelastic processes can greatly exceed the mean - free path of electrons  @xcite . the dependence of @xmath0 on the inelastic scattering time @xmath50 is given by @xmath51 , where @xmath52 is the diffusion constant of the electrons , and @xmath53 is the fermi velocity . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath50 has a power - law dependence on @xmath3 : @xmath54 , where the subscript @xmath55 denotes the values in the ungated 2deg . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the distance over which electrons lose their excess energy in the bgt arm is crucially dependent on @xmath56 . </S>",
    "<S> the ohmic contact enforces @xmath57 at the 2deg to ohmic contact interface , and this needs to be taken into consideration if @xmath0 is comparable to @xmath58 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore in all the above situations , both the gated and ungated regions contribute to @xmath10 in a manner dependent on @xmath1 at the centre of the bgt , @xmath1 at the interface of the gated and ungated regions , @xmath0 , and @xmath2 , all of which need to be estimated self - consistently . to do this we adapt the model used in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ( described in the supplementary material  @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting expression for @xmath59 at the junction of the gated and ungated regions @xmath60 , reads :    @xmath61    here @xmath62 is the energy relaxation length at @xmath63 , and @xmath64 . within the framework of rojek  _ et al . _  </S>",
    "<S> s linearized model  @xcite , @xmath65 . </S>",
    "<S> equation  [ model ] provides an expression for @xmath35 , which when substituted together with eq .  </S>",
    "<S> [ drudemottformula ] in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> [ thermovoltage ] , results in an expression for @xmath10 as a function of @xmath66 , @xmath3 in each gated region , @xmath62 , @xmath67 , @xmath2 and @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> we measure @xmath66 and @xmath68 in the device by observing @xmath32-dependent edge - state reflections in the quantum hall regime  @xcite , and @xmath67 is extracted from the dependence of @xmath18 on @xmath3 and turns out to be @xmath69 over the relevant range of @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> this leaves three unknowns , namely @xmath62 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 , which are used as fitting parameters . </S>",
    "<S> importantly though , by fitting to several complementary data sets whilst varying different experimental parameters such as @xmath25 and @xmath26 , we are able to considerably reduce the uncertainty in these three fitting parameters ( see supplementary material  @xcite ) .    figure  [ fig3]a shows @xmath10 against @xmath48 for varying @xmath25 which will produce different @xmath70 . </S>",
    "<S> figure  [ fig3]b shows @xmath10 against @xmath48 but for varying @xmath26 which will vary @xmath0 in the 2deg strip as well as @xmath70 via its effect on @xmath29 . </S>",
    "<S> clearly , the model produces excellent fits to the data with no discernible systematic deviations . </S>",
    "<S> similar data and quality of fit is obtained when the adjacent bgt is swept .    </S>",
    "<S> the results of the fitting are the @xmath70 for each @xmath25 and @xmath26 in the two data sets . </S>",
    "<S> figure  [ fig4]a shows @xmath70 as a function of @xmath25 on a log - log scale , and we find that @xmath71 . </S>",
    "<S> this sub - squared dependence is presumably due to a fraction of the power being lost to the lattice and to the ohmic contacts . </S>",
    "<S> the values of @xmath2 and @xmath62 are found to be @xmath72 and @xmath73 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> figure  [ fig4]b shows @xmath70 as a function of @xmath26 after @xmath70 has been scaled for the changing value of @xmath29 . </S>",
    "<S> this has been done by applying a corrective factor of @xmath74 so that any change in @xmath70 is now due solely to a change in @xmath0 . here </S>",
    "<S> @xmath75 is the electrical resistance of the heating element as a function of @xmath26 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore the graph suggests that for @xmath76 , the hot electrons completely relax within a distance @xmath77 . </S>",
    "<S> the data therefore suggests that hot electrons thermalize over macroscopic length scales ( @xmath78 ) in the ungated 2deg , but that this length scale rapidly decreases with @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> this strongly justifies the need to account for the ungated 2deg arms when using bgts at high @xmath79 . </S>",
    "<S> this is also consistent with the negligible thermovoltage detected across the second and third bgts which are at distances of @xmath80 and @xmath81 from the heating element , respectively . while @xmath79 can certainly be lowered untill @xmath82 such that @xmath83 , care must be taken to ensure that eq .  </S>",
    "<S> [ drudemottformula ] remains valid . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , we have observed that when the 2deg approaches the localized regime ( when @xmath18 becomes @xmath84 ) the model is unable to fit the data satisfactorily . in this experiment @xmath3 </S>",
    "<S> was conservatively limited to @xmath85 corresponding to @xmath86 and @xmath87 , where @xmath88 is the fermi wave vector , @xmath89 is the elastic mean free path , and @xmath90 is the interaction parameter defined as the ratio of the coulomb energy and kinetic energy of the 2deg .     as a function of carrier density @xmath3 . the data in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig4]b produces an independent measure of @xmath91 which we find to be in excellent agreement with the model exponents.,width=288 ]    importantly , the model _ only _ provides the value of @xmath62 and @xmath2 from which @xmath91 can be reconstructed . </S>",
    "<S> however , as argued in the previous paragraphs , this information is independently contained in fig .  [ fig4]b . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath1-profile in the 2deg strip is given by ( see supplementary material  @xcite ) :    @xmath92}}{\\sinh{({l_{\\textup{strip}}}/\\ell)}}\\ ] ]    here @xmath93 is the spatial coordinate along the 2deg strip ( see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1]b ) and @xmath94 , the temperature elevation in the heating channel . </S>",
    "<S> since the heating channel is effectively at a constant temperature between pairs of points in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig4]b , the ratio @xmath95 taken at @xmath96 provides an implicit relation between @xmath97 and @xmath98 , where @xmath99 and @xmath100 are the respective carrier densities . </S>",
    "<S> therefore this allows the inference of @xmath0 from @xmath1 , and reconstruction of @xmath0 as a function of @xmath3 as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig5 ] . </S>",
    "<S> this is the main result of this study showing the dependence of the energy relaxation length scale on the carrier density . </S>",
    "<S> we stress that this is a _ </S>",
    "<S> direct _ measurement of @xmath91 using the pre - calibrated bgt , which we find to be in striking agreement with indirectly obtained dependence @xmath101 , using the values of @xmath62 and @xmath2 derived from the model and the fitting .    to summarize </S>",
    "<S> , we have demonstrated that bgts are a versatile tool with which to detect elevated electron temperatures . </S>",
    "<S> as remarked earlier , bgts are an attractive alternative to qpcs . </S>",
    "<S> qpc fabrication requires electron beam lithography and they come with the associated difficulties of sub - micrometre devices such as sensitivity to electrical shock and vulnerability to disorder . in contrast , bgts can be macroscopic and therefore free from the above mentioned difficulties .    while our manuscript seems to suggest that the trade - off between qpcs and bgts is that detailed modelling is required to extract @xmath1 , it is important to note that modifying the device design such that @xmath102 significantly reduces the complexity of the analysis . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> the advantages of the employed device design are that it allows for the determination of @xmath91 using a single bgt . </S>",
    "<S> we note that using a second bgt further displaced along the length of the 2deg strip should also allow for such a measurement , so long as @xmath103 .    </S>",
