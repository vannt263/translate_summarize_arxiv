    "in 1985 , @xmath1 , a fascinating molecule formed as a truncated icosahedron with 20 hexagonal and 12 pentagonal faces , and 60 vertices , was discovered by kroto _",
    "et al._@xcite . since then , a third form of pure carbon , called _",
    "fullerenes_@xcite , has been extensively studied .",
    "this kind of molecule can crystallize in a variety of three - dimensional structures@xcite , with an even number of three - coordinated @xmath2 carbon atoms that arrange themselves into 12 pentagonal faces and any number ( @xmath3 ) of hexagonal faces@xcite .",
    "the macroscopic synthesis of soot@xcite , which contains @xmath1 and other fullerenes in large compounds , plus the straightforward purification techniques , which make pure fullerene materials available , opened new research opportunities in science , engineering and technology@xcite . in the meantime ,",
    "doped fullerenes have also attracted a great deal of researchers interest due to their remarkable structural , electronic , optical and magnetic properties@xcite .",
    "for example , the doped tubular fullerenes can exhibit large third - order optical nonlinearities@xcite and be ideal candidates as photonic devices@xcite for all - optical switching , data processing , eye and sensor protection ( optical limiter ) .",
    "another example is alkali metal - doped @xmath4 crystals , which can be superconducting @xcite . because of their unique structure and electronic properties@xcite",
    ", fullerenes can be doped in several different ways including endohedral doping@xcite , substitutional doping @xcite , and exohedral doping @xcite .",
    "since the average carbon - carbon bond length in @xmath1 is slightly larger than that in graphite , which can only be doped by boron , and the force constants @xcite are somewhat weakened by the curvature of the @xmath1 surface , both boron and nitrogen can substitute for one or more carbon atoms in @xmath1@xcite . in 1991 ,",
    "smalley and coworkers@xcite successfully synthesized boron - substituted fullerenes @xmath5 with @xmath6 between 1 and at least 6 . in 1995 , hummelen _ et al._@xcite reported a very efficient method of synthesizing @xmath7 , which has led to a number of detailed studies of the physical and chemical properties of @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "recently , hultman _",
    "et al._@xcite have synthesized nitrogen - substituted derivatives of @xmath1 with more than one nitrogen atom and reported the existence of a novel @xmath0 aza - fullerene @xcite .",
    "very recently , we have studied the bonding , electronic structure , mulliken charge , infrared ( ir ) spectrum , and nmr of @xmath0 by using density functional theory ( dft ) and the 6 - 31 g basis set@xcite .",
    "we characterized 58 ir spectral lines , eight @xmath8 and two @xmath9 nmr spectral signals of @xmath0 , and demonstrated that this aza - fullerene has potential applications as semiconductor components for nanometer electronics because of its small energy gap , as a promising electron donor for molecular electronics , and as a good diamagnetic material because of the enhancement of diamagnetic factors in the carbon atoms@xcite .",
    "the characterization of @xmath0 is a timely problem both from the viewpoint of its practical applications and to understand doping in @xmath1 derivatives . in the present paper",
    ", we characterize the raman spectrum of @xmath0 .    as a material",
    "is doped with foreign atoms , its mechanical , electronic , magnetic and optical properties change @xcite .",
    "the ability to control such induced changes is vital to progress in material science .",
    "raman and ir spectroscopic techniques@xcite are basic , useful experimental tools to investigate how doping modifies the structural and dynamical properties of the pristine material and to understand the physical origin of such induced changes . over the past 10 years",
    ", both techniques have been widely used to study the vibrational properties of @xmath1 @xcite , its derivative compounds @xcite , and ( doped ) carbon nanotubes@xcite .",
    "it has been shown that @xmath1 has in total 46 vibrational modes including 4 ir - active @xcite and 10 raman - active @xcite vibrational modes .",
    "well - resolved raman spectra@xcite are also available for @xmath1 and a number of its derivative compounds .    in this paper",
    ", we perform first - principles calculations of raman scattering activities ( rsas ) and raman - active frequencies ( rafs ) in both @xmath0 and @xmath1 using density functional theory ( dft ) and the restricted hartree - fock ( rhf ) method . very recently , choi _",
    "et al._@xcite have theoretically assigned all 46 vibrational modes of @xmath1 , including a scaling of the force field by using pulay s method . in this paper , however , we carry out _ ab initio _ a series of calculations for @xmath1 .",
    "we want to test the efficiency and accuracy of such first - principles calculations and study , in detail , basis set effects on rsas and rafs by comparing our theoretical results with available experiments@xcite . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "such basis set effects on the rsas and rafs of @xmath1 have not been considered before .",
    "these calculations for @xmath1 give us a benchmark for assigning the raman - active vibrational modes of @xmath0 and provide us with constructive insight into the microscopic mechanisms responsible for the difference between @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "we find that the 10 rafs for @xmath1 , obtained by using a hybrid dft method and large basis sets , are in excellent agreement with raman experiments .",
    "we predict that @xmath0 aza - fullerene has 58 rafs including 29 non - degenerate polarized modes and 29 doubly - degenerate unpolarized modes .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section ii briefly reviews the _ ab initio _ methods , basis sets and the theory of calculating raman scattering activities .",
    "section iii presents our raman results for both @xmath1 and @xmath0 obtained by using rhf and dft methods , and the results are compared to results obtained by other theoretical methods .",
    "our conclusions are given in section iv .",
    "_ ab initio _ methods obtain information by solving variationally the schrdinger equation without fitting parameters to experimental data .",
    "instead , experimental data guides the selection of the _ ab initio _ methods rather than directly entering the computational procedures .",
    "fullerenes have been challenging molecules for _ ab initio _ calculations because of their size@xcite .",
    "recent advances in _ ab initio _ electronic structure methods and parallel computing have brought a substantial improvement in the capabilities to predict and study the properties of large molecules .",
    "the coupled cluster method@xcite has been used to predict phenomena in @xmath10@xcite . other _",
    "ab initio _ methods , which are less demanding in terms of computation cost than the coupled cluster method , have been used for much larger fullerenes and carbon nanotubes , for example , @xmath1 @xcite with self - consistent field and moller - plesset second - order ( mp2 ) theory , @xmath11 @xcite and carbon nanotubes@xcite with density functional theory ( dft ) , and @xmath12 @xcite with the hartree - fock ( hf ) method .",
    "the major expense in hf and dft calculations arises from solving the electronic quantum coulomb problem .",
    "the effective hamiltonian diagonalization ( a procedure that scales as @xmath13 , @xmath14 being the number of basis functions ) represents only a minor portion of the computational time in calculations of molecular clusters containing up to several hundred atoms @xcite .",
    "in addition , dft @xcite requires an additional three - dimensional numerical quadrature to obtain the exchange and correlation energies@xcite .",
    "both hf and dft methods have been implemented into the gaussian 98 program@xcite . in this paper , all calculations are performed by using the gaussian 98 program@xcite",
    ".    one of the approaches inherent in all _ ab initio _ methods is the introduction of a basis set@xcite .",
    "if the basis set is complete , exact expansions of the molecular orbitals can be obtained .",
    "however , a complete basis set requires an infinite number of functions , which is impossible in actual calculations .",
    "generally , a smaller basis set provides a poorer representation .",
    "moreover , only the parts of the molecular orbital which correspond to the selected basis can be represented . since the computational effort of _ ab initio _",
    "methods scales formally as @xmath15@xcite , it is important to make the basis set as small as possible without compromising the accuracy or missing part of the state space which should be represented .",
    "hence , one purpose of this paper is to determine the effects of basis sets@xcite for the calculations of raman spectra by consdering the slater - type basis set sto-3 g and split valence basis sets 3 - 21 g , 6 - 31 g and 6 - 31g(d ) ( i.e. , 6 - 31 g * ) .      the vibrational analysis of polyatoms described by wilson _",
    "et al._@xcite has been implemented in the gaussian 98 program .",
    "this analysis is valid only when the first derivatives of the energy with respect to the displacement of the atoms are zero ( in other words , the geometry used for vibrational analysis must be optimized at the same level of theory and with the same basis set that the second derivatives are generated with ) .",
    "the force constant matrix @xmath16 is defined as the second partial derivatives of the potential @xmath17 with respect to the displacement of the atoms in cartesian coordinates ( for example , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 of the @xmath21th atom ) , i.e. , a @xmath22 matrix ( n is the number of atoms ) whose elements are given by @xmath23 where @xmath24 .",
    "@xmath25 means that the second partial derivatives are taken at the equilibrium positions of the atoms . usually , the matrix @xmath16 in cartesian coordinates is converted to a new matrix @xmath26 in mass - weighted cartesian coordinates @xmath27 , i.e. , @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the mass of the atom .",
    "then , the eigenvalues @xmath30 of @xmath26 give the fundamental frequencies @xmath31 ( in the unit of @xmath32 ) , i.e. , @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the velocity of light in vacuum .",
    "the eigenvectors give the normal modes .",
    "to lowest order , raman intensities are proportional to the derivatives of the dipole polarizability with respect to the vibrational normal modes of the material , evaluated at the equilibrium geometry . for example",
    ", most raman scattering experiments use a plane - polarized incident laser beam .",

    "@xmath39 is the frequency of the scattered radiation , @xmath40 is the frequency of the @xmath35th vibrational mode , @xmath41 is boltzmann s constant , and @xmath42 is temperature .",

    ", one must compute the derivatives of the polarizability with respect to the normal mode coordinates @xmath45 .",
    "these can be viewed as directional derivatives in the space of 3n nuclear coordinates and are expressed in terms of derivatives with respect to atomic coordinates , @xmath47 . for the polarizability component @xmath48 ( i , j = x , y , z )",

    "the effects of basis set and electron correlations on rsas of @xmath0 are similar to those obtained for @xmath1 . detailed analysis of raman - active vibrational modes of @xmath0 shows that ( i ) the raman spectra in the high - frequency region ( @xmath78 ) comes mainly from carbon - carbon vibrations ; ( ii ) the strong nitrogen - carbon vibrations occur only in the low - frequency region ; ( iii ) the strongest and weakest raman signals come from the contributions of carbon - carbon vibrations .",
    "in summary , we have performed large scale _ ab initio _ calculations of rsas and rafs in @xmath0 as well as @xmath1 using b3lyp hybrid dft and rhf methods .",
    "we predict that @xmath0 has 29 non - degenerate polarized and 29 doubly - degenerate unpolarized rafs , and the raf of the strongest spectral lines in the low- and high- frequency regions and the lowest and highest rafs are almost the same as those of @xmath1 .",
    "the 10 rafs of @xmath1 calculated with the b3lyp hybrid dft method and large basis set are in excellent agreement with experiment .",
    "our study of @xmath1 reveals the importance of electron correlations and basis sets in the _ ab initio _ calculations , and our calculated raman results of @xmath1 demonstrate the desirable efficiency and accuracy of the b3lyp hybrid dft method for obtaining important quantitative information on the vibrational properties of these fullerenes .",
    "finally , we hope that these calculations will provide an incentive for raman measurements on @xmath0 .",
