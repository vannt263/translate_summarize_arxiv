    "for a long time tunneling a particle through an one - dimensional time - independent potential barrier was considered in quantum mechanics as a representative of well - understood phenomena .",
    "however , now it has been realized that this is not the case .",
    "the inherent to quantum theory standard wave - packet analysis ( swpa ) @xcite ( see also @xcite ) , in which the study of the temporal aspects of tunneling is reduced to following the centers of `` mass '' ( cms ) of wave packets , does not provide a clear prescription both how to interpret properly the scattering of finite in @xmath0 space wave packets and how to introduce characteristic times for a _ tunneling _ particle .",
    "all these questions constitute the main content of the so - called tunneling time problem ( ttp ) which have been of great interest for the last decades .",
    "as is known , the main peculiarity of the tunneling of finite wave packets is that the average particle s kinetic energy for the transmitted , reflected and incident wave packets is different .",
    "for example , in the case of tunneling through an opaque rectangular barrier , the average velocity of the transmitted particle is larger than that of the incident particle .",
    "it is evident that this fact needs a proper explanation . as was pointed out in @xcite",
    ", it would be strange to interpret the above property of wave packets as the evidence of accelerating a particle ( in the asymptotic regions ) by the static potential barrier . besides , in this case there is no causal link between the transmitted and incident wave packets ( see @xcite ) .",
    "as regards wide ( strictly speaking , infinite ) in @xmath0 space wave packets , the average kinetic energy of particles , before and after the interaction , is the same .",
    "but now the uncertainty in defining the cm s position and , consequently , corresponding asymptotic times is very large . as a result ,",
    "the most of physicists considers the characteristic times introduced in the swpa as quantities having no physical sense .",
    "the review @xcite devoted to the ttp seems to be the last one in which the swpa is considered in a positive context .",
    "apart from the swpa , in the same or different setting the tunneling problem , a variety of alternative approaches ( see reviews @xcite and references therein ) to advance different characteristic times for a tunneling particle have also been developed . among the alternative conceptions , of interest",
    "are that of the dwell time @xcite , that of the larmor time @xcite to give the way of measuring the dwell time , and the conception of the time of arrival which is based on introducing either a suitable time operator ( see , for example , @xcite ) or the positive operator valued measure @xcite . besides , of interest are attempts to study the temporal aspects of tunneling in the frame of the feynman , bohmian and wigner approaches to deal with the random trajectories of particles ( see , for example , @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "one should also mention the papers @xcite where the ttp is studied in the framework of a nonstandard setting the scattering problem . but",
    "again , for a particle whose initial state is described by a gaussian - like wave packet , none of the alternative approaches have not yet led to commonly accepted characteristic times ( see the reviews @xcite ) .",
    "note , unlike the swpa , in all these approaches theoretical efforts have been aimed at elaborating some rule of timing the motion of a quantum particle . as was said in @xcite , `` ... up to now the interest of theoreticians [ to the ttp ] has been motivated ... by a fundamental lacuna of quantum theory , namely the absence of a clear prescription to incorporate time observables into its formalism '' . however ,",
    "in our opinion , there is no necessity in such a prescription : time in quantum mechanics has the status of a parameter , and , hence , there is no room here for time observables ( or , time operators ) . and , what is more important , the rule of timing the particle s motion have already been available in quantum theory , and this rule is dictated by the correspondence principle .    by the analogue with classical mechanics where timing the particle s motion",
    "is reduced to the analysis of the function @xmath1 ( @xmath0 is the particle s position , @xmath2 is time ) , in quantum mechanics characteristic times for a particle should be derived from studying the temporal dependence of the expectation ( average ) value of the position operator for a particle in a given state ( or , what is equivalent , from studying the temporal behavior of the cm of the corresponding wave packet ) . besides , from the analysis of the temporal dependence of the mean - square deviation for this operator ( or , from the analysis of the temporal behavior of the corresponding leading and trailing edges of the wave packet ) one can take into account uncertainty in the particle s position , and thereby evaluate the error of the above timing .    however , one has to bear in mind the following .",
    "the above timing procedure suggests that the average value of the position operator has its primary physical sense , as the most probable position of a particle , at all stages of its motion . for a free particle",
    "whose state is described by a gaussian - like wave packet , this requirement is fulfilled and , thus , no problem arises in timing its motion .",
    "an essentially different situation takes place in the case of a _ tunneling _ particle .",
    "now , following the cm of the wave packet to describe the state of the whole ensemble of particles becomes meaningless at some stages of scattering .",
    "in particular , after the scattering event , when we deal , in fact , with two scattered ( transmitted and reflected ) wave packets , the averaging over the whole ensemble of particles has no physical sense .",
    "of course , in this case there is a possibility to define the individual average positions of transmitted and reflected particles .",
    "however , in timing , such averaging suggests the separate description of both the subensembles at early times , what is widely accepted to be impossible in quantum mechanics . as was pointed out in @xcite , `` ... transmission and reflection are inextricably intertwined '' .",
    "so , quantum theory provides the needed rule of timing the motion of a particle , but it conflicts with the existing viewpoint that transmission and reflection are allegedly inseparable ( namely this obstacle have remained to overcome in the swpa ) .",
    "however , in our opinion , there is no basis for such a viewpoint . for none of the principles of quantum mechanics",
    "forbids such a separation . in reality",
    ", the main problem is that quantum theory , as it stands , does not provide the way of separating transmission and reflection . in our opinion , just the absence of the corresponding mathematical formalism is a fundamental lacuna in quantum theory .    in this paper , in the framework of the conventional quantum mechanics , we show that , at least in one dimension , transmission and reflection can be described separately .",
    "it is surprising that such a description needs no innovation .",
    "as it has turned out , the separation of transmission and reflection is provided by the intrinsic property of the schrdinger equation , which have been overlooked before .",
    "namely , we show that in the standard setting the one - dimensional scattering problem for a given potential the schrdinger equation possesses , in addition to the solution to describe the state of the whole ensemble of particle , an unique pair of other solutions which , as we postulate , describe separately transmission and reflection .",
    "the basis for such a postulate is that , for any instant of time , the subensemble s nonstationary - state wave functions are mutually orthogonal and their sum describes the state of the whole ensemble of particles ; one of them causally evolves into the transmitted wave packet , and another approaches at late times the reflected one .",
    "the main peculiarity of stationary - state wave functions for transmission and reflection is that , for a given energy of particle , there is a point in the barrier region where these everywhere continuous functions have discontinuous first spatial derivatives . nevertheless , this point is not a sink or source of particles for each subensemble .",
    "so that the norms of the corresponding wave packets are constant in time .    note , at present there is a paradoxical situation .",
    "although the tunneling phenomenon have been known for a long time , the properties of tunneling proper have remained , in fact , unstudied .",
    "the point is that the `` full '' wave function to describe the state of a particle in the one - dimensional scattering problem relates to all particles of the quantum ensemble , rather than to transmitted particles only . in this connection",
    ", we hope that the formalism presented here will be useful for a deeper understanding of the tunneling process and , in particular , hartman effect @xcite widely discussed in the literature ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ a1",
    "] we pose a complete one - dimensional scattering problem for a particle , and display explicitly shortcomings to arise in the swpa in solving the ttp . in section [ a2 ]",
    "we present a renewed wave - packet analysis in which transmission and reflection are treated separately . in section [ a3 ]",
    "we define the average ( exact and asymptotic ) transmission and reflection times and consider , in details , the cases of rectangular barriers and @xmath3-potentials .",
    "let us consider a particle tunneling through the time - independent potential barrier @xmath4 confined to the finite spatial interval @xmath5 $ ] @xmath6 ; @xmath7 is the barrier width .",
    "let its in state , @xmath8 at @xmath9 be the normalized function @xmath10 .",
    "the function is proposed to belong to the set @xmath11 consisting from infinitely differentiable functions vanishing exponentially in the limit @xmath12 .",
    "the fourier - transform of such functions are known to belong to the set @xmath11 as well . in this case",
    "the position and momentum operators both are well - defined . without loss of generality",
    "we will suppose that    @xmath13 here @xmath14 is the wave - packet s half - width at @xmath9 ( @xmath15 ) ; @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the operators of the particle s position and momentum , respectively .    an important restriction should be imposed also on the rate of spreading the incident wave packet .",
    "namely , we will suppose that the average velocity @xmath18 is large enough , so that in the incident wave packet its parts lying behind the cm within the wave - packet s half - width move toward the barrier .",
    "as is known , the formal solution to the temporal one - dimensional schrdinger equation ( ose ) of the problem can be written as @xmath19 to solve explicitly this equation , we will use here the variant ( see @xcite ) of the well - known transfer matrix method @xcite that allows one to calculate the tunneling parameters , as well as to connect the amplitudes of the outgoing and corresponding incoming waves , for any system of potential barriers .",
    "the state of a particle with the wave - number @xmath20 can be written in the form    @xmath21    for @xmath22 , and    @xmath23    for @xmath24 , where @xmath25 should be found from the initial condition ; @xmath26 the coefficients entering this solution are connected by the transfer matrix @xmath27 :    @xmath28    which can be expressed in terms of the real tunneling parameters @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 ,    @xmath32;{\\mbox{\\hspace{5mm}}}p=\\sqrt{\\frac{r(k)}{t(k)}}\\exp\\left[i\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2}+ f(k)-ks\\right)\\right];\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    @xmath33 ( the real transmission coefficient ) and @xmath34 ( phase ) are even and odd functions of @xmath20 , respectively ; @xmath35 ; @xmath36 ; @xmath37 .",
    "note that the functions @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath38 contain all needed information about the influence of the potential barrier on a particle .",
    "we will suppose that the tunneling parameters have already been known explicitly . to find them",
    ", one can use the recurrence relations obtained in @xcite just for these real parameters .    as is known , solving the ttp is reduced in the swpa to timing a particle beyond the scattering region where the exact solution of the ose approaches the corresponding in or out asymptote @xcite .",
    "thus , definitions of characteristic times in this approach can be done in terms of the in and out asymptotes of the tunneling problem .",
    "note that in asymptote in the one - dimensional scattering problem represents an one - packet object to converge , well before the scattering event , with the incident wave packet , while out asymptote represents the superposition of two non - overlapped wave packets to converge , at @xmath39 with the transmitted and reflected ones .",
    "it is easy to show that in the problem at hand in asymptote , @xmath40 , and out asymptote , @xmath41 , can be written as follows    @xmath42;\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    @xmath43 e^{ikx}dk,{\\mbox{\\hspace{3mm}}}f_{out}(k , t)= f_{out}^{tr}(k , t)+f_{out}^{ref}(k , t);\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    @xmath44;\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    @xmath45\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath46    for a completed scattering we have @xmath47 @xmath48 it is obvious that the larger is the distance @xmath49 , the more correct is the approximation for @xmath50 at @xmath9 .    for particles starting ( on the average ) from the origin ,",
    "we have @xmath51 ( hereinafter , for any hermitian operator @xmath52 @xmath53 similar notations are used below for the transmitted and reflected wave packets ) . the averaging separately over the transmitted and reflected wave packets yields    @xmath54    @xmath55    ( hereinafter the prime denotes the derivative with respect to @xmath20 ) . exps .",
    "( [ 63 ] )  ( [ 65 ] ) yield the basis for defining the asymptotic tunneling times in the swpa .      to display explicitly some shortcomings of the swpa ,",
    "let us derive again the swpa s tunneling times .",
    "let @xmath56 be a point to lie at some distance @xmath57 ( @xmath58 and @xmath59 ) from the left boundary of the barrier , and @xmath60 be a point to lie at some distance @xmath61 ( @xmath62 ) from its right boundary .",
    "following @xcite , let us define the difference between the times of arrival of the cms of the incident and transmitted packets at the points @xmath56 and @xmath60 , respectively ( this time will be called below as the `` transmission time '' ) .",
    "analogously , let the `` reflection time '' be the difference between the times of arrival of the cms of the incident and reflected packets at the same point @xmath56 .",
    "thus , let @xmath63 and @xmath64 be such instants of time that    @xmath65    then , considering ( [ 63 ] ) and ( [ 64 ] ) , one can write the `` transmission time '' @xmath66 ( @xmath67 ) for the given interval in the form    @xmath68.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    similarly , for the reflected packet , let @xmath69 and @xmath70 be such instants of time that    @xmath71    from equations ( [ 63 ] ) , ( [ 65 ] ) and ( [ 10 ] ) it follows that the `` reflection time '' @xmath72 ( @xmath73 ) can be written as    @xmath74.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    note that the expectation values of @xmath20 for all three wave packets coincide only in the limit @xmath75 ( i.e. , for particles with a well - defined momentum ) .",
    "in the general case these quantities are distinguished .",
    "for example , for a particle whose initial state is described by the gaussian wave packet , we have    @xmath76    on can show that in this case @xmath77",
    "@xmath78    let @xmath79    then relations ( [ 100 ] ) and ( [ 101 ] ) can be written in the form    @xmath80    note that @xmath81 .",
    "as is seen , quantities ( [ 9 ] ) and ( [ 11 ] ) can not serve as characteristic times for a particle . due to the last terms in these expressions the above times depend essentially on the initial distance between the wave packet and barrier , with @xmath57 being fixed .",
    "these terms are dominant for the sufficiently large distance @xmath49 .",
    "moreover , one of them must be negative .",
    "for example , for the transmitted wave packet it takes place in the case of the under - barrier tunneling through an opaque rectangular barrier .",
    "the numerical modelling of tunneling @xcite shows in this case a premature appearance of the cm of the transmitted packet behind the barrier , what points to the lack of a causal link between the transmitted and incident wave packets ( see @xcite ) .",
    "as was shown in @xcite , this effect disappears in the limiting case @xmath75 .",
    "for example , in the case of gaussian wave packets the fact that the last terms in ( [ 9 ] ) and ( [ 11 ] ) tend to zero when @xmath82 , with the ratio @xmath83 being fixed , can be proved with help of exps .",
    "( [ 100 ] ) and ( [ 101 ] ) ( note that the limit @xmath82 with a fixed value of @xmath49 is unacceptable in this analysis , because it contradicts the initial condition @xmath84 for a completed scattering ) .",
    "thus , at first glance , in the limit @xmath75 the swpa seems to provide correct characteristic times for a particle .",
    "however , as will be seen from our formalism , even in this case , the above times are poorly defined .",
    "the point is that the above definitions of tunneling times for transmission and reflection are based on the implicit assumption that particles of both the subensembles start , on the average , from the origin as those of a whole quantum ensemble .",
    "as will be seen from the following , this is not the case .",
    "note , the fact that exps .",
    "( [ 9 ] ) and ( [ 11 ] ) can not be applied to particles does not at all mean that they are erroneous .",
    "these expressions correctly describe the relative motion of the transmitted ( or reflected ) and incident wave packets .",
    "the principal shortcoming of the above approach is that it is meaningless to compare the motion of the transmitted ( or reflected ) wave packet with that of the incident one since they are related to different ensembles of particles and , as a consequence , there is no causal relationship between them .",
    "the right procedure of a separate timing of transmitted particles suggests the availability of such initial wave packet to evolve causally into the transmitted one .",
    "for a long time the processes of transmission and reflection in a quantum scattering have been accepted to be inseparable , in principle . however , in this paper we show that , at least in the one - dimensional case , there are sound reasons to consider these processes separately .      according to quantum scattering theory , in one dimension , stationary - state wave functions for a particle impinging the barrier from the left ( or from the right ) possess one incoming and two outgoing waves .",
    "that is , in this case we deal , in fact , with one - source two - sinks scattering problems .",
    "let for the problem at hand the amplitude of incoming wave , @xmath85 , be equal to unit , then the amplitudes of all four waves read as    @xmath86    ( note , @xmath87 , @xmath88 , @xmath89 ) .",
    "let us also consider two auxiliary ( two - sources one - sink ) scattering tasks in which the amplitudes of incoming and outgoing waves are    @xmath90    and    @xmath91    ( the transfer matrix ( [ 50 ] ) is common for all three tasks ) .",
    "note that in the first auxiliary task the only outgoing wave coincides with the reflected wave arising in the problem at hand ( see ( [ 700 ] ) ) . and , in the second task",
    ", the only outgoing wave coincides with the transmitted wave in ( [ 700 ] ) .",
    "it is evident that the sum of these two functions results just in that to describe the state of a particle in the initial tunneling problem .",
    "as is seen , the main peculiarity of the superposition of these two states is that due to interference the incoming waves , in the region @xmath24 , disappear entirely ( note that in the corresponding reverse motion they are outgoing waves ) . figuratively speaking",
    ", interference reorients these waves into the region @xmath92 .",
    "that is , in this superposition the probability fields of both sinks are radically reconstructed due to interference .",
    "namely , they transform into fields with one outgoing and one incoming waves .",
    "hereinafter , the wave function in which an incoming wave is associated with the reflected wave of solution ( [ 700 ] ) will be refereed to as the reflection wave function ( rwf ) .",
    "similarly , the wave function in which an incoming wave is related to the transmitted wave of ( [ 700 ] ) will be refereed to as the transmission wave function ( twf ) .",
    "we postulate that , in the considered scattering problem , namely the nonstationary - state twf and rwf describe , respectively , the transmission and reflection processes .",
    "as will be shown below , both the functions evolve in time with constant norms ; at late times the twf ( rwf ) coincides with the transmitted ( reflected ) wave packet .",
    "thus , we see that the sum of wave functions ( [ 701 ] ) and ( [ 702 ] ) can be presented as that of the stationary - state rwf and twf . under the reconstruction of the probability fields , the squared amplitude of the incoming wave ( in the region @xmath92 ) associated with reflection increases due to interference from the initial value @xmath93 ( @xmath94 ) ( see ( [ 701 ] ) ) to @xmath95 ( @xmath96 ( in the rwf ) . in the case of transmission the corresponding quantity increases from the initial value @xmath97 ( @xmath98 ) ( see ( [ 702 ] ) ) to @xmath99 ( @xmath100 ( in the twf ) .",
    "of course , the above postulate suggests the availability of a proper pair of solutions to the schrdinger equation .",
    "the main thing which should be taken into account in finding these solutions is that the rwf describes the states of reflected particles only , and the twf relates only to transmitted particles . as was said above , in both the cases",
    ", stationary solutions should contain one incoming and one outgoing wave . in this paper",
    "we show that such solutions do exist .",
    "so , let @xmath101 and @xmath102 be the searched - for twf and rwf , respectively . in line with subsection [ a21 ] , their sum represents the wave function to describe , in the problem at hand , the sate of the whole ensemble of particles .",
    "hence , from the mathematical point of view our task now is to find such solutions @xmath101 and @xmath102 to the schrdinger equation that for any @xmath2 ,    @xmath103    where @xmath50 is the full wave function to describe all particles ( see section [ a1 ] ) . in the limit @xmath104 @xmath105 where @xmath106 and @xmath107 are the transmitted and reflected wave packets whose fourier - transforms presented in ( [ 61 ] ) and ( [ 62 ] ) .    as is known , searching for the wave functions in the case of the time - independent potential @xmath4 is reduced to the solution of the corresponding stationary schrdinger equation . for a given @xmath20 ,",
    "let us find firstly the functions @xmath108 and @xmath109 for the spatial region @xmath22 . in this region",
    "let    @xmath110    @xmath111    where @xmath112 , @xmath113 .",
    "since the rwf describes the state of reflected particles only , the probability flux for @xmath108 should be equal to zero , i.e. ,    latexmath:[\\ ] ] @xmath227 if @xmath228 ; otherwise @xmath229 here the function @xmath230 coincides , for a given @xmath20 , with one of the functions , @xmath231 or @xmath232 , for which @xmath108 is an odd function ( see above ) .",
    "one can easily show that for both the roots @xmath233    a simple analysis in the @xmath20-representation shows that well before the scattering event the average kinetic energy of particles in both subensembles ( with the average wave numbers @xmath234 and @xmath235 ) is equal to that for large times : @xmath236 besides , at early times    @xmath237    @xmath238    as it follows from exps .",
    "( [ 73 ] ) and ( [ 74 ] ) , the average starting points @xmath239 and @xmath240 , for the subensembles of transmitted and reflected particles , respectively , differ from that for all particles : @xmath241 the implicit assumption made in the swpa that incident , as well as transmitted and reflected particles start , on the average , from the same point does not agree with this result . by our approach , this is the main reason why the asymptotic transmission and reflection times obtained in the swpa should be considered as ill - defined quantities , for any wave packets .",
    "let us take into account exps .",
    "( [ 73 ] ) , ( [ 74 ] ) and again analyze the motion of a particle in the above spatial interval covering the barrier region .",
    "in particular , let us calculate the transmission time , @xmath242 , spent ( on the average ) by a particle in the interval @xmath243 $ ] .",

    "may be negative by value .",
    "the corresponding lengths @xmath255 and @xmath256    @xmath257    can be treated as the effective widths of the barrier for transmission and reflection , respectively .",

    "besides , we will obtain the corresponding expressions for the coordinate , @xmath262 , of the average staring point for this particle : @xmath263 .",

    "this property guarantees that for infinitely narrow in @xmath0-space wave packets the average starting points for both subensembles will coincide with that for all particles .",
    "it is important also that for wells the values of @xmath264 and , as a consequence , the corresponding tunneling times are negative , in the limit @xmath282 , when @xmath283 .",
    "note that for sufficiently narrow barriers and wells , namely when @xmath284 , we have @xmath285 .",
    "that is , particles tunnel , on the average , classically through such barriers . for the starting point",
    "we have @xmath286 for @xmath267 and @xmath287 , respectively .    for wide barriers and wells , when @xmath288 , we have @xmath289 and @xmath290 , for @xmath291 ; and @xmath292 for @xmath287 .",
    "it is interesting to note that for the @xmath3-potential @xmath293 @xmath294 .",
    "this means that , contrary to the phase tunneling time , the tunneling times defined here equal to zero for this potential .",
    "as regards the starting point @xmath262 in the case of the @xmath3-potential , we have @xmath295 thus , we see that , for example , in the case of @xmath3-wells ( @xmath296 ) particles in each subensemble start , on the average , with an advance in comparison with those of the whole quantum ensemble .",
    "a separate description of transmission and reflection is commonly accepted to contradict the principles of quantum mechanics . however , in this paper we argue that this is not the case , at least in the one - dimensional one - particle scattering problem .",
    "we show that the wave function to describe , in this problem , the state of the whole ensemble of identically prepared particles can be uniquely presented as the sum of two functions ( named here as the twf and rwf ) to obey the schrdinger equation . in the case of nonstationary case , these functions are mutually orthogonal . at late times",
    "the twf coincides with the transmitted wave packet , and the rwf approaches the reflected one .",
    "we postulate that namely the twf and rwf are the wave functions to describe , respectively , transmission and reflection in the considered scattering process .",
    "there is also a widely accepted viewpoint ( see , for example , page 106 in @xcite and page 17 in @xcite ) that all solutions to the stationary one - dimensional schrdinger equation , for a finite potential , must be everywhere continuous together with their spatial derivatives ; otherwise , the points where this requirement is violated contain allegedly sinks or sources of particles .",
    "however , in this paper we show that the above requirement for `` physical '' solutions to the schrdinger equation is , in reality , excessive .",
    "the main peculiarity of the presented stationary - state wave functions for transmission and reflection is that there is a point in the barrier region where these everywhere continuous functions have discontinuous first spatial derivatives ( in the case of symmetric potential barriers this takes place at the midpoint of the barriers ) .",
    "nevertheless , for each subensemble , this point contains neither sink nor source of particles : both for transmission and reflection , the probability current density for each stationary - state wave function is constant on the spatial axis , and the norm of wave packets formed from these functions is constant in time .",
    "we show that , in the case of a symmetric potential barrier , reflected particles impinging the barrier from the left do not penetrate into the spatial domain lying to the right of the midpoint of the barrier region .",
    "this means , in particular , that the switching on an infinitesimal magnetic field in this domain must not influence the spin of these particles .",
    "besides , for the given potential we formulate two scattering problem in which the rwf and twf arise separately and , as a consequence , there is another possibility to check experimentally our approach . in both the scattering problems the amplitudes of incoming waves form the eigenvectors of the scattering matrix for the given potential .",
    "on the basis of the above formalism we define average ( exact and asymptotic ) transmission and reflection times .",
    "the exact tunneling times are always non - negative . in the case of rectangular barriers and @xmath3-potentials , for both the subensembles",
    ", we derive explicit expressions for the asymptotic tunneling times and for the average starting points .",
    "these times differ essentially from those arising in the swpa .",
