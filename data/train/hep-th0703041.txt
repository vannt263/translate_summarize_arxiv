    "the faddeev - volkov solution @xcite of the yang - baxter equation @xcite possesses many remarkable properties . from algebraic point of view",
    "it is distinguished by its _ modular duality_. the solution",
    "is related with non - compact representations of the modular double @xcite of the quantum group @xmath1 , where @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "it was studied in connection with the lattice liouville and sinh - gorgon models @xcite .",
    "note , that the parameter @xmath4 above is related to the liouville central charge @xmath5 .",
    "it is well known that every solution of the yang - baxter equation defines an integrable model of statistical mechanics on a two - dimensional lattice .",
    "the faddeev - volkov model , defined by their solution , has strictly positive boltzmann weights .",
    "it is an ising - type model with continuous spin variables @xmath6 , taking arbitrary real values .",
    "its partition function is given by the integral @xmath7}\\ \\prod_i d \\sigma_i , \\label{zfv}\\ ] ] where the energy @xmath8 $ ] is a convex and bounded from below function of the spin variables @xmath9 .",
    "in this paper we study this model and reveal its remarkable connections to discrete geometry , namely , to _ circle patterns _ and _ discrete conformal transformations _ ( for an introduction see a popular review @xcite and a monograph @xcite ) .",
    "recently these topics attracted much attention due to thurston s circle packing approach to the discrete riemann mapping theorem @xcite and the discrete uniformization theorem @xcite .    in this approach _ circle packings _ and , more generally , _ circle patterns _ ( see sect .  5 below ) serve as discrete analogues of conformal transformations , where the circle radii can be thought as the local dilatation factors .",
    "they satisfy certain integrable non - linear difference equations which play the role of discrete cauchy - riemann conditions .",
    "these equations are called the _ cross - ratio equations _ @xcite . in the simplest case",
    "they reduce to the hirota form of the discrete sine - gordon equation @xcite .",
    "( curiously enough , the continuous riemann mapping problem for domains with a piece - wise smooth boundary is also connected to the hirota equations @xcite , but of the different type @xcite . )",
    "an appropriate variational approach for the circle patterns was developed by bobenko and springborn @xcite .",
    "their action @xmath10 $ ] is a positive definite function of the logarithmic radii of the circles @xmath11 ,  @xmath12 .",
    "we show that the leading quasi - classical asymptotics of the energy functional in @xmath13 \\simeq { \\frac{1}{2\\pi b^2}\\ , { \\mathscr a}[2\\pi b \\sigma ] } , \\qquad b\\to0,\\qquad c_l\\to+\\infty,\\ ] ] precisely coincide with this action , provided logarithmic radii of the circles are identified with the ( rescaled ) spin variables in , namely @xmath14 .",
    "thus , at @xmath15 , stationary points of the integral correspond to circle patterns . at finite values of @xmath16",
    "the model describes quantum fluctuations of these patterns and the associated discrete conformal transformation .",
    "given that the circle radii define local dilatation factors , the faddeev - volkov model describes a _ quantum discrete dilaton_.    the continuous quantum field theory with the conformal symmetry @xcite has remarkable applications in physics and mathematics @xcite .",
    "it would be interesting to understand which aspects of the continuous conformal field theory can be transferred to the discrete case .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows . in sect .  2 we present definitions and discuss properties of the faddeev - volkov model .",
    "in sect .",
    "3 we consider @xmath17-invariant lattices and rhombic tilings which are closely related to the combinatorics of the circle patterns .",
    "the quasi - classical limit is considered in sect .",
    "4 . an introduction to circle patterns is given in sect .",
    "we review the derivation of the cross - ratio equations and show that they are exactly coincide with the quasi - classical equation of motion in the faddeev - volkov model .",
    "some open problem are discussed in the conclusion . in appendix",
    "a we discuss some implications of the star - triangle equation and @xmath17-invariance to the circle patterns and volumes of polyhedra in the lobachevskii 3-space . the appendix  b contains useful information on the special functions used in this paper .",

    "the faddeev - volkov model on a z - invariant lattice has a remarkable connection with the circle patterns related to the discrete riemann mapping theorem @xcite .",
    "the classical riemann mapping theorem states that for any simply connected open domain in the complex plane ( which is not the whole plane ) there exists a biholomorphic mapping from that domain to the open unit disk .",
    "the fact that the mapping is biholomorphic implies that it is a conformal transformation .",
    "likewise , the discrete riemann mapping theorem involves discrete analogs of conformal transformations .",
    "below we give a short introduction into this subject .    in the continuous case the conformal transformations possess two key properties : ( i )",
    "they preserve the angles and ( ii ) uniformly rescale all infinitesimal lengths in a vicinity of every point , where the scale depends on the point .",
    "now one needs to reformulate these properties for a discrete case , when the continuous plane is replaced , for example , by a polygonal lattice . for the first property one could , naively , suggest that the angles between the edges meeting at the same site remain unchanged . we will call this the rule ( i ) .",
    "the second property is more complicated , since there is no a lattice analog of the infinitesimal length . nevertheless , as a first attempt it is reasonable to try the simplest possibility and suggest that the lengths of the edges attached to the same site are scaled equally ( though the scale can vary from site to site ) .",
    "we will call this the rule ( ii ) .",
    "now consider transformations of the ordinary square lattice , implementing both rules at every site .",
    "the rule ( i ) requires that the @xmath180 angles between the four edges at any site remain unchanged . the rule ( ii )",
    "requires that these edges also remain equal in length for every site ( though , in principle , the lengths could change from site to site ) .",
    "a very little inspection shows these requirements only allow a uniform dilatation of the whole lattice ( of course , the same would be true for any polygonal lattice , not just the square one ) .",
    "obviously , the rules are too restrictive and do not allow any interesting transformations of the lattice ; they need to be relaxed .",
    "a fruitful idea is to work with a bipartite lattice and apply only one rule on each sublattice .",
    "consider , for instance , the square lattice shown in fig .",
    "[ square - lattice ] .",
    "its sites are divided into two sublattices shown with `` white '' and `` black '' dots .",

    "[ square - circle ] .",
    "as seen from the picture , the circle centered at white sites still pass through all neighboring black sites ( rule ( ii ) ) , they still intersect at the @xmath180 angles ( rule ( i ) ) , but the radii of these circles have changed ! it is important to keep in mind that , by construction , this transformation preserves the combinatorics of the original lattice . in particular , there is a one - to - one correspondence between the circles on the two pictures , which preserves their adjacency and intersection angles .    before formulating equations determining the radii of the circles let us make a few remarks .",

    "two circles connected by an edge @xmath192 intersect at the angle @xmath91 assigned to this edge ( fig .  [ twocircle ] ) .",

    "using these data we constructed a rhombic `` tiling '' of the dual graph @xmath117 ( fig .",

    "can immediately construct an isoradial circle pattern by drawing circles of the same radius centered at the white and passing though the neighboring black sites ( fig .  [ pattern1 ] ) .",
    "conversely , any isoradial circle pattern defines a certain rhombic tiling from which one can easily reconstruct @xcite the corresponding rapidity graph together with all rapidity values ( up to an insignificant overall shift ) .",
