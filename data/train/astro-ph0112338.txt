    "it is well known that elemental abundances measured in the interstellar gas of the solar vicinity are generally depleted with respect to the solar values ( morton 1974 ; jenkins , savage & spitzer 1986 ) .",
    "the commonly accepted interpretation of this depletion effect is that a fraction of these elements is not detected in the gas because it is locked into dust grains .",
    "elemental depletions are estimated by comparing the abundances measured in the gas with the abundances of the medium ( gas plus dust ) .",
    "intrinsic solar abundances are usually adopted in local interstellar studies , even though the interstellar abundance standard is not yet firmly established ( savage & sembach 1996 , hereafter ss96 ; sofia & meyer 2001 ) .",
    "different elements may have very different values of depletion , the so called `` refractory '' elements being almost completely in dust form .",
    "in addition , elemental depletions can vary significantly among different lines of sight . in spite of this complex behavior ,",
    "interstellar regions with similar physical conditions are characterized by similar depletions ( spitzer 1985 ; jenkins et al . 1986 ) . in the galactic disk",
    "the cold gas has higher depletions than the warm gas ; in the halo the warm gas shows even lower depletions ( ss96 ) .",
    "elemental depletions constitute an important piece of information for solving the complex puzzle of the origin and evolution of interstellar dust ( tielens & allamandola 1987 and refs .",
    "therein ) .",
    "studies of depletions in the galaxy and in the magellanic clouds ( mcs ) have received new impulse ( roth & blades 1995 ; welty et al .",
    "1997 , 2001 ) owing to their importance in the interpretation of abundance patterns measured in the qso absorbers of highest column density , namely the damped ly @xmath0 systems ( dlas ) .",
    "these systems originate in intervening galaxies or protogalaxies and their abundances yield unique information on galactic chemical evolution at different redshifts ( lu et al .",

    "1996 ; hou et al .",
    "2001 ; prochaska & wolfe 2002 ) . in order to cope with the problem of depletion in dlas",
    "some authors have concentrated on studies of non - refractory elements ( pettini et al . 1997 ; centurin et al .",
    "2000 ; vladilo et al . 2000 ) and of systems with small dust content ( pettini et al . 2000 , molaro et al . 2000 ) . at the same time",
    ", formalisms have been developed to quantify the effect of dust depletions on dla abundances ( kulkarni et al .",
    "1997 ; vladilo 1998 ; savaglio , panagia & stiavelli 2000 ) .",
    "these formalisms assume that the dust in dlas is similar to galactic interstellar dust .",
    "depletions in dlas have been modeled scaling galactic depletions by allowing variations of the dust - to - metals ratios , but not of the dust chemical composition .",
    "in addition , the fact that the dust composition may be affected by variations of the intrinsic abundances of the intervening galaxies has not been considered .    in this work a scaling law of interstellar depletions",
    "is derived that allows the dust chemical composition to vary according to changes in the dust - to - metals ratio and/or to changes in the overall abundances of the medium ( section 2 ) . rather than assuming _ ad hoc",
    "_ types of dust , a set of parameters is introduced to describe how sensitive the dust composition is to changes in the physical and chemical properties of the medium . in sections 3 and 4",
    "it is shown that such parameters can be estimated from galactic and extragalactic interstellar data .",
    "the conclusions are summarized in section 5 .",
    "the interstellar depletion of an element x is usually defined as @xmath1 where @xmath2 and @xmath3 are the column densities measured in the gas ( spitzer 1978 ) and @xmath4 is the abundance in the medium ( gas plus dust ) . in galactic studies one usually takes @xmath5 ( see , however , sofia & meyer 2001 ) . for galaxies with non - solar composition one should instead use the corresponding abundance pattern .",
    "the depletion @xmath6 does not scale linearly with the quantity of dust or with its chemical composition . in order to derive a scaling law",
    "we define instead the _ fraction in dust _ , @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the column density of atoms x in the dust and @xmath9 the column density in the medium ( gas plus dust ) . ) . an identical treatment could be done using local quantities instead , such as volume densities . ]",
    "the fraction in dust is simply related to the measured depletion : @xmath10 the fraction @xmath11 must scale linearly with the amount of dust and with the abundance of x in dust . to derive this relation we express all abundances by number and relative to the abundance of an arbitrary element y ( e.g. iron ) .",
    "we therefore define the _ abundance of x in the medium _ @xmath12 and the _ abundance of x in the dust _ @xmath13",
    "we also use the element y as a reference for estimating the dust content of the system . for a given chemical composition of the dust ( of the medium ) the total number of atoms of metals in the dust ( in the medium ) will be proportional to @xmath14 ( to @xmath15 ) . therefore we define the _ dust - to - metals ratio _ as @xmath16 this definition is free from any assumption on the extinction properties of the dust . with the above definitions the fraction in dust becomes @xmath17 in previous work @xmath11 was assumed to scale linearly with @xmath18 .",
    "this is correct only if the @xmath19 parameters are constant , i.e. if the dust composition does not vary when @xmath18 varies . here",
    "the more general situation is considered in which the abundances in the dust may depend on @xmath18 and also on @xmath20 , i.e. @xmath21 studies of the galactic ism indicate that the dust - to - metals ratio is linked to the physical state of the medium .",
    "in fact clouds with similar physical properties have similar levels of depletion and depletions appear to be lower when the physical conditions become harsher ( e.g. higher temperature or kinetic energy ) ( ss96 ) .",
    "it is reasonable to expect that once the physical conditions of the medium are specified , also @xmath18 and the dust composition characteristic of those particular physical conditions are determined . if we consider @xmath18 as an indirect indicator of the physical state , then relation ( [ dependence0 ] ) is equivalent to assuming that _ the dust composition is determined by the physical state and by the chemical composition of the medium_. this assumption is much more realistic than assuming that the dust composition is constant .",
    "therefore , we consider @xmath18 and @xmath20 as independent variables of our problem . by logarithmic differentiating eq .",

    "the relation holds always true for infinitesimal changes @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "it can be applied to transformations involving discrete changes @xmath36 and @xmath37 as long as @xmath33 and @xmath34 are constant during the integration of eq .",
    "( [ percentvariation ] ) . thanks to the fact that abundances in the dust @xmath19 do not appear explicitly in the scaling law ,",
    "it is not necessary to make _ ad hoc _ assumptions on the dust chemical composition .",
    "instead , we must determine the parameters @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "in the following sections we discuss the physical meaning of such parameters and show how they can be empirically determined .",
    "the physical meaning of @xmath33 and @xmath34 can be understood by writing the definitions ( [ etax ] ) and ( [ epsilonx ] ) in the following form @xmath38 and @xmath39    both parameters describe how sensitive the dust relative abundances @xmath19 are to changes in the conditions of the medium .",
    "the parameter @xmath33 indicates what percent variation of the relative abundance in the dust occurs in correspondence to a percent variation of the dust - to - metals ratio .",
    "since @xmath18 is related to the physical conditions of the medium , in practice @xmath33 indicates how efficiently the abundance in the dust is affected by changes of the physical conditions . if @xmath40 , the relative abundance in the dust of the element x is not affected by variations of @xmath18 .",
    "the parameter @xmath34 indicates the percent variation of the relative abundance in the dust that occurs in correspondence to a percent variation of the relative abundance in the medium . in practice , the parameters @xmath34 indicate the efficiency of the mechanisms that convert a change in the composition of the medium into a change in the composition of the dust . if @xmath41 , the relative abundance of x in the dust is not affected by changes in the relative abundance in the medium .    the parameters @xmath42 and @xmath43 have special values , or do not need to be determined , for the reference element y. in fact",

    "we assume that galactic interstellar abundances are constant , at least in the solar vicinity .",
    "this implies that @xmath48 and , as a consequence , the scaling law ( [ scalinglawgeneral ] ) becomes @xmath49 given the simplified form of the scaling relation , the galactic ism is the ideal place to determine the parameters @xmath33 and to probe whether they are constant or not in different environments .",
    "the fractions in dust @xmath11 and @xmath50 can be determined from the measured depletions by using eqs.([fraction2 ] ) and ( [ depletion1 ] ) . by comparing the fractions in dust in two different types of clouds @xmath25 and @xmath30 , each type characterized by a specific depletion pattern , it is possible to derive @xmath51 .",
    "if the parameter @xmath33 is constant for any variation of the dust - to - metals ratio , then a single value of @xmath33 should be obtained from any pair ( @xmath52 ) of depletion patterns considered .",
    "here we consider the four types of depletion patterns discussed in ss96 the mg and ni column densities and depletions considered by ss96 have been updated using revised values of the ( welty et al .",
    "1999 and refs . therein ) and ( fedchak & lawler 1999 ; howk , savage & fabian 1999 ) oscillator strengths .",
    "( see fig .",
    "[ galaxy ] ) . in order of decreasing depletion ,",
    "these patterns are representative of ( 1 ) cool clouds in the galactic disk , ( 2 ) warm clouds in the disk , ( 3 ) disk plus halo clouds , and ( 4 ) warm halo clouds .",
    "the lines of sight considered by ss96 also cover a significant range of extinction properties , with strength of the 217.5 nm emission bump as high as e(bump)=0.89 in hd24912 and as low as e(bump)=0.00 and 0.36 in hd 38666 and hd 116852 , respectively ( savage et al .",
    "we compared pairs of the 4 ss96 depletion patterns to estimate @xmath53 .",
    "the results are shown in table 1 , where the quoted errors have been estimated propagating the uncertainties of the fractions in dust .",
    "for some elements the @xmath33 values obtained from different pairs of patterns show a different behavior depending on whether the warm halo is considered or not .",
    "the @xmath33 values obtained from cool disk , warm disk and warm disk - plus - halo patterns are in agreement for all elements considered .",
    "when we compare the warm halo with the cool and warm disk , the derived parameters for ni , cr and mg are still approximately constant in all cases by definition . ] .",
    "however , mn and si show different values , suggesting that for these elements the rate of incorporation into dust , or detachment from dust , is different when we consider the transition to halo gas .",
    "the approximately constant values of the @xmath33 parameters obtained for most elements over a wide range of interstellar conditions encourages us to use relation ( [ scalinglawism ] ) for modeling all the galactic depletion patterns . in fig .",
    "[ galaxy ] we show the results obtained using the warm disk as the @xmath25-th reference pattern .",
    "one can see that all the galactic patterns can be matched using the set of values @xmath54 listed in table 1 . in spite of the lack of constancy of @xmath55 and @xmath56 when the warm halo pattern is considered ,",
    "the model is capable of fitting also the si and mn depletions in the warm halo within the observational errors . therefore , relation ( [ scalinglawism ] ) provides an empirical way to express _ all _ the different types of depletion patterns by varying only one parameter , @xmath57 .",
    "this is a significant improvement with respect to previous work , in which the fractions in dust were assumed to scale linearly with @xmath57 ( i.e. @xmath40 for all elements ) and in which by no means was it possible to model at the same type different depletion patterns .",
    "the fact that all types of galactic depletions can be modeled with a single analytical expression suggests a continuity of the dust properties in different types of interstellar clouds , consistent with results of previous work ( joseph et al .",
    "1986 ; joseph 1988 ; sofia , cardelli & savage 1994 ) .",
    "the existence of specific patterns of depletions probably reflects the existence of well defined phases of the ism , each one with characteristic physical parameters which determine the properties of the dust , as proposed by spitzer ( 1985 ) .",
    "however , in the transition from disk to halo gas important changes in the dust properties must occur to explain the sudden changes of @xmath33 values .",
    "these changes are quite significant for si , suggesting a different behavior of this element as far as its ability to be incorporated in ( or detached from ) dust grains in different types of interstellar environments .",
    "if the chemical composition of the medium is not constant , it is necessary to know the @xmath34 parameters to apply the scaling law ( [ scalinglawgeneral ] ) . among the possible choices of @xmath34 , two values have a special meaning",
    ": @xmath41 implies that the dust composition is insensitive to variations of the overall composition ; @xmath58 implies that dust composition scales in proportion to the composition of the medium , a possibility which seems logical a priori .",
    "in addition , the possibility that @xmath58 is attractive as this would imply that galactic - type depletion patterns can be applied to studies of galaxies with different chemical compositions .",
    "in fact , when @xmath58 , eq .",
    "( [ scalinglawgeneral ] ) becomes equal to eq .",
    "( [ scalinglawism ] ) , i.e. the depletion patterns are of galactic type independent of any change of the chemical composition of the medium . as in this study we are not treating the complex mechanisms of dust formation and destruction , we leave the possibility open that @xmath34 may take different values .",
    "we do not consider , however , values @xmath59 .",
    "in fact , negative values would imply that an increase of the abundance of the element x in the medium would lead to a decrease of its abundance in the dust .    in order to constrain the parameters @xmath34",
    "we must study interstellar depletions in environments with non - solar abundances .",
    "these can be found , for instance , in the ism of external galaxies .",

    "the resulting values of @xmath33 are approximately constant for most elements in a wide range of physical conditions , supporting the validity of the scaling law ( [ scalinglawgeneral ] ) , at least as far as the dependence on @xmath18 is concerned . with the derived set of @xmath33 parameters , the scaling law is able to simultaneously fit all the typical milky way depletion patterns by only varying @xmath18 .    the parameters @xmath34 can be determined empirically by studying interstellar depletions of galaxies with known abundances different from the solar ones .",
    "we have applied this technique to the smc , for which the intrinsic abundances are constrained from stellar studies and depletion data are available for three lines of sight .",
    "the observed smc depletions can be modeled with the scaling law if the smc abundance ratios are slightly non solar .",
    "the required departures from solar ratios are consistent with the results of smc stellar studies and with expectations based on galactic stellar abundances of stars having the same metallicity of the smc .",
    "the agreement between observed and predicted depletions is obtained at values @xmath88 or somewhat below unity . with this choice of parameters",
    "the scaling law is able to simultaneously fit the three available smc depletion patterns , including the anomalous pattern observed toward sk 155 .",
    "values @xmath89 are excluded by the present analysis .",
    "the uncertainty of the smc stellar abundances prevent firmer conclusions or more constrained @xmath34 values .",
    "the capability of the scaling relation presented here to match galactic and smc depletion patterns is rather encouraging . to probe the general validity of the scaling law",
    "it is desirable to measure depletions in a larger number of extragalactic lines of sight .",
    "however , these studies will yield stringent constraints only if the intrinsic abundances of the external galaxies , mostly based on stellar observations , will be determined with accuracy .",
    "a major step in this direction can be made in the next few years by observing a relatively large number of stars of the magellanic clouds at high spectral resolution .",
    "these time - consuming efforts will be rewarded by the possibility of modeling interstellar depletions and deriving dust - corrected abundances in high redshift galaxies observed as qso absorption systems .",
    "an implementation of the scaling relation for deriving dust - corrected abundances in damped ly@xmath0 systems will be presented in a separate paper .",
