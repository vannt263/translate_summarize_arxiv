    "why quantum computation can be more efficient than its classical counterpart is an open problem attracting increasing attention@xcite , @xcite .",
    "the reason is naturally sought in the special features of quantum mechanics exploited in quantum computation , like state superposition , entanglement and quantum interference .",
    "quantum measurement , instead , is generally considered necessary only to `` read '' the computation output . in the justification we shall provide",
    ", measurement does more than `` reading '' an output , it contributes in creating that output in a computationally efficient way .",
    "we will show that the logical constraint that there is a single measurement outcome , acquires a striking function in existing quantum algorithms .",
    "it becomes a set of logical - mathematical constraints representing the problem to be solved , or the hard part thereof , whereas the measurement outcome , by satisfying these constraints , yields the solution .",
    "in all these algorithms , the state before measurement is entangled with respect to a couple of observables .",
    "it is a basic axiom of quantum measurement theory that the time required to measure an observable is independent of this possible entanglement : entanglement is interaction - free .  the computational complexity of satisfying the above logical - mathematical constraints originates from entanglement and is transparent to measurement time .",
    "on the basis of these arguments , we will justify the speed - up in all known quantum algorithms .",
    "for unity of exposition , we shall provide an overview of our justification of the speed - up based on a simplified version of simon s algorithm .",
    "all details are deferred to the subsequent sections .",
    "the problem is as follows .",
    "given @xmath0 , we consider a function @xmath1 from @xmath2 to @xmath2 . the argument @xmath3 ranges over @xmath4 @xmath5 @xmath6 , where @xmath7 ;",
    "@xmath8 is said to be the size of the problem .",
    "we assume that @xmath1 has the following properties :    * it is a 2-to-1 function , namely for any @xmath9 there is one and only one second argument @xmath10 such that @xmath11 and @xmath12 ; * such @xmath3 and @xmath13 are evenly spaced by a constant value @xmath14 , namely : @xmath15 ; * given a value @xmath3 of the argument , computing the corresponding value of @xmath1 requires a time polynomial in @xmath8 [ poly@xmath16 ; whereas , given a value @xmath17 of the function , finding an @xmath3 such that @xmath18 , requires a time exponential in @xmath8 [ exp@xmath16 ; the function is `` hard to reverse '' .",
    "besides knowing the above properties , we can use a quantum computer that , given any input @xmath3 , produces the output @xmath1 in poly@xmath19 time .",
    "the problem is to find @xmath20 in an efficient way , which turns out to be in poly@xmath21 rather than exp@xmath21 time .",
    "the computer operates on two registers @xmath22 and @xmath23 , each of @xmath8 qubits ; @xmath22 contains the argument @xmath3 and @xmath23  initially set at zero  will contain the result of computing @xmath1 .",
    "we denote by @xmath24 , with @xmath25 running over @xmath26 , the hilbert space of the two registers .    by using the quantum computer and standard operations like the hadamard transform ( see iv  for details ) , we obtain in poly@xmath21 time , at time @xmath27 , the following state of the two registers ( indexes are as in iv ) :    @xmath28    with @xmath3 running over @xmath4 @xmath5 @xmath6 .",
    "we designate by @xmath29 $ ] ( an observable ) the number stored in register @xmath22 .",
    "similarly @xmath30 $ ] is the number stored in @xmath23 .",
    "we measure @xmath30 $ ] in state ( 1 ) . given the character of @xmath1 , measurement outcome has the form :    @xmath31    where @xmath32 is the value of the measured observable , and @xmath33    we will see that , under a reasonable criterion , the quantum speed - up has already been achieved by reaching state ( 2 )  see also section iv .",
    "since the speed - up is referred to an efficient classical computation that yields the same result , the quantum character of state ( 2 ) constitutes a difficulty .",
    "this difficulty can be avoided by resorting to the notion of the computational cost of classically producing the _ description _ of state ( 2 ) .",
    "this criterion yields a more universal way of comparing quantum and classical efficiency , and coincides with the usual one when the quantum algorithm has produced the `` classical reading ''",
    ". it will be instrumental in achieving an a - posteriori self - evident result .",
    "thus , we should assess the cost of classically producing description ( 2 ) .",
    "of course , we must think that @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 are appropriate numerical values .",
    "finding them requires solving the following system of numerical algebraic equations :    @xmath37    fig .",
    "1    it is convenient to resort to the network representation of equations ( 3 )  fig .",
    "the gate @xmath38 imposes that , if @xmath39 , then the output is 1 , if @xmath40 , then the output is 0 , and vice - versa . to impose @xmath41 , the output must be set at 1 .",
    "note that the network represents a system of algebraic equations : time is not involved and gates are just logical constraints .",
    "each of the two gates @xmath1 imposes that , if the input is @xmath3 , then the output is @xmath1 or , conversely , if the output is @xmath17 , then the input is an @xmath3 such that @xmath42    this network is hard to satisfy by classical means . because of the looped network topology , finding a valuation of @xmath43 and @xmath17 satisfying the network requires reversing @xmath1 at least once , which takes , by assumption , exp@xmath21 time .",
    "instead , the time to produce state ( 2 ) with simon s algorithm , is the sum of the poly@xmath21 time required to produce state ( 1 ) , and the time required to measure the observable @xmath30 $ ] in state ( 1 ) .",
    "this latter is independent of the entanglement between registers @xmath23 and @xmath22 and is simply linear in the number of qubits of register @xmath23 , namely in @xmath8 .",
    "the overall time is poly@xmath21 . under the above criterion ,",
    "the speed - up has already been achieved .",
    "we shall provide two ways of seeing the active role played by the action of measuring @xmath30 $ ] .    in section iii",
    ", we will show that measuring @xmath30 $ ] introduces and satisfies , in linear@xmath21 time , a system of algebraic equations in hilbert space ( the one - outcome constraint and consequent ones ) equivalent , under the above criterion , to the system of algebraic equations ( 3 ) .    here",
    ", this active role will be discussed at a conceptual level .",
    "the previous criterion needs to be extended .",
    "the computational cost of producing a quantum state starting from another quantum state will be benchmarked with the cost of classically producing the description of the former starting from the description of the latter .",
    "we shall instrumentally use the following way of thinking ( opposite to our view ) :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ quantum computation can produce a number of parallel outputs exponential in register size , at the cost of producing one output , but this `` exponential wealth '' is easily spoiled by the fact that quantum measurement reads only one output . _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _    let us examine the cost of classically deriving description ( 2 ) from description ( 1 ) .",
    "the latter can be visualized as the print - out of the sum of 2@xmath44 tensor products .",
    "loosely speaking , two values of @xmath3 such that @xmath45 , must be exp@xmath21 spaced .",
    "otherwise such a pair of values could be found in poly@xmath19 time by classical `` trial and error '' .",
    "the point is that the print - out would create a babel library effect . even for a small @xmath8",
    ", it would fill the entire known universe with , say , @xmath46 @xmath47 @xmath46 here , and @xmath46 @xmath48 @xmath46 [ such that @xmath49 in alpha centauri .",
    "finding such a pair of print - outs would still require exp@xmath21 time .",
    "the capability of directly accessing that `` exponential wealth '' would be vanified by its `` exponential dilution '' .",
    "quantum measurement , instead , _ distills _ the desired pair of arguments in a time  linear in @xmath8 .",
    "in fact , it does more than randomly selecting one measurement outcome ; by selecting _",
    "one _ outcome , it performs a logical operation ( selecting the two values of @xmath3 associated with the value of that outcome ) crucial for solving the problem .    the active role played by quantum measurement , complementary to the production of the parallel computation outputs ,",
    "is self - evident . in section iii",
    ", this role will be pinpointed in a rigorous way .",
    "it is easy to show that quantum measurement introduces and satisfies a system of algebraic equations equivalent to ( 3 ) . by going through elementary notions",
    ", we will highlight the pattern of a new form of computation .",
    "we shall first apply von neumann s model to the quantum measurement of @xmath50 $ ] in state ( 1 ) .",
    "this model is two steps .",
    "the first is a unitary evolution @xmath51 , leading from the state before measurement to a `` provisional description '' of the state after measurement :    @xmath52    @xmath53    where @xmath54 . here",
    "@xmath55 denotes a third register of @xmath8 qubits used to represent the state of the `` classical pointer '' in hilbert space .",
    "this is sharp in state ( 4 ) , before measurement interaction . in the state after measurement",
    "( 5 ) , @xmath56 runs over all the values of @xmath57 as stated before , the elapsed time @xmath58 is linear in @xmath8 ( the number of qubits in register @xmath23 ) .",
    "as well known , description ( 5 ) represents the appropriate entanglement between measured observable and classical pointer , but it must be reconciled with the empirical evidence that the pointer is in a sharp state .    the second step of von neumann s model amounts to be a _ reinterpretation _ of description ( 5 ) .",
    "the tensor products appearing in ( 5 ) become mutually exclusive measurement outcomes ( still at the same time @xmath59 ) of probability distribution the square modules of the respective probability amplitudes , as well known .",
    "this yields a measurement outcome of the form :    @xmath60    we can disregard the factor @xmath61 , and focus on the _ quantum _ part of the measurement outcome , @xmath62 , resulting from the reinterpretational step .",
    "we should note that this reinterpretation , as it is , does not involve the notion of time and is transparent to dynamics .",
    "interestingly , the speed - up stems out of the reinterpretation , i.e. by the constraint that there is only one measurement outcome .",
    "in fact , we will show that @xmath63 is the solution of a system of algebraic equations equivalent to ( 3 ) .",
    "these equations represent the following usual conditions introduced by quantum measurement : ( i ) the outcome of measuring @xmath30 $ ] must be a single eigenstate @xmath64 , anyone element of the set of all eigenstates @xmath65 ; ( ii ) this eigenstate must `` drag '' all the tensor products appearing in @xmath66 that contain it ; ( iii ) it must be a specific eigenstate @xmath67 , selected according to probability amplitudes .",
    "let @xmath68 be an `` unknown '' vector of @xmath69 ; @xmath25 runs over @xmath70 , and @xmath71 are complex _",
    "variables _ independent of each other up to normalization : @xmath72 the above conditions originate a system of three algebraic equations to be simultaneously satisfied by @xmath73 :    @xmath74    where @xmath75 is the projector on the hilbert subspace @xmath76 with @xmath3 running over @xmath2 and @xmath77 being fixed ; a @xmath78 satisfying eq .",
    "( 6 ) is a free linear combination of all the tensor products of @xmath69 containing @xmath79 ; this is condition ( i ) ;    @xmath80    @xmath81 , satisfying ( 6 ) and ( 7 ) becomes the projection of @xmath82 on @xmath83 this means that @xmath84 has `` dragged '' all the tensor products of @xmath85 containing it ; this is condition ( ii ) ;    @xmath86    with @xmath67 randomly selected as stated before .",
    "the solution of equations ( 6 - 8 ) is @xmath87 , indeed the quantum state after measurement .    to sum up",
    ", satisfying equations ( 6 - 8 ) is equivalent to performing the reinterpretational step of von neumann s model .",
    "this is transparent to measurement dynamics , namely to the first step of the model .",
    "thus , performing the first step gives `` for free '' ( without incurring any further dynamical cost ) the solution of ( 6 - 8 ) $ ] , which is linear in @xmath8 .",
    "@xcite provides a reformulation of von neumann s model that better fits the current approach . ] .",
    "this is equivalent to solving equations ( 3 ) , namely the classically hard part of the problem .",
    "this justifies the quantum speed - up .",
    "the capability of directly solving a system of algebraic equations , without having to execute an algorithm , comes from a peculiar feature .",
    "the determination of the measurement outcome ( i.e. of the solution ) is _ dually _ _ influenced _ by both the initial actions , required to prepare the state before measurement , and the logical - mathematical constraints introduced by the final measurement action .",
    "these constraints are in fact _ independent _ of the initial actions since they hold unaltered for _ all _ initial actions .    in simon s algorithm ,",
    "dual influence is what distills a proper pair of values of @xmath3 among an exponential number of such values , thus yielding the speed - up .",
    "conversely , the speed - up is the observable consequence of dual influence .",
    "dual influence can be seen as a special instance of time - symmetrized quantum measurement .",
    "whether this notion is purely interpretational or can have observable consequences is a controversial issue  as well known .",
    "unexpectedly , we have found a certainly observable consequence ( the speed - up ) in the context of quantum computation .",
    "it is worth noting that this consequence becomes observable _",
    "after _ the action of quantum measurement and dual influence .    summarizing , quantum computation turns out to belong to an entirely new paradigm where there is identity between implicit or algebraic definition of a solution and its physical determination .",
    "it is worth noting that this paradigm blurs a long - standing distinction ( of mathematical logic ) between the notions of `` implicit definition '' and `` computation '' .",
    "an implicit definition does not prescribe how to construct its object ( say , a string in some formal language ) .",
    "it only says that , demonstratedly , there exists such an object .",
    "for example , the numerical problems we are dealing with , implicitly or algebraically define their solutions .",
    "let us consider factorization : given the known product @xmath88 of two unknown prime numbers @xmath3 and @xmath89 , the numerical algebraic equation @xmath90 implicitly defines the values of @xmath91 and @xmath89 that satisfy it .",
    "equations ( 3 ) constitute a similar example .    in order to find the object of an implicit definition , the latter",
    "must be changed into an equivalent constructive definition , namely into an algorithm ( if possible , but it is always possible with the problems we are dealing with ) .",
    "an algorithm is an abstraction of the way things can be constructed in reality  inevitably in a model thereof  and prescribes a computation process that builds the object of the definition .",
    "the current notion of algorithm still reflects the way things can be constructed in the traditional classical reality ",
    "namely through a sequential process .",
    "turing machine computation and the boolean network representation of computation are examples of sequential computation .",
    "an algorithm specifies a one - way propagation of logical implication from a completely defined input to a completely defined output which contains the solution .",
    "it is thus meant to be executable through a dynamical process , namely through a one - way causality propagation .",
    "we can see that the essence of quantum computation , dual influence , is extraneous to the sequential notions of both algorithm and dynamics .",
    "in particular , quantum computation _ is not _",
    "`` quantum turing machine '' computation .",
    "in order to make our interpretation of the quantum speed - up more visible , we will follow the simplified version@xcite of simon s algorithm@xcite . with respect to the original version",
    ", we must confine ourselves to the case that the oracle gives us a 2-to-1 function @xmath92 such that    @xmath93 where @xmath94 denotes bitwise exclusive or .",
    "the problem is to find @xmath20 in poly(n ) time . with a  further simplification , as anticipated in section ii , we replace the above condition with the condition @xmath95 .    for the sake of clarity",
    ", the following table gives a trivial example .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     table i    the modified algorithm is given in fig .",
    "2  we should disregard @xmath96 for the time being .",
    "2    registers @xmath22 and @xmath23 undergo successive unitary transformations , either jointly or separately :    * the @xmath1 transform ( a reversible boolean gate in the time - diagram of computation  fig .",
    "3 ) leaves the content of register @xmath22 unaltered , so that an input @xmath3 is repeated in the corresponding output , and computes @xmath1 adding it to the former content of register @xmath23 ( which was set to zero ) .",
    "if the state is not sharp but is a quantum superposition , the same transformation applies to any tensor product appearing in it .",
    "3    * @xmath97 is the hadamard transform . on a single qubit @xmath98 , it operates as follows : @xmath99 @xmath100 . in the general case of a register of n qubits , containing the number @xmath101",
    ", it yields @xmath102 where @xmath7 , @xmath3 ranges over @xmath103 , @xmath6 , and @xmath104 denotes the module 2 inner product of the two numbers in binary notation ( they should be seen as row matrices ) . *",
    "@xmath105 represents the action of measuring the numerical content of a register .",
    "the algorithm proceeds through the following steps ( also applied to table i example ) :    1 .",

    "measure @xmath30 $ ] obtaining , say , @xmath110 ; the state after measurement is thus : + @xmath111 + we should note that , at this stage of the algorithm , it is _ equivalent _ to either perform or skip @xmath30 $ ] measurement ( see further below )",
    ". it will be easier to understand the algorithm and the reason of the speed - up if we assume that this measurement has been performed .",
    "the measurement outcome , @xmath112 , is naturally  dually influenced ( section iii ) .",

    "resources , in the class of quantum algorithms we are dealing with ( which yield an exponential speed up ) .",
    "after measuring @xmath1 , the state of the two registers becomes factorizable , and all entanglement is destroyed .",
    "the remaining actions , performed on register @xmath22 , use interference ( which generates no entanglement ) to `` extract '' @xmath20 out of the superposition @xmath113 . under the criterion introduced in section ii , we must conclude from another standpoint that the speed - up has been achieved by preparing @xmath114 .    1 .",

    "however , the result is apparently reached in a deterministic way , without any  active role of quantum measurement .",
    "this must be ascribed to an incomplete physical representation of the problem . in section iii",
    ", we had a problem that implicitly defined its solution , whereas this mathematical fact was physically represented by the quantum measurement of an entangled state .",
    "this obviously requires that the problem is physically represented were physically represented in a superposition of the form ( 1 ) . ] , whereas presently an essential part of it , the sphinx choosing the oracle mode , is not .",
    "first , we shall follow a most simple way of completing the physical representation . the sphinx random selection of the oracle mode will be performed through a suitable quantum measurement , after having run the algorithm .",
    "we introduce the extended gate @xmath161 which computes the function @xmath162 for all @xmath137 and @xmath3 .",
    "this gate has an ancillary input register @xmath163 ( @xmath163 for mode ) which contains @xmath164 , namely the oracle mode [ figure 4(b ) gives the extended algorithm ] .",
    "this input is identically repeated in a corresponding output  to keep gate reversibility .",

    "the former implicit definition of the problem solution appears here in the form of the mutual definition of the moves of the two players .",
    "reaching state ( 11 ) with quantum parallel computation still requires one oracle run .    the action of measuring @xmath169 $ ] in state ( 11 ) , equivalent to the sphinx choice of the oracle mode , by bringing in and satisfying equations ( 6 - 8 ) of section iii must be changed into @xmath170 .",
    "] , transforms mutual definition into correlation between individual outputs ( like in an epr situation ) . in other words ,",
    "the sphinx choice of @xmath137 simultaneously determines oedipus answer @xmath160 ",
    "retrievable by measuring @xmath29 $ ] . in the classical framework instead",
    ", the sphinx choice should necessarily be propagated to oedipus answer by means of an algorithm , in fact through the computation of @xmath151 ( requiring two oracle runs ) .    achieving",
    "the speed - up still involves the interplay between the reversible preparation of an entangled state before measurement and a final measurement action , namely dual influence  here of an epr kind .",
    "it should be noted that the above `` complete physical representation '' is not the original deutsch s algorithm . this can readily be fixed . to this end , the sphinx must randomly select the mode before giving the oracle ",
    "i.e. the quantum gate @xmath161  to oedipus .",
    "this means that oedipus receives the oracle in an input state randomly selected among four possible quantum states , corresponding to the modes @xmath171 this is indistinguishable from a mixture .",
    "therefore , the preparation at time @xmath172 becomes :    @xmath173    where @xmath174 , @xmath175 and @xmath176 are independent random phases  this is the random phase representation of a mixture@xcite .",
    "after @xmath172 , the algorithm goes on as before yielding    @xmath177 \\left ( \\left| 0\\right\\rangle _ { v}-\\left| 1\\right\\rangle _ { v}\\right ) .\\ ] ]    clearly , the roles of entanglement , quantum measurement and dual influence remain unaltered .",
    "the rules of the game are the same as before .",
    "this time we have the set of the @xmath178 functions @xmath179 such that @xmath180 , where @xmath181 is the kronecker symbol .",
    "we shall consider the simplest instance @xmath182 .",
    "this yields four functions @xmath150 , labeled by @xmath183 .",
    "figure 5(a ) gives grover s algorithm@xcite ( in the standard version provided in @xcite for @xmath182 . let us assume the sphinx has chosen @xmath184 .",
    "the preparation is @xmath185 . without entering into detail , the state before measurement is : @xmath186 .",
    "measuring @xmath29 $ ] deterministically yields oedipus answer .",

    "again , we have the mutual definition of the sphinx choice and oedipus answer . measuring @xmath169 $ ] selects the sphinx choice and oedipus answer at the same time , as in the previous oracle problem .",
    "quantum computation is concerned with the efficient solution of numerical algebraic problems .",
    "we shall first summarize the main results of this work .",
    "we have shown that the action of measuring an observable in a suitably entangled state , introduces and satisfies a system of algebraic equations . in all existing quantum algorithms ,",
    "this system represents the problem that algebraically defines its solution .",
    "moreover , measurement time is independent of entanglement .",
    "this justifies the quantum speed - up in all types of quantum algorithms found so far .",
    "quantum computation turns out to be an entirely new paradigm ( extraneous to the notion of sequential computation ) where there is identity between the algebraic definition of a solution and its physical determination .",
    "the capability of directly solving a system of algebraic equations , is related to the feature that the determination of the measurement outcome is dually influenced by both the reversible initial actions , leading to the state before measurement , and by the logical - mathematical constraints introduced by the final measurement action .",
    "dual influence is extraneous to the notion of sequential process , namely of dynamical , one - way propagation .",
    "although our explanation of the speed - up appears a - posteriori to be simple and evident , it is likely to displace rather common views . in the first place , it is reasonable to assume that quantum algorithms are commonly thought to be , in fact , algorithms , namely the quantum transposition of sequential turing machine . at the light of the results of this work ,",
    "this way of thinking would be a classical vestige , ruling out the active role of quantum measurement and dual influence .    in the second place",
    ", there is a widespread belief that quantum theory can do without the measurement problem . in other words ,",
    "the fact that the mutual exclusivity of the possible measurement outcomes comes from an ad - hoc reinterpretation of a state superposition ( of a mixture , in decoherence theory ) would be a price paid once for all .",
    "there would be no further consequences on quantum theory .",
    "in contrast with this , we have highlighted a striking consequence in the context of quantum computation . here",
    "the `` reinterpretation '' implies dual influence , which yields a completely observable speed - up .        from the other hand ,",
    "having ascertained that quantum algorithms are more than sequential computation , might open the way to unforeseen prospects in the quest of new forms of computation . for example , quantum measurement of an observable in an entangled state is a _ projection _ on a hilbert subspace subject to certain constraints whose satisfaction amounts to efficiently solving a problem . in some respect , this feature is similar to the projections due to particle statistics symmetrizations .",
    "therefore , investigating the possibility of exploiting such symmetrizations in problem solving could be an interesting prospect .",
    "@xcite , @xcite provide still abstract attempts in this direction .",
    "more generally , this work highlights the essential role played by non - dynamical effects in quantum computation .",
    "let us mention in passing that a form of quantum computation which is of geometric rather than dynamical origin has recently been provided @xcite .",
    "this concretely shows that there are ways of getting out of the usual quantum computation paradigm ."
