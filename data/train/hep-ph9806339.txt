    "while neutrino - oscillation experiments tend to suffer from systematic errors that are difficult to estimate , there are at least two distinct neutrino problems that deserve serious consideration : the deficit of solar neutrinos and the atmospheric neutrino composition .",
    "the former has been around for many years .",
    "it started with the pioneering homestake detector and later gained significance with the water - scattering and gallium experiments @xcite .",
    "the latter anomaly is an inconsistency between the number of detected neutrinos of the muon family and those of the electron family , assumed to be generated by cosmic - ray hadrons impinging on the atmosphere .",
    "the ratio of ratios @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the number of @xmath9-like events and @xmath10 the number of @xmath11-like events , should be , according to theory , close to 1 , but is instead around @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "if one analyses the solar - neutrino deficit ( a summary of the chlorine @xcite , gallium @xcite and water - scattering experiments @xcite is given in table [ experiment ] ) in terms of two - flavour mixing , the vacuum - oscillation solution leads to a set of disconnected regions in the two - dimensional parameter space spanned by @xmath13 and @xmath0 , according to the @xmath14 survival probability @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the mixing angle , @xmath0 the difference of the squared masses , @xmath17 the time since creation and @xmath18 the neutrino energy .",
    "the favoured region is @xmath190.9 , with @xmath20 , but neighbouring regions that differ from @xmath0 by @xmath21 can yield comparable values of @xmath22 , provided @xmath23 is a small integer , and @xmath24 is of the order of @xmath25 ( cf .",
    "1a ) that are several orders of magnitude higher . ] .",
    "the scale @xmath24 is given by the characteristics of the detectors , the neutrino energy ( of the order of a mev ) and the distance @xmath26 from the sun to the earth : @xmath27 .",
    "the probability expression ( [ protwogen ] ) and fig .",
    "1a show the ` just so ' character of vacuum oscillations , the mass - squared difference has to be fine - tuned in relation to the sun ",
    "earth distance if this model shall solve the solar - neutrino problem @xcite .",
    "( the allowed region in the upper part of fig .  1a , where @xmath28 , is a new feature of the most recent data @xcite . )    with three flavours of neutrinos , one may consider the general three - flavour mixing , in which a state , which is of pure flavour @xmath29 ( @xmath30 , @xmath9 , @xmath31 ) at @xmath32 , evolves as @xmath33 where the summation index @xmath34 runs over mass states .",
    "we write the unitary mixing matrix as @xmath35.\\ ] ] the full parameter space then consists of three angles ( we ignore @xmath36-violating effects ) and two independent squared - mass differences ( the energy can be approximated as @xmath37 ) .",
    "in particular , the survival probability of an electron neutrino takes the form @xmath38,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath39 .",
    "unitarity and data on other phenomena , in particular on the atmospheric neutrino flux , lead to constraints on these parameters .",
    "we denote the mass states @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 , according to their intrinsic mass ratio : their respective mass eigenvalues will be sorted as @xmath43 . for the mixing matrix we use the form advocated for quarks by the particle data group @xcite violation is included . ] : @xmath44,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath45 , @xmath46 , etc . , and the mixing angles @xmath47 are in the interval @xmath48 $ ] .",
    "a three - flavour analysis of the solar - neutrino oscillations will restrict the allowed values of the elements in the mixing matrix . because of unitarity",
    ", the solar electron - neutrino survival probability can always be expressed in terms of only _ two _ mixing angles , here taken to be @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "we shall assume that the dominant mixing ( represented in fig .",
    "1a ) is a mixing between the first two families , and ask ( i ) ` how will the goodness of fit depend on @xmath3 ' and ( ii ) ` how will the allowed regions of fig .",
    "1a change as one increases the strength of this mixing ? '    before we address these questions , we want to introduce some further restrictions on the neutrino parameters : we reserve one @xmath0 for the vacuum - oscillation solution of the solar - neutrino problem , @xmath51 .",
    "the suppression of atmospheric muon neutrinos relative to electron neutrinos suggests that also @xmath52 oscillates into some other flavour of neutrinos , but ( since the ratio @xmath53 relevant to atmospheric neutrinos is orders of magnitudes smaller than that for solar neutrinos ) with a mass - squared difference that is many orders of magnitude larger than is required to explain the solar - neutrino deficit .",
    "it is therefore natural to assume that other squared - mass differences are much larger : @xmath54 such that when eq .",
    "( [ probunav ] ) is applied to the case of solar neutrinos , the last two terms can be represented by their average values : @xmath55 here , the last term represents a non - zero component of the @xmath42 mass state in the electron - neutrino state , and vanishes with @xmath56 . for @xmath57 we get the familiar two - family mixing of eq .",
    "( [ protwogen ] ) .",
    "while a simultaneous fit to both solar- and atmospheric - neutrino fluxes also would involve the angle @xmath58 as well as two mass - squared differences , under the assumption ( [ assumption ] ) the above formula ( [ avsurvival ] ) provides a three - parameter accommodation of the solar flux .",
    "we show in fig .",
    "[ parameterspace1]b the results of two - parameter fits to the solar - neutrino data .",
    "( the high region in @xmath0 , cf .  fig .",
    "[ parameterspace1]a , is not displayed here . ) in our calculations we use the solar - neutrino flux as given by the 1998 standard solar model ( ssm ) by bahcall , basu and pinsonneault @xcite , and for the detection rates the values given in table [ experiment ] .",
    "the second mixing angle , @xmath50 , is held fixed at different values , and the fit is performed in the variables @xmath2 and @xmath59 .",
    "it is seen that regions that are separated in the two - family case , can be smoothed out to one big region when the more general case of three flavours is considered .",
    "however , there is a slight worsening of the quality of the fit as the coupling to the third state is increased . for @xmath60 , 0.2 , and 0.4 ,",
    "the values of @xmath61 are 3.6 , 4.2 and 5.6 , respectively . for two degrees of freedom ,",
    "4 experiments ( sage and gallex are combined ) minus 2 parameters , the probability of getting @xmath22 larger than those values by chance , are 17 , 12 and 6% , respectively .",
    "none of these is particularly good , but they are not excluded .",
    "since there is some uncertainty associated with the important boron flux @xcite , we have checked how the fit changes under 10% rescalings of the @xmath62 flux . in table  2 we show the resulting @xmath61 and goodness of fit for three different fractions of the ssm boron flux ( keeping the other components of the flux fixed ) , for two different values of @xmath3 . for the lowest of these fractions ,",
    "the goodness of fit is appreciably better than for the standard @xmath62-flux .",
    "it is also seen that , for the lowest of our tabulated boron flux values , the fit deteriorates less when @xmath63 is non - zero .    a different representation , for several values of @xmath63 ,",
    "is given in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , including also the higher-@xmath0 region . as @xmath63 increases , the allowed regions get broader , but also the fit gets poorer .    it has been argued that the data suggest ` maximal mixing ' @xcite . in our variables ,",
    "maximal mixing corresponds to @xmath64 and @xmath65 .",
    "we find that the fit gets rather poor for such parameters , with @xmath66 .",
    "the future long - baseline experiments @xcite will provide new restrictions on these mixing elements . for example , if we assume that a long - baseline experiment is such that oscillations other than those involving @xmath67 can be neglected , then the condition ( [ assumption ] ) leads to the following transition probabilities : @xmath68 @xmath69 and the survival probability : @xmath70 note that the coefficient in eq .",
    "( [ mutoe ] ) can be written as @xmath71 .",
    "the @xmath72 transition can thus be given a simple physical interpretation , valid for small values of the mixing angle @xmath50 .",
    "when @xmath73 , the transition can be interpreted as an ` indirect ' transition , involving the admixtures of @xmath42 as given by @xmath50 and @xmath58 .",
    "this is different from the case of @xmath74 , where the ` direct ' transition @xmath75 is effective via the states @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "the atmospheric - neutrino data are usually explained in terms of @xmath76 or @xmath1 oscillations with a large amplitude @xcite . when applying eq .",
    "( [ avsurvival ] ) to explain the solar - neutrino deficit , the transition @xmath1 is preferable for the atmospheric neutrinos , because it allows for a small or vanishing value of @xmath50 , which gives the best fit of the observed solar neutrino rate . an early three - flavour analysis ( not including data from super - kamiokande ) gave for the best fit a value for @xmath56 ( or @xmath77 ) in the range 0.060.14 @xcite .",
    "more recent studies ( including super - kamiokande data ) prefer values for @xmath63 of 0.1 @xcite and @xmath78 @xcite .",
    "as we have seen , these low values of @xmath63 also lead to acceptable fits to the solar - neutrino data , with @xmath795.6 . in the long - baseline experiments",
    "@xcite , neutrinos from either an accelerator or a reactor will be counted after travelling a ` long ' distance , from 1 km ( for chooz ) to 730 km ( for the minos experiment ) .",
    "in fact , the recent data from the chooz experiment , where the survival probability @xmath80 is measured , does not exclude any of the cases studied in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , provided @xmath81 .",
    "indeed , no evidence for oscillations was found for @xmath82 _ and _ @xmath83 .",
    "this means that @xmath63 has to be either small ( @xmath84 ) or quite big ( @xmath85 ) ( or @xmath86 ) . with the large - angle solution ,",
    "eq  ( [ avsurvival ] ) gives a poor fit to the solar - neutrino data , this alternative should therefore be disregarded . the remaining low - angle solution is also preferred in the analysis of the atmospheric - neutrino data @xcite . in this case",
    "( with @xmath82 ) the lower two boxes of fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] would be excluded .",
    "the bugey reactor experiment @xcite , which is less sensitive , excludes @xmath87 down to about @xmath88 for @xmath89 , consistent with chooz .    a measurement of a non - zero value for @xmath90 will imply a non - zero value for @xmath50 .",
    "such information , which would be a major result from the planned long - baseline experiments , combined with eq .",
    "( [ avsurvival ] ) , can help us to further restrict the allowed parameter space relevant to the solar neutrinos .",
    "we note that , for @xmath91 oscillations , the k2k experiment @xcite will have a sensitivity of @xmath92 and the minos experiment could probe values as low as @xmath93 . in our parametrization , this means that they would be sensitive to values of @xmath63 as low as 0.16 and 0.05 .",
    "if this mixing element should turn out to be significantly larger , the vacuum - oscillation solution to the solar - neutrino problem would have serious difficulties .",
    "the data from the solar - neutrino detectors can very well be reconciled with the atmospheric - neutrino data .",
    "if we assume that the solution of the latter anomaly is the @xmath1 transition ( which is induced by the direct mixing @xmath58 and gives the best fit ) , then the vacuum - oscillation solution for the atmospheric and the solar - neutrino problems can be regarded as two separate two - generation oscillations . even if the transition @xmath76 , which for @xmath94 is induced by the two - step process of @xmath95 and @xmath96 mixing ( with angles @xmath50 and @xmath58 , respectively ) should turn out to take place , the rate has to be quite large before it can severely alter the fit of the vacuum - oscillation solution to the solar - neutrino problem .",
    "when the @xmath95 mixing angle @xmath50 is increased from zero , the allowed ranges of @xmath59 merge to a wider one , but beyond @xmath97 , which is well within the sensitivity that will be reached by the k2k experiment , the fit deteriorates rapidly .",
