    "it is generally accepted that total cross sections of @xmath0 and @xmath1 interactions at high energies are the same @xmath8 also elastic cross sections are equal @xmath9 and differential elastic cross sections are equal @xmath10 .",
    "it follows from the pomeranchuk theorem  @xcite , which was proved for constant total cross sections in condition @xmath11 .",
    "this theorem was generalized by iden  @xcite for increasing total cross sections , which fulfill the froissare theorem .",
    "it is also generally accepted that multiplicity properties of @xmath0 and @xmath1 interactions , such as inclusive cross sections and distributions of charged particles are the same .    in the paper  @xcite",
    "we have shown that inclusive cross sections of @xmath1 scattering @xmath12 are larger than inclusive cross sections of @xmath0 scattering @xmath13 at @xmath2  gev .",
    "the atlas coll .",
    "have published data  @xcite on inclusive cross sections from which it follows that @xmath14 for pseudorapidity @xmath7 in interval of transverse momenta up to @xmath15  gev / c .    the alice coll . confirmed this result  @xcite for @xmath16 and transverse momenta up to @xmath17  gev / c .    in the present work",
    "we will show that ratio  ( [ 1 ] ) is equal to @xmath18    we have estimated the value @xmath19 both for pseudorapidity intervals @xmath16 and @xmath7 .",
    "we are based on the low constituents number model ( lcnm )  @xcite , @xcite , @xcite which can be represented as follows .    \\1 . on the first step before the collision",
    "there is small number of constituents in initial hadrons . in every hadron",
    "there are components either with only valence quarks or with valence quarks and one additional gluon .    \\2 . on the second step the hadrons interaction",
    "is carried out by gluon exchange between the valence quarks and initial gluons .",
    "the hadrons gain the color charge .",
    "\\3 . on the third step after interaction",
    "the colored hadrons move apart and when the distance between them becomes larger than the confinement radius , the lines of color electric field gather into the string .",
    "this string breaks out into secondary hadrons .",
    "hadrons production in this model is depicted by phenomenological diagrams in fig .  1 .",
    "solid lines correspond to valence quarks and antiquarks .",
    "wavy line corresponds to exchanging gluon , which performs the interaction .",
    "additional gluons are also represented by wavy lines , one in every projectile hadron .",
    "formation of color field string ( shown as spiral ) and its breakup to secondary hadrons takes place at the third stage .",
    "this process corresponds to interaction in final state .",
    "it should be noted that there is subprocesses of hadrons production from three quark strings in @xmath1 interaction .",
    "there is no such subprocess in @xmath0 interaction .",
    "this subprocess defines the difference in inclusive cross sections and multiplicity distributions in @xmath0 and @xmath1 .     and @xmath1 scattering in the lcnm .",
    "]    we consider only one gluon exchange , this is our hypothesis .",
    "therefore interaction between components with only valence quarks both in @xmath0 and @xmath1 leads to separation of color charges with octet quantum numbers .",
    "since we consider only one gluon exchange , there is no three - sheet configuration which was proposed in  @xcite , @xcite in the diagram with only valence quarks in proton and valence antiquarks in antiproton .",
    "let us define topological inclusive cross section of production of one charged particle in case with @xmath20 charged particles    @xmath21    where @xmath22  topological cross sections of @xmath20 charged particles production .",
    "we consider only non single diffractive events so @xmath23    here we are based on the ua5 coll .",
    "data  @xcite on the inclusive cross sections in 9 multiplicity bins : @xmath24 , @xmath25 ,  , @xmath26 . in accordance with ua5 coll .",
    "we define inclusive cross sections in every of these bins ( @xmath27 ) @xmath28 which are normalized as follows @xmath29 where @xmath30  probability of @xmath20 charged particles production in non single diffractive event .",
    "inasmuch as we consider that inclusive cross sections of @xmath0 and @xmath1 are different we write down relation  ( [ 6 ] ) separately for @xmath0 and @xmath1 @xmath31    it was shown in  @xcite that @xmath32  cross section of single diffractive events is the same for @xmath0 and @xmath1 interactions at high energies .",
    "therefore cross section @xmath33 is also the same for @xmath0 and @xmath1 interactions .    from ratio of @xmath1 over @xmath0 in ( [ 7 ] )",
    "we obtain the following relation @xmath34 value of @xmath35 does not depend on momentum of observed particle @xmath36 .",
    "therefore one of solutions of ( [ 8 ] ) ( perhaps , the only solution ) has the form @xmath37 ( if @xmath0 and @xmath1 interactions are the same then we obtain a trivial result . )",
    "factorization of inclusive cross sections results from the agk theorem  @xcite , so we can write down @xmath38 where @xmath39  inclusive distribution on pseudorapidity .",
    "it is easy to show from the equation  ( [ 9 ] ) that @xmath40 therefore from ratio of @xmath1 over @xmath0 in ( [ 10 ] ) we can obtain strict equality @xmath41    in the paper  @xcite we have obtained the inclusive cross sections @xmath42 in @xmath0 interactions at @xmath2  gev .",

    "it should be noted that the relation  ( [ 10 ] ) must be fulfilled in region of soft physics for transverse momenta up to @xmath44  gev / c , where the agk theorem is valid .",
    "therefore , in this region the ratio of inclusive cross sections @xmath45    the comparison of experimental results of collaborations atlas and alice for @xmath0 with results of the ua1 coll .",
    "@xcite for @xmath1 is shown in fig .  3 together with our estimation ( graphs are taken from @xcite and @xcite ) . in our opinion ,",
    "these data show that inclusive cross sections of @xmath1 interaction exceed inclusive cross sections of @xmath0 interaction .",

    "this question demands thorough analysis .",
    "it should be noted that the presence of inelastic subprocess of hadrons production from three quark strings might be important in nucleus - nucleus collisions . protons and antiprotons produced from the first collisions",

    "we think that atlas coll . discovered a new effect  the difference in multiparticle production in @xmath0 and @xmath1 interactions .",
