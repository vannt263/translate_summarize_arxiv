    "recent measurements of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) anisotropy power spectrum by the mat  @xcite , boomerang  @xcite and maxima  @xcite experiments suggest the universe is nearly spatially flat , with a total density , @xmath0 , very close to unity . at the same time , there is ample evidence from observations , including cmb power spectrum  @xcite , galaxy clustering statistics  @xcite , peculiar velocities  @xcite and the baryon mass fraction in clusters of galaxies  @xcite that the density of the clumped ( ie : baryonic and dark ) matter in the universe is substantially lower , being of the order of 30% of the critical value ( @xmath1 ) . additionally the evidence from the spectral and photometric observations of type ia supernovae  @xcite seem to suggest that the universe is undergoing accelerated expansion at the present epoch ( see e.g.  @xcite and references therein ) .    one way of explaining this seemingly diverse set of observations is to postulate that a substantial proportion of the energy density of the universe is in the form of a dark component that makes up the difference between the critical and matter energy densities , which is smooth on cosmological scales and which possesses a negative pressure .",
    "various alternatives have been put forward as candidates for this dark component .",
    "one such candidate is a cosmological constant .",
    "this choice , however , involves an undesirable fine tuning problem , in that the ratio of the cosmological constant and the matter energy densities in the early universe need to be set to an infinitesimal value to ensure their near - coincidence at the present epoch .",
    "an alternative - and arguably more attractive - candidate is quintessence . though little",
    "is known about the actual composition of quintessence , it has been shown that , should it exist , quintessence can in general be modeled as a scalar field rolling in a potential  @xcite , an approach we adopt here .",
    "additionally , it has been shown that some scalar field quintessence models have the appealing property of possessing attractor - type solutions for which the quintessence energy density closely tracks the energy density of the rest of the universe through most of its history  @xcite .",
    "the presence of such attractor - type solutions implies that their asymptotic behavior is largely independent of initial conditions .",
    "this allows the quintessence energy in the early universe to be comparable to that of the rest of the universe , thus providing the possibility of removing the fine - tuning problem that exists with the cosmological constant .",
    "ultimately , any successful cosmological model must be based on a theory of high energy physics , such as the string theory , m - theory or supergravity .",
    "these models are much more complex than is generally allowed for in usual studies of tracking",
    ". for tracking quintessence to be truly free from fine - tuning problems , the tracking phenomena must be robust in the more complicated and complete cosmological settings that derive from such high energy physics theories .",
    "such scenarios typically include many scalar fields ( some of which may not have potentials suitable for tracking ) , a hubble law different from that of the friedmann - lemaitre - robertson - walker ( flrw ) model at high energies and scalar field effective potentials that depend explicitly on the scale factor ( or equivalently , temperature ) .",
    "tracking would be of limited use as a solution to the fine - tuning problem if it was destroyed by the inclusion of such effects .",
    "the aim of this paper is to study the robustness of tracking in a more complete framework , by considering the effects of the three types of generalizations mentioned above .",
    "though these additions make the resulting cosmological model more complex , it is important to consider their effects because in a realistic cosmology motivated by high - energy physics they are likely to be present , and because their inclusion leads to qualitatively new effects as well as new constraints .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows . in section",
    "[ eqns - fixed ] we begin with the equations of motion for @xmath2  scalar fields , with possible scale - factor dependent potentials as well as a non - flrw expansion rate , and derive the corresponding fixed points . in section [ sectioniii ]",
    "we discuss how the tracking attractor - type solutions can be understood as a shadowing of instantaneous fixed points .",
    "section [ sectioniv ] contains our analysis of the stability of this shadowing and the independence of the attractors from the initial conditions .",
    "finally section [ sectionv ] contains our conclusions .",
    "in a general cosmological scenario inspired by high - energy physics , one expects the presence of a number of additional ingredients , among them : multiple scalar fields , generalized hubble expansion laws and potentials that decay with expansion .",
    "multiple scalar fields ( @xmath3 , @xmath4 ) arise naturally in theories of high energy physics .",
    "generalized hubble expansion laws ( with @xmath5 ) different from the standard flrw hubble law @xmath6 can arise from corrections arising from the specific model one is considering .",
    "two concrete examples being the modified hubble law appearing in a braneworld scenario  @xcite , and the effect of varying the strength of gravity .",
    "explicit dependence of the potential on the scale factor can come about as an effective potential due to the interaction of @xmath7 with another field , which has been ` integrated out ' , but with an energy density that decays with expansion - thus making the effective potential it induces for @xmath7 also decay with expansion . here",
    "we shall employ potentials of the form @xmath8 , where @xmath9 are constants and @xmath10 is the logarithm of the scale factor .",
    "note that @xmath11 represents an explicit scale - factor , or equivalently , temperature , dependence in the potential @xmath12 of the field .",
    "this does not allow for direct coupling between tracking fields , but rather coupling between tracking fields and the field that has been implicitly integrated out .",
    "the choice of @xmath13 corresponds to the usual form of a scale factor - independent tracking potential .",
    "the evolution of such cosmological models is governed by the equations in such a system .",
    "however , note that the integrating out of the second field @xmath14 is done by deriving the full equations of motion for @xmath15 and @xmath14 , solving them and substituting @xmath16 into the equation of motion for @xmath15 , then defining a @xmath17 such that the @xmath18 equation of motion has the form @xmath19 .",

    "( [ xyrhobg_eom_a ] ) with @xmath34 however , this transformation does not encompass the effect of the modified expansion rate on the evolution of @xmath33 .",
    "thus such an effect can qualitatively alter the nature of the attractor solution ( see for example  @xcite ) .",
    "we shall return to this case in section  [ sectioniii ] .",
    "in the following we shall also use the physically transparent set of variables @xmath35 and @xmath36 , in terms of which the above evolution equations become @xmath37 \\ ; ; \\ ; \\ ; \\ ; r_{i}\\equiv \\left| \\lambda _ { i}\\right| \\sqrt{\\frac{\\omega _ { \\phi i}}{3\\left ( \\widehat{\\gamma } _",

    "we have calculated these fixed points for the systems ( [ xyrhobg_eom_a ] ) and ( [ eom_omegagamma ] ) and the results are summarized in tables  [ tab_fixpnts_a ] and  [ tab_fixpnts_b ] . included",
    "are the existence conditions as well as the required ranges of the @xmath33 and @xmath45 .",
    "these are the generalizations of the fixed points given by  @xcite , to the case of models with @xmath2 scalar fields and generalized temperature dependent potentials ( with @xmath46 ) .",
    "note that in the single field case , in the @xmath13 limit , points @xmath47 through @xmath48 correspond to the fixed points found in  @xcite , while fixed points @xmath49 and @xmath50 are new .    for @xmath51",
    "all the fixed points satisfy @xmath52 , which implies @xmath53 . as can be seen from tables  [ tab_fixpnts_a ] and  [ tab_fixpnts_b ] , the fixed points that are most interesting for cosmological model building fall into two groups : @xmath47 and @xmath54 .",
    "these exist for @xmath55 and @xmath56 and can be represented by @xmath57 or @xmath58 which are only valid for @xmath59 .",
    "note that the effective equation of state is @xmath60 , which is independent of the value of @xmath45 .",
    "interestingly , the actual equation of state @xmath61 will decrease as @xmath45 increases so as to maintain @xmath60 : @xmath62 for all points other than types @xmath47 and @xmath54 , the equation of state of the field is fixed to be either @xmath63 or @xmath64 , which must be the same as the average equation of state @xmath65 ( and the equation of state of the background @xmath66 if @xmath67 ) .",
    "thus , from the point of view of the other fields , which see only the expansion rate , one can always absorb the fields at points other than @xmath47 and @xmath54 by a redefinition of the background @xmath68 , and relabeling the @xmath54 point by @xmath47 if @xmath69 .",
    "no generality is lost because this redefinition of the background has no effect on the expansion rate , and it is only through the expansion rate that one field can affect another . in the following discussion we shall drop the tilde in @xmath70 , and by @xmath71",
    "we shall mean the total background @xmath72 plus the contributions from @xmath3 at fixed points other than @xmath47 and @xmath54 .",
    "thus in the light of above discussion , we shall only concentrate on the fixed points of type @xmath47 and @xmath54 and consider the following two possible scenarios :    1 .",
    "@xmath69 : in this case each field @xmath73 is at the fixed point of type @xmath47 .",
    "the average equation of state is the same as the background ( @xmath74 ) and the the fields can track the background energy density , making this point the most relevant for quintessence .",
    "the @xmath35 are in this case given by eq .",
    "( [ fixpnt_main_omega ] ) to be @xmath75 for this arrangement to exist as a fixed point one requires @xmath76 note that modestly larger values of the @xmath45 make point @xmath54 less likely and point @xmath47 more likely ( because it is harder for the fields , for a given set of @xmath33 , to come to dominate the total energy density ) .",
    "thus the presence of @xmath77 generally makes tracking ( point @xmath47 ) more robust .",
    "@xmath78 : in this case each field @xmath73 is at the fixed point of type @xmath54 and we have @xmath79 now summing over @xmath80 , one finds @xmath81 where @xmath82 and @xmath83 are given by @xmath84 note that @xmath85 is analogous to @xmath86 in the single - field case with @xmath13 .",
    "one can make an analogy with parallel resistors in electrostatics , whereby the smallest @xmath87 dominates @xmath88 . in the case of @xmath89 ,",
    "the results of previous work concerning assisted - inflation  @xcite are recovered .",
    "note also that because @xmath90 , @xmath91 .",
    "however , the ensemble of fixed points does not exist for this entire range of values : they only exist if @xmath92 $ ] and @xmath93 $ ] .",
    "one has @xmath94 , which , in turn , fixes all of the @xmath95 .",
    "this arrangement does not exist as a fixed point for @xmath96 or @xmath97    .*points available for @xmath98 : * [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     it turns out that point @xmath47 is more interesting for tracking quintessence models than @xmath54 , as the latter is generally ruled out by a number of observational constraints , such as big bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) and structure formation  @xcite .",
    "however , point @xmath54 has been studied in scenarios where the domination of the scalar fields is desirable , such as in the case of assisted inflation  @xcite .",
    "point @xmath47 exists for @xmath74 , while point @xmath54 is only stable for @xmath99 ( recall we are considering fixed @xmath33 ( @xmath100 ) ; the situation changes significantly when @xmath33 varies , as will be shown in the next section ) .",
    "we also note that points @xmath47 and @xmath54 both require @xmath101 . of course if @xmath102 for some @xmath73 , that field becomes unstable but will generally have its corresponding @xmath103 , thus making it harmless as a source of instability .",
    "in this section we study the possibility of tracking in presence of variable @xmath104 . before doing this for the more general system ( [ eom_omegagamma ] ) , we begin by introducing the notion of tracking in the context of the simpler case of single scalar field models and briefly discuss how tracking might solve the fine - tuning problem , as was shown in  @xcite .",
    "consider the case with one scalar field , @xmath105 , and with the usual form of the potential given by @xmath106 and @xmath107 .",
    "assuming @xmath86 to be a constant , the fixed points become ` true ' fixed points , given by @xmath108 for large enough @xmath86 , the system will be attracted to point @xmath47 , and since asymptotically @xmath109 , this offers a plausible solution to the fine - tuning problem .",
    "however , with a constant @xmath86 , @xmath110 is also constant , which implies that one can not have a significant contribution from quintessence to the present energy density ( @xmath111 ) and at the same time satisfy the nucleosynthesis or structure formation bounds  @xcite ( @xmath112 ) . to make the model compatible with observations ,",
    "a variable @xmath86 is required which has decreased from a large value in the early universe to order of a few today .",
    "making @xmath86 variable , however , means that the fixed points are no longer true fixed points , and the question becomes what determines the asymptotic dynamics of the system . an interesting ( and useful ) feature of the evolution eqs .",
    "( [ xyrhobg_eom_a ] ) and ( [ eom_omegagamma ] ) is that they only involve the value of @xmath86 and not its derivatives . as a result",
    ", the rate of change of the phase space vector ( @xmath113 ) at a given instant is the same as its corresponding value in the constant @xmath86 case , with the same value of @xmath86 . in this sense",
    "one may talk about fixed points at a given time , or _",
    "instantaneous fixed points _ that would instantaneously act as attractors ( or repelers ) for the typical trajectories of the system .",
    "one could then imagine that there exist dynamical settings with slow enough changes in @xmath86 such that the trajectories shadow or track a moving instantaneous fixed point ( @xmath47 or @xmath54 in this case ) .",
    "this is essentially the tracking scenario , which can in principle allow the quintessence energy density to follow the energy density of the rest of the universe through most of its history , and also eliminate dependence on initial conditions .",
    "the issue then becomes under what conditions does tracking behavior occur .",
    "it turns out that further conditions are required for the tracking solutions to exist and be stable . in the case of one scalar field with @xmath114",
    ", it has been shown that there exist class of potentials for which tracking takes place provided the corresponding @xmath115 satisfies @xmath116 and is nearly a constant  @xcite .",
    "[ fig1 ]      in this section we extend the above analysis of tracking with a single scalar field and constant @xmath117 to generalized settings with variable @xmath33 s as well as    1 .",
    "multiple tracking fields 2 .",
    "scale - dependent potentials with @xmath118 3 .   non - flrw hubble laws",
    "( expansion rate different from that of a flrw universe )    as our interest is primarily in tracking quintessence models , the emphasis in the following discussion will be on the shadowing of attractor point @xmath47 in table  [ tab_fixpnts_a ] . as in the case of models with a single scalar field , one would expect a stable fixed point to still act as an instantaneous type attractor .",
    "when the @xmath33 s are allowed to change slowly , the usual trajectories shadow these points .",
    "this shadowing amounts to the field being attracted to a surface , defined here by @xmath119 . from the form of the equation of motion for @xmath36 , it is easy to see that @xmath119 is an ` attractor surface ' ( for @xmath120 , which we shall assume ) , which yields a fixed value of @xmath36",
    ". it is interesting to note that this @xmath119 condition is precisely equivalent to eq .",
    "( [ fixpnt_main_omega ] ) , although the latter was derived as a fixed point for a constant @xmath33 case .",
    "we therefore focus on tracking that shadows point @xmath47 and maintains a constant equation of state ( though in principle other forms of tracking may be possible ) and take    @xmath121    which ensures @xmath122 and in turn implies @xmath123 for the system of eqs .",
    "( [ eom_omegagamma ] ) to close we also demand    @xmath124    for a flrw expansion rate , one has@xmath125 which gives @xmath126 which in turn yields an expression for @xmath36 in the form @xmath127 now for @xmath36 to be constant , as is required , either both @xmath65 and @xmath128 must be constants , or alternatively each needs to be arranged in such a way that the ratio appearing in ( [ shdpnt_cond_eos ] ) is constant .",
    "but in general there is no a - priori reason for the latter and we shall therefore not consider this possibility further .",
    "since @xmath65 is the weighted average of all of the @xmath36 , for tracking to occur for any field , we need either @xmath129 ( which does admit the @xmath130 case ) or @xmath131 . for quintessence , the first case can be consistent with the bbn bound of @xmath112  @xcite .",
    "however , if one is considering tracking fields in other scenarios , such as during inflation , @xmath132 can also be acceptable .",
    "we have given a schematic sketch of the tracking scenario in figs .",
    "1 and 2 , corresponding to @xmath133 and @xmath134 respectively . in each case",
    "we have plotted both the instantaneous fixed point and the shadowing point depicted by a solid dot and an open circle respectively .",
    "note that in each case the shadowing point falls on the @xmath135 line , but at a shifted @xmath136 , such that it can remain on the @xmath135 line , as the system ( @xmath137 ) evolves .",
    "figure 2 illustrates the two significant effects of having @xmath134 : the region @xmath138 is excluded and the distance between the @xmath136 s of the instantaneous fixed point and the shadowing point is narrower .    in the case of models with a generalized expansion rate ( with @xmath30 , as for example in models which include brane corrections or changes in the strength of gravity )",
    ", the overall effect is to change the amount of friction the fields feel .",
    "more precisely , as was mentioned above , the form of the eq .",
    "( [ xyrhobg_eom_a ] ) implies that the attractor - type solutions exist as before , but their properties are determined by a new effective logarithmic slope @xmath139 defined by eq .",
    "( [ defn_lambda_eff ] ) .",
    "the @xmath140 field will then _ instantaneously _ behave as if it had this effective logarithmic slope .",
    "however , the evolution of @xmath141 as a function of @xmath10 is not determined by rescaling @xmath142 by eq .",
    "( [ defn_lambda_eff ] ) , since the @xmath33 evolution equation does not transform in this way . as a result , when a correction to the expansion rate is present , the qualitative nature of the attractor can be understood from the value ( or range of applicable values ) of @xmath141 .",
    "the robustness of tracking then depends on the nature of the modified attractor of the field @xmath73 , which is determined by the value of @xmath141 .",
    "of course by the time of nucleosynthesis , @xmath143 , and the attractors will then be unmodified until the present time .    whether a given modification to the expansion rate helps or harms tracking depends on the details of cosmological scenario in question .",
    "for example , a larger expansion rate in the early universe may cause an attractor to be at a smaller value of the field today where the slope of the potential is larger , and the field less able to dominate the energy content of the universe - or it may turn out that at a smaller field value the slope of the potential is less and thus the field is more likely to become dominant . additionally , the transition from the non - flrw attractor to the flrw attractor may be abrupt , if the field can not shadow the attractor during the transition , in which case tracking can be disrupted .",
    "thus , the effect of modifications to the hubble law on the robustness of tracking depends on the details of the cosmological model - but given the necessary details , the effect can be determined by analyzing the attractors resulting from eq .",
    "( [ defn_lambda_eff ] )    [ fig2 ]      in general , the attractor of field @xmath24 is unique and independent of initial conditions .",
    "we will show this by constructing an equation involving @xmath24 and @xmath21 as the only dynamical variables , which does not include the initial conditions of any of the fields @xmath24 .",
    "one can then imagine solving this equation to obtain @xmath144   $ ] , or equivalently , @xmath145   $ ] .",
    "in general one would expect this equation to possess a single , monotonically varying solution - although special cases where this is not the case can undoubtedly be constructed .",
    "the important point is that this solution is independent of the initial conditions of the fields .    to see this ,",
    "the first step is to find @xmath65 as a function of the field values @xmath24 . using its definition and eqs .",
    "( [ tracking_equ_omegaphi ] ) and ( [ tracking_equ_gammaphi ] ) for each field , one can find a quadratic equation for @xmath65 as a function of @xmath146 , @xmath147 , @xmath148 with @xmath149 , in the form @xmath150 where @xmath151 as this is a quadratic equation for @xmath152   $ ] , there may exist @xmath153 , @xmath154 , or @xmath63 solutions for @xmath65 .",
    "the existence and stability of such solutions will be dealt with in the next section .",
    "the key point here is that solutions are manifestly independent of initial conditions . combining eqs .",
    "( [ tracking_equ_omegaphi ] ) and ( [ tracking_equ_gammaphi ] ) yields @xmath155 = \\frac{1}{1+\\frac{\\rho _ { bg}}{\\rho _ { \\phi i}}}.\\ ] ] one can also write an expression for @xmath156\\ ] ] thus one arrives at the following equation @xmath157 = \\frac{1}{1+\\frac{\\rho _ { bg}}{\\rho _ { \\phi i}\\left [ \\phi _ { k}\\right ] } } \\ ] ] this will generally be a very difficult expression to solve .",
    "however , it simplifies greatly when @xmath158 , because the fields are only coupled to each other through the effects each has on the hubble expansion rate , and for @xmath158 they effectively decouple , reducing the complexity of the system . in principal , the solution (",
    "if it exists , is physical , and is stable - issues we shall treat below ) yields @xmath159 , \\ ; \\ ; i=1,n $ ] , which are independent of initial conditions .",
    "thus if the solution exists ( i.e. is self - consistent ) and is stable , then it is independent of the initial conditions .",
    "the above argument depends on all of the fields being tracking fields - that is , eqs .",
    "( [ tracking_equ_omegaphi ] ) and  ( [ tracking_equ_gammaphi ] ) being consistent with @xmath119 and thus @xmath122 .",
    "of course , not all the fields in a multi - field model need necessarily possess a potential that is compatible with tracking , in which case those fields would then not track .",
    "in such a case the argument given above for the independence from initial conditions is no longer valid .",
    "it is then impossible to make a general prediction about the existence or initial condition - independence of attractors for the tracking fields .",
    "however , as the fields affect one another through altering the background expansion rate ( or altering the value and rate of change of @xmath65 ) , one expects that if the @xmath35 of the non - tracking fields stay small , or if they do not cause @xmath65 to vary rapidly , they will not affect the attractor solution of the tracking fields , and leave intact the above result concerning independence from initial conditions , for the tracking fields .",
    "we have shown above that the existence of _ instantaneous _ fixed points for the evolution equations ( [ eom_omegagamma ] ) is mathematically consistent . however , for these points to give rise to tracking behavior they must also be attractors , that is , the shadowing point , determined by eqs .",
    "( [ shdpnt_cond_r ] ) and ( [ shdpnt_cond_eos ] ) must be stable to perturbations . to find conditions for this ,",
    "we shall obtain perturbation equations by perturbing the full evolution equations around the position of the shadowing point . from the nature of the eigenmodes of the perturbation equations the stability properties of the shadowing point",
    "can then be deduced .",
    "however , for models with @xmath2 fields , the problem of determining the perturbation eigenmodes becomes one of finding the eigenvalues for a @xmath160 matrix , or solving a polynomial of order @xmath161 .",
    "fortunately , an exact solution is not necessary in order to address several important issues .",
    "these include the stability in the nearly decoupled limit ( @xmath158 ) and the determination of when the shadowing point will become unstable .",
    "since the fields @xmath3 only affect each other through the expansion rate , one would expect that for small @xmath158 the system will behave as @xmath2 decoupled systems , which turns out to be the case .",
    "the stability conditions for the decoupled fields correspond to the generalization of those found in  @xcite , with the added explicit scale dependence of the potential or corrections to the hubble law taken into account .",
    "for the coupled case the results are also fairly intuitive : from the the shadowing conditions , one can see that @xmath36 should be nearly constant , and equal to a nearly constant multiple of the overall average equation of state @xmath65 .",
    "thus we have a key stability condition , namely that @xmath65 must be nearly constant .",
    "now when @xmath71 dominates this condition is satisfied .",
    "however , if @xmath162 become of order unity for any field @xmath163 , even if each @xmath36 is constant , the proportion of the total energy density in the field increases rapidly , resulting in a rapid decease in @xmath65 .",
    "similarly , as @xmath164 approaches unity , the condition @xmath165 ( and thus @xmath166 ) can no longer be maintained .",
    "as one would expect , this manifests itself as a growing mode of the perturbations , which amounts to an instability .",
    "this disrupts tracking as @xmath167 .",
    "the important question is whether perturbations have growing modes if @xmath168 ? in the next section we find that the answer to this question is negative , so long as @xmath65 and @xmath169 remain nearly constant .      assume for the moment that all fields are trackers - that is expressions ( [ shdpnt_cond_r ] ) and ( [ shdpnt_cond_eos ] ) hold for each field individually . now to study the perturbations ,",

    "furthermore , the rate of change of @xmath65 enters into the perturbation equation , which is given by @xmath174 + \\frac{d\\gamma _ { bg}}{dn}.\\ ] ] note that we are not presently taking @xmath66 to be a constant - the reason for which will become clear when we consider the effect on stability by non - tracking fields by absorbing them into a redefinition of the background .",
    "the condition for the closing of the unperturbed system of equations is that the terms in the stability equation above that are not proportional to @xmath175 or @xmath176 must vanish .",
    "thus the following terms : @xmath177 must be negligible compared to @xmath175 or @xmath176 . for the @xmath140 field @xmath3 to have a stable @xmath119 tracking attractor , one requires that @xmath178 for all @xmath80 as well as @xmath179 and @xmath180 .",
    "that is , if the @xmath181 and @xmath182 equations without these terms are stable ( have only decaying modes , with negative real parts of eigenvalues ) then the @xmath181 and @xmath182 will decay until they are of the order of these residual quantities . alternatively , one can say that the @xmath119 shadowing point is shifted by a small amount of the order these terms .",
    "thus we proceed by assuming the terms that are not proportional to @xmath175 or @xmath176 are much smaller than @xmath175 and @xmath176 , and analyze the resulting stability equation with these terms removed .",
    "this results in the following equations for @xmath183 and @xmath184 @xmath185 with @xmath186 and @xmath187    in general , finding the eigenmodes of the above perturbation equations is equivalent to diagonalizing a @xmath160 matrix , or finding the roots of a polynomial of order @xmath161 given by @xmath188 finding explicit expressions for the eigenmodes in terms of the coefficients ( [ stab_perteq_coeff ] ) is neither feasible nor useful . even for the simple 2-field case , one is faced with extremely messy expressions for the roots of a quartic equation .",
    "one , however , does not need to solve for all the @xmath189s explicitly .",
    "it is sufficient to impose the condition that the real parts of all _ relevant _ @xmath189s be negative .",
    "a mode is only relevant if its growth leads to the failure of tracking of the whole system .",
    "one would expect that some fields may not track , and at the same time not interfere with the tracking of other fields if they effectively decouple , having @xmath158 . in that case , these are irrelevant , or harmless instability modes . as a result , @xmath190 > 0 $ ] may not necessarily signal an instability in the entire tracking system , as the fields only interact by altering the value of @xmath65 , and with @xmath158 the failure of @xmath3 to track would not effect tracking by the other fields .",
    "a possible way of studying the stability of the tracking is to recast the perturbation equations ( [ pert_evol_eq1 ] ) into a system of equations analogous to @xmath2 coupled , damped harmonic oscillators ( @xmath182 ) in the form @xmath191 if one identifies @xmath10 with time , then the oscillator energy is a good measure of the deviation of the tracking fields from their shadowing condition ( background ) values .",
    "thus there are @xmath2 oscillators @xmath182 , each of which can be excited in @xmath161 possible modes .",
    "note that due to its form , equation ( [ perteom_oscmain ] ) is _ not _ in general derivable from a conservative lagrangian . in particular , note that the coefficients of the terms in @xmath49 proportional to @xmath176 do not in general form a symmetric matrix ( and those proportional to @xmath175 an antisymmetric matrix ) , as would be necessary for @xmath49 to be derivable from an interaction potential of the form @xmath192 } \\delta _ { j}\\dot{\\delta } _ { k}\\ ] ]",
    "thus the equations of motion do not conserve energy - that is , the perturbation amplitudes may decay or grow .",
    "however , by examining the implications of equation ( [ perteom_oscmain ] ) , one can determine what will happen - and thereby determine the stability of the system .    to do this",
    ", we shall employ the ansatz @xmath193 and then solve mode - by - mode to obtain @xmath194 = f_{l}\\equiv \\sum _ { j}\\frac{a_{jl}}{\\left ( -c_{j}\\right ) } \\left [ d_{j}c_{j}+b_{j}\\beta _ { l}\\right].\\ ] ] because the right - hand side is independent of @xmath195 , we can immediately determine the relative amplitudes for mode  @xmath196 of oscillators  @xmath195 and  @xmath197 : @xmath198 = f_{l}=\\frac{a_{kl}}{\\left ( -c_{k}\\right ) } \\left [ \\beta ^{2}_{l}-a_{k}\\beta _ { l}-\\frac{3}{2}c_{k}\\right ] \\ ; \\ ; \\ ; \\ ; \\ ; \\ ; i\\neq k\\ ] ]    we begin by examining the decoupled system ( @xmath199 ) .",
    "for the case of models with @xmath2 scalar fields , there are @xmath161 eigenvalues @xmath200 , given by @xmath201 from eq .",
    "( [ perteom_oscrelamp ] ) it is clear that for the @xmath182 oscillator only the modes with frequencies @xmath202 are present .",
    "the zeroth order stability condition is the requirement that @xmath203 < 0 $ ] . using ( [ eigenval_0_defn ] ) , this can be seen to be satisfied if and only if both @xmath204 and @xmath205 .",
    "solving these inequalities yields the following requirements for stability of uncoupled tracking @xmath206 of course , for the zeroth order stability conditions to be relevant , we need @xmath179 and @xmath207 .",
    "note that for @xmath13 , the stability condition becomes @xmath208 or @xmath209 , which for @xmath210 agrees with that previously obtained in  @xcite for the case of a single tracking field .",
    "this is not surprising , as in the decoupled limit of @xmath207 each field can be treated individually .",
    "this lower limit on @xmath211 varies between @xmath154 and @xmath212 , where @xmath100 is allowed unless @xmath213 and @xmath214 corresponds to a diminishing tracking field ( @xmath215 ) . for @xmath3 to be a `` useful quintessence '' field , that is to have @xmath216 ( @xmath217 ) , the condition ( [ stab_cond_decoupled ] ) is automatically satisfied . for @xmath11 and",
    "@xmath217 tracking is still stable , and the lower limit on @xmath211 becomes smaller , taking a value closer to @xmath212 .",
    "one can understand this intuitively as follows : @xmath11 is another channel for the decay of ( potential ) energy in the field .",
    "thus as less energy goes into kinetic energy , @xmath33 changes less rapidly , and the system is more able to maintain the @xmath119 condition .",
    "we now consider the effect of the coupling between the modes given by @xmath218 in eq .",
    "( [ perteom_oscmode ] ) .",
    "the coupling causes the mixing of the modes , but diagonalizing the coupled system , as we have seen , is not practical .",
    "this is not necessary , however , as by examining the un - diagonalized system we can draw the important conclusion that the shadowing condition is stable until @xmath219 . from eq .",
    "( [ perteom_oscrelamp ] ) it is clear that for each oscillator @xmath182 , the modes with frequencies @xmath220 are dominant for @xmath221 , but there are now also @xmath222 other modes present , with the frequencies of the other oscillators .",
    "the amplitudes of these other modes are suppressed by a factor of order @xmath223 ( unless @xmath224 , in which case @xmath225 ) .",
    "one can see from eq .",
    "( [ perteom_oscmode ] ) that the diagonal mode @xmath226 can be treated as an oscillator , but with a shifted @xmath227 .",
    "we identify the zeroth order mode s @xmath227 with the @xmath228 term in eq .",
    "( [ perteom_oscmode ] ) .",
    "the effect of the interactions is then to provide a @xmath227 shift of @xmath229 the condition for stability then becomes the requirement that the shifted mass not cause the mode to become growing , which implies @xmath230 < 0 $ ] . if @xmath231 was real , then this would be the condition that the shifted @xmath227 must be positive @xmath232 however , in general @xmath231 is complex since @xmath233 are complex .",
    "the stability condition then becomes @xmath234 -\\frac{1}{2}im\\left [ m^{2}_{tot_{ii}}\\right]^{2}>0.\\ ] ] this consideration does not significantly alter the story - that there is a stability radius of order unity around @xmath235 in the complex plane .",
    "thus in this way one can see that the system is guaranteed to be stable for any parameter values that ensure the inequality @xmath236 to be roughly satisfied .",
    "thus far we have been considering the diagonal elements of a mass matrix .",
    "we now consider the off - diagonal elements which correspond to the off - diagonal modes , whose amplitudes are controlled by eq .",
    "( [ perteom_oscrelamp ] ) . until @xmath237 ,",
    "these off - diagonal mode amplitudes can not become of the same order of the diagonal mode amplitudes , and therefore eq .",
    "( [ pert_shiftedmass2_cond_cplx ] ) remains satisfied .",
    "we have seen that for @xmath238 the diagonal mode amplitudes do not grow , and the off - diagonal mode amplitudes are suppressed relative to these by a factor of order @xmath223 .",
    "the implication is that the shadowing conditions ( [ shdpnt_cond_r ] ) and ( [ shdpnt_cond_eos ] ) will be stable so long as @xmath239 .",
    "the question remains as to what happens if some fields in the model are not trackers , and therefore do not satisfy the conditions ( [ shdpnt_cond_r ] ) and ( [ shdpnt_cond_eos ] ) ?",
    "these fields must then be excluded from the set of perturbations @xmath240 and therefore do not contribute to @xmath241 . because they do not obey the tracking conditions , little",
    "can be said about such fields in general .",
    "they do , however , contribute to @xmath66 .",
    "if their @xmath242 is large enough such that they can cause an appreciable variation of @xmath65 , they will cause a deviation from the shadowing conditions as noted above for the residual terms ( [ stab_nonclosure_terms ] ) .",
    "we have shown that tracking with the @xmath119 condition is possible for nearly constant @xmath65 .",
    "the constancy of @xmath65 is the key to closing the zeroth order tracking equations , and therefore it is not surprising that a constant @xmath65 is the key to the stability of the shadowing points , and that many of the stability conditions can ultimately be traced back to it .",
    "we note that even though in principle other forms of tracking may be possible under other conditions , the type of tracking considered here is that which has been commonly considered in the literature .    note the near constancy of @xmath65 in turn requires nearly constant @xmath128 together with @xmath243 and @xmath244 .",
    "we have seen that the perturbations @xmath181 and @xmath182 will decay until they are of order @xmath245 , @xmath246 or @xmath247 ; resulting in the @xmath119 shadowing point to be shifted by small amount of the order of these terms .",
    "the system is more stable in the small @xmath35 limit , since as @xmath246 or @xmath164 approach unity , this in general causes @xmath65 to vary rapidly , thus making the @xmath119 condition to fail and the tracking to cease .",
    "the weakly coupled case is analogous to @xmath2 individual tracking fields , and thus it is not surprising that the constraints in the limit of @xmath248 reproduce those given in  @xcite , for the single field case .",
    "furthermore , in this limit @xmath210 , and the stability of the shadowing condition for the field @xmath3 , given by ( [ shdpnt_cond_r ] ) and ( [ shdpnt_cond_eos ] ) require @xmath249 if the stability conditions are not met for the field @xmath73 , then clearly it will not track .",
    "however , the instability is irrelevant if @xmath214 .",
    "this is because for @xmath214 , the @xmath35 decreases with expansion ( as @xmath250 ) and the field @xmath73 will effectively become irrelevant as @xmath103 .",
    "thus in this case the tracking of the other fields will not be effected by the failure of the field @xmath73 to track . on the other hand ,",
    "if @xmath217 , or if @xmath100 and @xmath35 is of order 1 , then the instability in the field @xmath73 will ultimately ruin tracking for all fields , as it will cause @xmath65 to vary rapidly , and @xmath119 can no longer be maintained in general for any of the other fields .",
    "finally , we have seen that the presence of non - tracking fields will harm tracking if and only if they cause @xmath65 to vary rapidly .",
    "we note that our stability analysis was limited to the violation of the shadowing conditions given by ( [ shdpnt_cond_r ] ) and ( [ shdpnt_cond_eos ] ) .",
    "a concern that we have not addressed is the possibility that the homogeneous distribution of the scalar field may be unstable to formation of spatial inhomogeneities - the so called q - balls  @xcite .",
    "this is an important issue that we hope to return to in future work .",
    "we have argued that for tracking quintessence to truly solve the fine - tuning problem , the tracking phenomena must be robust in the more complicated and complete cosmological scenarios that derive from high energy physics .",
    "such scenarios typically include multiple scalar fields ( some of which may not have potentials suitable for tracking ) , a hubble law at high energies different from that of the flrw model , and scalar field potentials that depend explicitly on the scale factor .",
    "tracking would be of limited use as a solution to the fine - tuning problem if it were easily ruined by such effects .    in models with @xmath251 scalar fields",
    ", we have found that @xmath119 tracking requires a nearly constant @xmath65 . if any one of the tracking fields develops a large enough @xmath162 , or if @xmath167 then in general @xmath65 will vary rapidly , causing the tracking to fail for all fields . also ,",
    "if any of the non - tracking fields become a significant portion of the total energy density then they can potentially cause @xmath65 to vary rapidly . in general",
    ", therefore , @xmath119 tracking requires @xmath128 to be nearly constant for the field @xmath73 to track , as well as @xmath252 for all fields , and for @xmath164 not to approach @xmath154 .    in models with a modified expansion rate ( such as those including the brane corrections or changes in the strength of gravity ) , we have found the attractor - type solutions can still exist , but their instantaneous nature is determined by the effective logarithmic slope @xmath141 .",
    "when such a correction is present , the qualitative nature of the attractor can be understood from the value of @xmath141 .",
    "however , the answer to the question of whether a given modification to the expansion rate helps or harms the robustness of tracking depends on the details of cosmological scenario in question - but given the necessary details , the effect can be determined by analyzing the attractors resulting from eq .",
    "( [ defn_lambda_eff ] ) .    in models with temperature dependent potentials ( @xmath11 )",
    ", we have found that this dependence can make tracking more robust .",
    "roughly speaking , @xmath11 throttles quintessence - slowing the rate of increase of @xmath35 , thus making fields with larger @xmath128 less harmful to both tracking stability , and to cosmological scenarios . on the other hand , very large values of @xmath45",
    "spoil tracking for field @xmath3 .",
    "if @xmath217 , a value of @xmath253 keeps ( @xmath254 ) small , and slows the increase of @xmath35 , making tracking of the entire system more stable . for @xmath255 the field @xmath3 will fail to track , though it becomes an irrelevant field and tracking of the other fields is not harmed .    in conclusion",
    ", we have found that the conditions for robustness of tracking becomes more complex in the more general settings that derive from high energy physics .",
    "tracking can become more fragile with respect to some such added complexities to the model , as there are more constraints to be satisfied .",
    "this can for example be seen from the above analysis of stability in presence of multiple scalar fields .",
    "other additions , such as temperature dependent potentials , on the other hand may make tracking more robust .",
    "interestingly though , most of the cases where tracking is disrupted are those in which the cosmological model is itself non - viable due to other constraints . for example , although tracking is less robust for larger @xmath164 , this would generally make the model non - viable due to constraints such as nucleosynthesis and structure formation .",
    "thus tracking seems to fair well in these general settings , once we confine ourselves to viable cosmological models .",
