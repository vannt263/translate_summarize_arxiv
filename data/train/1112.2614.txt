    "generally speaking , quantum walks ( qw ) represent unitary evolutions taking place in discrete spaces  graphs  for which typical basis states are localized .",
    "there are several ways to formulate qw , either considering time as a continuous ( ctqw ) @xcite or a discrete variable . in the latter case ,",
    "the two major formulations are the ( a ) coined qw ( cqw ) , based on inner `` coin '' states ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , and ( b ) scattering qw ( sqw ) , relying on the idea of multi - port interferometers @xcite . the continuous time and coined qw",
    "are directly related as a limit process @xcite , whereas the cqw and sqw have been shown to be unitarily equivalent in arbitrary topologies @xcite .",
    "quantum walks originally emerged @xcite from the interest to construct and understand quantum analogs of classical random walks ( cw ) .",
    "but soon it was realized they also would constitute powerful tools in quantum computation @xcite , specially given that qw can represent universal quantum computation primitives @xcite . in fact , for a long time cw have been used to solve different computational problems @xcite . thus , the connections between the quantum and classical walks @xcite , allied to the particular features of the former @xcite , actually point to the potential usefulness of qw in building algorithms which are much faster and robuster @xcite than their classical counterparts . as representative examples we can cite the grover algorithm @xcite ( simulated through qw @xcite ) for searching of unsorted database , the element distinctness algorithm @xcite , the detection of marked elements @xcite , the computation of orders of solvable groups @xcite , and the quantum fourier transform @xcite . moreover , even problems like the energy transport in biological systems can be analyzed by means of qw @xcite .",
    "a key aspect in such class of systems is the quantum interference between the possible `` paths '' ( see next section ) along the evolution @xcite .",
    "it leads to a dynamics that generally spreads much faster than cw @xcite ( although in certain situations anomalous sub - diffusive behavior may also emerge @xcite ) . as a consequence ,",
    "one gets exponentially faster hitting times from qw @xcite , one of the reasons why qw are particularly suitable @xcite to solve searching problems @xcite .",
    "also , different diffusion processes , from ballistic to anderson localization @xcite , are possible when decoherence is included .    since interference is fundamental to explain different phenomena observed in qw @xcite ( including many of the applications mentioned above ) it is desirable to have a description emphasizing the path - like character of qw . in this respect",
    "green function methods are particularly useful @xcite .",
    "then , here we develop a full green function approach for qw in arbitrary topology and for position dependent quantum amplitudes .",
    "for so , we assume the very appropriate discrete scattering formulation , sqw .",
    "we should observe there are few interesting works ( e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite ) addressing the classification of trajectories in qw .",
    "they , nevertheless , are based mostly on combinatorial analysis to compute all the possible final states at a time @xmath0 .",
    "our proposed construction thus is much closer to the idea of `` history '' of trajectories in the feynman sense @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as the following . in sec .",
    "ii we review the scattering formulation for quantum walks , also making few useful parallels with the classical case . by direct mapping one - dimensional qw to a related type of problem , 1d point interaction lattices , in sec .",
    "iii we are able to write the exact green function @xmath1 in the form of a sum over paths . moreover , we discuss how such formula can be summed as a closed analytical expression . in sec .",
    "iv the 1d construction is extended to complete arbitrary topologies . by defining the step and path operators ,",
    "we show in sec . v how to extract any system relevant information from the exact expression for @xmath1 . in sec .",
    "vi we illustrate the features of the present approach analyzing in details a particular example , the diamond - shaped graph .",
    "finally , we present the conclusion in sec .",
    "to better understand the main ideas underlying the definition of quantum walk models , and thus to develop a green function approach , here we review qw scattering formulation @xcite on the line ( 1d ) .",
    "the case of more general topologies will be discussed in the next sections .",
    "so , consider a helpful framework for sqw : to view their evolution as a dynamics defined on a 1d `` hilbert lattice '' , depicted in fig .",
    "1 . notice , however , it does not necessarily represent a spatial structure since the states ( assumed on the bonds ) do not need to be position eigenvectors . under this picture , the lattice characteristic parameter is @xmath2 , just the spacing between two consecutive sites of the hilbert lattice . along each bond , joining the sites @xmath3 and @xmath4 ( fig .",
    "1 ) , we have two possible states , @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "then , each basis element , @xmath7 , is labeled by two quantum numbers .",

    "( [ condition - coef ] ) holds , there is a freedom to choose the coefficients @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",

    "( [ translation - reflection])([evolution - qrw ] ) in fact represents an extended quantum version of a more simple classical random walk .",

    "( [ eigenvalues ] ) @xmath33 and the phases to depend on @xmath3 , we are implicitly assuming position dependent distribution functions for the direction choices . obviously , by setting a same @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 for any @xmath3 we recover the usual case .",

    "suppose an undirected simple network @xcite of sites connected by bonds ( examples in fig . 5 ) .",
    "its topology represents the particular hilbert space arrangement in which the quantum walk dynamics takes place .",
    "like the 1d lattice , each bond joining two neighbor sites ",
    "say @xmath3 and @xmath161  is associated only two basis states , one incoming to @xmath3 and other to @xmath161 .",
    "for instance , for the bond joining @xmath162 to @xmath163 in fig . 5 ( a ) , we have @xmath164 and @xmath165 , whereas for the bond connecting @xmath3 to @xmath161 ( @xmath3 to @xmath166 ) in fig . 5 ( b ) , we have @xmath167 and @xmath168 ( @xmath169 and @xmath170 ) .",
    "but contrary to the 1d case , the possible `` directions '' ( bonds ) to get to a site @xmath3 from its first neighbors may depend on the specific @xmath3 .",
    "thus , the quantum number @xmath171 assumes the values @xmath172 , with @xmath173 the coordination number ( valence ) of site @xmath3 . in more regular structures @xmath174 regardless of @xmath3 ( e.g. ,",
    "@xmath175 in fig . 5 ( a ) ) .",
    "the construction of the time evolution operators is discussed , e.g. , in refs .",
    "here we just outline the main ideas following ref .",
    "first , one needs to characterize the lattice topology , namely , to specify for any @xmath3 the sets : ( a ) @xmath176 of all the @xmath173 sites which are first neighbors of @xmath3 ( e.g. , in fig .",
    "5 ( b ) , @xmath177 ) ; ( b ) @xmath178 for @xmath179 the direction quantum number for the state incoming to site @xmath180 through the bond joining @xmath180 and @xmath3 ( in fig . 5 ( b ) , @xmath181 ; and ( c ) @xmath182 with @xmath183 the direction quantum number for the state @xmath184 incoming to @xmath3 along the bond connecting @xmath3 and @xmath180 ( in fig . 5 ( b ) , @xmath185 ) .",
    "second , one defines the one step time evolution @xmath10 in terms of its action over each basis state @xmath186 , or ( with @xmath187 and @xmath188 the corresponding element in @xmath189 ) @xmath190 \\big ( r_{\\sigma_j \\sigma_{j } , j } |\\sigma_{j^{(i ) } } , j^{(i ) } \\rangle   \\nonumber \\\\ & & +   \\sum_{n=1 ; n \\neq i}^{n = k_j } t_{\\sigma_j \\tilde{\\sigma}_{j^{(n ) } } , j }     \\label{u - topology}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] finally , the @xmath57 s and @xmath58 s are chosen such that for any @xmath3 the @xmath191 matrix @xmath192 ( of elements @xmath193_{\\sigma \\ , \\sigma } = r_{\\sigma \\sigma , j}$ ] and @xmath193_{\\sigma ' \\ , \\sigma } = t_{\\sigma ' \\sigma , j}$ ] , for both @xmath194 in @xmath195 ) is unitary .",
    "this makes @xmath10 also unitary @xcite , establishing sqw in arbitrary topologies .",
    "the usual , i.e. , continuous in time and space , quantum mechanical dynamics on network structures ( known as quantum graph systems @xcite ) is likewise a generalization of the evolution in a 1d lattice with zero range potentials @xcite .",
    "it is obtained by properly matching the solutions of a 1d free @xcite schrdinger equation in the different arms ( bonds ) at the vertices ( sites ) . for this end",
    ", one assumes for each @xmath3 a matrix @xmath196 ( see below ) , which describes how an incoming plane wave of wave number @xmath56 is scattered off at the vertex @xmath3 .",
    "so , any @xmath3 can be viewed as a general point interaction , but connecting @xmath173-directions instead of the common two ( left and right ) on the line .",
    "furthermore , if for all @xmath3 , @xmath197 , the resulting dynamics is unitary , conserving flux probability .",
    "quantum graphs can be solved through a green function approach @xcite .",
    "in fact , it has been shown @xcite that the exact @xmath1 is also given by eq .",
    "( [ green ] ) , where now the scattering paths are all the possible trajectories along the network , starting and ending at the points @xmath136 and @xmath137 ( located in arbitrary arms of the graph ) .",
    "the @xmath198 s are the quantum amplitudes gained along the s.p.s due to the scattering at the different sites .",
    "finally , the mentioned procedure of classifying and summing up different classes of s.p.s still holds in this case @xcite .",
    "so , we always can write the exact @xmath1 as a closed analytical expression .    summarizing , qw in general networks are direct extensions of qw in 1d exactly in the same way than quantum graphs are natural extensions of kronig - peney lattices . therefore , it is easy to realize that our previous mapping between the two types of systems in 1d remains valid in arbitrary topologies too .",
    "lastly , to define the reflection and transmission scattering amplitudes in a quantum graph  and to associate them to qw coefficients  we consider the same labeling used to characterize the lattices topologies . thus , for @xmath199 , the matrix elements of @xmath200 are @xmath201_{i \\ ,",

    "the unitarity of the @xmath200 s plus the symmetries of the schrdinger equation for real potentials @xcite ( i.e. , @xmath206 ) , yield ( where @xmath207 ) @xmath208 the above are natural generalizations @xcite of the usual relations for the scattering coefficients ( c.f . , eqs .",
    "( [ condition - coef ] ) and ( [ rr - tt ] ) ) of a point scatterer on the line .",
    "note also that if we impose time - reversal invariance , @xmath209 .",
    "hence , the direction coefficients in a quantum walk , the @xmath192 s , are in one - to - one correspondence with the scattering matrices @xmath200 s in a quantum graph system .",
    "from the previous results , it turns out that the exact green function , eq . ( [ green ] ) , is actually the _ generating function _ of all the possible walks leaving from and arriving at the bonds corresponding to @xmath136 and @xmath137 , respectively .",
    "so , any individual or group of qw paths are obtained through proper manipulations of @xmath1 .    in this way ,",
    "more simple tasks like to determine all the trajectories for @xmath210 evolving , say , only two times steps ( @xmath211 ) , can be done by identifying particular terms directly in the @xmath1 series representation , eq .",
    "( [ green ] ) .",
    "however , the huge proliferation of paths in instances such as to find certain trajectories connecting two bonds very far apart , or resulting from high values of @xmath37 , makes the full series expansion difficult to deal with . in such cases ,",
    "a better approach is first to sum up the series @xcite ( using the already mentioned procedures in the literature @xcite to get expressions like eq . ( [ green - example ] ) ) and then to extract the sought information from @xmath1 with the help of the two operators described below .",
    "the first is @xmath212 , yielding all the paths of exactly @xmath37 time steps . to define @xmath212 ,",
    "note that any walk state gains a factor @xmath22 $ ] at each time step ( see eq .",
    "( [ u - topology ] ) ) . from the mapping ,",
    "such factor is equivalent to @xmath213 $ ] in the ( continuous ) quantum graph problem .",
    "so , let us set @xmath214 as @xmath1 in eq .",
    "( [ green ] ) , but with the substitution @xmath215 \\rightarrow z$ ] , and for which the scattering amplitudes are identified with the appropriate quantum walk coefficients @xmath192 s ( section iv ) .",
    "thus , one finds that if the step operator @xmath212 acting on @xmath214 has the form @xmath216 then @xmath217 gives the total probability for the quantum walk to leave the bond @xmath136 and to get to the bond @xmath137 in exactly @xmath37 steps .",
    "we should mention that such construction has already been proposed in @xcite to treat scattering problems . considering the green function approach",
    ", we see that @xmath212 can be applied in more general contexts .",
    "the second is @xmath218 , which extracts from @xmath1 all the paths with specific trajectory stretches @xmath219 .",
    "any quantum walk s.p . can be described by the sequence of coefficients @xmath57 and @xmath58 it gains along the way ( cf . , eq .",
    "( [ example-3steps ] ) ) .",
    "for instance , consider fig . 5 ( b ) and assume @xmath220 applications of @xmath10 to the system initially at @xmath221 .",
    "one possible sequence of successively visited states during the evolution , thus representing a possible path , is : @xmath222 here @xmath223 is its probability amplitude , which can be rewrite as @xmath224 .",
    "thus , any trajectory ( or part of it ) can be represented by @xmath225 , i.e. , by the set of indexes and exponents associated to the quantum coefficients @xmath57 and @xmath58 of the path stretch ( with @xmath226 and @xmath227 standing for @xmath228 ) . in our example , @xmath229 ; @xmath230 ; @xmath231 ; @xmath232 ; @xmath233 ; @xmath234 ; @xmath235 .",
    "now , by properly choosing @xmath136 and @xmath137 ( which obviously depends on @xmath219 , see sec .",
    "vi ) we get that @xmath236 is a sum  in the form of eq .",
    "( [ green ] )  but containing only paths whose parts of their trajectories are given by @xmath237 .",
    "the explicit expression for @xmath218 is @xmath238 which must act on the green function as the following : first one performs all the indicated derivatives ; second , one sets the coefficients @xmath239 and @xmath240 equal to zero ; finally one multiplies the resulting expression by the coefficients @xmath241 s and @xmath242 s .",
    "if we shall select just a path which is itself entirely represented by @xmath237 , then in the above definition we simply change @xmath243 and @xmath244 by @xmath245 and @xmath246 , with @xmath57 and @xmath58 _ all _ the quantum amplitudes in @xmath1 .",
    "lastly , we note that for an initial state being the superposition of @xmath129 basis states , @xmath247 , we must consider @xmath129 green functions , each with a @xmath136 corresponding to the bond of @xmath248 .",
    "so , in any calculation , the contribution of each of these @xmath1 s should be weighted by the associated factor @xmath249 .",
