    "shearing of a duplex involves applying antiparallel forces to either the opposite @xmath1-@xmath1 or @xmath2-@xmath2 ends of the bound duplex , as shown in fig.[fig : modes](a ) .",
    "such a setup has been explored experimentally @xcite and theoretically @xcite . in early experiments @xcite ,",
    "loads were increased dynamically ; more recently , hatch _",
    "et al._were able to use a constant force @xcite .",
    "the critical force @xmath3 above which the duplex ruptures is a key observable ; hatch _",
    "et al._measured the shearing force for duplexes from length 12 to 50 bp ( base pairs ) , and found that it increased with duplex length at short lengths before plateauing in the long length limit @xcite ( fig.[fig : toymodel](a ) ) .",
    "clearly , for any non - zero force , the stable state involves widely separated strands . at finite temperature ,",
    "therefore , any duplex will rupture given sufficient time .",
    "thus , the critical force should be understood as the force required to rupture a duplex within a given experimental time scale , and it is fundamentally important to view rupture under shearing in the context of time scales of experimental observation . for systems in which load",
    "is dynamically applied , the time scale over which the force changes is an additional complicating factor .",
    "we will restrict our discussion to the constant force case .        at room temperature , opening of a duplex",
    "is widely believed to be a thermally activated process @xcite .",
    "the system must pass through an unfavorable transition state in which the strands are attached by a small number of base pairs ; one would expect the rate to be exponentially suppressed by the free energy cost @xmath4 of reaching this state from the fully formed duplex . assuming a typical free - energy cost of base - pair disruption of @xmath5 @xcite , @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the duplex length and @xmath8 is an @xmath7-independent constant that incorporates , for example , the typical number of base pairs in a transition state .",
    "to a first approximation , the effect of a constant shearing force @xmath9 is to modulate @xmath4 as the transition state and duplex state have different extensibilities .",
    "@xmath10 in which @xmath11 is the average extension of the fully - formed duplex under force @xmath9 , and @xmath12 is the extension of the transition state .",
    "evaluating the integral in eq.[eq : dgdagger ] necessitates a detailed model of dna , but physical insight can be obtained through the crude approximation of @xmath13 , in which @xmath14 is a positive constant representing the degree per base pair to which the disrupted duplex will tend to have a larger extension due to its single - stranded state .",
    "@xmath15 , like @xmath8 , accounts for the number of base pairs in the transition state .",
    "given the above description , a simple model for the rate @xmath16 of duplex rupture as a function of duplex length and force would be @xmath17 in which @xmath18 is an unknown rate constant .",
    "thus for rupture to occur on a time scale of experimental observation @xmath19 , we require @xmath20 .",
    "this expression defines a critical force below which duplexes will not tend to rupture during the experiment , and above which rupture is typical : @xmath21 at large @xmath7 , @xmath22 and is @xmath7-independent .",
    "as @xmath7 drops , the importance of the second term on the right - hand side grows and @xmath23 therefore decreases , reaching zero when @xmath24 .",
    "thus our simple model predicts that duplexes below a certain length will dissociate spontaneously on an experimental time scale ; above this length the critical force required for rupture will rise from 0 and eventually plateau in the long length limit .",
    "although the toy model is crude , the underlying physics is reasonable : the shearing stress acts to reduce the stability per base pair of the duplex state , allowing duplexes to rupture within a smaller observation time @xmath19 than at zero force .",
    "long duplexes require a higher force than short ones , since if more base pairs are present then each individual base pair must be weakened further to result in the same barrier height @xmath25 . at high enough forces",
    "@xmath26 , breaking a base pair is thermodynamically favorable and so even long duplexes will rupture rapidly , explaining the plateau in @xmath3 at large @xmath7 .",
    "the behavior of eq.[eq : toy_prediction ] is illustrated in fig.[fig : toymodel](a ) , in which the toy model is fitted to the experimental data of hatch _ et al._@xcite .",
    "for simplicity , we assume that the transition state is a single base - pair state ; we thus set @xmath27 and @xmath28 and fit @xmath29 and @xmath30 to the data .",
    "the observed behavior is clearly consistent with experiment .",
    "further , the fitting parameters are reasonable given the crudeness of the model . if @xmath31 nm , @xmath32 , similar to values reported by ref .",
    "@xcite , and the barrier height @xmath33 , implying that duplexes of @xmath34-@xmath35bp can dissociate within the observation time ( 1s ) , which is not unreasonable @xcite .",
    "importantly , as shown in fig.[fig : toymodel](b ) , the shape of @xmath23 depends on @xmath36 . from eq.[eq : toy_prediction ] , @xmath3 depends linearly on @xmath36 and hence ( through eq.[eq : arrhenius ] ) it decreases logarithmically with increasing @xmath19 .",
    "this dependence is physically reasonable ; for example , the maximal length of duplex that will spontaneously dissociate ( rupture at @xmath37 ) in a time scale of milliseconds is clearly much less than the maximal length that will spontaneously dissociate in a time scale of years .",
    "it is also consistent with the fact that when stress is increased over time , rather than held constant , the duplex rupture force increases with the rate at which the force is applied @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , regardless of how long the observation time , for infinite length chains the critical force will still plateau at @xmath38 ; this limiting behavior is simply reached more slowly with @xmath7 for larger @xmath19 .    in fig.[fig :",
    "toymodel](c ) we show the effect of varying @xmath5 on @xmath3 .",
    "reducing this base - pair stability leads to a lower plateau height @xmath39 and sets the lower cutoff length below which @xmath40 to larger @xmath7 .",
    "broadly similar reasoning to that underlying the toy model has been applied to the unzipping of dna ( in which two strands are pulled apart from the same end of the duplex  see fig.[fig :",
    "modes](b ) ) @xcite .",
    "experiments in which force is applied dynamically have also been analyzed in terms of models of activated processes @xcite . despite this history ,",
    "the physical principles highlighted by the toy model have not been widely applied to understand the dependence of the critical shearing force on duplex length @xcite .",
    "the alternative reasoning originated from degennes , who modelled dna as a ladder with springs connecting both neighbors within a strand and bases paired by interstrand hydrogen bonding @xcite .",
    "he calculated the mechanical equilibrium of this system under applied shearing stress , and posited that an individual base - pair spring with extension above a certain critical value would rupture .",
    "degennes showed that , for longer strands , the shearing stress can be spread out over several base pairs in mechanical equilibrium , reducing the strain at the duplex ends and allowing the duplex to withstand higher stresses than a single isolated base pair .",
    "his result for the critical force is @xcite @xmath41 in which @xmath42 is the force required to rupture a single base pair and @xmath43 is a function of the spring constant between neighbors in a strand , @xmath44 , and the spring constant between base pairs @xmath45 .",
    "similarly to eq.[eq",
    ": toy_prediction ] , eq.[eq : dg_prediction ] also has an @xmath3 that increases with @xmath7 and plateaus in the long length limit .",
    "the underlying physics is , however , entirely different .",
    "the degennes model assumes that rupture can only occur when each base pair is individually unstable ; it does not allow for metastability and a finite time scale for rupture during which the system can break many base pairs to climb over a free - energy barrier .",
    "the shape of the curve is governed by @xmath46 , a property of the duplex state , rather than the relative properties of single - stranded and duplex dna .",
    "a number of groups have explored extensions and improvements to the degennes model @xcite , but their approaches remain fundamentally based on the idea that the dependence of @xmath3 on @xmath7 can be explained by the degree to which longer duplexes can spread mechanical stress over multiple base pairs , rather than because longer duplexes need a larger force to reduce the free - energy barrier opposing dissociation to a low enough value .    as well as being based on fundamentally different physics , the two approaches also make qualitatively distinct predictions .",
    "most obviously , eq.[eq : dg_prediction ] predicts a finite rupture force for @xmath47 , whereas eq.[eq : toy_prediction ] predicts @xmath48 only for @xmath49 .",
    "further , eq.[eq : toy_prediction ] predicts that @xmath23 depends logarithmically on the observation time @xmath19 through its linear dependence on @xmath50 ; by contrast , the degennes theory does not include @xmath19 .",
    "the experimental data from @xcite in fig.[fig : toymodel](a ) are suggestive of @xmath48 only above a certain value of @xmath51bp , as in fact was recognized by the authors .",
    "nonetheless , they attempted to fit the degennes model to their data @xcite , modifying eq.[eq : dg_prediction ] to @xmath52 which includes a new parameter @xmath53 and an additional term @xmath54 .",
    "the first parameter was set to @xmath55 , in order to generate a finite @xmath56 .",
    "they argued for a reduced effective duplex length @xmath57bp on the grounds that the end base pairs are always broken at room temperature .",
    "however , such an approach is inconsistent with the thermodynamics of dna as currently understood @xcite ; for example , hairpins with stems of three or four base pairs can be stable relative to the unfolded state at room temperature @xcite .",
    "additionally , this approach does not include a dependence on @xmath19 as we argued above ; the curve is identical for experiments that take milliseconds and experiments that take years . finally , the value of @xmath46 obtained from their fit , 0.147 , is unphysically low .",
    "@xmath58 would imply @xmath59 , _",
    "i.e. _ that stretching hydrogen bonds between base pairs is almost two orders of magnitude easier than extending the distance between stacked bases in a duplex . such an unreasonable value , necessary to force the curve to reach large @xmath7 values before plateauing , provides further evidence that the degennes theory does not explain the shape of @xmath23 .",
    "we note in passing that the reason for the term @xmath60 term in eq.[eq : hatch_prediction ] as compared to eq.[eq : dg_prediction ] is unclear ; this term shifts the curve slightly , but does not strongly influence the above discussion .",
    "although the toy model is useful in providing understanding , it is extremely crude and neglects a number of potentially important effects .",
    "most significantly , taking @xmath61 in eq.[eq : dgdagger ] is a very strong approximation . in this work",
    "we therefore use oxdna @xcite , a nucleotide level coarse - grained model of dna that captures both the elastic behavior of double and single strands , as well as the basic physics of bonding .",
    "it should therefore be able to describe in detail the effects of the shearing forces on a duplex , and capture metastable states , which we will argue are critical in order to obtain an @xmath23 that is consistent with experiment .",
    "we note that oxdna has the advantages of representing dna structure and mechanics more accurately than simpler statistical models such as those of refs . @xcite and @xcite .",
    "further , oxdna is not derived with either the assumptions of the toy model or of the degennes model and its derivatives in mind .",
    "rather , we use it to explore whether the findings of the toy model are robust to a more accurate model of dna thermodynamics and mechanics , and whether effects analogous to those identified by degennes are likely to play a significant role .",
    "in oxdna , each nucleotide is treated as a rigid body @xcite .",
    "oxdna nucleotides interact through potentials designed to mimic hydrogen - bonding , stacking , chain connectivity and excluded volume interactions ; these interactions combine to allow the formation of right - handed double helices between complementary strands at low temperatures .",
    "oxdna incorporates physically reasonable representations of the thermodynamics , mechanics and structure of single - stranded and duplex dna @xcite  the key ingredients whose interplay is central to this system .",
    "the model has been shown to reproduce important aspects of basic processes such as hybridization @xcite , toehold mediated strand displacement @xcite and hairpin formation @xcite .",
    "it has also been successfully applied to explore stress - induced transitions @xcite . in this paper",
    "we use a sequence - averaged parameterization of oxdna @xcite , which is ideal for identifying generic trends .",
    "since direct measurements of the rupture kinetics are very demanding , we estimate rates indirectly from the free - energy profiles of stressed duplexes . we simulate the model using the virtual move monte carlo ( vmmc ) algorithm of whitelam and geissler ( the variant in the appendix of ref .",
    "shear stress is generated by applying two anti - parallel forces of magnitude @xmath9 to the center of mass of the nucleotides at the @xmath1 end of each strand ( which are situated at opposite ends of the duplex ) .",
    "we measure the free - energy profile as a function of the number of base pairs between the two strands ( a base pair being defined by a hydrogen - bonding energy of less than @xmath62 . a cut - off which is around @xmath63 of the typical hydrogen - bonding energy in the model ) , using umbrella sampling @xcite to facilitate the measurement of less favorable states .",
    "we also use umbrella sampling to prohibit the strands from separating ( once separated , the strands would never rebind ) , and for simplicity we only include hydrogen - bonding interactions between native base pairs ( those present in the fully - formed duplex ) .",
    "it was shown @xcite that in oxdna non - native base pairs have only a minor effect for non - repetitive sequences on the hybridization transition in the absence of force ; the consequences of non - native base pairs for shearing induced rupture will be studied in detail elsewhere @xcite .",
    "we obtain the free - energy profiles at different force values , separated by 2 to 5 and spanning our range of interest , from umbrella sampling simulations at @xmath64 .",
    "the umbrella weights were adjusted iteratively to have a uniform sampling as a function of the number base pairs in the duplex .",
    "the starting configuration at each stage was chosen to be the final configuration from the previous iteration . at each force value",
    ", we ran 3 to 5 independent simulations , each with approximately @xmath65 vmmc steps per particle .",
    "the resulting free energies from independent simulations agreed , confirming that our free - energy profiles are indeed converged .",
    "the value of the rupture force @xmath3 for a given @xmath25 is then obtained via fitting the rupture force versus barrier height data to an interpolating piecewise cubic hermite polynomial @xmath66 ; @xmath67 .",
    "we determine the rupture force at other temperatures @xmath68 , from extrapolated free - energy profiles obtained using single histogram reweighting , based on the method of ferrenberg and swensden @xcite .",
    "note that the accuracy of the extrapolated free energies decreases when @xmath69 is far from @xmath70 .",
    "therefore , we restricted our considerations to temperatures where @xmath71 .",
    "we measure free - energy profiles of shearing for a range of forces and duplex lengths ; typical profiles are shown in fig.[fig : free - energy](a ) . at low forces , formation of each additional base pair is thermodynamically favorable but as the shear force is increased the slope of the profile becomes shallower and the duplex becomes less stable . on top of these overall trends ,",
    "we see features that reflect the helical geometry of the stressed duplex . a duplex that has intact base pairs equal to a half turn ( _ i_.e .",
    "approximately 6 to 7 base pairs ) has its maximum extension when the duplex axis is aligned with the force .",
    "when such a duplex loses or gains base pairs it can rotate its helical axis away from the direction of the force , allowing a greater extension per base pair ( see fig.[fig : free - energy](b ) ) .",
    "the result is a non - monotonic dependence of the free energy on the number of duplex base pairs ; the effect is strongest for short duplex sections , and explains the peak in free energy that appears at approximately 6 to 7 base pairs as the force increases .",
    "such geometrical effects are absent in degennes ladder model @xcite and in most subsequent developments of that approach , although a similar effect in the context of a 2d ladder model was considered by chakrabarti and nelson @xcite .    for comparison",
    ", we also measure the profile for unzipping ( when the two strands are pulled apart from the same end of the duplex , see fig.[fig : modes](b ) ) .",
    "typical behavior as a function of @xmath9 is shown in fig.[fig : free - energy](c ) . as with shearing ,",
    "base pairs become less stable as the force is increased .",
    "two differences with shearing are clear .",
    "firstly , the forces required to reduce stability are much lower ; this is because a single unzipped base pair increases the extension of the dna along the applied force much more than a single sheared base pair ( this is evident in fig.[fig : modes ] ) .",
    "secondly , the non - monotonicity observed for shearing is absent for this geometry ; regardless of the number of base pairs present it is always favorable to keep the helix axis perpendicular to the unzipping force .",
    "oxdna clearly shows a more complex dependence of free energies on @xmath9 than incorporated into the simple model .",
    "nonetheless , we can identify a barrier height @xmath72 in each profile as the free - energy difference between the ( local ) maximum in the profile with the smallest number of base pairs , and the lowest ( local ) minimum in the profile that has more base pairs than the maximum .",
    "we take these configurations to be proxies for the transition state and the duplex state , respectively , and assume that the dissociation rate is given by @xmath73 .",
    "previous studies with oxdna in the absence of stress have shown that attachment rates of duplexes are only weakly dependent on overall duplex stability @xcite ; this is consistent with the assumption that the detachment rate is largely determined by @xmath74 , as this barrier is the dominant factor in duplex stability .    as with the toy model",
    ", we can define a rupture force @xmath3 that is the force required to reduce @xmath72 to a certain value @xmath25 , set by the time scale of experimental observation .",
    "we plot critical rupture forces for unzipping and shearing as a function of duplex length @xmath7 in fig.[fig : free - energy](d ) for a range of @xmath25 values . despite the additional complexity of oxdna , the results are broadly consistent with the toy model ; in particular , the dependence of @xmath23 on the observation time is similar . in eq.[eq : toy_prediction ] the toy model predicts a linear dependence of @xmath23 on @xmath25 ( and hence a logarithmic dependence on @xmath19 ) at fixed @xmath7 ; fig.[fig : fc_as_fn_g](a ) shows that oxdna is in broad agreement .",
    "the agreement is not perfect , however , and in particular eq.[eq : toy_prediction ] predicts that the magnitude of the gradient of @xmath3 with @xmath25 should decrease monotonically as @xmath7 increases ; this is not apparent in our fits as the gradient for @xmath75 is shallower than for @xmath76 .",
    "in fact , this is due to non - linearities in the dependence of @xmath3 on @xmath25 ( when viewed at constant @xmath3 , the @xmath75 curve is actually steeper ) .",
    "this non - linearity is inconsistent with the toy model , which assumes that the properties of the transition state do not change with force .",
    "it is clear from fig.[fig : free - energy](a ) , however , the transition state moves to higher numbers of base pairs as the force increases and the geometrical effects discussed previously overwhelm the favorable base - pairing free energy for the final few base pairs .",
    "this can be interpreted as an increase in the offset parameter @xmath15 with @xmath9 , which helps to explain why @xmath3 is not perfectly linear in @xmath25 .",
    "unzipping lacks these kinds of geometrical effects ; an equivalent graph of @xmath23 against @xmath25 in fig.[fig : fc_as_fn_g](b ) does not show this apparent non - monotonic dependency of the fitted gradient with @xmath7 .     on @xmath25 at fixed @xmath7 as estimated by oxdna .",
    "( a ) shearing mode .",
    "( b ) unzipping mode .",
    "the apparent non - monotonicity in the fitted gradient that is present for shearing but absent for unzipping is due to the number of base pairs in the transition state changing with applied force . ]     with temperature as predicted by oxdna , defining @xmath23 as the force required to reduce the free energy barrier , @xmath77 to 17 ( corresponding to at ) .",
    "( b ) fit of oxdna model ( squares ) to the experimental data of hatch _",
    "et al._@xcite .",
    "the fitting procedure generates a value for the rupture barrier height of @xmath78 and includes a small rescaling of the temperature , for reasons described in the text . ]",
    "the degennes approach is based upon estimating the force at which each base pair is inherently unstable , so that rupture of the duplex occurs directly with each step being favorable .",
    "this criterion corresponds to the system ceasing to be metastable with a well - defined barrier .",
    "the toy model predicts that each base pair is inherently unstable when @xmath79 ; this force is @xmath7-independent .",
    "thus any variation in @xmath23 with @xmath7 as @xmath80 can not be explained by the toy model : it must arise from considerations such as those of degennes , or geometric factors such as those highlighted above that are absent in the toy model .",
    "we will now argue that , for oxdna at least , these factors only influence @xmath23 at very low @xmath7 .    in fig.[fig",
    ": free - energy](d ) we show how @xmath23 varies with @xmath25 .",
    "the lowest value of @xmath25 ( corresponding to the shortest time scale ) that we consider is 3kcalmol@xmath81 ; smaller values make the unambiguous identification of maxima and minima in the free energy profile difficult , and indeed the assumptions inherent in our kinetic model are less robust . even at this finite value of @xmath25",
    ", however , @xmath3 depends strongly on @xmath7 only for @xmath82 ; in the limit of @xmath80 , this dependence will be even further truncated .",
    "indeed , the shape of @xmath23 at @xmath83kcalmol@xmath81 still reflects the predictions of the toy model and its metastability - based arguments ( cutting through @xmath84 at finite @xmath7 , for example ) .",
    "the relatively short range of @xmath7 prior to the plateau as @xmath80 observed for oxdna is consistent with the fact that geometric effects are only large for helices below a single pitch length , and that there is no physical reason why the @xmath46 parameter in eq.[eq : dg_prediction ] should be much smaller than unity .",
    "oxdna allows exploration of the effect of temperature changes . in fig.[fig : vary_t](a ) , we report @xmath23 at a range of temperatures .",
    "both @xmath4 and @xmath85 in the exponent of eq.[eq : dgdagger ] depend on @xmath69 .",
    "thus to compare critical forces at different temperatures for the same observation time , we find the force @xmath3 which gives @xmath86 ( at , the standard temperature used in this study ) .",
    "we thereby include the full temperature dependence of the exponent in eq.[eq : arrhenius ] ; any temperature dependence in the prefactor @xmath18 is neglected .",
    "unsurprisingly , @xmath23 is reduced by temperature , as base pairs become less stable and free energy barriers of a certain height slightly easier to climb .",
    "consequently the plateau force @xmath39 drops and the length of duplex below which @xmath84 , @xmath56 , rises .",
    "these changes with temperature are similar to those seen for the toy model when base pair stability is varied , as shown in fig.[fig : toymodel](c ) ( note that in this case , the variation is performed at fixed @xmath87 ) .    the data of hatch _",
    "et al._were obtained at a lower salt concentration than those used to parameterize oxdna to duplex formation in the absence of force ( @xmath88 m as opposed to 0.5 m [ na@xmath89 ) , implying weaker duplexes in experiment .",
    "additionally , oxdna is known to slightly overestimate ( on the order of @xmath90 ) the critical force for the overstretching transition to ssdna at 0.5 m [ na@xmath89 ; this is essentially the critical shearing force for infinitely long strands . as a result ,",
    "the direct fit of oxdna to the experimental data ( using only @xmath25 as a fitting variable ) is only qualitative . to take these effects into account we fit to the data by shifting the temperature to @xmath91 , a slight ( @xmath92 absolute change ) increase when compared to the @xmath93 of the experiments .",
    "in addition to the temperature , we also need to fit @xmath25 which measures the effective barrier for rupture . using these two fitting parameters ,",
    "we find , as can be seen in fig.[fig : vary_t](b ) , very close agreement with the experiments of hatch _",
    "the value of @xmath78 is reasonable as it corresponds to approximately 6 or 7 base pairs @xcite , a sensible number for spontaneous rupture on the time scale of seconds @xcite . whilst the temperature rescaling is crude",
    ", it is equivalent to a slight rescaling of the interaction strengths within oxdna , producing a very similar model with slightly less stable base pairs .",
    "this oxdna - like model , which still possesses mechanical and structural properties close to those of physical dna , can quantitatively reproduce the experimental data .",
    "we therefore argue that the basic mechanism we propose , an activation based rupture of the duplex strands , can explain the experimental results .",
    "given the success of oxdna in describing the pure shearing mode shown in fig.[fig : modes](a ) we next turn to the mixed shearing and unzipping mode shown in fig.[fig : modes](c ) .",
    "wang and ha have designed a tension gauge tether ( tgt ) to measure forces that involves applying stress in this  mixed mode \" . in this setup",
    ", force is applied at the end of one strand and to any one base of the other strand , so that @xmath94 base pairs are sheared and @xmath95 base pairs are unzipped .",
    "note that the total appears to be @xmath96 : this is because there is no difference between unzipping and shearing of a single base pair ; for the analysis below it is helpful to define both quantities to include this ambiguous base pair .",
    "oxdna allows us to explore the physics of this more complex system , using the same assumption that @xmath3 is the force required to reduce @xmath25 to a specific value .",
    "[ fig : fc_n_dg](a ) shows the rupture force for a duplex of length @xmath97bp that is pulled in a mixed mode as a function of the number of sheared base pairs @xmath94 .",
    "we see a characteristic sigmoidal curve for @xmath98 at fixed @xmath7 .",
    "@xmath99 is identical to our pure shearing data in fig .",
    "[ fig : free - energy](d ) and depends on @xmath100 as expected .",
    "@xmath101 is identical to the pure unzipping data .",
    "the sigmoidal curves therefore interpolates between the unzipping and shearing limits .",
    "a lower bound on the critical force is given by @xmath102 as is clear from fig.[fig : fc_n_dg](b ) .",
    "the bound follows from two arguments .",
    "firstly , the system can be viewed as a sheared duplex of @xmath94 base pairs , with additional base pairs that must also be unzipped .",
    "although these additional base pairs might not substantially stabilize the tgt at high force , they can not act to destabilize it either ; thus @xmath103 . secondly , sheared base pairs are always more stable than base pairs subject to an unzipping force ( fig.[fig : free - energy](c ) ) , due to the far greater increase in extension upon rupture in the second case .",
    "therefore the system must be at least as stable as an @xmath7-base - pair duplex subject to pure unzipping ; @xmath104 .    at large forces ,",
    "the unzipped base pairs contribute almost nothing to the barrier to dissociation and hence do not strongly affect the stability of the tgt , because at forces @xmath105 each base pair subject to an unzipping force is inherently unstable .",
    "thus at large @xmath94 , @xmath98 follows @xmath106 very closely as is evident in fig.[fig : fc_n_dg](b ) . on closer inspection",
    ", we note that in fact @xmath98 is slightly greater than @xmath106 for @xmath107 .",
    "this discrepancy arises because in a purely sheared system , the base pairs present in the transition state can be anywhere within the duplex . in the tgt however , the unzipped base pairs at the end of the duplex anchor the final sheared base pairs ( as illustrated schematically in fig.[fig : fc_n_dg](c ) ) .",
    "this anchoring decreases the entropy of the transition state , and thus increases the barrier to tgt rupture slightly .",
    "together , the lower bound and the insight that @xmath108 for @xmath109 imply the sigmoidal curve for @xmath98 at fixed @xmath7 . at @xmath110 , @xmath111 .",
    "as @xmath94 decreases , the curve @xmath98 approximately follows @xmath106 , which has the characteristic shape discussed previously and @xmath98 drops towards @xmath112 increasingly rapidly .",
    "eventually , however , the lower bound @xmath104 comes into play , forcing the curve to plateau at low @xmath94 .",
    "wang and ha calibrated their tgt by assuming that @xmath113 @xcite , with @xmath106 given by eq.[eq : hatch_prediction ] ( the formula of hatch _ et al._@xcite ) .",
    "they used the parameterization of hatch _",
    "et al . _ , but set @xmath114 rather than @xmath115 ; due to this choice , @xmath116pn at @xmath117 , rather than 0 ( or 3.9pn , as would be predicted by the original degennes formula @xcite ) .",
    "their resultant calibration curve is shown in fig.[fig : fc_n_dg](b ) .",
    "note that the shape is quite different from that predicted by oxdna ; in particular it has no inflection .",
    "the wang and ha curve predicts a physically reasonable @xmath3 for @xmath118 by design , and , due to the choice of using the hatch parameterization of eq.[eq : hatch_prediction ] but neglecting @xmath53 , predicts a roughly reasonable value for @xmath117 . in this picture , however , the finite @xmath3 at @xmath117 is due to the robustness of a single sheared base pair rather than a duplex of length @xmath7 that is subject to unzipping .",
    "our results suggest that given agreement at @xmath117 and @xmath119 , the critical forces predicted by wang and ha s calibration approach would be far too high at intermediate values of @xmath94 .",
    "furthermore , we argue that @xmath98 depends on the time scale of observation ; a consideration that does not appear in the wang and ha calibration curve .",
    "in this article we argue that shearing of short dna duplexes should be understood as an activated process , in which a metastable duplex dissociates into single strands . whether or not a certain force is large enough to cause dissociation within an experiment therefore depends fundamentally on the observation time @xmath19 ; in principle , all duplexes subject to a constant force will dissociate permanently given enough time .",
    "we used an extremely simple toy model to highlight the basic predictions of such an understanding . for a given @xmath19",
    ", we must apply a large enough force to reduce the free - energy barrier opposing dissociation , @xmath4 , to @xmath36 .",
    "since more base pairs must be disrupted in longer duplexes to reach the transition state , the force - influenced stability per base pair must be less to achieve @xmath120 ; hence the critical force @xmath3 increases with duplex length @xmath7 . once the force is large enough to reduce the free - energy gain per base pair to zero , however , even the longest duplexes will have @xmath121 .",
    "this introduces a maximum @xmath3 , leading to a plateau in @xmath23 for long duplexes .",
    "importantly , this simple picture naturally predicts that @xmath23 tends to zero at finite @xmath7 .",
    "this overall behavior is consistent with experimental observations .    to go beyond the simple model , we have used oxdna , a coarse - grained model of dna , to obtain more physically realistic force - dependent free - energy barriers .",
    "oxdna reproduces the basic behavior predicted by the toy model , despite the more complicated free - energy profiles and force - extension properties .",
    "in particular , oxdna also predicts that @xmath23 tends to zero at finite @xmath7 , and that @xmath23 includes an approximately logarithmic dependence on the observation time .",
    "oxdna is itself a simplified model , but the key aspects of dna relevant to this study ( force - extension properties , thermal stability , geometry ) are known to be physically reasonable @xcite .",
    "the generic results are therefore likely to be robust ; a detailed investigation into the relationship between rates and free - energy barriers for sheared oxdna molecules , incorporating possible mis - aligned base pairs , is ongoing @xcite .",
    "we have also demonstrated that , by slightly adjusting the interaction strengths in oxdna , in part to take into account the fact that it was parameterized at a different salt concentration , we can fit the available experimental data quantitatively , supporting the essence of our claims .",
    "previous work has contended that the shape of @xmath23 arises because a shorter duplex is immediately unstable to rupture ( rather than metastable with a short enough life time ) at a lower force than longer duplexes @xcite .",
    "we see evidence that shorter duplexes are indeed unstable at lower forces in our data for oxdna , but we argue that this is not the primary factor in determining the shape of @xmath23 . conceptually , it is clear that any theory that describes whether a molecular system undergoes change on a time scale of seconds or more should allow for metastability . in terms of concrete experimental evidence , it is known that duplexes of a few base pairs will spontaneously dissociate in the absence of force on a short time scale @xcite .",
    "this is consistent with the data of hatch _",
    "et al._that show @xmath23 tending to zero at finite @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "this behavior does not naturally arise in models that predict @xmath23 based on absolute instability rather than metastability .",
    "further evidence against the degennes model arises from the observation that hatch _",
    "et al._needed to use unphysical values for the ratio of the spring constants between stacked neighbors in the same strand and hydrogen - bonded base pairs on opposite strands in order for the theory to fit their data .",
    "further tests of the mechanisms that determine the critical force could be explored by experiments in which the observational time scale is varied .",
    "et al._did consider time scales between 1s and 3s , but given the approximately logarithmic variation expected in @xmath3 with @xmath19 , it is unsurprising that systematic effects were not visible above experimental noise .",
    "the approach presented in this work predicts a change in @xmath23 with @xmath19 ; previous arguments based on absolute instability do not .",
    "data from a wider range of duplex lengths @xmath7 would help to differentiate between the typical shapes of @xmath23 predicted by the two curves .",
    "we also make predictions for the temperature dependence of @xmath23 , which could be tested in experiments .",
    "we have also used oxdna to predict @xmath98 for a mixed system in which @xmath94 of the @xmath7 base pairs are sheared , and the remainder are subject to an unzipping force .",
    "such a system is the basis of the interesting tension gauge tether ( tgt ) proposed by wang and ha @xcite for measuring biomolecular forces .",
    "we argue that the shape of @xmath98 is very different from previously supposed , showing a characteristic sigmoidal shape as @xmath94 is increased at fixed @xmath7 . at small @xmath94 , @xmath98 approaches the pure unzipping force @xmath122 , but approximates the critical force for shearing an @xmath94-base duplex , @xmath106 , at larger @xmath94 . not only",
    "do we predict that careful calibration of the tgt will reveal this complex @xmath98 , we also claim that the time scale of experimental observation will influence @xmath98 , in analogy with the pure shearing system . thus quantitative use of",
    "the tgt will require extensive calibration .",
