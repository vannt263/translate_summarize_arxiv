    "in the standard model of particle physics ( sm ) sub - permille accuracy is reached in the prediction of the ratios @xmath9 of decay rates for the pseudoscalar @xmath10 and @xmath11 mesons .",
    "this excellent accuracy ( @xmath12 , @xmath13 ) is due to cancellations of the hadronic uncertainties@xcite and the precise knowledge of the electromagnetic correction @xmath14 .",
    "the factor @xmath15 accounts for helicity suppression and makes @xmath16 very sensitive to sm extensions involving pseudo - scalar currents and non - universal corrections , which are expected to induce variations of @xmath16 of the order @xmath17 .",
    "in particular sm extensions involving lepton flavour violation ( lfv ) are currently not ruled out by experiment .",
    "the current world average @xmath18 ( pdg ) dates back to three experiments performed in the 1970s , and has insufficient precision ( @xmath19 ) for stringent sm tests .",
    "a series of recent preliminary results from na48/2 and kloe represents a significant improvement : combining these results with the pdg value yields a precision of @xmath20@xcite .",
    "on the other hand , for what concerns the future programme , the @xmath7 decay is a flavor changing neutral current process which proceeds through box and electroweak penguin diagrams .",
    "the predicted values  @xcite of the branching fraction are of the order of @xmath21 .",
    "the hadronic matrix element can be parametrized in terms of the @xmath22 branching ratio , well known experimentally , reducing the theoretical uncertainty to about 5% and thus making the @xmath7 decay a theoretically clean environment sensitive to new physics .",
    "the existing measurement of the @xmath7 branching ratio , based on 7 observed events  @xcite , is compatible with sm within errors , but a 10% accuracy measurement of the branchig ratio is required to provide a decisive test of new physics scenarios .",
    "this is the goal of the proposed na62 experiment at cern sps  @xcite , which aims to collect @xmath8 @xmath7 events in two years , keeping background contamination at the level of 10% .",
    "for the first phase of na62 the experimental setup is largely based on na48/2 .",
    "the beam line k12 at cern sps is capable of delivering simultaneous narrow momentum band @xmath23 and @xmath24 beams . a central momentum of 75 gev / c was used during 2007 data taking .",
    "most of the data were taken with the @xmath25 beam only because the muon sweeping system is more effective in rejecting @xmath26 .",
    "conversely , about @xmath27 of the data were recorded with @xmath24 beam only in order to measure the background induced by the beam halo via @xmath28 decays .",
    "the following detectors , located downstream a vacuum decay volume ( @xmath29 in length ) , were exploited : a magnetic spectrometer composed of four drift chambers ( dchs ) and a spectrometric magnet ( providing a track momentum resolution of @xmath30}/p=0.47\\% \\oplus p\\cdot0.02\\%$ ] ) ; a liquid krypton electromagnetic calorimeter ( lkr ) used for @xmath31 detection and particle identification ; a scintillator hodoscope ( hod ) used for timing measurement and to produce fast trigger signals .",
    "a minimum bias trigger configuration was employed , resulting in relatively low trigger purities , but high efficiencies for leptons with momentum @xmath32 .",
    "the main data sample was taken during the four months of data taking in 2007 .",
    "about @xmath33 sps spills were recorded , corresponding to 300 tb of raw data .",
    "additional data were collected in 2008 to address in detail some systematic uncertainties .",
    "the analysis strategy is based on counting the numbers of reconstructed @xmath4 and @xmath34 candidates collected simultaneously , consequently the result does not rely on kaon flux measurement and several systematic effects , such as parts of the trigger and detection efficiencies , cancel in the ratio .",
    "the analysis is performed independently in bins of momentum of the charged track ( @xmath35 ) , due to strong dependence of the backgrounds and acceptance on this variable .",
    "the ratio @xmath1 is computed in each momentum bin after having subtracted the background events from the @xmath4 and @xmath34 candidates .",
    "correction factors are then applied in order to account for acceptances and for trigger , reconstruction and particle identification efficiencies .",
    "due to the topological similarity of @xmath4 and @xmath34 decays , a large part of the selection criteria is common for both decays .",
    "this leads to cancellations of the related systematic uncertainties in @xmath1 .",
    "particle identification based on the ration of energy @xmath36 deposited in the calorimeter and the momentum measured by the spectrometer @xmath37 ( @xmath38 for electrons , @xmath39 for muons ) and kinematic identification obtained with the measurement of the missing invariant mass ( @xmath40 for electrons ) are exploited for separating @xmath4 and @xmath34 decays .",
    "the average momentum of the incoming kaons is measured with @xmath41 decays and is used for @xmath6 kinematical reconstruction ( @xmath42 ) ; a narrow kaon momentum spectrum ( @xmath43 ) is used in order to minimize the corresponding contribution to the @xmath42 resolution . after selection , @xmath44 @xmath4 candidates are identified .",
    "the present analysis is based on the study of a sub - sample ( @xmath45 ) of the full data sample .",
    "the study of the background is the main topic of the analysis .",
    "detailed studies with data and montecarlo are performed in order to identify and measure the main sources of background .",
    "the following background contributions have been identified : ( 1 ) @xmath34 events where the @xmath46 is mis - identified as an electron due to `` catastrophic '' bremsstrahlung in the lkr ( the amount of background induced is @xmath47 ) ; ( 2 ) @xmath48 events : by convention , the inner bremsstrahlung ( ib ) part of the radiative @xmath49 process is included into @xmath1 , while the structure dependent ( sd ) @xmath49 process , which can not be accurately computed , is not .",
    "its contribution has to be measured directly and is @xmath50 ; ( 3 ) beam muon halo with @xmath51 decays : the @xmath6 decay signature consists of a single reconstructed track , thus the background in @xmath6 samples induced by the beam halo is an issue ( amount of background induced is @xmath52 ) .",
    "samples of reconstructed @xmath6 candidates , of the charge not present in the beam , provide measurements of the halo background . thus the separate @xmath23 and @xmath24 beam only samples allow for cross - subtraction of the halo background with precisions much better than statistical uncertainty of the measurement ; ( 4 ) minor sources of background are electrons from @xmath53 and @xmath54 decays ( contributions at the level of @xmath55 ) .",
    "for the second phase of na62 , a highly intense ( 800 mhz rate ) 75 gev / c positively charged particle beam will be produced by directing a 400 gev / c primary sps proton beam onto a be target .",
    "the beam is positron free and is composed by 6% of @xmath23 ( unseparated beam ) , which will be tagged by the existing differential cerenkov counter called cedar  @xcite .",
    "the average rate seen by the downstream detectors will be 11 mhz , due to kaon decays and accidentals coming from the beam - line .",
    "the beam spectrometer , measuring @xmath56 and the direction of the kaon track inside the decay volume , consists of three stations of a hybrid si pixel detector . a time resolution of at least 200 ps per station is required to provide a suitable tag for the kaon track .",
    "the pion spectrometer , measuring @xmath57 and the pion direction , is made by low mass straw chambers placed in vacuum , in order to reduce multiple scattering .",
    "a 18 m long rich located after the pion spectrometer , and filled with ne at atmospheric pressure , is the core of particle identification : it will identify pions with momentum greater than 15 gev / c and it will provide a time measurement of the downstream track with 100 ps time resolution . a hermetic combination of calorimeters , comprising the existing lkr calorimeter and covering up to 50 mrad , will be used to identify and veto the photons produced in kaon decays .",
    "in addition , a specific detector to veto muons tracks will be used downstream .",
    "the measurements of @xmath1 in bins of track momentum ( @xmath37 ) are found to be compatible and independent of @xmath37 , which indicates good control over the main systematic effects .",
    "the total error is @xmath58 consisting of a statistical error of @xmath59 and systematic uncertainties of @xmath2 mainly due to background subtraction ( @xmath60 , @xmath61 and @xmath55 , respectively , due to @xmath34 , @xmath48 and beam halo background ) .",
    "further studies of second - order effects and minor background sources are currently underway in order to finalize the measurement of @xmath1 with the currently considered partial @xmath45 data sample .",
    "the total uncertainty of the partial result is @xmath62 ( below the @xmath63 level for the first time ) .    the whole na62 data sample of @xmath64 millions @xmath4 decay candidates , which is one order of magnitude larger than the existing world sample , allows pushing the statistical uncertainty to a level below @xmath65 .",
    "significant improvements of the @xmath34 background and beam halo systematic uncertainties are possible thanks to the special data sets collected in 2008 and dedicated to the ke2 systematics studies .",
    "the uncertainty due to the @xmath48 ( sd ) background is expected to be decreased by a direct measurement of this process .",
    "the ultimate precision of the measurement is expected to reach the @xmath2 level , meeting the goal declared in the proposal@xcite .",
    "the na62 programme foresees a measurement of br(@xmath7 ) with a @xmath6610% accuracy .",
    "the ultra - rare @xmath7 decay is a unique environment for new physics searches .",
    "the r&d program is well advanced : during the 2007 run the collaboration tested successfully a full length rich counter prototype and a full length straw prototype in the actual vacuum tube .",
