    "several hundred convincing galaxy candidates have now been uncovered at @xmath15 ( _ e.g. _ bunker & stanway 2004 ; taniguchi et al .",
    "2005 ; ouchi et al . 2005 ; shioya et al . 2005 ; yan et al . 2005",
    "; bouwens et al . 2006 ) , with a few ( somewhat less convincing ) galaxy candidates even reported at @xmath16 ( bouwens et al .",
    "the discovery of such objects has been used to set interesting new constraints on the cosmic history of star - formation density ( _ e.g. _ stark & ellis 2005 , bouwens & illingworth 2006 ) , but has not , as yet , presented a serious challenge to current theories of galaxy formation .",
    "this is because the masses of essentially all of these objects are relatively modest ( @xmath17 ) , and the observed large numbers of such objects are consistent with the predictions of at least some current galaxy - formation models ( e.g. nagamine et al .",
    "2006 ) .",
    "by contrast , the discovery of even a small number of very massive galaxies at these extreme redshifts can present a stern challenge for both semi - analytic and hydrodynamic galaxy - formation models .",
    "indeed , given the steep decline in the predicted number density of high - mass halos at @xmath2 ( e.g. somerville 2004 ) , the discovery of a significant number density of very massive objects at such redshifts has the potential to provide an interesting test of the now well - established paradigm of hierarchical structure growth within @xmath18 .    for this reason ,",
    "two recent studies have generated a lot of interest .",
    "first , eyles et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , in their detailed study of 3 spectroscopically confirmed lyman - break galaxies at @xmath19 , reported that these objects already contained a substantial , evolved mass of stars , apparently formed at redshifts as high as @xmath20 .",
    "second , mobasher et al .",
    "( 2005 ) presented apparently convincing evidence for the existence of an extremely massive galaxy ( hudf - jd2 ; @xmath21 ) lying within the nicmos hubble ultra deep field ( hudf ) at the extreme redshift of @xmath1 .",
    "although this is just one object , its discovery within such a very small - area survey such as the hudf is undoubtedly surprising and has already generated considerable interest ( _ e.g. _ panagia et al . 2005 ) .",
    "motivated by the discovery of hudf - jd2 , we decided to revisit our existing redshift determinations for @xmath22-band selected galaxies in goods - south ( caputi et al .",
    "2004 ; 2005 ; 2006 ) , and to conduct a systematic search for the existence of _ any _ galaxies in this sample at very high redshift ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "the key point here is that hudf - jd2 is sufficiently massive that it is relatively bright in the near - infrared , with @xmath23 .",
    "thus it should be possible to detect comparable objects ( less than a factor of 1.5 more massive at @xmath24 ) within our complete @xmath25 sample of 2898 objects ( galaxies and stars ) in the goods - south field , which covers a solid angle @xmath5 times larger than that subtended by the nicmos hudf .",
    "it is also clear that , in this extreme mass domain , the discovery of even one object within the entire goods - south field would be extremely important .",
    "given the apparent evidence for some moderately evolved stellar populations in high - redshift galaxies , and because we wished to search for any galaxies over a relatively wide redshift range @xmath26 , we decided not to base our search on strict colour criteria .",
    "such criteria are frequently adopted in the selection of high - redshift galaxies , in order to ensure minimal contamination from low - redshift interlopers ( e.g. bunker & stanway 2004 ) . however , especially at @xmath27 , such clean selection inevitably comes at the expense of completeness , and introduces an inevitable bias in favour of the youngest , and hence lowest mass : light ratio galaxies .",
    "instead , we updated the dataset ultilised by caputi et al .",
    "( 2006 ) with the addition of the recently released isaac @xmath28-band and complete spitzer 4-band irac data , and then derived new redshift estimates for all 2688 galaxies in the @xmath25 sample by fitting a range of single and double component spectrophotometric models to the full 11-band optical - infrared photometry .",
    "the full results of this process are described in cirasuolo et al .",
    "( 2006 ) in which we have utilised this new dataset to explore the cosmological evolution of the galaxy mass function out to @xmath29 .",
    "in the current paper we use this work simply as a starting point for the careful study of the relatively small subsample of galaxies which were found to have even marginally convincing solutions at @xmath2 .",
    "the paper is structured as follows . in section 2",
    "we briefly describe how we have utilised the updated public dataset within the goods - south field to create a revised , complete sample of 2688 galaxies with @xmath25 and full , aperture - matched 11-band hst / acs+vlt / isaac+spitzer / irac photometry . in section 3",
    "we describe the redshift - estimation technique , and demonstrate that it yields robust solutions at the correct redshifts for known , spectroscopically - confirmed galaxies at @xmath30 .",
    "then , in section 4 , we describe the results of applying this technique to isolate a maximal sample of 32 potential @xmath2 galaxies within our goods - south sample , ( using 2.8-arcsec diameter aperture photometry ) which was then refined down to a subsample of 19 serious candidates using smaller aperture sextractor ( bertin & arnout 1996 ) measurements .",
    "section 5 then presents the results of a detailed investigation of the multi - frequency data for these remaining 19 candidates , with manual aperture photometry leading to the rejection of a further 13 objects to lower redshift . in this section",
    "we also show that , by subjecting hudf - jd2 to the same treatment , we find that it does not lie at @xmath1 ( as concluded by mobasher et al .",
    "2005 ) , but is in fact a dusty , evolved galaxy at @xmath31 .",
    "the final interrogation of our remaining six candidate @xmath2 massive galaxies in presented in section 6 .",
    "in particular , we explore the robustness of the derived redshifts when the assumed optical extinction is allowed to float up to values as large as @xmath32 .",
    "finally , in section 7 we briefly discuss the implications of our results in the context of theoretical models of structure formation .",
    "all optical and infrared magnitudes are given in the @xmath33 system ( oke & gunn 1983 ) .",
    "masses and ages have been calculated assuming a cosmological model with @xmath34 , @xmath35 , and @xmath36 .",
    "the survey area available for this study is determined by the coverage of the vlt isaac @xmath28-band imaging of the goods - south field released in september 2005 .",
    "these data cover 125 arcmin@xmath37 , for which there already exists complete isaac imaging in @xmath38 , and @xmath22 , along with complete hst acs imaging in @xmath39 ( 3 orbits ) , @xmath40 ( 2.5 orbits ) , @xmath41 ( 2.5 orbits ) and @xmath42 ( 5.0 orbits ) .",
    "spitzer irac imaging , in all 4 irac bands has now also become available for the whole of this field , with the 3.6@xmath13 and 4.5@xmath13 imaging considered by caputi et al .",
    "( 2006 ) now supplemented by the 5.8@xmath13 and 8.0@xmath13 imaging .",
    "the parent sample consists of the 2898 objects in this field which have @xmath43 within a 2.8-arcsec diameter aperture . at this magnitude",
    "the limit the sample should be essentially 100% complete .",
    "star - galaxy separation ( sextractor stellaricity parameter @xmath44 in the acs @xmath8-band images ) led to the rejection of 210 objects as stars , leaving a final complete sample of 2688 galaxies .",
    "following several recent deep multi - object spectroscopy campaigns ( vanzella et al . 2005 ; doherty et al . 2005 ; vanzella et al . 2006",
    "; roche et al .",
    "2006 ) , 850 galaxies in our sample now possess reliable spectroscopic redshifts . a further 188 galaxies , with @xmath45 , can be allocated solid redshifts from the combo-17 survey ( wolf et al .",

    "it is tempting to consider the use of small ( @xmath63 arcsec ) apertures for source photometry in the acs images .",
    "however , while most of the flux from genuine high - redshift ( @xmath2 ) galaxies is likely to lie within a 1 arcsec aperture , there are obvious dangers in combining small aperture hst photometry with the larger apertures required to obtain a robust estimate of total flux in the near - infrared ground - based imaging , and the spitzer irac imaging . in particular , unless sufficient care is taken with the aperture corrections , the strength of any putative break between the @xmath38 and @xmath42 filters can be exaggerated , leading to an erroneous conclusion in favour of a very high - redshift galaxy .    to minimize the effect of any such bias we based our initial photometric catalogue on the use of 2.8-arcsec diameter apertures for all the optical and near - infrared data .",
    "for the 4 spitzer irac bands we also used a 2.8-arcsec diameter aperture but then applied an aperture correction to estimate the anticipated total flux for a point source ( ranging from 0.55 mag . at 3.6@xmath13 to 1.0 mag . at 8@xmath13 ) .",
    "as we explain below , once we had used these data to isolate the subset of potential @xmath2 galaxies , we considered alternative strategies to push the imaging closer to its photometric limit .",
    "the photometric redshift for each galaxy was computed by fitting the 11 photometric data points ( from the @xmath61-band to @xmath64 ) with synthetic galaxy templates .",
    "these templates were produced using the stellar population synthesis models of bruzual & charlot ( 2003 ) , assuming a salpeter initial mass function ( imf ) with a lower and upper mass cutoff at 0.1 and 100 @xmath65 respectively ( we also explored the use of the jimenez et al .",
    "( 2004 ) models , and the chabrier ( 2003 ) imf , but these yielded inferior fits to the data ) .",
    "a range of templates was constructed based on different assumed star - formation histories . specifically , we considered i ) a single instantaneous starburst with passive evolution thereafter , ii ) exponentially declining star - formation rates with @xmath66-folding times in the range @xmath67 , and iii ) two - component burst models ( to cope with the possibility of more stochastic star - formation histories ) . in all cases we adopted solar metallicity .    to account for the effects of dust reddening we adopted the obscuration law of calzetti et al .",
    "initially we allowed @xmath6-band extinction to range up to @xmath68 , but ultimately we explored the expanded range @xmath69 ( see section 6 ) .",
    "we also added a prescription for the lyman series absorption due to the hi clouds in the inter galactic medium , following madau ( 1995 ) .",
    "some additional information was also utilised to exclude unreasonable redshift solutions .",
    "first the photometric redshift was constrained to lie at @xmath70 if the source had been detected in the ( relatively shallow ) @xmath71-band imaging of the cdfs undertaken as part of the eso wide field survey ( arnouts et al .",
    "second , a high - redshift solution was excluded if it resulted in a galaxy lying more than 1.3 magnitudes brightward of the @xmath72 relation defined by the most luminous radio galaxies ( willott et al .",
    "2003 ) , in effect equivalent to a galaxy more massive than a present - day @xmath73 elliptical .",
    "our redshift estimation code has been tested for the @xmath74 galaxies in our goods - south @xmath22-selected sample which possess a reliable spectroscopic or combo-17 redshift . as detailed in cirasuolo et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , the 1@xmath75 uncertainty in estimated redshift inferred from this test is @xmath76 .",
    "however , of more specific interest for the present study is the ability of our method to accurately estimate the redshifts of known objects at @xmath2 . to check this",
    ", we applied our code to estimate the redshifts of the four spectroscopically confirmed @xmath77 galaxies in the udf / goods field .",
    "this is a useful test because the published multi - wavelength photometry for these 4 sources ( eyles et al .",
    "2005 , stark et al .",
    "2006 ) provides comparable wavelength coverage to the photometry available for our complete goods - south sample .",
    "the results of this test are summarized in table 1 , and illustrated in figure 1 which shows , for each galaxy , a plot of @xmath48 versus @xmath8 ( marginalised over age , normalization , and @xmath78 ) and a comparison of the best fitting model sed with the broad - band photometry .",
    "clearly , the code does an excellent job of recovering the redshifts of these galaxies .",
    "however , this is arguably a rather easy test , since these are , by nature of their selection , rather clear - cut examples of young lyman - break galaxies . as discussed further below , and as illustrated by the example of hudf - jd2 ( mobasher et al . 2005 )",
    ", the situation is inevitably more confused if one is dealing with a potentially more evolved stellar population , with a less blue sed longward of the lyman break .",
    "nevertheless , the results shown in figure 1 do at least confirm that our multi - wavelength sed fitting technique can efficiently and unambiguously identify high - redshift galaxies without recourse to any pre - selection of candidates based on , for example , specific colour criteria .    for completeness",

    "at this point in the analysis , the values adopted for limiting magnitudes in the case of sextractor non detections become crucial . in particular , the extent to which a high - redshift solution is favoured can be critically dependent on how any apparent non - detections are treated .    one way to tackle",

    "we note here that at least some of these limits seem rather deep compared to the limits adopted by some other authors working with hudf data .",
    "for example bouwens et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , in their search for @xmath42-drop galaxies in the hudf , appear to have found a typical 2@xmath75 limit of @xmath88 within a 0.6-arcsec diameter aperture , which converts to @xmath89 for a 0.9-arcsec diameter aperture , almost a magnitude shallower than adopted by mobasher et al .",

    "we investigated the effect of calculating equivalent limits for our goods non - detections ( _ i.e. _ scaling the mobasher et al .",

    "however , as illustrated in the central panel of figure 2 , the adoption of such limits would lead us to the conclusion that many of our remaining 19 sources lie at very high redshifts .",
    "faced with such a radical conclusion we decided to abandon the inferred detection limits , and perform manual aperture photometry for all 19 galaxies to establish the true level of signal and noise , so that even the apparent sextractor non - detections could be properly incorporated within the @xmath48 fitting in a consistent manner .    for consistency",

    ", in preparation ) .",
    "this catalogue contains 24@xmath13 detections for 5 out of the 6 galaxies listed in table 6 ( all except 3088 ) .",
    "clearly , such a high detection rate at mid - infrared wavelengths strongly supports the lower redshift dusty solutions for these objects ( we note that hudf - jd2 was also detected at 24@xmath13 ; mobasher et al .",
    "third , our own re - analysis of hudf - jd2 , and the discrepancy between the goods - music redshift estimates and our own results for several of these putative high - redshift galaxies , serves to demonstrate just how sensitive any conclusion in favour of @xmath2 can be to the treatment of marginal and non - detections in the optical wavebands . as demonstrated by figure 1 , this is a much less serious issue for young / blue high - redshift candidates for which an acceptable lower - redshift dust - obscured solution often does not exist . however , the results presented here for redder objects serves to illustrate just how hard it will be to unambiguously identify older ( and hence potentially more massive ) objects at extreme redshifts on the basis of spectral fitting to even the most comprehensive photometric dataset .",

    "( 2001 ) ( assuming a salpeter imf ) .",
    "the result of the unsuccessful search at @xmath2 described here is illustrated by the upper limit plotted at @xmath132 , which represents the comoving number density in the redshift bin @xmath133 if _ one _ of the 6 final high - redshift candidates listed in table 6 really does lie within this high - redshift bin .",
    "also plotted in this figure are the comoving number density of virialized dark - matter halos above 3 different mass thresholds , as derived from modified press - schechter theory ( percival , priv .",
    "comm . ) .",
    "several features of this diagram are worthy of comment .",
    "first , at no redshift does the number density of high - mass galaxies present a fundamental problem for @xmath134cdm ; the number density of potential dark - matter halos ( 10 - 20 times more massive than the stellar masses of the galaxies ) clearly exceeds the inferred number density of the massive galaxies .",
    "nevertheless , out to redshift @xmath135 , the number density of these most massive galaxies changes only slowly ( compared to the dark matter curves ) and hence , for this class of galaxies , the inferred dark - matter : stellar mass ratio appears to evolve from @xmath136 at @xmath137 to @xmath138 at @xmath139 .",
    "such inferred values do not appear unreasonable ( see , for example , mandelbaum et al .",
    "2006 ) , and this apparent evolution of the dark - matter : stellar mass ratio can be viewed as yet another manifestation of ` downsizing ' or apparently ` anti - hierarchical ' galaxy formation ( e.g. heavens et al . 2004 ) .",
    "however , the upper limit derived here indicates that this ` anti - heirarchical ' behaviour does not persist beyond @xmath140 , and that , at higher redshift , the number density of massive galaxies drops off as rapidly ( or possibly more rapidly ) than the number density of potential host dark - matter halos .",
    "an improved measurement of the comoving number density of these rare high - mass galaxies at high - redshift clearly requires a substantially larger survey than the 125 square arcmin covered by the goods - south multi - wavelength imaging .",
    "the first such survey of the necessary depth and area is now underway .",
    "this is the ukidss ultra deep survey ( uds ) , which covers 0.8 square degrees , and is designed to ultimately reach a @xmath141-band 5-@xmath75 detection limit of @xmath142 ( ab ) .",
    "this survey will therefore cover 25 times the area of goods - south , to a magnitude limit substantially deeper than the @xmath22-limit of the goods - south survey analysed here . a failure to find any galaxies with @xmath126 and @xmath2 within the ukidss uds would move the upper limit shown at @xmath110 in figure 6 down by over an order of magnitude . a first analysis , based on the ukidss early data release , has provided evidence for a number of moderately massive galaxies at @xmath143 , but as yet has not revealed any as massive as @xmath126 ( mclure et al .",
