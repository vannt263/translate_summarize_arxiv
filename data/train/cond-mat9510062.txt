    "if we wish to proceed to higher order in @xmath34 , we note that to order @xmath0 only rpa - type diagrams contribute since each @xmath34 vertex carries a factor @xmath0 , which has to be compensated by a spin summation , i.e. , a closed loop of conduction electrons ( in fact , the ground - state energy of the hubbard model  ( [ ham_c ] ) to order @xmath0 is given by summing the diagrams of rpa type and neglecting the @xmath84 constraint ) .",
