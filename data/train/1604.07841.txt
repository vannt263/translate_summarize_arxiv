    "cosmic inflation has long been a leading paradigm describing the universe at its very early stage @xcite .",
    "it not only explains various puzzles of the big bang cosmology , but also provides the primordial fluctuations for the universe which seeded the cmb anisotropy and large scale structures as we see today .",
    "its predictions for these primordial fluctuations agree very well with current observations .",
    "the inflation occurred at very high energy , during which the hubble scale of the universe can be as high as @xmath0gev , much higher than any artificial collider one can imagine . on top of that , the measurements of inflation observables through cmb or large scale structures have achieved impressive precision @xcite , and the precision will be further increased in the foreseeable future @xcite .",
    "based on this observation , it has been proposed recently that inflation can be used as a probe of the particle mass and spin spectra of new physics at high energies @xcite , and for this reason it is dubbed the `` cosmological collider '' by arkani - hamed and maldacena @xcite .",
    "there has been a world of inflation models @xcite .",
    "their general predictions can be well consistent with observations , but they are very difficult to be discriminated . on the other hand , while new physics beyond standard model is generally expected to appear at some high energy scale , we are not sure what the new physics would be and at which scale it lies . though our ignorance of inflation and new physics is vast , we do know that the standard model ( sm ) of particle physics is a very good description of , with a few exceptions , almost all microscopic phenomena up to tev scale , and we do know that all sm fields should exist during inflation , too . therefore , before trying to discover any new physics based on inflation , it is of vital importance to study the behavior of these well - known sm fields in an inflating universe and their possible observable consequences . following arkani - hamed and maldacena , we would also dub this program as `` a calibration of the cosmological collider '' .    in this paper , we will make the first step toward this goal , by studying the behavior of sm fields during inflation , including spin-0 higgs boson , spin-1/2 fermion and spin-1 gauge boson .",
    "we will not assume specific model for inflation , but it is important to distinguish two classes of inflation models , depending on whether the inflaton is a higgs boson that triggers the electroweak symmetry breaking and also gives mass to all sm fermions at low energies .",
    "when the inflaton is ( or has a component of ) the electroweak higgs field , a scenario known as higgs inflation @xcite , all sm fermions and gauge bosons would acquire huge mass during inflation , due to the very large vev of the higgs field . on the other hand ,",
    "if the inflaton is some scalar other than higgs field , all sm field would remain massless at the tree level during inflation as long as higgs does nt develop large vev .    in this paper",
    "we will focus on the non - higgs inflation scenarios , and leave a parallel study of the very intriguing possibility of higgs inflation to a future work . as mentioned above , in generic non - higgs inflation scenarios all sm fields",
    "would apparently be massless , but this is only at the tree - level .",
    "loop corrections can be very important for massless fields during inflation as they can generate late - time divergences .",
    "there have been extensive studies of such late - time divergences ( sometimes known as the ir growth ) of massless loop correction in inflation background as well as in de sitter space ( ds ) and its euclidean version .",
    "similar ir issue is also known for a long time in thermal field theory .    in all these cases ,",
    "the late - time divergences can be traced back to the existence of zero modes , which makes some higher order loop diagrams just as important as one loop diagrams .",
    "it is also known that once we properly resum these ir divergent loop diagrams , an ir finite result can be obtained , and in some cases the massless field would develop a nonzero mass due to the ir resummation .",
    "we expect similar phenomenon appear for all sm fields during inflation . that is , the usual sm interactions among these fields , together with their tree - level zero mass , would generate a whole series of ir divergent loop correction to their two - point functions .",
    "the goal of this paper is to calculate these ir divergent loop corrections to two - point functions of sm fields and resum them consistently using dynamical renormalization group method .",
    "as our first step , we will make the calculation for a general massless scalar boson , a general massless dirac fermion , and a general gauge boson , respectively , assuming all renormalizable interactions among these fields , to mimic the sm dynamics .",
    "we will generalize the results in this paper to the realistic sm and study their observable consequences in a follow - up work @xcite .",
    "then it remains to understand how we can probe these quantum - corrected two - point functions through inflation observables .",
    "for this point we note that all sm fields carry some gauge charges so they enter non - gaussianities only through loop diagrams . in the most pessimistic situation ,",
    "the inflaton interacts with sm fields only through gravitation .",
    "but it is well possible that the interaction between inflaton and sm fields are much stronger .",
    "in fact if we assume the inflaton @xmath1 comes from a sector of new physics whose energy scale is @xmath2 , then in effective field theory it is expected that the inflaton @xmath1 can interact with sm fields through following terms in the lagrangian , =( c_1 + c_2 + + c_3 + c_4 + ) _ , where @xmath3 represents whatever gauge singlet operator formed by sm fields and the @xmath4-coefficients are typically @xmath5 coupling constants . when @xmath6 , this interaction will be greatly enhanced relative to gravitation , and thus make the loop signal of sm fields potentially detectable , through process like the diagrams in fig.[fig_smloop ] . in these diagrams ,",
    "the dashed lines represent inflaton , and the blue lines represent any of sm fields . here",
    "the blue lines have included quantum corrections with possible late - time divergences resummed . in this paper",
    "we will focus on the blue lines and leave the full study of this 3-point function to the next paper .    before entering the details of 1-loop calculation , we shall firstly review briefly the issue of late - time divergence in ds in sec.[sec2 ] . then we set up the formalism and fix the notations for our calculation in sec.[sec3 ] .",
    "the explicit calculation of all 1-loop corrected in - in propagators is presented in sec.[sec4 ] . in sec.[sec5 ] we perform the resummation of late - time divergence of 1-loop propagators using dynamical renormalization group method .",
    "further discussions about the current and future works are presented in sec.[sec6 ] .",
    "readers not interested in details of calculation can skip sec.[sec4 ] and go directly to sec.[sec5 ] for a summary of our results .",
    "the ir and late - time divergences of loop corrections in ds are well known and extensively studied . however , to the best of our knowledge",
    ", no common consensus is reached on a complete physical interpretation of them . in simple cases such as @xmath7 theory with minimally coupled massless scalar field @xmath8 in ds , we do have various hints that the late - time divergences may be viewed as a signal of mass generation for the massless field @xmath8 . however",
    "even this result may not be conclusive , and in more general situations , one can even find conflicting statements in the vast literature about this problem .    at first sight , the theoretical uncertainties in our understanding of late - time divergences may be an obstacle of phenomenological studies .",
    "but at the same time it also justifies the importance of such studies because one may hope to shed light on these theoretical issues by studying their potentially observable effects .",
    "given the robustness of our understanding of sm physics , and the fast development of cosmological observation , we think it may be a good time to tackle this issue from phenomenological perspective .    before making the first step toward this goal , in the current section",
    "we try to summarize what we know about the loop corrections and their late - time divergences in ds .",
    "we do nt aim at a complete review of this issue , but only point out several known results relevant to our current study .",
    "in the simplest case of a minimally coupled massless scalar field with @xmath7 self - interaction in ds , it has long been known that the ir dynamics generates an effective mass @xmath9 for the scalar , with @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the hubble scale .",
    "this result can be found by simple estimation using hartree - fock approximation , or more rigorous stochastic approach @xcite , or through 1-loop resummation using dynamical renormalization group method @xcite ( see also @xcite for related diagrammatic calculations ) . on the other hand , in the euclidean version of ds , it was recognized that the 1-loop late - time divergence is from the improper treatment of scalar zero mode . in that case",
    "the zero mode partition function is simple enough to be solved exactly , and the result shows that the zero mode acquire an effective mass @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "this result can also be viewed as a supporting argument for massless scalar in ds because it was proved that the correlation functions calculated in euclidean ds ( namely a sphere ) and in the poincar patch of ds using in - in formalism are equivalent@xcite ( see however @xcite for different perspectives ) .",
    "the appearance of an effective mass for the classically massless scalar field due to ir dynamics is reminiscent of what happens in ordinary flat - space thermal field theory , in which case the ir dynamics of massless @xmath7 theory will also introduce an effective mass @xmath12 to the zero mode of @xmath8 ( see , e.g. , @xcite )",
    ". meanwhile it is also known that an observer moving along timelike geodesic in ds would find bunch - davis vacuum to be a thermal state with temperature @xmath13 .",
    "so one may attempt to apply this result directly and conclude that the effective mass in ds s case is @xmath14 .",
    "but this is not correct . because the value of the frozen super - hubble fluctuations are determined by the competition between the random walk behavior and the classical roll - down behavior on its potential .",
    "the random walk behaves as @xmath15 and the classical slow roll equation of motion can be solved as @xmath16 .",
    "the balance takes place at @xmath17 , where @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "this is different from the flat - space thermal behavior where @xmath20 do not suffer from the ir raldom - walk type of growth .",
    "more fundamentally , the thermal nature of ordinary finite - temperature field theory in flat spacetime is quite different from ds .",
    "for instance , in former s case , the theory can be thought of as a wick - rotated euclidean space @xmath21 with imaginary time compactified to a circle of radius @xmath22 , and this manipulation breaks the isometry of spacetime ( lorentz transformation in particular ) . as a result , there is a preferred frame of reference , and initial observers moving relative to this frame will see the anisotropic thermal radiation due to doppler shift .",
    "however , in ds , if we try to use wick rotation to study its thermal nature , then the wick - rotated space is the sphere @xmath23 , and the thermal state ( bunch - davis ) in this case does nt break any of isometry of ds .",
    "this implies in particular that the bunch - davis vacuum appears to have the same temperature to observers moving along any timelike geodesic in ds .",
    "now , the effective mass generated for @xmath8 in both cases are from zero modes , and it is obvious that the zero modes in @xmath21 and in @xmath23 are quite different , so it is conceivable that they contribute to effective mass differently .",
    "in fact the thermal nature as well as ir problem of ds is much more obscure , partly because we are not sure whether it is correct to use the wick - rotated sphere to understand all puzzles associated with late - time divergences . indeed , in direct calculation using real time schwinger - keldysh formalism @xcite , the late - time divergences of a field theory may or may not be interpreted as the signal of mass generation . in some cases",
    "as we shall show in this paper , the 1-loop divergences can not even be subtracted by local counterterms , and do not resemble an effective mass term at all .",
    "but on the other hand , in @xmath23 there can not be late - time divergences at all because the space itself is bounded and the radius of the sphere provides a natural ir cutoff to the calculation .",
    "the prove of equivalence between correlation functions on sphere and in the poincar patch in @xcite seems to apply only to massive scalar fields , and it is less clear if we can trust this equivalence for classically massless scalar field .",
    "furthermore , as argued in @xcite , the finite temperature of bunch - davis vacuum as derived by performing wick rotation to sphere actually describes the situation that all thermal radiation emitted out of horizon is somehow artificially reflected back , and thus can not capture the instability due to the particle production , nor the late - time divergences generated by loop modes outside the horizon .",
    "this is much like the fact that the euclidean version of rindler space can not capture the evaporation of schwarzschild black hole in asymptotically flat spacetime , and an artificially introduced thermal bath is needed to maintain the thermal equilibrium .    beyond the simplest @xmath7 theory ,",
    "the situation is even more unclear .",
    "for instance , the 1-loop correction to scalar s two - point function from @xmath24 interaction is more nonlocal than a mass term , and so can not be interpreted as mass generation at all @xcite .",
    "there are also studies of 1-loop correction to fields with spin other than 0 .",
    "relevant to our interest are the cases of fermions and vector bosons interacting with massless scalar field through yukawa and gauge couplings , respectively .    for massless fermions , the dirac mass term is forbidden by chiral symmetry , therefore even if the ir correction will generate some mass - like terms for massless fermion , these terms can not be dirac mass .",
    "this simple argument was confirmed by explicit calculation @xcite , and it was found there that the fermion indeed acquire a nonlocal mass - like term in its effective action from 1-loop correction of scalar field .    for vector boson ,",
    "naively the mass term is forbidden by gauge symmetry .",
    "however the true story is more complicated . in flat - space thermal field theory ,",
    "it is well known that the temporal component of photon can acquire a nonzero thermal mass which is responsible for debye screening .",
    "this mass term is consistent with gauge invariance because the finite temperature breaks the lorentz symmetry as mentioned above . as a result",
    ", the ward identity will naturally admit the temporal component of gauge field to develop a nonzero mass ( i.e. the so - called electric mass ) , while the mass of spatial components ( so - called magnetic mass ) is still forbidden .",
    "but the bunch - davis vacuum respects all isometries of ds , so the mass term for gauge field is still forbidden .",
    "this fact can also be understood with the picture of wick - rotated space . in flat - space s case",
    "@xmath21 , we do have a nontrivial gauge invariant for flat gauge field ( by flat gauge field we mean the corresponding field strength is zero ) , which is the nontrivial gauge - invariant wilson loop @xmath25 surrounding the compact imaginary time direction .",
    "therefore a gauge - invariant mass for @xmath26 can indeed be generated after kaluza - klein reduction .",
    "on the other hand , the euclidean version of ds ( namely @xmath23 ) is simply connected , so any gauge - invariant wilson loop is trivial , and therefore the photon mass is still forbidden by gauge symmetry in ds , even there appears to be a nonzero temperature in bunch - davis vacuum .",
    "we can also understand this result using a less rigorous but very intuitive picture , in which we can think of the mass of photon in ordinary thermal field being generated by constant `` kicks '' of thermal particles as the photon travel through the thermal background . on the other hand",
    ", the bunch - davis vacuum can be viewed as a true vacuum without any thermal excitation by an lightlike geodesic observer ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , so the photon in bunch - davis vacuum wo nt experience the `` thermal kicks '' and thus will not receive corresponding thermal mass .    a possible photon mass generated from a massless scalar field in scalar qed was previously estimated to be @xmath27 using hartree - fock approximation @xcite .",
    "such ir dynamics in scalar qed was then studied in great details @xcite , and it was found that the 1-loop correction from massless scalar field to photon s self - energy looks like a mass contribution",
    ". however it would be premature to interpret this result as a genuine photon mass because the mass obtained in @xcite is wave - number dependent while the genuine massive vector field can not have wave - number dependent mass .",
    "actually the 1-loop self - energy obtained in @xcite is nonlocal ( conceivable in ds ) .",
    "so this result does not contradict the argument in last paragraph .",
    "all results mentioned above considered loop corrections from a minimally coupled massless scalar field . as we will show below",
    ", this is the only possibility for the generation of late - time divergences .",
    "massless fermions and massless gauge bosons can not contribute such ir divergent loops essentially because their kinetic action as well as interactions are classically weyl invariant .",
    "this can be understood by direct power counting of scale factor @xmath28 , as will be elaborated in sec.[sec4 ] .",
    "phenomenologically , we are interested in the inflationary fluctuations instead of pure ds background . for the inflationary background , there are in general two kinds of fields , the curvature field and the iso - curvature fields . the fields that we mentioned above and we will be interested in this paper are the iso - curvature fields , namely some spectator fields in the inflation background . on the other hand , the inflaton field , which rolls down the inflationary potential and drive inflation , breaks the ds symmetry and its fluctuation",
    "behave differently from the above ds space results .",
    "this curvature perturbation ( if not interacting with iso - curvature perturbations ) is conserved on super - hubble scales for attractor single field inflation models even when self - coupling is taken into account .",
    "this can be understood from the separate universe picture @xcite , operator product expansion and goldstone theorem @xcite or explicit calculations @xcite .",
    "given the complication discussed in this section , we shall adopt in this paper a more practical approach , by simply calculating the 1-loop divergences with real time schwinger - keldysh formalism , without running into the complication of wick rotation .",
    "we shall also resum the possible late - time divergences using dynamical renormalization group method .",
    "when the results resemble mass correction , we shall interpret them accordingly , otherwise we shall just leave them as they are . in any case , these results can be directly applied to the realistic sm fields , so that their imprints on primordial non - gaussianities can be readily worked out .",
    "the task of the current paper is to calculate the quantum corrections to in - in propagator of massless field with spin-0 , 1/2 , or 1 in ds background . here and",
    "in the following by ds we always mean its poincar patch , parametrized by the conformal coordinates @xmath29 with metric @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the scale factor , and by in - in propagator we mean the expectation value , |(,k)(,k)| , where @xmath8 is an arbitrary field we are interested in , @xmath32 is the fourier transform variable of @xmath33-dimensional flat coordinates @xmath34 , and @xmath35 is the in - vacuum , which we will take to be bunch - davis vacuum .",
    "it is convenient to use the diagrammatic approach to compute loop corrections to the in - in propagator . to this end",
    "we use the schwinger - keldysh formalism @xcite , in which the numbers of fields are doubled in order to take account of the closed time path in the in - in formalism . then the in - in expectation values can be found by taking functional derivatives of the following generating functional @xmath36 $ ] : e^w[j_+,j_-]=_f(_f)_-e^-s[_-]-^4xj_-(x)_-(x)_+e^s[_+]+^4xj_+(x)_+(x ) , where @xmath37 and @xmath38 are classical sources associated with @xmath39 and @xmath40 , respectively",
    ", @xmath41 is any time to the future of all times we are interested , and @xmath42 is the field evaluated at @xmath41 .",
    "the form of this generating functional is easy to understand : the @xmath39 and @xmath40 integral represent the generating functionals of ordinary in - out amplitudes and their conjugates , respectively , and the additional integral over @xmath42 is simply to sum over the artificially introduced out states , making use of the completeness condition on cauchy surface at @xmath41 .",
    "therefore the above generating functional should be subject to additional boundary condition @xmath43    then we also have four types of propagators : g_ab(x , y)=e^w[j_+,j_-]|_j_+=j_-=0 , where @xmath44 represent either @xmath45 or @xmath46",
    ". then it can be readily derived for scalar field @xmath8 that ,    g_++(x , y ) & g_+-(x , y ) + g_-+(x , y ) & g_(x , y )    =    ( x)(y ) & ( y)(x ) + ( x)(y ) & 2mu 2mu(x)(y )    , where in the expectation values t means time - ordered product and @xmath47 means anti - time ordered product .",

    "one complication here is that the usual lorentz gauge fixing term with arbitrary gauge parameter @xmath96 is not weyl invariant , s_gf()=-^4x(g^_a_)^2 , which introduces additional @xmath97-dependent terms in to the classical action .",

    "we still choose the gauge @xmath100 , then the field equation for temporal component @xmath26 remains the same , while the equation for spatial component @xmath113 has new terms , @xmath114 finally we consider a massive photon in @xmath115d ds , with the following bare mass term in the action , s_v(m)=-m^2 ^ 4xg^a_a_. then in @xmath100 gauge , the equation of motion becomes , ^2",

    "in this section we are going to calculate 1-loop corrections to 2-point function of a real scalar , a dirac spinor , and a photon field , respectively . for simplicity , we assume the following interactions for the real scalar field @xmath8 and the dirac spinor @xmath64 , [ sint ] s_=^d+1 x , where we have introduced a mass scale @xmath117 so that the scalar self - coupling @xmath105 and yukawa coupling @xmath118 remain dimensionless . on the other hand , in order to couple the scalar field to the photon , we identify @xmath8 to be the real part of a complex scalar field @xmath119 , i.e. , @xmath120 , then the usual gauge interactions can be readily extracted from the kinetic terms , [ sk ] s_=^d+1x , where @xmath121 is the usual gauge covariant derivative , and @xmath122 is covariant derivative associated with both gauge transformation and local lorentz transformation . in addition , if the gauge group is non - abelian , we still have gauge self - interaction , but this is irrelevant to our study as it can not generate any late - time divergence .    before getting into the technical part of loop computations , we would like to comment here some general properties of loop correction that can be inferred from the result of last section .",
    "we have seen that among massless spin-@xmath123 fields , the scalar is special in that the minimally coupled scalar field is not weyl invariant , and thus its mode function in ds background deviates significantly from the flat space result . on the contrary",
    ", both the massless spin-1/2 and massless spin-1 fields have weyl invariant kinetic term , which thus means that their mode function as well as the propagator in ds can be directly got from the flat space result by simple rescaling .",
    "the above observation can be put in a more physical way , that is , the scalar field is more sensitive to the exponential expansion of the universe that spinor and vector field . as a result",
    ", its propagator will get stretched at large distances . in field",
    "theory we are familiar with the fact that whenever the propagator fails to die away fast enough at large distance , late - time divergence could appear , and in many situation , such late - time divergence can be resummed and contribute a nonzero mass term .",
    "a well - known example of this kind is the scalar qed in @xmath124d . in this case , the massless scalar propagator behaves like @xmath125 , and it does generate a nonzero mass for the photon . in the following we are going to show that spinor and photon loops do nt contribute late - time divergences , and all such divergences in ds are from the massless scalar field running in the loop .",
    "however , they can not always be interpreted as a signal of mass generation .    on the other hand , for processes involving fermions and photons only , there can not be late - time divergence , and this fact can be most directly seen by counting the power of scalar factor @xmath28 .",
    "in fact , the generic late - time divergence arises due to the presence of factor @xmath126 in the interaction vertex . in this case",
    "the integral in the in - in calculation @xmath127 will generically be divergent , unless there are enough positive powers of @xmath128 , or equivalently , enough negative powers of @xmath28 , to cancel the @xmath129 factor in the denominator .",
    "for instance , the scalar self - interaction , namely the first term of ( [ sint ] ) has nothing to cancel the prefactor @xmath130 and thus the corresponding @xmath97-integral is badly divergent as @xmath131 .    on the contrary",
    ", the fermion interacts with photon through standard gauge coupling , which is derived from the last two terms of ( [ sk ] ) and reads @xmath132 .",
    "now we have one factor of @xmath133 coming from @xmath134 and additional 3 factors of @xmath135 from fermion rescaling @xmath136 , so that the prefactor @xmath137 is precisely canceled , and therefore the fermion gauge interaction is free from late - time divergence .",
    "similar counting applies for self - coupling of gauge boson when the gauge group is non - abelian .",
    "we would also like to make a technical remark on the structure of late - time divergence of 1-loop diagrams and to explain our strategy of evaluating them .",
    "all 1-loop diagrams in our calculation can be classified into 2 sets . in the first set ,",
    "the loop is attached to 1 vertex only , like the diagrams in fig.[fig_phi4loop ] .",
    "the other set consists of diagrams in which the loop is attached to 2 vertices , like the diagrams in fig.[fig_scalarfermionloop ] . in the former case ,",
    "the loop is simply given by @xmath138 .",
    "since the green function @xmath139 depends only on the ds invariant distance , the loop factor @xmath138 is ds invariant . on the other hand",
    ", it contains the usual ultraviolet ( uv ) divergences which is to be removed by corresponding local counterterm .",
    "therefore , such loop factor can not generate late - time divergences . in the following calculation",
    ", this loop factor can be regarded as a mass insertion , and the associated late - time divergence is actually from the improper perturbative expansion treating the mass term as an interaction , as has long been noticed @xcite .",
    "so the resummation of such divergences will naturally lead to an effective mass the the field being considered .",
    "then it is easy to see that the coefficient of the late - time divergence is related to the uv divergences of the loop factor .",
    "therefore , we use the standard dimensional regularization for such loop diagrams .    on the other hand , in the second set of diagrams ,",
    "the loop factor is proportional to @xmath140 , and the distance between @xmath141 can in principle be arbitrary . in particular , when the loop modes become very soft at late times , they can generate additional late - time divergences which are more divergent than perturbative expansion of mass term , and these divergences have nothing to do with uv divergences . therefore , we can actually get the leading late - time divergence without worrying about uv and renormalization .",
    "so for these diagrams , we can evaluate the leading late - time divergences by cut off the momentum integral at some particular scale without invoking dimensional regularization .",
    "a natural cut - off would be the external momentum of the 2-point function , and as we shall see below , the coefficient of leading late - time divergence is sensitive only to zero loop momentum limit , and thus is independent of the choice of this `` uv '' cut - off .        in the unbroken phase of electroweak symmetry in sm , the higgs field only has quartic self - interaction , which can thus be well modeled by @xmath7 theory of a real scalar .",
    "now we calculate the 1-loop correction from this @xmath142 interaction to the two point function @xmath143 , namely the propagator @xmath144 defined in last section . in schwinger - keldysh double field formalism , there are two diagrams contributing to this process , shown in fig.[fig_phi4loop ] .        in these diagrams ,",
    "we use grey dots and black dots to represent @xmath46 and @xmath45 type vertices , respectively .",
    "an advantage of this diagrammatic representation is that we can easily find the complex conjugate of a diagram by turning black dots into grey and grey dots into black .",
    "when the two external vertices are taken to be at the same time , the sum of all possible diagrams is manifestly real . in this case",
    ", only internal vertices needs to be switched to get the complex conjugate of a single diagram .",
    "( however , additional care must be taken when applying this rule to diagrams containing fermions . )",
    "the @xmath142 vertex of plus type with @xmath33 spatial dimensions is given by ( [ sint ] ) , and the corresponding feynman rule is , -^d+1x^4  - ^3-d=- , while the minus type has an additional minus sign .",
    "the introduction of a scale @xmath117 is to make the coupling @xmath105 dimensionless in @xmath145 spatial dimensions .",
    "it is straightforward then to calculate these two diagrams as , @xmath146,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the minus sign on the left hand side is from the grey dot associated with one external vertex , the @xmath147 factor is from our normalization convention of green function , and the factor @xmath148 on the right hand side comes from combinatorics of internal line . for simplicity but without loss of generality we can set @xmath149 . the loop momentum integral in above expression is regulated to be finite in the uv , but is still divergent in the ir . to deal with late - time divergence",
    ", we shall use massive mode functions @xmath150 for loop propagator , while for the external lines we still use massless mode functions ( [ mlsm ] ) in @xmath62 spatial dimensions spatial dimensions too , but the additional terms arising in this case are canceled precisely by the corresponding contribution from counterterm if one also put counterterm diagrams consistently in @xmath33 spatial dimensions .",
    "this remark also applies to the @xmath151-integral to be evaluated in the following . ] .",
    "then the above expression reduces to , @xmath152{\\nonumber}\\\\    & = { \\displaystyle\\frac{\\,{-\\lam\\mu^{3-d}h^4}\\,}{4k^6}}\\text{im}\\bigg[\\int_{-\\infty}^{0}{\\displaystyle\\frac{\\,{\\di\\tau'}\\,}{(h\\tau')^{d+1}}}(1-\\ii k\\tau')^2e^{2\\ii k\\tau'}\\int{\\displaystyle\\frac{\\,{\\di^dq}\\,}{(2\\pi)^d}}u(\\tau',\\mb q)u^*(\\tau',-\\mb q)\\bigg],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath153 and @xmath154 are given by ( [ msm ] ) .",

    "as we shall see , this is always true as long as the coupling is weak .    as expected",
    ", the loop momentum integral is @xmath151-independent due to de sitter invariance .",
    "now we expand this expression in the @xmath161 and @xmath162 limit , which gives , .    on the other hand , we can also put @xmath62 in the @xmath151-integral and carry it out as , _",

    ". then finally the sum of two diagrams from @xmath142 interaction is evaluated to , ( + + ) .",
    "the @xmath164 pole corresponds to the uv divergence , which we can subtract by introducing counterterms .",
    "let the counterterm in the lagrangian be , -_m^2(x ) , then its contribution to the two point function can be easily found to be , @xmath165{\\nonumber}\\\\    & \\to{\\displaystyle\\frac{\\,{\\de_m}\\,}{3k^3}}\\bigg[\\log(-2k\\tau)+\\ga_e-{\\displaystyle\\frac{\\,{7}\\,}{3}}\\bigg],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we have taken @xmath62 and @xmath166 in the second line .",
    "then it is easy to see that we can choose @xmath167 to eliminate the divergent terms coming from loop diagrams .",
    "this result is similar to the corresponding flat - space one , namely the 1-loop contribution from @xmath142 theory only contributes to mass renormalization but not to wave function renormalization .",
    "the difference is that the mass renormalization in flat space is proportional to the mass of the scalar field itself , and vanishes when the loop scalar is massless .",
    "but in our case , the counterterm does not vanish even for massless scalar due to the presence of another mass scale , namely the hubble parameter of the background spacetime .    then after subtracting the @xmath168-pole by counterterm",
    ", we reach the following final result , [ sca1l ] -_2mu 2mu_-+(k,,)|_^4=(+ ) .",
    "the loop mass @xmath55 here acts as an effective ir cutoff .",
    "it is instructive to calculate the loop momentum integral using sharp cutoff regularization by introducing both uv cutoff @xmath169 ( which transfers to the renormalization scale @xmath117 after renormalization ) and ir cutoff @xmath170",
    ". then the loop integral reads , @xmath171 where in the first equality we have thrown the @xmath172 term because 1 ) this term is regulated to a term quadratic in @xmath169 and thus can be totally subtracted away by choosing counterterm properly and 2 ) this term is proportional to @xmath173 and thus is more convergent as @xmath174 .",
    "then in the second `` equality '' we have done the renormalization and transfer the uv cutoff @xmath169 to the renormalization scale @xmath117 .",
    "it is important to note that the cutoffs we introduced are for comoving momentum @xmath175 and thus are comoving scales too . on the other hand",
    "the renormalization scale @xmath117 should be a physical scale . here by physical",
    "we do nt mean physically observable , but only that it is defined with respect to local proper distance rather than comoving distance .",
    "therefore , the correct ratio in the last expression should contain an additional scale factor @xmath28 . now note that @xmath176 , so we can compare the above expression with the result from dimensional regularization with finite mass @xmath55 , and find the following correspondence , [ lirm ]",
    "-(-)=. this relation between the comoving ir cutoff @xmath170 and the scalar mass @xmath55 will be useful in the following , where we shall use it to convert @xmath170 to @xmath55 without doing computation with massive loop fields .          in this subsection",

    "now we consider the fermion 2-point function .",
    "there are two types of contribution at 1-loop order , with scalar loop via yukawa interaction , and photon loop via gauge interaction , respectively . without explicit calculation",
    ", we can already know that photon loop can not generate mass to the fermion , as explained at the beginning of this section .",
    "so in current subsection , we only need to consider the scalar loop , as shown in fig.[fig_fermionscalarloop ] .",
    "these four diagrams can be collectively expressed as , @xmath204 this is our first example of loop correction to fermions , so we show more details .",
    "firstly the upper - left diagram of fig.[fig_fermionscalarloop ] reads , @xmath205 where we used @xmath206 , and we have taken @xmath207 .",
    "then the upper - right diagram of fig.[fig_fermionscalarloop ] is , -2mu 2mu|(1-q)e^+(q+p+k)|^2 .",
    "sum the two diagrams together , we get , -k|(1-q)e^+(q+p+k)|^2 .",
    "now so long as we are concerned with the late - time divergence , we can expand the integrand of @xmath151-integral as , ( 1-q)e^(q+p+k)=1+(p+k)+(^2 ) , so that all neglected @xmath208 contribute no divergent terms as the late - time cutoff @xmath97 is sent to zero . on the other hand , we should note that the condition @xmath188 that we have assumed in doing expansion is not valid for all @xmath209 .",
    "in particular , the integral is divergent as @xmath210 when we use the expanded integrand .",
    "therefore we should cut off the time integral at some early moment @xmath190 . for our purpose",
    "it is natural to choose @xmath190 to be the moment of horizon exit of mode @xmath175 .",
    "meanwhile , we also note that the loop momenta @xmath211 would satisfy @xmath212 for all @xmath213 only when @xmath214 .",
    "correspondingly , we should also impose a uv cutoff for the momentum integral at the scale of @xmath175 .",
    "the physical interpretation of our prescription for the range of integration is that we are considering the quantum correction from the modes outside the horizon at late times . at the same time",
    "we also need to introduce the ir cutoff @xmath170 to eliminate the late - time divergence and @xmath151 is very small , the condition @xmath215 can still be satisfied , and the integral of this parameter region may also lead to some late - time divergence .",
    "however , as will be clear in the following , the late - time divergence from this region is only sub - leading , compared with the contribution from @xmath216 , because in the latter case there will be additional @xmath217 term which will give another factor of @xmath218 .",
    "since we are only concerned with leading divergence in this paper , we are allowed to ignore this parameter region in the loop integral . ] .",
    "now with above points clarified now we can carry out the time integral to be , |_-1/k^(1+(p+k))|^2 ^ 2(-k)+(^0 ) .",
    "then we can finish the momentum integral , @xmath219=-{\\displaystyle\\frac{\\,{2k}\\,}{(2\\pi)^2}}\\log{\\displaystyle\\frac{\\,{k}\\,}{\\lir}}+{\\mathcal{o}({\\lir^0})}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here in the first line we have set the upper limit of the integral to @xmath220 to eliminate the late - time divergence from @xmath221 , and in the last equality we have done the expansion around @xmath222 . now using the relation ( [ lirm ] )",
    "we got earlier , we reach the following result , @xmath223\\log^2(-k\\tau).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    now let s consider the lower - left diagram of fig.[fig_fermionscalarloop ] , @xmath224{\\nonumber}\\\\ & ~\\times\\int{\\displaystyle\\frac{\\,{\\di \\tau'}\\,}{\\tau'}}\\int^{\\tau'}{\\displaystyle\\frac{\\,{\\di \\tau''}\\,}{\\tau''}}(1+\\ii q\\tau'')(1-\\ii q\\tau')e^{-\\ii ( q+p)(\\tau''-\\tau')-\\ii k(\\tau''+\\tau')}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] similarly , the lower - right diagram of fig.[fig_fermionscalarloop ] gives , @xmath225{\\nonumber}\\\\ & ~\\times\\int{\\displaystyle\\frac{\\,{\\di \\tau'}\\,}{\\tau'}}\\int^{\\tau'}{\\displaystyle\\frac{\\,{\\di \\tau''}\\,}{\\tau''}}(1+\\ii q\\tau')(1-\\ii q\\tau'')e^{-\\ii ( q+p)(\\tau'-\\tau'')+\\ii k(\\tau''+\\tau')}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] but one can readily show that the gamma matrices products in above expressions vanish .",
    "for instance , in the lower - left diagram of fig.[fig_fermionscalarloop ] we have , @xmath226 then , as long as @xmath227 is a variable to be integrated over , we are allowed to make the substitution @xmath228 . to simplify the expression further , we can assume without loss of generality that @xmath229 is in @xmath230 direction , so we have @xmath231)$ ] . then it is clear that ( [ gammafactor1 ] ) vanishes , and so does the factor in the lower - right diagram of fig.[fig_fermionscalarloop ] .",
    "so we conclude that the 1-loop correction for massless scalar field to the dirac fermion in the late - time limit is given by ( [ feryuloop12 ] ) , that is , [ fer1l ] -_2mu 2mu^(f)_-+(k,,)=-k^2(-k ) .      just like photon loop can not contribute late - time divergence to fermion s propagator , fermion loop wo nt generate late - time divergence for photon propagator either , as a consequence of simple power counting of conformal time variable .",
    "therefore we only need to consider scalar loops , which come in two categories , corresponding to two interactions expanded from ( [ sk ] ) , s_-^4x .",
    "next we consider the 3-point interactions as shown in fig.[fig_photonscalarloop2 ] .",
    "once again , it is important to distinguish the @xmath235-propagator and @xmath236-propagator , because the time and spatial derivative of loop scalar modes have very different forms . for @xmath235-propagator to which the time derivative mode @xmath237 contribute , the diagrams can not generate late - time divergences , as can be seen by simple counting ( see section [ subsecscavecloop ] ) .",
    "so we only need to consider the spatial components of the propagator , the leading divergence of the four diagrams can be directly summed as , @xmath238_{ij}&(\\mb k,\\tau,\\tau)\\big|_{\\text{scalar,3p}}=-{\\displaystyle\\frac{\\,{e^2}\\,}{4k^2}}\\int{\\displaystyle\\frac{\\,{\\di^{3}p}\\,}{(2\\pi)^3}}{\\displaystyle\\frac{\\,{1}\\,}{2q^3}}{\\displaystyle\\frac{\\,{1}\\,}{2p^3}}(p_i - q_i)(p_j - q_j)\\times2\\mathcal{i}_v^{(s)}(k , p;\\tau),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the @xmath97-integral is given by @xmath239.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] then we can carry out the integral @xmath240 with the late - time cutoff @xmath131 .",
    "the result is divergent as @xmath241 . to identify these divergences",
    ", we can expand the integrand of @xmath242 as follows , @xmath243 then the integral @xmath240 reads , @xmath244 it should be noted that the condition @xmath188 is not satisfied for any @xmath245 and any @xmath246 . in particular , the @xmath151-integral is divergent as @xmath189 when we do expansion as above",
    ". therefore we have to cut off this integral at some early time @xmath190",
    ". then the above result corresponds to choosing this early - time cutoff @xmath190 to be the time of horizon exit for mode @xmath175 .",
    "meanwhile , the condition @xmath247 and @xmath248 can be satisfied only when @xmath214 .",
    "so in the momentum integral , we also need to introduce a uv cutoff for the loop momentum around @xmath175 .",
    "now we insert this result back into the momentum integral , and define a new integration variable @xmath249 , so that @xmath250 and @xmath251 . in this way ,",
    "the momentum integral can be rewritten as , @xmath252.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the integral is divergent as @xmath253 , or equivalently when @xmath254 , and this divergence is removed by the comoving ir cutoff @xmath170 , so we integrate @xmath227 from @xmath255 to @xmath220 .",
    "now we are ready to carry out the momentum integral , and the final result for the sum of the four diagrams is , @xmath256_{ij}(\\mb k,\\tau,\\tau)\\big|_{\\text{scalar,3p}}{\\nonumber}\\\\ = & ~{\\displaystyle\\frac{\\,{e^2}\\,}{24(2\\pi)^2k}}\\eta_{ij}\\big[\\log\\big({\\displaystyle\\frac{\\,{k}\\,}{\\lir}}\\big)\\log^2(-k\\tau)+{\\displaystyle\\frac{\\,{3\\pi-10}\\,}{4}}\\log(-k\\tau)\\big]{\\nonumber}\\\\ = & ~{\\displaystyle\\frac{\\,{e^2}\\,}{24(2\\pi)^2k}}\\eta_{ij}\\big[\\log^3(-k\\tau)+{\\displaystyle\\frac{\\,{3h^2}\\,}{2m^2}}\\log^2(-k\\tau)+{\\displaystyle\\frac{\\,{3\\pi-10}\\,}{4}}\\log(-k\\tau)\\big],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we have used the relation ( [ lirm ] ) in the last line .",
    "in the previous section we calculate the 1-loop corrected in - in propagators of massless scalar , spinor , and vector fields , respectively , to the leading order in late - time divergences .",
    "now we summarize these results here .",
    "firstly , for a scalar field with @xmath7 self - interaction , the tree level @xmath257 propagator plus 1-loop correction can be got from ( [ scampp ] ) and ( [ sca1l ] ) as , -(1+_)2mu 2mu_-+(k,,)= , where we have set the renormalization scale @xmath258 .",
    "next , the 1-loop corrected propagator of massless dirac spinor from a massless scalar loop via yukawa interaction is the sum of ( [ fermpp ] ) and ( [ fer1l ] ) and is given by , -(1+_)2mu 2mu^(f)_-+(k,,)= , finally the 1-loop corrected propagator of the photon from a complex massless scalar field via gauge interaction is the sum of ( [ phompp ] ) , ( [ pho1l4 ] ) , and ( [ pho1l3 ] ) , and the result is , -(1+_)_(k,,)=_+^3(-k)2mu 2mu _ , where @xmath259 is the spatial part of flat metric . in all expressions",
    "we only keep the leading divergent terms in late - time cutoff @xmath97 .",
    "it is clear that all three types of propagators exhibit late - time divergence once 1-loop corrections are included .",
    "however , at least in @xmath260 theory of scalar fields , we are quite sure that the late - time divergences presented above at 1-loop level is an artefact of perturbative expansion .",
    "as we go to higher order corrections in loop expansion , the degree of late - time divergence , i.e. the power of logarithmic term @xmath261 , also increases .",
    "therefore one can imagine that the final result of 2-point function would be convergent as @xmath131 if we can properly resum the late - time divergent diagrams to all orders in loop expansion .",
    "this can be demonstrated exactly in the large-@xmath262 limit , while for more general cases ( including the @xmath7 theory of a single real scalar considered here ) we can only partially resum the higher order terms .",
    "the result of this partial resummation is also convergent as @xmath131 , but it may possess some @xmath5 uncertainty as can be recognized by comparing results from different approaches .    with above point clarified , we will now resum the divergences using dynamical renormalization group ( drg ) method .",
    "the basic idea of drg is to recognize that the large logs in late time limit is an artefact of perturbation expansion , much like the large logs of scattering energy in loop - corrected scattering amplitude when we extrapolate the loop correction calculated at a given scale to another very different energy scale .",
    "the standard way to deal with this problem is to absorb the energy dependence into the running coupling , which is known as the renormalization group ( rg ) resummation .",
    "the resummed result can then be applied to a much wider range of energies , as long as the couplings remain small .",
    "the drg is simply to repeat the same manipulation of rg resummation , replacing large logs of energies by large logs of late times .",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite for a more thorough introduction of drg method , and here we only point out that for our case , the resummation via drg is simply to identify the tree - level and 1-loop correction as the first two terms of taylor expansion of the exponential function .",
    "so the resummation goes like @xmath263 .",
    "the drg method is conceptually clear and plausible , however , it is not straightforward to understand its proposal diagrammatically , i.e. the resummation via exponentiation . in particular , it is not evident that what loop diagrams are being summed in drg . to understand this point ,",
    "suppose that the 1-loop correction has the form of @xmath264 where @xmath265 is the tree - level result and @xmath266 is the @xmath97-dependent factor from 1-loop correction , then naively we may expect that the resummation is a geometric series , [ nresum ] g_0_n=0^f^n()=. to understand why this is not the case , let us consider a simplified example of mass insertion .",
    "the mass term @xmath267 of a real scalar belongs to the `` dangerous interaction '' in the sense that it would lead to late - time divergence once we insert a single mass vertex into the scalar propagator , as is clear from ( [ massct ] ) .",
    "however , this divergence is purely artefact of perturbative expansion , and after resumming all similar mass - insertions , we should be able to recover the divergent free massive propagator built from massive mode function ( [ msm ] ) .",
    "now , the naive resummation ( [ nresum ] ) can be diagrammatically represented as ,        but this is not the correct expression , because , for instantce , at the level of two mass insertions ,        in above expression , the left hand side is what we would infer from ( [ nresum ] ) , while the right hand side is the correct diagrams at two - mass - insertion level .",
    "now we are going to show that the resummation via exponentiation suggested by drg method actually corresponds to resumming all `` correct '' diagrams like the right hand side of above expression , i.e. , diagrams with all possible @xmath268 type mass insertions . to this end",
    ", we may calculate all mass - insertion diagrams directly and sum them up , but there is a much simpler way , due to the following useful formula , @xmath269 where @xmath270 denote two types of mass insertions and @xmath271 is the propagator for the scalar field of mass @xmath55 .",
    "the above formula is most easily proved in euclidean de sitter space , and we refer the readers to @xcite for details . here",
    "we apply ( [ massinssum ] ) to a massless scalar propagator and keep the leading divergence in @xmath97 only , then we have the following result , ( ) = ^n finally we sum over @xmath272 , and the exponentiation appears natually , ( -k)^2m^2/3h^2 .",
    "we recognize the above result as the @xmath273 limit of the full massive propagator ( [ msm ] ) .",
    "therefore , we have justified that the resummation via exponentiation in the case of mass insertion , and showed that the drg method gives the correct result .    for loop diagrams",
    "the situation is more complicated .",
    "however , at least for the `` mass - insertion - like '' diagrams like fig.[fig_phi4loop ] , it is now clear that the drg method can resum all such diagrams with all possible @xmath268 vertices , and generates an effective mass to the originally massless propagator as we shall show soon .",
    "here we only note that drg does not resum more complicated higher loop diagrams , such as sunset diagram at two - loop level , and it is interesting to study how these diagrams would modify the drg result . for our purpose , it suffices to note that these diagrams would be suppressed by @xmath274 in the large-@xmath262 limit where @xmath262 is the number of real scalar fields , and for sm higgs sector , @xmath275 , so drg result should be a good approximation .",
    "now we apply drg resummation to the three cases listed at the beginning of this section .",
    "firstly for scalar field we have , -2mu 2mu_-+(k,,)|_r=(-k)^h^2/2(2m)^2 . then the mass of the scalar field @xmath55 can be found by comparing the time dependence of the above expression and the propagator of a massive scalar field in the @xmath131 limit , which is given by @xmath276 , therefore we have , [ scamass ] m^2=. for dirac fermion we have , -2mu 2mu^(f)_-+(k,,)|_r=. here the @xmath277 term dominate in the @xmath278 limit . as a result , the resummed propogator does not contribute to a mass term for the fermions .",
    "qualitatively , we can understand this conclusion from the mean - field approach .",
    "the fermion mass is obtained through its yukawa coupling @xmath279 , which is linear in the higgs field @xmath8 .",
    "thus the mass correction is @xmath280 .    having that said , we should also note that ultimately we are interested in the physical observables , for example , the non - gaussianity of curvature perturbation induced by fermions .",
    "the fermions have to appear in pairs forming closed loops , should they not appear in external lines .",
    "those composite operators such as @xmath281 may obtain non - trivial anomalous dimensions coming from the ir growth of @xmath8 .",
    "we hope to address this issue in the future .",
    "finally for the photon , we need to resum the temporal and spatial components separately . for the temporal component we have , [ prsmt ] -_00(k,,)|_r=(-k)^6e^2h^2/(2m)^2_00 , and for the spatial components we have , [ prsms ] -_ij(k,,)|_r=(^3(-k))_ij . in expression above , ( [ prsmt ] ) has the form of photon mass contribution while ( [ prsms ] ) does not . as we can see from ( [ mpm ] ) , a massive photon s propagator behaves like @xmath282 , then comparing this with the above expression we get , m^2== , where the first equality agrees with the result in @xcite and in the second equality we have used ( [ scamass ] ) . note that in above expansion of massive photon mode function we have assumed that @xmath283 , thus the above expression holds only when @xmath284 .",
    "if @xmath285 , we should solve the full equation @xmath286 .",
    "in particular , if the right hand side of this equation is larger than 1 , there will be no real solution to @xmath2 , which means that even ( [ prsmt ] ) can not be interpreted as an effective mass .",
    "it is worth noting that the convergence of resummed propagators relies crucially on the sign of 1-loop correction .",
    "when the 1-loop correction to propagator diverges like @xmath287 with @xmath272 a positive and odd integer at the leading order in @xmath97 ( in our situation we always get @xmath288 or 3 ) , the coefficient of this logarithmical factor must be the same with tree - level propagator , so that when @xmath131 , the logarithmic factor goes to @xmath289 , and the resummed factor @xmath290 $ ] is convergent",
    ". were this not the case , the resummed propagator would be even more divergent than the pure 1-loop result .",
    "fortunately in our calculation , all 1-loop corrections have the correct sign to guarantee the convergence of resummation .",
    "we have calculated the one - loop corrections of the particle physics standard model fields during inflation .",
    "especially , we have calculated the ir scaling behavior of those fields , and such scaling behavior can be interpreted as some sort of mass spectrum for standard model fields during inflation .",
    "rich phenomenology can be derived from the inflationary mass spectrum of the particle physics standard model .",
    "especially , the self - coupling parameters of the standard model fields are much greater than that of the inflaton . in other words ,",
    "the fluctuation of the standard model sector is non - gaussian .",
    "the non - gaussianity of the standard model fields induces the non - gaussianity of the density fluctuation .",
    "this is because the inflaton has to be coupled to the standard model fields with a coupling stronger than gravitational , to allow efficient reheating .",
    "the framework to study such non - gaussianity of density fluctuations is quasi - single field inflation @xcite .",
    "we hope to study the relevant signatures in a future work @xcite .",
    "we have relied on the dynamical rg method to resum the diverging contributions and extract the mass correction .",
    "the dynamical rg method does not resum all diagrams , but only the reduciable ones .",
    "different approaches have been discussed in the literature by considering the leading logarithm contributions @xcite .",
    "it is not straightforward to extract the mass information from those leading logarithm approaches .",
    "however , it remains interesting to understand whether those approaches can improve the knowledge that we obtain from the dynamical rg .",
    "we also note that , once we extrapolate our result to the range @xmath291 for scalar and @xmath292 for vector , the loop correction can no longer be interpreted as a mass because the tree - level mass can now introduce non - analytic powers to the mode function , which are not observed in our calculation .",
    "we are currently not sure whether this is a fundamental feature of loop corrections , or due to the limitation of the perturbative approach and the resummation scheme .",
