    "the stellar mass is one of the most fundamental parameters characterising galaxies .",
    "this observable is driven by the light emitted in the rest - frame optical / near infrared ( nir ) by lower mass stars and it correlates with the dynamical mass up to @xmath20 ( e.g. , @xcite ) , suggesting that it can be a robust estimate of the cumulative content of matter in galaxies .",
    "stellar masses have been estimated for galaxies at redshifts as high as @xmath21 ( e.g. , @xcite ) . moreover , stellar mass estimates are readily available in the models of galaxy formation and evolution . for the above reasons , the stellar mass has been largely adopted in comparisons to the models .    the stellar mass function ( smf ) , i.e. , the number density of galaxies per unit ( log ) stellar mass , provides a first census of a galaxy population and it is therefore one of the most basic observables that need to be reproduced by any successful model of galaxy formation .",
    "multi - wavelength photometric surveys like ultravista @xcite and zfourge @xcite have enabled smf measurements up to @xmath22 ( e.g. , @xcite , but see also @xcite for smf of massive galaxies up to @xmath17 ) , whereas _ hst _ surveys , like candels ( @xcite ) , goods ( @xcite ) and hudf ( @xcite ) , complemented by _ spitzer_/irac observations ( e.g. ,",
    "spitzer / goods - pi dickinson ; @xcite ) , extended the study to the evolution of the smf up to @xmath17 ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "estimates of stellar mass , however , critically depend on quantities like the initial mass function ( imf ) , the dust content , the metallicity and the star - formation history ( sfh ) of each galaxy ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "indeed , different sets of sed models characterised by e.g. , a different treatment of the tp - agb phase , have been shown to potentially introduce systematics in stellar mass measurements as large as few decimal dex @xcite . similarly , different dust laws ( @xcite ) and star - formation histories ( sfhs ) can increase the systematics by up to @xmath23  dex ( @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , recently , emission from nebular lines has been found to potentially bias stellar mass measurements ( @xcite ) .",
    "stellar masses of high redshift galaxies ( @xmath24 ) are particularly sensitive to the contamination by nebular lines , since high - z star - forming galaxies are likely to be characterised by emission lines with equivalent width in excess of @xmath41000  ( see e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "nonetheless , attempts to correct for this contamination can lead to results differing by factors of a few ( e.g. , @xcite ) .    alternatively , one could directly study the rest - frame optical / nir light emitted by the low - mass stars in galaxies , given its connection to stellar mass .",
    "measurements of the optical / nir luminosity have at least three major advantages over measurements of the stellar mass : 1 ) they are much less sensitive to assumptions about dust modeling ; 2 ) estimates of luminosity are robust quantities , since luminosity can be recovered directly from the observed flux , with marginal - to - null dependence on the best - fitting sed templates , and hence on e.g. , sfh or the imf ; and 3 ) a careful choice of the rest - frame band reduces the contamination by nebular emission , minimizing the requirement of corrections to the fluxes ( for instance , nebular emission could contribute up to 50% of the rest - frame @xmath25-band luminosity for galaxies at @xmath6 - @xcite ) .",
    "the wavelength range spanned by the rest - frame @xmath26 and @xmath27 bands is most sensitive to the lower mass stars .",
    "light in bands redder than these is potentially contaminated by emission from the dust torus of agns , while light in bluer bands retains information about the recent sfh .",
    "the availability of data up to @xmath28 m from _ spitzer_/irac has enabled the study of the evolution of the lf in rest - frame nir bands ( @xmath29 ) up to @xmath16 ( e.g. , @xcite ) .    at higher redshifts ,",
    "the choice of the rest - frame band which more closely correlates with the stellar mass must be a trade - off between including contamination from the recent star - formation and performing the luminosity measurements on observational data rather than relying on the extrapolation of sed templates",
    ".    in this context , the @xmath3 band ( @xmath30 m ) emerges as a natural choice : it lays in the wavelength regime redder than the balmer/4000  break , it is free from contamination by strong nebular emission , and it can be probed up to @xmath6 thanks to the _",
    "spitzer_/irac @xmath8m - band data .",
    "recently , @xcite have assembled the first full - depth irac mosaics over the goods and udf fields , combining irac observations from the igoods ( pi : oesch ) and iudf ( pi : labb ) programs with all the available archival data over the two fields ( goods , ers , s - candels , seds and udf2 ) .",
    "following the same procedure implemented by @xcite , full - depth irac mosaics have now been generated also for the goods - n and cosmos / ultravista fields .",
    "the goods - n mosaics double the area with the deepest irac imaging available , while the cosmos / ultravista data , shallower but covering a much larger field , are necessary to include the most massive galaxies at @xmath16 .",
    "the unique depth of irac @xmath31 m and @xmath8 m mosaics in the goods fields ( pid 194 ; pi dickinson ) - reaching @xmath32  ab ( @xmath33 , 20 aperture diameter ) allowed us to recover flux measurements with s / n@xmath34 in these two bands for galaxies to @xmath21 .    in this work we leverage these characteristics to measure the evolution of the lf at @xmath19 in the rest - frame @xmath3 band , providing a complementary approach to the determination of the evolution of the smf at high redshift .",
    "furthermore , we will show that the smf can be recovered by applying a stellar mass - to - light ratio ( @xmath35 ) to the @xmath3-band lf .",
    "remarkably , a simple abundance matching reveals that the @xmath3-band lf can also trace the halo mass function ( hmf ) and its evolution over @xmath19 .",
    "our analysis is based on the photometric catalog of @xcite over the goods - n and goods - s fields .",
    "at @xmath16 we complement our sample with a 37-bands @xmath36-to-@xmath37 m photometric catalog based on the second release ( dr2 ) of the ultravista survey .",
    "the area covered by the dr2 data , @xmath38 degrees@xmath39 , is a factor of @xmath40 larger than the cumulative area from the two goods fields ( @xmath41arcmin@xmath39 ) , enabling the recovery of the bright end of the @xmath16 lf with higher statistical significance .",

    "the @xmath16 bin is complemented by a sample of galaxies from a catalog based on the ultravista dr2 mosaics . in the following sections we briefly describe these two parent catalogs and detail the criteria we adopted to assemble our final sample of galaxies .          for this work we adopted the catalog assembled by @xcite over the candels / goods - n , candels / goods - s and ers fields . here",
    "we briefly summarise the main features referring the reader to sect . 2 and 3 of @xcite for full details .",

    "similarly to what was done for the goods - n / s fields , full - depth mosaics were constructed following the procedure of @xcite .",
    "specifically full depth 3.6@xmath72 m and @xmath51 m mosaics were reconstructed combining data from the s - cosmos @xcite , s - candels @xcite and splash ( pi : capak , @xcite ) .",

    "fluxes in the four irac bands were measured using the template fitting procedure of @xcite , adopting the @xmath27 band as the high - resolution template image to deblend the irac photometry .",
    "photometric redshifts were computed using eazy @xcite on the 37 bands photometric catalog , complementing the standard eazy template set with a maximally red template sed , i.e. , an old ( 1.5  gyr ) and dusty ( @xmath77  mag ) sed template .",
    "we only considered objects whose fluxes were not contaminated by bright nearby stars , had extended morphology on the @xmath27 image , and less than five bands were excluded as the associated flux measurements were contaminated by ` nan ` values .",

    "the photometric redshift selection allowed us to consider objects which could have been missed by a pure lbg selection .",
    "the large area offered by the ultravista dr2 footprint enabled the selection of bright / luminous sources whose surface density would be too low to be probed over the goods - n / s fields area .",
    "such luminous systems could be intrinsically redder than normal lbgs either because they are more ( massive ) evolved systems and/or they contain a higher fraction of dust . on the other side , the lbg selection at fainter luminosities from the goods - n",

    "[ fig : absm_histogram],width=377 ]      the first step consisted in applying a cut in the @xmath27 flux of the galaxies from the ultravista sample , in order to control the detection completeness .",
    "the dr2 data is @xmath80  mag deeper than dr1 .",
    "therefore , we set the threshold to @xmath81  mag , corresponding to the 90% completeness in detection of point - sources @xcite .",
    "instead , we did not apply any cut in the detection band of the goods - n / s sample , as the method adopted to estimate the co - moving volumes already takes into account the incompleteness from the detection stage .",
    "successively , we excluded from our sample those galaxies with poor flux measurements in those irac bands used to compute the rest - frame @xmath3 luminosity . the variation in depth across each irac",
    "mosaic prevented us from applying a single value of flux threshold at this stage .",
    "instead , we applied a cut in s / n to the flux in the irac band closest to the rest - frame @xmath3 band ( i.e. , irac @xmath51 m at @xmath16 and irac @xmath31 m and @xmath8 m at @xmath52 ) .",
    "considering the gap in the photometric depth probed by the @xmath51 m mosaics compared to that reached by the @xmath82 m data , we opted for applying a distinct s / n cut depending on the considered redshift bin .",
    "the sample at @xmath16 was selected by applying the cut of @xmath83 to the @xmath51 m flux ; the samples at @xmath84 were assembled by considering the cumulative flux in the @xmath31 m and @xmath8 m bands as the inverse - variance weighted sum of the flux in these two bands .",
    "we then applied a cut to the corresponding s /",

    "the application of the s / n cut reduced the number of galaxies to 2644 ( 2040/604 for goods / ultravista , respectively ) , 96 , 17 and 4 at @xmath16 , @xmath91 , @xmath92 and @xmath17 , respectively .",
    "we further cleaned our sample , excluding those objects satisfying any of the following conditions : 1 ) the contribution to the @xmath31 m and @xmath8 m flux from neighbouring objects is excessively high ; 2 ) the source morphology is very uncertain or confused making irac photometry undetermined ; 3 ) the source is detected at x - rays wavelengths , suggesting it is a lower redshift agn ; 4 ) the source is at higher redshift , but its sed is dominated by agn light ; 5 ) lbgs with a likely @xmath93 solution from photometric redshift analysis . in appendix [ app :",
    "sel ] , we detail our application of these additional criteria in cleaning our sample .",
    "our final sample consists of 2098 galaxies at @xmath16 ( 1680 from the lbg sample and 418 from the ultravista sample ) , 72 at @xmath91 , 10 at @xmath92 and 2 objects at @xmath17 .",
    "the distribution of the absolute magnitudes in the @xmath3 band for the sample is presented in figure [ fig : absm_histogram ] , for the four different redshift bins .",

    ", we did not consider the effects of selection in the detection band because the ultravista sample is 90% or more complete in @xmath27 by construction , while the effects of detection completeness of the goods - n / s sample have been taken into account when estimating the co - moving volumes adopted for the lf measurements .",
    "at first we defined a grid in apparent magnitude of width 0.20  mag .",
    "given the small sizes of the galaxies compared to the irac psf , for each magnitude value in the grid , we injected 100 point sources randomly distributed across a region of uniform depth in the @xmath51 m , @xmath31 m and @xmath8 m mosaics of the goods",
    "- n field .",
    "we chose the goods - n as this field is characterised by the deeper _ spitzer_/irac @xmath51 m , @xmath31 m and @xmath8 m band data among the fields considered for this work .",
    "successively , we replicated the flux measurement using the same procedure adopted for the actual photometry .",
    "the completeness fraction in each magnitude bin was computed by comparing the number of objects satisfying our selection criteria ( section [ sect : sample_assembly ] ) to the number of objects initially injected into the simulation .",
    "for the completeness of the @xmath16 sample , the above process was applied to the @xmath51 m mosaic only . for the completeness of the samples at @xmath76",
    ", the point sources were added at matching positions in the @xmath31 m and @xmath8 m mosaics .",
    "the selection on the s / n and contamination was then recovered applying the corresponding criteria and assuming the sed to be flat in @xmath95 in the observed @xmath96 m region .",
    "this is a reasonable approximation since , as we show in section [ sect : ml_ratios ] , the median seds do not substantially deviate from a flat @xmath95 sed in the wavelength range covered by irac observations .",
    "the whole process was repeated @xmath97 in each band in order to increase its statistical significance . the global completeness ( i.e.",
    ", the cumulative effects of s / n and contamination selection ) at the different depths of the irac mosaics was obtained rescaling the completeness in s / n selection to match the depth of the relevant region .    the results from our completeness simulation for the @xmath51 m and the @xmath31m+@xmath8 m samples are presented in figure [ fig : completeness ] .",
    "first we discuss the recovery of the contamination fraction ; successively we consider these results in the budget of the gobal completeness estimates .",
    "the fraction of objects in the @xmath51 m band contaminated by neighbours is negligible for objects brighter than @xmath98  ab and increases exponentially up to @xmath99  ab , where it starts to flatten out . a similar behaviour is observed for the @xmath31m+@xmath8 m simulation , although shifted at brighter magnitudes , due to the shallower depth of the @xmath31 m and @xmath8 m compared to the @xmath51 m .",
    "the flattening at the faint end is caused by a strong incompleteness in the data at such faint magnitudes and likely does not reflect the true behaviour . in what follows and in our analysis we do not consider the completeness for magnitudes fainter than those corresponding to the onset of the flattening , i.e. , @xmath99  ab and @xmath100  ab for the @xmath51 m and @xmath31m+@xmath8 m data respectively .",
    "as it could intuitively be expected , the bright end of the global completeness curve is dominated by the ( small ) fraction of purged objects .",
    "this effect becomes less and less pronounced at fainter magnitudes , corresponding to lower s / n , where the effective selection is driven by the s / n itself .",
    "the random noise from the background can positively combine at the location of a given source , introducing an increase in the measured flux ( _ flux boosting _ , @xcite ) .",
    "the amount of this boost is inversely correlated to the s / n of the source . the flux for sources with very high s / n will mostly be the result of the photons emitted by the source itself , with reduced contribution from the background ; on the other hand , for sources with low s / n , the background level can be typically just few factors smaller than the intrinsic signal from the source , making it sensitive to ( positive ) fluctuations of the background .",
    "furthermore , sources do not uniformly distribute with flux , but rather follow a @xmath4 power - law , with fainter sources more numerous than brighter ones .",
    "therefore it is intrinsically more probable that fainter sources scatter to brighter fluxes than the reverse , giving origin to a net flux bias .    a second potential source of flux boosting comes from confusion noise : faint sources at apparent positions close to a brighter one are more likely to be blended into the brighter source , increasing the flux , and decreasing the number of fainter objects .",
    "this effect is larger for flux measurement in those bands with wide psf , like _ spitzer_/irac .",
    "however , in our case , the photometry in the irac bands was performed adopting a higher resolution morphological prior from _ hst _ mosaics ( see sect .",
    "[ sect : data_sets ] ) .",
    "furthermore , we applied a selection in flux contamination ( see sect .",
    "[ sect : sample_assembly ] ) .",
    "since these two factors drastically limit the potential contribution of confusion noise to the irac fluxes in our sample , we do not further consider its effects to the flux boosting budget .    for each source , we estimated the flux bias as the ratio between the expected intrinsic flux @xmath101 and the measured flux @xmath102 .",
    "since no direct measurement is possible , the intrinsic flux was recovered as the average flux obtained from an estimate of its probability distribution .",
    "this was constructed considering two distinct contributions : 1 ) the probability @xmath103 that the observed flux @xmath102 is drawn from the distribution of intrinsic flux @xmath101 , given the noise @xmath104 , and 2 ) the frequency @xmath105 of occurrence of the intrinsic flux @xmath101 . assuming each probability is normalized to 1",
    ", the final probability distribution would then be @xmath106 .    assuming a gaussian noise , @xmath103 can be written as : @xmath107 } , \\label{eq : gaussian}\\ ] ] normalized to a total probability of 1 .",
    "the frequency associated to the intrinsic flux can be recovered from the ( intrinsic ) differential number count of sources , @xmath108 .",
    "this can usually be described by a power - law form with negative index , thus divergent for @xmath109 , which prevents it from being normalized , the product between @xmath110 and @xmath111 does not diverge for @xmath109 . however , this is not anymore the case for lower s / n values , where the non - negligible probability of the low - flux tail from the gaussian distribution makes the divergent power - law dominate over the gaussian . ]",
    "( see e.g. , @xcite , who also discuss possible reasons for why the divergence at @xmath109 is likely non - physical ) .",
    "we therefore followed the formalism of @xcite , who introduced as further constraint the poissonian probability that no sources brighter than @xmath101 exist at the same location of the observed object .",
    "the expression for @xmath105 then becomes : @xmath112 where @xmath113 corresponds to the area occupied by the source . in the left panel of figure [ fig : flux_boost ]",
    "we show examples of reconstructed @xmath114 , for the cases of s / n=6 and s / n=3.8 , where it is evident the increasing contribution of the faint sources population to the expected intrinsic flux as the s / n decreases .",
    "the right panel of figure [ fig : flux_boost ] shows the expected flux boost as a function of s / n . for s / n@xmath115 ,",
    "the flux boost is roughly the same amount as the flux uncertainty .",
    "however , for lower s / n the estimated flux boost increases abruptly . for",
    "s / n@xmath116 the expected flux boost is @xmath117  mag , meaning that the recovery of the intrinsic flux for such low s / n data is highly uncertain .    the s / n in the _ hst _ bands for the galaxies in our sample is @xmath118 . at @xmath16",
    "the s / n in the @xmath51 m band , adopted for the selection of the @xmath16 sample , is @xmath119 by construction ; the s / n in the @xmath7 m band is @xmath119 as well , consistent with the nearly flat seds in that wavelength range . at @xmath76 ,",
    "the selection was performed in a combination of @xmath31 m and @xmath8 m fluxes , adopting a s / n@xmath120 threshold .",
    "figure [ fig : flux_boost ] shows that the expected flux boost for s / n@xmath121 is @xmath122  mag .",
    "however , for lower s / n , typical of the selection of samples at @xmath76 , the correction can be as high as @xmath123  mag .",

    ", the measurements of the low - mass end ( @xmath321 ) of the smf are characterised by a larger scatter than for @xmath322 . at higher stellar masses measurements",

    "the likely main reason for this large scatter is sample selection .",
    "in addition to this , further systematics may arise from our limited knowledge on some of the specific aspect characterising the stellar population of each galaxy , including contamination from emission lines ( see e.g. , @xcite ) .",

    "our analysis showed that smfs consistent with the average determinations from the literature could be recovered by applying a simple @xmath13 relation to the observed @xmath3-band lf , with stellar masses measured from common stellar population parameters ( e.g. , delayed exponential sfh , solar metallicity , chabrier imf ) .",
    "our simple transformation of the lf into smf was supported by the non - decreasing @xmath13 ratio for increasing luminosities observed at @xmath16 .",
    "a @xmath13 ratio decreasing with luminosity would correspond to lower mass galaxies in the bright end of the lf , which would _ remix _ the number densities in stellar mass bins .",
    "the ideal rest - frame band for this kind of studies is probably one for which the @xmath35 ratio would not depend on the luminosity , as any luminosity dependence could potentially hide effects from e.g. , sfh .",
    "our measurements of the @xmath13 relation suggest that , for a wide range in luminosity , they are consistent with a constant value .",
    "a log - linear relation arises at the bright- ( massive- ) end of the lf ( smf ) , suggesting that at these luminosities the @xmath3-band holds at some level the signature of the stellar population age and/or of the dust content .",

    "similarly , the ultravista catalog benefits from irac @xmath7 m and @xmath51 m mosaics which combine the s - cosmos , s - candels and splash programs and reach a depth of @xmath421  mag ( @xmath56 diameter aperture , @xmath33 ) .",
    "we further selected our sample based on the s / n in the irac band or bands closer to the rest - frame @xmath3 band .",
    "specifically , the final @xmath16 sample was selected to have @xmath83 in the @xmath51 m while the @xmath422 samples were selected to have @xmath423 in the inverse - variance weighted combination of s / n in the @xmath31 m and @xmath8 m bands .",
    "our final composite sample included 2098 , 72 , 10 and 2 objects , for the @xmath79 and 7 redshift bins , respectively .",
    "although the @xmath3 band is covered by the @xmath31 m and @xmath8 m irac data up to @xmath6 , we do not register any lbg galaxy at @xmath6 which also satisfies our selection criteria on the s / n of irac fluxes .",
    "our main results are as follows :    1 .   at @xmath16 and for absolute magnitudes @xmath9 fainter than @xmath424  ab",
    ", galaxies follow a linear relation on the @xmath140 plane , with slope @xmath425 .",
    "this correlation breaks at @xmath426  ab : the @xmath136 of these galaxies covers the full range of values observed for galaxies with fainter @xmath9 ( figure  [ fig : uvopt ] ) .",
    "we performed stacking analysis and measured the @xmath13 of galaxies segregated according to their redshift and absolute magnitude @xmath9 .",
    "the @xmath13 at @xmath16 is independent of @xmath9 for @xmath427 ; at brighter @xmath9 the @xmath13 increases with luminosity following a power - law .",
    "the @xmath13 at @xmath76 are consistent with those observed at @xmath16 , although the associated large uncertainties may hide a different behaviour ( figure  [ fig : stack ] and [ fig : ml ] ) .",
    "3 .   we computed the lf in the rest - frame @xmath3 band , using the @xmath267 estimator , in four different redshift bins : @xmath16 , @xmath91 , @xmath92 and @xmath17 .",
    "the lf shows evolution from @xmath17 to @xmath16 .",
    "schechter fits to the @xmath267 lf marginally prefer pure evolution in luminosity over a pure evolution in density ( figure  [ fig : lf ] ) .",
    "4 .   the non - decreasing @xmath13 with luminosity ( corresponding to an injective mapping ) allowed us to apply a simple conversion from luminosity to stellar mass .",
    "we therefore converted our lf measurements into smf using the @xmath13 recovered from the stacking analysis at @xmath16 .",
    "the obtained smfs are consistent with the average smf determination from the literature . despite the relaxed s / n cuts in irac flux applied to our samples ,",
    "the lower stellar mass over which we recover our smfs is @xmath428 larger than typical lower limits from the literature ( figure  [ fig : smf ] ) .",
    "evolution in the halo mass relative to @xmath16 recovered from abundance matching the halo mass functions reproduces the luminosity evolution of the lf at @xmath24 ( figure [ fig : lf4hmf ] ) .",
    "the stellar - to - halo mass ratio at fixed cumulative number density shows no strong evidence for evolution with redshift over @xmath429 ( figure [ fig : hmf_fix_cnd ] ) .",
    "the above results allow us to draw the following conclusions :    1 .",
    "the current depth of _",
    "spitzer_/irac data revealed to be sufficient to probe the regimes in rest - frame uv luminosities both where the rest - uv luminosities are correlated with stellar mass and where they are not .",
    "the existence at @xmath16 and @xmath91 of lbgs luminous in the rest - frame @xmath3 band and spanning a broad range in uv luminosities suggests that the adoption of the uv lf for smf estimates may be affected by systematics .",
    "specifically , samples of galaxies selected to have a narrow range in uv luminosities potentially include a combination of high and low mass objects , and ultimately can introduce an over - estimate of the low - mass end slope and an underestimate of the densities at the high - mass end .",
    "the higher values of the lower stellar mass bin in our smfs compared to recent determination from the literature , arising from the s / n cuts applied to the irac fluxes , suggests that current low - mass end of the smfs at @xmath24 might be based on low s / n flux measurements ( @xmath430 upper limits ) in the observed irac bands most sensitive to the stellar mass ( i.e. , @xmath31 m and @xmath8 m ) . higher s / n measurements are available from @xmath7 m and @xmath51 m data",
    ". however these bands at @xmath52 are contaminated by nebular emission which can potentially bias the stellar mass estimates , given our still limited knowledge on the emission line intensities of high - redshift star forming galaxies .",
    "the rest - frame @xmath3 band lf can be a valid proxy for smfs and hmf measurements at @xmath24 .",
    "the nearly flat dependence of the @xmath13 on @xmath9 increases this confidence .",
    "this work is largely based on data from the cryogenic programs of _ spitzer_/irac .",
    "while the depth of the @xmath7m- and @xmath51m- band data can still be improved through non - cryogenic programs , the sensitivity of jwst / miri provides the only opportunity for increasing the depth at wavelengths @xmath431 m , necessary for improving current estimates of stellar masses at @xmath52 .",

    "after applying the s / n cuts described in sect .  [ sect : sample_assembly ] , we further cleaned our sample , excluding those objects satisfying any of the following conditions : 1 ) the contribution to the @xmath31 m and @xmath8 m flux from neighbouring objects is excessively high ; 2 ) the source morphology is very uncertain or confused making irac photometry undetermined ; 3 ) the source is detected at x - rays wavelengths , suggesting it is a lower redshift agn ; 4 ) the source is at higher redshift , but its sed is dominated by agn light ; 5 ) lbgs with a likely @xmath93 solution from photometric redshift analysis . in the following paragraphs",
    "we will describe in more detail the above criteria and their effects on the sample size .",
    "the broad irac psf together with the unprecedented photometric depth of the irac mosaics in the goods - n , goods - s and ultravista fields can result in flux measurements potentially affected by contamination from brighter nearby objects .",
    "the procedure we adopted for the flux measurements already deals with this problem by cleaning each source from its neighbours before performing the photometry .",
    "however , in some cases the flux at the position of the object of interest mostly comes from the bright neighbours , resulting in potentially very uncertain flux measurements .",
    "we therefore opted to further clean our sample by applying a cut on the maximum fraction of flux from neighbours contributing to the flux of each object before the neighbour - cleaning process .",
    "specifically we excluded from our sample those sources whose neighbours were contributing more than 65% to the total flux at the position of each source in our sample .",
    "we also visually inspected the cutouts from the irac photometry and further excluded those sources showing a residual contamination from bright nearby sources . in this step",
    "we removed 280 galaxies ( 211/69 , for goods - n / s and ultravista , respectively ; of the 211 goods galaxies , 3 were at @xmath92 and 1 at @xmath17 ) . in section  [",
    "sect : completeness ] we describe the monte carlo simulation we implemented to evaluate the selection effects introduced by the above selection criteria in a statistical way .",
    "we visually inspected the cutouts of the goods - n / s sample in the wfc3/@xmath60 band and of the ultravista sample in the acs / f814w , and excluded those objects with doubtful morphology , as e.g. , it was the result of two or more distinct objects or the deblending from sextractor was deemed inconsistent",
    ". furthermore , the visual inspection also allowed us to identify and exclude objects with point - source morphology as either potentially agn dominated or brown dwarfs contaminants .",
    "this was particularly important for the ultravista sample , since the @xmath27-band detection image is characterized by a psf fwhm @xmath432 , much broader compared to that of acs or wfc3 ( fwhm @xmath433 and @xmath434 , respectively ) .",
    "this class of objects are subject to very inaccurate photometry , redshift classification and/or luminosity measurement . through the above criteria we excluded 53 objects from the goods - n / s sample ( 1 at @xmath17 ) and 63 objects from the ultravista sample .    successively , we crossmatched our sample to catalogs of x - ray sources in the goods - n / s @xcite and cosmos fields @xcite , and excluded all the matching sources as these are potential lower - redshift agn contaminants .",
    "we identified 34 sources with an x - ray counterpart matching our initial sample , most of which at @xmath16 ( 29 ) , and 4 at @xmath91 .",
    "furthermore we visually inspected all the observed seds to exclude either objects with very red , power - law like rest - frame optical / nir slopes which could be signature of type-1 agn . in this step we flagged and removed from the sample a total of 74 sources ( 20/54 ) .",
    "finally , we run eazy @xcite on the sample of lbgs , and excluded those galaxies with @xmath435 , sources with prominent secondary lower-@xmath177 solution or inconsistent sed . through this step we excluded 109 sources ( 4 of which at @xmath92 ) .",
    "the final sample consists of 2098 galaxies at @xmath16 ( 1680 from the lbg sample and 418 from the ultravista sample ) , 72 at @xmath91 , 10 at @xmath92 and 2 objects at @xmath17 .",
