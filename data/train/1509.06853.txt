    "face recognition ( fr ) is an effortless task for humans while it is difficult task for machines due to pose and illumination variation , ageing , facial growth to mention a few . while having so many difficulties face carries more information as compared to iris , figure , gait etc .",
    "fr has advantage that , it can be captured at a distance and in hidden manner whereas other biometric modalities like fingerprint , palm prints and knuckle prints require physical contact with a sensor .",
    "the fr field is active research area because of surveillance , pass port , atm etc .",
    "the problem with fr is the high - dimensionality of feature space ( original space ) .",
    "a straightforward implementation with original image space is computationally costly .",
    "therefore , techniques of feature extraction and feature selection are used . in the recent past",
    "many fr algorithms have been implemented .",
    "these algorithms can be roughly classified into three categories :    1 .",
    "feature based matching methods that deals with local features such as the eyes , mouth , and nose and their statistics which are fed into the recognition system [ 14 ] .",
    "2 .   appearance - based schemes that make use of the holistic texture features [ 17 ] .",
    "hybrid features that uses local and holistic features for the recognition .",
    "it is reported that the hybrid approach gives better recognition results [ 26 ] .",
    "one of the implementations of the structure - based schemes is based on the human perception [ 24 ] .",
    "@xmath0 in this implementation , a set of geometric face features , such as eyes , nose , mouth corners etc . , is extracted .",
    "the features are selected based on the specific facial points chosen by a human expert .",
    "the positions of the different facial features form a feature vector which is the input to a structural classifier to identify the subject . in the appearance - based schemes , two of the most popular techniques are principal component analysis ( pca ) [ 20 ] and linear discriminant analysis ( lda ) [ 27 ] . _",
    "pca _ : principle component analysis is one of the holistic approaches .",
    "this is one of the statistical approaches based on unsupervised learning method . in which the eigen vectors are computed from the covariance matrix .",
    "pca model the linear variations in high dimensional data .",
    "pca preserves the global structure of the image in the sense the image can be completely reconstructed with pca .",
    "it does the guarantees dimensionality reduction by projecting the @xmath1-dimensional data onto the @xmath2 ( @xmath3 ) dimensional linear subspace .",
    "the objective here is to find a set of mutually orthogonal basis functions that capture the directions of maximum variance in the data .",
    "since pca is used for the dimensionality reduction , hence it can be used for image compression .",
    "we can find many holistic approaches in the literature like kernel pca , 2d - pca complex pca etc _ lda _ : linear discriminant analysis , l is called supervised learning algorithm method .",
    "the fisher faces method he build in the concept of lda .",
    "lda builds the projection axis in such a way that the data points belonging to same class are nearer . and projection points are for the interclass .",
    "lda encodes the discriminating information in a linear separable space using bases which are not necessarily orthogonal unlike in the case of pca .",
    "as the face samples involve high dimensional image space , the eigen - faces approach is likely to find the wrong components that leads to poor recognition . on the other hand ,",
    "the fisher - faces are computationally expensive .",
    "the ultimate aim of any feature extraction algorithm is , it should build highly describable features .",
    "the developed features should produce ideally zero variance within the class . and should produce infinite variance for the interclass .",
    "the organization of the rest of paper is as follows .",
    "section 2 describes the basic lbp and it s variants .",
    "section 3 discusses the fuzzy logic . in section 4 the proposed method",
    "is presented .",
    "section 5 describes the experimental setup and results .",
    "section 6 gives the conclusions of this paper .",
    "in this section brief concepts of basic lbp and it s variants are discussed the basic lbp was proposed by [ 15 ] and some of it s variants are tan and triggs [ 19 ] @xmath0proposed local ternary pattern ( ltp ) uses three levels ( + 1 , 0,-1 ) , these three level are obtained by quantizing the difference between a central pixel and its neighbouring pixel gray .",
    "some of the variants of lbp , are derivative - based lbp [ 9 ] , sobel - lbp [ 25 ] , uniform lbp [ 2 ] , rotation invariant lbp [ 5 ] , multi - dimensional lbp [ 18 ] , dominant lbp [ 13 ] , centre - symmetric lbp [ 21 ] @xmath0and transition lbp [ 1 ] , have been proposed .",
    "lbp concept is applied to area like face recognition [ 1 ] , dynamic texture recognition [ 23 ] @xmath0and shape localization [ 9 ] . @xmath0 the local binary pattern ( lbp ) method is widely used in 2d texture analysis .",
    "the lbp operator is a non - parametric 3x3 kernel which describes the local spatial structure of an image .",
    "it was first introduced by ojala et al [ 15 ] @xmath0 who showed the high discriminative power of this operator for texture classification . at a given pixel position @xmath4 ,",
    "lbp is defined as an ordered set of binary comparisons of pixel intensities between the centre pixel and its eight surrounding pixels .",
    "the decimal values of the resulting 8-bit word ( lbp code ) leads to 28 possible combinations , which are called local binary patterns abbreviated as lbp codes with the 8 surrounding pixels .",
    "the basic lbp operator is a fixed @xmath5 neighbourhood as in fig .",
    "[ fig : basiclbpoperator ] .",
    "@xmath6    c|c|c|c|c + & 0 & 1 & 0 & + & 1 & & 0 & + & 1 & 0 & 1 & +   +    the lbp operator can be mathematically expressed as : @xmath7 where @xmath8 corresponds to the gray value of the centre pixel @xmath9 , @xmath10 to the gray values of the 8 surrounding pixels and function s is defined as , @xmath11      uniform lbp binary patterns , proposed by t. ojala et .",
    "al [ 16]@xmath12 have certain fundamental properties of texture . in this implementation",
    "they have considered if the frequency of occurrence exceeds 90% then they call it as uniform patterns .",
    "the frequency considered here is the transition from zero to one and one to zero .      as in the case of basic lbp",
    "the central pixel is taken as threshold and neighbouring pixel is assigned values . in the case of mb - lbp",
    "[ 22 ] @xmath0the same procedure is adapted .",
    "they consider the rectangular box as the reference .",
    "for this reference rectangular box the average value is computed and this average value will be acting as threshed , and the neighbouring blocks are assigned the value based on threshold .",
    "3p - lbp [ 3]@xmath12 is obtained by comparing the values of three neighbouring windows to produce a one bit value .",
    "a @xmath5 window centred on a pixel and @xmath13 additional windows distributed uniformly in a ring of radius r around each pixel is considered .",
    "pairs of windows are compared with the centre patch , and a bit set describing which of the two windows is more similar to the centre patch . in 4p - lbp ,",
    "two rings of radii @xmath14 and @xmath15 are considered .",
    "the code is then produced by comparing the two centre symmetric windows in the inner ring with two centre symmetric windows in the outer ring positioned @xmath16 patches away along the circle .      in lbp variance ( lbpv )",
    "[ 5 ] , the contrast of the image is used along with neighbouring points and radii , are used to generate joint distribution of local pattern that yields a dominant texture descriptor .",
    "lbpv contains both local pattern and local contrast information .",
    "an alternative is the use of a hybrid scheme , lbp variance ( lbpv ) , which uses globally rotation invariant matching with locally variant lbp texture features .",
    "lbpv provides efficient joint lbp and contrast distribution where the variance is used as an adaptive weight to adjust the contribution of the lbp code in histogram calculation . in spite of the the great success of lbp in pattern recognition",
    ", its underlying working mechanism still needs more investigation . even after having so many versions of lbp the problem still remain to be address other possibilities which can cater better recognition rate in other words which information is missing in the lbp and how to effectively represent the missing information in the lbp style so that better texture classification can be achieved ?    looking at the limitation of the pca , lda techniques and taking advantage of information sets , which have been developed by hanmandlu [ 6]@xmath12 to enlarge the scope of fuzzy sets .",
    "information set concept is simple understand .",
    "the image after portioned is treated as the information source .",
    "the information sources contained in windows form the fuzzy sets .",
    "the distribution of these information sources in the fuzzy sets requires an appropriate membership function to fit .",
    "when fuzzy set coupled with membership function forms the information set .",
    "we concentrate on extracting the local fuzzy features from images , instead of considering complete image which is a high - dimensional vector . to extract the simple and robust local features of an image",
    ", we use basic local binary pattern ( lbp ) , information set and the central pixel .",
    "these features are tested empirically on svm [ 4 ] .",
    "fuzzy logic theory has been extensively used in all the fields .",
    "it is the extension of crisp set theory and fuzzy logic ( fl ) will helps to deal with imprecise and uncertain data .",
    "it tackles the concept of partial truth .",
    "it was introduced by prof .",
    "zadeh to model the vagueness and ambiguity in complex systems for which there is no mathematical model .",
    "the limitation of fuzzy sets is that information source values and their membership function values are treated separately for all the problems dealing with the fuzzy logic theory .",
    "the membership function value gives the degree of association of a particular information source value in a fuzzy set [ 6].@xmath0 the proposed work seeks to combine the information source values with their membership values together called information set .",
    "the fuzzifier developed by hanmandlu et.al [ 8 ] @xmath12has the scope to enlarge the fuzzy set . to give an example of agent , consider a set of students graded based on the performance of the class topper as the benchmark and the student s individual performance ( information source value )",

    "we consider non overlapping sub images .",
    "we compute a membership function for each window using s - membership function , z - membership fuction , gaussian membership function , the new proposed membership function and root mean features .",
    "for all the features we use central pixel to compute the final feature , the reason being the central pixel value is lost once we obtain the lbp feature .",
    "let @xmath23 be the membership value of the window using any of the above method the size of the membership will be @xmath5 when we get this from the @xmath5 window .",
