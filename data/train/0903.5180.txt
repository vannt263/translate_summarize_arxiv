    "in the standard model ( sm ) , weak transitions between quark flavours are described by the elements @xmath2 of the cabibbo kobayashi maskawa ( ckm)@xcite matrix .",
    "theory does not predict the magnitude of the elements which therefore must be determined experimentally .",
    "the matrix is unitary by construction and one of the unitarity conditions , @xmath3 , can be geometrically represented as a triangle in the complex plane @xmath4 , @xmath5 , where @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "@xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 are defined in the wolfenstein s ckm parametrization  @xcite . ] , the well known unitarity triangle ( ut ) .",
    "any non zero value of the @xmath11 parameter is an indication of @xmath12 violation .",
    "the angles and sides of the ut can be measured by studying @xmath1 meson decays .",
    "the unitarity triangle analysis shows an impressive success of the ckm picture in describing @xmath12 violation in the sm , but , as the experimental results become increasingly precise , a slight disagreement between the angle @xmath13 , characterising indirect @xmath12 violation in @xmath14 transitions and currently known at the 4% level , and @xmath15 has appeared in the ut fit . this disagreement could be due to some problems with theoretical calculations impacting on @xmath0 determinations .",
    "tree - level processes are essentially immune to contributions from new physics , so studying semileptonic @xmath1 decays and therefore determining @xmath16 and @xmath0 is a way to test the electroweak sector of the sm .",
    "while the determination of @xmath16 is at the 2% level  @xcite , the uncertainty on @xmath0 is still at the 8% level .",
    "the need for an improvement in the precision on @xmath0 is therefore evident .    in the following",
    "we will present the current status and outlook regarding experimental determinations of @xmath0 .",
    "the theoretical description of charmless semileptonic @xmath1 decays is at a mature stage .",
    "@xmath17 decays provide the cleanest way to measure @xmath0 since the leptonic and hadronic part of the weak current factorize into two terms not interacting between each other , resulting in an easy theoretical description at the parton level , even though uncertainties arise when introducing qcd calculations to describe the hadronization process .",
    "given the fact that the @xmath18 quark mass is considerably larger than the scale @xmath19 that determines the low energy hadron physics , the total rate can be expanded in powers of @xmath20 and @xmath21 , separating non - perturbative and perturbative physics .",
    "two main experimental approaches are used to measure @xmath0 from @xmath17 decays , depending on the choice being made between integrating over all possible charmless final states or selecting a particular one : inclusive and exclusive .",
    "the first approach provides higher signal efficiency while the second gives a better background rejection .",
    "theoretical inputs are needed by both approaches to model the hadronization , but since they rely on independent calculations , they provide two complementary determinations of @xmath0 .",
    "the most recent measurements of charmless semileptonic @xmath1 decays have been performed by the , belle and cleo experiments . these experiments record @xmath22 collisions at the energy of the @xmath23 , a @xmath24 bound state that decays predominantly to @xmath25 or @xmath26 mesons .",
    "the main backgrounds for @xmath27 transitions are the more abundant @xmath28 ( rate @xmath29 times larger ) , the continuum background coming from @xmath30 and , where applicable , combinatorial background due to random association of tracks in the reconstruction of a @xmath1 meson .",
    "there are three established experimental techniques employed to select signal events , that differ on the reconstruction of the second @xmath1 in the event ( _ tag _ side ) , and are described below .      in the untagged method the @xmath1 recoiling against the signal @xmath1 is not explicitly reconstructed . with this technique ,",
    "the neutrino four - momentum is inferred from the difference between the four - momentum of the colliding beam particles and the sum of the four - momenta of all the charged and neutral particles detected in a single event .",
    "the kinematic consistency of a @xmath31 candidate with a @xmath1 meson decay is evaluated using two variables : the beam - energy substituted mass @xmath32 , and the energy difference @xmath33 . here",
    "@xmath34 is the total cm energy , and @xmath35 and @xmath36 denote the magnitude of the 3-momentum and energy of the @xmath31 candidate in the cm frame . for correctly identified @xmath31 decays , the @xmath37 distribution peaks at the @xmath1 meson mass , while @xmath38 is consistent with zero .",
    "the untagged method offers higher signal efficiency ( @xmath39 ) with respect to the other two methods but due to the poor resolution on the neutrino 4-momentum has lower purity .      in the semileptonic method ,",
    "a @xmath40 decay is reconstructed in the tag side .",
    "several @xmath41 and @xmath42 decay modes are used for tagging .",
    "the presence of two neutrinos requires other kinematical constraints in order to separate signal events from backgrounds . with respect to the untagged method",
    ", the semileptonic tag provides lower efficiency ( @xmath43 ) but higher purity .      in this method",
    "the tag side is reconstructed as a decay of the type @xmath44 , where @xmath45 represents a linear combination of charged and neutral pions and kaons .",
    "several decay combinations are taken into account . @xmath38 and @xmath37",
    "variables are used to check the consistency of the reconstructed @xmath1 candidate . since the @xmath31 is fully reconstructed ,",
    "the kinematics of the event is completely constrained and charge and flavour of the signal @xmath1 can be inferred .",
    "given the good neutrino 4-momentum resolution provided by this method , other kinematical variables , such as the leptonic squared invariant mass @xmath46 , the missing mass squared @xmath47 or the hadronic invariant mass @xmath48 can be exploited to separate the background from the @xmath49 signal events .",
    "the fallback of this method is the very low tag efficiency ( at the order of @xmath50 ) .",
    "in the exclusive approach , the measured branching fraction for a specific charmless decay channel , e.g. @xmath51 , is converted into @xmath0 using theoretical calculations of the form factors ( ff ) which parametrize qcd effects .",
    "in particular , for @xmath51 decays , the differential branching fraction as function of @xmath46 is proportional to @xmath52 , the latter term of the product being the ff . experiments measure @xmath52 and information on the shape and normalization of @xmath53 must come from theory .",
    "several ff calculations are available , based on quark models  @xcite , lattice qcd  @xcite and light cone sum rules ( lcsr )  @xcite .",
    "lattice qcd and lcsr calculations have validity in complementary @xmath46 ranges , giving predictions for @xmath54  gev@xmath55/@xmath56 and @xmath57  gev@xmath55/@xmath56 respectively .    with more and more statistics provided by the @xmath1-factories ,",
    "it has become possible to measure branching ratios in different @xmath46 intervals and compare the predicted ff shapes to experimental data .",
    "figure  [ ff_figure ] shows the differential partial branching ratio spectrum as function of @xmath46 for @xmath58 decays measured with an untagged analysis performed by  @xcite .",
    "this analysis has shown that ff calculations based on quark models are not consistent with data distributions .",
    "table  [ excl_table ] lists a summary of published branching ratio determinations for @xmath59 decays .",
    "all the measurements are consistent within the experimental uncertainties . among all the methods ,",

    "the exclusive determinations are still limited by the theoretical uncertainties on the knowledge of the ff , which contribute up to 23% to the total error .    branching ratio measurements of a @xmath1 meson decaying into other",
    "charmless semileptonic final state ( @xmath8 , @xmath64 , @xmath65 ) have been performed ( world averages can be found on hfag website  @xcite ) ; however theory calculations necessary to convert these measurements into @xmath0 values are not yet mature .     determinations for different form factor calculations for the full @xmath46 range.,width=302 ]",
    "the full rate of inclusive charmless @xmath1 decays is computed within the operator product expansion ( ope ) with a theory uncertainty of @xmath66 , mainly due to uncertainty on the @xmath18 quark mass . in practice",
    "the accessible rate is reduced since it is necessary to exploit kinematical variables that describe the semileptonic decays in order to suppress the overwhelming background from @xmath67 transitions ; this restricts the measurement to phase space regions where particles containing charm can not be produced .",
    "the drawback of this approach is on the theory side since calculating partial widths in regions of phase space where @xmath68 are suppressed is very challenging , as the hqe convergence in these regions is spoiled and a non - perturbative distribution function , the shape function ( sf)@xcite , whose form is unknown , needs to be introduced .",
    "weak annihilation and other non - perturbative effects need to be modeled too .",
    "the shape function is a universal property of @xmath1 mesons at leading order , however sub - leading shape functions arise at each order in the @xmath69 expansion .",
    "sf parameters can be constrained by measuring moments of inclusive distributions from @xmath70 and @xmath71 decays which are related to the same heavy quark parameters ( @xmath72 , the @xmath18 quark mass and @xmath73 , the square of the kinetic energy of the @xmath18 quark in the @xmath1 meson ) .    in recent years , many theoretical calculations have become available , either based on the ope approach  @xcite or on models of non - perturbative qcd  @xcite .",
    "several kinematical variables are used to separate signal from @xmath67 background , each having its own advantage .",
    "the lepton energy @xmath74 is the simplest to measure but the cut applied to reduce the charmed background restricts the total accessible signal rate to @xmath75 of the total ; moreover the dependence on leading and subleading sf and weak annihilation corrections may be substantial .",
    "the squared leptonic invariant mass @xmath46 is weakly sensitive to sf effects , has higher accessible @xmath49 fraction , @xmath76 , but is sensitive to weak annihilation corrections .",
    "much higher signal rate is provided by the hadronic invariant mass @xmath48 and the light cone momentum @xmath77 , @xmath78 and @xmath79 respectively , but both depend on sf and subleading sf corrections .",
    "the most recent inclusive @xmath0 determinations have been performed by the  experiment using the hadronig tag technique  @xcite . in this analysis , inclusive @xmath48 , @xmath80 and @xmath81 distributions",
    "have been reconstructed for semileptonic @xmath1 decays and measurements of charmless partial branching fractions have been performed in regions of phase space where the @xmath82 transitions are highly suppressed . continuum and combinatoric backgrounds have been subtracted with fits to @xmath37 distributions .",
    "figure  [ babarhad_figure ] shows the fits of monte carlo @xmath67 ( blue ) , @xmath49 ( white ) and other background ( gray ) shapes to the measured data ( points ) from which partial branching fractions for the signal enhanced region have been determined .",
    "@xmath0 values have then been calculated using the relation @xmath83 where @xmath84 is the @xmath1 lifetime and @xmath85 are the theoretical acceptances provided by the cited models .",
    "the @xmath0 determinations obtained are in good agreement with the ones provided in a similar analysis by belle  @xcite , and show that the measurements based on @xmath48 and @xmath81 are compatible with theory calculations , while there is a hint that results based on @xmath80 are somewhat lower than theory predictions and closer to @xmath0 determinations which use exclusive charmless semileptonic decays .",
    "hfag  @xcite provides world averages of @xmath0 values obtained within the currently available theoretical frameworks and these are listed in fig .",
    "[ inclvub_figure ] .",
    "inclusive charmless semileptonic decays give @xmath0 determinations that are compatible with exclusive ones , even though with higher values . as is the case for the exclusive measurements , the dominant uncertainty is due to theory ( @xmath86 ) .",
    "values obtained using different theoretical calculations.,width=302 ]",
    "_ weak annihilation _ denotes a @xmath87 decay in which the @xmath88 and the spectator @xmath89 quark forming the @xmath90 meson annihilate into a @xmath91 boson , and a soft gluon emitted in the interaction materializes into a charmless final state . the contribution to the total charmless semileptonic rate",
    "is expected to be small , of the order of 3% , but can be relevant when selecting large @xmath46 regions .",
    "weak annihilation can be experimentally observed as a difference in the partial decay rates of @xmath92 and @xmath93 at high @xmath46 since it occurs only for charged @xmath1 mesons .",
    "measurements performed by  @xcite and cleo  @xcite have provided no evidence of weak annihilation so far , placing the upper limit : @xmath94 at @xmath95 cl .",
    "the large datasets collected at the @xmath1-factories , and the increased precision of theoretical calculations have allowed an improvement in the determination of @xmath0 . however , there are still significant uncertainties . in the exclusive approach ,",
    "the most precise measurement of the pion channel branching ratio is obtained by an untagged analysis .",
    "this very good precision can be reached by tagged analyses with more data .",
    "the problem with exclusive decays is that the strong hadron dynamics can not be calculated from first principles and the determination of the form factor has to rely on light - cone sum rules or lattice qcd calculations .",
    "the current data samples allow a comparison of different ff models with data distributions . with further developments on lattice calculations , the theoretical error should shrink to reach the experimental one .",
    "the inclusive approach still provides the most precise @xmath0 determinations . with new theoretical calculations ,",
    "the mild ( @xmath96 ) discrepancy with respect to the @xmath0 value determined from the global ut fit has been reduced . as in the exclusive approach ,",
    "theoretical uncertainties represent the limiting factor to the precision of the measurement . reducing the theoretical uncertainties to a level comparable with the statistical error is challenging .",
