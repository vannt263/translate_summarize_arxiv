    "the importance of cold accretion for the star formation rate of galaxies has recently been the subject of various semi - analytic studies , which show that the evolution of the specific star formation rate ( ssfr ) of galaxies can be reproduced at @xmath17 @xcite .",
    "however , these models fail to reproduce the observed ssfr of galaxies at @xmath18 @xcite , where in particular the ssfr is approximately constant @xcite .",
    "one option is that a second mode of star formation enters at high redshift , perhaps driven by mergers @xcite , in contrast to the canonical cold gaseous disk instability model that elegantly reproduces the schmidt - kennicutt star formation relation at @xmath19    in this letter , we address the question whether it is possible to reconcile observations of specific star formation rates at @xmath1 with simple models of accretion - driven star formation at high - z .",
    "we focus on the question how star formation needs to be modulated to accomplish this task and derive empirical scaling relations for the star formation efficiency in galaxies at high @xmath20",
    "the basic modelling approach we follow is similar to @xcite and @xcite . in this approach the evolution of a galaxy within a dark matter halo",
    "is followed by calculating the accretion rate of cold gas , the associated star formation rate and the effect from supernovae feedback for a grid of dark matter haloes with varying masses starting at a fiducial redshift .",
    "we approximate the accretion rate of cold gas onto central galaxies by @xmath21 , with @xmath22 as the universal baryon fraction and @xmath23 the dark matter halo mass @xcite . to simplify matters even more , we approximate the dark matter growth rate by an analytic fit @xmath24 m@xmath3 yr@xmath25 @xcite . here",
    "m@xmath26 is the dark matter halo mass in units of @xmath27 m@xmath3 .",
    "once the gas accretion rate as a function of time is known , one can calculate the gas mass in the central galaxy of a given dark matter halo .",
    "we assume that the gas settles onto a rotationally - supported disc hosted by an isothermal halo using the model of @xcite , and convert the gas into stars using a global schmidt - kennicutt law @xmath28 @xcite .",
    "the fiducial value for the star formation efficiency is set to @xmath29 @xcite and the dynamical time of the disc , @xmath30 @xcite .",
    "here @xmath31 is the halo virial radius and @xmath32 its circular velocity . besides models with constant @xmath33",
    "we also investigate models with more general efficiencies that depend on the halo velocity dispersion .",
    "the feedback effects from supernovae onto the cold gas reservoir are included using the approach in @xcite with @xmath34 .",
    "the energy per supernova is @xmath35 ergs , @xmath36 m@xmath37 is the number of type - ii supernovae per solar mass stars formed assuming a chabrier imf , @xmath38 the star formation rate and @xmath39 is the feedback efficiency for which we assume a fiducial value of @xmath40 .",
    "the gas reheated by supernovae feedback contributes to the hot halo and we assume that it does not cool down by @xmath41 .",
    "numerical simulations suggest that most gas in galaxies indeed never reheats before joining it @xcite . in the following",
    "we show our results for solving the differential equations for the evolution of the stellar mass @xmath42 , the cold gas mass @xmath43 , and star formation rate @xmath44 , by explicitly following the dark matter growth @xmath45 as a function of time using the fitting formulae for the average growth rate given above .",
    "we start at @xmath46 with a grid of dark matter haloes ranging from @xmath47 m@xmath3 and set the initial conditions of the galaxies in the haloes to @xmath48 .",
    "we show in the following the properties of individual central galaxies that live in dark matter haloes with such average growth histories .",
    "thus the galaxy properties refer to galaxies with average growth histories . in the following",
    "we assume a standard cosmology with @xmath49 .",
    "in fig . [ fig1 ] we show the predicted ssfr of galaxies for the fiducial model and compare them to the observational data by @xcite .",
    "our results show the same trend as the non - accretion floor model of @xcite . applying an accretion floor of @xmath50 m@xmath3 ,",
    "below which no cold accretion occurs , gives good agreement with observed data at @xmath51 , but suppresses the formation of enough low mass galaxies at @xmath52 .",
    "for this reason we do not apply an accretion floor , and allow gas accretion in halos of all mass .",
    "the trend in ssfr is in stark contrast to the observed data .",
    "most strikingly , low mass galaxies of @xmath53 m@xmath3 show orders of magnitudes too low star formation rates , while massive galaxies with @xmath54 m@xmath3 show an order of magnitude too high star formation rates .",
    "independently of these failures , the time - scales of the inverse ssfrs at @xmath41 are smaller than the age of the universe , indicating efficient early formation .",
    "[ fig1 ] also highlights that the model ssfr-@xmath42 relation is significantly evolving from @xmath41 to @xmath55 , indicated by open and filled circles , respectively .",
    "in contrast the observations shown in the same figure indicate almost no evolution .    before we continue comparing model results to observations",
    "it is worth pointing out potential observational biases .",
    "the main source of uncertainty are the observed star formation rates . in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] we show ssfrs that are not corrected for dust extinction @xcite . including dust extinction results in higher star formation rates , shifting the ssfr-@xmath42 relation to larger values in ssfr , thus worsening the discrepancy between models and observations in particular at the low mass end , if these galaxies were to host significant amounts of dust .",
    "another important source of uncertainty is the completeness of the observed samples .",
    "the @xcite sample is complete above @xmath56 for @xmath57 .",
    "@xcite argue that at low stellar masses their sample is not complete , and misses potentially low star forming galaxies . if indeed a large population of galaxies with star formation rates below these limits exists , the average derived ssfrs are over - estimates . however , independent of such corrections , the upper envelope of the ssfr-@xmath42 can be trusted , and poses particularly at low masses a challenge to models .",
    "span a range from @xmath47 m@xmath3 .",
    "the solid black circles and open circles show the model ssfr at @xmath41 and @xmath55 , respectively . the red triangles and blue squares show the observed data from @xcite at these redshifts , uncorrected for dust extinction and assuming an exponential decaying star formation rate with @xmath58 myr .",
    "typical errors are 0.3 dex .",
    "light blue triangles show the @xmath59 data from .",
    "dashed lines show lines of constant star formation rate for @xmath60 , @xmath61 , @xmath62 , @xmath63 and @xmath64 m@xmath65yr .",
    "latter two correspond to the reported completeness limit in @xcite at @xmath55 and @xmath66 , respectively .",
    "the sample is a combination of three different samples and we refer the reader to their paper on a discussion on the observational limits and incompleteness of their sample selection .",
    "the solid horizontal line marks the inverse age of the universe at @xmath41.,width=302 ]     for a model with @xmath67 during mergers , with @xmath68 km@xmath69s , @xmath70 and @xmath71 . during non - merger episodes @xmath72 .",
    "we here assume that all galaxies undergo mergers at @xmath73 . in reality",
    "galaxies will experience mergers at various different redshifts which will result in a scatter in the ssfrs .",
    "thus the relation we are showing here represents the _ maximum _ ssfr-@xmath42 relation for individual galaxies .",
    "galaxies not going through mergers will be lying closer to the evolutionary tracks shown in fig .",
    "the @xmath55 model - relation looks virtually identical to the one at @xmath41 , which is why we omit showing it in the figure . , width=302 ]    we tested the behaviour of the ssfr for various star formation and feedback efficiencies .",
    "in general , increasing @xmath33 leads to an increase in the stellar mass of galaxies within halos , and a lower ssfr . the latter is directly related to the scaling of the accretion rate with halo mass @xmath74 and the lower reservoir of remaining gas in galaxies .",
    "the same trend is found for reducing the feedback efficiency @xmath39 .",
    "ssfrs drop as galaxies form more easily and now live in less massive halos .",
    "our results suggest that a constant boost in star formation efficiency is not going to improve the low ssfr for galaxies with @xmath75 m@xmath3 .",
    "what is needed is a boost in @xmath33 that is not constant , but of a stochastic nature . within the cdm framework ,",
    "galaxy mergers are a natural candidate to provide such a behaviour .",
    "to recover the strong observed mass - dependence of the ssfr , we propose a relation in which the star formation efficiency during mergers is a power - law of the halo velocity dispersion .",
    "we adopt the following relation during mergers : @xmath76 with @xmath71 as the fiducial value observed locally and @xmath77 a characteristic velocity dispersion .",
    "the values of @xmath78 and @xmath77 are treated as free parameters to obtain the observed scaling in the relation between the ssfr and the stellar mass at @xmath79 .",
    "our best - fit values matching the @xmath41 @xcite data are @xmath68 km@xmath69s and @xmath70 .",
    "a similar scaling has been recently suggested in @xcite based on a porosity model for the inter - stellar medium . within their model black hole feedback triggered by mergers",
    "plays a prominent role .",
    "the authors argue that black holes in low mass galaxies are not massive enough to shut down star formation during their initial growth phase , but instead can possible help boost it @xcite , whereas massive black holes are able to prohibit star formation via agn - feedback .",
    "we implement the stochastic nature of mergers in a very simplified manner to highlight their effects on the ssfr . at redshifts @xmath80 and 4",
    ", we assume that every galaxy has an instantaneous merger .",
    "we assume that the burst is lasting 50 myr with an efficiency given by eq .",
    "we furthermore neglect the stellar mass contribution of the merging partner to the remnant .",
    "our model is clearly a simplification , and we tested the influence of our assumptions on the results by letting mergers occur randomly during the evolution of galaxies , and changing the duration of the merger episode as well as adding stellar mass from a merger partner .",
    "it turns out that the exact frequency of mergers is not important , as long as there is enough time for gas accretion to happen after the merger .",
    "given the high accretion rates at @xmath81 merger - triggered star formation can be frequent in our model , as long as the merger duration is not too long ( @xmath82 myr ) .",
    "adding mass from merger partners only shifts the relation slightly , which can be compensated for by adjusting @xmath77 . outside",
    "merger episodes , we apply the fiducial star formation efficiency , i.e. @xmath83 and follow the evolution of our model galaxies .",
    "the evolution of the ssfr is presented in fig .",
    "we find good agreement between the modelled ssfr-@xmath42 relation and the data of @xcite .",
    "in addition we find that the our ssfr-@xmath42 relation does not change much with redshift , if we assume interacting galaxies are dominating the sample .",
    "as we pointed out above , the observed sample might be missing a population of low star forming galaxies .",
    "such galaxies would be non - merging galaxies within our model , which show low ssfrs closer to the fiducial model shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] . to highlight the non - evolution of the ssfr we compare in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] our model predictions for individual galaxy masses with the observations in the literature .",
    "we find good agreement with the data of @xcite and @xcite if we consider model galaxies between @xmath84 and @xmath85 m@xmath3 .",
    "however , the data of and @xcite show larger values in ssfr .",
    "most of the discrepancy between these and the former data sets is due to different star formation rate estimates that the authors assume , reflecting e.g. their different choice of dust extinction corrections and star formation histories .",
    "interestingly , the latter surveys also predict no or only a week evolution from @xmath41 to @xmath86 . within our model",
    "we can achieve higher ssfrs to be in agreement with this data by adjusting our free parameter @xmath77 .",
    "our results suggest , that if indeed the sample of @xcite is complete in terms of ssfr sensitivity , most if not all low mass high star forming galaxies have to be merger induced .",
    "in this letter , we present a study of the ssfr in @xmath13cdm models in which galactic star formation is driven by cold gas accretion onto a central galaxy , that parallels the growth of the hosting dark matter halo .",
    "such models have been shown to reproduce the observed star formation rates of galaxies successfully at @xmath6 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but fail at high redshifts ( see however * ? ? ?",
    "the rise in ssfr at @xmath87 is due to the increased gas fraction .",
    "however , a new ingredient is required at higher @xmath20 the two observational constraints of a high ssfr for low mass galaxies and non - evolution of the ssfr - stellar mass relation at @xmath1 can not be met by a simple constant increase in the star formation efficiency @xmath33 at @xmath88 .",
    "however , an occasional boost in @xmath33 triggered by mergers in between periods of low star formation efficiency can provide high ssfr .",
    "galaxy mergers are known to trigger starbursts even in minor merger interactions ( @xmath89 , @xmath90 ) ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    ". for details on the low redshift data see @xcite . at @xmath91 ,",
    "typical errors in ssfrs are @xmath92 dex @xcite , indicated by the error - bar on the top left .",
    "we show the average data for the @xcite sample limiting ourselves to galaxies with @xmath93 m@xmath3 and star formation rates above the cited completeness limit .",

    "we show model results for ssfrs averaged over mass bins as lines .",
    "we here assume that the haloes within a mass bin contribute equally .",
    ", width=302 ]    observationally , merger - induced star formation at low redshifts @xmath100 is not the main driver of star formation @xcite .",
    "this is consistent with the growth of dark matter haloes in simulations , which takes place through significant smooth accretion events and not major mergers ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "our results indicate that the situation at @xmath18 is rather different . merging time - scale estimates using dynamical friction",
    "predict to first order a dependence on the mass ratios of the merging partners only , once expressed in units of the hubble time @xcite .",
    "an equal mass merger thus will take place approximately a factor of a few longer at @xmath101 than at @xmath55 .",
    "this behaviour supports frequent interactions at @xmath1 that can trigger star formation while at lower redshifts star formation takes mainly place during quiescent periods in between mergers .",
    "while mergers certainly can boost star formation , agn - regulated starbursts in mergers could provide a natural explanation for the non - evolution of the ssfr - stellar mass relation at @xmath1 .",
    "if the effects of agn - feedback are related to the dark matter potential @xcite a scaling of the star formation efficiency with the halo velocity dispersion can effectively produce a mildly or non - evolving relation .",
    "we show that this is indeed the case for the empirical scaling that we adopt in this paper with @xmath102 during mergers .",
    "a more physical model might appeal to agn growth and feedback which are much less efficient in low mass galaxies , thereby inhibiting quenching , while in massive galaxies , the central black holes are already fully grown and are responsible for quenching the sfr .    enhanced merging at high redshift",
    "provides the ssfr boost that also lends itself to generating enhanced @xmath103 in the resulting massive galaxies .",
    "we predict that there should be rare low mass @xmath103 `` refugees '' , perhaps companions of massive etgs , that have avoided the final merging fate and gas blow - out , but nonetheless carry chemical traces of their enhanced ssfr history .",
    "the role of agn remains to be elucidated .",
    "quenching of star formation is commonly attributed to agn .",
    "this may be the case for massive galaxies at high redshift .",
    "however agn may also play a role in boosting star formation in the low mass systems where the ssfr is enhanced . a future test of",
    "the role of agn will be to examine the residuals of a sample with measured agn accretion rates and star formation rates in order to see whether for example the eddington ratio correlates ( boosting ) or anti - correlates ( quenching ) with ssfr .",
    "our results suggest that the majority of galaxies with @xmath104 m@xmath3 at @xmath18 are interacting systems .",
    "this prediction can be tested with future upcoming observational missions , and should provide a strong test on the early build - up of galaxies . in a follow - up paper , we will investigate the individual contribution from merger triggered star - bursts and agn with respect to accretion - driven star formation in the context of a full semi - analytic model .",
