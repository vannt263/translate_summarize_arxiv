    "the construction of many nontrivial rational mappings is based on the trivial idea : if one root of a quadratic equation is known then the second one is found in rational form .",
    "the most important example is the family of qrt mappings @xcite introduced as follows : let @xmath0 , @xmath1 be biquadratic polynomials and @xmath2 , then the corresponding map @xmath3 is defined by equations @xmath4 where the solutions @xmath5 , @xmath6 are ignored . obviously , the resulting map is the composition of two rational involutions and @xmath7 is its invariant by construction .",
    "this can be generalized in several ways .",
    "for example , one may consider the rational mapping @xmath8 defined by equations @xmath9 where @xmath2 is ratio of two three - quadratic polynomials .",
    "the generalization for any number of variables is straightforward .",
    "in contrast to the qrt case such mappings are not integrable in general .",
    "however , in papers @xcite some instances were found when a second polynomial or rational invariant exists .",
    "several other examples of third order integrable mappings were studied in @xcite .",
    "in this paper we consider another possibility , assuming from the beginning that the map under construction possesses two invariants @xmath10 , but on each step two of three variables are changed , rather than one .",
    "the idea of differencing two invariants simultaneously was used previously in paper @xcite , but in a different manner .",
    "it is easy to see that if @xmath7 and @xmath11 are ratios of affine - linear polynomials on @xmath12 ( that is , numerators and denominators are of the first degree on each argument ) then the resulting map is a composition of rational involutions again .",
    "three basic involutions satisfy a simple identity and as a result one obtains two commuting maps which share the common invariants and generate the kagome lattice .",
    "recall that the existence of commuting partner is a typical feature of integrable maps @xcite .",
    "the generalization for any number of variables is also straightforward , however the resulting maps are not in general integrable .    it should be stressed that the presented family in no way covers all integrable cases of third order maps . actually , it seems to be not so thick as the qrt - like maps from the papers cited above . on the other hand , the construction scheme seems to be more explicit .",
    "of course , there should be intersections between these families , but the absence of any classification results makes the detailed comparison impossible for the present .",
    "anyway , we see again that the most trivial ideas work more than once ( cf . also the recent construction of yang - baxter maps @xcite ) .",
    "let @xmath13 be affine - linear polynomials on @xmath12 and @xmath2 , @xmath14 .",
    "consider equations for the unknowns @xmath15 : @xmath16 this is a system of the form @xmath17 with coefficients depending rationally on @xmath12 .",
    "obviously , it is equivalent to a quadratic equation and since the solution @xmath18 is known , hence the second solution can be easily found in rational form .",
    "this defines the map @xmath19 . changing the roles of the variables we obtain three rational mappings defined by equations @xmath20 assuming that the identical solutions are always ignored . by construction , these maps are involutive : @xmath21 the following property is far from being obvious .",

[ fig : kagome ] ) .",
    "it is sufficient to prove that the values of @xmath33 obtained in two different ways coincide .",
    "this is equivalent to the statement that the invariant curve intersects the straight line @xmath43 @xmath44 .",
    "let @xmath45 .",
    "consider the intersection lines of the surface ( [ affine ] ) with the planes @xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "let @xmath49 , @xmath50 and @xmath51 be the mutually common points of these lines . then the following equations holds : @xmath52,[y_1,z_1],[\\eta , z_{12}],[y_3,\\zeta])=0 ,    \\\\   & y = y_3     & & : & & \\det([x_3,z],[x_{23},z_2],[x,\\zeta],[\\xi , z_{12}])=0,\\\\   & z = z_{12 } & & : & & \\det([x_2,y_1],[x_{23},y^*],[\\xi , y_3],[x,\\eta])=0\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the notation @xmath53=(pq , p , q,1)^t$ ] is used .",
    "now we find @xmath54 from the last equation where @xmath55 and @xmath56 are eliminated by use of the first and second ones .",
    "the remarkable fact , proved by direct and rather tedious computation is that @xmath57 cancels out and @xmath54 does not depend on it .",
    "this means that any surface of the form ( [ affine ] ) passing through five points ( [ points ] ) passes also through the point @xmath58 .",
    "since the invariant curve is the intersection of two such surfaces , it also runs through this point and @xmath59 .    as a corollary",
    "we immediately obtain that the mappings @xmath60 satisfy the identities @xmath61 therefore we have , in general , a pair of commuting mappings which generate the kagome lattice .",
    "however , for some special choices of @xmath10 this lattice may be reduced due to additional identities for the generators , see examples [ ex : reduced ] , [ ex : finite ] .",
    "the projection of the invariant curve onto the coordinate plane @xmath62 is defined by the equation @xmath63 where @xmath64 , @xmath65 .",
    "generically , this is a biquadratic curve of genus 1 , and the invariant curve is parametrized by the point on the elliptic curve @xmath66 .",
    "here we consider only few very particular examples of the presented mappings .",
    "the investigation of the whole family is probably an interesting but also a very difficult problem .",
    "the size of this family can be estimated roughly as follows .",
    "an affine - linear polynomial on @xmath12 contains @xmath67 coefficient parameters . in the ratios",
    "@xmath10 two parameters are scaled out and we also have to take into account the 3-parametric group of mbius transformations which acts on each variable independently as well as on the invariants . therefore , the total number of essential parameters in the mappings under consideration is at most @xmath68 ( the analogous reasoning gives @xmath69 for the qrt mappings and @xmath70 for its 3-component generalization mentioned in introduction ) .",
    "[ ex : generic]*a generic mapping . * the simplest way to get some experience is to generate maps for the random choice of the coefficeints in @xmath10 and to iterate the random initial data .",
    "it turns out that already coefficients with the random values @xmath71 provide , as a rule , the nondegerate map .",
    "the fig .",
    "[ fig : generic ] plots the images of the point @xmath72 under the mappings @xmath34 and @xmath35 for the invariants @xmath73 here we see that @xmath35 runs through only one branch of the invariant curve .",
    "although the invariants look not too complicated , the corresponding maps are extremely bulky . for example",
    ", three components of @xmath74 contains in total 84 terms and @xmath34 contains 831 terms .",
    "[ ex : polynomial ] * a mapping with polynomial invariants . * as in qrt case , more simple , but still nontrival maps can be obtained already for polynomial invariants .",

    "this means that in this case we obtain only one mapping @xmath85 while @xmath86 .",
    "it should be noted that such sort of group reduction is not related to the polynomiality of the invariants or to the degeneration of the invariant curve .",
    "indeed , in this example its projection on @xmath62 plane is the curve @xmath87 of genus @xmath88 iff @xmath89 .",
    "the map @xmath34 generates the discrete system @xmath90 which can be easily rewritten as the third - order difference equation ( see fig .  [",

    "even more degeneracy occurs when all involutions @xmath37 commute and generate only a few points on the invariant curve .",
