    "averaging the roots for @xmath57 and @xmath58 one estimates @xmath59 that is quite close to the exact eigenvalue .",
    "however , this strategy is only practical for sufficiently small values of @xmath38 as discussed above .",
    "we have thus verified our earlier supposition that the hankel ",
    "pad method should correct a possible failure of the power ",
    "series approach caused by singular points of the potential  energy function in the complex coordinate plane .",
    "clearly , the results of the preceding sections show that    * the sequence of roots of the hankel determinants ( [ eq : hankel_c ] ) converges more smoothly than the sequence of roots of equation ( [ eq : cm=0 ] ) for polynomial potentials .",
    "* the rate of convergence of the sequence of roots of the hankel determinants ( [ eq : hankel_c ] ) is not so strongly dependent on the value of @xmath10 as the sequence of roots of the standard approach ( [ eq : cm=0 ] ) .",
    "in fact , the former converges where the latter does not ( even when @xmath23 ) . * the hankel ",
    "pad method is preferable for the treatment of potential  energy functions with singularities in the complex coordinate plane that limit seriously the range of applicability of the power series .",
    "* however , from a purely practical point of view it is worth noticing that when both approaches are successful , the calculation of the roots of the hankel determinants typically requires more cpu time .",
    "* there is more than one sequence of roots of the hankel determinant ( [ eq : hankel_c ] ) that converges towards a given eigenvalue .",
    "present approach shares this curious phenomenon with the rpm@xcite and appears to be a feature of the hankel determinants constructed from the coefficients of the power series coming from either the riccati equation or the schrdinger one .",
    "the schrdinger equation with the simple potential  energy functions discussed above can easily be treated by means of the rayleigh ",
    "ritz variational method and the basis set of eigenfunctions @xmath60 of the harmonic oscillator @xmath61 , where @xmath62 is an adjustable parameter .",
    "the problem reduces to the diagonalization of the hamiltonian matrix @xmath63 with elements @xmath64 .",
    "the main advantage of this approach is that it provides upper bounds to all the eigenvalues@xcite .",
    "besides , in some cases @xmath65 for all @xmath66 , and the resulting secular equation with a band matrix can be treated as a recurrence relation . in this way",
    "one does not have to diagonalize a large matrix but simply to find the roots of a determinant of much smaller constant dimension@xcite .",
    "this is precisely the case for the simple examples discussed above .",
    "however , this variational method may not be practical if the calculation of the matrix elements of the potential  energy function is too difficult . in that case the power  series methods and its variants may be preferable .",
