    "efficient conversion between microwave and optical modes has attracted great attentions recently @xcite .",
    "the microwave - optical ( m - o ) interface between superconducting quantum circuits and optical photons is essential for quantum communications and distributed quantum computation networks @xcite .",
    "a high - efficiency m - o converter will enable quantum state transfer and long - distance commutation between two microwave systems by optical fibers , without being impacted from microwave thermal noise at room temperature @xcite .",
    "in addition , the m - o converter is also useful for single microwave photon level detectors @xcite .",
    "generally , the m - o conversion can be realized by either direct approaches or indirect approaches .",
    "the direct approaches harness the nonlinear optical effects in dielectrics , such as the electro - optic effect @xcite and the magneto - optic effect @xcite .",
    "the indirect approaches , on the other hand , exploit intermediate degrees of freedom to mediate the coupling between microwave and optical photons .",
    "for example , the reversible m - o conversion mediated by phonons has been proposed and demonstrated experimentally @xcite , where microwave and optical cavities are coupled to a common mechanical resonator .",

    "piezomechanical systems have several advantages : ( i ) the frequency of phonon can be near resonance with the microwave cavity , for example above @xmath0 , which relaxes the cyrogenic temperature required to cool the system to the ground state .",
    "in contrast , in the flexible electromechanical system , the phonon frequency is usually orders smaller than that of microwave photon to enable dispersive microwave photon - phonon coupling @xcite , thus requires lower ambient temperature to suppress thermal phonon excitation .",
    "( ii ) for near - resonant microwave and mechanical modes , both the microwave and the optical cavities are within the resolved - sideband regime , thus the unwanted stokes process ( the parametric photon - phonon pair generation ) is greatly suppressed .",
    "( iii ) the microwave and mechanical modes are linearly coupled , hence additional bias dc field or microwave field is not required .",
    "( iv ) the systems proposed here are combined with integrated photonic chips @xcite , which are very robust and scalable .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we study the basic features of cavity piezomechanics , develop the hamiltonian description of the system , and discuss the possibility of ultrastrong piezomechanical coupling . sec .",
