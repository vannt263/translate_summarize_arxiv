    "the unstable @xmath2 and @xmath3 gauge bosons can not be prepared as asymptotic states .",
    "they are first produced in collisions of stable particles and subsequently we observe their decay products .",
    "the intermediate states associated to resonances in these processes are described by propagators in the physical amplitude .",
    "the latter blows up in the resonance kinematical region , unless an imaginary part , which softens this singularity , is added to the propagators .",
    "the solution to the above problem in field theory requires to include an infinite summation of vacuum polarization diagrams in the gauge boson propagator . at a given order in perturbation theory",
    ", this procedure can destroy the gauge invariance of the resulting amplitudes and therefore , can induce important changes in observable effects @xcite-@xcite .    different prescriptions to obtain gauge - invariant amplitudes have been presented in the literature @xcite-@xcite . in the presence of unstable particles ,",
    "this can be achieved either , ( a ) by making a laurent expansion of the full amplitude around the complex pole associated to the resonance in the second riemann sheet @xcite or , ( b ) by using full propagators and vertex functions in the amplitudes which include only resummation of ( gauge - invariant ) fermion loops @xcite-@xcite .",
    "( for a different approach , see also @xcite ) .    in this paper we shall discuss the electromagnetic gauge invariance in processes where a real photon is emitted from an internal @xmath2 gauge boson .",
    "since gauge invariance in a given process is guaranteed by the fulfillment of the ward identities among different green functions , we will focus our analysis on the latter requirement .",
    "this issue is relevant for instance in processes involving the production and decay of a @xmath1 boson such as @xmath4 @xcite , @xmath5 @xcite , the top quark decay @xmath6 , or @xmath7 @xcite .    in previous papers",
    "@xcite-@xcite the problem of gauge invariance has been considered including the imaginary parts induced by massless fermion loops in the @xmath2 propagator and the @xmath0 vertex .",
    "here we shall address this problem in the case when the fermions in the loops are massive .",
    "generally speaking , mass effects of light fermions in the loops turn out to be negligible for invariant masses of the @xmath1 bosons large enough .",
    "however , we would like to stress two new relevant features that appear in both the massless and massive cases , namely , the appearance of axial - vector contributions to the @xmath0 vertex and the violation of low s photon energy expansion @xcite ( see section 3 ) for specific kinematical configurations of @xmath1 s four - momenta .",
    "in this section we will consider the electromagnetic ward identity relating the @xmath1 propagator and the @xmath0 vertex in the one - loop approximation .",
    "since we are interested in gauge invariance in presence of a finite width for the @xmath1 boson , we will study only the absorptive parts of the one - loop corrections .",
    "following refs .",
    "@xcite , we will consider the kinematical situations where the absorptive parts of two- and three - point functions are generated by fermion loops .    for definiteness let us consider the @xmath1 propagator in the unitary gauge .",
    "dyson resummation of vacuum polarization graphs leads to the following form of the @xmath1 propagator :    @xmath8    and its inverse    @xmath9    where the transverse ( @xmath10 ) and longitudinal ( @xmath11 ) pieces of the @xmath1 vacuum polarization are defined as :    @xmath12    to define the @xmath0 vertex we use the convention @xmath13 , where @xmath14 denote the four - polarization indices and @xmath15 the corresponding four - momenta . in what follows we will assume that the @xmath1 bosons are virtual and the photon is real .",
    "after including the one - loop corrections ( cf_. _ fig .",
    "1 ) we obtain the following form of the full @xmath0 vertex :    @xmath16    where    @xmath17    corresponds to the tree - level expression and @xmath18 denotes the absorptive part of the one - loop correction .",
    "the qed  ward identity which relates the two- and three - point functions involving the @xmath1 boson is given by    @xmath19    this identity provides ( at any order of perturbation theory ) a linear relation between the vertex correction and the vacuum polarization , which reads for the present case    @xmath20    using the explicit expressions for these corrections we can verify the validity of eq.([2.6 ] ) .",
    "indeed , for simplicity let us consider only the contribution of the @xmath21 doublet to the fermion loops . using the standard cutting rules ,",
    "the vacuum polarization is given by    @xmath22    where @xmath23 denotes the step function , @xmath24 is the @xmath25 weak coupling constant , @xmath26 and @xmath27 are the @xmath28-lepton mass and four - momentum respectively .",
    "on the other hand , the vertex correction contains two terms corresponding to two different cut diagrams depicted in figs .",
    "( 1a ) and ( 1b ) , namely ,    @xmath29    where    @xmath30",
    "@xmath31    @xmath32 is the @xmath28 - lepton electric charge in units of the positron charge @xmath33 .",
    "it is straightforward to check that the qed ward identity is satisfied when we insert eqs.([2.7])-([2.10 ] ) into eq.([2.6 ] ) . in other words ,",
    "the electromagnetic gauge invariance is guaranteed in a process involving the production and decay of @xmath1 bosons , if eqs.([2.1 ] ) and ( [ 2.3 ] ) are used for the @xmath1 propagator and @xmath0 vertex function , respectively .",
    "let us now consider the relationship between the above results and those of ref.@xcite .",
    "if the fermions in the loops are massless then @xmath34 , im@xmath35 ( the sum runs over doublets and colours ) and we obtain @xcite when @xmath36    @xmath37    where @xmath38 and @xmath39 denotes the total width of the @xmath1 boson for massless fermions . in this case",
    "the @xmath0 vertex receives only vector contributions and we have @xcite ( see also eqs.([3.1]),([3.3 ] ) and ( [ 3.10 ] ) below )    @xmath40    note that the propagator ( [ 2.11 ] ) can be rewritten as follows :    @xmath41    with @xmath42 and @xmath43    the form of the propagator given in eq.([2.13 ] ) was obtained in @xcite using a laurent expansion of the full propagator around the complex pole position @xmath44 , where @xmath45 plays the role of a ( complex ) renormalization wave function for the @xmath1 boson .",
    "thus , the form of the propagator derived in ref.@xcite , which is valid near the resonance , is identical to the full @xmath1 propagator in the limit of massless fermions in loop corrections . since the full @xmath0 vertex in the massless case has the same tensor structure as the tree - level expression vertex to have the form given in eq.(13 ) . ] , the ward identity is also satisfied .",
    "we note that @xmath46 is a modest correction .",
    "in this section we consider explicitly the absorptive part of the one - loop corrections to the @xmath0 vertex ( fig .",
    "1 ) in the case of massless fermions ( except for the top quark ) . we will focus our attention on the structure of these vertex corrections for two different kinematical configurations involved in processes of current interest , namely , ( a ) @xmath47 and ( b ) @xmath48 in particular , we will discuss the behaviour of the corrections _ in the soft photon limit _ and the non - zero contribution to the axial - vector part induced by the decoupling of the top quark from the absorptive vertex corrections .",
    "the momenta in the @xmath0 vertex flow according to @xmath49 with @xmath50 and the photon being on - shell . since the top quark ( @xmath51 gev )",
    "@xcite is far from being massless , the doublet of fermions @xmath52 containing the top quark does not contribute to absorptive corrections when @xmath53 . in this case , the vertex corrections can be written as    @xmath54    where @xmath55 @xmath56 denote the electric charges of leptons and quarks in units of the positron charge @xmath33 and @xmath57    the vector and axial - vector contributions in eq.([3.1 ] ) are given , respectively , by    @xmath58    @xmath59    where @xmath60 refers to the fermion that emits the photon .",
    "note that if the top contributed to the absorptive corrections @xmath61 , we would have to add the term @xmath62 to the r.h.s . of eq.([3.1 ] ) .",
    "the coefficient of the axial - vector term would become @xmath63 which assures the vanishing of this contribution as noticed in @xcite .    using the results given in the appendix we can write the explicit expressions for the terms in eqs.([3.3]),([3.4 ] ) in the limit where",
    "all fermions except the @xmath64-quark have zero mass :    @xmath65    @xmath66    @xmath67    @xmath68    the above corrections satisfy the following identities :    @xmath69    let us first consider the case @xmath48 this kinematical situation is present , for instance , in the process @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "in this case both cuts in eqs.([3.3]),([3.4 ] ) contribute and we get @xmath70 where @xmath71 is the tree - level @xmath0 vertex defined in eq.([2.4 ] ) .",
    "if we insert the above expressions into eq.([3.1 ] ) we recover eq.([2.12 ] ) _ i.e. _ the result of @xcite , namely , one - loop corrections to the @xmath0 vertex accounts for the rescaling of the tree - level expression by a factor @xmath72 notice however that this factorization of the @xmath0 vertex is valid only when @xmath73    observe that the axial contribution vanishes when we add the two cuts associated to the photon emission from a given fermionic line ( cf .",
    "( [ 3.4]),([3.7]),([3.8 ] ) ) . in other words , when @xmath74 the axial - vector contribution vanishes , regardless of the condition for the cancellation of anomalous terms , @xmath75 .    a second comment concerns the behaviour of vertex corrections in the soft photon limit . according to the low s soft - photon theorem @xcite , the leading terms ( of order @xmath76 and @xmath77",
    ", @xmath78 is the photon energy ) in the amplitude for the emission of a soft photon in a radiative process are determined by the electromagnetic gauge invariance and the corresponding non - radiative process .",
    "terms of the form @xmath79 arise only from photon emission off external charged particles , while photon emission off internal lines starts at order @xmath80 and can not be of the form @xmath81 ( @xmath82 is the photon momentum and @xmath83 is the momentum of an internal line ) . now , if we insert eq.([3.10 ] ) into eq.([3.1 ] ) we can easily check that terms proportional to @xmath84 drop and the vector contribution satisfies in this case low s theorem . as we shall see in the next section ,",
    "this property remains valid in the massive case for kinematical configurations when all possible cuts ( for the photon emission from a given fermionic line ) are allowed .",
    "let us now consider the case @xmath85 such kinematical configuration is present _",
    "e.g. _ in the process @xmath7 @xcite with the appropriate change of the photon momentum @xmath86 according to eqs.([3.3]),([3.4 ] ) only one cut diagram for each loop ( figs .",
    "1b , 1d , 1f ) is allowed in this case and we obtain from eq.([3.1 ] ) :    @xmath87    where we have used the fact that @xmath88 . therefore , the axial contribution is not zero in contradiction with what is claimed in ref.@xcite .",
    "this term does not vanish because the heavy top quark decouples from the absorptive vertex corrections and leaves a net contribution coming from leptons of the third generation .    a second relevant feature in the case @xmath47 concerns the validity of low s expansion with respect to @xmath82 .",
    "as can be easily realized by inserting eqs.([3.6]),([3.8 ] ) into eq.([3.11 ] ) , the vector and axial contributions that appear in the latter equation contain terms of order @xmath89 and @xmath90 .",
    "this is at variance with low s expansion with respect to @xmath91 of course , low s soft photon theorem @xcite is not violated because it is impossible to have @xmath92 when @xmath93 and @xmath94    finally we note that , when @xmath95 the factorization appearing in eq.([2.12 ] ) does not remain valid .",
    "in this section we derive the expressions for the vector and axial - vector contributions to the absorptive part of the @xmath0 vertex when the masses of the fermions are taken into account in the loops . to illustrate our work",
    ", we will assume that @xmath96 and that only the @xmath97 and @xmath98 quarks and the @xmath28 lepton are massive fermions .",
    "all the possible cut diagrams giving contributions to the absorptive part of the @xmath0 vertex are shown in fig . 1 and the general expressions for such contributions are provided in the appendix for the case of arbitrary fermion masses in the loops .",
    "the correction to the vertex can be split into vector and axial - vector terms ,    @xmath99    with    @xmath100    and    @xmath101    for simplicity we have neglected the kobayashi - maskawa mixing .",
    "note also that the two different cuts for the emission of the photon from a given fermionic line are determined by @xmath102 and @xmath103 , such that @xmath104 .",
