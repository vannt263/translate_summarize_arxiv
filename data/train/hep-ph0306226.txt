    "the joint explanation of the oscillation signals observed in lsnd  @xcite , in solar  @xcite and atmospheric  @xcite neutrino experiments , and in the kamland reactor experiment  @xcite provides a big challenge to neutrino phenomenology . in refs .  @xcite it was observed that the lsnd signal could be accommodated with the solar and atmospheric neutrino anomalies without enlarging the neutrino sector if cpt was violated .",
    "once such a drastic modification of standard physics is accepted , oscillations with four independent @xmath1 are possible , two in the neutrino and two in the anti - neutrino sector .",
    "the basic realization behind these proposals is that the oscillation interpretation of the solar results involves oscillations of electron neutrinos with @xmath2  @xcite , while the lsnd signal for short - baseline oscillations with @xmath3 stems dominantly from anti - neutrinos ( @xmath4 ) .",
    "if cpt was violated and neutrino and anti - neutrino mass spectra and mixing angles were different  @xcite both results could be made compatible in addition to the interpretation of the atmospheric neutrino data in terms of oscillations of both @xmath5 and @xmath6 with @xmath7  @xcite .    in the original spectrum",
    "proposed , neutrinos had mass splittings @xmath8 to explain the solar and atmospheric observations , while for anti - neutrinos @xmath9 . within this spectrum",
    "the mixing angles could be adjusted to obey the relevant constraints from laboratory experiments , mainly due to the non - observation of reactor @xmath10 at short distances  @xcite , and a reasonable description of the data could be achieved  @xcite . in general , stronger constraints on the possibility of cpt violation arise , once a specific source of cpt violation which involves other sectors of the theory is invoked  @xcite . for a summary of recent theoretical work and experimental tests see , for example , ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein .    on pure phenomenological grounds , the first test of this scenario came from the kamland  @xcite experiment since the suggested cpt - violating neutrino spectrum allowed to reconcile the solar , atmospheric and lsnd anomalies , but , once the constraints from reactor experiments were imposed , no effect in kamland was predicted .",
    "the observation of a deficit in kamland at @xmath11 cl clearly disfavoured these scenarios . furthermore , kamland results demonstrate that @xmath10 oscillate with parameters consistent with the lma @xmath12 oscillation solution of the solar anomaly .",
    "this fact by itself can be used to set constraints on the possibility of cpt violation  @xcite . within the present kamland accuracy , however , the bounds are not very strong because kamland data does not show a significant evidence of energy distortion .",
    "the present situation is that the results of solar experiments in @xmath13 oscillations , together with the results from kamland and the bounds from other @xmath14 reactor experiments show that both neutrinos and anti - neutrinos oscillate with @xmath15 .",
    "adding this to the evidence of oscillations of both atmospheric neutrinos and anti - neutrinos with @xmath16 , leaves no room for oscillations with @xmath17 .",
    "the obvious conclusion then is that cpt violation can no - longer explain lsnd and perfectly fit all other data  @xcite .",
    "this conclusion relies strongly on the fact that atmospheric oscillations have been observed for both neutrinos and anti - neutrinos with the same @xmath18 .",
    "however , atmospheric neutrino experiments do not distinguish neutrinos from anti - neutrinos , and neutrinos contribute more than anti - neutrinos to the event rates by a factor @xmath19 42 ( the factor decreases for higher energies ) .",

    "our basic approach to test the status of the scheme in fig .",
    "[ fig : cptschemes ] as a possible explanation of the lsnd anomaly together with all other neutrino and anti - neutrino oscillation data is as follows .",
    "first , we perform a global analysis of all the relevant data , but leaving out lsnd data . the goal of this analysis is to obtain the allowed ranges of parameters @xmath21 and @xmath51 as defined in eq .   from this all - but - lsnd data set .",
    "we then compare these allowed regions to the corresponding allowed parameter region from lsnd , and quantify at which cl both regions become compatible .    in this approach",
    "we start by defining the most general @xmath52 for the all - but - lsnd data set : @xmath53 notice that in this comparison we have not included the constraints from the non - observation of @xmath34 transitions at karmen  @xcite , which , by themselves , disfavour part of the lsnd allowed parameter region .",
    "the reason for this omission is that we want to test the status of the cpt interpretation of the lsnd signal using data independent of the `` tension '' between lsnd and karmen results  @xcite .",
    "we first focus on the parameters @xmath46 and @xmath54 .",
    "these parameters are dominantly determined by solar neutrino data , which for any @xmath55 prefer values of @xmath46 well below the sensitivity of atmospheric neutrino data .",
    "therefore , solar data are mostly important to enforce the `` decoupling '' of the @xmath46 oscillations from the problem . in other words , the atmospheric neutrino analysis can be made without any loss of generality , in the standard hierarchical approximation for neutrinos , neglecting the effect @xmath46 but keeping the generic-3@xmath13 dependence on @xmath55 .",
    "notice that , unlike in the cpt conserving case , in the relevant ranges of mass differences , @xmath55 is not bounded by any `` terrestrial '' experiment . the dominant source of information on @xmath55 is atmospheric data ( and less important also solar data ) , and for this reason we consistently take into account this parameter in our analysis .",
    "thus , after the marginalization over @xmath46 and @xmath54 eq .   takes the form @xmath56    let us now discuss the information on @xmath36 from reactor experiments .",
    "the observation of the @xmath10 deficit in kamland favours @xmath36 values near the best fit @xmath57 . for such small values oscillations with @xmath36",
    "have no effect for atmospheric neutrinos .",
    "therefore , we will start by studying the case @xmath58 in secs .",
    "[ sec : all - but - lsnd ] and [ sec : comparison ] .",
    "we will relax this assumption in sec .",
    "[ sec : caseb ] , where we investigate also a possible effect of larger values of @xmath36 .",
    "notice also , that the case of small @xmath36 is continuously connected to the cpt conserving scenario since it allows for cpt conservation in the `` @xmath59 '' sector . for @xmath60 , one can easily marginalize over @xmath36 and @xmath61 and eq .",
    "further simplifies to @xmath62 finally , we notice that for any value @xmath63 the results from chooz or , for larger values of @xmath64 , from bugey , imply a strong limit on @xmath65 , and in order to obtain the @xmath10 disappearance observed in kamland @xmath66 has to be small . within this bound the results of the atmospheric neutrino analysis are almost independent of the exact value of @xmath66 and this parameter can be effectively set to zero in @xmath67 without any loss of generality .    for the sake of concreteness we present the quantitative results corresponding to the normal",
    "ordering shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : cptschemes ] for both neutrinos and anti - neutrinos .",
    "we have verified that the conclusions hold also for the corresponding inverted orderings either for neutrinos and anti - neutrinos .",

    "these effects are not important enough to lead to significant differences in the results of the atmospheric neutrino analysis for direct and inverted orderings ( see for instance ref .",

    "this can be directly compared to the corresponding analysis in the cpt conserving scenario : @xmath73 with @xmath74 for @xmath75 dof .",
    "we conclude that , allowing for different mass and mixing parameters for neutrinos and anti - neutrinos , all - but - lsnd data choose a best fit point very close to cpt conservation and maximal @xmath76 mixing .",
    "next we illustrate the amount of cpt violation which is still viable . in order to do so we plot in fig .",

    "the different contours correspond to regions allowed at 90% , 95% , 99% and 3@xmath0 cl for 2 dof ( @xmath79 , @xmath80 , @xmath81 , @xmath82 , respectively ) . in general",
    "the regions are larger for anti - neutrino parameters as a consequence of their smaller contribution to the atmospheric event rates .",

    "<S> we study the status of the cpt violating neutrino mass spectrum which has been proposed to simultaneously accommodate the oscillation data from lsnd , kamland , atmospheric and solar neutrino experiments , as well as the non - observation of anti - neutrino disappearance in short - baseline reactor experiments . </S>",
    "<S> we perform a three - generation analysis of the global data with the aim of elucidating the viability of this solution . </S>",
    "<S> we find no compatibility between the results of the oscillation analysis of lsnd and all - but - lsnd data sets below 3@xmath0 cl . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the global data without lsnd show no evidence for cpt violation : the best fit point of the all - but - lsnd analysis occurs very close to a cpt conserving scenario . </S>"
