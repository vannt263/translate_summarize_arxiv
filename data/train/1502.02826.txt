    "molecular vibrations in condensed phases play an essential role in various dynamic processes , including inter- and intra - molecular couplings , and solvent dynamics , all of which entail energy exchange as well as thermal excitations and relaxations.@xcite multidimensional vibrational spectroscopy techniques make it possible to experimentally distinguish such processes due to the sensitivity of the nonlinear response functions utilized in these techniques to complex dynamics.@xcite for intra - molecular vibrations , the roles of relaxation and dephasing are well understood both theoretically and experimentally due to the advent of infrared ( ir ) laser technologies . methods of analysis with theoretical models that utilize molecular dynamic simulations have also been developed to elucidate multidimensional ir signals.@xcite because the primary inter - molecular modes , which are the objects of study in 2d ir spectroscopy , can be separated from the other modes , as in the case of the oh stretching mode in liquid water , stochastic models whose parameters are obtained from classical molecular dynamics ( md ) simulations have been useful for analysis of the inter - molecular vibrational modes . for inter - molecular vibrational modes ,",
    "two - dimensional raman spectroscopy@xcite was for a long time the only two - dimensional spectroscopy that could be used for experimental study .",
    "however , due to technical difficulties , such investigations have been carried out only for @xmath0,@xcite benzene,@xcite and formamide@xcite liquids .",
    "theoretical investigations have also been limited , due to the availability of experimental data and limitations on computational power for simulations .",
    "two - dimensional thz - raman spectroscopy , which has been studied both theoretically@xcite and experimentally,@xcite has created a new possibility for investigating the details of inter - molecular vibrations . in 2d raman spectroscopy ,",
    "the observable is defined in terms of the three - body response function for the polarizability of the system , @xmath1 as @xmath2,\\hat{\\bm{\\pi } } ( 0)]\\rangle /\\hbar ^{2}$ ] , where @xmath3 represents the thermal average and @xmath4 is the heisenberg operator for an arbitrary operator @xmath5.@xcite in the case of 2d thz - raman spectroscopy , the response function consists of one polarizability , @xmath1 , and two dipole operators , @xmath6 , and there are three different measurements , which depend upon the sequence of the raman and thz pulses as @xmath7,\\hat{\\bm{\\pi } } ( 0)]\\rangle /\\hbar ^{2}$ ] , @xmath8,\\hat{\\bm{\\mu } } ( 0)]\\rangle /\\hbar ^{2}$ ] , and @xmath9,\\hat{\\bm{\\mu } } ( 0)]\\rangle /\\hbar ^{2}$ ] . while inter - molecular vibrational modes are usually both raman and ir active , the types of information that we can obtain from the 2d raman signal and each of three thz - raman signals are different , due to the role of the nonlinear polarizability .",
    "because each of the above - mentioned response functions is defined in terms of the three - body correlation function , the signal will vanish if the system is harmonic and if the total dipole moment and polarizability are linear functions of the collective coordinate , @xmath10 , representing the inter - molecular vibration , because there is an odd number of gaussian integrals involved in the response function : @xmath11 .",
    "the dipole moment is approximated reasonably well as a linear function of @xmath10 as @xmath12 , because the total dipole moment is a linear function of the distance between the charges in the system , and the nonlinear dipole - induced dipole interactions are weak .",
    "however , the contribution of the non - linear polarization is not negligible , because the polarizability originates in the electronic states of molecules , which depend on the complex configurations of the atoms and molecules .",
    "for this reason the polarizability is expressed in a taylor expansion form as @xmath13 . because @xmath1 has this non - linear form , the three response functions give above , representing the observables in 2d thz - raman spectroscopy experiments ,",
    "provide information about three different physical processes .",
    "@xcite contrastingly , because 2d raman spectroscopy experiments measure just a single observables , they do not provide such a detailed picture of the physical system .",
    "the richness of the information obtained through 2d thz - raman spectroscopy allows for a detailed analysis of inter - molecular vibrational modes .",
    "note that the optical setup for the ttr measurement differs significantly from those for the rtt and trt measurements .",
    "this is because the rtt and trt responses are detected as the emission of thz signals , while the ttr response is detected as an induced raman signal .",
    "although we can obtain relatively reliable 2d thz - raman signals using the full md simulation techniques developed for 2d raman spectroscopy,@xcite analysis of the spectra is not straightforward , due to the complexity of the 2d profiles of the signals , which arises from the complexity of the inter - molecular vibrational modes .",
    "as demonstrated by 2d raman and 2d ir spectroscopy studies , a model - based analysis is useful for treating this problem , because the 2d profile of the signal is so sensitive to the underlying dynamics that the complex 2d profile can not be reproduced without capturing the essential features of the vibrational modes.@xcite while stochastic models , which can be regarded as brownian models with non - linear system - bath interactions,@xcite are recognized as versatile models for analyzing intra - molecular modes observed in 2d ir spectroscopy experiments , it is not clear if such models are useful in the 2d thz - raman case .",
    "this is because in contrast to the intra - molecular modes , which are clearly definable with the normal mode picture , the inter - molecular modes are not localized and change in time due to changes in the configuration of the system molecules .    in this paper , we explore the possibility of characterizing inter - molecular modes using a brownian model with linear - linear ( ll ) and square - liner ( sl ) interactions utilizing 2d thz - raman signals obtained from md simulations . in order to treat a non - perturbative , non - markovian , and nonlinear system - bath interaction , which is necessary to describe the effects of homogeneous and inhomogeneous broadening in a unified manner",

    "[ sec : full_md_simulation ] , we explain the methodology for calculating 2d thz - raman signals from full md simulations . in sec .",
    "[ sec : model_calculation ] , we present the ll+sl bo model and the hierarchal equations of motion formalism .",
    "we then show how this formalism can be used to calculate 2d signals .",
    "the md and fitted results obtained from the ll+sl bo model are presented and analyzed in sec .",
    "[ sec : results_and_discussion ] .",
    "section [ sec : conclusion ] is devoted to concluding remarks .",
    "while , to this time , the experimentally obtained 2d thz - raman signals are limited to the case of liquid water , in this paper we analyze 2d signals obtained from full md simulations for formamide , water , and methanol .",
    "we chose these liquids from among many substances that have been investigated in full md studies of the 2d raman and 2d thz - raman spectroscopy as characteristic examples of 2d thz - raman signals .",
    "the md simulation results used in the present study of these molecules for 2d raman - thz - thz ( rtt ) and thz - raman - thz ( trt ) signals were originally presented in a previous study.@xcite nevertheless , here we repeated the full md simulations in order to also obtain thz - thz - raman ( ttr ) and infrared absorption signals , in addition to the rtt and trt signals .",
    "moreover , we employed the ewald sum for the evaluation of the dipole and polarizability , in addition to the force fields .",
    "this contrasts with the situation in previous studies , in which only force fields were computed with the ewald sum .",
    "the change in the resulting signals due to the use of the ewald sum in the computation of the dipole and polarizability , however , are small .      based on the md simulations , we calculated the linear absorption ( 1dir ) spectrum and 2d thz - raman signals of liquid formamide , water , and methanol .",
    "each system consisted of 108 molecules in a cubic box with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "the interactions between the molecules were modeled by a modified t potential,@xcite the tip4p/2005 potential,@xcite and the b3 potential@xcite for formamide , water , and methanol , respectively .",
    "the interaction potentials were cut off smoothly at a distance equal to a half the length of the system using a switching function , and the long - range coulomb interactions were calculated with the ewald sum .",
    "the intra - molecular geometries were kept rigid throughout the simulations , using a constraint provided by the rattle algorithm .",
    "the equations of motion were integrated using the velocity - verlet algorithm with time steps of @xmath14 @xmath15 for formamide and @xmath16 @xmath15 for water and methanol .",
    "the system volume and total energy were fixed after the completion of the isothermal simulations carried out for equilibration .",
    "the conditions of the simulation were set such that the average densities were @xmath17 @xmath18 for formamide , @xmath19 @xmath18 for water , and @xmath20 @xmath18 for methanol .",
    "the temperature was set to @xmath21 @xmath22 .",
    "the permanent molecular polarizability of each liquid was utilized with the atomic polarizability for formamide and methanol,@xcite and the huiszoon polarizability for water.@xcite      while the md simulations were carried out using the permanent polarizability , we calculated the 2d thz - raman signals using a full - order dipole - induced - dipole ( did ) polarizability model .",
    "we did this because the 2d profiles are extremely sensitive to the accuracy of the calculated optical observables .",
    "in the did polarizability model , the expression determining the polarizability of a molecule includes contributions from other molecules , and interactions between molecules are defined with respect to the centers of individual molecules .",
    "@xcite the total polarizability of the system in a md simulation is given by @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the polarizability of the @xmath25th molecule , expressed as @xmath26 in this expression , @xmath27 is the permanent molecular polarizability of the @xmath25th molecule in isolation in the laboratory frame , and @xmath28 is the dipole - dipole interaction tensor @xmath29 here , @xmath30 is the vector from the center of mass of molecule @xmath25 to the center of mass of molecule @xmath31 , and @xmath32 . also , @xmath33 and @xmath34 are the unit matrix and the tensor product , respectively . in order to properly take into account the effect of the long - range interaction on the molecular polarizability , we employ the ewald sum for @xmath28 .",
    "this effect has been ignored in previous md simulations of 2d raman and 2d thz - raman spectroscopy systems . however , the contribution of this effect in the 2d thz - raman case is minor in comparison with that in the 2d raman case .",
    "the total dipole moment is evaluated as @xmath35 , where @xmath36 and @xmath37 are the permanent and induced molecular dipole moments of molecule @xmath25 , respectively .",
    "the induced molecular dipole moment is expressed in terms of the interaction tensor as @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the electrostatic field at molecule @xmath25 created by all the other molecules in the system .",
    "this is evaluated as @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is the vector between the center of mass of molecule @xmath25 and that of atom @xmath42 in molecule @xmath31 .",
    "it should be noted that the majority of md simulations of 2d ir spectroscopy systems performed to this time have been carried out to obtain the parameter values for stochastic models .",
    "full md simulations have been carried out mostly in the cases of low frequency vibrational modes.@xcite this is because the primary inter - molecular modes , which are the objects of study in 2d ir spectroscopy , can be separated from the other modes rather easily , as in the case of the oh stretching mode in liquid water .",
    "contrastingly in the 2d thz - raman case , it is not easy to find primary modes , because the objects of study in this cases are inter - molecular vibrations that depend on the complicated nature of molecular ensembles , whose configurations change in time . thus , we have to evaluate 2d signals directly from the md simulations . because quantum mechanical effects are minor for low - frequency inter - molecular modes , due to their small thermal activation energies , unlike the case of intra - molecular motion , @xcite and because 2d thz - raman spectroscopy employs the three - body correlation function with two time variables , instead of the four - body correlation function with three time variables employed in 2d ir spectroscopy , the full md simulation approach is practical .",
    "for this reason with our approach , we were able to carry out full md simulations to directly evaluate 2d signals .    although our md and model calculations are fully classical , we start from the quantum expressions for the response functions , because their classical expressions in the md and model calculations are most easily derived by taking the classical limit of the quantum expressions .",

    "the response function in the classical limit is expressed as@xcite @xmath58 as in the 1d case , we can calculate the above response function using @xmath59 and @xmath60 evaluated from the molecular trajectories @xmath61 and @xmath57 obtained from the equilibrium md simulations .",
    "@xcite the convergence of the signal is , however , very slow due to the effect of the stability matrix element in the double poisson brackets .",
    "however , there is different approach , the non - equilibrium finite field approach , that does not have this convergence problem . in this approach ,",
    "the double poisson brackets are evaluated as @xmath62 , where @xmath63 is the observable corresponding to @xmath64 calculated from the trajectories subjected to the weak perturbations @xmath65 , with the electric field @xmath66 acting on @xmath67.@xcite but , this approach is computationally intensive , and for this reason , here we employed a hybrid approach , which utilizes both the equilibrium and non - equilibrium approaches in order to reduce the computational cost further.@xcite    in our hybrid approach , we evaluate @xmath68 with equilibrium md simulations , while @xmath69 with non - equilibrium md simulations . as a result , the hybrid expressions for the 2d raman - thz - thz , thz - raman - thz , and thz - thz - raman signals become @xmath70 and @xmath71 where @xmath72 and @xmath73 are the external electric field of the @xmath31th pulse and the inverse temperature divided by the boltzmann constant .",
    "in order to analyze the 2d signals of inter - vibrational modes , we consider a model that consists of a primary oscillator mode nonlinearly coupled to the other modes , which are regarded as a bath system .",
    "this bath system is represented by an ensemble of harmonic oscillators .",
    "the primary mode may change in time or be inhomogeneously distributed .",
    "we can describe both situations within a unified framework by adjusting the bath parameter variables .",
    "the model is constructed by extending a brownian ( or caldeira - leggett ) hamiltonian@xcite to include a nonlinear system - bath interaction .",

    "the sum of the bath coordinates @xmath90 acts as a collective coordinate that modulates the system.@xcite as illustrated in ref . , while the ll interaction shifts the potential , the sl interaction changes its curvature .",
    "although in the anharmonic potential case , the ll interaction also changes the curvature of the potential , we can ignore this effect if the anharmonicity is weak.@xcite next we introduce the spectral distribution function , @xmath91 , which characterizes the bath and system - bath coupling .",

    ", we have the correlation function , @xmath97 .",
    "this indicates that the bath oscillators interact with the system in the form of gaussian markovian noise with correlation time @xmath98.@xcite        because the sl interaction affects the frequency of the potential , the fast modulation limit ( @xmath99 ) of the sl interaction corresponds to the case of a homogeneous distribution , as depicted in fig .",

    "[ fig : ll](iii ) and [ fig : ll](iv ) are similar to those predicted by eqs . and , respectively .",
    "this indicates that the node lines in @xmath174 correspond to @xmath185 and @xmath186 , whereas those in @xmath175 correspond to @xmath187 , where @xmath188 and @xmath76 are any integers .",
    "note that , due to the effect of the heat bath , the fundamental frequency @xmath189 is shifted from @xmath190.@xcite the components @xmath169 and @xmath170 in the ll case appear solely due to the anharmonicity , while those presented in figs .",
    "[ fig : ah_ah ] and [ fig : h_rtt ] arise from both the sl interaction and the anharmonicity in the former case and just the sl interaction in the latter case .",
    "the profiles in the fast modulation limit of the sl mode presented in figs .",
    "[ fig : ah_ah](b ) and [ fig : sl](b ) are similar to those for the anharmonic ll model presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : ah_ah ] , because this limit corresponds to the case of homogeneously distributed oscillators , illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : homo_inhomo](a ) .",
    "the intensity of the @xmath170 component in the ll case is significantly weaker than those of the other components , because of the cancelation explained in appendix b. as in the case of fig .",
    "[ fig : h_rtt ] , we observe nodes along the @xmath191 direction , although they are not clear .    although we included anharmonicity in the sl case depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : sl ] , the overall profiles of the signals are similar to those in the harmonic case , presented in figs .",
    "[ fig : h_trt ] , [ fig : h_ttr ] and [ fig : h_rtt ] .",
    "this indicates that the effects of the sl interactions are dominant in these profiles .",
    "this is also true in the ll+sl case considered in fig .",
    "[ fig : ll_sl ] , as indicated by the similarity of the profiles there with those in figs .",
    "[ fig : h_trt ] , [ fig : h_ttr ] , [ fig : h_rtt ] and [ fig : sl ] .",
    "the intensity of the @xmath169 component in the ll+sl case , however , is much larger than that in the other cases , because the ll+sl interaction induces transitions through the cubic interactions @xmath192 and @xmath193 , derived from @xmath194 .",
    "these interactions can induce a signal in the @xmath169 component , even in the harmonic case , involving only gaussian integrals in the response function , for example , as @xmath195.@xcite then , the profile of the @xmath169 component in the ll+sl case exhibits some similarity to that in the ll model , presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : ll](iii ) , because the dipole and linear polarizability operators associated with the system - bath interactions , for example , @xmath196 and @xmath197 , induce the same dq and zq transitions as nonlinear polarizability .",

    "<S> we explore and describe the roles of inter - molecular vibrations employing a brownian oscillator ( bo ) model with linear - linear ( ll ) and square - linear ( sl ) system - bath interactions , which we use to analyze two - dimensional ( 2d ) thz - raman spectra obtained by means of molecular dynamics ( md ) simulations . </S>",
    "<S> in addition to linear absorption ( 1d ir ) , we calculated 2d raman - thz - thz , thz - raman - thz , and thz - thz - raman signals for liquid formamide , water , and methanol using an equilibrium non - equilibrium hybrid md simulation . </S>",
    "<S> the calculated 1d ir and 2d thz - raman signals are compared with results obtained from the ll+sl bo model applied through use of hierarchal fokker - planck equations with non - perturbative and non - markovian noise . </S>",
    "<S> we find that all of the qualitative features of the 2d profiles of the signals obtained from the md simulations are reproduced with the ll+sl bo model , indicating that this model captures the essential features of the inter - molecular motion . </S>",
    "<S> we analyze the fitted 2d profiles in terms of anharmonicity , nonlinear polarizability , and dephasing time . </S>",
    "<S> the origins of the echo peaks of the librational motion and the elongated peaks parallel to the probe direction are elucidated using optical liouville paths . </S>"
