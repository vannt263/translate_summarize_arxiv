    "during the last decade hard exclusive reactions , such as deeply virtual compton scattering ( dvcs ) , @xmath1 , have been a subject of intensive theoretical and experimental studies  @xcite .",
    "a particular interest has been attached to the generalized bjorken kinematics ,    @xmath2    where @xmath3 is the momentum of the virtual photon ; @xmath4 is the initial momentum of the target hadron ; @xmath5 is the final momentum of the target , and @xmath6 is the momentum transfer .    in this kinematics",
    "the dvcs amplitude is factorized  @xcite into the convolution of the perturbative coefficient function with nonperturbative generalized parton distributions ( gpds ) of the target . recently",
    ", the leading - twist dominance ( validity of the collinear qcd factorization ) in dvcs on the proton target was demonstrated by the hall a collaboration at jefferson laboratory  @xcite , already at rather low values of @xmath7 , @xmath8 gev@xmath9 .",
    "however it turns out that in experiments with nuclei the virtuality @xmath7 is not always very large , and one can not say how accurate the predictions based on factorization are , or , in other words , how large the higher - twist corrections are .",
    "one of the examples , where this approach can not be applied , is dvcs on the nuclei measured by hermes collaboration in desy  @xcite . due to",
    "small-@xmath10 one has to use other effective models , e.g. generalized vector meson dominance model ( gvmd )  @xcite .    at very large @xmath11 ( very small values of @xmath0 ) ,",
    "the perturbative collinear factorization is expected to break down due to high densities of the partons  @xcite .",
    "even for relatively large values of @xmath7 when the running coupling constant of the strong interactions @xmath12 is small , the effective expansion parameter @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the gluon density in the target , becomes large .",
    "this invalidates the perturbative expansion leading to the collinear factorization . since in heavy nuclei the parton densities are enhanced by the atomic number @xmath15 compared to those in the nucleon , the onset of the effects associated with high parton densities may take place at the values of @xmath0 , which will be already achieved at the future electron - ion collider ( eic ) .",
    "in this paper we use the framework of the color glass condensate ( cgc ) model offered in  @xcite ( see also recent reviews  @xcite ) .",
    "we generalize the formalism of the cgc model to exclusive reactions and evaluate generalized parton distributions ( gpds ) and the dvcs amplitude at small-@xmath0 .",
    "we find that for dvcs off heavy nuclei , the dvcs cross section is virtually @xmath0-independent , i.e.  the dvcs cross section _ saturates _ in the small-@xmath0 limit .",
    "the general saturation property built - in into this model is an essentially nonperturbative effect , which complies with the general froissart ( unitarity ) bound  @xcite @xmath16 where @xmath17 for dis on nucleons ; @xmath18 for dis on heavy nuclear targets .",
    "this should be compared to the froissart bound for the case of hadron - hadron scattering , @xmath19 .    for comparison",
    ", estimates of the @xmath20-dependence based on the perturbative evolution equations do not possess saturation : the dglap predicts a fast growing @xmath20-dependence  @xcite @xmath21 and the bfkl framework  @xcite predicts the power - growing @xmath20-dependence @xmath22    the crucial parameter of the cgc model is the saturation scale @xmath23 , which gives the threshold for transition to saturation regime .",
    "the saturation scale @xmath23 comes into play as a universal parameter in many tasks .",
    "for example , in cgc explanation of the geometric scaling  @xcite in dis data from hera , the structure function @xmath24 is represented as a function of only one variable , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath25 .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : overview ]",
    "we give a brief overview of the model used for evaluations .",
    "in particular , we generalize the original framework of  @xcite to the finite nucleus case in order to consider the off - forward matrix elements . in section  [ sec : unintegrated - quark - gpds ] we evaluate the quark gpds , and in section  [ sec : dvcs - amplitude ] we evaluate the dvcs amplitude . in section [ sec : results - and - discussion ] we present our results and draw conclusions .",
    "the basic assumption of cgc is that one can separate the partons into fast ( @xmath26 ) and slow ( @xmath27 ) ones , according to their light - cone fraction @xmath28 .",
    "the former are considered as classical `` sources '' , and the latter are the dynamical degrees of freedom in the model . in the leading order over @xmath12 one",
    "has just ordinary yang - mills equations for the gluon fields , in nlo one has a standard loop expansion .",
    "it is assumed that dynamics of the `` fast '' partons does not depend on the `` slow '' partons ; thus the configurations of the fast partons are _ random _ and one must _ average _ over all possible configurations of these `` sources '' @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is a color index , and @xmath20 is a coordinate .",
    "the weight functional @xmath31 $ ] encodes the dynamics of the `` fast '' subsystem and comes as an external parameter in the model .",
    "there are no restrictions on this functional except for the obvious gauge and lorentz invariance .",
    "an additional requirement of color neutrality , @xmath32    was introduced in  @xcite .",
    "it reflects the fact that the physical states are colorless .",
    "if we define @xmath33 as a scale which separates `` fast '' and `` slow '' partons , then the dependence of the functional @xmath31 $ ] on the scale @xmath33 will be described by a kind of `` renormgroup equation '' @xmath34}{\\partial\\tau}=\\frac{1}{2}\\int d\\vec{x}d\\vec{y}\\frac{\\delta}{\\delta\\rho^{a}(\\vec{x})}\\chi\\left(\\vec{x},\\vec{y}\\right)\\frac{\\delta}{\\delta\\rho^{b}(\\vec{y})}w[\\rho;\\tau]\\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath35 and @xmath36 is a complicated functional of the field @xmath37 .",
    "while in the general case this equation has not been solved so far , there are known solutions for some special ( asymptotic ) cases .",
    "conventionally @xmath31 $ ] is chosen in a gaussian form  @xcite @xmath38={\\cal n}\\exp\\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\int d\\vec{x}d\\vec{y}\\frac{\\rho^{a}(\\vec{x})\\rho^{a}(\\vec{y})}{\\lambda(\\vec{x},\\vec{y})}\\right),\\label{w : gaussian : general}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath39 is the normalization factor fixed from the condition @xmath40=1 $ ] and the function @xmath41 is either a constant or a function fixed with some additional assumptions .",
    "physically the function @xmath41 describes correlation of partons inside the target .",
    "it is obvious that in the infinite nuclear matter it may depend only on the relative distance , i.e.    @xmath42    in the general case , the shape of the function @xmath43 is unknown .",
    "however , the color neutrality condition  ( [ cgc : colorneutrality ] ) and the requirement that in the low parton density limit the model should reproduce bfkl predictions ( [ eq : bfkl : integrated ] ) , fix the short - distance and large - distance behaviour .",
    "it was proposed in  @xcite that one can use the interpolation    @xmath44    where @xmath45 is a numerical coefficient .",
    "there are also simpler versions of the model  @xcite , which neglect correlation of the partons , i.e.    @xmath46    where @xmath47 is some function  .",
    "this explains the choice of parameterization  ( [ eq : simple - lambdadefinition ] ) , where @xmath47 in previous formula must be strongly peaked around @xmath48 .",
    "quite often for simplicity it is assumed that the width might be completely neglected .",
    "a very interesting generalization of the framework to the finite width case may be found in  @xcite . ] . in subsequent sections",
    "we will consider first evaluation with a simple parameterization  ( [ eq : simple - lambdadefinition ] ) , and after that discuss , how the results change for the parameterization ( [ cgc : weight : finitewidth ] ) .",
    "the choice of the gaussian parameterization  ( [ w : gaussian : general ] ) enables us to evaluate all the results analytically .",
    "notice however , that  ( [ w : gaussian : general ] ) is explicitly @xmath49-even , i.e. the number of quarks is equal to the number of antiquarks _ inside any target _ in this model .",
    "this agrees with experimental fact that the quark and anti - quark parton densities are approximately equal at small @xmath0 . on the other hand , @xmath49-parity of  ( [ w : gaussian : general ] )",
    "implies that the model does not distinguish matter and antimatter and is not applicable to evaluation of some quantities .",
    "for example , the baryon number and electric charge of the target are exactly zero , since they are due to the valence quarks .    an interesting generalization of the gaussian parameterization  ( [ w : gaussian : general ] ) was discussed in  @xcite . in particular , it was found that for the model of @xmath50 independent noninteracting quarks the distribution is indeed gaussian , and the first correction is proportional to @xmath51 , where @xmath52 is defined from the anticommutator of the generators @xmath53 of the group , @xmath54 .",
    "however , for the dvcs and singlet gpds discussed in this paper the @xmath49-odd correction does not contribute .",
    "it is well - known that at high - energies , the real part of scattering amplitudes is suppressed by the slow energy dependence of the amplitude compared to the imaginary part  @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is sufficient to consider only the imaginary part . actually , as we shall show in sect .",
    "[ sec : dvcs - amplitude ] , the real part of the dvcs amplitude in the cgc model is exactly zero .",

    "we are interested in dvcs  off - forward reaction , we can no longer use the infinite nuclear matter approximation .",
    "indeed , the dvcs cross section off a nuclear target rapidly decreases as one increases the momentum transfer @xmath6 . as a result ,",
    "the sizable cross - sections exist only for @xmath61 , where @xmath62 is the nuclear radius . in the infinite nuclear matter , all the off - forward cross - sections vanish   for all observables in the original framework of  @xcite in the infinite nuclear matter limit . ] .",
