    "the current idea of a _ negative - pressure _ dominated universe seems to be inevitable in light of the impressive convergence of the recent observational results ( see , e.g. , @xcite for a review ) .",
    "this in turn has led cosmologists to hipothesize on the possible existence of an exotic dark component that not only would explain these experimental data but also would reconcile them with the inflationary flatness prediction ( @xmath0 ) .",
    "this extra component , or rather , its gravitational effects is thought of as the first observational piece of evidence for new physics beyond the domain of the standard model of particle physics , a conclusion that has given rise to many speculations on its fundamental origin @xcite .    alternatively , another possible route to deal with this dark pressure problem could be a modification in gravity instead of any adjustment to the energy content of the universe .",
    "this idea naturally brings to light another important question at the interface of fundamental physics and cosmology : extra dimensions . as is well known the existence of extra dimensions is required in various theories beyond the standard model of particle physics , especially in theories for unifying gravity and the other fundamental forces , such as superstring or m theories . as suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite , extra dimensions may also provide a possible explanation for the huge difference between the two fundamental energy scales in nature , namely , the electroweak and planck scales [ @xmath1 ( see also @xcite ) .    in the cosmological context",
    ", the role of extra spatial dimensions as source of the dark pressure is translated into the so - called brane world ( bw ) cosmologies @xcite .",
    "the general principle behind such models is that our 4-dimensional universe would be a surface or a brane embedded into a higher dimensional bulk space - time on which gravity and only gravity could propagate .",
    "brane world scenarios has been a topic of much interest recently . in @xcite , for instance , a class of bw models which admit a wider range of possibilities for the dark pressure than do the usual dark energy scenarios was investigated .",
    "an interesting feature of this class of models is that the acceleration of the universe can be a transient phenomena , which could help reconcile the supernova evidence for an accelerating universe with the requirements of string / m - theory @xcite .",
    "another particularly interesting scenario is the one proposed by dvali _",
    "@xcite , which we will refer to it as dgp model .",
    "it describes a self - accelerating 5-dimensional bw model with a noncompact , infinite - volume extra dimension in which the whole dynamics of gravity is governed by a competition between a 4-dimensional ricci scalar term , induced on the brane , and an ordinary 5-dimensional einstein - hilbert action . for scales below a crossover radius @xmath2 ( where the induced 4-dimensional ricci scalar dominates ) ,",
    "the gravitational force experienced by two punctual sources is the usual 4-dimensional @xmath3 force whereas for distance scales larger than @xmath2 the gravitational force follows the 5-dimensional @xmath4 behavior .",
    "the theoretical consistency of the model , and in particular of its self - accelerating solution , is still a matter of debate in the current literature ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . from the observational viewpoint ,",
    "however , dgp models have been sucessufully tested in many of their predictions , ranging from local gravity to cosmological observations @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we are particularly interested in testing the viability of dgp scenarios in light of the latest supernova ( sne ia ) data , as provided recently by riess _",
    "the sample used , which consists of 157 _ gold _ events distributed over the redshift interval @xmath5 , is the compilation of the best observations made so far by the two supernova search teams plus 16 new events observed by _",
    "hst_. in agreement with other independent analyses , it is shown that these models constitute a good explanation for the current sne ia observations and , hence , that the presence of extra dimensions may provide a viable alternative for the dark pressure problem .",
    "in dgp models , the modified friedmann s equation due to the presence of an infinite - volume extra dimension reads @xcite @xmath6^{2 } = h^{2 }   + \\frac{k}{r(t)^{2}},\\ ] ] where @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 are , respectively , the curvature parameter of the spatial section , the cosmological scale factor , the hubble parameter and the energy density of the cosmic fluid ( which we will assume to be composed only of nonrelativistic particles ) . the crossover scale defining the gravitational interaction among particles located on the brane is expressed as @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the planck mass and @xmath13 is the 5-dimensional reduced planck mass .",
    "note that whenever the condition @xmath14 is valid , dgp and standard models are analogous so that the cosmological evolution for the early stages of the universe ( when the above condition holds ) is exactly the same in both scenarios .",
    "equation ( 1 ) also implies that the normalization condition is given by @xmath15^{2 } = 1\\ ] ] where @xmath16 and @xmath17 are , respectively , the matter and curvature density parameters ( defined in the usual way ) and @xmath18 is the density parameter associated to the crossover radius @xmath2 . for a flat universe ( @xmath19 ) , eq .",
    "( 2 ) reduces to @xmath20 .    0.1 in    0.1 in    in order to study the acceleration phenomenon in these scenarios we derive the deceleration parameter , defined as @xcite @xmath21 where @xmath22 stands for @xmath23 , @xmath2 and @xmath7 and the dimensionless function @xmath24 is given by @xmath25^{1/2}.\\ ] ] from the eqs .",
    "( 4 ) and ( 5 ) , it is possible to obtain the transition redshift @xmath26 at which the universe switches from deceleration to acceleration or , equivalently , the redshift at which the deceleration parameter vanishes .",
    "regardless of the geometry adopted , @xmath26 can always be expressed in a closed analytic form , i.e. , @xmath27 if now we restrict our analysis to the flat case , in accordance to cmb measurements @xcite , and assume @xmath28 ( @xmath29 ) , as suggested by clustering estimates @xcite , eq .",
    "( 6 ) provides @xmath30 , which is surprisingly close to the transition redshift estimated from the current sne ia data , i.e. , @xmath31 @xcite ( see also @xcite for other recent estimates of @xmath32 ) . for the sake of comparison , we also compute @xmath32 for the so - called concordance model , namely , a flat universe with @xmath33 and a vacuum energy contribution of @xmath34 ( @xmath35cdm ) .",
    "such a model yields @xmath36 , which is off by @xmath37 from the central value estimated in @xcite .    in fig .",
    "1a we show the @xmath38 plane for the transition redshift lying in the interval @xmath39 , which corresponds to @xmath40 of the value for @xmath32 given in @xcite .",
    "note that a considerable portion of this parameter space is compatible with such a constraint .",
    "the vertical hachured rectangle stands for the estimate of matter density parameter as provided by wmap , i.e. , @xmath41 @xcite .",
    "in particular , for the best - fit values of @xmath16 and @xmath42 obtained from the current gravitational lensing data @xcite we find @xmath43 while for those estimated from recent dating of high-@xmath44 objects @xcite we obtain @xmath45 . for comparison , we show in fig . 1b a similar analysis for @xmath35cdm scenarios ( whose expression for the transition redshift is given by @xmath46 ) . as mentioned earlier , the point corresponding to the concordance model ( @xmath33 , @xmath34 ) is outside the region covered by the estimate of @xmath32 considered .",
    "in this section we test the viability of dgp scenarios through a statistical analysis involving the most recent sne ia data , as provided recently by riess _",
    "the total sample presented in @xcite consists of 186 events distributed over the redshift interval @xmath5 and constitutes the compilation of the best observations made so far by the two supernova search teams plus 16 new events observed by _",
    "this total data - set was divided into `` high - confidence '' ( _ gold _ ) and `` likely but not certain '' ( _ silver _ ) subsets . here",
    ", we will consider only the 157 events that constitute the so - called _ gold _ sample . in",
    "what follows we briefly outline our main assumptions for this analysis ( see @xcite for some recent sne ia analyses ) .",
    "the predicted distance modulus for a supernova at redshift @xmath44 , given a set of parameters @xmath47 , is @xmath48 where @xmath23 and @xmath49 are , respectively , the apparent and absolute magnitudes , the complete set of parameters is @xmath50 and @xmath51 stands for the luminosity distance ( in units of megaparsecs ) , @xmath52,\\ ] ] with @xmath53 being a convenient integration variable , @xmath54 the expression given by eq .",
    "( 6 ) and @xmath55 a function defined by one of the following forms : @xmath56 , @xmath57 , and @xmath58 , respectively , for open , flat and closed geometries .",
    "we estimated the best fit to the set of parameters @xmath47 by using a @xmath59 statistics , with @xmath60^{2}}{\\sigma_i^{2}}},\\ ] ] where @xmath61 is given by eq .",
    "( 7 ) , @xmath62 is the extinction corrected distance modulus for a given sne ia at @xmath63 , and @xmath64 is the uncertainty in the individual distance moduli , which includes uncertainties in galaxy redshift due to a peculiar velocity of 400 km / s . the hubble parameter @xmath65 is considered anuisance \" parameter so that we marginalize over it by using the analytical method of ref . @xcite .",
    "figure 2a shows the confidence regions ( @xmath66 , @xmath67 and @xmath68 ) in the @xmath38 plane by considering the _ gold _ sample of riess et al .",
    "compared to fig . 1 of @xcite and fig",
    ". 2 of @xcite ( which used the then available sne ia data ) , the _ gold _ sample studied here reduces considerably the area corresponding to the confidence intervals .",
    "the best - fit parameters for this analysis are @xmath69 and @xmath70 with @xmath71 ( @xmath72 degrees of freedom ) . at 95% c.l .",
    "we obtain @xmath73 and @xmath74 .",
    "in particular , the above relative value of @xmath75 is slightly smaller than the one we found for the concordance scenario , @xmath76 , and equal to the value we obtained for the @xmath35cdm with arbitrary curvature . by restricting the analysis to the flat case",
    ", we note that the data favour a lower value of the matter density parameter , i.e. , @xmath77 ( @xmath78 ) with @xmath79 .",
    "such a value , however , is inside the 2@xmath80 interval of the current wmap estimates of the quantity of matter in the universe , @xmath41 @xcite , and therefore does not imply any possible conflit between the predictions of the model and the independent measurements of @xmath16 ( see @xcite for a discussion on this point ) .    by using sne ia - independent constraints in the @xmath38 plane yields more precise limits on these parameters due to the degeneracy between them for sne ia data .",
    "thus , in fig .",
    "2b we show a similar analysis to fig .",
    "2a having assumed a gaussian prior on the matter density parameter , @xmath41 , as provided by wmap team @xcite .",
    "the parameter space now is considerably reduced relative to the former analysis , with the best - fit model occurring at @xmath81 and @xmath82 ( @xmath83 ) .",
    "such a model corresponds to an accelerating universe with @xmath84 and a total expanding age of @xmath85 gyr .",
    "note that the best - fit value for @xmath42 leads to an estimate of the crossover scale @xmath2 in terms of the hubble radius @xmath86 ( see eq .",
    "3 ) , @xmath87 which is slightly smaller than the one obtained in ref . @xcite by using the old sne ia data ( see also @xcite for summary of the current estimates of @xmath2 ) . by fixing @xmath19",
    ", we find @xmath88 ( @xmath89 ) with @xmath90 .",
    "this particular value of @xmath42 corresponds to a crossover distance between 4-dimensional and 5-dimensional gravities of the order of @xmath91 . in table",
    "i we summarize the main results of the paper .",
    "lcrl test & @xmath16 ( flat ) & @xmath42 ( flat ) & @xmath92 ( flat ) +   + sne ia & 0.33 ( 0.21 ) & 0.24 ( 0.156 ) & 1.02 ( 1.26 ) + sne ia + @xmath16 & 0.28 ( 0.23 ) & 0.21 ( 0.148 ) & 1.09 ( 1.30 ) +",
    "the results of observational cosmology in the past years have opened up an unprecedented opportunity to establish a more solid connection between fundamental physics and cosmology .",
    "surely , the most remarkable finding among these results comes from sne ia observations which suggest that the cosmic expansion is undergoing a late time acceleration .",
    "such a phenomenon has been often explained from two different ways , i.e. , either by considering the presence of a negative - pressure dark component , the so - called dark energy , or by assuming the existence of extra spatial dimensions , as motivated by recent developments in particle physics . in this paper",
    "we have followed the second route .",
    "we have studied the transition ( deceleration / acceleration ) epoch in the context of dgp models and shown that these scenarios based on a large scale modification of gravity are in good agreement with the current sne ia data for values of @xmath93 and @xmath94 ( 95.4% c.l . ) . by assuming a sne ia - independent constraint on the matter density parameter , we have found @xmath82 , leading to an estimate of the crossover scale @xmath95 .",
    "if flatness is imposed , then we find @xmath88 ( @xmath89 ) , which corresponds to a acceleration universe with @xmath84 and a total expanding age of @xmath96 gyr .    in summary",
    ", what we have shown is that at least at the level of background tests ( like tests involving sne ia measurements ) , dgp models constitute a viable alternative for the dark energy or dark pressure problem .",
    "this may be understood as an indication that the existence of extra dimensions play an important role not only in fundamental physics but also in cosmology .",
