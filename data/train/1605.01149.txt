    "[ a ] although renormalization group equation of quantum field theory @xcite exhibits self - similarity @xcite , it is not yet established rigorously in qcd , the accepted fundamental quantum field theory of strong interaction .",
    "however because of its wide applicability in other areas of physics @xcite including condensed matter physics , its applicability in the study of structure of the proton is worth pursuing at least at phenomenological level . in the middle of 1980 s ,",
    "the notion of fractals has found its applicability in hadron production process @xcite when the self - similar nature of hadron multi - particle production process was suggested . specifically in 1990",
    ", bjorken @xcite highlighted the fractality of parton cascades leading to the anomalous dimension of phase space .",
    "relevance of these ideas in the contemporary physics of dis has been first noted by dremin and levtchenko @xcite in early 1990 s where it was shown that the saturation of hadron structure function at small _ x _ may proceed faster if the highly packed regions of proton have fractal structures .",
    "however , it was lastovicka@xcite in 2002 , who first suggested the self - similarity as a possible feature of multipartons in the proton specially in the kinematical region of small bjorken _",
    "x _ , which in later years was pursued in ref @xcite .",
    "specifically how quarks and gluons share the momentum fractions of the proton in self - similar way was studied in @xcite , large _ x _ behavior of parton distribution functions ( pdf ) and double parton distribution functions ( dpdf ) in @xcite , and froissart saturation in @xcite .",
    "one of the apparent limitations of the phenomenological analysis of ref@xcite is that it has a singularity at @xmath3 which is well within the kinematical range @xmath4 .",
    "however such singularity is not a common expectation from any physically viable model of proton structure function @xmath5 .    in the present paper ,",
    "we therefore make a re - analysis of the model of ref@xcite , demanding it to be singularity free in the entire @xmath6-range of @xmath4 . to that end",
    "we will use the more recently complied hera data@xcite , instead of analysis of ref@xcite where as previously reported data were used ref@xcite . in section [ b ] , we outline the formalism , and in section [ c ] , we discuss the results and compare the two version of the model and their limitations . a plausible way of removing the limitations of the models is suggested in section [ d ] through a reconstruction of the defining transverse momentum dependent parton distributions ( tmdpdf ) . specifically , we show that the proper generalizations and initial conditions on them not only remove the undesired singularity but also results in a qcd compatible structure function with logarithmic growth in @xmath2 . the phenomenological range of validity is then found to be much larger than the earlier versions .",
    "section [ e ] contains the conclusions .",
    "the self - similarity based model of the proton structure function of ref@xcite is based on transverse momentum dependent parton distribution function(tmd ) @xmath7 . here",
    "@xmath8 is the parton transverse momentum squared .",
    "choosing the magnification factors @xmath9 and @xmath10 , it is written as @xcite @xmath11= d_1.\\log\\frac{1}{x}.\\log\\left(1+\\frac{k_t^2}{k_0 ^ 2}\\right)+d_2.\\log\\frac{1}{x}+d_3.\\log\\left(1+\\frac{k_t^2}{k_0 ^ 2}\\right)+d_0^i\\ ] ] + where _ i _ denotes a quark flavor .",
    "here @xmath12 are the three flavor independent model parameters while @xmath13 is the only flavor dependent normalization constant .",
    "@xmath14(=1 gev@xmath15 ) is introduced to make ( pdf ) @xmath16 as defined below ( in eqn [ e2 ] ) dimensionless .",
    "the integrated quark densities then can be defined as @xmath17 + as a result , the following analytical parametrization of a quark density is obtained by using eqn([e2 ] ) @xcite : * ( model 1 ) * @xmath18 where @xmath19 + is flavor independent . using eqn([e3 ] ) in the usual definition of the structure function @xmath5 , one can get @xmath20 or it can be written as @xmath21 + where @xmath22 + eqn([e5 ] ) involves both quarks and anti - quarks . as in ref@xcite we use the same parametrization both for quarks and anti - quarks . assuming the quark and anti - quark have equal normalization constants , we obtain for a specific flavor @xmath23 + it shows that the value of @xmath24 will increase as more and more number of flavors contribute to the structure function .",
    "+ with @xmath25 and 5 it reads explicitly as @xmath26 + since each term of right hand sides of eqn([ec]),([ed ] ) , and ( [ ef ] ) is positive definite , it is clear , the measured value of @xmath24 increases as @xmath27 increases .",
    "however , single determined parameter @xmath24 can not ascertain the individual contribution from various flavors .",
    "+   + from hera data @xcite , eqn([e6 ] ) was fitted in ref@xcite with @xmath28    in the kinematical region , @xmath29      the defining equations of the model of ref@xcite ( eqn [ e1]-[e4 ] above ) do not ascertain the numerical values and signs of the parameters @xmath30 s. these are determined from data@xcite leading to the set of eqn([e7 ] ) in the kinematic range ( eqn [ e8 ] ) .",
    "however , the phenomenological analysis has one inherent limitation : due to the negative value of @xmath31 , eqn([e6 ] ) develops a singularity at @xmath32 @xcite as it satisfies the condition @xmath33 , contrary to the expectation of a physically viable form of structure function .    redefining the model parameters",
    "@xmath30 s by @xmath34 s ( _ _ j__=1,2,3 ) and ( pdf ) @xmath16 by @xmath35 and also structure function @xmath5 by @xmath36 in the present model , we get the following forms of pdf and structure function as : * ( model 2 ) *    @xmath37    and @xmath38 respectively .",
    "to determine the model parameters @xmath39 we have used the compiled hera data @xcite instead of earlier data @xcite used in ref@xcite .",
    "the more recent hera communication @xcite do not give additional new information of structure function with the kinematical region .",
    "following the procedure of ref@xcite , we make @xmath40-analysis of the data and obtained the more restrictive range of @xmath2 and _ x _ : @xmath41 10 gev@xmath15 and @xmath42 respectively with the fitted parameters given in the table [ table4 ] .",
    "the number of data points of @xmath43 is 95 .    in fig [ fig1 ] , we plot @xmath44 of model 2 as a function of @xmath6 for six representative values of @xmath2 ( @xmath2= 1.5 , 2.7 , 3.5 , 6.5 , 8.5 , 10 gev@xmath15 ) in the phenomenologically allowed range 0.85 @xmath45 10 gev@xmath15 .",
    "we also show the corresponding available data from ref@xcite .",
    "it shows that the model parameters have more restrictive constraints . due to positivity",
    ", the range of validity shrinks to @xmath46 gev@xmath15 from @xmath47 gev@xmath15 .",
    "thus our analysis indicates that the phenomenological range of validity of the present version ( model 2 ) is more restrictive than the previous version ( model 1 ) .",
    "+    .[table4]results of the fit of model 2 [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]      as in section [ 3b ] , we use the eqn(20 ) as illustrated example and for @xmath48 the form of tmds of models 4 and 6 are : @xmath49 with @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    "@xmath52 with @xmath53 and @xmath54 .    graphical representation of tmdpdfs of model 4 and 6 are given in fig [ f7 ] and [ f8 ] .",
    "it shows both the form of tmds have got desired @xmath55 fall without the burden of singularities as expected .",
    "the given form of pdfs for models 4 and 6 are : @xmath56 \\\\",

    "the models have proper @xmath57 rise .",
    "the rise of the structure function at small _ x _ is also compatible with regge based models @xcite .",
    "in this paper , we have made a comparative study of the two models of proton structure function based on self - similarity . the former model ( model 1 )",
    "has got its singularity at @xmath3 outside its phenomenological range of validity : _ x _ : @xmath58 . the later one ( model 2 )",
    "is completely free from singularity in the entire _",
    "x_-range @xmath4 , but has a very restrictive phenomenological range of validity : @xmath2 : @xmath41 10 gev@xmath15 . at phenomenological level ,",
    "the former one is thus better than later .",
    "the corresponding tmds are then studied and the main difference is observed : the singularity free version of the model ( model 2 ) results in a tmd which does not have the expected qualitative feature , while the other one ( model 1 ) has . in order to remove the anomalies , we have generalized the definition of a defining magnification factor in tmd such that it has expected qualitative feature ( model 3 ) . in a specific case , where the defining parameters of the generalized tmd satisfy certain specific conditions among them ,",
    "then the resulting structure function ( model 4 ) has also logarithmic rise in @xmath2 as expected in any qcd compatible model , instead of power laws of previous models ( model 1 , 2 , and 3 ) without addition of any new parameters .",
    "the model has now got larger phenomenological range of validity in @xmath2 than the earlier ones .    assuming that the notion of self - similarity can be smoothly extrapolated into larger _ x _ , we have also obtained a model at large and small _ x _ ( model 5 ) for tmdpdf / pdf and structure function . as in previous case at small _",
    "x _ ( model4 ) , under specific condition amongst its model parameters , @xmath57 rise in the resulting structure function ( model 6 ) emerges .",
    "the extrapolated model has also been tested with combined hera data @xcite and wider phenomenological range of @xmath6 and @xmath2 has been obtained as expected .",
    "let us end this section with the theoretical limitation of the present work . as noted in the introduction ,",
    "self - similarity is not a general property of qcd and is not yet established either , theoretically or experimentally . in this work ,",
    "we have merely used the notion of self - similarity in parametrize tmds and pdfs as a generalization of the method suggested in ref@xcite and have shown that under specific conditions among the defining parameters , logarithmic rise in @xmath2 of structure function is achievable even in such an approach , compatible with qcd expectation and has wider phenomenological ( @xmath59 ) range of validity .",
    "it presumably implies that while self - similarity has not yet been proven to be a general feature of qcd , under specific conditions , experimental data can be interpreted with this notion as has been shown in the present paper .",
    "however , to prove it from the first principle is beyond the scope of the present work .",
