    "the study of non - gaussianities in the primordial curvature perturbation @xmath0 is a subject of major interest in modern cosmology because the evaluation of the non - gaussianity ( ng ) parameters provide criteria to discriminate among the many models proposed to explain the origin of the large - scale structure that we observe today@xcite .",
    "particular attention has been paid to the study of a consistency relation between the @xmath2 and @xmath3 parameters@xcite , the suyama - yamaguchi ( sy ) consistency relation ( @xmath5 at least at tree level ) , because its violation would rule out many of the popular models of inflation .",
    "so far , it has been shown that this consistency relation works , in principle , on models that only include scalar fields@xcite under just a few assumptions , but there is no any conclusive result for models that include other type of fields , for instance , vector fields ( vf ) .",
    "vector field models are particularly interesting because they are suitable candidates to explain the apparent violation of statistical isotropy observed in recent analysis of data from the wmap satellite@xcite , given that vf define inherently a preferred direction for the expansion , for the distribution of primordial fluctuations , or for both@xcite .",
    "because of this reason , it is pertinent to study consistency relations in models that include scalar fields as well as vector fields as these not only include ng parameters but also the amount of primordial statistical anisotropy @xmath6 @xcite .    the main purpose of this paper is to find out how the well known sy consistency relation , valid for models involving only scalar fields under just a few assumptions , is modified when including vf . to this end , we do a complete tree level calculation of the @xmath2 and @xmath3 parameters based on the @xmath1 formalism@xcite , and concentrate on the isotropic pieces of these parameters since these are the ones that are currently constrained by observations . under almost the same few assumptions made in the scalar fields case , and although the vf do contribute to the isotropic pieces of the ng parameters , we prove that the sy consistency relation is still obeyed , at least at tree level .",
    "finally , the modified sy consistency relations for other ways of defining the ng parameters , which could be observationally relevant when taking into account the level of statistical anisotropy , are obtained .",
    "in the presence of vf , part or even all of the primordial curvature perturbation @xmath0 can be generated by vector field perturbations . in such scenarios ,",
    "the curvature perturbation can be calculated through the @xmath1 formalism as an expansion in the perturbations of the fields a few e - folds after horizon exit@xcite : n = n_a a_a + n_a b a_a a_b + n _",
    "abc a_a a_b a_c +  , where @xmath7 is the number of e - folds during inflation and @xmath8 are the derivatives of @xmath7 with respect to @xmath9 . in the previous expression , and in order to avoid notational clustering , we have assumed that there is only one scalar and one vector field ; thus , @xmath10 for @xmath11 , and @xmath12 , the latter being the spatial components of the vector field , for @xmath13 @xcite , where these field perturbations are calculated in a flat slicing ( the threading must be the comoving one ) .",
    "the extension of the results found in this letter to the case of several scalar and vector fields is straightforward .",
    "the power spectrum ( ps ) of the primordial curvature perturbation @xmath0 is defined as : [ twopoint ] ( k_1 ) ( k_2 ) & = & ( 2)^3 ( k_12 ) p_(k_1 ) + & = & ( 2)^3 ( k_12 ) _ ( k_1 ) , where @xmath14 is the _ dimensionless power spectrum _ , and @xmath15 .",
    "the statistical anisotropy in @xmath0 , due to the existence of a preferred direction @xmath16 , can be parametrized by a function @xmath6 as follows@xcite : _ ( ) = p _ ^iso(k)(1+g_()^2 ) , where @xmath17 denotes the isotropic part of the ps and the vectors @xmath18 and @xmath16 are of unit norm .",
    "the first assumption we will make is that the ng in the field perturbations is negligible , i.e. , the ng is generated due to the superhorizon evolution .",
    "the second assumption is to consider that the field perturbations are statistically isotropic , which is equivalent to the fact that there is no correlation between scalar and vector fields and that the expansion is isotropic@xcite .",
    "this may be reasonable as a good approximation in several cases@xcite , although it must be proven in each particular case , and is essential in the development of this paper because , otherwise , there would not exist any isotropic contributions to the ng parameters which are what really is constrained by observations .",
    "we shall adopt the notation a_a ( _ 1 ) a_b(_2 ) = ( 2)^3 ( k_12 ) _",
    "ab(_1 ) , with the components a_0 ( _ 1 ) a_0(_2 ) & = & ( 2)^3 ( k_12 ) p_(k_1 ) , + a_i ( _ 1 ) a_j(_2 ) & = & ( 2)^3 ( k_12 ) _",
    "ij(_1 ) , and zero otherwise . in the latter expression : @xmath19 where @xmath20 , and @xmath21 , @xmath22 being the longitudinal power spectrum and @xmath23 and @xmath24 being the parity conserving and violating power spectra respectively@xcite .",
    "the fact that none of @xmath25 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , and @xmath22 depend on the direction of the wavevector is a consequence of the second assumption .    at tree level , the ps is@xcite : [ ps - zeta ] p _ ( ) = n_a n_b _ ab ( ) . for concreteness",
    ", we shall restrict to the case of vector field perturbations which preserve parity , then , we just keep the @xmath23 and @xmath26 parts of the vector field power spectra .",
    "we also suppose that all the @xmath27 perturbations evolve in the same way after horizon crossing so that they have the same spectral index in their power spectra . in such conditions ,",
    "the longitudinal and the parity conserving power spectra are related by @xmath28 where @xmath29 is a scale independent number . with these considerations in mind ,",
    "the vector power spectra are : [ vps ] _ ij ( ) = p_+(k ) .",

    "otherwise , such corrections would be very important from the observational point of view .      for the @xmath2 parameter we can use the results ( [ isops ] ) , ( [ anisops ] ) , ( [ bs-1loop - iso ] ) , and ( [ bs-1loop - aniso ] ) to separate the isotropic and the anisotropic contributions as follows : @xmath44 . the labels i and ii are related to the isotropic and the anisotropic pieces of the bispectrum in ( [ bs-1loop - iso ] ) and ( [ bs-1loop - aniso ] ) respectively . using this decomposition",
    ", we can compare the @xmath45 and @xmath46 contributions by evaluating its ratio [ f - ratio ] & & _ 1 _",
    "l=1 ^ 2 f_l ( g_)^l + & = & g _ + & + & g_^2 . in the latter expression",
    ", we have used the expression in ( [ g - anis ] ) to write the series expansion in terms of the level of statistical anisotropy @xmath47 .",
    "the coefficients @xmath48 can be read off directly from the latter expression . using the ratio @xmath49 ,",
    "we can write the total @xmath2 as : @xmath50 , where @xmath51 is the piece of @xmath2 that depends only on the isotropic bs in ( [ bs-1loop - iso ] ) and the isotropic ps in ( [ isops ] ) . a very appealing feature that we can see from the previous analysis is that the ratio of the terms related to the anisotropic and the isotropic parts of the ng parameter @xmath2 depends on the parameters of the model ; for instance , it depends on the value of the ratio @xmath29 , the level of statistical anisotropy @xmath47 , and the shape of the triangle defined by the @xmath43 momenta .",
    "moreover , interestingly enough , for some values of @xmath47 and for some configurations of the momenta , the anisotropic contribution could be of the same order of magnitude as the isotropic piece and can not be neglected .      for the @xmath3 parameter",
    ", we apply the same decomposition related to the isotropic and anisotropic pieces that we did before with the @xmath2 parameter : @xmath52 .",
    "we follow the same steps that we did in the case of the @xmath2 parameter and write the ratio of both contributions as a series in powers of the @xmath47 parameter : the coefficients @xmath53 can be read off directly from the expression in ( [ tau - ratio ] ) .",
    "then , the @xmath3 parameter can be written as : @xmath54 , where @xmath55 is the part of @xmath3 that depends only on the isotropic ts in ( [ ts - iso ] ) and the isotropic ps in ( [ isops ] ) .",
    "the ratio again depends on the @xmath47 parameter and on the configuration described by the @xmath43 momenta .",
    "searching for relations between the ng parameters , we start exploring their isotropic pieces . here",
    "we give an explicit proof that the isotropic pieces of the ng parameters , in presence of scalar and vector field perturbations , obey the sy consistency relation@xcite . using the expressions in ( [ isops ] ) , ( [ bs-1loop - iso ] ) , and ( [ ts - iso ] )",
    "we find that : f_nl^(iso ) & = & , + _",
    "nl^(iso ) & = & . now , we can write the scale invariant power spectra @xmath56 as : @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the vector to scalar ps ratio . defining the vectors @xmath59 and @xmath60 , we evaluate the ratio @xmath61 : [ cr - iso ] a_nl = & = & 1 , + & & which implies : ^iso_nl(f^iso_nl)^2 .",
    "the latter expression is a direct consequence of the cauchy - schwartz inequality for the vectors @xmath62 and @xmath63 with the positive definite metric @xmath64 , and reflects the fact that the sy consistency relation , at least at tree level , applies for the isotropic pieces of the ng parameters even in the presence of vector fields .",
    "now , we can try to establish a relation for the complete ng parameters @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "the fact that the isotropic ng parameters obey the sy inequality implies that the total ng parameters obey a modified consistency relation .",
    "the modification to this relation will depend on several aspects , for instance , on the level of statistical anisotropy , the momenta configuration , etc . employing the sy inequality for the isotropic parameters",
    ", we deduce that the total ng parameters obey the relation : [ cr1 ] _ nl ( f_nl)^2 . on the other hand , the relation obeyed by the ng parameters @xmath65 and @xmath66 is the following : [ cr2 ] _nl ( f_nl)^2 .",
    "all of these relations represent a constraint on the ng and statistical anisotropy parameters for models of inflation that involve vector fields .",
    "in this paper , we have studied under which conditions new kinds of the well known sayama - yamaguchi consistency relation are allowed when vector fields are included in the inflationary dynamics .",
    "in particular we have shown that the isotropic pieces of the non - gaussianity parameters obey the suyama - yamaguchi consistency relation @xmath67 when its calculation is performed at tree level .",
    "we have also derived a modified consistency relation for the complete non - gaussianity parameters @xmath2 and @xmath3 and for a set of new parameters @xmath68 and @xmath69 that could be observationally relevant ; these relations are given by the eqs . and . since the latter depend on the level of statistical anisotropy and the configuration of the wavevectors , the naive relations @xmath70 and @xmath71 could eventually be violated in some particular inflationary model that includes vector fields .",
    "on this basis , we expect that in a near future the derived relations could provide a criteria to discriminate among the different models for the generation of the primordial curvature perturbation when vector fields are involved .",
