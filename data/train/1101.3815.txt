    "blazars are a sub - class of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) characterized by a prominent jet pointing within a few degrees of our line of sight @xcite . in many cases ,",
    "the jets are luminous over a wide range of wavelengths from radio to @xmath0-rays . due to the proximity of the jet axis to the line of sight , emission from the jet",
    "is relativistically beamed and hence amplified by an order of magnitude or more for many blazars .",
    "the observed timescales are also shorter than that in the rest frame of the jet plasma .",
    "most of the observed radio to optical ( and in some cases x - ray ) emission from the blazars is due to synchrotron radiation in the jet @xcite .",
    "x - rays and @xmath0-rays may be due to inverse compton scattering by the same energetic electrons radiating synchrotron emission ( the so called leptonic models ; e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) or due to synchrotron radiation by protons co - accelerated with the electrons in the jet , interactions of these highly relativistic protons with external radiation fields , or proton - induced particle cascades ( hadronic models ; e.g. * ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    in the leptonic model",
    ", the source of the seed photons that are being scattered may be the synchrotron photons generated within the jet , in which case it is termed synchrotron self - compton ( ssc ) process @xcite , or from outside the jet ( radiation from broad emission line region or blr , accretion disk , or dusty torus ) , termed external compton or ec process @xcite .",
    "time variability across multiple wavebands is a defining property of blazars and has been used to probe the location and physical processes related to the emission at very fine resolutions ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "most of the observed radiant energy produced in many blazars peaks in the @xmath0-ray part of the spectrum . but",
    "until recently , long - term and well sampled @xmath0-ray light curves of blazars were not available .",
    "expansion of such monitoring to a wide range of @xmath0-ray energies ( 20 mev to 300 gev ) is now occurring through the _ fermi gamma - ray space telescope _ which was launched in 2008 @xcite . the fermi bright source list from the first 11 months contains more than 600 @xcite and the _ fermi _ 2-yr catalog @xcite contains more than 1000 agns most of which are blazars .",
    "investigating the time variability of the data from fermi and supporting multi - frequency monitoring with statistically robust techniques is one of the most promising ways to understanding how and where the multi - wavelength emission is produced in the jets of blazars .",
    "for example , in the leptonic models , the low and high - energy variability should be correlated while in some versions of the hadronic models , this correlation may be weak or absent . for this reason ,",
    "multi - frequency monitoring programs are crucially important .    here",
    "we report on the yale / smarts optical  near ir monitoring program during 2008 - 2010 which has followed the variations in emission of the fermi - lat monitored blazars in the southern sky with closely - spaced observations ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for details of data acquisition and calibration ) .",
    "six blazars were detected for a sufficiently long interval by the fermi - lat during 2008 - 10 : ao 0235 + 164 , 3c 273 , 3c 279 , pks 1510 - 089 , pks 2155 - 304 , and 3c 454.3 .",
    "in order to quantify their variability properties , we calculate the power spectral density and the auto - correlation function , and carry out flare decomposition analysis of the smarts light curves of these six sources .",
    "we then compare the results with similar properties of the @xmath0-ray variability as discussed by @xcite who analyzed 11-month - long gev light curves of a sample of bright blazars from the fermi 3-month source catalog .",
    "possible models of emission may be distinguished by comparing the characteristics of the flux variations at lower ( e.g. optical - ir ) and higher ( e.g. @xmath0-ray ) energies",
    ".    the auto - correlation function ( acf ) can provide insights into the nature of variability .",
    "@xcite have shown that the acfs of the @xmath0-ray variability of a sample of bright blazars do not show any hint of quasi - periodicity or characteristic timescale . here",
    "we calculate the acfs of those six blazars to search for such a timescale in optical or near ir bands .",
    "comparison of the acf of the optical - ir variability with that of the @xmath0-ray variability can be used to understand the relation between the mechanism and location of emission in these wave bands .",
    "for example , in the leptonic models , the optical - ir and @xmath0-ray emission is generated by the same population of electrons .",
    "hence , it is expected that the width and shape of the acf will be very similar at both energies . however , some hadronic models are also able to reproduce this behavior and hence we can not exclude those models on this basis . in this paper , we calculate the acfs of the @xmath0-ray variability of those blazars as well to facilitate the comparison of the @xmath0-ray acfs to those at optical - ir wave bands .    power spectral density ( psd )",
    "analysis is a common technique to characterize time variability .",
    "the psd corresponds to the power in the variability of emission as a function of timescale .",
    "@xcite show that the psds of the @xmath0-ray light curves of a sample of bright blazars are well - described by simple power laws , corresponding to  red noise \" .",
    "red noise is defined as uncorrelated fluctuations where power density decreases with increasing frequency . in the case of an astronomical time",
    "series this translates to having larger amplitude variations at longer timescales .",
    "x - ray psds of seyfert galaxies and black hole x - ray binaries ( bhxrbs ) can be fit by a piece - wise power law , with a slope that steepens above a  break - frequency \" .",
    "the break - frequency is related to a characteristic timescale ( the origin of which is not well - understood ) that is proportional to the mass of the central black hole @xcite .",
    "we calculate the psd of the optical variation in these blazars in order to search for the existence of such a characteristic timescale .",
    "similar to the acfs , if the optical and @xmath0-ray emission is radiated by the same electrons , the shape and slope of the psd functions at these two energy - bands are expected to be similar . where well - sampled simultaneous light curves exist",
    ", we can compare the properties of the individual @xmath0-ray and optical - ir outbursts to investigate the nature of the emission mechanisms .",
    "the total energy output of an optical - ir flare can also be compared to that of the corresponding @xmath0-ray flare . to achieve this",
    ", we decompose the light curves into individual ( sometimes overlapping ) flares , similar to @xcite , each with exponential rise and decay .",
    "@xcite have also analyzed segments of fermi light curves of 10 sources to investigate the properties of individual flares .",
    "they found that most of the outbursts are symmetric in nature . in this paper , we use a slightly different algorithm to perform a similar analysis of the smarts r - band and fermi light curves of the six blazars in our sample .",
    "there are two main classes of blazars , namely , flat spectrum radio quasars ( fsrqs ) and bl lacertae type objects ( bl lacs ) .",
    "one of the main differences in the observable properties of these two classes is that the bl lacs have much weaker or no observable emission lines .",
    "this is probably due to different parent populations of this two classes , i.e. , fsrqs are linked with fr ii and bl lacs are with fr i radio galaxies @xcite .",
    "although the bright jet continuum emission complicates our view of the unbeamed thermal components @xcite , and it has caused some debate about the meaning of the bl lac  fsrq difference @xcite , it is now apparent that the majority of bllac objects have intrinsically less luminous thermal emission , pointing at some fundamental difference @xcite .",
    "a change in the properties of their central regions associated with a critical value of the mass accretion rate ( in eddington units ) has been proposed @xcite , and there are indications that it might hold for radio - galaxies , too @xcite .",
    "in addition to the fsrq / bl lac divide , the frequency of the synchrotron peak ( in @xmath2 vs. @xmath3 diagrams ) has emerged as one of the most important observational distinctions , leading to the classification of blazars based on its value , namely , low / intermediate / high synchrotron peak objects ( lsp / isp / hsp ) .",
    "@xcite showed that blazar seds seem to change systematically with luminosity : the most powerful objects are lsp , while hsp seds are associated with relatively weak sources .",
    "this result has been supported by studies of high - z blazars , low power objects and recently of @xmath0-ray selected samples @xcite , but more recent work suggests that the hypothesized relationship between sed peak and luminosity may be more complex than a simple sequence @xcite .    among the six blazars in our sample ,",
    "pks 2155 - 304 is a high - synchrotron - peaked bl lac type object and the rest are fsrqs as well as low - synchrotron - peaked objects .",
    "here we test if any significant difference exists between the multi - wave band variability properties of the fsrqs in our sample and that of pks 2155 - 304 . in ",
    "2 we calculate the auto - correlation functions of the optical , infrared , and @xmath0-ray light curves of our sample of six blazars while in  3 we present the power spectral analysis , its results and implications . in  4 we determine the shortest variability timescales present in our data .",
    "we model the flares in optical and @xmath0-ray light curves and discuss the properties of the flares in  5 while in  6 we compare the time variability properties of fsrqs and bl lacs . in  7 we decompose a segment each of contemporaneous fermi and smarts light curves of the blazar 3c 454.3 to investigate the nature of the outbursts and the corresponding emission processes .",
    " 8 presents the summary and conclusions .",
    "the @xmath0-ray light curves analyzed in this work are at 0.1 - 300 gev energy band and are taken from the _ fermi _ lat table of monitored sources provided by the _ fermi _ team .",

    "we use this to calculate the discrete auto - correlation function ( dacf ) of the variability of the blazars in our sample at @xmath0-ray energies , as well as b and j - band frequencies .",
    "the width of the acf may be related to a characteristic size - scale of the corresponding emission region , while equally spaced and repeated peaks or drops in the function shape can point out characteristic timescales and provide hints of possible quasi - periodicity .",
    "the optical - ir light curves obtained by smarts have seasonal gaps ( @xmath13 - 4 months ) due to the source going behind the sun .",
    "these large gaps distort the acf . to avoid this , for each of the six blazars , we select the longest segment without such large gaps and use them to calculate the acfs .",
    "the length of such segments were 200@xmath4250 days for all six blazars in our sample .",
    "this enables us to avoid distortion due to large data - gaps while keeping the resultant acf a significant representative of the nature of the entire light curve .",
    "the average sampling rate of the smarts light curves was one data point every 2 - 3 days .",
    "the light curves from fermi do not contain the sun - gaps but the blazar may not be consistently detected during the selected segments of the optical - ir light curves .",
    "therefore , while making the selection of the optical - ir segments , we chose those intervals when the blazar was detected by fermi at least once in 2 - 3 days on average so that the @xmath0-ray sampling is similar or better than that in the optical - ir bands .",
    "we chose the b and the j - band light curves for comparison with the @xmath0-rays since those are the bands with the widest separation among our data while the k - band data have a sampling frequency less than once in 2 - 3 days in some cases .",
    "the acf of a light curve depends on the temporal sampling as well as the intrinsic variability of the source .",
    "the sampling frequency in the j - band is better than that in the b - band .",
    "hence , we resampled the @xmath0-ray and j - band light curves with that in the b - band . to carry out the resampling , we remove data points from the @xmath0-ray and j - band light curve segments for which there are no corresponding b - band data point within @xmath5 days",
    "this was done to ensure that the comparison of the acfs is physically meaningful . in 3 out of 6 blazars in our sample ,",
    "namely , ao 0235 + 164 , pks 1510 - 089 , and 3c 454.3 , the b - band as well as the resampled @xmath0-ray and j - band light curves had a sampling of at least once in 3 days .",
    "the acfs of those 3 sources at all three wave bands are shown in figure [ acf1 ] . for the acf calculation , we use a bin - width of 5 days .",
    "we list the half - width at half maximum ( hwhm ) of the central peaks of the acfs in table [ acf_table ] .",
    "the acfs in all bands are very similar in shape for ao 0235 + 164 and 3c 454.3 . in pks 1510 - 089 ,",
    "the @xmath0-ray acf is slightly narrower in shape but the hwhm is very similar to the that in b and j - bands . since the temporal sampling in all 3 bands are the same , this is a comparison of the intrinsic variability properties of these three blazars .",
    "this shows that the characteristic size - scales of the corresponding emission regions in all three bands are similar which , in turn , may imply that the @xmath0-ray and optical - ir emission in these blazars is generated by electrons of similar energies .",
    "even initially homogeneous electron acceleration region will develop energy - dependent stratification due to the energy dependence of radiative loss timescales , i.e. , lower energy electrons naturally diffuse into a larger volume .",
    "similarly , a higher energy population of electrons will be in a smaller volume causing the acf width and characteristic timescales of variability to be smaller .",
    "figure [ acf2 ] presents the acfs of the other 3 blazars , namely , 3c 273 , 3c 279 and pks 2155 - 304 , for which resampled data were not used due to poor sampling . in 3c 273 ,",
    "the acfs at different bands are similar while in 3c 279 , the @xmath0-ray acf is significantly narrower .",
    "this may be an effect of the temporal sampling and can not be confirmed with the present data .",
    "the peak of the @xmath0-ray acf of the blazar 2155 - 304 is much smaller than the rest .",
    "this is because , the @xmath0-ray variation of this source was dominated by short - term flares uncorrelated to each other .",
    "this behavior is also reflected in the power spectrum of its variation as discussed in  3 .",
    "we do not find any significant peak in any of the acfs other than the central peak .",
    "that implies the absence of significant quasi - periodic behavior in the variability of these blazars in @xmath0-ray and optical - ir frequencies .",
    "we use a variant of the power spectrum response method ( psresp ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) to determine the intrinsic psd of the optical light curves .",
    "our realization of psresp is described in @xcite in details . here",
    "we briefly summarize the method .",
    "we start with an underlying model for the psd function , such as a simple power - law .",
    "then we simulate @xmath6 light curves starting from this underlying model using the technique described in @xcite .",
    "we use @xmath7 . we resample these simulated light curves with the sampling window of the observed light curve .",
    "we also add other noise to the simulated light curves which affect the real observations due to its finite length (  red noise leak \" ) and discontinuous sampling (  aliasing \" ) .",
    "then we calculate the psd of the real light curve ( denoted by psd@xmath8 ) and that of each of the simulated light curves ( denoted by psd@xmath9 , i=1 , n ) .",
    "we calculate the approximate value of the power due to poisson noise using the observational uncertainties and add that power to psd@xmath9 .",
    "we finally compare psd@xmath8 with the mean of the psd@xmath9 ( denoted by @xmath10 ) weighted by the standard deviation in the distribution psd@xmath9 to determine the goodness of fit of the underlying model that we assumed at the beginning .",
    "the goodness of fit is quantified by the `` success fraction '' @xmath11 defined as the fraction of simulated light curves that successfully represent the observed light curve .",
    "we do this for a range of underlying models covering a large parameter space and determine the underlying model that provides the best - fit , i.e. , the highest @xmath11 .",
    "the observed psd suffers from the distorting effects of the finite length (  red noise leak \" ) and discontinuous sampling (  aliasing \" ) of the light curves as well as power generated by the temporal sampling .",
    "these are accounted for by the method that we use .",
    "similar to the acf calculation , we select the longest segments of smarts r - band light curves of the six blazars without seasonal gaps ( @xmath13 - 4 months ) .",
    "this is done in order to minimize the distortion of the power spectrum and to cover the largest possible range of timescales .",
    "the length of such segments were 200@xmath4250 days for all six blazars in our sample and the average sampling rate was one data point every 2 - 3 days .",
    "we chose the r - band for this calculation because among the optical bands it has the best sampling for all objects .",
    "figure [ psdall ] presents the psds of the six blazars and the corresponding power - law fits .",
    "the solid jagged line shown in figure [ psdall ] is psd@xmath8 and the filled circles with error bars are the mean ( @xmath10 ) and standard deviation of the distribution psd@xmath9 . the resampling and addition of the noise described above add extra power to @xmath10 causing the filled circles with error bars to be slightly higher than the underlying model ( dashed line ) at certain frequencies .",
    "the optical r - band psd of all blazars in our sample show red noise behavior , i.e. , there is higher amplitude variability on longer than on shorter timescales .",
    "we list the best - fit slope and success fraction of the psd of all blazars in table [ psd_table ] .",
    "the rejection confidence , equal to one minus the success fraction , is much less than 0.9 in all cases .",
    "this implies that a simple power - law model provides an acceptable fit to all the psds .",
    "we also fit a broken power - law model to all the psds , setting the low - frequency slope at @xmath12 and allowing the break frequency and the slope above the break over a wide range of parameters ( @xmath13 to @xmath14 hz and @xmath12 to @xmath15 , respectively ) while calculating the success fractions .",
    "this gives lower success fractions than the simple power - law model across the entire parameter space .",
    "hence , there is no significant break detected in the psd of any of the sources .",
    "we determine the optical psd up to the highest variational frequency that can be achieved with the existing data .",
    "a better constraint on the existence of a break in the optical psd might be achieved with a broader range of sampled frequencies .    among the blazars in our sample ,",
    "the @xmath16-band variability amplitude of 3c 273 was much smaller than the others during the time interval considered here .",
    "this is evident in the psd which shows that the power of variability in 3c 273 is about two orders of magnitude less than the average of the other blazars at all timescales .",
    "the psd of the blazar pks 1510 - 089 has a significantly flatter slope than the other blazars in our sample indicating larger amplitude of short - timescale variations .",
    "this trend is evident in the light curve of this blazar which is dominated by very large - amplitude flares of width a few days .",

    "@xcite found that the average slope of the best - fit power - law for a sample of 9 bright fsrqs is @xmath25 and that of 6 bright bl lacs is @xmath26 , similar to the slope we found .",
    "this is consistent with the model where the emission at @xmath0-ray energies and optical frequencies are both generated by electrons through synchrotron and inverse - compton processes , respectively , so that the nature of variability at these two bands is similar .",
    "the uncertainty in the individual as well as the average psd will decrease when more data are included and may reveal the existence of small difference in the amplitude of power between the @xmath0-ray and optical - ir variability at a given frequency .",
    "for example , the optical psd of the bl lac object pks 2155 - 304 is quite steep ( slope @xmath27 ) while the @xmath0-ray psd is much flatter ( see fig .",

    "this implies that the short - term ( few to 10 days ) variability in this blazar is more prominent at @xmath0-ray energies than at optical wave bands .",

    "the slower variability indicated by the longer doubling timescales in optical - ir bands than that in the @xmath0-rays is consistent with the narrower auto - correlation function of 3c 279 in the latter .",
    "this may imply that in 3c 279 , the inverse - compton ( ic ) @xmath0-ray emission is generated by a slightly higher energy population of electrons than the synchrotron optical emission . in pks 2155 - 304 ,",
    "the smallest timescales over which the optical - ir flux changed by a factor of 2 is @xmath130 days , again suggesting slower variability in these wave bands similar to the steeper power spectral slope in optical - ir than that in the @xmath0-rays as found in  3 .",

    "for example , the acceleration of electrons due to the presence of instability in the jet could increase n@xmath64 .",
    "alternatively , stochastic injection of energy in the jet plasma from the central engine and its dissipation at different distances from the base of the jet @xcite could explain the observations as well .",
    "if the doppler beaming explanation is true , this adds to the increasing evidence that at least in some blazars , copious @xmath0-ray emission is produced farther down the jet and in those cases the blr can not be a significant source of seed photons which are inverse - compton scattered to @xmath0-ray energies by the energetic electrons in the jet .",
    "@xcite showed that during this high state in 2009 december , the @xmath0-ray flux from 3c 454.3 changed by a factor of @xmath15 on a 612 hr timescale .",
    "this implies that the size - scale of emission region , obtained from the variability timescale ( @xmath10.01 pc ) is smaller than the approximate cross - section of the jet of 3c 454.3 at 18 pc ( @xmath10.05 pc , assuming @xmath80@xmath10.2@xmath81 from @xcite ) .",

    "the flux does not change by a factor of 2 during this observing program which may also be a result of significant contribution from the disk in the optical - near ir emission of this object .",
    "+ ( 5 ) the variability properties , including the acf peak value , the relative nature of the short and long - term variability at @xmath0-ray and optical wave bands , and the doubling timescales are different in the bl lac 2155 - 304 from the fsrqs in our sample . this may be caused by : i ) the @xmath0-rays in pks 2155 - 304 are dominated by the ssc process unlike the fsrqs in which it is dominated by the ec contribution and ii ) the electrons generating the @xmath0-ray emission in this blazar are at a higher energy than those producing the optical - ir emission unlike the fsrqs where the gev and r - band emission is produced by electrons of similar energies . + ( 6 ) we decompose the optical - ir and @xmath0-ray light curves to investigate the properties of the individual flares present in those light curves .",
    "the prominent flares present in the optical - ir as well as the @xmath0-ray light curves of these blazars are predominantly symmetric , i.e. , have similar rise and decay timescales .",
    "this indicates that the the long - term variability is dominated by the crossing time of radiation or a disturbance through the emission region and not by the energy - loss time of the emitting electrons due to radiation losses .",
    "+ ( 7 ) finally , we perform a detailed decomposition of the smarts and fermi light curves of 3c 454.3 during and before its large outburst in 2009 december to understand how and where the emission in the prominent outbursts of blazars is generated",
    ". the total energy output , the ratio of @xmath0-ray to optical energy output , and the @xmath0-ray vs. optical flux relation of six individual flares of the blazar 3c 454.3 during 2009 august to december vary significantly from one event to the other . + ( 8) in 3c 454.3 , the smaller flares at both optical - ir and @xmath0-ray wave bands during 2009 august - november , and the subsequent large multi - frequency outburst in 2009 december , might be triggered by the movement of a plasma blob along a helical path in the jet and its subsequent interaction with a standing shock present in the jet , respectively .",
    "if this scenario is right , the location of the large @xmath0-ray outburst in 2009 december is identified at @xmath118 pc down the jet from the central engine , where a strong radio - emitting component is observed . this would pose strong constraints on the models of high energy emission in the jets of blazars .",

    "<S> these observations were carried out as a part of the yale / smarts program during 2008 - 2010 that has followed the variations in emission of the bright fermi - lat - monitored blazars in the southern sky with closely - spaced observations at bvrjk bands . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the optical - near ir variability properties are remarkably similar to those at the @xmath0-ray energies . </S>",
    "<S> the discrete auto - correlation functions of the variability of these six blazars at optical - ir and @xmath0-ray energies do not show any periodicity or characteristic timescale . </S>",
    "<S> the power spectral density ( psd ) functions of the r - band variability of all six blazars are fit well by simple power - law functions with negative slope such that there is higher amplitude variability on longer timescales . no clear break is identified in the psd of any of the sources . </S>",
    "<S> the average slope of the psd of r - band variability of these blazars is similar to what was found by the fermi team for the @xmath0-ray variability of a larger sample of bright blazars . </S>",
