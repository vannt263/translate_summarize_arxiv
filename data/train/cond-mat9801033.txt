    "the heisenberg model with random uniaxial single - site anisotropy is considered to be the proper model for studying amorphous alloys@xcite of non-@xmath13-state rare earths ( re ) and transition metals ( tm ) , such as tb@xmath14fe@xmath15 .",
    "the model was introduced by harris , plischke and zuckermann,@xcite who performed a mean - field calculation and found a ferromagnetic ( fm ) phase at low temperature .",
    "it was shown later by pelcovits , pytte and rudnick,@xcite using an argument parallel to that of imry and ma@xcite for the random field case , that such a fm phase is not stable in three dimensions .",
    "the actual behavior of this model in three dimensions has remained a subject of controversy .",
    "it was argued by some workers@xcite that there should be a low temperature ising spin - glass phase , but the numerical evidence for this was never convincing.@xcite it has recently been shown by migliorini and berker@xcite that in three dimensions the ising spin glass is destabilized by a random field . the spin glass phase , as it is usually envisioned , has spontaneously broken time - reversal symmetry ( i.e. the time - average expectation values of local moments do not vanish ) .",
    "therefore , one would expect that it should also be destabilized by random uniaxial anisotropy .",
    "an alternative scenario , first proposed by aharony and pytte,@xcite is that at low temperature there is a phase characterized by an infinite magnetic susceptibility and a power - law decay of two - spin correlations as a function of the distance between the two spins , but no true fm long - range order .",
    "this power - law decay of the two - spin correlations is called quasi - long - range order ( qlro ) . in the approximation of aharony and pytte , and its later elaboration by goldschmidt and aharony,@xcite it",
    "is claimed that the infinite - susceptibility phase occurs in the presence of random anisotropy , but not in the presence of a random field .",
    "this is rather problematic , as it requires that the infinite - susceptibility phase not break time - reversal symmetry .",
    "the relationship between the ordered states of random - field and random - anisotropy models is well known , as it provides the key step in the argument of pelcovits , pytte and rudnick.@xcite    in the last few years , monte carlo calculations have revealed that for the @xmath16 case ( where @xmath17 is the number of spin components ) there is a low temperature phase with power - law decay of two - spin correlations ( which will be referred to as the qlro phase ) for both the random uniaxial anisotropy@xcite and random field@xcite in three dimensions .",
    "the qlro phase is characterized by the small - wavenumber behavior of the magnetic structure factor @xmath18 \\quad , \\ ] ] where the expectation value @xmath19 indicates a thermal average and [ ] is an average over the alloy disorder .",
    "@xmath20 is the fourier transform of the magnetization . with the random field",
    "it was found that in the qlro phase the small * k * behavior of s(*k * ) goes as @xmath21 , and with the random uniaxial anisotropy it goes as @xmath22 .",
    "a spin - wave theory analysis would predict that this behavior should be the same .",
    "thus the fact that the power law is found to be different in the two cases demonstrates that vortex lines are controlling the behavior for @xmath16 with random anisotropy .",
    "the @xmath16 case with three - fold ( or higher ) random anisotropy retains a stable fm phase in three dimensions.@xcite    other papers which indicate the presence of qlro for @xmath16 are the monte carlo calculation of gingras and huse@xcite for the random field case , the high temperature susceptibility series of fisch and harris@xcite for the random anisotropy case , and the replica - symmetry breaking analysis of giamarchi and le doussal.@xcite the latter work actually studies the closely related problem of randomly pinned vortex lines in a dirty type - ii superconductor.@xcite    the existence of qlro for @xmath16 is not a big surprise , given our previous experience with the kosterlitz - thouless phase in the ( nonrandom ) two - dimensional xy model .",
    "however , the aharony - pytte - goldschmidt@xcite calculations find an infinite - susceptibility phase for any finite value of @xmath17 , independent of the existence of any topological defects .",
    "recently , a monte carlo calculation by the current author@xcite found a qlro phase with an s(*k * ) which goes as @xmath21 for the @xmath23 model in a random field in three dimensions . here",
    "we will extend this work to the case of @xmath23 spins with random anisotropy , and we will find the same result for the small * k * behavior of s(*k * ) as for the random field .",
    "the hamiltonian we study in this work is the obvious modification of the one previously used for the @xmath23 random field model.@xcite it consists of a fm heisenberg exchange term , with the addition of a cubic single - ion anisotropy term and a random - anisotropy term due to the alloy disorder .",
    "thus the form of the hamiltonian is @xmath24 where the sites @xmath25 form a simple cubic lattice and @xmath26 indicates a sum over nearest neighbors .",
    "the @xmath27 are spin indices , each @xmath28 is an independently chosen random unit vector , and the @xmath29 sites are a randomly chosen subset of the lattice containing a fraction @xmath2 of the sites .",
    "the @xmath29 sites represent the sites of the re atoms , while the remaining sites of the lattice contain the tm atoms .",
    "this ignores the fact that the re - tm alloys of interest here are amorphous rather than crystalline , but it is a reasonable first approximation . since the atoms are assumed to be immobile , the @xmath28 do not change with time . in this work we will study the limit in which @xmath30 is taken to infinity .",
    "the random anisotropy term is then a projection operator , and the spin on each of the @xmath29 sites is restricted to two states , parallel and antiparallel to the vector @xmath28 . for simplicity , we will assume that all of the spins are unit vectors and that the exchange couplings @xmath31 between all pairs of nearest neighbor spins are identical .",
    "our assumed values for the couplings are not close to the actual values in re - tm alloys,@xcite but they should still give the qualitative behavior correctly , due to universality .",
    "there are several reasons for including the cubic single - ion anisotropy term in the hamiltonian .",
    "the first is a matter of convenience . in order to improve the efficiency of the monte carlo program,@xcite and to make it easy to store states of the system for later analysis",
    ", we are going to discretize the phase space of the model .",
    "for each spin variable @xmath32 and each random anisotropy axis @xmath28 , we restrict the allowed states to be the twelve [ 110 ] unit vectors . we will refer to this discretization as the @xmath33 model .",
    "this discretization induces an effective cubic single - ion anisotropy term in the hamiltonian .",
    "the second reason is that the experimental samples of amorphous re - tm alloys are sputtered films which have some growth - induced anisotropy.@xcite understanding the effects of this weak anisotropy is a worthwhile exercise .",
    "the existence of the growth - induced anisotropy is crucial for the use of these films as magneto - optical memory devices.@xcite the third reason is that besides the amorphous re - tm alloys , we are also interested in crystalline spin - glass alloys like cumn,@xcite where a cubic single - ion anisotropy is present in the real materials .",
    "another discretized three - dimensional @xmath23 hamiltonian which combines cubic single - ion anisotropy and random uniaxial anisotropy has been studied previously.@xcite in that case only six states ( the [ 100 ] unit vectors ) were used .",
    "although the six - state discretization is too coarse to serve as a quantitative approximation to the heisenberg model , some indications of a qlro phase were found in that work .    a discussion from a renormalization - group viewpoint of the effects of having both a crystalline anisotropy and random uniaxial anisotropy has been given by mukamel and grinstein.@xcite they argued that a qlro phase could exist in this case between the fm and the paramagnet ( pm ) , as was later found by the monte carlo calculation for the @xmath16 case .",
    "they also discussed the difference between a discretized model in which all of the allowed axes are mutually orthogonal , such as the six - state model for @xmath23 , and finer discretizations such as the @xmath33 model , which are expected to provide approximations to a model without the crystalline anisotropy .",
    "since our @xmath33 discretization of the spin variables automatically builds a cubic anisotropy into the free energy , and we are primarily trying to understand the qualitative aspects of the ordering and not attempting a quantitative model of a particular experiment , we do not keep the @xmath34 term in the hamiltonian explicitly .",
    "thus , the hamiltonian is reduced to the simple form @xmath35 the random anisotropy term has been reduced to the constraint@xcite that for each site in the @xmath29 set the spin @xmath36 has only two allowed states , either parallel or antiparallel to the vector @xmath28 .",
    "because all of the @xmath32 are chosen from the [ 110 ] states , eq .",
    "( 3 ) has the useful property that the energy of every state is an integral multiple of 1/2 .",
    "thus it becomes easy to write a monte carlo program to study eq .",
    "( 3 ) which uses integer arithmetic to calculate energies . this , plus",
    "the fact that that each spin has only twelve possible states , gives substantial improvements in performance over working with the general form of eq .",
    "( 2 ) , for both memory size and speed . it is also be possible to use integer arithmetic if @xmath30 is chosen to be an integer.@xcite    the monte carlo program used two linear congruential pseudorandom number generators . in order to avoid unwanted correlations , the decision of whether or not a state was in the @xmath29 set was done using one of the generators , and the choice of the vector @xmath28 was made using the other .",
    "a heat bath method was used for flipping the spins , which at each step reassigned the value of a spin to one of its two allowed states if it was a member of the @xmath29 set , or to one of the twelve [ 110 ] states if it was not , weighted according to the boltzmann factors and independent of the prior state of the spin .",
    "@xmath0 simple cubic lattices with periodic boundary conditions were used throughout .",
    "the values of @xmath1 used ranged from 16 to 64 . away from any @xmath37 the samples were typically run for 10,240 monte carlo steps per spin ( mcs ) at each @xmath38 , with sampling after each 10 mcs .",
    "near a @xmath37 they were run several times longer .",
    "the initial part of each data set was discarded for equilibration . in some cases ,",
    "two different random field configurations with a given @xmath1 were studied for a given @xmath3 .",
    "this gives a rather crude estimate of the @xmath1 dependence of the various thermodynamic properties .",
    "we are forced to go to large @xmath1 for this problem by crossover effects . to do",
    "a high precision finite - size - scaling analysis would require studying many samples at each @xmath1 , which is very time - consuming for large @xmath1 .",
    "due to our discretization of the spins , in a ground state with @xmath39 essentially all of the spins are as aligned as possible along one of the [ 110 ] directions , consistent with the restriction that each @xmath29 spin be in one of its two allowed states .",
    "thus , in these cases it is easy to equilibrate the system at low temperatures by starting from an ordered configuration . for @xmath40 a sample with small @xmath1",
    "will spontaneously nucleate a [ 110 ] fm state upon cooling , but for @xmath41 this does not happen in the time available . when an @xmath41 sample with @xmath40 is slowly cooled to @xmath42 it nucleates a polydomain state .",
    "for @xmath43 , where the ground state is not a [ 110 ] fm state , it becomes extremely difficult to equilibrate large lattices at low temperatures .    in the absence of any external field ,",
    "the rotation of @xmath44 between different [ 110 ] directions is a slow process . in the presence of the random anisotropy the different [ 110 ]",
    "ferromagnetic gibbs states have different energies .",
    "because all of these twelve minima are equivalent , on the average , there is no need for the monte carlo program to average over them .",
    "if the system is started in a high - energy [ 110 ] direction , it will eventually jump to a more favorable direction , unless @xmath38 is so low that this does not happen in the time available .",
    "for @xmath45 there is no random anisotropy , and results for this case were presented earlier.@xcite monte carlo simulations with the random anisotropy were obtained for @xmath46 , 0.25 , 0.5 , 0.75 and 1.0 . a approximate picture of the phase diagram obtained from these results is shown in fig .  1 .",
    "the limit of stability of the [ 110 ] fm ground state is between @xmath40 and @xmath8 .",
    "the qlro phase exists for @xmath47 , but is unstable at @xmath12 .",
    "the [ 111 ] fm phase , which is stable at @xmath45,@xcite should also extend to small positive values of @xmath2 .",
    "the domain walls in this phase are broad and have a low cost in free energy .",
    "it is difficult to obtain meaningful numerical results for very small @xmath2 , due to crossover effects.@xcite the [ 111 ] fm - qlro phase boundary was not observed directly , and its existence is shown in fig .  1 as a dotted line .",
    "although for small @xmath2 the effective cubic anisotropy induced by our discretization favors the [ 111 ] directions , for @xmath2 near 0.5 the effective anisotropy favors the [ 100 ] directions .",
    "consequently , near @xmath40 the effective cubic anisotropy is very small .",
    "there is probably a [ 100 ] fm low temperature phase near @xmath8 .",
    "however , because it is so difficult to equilibrate large @xmath1 samples in this region of the phase diagram , the details are very uncertain .",
    "the qlro - to - pm transition is second order for @xmath47 .",
    "the energy at @xmath37 remains nearly constant along this part of the transition line , decreasing very slowly as @xmath2 increases .",
    "the shift of @xmath37 with @xmath2 is surprisingly small here ; at @xmath45 @xmath48 similar effects were observed in the @xmath16 random anisotropy case,@xcite but the random field cases are significantly different.@xcite at some @xmath49 @xmath37 begins to drop rapidly , and by @xmath12 the qlro phase has disappeared .",
    "the details of the sharp drop in @xmath37 are not clear , and they may depend on the presence of the effective cubic anisotropy , without which the [ 100 ] fm phase would be stable .    because in the presence of the random anisotropy the expectation values of the energies of different bonds are not the same , one certainly does not expect the energy at @xmath37 to remain exactly constant , independent of @xmath2 .",
    "unlike the random field , however , which causes spins to have nonvanishing expectation values even at high temperatures , the random uniaxial anisotropy does not produce major qualitative changes in the pm phase .",
    "therefore , it is not unreasonable that the limit of stability of the pm phase occurs at about the same value of the nearest neighbor two - spin correlation function , which is the energy in this model .",
    "recall that in a tree - diagram summation the energy at @xmath37 of the classical @xmath17-vector ferromagnet depends only on the lattice structure , and is independent of the number of spin components .    for the @xmath16 random anisotropy model it was found@xcite that the qlro phase exists on a simple cubic lattice@xcite even for @xmath50 , but",
    "here we see that qlro is less stable for @xmath23 random anisotropy .",
    "although the @xmath51 case is not ( to the author s knowledge ) of any experimental relevance , it would be quite interesting to know if it is possible to have a qlro phase for small nonzero @xmath2 in that case , and for larger finite values of @xmath17 .",
    "the author sees no reason why this should not be so .",
    "some authors@xcite have argued for the importance of hedgehog excitations in three - dimensional @xmath23 models , but this does not seem to hold up under detailed scrutiny.@xcite in a lattice model one can obtain equivalent effects by replacing the hedgehog fugacity with a nontopological multispin interaction , and this multispin interaction can be extended in a straightforward way to the @xmath51 case.@xcite    the behavior of the specific heat as @xmath2 is increased is shown in fig .  2 .",
    "the data displayed were obtained by numerically differentiating the calculated values of the energy with respect to @xmath38 .",
    "the specific heat was also computed by calculating the fluctuations in the energy at fixed temperature , yielding similar but noisier results .",
    "we see that the data for different samples with the same value of @xmath2 agree fairly well , although some differences are visible near the phase transitions .",
    "the sharp peaks which occur@xcite for @xmath45 become rounded as @xmath2 increases , and they move to lower @xmath38 . at @xmath46",
    "the behavior of the specific heat at the qlro - to - pm transition can be approximated by an effective critical specific heat exponent @xmath52 , with an amplitude ratio of 2.5 .",
    "the transition out of the [ 110 ] fm phase still appears to be first order at @xmath46 , although the latent heat is too small to measure accurately.@xcite it is likely that this transition actually goes into the [ 111 ] fm phase . at @xmath40",
    "there is substantial hysteresis at the [ 110 ] fm - to - qlro transition , which makes an accurate determination of the equilibrium thermodynamic properties near this transition impossible .",
    "the specific heat near the qlro - to - pm transition at @xmath40 , shown in fig .",
    "2(b ) , is remarkably similar to the specific heat recently reported for real amorphous re - tm films.@xcite the effective value of the critical specific heat exponent is now @xmath53 , and the amplitude ratio is again about 2.5 .",
    "it is well known@xcite that the introduction of randomness gives rise to effective critical exponents that appear to vary with @xmath2 . by @xmath8 the specific heat peak",
    "has become rather smeared out , but it still seems to be centered at the qlro - to - pm transition .",
    "the shoulder on the low temperature side of the peak in fig .",
    "2(c ) may be due to a transition from the qlro phase into a [ 100 ] fm phase .",
    "looking at the dependence of @xmath54 on @xmath2 and @xmath1 provides additional insight .",
    "the data for @xmath40 and @xmath8 are shown in fig .",
    "3 . in the [ 110 ]",
    "fm phase , @xmath54 is almost independent of @xmath1 , except very close to @xmath37 . in the [",
    "111 ] and [ 100 ] fm phases , @xmath54 becomes independent of @xmath1 only when @xmath1 is larger than the domain - wall thickness .",
    "in practice we do not satisfy this condition , and for accessible @xmath1 it becomes very difficult to distinguish the [ 111 ] and [ 100 ] fm phases from the qlro phase . in the qlro phase , @xmath54 decreases slowly as @xmath1 increases , probably decaying as @xmath55 . in the pm phase , @xmath54 decreases as @xmath56 , where @xmath57 is the ferromagnetic correlation length .    in fig .",
    "3 we see that for both values of @xmath2 the variation of @xmath54 with @xmath38 becomes increasingly sharp as @xmath1 increases .",
    "if one looks at finite - size scaling plots ( not shown ) , there is substantial scatter due to sample - to - sample fluctuations .",
    "however , in both cases the finite - size scaling is consistent with a divergence of @xmath57 as @xmath38 approaches @xmath37 in the pm phase , with an effective value of @xmath58 ( and therefore of @xmath59 ) which is indistinguishable from the standard @xmath23 heisenberg critical point value.@xcite the data can also be fit with @xmath60 .",
    "the effective values of @xmath61 are , however , about 0.8 at @xmath40 and 1.0 at @xmath8 . note that if one uses the effective value of @xmath61 found here for @xmath40 and the effective value of @xmath27 found in the specific heat , the josephson relation @xmath62 is satisfied within the accuracy of the estimates .",
    "there is no reason , however , why effective exponents should satisfy scaling relations exactly .",
    "we can get valuable information by looking at the magnetic structure factor s@xmath5 .",
    "the structure factor can be measured by x - ray and neutron scattering experiments .",
    "near @xmath37 the small - wavenumber behavior of the structure factor is expected to have the form @xmath63 as @xmath38 approaches @xmath37 in the pm phase , @xmath57 is expected to diverge like @xmath64 .",
    "s@xmath5 at @xmath37 for an @xmath41 sample with @xmath40 is shown on a log - log plot in fig .",
    "the exponent @xmath59 is seen to be very close to zero ; this is the same result that was found for this exponent in the @xmath16 random anisotropy case.@xcite    inside the qlro phase s@xmath5 appears to take on the form @xmath65 with @xmath66 , independent of @xmath38 .",
    "the @xmath67 term has replaced the @xmath68-function which would be found in the structure factor of a ferromagnet .",
    "the coefficient @xmath67 goes to zero continuously as @xmath38 approaches @xmath37 from below , presumably with an exponent @xmath69 . at @xmath40 where the effective cubic anisotropy is small ,",
    "@xmath57 is found to be immeasurably large in the qlro phase , which means that it must be large compared to @xmath41 .",
    "this is shown in fig .  5 , which displays s(*k * ) data from the same @xmath41 sample as in fig .  4 , but for lower @xmath38 .",
    "the data set shown with the + symbols was obtained by slowly cooling the lattice from above @xmath37 to @xmath70 . after discarding the initial part of the run , this state appears stationary on a timescale of @xmath71 mcs .",
    "it has @xmath72 , and an energy of @xmath73 .",
    "the fit of this data to a straight line with a slope of @xmath74 is excellent .",
    "the remaining data shown here were generated using a cold start initial condition , with the direction of * m * chosen to be approximately the same as for the slowly cooled state . at @xmath75 , which is within the [ 110 ] fm phase , @xmath76 and s(*k * ) is rather flat at nonzero * k*. upon warming this state up to @xmath42 , which is approximately equal to the fm - qlro transition point , @xmath54 has decreased to 0.757 , and s(*k * ) has increased at nonzero * k*.    using a cold start initial condition at @xmath70 results in a state which does not relax to equilibrium on accessible timescales . the data shown in fig .  5 with the diamond symbols fall on top of the equilibrium ( slow - cooled ) data for @xmath77 , but they are flat at smaller * k * , where relaxation times are long .",
    "these data have @xmath78 and an energy of @xmath79 , but there is a clear trend of decreasing @xmath54 and increasing energy with time .",
    "the rounded peak@xcite and slow relaxation@xcite of this state are quite reminiscent of the field - cooled state in the spin - glass phase of cumn alloys .",
    "for @xmath80 the ferromagnetic correlation length does not become larger than accessible values of @xmath1 at any temperature , and s(*k * ) can be fit by a simple lorentzian form ( _ i.e. _ setting @xmath81 in eq .  ( 5 ) ) .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "for @xmath12 we display data taken at @xmath82 for an @xmath41 sample , using both slow cooling and cold start initial conditions .",
    "this value of @xmath38 is slightly below what our extrapolation from small @xmath2 would lead us to expect @xmath37 would be .",
    "although there is a substantial peak in s(*k * ) , the value of @xmath57 ( measured in lattice units ) appears to be @xmath11 , and it does not increase as @xmath38 is lowered .",
    "data for two @xmath83 samples with @xmath50 at @xmath84 using slow cooling are shown in fig .",
    "6(b ) . here",
    "the value of @xmath57 is @xmath9 , in excellent agreement with earlier estimates for the @xmath50 model with @xmath23 isotropic random anisotropy.@xcite for @xmath50 , @xmath57 becomes essentially temperature - independent below about @xmath85 , but there is no evidence of singular behavior at any @xmath38 .",
    "given the recent results of migliorini and berker,@xcite the author does not believe that there is any phase transition at @xmath86 in this model when @xmath80 .",
    "although no attempt was made to find the exact ground states of these samples , the estimated ground state energy for the @xmath33 model at @xmath50 is @xmath87 , essentially equal to its value in the isotropic random anisotropy case .",
    "the integral of s(*k * ) over * k * is proportional to the total neutron - scattering cross - section , which is finite .",
    "because @xmath4 is not an integrable singularity in three dimensions , either @xmath57 must become finite , albeit extremely large , below @xmath37 where @xmath67 is nonzero , or else @xmath88 must be modified slightly to make the integral converge . in the presence of some crystalline or growth - induced nonrandom anisotropy , it is natural to expect that @xmath57 becomes finite , just as it does in a nonrandom ferromagnet below @xmath37.@xcite although it has become traditional to fit neutron - scattering data for s(*k * ) in random - field and random - anisotropy magnets to a lorentzian plus lorentzian@xmath89 form , this is based on a theoretical preconception .",
    "it has been known for a long time that eq .",
    "( 6 ) will serve to fit the data in some cases,@xcite while in others@xcite the 3 in the exponent should be replaced by 2.4 .",
    "a value of 2.4 in this exponent is precisely the value found for the @xmath16 random - anisotropy model,@xcite and thus should be expected in the presence of easy - plane anisotropy .",
    "the @xmath4 behavior of s(*k * ) for @xmath23 is the same exponent for both the random - anisotropy and random - field cases .",
    "therefore , we have no reason to believe that the presence of hedgehog singularities is essential for the qlro when @xmath23 .",
    "there seems to be no reason why qlro should not exist for larger finite values of @xmath17 , as originally predicted by aharony and pytte.@xcite    the magnetic susceptibility is @xmath90 -         [ \\langle s_{i}^\\alpha \\rangle \\langle s_{j}^\\beta \\rangle ] \\quad .\\ ] ] the aharony - pytte - goldschmidt@xcite analysis predicts that at small wavenumbers its fourier transform , @xmath91 will behave like @xmath7 .",
    "if time - reversal symmetry is unbroken , then the @xmath92 $ ] terms all vanish , and the trace of @xmath91 is proportional to s(*k * ) .",
    "thus aharony - pytte - goldschmidt implicitly predicts that s(*k * ) goes like @xmath7 in the qlro phase , which is not correct .",
    "its prediction for @xmath91 in the qlro phase is , however , probably correct in the absence of any crystalline anisotropy . to check this",
    "numerically would require very long runs , in order to compute the @xmath92 $ ] terms accurately .",
    "this has not been attempted here .",
    "it is likely that the reason why aharony - pytte - goldschmidt fails to predict the qlro for the random - field case is also its incorrect handling of the @xmath92 $ ] terms . for the random - field case",
    "these terms are nonzero even in the pm phase .",
    "the fm phases shown in fig .  1 exist because of the anisotropy induced by our discretization",
    ". it would be very helpful to repeat this calculation using an alternative discretization , such as rapaport s 30-state model,@xcite which has icosahedral symmetry .",
    "it would also be desirable to study a continuous - spin binary alloy model with a fully isotropic distribution of the random anisotropy .",
    "this would be very difficult to manage for large lattices , unless a way can be found to adapt the cluster monte carlo algorithm@xcite to include the random anisotropy .",
    "when @xmath3 the hamiltonian no longer has any planes of reflection symmetry , even though it is still inversion - symmetric .",
    "in this work we have used monte carlo simulations to study the @xmath33 version of the diluted random - anisotropy ferromagnet in three dimensions .",
    "we have found that there are two types of ordered phases , just as in the @xmath16 case .",
    "in addition to the anisotropy - stabilized ferromagnet , we find an intermediate qlro phase displaying a @xmath4 behavior of the magnetic structure factor .",
    "this is the same behavior which has been found for @xmath23 random - field model .",
    "the critical exponent @xmath59 , which characterizes the two - spin correlations on the qlro - to - pm critical line , has a value which is indistinguishable from zero .",
    "the results should be applicable to a variety of experimental systems , including amorphous re - tm alloys and cumn - type spin - glass alloys .",

    "<S> monte carlo simulations have been used to study a discretized heisenberg ferromagnet ( fm ) with random uniaxial single - site anisotropy on @xmath0 simple cubic lattices , for @xmath1 up to 64 . </S>",
    "<S> the spin variable on each site is chosen from the twelve [ 110 ] directions . </S>",
    "<S> the random anisotropy has infinite strength and a random direction on a fraction @xmath2 of the sites of the lattice , and is zero on the remaining sites . in many respects </S>",
    "<S> the behavior of this model is qualitatively similar to that of the corresponding random - field model . due to the discretization , for small @xmath2 at low temperature </S>",
    "<S> there is a [ 110 ] fm phase . </S>",
    "<S> for @xmath3 there is an intermediate quasi - long - range ordered ( qlro ) phase between the paramagnet and the ferromagnet , which is characterized by a @xmath4 divergence of the magnetic structure factor s@xmath5 for small @xmath6 , but no true fm order . at the transition between the paramagnetic and qlro phases </S>",
    "<S> s@xmath5 diverges like @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> the limit of stability of the qlro phase is somewhat greater than @xmath8 . for @xmath2 close to 1 the low temperature form of s@xmath5 </S>",
    "<S> can be fit by a lorentzian , with a correlation length estimated to be @xmath9 at @xmath10 and @xmath11 at @xmath12 .    </S>"
