    "cosmic strings are a special kind of topological defects @xcite , which could have been formed in a symmetry breaking phase transition in the early universe .",
    "often , the broken symmetry is assumed to be local , but the possibility of global strings has also been extensively discussed @xcite . the prototype is cohen and kaplan s solution @xcite of a complex scalar with a @xmath3 symmetry breaking potential .",
    "the string solution turns out to have a repulsive gravitational field with a curvature singularity at a finite distance from the axis .",
    "the singularity is unavoidable as was shown by gibbons et al .",
    "@xcite for the standard lagrangian of a complex field with a non - negative potential term , under the assumptions that the solutions are static and have symmetry under boosts along the string axis .",
    "this result may be regarded as the analog in the gravitational case of the @xmath7 dimensional version of derrick s theorem @xcite , excluding the existence of static global strings with finite energy per unit length in flat space .",
    "it was shown explicitly that the singularity of the cohen - kaplan solution can be avoided if time dependence is allowed , which results a string solution with de - sitter like expansion along the string axis @xcite . an attempt to get a static non - singular global string",
    "was tried @xcite by relaxing the symmetry under boosts parallel to the string axis ( @xmath2 ) , but without relaxing the corresponding condition @xmath8 in the string core , so the solution found there has lost its interpretation as a global string gravitational field .",
    "there are additional ways to overcome the `` no - go '' theorems and find string solutions .",
    "all of them involve modifications of the cohen - kaplan model .",
    "probably the most well - known is gauging the @xmath3 symmetry group to become local , thus obtaining the abelian higgs model .",
    "the main consequence of this modification is that the long range massless goldstone field transmutes into the longitudinal component of a short range massive vector field .",
    "this model admits string solutions ( flux tubes ) in flat space and in the self - gravitating case .",
    "however , we will not discuss this possibility here since almost all that can be said about it , has been already said @xcite .",
    "other ways are either restricted to the flat space case , or to the gravitating case or are valid in both .",
    "one is the q - ball solution @xcite , which overcomes derrick s theorem by allowing oscillatory time dependence of the complex scalar , so as to avoid the staticity assumption without introducing time dependence into the energy - momentum tensor and other observables .",
    "in addition , the potential term is modified in such a way that it has another symmetric local minimum . from a more physical point of view",
    ", these modifications result a non - vanishing value of the conserved global @xmath3 charge , which stabilizes the spherical solutions against collapse .",
    "the string - like analogue ( `` q - string '' ) is similarly stabilized by a finite global @xmath3 charge per unit length ( see however @xcite for a different situation ) .",
    "spinning versions have been also recently considered @xcite .",
    "adding gravity into the q - ball system does not change the overall picture of the solutions , but rather yields the so - called q - stars @xcite .    a second way which is also based on the existence of a global @xmath3 charge but in which gravity is indispensable , gives the boson stars @xcite .",
    "it is also possible to get similar `` non - topological solitons '' in systems with more than one complex scalar field @xcite , but since we want to stick to a minimal field content in our model , we will not discuss those as well .    the simplest way to add",
    "a topological charge is to assume for the scalar field a `` hedgehog configuration '' , where it tends asymptotically to symmetry breaking minima of the potential , mapping this way spatial infinity into the vacuum manifold . in the original @xmath3 system ,",
    "static string - like solutions fall indeed into homotopy classes characterized by an integer winding number , but such solutions are excluded by the `` no go theorems '' mentioned above .",
    "however , we may think of a second version of a `` hedgehog configuration '' , where we turn the target space from a trivial vector space into a compact manifold of a non - linear sigma model .",
    "since we are after string - like solutions , the scalar field defines a mapping to target space from the compactified @xmath9 , which is transverse with respect to the string axis .",
    "if we take the simplest target space @xmath10 , the kinetic part of the lagrangian will be the usual one of the @xmath11 non - linear sigma model .",
    "the potential term will necessarily break explicitly the @xmath11 symmetry , but we will assume it is still @xmath3-symmetric .",
    "it will be also taken until further notice to be non - negative with minima at @xmath12 . in this form of hedgehog configuration",
    ", the scalar field should tend asymptotically to a @xmath3-symmetric minimum in order to correspond to a linear defect , which will be both localized enough and have a topological charge .    to make the discussion more concrete ,",
    "we write down the action in the general form @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the @xmath15 dimensional gravitational constant ( we will discuss only @xmath16 ) and @xmath17 is a non - negative dimensionless function , which serves as a weyl factor of a conformally - flat target space metric of the non - linear sigma model . the @xmath10 target space is obtained by @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the diameter of the 2-sphere and sets the energy scale . in @xmath15 dimensions it has dimensions of energy to the power @xmath20 .",
    "more conventions : @xmath21 is a covariant derivative , signature @xmath22 and the riemann tensor is @xmath23 .",
    "note that the `` linear '' higgs ( or rather goldstone  but we will use the former term ) system is recovered either by taking @xmath24 , or using the sigma model lagrangian in the limit of small fields or formally for @xmath25 .",
    "in flat spacetime this model has well - known static string - like solutions , but only with a vanishing potential  again a simple consequence of derrick s theorem .",
    "this is the original @xmath11 sigma model @xcite .",
    "we will still use the term `` sigma model '' for the action ( [ action1 ] ) , but refrain from characterizing it by the symmetry group , since it is ( explicitly ) broken by the potential term to @xmath3 .",
    "the flat space string - like solutions were found to be unstable and may either shrink or spread out @xcite . they may be however stabilized by allowing ( as above ) an oscillatory time dependence and adding a potential term .",
    "this produces the so - called `` q - lumps '' , which are stable rotating topological string - like solutions @xcite .",
    "as described , these solutions have oscillatory time as well as angular dependence ( around the string axis ) : @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is an integer and @xmath28 real .",
    "the non - vanishing global @xmath3 charge results from the oscillatory time dependence , while it is the mixed angular and time dependence which produces the non - vanishing angular momentum density , @xmath29 .",
    "the topological winding number is @xmath27 .",
    "the @xmath11 sigma model may be also stabilized by a gravitational field in the form of a cosmological expansion @xcite .",
    "closer to our present purpose is the comtet - gibbons solution @xcite , which is a static cylindrically symmetric ( self - dual ) solution of a self - gravitating @xmath11 sigma model ( with a vanishing potential ) .    in this paper , we fill some of the gaps which are evident from the above discussion , and find new non - singular global string solutions , which are topologically non trivial : self - gravitating q - lumps and generalizations which introduce also a momentum current along the string axis - a possibility which has not been considered before .",
    "this is reflected by @xmath30 in case of rotation or @xmath31 in case of translational motion along the string axis .",
    "this will be done by taking the more general oscillatory behavior @xmath32 .",
    "some non - topological solutions like self - gravitating spinning q - strings will be discussed in a future publication .",
    "the expectation that one may get non - singular stationary gravitational fields in this way , is based on the observation that introducing an oscillatory @xmath2 and/or @xmath0-dependence is consistent with the existence of two commuting killing vectors , which generate translations in time and along the string axis , and has the effect of gauging the global symmetry and turning the global sigma model into a gauged one .",
    "this way , the original @xmath33 gravitating global sigma model is reduced in a kaluza - klein way into a @xmath4 gauged sigma model coupled with @xmath4 gravity and electromagnetism ( and a dilaton ) . since it is known that the gravitating nielsen - olesen flux tube produces a non - singular gravitational field , even when a dilaton coupling is allowed @xcite , there is a good chance it will share this characteristic with the type of solutions described above . as",
    "the dilaton introduced by the kaluza - klein reduction is also a long range field , the gravitational field of the global string solutions obtained in our model will be finite but not asymptotically flat . only the pure @xmath7 system discussed in sec .",
    "[ three - dimensional system ] will admit asymptotically flat global vortices .",
    "we proceed and end this section by writing the field equations of our model .",
    "they are the following generalization of klein - gordon equation @xmath34 together with the einstein equations ( in term of the einstein tensor @xmath35 ) @xmath36+u(|\\phi|)g_{\\mu\\nu } \\label{einstein}\\ ] ] which are equivalent to @xmath37 \\label{einsteinsigma}\\ ] ]",

    "this is just the kaluza - klein reduction from @xmath15 to @xmath42 dimensions .",
    "if we also take @xmath43 , the @xmath15-dimensional gravitating sigma model with a global u(1 ) symmetry turns into a gravitating gauged sigma - maxwell - dilaton system in @xmath42 dimensions , as it is evident from the lagrangian which becomes : @xmath44-e^{2\\sigma}u(|\\psi|)\\right)+\\nonumber\\\\ \\frac{\\sqrt{|h|}}{2\\kappa}\\left(r(h)+(d-2)(d-3)\\nabla_\\alpha\\sigma \\nabla^\\alpha\\sigma- \\frac{1}{4}e^{-2(d-2)\\sigma}f_{\\alpha\\beta}f^{\\alpha\\beta}+ 2(d-2)\\nabla_\\alpha\\nabla^\\alpha\\sigma\\right ) \\label{redlag}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] after we define a usual covariant derivative @xmath45 and field strength @xmath46 .",
    "the last term can obviously be omitted .",
    "all geometric quantities are related to the @xmath47 metric @xmath48 .    in the next step",
    "we assume stationarity , i.e. parametrize the scalar field and the @xmath42 metric as : @xmath49 ^ 2-\\gamma_{ij}(x^k)dx^idx^j \\label{lineeld-1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the indices @xmath50 go from 1 to @xmath40 .",
    "now we do not write the lagrangian or the action in the @xmath40 dimensional notation , but assume @xmath33 and write directly the field equations in terms of the following :    * @xmath51 the covariant derivative with respect to the 2-dimensional metric @xmath52 , * @xmath53 the corresponding ricci tensor , * @xmath54 .",

    "we will also use @xmath62 to denote @xmath63 .",
    "this way of dealing with the field equations is essentially an extension of the gravito - electromagnetism formalism beyond the weak field limit , where it is usually used @xcite .",
    "the components of @xmath64 will be referred to as gravito - electric and gravito - magnetic .",
    "einstein equations split therefore according to the components ( 00 ) , @xmath65 , @xmath66 , @xmath67 , @xmath68 and @xmath69 .",
    "the first 5 are : @xmath70 and the @xmath69 components are : @xmath71 the equation for the scalar field is @xmath72    another equation which is not independent , but will be useful is the @xmath69 component of ( [ einstein ] ) : @xmath73",
    "[ three - dimensional system ] in order to get a clearer picture of the system , it is useful to deal with a lower dimensional case if possible .",
    "although this set of field equations is genuinely four - dimensional , it contains also in a special limit the field equations for the @xmath4 system . these are equations ( [ eqn ] ) , ( [ eqell ] ) , ( [ eqredeinst ] ) , ( [ eqredkg ] ) with the substitutions : @xmath74 , @xmath75 and @xmath76 , which imply @xmath77 and @xmath78 .",
    "we get therefore : @xmath79 and for the scalar field : @xmath80    note that a solution of the @xmath4 system is not automatically a solution to the @xmath33 system with the above - mentioned substitutions .",
    "the main reason is eq ( [ eqsig ] ) which gives an additional condition , which is consistent with the @xmath4 theory only in the absence of self - interaction ( i.e. @xmath12 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the fact that there is an explicit dependence in the einstein equations upon the dimensionality @xmath15 , does not hinder the possibility to use them for the @xmath4 field equations .",
    "accordingly , the @xmath4 analogue of eq ( [ eqgij ] ) is : @xmath81",
    "[ self - dual solutions ]    it is known that the field equations simplify considerably if self - duality is possible ( see e.g. ref . @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "so we will start in the simplest case of self - dual solutions in the @xmath4 system .",
    "the self - dual solutions obey @xmath82 where @xmath83 corresponds to self - dual or anti self - dual solutions . in the following",

    "in the most familiar case of the @xmath88 sigma model defined by eq .",
    "( [ sphereconffactor ] ) , the integration is trivial and we find the following form of potential term , which will give rise to localized self - dual solutions : @xmath89 we chose the integration constant such that @xmath90 will vanish asymptotically , i.e. for fields that satisfy @xmath91 as @xmath92 .",
    "it is interesting to note that the linear sigma model ( @xmath93 ) needs for self - duality a potential which is unbounded from below , which is a property shared by other systems @xcite .",
    "since target space is a sphere , it is natural and useful to use an `` angular '' field defined by @xmath94 . in terms of this field , we get for example @xmath95 and see that @xmath91 is actually just the `` south pole '' of target space , @xmath96 . thus , the self - duality potential can be rewritten as : @xmath97    this generalizes the flat space self - dual q - lumps @xcite to be self - gravitating .",
    "the flat space limit is reproduced by taking @xmath98 . from a different direction , this can be regarded as a spinning generalization of the self - dual comtet - gibbons solutions @xcite . those are reproduced for @xmath99 .",

    "it may be thought that those dilaton - maxwell - einstein papers may be considered relevant to our model in the asymptotic regions , where the scalar field settles to its vacuum value , but even from this point of view there are significant differences .",
    "the dilaton in the present system is a metric component and not an additional field , so its coupling to other fields is not arbitrary .",
    "similarly , the `` electric '' or `` magnetic '' fields are also of gravitational origin , and since they have specific source , the field equations are inconsistent with the separate conditions @xmath125 or @xmath126 .",
    "consequently , the solutions presented here can not be classified as either electric or magnetic but always ( for non - vanishing self - interaction ) have both kinds of fields or none of them .",
    "a third difference is that most of the above - mentioned papers introduce a non - vanishing cosmological constant , which we avoid here .",
    "we solve the equations numerically taking the `` kasner gauge '' @xmath127 so that @xmath128 . in order to get localized solutions , we solve the equations with the boundary conditions which ensure regularity at the origin and will be as close as possible to asymptotically vacuum .",
    "that is , we impose on the 3-metric @xmath129 as for the gravito - electromagnetic components , @xmath130 can be any finite constant while @xmath131 ( for @xmath132 see below ) and for the `` dilaton '' and the scalar field @xmath133 where @xmath134 is the location of the minimum of the potential .",
    "the value of @xmath134 distinguishes between two types of hedgehog configurations : a `` sigma model hedgehog '' and a `` higgs hedgehog '' .",

    "@xmath132 can be any finite constant and the gravito - magnetic flux is not quantized .",
    "the second corresponds to any other value @xmath136 which is associated with a quantized flux : @xmath137 . in order to discuss both kinds of solutions",
    ", we may use the following simple potential function : @xmath138 where @xmath134 is , as mentioned above , the location of the potential minimum .",
    "it is actually the standard higgs potential multiplied by the conformal factor @xmath17 and written in terms of the angular field .",
    "the case @xmath139 corresponds to a `` single well potential '' .",
    "we will also use the `` double well potential '' , which is a special case of ( [ sdpottheta ] ) with two minima at the two poles @xmath140 : @xmath141 these minima do not break the symmetry so they allow topological solutions of the `` sigma model hedgehog '' type .",

    "it is very similar to the cohen - kaplan solution . for small",
    "@xmath150 the singularity appears for very large @xmath108 ( or @xmath151 - for @xmath152 and @xmath99 the singularity is already at @xmath153 ) , so for demonstrative reasons we took quite a large @xmath150 .",
    "there are two kinds of singularities .",
    "the first is the one appearing in figure [ figssbom0kasg ] , where @xmath154 , @xmath155 and @xmath156 vanish while @xmath157 diverges for some finite @xmath108 . for @xmath99 @xmath158",
    "so @xmath154 and @xmath155 vanish at the same point .",
    "if @xmath159 but smaller than a certain bound ( which depends on @xmath150 ) , @xmath160 decreases faster than @xmath155 , so it is the zero of @xmath160 or rather @xmath154 which determines the singularity .",
    "if however @xmath161 is large enough , @xmath157 changes its trend and vanishes while @xmath154 and @xmath160 diverge .",
    "this last behavior is seen in figure [ figssbom3kasg ] .",
    "a similar behavior is found for @xmath162 as well .    this behavior is a direct result from the existence of the long range goldstone fields that exist in this model .",
    "this is the origin for the singularity of the static metric of the global string , and the other long range effects in other global defects .    as in the cohen - kaplan solution , it is the contribution to the energy density from the angular dependence which does not vanish fast enough to produce a localized source .",
    "in addition to the angular dependence , we allow here also time dependence and @xmath2-dependence which yield similar contributions all present in the right - hand - side of ( [ einstn])-([einsteinrotphiphi ] ) .",
    "since all these terms are proportional to @xmath163 , it is quite easy to identify the way to improve the asymptotic behavior namely , taking @xmath164 or @xmath91 as @xmath92 .",
    "note that the opposite direction , @xmath165 gives the higgs limit , as already mentioned .      in order to have solutions with @xmath164 ( or @xmath91 ) , we take the following simple monotonically decreasing potential @xmath166 , which is one of the `` vacuumless '' potentials of cho and vilenkin @xcite , who also found only singular string - like solutions . however , since we use it within the sigma model framework , this potential , unlike those of cho and vilenkin , is not vacuumless but a single - well potential with a single minimum at the south pole ( @xmath96 ) as is evident from its behavior in terms of the angular field : @xmath167 thus , we may get non - singular global strings and indeed we find non - singular stationary solutions , though not static ones .",
    "there are two kinds of string - like solutions : purely rotating ( pr in what follows ) where no gravito - electromagnetic fields exist , and rotating solutions with additional gravito - electromagnetic fields ( rgem ) . on a first sight",
    ", one may think that the fields of the latter may be either gravito - magnetic or gravito - electric , according to the field components produced by the momentum along the string axis .",
    "however , this is not the case ( if self - interaction exists ) since the field equations are inconsistent with either @xmath125 or @xmath168 .",
    "therefore , only solutions with gravito - electromagnetic fields exist .",
    "both kinds of solutions ( pr and rgem ) have @xmath169 and the pr solutions have @xmath74 . on the other hand ,",
    "rgem solutions exist for either vanishing or non - vanishing values of @xmath170 .",
    "the fact that @xmath74 allows non - vanishing gravito - electromagnetic fields is a direct result of the `` maxwell '' equation for the `` displacement '' field @xmath171 eq ( [ eqd ] ) , which shows that it is @xmath171 ( rather than @xmath172 ) that vanishes if @xmath74 .",
    "since there is no proportionality between these two gravito - electric fields , @xmath173 does not imply @xmath174 nor @xmath175 ( or @xmath126 ) but only a specific relation between them , somewhat similarly to a medium with electric and magnetic permeabilities .",
    "therefore , these fields can be non - zero even when @xmath74 . another way to see that there should exist rgem solutions",
    "when @xmath74 is from the fact that it is possible to `` gauge away '' @xmath170 by a coordinate transformation which however will not transform to zero the gravito - electromagnetic fields .",
    "the case @xmath74 splits therefore into two branches : a pr branch and a rgem branch .",
    "the fields of a purely rotating solution are depicted in figure [ fig1minrot ] .",
    "there is only a narrow range of @xmath28 values , outside of which only singular solutions exist .",
    "those of a rotating gravito - electromagnetic solution are presented in the two parts of figure [ fig1minrotem2parts ] .",
    "rgem solutions with @xmath74 are similar and are not shown .",
    "the fact that rgem non - singular solutions exist with smaller @xmath28 is a general one , and may be understood by the fact that less angular momentum is required to balance the scalar and gravitational self - attraction , in the presence of gravito - electromagnetic fields .",
    "another significant difference between the two kinds of solutions , is the asymptotic behavior of @xmath155 .",
    "while it is monotonically decreasing function in the pr case , it is monotonically increasing for rgem solutions .",
    "this difference is a direct consequence from the field equations : it is obvious from equation ( [ einstsigm ] ) that for vanishing gravito - electromagnetic fields , the function @xmath176 is monotonically increasing so @xmath177 is decreasing . on the other hand , for rgem solutions ,",
    "the magnetic contribution is the dominant term for large distances and it comes with an opposite sign , so @xmath177 has the opposite large distance behavior - although it may start decreasing near the axis .",
    "another kind of potential which we can consider is @xmath178 which is just the special case @xmath135 of ( [ symmbrkpot ] ) .",
    "we find non - singular pr solutions , which are quite similar to those of the previous single well potential , thus we do not present them",
    ". however , we were able to obtain only singular rgem solutions for this potential .",
    "we take the double well potential ( [ doublewellpot ] ) .",
    "the two minima do not break the symmetry , so they allow topological solutions of the `` sigma model hedgehog '' type .",
    "the fields of a purely rotating solution appear in figure [ fig2minj ] . as for the previous potential ,",
    "there is a range of @xmath28 values outside of which only singular solutions exist , while @xmath150 can be quite large .",
    "the fields of a rotating gravito - electromagnetic global string are presented in figure [ fig2minem2parts ] .",
    "as before , the @xmath74 rgem solutions are similar as they are related to the @xmath179 ones by a coordinate transformation .",
    "the gravito - electromagnetic solutions become closed above a certain critical value of @xmath150 .",
    "the behavior of @xmath155 is also analogous to that of the single well potential : decreasing for the pr case and increasing for the rgem case .",
    "now we take the potential ( [ sdpottheta ] ) which , as we saw already , allows @xmath4 self - dual rotating strings or rather vortices . we write it as in all other cases in terms of the dimensionless potential function @xmath180 , but with the @xmath4 coefficient",
    "is still dimensionless as in @xmath33 ( or higher ) .",
    "] as @xmath181 .",
    "the necessary condition for self - duality is therefore @xmath182 . in order to obtain vortex solutions",
    ", we may directly solve the second order system of equations ( [ einstn ] ) , ( [ einstl ] ) , ( [ einsteinrotr ] ) and ( [ kgspec ] ) with the substitutions @xmath74 , @xmath183 , @xmath75 , @xmath184 and @xmath185 which imply @xmath186 and @xmath126 .",
    "alternatively , we may solve a first order system which include ( among other equations which we do not present ) , the equations ( [ sd3d ] ) and ( [ sdell3d ] ) used for rotational symmetry .",
    "a typical solution is shown in figure [ figsd3dsol ] .",
    "now we can proceed and search for solutions with the same potential ( up to powers of @xmath19 ) in @xmath33 .",
    "it is not surprising that we do nt find self - dual solutions .",
    "yet there exist non - singular solutions , which we do not show since they are quite similar to those of the double well potential .",
    "for @xmath12 we reproduce the well - known comtet - gibbons string - like solutions @xcite , which have asymptotically a conical geometry .",
    "figure [ fignopotomega0 ] shows the fields of a solution with a very large value of @xmath150 that was taken in order to stress the angular deficit , which is directly seen from the asymptotic slope of @xmath187 .",
    "a new type of ( purely ) rotating solutions is obtained for non - vanishing @xmath28 .",
    "the fields of one of these solutions are depicted in figure [ fignopotomeganon0 ] .",
    "all these solutions have asymptotic cylindrical two - geometry , while the metric component @xmath188 increases linearly as @xmath92 .",
    "solutions exist for any @xmath189 .",
    "the limit @xmath190 is singular , and does not reproduce the conical @xmath99 solutions .",
    "the fields of a rotating gravito - electromagnetic global string are presented in the two parts of figure [ fignopot2parts ] . a non - rotating solution with gravito - magnetic field",
    "is also found and presented in figure [ fignopotem ] . because @xmath99 we have here , as in the comtet - gibbons solution , @xmath191 but now different from 1 .",
    "this kind of purely gravito - magnetic solution is special to the case of vanishing potential and can not exist otherwise .",
    "we have shown that non - singular global cosmic string solutions exist in a simple sigma model , if we also allow for rotation or momentum current .",
    "another result is the self - gravitating generalization of the @xmath4 self - dual q - lumps .",
    "further investigation is required in order to fully understand these solutions and their consequences .",
    "the geometry of the solutions should be clarified by geodesic analysis , and their possible role in a cosmological context also deserves further study .",
    "another direction is a higher dimensional generalization of these solutions to be codimension 2 branes .",
    "these may be relevant to the extra dimensional resolution of the hierarchy problem , which was advanced recently by several authors @xcite using similar kind of solutions .",
