    "dating from the dawn of modern quantum mechanics , the kramers - kronig ( kk ) relations,@xcite which connect the frequency - dependent real and imaginary parts of a linear response function , have wide application .",
    "part of their popularity resides in the generality of the kk relations : they derive essentially from",
    "_ causality_the response must follow the excitation and not precede it  and _ linearity _ , the superposition of responses to different causes.@xcite    historically , the generality of the kk relations has made them a valuable tool , especially when measurements are limited or theory unclear .",
    "for example , in _ particle physics _ during the 1950s , the kk relations and associated _ sum rules _ were helpful for making sense of scattering data and were an ingredient in the s - matrix theory used to analyze such experiments.@xcite in _ optics _ , bode s gain - phase version of the kk relations has been widely used to analyze measurements of optical properties of materials , especially in reflection .",
    "if the light source is incoherent , only the magnitude of the reflection coefficient ( the optics version of the _ gain _ ) can be measured .",
    "the bode gain - phase relation then determines the phase .",
    "given the magnitude and phase , one can infer the index of refraction and absorption.@xcite    although the kk relations are part of the  standard lore \" taught to physics students , the corresponding relation between the magnitude and phase of a complex response function is less well - known outside its specific applications to optics , even though it was derived by bode in 1937@xcite and then popularized by him in an influential 1945 text.@xcite even less appreciated is that while the kk relations are an _ equality _ , the bode gain - phase relation is , in effect , an _ inequality _ : systems can have an  extra \" phase shift in their response that is greater than that given by the bode relations .",
    "this extra phase shift has been repeatedly rediscovered in various physics contexts@xcite and is often remarked upon with surprise and explained in ways that are more complicated than they need to be .    for reasons to be made clear , the bode relation has been more appreciated by engineers than by physicists .",
    "drawing on the engineering literature , i derive and explain the bode relation and give several simple examples where it is satisfied as an inequality rather than an equality . out of this exercise",
    "will come two insights : first , a better understanding of the gain - phase relation itself and of its implications ; second , a better appreciation that an experimental measurement reflects not only the dynamics of a physical system but also how excitations are made and how signals are received .",
    "choosing carefully the inputs and outputs to a physical system can help eliminate  surprises . \"",
    "the kramers - kronig relations connect the real and imaginary parts of a causal linear response function , @xmath0 .",

    "linearity implies that the measurement @xmath4 in response to an excitation @xmath5 is given by @xmath6 in the language of engineers , @xmath4 is the system _ output _ , and @xmath5 the system _ input_. the expression for @xmath7 follows from fourier transforming and applying the convolution theorem and uses an  overloading \" notation where the same letter denotes a function in both its time- and frequency - domain representations .",
    "we are particularly interested in the frequency - domain response function , @xmath8 where @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the real and imaginary parts of the response function , respectively .",
    "note that the lower limit in the integral in eq .   is 0 , not @xmath11 , since @xmath0 vanishes for @xmath3 .",

    "[ fig : kernel ] resembles a broadened delta function , with most of its weight near @xmath47 ( @xmath48 ) .",

    "in the introduction , we noted that one of the main applications of the bode gain - phase relation is in the determination of optical properties of materials .",
    "the method is especially useful in the far infrared ( ir ) , where there is a lack of bright , tunable , coherent sources .",
    "instead , one typically measures the _ reflectance _ @xmath61 as a function of frequency @xmath12 , where the _ reflection coefficient _",
    "@xmath62 is the complex linear response function @xmath63 , the ratio of reflected to incident electric fields . because the source is incoherent",
    ", we can not use the interference techniques that would normally help determine the phase .",
    "hence , only @xmath64 is typically available and one must numerically integrate bode s gain - phase relation , eq .   with @xmath65 , to determine the phase @xmath66 . for a thick sample",
    "whose reflectance is measured at normal incidence , we then use the fresnel formula to write@xcite @xmath67 where @xmath57 is the index of refraction and @xmath68 the absorption coefficient . knowing the complex @xmath69",
    ", we solve for @xmath70 and @xmath71 numerically .",
    "in practice , there are a number of issues , the most important of which is that the reflectance @xmath64 can be measured only over a limited frequency range , and it is necessary to make some plausible guesses in order to extrapolate @xmath72 to all frequencies in the numerical integration of the bode relation.@xcite as long as one works with normal incidence and thick samples , the method makes possible highly accurate inferences of the phase and hence of the material properties @xmath70 and @xmath71 . indeed , as we have mentioned , the technique is the standard one for such measurements in the far - ir frequency range .    for oblique incidence or thin films ,",
    "there are many cases where the phase that is deduced from the bode relation underestimates the actual phase shift and hence leads to incorrect inferences for the material parameters.@xcite the failure of a naive application of the bode relation in this and other cases thus motivates a closer look at the underlying physics .",
    "bode s relation , eq .",
    ", is an _ equality _ for the set of response functions that are analytic in the upper - half plane ( and thus obey the kk relations ) and , in addition , have no zeros in the upper - half plane . yet",
    "many physical response functions that are causal and obey the kk relations do have zeros in the upper - half plane .",
    "such response functions have extra phase delays : the phase lag at a given frequency is greater than that predicted by the bode relation . because these response functions are physical  indeed , we will give several examples  it makes sense to view the bode relation as an _ inequality _ over the set of physical response functions .",
    "as an example , consider the response function for a _ delay _ @xmath73 , with output @xmath74 .",
    "fourier transforming , we have @xmath75 and we can identify the response function of the delay as @xmath76 . since @xmath77 has an essential singularity at @xmath78 ,",
    "the logarithm is not analytic at infinity , and the bode relation does not apply . on the other hand , a delay is a physically possible , causal response function , and its real and imaginary components , @xmath79 and @xmath80 satisfy the kk relations , as may be verified by substitution into eq .  .",
    "we can calculate directly the magnitude and phase : @xmath81 and @xmath82 .",
    "by contrast , if there is no delay , then @xmath83 , which has @xmath84 but @xmath85 .",
    "thus , we have two response functions , with equal magnitude response , but differing in the phase lag . applying bode s relation to _ both _ response functions predicts zero phase lag for both .",
    "( the exponent @xmath86 . )    we have seen that if a response function contains a delay , the phase lag will exceed that predicted by the bode relation . since causality precludes a phase _ advance _ , we conclude that the bode relation gives a minimum phase lag : such _ minimum - phase _ ( mp ) response functions have the smallest phase lag that is compatible with a given magnitude response . _",
    "non - minimum - phase _ ( nmp ) response functions have a larger phase lag .",
    "in addition to an exact delay , there are other nmp response functions that act as approximate delays .",

    "starting from the kramers - kronig relation between the real and imaginary parts of a linear response function , we derived the analogous bode relation between the magnitude and phase . but",
    "unlike the kk relations , the bode relation is most usefully viewed as an inequality : if there are zeros in the upper part of the @xmath12 plane , there will be an extra phase lag ( non - minimum - phase system ) .",
    "in addition to producing the occasional  surprise \" in an experiment , we saw that non - minimum - phase systems are difficult to control .",
    "physically , these non - minimum - phase systems often correspond to situations where the input and output are separated in some way , so that there is a delay for the signal to get from the input to the output .    in the examples discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : examples - applications ] , a consistent theme was that the particular choice of measured variable could determine whether the response function is or is not minimum phase .",

    "by contrast , the resonance frequencies of a system are independent of the measurement details . in our toy example of the two - mode system ,",
    "the zeros were functions of the amplitudes @xmath120 and @xmath118 , but the poles that give the resonance frequencies were not .",
    "that is , the zeros of linear response functions depend on the details of the excitation and the sensor , but the poles depend on the intrinsic dynamics .",
    "the poles thus seem  more fundamental \" than the zeros .",
    "still , real experiments have sensors to make observations and , usually , actuators to create some kind of controlled excitation . experiments always mix intrinsic dynamics with experimental details of input and output connections , and the two aspects always need to be separated .",
    "one practical lesson from the engineers is to be proactive and eliminate an upper - plane zero by rearranging sensors  choosing a different position to measure the block displacement , rotating a polarization analyzer angle , or by doing more radical changes such as adding more sensors . because the root of the problem lies in the connections of signals between the outside world and the system under study ,",
    "redesigning those connections can help .",
    "although you might think that zeros and their related issues are special features of linear response , they are more general .",
    "it is true that notions of phase shifts are linked to linear systems , as they reflect a response to a sinusoidal inputs . in a nonlinear system ,",
    "a sine - wave input generates an infinite set of harmonic sine - wave outputs , each with its own phase shift that depends on the amplitude of the input .",
    "although there have been attempts to generalize the kramers - kronig ( and bode ) relations to a nonlinear case , their usefulness is not clear.@xcite    on the other hand , the concept of a zero is not special to linear systems .",
    "all that is required is that the output be zero for a class of input signals , so that when you measure an output , you do not know which of the input signals was responsible .",
    "for example , consider the time - domain version of an all - pass filter , @xmath168 fourier transforming eq .",
    "gives the response function @xmath169 , which has a nmp zero at @xmath111 .",
    "the zero here means that an input of the form @xmath170 does not affect the output , no matter what the value of @xmath171 ( and even though the input is diverging with time ) .",
    "this _ signal - blocking _ property is another important feature of zeros .",
    "clearly , though , we would arrive at the same conclusion for the _ nonlinear _",
    "equation @xmath172 , with @xmath173 a nonlinear function .",
    "thus , there are nonlinear equations with the same  pathology \" as linear equations .",
    "a natural formulation of the nonlinear generalization of zeros is based on geometrical tools.@xcite    from eq .  , we see that the output tells nothing about the amplitude , or even presence , of the input , @xmath171 .",
    "such loss of information is a familiar idea from communication theory , where the equivalent statement is that the _ mutual information _ between input and output is zero : the output gives no information about a set of inputs .",
    "the information - theory analysis of dynamical response is particularly attractive in that both nonlinear and stochastic effects can be accommodated in a natural way.@xcite",
    "we give here a brief derivation of the kramers - kronig relations.@xcite if @xmath0 is a causal response function and if the response to an impulse dies away quickly enough , then we can assume that @xmath174 as @xmath175 fast enough that the integral @xmath176 converges .",
    "if so , then the integral converges even faster for complex @xmath12 with i m @xmath54 . as a result , @xmath14 is _ analytic _ in the complex @xmath12-plane for all i m @xmath54 . for simplicity",
    ", we will also assume that @xmath14 has no poles on the real axis .",
    "since @xmath14 is analytic for i m @xmath177 , we can use _",
    "cauchy s integral theorem _ to write @xmath178 where the closed contour @xmath179 is depicted in figure  [ fig : freq - kkcontour ] .",
    "the semicircular indentation around the point @xmath12 is necessary since there is a pole in the integrand in eq .  .",
    "the integral in eq .",
    "is divided into three parts , as labeled in figure  [ fig : freq - kkcontour ] .",
    "@xmath180 where @xmath16 denotes the _ principal value _ , which simply is a notation to remind us that we have excluded an infinitesimal , symmetric region from the domain of integration .",
    "finally , we assume that @xmath185 fast enough for @xmath186 that part iii @xmath187 as the contour radius @xmath188 .",
    "then , from the cauchy theorem , parts i + ii + iii = 0 , implying @xmath189 writing @xmath190 and isolating real and imaginary parts gives eq .  .",
