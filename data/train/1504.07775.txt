    "the realm of liquid state theory  @xcite , initially developed to study the so called simple fluids like those whose constituents are noble gases or small molecules , has been enormously extended when it was realized that such methods could be imported to treat many phenomena in a significant fraction of complex liquids , like polymers in solution or colloidal suspensions .",
    "the strategy is first to identify , among the plethora of the microscopic degrees of freedom , a few effective ones and then to construct an effective interaction among these .",
    "models like the hard sphere system or the yukawa fluid found accurate experimental implementations  @xcite in such context and the analog of the standard liquid - vapor and solidification phase transitions are quite common in such complex fluids .",
    "however , it should be kept in mind that the effective interaction can be very different from those typical of a simple fluid and the phase diagram can display more complex topologies compared to the textbook paradigm of three phases , vapor , liquid and solid , the last one occupying the high - density side . the liquid phase can disappear altogether or be present only as a metastable state  @xcite ; re - entrant solidification  @xcite may appear when a fluid region is present at higher density , and density modulated phases can also be found  @xcite in place of a liquid or of a solid .    in the field of simple fluids when one moves from a one component system to a binary mixture a very rich phase diagram",

    "one find that the two critical points of the pure systems are connected by a line of critical points , well separated in density from the solidification transition : in this case , the two components are fully miscible in all the fluid phase .",
    "this kind of transition will be referred to as  liquid - vapour \" . in many , less simple , molecular fluids , like water / phenol mixtures  @xcite , a new phase transition may well arise in the high density region , leading to the  demixing \" between two liquid phases that differs in concentration .",
    "this transition ends in a new line of critical points and the phase diagram displays two lines of critical points , one in the small density region and one at large density .",
    "when the two components are more strongly dissimilar , like with ne - kr or he - xe mixtures  @xcite , again one finds two lines of critical points but the topology of the phase diagram is different from the previous one because the two critical points of the pure components are no longer connected and two disjoint lines depart from them .",
    "one line moves toward large density transforming a liquid - vapor transition into a kind of demixing one while the other line terminates in an end point .",
    "the different character of the order parameter at any point along a critical line can be fruitfully identified by an arrow in the density / concentration plane , whose direction provides the exact blending of density and concentration fluctuations in the order parameter of the transition .",
    "even more complex phase diagrams can be found , and up to six principal types of phase diagrams  @xcite have been classified for binary mixtures of small molecules .",
    "not much attention has been given to which extent such richness of phase diagrams can be found in the area of colloidal suspensions or of other soft matter systems .",
    "this is the topic we address in the present paper .",
    "we consider a mixture of small non - adsorbing polymers and of spherical colloids in a solvent such that the colloids can be assimilated to hard spheres .",
    "such polymers give rise to a short - range attraction between the colloids via the so - called depletion interaction  @xcite .",
    "when colloids are monodisperse such an attraction gives rise to a phase transition between two phases , one rich and one poor in colloids and this transition mimics the liquid - vapor transition of a simple fluid , with the concentration of polymers playing the role of inverse temperature . when the range of the effective attraction is small enough compared to the colloid diameter , this transition can be metastable with respect to a direct transition between a low - density phase and a solid phase at high density of colloids  @xcite .",
    "we consider now a similar system when colloids are not monodisperse but are a mixture of spheres of two diameters , @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "since colloids are never monodisperse , our model is appropriate when the size distribution of colloids is bimodal with maxima around two sizes with a dispersion that is small compared to the difference @xmath12 .",
    "in essence we have a three component system , colloids of two comparable sizes and small polymers in a background good solvent . when the polymer degrees of freedom are averaged out three depletion interactions arises , the two between colloids of the same size and that between colloids of different size .",
    "the depletion interaction between two colloids of different diameter is known  @xcite in the framework of the asakura - oosawa ( ao ) model in which the inter - polymer interaction is neglected and the polymer - colloid interaction is assumed to be hard sphere .",
    "however , how such binary ao model affects the phase diagram of the system has not been studied and this is our main scope in this paper . in addition , recently , it has been pointed out that , by relaxing the hard core hypothesis , a strong enhancement in the strength of the depletion interactions can be achieved  @xcite .",
    "we have then extended the colloidal mixture / polymer model when polymer - colloid interaction is represented by a repulsion over a finite range and it is not infinitely sharp as in the ao model .",
    "based on such interaction models we ask if the mixture of two colloids of comparable size has only a liquid - vapor transition like in the monodisperse system or if also a demixing transition is present and which is the topology of the phase diagram . to this end",
    "we have studied the model on the basis of a suitable mean - field approximation and of the mapping onto the adhesive hard sphere mixture model  @xcite determining the phase diagram as function of the size ratio @xmath1 , of the size of the polymers @xmath13 and of the softness of the polymer - colloid interaction .",

    "iii we motivate the use of a modified mean field free energy to investigate the phase diagram of the colloidal suspension . in section iv the results are shown examining the extension to binary fluids of the asakura - oosawa model first , and then studying the effects of softer colloid - polymer interactions .",
    "some conclusion and perspective is offered in section v.",
    "we provide a short derivation of the effective interaction between two colloidal particles , represented by hard - spheres of unequal diameters @xmath10 and @xmath11 respectively , immersed into a non - adsorbing polymer fluid . following a well established procedure  @xcite , polymers are regarded as non interacting point particles , which however feel a repulsive force due to the presence of the colloidal particles . usually such an interaction is represented by the hard core constraint but , in view of future generalizations , here we allow for an arbitrary pair potential @xmath14 between a colloid of type @xmath15 and the depletant particles ( polymers ) .",
    "the effective colloid - colloid interaction @xmath16 induced by the presence of the depletant can be evaluated exactly in this model .",

    "the situation is considerably worse when the standard mean field theory is extended to binary fluids , because the different topologies of the phase diagram which a mixture may display depend on a delicate balance between entropic and energetic contributions to the free energy .",
    "unfortunately , such a balance is not captured by any free energy linear in the interactions . in order to circumvent this problem ,",
    "a simple generalization of the standard mean field approach has been rediscovered several times in liquid state theory  @xcite : it simply amounts to assume that , outside the core , the direct correlation function coincides with the mayer function , rather than with the potential divided by @xmath61 .",
    "this simple way to modify the usual random phase approximation  @xcite ( rpa ) at least displays the correct low density limit and satisfies the noro - frenkel criterion  @xcite providing a clear improvement on standard rpa with a modest computational effort . by comparing the structure factor predicted by this modified rpa with computer simulations or with the results of integral equations ,",

    "unfortunately , the analytic solution shows that py does not lead to a full spinodal curve : this integral equation has no solution on one side of the critical point , leading to difficulties in extracting the thermodynamics from the knowledge of the correlation function . on the other hand , when applied to mixtures , msa for sticky potentials is known to be affected by a serious inconsistency which does not allow to obtain a free energy function via the compressibility route  @xcite .",
    "finally , a differential approach to the phase equilibria in mixtures ( hrt ) , which proved successful for molecular fluids , has not yet been implemented for short range potentials  @xcite .",
    "the phase diagram of our colloidal mixture , interacting via the effective pairwise potential @xmath63 , has been investigated starting from a mean - field like free energy density of the form : @xmath64   \\label{gmf}\\ ] ] where @xmath65 and @xmath66 are the number densities of the two species and @xmath67 is the free energy density of a hard sphere mixture , well represented by the mansoori - carnahan - starling expression  @xcite .",

    "[ fig11 ] , referring to a state point at higher density ( @xmath117,@xmath118 ) , also marked by a square in figs .",
    "[ fig9 ] .     ,",
    "title=\"fig:\",width=226,height=226 ]   , title=\"fig:\",width=226,height=226 ]    in both cases density correlations acquire a significant structure , showing strong short range correlations induced by depletion , particularly at size ratio @xmath2 where a very high peak , probably overemphasized by our modified rpa approximation , develops . for @xmath103 ,",
    "the closeness to the demixing critical point enhances both density and concentration fluctuations at long wavelengths .",
    "this finding agrees with previous remarks about the character of the demixing transition in these systems : the coexisting phases in fact differ both in density and in concentration , implying a composite order parameter involving both kinds of fluctuations . in contrast , in a pure hard sphere mixture both density and concentration fluctuations are small .",
    "the attractive nature of the so - called depletion interaction is well known as well as its effect in the densification of colloidal particles .",
    "less well known is that depletion interaction has a demixing effect when colloids of unequal size are present .",
    "we have shown how rich is the phase diagram of a mixture of colloids of different but comparable size in presence of a depleting agent like small non - adsorbing polymers .",
    "in fact the depletion interaction between two spheres of different size is sub - additive ( see eq .",
    "( [ chi ] ) ) compared to the two interactions between pair of spheres of the same diameter .",
    "therefore in a binary mixture of colloids two competing effects are present . on one hand",
    "the attractive nature of the depletion interaction brings in the tendency to phase separation of the colloids in two phases , one rich of colloids and one poor of colloids . on the other hand",
    "the sub - additivity of the depletion interaction between spheres of different diameter promotes phase separation of spheres of different diameter .",
    "all three main topologies of the phase diagram of a binary mixture described in the introduction are found , depending on the values of the interaction parameters .",
    "the tendency to demixing is enhanced by an increasing asymmetry of the colloids and by a decreasing size of the polymers .",
    "in addition , a strong enhancement of demixing is found if the polymer - colloid interaction has some degree of softness and it is not the hard core one assumed in the ao model .",
    "in fact , we find that under suitable conditions even a concentration of polymers as low as few percent in volume fraction can be enough to cause demixing of the colloids .",
    "we have considered mixtures of colloids of two different sizes .",
    "it is clear that our study is relevant also for real colloids when the size distribution @xmath119 is strongly bimodal , i.e. @xmath119 as function of the diameter @xmath42 has two sharp maxima .",
    "we are not aware of experimental studies of similar colloidal mixtures in the fluid phase in presence of small polymers but only at very large volume fraction such colloids has been investigated @xcite with the purpose of studying the crystalline phases . in this work a remarkable effect of the polymers on the kinetic of the crystallization was found .",
    "a binary mixture of hard spheres of similar diameters @xmath10 and @xmath11 is fully miscible in the fluid phase but upon solidification phase separation between different crystalline phases can be present @xcite .",
    "experiments @xcite with mixtures of colloids of two sizes at high packing fraction indeed show solidification but usually a glass state is formed and the kinetic of crystallization is very slow . by adding small polymers in the system one finds @xcite a dramatic acceleration of the crystallization process and it has been conjectured that this is due to enhanced concentration fluctuations induced by the polymer . in that work",
    "the size ratio @xmath1 is @xmath120 and the polymer diameter ratio @xmath121 , values similar to those of our study",
    ". we can give now a rational basis to the finding of this experiment .",
    "due to the sub - additivity of the depletion interaction between spheres of different diameter already in the fluid phase there is a tendency to demixing with enhanced concentration fluctuations so that the crystallization in solids with different composition should be facilitated .",
    "actually a demixing transition might already be present in the fluid phase .",
    "an experimental verification of our prediction of demixing in the fluid phase and on the different topology of the phase diagram , depending on the interaction parameters , should be very interesting .",
    "our study is based on a rather simple free energy functional of the mixture , it is of a mean field form suitably generalized to treat strong and short range attractive forces that are typical of depletion by small particles .",
    "our free energy is such that the noro - frenkel law of corresponding states is extended to binary mixtures , i.e. thermodynamic properties do not depend on the details of the three interaction potentials but only on the three stickiness parameters  @xmath43 ( @xmath122 ) as given by eq .",
    "( [ tau ] ) . the theory could be improved but we believe that our basic findings are at least qualitatively correct",
    ". it should be interesting to check by simulation their accuracy on a quantitative footing .    often in the paper",
    "we have mentioned non - adsorbing polymers as depleting agent .",
    "it is clear that the same effects are expected when depletion is induced by other kind of small particles like small micelles .",
    "it remains to be studied how the sub - additivity of the depletion interaction is modified when the interaction between the depleting particles can not be neglected as it is done in the ao model .",
    "an interesting result of our study is the prediction that the demixing effect of the depletion interaction is strongly enhanced when some softness is present in the polymer - colloid interaction .",
    "an experimental study of this aspect should be possible , for instance by coating the colloids by adsorbing polymers of different length or by temperature sensitive polymers so that the softness could be controlled by temperature .",
    "softening the direct colloid - colloid repulsive interaction may result either in favoring or in hampering particle demixing , depending whether the repulsive tail in @xmath123 prevails over the attraction induced by depletion .",
    "a realistic representation of the pair potential is therefore required to investigate the competition between these effects .",
    "it is a pleasure to dedicate this work to jean - pierre , whose deep insight and outstanding achievements permeate modern liquid state theory .",
    "we acknowledge fruitful discussions with p. tartaglia , e. zaccarelli , d. ashton , n. wilding and a. giacometti .",
