    "from the beginnings of 1970s researchers were studying the concept of magnetic guided drug delivery method  @xcite .",
    "the concept of this method is to attach the drug to the micro- or nanoparticles and then to inject them to the bloodstream . for the guidance to the targeted area",
    ", a magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) device is needed . by making use of the magnetic guided drug delivery method ,",
    "the quantity of the drug required to reach therapeutic levels is being reduced .",
    "also , the drug concentration at targeted sites is increased .",
    "the efficiency of this concept depends on the materials of the particles ( cobalt and manganese ferrites , encapsulated or coated  @xcite ) , the blood flow rate and the intensity of the magnetic field  @xcite .",
    "it is found that , this method is more efficient in small blood vessels with low blood flow rates than large blood vessels , where the flow rate is higher .",
    "a small size of particles implies a magnetic response of reduced strength and as a result , it is difficult to drive particles and keep them in the targeted region  @xcite . in order to overcome this difficulty the use of magnetic particles to create aggregations",
    "is proposed in order to increase the magnetic response  @xcite .",
    "the total magnetic moment of clusters is higher than that of isolated particles , and therefore , cluster are more magnetically responsive  @xcite .",
    "the ratio of the velocity of the aggregates to the velocity of an individual particle was found to reach a constant value independent of the aspect ratio value  @xcite .",
    "the magnetization of nanospheres increases as a result of the increase in the concentration of matter along the direction of the field .",
    "this increase leads to the observed change in velocity  @xcite .",
    "when the aggregations reach the targeted region , they break up into single particles .",
    "this break up can be achieved by using superparamagnetic particles that lose the magnetization after moving out from the magnetic field  @xcite .",
    "the size of aggregates is a very important parameter , since large aggregations could form clots in small arteries . on the other hand ,",
    "a small aggregation would be dragged away from the cardiovascular system circulation .",
    "therefore , the size of aggregation has an important role in the effort to create an efficient propulsion through the blood vessels .",
    "magnetic drug targeting is possible in treating superficially located diseases , such as tumors and vascular diseases .",
    "the treatment of tissues located away from the body surface is not possible because the magnetic force decrease with the increasing distance from the electromagnetic coil  @xcite . in order to overcome this",
    "difficulty magnets are implemented near the targeted sites  @xcite .    since an analytical study of aggregation process is impossible to be developed , a numerical model for magnetically guided drug delivery",
    "is attended .",
    "the method that is proposed here simulates the movement of aggregated magnetic particles in a fluid environment .",
    "the numerical model can simulate the number of resulting aggregations whose size and pattern depend on the concentration and the strength of the magnetic field .",

    "for the propulsion model of the particles , six major forces are considered , i.e. the magnetic force from mri s main magnet static field as well as the magnetic field gradient force from the special propulsion gradient coils .",
    "the static field caters for the aggregation of nanoparticles while the magnetic gradient navigates the agglomerations .",

    "for this reason , two basic particle suspension flows were selected where particles are influenced by a constant and in the second case a gradient magnetic field .",
    "simulations with the present method is more expensive as the number of particles increases because magnetic moments should be calculated for every particle and for every time step .",

    "it aims also at simulating the motion of aggregations when these are driven by mri magnetic gradient coils .",
    "a novel method is developed for the calculation of the drag coefficient that takes into account the exposed area of the particle in the fluid .",
