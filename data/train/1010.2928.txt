    "remarkably , the amplitude ( droplet height ) approaches a limiting value for a domain size of about @xmath100 .",

    "note finally , that everything discussed above for non - volatile films regarding the infinite number of primary solution branches as well applies to the branches shown in fig .",

    "after the short analysis of the the volatile and non - volatile thin liquid film system we next focus on a thin film equation that describes the evolution of a solid film .",
    "[ sec : epitak ]    the final example is a thin film model for the epitaxial evolution of surfaces of crystalline solids for a fixed ammount of deposited material that is illustrated here employing a simplified glued wetting - layer model @xcite .",

    "due to the higher order terms in the energy ( [ eq : en2 ] ) as compared to the functional ( [ eq : en1 ] ) studied up to now , the dispersion curves ( fig .",
    "[ fig : epi - disp ] ) are qualitatively quite different from the ones for dewetting ( fig .",
    "[ fig : dew - disp ] ) . in consequence",
    "we expect a rather different picture for the steady state solutions as well . at the parameter values allowing for two",
    "critical wavenumbers @xmath115 and @xmath116 , i.e.  for @xmath117 , one finds two bifurcations from the trivial solutions at domain sizes @xmath118 and @xmath119 , respectively .",
    "near onset one expects the two emerging branches to interconnect , as at onset the solution space should change only locally . further above onset the behaviour might , however , be dramatically different .",
    "the two branches bifurcating at @xmath118 and @xmath119 are the first of two infinite series of primary solution branches that bifurcate at respective domain sizes @xmath120 and @xmath121 with @xmath82 .",
    "this consideration is of importance here , as the various primary branches may actually couple .",

    "are the norm ( left column ) and energy ( right column ) of the solutions on the various branches for three ( positive ) values of the strength of the wetting interaction . a selection of film thickness profiles is given in fig .  [ fig : epi - prof ] .",
    "as the strength of the wetting interaction decreases the system gets deeper into the unstable regime and the behaviour becomes more intricate . in the upper row of fig .",
    "[ fig : epi - fam ] we are slightly above onset and the two @xmath64 branches that emerge at the two zero crossings of the dispersion relation actually connect as expected .",

    "single - quantum - dot ( @xmath64 ) solutions only exist for a small range of periods @xmath123 , i.e. , the system is not able to undergo any coarsening .",
    "this corresponds well to the results obtained in @xcite using weakly nonlinear analysis and integration in time . in the following",
    "we will call the branch emerging at @xmath124 [ @xmath125 the left [ right ] @xmath126 branch",
    ".    the picture changes , however , further above onset , i.e. , when decreasing the wetting interactons ( middle row of fig .",
    "[ fig : epi - fam ] ) .",
    "the two @xmath64 branches do not interconnect any more .",
    "actually , the left @xmath64 branch continues towards @xmath127 without any side branches .",
    "the left @xmath65 branch may change its stability with respect to coarsening with increasing domain size . every time it changes stability",
    "a secondary branch bifurcates in a period doubling bifurcation rather similar to the scenario described for driven liquid films on inlined plates @xcite .",
    "the right @xmath64 branch connects via one of the branching points to the left @xmath65 branch .",
    "the behaviour becomes increasingly involved for higher branch numbers .",
    "decreasing the wetting interaction even more brings the system further above threshhold ( bottom row of fig .  [",
    "fig : epi - fam ] ) .",
    "as @xmath115 becomes quite small the right @xmath64 branch bifurcates at very large domain sizes .",
    "however , the first secondary branch of the left @xmath65 branch now split up into various pieces that connect different left branches via secondary bifurcations .",
    "we will at present not go deeper into the analysis .",
    "in particular no proper stability analysis for the steady states is done here and as above for the dewetting system time evolution is not touched .",
    "simulations can be found , for instance , in refs .",
    "note that the results on stability sketched in the previous paragraph are infered from the structure of the bifurcation diagrams alone .",
    "they need to be scrutinized in detail as they are very important for the coarsening behaviour .",
    "the non - monotonous dependence of energy on system size in fig .",
    "[ fig : epi - fam ] indicates that coarsening will depend on structure length in a non - trivial way .",
    "the long - time corsening for epitaxial growth is discussed , e.g. , in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the results presented for the glued wetting - layer model indicate that our knowledge about epitaxial growth would benefit from a more detailed analysis that maps out the steady solutions and their stability systematically for the various models proposed in the literature .",
    "numerical techniques are available to do this not only for two - dimensional but as well for three - dimensional systems @xcite .",
    "in the present contribution we have applied a basic mathematical analysis to three different physical systems involving solid and liquid films at solid surfaces that may undergo a structuring process by dewetting , evaporation / condensation or epitaxial growth , respectively .",
    "the aim has been to highlight similarities and differences of the three systems based on the observation that all of them can be described using models of similar form , i.e. , a time evolution equation for a purely dissipative system without any inertia based on a gradient dynamics that is characterized by mobility functions and an underlying energy functional .",
    "thereby the dynamics might have a non - conserved and/or conserved part .",
    "equations , like the well known cahn - hilliard ( purely conserved ) and allen - cahn ( purely non - conserved ) equations represent limiting cases ( with respect to the chosen dynamics ) of this general evolution equation .",
    "they are normally used with a particularly simple form of the energy functional as well .",
    "the three physical systems discussed here all fit into the general framework when chosing different mobilities and/or energy functionals . beside the mathematical similarity",
    "the systems do as well model similar physical phenomena as the respective liquid and solid films structure under the influence of their effective interaction with the substrate .",
    "however , although most readers will agree that the epitaxial growth of quantum dots is a subject of surface science less of them might do so in the case of a dewetting liquid film .",
    "we hope that our review contributes to the development of a more unified view onto these processes of self - organisation at interfaces .",
    "in particular , we have used two basic steps of mathematical analysis , namely the study of the linear stability of homogeneous steady states , i.e. , flat films , and the mapping of non - trivial steady states , i.e. , drop / hole ( quantum dot ) in dependence of system size for various values of interaction constants and/or mean film thickness .",
    "our aim has been to illustrate that the underlying solution structure might be very complex as in the case of epitaxial growth but can be understood better when comparing to the much simpler results for the dewetting liquid film .",
    "we have furthermore shown that the continuation techniques employed can shed some light on this structure in a more convenient way than time - stepping methods .",
    "one might further argue that understanding the solution structure of the quantum - dot system might as well allow to predict pathways of evolution in time for an epitaxial layer as the behaviour will ultimately be determined by the steady solutions and their stability .",
    "this procedure was already followed for thin liquid films @xcite .    the usage of a general formulation like eq .",
    "( [ film ] ) does not only relate seemingly not related physical systems mathematically .",
    "it does as well allow to discuss model extensions in a more unified way .",
    "taking epitaxial growth as example , the general form ( [ film ] ) would propose that in the non - conserved case , i.e. , when material is deposited from the gas phase continuously the non - conserved part of the equation should be @xmath128 with @xmath33 given by ( [ eq : en2 ] ) .",
    "the constant depostion often used in the literature would then only refer to the limit of a rather large chemical potential .",
    "oblique deposition of material @xcite might as well be modelled incorporating beside the vertical influx as well lateral driving contributions .",
    "the here reviewed formulation can be extended in a straightforward way to the case of @xmath129 coupled fields @xmath130 following a gradient dynamics that is governed by an energy functional @xmath131 $ ] .",
    "the evolution equation is @xmath132 \\,-\\ , { \\mathbf{\\underline{m}}}_{\\mathrm{nc}}\\cdot\\frac{\\delta f}{\\delta{\\boldsymbol{\\phi } } } { \\label{filmvec}}\\ ] ] with the @xmath133 and @xmath134 being symmetric positive - definite mobility matrices for the conserved and non - conserved part of the dynamics , respectively .",
    "they are formed by @xmath135 mobility functions , respectively .",
    "note that @xmath136 corresponds to a vector of dimension @xmath129 .",
    "a typical example is the evolution of a dewetting two - layer system where the @xmath137 and @xmath138 correspond to the two film thicknesses , respectively .",
    "the formulation as a special case of ( [ filmvec ] ) is derived from the navier - stokes equations in the two liquid layers and appropriate boundary conditions for spatially two- and three - dimensional settings in refs .",
    "@xcite . the formulation in the form of eq .",
    "( [ filmvec ] ) has the advantage that one can easily check the consistencey of the mobility functions after a normally rather involved derivation .",
    "furthermore one can draw on rather general results , e.g. , for the linear stability of flat film solutions @xcite .",
    "note , that such a formulation will apply to any multi - layer system in a relaxational setting , including films of dielectric liquids in a capacitor @xcite or multilayer pending films under the influence of gravity .",
    "we expect it to hold as well for the relaxation dynamics of multilayer epitaxial films .",
    "let us finally note that we have entirely excluded spatially heterogeneous systems , i.e. , systems described by equations of form  ( [ film ] ) where the energy depends explicitly on position .",
    "such systems are already treated for dewetting films @xcite , however , we are not aware of any such studies for epitaxial growth .",
    "we have as well excluded laterally driven systems described by equations like ( [ film ] ) that additionally include lateral driving forces . a comparison of sliding droplets on an incline @xcite",
    ", a driven ( or convective ) cahn - hilliard system @xcite and epitaxial growth under oblique deposition might be rather interesting , for instance , in terms of coarsening behaviour @xcite . the combination of both effects , i.e. , heterogeneous systems with lateral driving allows to describe the depinning and stick - slip motion of droplets @xcite .",
    "the problems has up to now , however , no counterpart in epitaxial growth .",
