    "our @xmath0 photometry , although inferior in depth to that obtained with the hst , covers a much larger area of m4 and thus offers a possibility to uncover new young bright wd candidates at the top of the cooling sequence , located in less crowded regions .",

    "b1 ( y453 ) has been previously studied spectroscopically by moehler , landsman & napiwotzki ( 1998 ) .",

    "( 1997 ) classification scheme .",
    "the precise classification is somewhat uncertain , as it is based on only three lines in the 300   overlap between our and their spectra : the line at 4339   and lines at 4388   and 4471  .",
    "the spectrum of b3 exhibits broad balmer lines and two lines from singly ionized helium ( 4026   and 4471  ) and none from .",
    "it appears to be an sdb : he1 subdwarf .",
    "the spectrum of b2 , which appears to he helium - rich , is quite unusual .",
    "hot subdwarfs in globular clusters are almost always found to be helium - poor ( e.g.  moehler et al .",
    "only one hot helium - rich subdwarf in a globular cluster has been reported to date ( moehler et al .",
    "b2 seems to be only the second such star known .",
    "brown et al .  ( 2001 ) suggest that such stars might have undergone late helium - core flash while descending the wd cooling sequence",
    ". a convection zone produced during the helium flash would mix hydrogen into the hot interior , where it would be consumed , thus greatly enhancing the envelope helium abundance .",
    "however , b2 seems to be too luminous for their scenario .    the hot subdwarf b3 and",
    "possibly b2 could belong to a vertical extended horizontal branch ( ehb ) , not reported in previous studies of this cluster .",
    "generally the globular cluster horizontal branch ( hb ) morphology correlates with metallicity - the hb becomes redder as the mean metal abundance increases .",
    "however , variations in hb morphology at a given metallicity are observed and a second , still unknown parameter has to be introduced .",
    "it has been suggested that mass loss on the red giant branch may be the second parameter ( catelan 2000 ) .",
    "the stars which suffered strong mass loss would become ehb stars ( dcruz et al .",
    "1996 , dcruz 1998 ) .",
    "recently the existence of high - metallicity hot blue horizontal branch stars has been reported in the relatively metal - rich globular clusters ngc 1851 ( bellazzini et al .",

    "detailed study of the nature of such extreme horizontal branch stars could provide valuable clues regarding the unknown second parameter .",
    "an alternative explanation for b4 is that it is a low - mass helium wd .",
    "similar stars have been identified in the globular cluster ngc 6397 ( cool et al .",

    "1997 ) , lbqs ( hewett et al . 1995 ) and the 2df qso survey ( boyle et al . 2000 ) we estimate the probability of b4 being a quasar to be between 2% and 48% .",
    "we have checked the subdwarf candidates for variability in our observations spanning 5 days and found them to be constant within the errors of the photometry .    in table",

    "these objects are located in the outer , less crowded regions of the cluster ( compared to the hst wd sample ) and are bright enough for ground - based spectroscopy .",
    "all of the principal sequences on the cmds display a broadening due to the differential reddening across the face of the cluster , as discussed by cudworth & rees ( 1990 ) , fahlman et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , and alcaino et al .",
    "the differential reddening has been investigated by lyons et al .",
    "( 1995 ) using ki column density measurements towards 16 stars and by ivans et al .",
    "( 1999 ; 2000 ) on the basis of spectroscopic analysis of 22 red giant branch stars .",
    "these studies revealed the existence of a patchy reddening variation across the cluster face .",
    "in addition , peterson , rees & cudworth ( 1995 ) found evidence for an unusually high value of @xmath52 .",
    "we have constructed an @xmath53 element differential reddening map following closely the procedure presented by von braun & mateo ( 2000 ) , based on the approach of kaluzny & krzeminski ( 1993 ) .",
    "the errors were also derived as described therein , taking into account the correlation between the errors in color and magnitude .",
    "we adopted @xmath54 in our analysis .",
    "figure [ fig : ebv ] presents the derived map of differential reddening , measured relative to the section with the lowest reddening .",
    "the extinction appears to be weakest in the east and increases to the west , in accordance with results obtained in previous studies ( eg .",
    "alcaino et al .",
    "the patchy nature of the reddening is also confirmed .",
    "we have compared our differential extinction map with the schlegel , finkbeiner & davis ( 1998 ; hereafter sfd ) dust map .",
    "there is some qualitative similarity between the two maps : both show lowest reddening in the northeastern corner , intermediate in the southwestern and higher in the northwestern corners .",
    "the maps disagree as to the reddening in the southeastern section : the sfd map shows the strongest reddening there , while it is rather small on our map .",
    "another difference is that the differential reddening is larger on our map ( up to 0.074 ) than on the sfd map ( up to 0.039 ) .",
    "we have checked a larger area around m4 on the sfd map and noted that it is located in a region of highly variable extinction .",
    "the cluster coincides with the center of a void with patchy lower extinction ( @xmath55 ) some @xmath56 surrounded by thick filaments of higher extinction ( @xmath57 mag ) .",
    "moreover , we notice that the @xmath4 values from the sfd map range from 0.472 to 0.511 mag for the cluster area , which is substantially higher than the reddening value of @xmath58 mag reported for m4 by harris ( 1996 ) .",
    "this discrepancy might be due to the fact that the sfd map also takes into account the extinction caused by dust located behind the cluster . this interpretation would invalidate to large extent any comparison between the two reddening maps .      to derive the @xmath5 fiducial sequence we have selected a region of uniform reddening using the differential reddening map constructed in subsection [ sub : red ] .",
    "this region is shown in figure [ fig : ebv ] surrounded with a thick line .",
    "the fiducial points were determined separately for the main sequence ( ms ; @xmath59 ) , the subgiant branch ( sgb ; @xmath60 ) and the red giant branch ( rgb ; @xmath61 ) . for the ms and sgb ,",
    "the fiducial points were determined by finding the mode of the color distribution , smoothed with a boxcar filter 0.03 mag in length , in magnitude bins 0.21 and 0.135 mag wide , respectively .",
    "the magnitude for each bin was computed as the mean . in case of the rgb we adopted a different procedure , as this branch is more sparsely populated than the previous two . to avoid contamination of the rgb sample , especially with the agb and hb stars ,",
    "the following magnitude - dependent color cuts were applied : @xmath62 . for the rgb ,",
    "the fiducial points were computed as the mean color in magnitude bins 0.55 mag wide .",
    "the magnitudes within each bin were determined as the mean , just as for the ms and sgb .",
    "the resultant fiducial sequence is presented in figure [ fig : fid ] , superimposed on the cmd which was used in their derivation .",
    "the fiducial sequence is listed in table [ tab : fid ] .",
    "we have obtained an independent estimate of foreground extinction in b - v towards m4 from comparison of the fiducial sequence constructed in the previous subsection with the one given by sandquist et al .",
    "( 1996 ) for the m5 globular cluster .",
    "we have chosen m5 for this purpose due to its low reddening ( e(b - v ) = 0.03 ; harris 1996 ) , similar metallicity ( [ fe / h ] = -1.11 dex as compared with -1.19 dex for m4 ; carretta & gratton 1997 ) and similar age ( @xmath63 gyr ; rosenberg et al .",
    "1999 ) .    to determine the @xmath23 colors of the cluster turnoffs ( to ) we fitted the fiducial points in the turnoff regions with a fifth order chebyshev polynomial .",

    "this is consistent with the value of 0.36 listed by harris ( 1996 ) , taking into account the variability of the extinction across the face of the cluster .",

    "we have compared it with spectra for stars of types b through f , taken from the spectral atlas of pickles ( 1998 ) .",
    "our spectrum is consistent with types from late b through late a. the dereddened colors @xmath65 and @xmath66 suggest v46 is a late b type star . in order to be a main sequence late b star ( @xmath67 ) , at @xmath68 it would have to be located at a distance modulus of @xmath69 mag or 52 kpc ( assuming the larger @xmath70 from schlegel et al .",
