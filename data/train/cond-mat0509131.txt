    "entanglement and non - locality of epr ( einstein - podolsky - rosen ) pairs @xcite or schrdinger cat states@xcite are the most intriguing and profound features of quantum mechanics .",
    "they give rise to , even in the absence of interaction , correlations between spatially separated particles , which can not be described as a product of the quantum states of the two particles , and can not be explained by any local hidden variable and realistic theory.@xcite however , these nonclassical and non - local correlations of entanglement have been tested convincingly by bell - inequality - type measurements in optics.@xcite besides the fundamental aspects , a great deal of efforts have been made to utilize the properties of entangled particles for quantum information , quantum computation or other potential applications  @xcite .",
    "it is foreseeable that the realistic and applicable quantum devices should be composed of solid state elements .",
    "therefore , it is significant and desirable to understand the entangled charged particles .",
    "recently , much interest has been taken in entanglement of electrons in solid state environment.@xcite unlike photons , electrons carry charge and spin .",
    "the coulomb interaction between electron and external electric field makes it flexible to be manipulated .",
    "moreover , recent experiments showed that electron spin in a semiconductor has a relative long dephasing time , approximately microseconds , and it can be transported coherently over 100 micrometers@xcite .",
    "these properties make electron a promising candidate for quantum applications . a few proposals based on electrons showed how to create an entangled pair of electrons in solid state systems , _",
    "e.g. _ , superconductors@xcite or quantum dots@xcite , as a source of entangled beams of electrons .    to detect and manipulate the spin entanglement ,",
    "the electric current noise of a beam splitter as a test of spin entanglement was proposed by samuelsson _",
    "et al_@xcite , burkard _",
    "et al_@xcite and carlos _ et al_. in these schemes , the orbital symmetry of the entangled electron wave function can be probed directly by the current noise ( shot noise ) .",
    "since the total wave function consists of orbital part and spin part , the symmetry of the orbital degree of freedom is intrinsically related to that of the spin via the pauli exclusive principle or the parity requirement for the wave function for indistinguishable particles  @xcite .",
    "this intrinsic relation between orbital and spin in the two - electron wave function imposes an essential connection between the spin and the orbital for the entangled electrons .",
    "if one alters the spin symmetry of the pair wave function , it will definitely change the orbital symmetry of the total wave function@xcite .",
    "geometric phase such as berry phase plays an important role in quantum systems with cyclic evolution . particularly , in nanoscale electronic devices",
    "@xcite , a surprising effect is that a quantum system retains a memory of its motion when it undergoes a cyclic evolution  @xcite . in quantum information processing ,",
    "berry phase shows purely geometric characteristics that can be used to tolerate external parameter fluctuations@xcite .",
    "it has been shown that berry phase can be used to implement conditional phase shifts , which gives quantum computing an ability to execute conditional dynamics between two quantum bits ( qubit ) , where the state of one qubit affects the evolution of the other qubit during a quantum computation  @xcite .",
    "actually , berry phase has been demonstrated in many systems , such as nmr  @xcite , neutron beams  @xcite and nanostructures@xcite , which are merely in single particle literature .",
    "sjqvist considered the geometric phase for entangled spin-@xmath1 pairs in a time - independent uniform magnetic field@xcite , and tong _ el al _ considered the geometric phase for entangled states of two spin-@xmath1 particles in rotating magnetic field  @xcite .",
    "they showed that the geometric phase acquired by one of the entangled particles is always affected by the other particle which is even a free state .",
    "however , for unentangled particles , the geometric phase for the product state equals the sum of geometric phases acquired by each particle@xcite .",
    "thus studies on entangled quantum systems are still in its infancy .",
    "in this paper we study the influence of the berry phase on the entangled states and polarized states of two spin-1/2 electrons by taking account of the correlation of the two electrons .",
    "we adopt the same approach as in ref.@xcite and take for granted the existence of an entangler constituted by a superconductor and quantum dots @xcite that are in coulomb blockade regime . the setup shown in fig.1",
    "consists of an entangler and a beam splitter . in this scheme ,",
    "two electrons incoming from lead 1 and 2 are scattered to lead 3 and 4 .",
    "berry phase is generated by imposing an adiabatically rotating magnetic field on one of the paths of the incoming leads .",
    "the geometric phase is associated with nonvanishing dynamical phase generally .",
    "the dynamical phase ought to be diminished by some means for that it will spoil the effect of berry phase .",
    "we use the well - developed technique , spin - echo approach  @xcite , to compensate the dynamical phase and make the states sensitive to berry phase .",
    "the epr pairs of electrons emitted from the entangler are generally singlet or triplet states  @xcite . in the scheme of ref .",
    "@xcite three triplet states can not be distinguished from each other due to the same symmetries of spatial wave functions _",
    "i.e. _ , the same anti - bunching behaviors . the improved approach  @xcite can distinguish the entangled and spin polarized beams by imposing a rashba interaction on one of the pair electrons . for the spin polarized electrons , only the polarization along @xmath0-axis is nonzero in the current autocorrelation ( shot noise ) .",
    "the electrons polarized along @xmath2-axis show noiseless .",
    "it also shows that @xmath2 component of an entangled triplet @xmath3 and @xmath0 component of unentangled triplet @xmath4 are noisy while the triplets of entangled @xmath0 component @xmath5 model and formulation ---------------------    the hamiltonian of an electron in rotating magnetic fields is @xmath6 where @xmath7 represents a free motion and the second term represents the zeeman energy ; @xmath8 is the bohr magneton , @xmath9 the land factor and @xmath10 the pauli matrices . here",
