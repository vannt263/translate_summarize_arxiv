    "in the feature classification domain , the choice of data affects widely the results .",
    "the problem of feature selection is commonly reencountered when we have @xmath0 features ( or attributes ) that express @xmath0 vectors of measures for @xmath1 substances ( called classes ) . the problematic is to find @xmath2 vectors among @xmath0 , such as relevant and no redundant ones ; in order to classify substances .",
    "the number of selected vectors @xmath2 must be lower than @xmath0 because when @xmath0 is so large that needs many cases to detect the relationship between the vectors and the classes ( hughes phenomenon ) [ 10 ] .",
    "no redundant features ( vectors ) because they complicate the learning system and product incorrect prediction [ 14 ] .",
    "relevant vectors means there ability to predicate the classes . the hyperspectral image ( his ) , as a set of more than a hundred bidirectional measures ( called bands ) , of the same region ( called ground truth map : gt ) ,",
    "needs reduction dimensionality .",
    "indeed the bands do nt all contain the information ; some bands are irrelevant like those affected by various atmospheric effects , see figure.3 , and decrease the classification accuracy .",
    "finaly there exist redundant bands , must be avoided .",
    "we can reduce the dimensionality of hyperspectral images by selecting only the relevant bands ( feature selection or subset selection methodology ) , or extracting , from the original bands , new bands containing the maximal information about the classes , using any functions , logical or numerical ( feature extraction methodology ) [ 8][9][11 ] . here",
    "we introduce an algorithm based on mutual information , reducing dimensionality in too steps : pick up the relevant bands first , and avoiding redundancy second .",
    "we illustrate the principea of this algorithm using synthetic bands for the scene of his aviris 92av3c [ 1 ] , figure.1.then we approve its effectiveness with applying it to real datat of hsi aviris 92av3c .",
    "so each pixel is shown as a vector of 220 components .",
    ". shows the vector pixels notion [ 7 ] .",
    "so reducing dimensionality means selecting only the dimensions caring a lot of information regarding the classes .",
    "the hyperspectral image aviris 92av3c ( airborne visible infrared imaging spectrometer)[2 ] contains 220 images taken on the region `` indiana pine '' at `` north - western indiana '' , usa [ 1 ] .",
    "the 220 called bands are taken between m and m. each band has 145 lines and 145 columns .",
    "the ground truth map is also provided , but only 10366 pixels ( 49% ) are labeled fro 1 to 16 .",
    "each label indicates one from 16 classes .",
    "the zeros indicate pixels how are not classified yet , figure.1 .",
    "the hyperspectral image aviris 92av3c contains numbers between 955 and 9406 .",
    "each pixel of the ground truth map has a set of 220 numbers ( measures ) along the hyperspectral image .",
    "those numbers ( measures ) represent the reflectance of the pixel in each band .",
    "so the pixel is shown as vector off 220 components .",
    "figure .2 .",
    "we can also note that not all classes are carrier of information . in figure.5 ,",
    "for example , we can show the effects of atmospheric effects on bands : 155 , 220 and other bands .",
    "this hyperspectral image presents the problematic of dimensionality reduction .",
    "figure.2 shows the vector pixel s notion [ 7 ] .",
    "so reducing dimensionality means selecting only the dimensions caring a lot of information regarding the classes .",
    "this is a measure of exchanged information between tow ensembles of random variables a and b : @xmath3    considering the ground truth map , and bands as ensembles of random variables , we calculate their interdependence .",
    "fano [ 14 ] has demonstrated that as soon as mutual information of already selected feature has high value , the error probability of classification is decreasing , according to the formula bellow : @xmath4with : @xmath5 and : @xmath6 the expression of conditional entropy @xmath7 is calculated between the ground truth map ( i.e. the classes @xmath1 ) and the subset of bands candidates @xmath8 .",
    "@xmath9 is the number of classes .",
    "so when the features @xmath8 have a higher value of mutual information with the ground truth map , ( is more near to the ground truth map ) , the error probability will be lower .",
    "but its difficult to compute this conjoint mutual information @xmath10 , regarding the high dimensionality [ 14 ]",
    ". + figure.4 . shows the mi between the gt and synthetic bands . the figure .6 shows the mi between the gt and the real bands of his aviris 92av3c [ 1 ] .",
    "+ many studies use a threshold to choice the relevant bands .",
    "guo [ 3 ] uses the mutual information to select the top ranking band , and a filter based algorithm to decide if there neighbours are redundant or not .",
    "sarhrouni et al .",
    "[ 17 ] use also a filter strategy based algorithm on mi to select bands . a wrapper strategy based algorithm on mi , sarhrouni et al .",
    "[ 18 ] is also introduced .",

    ", we can retain fewer bands .",
    "we can visually verify this effectiveness of mi to choice relevant features in figure.4 .",

    "for this section we synthesize 19 bands from the gt , figure.1 , by adding noise , cutting some substances etc .",

    "we can show the mutual information of gt and the synthetic bands at figure.5 .              with a threshold 0.4 of mi calculated in figure.4",

    "+ zone5 : here we make a hard control of redundancy , but the bands candidates are more near to the gt , and they my be more redundant .",
    "so we ca nt have interesting results .",
    "+ zone6 : when we do not control properly the relevance , some bands affected bay transfer affects may be non redundant , and can be selected , so the accuracy of classification is decreasing .",
    "+ partial conclusion : this algorithm is very effectiveness for redundancy and relevance control , in feature selection area .",
    "+ the most difference of this algorithm regarding previous works is the separation of the tow process : avoiding redundancy and selecting more informative bands .",
    "sarhrouni et al . [",
    "17 ] use also a filter strategy based algorithm on mi to select bands , and an another wrapper strategy algorithm also based on mi [ 18 ] , guo[3 ] used a filter strategy with threshold control redundancy , but in those works , the tow process , i.e avoiding redundancy and avoiding no informative bands , are made at the same time by the same threshold .",
    "+            figure.7",
    ". illustrates the reconstruction of the ground truth map gt , for a redundancy threshold 0.56 and relevance threshold im=0.9 .",
    "the accuracy classification is 84.16% for 42 bands selected .",
    "the figure.7 gives also a general classification of the entire scene indiana pin [ 1 ] ; the pixels not labelled in gt , are here classified .",
    "this illustrates the power of generalisation of the proposed method .",
    "+ we can not here that hui wang [ 15 ] uses two axioms to characterize feature selection .",
    "sufficiency axiom : the subset selected feature must be able to reproduce the training simples without losing information .",
    "the necessity axiom `` simplest among different alternatives is preferred for prediction '' . in the algorithm",
    "proposed , reducing error uncertainty between the truth map and the estimated minimize the information loosed for the samples training and also the predicate ones .",
    "we not also that we can use the number of features selected like condition to stop the search . [",
    "until recently , in the data mining field , and features selection in high dimensionality the problematic is always open .",
    "some heuristic methods and algorithms have to select relevant and no redundant subset features . in this paper",
    "we introduce an algorithm in order to process separately the relevance and the redundancy .",
    "we apply our method to classify the region indiana pin with the hyperspectral image aviris 92av3c .",
    "this algorithm is a filter strategy ( i.e. with no call to classifier during the selection ) . in the first step we use mutual information to pick up relevant bands by thresholding ( like most method already used ) .",
    "the second step introduces a new algorithm to measure redundancy with symmetric uncertainty coefficient .",
    "we conclude the effectiveness of our method and algorithm the select the relevant and no redundant bands .",
    "this algorithm allows us a wide area of possible fasted applications .",
    "but the question is always open : no guaranties that the chosen bands are the optimal ones ; because some redundancy can be important to reinforcement of learning classification system .",
    "so the thresholds controlling relevance redundancy is a very useful tool to calibre the selection , in real time applications .",
    "this is a very positive point for our algorithm ; it can be implemented in a real time application , because in commercial applications , the inexpensive filtering algorithms are urgently preferred .    1 d. landgrebe , `` on information extraction principles for hyperspectral data : a white paper , '' purdue university , west lafayette , in , technical report , school of electrical and computer engineering , 1997 .",
