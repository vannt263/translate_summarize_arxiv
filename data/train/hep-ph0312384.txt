    "recent high-@xmath2 rhic experimantal results on pion production in central @xmath1 collision at mid - rapidity at @xmath4 and @xmath5 agev have shown a strong suppression compared to binary scaled @xmath6 data  @xcite .",
    "analysing this effect in different impact parameter ranges , the suppression vanishes with increasing centrality . in @xmath3",
    "the lack of the suppression  @xcite was found also . a quantitative analysis of the suppression pattern , the so called _ `` jet - tomography '' _  @xcite , yields information about the physical aspects of the produced dense matter and the impact parameter dependence of the formation of deconfined matter in @xmath1 collisions .",
    "latest data on @xmath3 collision confirmed that initial state effects can not be responsible for suppression in @xmath1 collision .",
    "thus medium induced non - abelian jet - energy loss in the final state becomes a strong candidate to explain the missing pion yield .",
    "jet energy loss can be calculated in a perturbative quantum chromodynamics ( pqcd ) frame  @xcite .",
    "our aim is to calculate @xmath0 production in nucleus - nucleus @xmath7 collision in a pqcd improved parton model , taking into account a phenomenological intrinsic transverse momentum distribution ( intrinsic-@xmath8 ) for the colliding partons , which is necessary to get better agreement between data and calculations in @xmath6 collisions  @xcite . for @xmath7 collision we included initial state effects into our calculations : nuclear multiple scattering , saturation in the number of semihard collisions , and shadowing effect inside nucleus .",
    "we used glauber - like collision geometry .    here",
    "we investigate jet energy loss . as high - energy quark and",
    "gluon jets are travelling throught dense colored matter , they can lost their energy described by induced gluon radiation in thin non - abelian matter .",
    "the glv - description  @xcite of energy loss can be included into the pqcd improved parton model as a strong final state effect . comparing theory to data we can extract the opacity values ( @xmath9 ) of the produced colored matter at different centralities .",
    "applying the above sketched model for reproducing @xmath0 yields in @xmath1 , and @xmath3 collisions we can accomplish a tomographic analysis of the produced dense and colored matter in reactions . in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] we display the nuclear modification factor : @xmath10 as a function of @xmath2 for pion production from central to peripheral @xmath1 ( _ lower curves _ ) and in @xmath3 ( _ the upper curve _ ) . in the most central @xmath1 collision the measured suppression",
    "is reproduced with opacity @xmath11 3.5 . as fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] displays , in @xmath1 collisions the suppression of the high - energy pions goes away with decreasing centrality , which is followed by the descreasing values of the opacity . in @xmath3 collision",
    "we do not need to include jet quenching to reproduce pion production , this final state effect does not appear there , only multiscattering and shadowing .",
