    "it seems nowadays unavoidable to resort to higher order fock space components to tame the bewildering landscape arising with these new findings .",
    "four  quark components , either pure or mixed with @xmath0 states , constitute a natural explanation for the proliferation of new meson states  @xcite .",

    "four - quark systems present a richer color structure than standard baryons or mesons .",
    "while the color wave function for standard mesons and baryons leads to a single vector , working with four  quark states there are different vectors driving to a singlet color state out of colorless or colored quark - antiquark two - body components .",
    "thus , dealing with four  quark states an important question is whether we are in front of a colorless meson - meson molecule or a compact state , i.e. , a system with two - body colored components . while the first structure would be natural in the naive quark model",

    "if @xmath5 and @xmath6 are identical quarks and antiquarks then , a general four - quark wave function can be expanded in terms of color singlet - singlet nonorthogonal vectors and therefore the determination of the probability of physical channels becomes cumbersome .",

    "[ f4 ] we see how the size of the four  quark state increases when @xmath139 .",

    "antiquark distance ( @xmath118 ) remains almost constant .",
    "this reinforces our previous result , pointing to the appearance of two meson like structures whenever the binding energy goes to zero .",
    "this illustrative example emphasizes the importance of performing a simultaneous analysis both of energy and wave function in order to detect bound states in the vicinity of a two - meson threshold .    to illustrate in more detail the differences observed in the calculated four  quark wave functions we depict in fig .",

    "we present results for an unbound , a molecular and a bound state , showing the position distribution for the different planes @xmath143 , and @xmath144 .",
    "clear differences among them can be observed . the position distribution for the unbound case spreads in the @xmath145 and @xmath146 coordinates up to 60 fm , while the bound and molecular systems are restricted to the region below 3 fm ( molecular ) and 1 fm ( bound ) .",
    "in the @xmath144 plane the unbound state is so widely spread that the values for the position distribution are three orders of magnitude lower than in the @xmath147 and @xmath148 cases , and therefore they will not appear in the picture unless artificially magnified . in the case of the molecular state a long range tail propagating in the @xmath149 region can be observed contrary to the constrained values obtained for bound systems .",
    "the conclusions derived are independent of the quark - quark interaction used .",
    "they mainly rely on using the same hamiltonian to describe tensors of different order , two and four - quark components in the present case . dealing with a complete basis ,",
    "any four - quark bound deeply bound state has to be compact . only slightly bound systems could be considered as molecular .",
    "unbound states correspond to a two - meson system .",
    "a similar situation would be found in the two baryon system , the deuteron could be considered as a molecular like state with a small percentage of its wave function on the @xmath150 channel , while the @xmath151dibaryon would be a compact six  quark state . working with central forces ,",
    "the only way of getting a bound system is to have a strong interaction between the constituents that are far apart in the asymptotic limit , quarks or antiquarks in the present case . in this case",
    "the short - range interaction will capture part of the probability of a two - meson threshold to form a bound state .",
    "this can be reinterpreted as an infinite sum over physical states .",
    "this is why the analysis performed in the present manuscript is so important before concluding the existence of compact four  quark states beyond simple molecular structures .",
    "if the prescription of using the same hamiltonian to describe all tensors in the fock space is relaxed , new scenarios may appear . among them",
    ", the inclusion of many  body forces is particularly relevant . in ref .",
    "@xcite the stability of @xmath8 and @xmath152 systems was analyzed in a simple string model considering only a multiquark confining interaction given by the minimum of a flip - flop or a butterfly potential in an attempt to discern whether confining interactions not factorizable as two  body potentials would influence the stability of four  quark states .",
    "the ground state of systems made of two quarks and two antiquarks of equal masses was found to be below the dissociation threshold . while for the cryptoexotic @xmath153 the binding decreases when increasing the mass ratio @xmath154 , for the flavor exotic @xmath8 the effect of mass symmetry breaking is opposite .",
    "others scenarios may emerge if different many  body forces , like many  body color interactions  @xcite or t hooft instanton  based three - body interactions  @xcite , are considered .",
    "in this work we have developed the necessary formalism to express the wave function of a general four  quark state in terms of physical channels , i.e. , those constructed by using color singlet states .",
    "once this is done the four  quark wave function is expressed in terms of nonorthogonal vectors and hence the traditional way to compute probabilities needs to be generalized .",
    "we have obtained expressions to evaluate such probabilities for all possible nontrivial four  quark states containing two heavy antiquarks and two light quarks .",
    "we have applied these expressions to illustrative cases , where the difference among unbound , compact and molecular four  quark states has been made evident .",
