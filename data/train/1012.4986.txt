    ". we shall give a brief discussion below in section [ semiinfite ] .",
    "in the past few years there has been great interest in the crossover behaviors of the thermodynamic casimir force . in @xcite",
    "the authors have studied the crossover from the special surface universality class to the ordinary one by using field theoretic methods .",
    "they find that for certain choices of the parameters , the thermodynamic casimir force changes sign with a varying thickness of the film .",
    "the authors of @xcite have computed exactly the thermodynamic casimir force for stripes of the two - dimensional ising model as a function of the external surface fields @xmath1 and @xmath26 . also here the authors have found that for certain choices of the fields @xmath1 and @xmath26 , the thermodynamic casimir force does change sign as a function of the temperature or the thickness of the film .",
    "more recently , the authors of @xcite have studied the crossover from the ordinary to the normal surface universality class , and the crossover from the special to the ordinary as well as the normal surface universality class using the mean - field approximation .",
    "also in these cases a change of sign of the thermodynamic casimir force could be observed .",
    "furthermore in @xcite preliminary results @xcite of monte carlo simulations of the spin-1/2 ising model on the simple cubic lattice for the crossover from the ordinary to the normal surface universality class were presented . following",
    "the authors of @xcite these observations might be of technological relevance .",
    "they write : `` such a tunability of critical casimir forces towards repulsion might be relevant for micro- and nano - electromechanical systems in order to prevent stiction due to the omnipresent attractive quantum mechanical casimir forces @xcite . '' in recent experiments on colloidal particles immersed in a binary mixture of fluids @xcite , the authors have demonstrated that the adsorption strength can be varied continuously by a chemical modification of the surfaces .",
    "in particular the situation of effectively equal adsorption strengths for the two fluids can be reached . for sufficiently small ordering interaction at the surface",
    ", this corresponds to the ordinary surface universality class .",
    "hence these experiments open the way to study the crossover from the ordinary to the normal universality class .",

    "@xcite effectively weak adsorption can also be obtained by using patterned substrates .    in the present work we compute",
    "scaling functions for the film or plate - plate geometry . in order to compare with experiments on the thermodynamic casimir force between colloidal particles and a flat substrate as studied in ref .",
    "@xcite the scaling function for the plate - sphere geometry has to be computed .",
    "the derjaguin approximation @xcite might be used to derive scaling functions for the plate - sphere geometry from those for the plate - plate geometry if the radius of the sphere is large compared with the distance between the plate and the sphere @xcite , as it is indeed the case in ref .",

    ". we shall give the definition of this model in section [ definemodel ] below .",
    "improved means that corrections to finite size scaling that are @xmath27 vanish .",
    "this property is very useful in the study of films , since typically the surfaces cause corrections @xmath28 @xcite and fitting monte carlo data , it is quite difficult to disentangle corrections that have similar exponents .",
    "motivated by the experiments @xcite , we shall mainly study films where the external field @xmath1 at the first surface is finite , while at the other surface the limit @xmath29 is taken , corresponding to the strong adsorption limit in a binary mixture . for this choice of boundary conditions",
    "the correlation length of the film divided by its thickness remains small at any temperature .",
    "in contrast , for @xmath30 the film undergoes a second order phase transition in the universality class of the two - dimensional ising model .",
    "this implies that in the neighborhood of this transition the correlation length of the film divided by its thickness is large .",
    "therefore the monte carlo study of the crossover from @xmath30 to the limit @xmath31 would be more involved than that performed here .    in preparation for our study of the thermodynamic casimir force , we have accurately determined the surface critical exponent @xmath32 of the ordinary surface universality class .",
    "furthermore we have estimated the so called extrapolation length for various boundary conditions .",
    "the extrapolation length is directly related to the corrections to finite size scaling that are caused by the surfaces of the film .",
    "our numerical results are mainly based on the analysis of the behavior of the magnetization profile at the bulk critical temperature .",
    "next we have computed the thermodynamic casimir force for the range of inverse temperatures around the bulk critical point where , at the level of our numerical accuracy , it is non - vanishing . to this end",

    "we demonstrate that , taking into account corrections @xmath28 , already for the relatively small thicknesses @xmath33 , @xmath34 , and @xmath35 the behavior of the thermodynamic casimir force per area as well as its partial derivatives with respect to @xmath1 is well described by universal fss functions .",
    "next we have simulated films with various finite values of @xmath1 to check the range of applicability of the taylor - expansion and to study the crossover beyond this range .",

    "therefore we had put the fixed spins on @xmath84 and @xmath85 to get @xmath5 layers with fluctuating spins .",
