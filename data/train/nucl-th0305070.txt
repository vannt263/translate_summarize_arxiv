    "chiral perturbation theory ( @xmath8pt ) for mesons @xcite is the effective field theory of low - energy qcd in the vacuum sector ( baryon number zero ) , expressed in terms of the effective degrees of freedom active at low energies .",
    "these are the goldstone bosons resulting from the spontaneous symmetry breaking of the chiral group @xmath9 , reflecting the symmetry of the qcd lagrangian for @xmath10 massless quark flavors , down to its vectorial subgroup @xmath11 , denoting the symmetry of the vacuum .",
    "the effective lagrangian is organized in terms of a simultaneous expansion in powers of ( covariant ) derivatives and quark - mass terms , and a perturbative expansion of observables is expected to work for momenta sufficiently small in comparison with the scale of chiral symmetry breaking , @xmath12 .",
    "perturbative calculations in the mesonic sector are feasible due to the existence of a consistent power counting scheme @xcite establishing a connection between the chiral expansion and the loop expansion ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite for a recent overview ) .    the one - nucleon sector ( baryon number one ) turns out to be more complicated @xcite because of the presence of a new mass scale  the mass of the nucleon  which does not vanish in the chiral limit .",
    "in particular , loop diagrams containing internal nucleon lines may contribute to low orders in the chiral expansion .",
    "therefore , the relation between the chiral expansion and the loop expansion appears to be lost @xcite .",
    "this problem has been solved in the framework of heavy - baryon chiral perturbation theory ( hb@xmath8pt ) @xcite , where the power counting is restored in terms of an additional @xmath13 expansion , and perturbative calculations are again possible .",
    "however , hb@xmath8pt has its own shortcomings : the corresponding perturbation series fails to converge in part of the low - energy region @xcite .",
    "moreover , at higher orders in the chiral expansion , the expressions due to @xmath13 corrections of the lagrangian become increasingly complicated @xcite .",
    "these disadvantages are related to the nonrelativistic momentum expansion in this approach .",
    "recently , various methods have been proposed to establish a consistent power counting within a relativistic approach . in this work",
    ", we will discuss the electromagnetic form factors of the nucleon within the extended on - mass - shell ( eoms ) renormalization scheme of ref .",
    "@xcite . in this scheme renormalization",
    "is performed by expanding a given feynman diagram in terms of small quantities and subtracting those terms which violate the power counting .",
    "since the subtracted terms are regular in the small quantities , they can be absorbed in a finite number of low - energy constants of the chiral lagrangian .",
    "so far , the new method has been applied to a discussion of the mass and the scalar form factor of the nucleon at @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "the electromagnetic form factors parameterize the single - nucleon matrix element of the electromagnetic current operator and thus reflect the electromagnetic structure of the nucleon .",
    "the matrix element is usually described in terms of either the dirac and pauli form factors , @xmath1 and @xmath2 , or the electric and magnetic sachs form factors , @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "the latter are popular , because their fourier transforms in the breit frame come closest to an interpretation as the distribution of charge and magnetization inside the nucleon @xcite ( for a recent discussion and an overview of the existing relevant form factor measurements , see refs .",

    "@xcite , there is essentially no physical motivation for such a form and it is also not able to describe `` fine structure '' in the data .",
    "the electric form factor of the neutron , @xmath23 , is the least precisely known due to the lack of a free neutron target and the fact that it is small .",
    "however , recent polarization experiments have improved our empirical knowledge of @xmath23 considerably ( see ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "clearly , a quantitative description of these four form factors is a stringent test for any theory or model of the strong interactions ( see , e.g. , refs .   ) . in chiral perturbation theory ,",
    "these form factors have been calculated within the early relativistic approach @xcite , hb@xmath8pt @xcite , the small - scale expansion @xcite , and within the relativistic infrared regularization approach @xcite .",

    "<S> the electromagnetic form factors of the nucleon are calculated at order @xmath0 in the relativistic formulation of baryon chiral perturbation theory . in order to obtain a consistent power counting for the renormalized diagrams we make use of the extended on - mass - shell renormalization scheme which we have discussed in a recent paper . we analyze the dirac and pauli form factors , @xmath1 and @xmath2 , as well as the electric and magnetic sachs form factors , @xmath3 and @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> our results are compared with those obtained in the heavy - baryon approach and in the ( relativistic ) infrared regularization . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , the sachs form factors are compared with experimental data . </S>",
    "<S> we confirm previous findings that a one - loop calculation of the electromagnetic form factors does not generate sufficient curvature for the sachs form factors @xmath5 , @xmath6 , and @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the electric form factor of the neutron is very sensitive to higher - order contributions . </S>"
