    "studying of the deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) of leptons by nuclei has created a special problem , description of the dis on the off - mass - shell nucleons . by itself",
    "this problem is not something unique or new in nuclear physics , since the same problem of the off - mass - shell amplitudes arises in investigations of the reactions of any kind ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "historically , all off - mass - shell effects in the dis on the nucleons are divided into two classes .",
    "first , these are the so - called `` binding effects ''  @xcite .",
    "it was noticed that compared to the free nucleon structure function @xmath1 , the structure function of the off - mass - shell nucleon , the `` bound nucleon '' , has a shift in the kinematical variables : @xmath2 where @xmath3 , @xmath4 is the 4-momentum transfer in the reaction , m is nucleon mass , @xmath5 is the virtual nucleon momentum and @xmath6 is the bjorken scaling variable for free nucleon at rest . since @xmath7 and averaging on the nucleus results in @xmath8 , the structure function of the bound nucleon is `` shifted '' to a smaller value of @xmath9 .",
    "the exception is the region of high @xmath9 , @xmath10 , where due to the admixture of the @xmath11 , the `` fermi motion '' , the bound nucleon structure function is extended beyond the single nucleon kinematics . when only such kinematical effects are taken into account the bound nucleon contribution to the nuclear structure function is given as a convolution of the free nucleon structure function with an effective distribution function for the nucleons  @xcite .",
    "taking account of the binding effects in this distribution function leads to a description of the emc - effect in the dis  @xcite .",
    "second , the off - mass - shell effects are all possible phenomena , other than the binding effects , which make the off - mass - shell structure function different from the on - mass - shell one . such effects are related to the fact that the nucleon has an internal structure and the structure of the off - mass - shell nucleon requires a different description than just a kinematical shift in @xmath12 .",
    "a systematic study of these off - mass - shell effects started recently  @xcite , though some effects which do not reduce to the binding effects were discussed earlier  @xcite . following the tradition of these papers  @xcite we call , through out this paper , the effects of the second kind as `` off - shell '' effects , distinguishing them from the binding effects .    in ref .",
    "@xcite the general form of the truncated nucleon tensor ( see fig .  1(a ) ) is studied .",
    "the structure functions of physical states are then presented as feynman diagrams with insertion of the truncated nucleon tensor . for the transverse unpolarized structure functions the form of the insertion",
    "is found to be : @xmath13 where @xmath14 are three different scalar functions , while for the scattering on the point - like fermion",
    "only the term @xmath15 exists  @xcite . calculation of the nuclear structure functions , keeping only the @xmath15 term leads to the existence only of the binding effects and the convolution formula  @xcite , which is a reasonable approximation , since the entire non - relativistic nuclear physics works with point - like nucleons .",
    "non - uniform deformation of each of the three terms in eq .",
    "( [ tens ] ) off the mass - shell and the non - trivial spin structure of @xmath16 lead to new effects in the processes involving the off - mass - shell nucleons .",
    "= n y    figure 1 . _ the truncated nucleon tensor in the pion - nucleon model .",
    "graph for the dressed nucleon tensor ( a ) is the sum of graphs ( b)-(c ) , where virtual photon scatters on the bare nucleons and mesons .",
    "_    the investigations of refs .",
    "@xcite are based on models for the nucleon structure , motivated by the constituent quark model , and they involve unknown quark - nucleon amplitudes which are parametrized to fit the nucleon structure function on the mass - shell .",
    "the off - shell effects are found to be only a few percent in the absolute value of the structure function of nuclei .",
    "apparently the magnitude and behavior of these corrections are dependent on the form of the parametrizations of the quark - nucleon vertices with parameters being fixed to describe the observables ( structure functions ) for the nucleon on the mass shell . whereas the continuation to off - mass - shell region must be ruled by dynamics ( the equations of motion for participating fields ) and fixed by some constraints , such as the ward - takahashi relations , etc , so as to provide consistency of the model with the calculation of any other observables . on the other hand ,",
    "the smallness of the corresponding corrections makes it difficult to test models experimentally in the usual deep inelastic experiments on nuclei .",
    "the circumstances mentioned above motivate us to continue investigations of the off - shell effects in the nucleon structure function .",
    "in particular , we aim ( i ) to consider the dynamical model for the nucleon structure function other than the quark models of refs .",
    "@xcite , so as to compare results of independent approaches to the problem and ( ii ) to discuss possible experiments , other than inclusive dis , which can open new perspectives to study off - shell effects .    in the present paper",
    "we consider the pion - nucleon model for the structure function of the nucleon , which is motivated by the well - known sullivan model  @xcite .",
    "we argue that the model is relevant for the case and discuss model ambiguities involved in the calculations .",
    "then we calculate off - shell effects in the inclusive and semi - inclusive dis on the deuteron .",
    "the second reaction provides new opportunities for an experimental investigation of the off - shell effects in the nucleon structure function .",
    "the role of the pion cloud or , more generally , mesonic cloud in the formation of the peripheral structure of the nucleon structure function has been discussed widely  @xcite .",
    "we will discuss only the pion cloud , since its contribution significantly dominates over the contributions of the heavier mesons .",
    "the conventional analysis is based on corrections to the scattering on the nucleon , calculated in the lowest order on the pion - nucleon coupling constant , @xmath17 , ( see fig .",
    "1(b)-(d ) ) with pseudoscalar coupling : @xmath18 then the diagrams ( c ) and ( d ) in the pion - nucleon model are logarithmically divergent .",
    "the formal logic of the field theory requires renormalization by introducing structure functions of the `` bare '' nucleons and mesons and some counter - terms in such a way as to provide the correct value of the calculated structure functions where the a natural normalization point for the counter - terms is the nucleon mass shell .",
    "this is enough if we are going to consider off - mass - shell behavior of the nucleon structure function .",
    "however , this is not sufficient if we are intending to reach conclusions about contributions of the mesons to the structure function of the free nucleon .",
    "the physically motivated sullivan model gives the possibility to estimate the contribution of the pion cloud to the free nucleon structure function . in the modern form",
    "@xcite the model is based on the graphs ( b)-(d ) in fig .  1 and ingredients of the model include elementary structure functions of bare nucleons and mesons and the meson - nucleon vertex formfactors in the diagrams ( c ) and ( d ) .",
    "the vertex formfactors cut the `` unphysical '' high momenta of the pions and make the contribution of the diagrams ( c ) and ( d ) finite . physical picture corresponding to the dis on the nucleon in the sullivan model",
    "is the following .",
    "the nucleon is presented as a superposition of two states , the bare nucleon state and the nucleon plus one pion state . as a result , the physical nucleon is the point - like bare nucleon ( `` the nucleon core '' ) surrounded by the extended pion cloud .",
    "the quark - gluon degrees of freedom in this picture are `` hidden '' in the effective hadron degrees of freedom and their presence is displayed through the elementary structure functions of the bare nucleons and mesons .",
    "this model is relevant to a study of the nuclear effects in the nucleon structure function , since the nn - potential can be succesfully defined in the same @xmath19-approximation , the one - boson - exchange potential , as the dressing diagrams on fig .  1 .",
    "at the same time the off - mass - shell behavior of the structure functions is governed by the meson - nucleon dynamics and , therefore , is consistent with dynamics of the deuteron , which we assume to describe also in the meson - nucleon model  @xcite .    the vertex formfactor plays the crucial role in the sullivan model of the nucleon structure function  @xcite . since without formfactors the one - loop diagrams ( c ) and ( d ) are divergent",
    ", the cut - off parameters control the magnitude of the contribution of these diagrams to the nucleon structure function .",
    "on the other hand , for our purpose , to analyse the off - shell behavior of the nucleon structure function , we can work without formfactors , attributing all divergences to the renormalization of the structure functions of the bare nucleons and mesons .",
    "however , intending to make connection with other calculations , we perform all numerical estimates within the sullivan model with formfactors . the form of vertex formfactor can be chosen as  @xcite : @xmath20 where @xmath5 and @xmath21 are incoming and outgoing nucleon momenta in the vertex , respectively , @xmath22 is the pion momentum .",
    "the formfactors are normalized so that : @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the pion mass .",
    "so for the on - mass - shell nucleon structure function the diagram ( c ) is regularized by single formfactor @xmath25 and diagram ( d ) by @xmath26 .",
    "we accept the point - like behavior of the bare nucleons , while the extended structure is generated by the pion cloud , dressing diagrams ( c ) and ( d ) .",
    "calculation of the diagrams ( b)-(d ) gives ( we consider the structure function @xmath27 ) : @xmath28 where @xmath29 , etc , @xmath30 is the bare nucleon ( pion ) structure function .",
    "the term @xmath31 arises from the diagram ( b ) , @xmath32 from ( c ) and @xmath33 from ( d ) ( @xmath34 ) .",
    "the explicit form of the functions @xmath35 is presented in the appendix a. if neglect the formfactors , these functions satisfy the condition @xmath36 which heuristically can be obtained as a consequence of the probabilistic interpretation of the structure function  @xcite .",
    "however , inclusion of the formfactors ( different for the diagrams ( c ) and ( d ) ! ) breaks the relation ( [ sr ] ) , which leads to a violation of the charge and/or momentum conservation in the process  @xcite .",
    "the underlying reason is that in the covariant calculations it is impossible to introduce `` symmetric '' formfactor with respect to the nucleon and meson momenta .    other topic is the choice of the cut - off parameters in the formfactors .",
    "it is known  @xcite that to have a reasonable physical interpretation of the calculated structure functions cut - off masses in the formfactor ( [ ff ] ) should be significantly smaller than it is found from an analysis of the meson - exchange potentials  @xcite . to regulate the divergent diagram ( c )",
    ", the formfactor is chosen  @xcite : @xmath37 which corresponds to the formfactor for diagram ( d ) : @xmath38 where parameter @xmath39 is fixed to preserve the baryon charge ( not the momentum ! ) conservation .",
    "on the other hand , there is no reason to put a smaller cut - off mass in the formfactor corresponding to the external nucleon line for the diagram ( c - d ) , where cut - off mass should be @xmath40 gev  @xcite .",
    "we have to stress once again that for the analysis of the off - mass - shell effects in the nucleon structure functions we do not necessarily need the regulating formfactors in the divergent diagrams .",
    "we are introducing these formfactor only to relate to the well - known and widely discussed sullivan model for the nucleon structure function .",
    "the dependence of our results on the choice of the cut - off mass , @xmath41 , in the loops in diagrams ( c ) and ( d ) is weak compared to the @xmath41-dependence of the pion ( nucleon ) contribution to the free nucleon structure function .",
    "moreover , to restore symmetry between nucleon and pion contributions into eq .",
    "( [ sf])-([sfm ] ) we use eq .",
    "( [ sr ] ) to define the nucleon contribution through the pion one .",
    "this way to proceed is supported by analysis  @xcite using the time - ordered perturbation theory , where it is shown that eq .",
    "( [ sr ] ) is valid and introducing the formfactors in the covariant calculations damages significantly only the nucleon contribution .",
    "the free nucleon structure function is defined by inserting operator eq .",
    "( [ sf ] ) between dirac spinors .",
    "the final expression coincides with the the result of the sullivan model  @xcite : @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the normalization factor defined by the conservation of baryon number : @xmath44 a direct calculation shows that ( [ freenb ] ) actually preserves the baryon number in the one - loop approximation , with or without ( @xmath45 ) formfactors . as a basic set of parameters for the calculations we take the formfactor ( [ mff ] )  @xcite . in this case @xmath46 .",
    "therefore , for bare structure functions of the nucleons and mesons we take a fit of the empirical structure functions of the free nucleons and pions .",
    "this gives a reasonable agreement of the calculated structure function ( [ freen ] ) with the experimental data , since admixtures of the corrections ( c ) and ( d ) are not too large .",
    "now we are in a position to calculate the nucleon contribution to the deuteron structure function .",
    "we start with a consideration of the inclusive dis on the deuteron ( fig .",
    "the structure function for the deuteron , @xmath47 , is defined as a matrix element of the operator eq .",
    "( [ sf ] ) .",
    "a consistent way is to use the covariant amplitude for the deuteron , the bethe - salpeter amplitude  @xcite or relativistic wave functions  @xcite , with the normalization of the amplitude , based on the deuteron charge , in the one - loop approximation .",
    "this will be done elsewhere . here to test the method we utilize the usual non - relativistic wave function of the deuteron .",
    "the non - relativistic reduction of the covariant operator ( [ sf ] ) is similar to earlier approaches  @xcite .",
    "here we reduce only the @xmath48 , dirac structure of the operator ( [ sf ] ) to the @xmath49 , pauli operators , keeping all kinematics in the relativistic form .",
    "the deuteron structure function then is defined by : @xmath50 where @xmath51 is renormalization constant preserving the conservation of the baryon number in the deuteron , @xmath52 is the deuteron mass , @xmath53 is the off - mass - shell energy of the nucleon , @xmath54 and @xmath55    the brackets @xmath56 denotes the non - relativistic expression for the subsequent operators : @xmath57    it is anticipated that the off - shell effects are small in the deuteron .",
    "this is a consequence of the fact that , on the average , the shift from the mass shell for the nucleon in the deuteron is small : @xmath58 . in heavier nuclei",
    "this shift is apparently larger , up to @xmath59 for nucleus like iron , which can lead to a more significant effect .",
    "however , it is interesting to find other possibilities to investigate the off - shell behavior of the nucleon structure functions .",

    "thus semi - inclusive dis provides a unique possibility to study the off - shell behavior of the nucleon structure function .",
    "in particular , the off - shell effects can be studied as a function of the shift from the mass shell ( or spectator momentum ) .    in the non - relativistic approach , with disregard of the off - shell effects",
    ", the structure function of the off - shell neutron , @xmath64 , measured with the detection of the proton - spectator has the form : @xmath65 where @xmath66 , @xmath67 , @xmath68 . dividing data by the flux - factor , @xmath69 , which is known from kinematics , and plotting @xmath64 as a function of @xmath70 ( @xmath71 )",
    "we should have a result proportional to the free neutron structure function , @xmath72 , with coefficient @xmath73 , i.e. at any fixed @xmath74 the ratio of the measured structure function to the free neutron structure function should be constant .",
    "this conclusion has to be changed if there is a non - trivial @xmath75-dependence of the nucleon structure function , i.e. if the off - shell effects exist .",
