    "the study of prey - predator systems has attracted a lot of attention since the pioneering works of lotka @xcite and volterra @xcite .",
    "working at a mean - field level ( homogeneous populations ) they showed that , depending on the initial state , the system can evolve toward a simple steady - state or a limit cycle , in which the populations oscillate periodically in time .    an important question is the understanding of the role played by the local environment on the dynamics ( spatial effects ) @xcite and , accordingly , many extended prey - predator models have been studied during the past years @xcite .",
    "recently , a simple prey - predator model was introduced by some of us @xcite .",
    "although governed by only two control parameters , this model exhibits a rich phase diagram . as a function of the two control parameters @xmath1 and @xmath2 , which are the growth rates of prey and predator respectively ,",
    "two different phases are observed : a pure prey phase ( p ) , and a coexistence phase of prey and predator in which an oscillatory ( o ) region and a non - oscillatory ( no ) region can be distinguished . for a system size @xmath3",
    ", these three different domains meet at a particular point , called @xmath4 ( precise definitions are given below ) .",
    "it was shown @xcite that @xmath5 and @xmath6 . for @xmath7 , a phase transition line between the pure prey phase and the coexistence phase",
    "is present , and the critical exponents along this line are the ones of directed percolation ( dp ) @xcite .",
    "however , it was also observed that when the growth rate of prey @xmath8 and @xmath9 , the model undergoes a non - dp continuous phase transition .",
    "since the directed percolation is a generic universality class for models with absorbing states ( unless some special conditions are satisfied  @xcite ) , existence of such a transition is certainly surprising .",
    "these two lines of different continuous non - equilibrium phase transition meet at the bicritical point @xmath0 @xcite , and one forecast that the critical behavior at this particular point may also belong to a new universality class .",
    "the goal of this paper is to study in more details the properties of these non - dp phase transitions .",
    "first , we perform extensive steady - state simulations , which confirm the non - dp character of the transition in the limit @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "as it was already shown  @xcite , in this limit the model exhibits oscillatory behavior .",
    "but , in addition to that , for @xmath12 the model has infinitely many absorbing states .",
    "these two properties are responsible for a rather peculiar behavior of the model , which becomes particularly transparent when the model is examined using the dynamical monte carlo method .",
    "when applied to models with infinitely many absorbing states , this dynamical method uses the so - called natural absorbing states , which are the most likely states to be reached by the dynamical evolution of the system .",
    "we show , however , that this common but somehow heuristic procedure fails here .",
    "indeed , for the present model , natural absorbing states contain only short - ranged islands of prey on which spreading is not critical .",
    "to restore criticality of spreading we generated the absorbing states using a quasi - static approach to the critical point .",
    "this example shows that for some models with infinitely many absorbing states a special approach is needed to examine the dynamical properties of the critical point .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : model ] , the model is defined and some of its properties discussed . a thorough investigation of the critical behavior has been made using two different complementary approaches . in sec .  [",
    "sec : steady ] , the critical behavior is investigated using steady state properties while in sec  [ sec : dynamic ] one uses dynamical monte carlo method .",
    "it is shown that for @xmath10 and @xmath11 the steady - state exponents are indeed mean - field - like , while the dynamical exponents are non - universal depending continously upon @xmath2 .",
    "nevertheless , trace of the mean - field character of the transition shows up in scaling relation among dynamical exponents .",
    "the critical behavior at point @xmath0 is also investigated , and it turns out that the corresponding exponents belong to a new universality class . finally , physical arguments explaining the above findings are given in sec .",
    "[ sec : conc ] .",
    "the model used in ref .",
    "@xcite is defined as follows .",
    "each cell of a two - dimensional square lattice ( of size @xmath13 , with periodic boundary condition ) , labeled by the index @xmath14 , can be at time @xmath15 , in one of the three following states : @xmath16 , 1 , and 2 .",
    "a cell in state 0 , 1 , or 2 corresponds , respectively , to a cell which is empty , occupied by prey , or simultaneously occupied by prey and predators .",
    "the transition rates for site @xmath14 are ( i ) @xmath17 at rate @xmath18 , ( ii)@xmath19 at rate @xmath20 , and ( iii ) @xmath21 at rate 1 , where @xmath22 denotes the number of nearest neighbor sites of @xmath14 which are in the state @xmath23 .",
    "the first two processes model the spreading of prey and predators .",
    "the third process represents the local depopulation of a cell due to overly greedy predators .",
    "the rate of the third process is chosen to be 1 , which sets the time scale , hence @xmath15 , as well as @xmath1 and @xmath2 are dimensionless quantities .",
    "the properties of this model have been investigated both by mean - field and monte - carlo methods @xcite .",
    "the monte - carlo result extrapolated to the case @xmath3 is summarized in fig .",
    "[ fig : phase_diag ] .",
    "the transition line between the prey phase and the coexistence phase , @xmath24 , belongs to the directed percolation universality class @xcite , as expected , and terminates at the point @xmath25 , where the p , o , and no domains meet . for @xmath9 , the transition between the oscillatory domain of the coexistence phase and the prey phase takes place at @xmath12 . along this transition line",
    "the predator density approaches zero as a power law @xmath26 , with @xmath27 , and so , does not belong to the dp class , which is somehow unexpected .",
    "the value @xmath27 lead to the conjecture @xcite that this second transition could be mean - field - like .",
    "there is a crossover between the o and no parts of the coexistence phase .",
    "the purpose of the present study is to give a complete description of the nature of the transitions near the line @xmath12 for @xmath28 .",
    "it is worth to mention , that our model is closely related to a model introduced by drossel _",
    "et al .  _",
    "@xcite to investigate the effect of immunization in an extension of the simple forest - fire model @xcite .",
    "this three - state model ( 0 : empty site , 1 : tree , and 2 : burning tree ) differs from our model in some details : the growth rate of a tree ( @xmath29 ) is @xmath30 , independently of the environment , and a tree is ignited ( @xmath31 ) with rate @xmath32 , ( @xmath33 is the usual heaviside - function ) .",
    "this second process models the immunization of trees against fire .",
    "the third process ( @xmath34 ) happens at rate 1 .",
    "for non zero immunity and @xmath35 albano @xcite showed that the transition toward a single absorbing state is dp like , while for @xmath36 ( at the end point of the dp transition line ) , the transition belongs to the dynamical percolation universality class , and the absorbing state is not unique .",
    "extensive monte - carlo simulations for system sizes up to @xmath37 have been performed to investigate the behavior of the predator density @xmath38 , for @xmath8 and three different values of @xmath2 , namely , @xmath39 , 5.0 , and 6.0 , following trajectories of type 2 and 4 in fig .",
    "[ fig : phase_diag ] .",
    "the value @xmath40 corresponds to the best determination of the end point t , obtained by the dynamical approach described below .",
    "owing to the oscillatory behavior near the critical line ( @xmath41 ) , the system very easily evolves into an absorbing state , where the predators are extinct , therefore careful initialization is needed in the simulations .",
    "usually @xmath42 mcs `` thermalization '' were applied following @xmath42 mcs `` approaching '' time where @xmath1 was decreased continuously .",
    "the densities and the fluctuations of prey and predators were averaged over @xmath43 mcs for each @xmath1 , @xmath2 points . it is found that @xmath26 for @xmath8 . in order to see corrections to scaling , we compute the effective exponent @xmath44 where @xmath45 and @xmath46 are two consecutive values of the control parameter @xmath1 .    as the fig .",
    "[ fig : expo_beta ] shows , for @xmath47 and 6 , the linear extrapolation of @xmath48 converges to @xmath49 within statistical errors @xmath50 for @xmath39 ( trajectory of type 2 in fig .",
    "[ fig : phase_diag ] ) it goes to a somewhat higher value , and one finds @xmath51 the measurement of the fluctuations @xmath52 are less precise and we estimate @xmath53 at @xmath39 , and @xmath54 for @xmath47 , 6 .    for @xmath9",
    "these values are consistent with the previous prediction @xcite @xmath27 . however , at the bicritical point @xmath0 the value of @xmath55 is completely different and thus belongs to a new universality class .",
    "a very useful technique to study the critical properties of a system with absorbing states is the so - called dynamical monte carlo method @xcite . in this approach ,",
    "the system is prepared in an initial state , which is one of the absorbing states up to one site , which is set to be in the active state .",
    "one considers an ensemble of trials starting from the same initial state .",
    "certain dynamical quantities exhibit a power law behavior when the system is critical .",
    "for example , the survival probability behaves as @xmath56 the deviation from this power law behavior , when the system is off - critical , provides a very precise way to locate the critical point .",
    "the number of active sites @xmath57 behaves as @xmath58 while , for the mean square spreading from the origin @xmath59    @xmath60    where the dynamical exponent @xmath61 is the ratio of the critical exponents of spatial ( @xmath62 ) and temporal ( @xmath63 ) correlation lengths .",
    "some scaling relations between these exponents can be also derived  @xcite .",
    "we made various simulations using the dynamical monte carlo method and our results are summarized below .",
    "first , we simulated the model on the @xmath12 line , taking , as an absorbing state , a lattice filled with prey ( trajectory of type 3 in fig .",
    "[ fig : phase_diag ] ) . measuring the survival probability @xmath64",
    ", we found that @xmath65 is the critical point , which separates the absorbing phase ( @xmath66 ) and the phase with annular growth ( @xmath67 ) .",
    "measuring the slope at @xmath68 ( see fig .",
    "[ dyna0 ] ) we estimate @xmath69 , which is very close to the value obtained for dynamical percolation , for which , in two dimensions , @xmath70 @xcite . moreover ,",
    "using ( 7 ) and ( 8) we obtained @xmath71 and @xmath72 , which are also very close to the dynamical percolation values .",
    "note that the usual @xmath73 exponent for dynamical percolation , which takes the value @xmath74 , is defined through @xmath75 , which differs from our definition of @xmath55 in sec .",
    "[ sec : steady ] .",
    "thus it is not surprising that these two exponents differ .",
    "note also that the dynamical estimation of the critical endpoint @xmath68 has been used in the static approach of sec .",
    "[ sec : steady ] .",
    "the same scheme was used for @xmath76 .",
    "the critical point was located for @xmath77 and 1 ( trajectory of type 1 in fig .",
    "[ fig : phase_diag ] ) , and they agree with the steady state results of ref .",
    "@xcite . measuring the slope at criticality",
    "( see fig .",
    "[ dync ] ) we estimate @xmath78 , i.e. , the value compatible with dp @xcite .",
    "the fact , that for @xmath76 the phase transition belongs to the dp universality class , was already confirmed using the static calculations @xcite .    in sec .",
    "[ sec : model ] we already noticed the similarity of the present model with a forest - fire model with immunization .",
    "results presented in this section provide farther arguments supporting such an analogy .",
    "indeed , dynamical exponents measured by albano for the forest fire model are also close to the dynamical percolation ( without growth of tree ) and the directed percolation ( with growth of tree ) @xcite .",
    "static simulations suggest that the model becomes critical on the line @xmath67 and @xmath12",
    ". moreover , let us notice that for @xmath12 there are infinitely many absorbing states : indeed , any configuration without predators is an absorbing state .",
    "it is well known that dynamical monte carlo method can be applied also to models with infinitely many absorbing states . however , as we will see below , applicability of this method to the criticality on this line requires serious reconsiderations .",
    "first , let us recall that the dynamical monte carlo method for models with infinitely many absorbing states usually uses the so - called natural absorbing states , i.e. states which are reached by the model s dynamics .",
    "numerical evidence suggests that for such states the dynamical critical point coincides with the static one .",
    "moreover , dynamical exponents @xmath79 and @xmath80 , measured on such states , take universal values .    following this prescription",
    ", we generated natural absorbing states for @xmath12 and @xmath67 , and then used such states to perform dynamical simulations .",
    "an initial configuration was chosen randomly , with equal probabilities of a site being empty , occupied by prey , or simultaneously by prey and predator .",
    "fixing @xmath81 and @xmath2 , we then allowed the system to evolve until an absorbing configuration was reached ( i.e. all predators die out ) .",
    "our results , presented in fig",
    ".  [ cool ] , show , however , that the spreading of activity is not critical ( i.e. power - law ) , but rather exponential .",
    "but we can argue that this is not surprising .",
    "indeed , a random initial configuration ( with probability of prey equal 1/3 ) is below the percolation threshold with respect to the clusters of prey , and contains only finite clusters of them  @xcite . on such clusters activity",
    "has certainly finite duration ( for @xmath12 prey do not grow ) and the exponential decay of @xmath64 , as it can be seen in fig .",
    "[ cool ] , is an expected feature .",
    "clearly , the lack of criticality in @xmath64 is due to the finiteness of prey clusters in the natural absorbing states . in principle",
    ", we can cure this effect starting from random initial configurations but containing larger fraction of prey .",
    "for sufficiently large concentrations the system will be above the percolation threshold and activity will be able to spread infinitely .",
    "probably , for a certain concentration of prey we can tune the system to have power - law decay for @xmath64 .",
    "such a procedure , however , is somehow artificial , and criticality of spreading will not be related with the static criticality of the system .    the question arises here , whether it is possible to generate absorbing states on which spreading would be critical , and where this criticality would be generated `` more naturally '' ?",
    "hopefully , criticality of spreading on absorbing states obtained during such a procedure should be related with the steady - state criticality of the model . in the following",
    "we suggest a procedure which imitate the quasi - static approach to the critical point on the line @xmath12 . in our approach",
    "we gradually reduce @xmath1 according to the formula : @xmath82 where @xmath83 and @xmath84 is the cooling rate .",
    "[ we expect that the detailed time dependence in eq .",
    "( [ cooling ] ) is not relevant as long as it is a slow process ] .",
    "we terminate the cooling when an absorbing state is reached .",
    "when the cooling is slow , the system have enough time to build large clusters of prey .",
    "our simulations for @xmath85 suggest ( see fig .",
    "[ cool ] ) that in the limit @xmath86 , such absorbing states are critical , with @xmath87 ( along trajectories of type 5 in fig .",
    "[ fig : phase_diag ] ) .",
    "measuring the number of active sites @xmath57 , and using eq .",
    "( [ expeta ] ) we estimate @xmath88 ( see fig .",
    "[ cool1 ] ) .",
    "the departure of the curves from a straight line observed for large values of time is related to the finiteness of the cooling rate .",
    "moreover , we measured the averaged squared distance @xmath59 , and using eq .",
    "( [ expz ] ) we obtain @xmath89 ( see fig .",
    "[ cool2 ] ) .",
    "actually , we expect that the correct value of this exponent is @xmath90 . indeed , in eq .",
    "( [ expz ] ) one makes the average only over surviving runs , thus the long - time contributions to @xmath59 come from the rare events , when the activity happened to be placed on a large island of prey .",
    "since @xmath67 , the activity on such islands spreads in a deterministic way ( annular growth ) , which leads to @xmath90 .    the same procedure for @xmath91 yields : @xmath92 , @xmath93 and @xmath89 .",
    "( relatively large errors of estimations of critical exponents are due to several , and difficult to estimate factors , as finite time @xmath15 , finite cooling rate @xmath84 , and statistical fluctuations . )",
    "such results confirm that @xmath90 , and suggest that exponents @xmath79 and @xmath80 might change continuously with @xmath2 .",
    "non - universality of these exponents is a well - known property for some other models belonging to the directed percolation universality class @xcite .",
    "note , however , that the situation is different in our case , because the non - universality is related to the value of @xmath2 , rather than to the choice of the initial state .",
    "such control parameter dependence has already been observed in other models @xcite .",
    "note that non - universal behavior is not present along the dp line since the corresponding absorbing state is unique .",
    "let us finally note that @xmath94 seems to be close to unity , which is an exact mean - field result ( @xmath95 ) .",
    "this is the only dynamical trace of the mean - field nature of the transition observed in the steady state .",
    "let us emphasize , however , that the criticality of spreading appears only if we prepare the absorbing states using the method which mimics the quasi - steady - state evolution of the model .",
    "the detailed investigation of the critical properties of a simple prey - predator model introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite showed the presence of three different types of non - equilibrium phase transitions between active and absorbing states .",
    "first , the existence of a usual dp - like transition line was confirmed at @xmath24 for @xmath76 .",
    "second , a mean - field - like transition was observed for @xmath8 , @xmath9 . the mean - field character of this transition can be explained in terms of oscillations present in the model .",
    "indeed , as described in ref .",
    "@xcite , when @xmath8 , the system is subject to large density oscillations .",
    "these oscillations are generating an important local mixing of the possible states , leading to a mean - field - like behavior .",
    "the criticality along the @xmath12 line was confirmed with the dynamical approach using specially prepared inhomogeneous initial states . some dynamical trace of the mean - field nature of this transition was also observed .",
    "third , at the bicritical point @xmath0 , where the two different critical lines meet , we found a dynamical percolation type transition moving along the @xmath12 line , while approaching the @xmath0 point from finite @xmath1 s we observed a new type of critical behavior .",
    "the measured exponents corresponding to the @xmath12 line are summarized in table [ tab : exps ] .",
