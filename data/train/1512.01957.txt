    "quantum chromodynamics  ( qcd ) is now generally believed to be the basic theory of strong interactions . due to asymptotic freedom",
    ", it can describe the strongly interacting particles at high energy where perturbative expansions are valid . in the low energy region , however , qcd becomes strongly coupled and highly nonlinear , and has thus far precluded any analytic solutions .",
    "how to study the low energy dynamics of qcd is still a difficult problem in physics .",
    "the anti - de sitter / conformal field theory  ( ads / cft ) correspondence , first proposed by maldacena  @xcite in 1998 , is originally intended to study the strong coupling region of a particular conformal gauge theory ",
    "the @xmath2 supersymmetric yang - mills  ( sym ) theory , by means of its duality to a weakly coupled string theory in ads@xmath3s@xmath4 , and has later on been extended to many other gauge theories  ( for a review , see ref .",
    "although at first sight , qcd differs a lot from @xmath2 sym , arguments have been given  @xcite that in the small momentum transfer region , where the effective qcd coupling is approximately constant , qcd resembles a conformal gauge theory , and can thus be studied using a gauge / gravity type model . in this approach",
    ", one introduces an infrared  ( ir ) cut - off in the fifth dimension of the ads space to model qcd confinement , and then introduces some five - dimensional  ( 5d ) fields corresponding to boundary four - dimensional  ( 4d ) operators .",
    "the correlation functions of boundary operators can be obtained by functionally differentiating the on - shell 5d action ( following the ads / cft prescription ) , and all the physical quantities are calculated from the correlation functions through the lehmann - symanzik - zimmermann  ( lsz ) formalism .",
    "this approach is currently referred to as `` bottom - up '' ads / qcd correspondence .",
    "although it has not been strictly proved yet , it has turned out to be phenomenologically successful in obtaining hadronic bound state properties , such as meson spectrum  @xcite and form factors  @xcite .",
    "the ads / cft correspondence can also be modified to study finite - temperature field theories  @xcite . in this approach , one introduces a schwartzchild blackhole in the ads@xmath4 background and it turns out that the resulting 5d gravity theory corresponds to a boundary field theory at temperature @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the mass of the blackhole .",
    "this idea was later applied to ads / qcd to study the temperature effects on meson spectrum  @xcite , heavy quark potentials  @xcite , and the confinement - plasma phase transition  @xcite .",
    "while the holographic model of the meson sector has received phenomenological success , the extension to the nucleon sector raises a problem . imitating the meson sector",
    ", we can similarly introduce the 5d lagrangian and then solve the eigenvalue problem to obtain nucleon spectrum  @xcite , but it turns out that the value of the ir cut - off @xmath7 needs to be 1.53 times the value used in meson sector .",
    "we can just use a different @xmath7 for the nucleon sector and set mesons aside since there is no reason why mesons and nucleons must have the same confinement scale , but the consequence is that the definition of the covariant derivative on fermion fields becomes problematic , making it difficult to study the meson - nucleon coupling constant @xmath8 .",
    "there is an attempt to deal with this problem using the same parameter @xmath7  @xcite , with numerical error 10%20% in the spectrum and @xmath9 in coupling constant @xmath8 . in this paper",
    "we make two different attempts to this issue .",
    "the first one is to use different @xmath7 for the two sectors but redefine the interaction lagrangian in a self - consistent way so that the coupling @xmath8 is uniquely determined .",
    "the numerical result of both the spectrum and coupling constants are in reasonable agreement with experiment .",
    "the second one is to use the same @xmath7 but slightly modify the ads / qcd prescription , introducing a `` magnification factor '' @xmath1 for the nucleon sector to indicate a different confinement scale .",
    "the numerical results prove to be the same , so we put the latter one in the appendix .",
    "the problem addressed in the previous paragraph also presents in the spin-3/2  ( @xmath0-baryon ) sector .",
    "a previous work  @xcite has established the necessary formalism of studying spin-@xmath10 baryons in ads / qcd , with the error of the calculated spectrum being 13% to 27% . in this paper",
    "we use the same technique mentioned in the previous paragraph with the same @xmath1 parameter to get a better fit with experimental data .",
    "the calculated spectrum fits well , and the coupling constant @xmath11 is consistent with experimental data and the prediction of other theoretical approaches .    the previous work involving @xmath0 baryons focused on the zero temperature case .",
    "however , it is increasingly important nowadays to study @xmath0 baryons at finite temperature . we know",
    "that @xmath0 baryons carry spin @xmath10 and isospin @xmath10 , they often arise as intermediate resonance states of nucleon - pion scattering . thus",
    "a knowledge of their finite - temperature properties would be important for studying thermal nucleon - pion reactions that occur in nuclear environments , such as in relativistic heavy ion collider  ( rhic ) experiments  @xcite .",
    "therefore , another aim of this paper is to study the spectrum and effective couplings of @xmath0 baryons at finite temperature , by modifying the ads space - time to ads - schwartzchild space - time . to be concise",
    ", we use the finite temperature formalism from the very begining , all zero temperature formulae can be obtained by setting @xmath12 . solving the equations numerically",
    ", we get the temperature dependence of the mass spectrum and the couplings .",
    "the temperature dependence of the mass spectrum shows a novel feature of the @xmath0 sector compared with those of nucleons and mesons .",
    "our paper is organized as follows . in sect .",
    "[ sec : description ] , we describe our unified ads / qcd model for mesons , nucleons and @xmath0 baryons at finite temperature , paying special attention to the baryon sector , and give a universal fitting of all the observables of the three sectors . in sect .",
    "[ sec : finite ] , we go to the nonzero temperature region and study the temperature dependence of the spectrum and couplings . finally , in sect .",
    "[ sec : summary ] , we briefly summarize our results .",
    "we use the following space - time metric for 5d ads - schwarzchild  ( ads - sch ) background : @xmath13 where @xmath14 .",
    "the hawking temperature of the black hole @xmath15 is equal to the temperature of the corresponding 4d boundary field theory .",
    "the cut - off at @xmath16 ( with @xmath17 implied ) corresponds to uv cut - off in qcd , while the hard - wall cut - off at @xmath18 corresponds to ir cut - off , @xmath19 , to simulate confinement . according to ref .",
    "@xcite , the ads - sch background is stable only at temperatures above the deconfinement temperature @xmath20 , and becomes metastable when @xmath21 drops below @xmath22 .",
    "however , as illustrated in ref .",
    "@xcite , when the strong interacting plasma formed in heavy ion collisions at a high temperature quickly cools down , it stays in the supercooled  ( metastable ) phase corresponding to ads - sch background .",
    "so in this sense it is more practical to study hadron behaviour in ads - sch background  ( [ metric ] ) .",
    "( the thermal ads background ) , the hadron properties  ( masses , decay constants ) do not change when temperature varies . ] in this paper we consider the metric  ( [ metric ] ) for temperatures @xmath23 .",
    "when @xmath24 , although the ads - sch phase becomes stable , our method of solving eigenvalue problems may not work well , and in this case it is more practical to analyse the baryon spectral functions , which is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "since qcd has a su(2)@xmath25su(2)@xmath26 chiral symmetry , we should introduce two 5d gauge fields @xmath27 and @xmath28 corresponding to the noether currents of 4d global chiral symmetry @xmath29 .",
