    "none of the @xmath137 isolated galaxies at @xmath182 in our survey are found to have ovi absorption in the cos quasar spectrum . in contrast , three out of ten galaxies with nearby neighbors probed at @xmath182 are found to exhibit ovi absorption with @xmath183 . on the other hand , no evidence for differential hi absorption is found between the isolated and non - isolated galaxy samples .",
    "these findings suggest that galaxy interactions play a key role in distributing heavy elements to large distances from galaxy centers , well beyond the enriched gaseous halos that surround individual galaxies .",
    "galaxy interactions can produce heavy elements at large projected distances through tidal stripping during satellite accretion ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) or ram - pressure stripping ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "recently , _ hst _",
    "images of galaxy clusters have revealed that ram pressure stripping can remove and compress copious amounts of gas from in - falling galaxies as evidenced by vigorous starbursts in debris trails @xcite .",
    "moreover , a galaxy survey in the field of an ultra - strong mgii absorption system near a luminous red galaxy revealed a group of evolved galaxies with no evidence of recent star - formation activity @xcite .",
    "the lack of star - formation in the group and kinematics of the mgii absorption are most readily explained if the mgii absorber arises from stripped gas .",
    "finally , in @xcite we presented the discovery of a `` transparent '' sightline with no strong hi , mgii or ovi absorption at @xmath184 kpc from a pair of strongly interacting galaxies separated by a projected distance of @xmath185 kpc .",
    "the lack of strong absorption systems detected at such small projected distance from this galaxy pair can be explained if the inner halo gas of the two galaxies has been stripped to larger distances during the galaxy interaction .",
    "@xcite found that galaxies at @xmath186 and of @xmath187 exhibit near unity covering fraction at @xmath188 kpc and concluded that such `` sub-@xmath36 '' galaxies possess ovi bearing gaseous halos that extend to @xmath29 .",
    "our highly complete galaxy survey data shed new light on these observations , indicating that ovi absorption at such large distances from galaxy halos arise in systems of multiple galaxies .",
    "indeed , a literature search of the nasa extragalactic database for spectroscopic neighbors reveals that all of the galaxies of @xmath187 from @xcite with ovi absorption at @xmath189 have neighbors within @xmath190 kpc and satisfy our definition of a non - isolated galaxy ( see figure [ figure : prochaska2011 ] )",
    ". the data from @xcite are therefore consistent with our conclusion that isolated galaxies exhibit low covering fractions at @xmath191 and support the possibility that galaxy interactions are effective at producing ovi absorbing gas at large projected distances .     for sub-@xmath36 galaxies of @xmath192 .",
    "galaxies from the ecgm survey are shown as black circles , those from @xcite as magenta squares , and those from @xcite as orange triangles .",
    "non - isolated galaxies are outlined by large black symbols . ]      even among isolated galaxies , ovi absorption extends beyond the `` metal - boundary '' observed by @xcite at @xmath194 in lower - ionization state , enriched gas traced by absorbers such as siii , siiii , cii , and civ .",
    "specifically , we find ovi absorption for seven of ten isolated galaxies at @xmath193 to @xmath159 .",
    "the presence of ovi absorption in the outer regions of isolated galaxy halos indicates some heavy element enrichment at large radii and that highly ionized , ovi bearing clouds can form or survive in the outer halo while siii , siiii , and civ bearing clouds can not . using the mean absorption found in a stack of isolated galaxies in the ecgm and cos - halos samples at @xmath195",
    ", we estimate the mean metallicity of these clouds . in the stack ,",
    "we measure absorption of @xmath196 , @xmath197 , and place an upper limit on ciii absorption of @xmath198 . assuming photoionization equilibrium models calculated with cloudy @xcite version 10.0 , a photoionization background from @xcite at @xmath199 , and solar abundance patterns , these mean column densities are consistent with gas in photoionization equilibrium with ionization parameter @xmath200 and a metallicity of one - tenth solar .",
    "the ovi and hi bearing gas may not be co - spatial allowing the ionization parameter of the hi gas to be lower . if this is the case , then the upper limit on ciii absorption places stricter upper limits on the mean gas metallicity .",
    "we therefore place an upper limit of one - tenth solar on the mean metallicity of outer - halo hi gas clouds at @xmath201 .",
    "this is consistent with the metallicity upper limit of one - tenth solar found by @xcite based on civ non - detections at @xmath202 .",
    "we find excess hi and ovi absorption around late - type galaxies relative to early - type ones at @xmath17 with @xmath203 and @xmath204 confidence respectively , extending previous results from @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite to larger distances .",
    "the ovi excess around late - type galaxies could be explained if the ionization mechanisms that produce ovi absorbing gas are the result of star - formation ( e.g. photoionization from a young stellar population ) .",
    "however , this is not consistent with the observed hi excess unless the ionization mechanism is effective at producing highly ionized heavy element species but ineffective at ionizing hydrogen ( e.g. auger ionization )",
    ".    higher levels of hi and ovi absorption around late - type galaxies could be simultaneously explained if the absorption systems trace starburst driven outflows .",
    "however , simulations from @xcite that incorporate strong , momentum - driven winds find that these outflows are characterized by a turnaround radius of @xmath205 kpc with only weak dependence on mass and redshift at @xmath206 . for the late - type galaxies in our survey , this corresponds to only @xmath207 , far less than @xmath17 .",
    "alternatively , the excess hi and ovi absorption at large distances from late - type galaxies can be explained if hi , ovi , and star - formation are observational signatures of halos in cosmic environments with multi - phase gaseous reservoirs .",
    "the late - type members of the ecgm and cos - halos galaxy samples are systematically less massive than the early - type members with mean stellar masses of @xmath208 corresponding to inferred halo masses of @xmath209 respectively .",
    "the mean doppler parameter of the hi absorption components detected at @xmath17 from ecgm galaxies is @xmath210 @xmath49 which indicates that the hi absorbers trace cool - warm , @xmath211 k gas .",
    "our survey data are therefore consistent with a decreased incidence of cool - warm gas around more massive halos .",
    "this extends previous results from @xcite and @xcite who found reduced cool - warm gas absorption in @xmath212 mass halos relative to less massive ones . a larger sample of early - type galaxies probed in absorption",
    "is required to differentiate the effects of recent star - formation activity and mass .",
