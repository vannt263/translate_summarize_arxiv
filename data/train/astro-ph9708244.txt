    ", it is now feasible to obtain both photometry for the m subdwarfs in globular clusters with the hubble space telescope ( e.g. , @xcite ) and spectra for m dwarfs and m subdwarfs at distances of a few kiloparsecs above the galactic plane with 10-meter class telescopes ( @xcite ) . using these objects as probes of galactic structure , however , requires a good understanding of their properties in order to derive metallicities and luminosities .",

    "we present spectra of three m subdwarfs which are companions to hotter subdwarfs of known metallicity .",

    "the setup is similar to that used by reid , hawley , & gizis ( 1995 ) and g97 . the spectra were wavelength calibrated with neon and argon lamps and flux calibrated with the gunn & oke ( 1983 ) standards using figaro .",

    "the two sdm stars g 116 - 009b and vb 12 lie quite close to separation line between sdm and esdm , implying that they have similar @xmath2 $ ] near to the lower end of the sdm range , i.e. @xmath20 or @xmath21 . the indices of g 176 - 046d indicate that it is substantially more metal - rich than the other stars .",

    "these values place it slightly above the extreme subdwarf sequence ( @xcite ; @xcite ) as expected from the bandstrength indices .",
    "the current g97 m - subdwarf metallicity scale is in good agreement with the clla metallicities although the possibility remains of systematic uncertainties at the @xmath17 dex level .",
    "one potential problem is the elemental abundance ratios used in the allard & hauschildt ( 1995 ) model atmospheres which form the basis of the g97 calibration .",
    "those atmospheres are computed using scaled solar metallicities .",
    "however , ruan s ( 1991 ) spectroscopic analysis of vb 12 ( and hd 219617 ) indicates that both stars have the expected oxygen- and @xmath29-enhancement , and that changing the abundance ratios has a significant effect on the colors .",
    "baraffe et al .",
    "( 1997 ) have argued that the appropriate method of comparing stellar interior models ( as well as stellar atmosphere models ) for the m - subdwarfs is to consider @xmath2 \\approx [ o / h ] = [ fe / h ] + [ o / fe ] \\approx [ fe / h ] + 0.35 $ ] for @xmath24 \\le -1 $ ] .",

    "the discrepancy between the two calibrations is thus at least 0.5 dex .    since the publication of gizis analysis , reid ( 1997a ) and gratton et al ( 1997 ) have used main - sequence fitting to re - derive distances to a number of well - known clusters , using nearby f & g subdwarfs with high - precision hipparcos parallax measurements as local calibrators .",
    "the resultant distances are significantly higher for the lowest abundance clusters ( such as m92 , m15 and ngc 6397 ) .",
    "we can compare the re - calibrated cluster color - magnitude diagrams against the ( m@xmath31 , ( v - i ) ) distribution of the local m subdwarfs . in figure  [ fig - newhst ] , we plot the parallax subdwarfs classified by gizis ( 1997 ) .",
