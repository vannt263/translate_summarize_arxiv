    "it is found in many cases that hamiltonian chaotic dynamics possesses in many cases a kinetics that does nt obey the gaussian law process and that fluctuations of the observables can be persistent , i.e. there is no any characteristing time of the fluctuations decay .",
    "this type of dynamics can be characterized by the so called polynomial complexity rather than an exponential one .",
    "more accurately , one can introduce some complexity function and entropy function based on the dynamical process of separation of trajectories in phase space by a finite distance during a finite time .",
    "the new approach to the problem of complexity and entropy covers different limit cases , exponential and polynomial , depending on the local instability of trajectories and the way of the trajectories dispersion .",
    "the complexity of dynamical systems begins from the description of chaotic trajectories in phase space ( @xcite ) .",
    "the notion of complexity has a rigorous meaning and it presents a quantity that characterizes systems and can be measured .",
    "in an oversimplified way one can say that the less predictable is a system , the larger complexity should be assigned to the system .",
    "the original version of the dynamics complexity was closely linked to the system s instability and entropy @xcite .",
    "a typical situation of the chaotic dynamics could be associated with a positive kolmogorov - sinai entropy , or be similar to the anosov - type systems .",
    "this type of randomness and complexity of the systems can be characterized by the exponential divergence of trajectories in phase space .    as long as investigation of chaotic dynamics reveals new and more detailed pictures of chaos , the simplified old version of the complexity appears to be constrained to be applied to typical systems .",
    "let us mention that the typical hamiltonians do not possess ergodicity , the boundary of islands in phase space make the dynamics singular in their vicinity , and even zero measure phase space domains in the sinai billiard are responsible for the anomalous kinetics @xcite .",
    "attempts to find adequate complexity definitions for realistic chaotic dynamics were subject to many publications and reviews @xcite .",
    "the basic idea of new developments for chaotic systems is to involve a finite time of the systems unstable evolution into a definition of the complexity or entropy . in some sense",
    ", our paper is a continuation of these attempts .",
    "there are numerous observations that the hamiltonian systems referred as the chaotic ones , _ do not have _ exponential dispersion of trajectories for arbitrary long time intervals",
    ". these pieces of trajectories , called flights , appear with a probability that is not exponentially small ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "a similar type of random dynamics with zero lyapunov exponent appears in billiards and maps with discontinuities ( @xcite ) .",
    "the behavior of systems with zero lyapunov exponents definitely have some level of complexity and some value of entropy in a physical sense , but the same systems with zero lyapunov exponent can not be applied to by the regular notion of the kolmogorov - sinai entropy of the standard definitions of complexity .",
    "the most appropriate thing to say about such systems is that the proliferation of an indefiniteness has an algebraic dependence on time rather than the exponential one .",
    "moreover , some systems behave in a mixed way : partly with an exponential growth of their enveloping ( coarse - grained ) phases volume and partly with its algebraic growth with time .",
    "all the above mentioned facts lead us to a necessity to introduce a new notion of complexity and entropy and this is the goal of this paper .",
    "our scheme is based on a similar one to the bowen idea of the @xmath2-separation of trajectories , which explicitly imposes the instability features of the dynamics .",
    "however , instead of the complexity @xmath11 we introduce a complexity function @xmath0 which is similar to a propagator @xmath3 with a replacement @xmath12 where @xmath5 is the natural length of trajectories between @xmath13 .",
    "the corresponding entropy @xmath1 can be defined as @xmath14 . in this form",
    "the complexity and entropy describe the system evolution in space - time without assumption of the space - time separation .",
    "another important change is related to the choice of _ basic variables _ which can be @xmath15 , @xmath16 instead of @xmath17 .",
    "similar logarithmic variable @xmath18 instead of @xmath4 appeared in @xcite for a definition of entropy when lvy distributions is considered .",
    "we show that for some typical cases @xmath19 possesses invariants @xmath9 similar to the riemann invariants for the simple wave propagations .",
    "the invariants @xmath9 do not depend on @xmath2 and they represent space - time fractal dimensions of the dynamical system . in the proposed way of description of random dynamics , the notions of _ complexity function _ and _ entropy function _ appear to be constructive tools of the description of dynamics with zero or nonzero lyapunov exponents , with mixing or weak mixing properties , and with normal or anomalous transport .",
    "a similar approach can be developed for a system with mixed features when the basic variables are @xmath20 or @xmath21 . in all considered cases",
    "the _ entropy is an additive function _ of the corresponding basic variables .    as an important consequence of the new notions , we consider directional complexity and directional entropy generalizing the notion introduction in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "consider a dynamical system on the 2@xmath22-dimensional torus @xmath23 and let the dynamics of a particle be defined by an evolution operator @xmath24 , \\label{eq : eq2.1}\\ ] ] which preserves the measure @xmath25 = const ( phase volume ) , and @xmath26 are generalized momentum and coordinate .",
    "what kind of dynamics should be considered as a simple one and what as a complex one ?",
    "we do not assume that there is the only definition of complexity which particularly depends on how a notion of it will be applied to the dynamics .",
    "a more or less typical definition of the complexity depends on how trajectories are mixed in phase space due to the dynamics ( [ eq : eq2.1 ] ) .",
    "the stronger is mixing , the more complex is the dynamics .",
    "one can immediately comment on some weak features of this type of approach which deals with global phase space and global mixing .",
    "the process of mixing can be non - uniform in time and it can have local space - different rates .",
    "we call these features of mixing as space - time non - uniformities and , speaking about the space , we have in mind the full phase space or its part where the dynamics is ergodic .",
    "the former comment leads us to a possibility of such definition of the complexity which could embrace non - uniformity of space - time dynamic processes represented by trajectories .",
    "space - time non - uniformity suggests that vicinities of any trajectory considered at different points @xmath27 with @xmath28 , @xmath29 may have very different dynamics of trajectories ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "a strong `` inconvenience '' of this conclusion becomes clear if we assume the `` vicinity '' as an infinitesimal ball of the radius @xmath30 around a point @xmath31 : it is difficult , if not impossible , to describe a trajectory finite - term behavior on the basis of the information about the trajectory from an infinitesimal domain of phase space .",
    "the necessary data should arrive from finite pieces of trajectories which make a possible definition of complexity to be space - time non - local",
    ". we should be ready to have a situation with an exponential divergence of trajectories at some small parts of the phase space , and to have a sub - exponential divergence at other parts .",
    "the importance of observing a trajectory with some precision @xmath2 during a finite time @xmath32 was discussed in detail by grassberger and procaccia in [ gp ] and [ p ] .",
    "they also consider fluctuations of the lyapunov exponents obtained from a finite time observation .",
    "these works also presented a space - time partitioning as a way to obtain correlation properties of trajectories .",
    "our analysis here will be extended , comparing to [ gp ] and [ p ] , in two directions : it will be applied to dynamical systems that may have a sub - exponential divergence of trajectories at some phase space domains , and it will deal with area - preserving hamiltonian dynamics , which permits the use of some important results on the poincar recurrences .",
    "here we present a brief review of a few important definitions of complexity of dynamics that involve a bunch of orbits and their comparable behavior in phase space .",
    "historically , the first notion of complexity was introduced by hedlund and morse [ he ] for symbolic systems .",
    "let @xmath33 be an admissible sequence and @xmath34 be the set of all admissible sequences .",
    "one can say that @xmath35 are coordinates , @xmath36 is a piece of an admissible trajectory of length @xmath22 , and @xmath37 is the phase space .",
    "dynamics is defined by a shift operator @xmath38 the complexity @xmath39 of an individual orbit going through a point @xmath40 is the number of different words @xmath41 of the length @xmath22 @xmath42 in the sequence @xmath43 .",
    "if we take into account that each word @xmath44 indicates a piece of the symbolic phase space , i.e. an element of the phase space partition , then @xmath39 is the number of different cells in the phase space available by the orbit going through the initial point @xmath43 .",
    "it was shown in [ he ] that if @xmath45 then @xmath43 is eventually periodic , i.e. @xmath46 const and , for example , there is no such @xmath43 that @xmath47 .",
    "the complexity @xmath39 may grow exponentially with @xmath22 @xmath48 and in this case @xmath49 is the topological entropy .",
    "there are examples of @xmath50 i.e. of the sub - exponential complexity ( see more in [ ti ] , [ fer ] , and references therein ) .      a transition from the symbolic complexity to the complexity of dynamical systems with arbitrary topological phase space was suggested in [ bla ] .",
    "let a topological space @xmath51 and a continuous map @xmath52 @xmath53 generate a dynamical system @xmath54 , and let @xmath55 is a finite cover of the phase space by , say open , subsets .",
    "for any initial point @xmath56 one can consider different itineraries @xmath57 such that @xmath58 .",

    "then @xmath62 where @xmath49 is the topological entropy provided that @xmath61 is chosen in a right way .",
    "let us emphasize that the topological complexity deals with all orbits of a dynamical system .",
    "there are other possibilities to introduce a complexity such as kolmogorov complexity ( see for example [ br ] ) , a measure theoretical complexity [ fer1 ] , etc . , which will not be discussed here",
    ".      the definition of @xmath63-complexity will be the most important for our following generalizations , and we discuss it in more detail",

    "let @xmath69 be the maximal number of curves which are @xmath2-pairwise @xmath70-disjoint .",

    "then @xmath75 is called the @xmath2-entropy .",
    "if one assumes that @xmath76 is a piece of an orbit of a dynamical system and replaces the continuous time by discrete one , then one comes ( as it was done by bowen [ b ] ) to the following definitions .",
    "let us consider first a dynamical system generated by an evolution operator @xmath77 on the phase space @xmath68 .",
    "let @xmath78 be a subset of initial points ( it could be invariant or not ) and @xmath79 an orbit segment of temporal length @xmath22 going through an initial point @xmath80 .",
    "two segments @xmath81 and @xmath82 , @xmath83 , are said to be @xmath84-separated if there exists @xmath85 , @xmath86 , such that dist@xmath87 , where dist means distance in the phase space @xmath68 .",
    "the maximal number of distinct segments of orbits with accuracy @xmath2 is defined by @xmath88 and is said to be @xmath84-complexity of the set @xmath89 .",
    "evidently @xmath90 is the @xmath2-capacity .",
    "it was shown in [ b ] ( see also @xcite for compact invariant subset of initial points ) that @xmath91 is the topological entropy of the dynamical system @xmath92 on the set @xmath89 , and in [ t ] that @xmath93 is the upper box dimension of the set @xmath89 .",
    "thus , we may assume that if @xmath94 , @xmath95 then @xmath96 where @xmath97 is a subexponential function of @xmath98 and @xmath22 .",
    "we will call the number @xmath99 the bowen or @xmath63-complexity of the set @xmath89 .",
    "the definition ( [ eq : eq3.6 ] ) is fairly general and can be applied to non - hamiltonian and non - compact dynamics .",

    "the orbit @xmath488 for @xmath486 satisfies the equation @xmath489 therefore the rotation number of the map @xmath483 equals @xmath490 . in any window @xmath491 , @xmath492 , @xmath493 , there are points @xmath494 for any @xmath495 , but if @xmath496 , @xmath497 , then for any fixed @xmath498 there is @xmath499 such that there are no points @xmath494 , @xmath500 , in this window .",
    "more precise , if @xmath501 , @xmath502 $ ] , then @xmath503 for all @xmath504 , and the set @xmath505 does not contain points @xmath494 , @xmath506 , @xmath507 .",
    "if @xmath508 then the set @xmath505 contains points @xmath494 for any @xmath509 but the complexity @xmath510 is still bounded ; in fact , @xmath511 .",
    "the case @xmath512 is similar to the just described one and we omit its consideration .",
    "now let @xmath513 .",
    "we consider the rotation interval of the map @xmath483 , i.e. the set of accumulation points of sequences @xmath514 for all @xmath515 , ( see for instance @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "this interval can be nontrivial , say @xmath516 $ ] , @xmath517 , and for every @xmath518 $ ] there is an infinite @xmath483-invariant set @xmath519 such that @xmath520 implies @xmath521 .",
    "moreover @xmath519 may contain uncountably many points ( @xcite ) .",
    "trajectories in @xmath519 may behave chaotically and the complexity @xmath522 , @xmath496 , @xmath497 , may grow exponentially with @xmath458 , i.e. @xmath523 .",
    "but if @xmath524 $ ] then @xmath522 will be bounded ( as above ) and @xmath525 will be 0 .",
    "thus the behavior of directional complexity has nontrivial dependence on the direction in space - time .",
    "the authors of @xcite studied observable values of rotation numbers .",
    "they found numerically that even if @xmath526 one is able to observe the only one ( or a small number ) of rotation numbers corresponding to preferable directions in space - time .",
    "nonergodicity of phase space of hamiltonian dynamics is due to the presence of islands .",
    "the boundaries of the islands are sticky and this imposes strong nonuniformity of the distribution function in space and in time .",
    "such properties of the dynamics necessitates a new approach to the problem of complexity , entropy and related notions of the unstable dynamics . in this paper",
    "the notion of complexity function is introduced as a characteristic number of mutually @xmath2-separated trajectories during time @xmath32 .",
    "this notion resembles the similar features as a propagator function , i.e. it depends on the initial and final space - time .",
    "in fact , the complexity function shows how fast trajectories disperse from each other due to the local instability properties of a system .",
    "the entropy can be introduced in a natural way as a logarithm of the complexity function but the choice of variables can be different depending on the type of local instability . in this way we were able to include into the same scheme systems with strong intermittency and systems with zero lyapunov exponent .    in this article we introduced local and semi - local and flight complexity functions that can be calculated for specific systems .",
    "the question arises : why do not try to calculate just @xmath2-complexity function and work directly with it ? we think that this is impossible .",
    "the main reason becomes clear from the following consideration .",
    "fix @xmath527 and assume that we found an optimal set @xmath297 , @xmath528 , of initial @xmath63-separated points .",
    "if we are interested in the complexity function @xmath529 as a function of @xmath22 , then , say , for @xmath530 we either need to find a new optimal set or to use points in @xmath174 .",
    "of course the second option is preferable .",
    "so , the problem appears : knowing that @xmath174 is ( @xmath2 , n)-separated , select the maximal subset in @xmath174 that is ( @xmath2 , @xmath531)-separated .",
    "let us reformulates this problem as follows .",
    "define the graph @xmath532 with vertices @xmath533 such that the edge @xmath534 exists if and only if the points @xmath535 and @xmath224 are ( @xmath2 , @xmath531)-separated .",
    "the problem is to find a subgraph of @xmath532 with maximal number of vertices such that every two vertices of this subgraph are connected by an edge .",
    "this is the well - known clique problem which is happened to be so called np - complete ( see for instance  @xcite ) .",
    "specialists believe that np - complete problems have no good algorithms , i. e. one can not solve such a problem by using best computers even for not so large values of @xmath531 .",
