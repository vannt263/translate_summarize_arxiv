    "we define almost gentle algebras , a natural generalization of gentle algebras , and show that trivial extensions of such algebras by the dual of the algebra are brauer configuration algebras , theorem [ thm - triv ] .    the most surprising result concerns modules over a special multiserial algebra .",
    "we define multserial modules and show that , even though special multiserial algebras tend to be wild , every finitely generated module over a special multiserial algebra is a multiserial module , theorem [ multiserial theorem ] .",
    "there have recently been substantial advances in the classification of tame symmetric radical cubed zero algebras @xcite .",
    "we show that over an algebraically closed field , every indecomposable symmetric radical cubed zero algebra is a brauer configuration algebra , theorem [ thm - r30 ] .    throughout this paper , @xmath0 denotes a field , @xmath1 a finite quiver with vertex set @xmath2 , and arrow set @xmath3 , and @xmath4 the path algebra .",
