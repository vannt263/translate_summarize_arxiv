    "when did the first stars and galaxies form ?",
    "how can we detect them ?",
    "quasars were once the most distant objects that have ever been observed ( @xcite ) .",
    "now galaxies are beginning to take their place .",
    "discovery of a large number of galaxies at @xmath9 ( @xcite ) , and even up to @xmath10 ( @xcite ) , suggests that galaxies existed well before quasars did . in hierarchical models ,",
    "star formation starts relatively early , by @xmath11 ( @xcite ) , so even these @xmath12 galaxies are not representative of the first generation of objects .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to investigate the possibility of detecting primordial objects through the atomic lines of carbon , nitrogen and oxygen , which should have been produced as a result of star formation . at low redshift , these submillimeter lines are important coolants ( e.  g. , @xcite ) . if the source is at redshift @xmath3@xmath13 , the lines are redshifted to radio frequencies , where the atmosphere is more transparent and ground  based detectors with very high sensitivity and resolution exist .",
    "if the source was uniformly distributed through space , then its emission would merely distort the spectrum . since heavy elements produced by stars are distributed inhomogeneously , the observed emission should have intensity fluctuations as a function of both position and frequency . with high enough resolution one can in principle",
    "distinguish them from background .",
    "if we take @xmath14 as a characteristic comoving scale of the inhomogeneity , this corresponds to @xmath15 arcmin in angular scale , and @xmath16 in frequency resolution . on smaller scales ,",
    "velocity dispersion of matter limits the scale that can be resolved in frequency space . in this paper",
    "we formulate the intensity fluctuations and estimate their magnitude .",
    "this signal should give us information on number density fluctuations of specific source elements at @xmath17 .",
    "detailed determination of the peak of this signal will also tell us at which epoch elements were ionized .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    ", we present our formalism for estimating the fluctuating signal",
    ". then we estimate its magnitude in the case that the matter density fluctuations are calculated from the linear power spectrum in section [ sect : linear ] .",
    "we also estimate optimal frequency and angular resolution for an object search .",
    "we focus on atomic line redshifted into present radio band , investigating carbon , nitrogen and oxygen emission lines at rest frame wavelength of hundreds of micrometers . in section [",
    "sect : nonlin ] , we discuss the size and the number density of nonlinear clumps at the reionization epoch , and estimate intensity from nonlinear clumps and the interval between enhance of intensity fluctuations .",
    "section [ sect : paremis ] gives discussion of merits and demerits as the signal of specific emission .",
    "after alternative estimation of cii luminosity in section [ sect : altcii ] , the final section gives our conclusion .",
    "throughout this paper we make the following assumptions : by @xmath18@xmath13 , star formation has both formed metals and heated the surrounding gas initially to @xmath19 .",
    "cooling is compensated by heating so that the gas temperature @xmath20 is maintained much higher than the cmb temperature at that epoch but lower than @xmath21 .",
    "cooling by atomic transitions exceeds compton cooling , as we will see below .",
    "intensity @xmath22 of radiation in emitting medium at redshift @xmath23 is obtained by solving the radiative transfer equation : @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the speed of light , and @xmath26 and @xmath27 denote the spontaneous emission coefficient and hubble parameter , respectively . differentiation with respect to time in the left hand side",
    "is taken with @xmath28 the second term in the right hand side comes from the effect of cosmic expansion .",
    "we have assumed that absorption is negligible . integrating equation ( [ eqn : radtrans ] ) yields the present intensity at frequency @xmath29 : @xmath30 where @xmath31 in the integrand . for spontaneous transition from an upper level @xmath32 to a lower level @xmath33 releasing a photon with energy @xmath34 ,",
    "the emission coefficient is @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the planck constant , @xmath37 is the number density of the source in the upper level , @xmath38 is the einstein @xmath39coefficient , and @xmath40 is the line profile function , which we take to be equal to delta function because both natural and thermal broadening is negligible for the expected frequency resolution . since redshift of the source @xmath41 is inferred from the relation : @xmath42 we can express the line profile function as @xmath43 using equations ( [ eqn : emcoeff ] ) and ( [ eqn : lineprof ] ) in equation ( [ eqn : radtra2 ] ) yields intensity due to the line emission : @xmath44 in the einstein ",
    "de sitter universe , equation ( [ eqn : intenhub ] ) reads @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the fraction of the source that is in the upper state , and @xmath47 is the local number density of the source .",
    "orbit interaction splits each spectroscopic term of an atom into a set of energy levels .",
    "magnetic dipole transitions near the ground state of neutral and ionized carbon , nitrogen and oxygen have wavelength of hundreds of micrometers .",
    "we list such transitions in table [ tab : lines ] ( @xcite ) .",
    "these are candidates which produce intensity fluctuations .",
    "we have seen the line intensity is proportional to the number density of the source that is in the upper state .",
    "let us examine the condition for substantial number of the source to be in the upper state .",
    "if either spontaneous or stimulated emission occurs more rapidly than the collisional excitation by surrounding gas ( mainly hydrogen ) , very few atoms ( or ions ) will be in the upper state .",
    "the condition for collisional rate exceeding spontaneous and stimulated emission rates is @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the critical number density determined by @xmath50^{-1},\\ ] ] with @xmath51 being the rate coefficient for collisional de  excitation , and @xmath52 the cmb temperature at redshift @xmath23 .    if @xmath53 , the excitation temperature of the source @xmath54 is almost equal to @xmath20 , where @xmath20 is maintained around @xmath55 . in this case",
    ", the fraction @xmath56 does not depend on @xmath54 . in ci case",
    ", the excitation energies of @xmath57 and @xmath58 levels correspond to @xmath59 and @xmath60 , respectively .",
    "if we assume that the gas is in thermal equilibrium at a temperature around @xmath61 , electrons in the @xmath62 shell of ci easily transit within @xmath63 levels , while it is almost impossible to jump to @xmath58 level .",
    "therefore the fraction of atom that is in the state labeled as @xmath32 is independent of matter temperature and determined by @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the statistical weight of level @xmath32 . specifically , the fraction is @xmath66 , @xmath67 and @xmath68 for @xmath69,@xmath70 and @xmath57 of neutral carbon .",
    "if @xmath71 , the line intensity is diminished to @xmath72 in ci ( @xmath73 ) case , the critical number density of hydrogen is given by @xmath74^{-1 } \\ , { \\rm cm^{-3}}\\ ] ] ( @xcite ) .",
    "the last factor in the above expression comes from the effect of stimulated emission .",
    "the effect is important for the ci @xmath73 line , but is negligible for the other fine structure transitions of interest here at @xmath75 .",
    "the excitation of ions is induced mainly by the collisions with electrons , if the gas is ionized .",
    "the condition ( [ eqn : condit ] ) is determined by the critical number density of electron @xmath76 ( @xcite ) , in cii ( @xmath77 ) case .      at @xmath18@xmath13 , the mean density of gas @xmath78",
    "^ 3 \\,{\\rm cm^{-3}}$ ] is lower than the critical number density .",
    "the condition for sufficient magnitude of signal , however , is attached to local number density of the source .",
    "the condition ( [ eqn : condit ] ) can hold in the virialized object , even if @xmath79 .",
    "let us express by @xmath80 the fraction of gas within the relevant scale which satisfies @xmath53 .",
    "then the smoothed intensity is given by @xmath81     n_{{\\rm h},0 } ( 1+z_{\\rm s})^{-3/2},\\ ] ] where @xmath82 $ ] is relative abundance of the atom , and @xmath83 is present hydrogen number density .",
    "it is uncertain to what degree the baryonic gas condenses in dark matter halos .",
    "however , it seems reasonable to expect that the gas inside such halos can radiatively cool and form a gaseous disk , whose radius is @xmath84 , where @xmath85 is the spin parameter and @xmath86 is the virial radius ( @xcite ) . if this is the case , we expect the mean gas density to be at least @xmath87 ( @xmath88 ) times the mean cosmic gas density at collapse , where @xmath89 ( @xcite ) typically . for objects that form at @xmath90 ,",
    "this implies a characteristic number density of baryonic gas of at least @xmath91 . with this consideration in mind , @xmath80 is estimated by the fraction of matter within the collapsed objects with mass @xmath92 greater than the jeans mass @xmath93 .",
    "by @xmath94 , the fraction amounts to @xmath95 percent of the total mass in the universe ( @xcite ) , assuming @xmath96 . in the case",
    "that gas is considerably reheated , @xmath93 rises to @xmath97 and @xmath98 ( @xcite ) .",
    "gas clumps in these halos are optically thin in the relevant lines , and therefore the formulation in section [ subsect : formul ] is valid .",
    "for example , the one  dimensional velocity dispersion of a @xmath99 halo at @xmath94 is estimated to be @xmath100 using the spherical collapse model .",
    "the size of the gas clump inside the halo with @xmath101 is @xmath102 . with these numbers and @xmath103 , the optical depth in the ci @xmath104 line",
    "is estimated to be around @xmath105 .",
    "intensity fluctuations with frequency correspond to number density fluctuations around relevant redshift : @xmath106 even if the intensity @xmath107 itself is smaller than the cmb intensity @xmath108 , the fluctuations @xmath109 can be extracted as difference between those at different frequencies .",
    "in this section , let us estimate the signal originated from the inhomogeneities on a characteristic scale @xmath110 corresponding to linear perturbation . in the next section ,",
    "we focus on smaller scales and estimate the intensity from nonlinear clumps .      in this and next sections , we take ci ( @xmath73 ) as an example ( @xcite ) .",
    "essential discussion is common with other lines .",
    "since the ionization state of the universe at @xmath111 is not known , we begin by assuming that most of the carbon at @xmath94 is in the form of ci . the ratio of the intensity of ci ( @xmath73 ) line emitted at @xmath94 to total intensity @xmath112 can be calculated from equation ( [ eqn : smoint ] ) with @xmath113 ( section [ subsect : crnum ] ) : @xmath114 where @xmath115 is the present hubble parameter in units of @xmath116 , and @xmath117 is the present baryon density parameter .",
    "it is reasonable to expect that @xmath103 by @xmath94 .",
    "numerical simulation ( @xcite ) of nonlinear self  gravitating clumps at high redshift shows they have a metallicity @xmath118 in the high density regions .",
    "observation of civ absorption in ly @xmath119 forest clouds also supports the above value of @xmath120 . in this paper",
    ", we adopt @xmath121 for the solar abundance of carbon , nitrogen and oxygen ( @xcite ) .    for @xmath122 ,",
    "if most of the carbon is in its ground states and @xmath53 , then cooling by the ci line emission exceeds compton cooling : the cooling time due to the ci line emission can be estimated as @xmath123 where @xmath124 is boltzmann s constant .",
    "on the other hand , compton cooling time is ( @xcite ) @xmath125                               \\biggl(\\frac{1+z}{10}\\biggr)^{\\!\\!-4}\\ { \\rm yr},\\ ] ] where @xmath126 is the number density of free electrons .",
    "we can estimate number density fluctuations in the standard cold dark matter ( cdm ) model with @xmath127 , the density parameter @xmath128 , and the present density fluctuations on @xmath129 scale @xmath130 : @xmath131 on @xmath132 scale at @xmath133 .",
    "this has been calculated from the cdm power spectrum @xmath134 given by bardeen et al .",
    "this is a conservative estimate as the predicted fluctuation level is even larger in vacuum  dominated or open models .",
    "therefore the magnitude of the signal becomes @xmath135 in the standard cdm model .",
    "table [ tab : lines ] summarizes predictions of intensity fluctuations with other elements .",
    "note that each value has been calculated assuming that 100% of the element is in the form of the neutral atom or the ion in the first column .",
    "actual signal is reduced by the fraction of the species in each element .",
    "since the metals are produced in dense regions , they will be `` biased '' tracers of the underlying mass .",
    "this implies that @xmath136 where @xmath137 is the bias parameter .",
    "gnedin and ostriker ( 1996 ) find a strong correlation between metallicity and density .",
    "if @xmath138 , then in the linear regime , this implies @xmath139 , which enhances the signal over the values estimated in table [ tab : lines ] .",
    "now , we investigate the resolution that we need to detect the intensity fluctuations due to the line emission .",
    "the comoving length scale @xmath140 probed with frequency resolution @xmath141 is given by @xmath142 where @xmath143 is the conformal time , and @xmath144 .",
    "in the einstein ",
    "de sitter universe , @xmath145 an observation with a resolution @xmath146 means that we probe the matter density inhomogeneities smoothed by spatial thickness @xmath140 .",
    "figure [ fig : f1 ] shows predicted smoothed intensity fluctuations in the standard cdm model which are observed with given resolution @xmath141 in ci ( @xmath73 ) and ci ( @xmath147 ) cases .",
    "it also shows the signal for cii ( @xmath148 ) in the case where most carbon is in the form of cii .",
    "higher frequency resolution brings larger signal because of larger matter density fluctuations . for appropriate correspondence of frequency space to source positions",
    ", @xmath140 is required to satisfy the relation : @xmath149 here @xmath150 is the random velocity inside a spherical region of comoving radius @xmath140 : @xmath151,\\ ] ] where @xmath152 . in the standard cdm model , the relation ( [ eqn : ranvelsm ] ) yields @xmath153 and @xmath154 .",
    "let us move on to the needed angular resolution . to maximize observed intensity fluctuations , we need angular resolution @xmath155 corresponding to @xmath140 . in the einstein",
    " de sitter universe , this angular resolution is given by @xmath156 where the last value is for @xmath94 .",
    "if we observe with high enough angular resolution , we should be able to detect features from individual clumps , rather than from linear matter inhomogeneities .",
    "more concentrated objects will be potentially stronger sources",
    ". hierarchical clustering model of structure formation in the universe tells us how nonlinear clumps formed in the process of gravitational instability growing .",
    "let us estimate typical values of the comoving size of clumps @xmath157 and the mean separation among clumps @xmath158 at @xmath94 .",
    "the comoving number density of clumps with in the mass range @xmath159 at @xmath23 is given by the press ",
    "schechter ( 1974 ) formalism : @xmath160 dm,\\ ] ] where @xmath161 is the mean comoving density of matter , @xmath162 is the overdensity threshold , @xmath163 is the growing function of perturbations , and @xmath164 is the variance of density field smoothed with mass scale @xmath92 . since @xmath164 is a decreasing function of @xmath92 , the comoving number density ( equation [ eqn : psmass ] ) exponentially falls down at large mass .",
    "therefore we can estimate the typical mass of clumps @xmath165 by a relation : @xmath166 since the density of virialized objects is @xmath167 times the mean density of the universe in spherical collapse model , @xmath157 is related to @xmath165 by @xmath168 . furthermore , the mean comoving separation @xmath169 is given from the comoving number density : @xmath170 we make use of the fitting formula for @xmath171 in cdm models by ( @xcite ) : @xmath172 which gives a good fit between @xmath173 . here",
    "@xmath174 , and @xmath175 . in the standard cdm model ( @xmath128 )",
    "with @xmath127 and @xmath130 , the above equations yield @xmath176 at @xmath94 . in terms of @xmath146",
    ", these numbers correspond to @xmath177 and @xmath178 .    the one  dimensional velocity dispersion of these typical clumps is estimated as @xmath179 which corresponds to @xmath180 .",
    "hence the effective overdensity of the clump is @xmath181 in ci ( @xmath73 ) case , for example , bumps of @xmath182 are expected to appear with mean interval of @xmath178 in @xmath146 , if observation is made with frequency resolution @xmath180 and angular resolution @xmath183 . here",
    "the angular resolution is related through equation ( [ eqn : angres ] ) with the clump size @xmath157 . in more conventional units in radio astronomy , this line has intensity of @xmath184 , where @xmath185 is the increment of brightness temperature . in ci ( @xmath147 )",
    "case , the amplitude of intensity fluctuations are estimated to be @xmath186 , that is @xmath187 , with the same resolution . alternatively ,",
    "if we assume that most carbon is in the form of cii , the signal of cii ( @xmath148 ) line is estimated to be @xmath188 , that is @xmath189 .",
    "the observed signal will depend upon the ionization state and abundance of each element . here",
    ", we present a simple consideration regarding the ionization state based on ionization potential . more realistic treatment of ionization of each element requires detailed computation including temperature and density inhomogeneities of gas and radiative transfer , which is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "ci @xmath104 and @xmath190 lines have the longest wavelength among the lines discussed here .",
    "if @xmath191@xmath13 , they are easiest to observe from ground . in addition , they can easily be distinguished from others . even if the signal is weak , one can extract the signal by cross  correlating different portions of observed spectrum corresponding to these two wavelengths .",
    "the most serious concern is that the same star that produce carbon , will quickly ionize much of it to cii .",
    "the ionization potential of ci , 11.3 ev , is smaller than that of hydrogen , so we may have large mostly neutral regions containing cii .",
    "since carbon is so easily ionized , cii @xmath192 line may be a more promising candidate to be detected .",
    "cii is the brightest submillimeter line in our galaxy ( @xcite ) .",
    "unfortunately , this is a single line and its higher frequency makes ground  based detection more challenging .",
    "other promising candidates are nii @xmath193 and @xmath194 , and oi @xmath195 lines .",
    "nitrogen is expected to be abundant only after a relatively low redshift , since it is mainly produced in metal  enriched stars through incomplete cno burning .",
    "moreover , the ionization potential of nitrogen is 14.5 ev , so it is more difficult to ionize than hydrogen . on the other hand ,",
    "oi abundance is supposed to peak around the reionization epoch ; the ionization potential of oxygen is 13.6 ev , nearly equal to that of hydrogen , and charge exchange reaction ( o@xmath196 + h @xmath197 o + h@xmath196 ) imply that @xmath198 .",
    "the other , relatively short  wavelength lines are not likely to be observed from the ground , unless there was significant amount of metal production by @xmath199@xmath95 . moreover , niii and oiii probably never have been dominant species in each element ; the ionization potential of nii and oii are 29.6 ev and 35.1 ev , respectively",
    ". however , their line intensity is so strong that they may be useful to place an interesting constraint on the state of matter and radiation field at @xmath199@xmath95 .",
    "we can make an alternative estimate of the cii @xmath77 line intensity , clued by the measurement that roughly @xmath200 percent of the luminosity from low redshift galaxies is emitted in the cii line ( @xcite ) . though there is a possibility that the metal contamination may have somewhat changed the fraction , we assume that the same fraction ( @xmath200 percent ) of the luminosity from small cloudlets at @xmath201 is emitted in the cii line .",
    "we estimate the luminosity density @xmath202 of the cii emission instead of @xmath203 in equation ( [ eqn : emcoeff ] ) .",
    "we assume that the small cloudlets evolve with a constant star formation rate @xmath204 per comoving unit volume from the salpeter type initial mass function @xmath205 ( @xcite ) and achieve metallicity @xmath206 by @xmath201 .",
    "we use the integrated abundance yields of type ii supernovae tabulated by thielemann , nomoto , and hashimoto ( 1993 ) to derive the star formation rate @xmath207 where @xmath208 is the comoving number density of hydrogen . then the comoving luminosity density in the b ",
    "band is given by @xmath209 where @xmath210 is the age of the universe at @xmath201 , @xmath211 and @xmath212 are the age and the b  band luminosity of a star whose mass is @xmath92 , respectively , and @xmath213 is the mass which satisfies @xmath214 .    the resultant comoving luminosity density is @xmath215 ( at @xmath216 ) , @xmath217 ( at @xmath218 ) .",
    "we find that these are in good agreement with the previous estimate @xmath219 .",
    "we conclude that the cii intensity fluctuations estimated alternatively here are almost the same magnitude as the previous result ( table [ tab : lines ] ) .",
    "we have proposed a new and promising method to detect the first objects : search for carbon , nitrogen and oxygen line emission at @xmath94@xmath13 .",
    "we conclude that the intensity fluctuations originated from the emission are detectable in radio band ( @xmath1@xmath2 ) .",
    "if observation is carried out with angular resolution @xmath220 and spectral resolution @xmath221 , the magnitude of the smoothed intensity fluctuations corresponding with linear matter density fluctuations is predicted as @xmath222 and @xmath223 ( in ci @xmath224 and @xmath147 cases ) from sources at @xmath94 , in the standard cdm model .",
    "the predictions for other lines are @xmath225 , respectively , in [ @xmath226(cii ) , @xmath227(oi ) , @xmath228(nii ) , @xmath229(nii ) ] @xmath230 cases .",

    "if detected , these features will provide useful information on matter inhomogeneities at @xmath94@xmath13 .",
