    "in recent years , galaxy formation models have become increasingly interested in the radio agn phenomenon , because it is hypothesized that these objects may regulate the star formation history and mass assembly of the most massive galaxies and black holes in the universe .",
    "nearby radio galaxies in clusters are observed to inject a significant amount of energy into the surrounding gas .",
    "as the radio jets expand and interact with the surrounding medium , they are believed to heat the gas and prevent further accretion onto the central galaxy .",
    "the precise conditions that determine whether an agn develops radio jets / lobes are still a matter of debate .",
    "several studies have shown that the probability for a galaxy to become radio - loud is a strong function of stellar mass and redshift ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the role that the environment plays in triggering or regulating the rlagn phenomenon is not as well established .",
    "@xcite found that the fraction of radio sources and the shape of the bivariate radio - optical was the same for objects in cluster and field environments .",
    "@xcite found that group and cluster galaxies had similar radio properties to field galaxies , but the brightest galaxies at the centers of the groups where more likely to host radio - loud agn than other galaxies of the same stellar mass . in the local universe",
    ", @xcite analyzed a large sample of rlagn at z@xmath40.1 .",
    "they showed that rlagn inhabit massive dark matter halos ( @xmath5  m@xmath6 ) and that , at fixed stellar mass , radio - loud agn are found in more massive dark matter halos than control galaxies of the same mass selected without regard to agn properties .",
    "this result implies that rlagn follow a different halo mass - stellar mass relation than normal galaxies .",
    "@xcite also found that the boost towards larger halo masses did not depend on radio luminosity .",
    "@xcite investigated the clustering in a small sample of higher redshift radio - loud agn selected from the agn and galaxy evolution survey ( ages ) .",
    "they found no difference in the clustering amplitude of radio galaxies when compared to normal galaxies matched in redshift , luminosity and color .",
    "most nearby rlagn lack any of the standard accretion - related signatures that would indicate that their black holes are growing significantly at the present day ( @xcite ) .",
    "in contrast , quasars are thought to be powered by supermassive black holes accreting at close to the eddington rate .",
    "large redshift surveys like the two degree field galaxy redshift survey ( 2dfgrs ) and the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) now provide angular positions , accurate photometry and spectra for tens of thousands of qsos .",
    "recent determinations of the quasar two - point correlation function have demonstrated that at @xmath7 quasars cluster like normal @xmath8 galaxies ( @xcite ; @xcite ) and populate dark matter halos of @xmath9  m@xmath6 , with the clustering only weakly dependent on luminosity , color and virial black hole mass ( @xcite ) .",
    "as one moves out in redshift , the radio - loud agn population evolves very rapidly in radio luminosity .",
    "whether the rlagn population also evolves strongly in black hole accretion rate , is considerably less clear . in particular , our understanding of whether there is a relationship between powerful , high redshift radio - loud agn and quasars is quite sketchy .",
    "around 10% of the quasar population is radio - loud .",
    "numerous investigations have found that radio - loud quasars and at least _",
    "some _ powerful radio galaxies share a number of common characteristics , such as excess infrared emission , comparable radio morphologies and luminosities , optical emission lines , large evolutionary rates , and host galaxies with similar properties .",
    "it has thus been tempting to link both phenomena under the hypothesis that they are the same active nuclei viewed at different orientations ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "a few facts are believed to be key in any attempt to understand the transition from the population of low - luminosity radio agn produced by weakly accreting black holes at low redshifts , to a population of high - luminosity radio agn that may be produced by strongly accreting black holes at high redshifts .",
    "@xcite found an important correlation between radio morphology and radio power : low luminosity sources ( fanaroff - riley class i , fri ) show emission peaking close to the nuclei that fades toward the edges , whereas more luminous sources ( fanaroff - riley class ii , frii ) are brightest toward the edges .",
    "@xcite discovered that radio galaxies could also be classified according to the strength of their optical emission lines : low excitation ( weak - lined ) radio galaxies or lergs , and high excitation ( strong - lined ) objects or hergs .",
    "modern unification models usually associate quasars with the most powerful hergs , and low luminosity lergs with bl lac objects .",
    "although there is a notable correspondence between rlagn luminosity , morphology and spectral type , i.e. lower luminosity fris with lergs , and higher luminosity friis with hergs , the correlations between these properties are not straightforward .",
    "there are populations of fri sources with high excitation nuclear lines , and conversely , frii galaxies with low excitation spectra are also common .",
    "it has been known for years that very high redshift ( @xmath10 ) , powerful radio galaxies are often surrounded by galaxy overdensities with sizes of a few mpc ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) . since we know that quasars at the same redshift are clustered like normal @xmath8 galaxies , this would seem to throw some doubt on a simple unified scheme for explaining both phenomena .    in view of this highly complex situation , a more statistical approach to comparing the properties of quasars and radio galaxies may yield further insight . in this paper",
    "we present measurements of the projected cross - correlation between a sample of 14,000 radio - loud agn with a median redshift of @xmath11 with the surrounding population of massive galaxies ( @xmath12  m@xmath6 ) .",
    "the large size of our samples allows us to investigate in detail how clustering depends on stellar mass and on radio luminosity . by comparing the rlagn clustering with results from control samples matched in redshift , luminosity and mass",
    ", we isolate the effect that the radio agn phenomenon has on the clustering signal .",
    "we cross - correlate radio quasars drawn from the sdss with the same reference sample of massive galaxies .",
    "again , by using control samples matched in black hole mass and radio luminosity , we ensure that we compare rlagn and rlqsos in as uniform a way as possible .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we describe the surveys and samples used in this work . in section 3",
    "we explain the methodology adopted to calculate the two - point correlation function .",
    "section 4 presents the results on radio - loud agn and quasar clustering .",
    "finally , in section 5 we summarize our results and discuss the implications of this work .    throughout the paper we assume a flat @xmath13cdm cosmology , with @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "unless otherwise stated , we adopt @xmath16/(100 km s@xmath2 ) and present the results in units of mpc  @xmath17 with @xmath18 .",
    "the sloan digital sky survey ( @xcite ; @xcite ) is a five - band photometric and spectroscopic survey that has mapped almost a quarter of the whole sky , providing precise photometry for more than 200 million objects and accurate redshifts for about a million galaxies and quasars .",
    "the megaz - lrg ( @xcite ) is a photometric redshift catalogue based on imaging data from the fourth data release ( dr4 ) of the sdss .",
    "it consists of @xmath41.2 million luminous red galaxies ( lrg ) with limiting magnitude @xmath19 over the redshift range @xmath20 .",
    "megaz adopts various color and magnitude cuts to isolate red galaxies at @xmath20 .",
    "the cuts are very similar to those adopted by the ` 2df - sdss lrg and quasar ' project ( 2slaq , @xcite ) .",
    "accurate photometric redshifts are available for the entire lrg sample .",
    "these are derived using a neural network photometric redshift estimator ( annz , @xcite ) that was trained using a sample of @xmath21 lrg with spectroscopic redshifts selected from 2slaq . the r.m.s .",
    "average photometric redshift error for all the galaxies in the sample is @xmath22 .      by combining the optical megaz - lrg catalogue with data from the nrao vla sky survey ( nvss ; @xcite ) and the vla faint images of the radio sky at twenty centimeters ( first ;",
    "@xcite ) , @xcite constructed a catalogue of 14453 radio - loud agn with 1.4 ghz fluxes above 3.5 mjy .",
    "the cross - matching method utilized a collapsing algorithm to identify multiple - component first and nvss sources and the method was optimized to take advantage of both surveys .",
    "nvss has sufficient surface brightness sensitivity to provide accurate flux measurements of extended radio sources with lobes and jets .",
    "on the other hand , the superior angular resolution of first is crucial to identify the central core component of each radio source and to provide a robust association between the radio source and the optically - identified host galaxy .",
    "monte - carlo simulations were used to estimate the reliability ( @xmath498.3% ) and completeness level ( 95% ) of the catalogue .",
    "the vast majority of the detected radio agn ( 78.6% ) are single component sources in both nvss and first .",
    "there is , however , a significant fraction of objects without ( catalogued ) high s / n first detections ( @xmath48% ) , so the authors introduced a method for analyzing radio maps that allowed them to dig deeper into the first survey and to use lower s / n detections to pinpoint the location of the host galaxy .",
    "we refer the reader to the original paper by @xcite for a detailed description of these procedures and the matching algorithm .",
    "in this work we use quasars selected from the fourth edition of the spectroscopic quasar catalogue ( @xcite ) .",
    "this contains 77,429 quasars drawn from sdss dr5 , with luminosities larger than @xmath23 , that have at least one broad emission line with fwhm@xmath241000  km  s@xmath2 in their spectra .",
    "the catalogue also identified radio - loud quasars with first components within a 2  arcsec radius .",
    "most of the objects targeted as quasars were initially selected using the algorithm of @xcite , which pick candidates using @xmath25 broadband photometry and by matching with unresolved first sources .",
    "as the survey progressed , the quasar selection software was modified to improve its efficiency at high redshift .",
    "this is reflected in two spectroscopic target selection flags listed as target and best ( for the final algorithm ) .",
    "photometry of quasars is also available in two versions , target measurements ( values used at the time of targeting ) , and best measurements ( values derived with the latest pipeline ) .",
    "we note that the selection of uv - excess quasars at low redshifts ( @xmath26 ) has remained essentially unchanged , so that only small differences arise from using target or best versions .",
    "in addition , the bias introduced by selection of targets via first radio detections is significant only at high redshift .    in this work",
    "we are interested in cross - correlating the quasars with the lrgs described above .",
    "we therefore selected an homogeneous quasar sample consisting of all quasars with @xmath27 and psf magnitudes in the range @xmath28 .",
    "we only consider primary objects ( @xmath29 ) with point source morphology ( @xmath30 ) , that were also targeted as primary science objects ( @xmath31 ) .",
    "this yields a sample of 7128 quasars .    of these 7128 quasars , 684 ( 9.6% )",
    "have radio identifications in the first survey down to the 1 mjy flux density limit .",
    "one issue that could affect the derived radio luminosities of the qsos in our sample is that a fraction of them present a truly extended frii - like morphology , and the total radio flux is distributed over many components .",
    "the exclusion of such structures might lead to an underestimation of the total radio luminosity .",
    "we visually examined nvss / first radio maps of the 678 qso with first detections and added the nvss fluxes of the associated component(s ) , if present , or of the first component(s ) when no nvss source was found in the nearby . for some radio",
    "qso the derived radio luminosities increase by a factor of @xmath42 - 3 .",
    "nevertheless , we note that we repeated the clustering analysis described in section [ sect : clustering_qso ] using only the central ( core ) component flux , and we verified that this has no significant influence on any of our results .    according to convention , we define radio - loud quasars as those with total integrated 1.4  ghz radio power ( after adding all associated components ) above @xmath32  w  hz@xmath2 . with this definition , there are 307 radio - loud quasars in our sample .",
    "we consider objects below this luminosity ( or non - detections ) as radio - quiet quasars .    )",
    "corresponding to radio - loud agns ( red ) , and to qsos detected down to 1  mjy in the first survey ( blue ) .",
    "the vertical line at 10@xmath33  w  hz@xmath2 marks the adopted threshold between radio - quiet and radio - loud qsos ( dotted ) .",
    "also shown is the ratio of the number of radio - loud quasars relative to radio agn ( scale on the right axis ) .",
    "bottom : distribution of black hole mass ( m@xmath34 ) for radio - loud agns and radio - loud qsos.,width=317 ]      @xcite have derived virial black hole mass estimates for sdss  dr5 quasars .",
    "these are based on h@xmath35 , mgii , and civ emission lines , and the continuum luminosities around these lines .",
    "we adopt these estimates for our quasar sample ( at @xmath36 , these are mostly derived from h@xmath35 ) . for rlagn we adopted the relation between black hole mass - bulge mass derived by @xcite , m@xmath37m@xmath38 , where we replace m@xmath38 by the stellar mass of the galaxy .",
    "at the lower end of our galaxy mass distribution ( @xmath39 ) , use of the stellar mass instead of the bulge mass may cause the black hole mass to be overestimated by a factor of @xmath40 .",
    "we note that the majority of rlagn in our sample are more massive than this .    for reference , figure",
    "[ fig : dist_all ] shows the radio luminosity and black hole mass distributions derived for all the radio - loud agn and radio - loud qso in our samples . in the upper panel , we also plot the ratio of the number of rlqsos to rlagn and show that this increases from @xmath41 at @xmath32  w  hz@xmath2 up to @xmath42 at @xmath43  w  hz@xmath2 .",
    "this is broadly consistent with the results of @xcite who found similar relative proportions between broad - lined and narrow - lined 3cr sources .",
    "one scenario that has been introduced to explain this varying fraction ( at least at luminosities where the relative numbers of rlqso and rlagn are similar ) is the receeding torus model ( e.g. @xcite ) , in which the inner radius of the obscuring torus ( which is identified with the dust sublimation radius ) scales with luminosity as @xmath44 .",
    "this model predicts that a larger fraction of more luminous objects are classified as quasars .",
    "a standard way to characterize the clustering of galaxies is with the two - point correlation function @xmath45 , which measures the excess in the numbers of pairs with separation @xmath46 in a volume @xmath47 , respect to a random distribution with the same mean number density of objects @xmath48 ( @xcite ) .",
    "this can be expressed as @xmath49dv^{2}\\ ] ] objects are said to be clustered if @xmath50 .",
    "the amplitude and shape of the correlation function yield a variety of different information . on scales larger than a few mpc , the amplitude is a measure of the mass of dark matter halos that the galaxies inhabit ( e.g. @xcite ) . on intermediate scales ,",
    "the shape of the correlation function is sensitive to how galaxies are distributed within their halos ( @xcite ) , while at scales smaller than a few hundred kpc it probes processes such as mergers or interactions ( @xcite ) .",
    "several estimators for the ( auto)correlation function have been proposed in the literature . in this work",
    "we calculate the auto - correlation function of the lrgs using the estimator of @xcite , @xmath51^{2 } } - 1\\ ] ] where @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 refers to the normalized number of ( lrg - lrg ) , ( random - random ) , and ( lrg - random ) pairs as function of the spatial separation @xmath46 ( see the next section for details about the construction of the random sample ) .    to estimate the cross - correlation function of radio - loud agn or quasars with the megaz - lrg galaxy sample , we count the number of lrgs around each agn or quasar as a function of distance , and divide by the expected number of pairs for a random distribution , @xmath55 where @xmath56 stands for the number of ( rlagn / qso - lrg ) pairs , @xmath57 is the number of ( rlagn / qso - random ) pairs , and the quantities have been normalized by the number of objects in the lrg and random catalogues .",
    "the advantage of our procedure is that it does not require full knowledge of the qso or rlagn selection function .",
    "only the lrg selection function is needed for the construction of the random sample , and this is well quantified .",
    "another reason for calculating cross - correlations rather than auto - correlations , is that it allows us to overcome shot noise when the sample size is small .",
    "we note that the lrg sample ( @xmath58 in the notation above ) remains fixed throughout this work .",
    "the error bars of the auto and cross - correlation functions are calculated via statistical bootstrapping by drawing @xmath59 random samples with replacement .",
    "in practice , photometric redshift errors as well as distortions due to peculiar velocities along the line of sight will introduce systematic effects in our estimate of @xmath45 .",
    "therefore , to recover real - space clustering properties we decompose @xmath60 in two directions , along the line of sight ( @xmath61 ) and perpendicular to it ( @xmath62 ) .",
    "integrating over the @xmath61-direction allows to define the projected two - point cross - correlation function @xmath63 , a quantity that is independent of such distortions ( @xcite ) .",
    "a detailed description of the method can be found in @xcite .      the random sample used in estimating",
    "the cross - correlation function should have the same selection effects as the observed galaxies .",
    "we follow the method by @xcite : we take observed lrg sample inside the coverage mask of sdss dr4 and randomly re - assign the sky coordinates of each galaxy .",
    "all other quantities such as like redshift , stellar mass and luminosity are kept fixed . because the survey covers a very wide area ( @xmath246000  deg@xmath64 for sdss dr4 ) , this procedure is sufficient to remove any coherence in the radial direction and it ensures that the geometry of the random catalogues are exactly the same as the real one , and that all redshift - dependent selection effects are accounted for .",
    "we generate n=10 random samples in this way .",
    "it is well known that the clustering amplitude of galaxies varies as a function of mass , luminosity and redshift .",
    "radio agn are usually hosted by very massive , @xmath65 galaxies ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . to take this into account , we select control samples of radio - quiet megaz - lrg galaxies with redshifts , stellar masses and absolute magnitudes that closely match the radio agn sample . for each rlagn we randomly select 10 radio - quiet lrg ( or 5 , depending on the number of available candidates ) within a tolerance of @xmath66 in redshift , @xmath67 in log stellar mass , and @xmath68 in absolute magnitude , where @xmath69 is the extinction and k - corrected @xmath70-band absolute magnitude .",

    "this is shown in figure  [ fig : cc_mzrad ] , where it can easily be appreciated that rlagn are significantly more clustered than the lrg population on all spatial scales .",
    "the two terms of the clustering signal , corresponding to galaxies within the same halo ( 1-halo ) and in different halos ( 2-halo ) , are clearly visible with the transition occurring around 1  mpc  @xmath17 .",
    "the boost in clustering signal exhibited by the rlagn is significantly stronger on scales less than 1  mpc  @xmath17 , which tells us that rlagn must occupy special positions within their dark matter halos .",
    "we intend to model this in more detail in upcoming work .     between radio - loud agn and megaz luminous red galaxies ( red , solid ) in the range 0.3 to 30 mpc  @xmath17 .",

    "the ratio between the cross - correlations @xmath63 corresponding to rlagn and its corresponding control radio - quiet sample , is plotted in the bottom panel .",
    "this proves that the probability of a galaxy to become radio - loud depends on environment as well as on black hole or galaxy mass .       between radio - loud agn and megaz luminous red galaxies ( red ) in the range 0.3 to 30 mpc  @xmath17 .",

    "as expected , more massive radio galaxies are more strongly clustered on all scales . when compared to control galaxies , both subsamples",

    "@xcite argue that the confining effect of a dense intracluster medium reduces the adiabatic loses of radio lobes , leading to higher levels of synchrotron emission .",
    "thus , a dense environment may provide a more effective ` working surface ' for the lobes , giving rise to the positive correlation between small - scale clustering amplitude and radio luminosity observed in figure  [ fig : fitlogp_ragn ] for sources with log(p@xmath85[w hz@xmath2])@xmath90 . alternatively ,",
    "higher radio luminosities in denser environments may be a result of increased jet powers resulting from the higher cooling rates in these denser regions . why does the clustering amplitude drop for radio sourceswith luminosities higher than this value ? as we will argue in the next section ,",
    "a radio luminosity of log(p@xmath85[w  hz@xmath2])@xmath89 may mark the beginning of a transition to a population of agn that are more similar to the quasars , which as we will show , are significantly less clustered that the rlagn .      in this section ,",

    "@xcite analyzed the clustering of radio - loud and radio - quiet quasars in sdss dr5 at @xmath96 and found that radio quasars cluster more strongly than radio - quiet quasars with the same black hole masses . as we will show in section 4.2.1 .",

    "we note that @xcite also found little difference between the environments of radio - loud and radio - quiet quasars over roughly the same redshift range as that probed in this study .",
    "we conclude , therefore , that powerful radio galaxies appear to be hosted by very massive halos , more massive than their quasar counterparts . in principle , this suggests that the unification scheme for the two classes of agn is not as straightforward as first thought , and additional parameters other than orientation are required to explain the difference between rlagn and rlqsos .",

    "radio - loud agn are also more strongly clustered than radio - quiet galaxies of the same stellar mass and redshift .",
    "the clustering differences are largest on scales less than 1  mpc  @xmath17 . * radio - loud agn hosted by",
    "more massive galaxies are more strongly clustered than those hosted by less massive galaxies",
    ". however , the clustering _ difference _ between rlagn and control samples of radio - quiet galaxies is most pronounced for rlagn in low mass hosts .",
    "* we study the dependence of the clustering amplitude on the luminosity of the radio source . for @xmath107",
    "mpc  @xmath17 there is a weak , but significant anti - correlation with radio power . for @xmath108  mpc  @xmath17",
    "the dependence of clustering amplitude on luminosity is more complex : the cross - correlation amplitude increases with luminosity up to @xmath109  w  hz@xmath2 , and then decreases for the most luminous radio sources in our sample .",
    "* we have compared the environments of radio - loud agn and radio - loud qsos .",
    "rlagn are clustered more strongly than rlqsos on all scales , indicate that they populate dark matter halos of different mass .",
    "these results hold even when the rlagn and rlqso samples are matched in radio luminosity and black hole mass .",
    "* there are indications that the very most luminous rlagn and rlqsos in our sample ( p@xmath110  w  hz@xmath2 ) do have similar clustering amplitudes . only at these very high radio powers",
    "are the space - densities of radio - loud quasars and radio galaxies similar .",
    "this implies that unification of the two agn populations can only be valid above p@xmath111  w  hz@xmath2 .",
    "one major limitation of this study with regard to constraining agn unification scenarios , is that it is based purely on photometric data from the sdss , so we are unable to split our rlagn sample into high - excitation and low - excitation sources .",
    "it is quite possible that the presence or absence of emission lines will provide the best way to define a population of radio galaxies that are clearly unified with the quasars . in this case",
    ", we would expect to find that the high - excitation radio galaxy population would cluster in a similar way to the quasars .",
    "in addition , we note that because the parent sample of our rlagn catalogue consists of luminous _ red _ galaxies , it is also likely that we completely miss some number of rlagn with bluer colors and stronger emission lines .",
    "the analysis of the rlagn luminosity function presented in @xcite indicates that the missing sources can not constitute more than @xmath420% of the total rlagn population , so will not dominate the clustering signal of the radio agn population as a whole .",
    "nevertheless the quasar analogues among the radio galaxy population may still be under - represented in our analysis .",
    "fortunately , upcoming large spectroscopic surveys such as boss will target nearly complete samples of more than a million massive galaxies at @xmath20 and will provide optical spectra for tens of thousands of radio galaxies",
    ". we will then be able to quantify the fraction of rlagn of given radio luminosity that have emission lines and how the clustering depends on emission line strength .",
    "the most definitive result to emerge from our analysis is clear proof that the environment of a galaxy on the scale of the dark matter halo in which it resides ( i.e. on scales of @xmath41  mpc  @xmath17 and below ) , does play a key role in determining not only the probability that a galaxy a is radio - loud agn , but also the total luminosity of the radio jet . combining our results with those of @xcite",
    ", we conclude that both black hole mass and environment must determine the radio - loud character of an active galaxy .",
    "our previous work also demonstrated that strong evolution of the radio agn population only occurs above a characteristic radio luminosity of @xmath112  w  hz@xmath2 ( @xcite ) .",
    "it is very intriguing that the results in this paper indicate that this luminosity marks the break point in clustering trends , and that the radio luminosity where denser environment ceases to have a boosting influence also is of order @xmath32  w  hz@xmath2 .",
    "finally , the strong evolution of the radio source population at radio luminosities above @xmath112  w  hz@xmath2 combined with the strong clustering of this population , must imply that the heating rate of the gas in groups and clusters of galaxies is higher at redshifts @xmath3 than it is at the present day .",
