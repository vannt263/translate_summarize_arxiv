    "on the one hand , gold is the leader in the precious metal markets and is considered as an investment asset .",

    "* ) and a hedge against inflation ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; consequently it is used as a fundamental investment strategy ( see * ? ? ?",
    "on the other hand , crude oil is the main source of energy and is also used as an investment asset .",
    "therefore , investors often include one of the two commodities gold and crude oil or both in their investment portfolios as a diversification strategy ( see * ? ? ?",
    "there seems to be a close relationship between the price movements of the two commodity markets , but there is no consensus on the direction of the influence .",
    "@xcite , @xcite and @xcite found that gold prices respond significantly to changes in oil prices .",
    "however , there are some authors such as @xcite and @xcite that argue that oil and gold prices affect each other .",
    "@xcite pointed out the four mechanisms through which crude oil and gold ( seen as an investment asset ) are linked : a ) the increase in oil prices leads to inflationary pressures ( see , e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) that induces gold prices to increase since gold is seen as a hedge against inflation ; b )  high oil prices have a negative impact on economic growth ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and asset values ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which gives rise to an increase in gold price since it is seen as an alternative asset to store value ;  c ) higher oil prices have a positive effect on revenues in net oil exporting countries , which increases their investment in gold to maintain its share in the diversified portfolios and , consequently , gold price increases due to higher gold demand ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ;  and",
    "d ) when the us dollar depreciates oil prices rise ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and investors may use gold as a safe haven .",
    "given that oil and gold are used as investment asset , they are closely related to the evolution of stock market indices since any influence on decisions about investment portfolios affects the stock market returns ( see * ? ? ?",
    "the relationship between changes in oil prices and stock market indices has been widely studied .",
    "authors such as @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite found that an oil price increase has a negative impact on stock returns in oil importing countries , while @xcite and @xcite found a positive impact of oil price increases on the stock market in oil exporting countries .",
    "however , there are fewer authors who have analyzed how gold prices affect stock market indices , and vice versa .",
    "@xcite@xmath0 studied the relationship between gold prices and the us stock price indices over the 1991 - 2001 period .",
    "he considered four gold prices ( three set in london : 10.30 a.m. fixing , 3 p.m. fixing , and closing time ; and one set in new york : handy & harmon ) and six stock price indices ( the dow jones industrial average , nasdaq , the new york stock exchange , standard and poor s 500 , russell 3000 , and  wilshire 5000 ) and showed evidence of a short - run relationship , but not a long - run link .",
    "he also found evidence of feedback between gold price set in the afternoon fixing and us  stock price indices by using linear granger causality test , but unidirectional causality from us  stock price indices to gold price set in the morning fixing and closing time .",
    "@xcite analyzed the causal link between gold prices and indian stock market returns , showing the bidirectional granger - causality .",
    "the study of the link between the two commodity markets ( crude oil and gold ) and the stock market indices is of interest to policymakers since the movements in the stock market has an important influence on macroeconomic variables development . to the best of our knowledge",
    ", there is no study in the related literature that analyzes the relationships between crude oil , gold and stock markets for the largest economy in the world , the us .",
    "the contribution of this paper is to extend the literature on the relationships between the crude oil and gold markets and the standards and poor s 500 index by analyzing the direction of the causality and by considering data from the great moderation onwards .",
    "to do so , we apply the nonlinear granger causality test for the full sample and for different subsamples in order to analyze the sensitivity of the results to the use of different sample periods .",
    "additionally , we perform the nonlinear granger causality test for windows of one natural year from 1986 up to 2014 to investigate the causal link within each specific year .",
    "the paper is structured as follows .",
    "section [ sec : data ] describes the data and the methodology .",
    "section [ sec : results ] presents the results and discussion .",
    "section [ sec : conclusions ] concludes .",
    "the empirical sample used for the present study consists of standard and poor s 500 daily adjusted closing price ( sp500 ) , west texas intermediate crude oil spot price ( wti ) and gold bullion lbm us / troy ounce ( gold ) from january 2nd , 1986 to february 5th , 2015 , with a total of 7351 observations .",
    "all data are available from _ bloomberg_. these dates were chosen in order to capture different economic moments in the relationships between the series .",
    ", ( left ) and returns , @xmath1 , ( right ) for sp500 ( top ) , wti ( middle ) and gold ( bottom ) . ]",
    "prices were transformed into series of continuously compounded percentage returns by taking the first differences of the natural logarithm of the prices , i.e. @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the price on day @xmath4 .",
    "we denote the return time series for sp500 , wti and gold by sp500r , wtir and goldr , respectively .",
    "figure [ fig : prices_returns ] shows the behavior of the prices and returns for each series .",
    "table [ tab : stats ] presents the descriptive statistics of the return time series .",
    "the statistics are consistent , as expected , with some of the stylized facts of financial and economic time series ( see * ? ? ?",
    "in particular , the kurtosis indicates that return distributions are leptokurtic .",
    "moreover , the @xcite statistic confirms returns are not normally distributed .",
    ".descriptive statistics of the return time series [ cols=\"<,>,>,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     note : one , two and three asterisks mean a @xmath5-value less than 10% , 5% and 1% , respectively .",
    "the null hypothesis is that @xmath6 does not granger cause @xmath7 ( i.e. , @xmath8 ) . denoting sp500r , wtir and goldr as @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 , respectively .",
    "even though the dp test is run considering different lags ( @xmath12 ) , it is only reported for each sample the lowest significance level ( * , * * or * * * ) for the cases in which causality appears at every lag considered .",
    "if no asterisk appears for a particular sample , it means that the causality may exist at some specific lag but not at all possible lags considered .",
    "tables [ tab : dp - up ] and [ tab : dp - down ] also indicate the rejection of the null hypothesis when the returns of the gold and stock markets are considered , showing so a bidirectional causality for almost all subsamples and confirming the results obtained for the full sample .",
    "additionally , these tables reveal the feedback relationship between the crude oil and gold markets when the sample starts in january 2 , 1986 and ends in the last available observation of any year beyon 1991 .",
    "however , a unilateral granger causality was found from oil price changes to gold price changes when the sample starts in the first available observation of any year between the mid-1990s and 2001 and ends in february 5 , 2015 .",
    "this may explain why some authors ( see , e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) find a unilateral causality .    finally , table [ tab : dp - year ] reports the results of the dp test for windows of one natural year from 1986 up to 2014 , although these results have to be considered with caution since the dp test is an asymptotic test .",
    "table [ tab : dp - year ] shows no evidence of a causality within most of the years considered .",
    "the main exception to this is for the years 2008 and 2009 ( the period of global financial crisis ) , where the three markets appear interrelated .",
    "these causal relationships might be due to the fact that gold is considered a safe haven for investors in times of financial crisis and economic instability and also due to investors seeking refuge on gold and other commodities such as oil and energy derivatives after the collapse of the real state market .",
    "this paper provides new evidence on a nonlinear causal link among the three markets considered ( with the causality going in all directions ) for the full sample , for subsamples starting in january 2 , 1986 and ending in the last available observation of any year beyond 1991 and for subsamples starting in the first available observation of any year beyond 1987 and ending in february 5 , 2015 .",
    "the only exception to this is the existence of a nonlinear unidirectional causal relationship between the crude oil and gold market ( with the causality only going from oil price changes to gold price changes ) for subsamples that going from the first date of any year between the mid-1990s and 2001 to february 5 , 2015 .",
    "therefore , the causality between the price movements of the crude oil and gold markets seems highly dependent on the sample used , which may explain the contradictory results found in the related literature .",
    "the causal link found among the three markets implies that changes in the s&p s 500 index may be monitored by observing changes in the returns of the two commodity markets considered ( and vice versa ) , which is valuable for policymakers",
