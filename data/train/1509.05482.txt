    "the main goal of relativistic heavy - ion collisions is to create the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) and study its properties . due to their small hadronic cross sections , multi - strange hadrons , such as @xmath2 and @xmath3 , experience early chemical and thermal freeze - out after hadronization  @xcite .",
    "their anisotropy flow are mainly developed in the qgp phase and less contaminated by the hadronic evolution , which are expected to provide valuable information for the qgp . in our early paper",
    "@xcite , the spectra and elliptic flow of strange and multi - strange hadrons at the lhc have been studied with vishnu hybrid model .",
    "this proceeding will extend the calculations to top rhic energies and compare the results with recent star data .",
    "hybrid model  @xcite combines ( 2 + 1)-d relativistic viscous hydrodynamics ( vish2 + 1 )  @xcite for the qgp fluid expansion with a microscopic hadronic transport model(urqmd )  @xcite for the hadron resonance gas evolution .",
    "the hydrodynamic simulations input an equation of state ( eos ) s95p - pce constructed from recent lattice qcd data  @xcite .",
    "the transition from hydrodynamics to the hadron cascade is controlled by a switching temperature which is set at 165 mev .",
    "we input smooth initial conditions that are generated from mc - glauber model through averaging a large number of fluctuating initial entropy density profiles ( here , each initial density distribution is recenterd and rotated to align the major and minor axes before averaging , which is called as _ initialization in the participant plane _ )  @xcite .",
    "following  @xcite , we set the initial time @xmath7 , the specific shear viscosity @xmath8 and specific bulk viscosity @xmath9",
    ". the normalization factor of the the initial entropy density profiles is tuned to reproduce the final charged hadron multiplicity in the most central au+au collisions at @xmath10=200 gev  @xcite .",
    "these inputs and settings once nicely described the @xmath11 spectra and differential elliptic flow for all charged hadron and for pions and protons in 200 a gev au+au collisions .",
    "the @xmath0-spectra and elliptic flow of pions and protons in 200 a au+au collisions have been studied with vishnu hybrid model in our early paper  @xcite .",
    "we showed that , with mc - glauber initial conditions , @xmath12 and @xmath13 , vishnu nicely describes these low @xmath11 data of pions and protons at various centrality bins .",
    "figure  [ fig : ptlxo ] presents transverse momentum spectra of @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 in 200 a gev au+au collisions   spectra has been corrected with the feed - down contributions from weak decays .",
    "@xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 from vishnu are final hadrons after collisions and strong resonance decays since the urqmd hadronic evolution does not contain any weak decay channels . ] . in general",
    ", vishnu describes the @xmath0-spectra of @xmath1 and @xmath2 , but slightly over - predicts the production of @xmath3 for all centrality bins . in spite of the normalization issues",
    ", vishnu nicely fits the slope of the @xmath0-spectra for @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 at various centralities .",
    "together with the early nice descriptions of the @xmath0-spectra for pions , kaons and protons  @xcite , it indicates that vishnu generates a proper amount of radial flow during the qgp and hadronic evolution at the top rhic energy .    ,",
    "@xmath2 and @xmath3 in 200 a gev au+au collisions .",
    "experimental data are from star  @xcite , theoretical curves are calculated from vishnu with the same inputs as for fig .",
    "[ fig : ptlxo ] .",
    "[ fig : v2lxo ] ]    figure  [ fig : v2lxo ] shows the differential elliptic flow of @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 in 200 a gev au+au collisions .",
    "the theoretical curves are calculated from vishnu using smooth initial conditions from mc - glauber ( with an average in participant plane ) .",
    "the star data are measured by the event plane method  @xcite , which contain the contributions from event - by - event fluctuations and the non - flow effects . to account the fluctuation contributions",
    ", we divide the flow data by @xmath14 and the theoretical results by @xmath15 , where the exponent @xmath16 depends on the event - plane resolution @xmath17 and details of the @xmath18 extraction method  @xcite .",
    "the detail values of @xmath14 and @xmath15 can be found in  @xcite .",
    "our past research has shown that vishnu nicely fits the elliptic flow for all charged hadrons and for identified hadrons @xmath4 and @xmath6 in 200 a gev au+au collisions with mc - glauber , @xmath12 and @xmath13  @xcite . with the same inputs , we extend the vishnu calculations for the strange and multi - strange hadrons with high statistical simulations .",
    "2 shows that , vishnu generally fits the elliptic flow of @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 in 200 a gev au+au collisions . for 0 - 10% centrality ,",
    "the vishnu results are slightly above the data for all three hadrons .",
    "it is worthwhile to mention that , for 2.76 a tev pb+pb collisions , early vishnu calculations also slightly over - predict the elliptic flow of @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 at 10 - 20% and 30 - 40% centralities .",
    "in fact , the urqmd simulations in vishnu assigns small cross - sections to @xmath2 and @xmath3 , leading to an early decoupling of these two hadrons . compared with pure hadronic simulations  @xcite ,",
    "this leads to an insufficient development of elliptic flow for these two multi - strange hadrons in central and semi - central collisions at top rhic and the lhc energies .",
    "it is generally believed that the mass ordering of elliptic flow among various identified hadrons reflects the interplay between radial and elliptic flows , providing more information on the qgp fireball evolution .",
    "figure 3 presents the mass ordering of differential elliptic flow among @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 in minimum bias au+au collisions .",
    "compared with the star measurements , vishnu correctly describes the @xmath19 mass ordering among @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 , and @xmath3 , but fails to reproduce the mass ordering of @xmath1 and @xmath2 . in our early investigations  @xcite",
    ", a similar situation was found in 2.76 a tev pb+pb collisions at 10 - 20% and 40 - 50% centralities .",
    "although vishnu correctly generates the @xmath19 mass ordering among @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 , it slightly under - predicts the proton @xmath19 at lower transverse momentum .",
    "together with the slightly over - perditions of the @xmath1 and @xmath2 data , this leads to an inverse @xmath19 mass - ordering among @xmath6 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "the effects from the initial flow or improved urqmd hadronic cross - sections may solve this issue within the framework of vishnu , which should be investigated in the near future .",
    "in this proceeding , we present vishnu calculations on the soft hadron data of strange and multi - strange hadrons in 200 a gev au+au collisions . with the parameter settings used in our early calculations ,",
    "vishnu generally describes the @xmath0-spectra and elliptic flow of @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 for various centrality bins .",
    "we also compare the @xmath19 mass ordering among @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 with the star measurements and find that vishnu correctly describes the @xmath19 mass ordering among @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 , and @xmath3 , but fails to reproduce the mass ordering among @xmath6 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 .    , @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 in minimal bias au+au collisions .",
