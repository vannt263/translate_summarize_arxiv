    "one of the oldest - and simplest - techniques for estimating the mass density of the universe is the mass - to - light method . in this method , the average ratio of the observed mass to light of the largest possible systems is used ; assuming it is a fair sample , it can then be multiplied by the total luminosity density of the universe to yield the universal mass density . when the method is applied to rich clusters of galaxies  the largest virilized systems for which a mass has been reliably determined  the total mass density of the universe adds up to only @xmath2(where @xmath3 is the mass density in units of the critical density ) ( zwicky 1957 , abell 1965 , ostriker , peebles & yahil 1974 , bahcall 1977 , faber & gallagher 1979 , trimble 1987 , peebles 1993 , bahcall , lubin & dorman 1995 , carlberg _ et al .",

    "if the mass - to - light ratio of clusters is larger or smaller than the universal mean , then the resulting @xmath5 will be an over- or under- estimate , respectively .",
    "it is not clear whether this classic assumption of an unbiased representation by clusters is correct . more generally , if mass follows light ( i.e. , galaxies ) on large scales  thus @xmath6 constant  the galaxy distribution is considered to be unbiased with respect to mass ; if mass is distributed more broadly than light , as is generally believed , then the galaxy distribution is biased ( i.e. , more clustered ) with respect to mass , and the above determination of @xmath3 is an underestimate .",
    "we investigate these questions of cluster representation and bias , and the impact they have on the measurement of @xmath3 .",
    "observations of galaxies , groups and clusters of galaxies suggest that @xmath4 increases as a function of scale up to scales of hundreds of kiloparsecs ( schwarzschild 1954 , rubin & ford 1970 , roberts & rots 1973 , ostriker _",

    "we normally interpret this fact as indicating that luminous galaxies are more concentrated in peak density regions than the dark matter because baryons are dissipational .",
    "the shape and amplitude of the mass - to - light function  that is , the dependence of @xmath4 on scale , @xmath8  can place powerful constraints on the amount and distribution of dark matter in the universe , as well as on the amount of bias and its dependence on scale .",
    "the @xmath4 function thus provides a direct , model - independent census of the total mass density of the universe .    what is the expected dependence of @xmath4 on scale ? in this paper we investigate this question using large - scale , high resolution hydrodynamic cosmological simulations that contain dark matter and gas , and compare the results with observations .",
    "we find an excellent agreement between models and observations in the shape of the @xmath4 function ; both data and models show an increase on small scales ( hundreds of kpc ) and a flattened @xmath8 distribution on large scales .",
    "we use the comparison between data and simulations to determine the mass density of the universe .",
    "the amount of bias and its dependence on scale are also revealed .",
    "we find that clusters of galaxies are mildly _ antibiased , _ in the sense that mass is more concentrated than light on average .",
    "previous determinations of @xmath9 using clusters of galaxies have thus _ overestimated _ @xmath3 due to this unaccounted antibias .",
    "the present investigation attempts to provide an unbiased determination of @xmath9 using , for the first time , the entire observed mass - to - light function .",
    "the above results do not disagree with previous estimates that the mass density of galaxies is unbiased or positively biased with respect to the total mass density in the high density regions ; it is the light density that is shown here to be antibiased .",
    "the observed mass - to - light ratio of galaxies , groups and clusters as a function of scale , @xmath10 , is taken from bahcall , lubin and dorman ( 1995 , hereafter bld ) . in these data ,",
    "masses are determined using different methods including velocity dispersion , gravitational lensing , and x - ray gas temperature .",

    "as does the @xmath0 ratio for the luminous parts of typical @xmath15 elliptical and spiral galaxies ( see bld for details ) .",
    "more recent observations of rich clusters from the cnoc cluster survey ( carlberg _ et al .",
    "1996 , 1997 _ ) yield consistent results . based on the available data ,",
    "bld find that the @xmath0 ratio of galaxy systems increases linearly with scale up to the scale of very large galactic halos ( @xmath16mpc ) , but then flattens on larger scales ; they suggest that @xmath0 does not increase significantly with scale beyond @xmath17mpc . furthermore ,",
    "bld show that @xmath0 of elliptical galaxies is approximately three times larger than that of spirals ( at the same radius ) ; both increase linearly with scale up to @xmath18mpc .",
    "the total mass of groups and clusters can then be accounted for by the combined mass of their elliptical and spiral galaxy members , including their large halos , plus the intracluster gas .",
    "the large halos are likely to be stripped off in the dense environments of clusters , but their mass still remains in the clusters .",
    "observations of weak gravitational lensing by foreground galaxies using the sloan digital sky survey ( fischer _ et al_. 1999 ) find consistent results indicating large halos around galaxies .",
    "recently , the first determination of the mass and mass - to - light ratio of a large supercluster ( @xmath19mpc ) , ms0302 , was obtained using weak gravitational lensing ( kaiser _ _ et al.__1999 ) .",
    "the mass and @xmath0 ratio of three individual clusters in the supercuster as well as the mass and @xmath0 of the supercluster itself were all determined from the weak lensing observations .",
    "the results show , quite remarkably , the _ same _ @xmath0 ratio for both the individual clusters and the large supercluster ( @xmath20 and @xmath21 , respectively ) thus directly confirming a flat @xmath10 function on large scales , as suggested by bld .",
    "this new supercluster result is added in the figures below ( converted to our standard l@xmath11 system by adding the 30% contribution to the luminosity from spiral galaxies ( kaiser _ et al .",
    "_ 1999 ) , correcting for passive luminosity evolution from @xmath22 to @xmath23 following @xmath24 , and correcting for internal extinction ( @xmath2510% ; bld ) ; the net correction factor is 1@xmath260.2 ) .",
    "we also show ( for illustration only ) the @xmath0 ratio determined from the least action method at @xmath27mpc by tully , shaya and peebles ( 1994 ) and the observed range of virgo infall measurements ( see bld ) . while these provide less direct measures of mass than the supercluster weak lensing result ( and are thus not included in our fits ) , they are all consistent with each other and with the observed flattening of @xmath0 with scale .",
    "the data are presented in the figures below .",
    "we investigate the expected behavior of @xmath0 as a function of scale using two sets of cosmological simulations which include both dark matter and gas : a large - scale , @xmath28mpc box simulation to study the large - scale behavior of @xmath0 , and a smaller , higher resolution simulation with a box size of @xmath29mpc , to investigate smaller scales .",
    "the large - scale hydrodynamic simulation , described by cen and ostriker ( 1999 ) , uses the shock - capturing total variation diminishing method on a cartesian grid for gas dynamics ( ryu _ et al , _ 1993 ) .",
    "a particle - mesh ( pm ) code is used for dark matter particles .",
    "an fft is used to solve poisson s equation .",
    "in addition , the code accounts for cooling processes including metal cooling and heating and incorporates a heuristic galaxy formation scheme described by cen and ostriker ( 1999 ) ( see also below ) .",
    "the cosmological model used is a flat cold - dark - matter ( cdm ) model , with mass density @xmath30 cosmologial constant density @xmath31 baryon density @xmath32 and a hubble constant @xmath33 ( where @xmath34 kms s@xmath35mpc@xmath35 ) .",
    "a power - spectrum slope of @xmath36 and normalization @xmath37 ( the mass rms fluctuations on @xmath38mpc scale at @xmath39 ) were used , consistent with the cluster abundance normalization and the cobe microwave background fluctuations ( white _ et al .",

    "a periodic box of @xmath28mpc on a side is used , with @xmath40 fluid cells and @xmath41 dark matter particles .",
    "the dark matter mass resolution is @xmath42 and the grid cell size is @xmath43mpc .",
    "we consider only scales with radii @xmath44mpc in this simulation , which is considerably larger than the cell size ; on these scales , the relevant gravitational and hydrodynamical physics are accurately computed . on smaller scales",
    "we use the smaller , higher - resolution simulation described below .",
    "galaxies are `` identified '' in the simulation by the procedure described in cen and ostriker ( 1999 ) : if a cell s mass is higher than the jean s mass , and if the cooling time of the gas in it is shorter than its dynamical time , and if the flow around the cell is converging , then it will have stars forming inside that cell .",
    "the code turns the baryonic fluid component into collisionless stellar particles ( `` galaxy particles '' ) at a rate proportional to @xmath45 , where @xmath46 is the mass of gas in the cell and @xmath47 is the local dynamical time .",
    "these galaxy particles subsequently contribute to metal production , sn energy feedback and the background ionizing uv radiation .",
    "this algorithm is essentially the same as in cen and ostriker ( 1992 ) and also used by katz , hernquist and weinberg ( 1996 ) , gnedin ( 1996 ) and steinmetz ( 1996 ) .",
    "the masses of the galaxy particles range from @xmath48 to @xmath49 ; thus many galaxy particles are contained in a single luminous galaxy in the real universe .",
    "rather than group the particles into galaxies , we simply use the galaxy particles themselves , which makes the results less dependent on resolution .",
    "luminosities ( in the relevant bands ) are assigned to each cell following the bruzual and charlot ( 1993 , 1998 ; hereafter bc ) model ; we use their instantaneous star - formation model , which best fits observations ( nagamine , cen & ostriker 1999 ) .",
    "we also analyze our results using other bc models ; the main conclusions are insensitive to the specific star - formation model used .",
    "the luminosities determined for each cell are summed over the galaxy particles in the cell and evolve with time as given by the bc model .",
    "the simulated luminosities are in excellent agreement with the observed luminosity density in the universe at different redshifts ( nagamine , cen & ostriker 1999 ; see also below ) .    with the above information we can now determine the mass - to - light ratio , @xmath0 ( where @xmath50 is the light in the blue band ) at different locations in the simulation volume and",
    "study it as a function of scale . in order to minimize possible uncertainties due to model luminosities ,",
    "we normalize all luminosities - and thus @xmath0 - to the _ observed _ luminosity density of the universe , as discussed below ; this ensures that our results are largely independent of the specific luminosity model used .",
    "the behavior of @xmath0 on small scales is determined in a similar manner using smaller ( @xmath29mpc box ) , higher - resolution ( @xmath51kpc ) tree sph simulations ( see dave _ et al .",
    "this simulation uses a similar cosmological model ( @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 ) ; the small difference between the models is adjusted in the final normalization of @xmath0 , but is insignificant .",
    "an @xmath56 cdm model , tilted with @xmath57 , is also investigated using this simulation size .",
    "galaxies are identified using skid ( see katz , weinberg & hernquist 1996 ) , and luminosities are assigned to each galaxy using the same bc model described above .",
    "the term  bias \" has been used with different explicit and implicit definitions , so it is essential that we be clear . kaiser ( 1984 ) introduced bias as the difference between the amplitude of the correlation function of high density regions ( such as galaxies and clusters ) relative to that of the mass in order to explain the exceptionally strong correlation function observed for rich clusters of galaxies ( bahcall & soneria 1983 , klypin & kopylov 1983 )",
    ". similarly , davis et al . ( 1985 ) introduced bias as the proportionality constant between the observed fluctuations in the number density of galaxies and the mass fluctuations found in simulations : @xmath58 .",
    "since some smoothing scale ( @xmath59 ) must be utilized to calculate either side of the equation , bias must be explicitly a function of scale , @xmath60 .",
    "implicit were observational criteria limiting the counted galaxies to be above a certain luminosity and surface brightness .",
    "if ( and it is a substantial assumption ) one identifies the number density of halos in simulations with the number density of galaxies then good dark matter simulations ( e.g. , jenkins _ et al .",

    "hydrodynamic simulations which seek to identify the site of galaxy formation and estimate the formation rate can compute the mass overdensity in galaxies , @xmath66 , although poor resolution limits their ability to identify individual objects and to compute the galaxy number overdensity @xmath67 .",
    "recent papers by katz _",
    "et al _ ( 1999 ) and cen & ostriker ( 2000 ) find significant positive bias on intermediate scales .",
    "et al _ ( 1999 ) discuss in detail the physical origin of this bias , and its dependence on scale .",
    "einasto et al .",
    "( 1999 ) discuss the physical origin of bias in terms of the fraction of mass that exists in the voids .",
    "semi - analytic \" approach seeks to combine in simplified form elements of the physical approach utilized in the hydrodynamic modelling with the detailed resolution obtainable from pure n - body work and has produced suggestive and most useful comparisons with observations ( cole _ et al .",
    "_ 1994 , kauffmann _ et al .",
    "all of the above work find positive ( but small ) bias on large scales so it is important to understand the sense in which we will identify antibias in this work .",
    "the best way of comparing simulations to observations is neither through @xmath68 nor @xmath66 , but via @xmath69 , where @xmath70 is the light emitted by the galaxies in some band ( here we use @xmath71 in the blue band ) .",
    "we then compare @xmath72 with the same observed quantity ( after correction for obscuration ) .",
    "figure 1 shows in three panels ( for top - hat smoothing scales @xmath73mpc ) the average and the dispersion of @xmath66 and @xmath72 versus the total mass overdensity @xmath74 .",
    "points above the diagonal line are positively biased and those below the line are antibiased .",
    "the @xmath66 curves are similar to those shown in cen & ostriker ( 1992 , 2000 ) as well as blanton _",
    "( 1999 ) and indicate positive bias on all scales in our dense regions ( approaching no bias in the highest density regions on these scales ) , and negative bias ( antibias ) in underdense regions ( i.e. , little or no galaxies in the ` voids ' ) .",
    "but we see that the light density @xmath71 is antibiased , both relatively and absolutely , in the highest density regions at 1.5 , 5 and @xmath75mpc scales : @xmath76 .",
    "the effect is small but real and easily understood . at low redshift",
    "the highest density regions typically represent rich clusters and superclusters ( for large smoothing scales of @xmath77 to @xmath75mpc ) ; the stars and galaxies in such regions tend to be old .",
    "this well - known observational fact is clearly seen in the simulations ( blanton _ et al _ 1999 ; cen & ostriker 2000 ) ; after clusters form ( at @xmath78 ) the member galaxies reside within a hot medium ( @xmath79k ) for which cooling is inefficient and further star formation is inhibited . in such old dense regions massive young blue stars are rare , and the light diminishes sharply with increasing time , especially in the blue .",
    "our bruzual - charlot ( bc ) models , which incorporate standard stellar evolution , thus show relatively low blue light levels in the highest density regions at the present time ; _ the age effect _ overcomes the slight bias to bring the typical values of @xmath80 below @xmath74 and yield a small _ antibias in the highest density regions_. the large amount of intracluster gas in these systems may also contribute to the antibias .    for observers who , in general , have no direct access to the ordinate in figure 1 , @xmath81 , it is interesting to consider the ratio of the bias in the high density regions ( rich clusters and superclusters ) to the bias in the more normal regions where most galaxies live at moderate overdensities .",
    "since these latter have a significant positive bias , the _ relative antibias _ of high density regions as compared to low density regions is a factor of @xmath252 - 4 ( depending on scale ) .",
    "we now turn to the determination of the expected mass - to - light ratio of galaxy systems as a function of scale by investigating @xmath0 for different size volumes in the simulations . in the @xmath28mpc box , we investigate volumes with radii ranging from @xmath82mpc to @xmath83mpc ( the volume - equivalent radius of the full box ) . for each volume of radius @xmath59",
    "we determine the total mass @xmath84 and the total light @xmath50 within the volume , and hence @xmath0 .",
    "the volumes are centered on randomly selected `` galaxies '' in the box , for proper comparison with observations ( i.e. , we center on random cells with total galaxy particle mass exceeding 10@xmath85 or 10@xmath86 m@xmath87 ; the results are insensitive to the specific threshold ) . for a given radius ,",
    "a large number of volumes are selected ; these random volumes represent a wide range of mass overdensities .",
    "rich clusters and superclusters of galaxies populate the highest overdensity regions ( at their respective scales ) , while loose groups and other galactic systems correspond to regions of lower overdensities .",
    "the first questions we ask are : how does @xmath0 depend on scale and on the local overdensity - does it flatten and become constant on large scales ? and , does it vary with overdensity ( at a given scale ) ?    the results are presented in figure 2 , together with the observational data discussed in  2 .",
    "the immediately apparent result is that @xmath8 increases with scale on small scales and flattens on large scales , as seen in the observations .",
    "each of the @xmath10 curves for @xmath88mpc represents the simulation results for the mean of all volumes with overdensity above a given threshold ( at any given scale , as indicated in fig .",
    "the highest overdensities are selected to correspond to observed rich clusters of galaxies ( @xmath89190 and @xmath90 250 at @xmath12mpc , where @xmath91 is the total mass overdensity ; this corresponds approximately to richness class @xmath92 0 and @xmath92 1 clusters ; abell 1958 ) ; these are shown by the top solid and dashed curves .",
    "the lower overdensity regions are presented by the dot - dashed curves ; these are typical for loose groups of galaxies at @xmath82mpc . to illustrate the trend of @xmath10 with overdensity , we scale the density thresholds with radius ( from @xmath93mpc ) assuming a density profile f @xmath94 , as suggested by observations ( e.g. , bahcall 1977 , 1999 , peebles 1993 , carlberg _ et al .",
    "_ 1997 ) ; the results are similar for other reasonable extrapolations .",
    "voids , which contain little or no light ( galaxies ) but do contain some mass , exhibit very large @xmath0 ratios ( e.g. , figure 1 ) ; their contribution is of course included in the total @xmath95 and @xmath9 values discussed below since these values refer to the entire amount of mass in the box .",
    "the solid curve marked @xmath3 = 0.37 represents the mean @xmath0 function for @xmath96 for the @xmath3 = 0.37 simulation ( converted to h = 1 for comparison with the data ) .  the same solid line",
    "is then scaled up and down to @xmath3 = 1 and @xmath3 = 0.16 respectively ( the latter , as shown below , is our best - fit value ) , using linear scaling with @xmath9 , as expected ( see below ) .",
    "the entire set of @xmath10 curves for different overdensities is presented only once , for clarity , for @xmath3 = 0.16 .",
    "the shape of the @xmath10 function is nearly independent of the specific model luminosities used ; all models , including models with different but observationally acceptable initial mass function ( eg . , salpeter 1955 , miller & scalo 1979 , scalo 1986 , for @xmath97 ) , yield essentially the same function shape . in order to be independent of possible uncertainties also in the normalization of the model luminosities ,",
    "we normalize @xmath50 of the entire simulation  and thus @xmath0 of the full box to the _ observed _ luminosity density of the universe . the local luminosity density of the universe ( in total b band luminosity , corrected for extinction )",

    "this effect , as noted in the previous section , is likely caused by the age effect : high density clusters and superclusters are old systems , with low recent star - formation ( and thus lower than average blue luminosity ) ; the old galaxies that dominate these system have significantly reduced luminosities at this late time in their evolution . since all measures of @xmath9 that utilize the @xmath0 method use clusters and superclusters of galaxies",

    "the conservative error - bar used above reflects the scatter among the different measurements as well as their uncertainties .",
    "we thus find @xmath136 the representative @xmath0 value of the universe is @xmath131 = 225 @xmath137 70 , as given by the numerator of ( 4 ) .",
    "a second method of determining @xmath3 is fitting the entire observed @xmath0 function of galaxies , groups , clusters , and superclusters ( ms0302 ) to the simulated function , for the relevant overdensities .",
    "here we use the high @xmath138 band ( fig .",
    "3 ) for rich clusters , the lower bound of this band for the ms0302 supercluster , and the low @xmath139 band for groups ( the upper sub - band is used since it best matches the group overdensities ) .",
    "the small - scale @xmath140mpc band is used for fitting the observed galaxies and small groups of galaxies ( at @xmath141mpc ) .",
    "fitting the observed to simulated @xmath0 function has a single free parameter : @xmath9 ; the best @xmath142 fit yields @xmath3 = 0.16 @xmath137 0.02 .",
    "since the box normalization is fixed at the observed value of @xmath143 , corresponding to @xmath144 (  5 ) , the result is essentially independent of the luminosity models .",
    "the result does depend however on the observed normalization @xmath71 ; therefore @xmath145 ) , or equivalantly , @xmath146 $ ] .",
    "allowing for the normalization uncertainty as well as for uncertainties in the overdensities and in model luminosities , we find @xmath147    this value is consistent with the one obtained earlier using clusters of galaxies alone .",
    "additional systematic uncertainties , while difficult to accurately determine , may contribute an additional @xmath25 20%(@xmath26 0.03 ) to the above uncertainty ( see below ) .",
    "the @xmath0 function for this best - fit value , plotted in fig .",
    "3 , reproduces well the entire observed @xmath0 function , from galaxies to superclusters .",
    "the error - bars given in ( 4,5 ) above may not include all possible systematic uncertainties .",
    "for example , if low surface brightness galaxies contribute significantly to the total luminosity density of the universe ( over and above the extrapolated luminosity function ) , but not to the luminosity in clusters , this will increase @xmath71 ( thus decrease @xmath148 ) from the value used , therefore increasing @xmath3 .",
    "however , if such galaxies exist also in groups , clusters , and superclusters  this effect will cancel out .",
    "the effect , if exists , is expected to be small , and is at least partially covered by the large uncertainty adopted for @xmath71 and @xmath148 .",
    "similarly , a diffuse intracluster light , which may account for @xmath25 15% of the total cluster luminosity ( feldmeier et al .",
    "2000 ) , is not included in the observed cluster luminosity ( it may in fact compensate for the contribution of low surface brightness galaxies in the field ) . if included , this will lower @xmath149 and thus lower @xmath3 ( by @xmath25 15% ) .",
    "systematic uncertainties in the simulations may also contribute  but only if they are scale dependent ( since the overall normalization is independent of the simulations ) .",
    "it is unlikely that significant shape changes exist on the scales considered here . while difficult to accurately determine such possible systematic uncertainties , we estimate that they may contribute an additional @xmath25 20% uncertainty to @xmath3 .",
    "figure 2 and 3 illustrate that the @xmath10 function of high density regions increases with scale to an above - average peak at a clusters - superclusters scale of few mpc , then decreases to the mean universal value .",
    "conversely , low density regions reveal lower @xmath0 values .",
    "this is consistent with observations of rich clusters ( high density ) versus groups ( low density ) ; groups exhibit lower @xmath0 ratios than typical rich clusters by a factor of nearly two , as seen in both data and simulations .",
    "based on the present results we also expect that observations of weak lensing in the `` field '' , which are currently underway , will reveal lower @xmath0 ratios than seen in clusters or superclusters of galaxies by a factor of up to @xmath252 , depending on the specific overdensities .",
    "our best - fit @xmath9 ( eq .",
    "5 ) is lower than previous estimates due to the antibias discussed above as well as the more robust use of the entire @xmath4 function  not just clusters in constraining @xmath9 .",
    "a mass - density of @xmath150 frequently regarded as a current  most popular  value , appears to overestimate the entire observed @xmath4 function , _",
    "_ on all scales__@xmath151 for galaxies , groups , clusters and superclusters .",
    "the above analysis uses overdensities selected in the @xmath152 simulation ( keeping the same overdensities for the different @xmath9 s ) .",
    "the actual overdensities ( of groups , clusters , superclusters ) in the lower @xmath153 universe are of course twice as large , which can further reduce @xmath9 by @xmath154 , to @xmath155 . however , this effect , which is caused mainly by the earlier cluster formation time in lower @xmath9 models is minimized by the fact that _ all _ objects form earlier in such models .",
    "if so , the overdensities need not be re - scaled .",
    "if they are re - scaled , the best - fit @xmath9 may be lower than given above ( by @xmath156% ) .",
    "on small scales , the data show that @xmath0 of elliptical galaxies is larger than that of spirals by a factor of @xmath253 ( bld ; see also tully and shaya 1998 ) ; this is mostly due to lower blue luminosity in the older ellipticals , but could also be partially due to higher elliptical mass . to test this observation in the simulations , we identify old and young galaxies ( thus mostly ellipticals and spirals respectively ) by selecting galactic systems based on their redshift of formation . for example , in the large simulation box we define regions of `` old '' galaxies as those where the total galactic particle mass formed at high redshift ( e.g. , @xmath157 ) exceeds that which formed at low redshift ( e.g. , @xmath158 ) by a factor of five .",
    "thus regions dominated by old galaxies satisfy : @xmath159 .",
    "similarly , regions dominated by `` young '' galaxies satisfy @xmath160 .",
    "varying the specific redshift cuts and the fractional threshold ( 0.2 , 0.4 , 0.6 ) does not affect the final results discussed below .    in figure 4",
    "we present the @xmath0 function for the old and young galaxies as discussed above ( for @xmath161mpc ; solid and dashed curves ) .",
    "these curves are superimposed on the high and low overdensity bands from fig .",
    "3 .  the results show a strong correlation :  the old galaxy @xmath10 function traces remarkably well the high overdensity regions ( such as clusters and superclusters ) , while the young galaxies trace well the low overdensity regions",
    ".  no re - normalization has been applied , and the results are insensitive to reasonable changes in the redshift and threshold definitions of the young and old regions .",
    "this result is consistent with observations in the sense that high density regions are indeed best traced by old galaxies .",
    "the difference between @xmath0 of the old and young galactic regions is approximately a factor of 2 to 3 , consistent with observations .  extending the results to smaller scales of individual galaxies , we select old and young galaxies in the high - resolution simulations based on their colors : @xmath162 ( old ) and @xmath163 ( young ) .  we plot in fig .",
    "4 the mean 10% highest and lowest @xmath10 for galaxies in these respective color cuts , for @xmath164 kpc to 6 mpc .",
    "the results depend only slightly on the exact cuts .",
    "the results are consistent with those obtained from the large simulation ; they merge with each other in the overlap regions .",
    "the simulated results are consistent with the data for the entire @xmath10 function if - and only if - @xmath3 @xmath1650.16 , as shown in figs . 2 - 4 .",
    "we use large - scale cosmological simulations to determine the expected mass - to - light ratio of galaxy systems and its dependence on scale .",
    "the @xmath10 function is investigated from small scales of galaxies ( @xmath164 kpc ) to large scales ( @xmath166mpc ) , and compared with observations of galaxies , groups , clusters , and superclusters .",
    "we use the results to evaluate the amount of bias on different scales ( i.e. , how mass traces light ) , and use the comparison with observations to determine the mass density of the universe , @xmath3 .      1 .   in high density regions",
    "the galaxy blue light is antibiased ( i.e. , lower ) relative to the total mass density ( while the galaxy mass density is not ) .",
    "this is due to the old age of the high density systems which leads to a relative decrease in their present - day luminosity , especially in the blue band that traces recent star formation .",
    "the shape of the simulated @xmath10 function is in excellent agreement with observations . the simulated @xmath167 function increases with scale on small scales and flattens on large scales , where @xmath0 reaches a constant value , as observed .",
    "the mean flattening of @xmath10 on large scales indicates that , on average , mass follows light on large scales ( i.e. , @xmath168 ) .",
    "3 .   even though @xmath0 is approximately constant on large scales , we find that the actual value of @xmath0 depends on the local mass overdensity , @xmath169 , at a given scale .",
    "high overdensity regions exhibit higher @xmath0 ratios than lower density regions",
    ".  the difference can typically be a factor of 2 to 3 , consistent with observations of groups and clusters of galaxies ( representing low and high density regions , respectively ) .",
    "the dependence of @xmath167 on overdensity indicates that high density regions such as rich clusters and superclusters are relatively _ antibiased _ - they exhibit higher than average @xmath0 values , implying that mass is more concentrated than light in these regions ( see 1 above ) . in the blue luminosity band ,",
    "the cluster @xmath0 antibias is @xmath170 .",
    "we find that the @xmath10 function of high density regions is traced well by @xmath10 of old ( elliptical ) galaxies ; low density regions are traced well by young ( spiral ) galaxies .",
    "these results are consistent with observations .",
    "we determine the mass density of the universe by fitting the simulated @xmath10 function to observations .",
    "the best fit @xmath9 is lower than previous estimates based on cluster @xmath4 values because of the antibias discussed above as well as the more robust use of the entire @xmath4 function  not just clusters  in constraining @xmath9 .",
    "we find a best - fit value of @xmath171 ( with an additional estimated uncertainty of @xmath172 for possible additional systematics ) ; this value provides a remarkably good match to the data for galaxies , groups , clusters , and superclusters .",
    "the results are independent of the details of the models and provide a powerful measure of @xmath9 .",
    "the only significant uncertainty we are aware of is due to the possibility that current observations may systematically underestimate the global mean luminosity density of the universe .",
    "this will produce a corresponding underestimate in our computation of @xmath9 unless there was also a corresponding underestimate in the luminosity of groups , clusters , and superclusters of galaxies .",
