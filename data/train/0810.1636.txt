    "discs around black holes are warped if the spin axis of the central object and the angular momentum of the accreting matter are misaligned .",
    "the fluid elements in tilted orbits will be subject to lense - thirring ( gravitomagnetic ) precession which tends to twist and warp the disc @xcite . the way a tilted ring communicates its inclination with respect to the equator of the black hole to its neighbouring rings depends on a balance between hydrodynamic and gravitomagnetic torques . roughly speaking the warp propagation",

    "warping might also be induced by radiation pressure forces @xcite . despite being more likely for discs around neutron star primaries @xcite",

    "eccentric accretion discs are believed to exist in cataclysmic binaries of mass ratio @xmath4 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "eccentricity can result from an instability involving the orbiting gas and the tidal potential of the companion star .",
    "discs may become eccentric if they are large enough to extend to the 3:1 resonance , the radius in the disc where its angular velocity equals three times that of the binary @xcite .",
    "the strongest observational evidence for eccentric discs is the detection , in the light curves of accreting binary systems , of long - period modulations known as superhumps , which can be explained by the action of tidal stresses on a precessing eccentric disc @xcite .",
    "although this phenomenon is usually associated with cataclysmic variable stars , superhumps have been detected in an increasing number of black hole binaries @xcite .",
    "in fact , black hole binaries are likely to have mass ratios @xmath5 and therefore to have eccentric discs during at least some stages of their outbursts .",
    "@xcite noted that the mechanism responsible for superhump luminosity variations differs in x - ray binaries and cataclysmic variables , but the underlying dynamics is the same .",
    "our goal is to describe the propagation of global eccentric and warped disturbances , under a variety of conditions , from the outer parts of the disc where they originate to the inner parts . in the outer parts of the disc , the motion is keplerian and stationary or slowly precessing global deformations",

    "@xmath6 , tilted orbits at different radius will tend to precess at different rates , which tends to twist the disc .",
    "hydrodynamic stresses counteract this effect , resulting in wavelike warp propagation from the outer disc to the inner region .",
    "similarly , for eccentric discs a transition has to be made between the keplerian region where eccentric instabilities are driven , and the inner region where general relativistic effects dominate the precession of elliptical orbits .",
    "it is this connection between different regions of the disc , with different characteristics , that we attempt to describe .",

    "as showed by @xcite these modes are global , and have relatively long wavelengths when compared to the other modes described by the local dispersion relation , being the most likely to exist in a turbulent disc .",
    "more specifically , a @xmath32 mode can be identified with a warp as its vertical displacement is independent of the vertical coordinate @xmath33 and varies with @xmath34 at each radius , giving rise to a tilting ( movement with respect to the disc plane ) .",
    "a @xmath35 mode corresponds to eccentric disc since its radial displacement is independent of @xmath33 and varies with azimuthal angle , originating an elliptic orbit ( movement within the disc plane ) .",
    "the @xmath31 modes are global in the sense that only they can have a wavelength much larger than the semi - thickness of the disc over a wide range of radius .",

    "* ) assuming the warp to be a zero - frequency mode propagating in a strictly isothermal , relativistic disc .",
    "in addition to being valid only where @xmath37 is constant and where viscous effects are negligible , the equation derived does not hold for large radius , where the wavelength of the warp becomes comparable to @xmath6 , since some terms were omitted in our local approximation .",
    "a similar method was used to derive an equation for the eccentricity at each radius @xmath38 valid only for an inviscid and strictly isothermal disc .    here",
    "we consider the more general description of a stationary , wave - like warp and eccentricity given by @xcite and @xcite , respectively .",
    "these theories are less general than the ones formulated by @xcite since they consider deformations to have small amplitude , and not all viscous or turbulent effects are included .",
    "also , the @xcite calculation uses a highly simplified , 2d disc model . however , the secular theories of @xcite and @xcite are appropriate for thin discs of any given structure , and allow for viscous ( turbulent ) damping of deformations .",
    "observations indicate that black hole systems can be found in different spectral states , going from the quiescent state to low , intermediate , high and very high states as the mass accretion rate increases @xcite .",
    "the very high state is the one where high - frequency qpos , i.e. , modulations seen in the spectra of black hole systems that are not strictly periodic and have frequencies @xmath39 hz , are almost exclusively detected .",
    "this is the dominating state close to the eddington limit .",
    "the accretion flow has different characteristics in different black hole states . if the disc properties are such that the warp and eccentricity can propagate to the inner region , the interaction between relativistic effects and global deformations can give rise to interesting phenomena .",
    "in particular , the warp and eccentricity can have a fundamental role in exciting trapped inertial modes , which may explain high - frequency qpos @xcite , as previously suggested by @xcite and @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we show that the inward propagation of warp and eccentricity is facilitated for high accretion rate . for fixed viscosity ,",
    "global deformations reach the inner region of the disc with a modest amplitude when the accretion rate is high , and can take part in the excitation mechanism for inertial modes trapped in this region .",
    "if high - frequency qpos can be identified with these trapped inertial waves , we can argue that they are predominantly detected in the very high state , where the accretion rate is close to eddington , because only in this case global deformations can reach the inner region with non - negligible amplitude and excite the trapped modes .",
    "in section 2 , we introduce the disc model in which we study the propagation of global deformations .",
    "we consider a disc with a polytropic structure in the vertical direction , constant opacity , and with gas and radiation contributing to the total pressure . in section 3",
    "we describe the propagation of global disturbances , by solving equations for the warp tilt and eccentricity at each radius . to mimic several possible conditions in a disc with a fixed viscosity @xmath2 around a black hole of a given mass and spin , we vary the accretion rate and the damping of the warp and eccentricity .",
    "the results obtained are discussed in section 4 .",
    "conclusions are presented in section 5 .",
    "in the famous @xcite model , the disc is assumed to be geometrically thin and optically thick .",
    "the gas in the disc is heated by viscous dissipation and cooled by radiative diffusion through the vertical boundaries .",
    "angular momentum is transferred outwards at a rate which is taken to be proportional to the height - integrated total pressure , with the efficiency of the process being parametrised by a dimensionless quantity @xmath2 , independently of the nature of the stress .",
    "the disc is taken to be composed of three parts : in the innermost regions ( a ) and ( b ) , electron scattering is the main contribution to the opacity ( which is then given by the constant , thomson value , @xmath40 ) , while free - free absorption is dominant in the outer region ( c ) . in ( a ) the pressure",
    "is determined by the radiation pressure ( @xmath41 ) , while gas pressure ( @xmath42 ) dominates in ( b ) and ( c ) .",
    "the radiation - dominated region exists only if the accretion rate is larger than a few percent of the eddington rate , being important in accretion discs around black holes .    despite neglecting to treat the vertical structure of the disc , not considering other contributions to the cooling and heating rates of the gas , and despite the simple parametrization for the angular momentum transfer ,",
    "the shakura & sunyaev @xmath2-model is still the standard reference for the radial structure of accretion discs , if gas pressure is dominant .",
    "region ( a ) has always been more problematic .",
    "in fact , the assumption that stress scales with the total pressure in the radiation pressure dominated regime leads to viscous @xcite and thermal @xcite instabilities .",

    "this result , and the simulations in radiation - pressure dominated regions , indicate that assuming a polytropic vertical structure with @xmath49 throughout the radial extent of the disc is a good approximation , provided the opacity remains constant .",
    "this is true of the innermost regions ( ( a ) and ( b ) in the shakura & sunyaev model ) of the disc .",

    "in fact , the physics of region ( c ) is more complicated than assumed by @xcite , because of the presence of different sources of opacity and the importance of irradiation and partial ionisation .",
    "the assumptions of hydrostatic equilibrium and vertical isentropy ( or equivalently , @xmath49 polytropic structure in @xmath33 ) , together with the equation of state , are enough to determine the vertical structure of the disc , i.e. , determine the variation of @xmath64 , @xmath45 and @xmath65 with @xmath33 , without the requirement of radiative balance ( see discussion in section 3.1 of * ? ? ?",
    "however , to fully determine the radial structure : @xmath66 , @xmath67 , @xmath68 and @xmath69 , two more equations are needed since the polytropic relation is not valid in the radial direction .",

    "the final equation comes from energy considerations .",
    "it is traditional to assume that the disc is in radiative equilibrium .",

    "therefore , here we use the energy balance equation in the form    @xmath79    where the energy transport by other motions rather than by radiative diffusion is encompassed in @xmath80 . since radiation is supposed to carry the entire heat flux at the photosphere @xmath81 , we assume that the extra term integrates to zero so that the energy balance can be written as ,    @xmath82    since @xmath83 by symmetry .    here",

    "the basic behaviour of the numerical solutions presented in this section can be explained using wkb theory . in particular , it is possible to predict how the wavelength and amplitude of the several solutions scale with radius .",
    "a wkb analysis of the secular theories can be performed by assuming the deformations @xmath36 and @xmath38 to be proportional to @xmath171 , where @xmath172 is a function of @xmath166 to be determined . the @xmath173 term in equation ( [ ecceq ] ) can be ignored in the wkb analysis since relativistic precession dominates the propagation of eccentricity . letting @xmath174 and @xmath175 ,",
    "we can write equations ( [ luboweq ] ) and ( [ ecceq ] ) in the form    @xmath176    the wkb solution is valid where the radial variation of @xmath177 and @xmath178 is slow and is given by , @xmath179.\\ ] ] in the inviscid case ( @xmath180 ) , @xmath181 , @xmath182 , @xmath183 , and @xmath184 , keeping only the lowest - order terms in the expressions for @xmath185 and @xmath186 . remembering that @xmath187 ( from [ he2 ] ) , we can write    @xmath188 , \\label{wwkb}\\ ] ]    @xmath189 , \\label{ewkb}\\ ] ]    where we have ignored the variation of @xmath142 with radius . if the stress scales with the total pressure ,",
    "these expressions indicate that the amplitude of the warp should be proportional to @xmath190 in region ( a ) and to @xmath191 in region ( b ) ; the amplitude of the eccentricity is proportional to @xmath192 in the radiation - pressure dominated regime and to @xmath193 when gas pressure dominates .",
    "if the stress scales with the gas pressure only , the amplitudes in region ( a ) are proportional to @xmath194 and @xmath195 in the case of the warp and eccentricity , respectively .",
    "the results for region ( a ) can be confirmed in fig .",
    "[ wkb ] . in region",
    "( b ) @xmath196 , @xmath197 , so that the radial variation of both warp and eccentricity amplitudes is slow , as seen in fig .",
    "the eccentricity does not tend to a constant at large radius because its amplitude is slowly increasing when @xmath6 increases .",
    "the warp amplitude decreases with @xmath6 but does not tend to zero as indicated by the wkb scaling .",
    "the reason for this apparent contradiction is in the failure of the wkb approximation at large radii where the wavelength tends to infinity .",
    "the radial variation of the wavelength of the deformations can also be understood in light of the wkb theory . from equations ( [ wwkb],[ewkb ] ) , we see that the wavelengths are given by @xmath198 , and @xmath199 , for the warp and eccentricity respectively",
    ". these dependencies are in agreement with the results shown in fig . [ free ] , where it is clear that the wavelengths of the deformations increase with radius and with the disc thickness ( or equivalently with the accretion rate , cf .",
    "( [ ha],[hb ] ) ) .",
    "the increase in @xmath200 when @xmath96 increases is evident : in particular , for @xmath201 the wavelength of the warp becomes so large that it practically loses its oscillatory character , but still maintains the sharp increase in @xmath167 . even in this case , the inner disc is not aligned with the equator of the black - hole as in the @xcite picture .",
    "unfortunately the behaviour of the solutions very close to the marginally stable orbit can not be trusted in detail because the singularity of the disc model there ought to be resolved by the transition to a supersonic inflow .",
    "+    +      in fig . [ damp ]",
    "we show the variation with radius of the warp tilt and eccentricity in the case where a significant attenuation is present .",
    "the values of @xmath202 and @xmath203 are both larger than the viscosity value @xmath2 used to model the disc , and are chosen so that the warp and eccentricity have negligible amplitude at the inner region of the disc , for small accretion rate ( @xmath204 ) . for dissipation values smaller than these ones , the global deformations propagate everywhere with non - negligible amplitude even for small accretion rate , although with larger amplitude in the inner region for larger @xmath96 .    an important difference between the results presented here and the ones in fig .",
    "[ free ] is the existence of a non - zero imaginary part in the solutions .",
    "this shows that the reflection of the global deformations from the stress - free boundary is no longer perfect since they are affected by viscous attenuation and , in consequence , their amplitude is reduced as they propagate to smaller radii ; a wave with inward group velocity , as opposed to a standing wave , is set up .",
    "it is evident from fig .",
    "[ damp ] that when the accretion rate increases the global deformations propagate to the inner region of the disc more easily , i.e. , the amplitude of warp and eccentricity in the inner region increases with @xmath96 .",
    "this result can be explained in light of the wkb analysis introduced in 4.1 .",
    "if a small viscosity is present ( @xmath205 ) , the wkb solution for the warp and eccentricity includes an attenuation factor due to the presence of a imaginary wavenumber @xmath206 ,    @xmath207    if @xmath3 varies slowly with radius , the logarithm of the attenuation factor is    @xmath208    indicating that , for fixed viscosity , the attenuation is smaller if the thickness of the disc ( or equivalently @xmath96 ) is larger .",
    "the results presented in this section indicate that global deformations can reach the inner region of accretion discs under a wide variety of conditions . in particular , even when subject to large viscous attenuation , both warp and eccentricity can reach the inner disc provided the black hole is accreting mass at a large enough rate .",
    "some caveats accompany the solutions obtained for @xmath154 and @xmath155 .",
    "the equations used assume that these quantities are small enough so that non - linear effects can be neglected .",
    "they also assume that the quantities @xmath209 and @xmath209 are smaller than , or of the order of , @xmath3 which is not true of the inner region of relativistic discs .",
    "another important caveat relates to the effects of viscosity in the propagation of global deformations .",
    "here they are parametrised using viscous coefficients @xmath136 and @xmath146 ; this is the simplest way of describing the poorly understood process of turbulent damping in accretion discs . in the particular case of the eccentricity equations",
    "only a bulk viscosity is present so that the complications of viscous overstability can be avoided .",
    "however , the latter may be present resulting in growth ( as opposed to decay ) of eccentricity at small radii .",
    "the above results are for strictly stationary deformations such as may be induced by a misalignment between the rotational axis of the binary orbit and the spin axis of the black hole .",
    "we have also computed slowly precessing global eccentric modes in binary stars by a method similar to @xcite but including the relativistic expressions for the characteristic frequencies .",
    "when relativistic precession is included , the global modes have almost the same precession and decay rates as in a newtonian model , while the solution in the inner part of the disc resembles the stationary solutions described above .",
    "in this paper we studied the propagation of warp and eccentricity in discs around black holes to determine the conditions under which these disturbances can propagate to the inner regions of accretion discs .",
    "high - frequency qpos have previously been identified with inertial oscillations trapped in the inner region of discs , and are detected mainly when black holes are in the very high state where accretion rate is maximum .",
    "we find the accretion rate to have a vital role in the damped propagation of global deformations .",
    "our results suggest that the activation of the inner region , and consequent excitation of trapped oscillations by these disturbances , may be possible only when the accretion rate is close to its eddington value , i.e. , when the black hole is in the very high state .",
    "when the propagation of global disturbances ( found to have an oscillatory structure in the radial direction ) is not affect by viscous damping , the increase in mass accretion rate gives rise to a lengthening in their wavelength , in agreement with the wkb analysis of the warp and eccentricity equations .",
    "the most interesting results of our calculations are obtained when the more realistic situation of damped propagation of global disturbances is considered . in this case , the increase of accretion rate facilitates the propagation of warp and eccentricity , i.e. , their amplitudes in the inner region increase with @xmath96 .",
    "in particular , when the accretion rate is only a small fraction of eddington and the viscous damping is strong enough to completely suppress the propagation of global deformations , an increase in @xmath96 to the values expected in the very high state results in their amplitude in the inner region being increased to a non - negligible value .",
    "a limitation of the disc model used in our calculations and introduced in section 2 is the fact that it does not include relativistic effects .",
    "for example , the law for angular momentum conservation in relativistic discs @xcite is slightly different from the one used here ( cf [ cam ] ) .",
    "however , relativistic corrections are small and their inclusion is not expected to significantly affect the final results .",
    "also , since the terms on the right - hand side of equations ( [ luboweq],[ecceq ] ) dominate the warp and eccentricity propagation , it is more important to introduce relativistic effects in these equations by using expressions ( [ relomega])([relomegaz ] ) for the characteristic frequencies , as they correctly describe apsidal and nodal relativistic precession rates , related to @xmath210 and @xmath211 .",
