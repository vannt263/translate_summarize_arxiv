    "transfer matrix method ( tmm ) based on the schrdinger equation is a widely used numerical approach to investigate electronic transport , such as in disordered systems @xcite or in the presence of electron - phonon interaction @xcite .",
    "however , when the spacial dimension is higher than 1 , the size of a system investigated by tmm is very limited due to numerical instability@xcite .",
    "this numerical instability originates from such an issue that the smallest eigen - mode in a considered system will be lost in computation when its ratio to the largest is less than the accuracy of our computer , represented by floating point numbers .",
    "thus it more readily occurs for a wider two - dimensional system that has more eigen - modes and then larger difference between the smallest and largest eigen - modes @xcite , especially their ratio dramatically decreasing exponentially with @xmath8 after @xmath8 times recursive multiplication of the matrix transfer . to deal with such a numerical instability and realize a large scale calculation ,",
    "a number of schemes have been proposed , for example , by introducing extra auxiliary parameters that are determined together with reflection coefficients @xcite , or by diagonalizing the transfer matrix of a conductor using eigenstates of leads@xcite .",
    "so far these schemes only made certain improvement and can not handle inhomogenous systems yet .    in this article , we propose a renormalized transfer matrix method ( rtmm ) to calculate the conductance of a large system , meanwhile readily incorporating disorders and/or impurities .",
    "we sketch it as follows .",
    "conventionally one recursively multiplies the transfer matrix in a scattering region from one lead side into the other lead side to directly resolve the reflection and transmission coefficients .",
    "here we first divide the scattering region into @xmath0 subregions , similar to the idea proposed in ref . @xcite . in all the subregions , we respectively take the recursive multiplications of the corresponding transfer matrixes without the numerical instability , and then lump them into a set of linear equations containing the wavefunction values at all the interfaces between the subregions as the unknowns , among which the reflection and transmission coefficients are related to wavefunction values at the left and right lead - scattering interfaces respectively .",
    "we then solve this set of linear equations by using a modified gaussian elimination method , which has been elaborately optimized by us to reduce the computational complexity from o(@xmath4 ) ( @xmath6 being the site number of the width ) to o(@xmath5 ) loop executions so that a system with a million of lattice sites can be calculated on a standard desktop computer .",
    "for a wider system , clearly a larger @xmath0 is required to avoid the numerical instability .",
    "we will illustrate the method by using it to study the electronic transport of graphene in this article .",
    "the discovery of graphene in 2004 @xcite , a single atomic layer of graphite with carbon atoms sitting at a honeycomb lattice , has aroused widespread interest both theoretically and experimentally , due to its distinctive electronic structure , whose low energy excitations can be interpreted in analogy to massless dirac relativistic fermion model , and its great potential on practical applications @xcite . among various graphene - based materials ,",
    "armchair graphene nanoribbon ( agr ) attracts intensive attention since there is an energy gap opened @xcite .",
    "here we choose agr as a model system to study .    in most theoretical and numerical studies on the electronic transport of agr , the leads were made of doped graphene@xcite , however , experimentally the leads were usually made of normal metals such as gold@xcite .",
    "similar to ref .",
    ", here we employ two semi - infinite square lattice quantum wires as leads to simulate normal metal leads , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : structure ] .",
    "actually we had previously calculated the transport properties of graphene nanoribbons between such quantum wire leads by the conventional transfer matrix method @xcite , which however would be better to be further examined by large scale graphene calculations , especially considering the effect of long - range correlated disorder and/or impurities that has an important impact on the formation of electron - hole puddles observed in graphene@xcite , as discussed in ref . .",
    "in addition , large scale system calculations are also required to determine whether or not the existence of anderson localization @xcite in low dimensional disordered system . meanwhile",
    ", the renormalized transfer matrix method can be readily extended to investigate transport in a large scale graphene system with irregular structure .    in this article",
    "we mainly present the renormalized transfer matrix method .",
    "we organize the paper as follows . in section",
    "ii , we present the renormalized transfer matrix method in conjugation with a tight binding model to describe graphene ; in section iii , we introduce optimized gaussian elimination algorithm ; in section iv , we apply the renormalized transfer matrix scheme to investigate the transport properties of pure armchair graphene nanoribbons and long - range correlated disordered armchair graphene nanoribbons , respectively ; and in section v , we make a summary .     and @xmath6 atoms in @xmath9 and @xmath10 direction , as connected to square - lattice leads simulating normal metal leads . here",

    "red and blue colors donate different sublattices a and b , respectively.,width=321 ]",
    "graphene takes a honeycomb lattice with two sites per unit cell , namely consisting of two sublattices @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "the tight - binding hamiltonian considering that @xmath16 electrons hop between the nearest - neighbor atoms in graphene reads as follows , @xmath17 whereas @xmath18 ( @xmath19 is the operator of creating ( annihilating ) one electron at a lattice site with site coordinates being @xmath20 and @xmath21 respectively , @xmath22 denotes the nearest - neighbors , @xmath23 is the nearest - neighbor hopping integral , and @xmath24 is the chemical potential , i.e. the fermi level , which can be adjusted by an effective gate voltage directly applied on the graphene ribbon .",
    "figure [ fig : structure ] schematically shows an armchair - shaped graphene ribbon ( agr ) , connected with two semi - infinite square - lattice quantum wires described also by a tight binding hamiltonian with only the nearest - neighbor hopping .",

    "the nearest - neighbor hopping integral @xmath23 in the agr sets to @xmath26 , adopted as an energy unit in this article .",
    "we further assume the hopping integrals in both the left and right leads and the interface hopping integrals between the leads and agr all being @xmath26 .",
    "we use the natural open boundary condition in the calculations , which means that there are no longer dangling bonds along the boundaries , equivalent to the saturation by hydrogens in experiments .    for the shrdinger equation @xmath27 of the considered system ( fig .",
    "[ fig : structure ] ) , any wavefunction @xmath28 at a given energy @xmath29 can be expressed by a linear combination of localized wannier bases @xmath30 , that is , @xmath31 with the complex coefficients @xmath32 to be determined . in other words ,",
    "a set of @xmath33 is the site representation of the wave function . in the left or right lead , @xmath32 is further denoted as @xmath34 or @xmath35 .    in the agr , by applying the hamiltonian ( [ eq : hamiltonian ] ) on @xmath31 we obtain the following equation regarding the wavefunction in the scattering region for a given energy @xmath29 , @xmath36 where @xmath37 and @xmath38 denote the nearest neighbors along @xmath9 and @xmath10 directions respectively .",
    "we now define a column vector @xmath39 which consists of all the @xmath6 @xmath40-coefficients with the same @xmath9-axis index @xmath41 , @xmath42 after rearranging , we can then rewrite eq .   in a more compact form as @xmath43 here",
    "@xmath44 is the so - called @xmath41-th transfer matrix which elements consist of @xmath29 , @xmath26 , and @xmath24 .",
    "as its name means , @xmath44 connects @xmath6 @xmath40-coefficients of any slice @xmath41 with @xmath6 @xmath40-coefficients of its two neighbor slices @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "there are totally @xmath2 transfer matrices in the agr ( fig .",
    "1 ) .    in each lead , there are @xmath6 right - traveling waves ( channels ) and @xmath6 left - traveling waves ( channels ) for a given energy @xmath29 , respectively .",
    "each channel is defined by the corresponding transverse wave vector @xmath47 determined by the open boundary condition , namely forming standing waves , @xmath48 with @xmath8 being an integer from @xmath49 to @xmath6 and the lattice constant @xmath13 being assumed as a length unity .",
    "physically when an unity - amplitude right - traveling wave in the @xmath8-th channel is scattered into the @xmath50-th channel , the wavefunction in the left and right semi - infinite leads can be expressed respectively @xcite as @xmath51 where @xmath52 and @xmath53 are the reflection and transmission coefficients from the @xmath8-th to the @xmath50-th channel respectively , and the continuous longitudinal wave vector @xmath54 and the discrete transverse wave vector @xmath55 of the @xmath8-th channel satisfy the following dispersion relation of the square lattice tight - binding model , @xmath56 which uniquely determines @xmath57 in the @xmath8-th channel for a given energy @xmath29 , thus denoted as @xmath58 from now .    as shown in fig . 1 , at the interfaces between the agr and the leads the lead wavefunction represented by eq .",
    "naturally extend to the site columns indexed with 0 and 1 from the left side and the site columns indexed with @xmath59 and @xmath2 from the right side respectively .",
    "then by using the column vector notation ( eq . ) , we can rewrite the @xmath8-th channel wavefunction at the interface more compactly as , @xmath60 where @xmath61 and @xmath62 for convenience to represent matrices @xmath63 and @xmath64 with dimensions @xmath65 , we further define two @xmath66 matrices as follows , @xmath67 and @xmath68 with the above definition , matrices @xmath63 and @xmath64 can be represented by the products of @xmath69 and @xmath70 as follows , @xmath71 and @xmath72 where @xmath73 means the complex conjugation .    according to eq .",

    "however , the @xmath2-fold multiplication of the transfer matrix will bring out the aforementioned numerical instability for a large @xmath2 , which has been found for @xmath76 with @xmath77 in our calculations .",

    "notice that the last subunit may have less columns than @xmath3 , when @xmath2 is not integral multiple of @xmath3.,width=321 ]    in order to solve the numerical instability , we propose the transfer matrix renormalization scheme in which we first divide the scattering region into @xmath0 subregions , each of which contains @xmath3 columns , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : renormalization scheme ] .",
    "for all the subregions , we successively take @xmath3-fold multiplication of the transfer matrix according to eq . to establish direct connections between the interfaces across the subregions for the wavefunction , represented by @xmath79 where @xmath80 . then in combination with eqs . , we lump all the equations represented by eq . into a following set of linear equations containing the reflection and transmission coefficients from a fixed ( the @xmath8-th ) channel respectively to all the @xmath6 channels plus the wavefunction values at the interfaces between the subregions as the unknowns , @xmath81 with @xmath82 @xmath83 in eq .  , the other elements not listed in matrix @xmath84 are all zero",
    ". clearly we will first make such a division in practice that the numerical instability will not take place in matrix @xmath85 , which can be easily realized once the subregions are short enough . on the other hand",
    ", we would also like to make the subregions as long as possible to reduce the size of matrix @xmath84 as small as possible .",
    "so it needs to take a balance in making division .",

    "as long as we solve eq .",
    ", we can obtain the reflection and transmission coefficients of the @xmath8-th channel to all the @xmath6 channels respectively .",
    "then we use the landauer formula to calculate conductance , @xmath86 with @xmath87 and @xmath88    the renormalized transfer matrix method proposed here can be easily generalized to the case of an irregular graphene nanoribbon composed by a series of nanoribbons with different width @xcite . similar to eqs . and , a set of the linear equations can be constructed as well , in which however the dimensions of the matrices @xmath85 are variant and depend on the width of the local graphene nanoribbon .",
    "finally we comment on the application of renormalized transfer matrix method on some relevant structures .",
    "our method is not applicable to deal with graphene nanoribbon lead only because the wavefunction in graphene nanoribbon lead can not be expressed analytically as that in quantum wire lead .",
    "for other relevant structures , the coefficients of wavefunctions for two columns of lead lattice sites adjacent to lead / graphene interfaces are usually included , and they are related with transmission matrix @xmath89 and reflection matrix @xmath90 in lead @xmath41 . when the transverse size of graphene devices is different from that of leads and/or there are multi - terminals , transfer matrix method is not applicable and the linear equations for those coefficients of wavefunctions for all lattice sites adjacent to lead / graphene interfaces are obtained directly from sch@xmath91rdinger equations . by applying renormalized transfer matrix method for the other uniform sub - systems combined with above linear equations , we obtain the matrix a analogy to that in eq .",
    "[ eq : a matrix ] and sparse too .",
    "it is easy to apply rtmm to investigate electronic transport through zigzag graphene between quantum wire leads , and the only difference lies in the specific form of transfer matrix . for @xmath92 in armchair graphene nanoribbon had been given @xcite , while @xmath92 in zigzag graphene nanoribbon is listed in the note @xcite .",
    "the efficiency of calculating the whole problem depends on how to solve the set of linear equations represented by eqs .",
    ", , and , in which @xmath84 is a @xmath93 block matrix . in general , there are two standard algorithms to solve a set of linear equations , i.e. gaussian elimination and @xmath94 decomposition@xcite .",

    "if the coefficient matrix is a sparse matrix , these two methods can be modified based on the characteristics of its sparseness to greatly improve the performance .    in the case of matrix @xmath84",
    ", clearly the gaussian elimination method exploits the sparse structure more easily than the @xmath94 decomposition .",
    "however the conventional full pivoting , designed in the gaussian elimination method to reduce computing roundoff errors , has to be given up since it picks up a pivoting element among all the matrix elements so as to mess up the structure of matrix @xmath84 . on the other hand ,",
    "it is well - known that the gaussian elimination method without proper pivoting is unreliable . for matrix @xmath84 we notice that the nonzero elements are uniformly distributed except in sub - matrices @xmath63 and @xmath64 which describe the two interfaces .",
    "this indicates that the full pivoting is unnecessary for matrix @xmath84 .     for @xmath97 , only non - zero elements are listed .",
    "( b ) schematic local maximum pivoting gaussian elimination method ( lmpg ) , where green rectangle and the last square represent doing maximum pivoting in these local areas , blue solid and red dash rows show the range of normalization and elimination , respectively .",
    "black dash line donates the diagonal line.,width=302 ]    targeting matrix @xmath84 , we develop a local maximum pivoting gaussian elimination method ( lmpg ) , in which a pivoting can be well undertaken in a local area to realize the same reduction of computing roundoff errors as the full pivoting .",

    "3 @xcite , therefore transport in large - scale graphene - based system is highly desired .",
    "meanwhile , the transport in a large - scale graphene up to @xmath130 lattice sites was investigated by diagonalizing transfer matrix @xcite , which is powerful to deal with uniform and pure system while difficult to solve disordered system and/or system with impurities . here",
    "we study the transport properties of agr connected to normal leads , with a variety of widths and lengths at different chemical potential ( i.e. different gate voltages ) and the results are summarized in fig .",
    "[ fig : agr ] .",
    "physically , there is a small energy gap for a finite and semiconducting graphene ribbon , while at a finite @xmath24 over the energy gap , the ballistic transport is thus expected in pure system since there are always a number of channels for electrons to propagate through .",
    "therefore , for a fixed width with different lengths the curves of the conductance @xmath131 versus @xmath24 coincides exactly except the oscillation due to quantum interference as shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : agr](b ) , in which @xmath131 is independent of @xmath132 . on the other hand , for a fixed length with different widths ,",
    "the conductance @xmath131 is proportional to the width @xmath133 as shown in fig .",

    "it turns out that the conductivity of agr @xmath134 being @xmath135 merge together for a fixed length with different widths as shown in fig .",

    "[ fig : agr](d ) , respectively .",
    "furthermore , @xmath134 is superlinearly to the chemical potential @xmath24 , but with the different slopes between the positive and negative chemical potential in agr , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : agr ] .",
    "this also means that the agr conductivity increases with the carrier density , and the asymmetrical behavior between electrons and holes , due to the occurrence of odd - numbered rings formed at the interface of agr and normal metal contacts @xcite , is consistent with the experimental observation @xcite .",
    "finally we compare the transport in small and large graphene - based materials and find that the transport in large system is close to experimental observations , since the sizes of samples in experiments usually reach microns .",
    "however , the breaking of electron - hole symmetry in transport exists in both small and large armchair - shaped graphene system .     varies from 0 to 2.0 , where @xmath136 , @xmath137 and @xmath138 .",
    "@xmath139 and @xmath140 corresponds to anderson disorder and no disorder respectively.,width=325 ]    in graphene samples , disorder and impurities are usually inevitable .",
    "here we study the effect of anderson disorder with long - range correlation on the transport in large graphene at charge neutral point .",
    "it was commonly believed that anderson localization @xcite in one- and two - dimensional systems is induced by even a weak disorder from the scaling theory @xcite .",
    "however metal - insulator transition occurs in low - dimensional disordered system with long - range correlation @xcite .",

    "since the localization length in graphene increases with the width as a result of more channels in wider graphene , the length of agr should increase till comparable to the localization length in order to study metal - insulator transition .",
    "therefore the application of rtmm to large - scale graphene system is necessary in this case .",

    "the conductances of agr without any amount of disorder and with anderson disorder are also shown as two extremes .",
    "it is found that the conductance in pure agr equals to @xmath142 as @xmath2 is larger than 400 . on the other hand ,",
    "the conductance in agr with anderson disorder decreases monotonically as @xmath2 increases and finally decays exponentially in even longer agr . in the presence of long - range correlated disorder ,",

    "the average conductance is a little higher than that in pure graphene due to the deviation of the conductance .",
    "the conductance curves eventually collapse and approach that in pure agr as @xmath40 is larger than 1.8 , and the conductance decreases as the length increases otherwise .",
    "therefore the long - range correlation of disorder induces the localization - delocalization transition in agr .",
    "renormalized transfer matrix method ( rtmm ) is proposed and the computational speed and memory usage have been greatly improved by optimization .",

    "<S> study on the electronic transport of a large scale two dimensional system by the transfer matrix method ( tmm ) based on the schrdinger equation suffers from the numerical instability . to address this problem </S>",
    "<S> , we propose a renormalized transfer matrix method ( rtmm ) by setting up a set of linear equations from @xmath0 times of multiplication of traditional transfer matrix ( @xmath1 with @xmath2 and @xmath3 being the atom number of length and the transfer step ) , and smaller @xmath3 is required for wider systems . then we solve the above linear equations by gauss elimination method and further optimize to reduce the computational complexity from o(@xmath4 ) to o(@xmath5 ) , in which @xmath6 is the atom number of the width . applying rtmm , we study transport properties of large scale pure and long - range correlated disordered armchair graphene nanoribbon ( agr ) ( carbon atoms up to @xmath7 for pure case ) between quantum wire contacts . as for pure agr , </S>",
    "<S> the conductance is superlinear with the fermi energy and the conductance is linear with the width while independent of the length , showing characteristics of ballistic transport . as for disordered agr with long - range correlation </S>",
    "<S> , there is metal - insulator transition induced by the correlation strength of disorder . </S>",
    "<S> it is straightforward to extend rtmm to investigate transport in large scale system with irregular structure . </S>"
