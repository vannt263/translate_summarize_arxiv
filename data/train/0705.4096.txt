    "there is currently a great deal of interest in the statistical properties of primordial perturbations from inflation , because measurements of any non - gaussianity will improve by about an order of magnitude over the next few years , for example with the atacama cosmology telescope @xcite and planck @xcite",
    ". this will provide a key way to discriminate between the many models of inflation .",
    "although single field models of slow - roll inflation typically generate a small level of non - gaussianity @xcite , there may be an observable level generated in multiple field inflation @xcite , for example the curvaton scenario @xcite , or some single field models such as dirac - born - infeld inflation ( dbi ) @xcite .",
    "currently observations of the cmb have concentrated on constraining the 3-point function ( bispectrum ) @xcite , but the 4-point function ( trispectrum ) has also been considered @xcite , and in principle higher order @xmath0-point functions may also be observable if they are sufficiently large . in some models",
    "the first signal of non - gaussianity may come through the trispectrum , for example some special cases of the curvaton scenario @xcite .",
    "furthermore higher order statistics in principle carry more information and therefore could distinguish between different sources of non - gaussianity , for example in many cases the bispectrum can be paremetrised by a single non - linearity parameter , @xmath1 , while the trispectrum depends on two wavenumber independent parameters , @xmath2 and @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "we will calculate the primordial curvature perturbation on uniform density hypersurfaces , @xmath4 , on large scales employing the @xmath5 formalism @xcite .",
    "we use the separate universe approach @xcite .",
    "this considers each super - hubble scale patch to be evolving like a separate friedmann - robertson - walker universe which are locally homogeneous .  by patching these regions together",
    "we can track the evolution of the perturbations on large scales just by using background quantities which greatly simplifies our calculations .",
    "we also need to know the perturbations of the scalar fields at hubble - exit , but in many cases these are extremely close to gaussian in which case their statistical properties are given purely in terms of the power spectrum of the fields .",
    "the number of @xmath6-foldings , @xmath7 , given by n=^t_fin_t_inih(t ) dt , is evaluated from an initial flat hypersurface to a final uniform - density hypersurface .",
    "the perturbation in the number of @xmath6-foldings , @xmath5 , is the difference between the curvature perturbations on the initial and final hypersurfaces .",
    "we wish to calculate primordial perturbations , hence we pick a final uniform density hypersurface to be at a fixed time during the standard radiation dominated era , for example during primordial nucleosynthesis .",
    "the initial time is arbitrary provided it is after the hubble exit time of all relevant scales .",
    "it is often convenient to pick this time to be shortly after hubble - exit .",
    "we introduce the method for calculating the primordial curvature perturbation in terms of the @xmath5 formalism in more detail below .    here",
    "we present a feynman diagram type approach to calculating the primordial non - gaussianity , where every term in the @xmath0-point function of @xmath4 has a diagrammatic representation .",
    "similar diagrams were introduced in the context of non - linear perturbation theory of large scale structure @xcite and further developed in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "it is possible to read off the corresponding mathematical term in the @xmath0-point function for every diagram and it is possible to draw all the diagrams in a systematic way so that all terms are included .",
    "this approach extends to loop corrections of any required order .",
    "although the loop corrections are expected to be small in general compared to the tree level terms there is no proof of this , except for a particular loop correction to the bispectrum in some specific models of inflation @xcite .",
    "we will see that in general the loop corrections depend on a large scale cut off ; depending on this cut off the loop correction may contribute significantly to observable quantities , see for example @xcite .",
    "in fact there is a specific model of inflation where the one loop term gives the dominant and potentially observable contribution to the bispectrum @xcite .",
    "a diagrammatic method to calculate field fluctuations during inflation was presented in @xcite .",
    "we first introduce the primordial curvature perturbation . in the next two sections of this paper",
    "we assume the initial field perturbations are gaussian , which in many cases is a good approximation to make , for example slow - roll inflation . in sec .",

    "[ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "we can write the primordial curvature perturbation , @xmath4 , in terms of derivatives of @xmath7 with respect to the fields , @xmath8 and the field perturbation , @xmath9 , at the initial time @xmath10 . by neglecting any additional dependence on @xmath11 at hubble - exit",
    "we are assuming the field perturbations on large scales are overdamped and thus we can neglect the decaying mode .",
    "this is valid during slow roll , but also more generally holds for light fields during inflation .",
    "the assumption that @xmath7 is a function of field values only is also valid in dbi inflation @xcite .",
    "we use the notation that the fields are @xmath12 , where the perturbed field @xmath13 satisfies @xmath14 .",
    "the curvature perturbation is given by @xmath15 the dummy index @xmath16 labels the light scalar fields relevant during inflation , and summation convention is used throughout this paper .",
    "it is more convenient to work with the @xmath4 defined above since it satisfies @xmath17 , even though often @xmath18 is used in the literature .",
    "this equation can hence be used to calculate the primordial @xmath0-point function of @xmath4 , although the result will depend on the @xmath0-point function of the fields at hubble exit .",
    "this has so far been explicitly calculated for the 2- , 3- and 4-point functions , @xcite .",
    "the connected 2- , 3- and 4-point functions of the fields are defined by @xmath19 note that only the 4-point function ( and higher ) depend on the direction of the @xmath20 vectors , the 2- and 3-point functions of the fields just depend on the magnitude of the vectors , @xmath21 .",
    "homogeneity of the random fields implies that the sum of the @xmath20 vectors must be zero , while isotropy implies that the @xmath0-point functions are invariant under reorientations of this closed configuration .    at lowest order in slow roll different fields",
    "are uncorrelated at hubble exit and all light fields have the same power spectrum @xcite , so @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the kronecker delta - function , and the variance per logarithmic interval in @xmath24-space is given by @xmath25 where the hubble parameter @xmath26 is evaluated at hubble - exit , @xmath27 . at zeroth order in slow - roll parameters , @xmath28 is independent of wavenumber , i.e.  we have a scale invariant spectrum for the field fluctuations .",
    "the bispectrum satisfies @xmath29 @xcite , where @xmath30 is a slow - roll parameter , so it is zero at lowest order in slow roll .",
    "however the trispectrum is not zero at lowest order in slow roll @xcite , @xmath31 , but is suppressed by @xmath32 compared to the power spectrum . for a discussion of the slow - roll order of higher order @xmath0-point functions of the fields",
    "see @xcite .",
    "initially we will assume that all of the fields have a purely gaussian distribution at an initial time , e.g.  shortly after hubble exit .",
    "then every odd @xmath0-point function of the fields is zero and every even @xmath0-point function of the fields can be reduced to a product of 2-point functions .",
    "this assumption is not required and the extension to non - gaussian field perturbations will be presented in sec .  [",
    "sec : ng ] . however the approximation of initially gaussian field perturbations is frequently made in the literature and is often a good approximation , for example @xcite shows that the 3-point function of the fields adds an unobservably small contribution to the bispectrum around hubble exit assuming slow roll inflation with a standard kinetic term of the scalar fields , while @xcite show that the 4-point function of the fields adds an unobservably small contribution to the trispectrum around hubble exit under the same assumptions .",
    "working to zeroth order in slow roll implies that ( [ cfreefields ] ) holds and that the 3-point function of the fields is zero .",
    "so although working to lowest order in slow roll is not the same as working with gaussian field perturbations , in practice the conditions are related .",
    "hence when assuming that the field perturbations have a gaussian distribution at hubble exit we will also work at zeroth order in slow roll .",
    "it is likely that any observable amount of non - gaussianity can be calculated to sufficiently high accuracy when making these two approximations , assuming a standard kinetic term .      assuming that the fields are uncorrelated gaussian variables , with identical distributions , as discussed above , the two point function of the fields is given by [ varphicorrelation ] _",
