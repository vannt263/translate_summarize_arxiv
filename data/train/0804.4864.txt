    "a hot , dense non - hadronic matter has been created at rhic in ultra - relativistic heavy ion collision@xcite@xcite .",
    "the anisotropic flow coefficients @xmath0 and @xmath1 provide sensitive information about the properties of the matter in the earliest stages of the heavy - ion collisions . the @xmath0 of identified hadrons has been found to obey empirical scaling with the number of constituent quarks ( ncq ) for @xmath7 and provides evidence that partonic degrees of freedom determine the early dynamics of the system@xcite . in this work",
    ", the measurement of @xmath1 will be used to further test this scaling .",
    "the @xmath1/@xmath4 ratio has been proposed as a probe of ideal hydrodynamics and related to the degree of thermalization@xcite in the system .",
    "accurate measurements of identified particles @xmath1/@xmath4 ratio will constrain the model calculations . the measurement of high @xmath2 identified hadron @xmath0 will allow us to test the limits of the ncq scaling . if the anisotropic emission of particles in the high @xmath2 region is dominated by parton energy loss , the ncq scaling is expected to break since the energy loss mechanism affects all particle species similarly@xcite@xcite .",
    "determining the breaking point in the ncq scaling will provide information on the limits of applicability of the hydrodynamic description of the system dynamics .",
    "during run 7 of rhic , the phenix experiment recorded 5.5 b minimum - bias 200 gev au @xmath8 au collision events and 2.2 b have been used for this work .",
    "two new subsystem detectors were installed prior to run 7 , which significantly enhanced the phenix capabilities for identified particle anisotropic flow measurements .",
    "a time of flight detector(tofw ) was installed in the west arm of the phenix spectrometer . with @xmath9 ps intrinsic timing resolution",
    ", the tofw detector allows pion / kaon separation up to @xmath2@xmath32.8 gev/@xmath10 , and kaon / proton separation up to @xmath2@xmath34.5 gev/@xmath10 . together with the previously installed aerogel cherenkov counter ( acc ) ,",
    "the tofw detector provides high @xmath2 hadron identification in phenix .",
    "combining the photon yield measured in the acc and the mass - squared from tofw , the kaon identification is extended to @xmath2@xmath11 gev/@xmath10 , while the pion and proton identification reaches @xmath12gev/@xmath10 .",
    "phenix was also upgraded with a new reaction plane detector ( rxnp ) which covers the rapidity region @xmath13 with best resolution around @xmath14 for @xmath0 measurements .",

    "figure 1 shows the @xmath1 of pions , kaons and protons in the @xmath15 centrality bin in 200 gev au+au collisions . in the left plot , the @xmath1",
    "is shown as a function of @xmath2 . a clear mass ordering is observed for pions , kaons and protons , which is consistent with hydrodynamics behavior which has been previously observed for the elliptic flow . in the middle plot ,",
    "the @xmath1 measurements are presented as a function of transverse kinetic energy @xmath7 = @xmath19-@xmath20 . in this unit",
    ", the mass ordering disappears at low @xmath7 which is consistent with hydrodynamic predictions . for @xmath7",
    "greater than about 0.5 gev , kaons and pions show much less @xmath1 than protons .",
    "a universal behavior for baryons and mesons is observed when @xmath7 is divided by the @xmath21 ( number of constituent quarks ) and the @xmath1 values are divided by the @xmath22 .",
    "this universal behavior has also been observed in the measurements of @xmath0 for identified hadrons@xcite .",
    "the results presented here further strengthen the conclusion that partonic flow has been built up in the early stages of the heavy - ion collisions at rhic .",
    "figure 2 shows the @xmath23 ratio for pions , kaons and protons as a function of @xmath2 in the @xmath15 centrality bin .",
    "this ratio is flat with @xmath2 in the measured range and is independent of the particle species within errors .",
    "we analyze the results in terms of a simple coalescence model : @xmath24 where @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 represent the meson , baryon and quark @xmath1 respectively , and @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 represent the meson , baryon and quark @xmath0 . using the measured @xmath23 ratio around 0.9 for both baryons and mesons , from equations ( 1a ) and ( 1b ) , we obtain that the parton @xmath31 ratio is around 0.5 and the parameter @xmath32 is around 1.8 .",
    "this result indicates that a thermalized partonic liquid has been produced at rhic .    using the high @xmath2 elliptic flow results , we can study the limits of applicability of the hydrodynamic description .",
    "figure 3 shows the @xmath0 of pions , kaons and protons as a function of @xmath7 in two centrality bins .",
    "both @xmath0 and @xmath7 have been divided by the @xmath21 .",
    "the left plot is the result in the @xmath18 centrality bin , and the right plot is the result in the @xmath15 centrality bin . in @xmath15 collisions ,",
    "the ncq scaling begins to break as the @xmath7/@xmath21 exceeds @xmath31 gev .",
    "this indicates that the origin of the @xmath0 is based in hydrodynamics collective flow and parton recombination in the low @xmath7 region , but above @xmath33 gev , the contribution from parton energy loss become increasingly important .",
    "the measurements of pion , kaon and proton @xmath0 and @xmath1 have been extended up to a @xmath2 of 6 gev / c and 4 gev / c respectively by phenix .",
    "the ncq scaling has been tested for @xmath1 and been found to hold for @xmath7/@xmath21 up to 1 gev , indicating that partonic flow governs the bulk dynamics in heavy - ion collisions at rhic .",
    "the mesons and baryons have a similar ratio of @xmath23 , which is consistent with expectations for a thermalized partonic system in which hadrons at the intermediate @xmath2 region are produced by parton recombination .",
    "the @xmath0 measurement shows that the ncq scaling begins to break for @xmath7/@xmath21 above 1 gev in the @xmath15 centrality class , which suggests that hard - scattering may be the dominant production mechanism for both baryons and mesons in this @xmath7/@xmath21 range and thus parton energy loss effects play a significant role in generating the azimuthal anisotropy in particle emission .",
