    "already at the dawn of the quantum era it was realized that properties of quantum systems crucially depend on their classical dynamics . while the eigenvalues of integrable systems can be explicitly related to the set of integer numbers by the bohr - sommerfeld quantisation rules no such regular structure exists for systems with complex dynamics . at first sight , the energy spectrum of complex systems like nuclei resembles a structureless set of random numbers very much dependent on particularities of the system .",
    "this , however , turns out to be not entirely true .",
    "the famous wigner - dyson - mehta conjecture asserts that the spectrum of complex quantum systems on the scales of the mean level spacing between eigenvalues is universal and can be described by random matrix ensembles within the same symmetry class . in particular , all @xmath1-point correlation functions of eigenvalues can be derived analytically by using random matrix theory ( rmt ) .",
    "indeed , such spectral statistics have been observed in many real and numerical experiments with various systems ranging from compound nuclei to complex molecules and atoms .",
    "furthermore , it was realized in the early 1980s that even single - particle systems generically exhibit the same universality if their classical dynamics are chaotic . in the last three decades",
    "a substantial progress has been achieved in understanding of the origins of this universality through the application of the semiclassical theory to quantum chaotic systems . in particular",
    ", the gutzwiller s trace formula allows to express eigenvalue density function through the sum of unstable classical periodic orbits . by using this representation the correlations between system eigenenergies",
    "can be straightforwardly related to the correlations between actions of periodic orbits .",
    "this approach was pioneered by m.  berry in the seminal paper  @xcite , where the diagonal correlations between periodic orbits were taken into account .",
    "it was also noted there and in subsequent works  @xcite that in order to obtain the full rmt result one would need to include non - trivial correlations between periodic orbits as well .    on the quantitative level",
    "the non - trivial correlations between periodic orbits were first taken into account in the groundbreaking work of m.  sieber and k.  richter  @xcite . on the basis of classical chaotic dynamics they demonstrated existence of periodic orbit pairs with close actions . generally speaking ,",
    "such orbits traverse approximately the same points of the configuration space but in a different time order . by including the _ sieber - richter pairs _ , and their natural generalizations it turned out to be possible to derive the full rmt result for universal spectral correlations  @xcite .",
    "so far , however , this remarkable progress has by and large been restricted to the systems composed of just few particles .",
    "although , formally hamiltonian system of @xmath0 particles in @xmath2 dimensions can be thought as just one particle in @xmath3 dimension , such dynamical interpretation does not allow to use automatically the `` single - particle '' semiclassical theory when @xmath0 grows simultaneously with @xmath4 .",
    "this is because the standard semiclassical limit assumes a fixed dimensionality of the system while the effective planck s constant @xmath5 tends to zero .",
    "another , often considered `` semiclassical '' theory corresponds to the thermodynamic limit , where @xmath6 but @xmath5 is fixed .",
    "as can be clearly seen on the example of bosonic systems , this limit essentially differs from the one where @xmath0 is fixed and @xmath7  @xcite .",
    "indeed for interacting bosons the two limits correspond to very different classical hamiltonians associated with the first and the second quantisation of the problem , respectively . at the present ,",
    "very little is known about the limit where the number of particles @xmath0 and the effective dimension @xmath8 of the one - particle hilbert space grow simultaneously .",
    "this is especially frustrating considering that the original wigner s conjecture relates to many particle systems .",
    "one might wonder whether the `` single - particle '' correlation mechanism between periodic orbits is still relevant for @xmath0-particle chaotic systems .",
    "_ do these correlations lead to a spectral universality , when @xmath0 is large ? at which energy scales ?",
    "does the answer depend on the details of the hamiltonian ? _",
    "the central goal of the present paper is to show that @xmath0-particle chaotic systems with local nearest - neighbor interactions allow a more general correlation mechanism between periodic orbit actions then one which is known for one particle systems . by using the one - particle interpretation of classical dynamics",
    "it is easy to demonstrate that standard partner orbits ( e.g. , sieber - richter pairs ) exist for an arbitrary @xmath0 .",
    "as expected , these pairs of periodic orbits closely approach each other in the large @xmath3 dimensional configuration space .",
    "it turns out , however , that completely different classes of periodic orbit pairs with close actions exist , as well .",
    "in particular , these non - standard pairs traverse completely different points of the large configuration space .",
    "as we show in the body of the paper , they can be interpreted as two - dimensional extensions of standard sieber - richter pairs , where periodic orbits sweep surfaces rather then lines in the small configuration space of the corresponding single - particle system . from the semiclassical point of view",
    "the contributions from new families of correlating orbits should become dominant over the standard one whenever the number of particles @xmath0 exceeds certain threshold value which depends logarithmically on @xmath8 .",
    "we believe that in this regime it is essential to take them into account in order to construct a proper semiclassical theory .",
    "the paper is structured in the following order . in the next section we present our main ideas on the heuristic level .",
    "the emerging mechanism of correlations between periodic orbits is then discussed in the framework of the particular model of _ coupled cat maps_. this model is introduced in section 3 where we also describe its main dynamical properties . in section 4 a special duality relation between periodic orbits is introduced .",
    "implications for periodic orbit correlations and few remarkable mathematical identities stemming from this duality are discussed here . in section 5",
    "we describe general mechanism of correlations between periodic orbits and provide exhausting numerical evidence of its existence .",
    "we explicitly construct a number of periodic orbit pairs with small action differences . a general formula for action differences within such pairs of orbits",
    "is derived here .",
    "the implications of symmetries on the orbit correlations are studied in section 6 . in section 7",
    "we extend our results to the perturbed maps .",
    "finally , in section 8 we discuss the relevance of our results for generic many - particle systems with local homogeneous interactions and its implications for a semiclassical quantum theory .",
    "in the present work our attention is focused on chaotic systems of @xmath0-particles with local homogeneous interactions . to be more specific , let us write a prototype hamiltonian which governs the dynamics of suchlike systems : @xmath9 here @xmath10 is the particle coordinate belonging to a target space @xmath11 e.g. , @xmath12 and @xmath13 is the corresponding momentum .",
    "since the energy of the system is preserved , the dynamics of ( [ hamiltonian ] ) is restricted to the @xmath14 energy shell @xmath15 , determined by the conditions @xmath16 .",
    "note that @xmath17 is manifestly invariant under the cyclic shift @xmath18 of the particle numbers .",
    "in addition to the shift invariance we will assume that the dynamics induced by @xmath17 on @xmath15 are fully hyperbolic .",
    "the last requirement implies that the derivative of the hamiltonian flow has exactly @xmath19 positive lyapunov exponents in almost every point of @xmath15 .",
    "informally speaking , the above hamiltonian describes a closed string of particles uniformly interacting with their neighbors and an external potential @xmath20 such that the resulting dynamics are chaotic .",
    "one possible realization of such hamiltonian is provided by a boltzmann gas type model shown in fig .",
    "[ bolzmann]a .",
    "the hamiltonians of the type ( [ hamiltonian ] ) also appear naturally in connection with the spin chain models and interacting bosons on a circular lattice .",
    "for instance , the bose - hubbard hamiltonian written in the second quantisation language : @xmath21 can be cast into the form similar to ( [ hamiltonian ] ) after substitution @xmath22 , where @xmath23 and @xmath24 should be interpreted as the coordinate and the momentum operators of the @xmath25-th harmonic oscillator .",
    "given some initial conditions the time evolution of a @xmath0-particle system can be represented as collection @xmath26 of one particle trajectories @xmath27 , @xmath28 in the one - particle @xmath29-dimensional phase space @xmath30 . in what follows",
    "we will refer to @xmath31 as _ many - particle orbit _ and as _ many - particle periodic orbit _ ( mpo ) if @xmath31 is closed i.e. , @xmath32 , @xmath28 after a period @xmath33 .",
    "rather then treating evolution as a continues flow , it is convenient to discretize dynamics by introducing a discrete poincare map acting on a section of the phase space . to this end",
    "we fix a poincare section @xmath34 which is a @xmath14 dimensional hypersurface invariant under the shift @xmath35 , see eq .",
    "( [ sigma1 ] ) , and observe the system at the discrete moments of time @xmath36 , @xmath37 when many particle orbit @xmath31 pierces @xmath34 . for the system shown in fig .",
    "[ bolzmann]a one possible choice for the poincare section would be to set it in accordance with the pairwise collisions of the balls . in this case",
    "@xmath36 would correspond to the moments of time when balls collide with each other .",
    "the above procedure defines the poincare map @xmath38 acting on the @xmath39 dimensional phase space @xmath40 , obtained by the intersection of @xmath34 with the the energy shell .    under the action of @xmath38 any mpo @xmath41 of the system ( [ hamiltonian ] )",
    "can be naturally seen in two different ways .",
    "first , @xmath41 can be thought as collection of the points in the @xmath0-particle phase space @xmath42 registered at the discretized moments of time : @xmath43 in other words the evolution of the whole system can be seen as propagation of one particle in the `` large '' phase space @xmath42 .",
    "accordingly @xmath44 is naturally interpreted as a discretized one dimensional line .",
    "such a reduction to one particle system is a widely used tool in dynamical systems .",
    "for example it allows to treat the boltzmann gas as a many - dimensional billiard @xcite .",
    "the second conceptually different way is to look at @xmath41 as a set of @xmath45 points in the `` small '' single - particle phase space @xmath46 : @xmath47 where @xmath48 marks the position of the nth particle at discrete moment of times @xmath49 . for the sake of convenience of presentation",
    "it is instructive to introduce the map @xmath50 which attaches to each point @xmath51 of the discrete `` particle - time '' space @xmath52 the corresponding point @xmath53 of the phase space @xmath46 . with such notation",
    "we have @xmath54    in a ( properly scaled ) continuous limit @xmath55 the time evolution of the above many - particle system can be seen on an intuitive level as the propagation of a one dimensional closed string @xmath56 , where @xmath57 $ ] measures the length along it and @xmath58 is continues time parameter .",
    "accordingly , any periodic orbit of a period @xmath33 can be represented by a two dimensional torus swept by @xmath59 in @xmath46 during the time @xmath60 $ ] .",
    "this contrasts with the single - particle interpretation where periodic orbits of the system are naturally represented by one dimensional lines .",
    "it should be emphasized that we actually neither require the interaction between particles be attractive nor we consider the continues limit .",
    "so the resulting time evolution of the system might be very different from a string - like motion where all particles keep a linear order in the target space .",
    "nevertheless , regarding the correlation mechanism between periodic orbits it turns out to be quite useful to think about a mpo @xmath41 as of discretized two dimensional surface @xmath61 in the one - particle phase space @xmath46 ( rather then one dimensional line @xmath44 in the many - particle space @xmath42 ) .      before focusing on the action correlations between periodic orbits in many - particle systems ,",
    "let us briefly recall the correlation mechanism in one particle hamiltonians @xcite .",
    "a sufficiently long periodic orbit typically has a number of self - encounters .",
    "these are the stretches of the trajectory where it closely approaches itself in the configuration space , see fig .",
    "[ encounter ] . for a trajectory possessing sufficiently long encounters the hyperbolic nature of the dynamics guarantees existence of several ( the exact number depends on the encounter structure ) of partner periodic orbits which traverse approximately the same points of the phase space , but make different switches at the encounters .",
    "the action differences between the partners are accumulated primarily at the encounter stretches and decrease exponentially with their lengths .",
    "accordingly , the periodic orbits of a hyperbolic system can be organized into families , where all members have approximately the same actions .",
    "a)1.5 cm b )     a)1.5 cm b )      the intuitive description of the above correlation mechanism between periodic orbits can be formalized by making use of symbolic dynamics @xcite . within this approach",
    "the first step is to fix a poincare section and consider the discretized time evolution . assuming that the reduced phase space of the system allows a finite markov partition @xmath62 , any trajectory @xmath63 can be encoded by a doubly infinite sequence of symbols from some alphabet @xmath64 of a finite size : @xmath65 here each symbol @xmath66 registers the position of the particle with respect to the partition at the discrete time @xmath67 , i.e. , @xmath66 equals to @xmath68 if @xmath69 .",
    "correspondingly , a @xmath1-periodic orbit @xmath63 can be associated with a cyclic sequence of the length @xmath1 : @xmath70 , \\qquad a_i\\in\\a.\\ ] ] on the level of symbolic dynamics each _",
    "@xmath71-encounter _ of the length @xmath72 in @xmath63 is a string of @xmath72 symbols @xmath73 which appears in @xmath74 a number @xmath75 of times , see fig .",
    "[ encounter_str1]a . given a periodic sequence @xmath74 its pair sequence @xmath76 is constructed by rearranging the encounters and stretches of symbols connecting them in a way that any subsequence of consecutive @xmath72 symbols existing in @xmath74 reappears in @xmath76 exactly the same number of times and vice versa . since the approximate position of a point in the phase space",
    "is determined by a finite string of symbols , the above property guarantees that the corresponding orbits traverse approximately the same points of the phase space .",
    "for instance , the following two sequences : @xmath77 , \\qquad a_{\\bar{\\gamma}}=[ae_1be_2ce_1de_2],\\label{symbrepres}\\ ] ] with the encounters @xmath78 , @xmath79 of some length @xmath72 and stretches @xmath80 , @xmath81 , @xmath82 , @xmath2 of an arbitrary length connecting them provide the symbolic representation of partner orbits shown on fig .",
    "[ encounter]b .",
    "structurally different families of partner orbits @xmath83 can be distinguished by their diagrams @xmath84 accounting for different order of encounters .",
    "each of the diagrams is obtained by substituting encounters of @xmath63 with the points and placing them ( in the same linear order ) on a circle @xmath85 .",
    "the points belonging to the same encounters are then identified ( i.e. , @xmath85 is `` glued '' to itself at these points ) , see fig .",
    "[ encounter_str1]b .",
    "the resulting graph @xmath84 carries all structural information on the correlations between the partner orbits @xmath83 . in particular , it defines the number of partner orbits within the family .",
    "it worth mentioning that in the semiclassical theory based on the correlations between periodic orbits such graphs can be associated with feynman diagrams of the corresponding sigma model @xcite .",
    "we turn now our attention to the @xmath0-particle systems with the local type of interactions ( [ hamiltonian ] ) . at the beginning of this section",
    "we argued that in the limit of continuous @xmath0 the periodic orbits of such a system can be regarded as two - dimensional surfaces in the phase space .",
    "taking this as a guiding principle let us first analyze on an intuitive level its implications on the correlation mechanism between periodic orbit actions . by the analogy with the single - particle case , we demand that the two surfaces corresponding to some pair of partner periodic orbits @xmath86 pass through approximately the same points of the phase space i.e. , @xmath87 for this to happen each periodic orbit must have at least one @xmath71-encounter , which is an element of the configuration space where the surface approaches itself sufficiently closely for a number @xmath88 times , see fig .",
    "[ surface ] .",
    "the existence of the encounter implies that there are @xmath71 disjoint domains @xmath89 related to each other by the translation shift @xmath90 : @xmath91 such that all domains are mapped into approximately the same points of the target space @xmath42 : @xmath92 conversely , whenever a closed surface possesses encounters it might be possible to find a pair surface traversing almost the same points of the phase space .",
    "therefore , the problem of classifying structurally different families of correlating mpos can be on a geometrical level understood as one of finding all topologically non - equivalent ways to `` glue '' a two - dimensional surface to itself .",
    "this is very much similar to the single - particle case where we need to classify the non - trivial ways to `` glue '' one - dimensional lines .",

    "note that we do not require the opposite i.e. , there might be 2d sequences of symbols which do not correspond to any real mpo .    whether or not there exists",

    "first recall that by definition partner mpos @xmath114 pass through approximately the same points of the phase space .",

    "how many periodic orbits @xmath41 posses a given topological structure @xmath363 .",
    "the amount of such orbits is determined by the number of possibilities to choose the encounter sets @xmath367 within the prescribed topological order . as we argue below this , in turn , depends on the winding numbers @xmath135 of @xmath368 s and their widths @xmath13 .",
    "note that systematic contribution into the sum ( [ formfac ] ) comes from the terms for which @xmath365 is of the same order as @xmath5 .",
    "this fixes the scale of encounter width as @xmath369 .",
    "consider now an encounter set having the winding numbers @xmath143 , i.e. , winding around the torus in the particle direction .",
    "such a set occupies at least @xmath370 points of @xmath131 .",
    "analogously , for encounters with winding numbers @xmath144 , @xmath145 the minimal number of points is given by @xmath371 and @xmath372 , respectively .",
    "it is easy to see that the number of periodic orbits with the fixed symbols at the encounter domains @xmath367 grows exponentially with the total number of points of @xmath131 outside of the encounter sets . from this",
    "we can immediately conclude that for @xmath373 most of the periodic orbits have encounters of the type @xmath143 , since they occupy the minimal `` area '' of @xmath131 .",
    "for such parameters @xmath374 the correlations between actions of mpos can be understood just by interpreting the system dynamics as single - particle motion in many - dimensional phase space .",
    "in other words in this regime the semiclassical theory of many - particle systems should be the same as for single - particle systems with chaotic dynamics .",
    "in the regime @xmath375 the dominating encounter type of periodic orbits is @xmath144 and the clustering mechanism is dual to the previous one .",
    "this means that correlations between actions of periodic orbits can be accounted by utilizing single - particle theory with the parameters @xmath0 and @xmath164 exchanged . finally in the case",
    "when both parameters are `` large '' : @xmath376 most of the periodic orbits posses encounters with zero winding numbers @xmath145 . in this case the correlations between actions of mpos can not be accounted on the basis of single - particle interpretation of the system dynamics .",
    "for this regime a new genuine many - particle semiclassical theory has to be constructed .",
    "the theory proposed in this paper has been constructed and verified in the framework of a specific model of coupled lattice maps .",
    "one might wonder whether it carries over to the hamiltonian systems with continues time evolution .",
    "we believe that the main results hold also for generic hamiltonians of the form ( [ hamiltonian ] ) provided that the dynamics are chaotic . in order to clarify this point consider , as an example , a many - particle periodic orbit @xmath377 where @xmath378 $ ] now continues time and the coordinates @xmath379 satisfy the system of @xmath0 newtonian equations generated by the hamiltonian ( [ hamiltonian ] ) .",
    "assume that @xmath380 has an encounter domain with the frame - like structure shown in fig .",
    "[ encounter3 ] . in the coordinate form",
    "this means that for @xmath381 we have an approximate equality @xmath382 , where @xmath383 are the points of the shifted encounter set .",
    "( for sufficiently large @xmath164 and @xmath0 such encounters should exist just by statistical reasons . )",
    "let us now construct another trajectory following the rules for search of partner orbits . to this end",
    "define : @xmath384 it is now a straightforward observation following from the locality of the hamiltonian interactions that the set of trajectories @xmath385 approximately satisfies the equations of motion .",
    "it follows then from the shadowing lemma for flows of chaotic systems @xcite that a real periodic orbit close to @xmath386 should exist . by construction",
    "this new orbit is the partner of @xmath380 .",
    "taking a step further one can also question whether discretization in the particle direction might be left out as well .",
    "making @xmath1 continues naturally leads to a field model , where the field @xmath387 satisfies some homogeneous differential equation and the continues parameter @xmath388 $ ] plays the role of @xmath1 . assuming that the resulting dynamics are chaotic it can be expected that periodic solutions @xmath389 of the differential equation posses similar properties as mpos in the coupled lattice maps . in particular",
    "we expect that the mechanism of correlations between mpos carries over to @xmath389 .",
    "we believe that this correlation mechanism can be of importance for development of the semiclassical approach to the corresponding quantum field theory .",
    "another natural extension of the present setup arises if the particles are ordered with respect to the d - dimensional lattice i.e. , @xmath390 , @xmath391 rather then to the one - dimensional @xmath392 . in this case",
    "propagating mpos sweep @xmath393-dimensional `` surfaces '' in the one - particle phase space .",
    "it would be of interest to study how the dimension @xmath2 affects the correlation mechanism between mpos .",
    "periodic orbits of chaotic systems can be organized into clusters of partner orbits where all elements have approximately the same actions .",
    "the clustering phenomena plays a crucial role for the semiclassical theory .",
    "so far however , it has been studied only on the level of effectively `` single - particle '' systems . in the present work we considered clustering mechanism among periodic orbits of fully chaotic many - particle systems which",
    "dynamics are governed by translation - invariant hamiltonians with local interactions . on the heuristic level",
    "periodic orbits in such systems can be visualized by discretized two - dimensional `` surfaces '' in the one - particle configuration space .",
    "a more rigorous description is achieved by using symbolic dynamics .",
    "contrary to the single - particle formalism , where periodic orbits are encoded by linear symbolic sequences , here the symbolic representation is provided by 2d toric arrays of symbols .",
    "a periodic orbit @xmath41 has a partner @xmath122 when its symbolic representation @xmath115 has at least one @xmath71-encounter - a 2d subsequence of symbols repeating itself for @xmath75 of times .",
    "the symbolic representations @xmath116 of the partner orbits are then obtained by rearrangement of symbols @xmath115 in accordance to certain prescription .",
    "the differences between actions of @xmath41 and its partners accumulate mainly in the encounter regions and decrease exponentially with their width .",
    "different families of partner orbits can be distinguished by the corresponding topological structure diagrams .",
    "each structure is represented by a toroidal surface glued to itself along a number of one - dimensional lines representing the encounters . the diagrams with encounters winding around torus torus only in the particle direction are the ones which obtained in the single - particle interpretation of classical dynamics .",
    "the other structural diagrams are essentially different .",
    "they represent partner periodic orbits whose correlation mechanism differs from one found in single - particle systems .",
    "these new families of partner orbits seem to be essential for construction of a proper semiclassical theory in the case when the number of particles is sufficiently large .",
