    "`` spintronics '' is a new paradigm of electronics based on the spin - dependent charge transport in magnetic heterostructures .  @xcite it has emerged as one of the most active research fields in recent years because of the potential advantages of non - volatility , faster processing speed , small power dissipation for high - density device integration as opposed to conventional semiconducting systems ,  @xcite and better coherence promising for quantum information technology .",
    "@xcite    among the physics issues associated with spintronics , knowledge of spin - polarized quantum tunneling and transport across interfaces is particularly important for developing high quality and reproducible spintronic devices .",
    "from the perspective of materials , ferromagnets with higher degrees of spin polarization and higher curie temperatures are desirable candidates for use in spintronic devices . in this context , the manganese oxides @xmath4 ( ln : trivalent rare earth ions , a : divalent alkaline earth ions ) , also widely known as manganites that exhibit colossal magnetoresistance ( cmr ) effects ,  @xcite appear to be promising spintronic materials because of their half - metallicity in the ferromagnetic state  @xcite so that the degree of spin polarization is nearly 100% . nonetheless , experimental data and theoretical calculations have suggested that the ground states of the manganites tend to be intrinsically inhomogeneous as the result of their strong tendencies toward phase separation , and the phase separation may involve domains of ferromagnetic metals , ferromagnetic insulators , and antiferromagnetic charge and orbital ordered insulators .",
    "@xcite in fact , it has been demonstrated numerically that the double exchange interaction and half - metallicity alone can not account for the large magnitude of negative magnetoresistance in ferromagnetic manganites ,  @xcite and that the tendencies toward phase separation in the ground state even for the nominally metalltic ferromagnetic phases play an essential role in the occurrence of the cmr effects .",
    "@xcite from the viewpoint of technological applications , the intrinsic electronic heterogeneity of the manganites becomes a relevant concern for consistently fabricating miniaturized spintronic devices with high areal densities . in this",
    "context , understanding of the spatial varying physical characteristics of the manganites at the microscopic scale will be important for spintronic applications based on these materials .",
    "in addition to the tendency toward phase separation in bulk manganites , various experimental findings have suggested that the surfaces of manganites appear to differ from the bulk characteristics .",
    "@xcite for instance , scanning tunneling spectroscopic ( sts ) studies of nominally metallic manganite epitaxial thin films  @xcite and single crystals  @xcite have always revealed either a small energy gap or a pseudogap near the fermi surface . although the occurrence of an energy gap in a nominally metallic manganite could not be explained by either bandstructure calculations  @xcite or bulk electrical transport measurements ,  @xcite the tunneling spectra of the metallic manganite over a wide energy range except near the fermi level were actually consistent with theoretical calculations of the bulk electronic density of states .",
    "@xcite hence , it is reasonable to conjecture that the surface of manganites may be a thin layer with chemical compositions differing from those of the bulk .",
    "thus , lower - bias ballistic electrons injected from the scanning tunneling microscopy ( stm ) tip could be more sensitive to the surface state , whereas ballistic electrons injected with higher - bias could penetrate deeper into the bulk .",
    "in other words , the spectroscopic characteristics at higher bias voltages may be more representative of the bulk density of states , whereas those at lower bias voltages may be better related to the surface state .",
    "this conjecture is consistent with the x - ray photoemission spectroscopic ( xps ) studies of @xmath5 that inferred a surface predominantly terminated by an insulating layer of @xmath6 .",
    "@xcite    another interesting feature associated with the manganites is the occurrence of pseudogap ( pg ) phenomena .",
    "@xcite theoretical studies using monte carlo simulations  @xcite suggest that the density of states ( dos ) in the manganites should exhibit pg characteristics , with significant spectral depletion at the chemical potential and broad dos peaks both above and below the chemical potential .",
    "these theoretical findings have been corroborated by photoemission experiments on bilayer manganites above their magnetic ordering temperatures .",
    "@xcite theoretically , the occurrence of pg may be regarded as a precursor of phase separations in forms of magnetic clusters ,  @xcite which is analogous to the widely studied pg phenomena in cuprate superconductors where the appearance of pg is attributed to the onset of preformed pairs and competing orders .",
    "@xcite however , whether the pg phenomena are common among different types of manganites and whether the physical origin of pg in the manganites is indeed associated with the onset of mixed phases have not been extensively verified by experiments .",
    "to address the aforementioned issues of phase separations , insulating surface layers and the pg phenomena in the manganites , we report in this work spatially resolved tunneling spectroscopic studies of @xmath0 ( lcmo ) epitaxial films by means of both regular and spin - polarized scanning tunneling microscopy  @xcite ( stm and sp - stm ) .",
    "the specific calcium doping level of @xmath7 was chosen because it corresponded to a nominal metallic phase with nearly the highest curie temperature ( @xmath8 k ) and the most spatial homogeneity among the ca - doped manganites .",
    "the evolution of the spatially resolved tunneling spectra was studied systematically with temperature , magnetic field and the degree of spin polarization , which provided information about the spatial scales of stoichiometric inhomogeneity and the average size of ferromagnetic domains .",
    "additionally , comparison with bandstructure calculations suggested that the spectral characteristics taken with regular stm were consistent with those of the dos of the manganite , whereas data taken with sp - stm may be understood in terms of the product of a spin - dependent tunneling matrix and the joint density of states between the sp - stm tip material and the manganite . on the other hand ,",
    "the evolution of the surface energy gap with temperature , magnetic field and the degree of spin - polarization was found to be consistent with the spin filtering effect of a surface ferromagnetic insulating ( fi ) phase .",
    "@xcite finally , pg phenomena were found to persist at temperatures well above all magnetic ordering temperatures in the absence of external magnetic fields .",
    "the pg features were suppressed by moderate magnetic fields at low temperatures when the tunneling conductance of lcmo became spatially homogeneous .",

    "therefore , when the applied field exceeded the coercive field of the cr - coated tip , the spin - polarized tunneling from the cr - coated tip to nind became forbidden near the fermi level , yielding nearly zero tunneling conductance .",
    "the coercive field thus determined is @xmath24 t.,width=326 ]    the findings presented in this work provide quantitative experimental accounts for the presence of phase separations , surface states and pg phenomena in the manganites . in comparison with other stm studies of the manganites , while previous investigations have revealed spatially inhomogeneous spectra in manganites with different doping levels ,  @xcite this work provides the first high - field sp - stm studies on the manganites and demonstrates the general application of high - field sp - stm techniques to the investigation of spatially inhomogeneous magnetic materials .",
    "the @xmath0 ( lcmo ) films used in this study were epitaxially grown on @xmath1 substrates by means of pulsed laser deposition ( pld ) techniques .",
    "the substrates were chosen because of their small lattice mismatch ( about 0.3% ) with the bulk lcmo , which ensures minimized strain in the resulting films to prevent excess strain - induced effects on the electronic properties .",
    "@xcite the films were deposited in a 100 mtorr oxygen background pressure to a thickness of @xmath25 nm with the substrate temperature kept at 650@xmath26c , and were subsequently annealed at the same temperature for 2 hours in 100 torr o@xmath27 and then cooled slowly to room temperature .",
    "the epitaxy of these films was confirmed by x - ray diffraction , and the film quality was further verified by atomic force microscopy and stm measurements , showing terraced growth with step heights corresponding to one c - axis lattice constant of the bulk lcmo , as exemplified in fig .",
    "[ fig1](a ) .",
    "further characterizations were conducted using a superconducting - quantum - interference - device ( squid ) magnetometer by quantum design for magnetization measurments , showing a curie temperature of @xmath28 k as exemplified in fig .",
    "[ fig1](b ) for one of the lcmo epitaxial films .",
    "additionally , the coercive fields of the lcmo films ( @xmath29 ) for magnetic fields perpendicular to the plane of films were determined by the squid magnetometer , and were found to range from 0.02 t to 0.04 t as exemplified in fig .",
    "[ fig1](c ) . in general ,",
    "lcmo thin films fabricated under aforementioned conditions have been shown to yield high - quality epitaxy via high - resolution x - ray diffraction studies , magnetization and transport measurements .",
    "@xcite    prior to stm measurements , samples were first etched in a 0.5% bromine in pure ethanol solution and then rinsed in pure ethanol to remove surface contaminants such as the carbonates . each etched sample",
    "was immediately loaded onto our cryogenic stm system while kept under excess pressure of helium gas during the loading process .",
    "it is worth noting that the presence of surface contaminants is common among the perovskite oxides that contain alkaline earth metals ( a = ca , sr and ba ) because the alkaline earth elements are highly reative to h@xmath27o and co@xmath27 .",
    "@xcite consequently , the removal of surface non - stoichiometric alkaline earth compounds such as ao , aco@xmath30 and a(oh)@xmath27 upon chemical etching and ethonal rinsing would tend to yield slight ca - deficiency on the sample surface relative to its bulk stoichiometry unless long - time etching was carried out .",
    "@xcite further , sample surfaces without proper removal of the contaminants often exhibit excess concentrations of alkaline earth metals in the xps studies .",
    "@xcite    the tunneling studies were conducted with our homemade cryogenic stm with a base temperature @xmath23 k and a superconducting magnet capable of magnetic fields up to @xmath31 t. at @xmath23 k the stm system was under ultra - high vacuum with a base pressure @xmath32 mbar .",
    "regular tunneling spectroscopic studies were conducted with atomically sharp pt / ir tips , while spin polarized studies were made by means of pt / ir tips evaporatively coated with 15 @xmath33 30 monolayers of cr metal prepared in a separate evaporation system , following the procedures reported previously .",
    "@xcite here we note that thin - film cr is ferromagnetic ,  @xcite and the curie temperature ( @xmath34 ) of our cr - coated tip was found to be much higher than room temperature .",
    "therefore , it is justifiable to assume that electrical currents from the cr - coated tip were always spin - polarized .",
    "this assumption was subsequently verified by field - dependent tunneling conductance measurements , and the degree of spin polarization ( @xmath35% ) was also estimated , as elaborated in section iii .",
    "the coercive field ( @xmath36 ) of the cr - coated tips was empirically determined by studying the tunneling conductance vs. magnetic field @xmath15 for electrical currents tunneling from the cr - coated tip to a permanent magnet ndni .",
    "the magnetization of ndni was opposite to the applied magnetic field , so that for fields exceeding the coercive field of the cr - coated tip , tunneling from the spin - polarized tip to ndni became forbidden near the fermi level and the tunneling conductance approached zero , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1](d ) for small bias voltages at @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 mv .",
    "the @xmath36 value thus determined was @xmath37 t , comparable to the values determined by similar tunneling conductance measurements outlined in refs .  .",
    "thus , we have established the condition @xmath38 t for all cr - coated tips .        in the following studies ,",
    "the stm system was operated at @xmath23 k for @xmath39 , @xmath40 t , and 3.0 t , and also at @xmath41 k and 300 k for @xmath39 . both pt / ir and",
    "cr - coated tips were used in these studies .",
    "therefore , the field - dependent studies were carried out at @xmath42 and under three conditions : @xmath39 , @xmath43 with @xmath44 , and @xmath45 with @xmath46 .",
    "these conditions ensured that the effects of spin - polarized currents were investigated for three different magnetic configurations in lcmo , which are 1 ) randomly oriented magnetic domains , 2 ) aligned lcmo magnetic domains that were anti - parallel to the spin - polarized current , and 3 ) aligned lcmo magnetic domains that were parallel to the spin polarized current .",
    "the spectroscopic measurements consisted of tunneling current ( @xmath47 ) versus bias voltage ( @xmath48 ) spectra taken from @xmath49 v to 3 v at each pixel on a @xmath50 pixel grid located over a @xmath51 area for zero - field studies at 77 k and 300 k. on the other hand , the scanned sample area for field - dependent measurements at 6 k was reduced to @xmath52 because of the much reduced scanning range of the piezoelectric material at low temperatures and the experimental preference to complete a full spectroscopic scan without interruptions by the need of liquid helium transfer . for all tunneling spectra ,",
    "the typical junction resistance was kept at @xmath53 .",
    "it was verified that the tunneling spectroscopy and topography were both independent of slight variations of the tip height relative to the sample surface under this range of junction resistance . for consistent analysis of all experimental data taken under different conditions on multiple samples ,",
    "the tunneling spectra to be discussed below were all processed into normalized differential conductance , @xmath54 , because this quantity minimizes extrinsic effects incurred by slight variations in the sample - tip separation , and so best represents the material characteristics of the tunnel junction .",
    "for comparison of the spectral characteristics as functions of temperature , magnetic field and spin polarization , it would have been ideal to conduct all studies over identical sample areas .",
    "however , in practice we were only able to investigate the field dependent spectra over the same sample area by keeping the measurements at a constant temperature @xmath23 k. this limitation was because changes in the measurement temperature would result in drifts of the stm tip , and replacing the stm tip ( @xmath55 from pt / ir to cr - coated tips ) would lead to a different sample area upon reapproaching the tip to the sample . given the intrinsic heterogeneity of lcmo , meaningful comparison among data taken either with different stm tips or at different temperatures could only be made if statistical consistency in the spectral characteristics could be established .",
    "this premise was indeed verified in our investigation , as elaborated further in section iii .",
    "based on the methods outlined in section ii , systematic studies of the tunneling spectral evolution with temperature , magnetic field and spin polarization were carried out to address the issues of phase separation , surface state and pg phenomena in the nominally metallic manganite epitaxial thin films of @xmath0 ( lcmo ) on @xmath1 substrates .",
    "our detailed surveys of the lcmo tunneling spectra over relatively large sample areas and multiple samples with both pt / ir and cr - coated tips at @xmath41 k ( @xmath56 ) and @xmath39 revealed three types of representative tunneling spectra , which are labeled as @xmath57 , @xmath58 , and @xmath59-types for convenience .",

    "the @xmath57-type of spectra is consistent with our previous single - point spectroscopic studies .",

    "it is reasonable to assume that the magnetization of the cr - coated tip follows the tip geometry for all temperatures of the experiments and is therefore fixed and approximately perpendicular to the plane of the lcmo sample .",
    "therefore , at @xmath39 the angle @xmath120 follows the spatial variation of the magnetization from one magnetic domain to another in the lcmo sample . on the other hand , for magnetic field opposite to the spin polarization of the cr - coated tip and with a magnitude satisfying the condition @xmath123 , the net magnetization for the spin - polarized tunneling currents and the magnetization of each magnetic domain of lcmo are antiparallel , so that the selection rules for spins yield @xmath124 , and for positive bias ( @xmath125 ) the spin - polarized tunneling involves primarily electron tunneling ( because hole tunneling is suppressed ) from occupied cr - majority band to empty lcmo - minority band and from occupied cr - minority band to empty lcmo - majority band . hence , for anti - parallel cr and lcmo magnetizations ,",

    "the seemingly puzzling field - dependent @xmath71 distributions shown in figs .",
    "7(e ) and 10(e ) may be understood by attributing the surface phase of lcmo to a ferromagnetic insulator ( fi ) as the result of one of the following two scenarios . the first scenario is to consider the lcmo sample as stoichiometric both in the bulk and near the surface , with the surface atomic layer terminated by insulating mno@xmath27 .",

    "indeed , our previous optical studies of lcmo epitaxial films and single crystals  @xcite have revealed clear drude - like optical conductivity below @xmath151 , implying bulk metallic behavior in the ferromagnetic state .",
    "hence , the bulk characteristics of our lcmo samples determined from measurements of the magnetization , transport and optical properties are all consistent with a metallic ferromagnetic phase ,  @xcite whereas manifestation of a gapped state is only found in surface sensitive measurements such as the stm and xps studies ,  @xcite suggesting that only the surface of lcmo is insulating",
    ". similar results from optical measurements have also been reported for cleaved @xmath152 single crystals ,  @xcite suggesting common metallic behavior in the bulk ferromagnetic phase of the manganites .",
    "on the other hand , a second senario that assumes a ca - deficient surface layer may also account for the aforementioned experimental findings . specifically , according to the phase diagram of @xmath153 ,  @xcite the ground state of the manganites is a ferromagnetic insulator ( fi ) if the ca doping level @xmath79 is less than 0.2 .",
    "although no experimental techniques known to date can determine the nano - scale local chemical compositions of a sample surface , it is conceivable that a ca - deficient surface in the lcmo may result in a fi surface phase .",
    "however , the substantial ca - deficiency required to yield a fi phase seemed incompatible with the averaged slight ca - deficiency ( ca = @xmath154 ) from the xps studies of lcmo .",
    "@xcite overall , the gapped nature of the lcmo surface phase and the dependence of @xmath71 on magnetic fields and on spin polarization are all consistent with a insulating surface phase differing from the metallic bulk .",
    "we further note that for lsmo / sto manganite superlattices ( lsmo : @xmath155 , sto : @xmath156 ) , stoichiometric variations between the bulk lsmo and the interface of lsmo / sto have also been reported .",
    "@xcite    to examine the validity of a surface fi phase , we consider the field - dependent spectra under spin - polarized tunneling to the sample surface . if @xmath39 , the magnetization in the surface fi domains should be randomly oriented , so that the effective insulating gap values determined by spin - polarized tunneling currents from the cr - coated tip are expected to range from the minimum gap @xmath133 to the maximum gap @xmath134 , as schematically illustrated in figs .",

    "indeed both regular and spin - polarized tunneling spectra at @xmath39 are consistent with the empirical gap histograms shown in fig .",

    "finally , for @xmath98 t the spin - polarized tunneling currents are parallel to the magnetization of lcmo as illustrated in fig .",

    "@xcite consequently , increasing carrier mobility and magnetic domain alignments upon the application of magnetic fields can reduce the spatially inhomogeneous electronic properties in the manganites , thereby suppressing the pg phenomena .    finally , it is interesting to compare the pg phenomena in the manganites with those in the cuprate superconductors .",
    "@xcite while the pg persists in both perovskite oxides well above their ordering ( @xmath157 , superconducting for the cuprates and ferromagnetic for the manganites ) transition temperatures in the absence of magnetic fields , the application of an external magnetic field has opposite effects on these two systems .",

    "@xcite which is in stark contrast to the significant _ suppression _ of pg by magnetic fields in the manganites .",
    "hence , the physical origin for the occurrence of pg phenomena appears to be fundamentally different for these two strongly correlated perovskite oxides , which also suggests that the appearance of pg alone in the cuprates is unlikely a sufficient condition for the occurrence of high - temperature superconductivity .",
