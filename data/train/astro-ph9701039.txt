    "hot optically thin accretion flow solutions are often used to model x - ray binaries and active galactic nuclei . in addition to the original two - temperature model of shapiro , lightman & eardley ( 1976 ) and the corona model of haardt & maraschi ( 1991 ) , two new classes of advection - dominated models",
    "have been proposed recently : a two - temperature solution ( narayan & yi 1995 , abramowicz et al .",
    "1995 ) , and a one - temperature solution ( esin et al .",
    "1996 ) .",
    "advection - dominated models differ from the usual accretion solutions in that only a fraction of the viscously dissipated energy is radiated locally in the disk .",
    "the remainder of the generated energy is stored in the gas as entropy , resulting in a very hot , optically thin , quasispherical flow .",
    "if the accreting object is a black hole , as it is believed to be the case for several x - ray binaries and all active galactic nuclei , the stored energy is carried by the gas inside the horizon , so that the luminosity of the system can be orders of magnitude smaller than is predicted by standard accretion theory .",
    "the gas in advection - dominated solutions cools primarily through bremsstrahlung , synchrotron and inverse compton scattering processes . since the accreting electrons are heated to temperatures of up to @xmath5 , the spectra of such systems span @xmath4 orders of magnitude in energy , from synchrotron radio emission to @xmath6 x - rays produced via compton cooling of hot electrons . because two - temperature advection - dominated solutions have low radiative efficiency and hard power - law spectra , they have been successful in reproducing the observed properties of various low - luminosity x - ray sources including sagittarius a@xmath7 ( narayan , yi , & mahadevan 1995 ) , the black hole nova a0620 - 00 in quiescence ( narayan , mcclintock & yi 1996 ) , and the central source in ngc 4258 ( lasota et al .",
    "they also appear to be relevant to luminous systems ( narayan 1996 ) .",
    "it is not yet clear if one - temperature solutions are relevant to any observed system .",
    "though detailed numerical spectra of advection - dominated flows include global radiative transfer effects ( narayan , mcclintock & yi 1996 ; narayan 1996 ; narayan , barret & mcclintock 1997 ) , analytical calculations of the physical properties of these accretion solutions , which we briefly review in  2 , generally ignore the effects of non - local radiative transfer ( narayan & yi 1995 ; esin et al .",
    "this is a dangerous approximation .",
    "the optical depth for electron scattering in such flows is generally much lower than unity , and therefore , radiation emitted at one radius can potentially change the energy balance of the gas at quite different radii .",
    "it is the purpose of this paper to investigate the importance of this effect .",
    "we analyze three different but related issues .",
    "first , in the advection - dominated models the bulk of the luminosity is emitted from the innermost region of the disk ( @xmath8 ) , where most of the gravitational energy is dissipated and the cooling efficiency of the gas is higher .",
    "the radiative flux from this region can have two effects on the rest of the flow , as we discuss in  3.1 .",
    "the hot radiation can compton heat (  3.1.1 ) the outer regions ( @xmath9 ) , where the gas is cooler ( shvartsman 1971 , ostriker at al . 1976 ,",
    "grindlay 1978 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "cold but numerous synchrotron photons can contribute to cooling of the gas (  3.1.2 ) closer in ( @xmath10 ) .",
    "next , the hot solutions based on the one - temperature advection model ( esin et al .",
    "1996 ) do not extend down to the last stable orbit for @xmath11 . at accretion rates higher than this limit",
    "the only possible configuration is a standard thin disk ( shakura & sunyaev 1973 ; frank , king & raine 1992 ) , surrounded by a hot flow . since most of the energy is dissipated in the thin disk",
    ", the number density of the cold photons emitted in the inner regions can be much greater than the number density of photons emitted locally by the hot gas , and we expect that the hot flow will suffer significant extra cooling via compton scattering of the thin disk photons . this issue is discussed in  3.2 .",
    "finally , both one- and two - temperature advection - dominated solutions can be surrounded by a thin accretion disk , with the boundary between them at some radius @xmath12 , where the value of @xmath12 depends on the parameters of the model . here",
    "again the cold photons emitted by the thin disk can compton cool electrons in the nearby hot flow .",
    "we analyze this situation in  3.3 .    just as the radiation from the thin disk affects the energy balance of the hot flow , the cold gas itself is affected by irradiation from the advection - dominated zone . in  3.4 we investigate whether this process affects our conclusions from  3.2 and  3.3 .",
    "we summarize and discuss the results in  4 .",
    "in this section we review the basic equations , derived by narayan & yi ( 1995 ) , that describe local properties of advection - dominated accretion flows in terms of five basic parameters : mass of the accreting object , @xmath13 , mass accretion rate , @xmath14 , radial distance from the accreting object , @xmath15 , standard viscosity coefficient , @xmath16 ( shakura & sunyaev 1973 ) , and the ratio of gas pressure to total pressure , @xmath17 .      the total pressure in a vertically averaged , axisymmetric accretion flow is given by @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the gas density and @xmath20 is the local isothermal sound speed .",
    "we assume that the gas is in equipartition with a tangled magnetic field , so the total pressure is the sum of the gas and magnetic pressures , @xmath21 . in the ionized gas ,",
    "the expression for the gas pressure is @xmath22 where @xmath23 , @xmath24 , and @xmath25 , @xmath26 are temperatures and molecular weights of ions and electrons respectively .",
    "the magnetic pressure due to the isotropic tangled magnetic field is given by @xmath27 note that this equation differs from the one adopted by narayan & yi ( 1995 ) by a factor of @xmath28 .",
    "narayan & yi ( 1995 ) have derived a self - similar solution for advection - dominated accretion flows that obey mass , energy , and momentum conservation . combining this solution with the equation for the gas pressure , and scaling mass in units of the solar mass , @xmath29 , accretion rate in eddington units , @xmath30 , and radii in schwarzschild units , @xmath31",

    "however , cooling of the hot plasma occurs mainly through electrons , so the energy has to be transferred in some way from ions to electrons . in their analysis ,",
    "narayan & yi ( 1995 ) ( following shapiro , lightman , & eardley [ 1976 ] ) assumed that the energy transfer can occur only through coulomb interactions at a volume transfer rate , @xmath45 , the expression for which was derived by stepney & guilbert 1983 . since @xmath46 ( eq . [ [ q+v ] ] ) and @xmath47 ( stepney & guilbert 1983 ) , at low densities , coulomb interactions are less efficient than viscous energy dissipation , giving rise to two - temperature accretion flows with ions much hotter than electrons .",
    "in addition to coulomb scatterings , some non - thermal coupling mechanisms have been proposed recently ( e.g. begelman & chiueh 1988 ) .",
    "if such mechanisms are more efficient than coulomb coupling , they can restore the thermal equilibrium between the ions and electrons , creating a one - temperature accretion flow ( esin et al .",
    "1996 ) . in that case",
    ", the question of energy transfer from ions to electrons is settled by simply setting @xmath48 at all times .",
    "the fraction @xmath49 of the energy generated by viscous heating must be radiated by the gas .",
    "cooling of the hot plasma occurs via three processes : bremsstrahlung , synchrotron radiation , and inverse compton scattering of low energy bremsstrahlung and synchrotron photons : @xmath50    [ [ bremsstrahlung - and - line - emission ] ] bremsstrahlung and line emission + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    the free - free emission in a plasma is produced in electron - electron and electron - ion interactions .",
    "the corresponding cooling rates were derived by stepney & guilbert ( 1983 ) and svensson ( 1982 ) .",
    "the total bremsstrahlung cooling rate per unit volume is the sum of the two contributions , @xmath51 .    at large radii ,",
    "the gas is cold enough to allow line cooling , which becomes more efficient than free - free emission below @xmath52 . at these temperatures electron - electron bremsstrahlung emission is negligible , and we use a cooling function that includes electron - ion bremsstrahlung and line cooling ( updated version ; original version was described by raymond , cox , & smith [ 1976 ] ) .",
    "[ [ synchrotron - emission ] ] synchrotron emission + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    in a hot plasma with equipartition magnetic field , synchrotron radiation is an important cooling mechanism .",
    "an expression for the spectrum of optically thin synchrotron emission from a relativistic maxwellian distribution of electrons was derived by mahadevan , narayan , & yi ( 1996 ) . however , below some critical frequency , @xmath53 , the emission becomes self - absorbed and the optically thin emission formalism no longer applies . to estimate @xmath53",
    "we equate the synchrotron emission from a sphere of radius @xmath15 to the rayleigh - jeans blackbody emission from the surface of that sphere .",
    "below @xmath53 the emission is optically thick and we use the blackbody estimate , while above @xmath53 we use the expression derived by mahadevan et al .",

    "the optical depth to electron scattering is simply @xmath54 , where @xmath55 is the scale height of the flow determined through the conditions for vertical hydrostatic equilibrium .",
    "after each scattering , the energy of a photon is increased by a factor @xmath56 ( rybicki & lightman 1979 ) , where @xmath57 is the dimensionless electron temperature .",
    "the average ratio of the photon energy at escape to its initial energy is given by ( esin et al .",

    "the spectrum of bremsstrahlung radiation is practically flat between the synchrotron self - absorption frequency @xmath53 ( we found that the bremsstrahlung self - absorption frequency is generally lower than @xmath53 for the range of accretion flow parameters that is relevant for this work ) and exponential cut - off at @xmath62 .",
    "below @xmath53 free - free emission falls off as rayleigh - jeans blackbody and comptonization is not important , since the photons are more likely to be absorbed than scattered .",
    "consequently , we can estimate the emission per unit frequency as @xmath63 .",
    "then the compton cooling rate is given by the integral @xmath64 d \\nu}$ ] .",
    "the total compton cooling rate is simply @xmath65 .",
    "the local energy balance in the gas requires that a fraction @xmath49 of the viscously dissipated energy is radiated away .",
    "this gives us the condition @xmath66 which together with the equation of state and self - similar solution described in  2.1 is sufficient to obtain a closed set , necessary to solve for all one - temperature flow parameters .",
    "for a two - temperature solution , we need another equation to determine @xmath23 and @xmath24 separately . we obtain it by requiring that the net cooling rate has to be equal to the heating rate of the electrons : @xmath67      the set of equations described in  2.1 - 2.2 allows all the major parameters describing the accreting gas to be solved for self - consistently for given values of @xmath68 , and @xmath17 .",
    "the resulting flows are quasispherical , with @xmath69 , optically thin , and quite hot .",
    "their properties were described in detail by narayan & yi ( 1995 ) and esin et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , and here we give a brief summary .    as was shown first by rees et al .",
    "( 1982 ) advection - dominated accretion solutions are limited to values of @xmath70 that lie below a maximum mass accretion rate , @xmath71 . above this limiting value",
    ", the radiative efficiency of the gas is so high due to the increased plasma density , that the flow cools down to the standard thin accretion disk configuration .",

    "our much stronger dependance of the critical accretion rate on radius is due to including line cooling , which is significantly more efficient than bremsstrahlung at low temperatures .",
    "closer to the accreting object , @xmath75 decreases steeply as @xmath76 in a one - temperature model , but is roughly independent of @xmath77 in a two - temperature model ( the slight decrease in @xmath75 seen on the figure is most likely an artifact of the self - similar assumption we used to derive the solution ; when proper boundary conditions are used at the inner edge of the disk , this decrease is no longer present [ c.f .",
    "narayan 1996 ] ) .    to understand why the two solutions behave in this way",
    ", we show in figure 1(b ) the radial temperature profile of the accreting gas for a @xmath78 black hole , with @xmath79 , @xmath80 and @xmath81 . at large radii ,",
    "the ion and electron temperature in a two - temperature flow are equal to each other and to the gas temperature in a one - temperature flow . in that region ,",
    "the coulomb energy transfer from ions to electrons is efficient and the two solutions are identical .",
    "however , in the region inside @xmath82 , the electron temperature in a two - temperature solution remains roughly constant , whereas the ions stay at near virial temperatures with @xmath83 .",
    "the gas in a one - temperature flow , on the other hand , necessarily finds an equilibrium temperature with @xmath84 .",
    "the temperature @xmath85 obviously lies between @xmath24 and @xmath23 of the two - temperature solution . at @xmath86 , the rate of synchrotron and compton cooling of the gas is very sensitive to the temperature of the electrons , and",
    "since electrons in one - temperature solutions are hotter than electrons in two - temperature solutions , the former has a much higher radiative efficiency .",
    "this in turn leads to lower @xmath75 .",
    "the difference in temperatures between the two solutions also leads to different values of the advection parameter @xmath43 .",
    "figures 1(c ) and 1(d ) show contours of constant @xmath43 as a function of radius and accretion rate , for two- and one - temperature models respectively .",
    "two - temperature flows are advection - dominated , @xmath87 everywhere , except for a narrow region near the @xmath88 boundary ( shown as a heavy line ) . on the other hand , the inner regions of single - temperature accretion disks are cooling - dominated , @xmath89 , for @xmath90 , because they have higher electron temperatures .",
    "in fact , one - temperature hot accretion flows at high @xmath14 have radiative efficiency close to @xmath91 , which means they radiate away nearly all the gravitational energy lost in the accretion process ( esin et al .",
    "by comparison , the efficiency of two - temperature accretion solutions can be orders of magnitude less .",
    "the formalism described in the previous section ignores the effects of non - local radiative transfer .",
    "it assumes that the photons emitted at one radius interact only with the ` local ' gas , i.e. gas within a region of unit radial width in @xmath92 .",
    "we can check the validity of this assumption by estimating the optical depth for electron scattering in the radial direction predicted by advection models .",
    "the optical depth from radius @xmath93 to @xmath77 is simply @xmath94 . after substituting the expression for @xmath35 given by eq .",
    "( [ ne ] ) , where we take @xmath95 ( see appendix b ) , and integrating , we obtain @xmath96 assuming that @xmath97 .",
    "thus , two - temperature accretion disks are optically thin if @xmath98 , which means that the photons can travel freely through the disk and be scattered by electrons far from where they were emitted , heating or cooling the gas as a result of scattering .",
    "one - temperature accretion disks are geometrically thinner in the inner region than two - temperature disks , because they are able to cool more efficiently ( esin et al .",
    "1996 ) . as a result , both @xmath35 and @xmath99 are higher",
    ". however , even one - temperature flows are optically transparent below @xmath100 .    in the remainder of this section we attempt to quantify how compton scattering of non - local radiation will affect the flow parameters calculated based on local analysis . in each case",
    "we estimate analytically the region in the parameter space where non - local effects can be important , then we compute numerically how the properties of the solutions are affected in this region .      both one- and two - temperature accretion flows produce most of their emission from within @xmath101 , where most of the gravitational potential energy is released .",
    "the inner region also has the highest electron temperatures so that the emerging photons are hotter than the gas in the surrounding flow .",
    "when this radiation interacts with the gas in the outer regions of the disk , two processes can take place .",
    "where the gas is relatively hot , less energetic photons will cool the electrons through inverse compton scattering . on the other hand , where the temperature of the electrons is less than the effective temperature of the radiation",
    ", the electrons will be heated via compton scattering .",
    "the amount of the heating or cooling can be easily estimated if we assume that each photon undergoes at most one scattering at any given radius ( a reasonable assumption , since the compton @xmath102-parameter ( rybicki & lightman 1979 ) of the accreting gas at @xmath103 is always less than unity ) . with this approximation ,",
    "the rate of energy transfer from photons to electrons per unit volume , via compton scattering , is just @xmath104 where @xmath105 is the number density of the incident photons per unit frequency and @xmath106 is the energy lost by the photon in each scattering .",
    "when @xmath107 is positive , the electrons are heated by the incident photon flux , when @xmath107 is negative , the electrons are cooled .",
    "we approximate @xmath105 as @xmath108 , where @xmath109 is the luminosity per unit frequency emerging from the region within @xmath101 .",

    ", we have to replace @xmath113 by @xmath114 , to ensure that @xmath115 .",
    "however , numerical calculations of @xmath107 ( described in  3.1.1 and  3.1.2 ) show that this modification has a very small effect on the final result and so for simplicity we use eq .",
    "( [ deltae ] ) in our analytic estimates .",
    "let us consider first the rate of heating of the gas by the energetic photons . from eq .",
    "( [ deltae ] ) it is clear that only photons with energies @xmath116 can contribute to the heating , whereas photons with lower energies will cool the gas .",
    "the high energy cutoff of the spectrum is determined by the electron temperature in the inner regions , @xmath117 , since inverse compton scattering can not produce photons with energies higher than @xmath118 ( rybicki & lightman 1979 ) .",

    "the precise shape of @xmath109 depends sensitively on the value of the accretion rate .",
    "however , a reasonable upper limit to the effect of heating can be obtained by assuming that the spectrum is flat , i.e. equal energy is emitted per logarithmic interval in frequency , and that the luminosity emitted from the inner region is approximately equal to the total luminosity of the disk . since the spectra generally span @xmath4 orders of magnitude in frequency ( e.g. narayan , yi , & mahadevan 1995 ; lasota et al .",

    "cold photons emitted by the thin disk will compton cool the hot gas around it .",
    "this is a similar problem to the one we discussed in  3.1.2 .",
    "however , since the luminosity considered here is higher because of the higher efficiency of the thin disk , we expect that non - local compton cooling will be more important .    in this scenario ,",
    "non - local cooling is no longer limited to the outer regions of the disk , where the accreting gas has low density and temperature and therefore , multiple scatterings of the incident photons are not important .",
    "in fact , when we compute the compton @xmath102-parameter we find that it can be much greater than unity for @xmath167 .",

    "the flow in this region will be cooled significantly by photons from the thin disk . including non - local compton cooling directly in our calculations",
    "shows that because of the increase in the cooling rate , the gas near the inner edge of the hot flow collapses to a thin disk , and the critical accretion rate line itself moves downwards .",

    "@xmath82 , the critical accretion rate for both one- and two - temperature solutions decreases with radius as @xmath73 .",
    "therefore , for any value of @xmath70 there is a critical radius @xmath184 beyond which the only possible flow configuration is the thin disk .",
    "therefore , we expect to have accretion flows where the gas forms a cool thin disk for @xmath185 , but switches to a hot advection - dominated state for @xmath186 .",
    "many of the models published in the literature ( e.g. narayan et al . 1996 ) are of this form .    in such configurations , the photons produced in the cold outer flow may be expected to compton cool the hot gas inside @xmath184 .",

    "the cooling from the outer disk can , however , be significant if @xmath222 .",
    "there is no well - developed theory at this time for the transition radius @xmath12 and one could in principle imagine a situation where the gas remains in a cold state down to a much smaller radius than @xmath223 .",
    "if we consider such a model , the extra cooling of the hot gas at @xmath210 can be quite important . to show this , we computed the ratio @xmath224 numerically , using the full expression for @xmath215 ( as given by eq .",

    "we can see that external cooling begins to dominate when @xmath227 , in reasonable agreement with our analytic approximation .",
    "as the transition radius decreases further , the ratio of non - local to local cooling at the boundary between a two - temperature hot flow and a thin disk becomes more extreme , increasing up to @xmath228 for high accretion rates , and causing a significant decrease in the equilibrium temperature of the hot gas .",
    "note however , that only a relatively thin layer near the boundary is affected by extra cooling .",
    "away from the boundary , the cold photon flux decreases linearly with @xmath77 and the ratio of non - local to local cooling falls steeply with decreasing radius ( see eqs .",

    "the total cooling in the boundary layer becomes so strong , that the gas temperature is forced significantly below the virial value , i.e. the hot quasispherical flow collapses into a cold thin disk .",
    "when this occurs , the transition radius effectively moves inwards , which means that the hot gas in the new boundary layer will experience even stronger external cooling , and will also inevitably collapse . in this fashion",
    ", a runaway instability develops that causes the entire hot flow to cool down to the standard shakura & sunyaev disk .",
    "we have computed numerically the values of the transition radius at which this instability occurs for different mass accretion rates .",
    "this was done by incorporating @xmath158 directly into the calculations and decreasing @xmath226 until the hot stable accretion flow solution at @xmath230 disappeared .",
    "the resulting critical values of @xmath226 are shown on figure 5 as dashed lines .",
    "we see that this instability is an important consideration only for large values of the mass accretion rate . for @xmath231 ,",
    "the thin disk has virtually no effect on the hot flow , irrespectively of where the transition between the cold and hot phases occurs .    in a single - temperature hot flow ,",
    "the value of the ratio @xmath224 evaluated at @xmath232 never becomes much higher than unity ( see figure 4[b ] ) , even for small values of the transition radius .",

    "the cooling ratio behaves roughly in accordance with eq .",
    "( [ frac ] ) , so that external cooling is completely unimportant there .      in calculating the energy flux from the thin disk in  3.2 and  3.3 we used the standard ( frank , king , & raine 1992 ) formalism and ignored the effects of irradiation of the cold gas by the advection flow .",
    "in reality , most of the hot photons incident on the thin disk are reprocessed there , so that the net emission from the thin disk is a blackbody at a higher temperature than predicted by the standard theory . to test whether irradiation is important",

    "( [ q+ ] ) . the result can be expressed in terms of elliptical integrals , but to get a rough estimate of @xmath238 we assume that @xmath239 , i.e. we restrict our analysis to radii well inside the transition radius . then to zeroth order in @xmath240 the ratio of the incident to the viscously dissipated energy evaluates to @xmath241 thus , irradiation contributes at most a few percent to the energy output of the thin disk .",
    "this result was confirmed by integrating eq .",
    "( [ inc ] ) numerically , with the correct expression for @xmath127 in the case of a one - temperature flow .",
    "we conclude that irradiation is entirely negligible in this scenario , because the inner thin disk subtends a small solid angle from the point of view of the hot flow , and most of the energy is dissipated in the thin disk . by comparison , in the disk and corona model ( e.g. haardt & maraschi 1991 ) , where irradiation is known to play an important role ,",
    "the hot corona lies directly on top of the cold gas , so that roughly half of all photons emitted in the corona are absorbed by the disk .",
    "the expression for the energy incident on an outer thin disk differs from eq .",

    "energy per unit area is independent of @xmath192 : @xmath244 numerical calculations show that even at @xmath245 , the result increases by at most @xmath246 .",
    "this calculation shows that irradiation of the outer thin disk becomes important only at large transition radii , where , according to our results from  3.3 the presence of the thin disk does not affect the hot flow .",
    "note also that large transition radii are allowed only for low accretion rates , when the flow becomes strongly - advection dominated , and the result in eq .",
    "( [ ratio2 ] ) decreases by an additional factor of @xmath49 . on the other hand ,",
    "if the transition occurs within @xmath220 , irradiation will increase the flux from the thin disk by at most a factor of 2 .",
    "this has only a small effect on our calculations of the critical transition radius , and qualitatively our results remain the same .",
    "in this paper we have explored how non - local radiation transfer affects the properties of hot one- and two - temperature advection - dominated solutions described by esin et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , narayan & yi ( 1995 ) and abramowicz et al .",
    "since these solutions are optically thin , radiation emitted at one radius could in principle induce significant cooling or heating of the accreting gas at some other radius , through compton scattering .",
    "we considered three different sources of non - local radiation : a luminous inner region of a hot disk ( @xmath247 ) , a thin disk inside a hot one - temperature gas , and a thin shakura & sunyaev disk surrounding a hot advection - dominated flow .",
    "we found that two - temperature solutions are not affected by the radiation from their hot interior .",
    "these solutions are strongly advection - dominated everywhere except near the outer boundary of the disk , @xmath223 , ( see fig .",
    "1[c ] ) , and the inner part simply does not produce enough hot photons to induce significant heating of the outer layers . on the other hand ,",
    "the gas density of the flow at @xmath248 is so small , that with electron temperatures of @xmath249 , compton cooling by non - local radiation can not play an important role either .",
    "the inner parts of one - temperature flows are cooling - dominated and produce more radiation than their two - temperature counterparts .",
    "however , single - temperature solutions are limited to lower values of the mass accretion rate ( see figure 1[a ] ) , and since hot photons are produced mainly by comptonization , which is not an efficient process at low @xmath14 , no heating of the outer flows occurs . on the other hand , we find that compton cooling by the photons from the interior dominates over local cooling processes for @xmath250 and @xmath251 . however , since the bulk of the observable radiation comes from inside @xmath101 , the changes in the flow properties caused by extra cooling do not appreciably affect the overall spectrum of the system .",
    "compton cooling by the radiation from the inner thin disk does have a significant impact on one - temperature flows , since it occurs at higher @xmath14 , when compton scattering is very effective .",
    "the extra cooling induced by the thin disk photons is so strong , that the maximum accretion rate for which the one - temperature model has an equilibrium solution decreases by a factor of @xmath4 ( figure 3[a ] ) .",
    "finally , we found that the radiation from an outer thin disk does not have any effect on a hot flow that extends beyond @xmath252 . at this distance , the gas is too cold for significant compton cooling to take place .",
    "when the transition radius between the hot and cold gas moves closer to the accreting object , the non - local cooling of two - temperature gas near the boundary can become very large .",
    "however , this effect is limited to the layers of the hot flow very close to the transition between the hot and cold gas ; away from this boundary , the ratio of non - local to local cooling decreases as @xmath253 .",
    "therefore , external cooling does not affect the regions of the hot gas where most of the observable radiation is produced and can be disregarded until it is so strong that it forces the hot flow near the boundary to cool to a thin disk configuration .",
    "when this happens , the transition radius decreases and the hot gas in the new boundary layer experiences even stronger external cooling , which causes it to collapse in its turn .",
    "the resulting runaway process continues until the entire flow assumes the thin disk configuration",
    ". this phenomenon can be important if the hot advection - dominated flows are formed by evaporation of the thin disk near the accreting black hole ( narayan & yi 1995 ) . in that case , the maximum accretion rate at which such hot flow can form is in fact less than @xmath88 computed based on the local assumption .",

    "radiation pressure was shown to be unimportant in one - temperature flows ( esin et al .",
    "1996 ) and since two - temperature solutions are even less luminous , the radiation pressure can safely be ignored .",
