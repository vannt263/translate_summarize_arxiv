    "the rare earth perovskite manganites ( r@xmath3a@xmath4mno@xmath2 ) are associated with a wide variety of fascinating physics due to the strong coupling between their electronic , magnetic and lattice degrees of freedom .",
    "phenomena observed in these materials include @xmath5colossal@xmath6 magnetoresistance , real - space charge ordering , electronic phase separation , and a diverse variety of magnetoelectronic ground states ( ramirez 1997 , coey @xmath7 1999 ) .",
    "although this entire class of materials displays unusual behavior , one composition , pr@xmath0ca@xmath1mno@xmath2 , has been shown to display a particularly rich set of phenomena .",
    "upon cooling from high temperatures in low fields , this material undergoes a charge - ordering transition at t@xmath8 @xmath9 230 k ( jirk , @xmath7 1980 , jirk @xmath7 1985 , cox @xmath7 1998 ) and an antiferromagnetic ( afm ) transition ( at t @xmath10 150k ) ( yoshizawa @xmath7 1995 ) . at lower temperatures ( t@xmath11 110k ) ,",
    "the system enters a different state which we will label canted antiferromagnetic ( cafm ) based on earlier neutron scattering results , although some recent papers suggest that the cafm phase is actually an inhomogeneous mixed phase ( frontera @xmath7 2000 , radaelli @xmath7 preprint , deac @xmath7 preprint ) . at lower temperatures",
    "( t @xmath12 60 k ) , application of a field ( h @xmath13 2.5 t ) , induces a first - order irreversible transition to a ferromagnetic ( fm ) ) metallic state , i.e. the system remains in the fm metallic state even after the external field has been removed ( although the charge ordered state is reestablished on subsequent heating above t @xmath10 60 k ( tomioka @xmath7 1996 ) .",
    "the strong hysteresis associated with this transition is indicated by the hatched region in figure [ f1 ] which illustrates where the state is history dependent .    like several other manganite compounds , the resistivity of pr@xmath0ca@xmath1mno@xmath2 is reduced by orders of magnitude in a magnetic field due to the irreversible field - induced transition ( tomioka @xmath7 1996 , hwang @xmath7 1995 , tomioka @xmath7 1995 , lees @xmath7 1996 , anane @xmath7 1999 ) .",
    "what sets pr@xmath0ca@xmath1mno@xmath2 apart from the other manganites is that the metastable insulating state also can be driven metallic by electric field ( asamitsu @xmath7 1997 , stankiewicz @xmath7 2000 ) , high pressure ( morimoto @xmath7 1997 ) , exposure to visible light ( miyano @xmath7 1997 , fiebig @xmath7 1998 ) , or x - rays ( kiryukhin @xmath7 1997 , cox @xmath7 1998 ) ) . to characterize the irreversible transition between these two magnetic states ,",
    "we have made a detailed study of both single crystal and polycrystalline samples of this compound through resistivity , magnetization , field - dependent specific heat , and magnetocaloric measurements .",
    "we find that there is an enormous release of heat at the field - induced transition at low temperatures , sufficient to raise the sample temperature by a factor of 2 , which explains the irreversibility of the transition . in the fm state at low temperatures , our specific heat and magnetization measurements",
    "indicate a ferromagnetic spin wave stiffness which is far below that seen in any other manganite .",
    "the data can most easily be explained as a result of ferromagnetism among the moments associated with the pr ions , and the results imply that the pr magnetism may be important to understanding the unusual low temperature properties of this material .",
    "some of these results have been published previously elsewhere ( roy @xmath7 2000b ) .",
    "we studied both a polycrystalline sample of pr@xmath0ca@xmath1mno@xmath2 synthesized by a standard solid state method and a single crystal grown in a floating zone mirror furnace .",
    "both samples were judged to be single - phase based on x - ray diffraction studies , and the results discussed below were qualitatively and quantitatively consistent between the two samples ( data for the single crystal are shown ) .",
    "resistivity was measured by a standard four probe ac in - line method and magnetization was measured in a quantum design squid magnetometer .",
    "specific heat was measured by a semi - adiabatic heat - pulse method calibrated against a copper standard ( roy 1999 , unpublished ) .",
    "magnetocaloric measurements were performed using our calorimeter .",
    "the calorimeter with the sample attached was temperature - controlled at a few degrees above the surrounding cryostat temperature after zero - field cooling .",
    "the field was then swept while recording the heat required to maintain the sample at constant temperature .",
    "the difference between the input heat required during the field sweep and that required at constant field was attributed to magnetocaloric effects since other sources of heating ( e.g. eddy currents ) were found to be negligible .",
    "in this section we describe the field dependence of the low temperature thermodynamic properties of pr@xmath0ca@xmath1mno@xmath2 with particular attention to the field induced cafm - fm transition at @xmath10 4 t. the insulating cafm phase has been shown to have spin - glass - like properties ( consistent with phase separation ( cox @xmath7 1998 , yoshizawa @xmath7 1995 , tomioka @xmath7 1995 , frontera @xmath7 2000 , radaelli @xmath7 preprint , deac @xmath7 preprint ) ) , and the spin - glass - like nature is evident in the low field temperature dependence of the magnetization , m(t ) . at t@xmath14",
    "we observe a sharp rise in m(t ) , but at lower temperatures we see a large difference between the zero - field - cooled and the field - cooled magnetization for h @xmath12 0.5 t ( see figure [ f2 ] ) . while the magnetization after field - cooling displays an increase with decreasing temperature , magnetization after the sample had been zero - field cooled drops at a lower temperature , and continues to decrease with decreasing temperature .",
    "the extent of this difference between the zero - field - cooled and the field - cooled magnetization decreases with increasing field with the two curves becoming nearly identical at fields above 0.5 t.    upon raising the field after zero - field - cooling , the magnetization , m(h ) , shows a sharp rise .",
    "the slope of m(h ) decreases with increasing field until @xmath10 3 t when there is an increase in dm / dh corresponding to the transition from the cafm state to the fm state ( see figure [ f3 ] ) . at high fields , m(t )",
    "reaches a value consistent with @xmath10 95@xmath15 of full saturation magnetization of the mn lattice . on subsequent field sweeps , however , m(t ) follows the fm magnetization curve  confirming the irreversibility of the first - order field - induced transition .",
    "the field required to induce the transition decreases with increasing temperature , and at t @xmath13 60 k , m(t ) becomes non - hysteretic , indicating the maximum temperature for which the fm phase is stable in zero field .",
    "we measured the field - dependence of the specific heat , c(h ) , by zero - field cooling the sample and then measuring the specific heat every 0.25 t while sweeping the field from 0 @xmath16 9 t @xmath16 -9 t @xmath16 9 t. we find that c(h ) decreases monotonically with increasing field which is consistent with suppression of spin excitations in a highly magnetized system ( see figure [ f4 ] ) . upon raising the field after zero - field - cooling",
    ", there is a sharp drop in c(h ) at h @xmath10 4 t corresponding to the cafm - fm transition .",
    "the large difference between the specific heats of the cafm and the fm states reflects the first order nature of the transition , and is plotted at h = 0 in the inset to figure [ f4 ] . even within the fm state ,",
    "the specific heat is extraordinarily sensitive to magnetic field , changing by @xmath10 70 mj / mole - k or @xmath10 40@xmath15 between 0 and 9 t. the magnitude of this change , and its implications for the thermodynamics of pr@xmath0ca@xmath1mno@xmath2 will be discussed below .",
    "the sample mounted on the calorimeter is only weakly thermally linked to the surrounding cryostat , and in the course of measuring c(h ) it became evident that a significant amount of heat was being released by the sample upon passing through the cafm - fm transition .",
    "this self - heating is illustrated in figure [ f5 ] which shows the temperature of the sample ( t@xmath17 ) during a field sweep .",
    "for this measurement , the sample was cooled in zero field and stabilized at the temperature of the surrounding cryostat , then the sample temperature was measured as the field was swept from 0 @xmath16 9 t , 9 t @xmath16 0 and 0 @xmath16 9 t at 0.0006 t / second .",
    "as seen in figure [ f5 ] , when the field is raised from 0 to 9 t for the first time , t@xmath17 increases remarkably with increasing field , displaying a steady rise between around 2.5 t to 4 t. at higher fields ( 4 t @xmath12 h @xmath12 5.5 t ) , while dt@xmath17/dh is negative , the large temperature difference between the sample and the base temperature indicates continued self - heating .",
    "this was confirmed by stopping a field sweep at 4 t , allowing the sample to equilibrate to the surrounding cryostat temperature , and then observing a rise in t@xmath17 upon resuming the field sweep .",
    "the sample continues to show some heating effect even at higher fields , although not as pronounced as that at low fields .",
    "on decreasing the field and during subsequent field sweeps , t@xmath17 remains largely constant except for small changes attributable to demagnetization effects .    to quantify this self - heating",
    ", we measured the actual heat released by the sample through magnetocaloric measurements .",
    "these measurements were conducted by monitoring the input power ( p ) required to maintain the calorimeter at a constant temperature during field sweeps .",
    "figure [ f6 ] shows a typical dataset at low temperatures in which we first cooled in zero field and then swept the magnetic field 0 @xmath16 9 t @xmath16 -9 t @xmath16 9 t while keeping both the calorimeter and the surrounding cryostat at constant temperature .",
    "when the field is raised for the first time after zero field cooling , we see a series of small features in p(h ) for h @xmath18 1 t. we attribute these reproducible features to heat release associated with the spin - glass - like character of the zero - field - cooled cafm state ( yoshizawa @xmath7 1995 , anane @xmath7 1999 , deac @xmath7 preprint ) , i.e. irreversible relaxation of the spin configuration during the initial field sweep ( mydosh 1993 , tsui @xmath7 1999 ) .",
    "these low field features are not seen in p(h ) in the fm phase after field cooling or after a large field has been applied and removed , although there is a slight drop near h = 0 which we attribute to domain effects . the most dramatic feature in the magnetocaloric data ,",
    "however , is the heating at higher fields ( h @xmath13 2.5 t ) during the initial sweep up in field , as reflected by the negative peak in p(h ) .",
    "this peak is associated with the first order cafm - fm phase transition and , on subsequent field sweeps , the sample displays essentially no heating , demonstrating the irreversible nature of this heat release .",
    "we calculated the total heat released in this process between h @xmath19 2.5 t and 9 t using    @xmath20    since the sweep rate ( dh / dt ) is constant , the total heat released by the sample can be evaluated quite easily by using equation [ e1 ] and subtracting the background ( using the data from subsequent field sweeps as the baseline ) . the total heat released in this process",
    "is found to be around 15 @xmath21 1 j / mole which is enormous ",
    "large enough to increase the sample temperature of a perfectly thermally isolated sample from 5 to 15 k. moreover , this heating is not an artifact of eddy current heating , since q remains unchanged ( within a few percent ) even when the sweep rate is increased by a factor of 4 ( see figure [ f7 ] ) .",
    "similar studies were performed at different temperatures , and we find that q is only weakly dependent on temperature at low temperatures ( t @xmath12 30 k ) . at higher temperatures ,",
    "q decreases monotonically with increasing temperature above t @xmath10 30 k , before finally disappearing at t @xmath10 50 k as shown in figure [ f8 ] .",
    "the magnitude of q from the magnetocaloric measurements is extraordinarily large compared with the other thermal energy scales in the system , as evidenced by the large self - heating .",
    "the 15 j / mole obtained at low temperatures is , in fact , significantly larger than what one would calculate for the free energy based on an integration of the specific heat . on the other hand ,",
    "the source of this large amount of heat is readily apparent from our measurements of m(h ) at low temperatures .",
    "the increment in magnetization associated with the cafm - fm transition occurs in a magnetic field , and therefore must be associated with a decrease in the zeeman energy of the sample , the release of which should be observed as heat .",
    "one can calculate this magnetic heat release q@xmath22 from simple thermodynamics using the following integral :    @xmath23    where h@xmath24 and h@xmath25 are defined by the width of the transition .",
    "this integral is readily evaluated from our measurements of m(h ) , and , at low temperatures , we find q@xmath22 @xmath10 10 @xmath21 1 j / mole with error bars calculated from the uncertainty in determining the limits of the integral .",
    "this magnitude is consistent with the magnetocaloric measurements discussed above , confirming that this is the source of the large heat release at the transition .",
    "we find that q@xmath22 decreases with increasing temperature ( see figure [ f8 ] ) , consistent with the disappearance of this field induced transition at t @xmath13 60 k. the thermodynamic origin of this large heat release is discussed below in context of ferromagnetism among the pr ions .",
    "one of the most striking features of the data discussed above is the rather strong field dependence of the low temperature specific heat in the fm phase ( i.e. after the material undergoes the irreversible field induced transition ) .",
    "the absolute value of the drop in c(h ) between 0 and 9 t in the fm state is at least a factor of 15 larger than that of the other fm conducting manganites such as la@xmath0ca@xmath1mno@xmath2 or la@xmath0sr@xmath1mno@xmath2 ( roy @xmath7 2000a ) . in order to understand the origin of this large drop in the specific heat",
    ", we also measured the specific heat as a function of temperature at various fields . in order to enter the fm state ,",
    "we either field - cooled the sample ( for h @xmath26 4 t ) or raised the field to 9 t at low temperatures and then reduced it to the desired value ( for h @xmath18 4 t ) . as shown in figure [ f9 ] , we find that c(t ) in the fm state is well described by a combination of phonon and spin wave terms :    @xmath27    where the first term corresponds to the lattice specific heat and the second corresponds to the specific heat of fm magnons at h = 0 .",
    "this choice of fitting function can be justified by subtracting the lattice contribution ( @xmath28 ) from the raw data .",
    "the result follows a power law temperature dependence with an exponent of 1.5 as seen in the inset to figure [ f9 ] , confirming that the remainder is the magnetic contribution c@xmath29 @xmath19 @xmath30 .",
    "this form is appropriate for h = 0 , and it fits the zero - field data well . that it also appears to fit the data at higher fields , even though the corrections for field dependence have not been included , may be attributable to some temperature dependence in the spin stiffness which would be reflected in @xmath31 .",
    "it should also be noted , that while this form fits the data well , we can not rule out the possibility of some additional contribution , such as a linear term which would arise from free electrons or a spin glass ( smolyaninova @xmath7 2000 ) .",
    "given the quality of the fit and also the fits to c(h ) discussed below , however , we expect such a contribution to be negligible .",
    "> from our fits to c(t ) we find that @xmath32 remains independent of h ( within experimental uncertainty ) , but that @xmath31 decreases rapidly with increasing field ( see figure [ f10 ] ) .",
    "this implies that the field dependence of the specific heat at low temperatures can be attributed to the spin - wave contribution and the decrease in specific heat with increasing field can be attributed to the field suppression of the spin - waves .",
    "we can fit the c(h ) data to the form expected for a heisenberg ferromagnet ( kittel 1964 ) :    @xmath33    where @xmath34 is the molar volume and the only two fitting constants a and d parameterize the lattice contribution and the stiffness constant of the spin wave spectrum respectively .",
    "such a fit is illustrated by the solid line in [ f4 ] .",
    "we fit for @xmath35h@xmath35 @xmath26 1 t to avoid domain effects which are evident also in our magnetocaloric and magnetization data described above .",
    "the fits to c(h ) at t = 5.5k yield a stiffness constant ( d @xmath10 28.0 @xmath21 0.3 mev - @xmath36 ) which is at least a factor of 4 smaller than that of other ferromagnetic metallic manganites ( see table [ t4.1 ] ( martin @xmath7 1996 , perring @xmath7 1996 , fernandez - baca @xmath7 1998 , lynn @xmath7 1996 ) , accounting for the much larger suppression of specific heat by an applied field . a fit at t = 12 k ,",
    "is of similarly high quality , and yields d = @xmath10 22.0 @xmath21 0.5 mev - @xmath36 , suggesting a slight temperature dependence to the spin stiffness .",
    "the very soft spin wave spectrum implied by the fits to c(h ) is quite surprising since there should be little difference in the mn - mn exchange energies in pr@xmath0ca@xmath1mno@xmath2 and other manganites which have similar structures and lattice constants .",
    "the value of d can be checked , however , from the fits to the temperature dependence of the specific heat c(t ) .",
    "the fit parameter @xmath31 for h @xmath19 0 is related to the spin stiffness constant through @xmath37 , and thus we can calculate the stiffness constant using the value of @xmath31 from the fit to fm state c(t ) at h = 0 .",
    "we find that this value of d ( 25.3 @xmath21 0.5 mev - @xmath36 ) is close to that calculated from the c(h ) data .    to further test the extraordinarily low value of d obtained from specific heat data , we measured the low temperature field - cooled temperature dependence of the magnetization in the fm state at h @xmath19 7 t. when proper corrections are made for the field - induced spin gap in an external field , m(t ) is consistent with spin - wave excitations with the exception of the lowest temperature data which is suppressed by around 0.3@xmath15 possibly due to a minute presence of a second phase as shown in figure [ f11 ] .",
    "modeling the data as a simple heisenberg ferromagnet and assuming that there is no spin gap at h @xmath19 0 , the spin - wave dispersion relation at an external field h is    @xmath38    where nm is the demagnetization field and m is the magnetization . using the standard spin - wave picture ,",
    "the magnetization is given by ( kittel 1964 , kunzler @xmath7 1960 , henderson @xmath7 1969 , smolyaninova @xmath39 1997 ) :    @xmath40    where @xmath41 our sample had dimensions 1.04mm@xmath420.904mm@xmath420.4 mm , and thus the demagnetization field at 7 t was calculated to be around 0.54 t. the summation f@xmath43 in equation [ e7 ] is evaluated at discrete temperatures , and the stiffness constant , d is calculated from a plot of @xmath44 as shown in the inset to figure [ f11 ] .",
    "we find that the measured value of d of this compound is around 25 @xmath21 2 mev - @xmath36 , this is again at least a factor of four smaller than that of other ferromagnetic metallic perovskite manganites ( see table [ t4.1 ] ) , and consistent with the specific heat data .",
    "since the fits to c(t ) , c(h ) and m(t ) consistently yield a spin stiffness constant which is much smaller than that obtained in other manganites , we must look for an explanation as to what might be different in pr@xmath0ca@xmath1mno@xmath2 . to answer this question ,",
    "we note that the fm saturation magnetization of pr@xmath0ca@xmath1mno@xmath2 is at least 10@xmath15 higher than that in other fm metallic rare - earth manganites such as la@xmath3ca@xmath4mno@xmath2 ( see table [ tmag ] ) ( tomioka @xmath39 1995 , lees @xmath7 1996 , thomas @xmath7 1999 , gong @xmath7 1995 , urushibara @xmath7 1995 , ju @xmath7 1995 , martinez @xmath7 1996 ) . since the mn spins display considerable canting ( yoshizawa @xmath7 1995 ) in pr@xmath0ca@xmath1mno@xmath2 even at high fields , an additional fm moment such as that associated with the rare - earth is required to explain this excess magnetization .",
    "recent neutron diffraction studies ( cox @xmath7 1998 ) have indeed observed ferromagnetic ordering of the pr@xmath45 ions for t @xmath18 60 k. moreover , we also observe a distinct small rise in m(t ) at t @xmath10 50 - 60k in figure 2 with an accompanying peak in c(t ) , presumably associated with the weak fm ordering of the pr moments .",
    "based on the similarity in the lattices , there is no reason to expect that the mn - mn fm interaction is more than 4 times weaker in pr@xmath0ca@xmath1mno@xmath2 than that in other fm manganites , and in fact preliminary neutron scattering measurements of d for the mn spins in the field - induced ferromagnetic phase of pr@xmath0ca@xmath1mno@xmath2 yield d @xmath10 150 mev - @xmath36 ( fernandez - baca and dai , unpublished ) .",
    "we therefore hypothesize that the weak fm ordering of the pr ions is responsible for small spin stiffness in pr@xmath0ca@xmath1mno@xmath2 .",
    "this hypothesis implies that excitations among the pr spins dominate the low temperature thermodynamics of pr@xmath0ca@xmath1mno@xmath2 since the softer spin wave spectrum of the pr moments is more sensitive to thermal excitations than that of the mn spins .",
    "we now discuss the origin of the large heat release at the first order cafm - fm transition , which , at first consideration , might be considered as the latent heat of the transition . if a system undergoing a first order phase transition is in equilibrium throughout the transition , then the free energy changes continuously through the transition . the latent heat associated with",
    "such a transition results from a discontinuity in the first temperature derivative of the free energy , i.e. a discontinuous change in the entropy of the system even though the system is always in equilibrium .",
    "in addition to the latent heat , more energy can be released at a first order transition if the system is not in equilibrium when the transition occurs , e.g. in the case of supercooling or supermagnetization . in such cases",
    ", there is an energetic barrier to the nucleation of the equilibrium phase which is typically characterized as a positive surface energy of the interface between the two phases .",
    "homogeneous nucleation of the equilibrium phase only occurs when the system is driven so far out of equilibrium that the free energy difference between the two phases becomes large enough for thermal fluctuations to overcome this surface energy barrier .",
    "once the equilibrium phase nucleates , the excess free energy is typically released as heat .    in the case of pr@xmath0ca@xmath1mno@xmath2 cooled in zero field , the cafm state seems to be the lowest energy state for t @xmath13 60 k , the same temperature at which the pr moments order ferromagnetically .",
    "below 60 k , the fm state apparently becomes energetically more favorable than the cafm state even at h = 0 since application of x - rays induces metallicity which is then quenched upon raising the field above 60 k. thus for t @xmath12 60 k , the cafm state resulting from zero - field cooling is metastable and effectively strongly supercooled . at this low temperature , however ,",
    "the energetic advantage of the fm state is apparently insufficient to cause it to nucleate spontaneously through thermal fluctuations , presumably due to a relatively large effective surface energy , and thus the system remains in the non - equilibrium cafm state .",
    "a large applied field can , however , make the fm state more energetically favorable , and in a large enough field the non - equilibrium free energy difference between the two phases becomes sufficient to allow homogeneous nucleation of the fm phase .",
    "when the phase transition is induced , this free energy difference associated with the applied field is released as heat , which is what we observe in our magnetocaloric measurements .",
    "once the system is in the fm state , there is no equivalent energetic advantage to reverting to the cafm state when the field is removed , and thus the transition is irreversible .",
    "this scenario for the low temperature zero - field thermodynamics is shown schematically in figure [ f12 ] .",
    "within this scenario we can also understand the reversible nature of the light - induced insulator - metal transition in pr@xmath0ca@xmath1mno@xmath2 .",
    "when light is applied to pr@xmath0ca@xmath1mno@xmath2 at low temperatures , it drives small regions of the sample into the fm conducting state . when the light and applied voltage are removed , however , the sample returns to the cafm insulating state ( miyano @xmath7 1997 , fiebig @xmath7 1998 ) . based on the stability of the low temperature cafm phase after cooling in zero field",
    ", one expects that the surface energy at the interface between the cafm and fm states is large .",
    "thus the small regions of the fm conducting phase will be `` swallowed '' by the cafm phase when the external stimuli are removed , since the system will gain more energy by shrinking the interface between the two phases than by growing the fm phase from these small regions .",
    "we have presented a variety of thermodynamic data on pr@xmath0ca@xmath1mno@xmath2 including magnetization , magnetocaloric and specific heat measurements , both as a function of temperature and applied magnetic field .",
    "our data suggest that the pr ferromagnetism and its coupling with mn spins may be important to the physics of this system at low temperature , and that excitations among the pr spins might dominate the thermal excitations in the material at low temperatures .",
    "the pr ordering temperature ( t @xmath10 60 ) is coincident with the maximum temperature at which fm phase is stable at h = 0 ( induced either by pressure or a previously applied field ) .",
    "furthermore , this is also the temperature above which the x - ray induced metallicity is quenched ( kiryukhin @xmath7 1997 ) .",
    "it thus appears possible that the onset of pr ferromagnetism destabilizes the cafm phase relative to the fm phase , so that in zero field the cafm phase is stable for t @xmath26 60 k but then becomes unstable to the fm phase below t @xmath10 60 k when the pr spins order . in this scenario , both the pr ferromagnetism and its coupling to the mn moments",
    "are crucial to understanding the physics and are therefore inseparable from the numerous unique phenomena observed in pr@xmath0ca@xmath1mno@xmath2 .          : :    anane , a. , renard , j. -p . , reversat , l. , dupas , c. , veillet , p. ,    viret , m. , pinsard , l. and revocolevschi , a. 1999 ,    @xmath46 * b59 * , 77 .",

    "<S> we present a detailed magnetothermal study of pr@xmath0ca@xmath1mno@xmath2 , a perovskite manganite in which an insulator - metal transition can be driven by magnetic field , but also by pressure , visible light , x - rays , or high currents . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the field - induced transition is associated with a large release of energy which accounts for its strong irreversibility . in the ferromagnetic metallic state , </S>",
    "<S> specific heat and magnetization measurements indicate a much smaller spin wave stiffness than that seen in any other ferromagnetic manganite , which we explain in terms of ferromagnetism among the pr moments . </S>",
    "<S> the pr ferromagnetism also appears to influence the low temperature thermodynamic phase diagram of this material and the uniquely sensitive metastability of the insulating state .    </S>",
