    "we define these in section  [ definition ] as divisors on @xmath6 , but for most purposes one can think of them as integers by considering their respective degrees . the invariant @xmath20 counts , with appropriate multiplicities , the number of singular fibers of @xmath7 .",
    "the self - intersection of the relative dualizing sheaf @xmath22 on @xmath7 defines @xmath21 , and its pushforward to @xmath6 is a rank @xmath11 locally free sheaf , whose determinant is @xmath19 .    the basic relation @xmath23 and the positivity of the three invariants for non - isotrivial families force the _ slope _ @xmath24 of @xmath25 to fall into the interval @xmath26 ( cf .",
    "[ slope - non - isotrivial ] ) .",
    "in fact , cornalba - harris and xiao establish for this slope an exact upper bound of @xmath27 , which is achieved only for certain hyperelliptic families ( cf .  theorem  [ chx ] ) .",
    "however , if the base curve @xmath6 passes through a _",
    "general _ point of @xmath5 , mumford - harris - eisenbud give the better bound of @xmath28 ( cf .",

    "the families violating this inequality are entirely contained in the closure @xmath29 of the locus of @xmath30-sheeted covers of @xmath31 , for a suitably chosen @xmath30 .",
    "in particular , for @xmath32 we recover the hyperelliptic locus @xmath16 , for @xmath33 - the trigonal locus @xmath17 , etc .",
    "therefore , higher than the above `` generic '' ratio can be obtained only for families with special linear series , such as @xmath34 , @xmath35 , etc .",
    "these observations clearly raise the following    * question . * _ according to the possession of special linear series , is there a stratification of @xmath12 which would give successively smaller slopes @xmath36 ? what would be the successive upper bounds with respect to such a stratification ? _    the following result , whose proof will be given in the paper , answers this question for an exact upper bound for families with linear series @xmath35 .",
    "* theorem i. * _ if @xmath37 is a trigonal nonisotrivial family with smooth general member , then the slope of @xmath25 satisfies : @xmath38 equality is achieved if and only if all fibers are irreducible , @xmath7 is a triple cover of a ruled surface @xmath39 over @xmath6 , and a certain divisor class @xmath40 on @xmath7 is numerically zero . _    to understand the importance of this result and the above question , consider mumford s alternative description of the basic invariants ( cf .",

    "thus , our question about a stratification of @xmath5 translates into a question about the relations among the fundamental classes of various subvarieties defined by geometric conditions in @xmath5 .",
    "moreover , such a stratification would provide a link between the _ global _ invariant @xmath4 ( the degree of the hodge bundle on @xmath12 ) and the _ locally defined _",
    "invariant @xmath3 of the singularities of our families . in the process of estimating the ratio @xmath47 we hope to understand the geometry of interesting loci in @xmath12 , and describe their rational picard groups",
    "such a program for the hyperelliptic locus @xmath16 is completed by cornalba - harris ( cf .",
    "theorem  [ theoremchpic ] ) , who exhibit generators and relations for @xmath48 .",
    "the typical examples of families with maximal ratio of @xmath49 are constructed as blow - ups of pencils of hyperelliptic curves , embedded in the same ruled surface .",
    "similar examples for trigonal families yield the slope @xmath50 , but as theorem i shows , this ratio is _ not _ an upper bound .",
    "this happens because of an `` extra '' _ maroni _ locus in @xmath17 ( cf .",
    "while a general trigonal curve embeds in @xmath51 or in the blow - up @xmath52 of @xmath53 at a point , the remaining trigonal curves embed in other rational ruled surfaces and comprise a closed subset in @xmath17 , called the maroni locus .",
    "the proof of theorem ii , stated below , implies that all trigonal families achieving the maximal bound lie entirely in the maroni locus , and moreover , their members are embedded in ruled surfaces `` as far as possible from the generic '' ruled surfaces @xmath54 and @xmath52 .    the ratio @xmath50 , though not the `` correct '' maximum , plays a significant role in understanding the geometry of the trigonal locus , and in describing its rational picard group . in particular , in a linear relation",

    "the stated theorems complete the program for the trigonal locus @xmath17 , which was outlined earlier in this section .    an important interpretation of these results can be traced back to @xcite , where it is shown that the moduli space @xmath73 is of _ general type_. the @xmath30-gonal locus @xmath29 is realized in terms of the generating classes as : @xmath74=a\\lambda - b\\delta-{\\mathcal}{e}$ ] for some @xmath75 , and an effective boundary combination @xmath76 .",
    "restricting to a general curve @xmath77 , we have @xmath78 , and hence @xmath79 .",
    "because of seshadri s criterion for ampleness of line bundles , in effect , we are asking for all positive numbers @xmath80 and @xmath81 such that the linear combination @xmath82 is ample on @xmath5 . the smaller the ratio @xmath83 is , the stronger result we obtain .",
    "in other words , we are aiming at a maximal bound of @xmath84 , when we think of these classes as restricted to any curve @xmath85 . in view of this ,",
    "part of this paper can be described as looking for all _ ample _ divisors on @xmath17 of the form @xmath82 with @xmath75 .",

    "two such elements are declared isomorphic under the obvious compatibility conditions .",
    "naturally , a line bundle on @xmath12 gives rise by pull - back to a line bundle on the moduli functor .",
    "in fact , this map is an inclusion with a torsion cokernel , and @xmath124 is torsion free and isomorphic to @xmath123 : @xmath129 hence we may regard all these groups as sublattices of @xmath110 .",
    "in particular , @xmath130 and any line bundle on the moduli functor can be thought of as a rational class on @xmath12 .",
    "these identifications allow us to make the following    * definition 2.1 . * in @xmath131",

    "it is easy to recognize the restrictions of @xmath108 and @xmath109 to a curve @xmath6 in @xmath5 as the previously defined @xmath88 and @xmath21 .",

    "the first fundamental result in this direction is the following    let @xmath89 be a nonisotrivial family with smooth general member .",
