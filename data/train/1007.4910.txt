    "in this section we analyze the case of a graphene bilayer in which only one of the layers has a finite intrinsic soc @xmath194 , whereas the other layer has zero coupling .",
    "this could happen in a bilayer in contact with a strong soc metal@xcite , or in a bilayer where heavy atoms or molecules have been deposited on top of one of the two layers@xcite .",
    "when only one of the layers is affected by the soc , the 2@xmath72 effective hamiltonian takes the form @xmath195 and the unit vector field @xmath196 has almost the same form as in eq .",
    "( [ h_bimeron ] ) .",
    "thus , the chern number of this system is equal to that of a graphene bilayer with intrinsic soc in both layers , @xmath197 although from the value of the chern number the system appears to be a topological insulator , this is not the case : it turns out it is not a true insulator at all . from the diagonalization of the hamiltonian of eq .",
    "( [ hproxi ] ) we get the band dispersion @xmath198 this band structure , shown in fig .",
    "[ bandas_proxi ] , corresponds to an indirect zero band gap semiconductor .",
    "the absence of soc in one of the layers breaks the inversion symmetry , making the bands non - degenerate under independent inversion of valley and spin .",
    ". left and right panels correspond to the bands near the @xmath184 and @xmath187 points , respectively .",
    "bands for states with spin up @xmath199 ( down @xmath200 ) are represented with solid ( dashed ) lines .",
    "the fermi energy is indicated by an dotted horizontal line .",
    "the soc opens a gap @xmath188 with a different sign for each valley and each spin orientation.,width=302 ]    when both valleys and/or both spins are considered , there is no gap in the spectrum .",
    "however , for each spin and valley there is an energy gap @xmath188 at @xmath201 , and the system is thus an insulator from an _ optical _ point of view . moreover , if the system is free from perturbations that mix the two valleys and the two spins , it will also behave as an effective electronic insulator .",
    "this has an important consequence on the existence of surface states in the bilayer structure . in zigzag edge terminations for which it is not necessary to admix valleys to satisfy the boundary conditions@xcite ,",
    "states coming from different valleys can be treated independently and dispersive surface localized channels appear in the spectrum , see fig .",
    "[ edge_proxi](a ) . however , for armchair terminated ribbons where , in order to satisfy the boundary conditions , the wavefunctions have to be a linear combination of both valleys , no localized surface states appear in the band structure , see fig .",
    "[ edge_proxi](b ) .",
    "the absence of a full energy gap and the lack of surface states in some boundary terminations are clear indicators that a graphene bilayer with soc in only one layer is not a quantum spin hall system .",
    "results for @xmath20=-1 are obtained by changing @xmath202 to @xmath203 . in the numerics @xmath204 and @xmath205 .",
    "the width of the armchair and zigzag nanoribbons is 151@xmath31 and 120@xmath206 respectively . in the armchair case",
    "all the states are extended across the ribbon . in the zigzag one",
    "the states in the center of the brillouin zone are localized at the edges .",
    ", width=302 ]",
    "in this work we reviewed the description of single layer graphene with soc as a topological insulator in terms of the first chern number , which arises naturally in the computation of the hall conductivity .",
    "we showed then that the chern number per spin in bilayer graphene is two , twice that of the monolayer .",
    "this doubling is reflected also in the number of topological surface states , as a consequence of the bulk - surface correspondence rule . by numerically computing the spectrum of finite size samples",
    ", we checked that bilayer systems have twice as many edge states as a monolayer .",
    "this was furthermore confirmed analytically in the case of surfaces with armchair termination .",
    "the fact that the total chern number per spin is even means that the bilayer system is a weak topological insulator , susceptible to gap opening if the system is subject to spin - mixing perturbations ( such as a weak rashba soc ) .",
    "we also assessed the general stability of the bulk topological insulating state of bilayer graphene with respect to rashba soc , a staggered sublattice potential , interlayer bias , and trigonal warping .",
    "the first three perturbations compete with the intrinsic soc and , when sufficiently large , spoil the inverted gap property that is crucial to making the system a topological insulator .",
    "finally , we examined a bilayer graphene system in which only one layer has intrinsic soc .",
    "although in this system individual valleys have non - trivial chern numbers , the spectrum as a whole is not gapped , so that the system is not a topological insulator .",
    "_ note added : _ while this manuscript was in the final stage of preparation , a manuscript by cortijo , grushim and vozmediano appeared@xcite which studies the chern simons coefficients in graphene and bilayer graphene using an effective action formalism .",
