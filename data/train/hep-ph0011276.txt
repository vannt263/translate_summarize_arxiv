    "single-@xmath0 production processes present an opportunity to study the anomalous triple gauge - couplings(tgc)@xcite in the experiments at lep2 and at future @xmath1 linear colliders . for their precise predictions of cross sections",
    "the inclusion of an initial state radiative correction(isr ) is inevitable in the event - generator . as a tool for the isr the structure function(sf)@xcite and",
    "the parton shower@xcite methods has been widely used for @xmath2 annihilation processes . for the case of the single-@xmath0 production processes ,",
    "however , the main contribution comes from non - annihilation type diagrams .",
    "the universal factorization method used for the annihilation processes is obviously inappropriate .",
    "the main problem lies in choosing the energy scale of the factorization .",
    "a previous study on the two photon process@xcite has shown that the sf and qed parton shower(qedps ) methods are able to reproduce precisely the exact @xmath3 results even for non - annihilation processes , as long as the appropriate energy scale is used .    in this report a general method to find the energy scale for sf and qedps is proposed",
    ". then numerical results of testing sf and qedps for @xmath4 and @xmath5 are presented .",
    "systematic errors are also discussed .",
    "the factorization theorem for qed radiative corrections in the leading - logarithmic approximation is valid independent of the structure of the matrix element of the kernel process . hence sf and",
    "qedps must be applicable to _ any _ @xmath1 scattering processes .",
    "however , choice of the energy scale in sf and qedps is not a trivial matter@xcite . for simple processes considered so far like @xmath1 annihilation and two - photon process with only multi - peripheral diagrams ,",
    "the evolution energy scale could be found by the exact perturbative calculations",
    ". however , this is not always the case when more complicated processes are concerned .",
    "hence a way to find a suitable energy scale without knowing exact loop calculations should be established somehow .",
    "first let us look at the general consequence of the soft photon approximation .",
    "the cross section with radiations in the soft - photon limit is given by the born cross section multiplied by the following factor up to the double - log term as @xcite @xmath6 \\right|^2 , \\label{ir } \\\\",
    "\\beta_{ij } & = & \\left(1-\\frac{m_i^2 m_j^2 } { ( p_i \\cdot p_j)^2}\\right)^{\\frac{1}{2}},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath7(@xmath8 ) are the mass(momentum ) of the @xmath9-th charged particle , @xmath10 the maximum energy of the soft photon(the value to separate soft- and hard - photons ) , @xmath11 the beam energy and @xmath12 the electric charge in unit of the @xmath13 charge .",
    "the factor @xmath14 is @xmath15 for the initial particles and @xmath16 for the final particles .",
    "the indices ( @xmath17 ) run over all the charged particles in the initial and final states .",
    "for the two - photon process , @xmath18 , it is shown in ref.@xcite that the soft - photon factor in eq.([ir ] ) with a ( @xmath19)-term reproduces the @xmath3 corrections@xcite up to the double - log term in the soft - photon limit .",
    "this implies that one is able to read off the possible evolution energy scale in sf from eq.([ir ] ) without doing explicit loop calculations .",
    "the point is the observation that the energy scale @xmath20 does not appear in the soft - photon corrections even they are included in the general formula eq.([ir ] ) . in the case of the two - photon process",
    "we have ignored those terms in sf which come from the photon bridged between different charged lines , because the contributions from the box diagrams with a photon exchange between @xmath13 and @xmath21 is known to be small@xcite .",
    "fortunately the infrared part of the loop corrections is already included in eq.([ir ] ) and there is no need to know the full form of the loop diagram .",
    "let us look at two terms with , for example ( @xmath22)- and ( @xmath23)-terms . the momentum of @xmath21 is almost the same before and after the scattering(@xmath24 ) .",
    "only the difference appears in @xmath25 for a ( @xmath26)-term and @xmath27 for a ( @xmath28)-term .",
    "then these terms compensate each other after summing them up for the forward scattering which is the dominant kinematical region of this process .",
    "this is the mechanism that the energy scale @xmath20 does not appear in the soft - photon correction despite that it exists in eq.([ir ] ) .",
    "when some experimental cuts are imposed , for example the final @xmath21 is tagged in a large angle , this cancellation is not perfect but partial and the energy scale @xmath29 must appear in the soft - photon correction . in this case",
    "the annihilation type diagrams will also give a contribution .",
    "then it may happen that the usual sf and qedps for the annihilation processes are justified to be used for the isr with the energy scale @xmath29 . to find the most dominant energy scale under the given experimental cuts an easy way is to integrate numerically the soft - photon cross section given by eq.([ir ] ) over the allowed kinematical region .",
    "thus in order to determine the energy scale it is sufficient to know the infrared behavior of the radiative process using the soft - photon factor .",
    "let us determine the energy - scale of the qed radiative corrections to the single-@xmath0 production process , @xmath30 the soft - photon correction factor in eq.([ir ] ) is numerically integrated with the born matrix element of the process ( [ pc1 ] ) only with the @xmath31-channel diagrams without any cut on the final fermions . in order to separate the contribution from each term",
    ", we take terms up to @xmath3 in taylor expansion of exponential function in eq.([ir ] ) .",
    "parameters used in the calculation will be explained in section 4 .",
    "the results are shown in table [ grace : tb1 ] .",
    "one can see that the main contribution comes from an electron charged - line ( @xmath32-term ) and a positron charged - line ( @xmath33-terms=@xmath34-term + @xmath35-term + @xmath36-term ) , while all other contributions are negligiblly small . like the two - photon processes the energy scale @xmath29 does not appear in the soft - photon correction .",
    ".soft - photon correction factor from sets of the charged particle combinations for the process of @xmath37 at the cm energy of 200 gev .",
    "the factor from all terms is normalized to unity .",
    "@xmath38gev is used .",
    "@xmath33=@xmath34-term + @xmath35-term + @xmath36-term . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     it has been pointed out that a tiny violation of the gauge invariance caused by the inclusion of a finite @xmath0-boson width results a wrong cross section for single-@xmath0 production@xcite . to cure this problem",
    "the fermion - loop scheme@xcite has been proposed .",
    "it is reported in ref.@xcite , however , that no significant difference is seen between the fermion - loop scheme and the fixed width scheme . thus in this report the fixed width scheme , together with an appropriately modified current , described in @xcite is employed .",
    "for the total energy of the emitted photons both methods , sf and qedps , must give the same spectrum once the same energy scale is used .",
    "this is confirmed for the semi - leptonic process as shown in fig.[fig - grace - singlw-1 ] at the cm energy of 200 gev .",
    "we choose the same energy - evolution scale as sf described by eq.([correction ] ) .",
    "total cross sections as a function of the cm energies at lep2 with no cuts are shown in fig.[fig - grace - singlw-2 ] .",
    "the effect of the qed radiative corrections on the total cross sections are obtained to be 7 to 8% in the lep2 energy region .",
    "if one used an inappropriate energy scale , say @xmath29 , in sf , the isr effect is overestimated about 4% as seen in fig.[fig - grace - singlw-2 ] .",
    "the result of sf is consistent with the qedps around 0.2% if the proper energy scale is employed .",
    "there is some ambiguity to choose the energy - evolution scale in the leading - log order .",
    "for example the transverse - momentum squared or the invariant - mass squared of @xmath39 ( or @xmath40 ) systems could be a candidate of the energy scale .",
    "it is found that even these energy scales are chosen in qedps instead of @xmath41 , the total cross sections change by only 0.6% , which must be allocated to the theoretical uncertainty .",
    "the energy and angular distributions of the hard photon from qedps are compared with those obtained from the exact matrix elements .",
    "the cross sections of the radiative process @xmath42 are calculated based on the exact amplitudes generated by @xmath43 and integrated numerically in five - body phase space using @xmath44 .",
    "again only the @xmath31-channel diagrams(non - annihilation diagrams ) are taken into account . to compare the distributions the soft - photon corrections for the radiative process",
    "must be included .",
    "for this purpose qedps is implemented into the @xmath45 calculations with a careful treatment to avoid a double - counting of the radiation effect .",
    "the definition of the hard photon is    1 .",
    "@xmath46 gev , 2 .",
    "opening angle between the photon and the nearest final - state charged particles is greater than @xmath47 .",
    "the distributions of the hard photons are in good agreement as seen in fig.[fig - grace - singlw-4 ] .",
    "the total cross section of the hard photon emission agrees each other in 2% level .",
    "we also calculated the radiative cross - section without soft - photon correction .",
    "if the soft - photon correction is not included in the radiative process , we find a 30% overestimation of the radiative cross - section with above experimental cuts .",
    "it is also investigated how large the effects of the qed radiative corrections is for the single-@xmath0 production when realistic experimental conditions are imposed .",
    "the experimental cuts applied here are @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 . for this study",
    "all the diagrams , not only the @xmath31-channel diagrams but also the @xmath29-channel , are taken into account in the calculations .",
    "the dominance of the signal from @xmath31-channel diagrams is 97%(90% ) for the hadronic(leptonic ) decay of the @xmath0 boson , respectively .",
    "total cross sections as a function of the cm energies at lep2 with these cuts are shown in fig.[fig - grace - singlw-3 ] .",
    "the qed radiative corrections on the total cross sections are found to be 7 to 8% in this lep2 energy range .",
    "if one uses the inappropriate energy scale @xmath29 in sf , the isr effect is overestimated by around 5% , which is larger than those of the no - cut case .",
    "sf with the proper energy scale shows a deviation from qedps around 0.5% for @xmath51 process and 1.0% for @xmath52 . the agreement between qedps and sf becomes worse than the no - cut case , because the finite transverse - momentum of the emitted photons by qedps changes the acceptance of the above electron - veto requirement .",
    "hence for the realistic experimental conditions the finite transverse - momentum of emitted photons should not be ignored .",
    "finally a possible effect of the systematic error of the isr effect on the anomalous tgc measurements is investigated .",
    "if the inappropriate energy scale is used in the isr tools such as the cm - energy squared , the total cross sections with the experimental cuts includes 5% systematic error .",
    "even if one used one of proper energy scales , there is 0.6% uncertainty on the cross sections due to ambiguity of the energy scale selection .",
    "these uncertainty of the total cross sections limits the experimental sensitivity of the anomalous tgc measurements .",
    "total cross - sections of @xmath53 and @xmath54 processes with experimental cuts as a function of the anomalous tgc is summarized in fig.[fig6 ] .",
    "the cross sections are obtained at the cm - energy of 200 gev with all diagrams .",
    "a bound shown in dashed lines shows @xmath55% cross section variation from its standard model value .",
    "if one used the inappropriate energy scale , it affects @xmath56 on @xmath57 measurement and @xmath58 on @xmath59 measurement .",
    "the ambiguity of the energy - scale selection gives the systematic error of less than 0.01 on @xmath57 and 0.1 on @xmath59 .",
    "the method to apply the qed radiative correction to the non - annihilation process was established . the conventional method , sf with the energy scale @xmath29 gave about 4% overestimation in the lep2 energies .",
    "the uncertainty due to the energy - scale determination was estimated to be about 0.6% .",
    "this uncertainty may affect the anomalous tgc measurements less than 0.01 on @xmath57 and 0.1 on @xmath59 .",
    "if one wants to look at the hard photon spectrum , the soft - photon correction to these radiative processes are needed .    in this report",
    "we have treated two processes @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "the cp conjugate processes @xmath60 and @xmath61 give the same results and the other channels @xmath62 and @xmath63 will show slightly different results due to their masses . on the other hand the self cp - conjugate process @xmath64 has an additional complexity , because two energy scales @xmath65 and @xmath66 can appear simultaneously .",
