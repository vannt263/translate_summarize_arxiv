    "this paper and its companion paper ii @xcite study @xmath1 dynamics , i.e. , dynamics that conserves the potential energy @xmath3 for a system of @xmath0 classical particles at constant volume @xmath4 .",
    "@xmath1 dynamics is deterministic and involves only the system s configurational degrees of freedom .",
    "@xmath1 dynamics is characterized by the system moving along a so - called _ geodesic _ curve on the constant potential - energy hypersurface @xmath5 defined by    @xmath6    mathematically , @xmath5 is a @xmath7 dimensional differentiable manifold . since it is imbedded in @xmath8 , @xmath5 has a natural euclidean metric and it is thus a so - called riemannian manifold @xcite .",
    "the differential geometry of hypersurfaces is discussed in , for instance , ref . .",
    "a geodesic curve on a riemannian manifold by definition minimizes the distance between any two of its points that are sufficiently close to each other ( the curve is characterized by realizing the `` locally shortest distance '' between points ) . more generally , a geodesic is defined by the property that for any curve variation keeping the two end points @xmath9 and @xmath10 fixed , to lowest order the curve length does not change , i.e. ,    @xmath11    here @xmath12 denotes the line element of the metric .    from a physical point of view",
    "it is sometimes useful to regard a geodesic as a curve along which the system moves at constant velocity with zero friction .",
    "such motion means that at any time the force is perpendicular to the surface , and because the force performs no work , the kinetic energy is conserved . in this way",
    "geodesic motion generalizes newton s first law , the law of inertia , to curved surfaces .",
    "the concept of geodesic motion is central in general relativity , where motion in a gravitational field follows a geodesic curve in the four - dimensional curved space - time @xcite .",
    "a general motivation for studying @xmath1 dynamics is the following .",
    "since all relevant information about a system is encoded in the potential - energy function , it is interesting from a philosophical point of view to study and compare different dynamics relating to @xmath13 .",
    "the `` purest '' of these dynamics does not involve momenta and relates only to configuration space .",
    "@xmath1 dynamics provides such a dynamics .",
    "in contrast to brownian dynamics , which also relates exclusively to the configurational degrees of freedom , @xmath1 dynamics is deterministic . @xmath1",
    "dynamics may be viewed as an attempt to understand the dynamic implications of the potential energy landscape s geometry along the lines of recent works by stratt and coworkers @xcite .",
    "our interest in @xmath1 dynamics originated in recent results concerning strongly correlating liquids and their isomorphs .",
    "a liquid is termed strongly correlating if there is more than 90% correlation between its virial and potential energy thermal equilibrium fluctuations in the @xmath14 ensemble @xcite .",
    "the class of strongly correlating liquids includes most or all van der waals and metallic liquids , whereas hydrogen - bonding , covalently bonded liquids , and ionic liquids are generally not strongly correlating .",
    "a liquid is strongly correlating if and only if it to a good approximation has `` isomorphs '' in its phase diagram @xcite . by definition",
    "two state points are isomorphic @xcite if any two microconfigurations of the state points , which can be trivially scaled into one another , have identical canonical probabilities ; an isomorph is a curve in the phase diagram for which any two pairs of points are isomorphic .",
    "only inverse - power - law liquids have exact isomorphs , but simulations show that lennard - jones type liquids have isomorphs to a good approximation @xcite .",
    "this is consistent with these liquids being strongly correlating @xcite .",
    "many properties are invariant along an isomorph , for instance the excess entropy , the isochoric heat capacity , scaled radial distribution functions , dynamic properties in reduced units , etc @xcite ; the reduced - unit constant - potential - energy hypersurface @xmath15 is also invariant along an isomorph @xcite . given that several properties are invariant along a strongly correlating liquid s isomorphs and that @xmath15 is invariant as well , an obvious idea is that @xmath15 s invariance is the fundamental fact from which all other isomorph invariants follow .",
    "for instance , the excess entropy is the logarithm of the area of @xmath15 , so the excess entropy s isomorph invariance follows directly from that of @xmath15 . in order to understand the dynamic isomorph invariants from the @xmath15 perspective",
    "a dynamics is required that refers exclusively to @xmath15 .",
    "one possibility is diffusive dynamics , but a mathematically even more elegant dynamics on a differentiable manifold is that of geodesics .",
    "although these considerations were our original motivation , it should be emphasized that that the concept of geodesic motion on @xmath15 ( or @xmath5 ) is general and makes sense for any classical mechanical system , strongly correlating or not .",
    "we are not the first to consider dynamics on the constant - potential - energy hypersurface . in papers dating back to 1986 @xcite cotterill and",
    "madsen proposed a deterministic constant - potential - energy algorithm similar , but not identical , to the basic @xmath1 algorithm derived below .",
    "their algorithm was not discussed in relation to geodesic curves , but aimed at providing an alternative way to understanding vacancy diffusion in crystals and , in particular , to make easier the identification of energy barriers than from ordinary md simulations .",
    "the latter property is not confirmed in the present papers , however  we find that @xmath1 dynamics in the thermodynamic limit becomes equivalent to standard @xmath2 dynamics ( paper ii @xcite ) .",
    "later scala _ et al . _ studied diffusive dynamics on the constant - potential - energy hypersurface @xmath5 @xcite , focusing on the entropic nature of barriers by regarding these as `` bottlenecks '' .",
    "this point was also made by cotterill and madsen who viewed @xmath5 as consisting of `` pockets '' connected by thin paths , referred to as `` tubes '' , acting as entropy barriers .",
    "reasoning along similar lines , stratt and coworkers published in 2007 and 2010 three papers @xcite , which considered paths in the so - called potential - energy - landscape ensemble .",
    "this novel ensemble is defined as including all configurations with potential energy less than or equal to some potential energy @xmath16 .",
    "a geodesic in the potential - energy - landscape ensemble consists of a curve that is partly geodesic on the constant - potential - energy surface @xmath5 , partly a straight line in the space defined by @xmath17 @xcite .",
    "s picture shifts  perspective from finding stationary points on the potential energy landscape to finding and characterizing the accessible pathways through the landscape . within this perspective pathways",
    "would be slow , not because they have to climb over high barriers , but because they have to take a long and tortuous route to avoid such barriers .... \" @xcite .",
    "thus the more `` convoluted and laborinthine '' the geodesics are , the slower is the dynamics @xcite .",
    "apart from these three sources of inspiration to the present work , we note that geodesic motion on differentiable manifolds has been studied in several other contexts outside of pure mathematics , see , e.g. , ref . .",
    "the present paper derives and documents an algorithm for @xmath1 geodesic dynamics . in sec .",
    "ii we derive the basic @xmath1 algorithm . by construction",
    "this algorithm is time reversible , a feature that ensures a number of important properties @xcite .",
    "section iii discusses how to implement the @xmath1 algorithm and tests improvements of the basic @xmath1 algorithm designed for ensuring stability , which is done by single - precision simulations .",
    "this section arrives at the final @xmath1 algorithm and demonstrates that it conserves potential energy , step length , and center - of - mass position in arbitrarily long simulations .",
    "section iv briefly investigates the sampling properties of the @xmath1 algorithm , showing that it gives results for the lennard - jones liquid that are equivalent to those of standard @xmath2 dynamics .",
    "finally , sec .",
    "v gives some concluding comments .",
    "paper ii compares @xmath1 simulations to results for four other dynamics , concluding that @xmath1 dynamics is a fully valid molecular dynamics .",
    "for simplicity of notation we consider in this paper only systems of particles of identical masses ( appendix a of paper ii generalizes the algorithm to systems of varying particle masses ) .",
    "the full set of positions in the @xmath18-dimensional configuration space is collectively denoted by @xmath19 , i.e. ,    @xmath20    likewise , the full @xmath18-dimensional force vector is denoted by @xmath21 . this section derives the basic @xmath1 algorithm for geodesic motion on the constant - potential - energy hypersurface @xmath5 defined in eq .",
    "( [ omega_def ] ) , an algorithm that allows one to compute the positions in step @xmath22 , @xmath23 , from @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "although a mathematical geodesic on a differentiable manifold is usually parameterized by its curve length @xcite , it is useful to think of a geodesic curve on @xmath5 as parameterized by time , and we shall refer to the steps of the algorithm as `` time steps '' .    locally , a geodesic is the shortest path between any two of its points . more precisely : 1 ) for any two points on a riemannian manifold the shortest path between them is a geodesic ; 2 ) the property of a curve being geodesic is locally defined ; 3 ) a geodesic curve has the property that for any two of its points , which are sufficiently close to each other , the curve gives the shortest path between them .",
    "a geodesic may , in fact , be the _",
    "longest _ distance between two of its points .",
    "for instance , the shortest and the longest flight between two cities on our globe both follow great circles  these are both geodesics . in any case",
    ", the property of being geodesic is always equivalent to the curve length being _ stationary _ in the following sense : small curve variations , which do not move the curve s end points , to lowest order lead to no change in the curve length .    for motion on @xmath5 the constraint of constant potential energy",
    "is taken into account by introducing lagrangian multipliers . for each time step @xmath26",
    "there is the constraint @xmath27 and a corresponding lagrangian multiplier @xmath28 .",
    "thus the stationarity condition eq .",
    "( [ geod ] ) for the discretized curve length @xmath29 subject to the constraint of constant potential energy , is    @xmath30    since @xmath31 and the @xmath18-dimensional force is given by @xmath32 , putting to zero the variation of eq .",
    "( [ nvu2 ] ) with respect to @xmath25 ( i.e. , the partial derivative @xmath33 ) leads to    @xmath34    to solve these equations we make the ansatz of constant displacement length for each time step ,    @xmath35 ) corresponds to constant velocity in the geodesic motion . with this ansatz eq .",

    "the algorithm is initialized by choosing two nearby points in configuration space with the same potential energy within machine precision .    the derivation of the basic @xmath1 algorithm is completed by checking its consistency with the constant step length ansatz eq .",

    "appendix a shows that the basic @xmath1 algorithm is symplectic , i.e. , that it conserves the configuration - space volume element in the same way as @xmath2 dynamics does .",

    "the importance of this difference is apparent when it is realized that the pect algorithm implies @xmath58 , whereas it does not imply the time - reversed identity @xmath59 .",

    "we end this section by reflecting on what is the relation between the @xmath1 algorithm and continuous geodesic curves on @xmath5",
    ". can one expect that if the step length is decreased towards zero , the discrete sequence of points traced out by the algorithm converges to a continuous geodesic curve ?",
    "the answer is yes , as is clear from the current literature that treats this problem in considerable detail @xcite .",
    "the literature deals with the analogous problem of classical mechanics where , as is well known , newton s second law of motion can be derived from the principle of least action ( hamilton s principle ) .",
    "this is a variational principle . in the traditional approach",
    "one first derives continuous equations of motion from the variational principle , then discretizes these equations to allow for computer simulations . here",
    "we first discretized the quantity subject to the variational principle ( eq . ( [ nvu2 ] ) ) and only thereafter applied variational calculus .",
    "euler himself first described discretization of time in the action integral , thus obtaining discretized versions of the euler - lagrange equations .",
    "there is now a large literature on this subject @xcite . during the last decade , in particular ,",
    "variational calculations applied _ after _ discretization have come into focus in connection with for instance the development of algorithms for the control of robots .",
    "the general consensus is the following ( we quote below from ref . that provides an excellent , brief summary of the situation ) : `` the driving idea behind this discrete geometric mechanics is to leverage the variational nature of mechanics and to preserve this variational structure in the discrete setting ... if one designs a discrete equivalent of the lagrangian , then discrete equations of motion can be easily derived from it by paralleling the derivations followed in continuous case , and good numerical methods will come from discrete analogs to the euler - lagrange equations .",
    "in essence , good numerical methods will come from discrete analogs to the euler - lagrange equations ",
    "equations that truly derive from a variational principle ...",

    "the red dots give @xmath1 simulation results , the black curve @xmath2 .",
    "clearly the two algorithms give the same results .",
    "this finding is consistent with the conjecture that the @xmath1 algorithm probes all points on @xmath5 with equal probability .",
    "note that this is not mathematically equivalent to conjecturing that the @xmath1 algorithm probes the configuration space microcanonical ensemble , which has equal probability density everywhere in a thin energy shell between a pair of constant - potential - energy manifolds .",
    "the latter distribution would imply a density of points on @xmath5 proportional to the length of the gradient of @xmath108 ( the force ) , but this distribution can not be the correct equilibrium distribution because the basic @xmath1 algorithm eq .",
    "( [ nvu1 ] ) is invariant to local scaling of the force . in the thermodynamic limit",

    "the algorithm reproduces the @xmath2 radial distribution function of the lj liquid , strongly indicating that correct configuration - space averages are arrived at in @xmath1 dynamics .",
    "although @xmath1 dynamics has no kinetic energy providing a heat bath , it does allow for a realistic description of processes that are unlikely because they are thermally activated with energy barriers that are large compared to @xmath109 ( paper ii ) . in @xmath1 dynamics ,",
    "whenever a molecular rearrangement requires excess energy to accumulate locally , this extra energy is provided by the surrounding configurational degrees of freedom .",
    "these provide a heat bath in much the same way as the kinetic energy provides a heat bath for standard newtonian @xmath2 dynamics .",
    "the companion paper ( ii ) compares the dynamics of the kob - andersen binary lennard - jones liquid simulated by the @xmath1 algorithm and four other algorithms ( @xmath2 , @xmath14 , diffusion on @xmath5 , monte carlo dynamics ) , concluding that results are equivalent for the slow degrees of freedom .",
