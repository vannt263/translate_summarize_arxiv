    "the ability of a slw to deflect , channel and split atomic beams @xcite has been used for a variety of applications including atom microscopy , interferometry , isotope separation and optical lithography @xcite .",
    "lasers can be used to manipulate atomic trajectories to create atomic analogues of such familiar optical phenomena as focusing of light , beam splitting and light scattering .",
    "it is remarkable that now we are able to reverse the roles of light and matter from their familiar roles .",
    "the semiclassical description , used in this paper , is similar to the geometric optics limit in conventional optics .",
    "atomic trajectories play the role of light rays with the slw being a light mask .    in the present paper",
    "we intend to demonstrate theoretically and numerically that adjusting in an experiment only one parameter , the detuning between the frequencies of a working atomic transition and the slw , one can explore a variety of the regimes of the atom - laser interaction to focus , split and scatter atomic beams . near the atom - field resonance , where the interaction between the internal and external atomic degrees of freedom is intense , there is a possibility to create conditions for chaotic scattering of atoms @xcite without any additional efforts like a slw modulation .",
    "it becomes possible due to the peculiarities of the dipole force in a near - resonant optical lattice @xcite .",

    "the motion is regular both in the trapping and ballistic modes .",
    "it is remarkable that there is a specific type of motion , chaotic walking in a deterministic optical potential , when atoms can change the direction of motion alternating between flying through the slw and being trapped in its potential wells .",
    "we would like to stress that the local instability produces chaotic center - of - mass motion in a rigid slw without any modulation of its parameters .",
    "chaotic walking occurs due to the specific behavior of the bloch - vector component of a moving atom @xmath34 whose shallow oscillations between the slw nodes are interrupted by sudden jumps with different amplitudes while atom crosses each node of the slw @xcite .",
    "it looks like a random like shots happened in a fully deterministic environment .",
    "it follows from the second equation in the set  ( [ hamsys ] ) that those jumps result in jumps of the atomic momentum while crossing a node of the slw .",
    "if the value of the atomic energy is close to the separatrix one , the atom after the corresponding jump - like change in @xmath45 can either overcome the potential barrier and leave a potential well or it will be trapped by the well , or it will move as before . the jump - like behavior of @xmath34 is the ultimate reason of chaotic atomic walking along a rigid sw .",
    "the total atomic energy ( [ h ] ) consists of the kinetic one , @xmath46 , and the potential one , @xmath47 .",
    "the optical potential changes its depth in course of time . averaging over fast oscillations of the internal atomic variables",
    ", we get the averaged potential @xmath48 that can be used to explain why atoms move in such or another way .    at small detunings @xmath49 ,",
    "the potential is approximately @xmath50 .",
    "if @xmath51 , then the atom will move ballistically .",
    "this occurs if the initial atomic momentum , @xmath52 , satisfies to the condition @xmath53 .",
    "if the initial conditions are chosen to give @xmath54 , the corresponding atoms with @xmath55 are expected to move chaotically at the appropriate values of @xmath56 .      in this section",
    "we demonstrate how to focus and split atomic beams crossing a gaussian laser beam by varying only one of the control parameters , the atom - field detuning @xmath56 .",
    "firstly , we perform simulation with a negligible probability of spontaneous emission and solve the hamiltonian equations of motion ( [ hamsys ] ) at comparatively large value of the detuning , @xmath57 . to be concrete we take as an example calcium atoms with the working intercombination transition @xmath58 at @xmath59  nm , the recoil frequency @xmath60  khz , and the lifetime of the excited state @xmath61  ms .",
    "taking the maximal rabi frequency to be @xmath62  hz , the radius of the laser beam @xmath63  cm , and the mean longitudinal velocity @xmath64  m / s , the interaction time is estimated to be @xmath65  ms , longer than the atomic lifetime .",
    "the normalized recoil frequency is @xmath66 and the normalized characteristic time is @xmath67 .",

    "this range is @xmath73 .",
    "the focusing occurs at those moments of time when the average transverse momentum in the atomic beam is approximately equal to zero .",
    "if one turns off the laser at one of these moments , it becomes possible to reduce the beam width practically in ten times .",
    "the reason of focusing is simple .",
    "it is well known @xcite that at positive blue detunings atoms are attracted to the nodes of the slw where the minima of the optical potential are situated at @xmath74 .",
    "the first node the atoms reach at @xmath75 is situated at @xmath76 .",
    "the initial kinetic atomic energy , @xmath77 , is not enough to overcome the potential barrier whose depth can be estimated to be @xmath78 because the simulation gives @xmath79 and @xmath80 .",
    "so , all the atoms in the beam oscillate in the first potential well in the @xmath2-direction around the first node . the initial width of the beam , @xmath81 , is gradually reduced because in course of time the atoms with initial negative positions catch up with the ones with positive @xmath82 near the first turning point where the average beam momentum is close to zero .",
    "the time interval of the atomic interaction with the slw field is estimated to be @xmath83 .",
    "so , the atoms leave the potential well after that time and move freely ( see fig .  [ fig1 ] ) .    in order to take into account spontaneous emission",
    "we use the standard stochastic wave - function technique @xcite for solving eqs .",
    "( [ mainsys ] ) . the integration time is divided into a large number of small time intervals @xmath84 . at the end of the first interval , @xmath85 ,",

    "this one needs to choose such the value of the detuning in order that some atoms in the beam would be trapped in the first well of the optical potential but another ones could overcome the barrier and leave that well .",

    ", we demonstrate in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] the effect of splitting at @xmath104 for atoms without and with spontaneous emission .",
    "it is seen that spontaneous emission changes slightly the effect because a few atoms may leave the potential wells due to random recoils .",
    "the ability of blue and red detuned lasers to attract atoms to the nodes and antinodes of the slw , respectively , can be used to create periodic structures composed of atoms deposited on substrates in the process of optical nanolithography @xcite . to simulate a real experiment we consider a beam with @xmath105 calcium atoms with the initial gaussian distribution ( with the rms @xmath106 and the average values @xmath107 and @xmath70 ) and",

    "it is known from many studies in celestial mechanics , fluid dynamics and other disciplines that under certain conditions the motion inside the interaction region may have features that are typical for dynamical chaos , ( homoclinic and heteroclinic tangles , fractals , strange invariant sets , positive finite - time lyapunov exponents , etc . )",
    "although the particle s trajectories are not chaotic in a rigorous sense because chaos is strictly defined as an irregular motion over infinite time .",
    "it has been found @xcite that transient hamiltonian chaos in the interaction region occurs due to existence of , at least , one nonattractive chaotic invariant set consisting of an infinite number of localized unstable periodic orbits and aperiodic orbits .",
    "this set possesses stable and unstable manifolds extending in the phase space into the regions of regular motion .",
    "the particles with the initial positions close to the stable manifold follow the chaotic - set trajectories for a comparatively long time , then deviate from them , and leave the interaction region along the unstable manifold .",
    "it is the common mechanism of chaotic scattering that in our problem causes the chaotic walking of atoms along the slw .",

    "the effects have been explained by a coupling between external and internal atomic degrees of freedom .",
    "the depth of the optical potential depends on the sign and value of the detuning . varying @xmath56",
    ", one can create conditions for focusing , splitting and bunching the atoms .",
    "it is remarkable that near the atom - field resonance we have found the new type of atomic diffraction at a slw without any modulation of its parameters that can be observed in real experiments",
    ". that would be the prove of existence of the novel type of atomic motion , chaotic walking in a deterministic environment .",
    "the effects found could be used in optical nanolithography to fabricate complex atomic structures on substrates .",
    "we predict that experiments on the scattering of atomic beams at a slw can directly image chaotic walking of atoms along the slw . in a real experiment",
    "the final spatial distribution can be recorded via fluorescence or absorption imaging on a ccd , commonly used methods in atom optics experiments yielding information on the number of atoms and the cloud s spatial size .",
    "the other possibility is a nanofabrication where the atoms after the interaction with the sw are deposited on a silicon substrate in a high vacuum chamber . in this case",
    "the spatial distribution can be analyzed with an atomic force microscope .",
