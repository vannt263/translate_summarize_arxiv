    "the skyrme model @xcite is a popular model of the dynamics of pions and nucleons , incorporating the former as its fundamental , pseudo - goldstone field and the latter as topological solitons .",
    "the continuum theory has been widely studied via semiclassical techniques , giving a satisfactory phenomenology of low - momentum and low - temperature physics . in this paper",
    "we develop a lattice formulation of the model .",
    "our motivation in employing a lattice cutoff is to overcome the limitations of the continuum theory . in point of fact , the term `` continuum theory '' is misleading .",
    "the skyrme lagrangian is a non - linear sigma model with a four - derivative term , which makes it non - renormalizable in perturbation theory .",
    "this means that calculations of quantum effects must involve a short - distance cutoff . in working with chiral lagrangians coupled to a local nucleon field ,",
    "this is not a serious problem @xcite .",
    "one absorbs divergences into an ever - lengthening list of counterterms ; as long as external momenta are kept small , dimensional analysis limits the contributions of these counterterms to the results",
    ". when the nucleon is a soliton rather than a fundamental field , however , things are more difficult .",
    "the soliton s collective degrees of freedom are quantized separately , and the systematic development of higher - order quantum effects involves disentangling the pion field from these collective quanta @xcite . in any case",
    ", there is no way to limit the addition of higher - dimension terms to the lagrangian as long as one must consider energy scales approaching the nucleon mass .",
    "we propose to turn these points to advantage , by considering the skyrme model as an effective field theory .",
    "the cutoff , and the cutoff scheme ( the lattice ) , are part and parcel of the specification of the theory .",
    "the free choice of terms in the lagrangian is now a virtue , constrained only by phenomenological necessity .",
    "the procedure will be to pick a lagrangian ; to fix the lattice spacing ; and finally to calculate any physical quantity of interest , going beyond perturbation theory and beyond semiclassical methods , since the lattice offers many more direct techniques . from a lattice point of view , the fixed cutoff is a virtue as well , since no continuum limit is necessary ( nor is it possible ) .",
    "the most interesting feature of the skyrme model is the stability conferred on the soliton by the topological conservation law and the four - derivative coupling .",
    "we wish in fact to isolate a single skyrmion in order to see how its properties change with temperature , density , etc .",
    "a recurring problem in lattice studies of solitons is the tendency of lattice dislocations to destroy topological stability or , in other words , to allow topology to slip through the lattice .",
    "we avoid this problem by choosing a lattice action that enforces continuity at short distances . in order to keep our numerical evolution within a single topological sector ,",
    "we insist on a local updating scheme that should not nucleate smooth skyrmions .",
    "we find that these two ingredients suffice to stabilize the lattice skyrmion .",
    "the main technical development in this paper is the construction of an exact topological density that can be measured on a lattice field configuration . by `` exact '' we mean that the winding number , the sum of the density over the lattice , is always an integer .",
    "we cut the lattice into fundamental tetrahedra and map each tetrahedron into a curved tetrahedron in the @xmath0 target space .",
    "the winding number is then the sum of the signed volumes of the tetrahedra in @xmath0 .",
    "we calculate the volume of a spherical tetrahedron via a formula due to coxeter @xcite , derived as a solution of differential equations first written down by schlfli @xcite .",
    "we summarize the continuum skyrme model in sec .",
    "ii in order to establish notation .",
    "general considerations regarding continuity and topology on the lattice are presented in sec .",
    "iii , which concludes with formulae for the lattice action we employ . in sec .",
    "iv we present our definition of the local topological density via coxeter s formula for the volume of a quadrirectangular tetrahedron in @xmath0 . as a first application , we present in sec .  v the results of monte carlo simulation for the classical skyrme model in three dimensions . easier to simulate than the full four - dimensional path integral , this model may be regarded as a ginzburg - landau theory for the skyrme model at finite temperature  a sort of effective theory for the effective theory .",
    "we use the topological density to calculate the mean - square radius of a skyrmion as a function of the couplings @xmath1 and @xmath2 of the lattice action .",
    "if we fix @xmath3 , so that the form of the action is fixed , we find a multitude of metastable configurations of the skyrmion that are smaller than the ground state solution . as the `` temperature ''",
    "is raised by decreasing @xmath1 and @xmath2 , these metastable states are made accessible to fluctuations , with the result that the skyrmion shrinks as it is `` heated . ''",
    "presumably the `` temperature '' of the 3d theory is an increasing function of the real temperature in the 4d theory that it approximates .",
    "thus we reach the result that a quantized skyrmion shrinks as it is heated .",

    "finite - energy field configurations must tend to a constant at infinity , and one can use a symmetry rotation to make this constant the unit matrix , i.e. , @xmath12 using the pauli matrices @xmath13 , @xmath14 , we can write @xmath5 in terms of new fields @xmath15 via @xmath16 where @xmath17 . by considering small fluctuations about @xmath18 , we can identify @xmath19 , @xmath14 with the goldstone pion field .",

    "( [ usigma ] ) ] , configurations @xmath21 can be classified according to the homotopy group @xmath22 .",

    "in this section we define a topological density for a lattice field configuration that is unambiguous and that sums exactly to an integer .",
    "the further demand of conservation of the winding number will lead us to choosing a lattice action that constrains discontinuities in the field .",
    "a lattice configuration is specified by the field @xmath33 or , equivalently , by the 4-vector @xmath34 . in order to define the winding number , we begin @xcite by cutting the cubic lattice @xmath35 into tetrahedra , five tetrahedra per cubic cell ( see fig .  [ tetra5 ] ) .",
    "the four vertices @xmath36 , @xmath374 of each tetrahedron map to four unit 4-vectors @xmath38 , which are vertices of a spherical tetrahedron in @xmath0 .",
    "this tetrahedron is defined via its vertices ; its edges are arcs of great circles and its faces are spherical triangles drawn on great spheres .",
    "since three ( non - collinear ) points in @xmath0 determine a great sphere , it is clear that two adjacent tetrahedra in @xmath35 map into adjacent tetrahedra in @xmath0 , with the common face in @xmath35 mapping into a common face in @xmath0 .",
    "thus the field configuration @xmath39 gives a triangulation of some volume in @xmath0 .",
    "we impose periodic boundary conditions on the lattice , and thus no tetrahedron possesses a face that is not shared by another tetrahedron ( a _ free _ face ) .",
    "this implies that the complex of tetrahedra in @xmath0 possesses no free faces either , and thus the volume covered by the complex must be an integer multiple of the volume .",
    "we will redefine this to be unity , and thus measure volumes in units of @xmath40 .",
    "] of @xmath0 .",
    "if the field configuration is smooth , the complex in @xmath0 will be composed of tetrahedra that are small compared to @xmath0 , and it will wrap around the sphere much as a smooth mapping of the 3-torus must . in any case , the volume in @xmath0 of the five tetrahedra corresponding to a cube in @xmath35 gives a definition of the topological density @xmath41 contained in the cube .    the topological density thus defined is not unambiguous , however . if a tetrahedron in @xmath0 is specified by its faces , then there are two volumes in @xmath0 that are bounded by these faces .",
    "one of the volumes includes the north pole ( for example ) , and the other does not .",
    "if one of the volumes is measured to be a positive @xmath42 ( with @xmath43 ) , then the other volume will be @xmath44 .",
    "( careful attention to the orientation will make the latter negative . ) in order to assign a unique topological density to a lattice field configuration , we define a tetrahedron s volume to satisfy @xmath45 .    we have solved the problem of uniqueness , but not that of conservation of the winding number .",
    "consider a field configuration wherein one tetrahedron in @xmath0 has volume @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is small . under a fluctuation of one of the vertices of the tetrahedron",
    ", its volume may shift to @xmath48 , while the neighboring tetrahedra change their volumes by @xmath49 so that the winding number is unchanged . unfortunately , our algorithm will now redefine the volume of the first tetrahedron to @xmath50 , resulting in a loss of 1 in the winding number .",
    "this is often called `` topology dropping through the lattice . ''",
    "the procedure to be followed at this point depends on the physics to be investigated .",
    "one might want to study , for example , the thermodynamics of the skyrme model by fixing a chemical potential @xmath51 coupled to the winding number .",
    "the grand partition function would then be @xmath52 where @xmath53 is a sum over all field configurations with winding number @xmath23 .",
    "a monte carlo simulation should then be allowed to wander freely among the sectors of different @xmath23 , subject to an acceptance / rejection test that enforces the relative probabilities @xmath54 .",
    "a local updating algorithm can nucleate `` point skyrmions '' as in the preceding paragraph , which change @xmath23 by a unit and then spread out into smoother skyrmions ; in addition , a non - local update could be permitted that creates smooth skyrmions directly .",
    "our interest , however , is in the properties of a single skyrmion , which are accessible through a canonical ensemble at fixed @xmath26 . the simulation must be constrained so as not to change @xmath23",
    "this requires that we prevent the nucleation of both point skyrmions and smooth skyrmions .",
    "the latter can be prevented by choosing a local updating algorithm .",
    "for the former , we choose a lattice action that excludes the possibility of tetrahedra in @xmath0 with @xmath55 .",
    "we adopt the kinetic term @xcite @xmath56 in order to constrain @xmath57 and thus to reject fluctuations that put large angles between neighboring field variables . with some monte carlo exploration",
    ", we can find a value of @xmath58 that will keep the tetrahedral volumes far enough from @xmath59 .    for smooth configurations , we expand @xmath60 around 1 and eq .",

    "( [ continuum_action ] ) in the continuum limit .",
    "a technical point remains .",
    "we have discussed the ambiguity in fixing the volume of a tetrahedron if its faces are given , which led us to require @xmath45 .",
    "a lattice field configuration @xmath39 gives us only the vertices of each tetrahedron , however , not its faces .",
    "given three vertices that determine a great sphere , the face that connects them can be chosen to be either of two triangles that together make up the sphere . a little thought shows that the difference between the volumes enclosed is @xmath59.this gives an ambiguity between a value @xmath62 and @xmath63 for the volume of the tetrahedron .",
    "this last ambiguity involves choosing which triangle constitutes the face of the tetrahedron . but",
    "this face is shared between two adjacent tetrahedra , and the ambiguity will be immaterial if the same choice is made for both .",
    "this is hard to program , however , if each tetrahedron is to be handled on its own .",
    "we prefer to resolve the ambiguity for each tetrahedron separately , by requiring that @xmath64 .",
    "we impose this via a more restrictive choice of @xmath58 in eq .",
    "( [ s1 ] ) .",
    "we find that setting @xmath65 is adequate for the purpose .",
    "a local updating algorithm based on the action ( [ s1 ] ) will conserve winding number .",
    "even so , a skyrmion will tend to shrink down to a point in accordance with the scaling argument that gives derrick s theorem .",
    "this is because the stabilization is being done at the scale of a single lattice spacing ; only here will the scaling argument fail and the skyrmion run into a repulsive potential . in order to have a stable skyrmion of appreciable size",

    "the area of a triangle is given simply by girard s theorem , @xmath72 , where the right hand side is the sum of the triangle s angles minus @xmath73 , known as the angular excess .",

    "this argument may be generalized @xcite to a simplex in @xmath74 , but it only gives a formula for the volume when @xmath23 is even ; for odd @xmath23 , one obtains instead a constraint on the angles of the simplex .",

    "( [ schlafli ] ) , we can calculate the volume of any tetrahedron in @xmath0 by cutting it up into six qrt s ( see fig .",

    "the minima of the action ( [ action ] ) in 3 dimensions are the static , classical solutions of the 4-dimensional skyrme model .",
    "when we include fluctuations about these minima , we can think of the 3d action that governs them as of an approximation to an effective action derived via dimensional reduction .",

    "the metastable solutions , for that matter , might be artifacts of the specific lattice action we study that are absent in the true effective 3d theory .",
