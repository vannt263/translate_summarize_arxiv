    "since the discovery of superconductivity in cuprates by bednorz and mller@xcite a tremendous amount of work has been devoted to their characterization .",
    "the issue of inhomogeneities and their characterization is essential for several reasons , including : first , if inhomogeneity is an intrinsic property , a re - interpretation of experiments , measuring an average of the electronic properties , is unavoidable .",
    "second , inhomogeneity may point to a microscopic phase separation , i.e. superconducting grains , embedded in a non - superconducting matrix .",
    "third , there is neutron spectroscopic evidence for nanoscale cluster formation and percolative superconductivity in various cuprates@xcite .",
    "fourth , nanoscale spatial variations in the electronic characteristics have been observed in underdoped bi@xmath0sr@xmath0cacu@xmath0o@xmath1 with scanning tunnelling microscopy ( stm)@xcite .",
    "they reveal a spatial segregation of the electronic structure into 3 nm diameter superconducting domains in an electronically distinct background . on the contrary ,",
    "a large degree of homogeneity has been observed by renner and fischer@xcite .",
    "as stm is a surface probe the relevance of these observations for bulk and thermodynamic properties remains to be clarified .",
    "fifth , in yba@xmath0cu@xmath2o@xmath3 , mgb@xmath0 , 2h - nbse@xmath0 and nb@xmath4zr@xmath5 considerably larger grains have been established .",
    "the magnetic field induced finite size effect revealed lower bounds ranging from @xmath6 to @xmath7@xcite .",
    "sixth , since the change of the lattice parameters upon oxygen isotope exchange is negligibly small , the occurrence of a significant change in the inhomogeneities spatial extent , will provide clear evidence for the relevance of local lattice distortions in mediating superconductivity@xcite .",
    "here we review the attempts to probe the granularity of type ii superconductors by means of thermal fluctuations and magnetic fields@xcite .",
    "it is well - known that systems of finite extent , i.e. isolated superconducting grains , undergo a rounded and smooth phase transition@xcite . as in an infinite and homogeneous system the transition temperature @xmath8",
    "is approached the correlation length @xmath9 increases strongly and diverges at @xmath8 . however ,",
    "when superconductivity is restricted to grains with length scale @xmath10 in direction @xmath11 , @xmath12 can not grow beyond @xmath10 . in type ii superconductors , exposed to a magnetic field @xmath13",
    ", there is an additional limiting length scale @xmath14 with @xmath15 , related to the average distance between vortex lines @xcite . indeed , as the magnetic field increases , the density of vortex lines becomes greater , but this can not continue indefinitely , the limit is roughly set on the proximity of vortex lines by the overlapping of their cores . due to these limiting length scales the phase transition is rounded and occurs smoothly . indeed , approaching @xmath8 from below the transverse correlation length @xmath16 in direction @xmath11 and its real space counterpart @xmath17 , where @xmath18 , increase strongly .",
    "however , due to the limiting length scales @xmath10 and @xmath19 , it is bounded and can not grow beyond @xmath20 where @xmath21 and @xmath22 denotes the critical exponent of the correlation lengths . beyond the mean - field approximation it differs from @xmath23 and @xmath15 is a universal constant@xcite . in this context",
    "it is important to recognize that the confinement effect of the magnetic field in direction @xmath11 on fluctuations within a region @xmath24 acts only in the plane perpendicular to the field . as a remnant of the singularity at @xmath8",
    "the thermodynamic quantities exhibit a so called finite size effect , i.e. a maximum or an inflection point at @xmath25 .",
    "two limiting regimes , characterized by @xmath26 can be distinguished . for @xmath27",
    "the magnetic field induced finite size effect limits @xmath28 to grow beyond @xmath24 , while for @xmath29 the superconducting grains set the limiting length scales .",
    "since @xmath24 can be tuned by the strength of the applied magnetic field , both limits are experimentally accessible .",
    "@xmath27 is satisfied for sufficiently high and @xmath29 for low magnetic fields .",
    "thus , the occurrence of a magnetic field induced finite size effect requires that the magnetic field and the length scales of the superconducting grains satisfy the lower bound @xmath30 .",
    "since superconductors fall in the experimentally accessible critical regime into the 3d - xy universality class@xcite , with known critical exponents and critical amplitude combinations , we take these properties for granted@xcite .",
    "they include the exponents @xmath31 and the critical amplitude combinations @xmath32 where @xmath33 @xmath34 and @xmath35 are the critical amplitude of the specific heat singularity , @xmath36 , while @xmath37 and @xmath38 are the critical amplitude of the correlation length and penetration depth in direction @xmath11 . in the homogeneous system",
    "these length scales diverge as @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 is the correlation volume .",
    "in fig.[fig1]a we displayed the data of roulin _",
    "et al._@xcite for the temperature dependence of the heat coefficient of a yba@xmath0cu@xmath2o@xmath42 single crystal with @xmath43k at various magnetic fields applied parallel to the c - axis ( @xmath44 ) . as a remnant of the zero field singularity ,",
    "there is for fixed field strength a broad peak adopting its maximum at @xmath45 which is located below @xmath8 . as @xmath45 approaches @xmath8 , the peak becomes sharper with decreasing @xmath46 and evolves smoothly to the zero - field singularity , smeared by the inhomogeneity induced finite size effect .",
    "since @xmath45 decreases systematically with increasing field , condition ( [ eq2 ] ) applies in the form @xmath47and there is a magnetic field induced finite size effect . as the data of roulin _",
    "et al._@xcite are rather dense and extend close to zero field criticality , a detailed finite size scaling analysis appears to be feasible . in fig.[fig1]b",
    "we plotted the data in terms of @xmath48 versus @xmath49 .",
    "apparently the data falls on a single curve , which is the finite size scaling function @xmath50 defined in terms of @xmath51 a finite size effect requires that @xmath52 at @xmath45 , where @xmath53 , while @xmath54 holds for @xmath55 and @xmath56 . to qualify the remarkable collapse of the data we note that the estimates for @xmath57 and @xmath58 have been derived from the zero field data displayed in fig.[fig1]a .",
    "the solid line for @xmath59 is @xmath60with @xmath61(j / k@xmath62gat)@xmath63(j / k@xmath64gat ) , @xmath65(j / k@xmath64gat ) , @xmath43k and the critical exponent @xmath34 @xmath66 , to indicate the inhomogeneity induced deviations from the leading zero field critical behavior of  perfect yba@xmath0cu@xmath2o@xmath42 .",
    "since the data collapse onto the finite scaling function has been achieved without any arbitrary fitting parameter , the existence of the magnetic field induced finite size effect is well confirmed .",
    "furthermore , fig.[fig1]a shows how the broad anomaly in the specific heat coefficient sharpens , while the maximum height at @xmath67 increases with reduced field strength , evolving smoothly to the zero field peak , rounded by inhomogeneities . from the finite size scaling plot displayed in fig.[fig1]b we also deduce that with @xmath68a , that at @xmath69 , where @xmath70 , the scaling function is close to @xmath71 , as required .",

    "since at the lowest attained fields @xmath106 t and @xmath107 t a shift from @xmath8 to @xmath45 is still present ( see fig.[fig1]a ) , we derive from eq.([eq2 ] ) for the length scales of the sample inhomogeneities the lower bounds @xmath108 as in zero field the correlation volume @xmath109 can not grow beyond the volume @xmath110 of the inhomogeneities , this limiting volume scale is obtained from @xmath111 and @xmath112 evaluated in zero field . with @xmath113@xmath105 and @xmath114",
    "taken from fig.[fig1]a , we obtain the estimates @xmath115@xmath105 and @xmath116  which is consistent with the aforementioned lower bounds .",
    "next we turn to nb@xmath4zr@xmath5@xcite , 2h - nbse@xmath0@xcite and mgb@xmath0@xcite , type ii superconductors supposed to have comparative large correlation volumes . in fig.[fig3 ] we displayed @xmath117 versus @xmath46 derived from the respective experimental data . in contrast to the corresponding plot for nearly optimally yba@xmath0cu@xmath2o@xmath3 ( fig.[fig2 ] ) , the data points to a linear relationship .",
    "consequently , the critical regime , where @xmath117 @xmath118 @xmath119with @xmath120 holds ( eq.([eq7 ] ) ) , is not attained .",
    "nevertheless , there is clear evidence for a magnetic field induced finite size effect , because @xmath45 shifts monotonically to a lower value with increasing magnetic field . since the data points to an effective critical exponent @xmath121 which applies over an unexpectedly extended range , we use eq.([eq7 ] ) with @xmath23 to derive estimates for the amplitude of the respective transverse correlation lengths and the correlation volume in terms of @xmath122 with @xmath90 .     versus @xmath46 for nb@xmath4zr@xmath5@xcite , 2h - nbse@xmath0@xcite and mgb@xmath0@xcite derived from the respective references .",
    "the straight lines are eq.([eq10 ] ) with the parameters listed in table i. ]    the respective straight lines in fig.[fig3 ] are this relation with the parameters listed in table i. for comparison we included the corresponding parameters for yba@xmath0cu@xmath2o@xmath42@xcite , yba@xmath0cu@xmath2o@xmath123 , ( k , ba)bio@xmath2@xcite and hgba@xmath0ca@xmath0cu@xmath2o@xmath3@xcitewhere the critical regime is attained .",
    "it is evident that nb@xmath4zr@xmath5 , 2h - nbse@xmath0 and mgb@xmath0 are type ii superconductors with comparatively large correlation lengths .",
    "compared to yba@xmath0cu@xmath2o@xmath42 and yba@xmath0cu@xmath2o@xmath123 the correlation volume is 3 orders of magnitude larger , which renders the amplitude of the specific heat singularity very weak ( see eq.([eq4 ] ) .",
    "nevertheless , the unambiguous evidence for the magnetic field induced finite size effect reveals that fluctuations , even though not critical , are at work .",
    "for this reason there is no critical line @xmath124 of continuous phase transitions , but a line @xmath125 where the specific heat peak , broadening and decreasing with increasing field , adopts its maximum value and the correlation length attains the limiting magnetic length scale @xmath24 . because the fluctuations are also subject to the finite size effect arising from inhomogeneities with length scale @xmath126 , the magnetic finite size effect is observable as long as @xmath127 .",
    "the resulting lower bounds for the length scale of inhomogeneities affecting the thermodynamic properties are also included in table i. noting that these bounds stem from studies where no attempt was made to explore the low field behavior , it is conceivable that the actual length scale of the inhomogeneities is much larger . to our best knowledge ,",
    "the only absolute reference stems from the finite size scaling analysis of the zero field specific heat data of nearly optimally doped yba@xmath0cu@xmath2o@xmath3 , where @xmath128 was found to range from @xmath129 to @xmath130@xcite .",

    "@xmath141 are @xmath142sr estimates@xcite    to appreciate the implications of these estimates , we note that for fixed pr concentration the lattice parameters remain essentially unaffected@xcite . accordingly , an electronic mechanism , without coupling to local lattice distortions , implies @xmath143 . on the contrary ,",
    "a significant change of @xmath144 upon oxygen exchange uncovers the coupling to local lattice distortions involving the oxygen lattice degrees of freedom . a glance to table",
    "i shows that the relative change of the domains along the c - axis upon oxygen isotope exchange is significant , ranging from @xmath145 to @xmath146% , while the relative change of the inflection point or the transition temperature is an order of magnitude smaller .",
    "for this reason the significant relative change of @xmath147 at fixed pr concentration is accompanied by essentially the same relative change of @xmath148 , which probes the superfluid .",
    "this uncovers unambiguously the existence and relevance of the coupling between the superfluid , lattice distortions involving the oxygen lattice degrees of freedom .",
    "potential candidates are the cu - o bond - stretching - type phonons showing temperature dependence , which parallels that of the superconductive order parameter@xcite .",
    "independent evidence for the shrinkage of limiting length scales upon isotope exchange stems from the behavior close to the quantum superconductor to insulator transition where @xmath8 vanishes@xcite . here",
    "the cuprates become essentially two dimensional and correspond to a stack of independent slabs of thickness @xmath149@xcite .",
    "it was found that the relative shift @xmath150 upon isotope exchange adopts a rather unique value , namely @xmath151@xcite .",
    "although the majority opinion on the mechanism of superconductivity in the cuprates is that it occurs via a purely electronic mechanism involving spin excitations , and lattice degrees of freedom are supposed to be irrelevant , the relative isotope shift @xmath152 uncovers clearly the existence and relevance of the coupling between the superfluid , lattice distortions and anharmonic phonons which involve the oxygen lattice degrees of freedom .",
    "in contrast to yba@xmath0cu@xmath2o@xmath3 , ( k , ba)bio@xmath2 , mgb@xmath0 , 2h - nbse@xmath0 and nb@xmath4zr@xmath5 , where the lower bounds for the length scale @xmath128 of the superconducting grains ranges from @xmath153 a to @xmath7  , we have seen that the data for bi@xmath0sr@xmath0cacu@xmath0o@xmath1 single crystals and y@xmath154pr@xmath155ba@xmath0cu@xmath2o@xmath3 uncovers the existence of nanoscale inhomogeneities , which are not merely an artefact of the surface , but a bulk property with spatial extent , giving rise to finite size effects and with that to a rounded thermodynamic phase transition which occurs smoothly .",
    "while there are many questions to be answered about the intrinsic or extrinsic origin of the inhomogeneities , the existence and the nature of a macroscopic superconducting state , we established that a finite size scaling analysis yields the spatial extent of the inhomogeneities .",
    "furthermore , we established that the change of the spatial extent of the inhomogeneities upon oxygen isotope exchange uncovers the relevance of lattice degrees of freedom in mediating superconductivity .",
