    "the mixed formulation allows us to calculate simultaneously the primary solution of a pde and its flux . for this reason , mixed formulations are very useful for numerical solution of multiphysics systems .",
    "the focus of this work is on a single diffusive process that is a part of almost any complex multiphysics system .    in this paper",
    ", we present design principles used in the derivation of mimetic finite difference ( mfd ) schemes on polygonal and polyhedral meshes and establish bridges to design principles used by a few other discretization frameworks ( finite volumes and finite elements ) .",
    "the focus on the design principle allows us to avoid technical details and provide a more clear connection between different frameworks in comparison with the work performed in @xcite .",
    "we also illustrate the flexibility of the mimetic framework with two challenging examples : derivation of arbitrary - order accurate schemes for linear problems and convergent schemes for nonlinear problems with degenerate diffusion coefficients .",
    "many ideas underpinning the mfd method were originally formulated in the sixties for orthogonal meshes using the finite difference framework from which the name of the method was derived . over the years",
    ", the mfd method has been extensively developed for the solution of a wide range of scientific and engineering problems in continuum mechanics @xcite , electromagnetics @xcite , fluid flows  @xcite , elasticity  @xcite , obstacle and control problems  @xcite , diffusion @xcite , discretization of differential forms  @xcite , and eigenvalue analysis  @xcite .",
    "an extensive list of people who contributed to the development of the mfd method can be found in the recent book @xcite and review paper @xcite .",
    "the paper summarizes almost all known results on cartesian and curvilinear meshes for various pdes including the lagrangian hydrodynamics .",
    "the book complements the paper by providing numerous examples and describing basic tools used in the convergence analysis of mimetic schemes for elliptic pdes .    the mfd method preserves or mimic essential mathematical and physical properties of underlying partial differential equations ( pdes ) on general polygonal and polyhedral meshes .",
    "for the elliptic equation , these properties include the _ local flux balance _ and the _ duality between gradient and divergence operators_. the latter implies symmetry and positive definiteness of the resulting matrix operator and is desirable for robustness and reliability of numerical simulations .",
    "the duality of the primary and derived mimetic operators is one of the major design principles .",
    "the _ definition of the primary mimetic operators is coordinate invariant _",
    ", which is another design principle that allows us to build discrete schemes for non - cartesian coordinate systems .",
    "the discrete operators are also built to satisfy _ exact identities _",
    ", the property that is critical for avoiding spurious numerical solutions , providing accurate modeling of conservation laws , and making the convergence analysis possible .",
    "the related discretization frameworks considered in this paper include the finite volume methods @xcite , the mixed finite element ( mfe ) method @xcite , and the virtual element method ( vem ) @xcite .",
    "other finite volume frameworks exist that are based on mimetic principles such as the discrete duality finite volume methods ( ddfv ) , see , e.g. ,  @xcite , but these methods do not fit in the mfd framework and will not be considered here .",
    "the fv methods , originally introduced in  @xcite for the heat equation and dubbed as the integrated finite difference method , form , perhaps , the largest class of schemes that can handle unstructured polygonal and polyhedral meshes , non - linear problems , and problems with anisotropic coefficients . an introduction to the finite volume nethoddology can be found in the recent review @xcite .",
    "almost all fv methods starts with a discrete representation of the flux balance equation .",
    "this representation is exact and this property is so important that all the methods that we consider in this paper use the same discrete form of the balance equation and the difference between them is only in the discretization of the constitutive equation .",
    "the classical cell - centered fv scheme uses a two - point flux formula that is second - order accurate for special meshes such as the voronoi tessellations . to overcome this limitation ,",
    "a class of fv methods , consistent by design , is proposed by introducing additional unknowns on mesh faces .",
    "examples of such methods are the _ hybrid finite volume _ method @xcite , and the _ mixed finite volume _ method @xcite .",
    "these fv methods start with different definitions of the cell - based discrete gradient that are exact for linear solutions .",
    "the formula for the numerical flux based on this gradient needs a stabilization term .",
    "construction of the stabilized flux uses two principles .",
    "first , the stabilization term should be zero on linear solutions .",
    "second , the stabilized flux is defined as the solution of a certain equation with a symmetric and positive definite bilinear form",
    ". we will show that these design principles imply the duality principle in the mimetic framework .",
    "the vem was originally introduced as an evolution of the mfd method . in the classical finite element spirit",
    ", the duality principle is incorporated directly in the weak formulation .",
    "the exact identities are replaced by the exact sequence of virtual finite element spaces .",
    "a new design principle is the unisolvency property where the space of degrees of freedom is isomorphic to a space of finite element functions and includes polynomial as well as non - polynomial functions .",
    "the bilinear forms are split explicitly into consistency and stability forms using problem - dependent @xmath0 and @xmath1 projectors .",
    "we discuss how the new design principles are connected to the stability and consistency conditions in the mimetic framework .",
    "the recent developments of the mfd framework exploit it flexibility for selecting non - standard degrees of freedom , optimization of inner products , and non - standard approximations of primary operators to build schemes with higher order of accuracy and convergence schemes for nonlinear pdes with degenerate coefficients ( see also section  [ sec : divk ] ) .",
    "extension to higher - order mixed scheme is almost straightforward in the mimetic framework .",
    "the key step is the proper selection of degrees of freedom that ( a ) simplify the discretization of the primary divergence operator and ( b ) allows us to formulate a computable consistency condition .",
    "a new design principle is introduced in this case , which states that a commuting relation exists between the interpolation operators defining the degrees of freedom of scalar and vector fields , and the divergence operators in the discrete and continuum settings .",
    "all of the aforementioned methods discretize effectively the divergence operator `` _ _ div__@xmath2 '' . to solve nonlinear parabolic equations , we employ new mfd schemes where the primary operator discretizes the combined operator `` _ _ div__@xmath3 '' , where @xmath4 is the non - constant scalar diffusion coefficient .",
    "the resulting scheme uses both cell - centered and face - centered values of the diffusion coefficient .",
    "this model has applications in heat diffusion @xcite and moisture transport in porous media @xcite . the duality property mentioned above guarantees that the schemes can be formulated as algebraic problems with symmetric and positive definite matrices .",
    "matrices with these properties lead to better performance of scalable iterative solvers , such as algebraic multigrid solvers and krylov solvers such as the preconditioned conjugate gradient .",
    "finally , we mention other discretization methods that work on general meshes . our necessarily incomplete list include the polygonal / polyhedral finite element method ( pfem )  @xcite , hybrid high - order method  @xcite , the discontinuous galerkin ( dg ) method  @xcite , hybridized discontinuous galerkin ( hdg ) method  @xcite , and the weak galerkin ( wg ) method @xcite .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows . in section  [ sec :",
    "basic : principles : mfd : framework ] , we review the basic discretization principles of the mimetic framework . in section  [ sec : mixed : mimetic : formulation ] , we derive the mimetic finite difference method for elliptic problems through the consistency and stability properties .",
    "we also prove that any mixed - hydrid method that uses the same degrees of freedom leads to a member of the mimetic family of schemes . in section",
    "[ sec : recent : developments ] , we review the recent progress in the development of mimetic methods for mixed formulations of elliptic problems . our final remarks and conclusions are given in section  [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "the mfd method mimics important mathematical and physical properties of underlying pdes .",
    "we give two examples showing the importance of preserving such properties in physics simulations .",
    "consider a polygonal or polyhedral mesh @xmath5 .",
    "we denote the sets of mesh nodes , edges , faces , and cells by symbols @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 , respectively , the set of vectors collecting the degrees of freedom associated with those mesh objects by the corresponding symbol with the subscript `` @xmath10 '' , and the restriction to cell `` @xmath11 '' by the subscript `` @xmath12 '' .",
    "each set of vectors of degrees of freedom with the ( obvious ) definitions of addition and multiplication by a scalar number is a linear space .",
    "for example , @xmath13 is the linear space of vectors formed by the degrees of freedom located on the mesh faces , and @xmath14 is its restriction to cell @xmath11 .",
    "its precise definition depends on the scheme .",
    "an illustration of particular discrete spaces restricted to a single cell is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : dofs ] .     from left to right are @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath14 , @xmath17 .",
    "the degrees of freedom are shown only on the visible objects . ]",
    "the mimetic finite difference method operates with discrete analogs of the first - order operators .",
    "these operators are designed to satisfy exact identities and duality principles .      in the mimetic framework",
    ", we usually discretize pairs of adjoint operators , such as the primary divergence @xmath18 and the derived gradient @xmath19 .",
    "hereafter , we will distinguish the derived operators from the primary operators by using a tilde on the operator s symbol .",
    "it is convenient to think about these operators as matrices acting between finite dimensional linear spaces . to discretize a large class of pdes ,",
    "we need three pairs of primary and derived operators , which are discrete analogs of gradient , curl and divergence operators .",
    "each pair of operators satisfies a discrete integration by parts formula , e.g. @xmath20_{\\cc_h } = -\\big[\\bu_h,\\ , \\gradt\\ , q_h\\big]_{\\cf_h }    \\qquad \\forall \\bu_h\\in \\cf_h,\\   \\forall q_h \\in \\cc_h.\\ ] ] this formula represents one of the mimetic discretization principles as it mimics the continuum green formula @xmath21 the brackets @xmath22_{\\cc_h}$ ] and @xmath22_{\\cf_h}$ ] in   stand for an approximation of the integrals in   and will be referred to as the _ mimetic inner products _ ( or , simply _ inner products _ ) .",
    "the inner products are typically constructed from local ( e.g. cell - based or node - based ) inner products , which simplifies their derivation .",
    "for example , the two inner products in   can be reformulated as @xmath23_{\\cf_h }    = \\sum\\limits_{c \\in \\omega_h } \\big[\\bu_c,\\ , \\bv_c\\big]_{\\cf_h , c } ,    \\qquad    \\big[p_h,\\ , q_h\\big]_{\\cc_h }    = \\sum\\limits_{c \\in \\omega_h } \\big[p_c,\\ , q_c\\big]_{\\cc_h , c}\\ ] ] where @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 denote the restriction to mesh cell @xmath11 of the corresponding global vectors in the left - hand side and @xmath28_{\\cf_h , c}$ ] and @xmath28_{\\cc_h , c}$ ] are the local contribution from @xmath11 to the global inner products @xmath28_{\\cf_h}$ ] and @xmath28_{\\cc_h}$ ] , respectively .",
    "let @xmath29 and @xmath30 be the symmetric positive definite matrices induced by the inner products @xmath22_{\\cc_h}$ ] and @xmath22_{\\cf_h}$ ] , respectively .",
    "then , the explicit formula for the derived gradient operator is @xmath31 this formula shows that this operator has a nonlocal stencil when matrix @xmath30 is irreducible as is typical for unstructured meshes .",
    "note that the same property holds true for many other discretization frameworks .",
    "formula implies that in general the discrete operators can not be discretized independently .",
    "if we discretize one of the operators , e.g. , the divergence , and select the inner products , the other operator , the gradient , must be derived from formula .",
    "the existing freedom is in the selection of the inner products .",
    "the selection of the discrete spaces is typically done to simplify the discretization of the primary mimetic operator . for a different pair of discrete spaces , e.g. , @xmath32 and @xmath33 , one can find that the gradient operator can be discretized in a natural way .",
    "in such a case , the gradient operator @xmath34 is the primary mimetic operator and the discrete divergence operator @xmath35 is the derived operator .",
    "this pair of operators satisfies another discrete integration by parts formula that mimics : @xmath36_{\\cn_h } = -\\big[\\bv_h,\\ , \\grad\\ , p_h\\big]_{\\ce_h }    \\qquad \\forall p_h\\in \\cn_h,\\   \\forall \\bv_h \\in \\ce_h.\\ ] ] the explicit formula for the derived divergence operator is @xmath37 where @xmath38 and @xmath39 are symmetric positive definite matrices induced by the inner products .",
    "note that in some low - order mimetic schemes , matrix @xmath39 is diagonal , so that the derived operator has a local stencil .",
    "the third pair of discrete operators approximates the continuum operators `` _ _ curl _ _ '' .",
    "let @xmath40 and @xmath41 satisfy the discrete integration by parts formula @xmath42_{\\cf_h } = \\big[\\bv_h,\\ , \\curlt\\ , \\bu_h\\big]_{\\ce_h } \\qquad \\forall \\bv_h\\in \\ce_h,\\   \\forall \\bu_h \\in \\cf_h,\\ ] ] which mimics the continuum formula @xmath43 the explicit formula for the derived curl operator is @xmath44 so that this derived operator has typically a non - local stencil .",
    "the spaces of discrete functions that we have introduced so far satisfy homogeneous boundary conditions . in @xcite ,",
    "these spaces were enriched conveniently to approximate the boundary integrals that appear in general green formulas .",
    "the resulting derived mimetic operators include an approximation of the boundary conditions .",
    "we will not follow this approach here , since the focus of this paper is on mixed - hybrid formulations , which provide another way to incorporate boundary conditions in a numerical scheme .",
    "the duality of the discrete operators helps us to build numerical schemes that satisfy discrete conservation laws .",
    "for example , consider the euler equations in the lagrangian form : @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the pressure , @xmath47 is the density , @xmath48 is the velocity , and @xmath49 is the internal energy . the system is closed by an equation of state .",
    "a mimetic discretization of   is given by @xmath50 where @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 and @xmath54 are the discrete analogs of the corresponding continuum quantities that appear in   and @xmath55 and @xmath56 are the mimetic operators acting , respectively , as divergence and gradient .",
    "let us assume that no external work is done on the system , e.g. , @xmath57 of @xmath58 .",
    "the integration by parts and the continuity equation from   lead to the conservation of the total energy @xmath59 : @xmath60 to mimic this property , we need the discrete gradient and divergence operators @xmath56 and @xmath55 to satisfy a discrete integration by parts formula like  . using the same argument that leads to  , we obtain the conservation of the total discrete energy @xmath61 : @xmath62_{\\cf_h } - \\big[p_h,\\,\\div \\bu_h\\big]_{\\cc_h } = 0.\\ ] ] we emphasize that numerical methods that conserve energy usually have other important properties such as correct prediction of a shock position and bounded numerical solution .",
    "another discretization principle is to derive primary operators that mimic exact identities .",
    "this is typically achieved by using the first principles ( the divergence and stokes theorems ) to define the primary operators , e.g. ( [ primary - div ] ) .",
    "as the result , we have @xmath63 another consequence of the duality principle is that similar identities hold for the derived mimetic operators . using the aforementioned explicit formulas for these operators",
    ", we immediately obtain that @xmath64    these exact identities allows us to design numerical schemes without non - physical spurious modes .",
    "for instance , in the numerical solution of maxwell s equations , such operators guarantee that the magnetic field @xmath65 remains divergence - free for all times .",
    "applying the primary divergence operator to a semi - discrete form of faraday s law of induction , i.e. , @xmath66 , we obtain @xmath67 therefore , if @xmath65 is such that @xmath68 at time @xmath69 , this relation will be satisfied at any time @xmath70 .      from this section ,",
    "we limit our discussion to elliptic problems and one pair of the primary and derived operators . for the practical implementation of mimetic schemes ,",
    "it is convenient to write a local integration by parts formula that implies the global one . to do it , we need an additional space @xmath71 of pressure unknowns defined typically on mesh faces .",
    "its restriction to cell @xmath11 is denoted by @xmath72 and consists of the vectors @xmath73 .",
    "we recall that the subscript `` @xmath11 '' is added to denote the local mimetic operators and the local discrete spaces corresponding to cell @xmath11 .",
    "let @xmath74 be the primary divergence operator . the derived gradient operator @xmath75 satisfies the discrete integration by parts formula @xmath76_{\\cc_h , c }     - [ \\bu_c,\\ , { { \\bm\\lambda}}_c]_{\\lambda_{h , c } }    = -\\big[\\bu_c,\\ , \\gradt_c\\ ,     \\left(\\!\\!\\begin{array}{c}q_c \\\\ { { \\bm\\lambda}}_c \\end{array}\\!\\!\\right)\\big]_{\\cf_h , c }    \\nonumber\\\\[0.5em ]    & \\hspace{7.5 cm }    \\forall \\bu_c\\in \\cf_{h , c},\\",

    "the derivation of the mimetic method follows three generic steps .",
    "first , we select the degrees of freedom such that the local primary operator , e.g. , @xmath79 , has a simple form .",
    "second , we define the inner products in the discrete spaces that satisfy the consistency and stability conditions .",
    "third , we postulate the discrete integration by parts formula and obtain the derived operator , e.g. , @xmath80 , from it .",
    "note that the local derived operator is defined uniquely .",
    "these three steps are discussed in section  [ sec : mixed : mimetic : formulation ] for the mixed formulation of the diffusion problem .",

    "more examples of mimetic schemes can be found in @xcite .",
    "the material properties are often included in the definition of the derived mimetic operator .",

    ", we consider one local mimetic formulation , two fv schemes and two mixed - hybrid fe schemes with the same set of degrees of freedom .",
    "moreover , we consider the schemes that use the same discrete divergence operator and the discrete flux balance equation : @xmath97 where @xmath98 is a linear operator and @xmath99 is defined later .      the analysis of discretization schemes is typically conducted on a sequence of conformal meshes @xmath5 where @xmath10 is the diameter of the largest cell in @xmath5 and @xmath100 .",
