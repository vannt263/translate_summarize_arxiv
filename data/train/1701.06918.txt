    "particle motion in bulk systems is described by fickian ( normal ) diffusion , where the mean square displacement ( msd ) of a labeled particle increases linearly with time in the long time limit , and is given by the einstein relation , @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the diffusion coefficient along an arbitrary direction @xmath2 , @xmath3 is the position of the particle at time , @xmath4 , and @xmath5 is the initial particle position .",
    "however , the fundamental nature of diffusion can change dramatically if the movement of the particles is restricted to a quasi - one dimensional narrow channel in which the particles can not pass each other  @xcite .",
    "the geometric restriction , when combined with the presence of independent stochastic forces  @xcite or a brownian background  @xcite acting on the particles , results in a form of anomalous diffusion known as single file diffusion ( sfd ) , because the relative order of the particles is preserved and a particle must wait for its neighbors to move before being able to diffuse .",
    "this effect reduces the translational mobility of the particles in a way that causes the msd to increase proportionally to the square root of time in the long time limit and is described by an einstein  like relation , @xmath6 where the diffusion coefficient has been replaced by a mobility factor , @xmath7  @xcite .",
    "single file diffusion occurs in a variety of natural and engineered systems , including ion and water transport through biological membranes  @xcite , diffusion in molecular sieves such as zeolites  @xcite , carbon nanotubes  @xcite or metal organic frameworks  @xcite , and charge - carrier diffusion in one dimensional channels  @xcite . at the molecular level",
    ", sfd has been observed experimentally in adsorbate molecules confined in zeolites using pulsed field gradient nuclear magnetic resonance @xcite .",
    "however , the phenomenon has also been observed in colloidal systems  @xcite , where it is being used in nano- and micro - fluidic devices  @xcite , as well as to control flow rates in the delivery of drugs  @xcite .",
    "fluids in quasi - one dimensional channels also exhibit an interesting dynamical crossover regime from sfd to normal diffusion as the channel radius increases beyond a passing threshold that allows the particles to hop past each other  @xcite . in this crossover regime ,",
    "the msd in the long time limit is described by eq .",
    "[ eq : normaldiffusion ] because the particles can pass each other .",
    "however , the particles are trapped between their neighbors for long periods of time , during which they perform sfd , because passing is difficult .",
    "the resulting msd at intermediate times is then described by eq .",
    "[ eq : sfd ] . in the case of mixtures",
    "formed from particles of different sizes , it is also possible to select a channel radius that induces dual  mode diffusion , where the large particle component performs sfd while the smaller components exhibit normal diffusion  @xcite .",
    "the difference in particle mobilities can potentially be used for separation  @xcite .",
    "mon and percus  @xcite used a simple phenomenological model to show that the long time diffusion coefficient of a system in the crossover regime can be written , @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the average time for a particle to escape the cage formed by its two nearest neighbors and the exponent @xmath10 depends on the nature of the hopping event . if the system is near the passing threshold for the particles , so that hopping events are rare and the particles are trapped long enough to perform sfd , then @xmath10 is predicted to be @xmath11 , and this has been confirmed by simulation for quasi - one dimensional hard discs  @xcite , hard spheres  @xcite and soft - potential systems such as lennard ",
    "jones  @xcite , as well as for mixtures  @xcite .",
    "the hopping time approach is useful because the important details that influence the long time dynamics of the particles , such as the particle  particle and particle  wall interactions , as well as the density or pressure , are captured in a single , short time , phenomenological parameter that is also accessible by simulation and theory .",
    "the process by which particles pass each other in a narrow quasi - one dimensional system can be treated in terms of a free energy barrier crossing process because the particle  particle and particle  wall interactions combine to increase the energy of interaction , and restrict the available configuration space for two particles , as they attempt to pass .",
    "this suggests that transition state theory ( tst ) could provide a useful description of the hopping time . in the case of hard sphere systems",
    ", @xmath9 diverges as the radius of the channel decreases towards the passing threshold from above because the infinite nature of the interaction potential eventually prevents the particles from ever passing and tst correctly predicts the exponent for the power law behavior  @xcite .",
    "transition state theory also provides a qualitative description of @xmath9 for soft potential systems , where the passing threshold is not as clearly defined  @xcite .",
    "however , these approaches are not quantitative .",
    "the goal of this paper is to develop a rigorous approach to the calculation of the hopping time , within the framework of transition state theory , that can provide the basis for the quantitative prediction of @xmath9 . to achieve this",
    ", we develop the theory and associated simulation method using the small system isobaric  isothermal ensemble to account for the fluctuating nature of the nearest neighbour cage that traps a particle in a single file fluid .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organized as follows : section  [ sec : bt ] provides a brief summary of the background and general derivation of the small system @xmath12 ensemble in order to highlight the key elements of the method .",
    "this is followed by the description of how the small system @xmath12 ensemble can be used to develop a transition state theory for hopping times in confined single file fluids .",

    "in the thermodynamic limit , fluctuations away from the most probable microstates are small and the thermodynamics of the system can be described by the properties of the states associated with the maximum term in the probability distribution .",
    "the maximum term for one ensemble can be shown to be degenerate with the partition function of another so that all the ensembles are equivalent and selecting a particular ensemble for the calculation of a system property becomes a matter of mathematical convenience . however , as the system size decreases , fluctuations become more important and in the nano - scale regime it is essential to consider the types of fluctuations available to the system in selecting an appropriate ensemble . in the case of the isobaric - isothermal , @xmath13 ensemble , where the volume fluctuates , it also becomes necessary to consider the details of how the ensemble itself is formulated  @xcite .",

    "one dimensional channels is attractive because all the effects that influence particle motion in the long time limit are contained within a single parameter , @xmath9 , that describes the short time event of a particle hopping past one of its neighbours .",
    "the activated nature of the hopping process also makes the calculation of @xmath9 amenable to the application of transition state theory , but the challenge is to provide a rigorous approach for the calculation of the probability of being in the transition state , i.e. the height of the hopping free energy barrier , for a nanoscale system that exhibits volume fluctuations . while the isobaric  isothermal ensemble is the appropriate choice of ensemble , a direct application of the bulk thermodynamic results to a system in the nanoscale is problematic due to the system size dependence of the necessary volume scale .",
    "we have shown that this problem can be overcome by using the small system isobaric  isothermal ensemble proposed by corti , where the use of a shell particle to define the volume prevents the over counting of configurations when considering volume fluctuations and eliminates the need for an explicit volume scale .",

    "one of the main advantages of our approach is that it only requires the simulation of two fluid particles and the wall interactions , while the direct measurement of the diffusion coefficient and @xmath9 involves the simulation of hundreds of particles and requires a long simulation time because @xmath9 is slow to converge .",
    "the small number of particles also means that the probability density along the reaction coordinate can be sampled by  brute force \" because simulations with a large number of mc cycles can be performed quickly , but the method can also be adapted to include more advanced techniques such as biased umbrella sampling  @xcite in cases where the barrier is large .    it is interesting to note that our tst approach breaks down for wider channels in the hard disc model , but works well over all channel radii in the ideal gas model even when the barrier is only a few @xmath190 . the main difference between the two models is the exclusion interaction of the hard discs and the effect this has on our decision to neglect the interactions between the small system and its surroundings .",
    "setting @xmath63 is exact for the ideal gas system . in the hard discs model ,",
    "this allows the two particles in small system to sample configurations in the transition state that would otherwise be ruled out by the exclusion interaction with particles in the surroundings sitting near the boundary . as a result , our method over estimates the partition function of the transition state which leads to a lower predicted barrier .",
    "neglecting these interactions becomes less important as the channel becomes narrower .",
    "this assumption also restructs the application of our method to low pressures , where again , interactions between the small system and the surroundings are minimal .    the hopping time is only connected to the diffusion coefficient through eq .",
    "[ eq : diff_tauhop ] , with @xmath191 , when the particles are caged long enough between hops that they perform single file diffusion during this time , which should occur when the barrier is high .",
    "this suggests that our method should be effective in predicting the hopping time and dynamic properties of single file fluids in the crossover regimes and there are a wide range of important practical challenges in nano - fluidic systems , including the separation of mixtures , that can be addressed in the regime where our method is valid and simple enough to provide useful insight .",
    "however , mon and percus  @xcite also showed that eq .",
    "[ eq : diff_tauhop ] may be applicable in the wide channel regime , but with a different hopping time exponent .",
    "when the channel is wide , the particles can pass each other easily because the barrier is low .",
    "the hopping time is then short so that the distance traveled between hops becomes independent of the hopping time , and proportional to the average distance between nearest neighbors in the channel , which leads to an exponent of @xmath192 .",
    "this has not been tested , but suggests the hopping time approach may still be applicable even when the channel is wide . to make our tst approach work in the wide channel regime",
    ", it would be essential to account for the interactions between the small system and the surroundings in our simulation method .",
    "in this work , we have shown that the small system isobaric  isothermal ensemble provides a rigorous framework for the development of a transition state theory for the calculation of the hopping time and we have applied it to two simple systems . while the simulation method is currently restricted to the narrow channel , low pressure regime , where interactions between the small system and its surroundings can be neglected , it is simple to implement and is potentially applicable to the study of a wide range of systems .",
