    "the problem of phase space transport has important applications such as in mixing and separation problems in fluid flows that vary in scale from the micro to the geophysical , interplanetary transport and instability of mechanical systems , to name a few . a variety of dynamical systems methods",
    "have been studied over the past three decades to explain transport mechanisms , to detect barriers to transport , and to quantify transport rates , see eg @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "these methods fall into two main categories , the geometric and the probabilistic . under the umbrella of geometric methods",
    "are the techniques of invariant manifolds ( of fixed points ) , lobe dynamics and finite time lyapunov exponents ( ftle ) and lagrangian coherent structures ( lcs ) .",
    "the method of ftle and lcs has proven to be particularly useful in studying transport in time dependent systems and has found a variety of applications , for e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the probabilistic approach studies the transport of densities and the so called almost invariant sets and coherent sets .",
    "these methods too have been successfully applied in the study of various geophysical flow problems , @xcite and mixing in micro channels @xcite .",
    "the method of lcs studies stretching and contraction around reference trajectories .",
    "the lcs method is therefore local in nature ; it provides information about invariant manifolds that determine transport in phase space .",
    "the current method of lcs relies on computing the ftle field using long time computations , since lcs usually can be identified only after a significant time of integration .",
    "the disadvantage of this is that , excessive stretching of line elements can introduce computational errors .",
    "moreover specific checks on whether the stretching of line elements is within the linearized regime can be difficult to incorporate in the current algorithms on computing the ftle .",
    "the probabilistic method on the other hand ignores the local transport structures , but using the transfer operator divides the phase space into maximally invariant sets .",
    "there have been a few attempts to explore the relationship between the geometric and probabilistic descriptions of phase space transport , such as @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the aim of this short paper is to present a technique of computing the ftle using the perron - frobenius operator that is a step towards combining the geometric and probabilistic methods , by making the perron - frobenius operator the common tool to both . by utilizing the perron - frobenius operator to compute the ftle",
    ", this method also strengthens the probabilistic interpretation of the ftle , identified in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "this approach has the added benefits of eliminating the issue of linearization around a reference trajectory in the existing formulation of the ftle and reduces the time to compute the ftle field for time - dependent and periodic flows .",
    "the formulation of ftle and the perron - frobenius operator is reviewed in this section .",
    "this review is intended to provide an intuitive background and set the context for the computation of the ftle using the perron - frobenius operator . for the rigorous definitions and details on these methods ,",
    "the reader is referred to @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "let @xmath0 be compact and @xmath1 be a smooth flow on @xmath2 .",
    "let the associated vector field be @xmath3 for @xmath4 .",
    "consider a reference trajectory passing through the point @xmath5 and a perturbed trajectory passing through the point @xmath6 at time @xmath7 .",
    "the flow @xmath8 maps these points to @xmath9 and @xmath10 at time @xmath11 and the perturbation grows to @xmath12 .",
    "expanding @xmath10 in a taylor series about the point @xmath5 we get @xmath13 the norm or magnitude of @xmath14 can be found using the standard inner product on @xmath15 .",
    "@xmath16 where @xmath17 denotes the transpose and the gradient @xmath18 is evaluated at @xmath5 . the maximum growth of a perturbation is therefore given by the maximum principal stretch , i.e. , by the maximum eigenvalue of @xmath19 .",
    "@xmath20 where @xmath21 is the cauchy - green tensor .",
    "the growth in the perturbation depends on the initial point @xmath22 , initial time @xmath7 and the evolution or integration time @xmath23 .",
    "[ defn : ftle_defn1 ] the maximum ftle is defined as , @xcite , @xcite , @xmath24    the leading ftle gives the time averaged rate of linearized stretching in a neighborhood around a reference trajectory .",
    "it is intuitively clear that regions of the phase space with locally high values of ftle will stretch and separate .",
    "the sets with high ftle act as repelling barriers in the flow .",
    "this intuitive idea of barriers is formalized by the concept of lagrangian coherent structures ( lcs ) , defined as ridges in scalar ftle field , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "ridges can be defined precisely by appealing to differential geometric quantities as in @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "let @xmath25 denote the lebesgue measure and let @xmath26 be a measurable set and @xmath27 be a probability density function , @xmath28 being the space of lebesgue measurable functions .",
    "the unique operator @xmath29 defined by @xmath30 is called the perron - frobenius operator for the flow @xmath31 , @xcite .",
    "equation [ eq : perron - frobenius_op ] which holds for all @xmath25 measurable sets follows from the radon - nykodym theorem .    in practice",
    "it is usually necessary to numerically approximate the operator @xmath32 .",
    "this is done by discretizing the domain , @xmath2 , into a finite number of sets , say @xmath33 which is essentially a grid of boxes .",
    "a projection @xmath34 defined by @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is the characteristic function of the set @xmath37 and @xmath38 gives a finite dimensional approximation of @xmath39 . since @xmath39 is a probability density function @xmath40 .",
    "similarly @xmath41 is projected on @xmath42 .",
    "the operator @xmath43 is a linear operator between finite dimensional vector spaces .",
    "further taking the box measures @xmath44 for all @xmath45 $ ] , @xmath46 becomes a stochastic transition matrix .",
    "the entries of the matrix @xmath47 are determined by a monte - carlo simulation @xcite and @xcite .",
    "each box in the domain contains a fixed number of points ( initial conditions ) , which are integrated from a time @xmath7 to @xmath11 .",
    "the final position of the points gives the matrix @xmath47 as - @xmath48 a time reversible operator @xmath47 is required to apply the above definition for flows in forward time , @xcite .",
    "this is achieved by creating a reversible markov operator @xmath49 given by @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the time reversed analogue of @xmath47 .",
    "its elements are given by @xmath52 where @xmath53 and @xmath54 are components of the first left eigenvector , @xmath55 , of @xmath56 .",
    "for a volume preserving flow in which the domain is uniformly discretized , @xmath57 , the transpose of @xmath46 .",
    "henceforth for convenience the time reversible operator @xmath58 is referred to simply as @xmath47 unless there is an ambiguity about the initial and final times @xmath7 and @xmath11 .",
    "the markov operator @xmath47 has the semigroup property of @xmath59 , where @xmath60 .",
    "this property is used to simplify the computations of the ftle .",
    "the concepts of ftle and lcs reviewed previously have been used fruitfully in many areas as has been pointed out earlier .",
    "however the standard computational implementation of ftle , using finite differences , suffers from some drawbacks , stemming from the integration time @xmath61 and the linearization around reference trajectories . in equation [ eq : taylor_perturb ]",
    ", it is assumed that the second ( and higher ) order terms are negligible .",
    "however the magnitude of the higher order terms depends on the evolution time @xmath62 .",
    "if the evolution time @xmath61 is too high then the higher order terms may be comparable to the first order terms in equation [ eq : taylor_perturb ] .",
    "if the evolution time @xmath61 is too low , then one can not detect any interesting structure in the ftle field . often , the evolution time @xmath61 is selected in a subjective fashion without checking the validity of equation [ eq : taylor_perturb ] .",
    "the problem with this is illustrated with the example of the double gyre flow , a prototype in the lcs literature , @xcite .",
    "the double gyre flow is defined by the stream function @xmath63 , with @xmath64 , where we use the parameters @xmath65 , @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",
    "the time period of the flow is @xmath68 .",
    "now consider the equation [ eq : taylor_perturb ] with the second order terms explicitly written , @xmath69 in this equation it can be shown that the second and first order terms are comparable in magnitude .",
    "the max - norm for matrices is used for this comparison .",
    "figure [ fig : fig_first_second_order ] shows the plot of @xmath70 and @xmath71 .",
    "the magnitude of the second order terms is more than half that of the first order terms in equation [ eq : taylor_perturb2 ] .",
    "this is true for a smaller evolution time as well .",
    "the ridges in ftle field for the double gyre flow are generated by moving instantaneous stagnations points ( isps ) .",
    "material line elements close to the isps stretch in a shorter time as compared to material line elements farther away . therefore ineresting structures such as",
    "ridges in the ftle field require a long period of integration during which the nonlinear deformation of line elements close to the isps occurs .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     [ !",
    "h ]    as observed in the discussion on the lid driven cavity flow , the ftle field has the same ridge features , when the covariance of the sets @xmath72 are computed directly by integrating all the points in each box to @xmath73 , as shown in figure [ fig : ftle_direct_doublegyre ] and when computed using the perron - frobenius operator .",
    "moreover because of the more accurate approximation of the domain by a higher number of boxes , the covariance ftle field computed by a direct integration and that computed by the perron - frobenius operator are closer to each other in magnitude .",
    "a method to compute the ftle field using the perron frobenius operator has been introduced in this paper . to do this a modified definition of the ftle",
    "was used which identifies deformation of sets of positive measure instead of the stretching of line elements .",
    "this methodology is general enough to be used in time - dependent flows and is particularly useful in the case of time - independent and periodic flows , where it offers a significant computational advantage by eliminating long time integrations .",
    "the method of computing the covariance ftle from perron - frobenius operator using equation was illustrated by two examples ; the lid driven cavity flow and the double gyre flow . in both cases",
    "it was shown that the ftle field computed by the new method has the same topological features as the ftle field computed using the standard approach of line stretching and the direct computation of the covariance ftle from the dispersion of points as in equation .",
    "the computational time required for the calculation of the covariance ftle directly from the dispersion of points scales linearly with time in the most ideal case .",
    "so the time taken to calculate @xmath74 , for an integration time @xmath75 , is @xmath76 times that of the time taken for calculating @xmath77 . using the pf operator approach the time necessary to calculate the ftle is almost independent of the multiple @xmath76 .",
    "thus the method proposed in this paper is @xmath76 times computationally efficient .",
    "comparing the method proposed in the paper , with that of the standard ftle , the computation of the standard ftle is faster .",
    "this is because the standard ftle computations were done a very coarse grid in both the examples presented . even though the time of integration is shortes ,",
    "fewer initial conditions have to be integrated and thus the method is faster .",
    "however as has been pointed in the paper in section 3.1 this is achieved at the cost of erroneously ignoring the higher order terms in equation .",
    "the covariance based method of computing the ftle does not use the linearized equations of a flow making it more general in scope of application .",
    "moreover the covariance ftle gives the deformation of sets a probabilistic interpretation .",
    "the new method of computing the covariance ftle introduced in this paper is based on the perron - frobenius operator ; a common tool in probabilistic methods of phase space transport .",
    "this puts the perron - frobenius operator at the center of study of phase space transport .",
    "this is perhaps intuitively obvious since the perron - frobenius operator contains all the information of global transport of sets .",
    "the method of computing the covariance ftle using the perron - frobenius operator is a step towards combining the probabilistic and geometric methods of phase space transport , into a common unified framework ."
