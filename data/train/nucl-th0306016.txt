    "the colliders of ultrarelativistic nuclei , the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) at brookhaven national laboratory and the future large hadron collider ( lhc ) at cern , were designed for the primary aim to provide conditions for creating and detecting quark - gluon plasma . the conditions to create such an unexplored state of matter",
    "are expected to be fulfilled in central hadronic collisions of heavy nuclei like au and pb .",
    "however , new phenomena in heavy ion collisions are anticipated also beyond the domain of impact parameter @xmath3 , where hadronic interactions of nuclei with the nuclear radii @xmath4 and @xmath5 are confined . due to the long - range electromagnetic interaction , ultraperipheral collisions of nuclei with @xmath6 can be also considered . according to the weizscker - williams method  @xcite",
    ", the lorentz - contracted coulomb fields of moving charges can be represented as intense sources of equivalent virtual photons with a wide energy spectrum .",
    "depending on virtual photon energy , the absorption of photons leads to a variety of photonuclear reactions with emission of nucleons , nuclear fragments and mesons  @xcite .",
    "this is commonly termed as electromagnetic dissociation ( ed ) of nuclei .",
    "low - energy few - mev photons are the most frequent in the spectrum , and the excitation of giant resonances ( gr ) in nuclei , in particular , giant dipole resonance ( gdr ) followed by neutron emission is the most probable channel of electromagnetic dissociation .      since the first pioneering studies of the electromagnetic dissociation  @xcite",
    ", the process has gained a wide - spread interpretation as disintegration of one of the collision partners in ultraperipheral collisions of heavy ions without direct overlap of their nuclear densities .",
    "this consideration is fully justified in fixed target experiments , where the electromagnetic dissociation of either projectile or target nuclei is detected .",
    "very recent experiments  @xcite can be mentioned as examples of projectile and target dissociation measurements , respectively .",
    "both at the rhic and lhc colliders , the single electromagnetic dissociation cross section by far exceeds the geometrical hadronic cross section due to the direct nuclear overlap , as shown by calculations  @xcite . as a result",
    ", electromagnetic dissociation and @xmath7-pair production followed by electron capture will reduce the beam life - time in the colliders  @xcite .",
    "the consideration of single electromagnetic dissociation should be extended further , since both of the colliding nuclei may be disintegrated in a single event by their coulomb fields . in this case",
    "mutual electromagnetic dissociation takes place  @xcite .",
    "this process can best be studied in heavy - ion colliders , in contrast to fixed target experiments , and has a practical application .",
    "it makes possible to monitor collider luminosity via the registration of correlated forward - backward neutrons produced in mutual electromagnetic dissociation .",
    "in addition , the experimental studies of the mutual electromagnetic dissociation of heavy nuclei in colliders can provide valuable information on double and triple excitations of giant resonances in heavy nuclei .",
    "such exotic collective excitations of nuclear matter are difficult to study in fixed target experiments , since the contributions of double and triple excitations are at the level of @xmath8% and @xmath9% , respectively  @xcite .",
    "according to the weizscker - williams method  @xcite , the impact of the lorentz - boosted coulomb field of the nucleus @xmath10 is treated as the absorption of equivalent photons by the nucleus @xmath11 .    in the rest frame of this nucleus the spectrum of photons from the collision partner @xmath10 at impact parameter @xmath12",
    "is expressed as : @xmath13 here @xmath14 is the fine structure constant , @xmath15 is an argument of the modified bessel functions of zero and first orders , @xmath16 and @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 is the lorentz factor of the moving charge @xmath20 in the rest frame of @xmath11 . if the lorentz factor of each heavy - ion beam is @xmath21 in the laboratory system , then @xmath22 for the case of collider .",
    "for example , at lhc the coulomb fields of ions are extremely lorentz - contracted , @xmath23 .",
    "the mean number of photons absorbed by the nucleus @xmath11 in the collision at impact parameter @xmath12 is defined by : @xmath24 where the appropriate total photoabsorption cross section @xmath25 is used . for @xmath26 one",
    "usually takes the neutron emission threshold , while the upper limit of integration is @xmath27 .",
    "the calculation results for @xmath28 are shown in fig .",
    "[ m ] for @xmath29   a  gev auau collisions at rhic and for @xmath30  a  tev pbpb collisions at lhc .",
    "the range of integration in eq .",
    "( [ mb ] ) extends well above the gr region , which gives the main contribution .",
    "however , the inverse - square dependence @xmath31 mentioned in ref .",
    "@xcite still can be used to approximate the results shown in fig .",
    "[ m ] . the lower limit of impact parameter in electromagnetic interactions is approximately given by the sum of nuclear radii , @xmath32 . despite the fact that nuclei are relatively transparent for photons , the mean number of photons absorbed in close electromagnetic collisions ( @xmath33 ) is not small , @xmath34 , at rhic and lhc .",
    "this is due to the fact that the flux of equivalent photons is quite high due to the extreme lorentz contraction of coulomb fields and high @xmath35 of colliding nuclei .      assuming the poisson distribution for the number of absorbed photons , the total single dissociation cross section for the nucleus @xmath11 due to the exchange of one photon is given by : @xmath36 for the leading order ( lo ) process . here",
    "the probability of single lo dissociation @xmath37 at given impact parameter @xmath12 is introduced .",
    "consequently , for the next - to - leading order ( nlo ) process with two exchanged photons ( nlo@xmath38 ) : @xmath39      following the assumption that the primary and secondary photon exchanges in the lo process of mutual dissociation shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : emsecond ] may be considered independently ( see details in ref .",

( [ eq : sm ] ) the probability of dissociation of the nucleus @xmath11 at impact parameter @xmath12 via the channel @xmath40 is defined as : @xmath43 @xmath44 is the spectrum of virtual photons from the collision partner @xmath10 at impact parameter @xmath12 . @xmath25 and @xmath45 are the total photoabsorption cross section and the branching ratio for the channel @xmath40 , respectively , for the absorption of a photon with energy @xmath46 on the nucleus @xmath11 .",
