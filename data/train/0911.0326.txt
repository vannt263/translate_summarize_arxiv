    "to account for the ultraviolet extinction in the diffuse interstellar medium @xcite first proposed the possibility of diamonds in interstellar medium ( ism ) .",
    "the 3.43 and 3.53 @xmath4 emission bands in circumstellar media of ae / be herbig stars hd  97048 and elias  1 show convincing presence of nanodiamonds @xcite .",
    "@xcite attribute these bands to c - h stretching in hydrogenated nanodiamond , as distinct from the 3.3 @xmath5 m pah feature .",
    "the 3.47 @xmath4 feature in absorption toward a number of proto - stars is attributed to the tertiary c - h stretching mode in diamond like structures @xcite .",
    "spectra of diamondoid molecules @xcite show that nanodiamonds a few nanometre in size could be responsible for the 3.53 and 3.43 @xmath5 m emission lines and smaller diamondoids give the 3.47 @xmath5 m absorption feature .    cosmic nanodiamonds are also detected in primitive carbonaceous meteorites of presolar origin @xcite .",
    "in fact , nanodiamonds are considered to be the most abundant presolar component in meteorites @xcite .",
    "@xcite studied @xmath6 stretching mode of nanodiamonds extracted from orgueil meteorite and observed the above mentioned ir bands .",
    "if the ism nanodiamonds are not hydrogenated their detection is hard @xcite and they could be more abundant than estimated by the observations of infrared @xmath6 bands @xcite .",
    "it is , therefore , important to incorporate nanodiamonds in uv extinction models for which their independent scattering and extinction properties need to be understood .",
    "the extinction properties of nanodiamond dust have been reported @xcite for spherical shape and the far - uv break of spectral energy in quasars is attributed to nanodiamond dust @xcite . in this communication extinction properties of nanodiamond grains of different ellipsoidal shapes and sizes are reported . to study the effect of nanodiamond within graphite extinction efficiencies",
    "are also reported for nanodiamond - graphite as core - mantle grains .",
    "an extinction curve modeling is proposed including nanodiamond as a component .",
    "various aspects of evolution of carbon in the ism have been discussed in literature @xcite . it is generally assumed that the ism carbon is primarily hydrogenated amorphous carbon ( hac ) that transforms to graphite and diamond like structures in the presence of uv radiation field @xcite .",
    "regions with low uv radiations , such as dense clouds and giant star atmospheres , graphitic particles may be absent @xcite .",
    "the estimated time - scale of graphitization varies from few weeks for circumstellar grains @xcite to @xmath7 years for interstellar grains @xcite .",
    "nanodiamonds can result from annealing of the carbonaceous material by uv radiation e.g. in supernova ejecta @xcite .",
    "observations show that the hydrogenated nanodiamond features arise in the inner regions close to the central star , having higher uv flux @xcite .",
    "surface energy studies show that small diamonds are more stable against thermal evaporation and chemical attack compared to graphite particles @xcite .",
    "formation of nanodiamonds has been studied in laboratory giving insight to possible routes of their formation in ism .",
    "nanodiamond formation is seen to result from carbon vapour deposition ( cvd ) @xcite , detonation of carbon based explosives @xcite , electron irradiation of graphitic shells ( carbon onions ) @xcite and ion beam irradiation of amorphous carbon films @xcite .",
    "@xcite on the basis hrtem studies suggest that diamonds and graphite few nanometre in size are formed by nucleation in organic ice mixture subjected to uv photolysis .",
    "structural rearrangement between diamond and graphite is also possible .",
    "graphite subjected to annealing / irradiation may go to shelled onion like form @xcite or transform into nanodiamond @xcite .",
    "laboratory experiments also show that the @xmath8 ratio changes by different doses of uv radiation @xcite .",
    "chemical conversion of pah clusters to nanodiamonds is proposed by @xcite .",
    "partial graphitization of nanodiamond due to heat @xcite or pressure conditions @xcite is suggested on the basis of some experimental studies .",
    "theoretical analysis by @xcite show that surface graphitization of nanodiamond under strong radiation field can lead to core - mantle like shell structure with upto 80% graphitization .",
    "thus nanodiamonds are possible within ism carbonaceous matter and would modify the optical properties of dust .",
    "graphitic mantle will make the nanodiamond crystals chemically less active and hard to detect spectroscopically .",
    "to calculate the extinction , scattering , absorption and polarization efficiencies the discrete dipole approximation ( dda ) is used @xcite .",
    "the ddscat 6.1 ( http://www.astro.princeton.edu/draine/ddscat.htm ) is utilized for the calculations . in dda",
    "the continuous target is discretized by an array of dipoles placed at cubic lattices and the dielectric constant of the target material as a function of wavelength at ism temperatures is required .",
    "in general , optical properties of nano - sized particles are different from that of the bulk due to additional collisions of conducting electrons with the grain boundary .",
    "the imaginary part of the dielectric constant is changed to accommodate size effects and expressed as : @xmath9 @xcite , where @xmath10 is the electron velocity at the fermi surface , @xmath11 is the plasma frequency , @xmath12 is a constant of order unity and @xmath13 is the frequency of incident electromagnetic radiation . the second term increases with decreasing size and decreases rapidly with increase in frequency .",
    "as a result the dielectric constant does not vary appreciably with size in high frequency visible and uv regions data for @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 from @xcite the imaginary part of dielectric constant becomes @xmath14 , where a is in nanometer . at this wavelength @xmath15",
    "is @xmath16 3.2 and will be negligibly affected by particle size ( second term ) . the free electron density in diamond is smaller than graphite so the corresponding @xmath10 and @xmath17 will be smaller . thus at high frequencies size affect in the case of nanodiamonds will be even smaller . ] whereas , it varies slightly in the ir .",
    "the extinction , absorption and scattering efficiencies for nano - sized particles are very small in ir compared to visible and uv region , so small change in refractive index in the ir will not affect the result in general .",
    "thus the refractive index data of bulk graphite and diamond are taken for all nano - sized particles .",
    "meteoritic nanodiamonds , with their density lower by 30% and relatively high hydrogen content @xcite , differ from terrestrial diamonds .",
    "while terrestrial diamonds are cubic , the meteoritic diamonds are of allende type @xcite ( small nanodiamonds found within allende meteorites ) or carbonado diamonds @xcite ( relatively large , black and porous ) .",
    "ism nanodiamonds can be assumed to have properties more like the meteoritic nanodiamonds .",
    "for the present work we consider allende nanodiamond to be the candidate material and take the dielectric constants reported by @xcite .",
    "the size of meteoritic nanodiamonds are reported to be @xmath18 in allende type @xcite and between @xmath19 to @xmath20 in orgueil meteorite @xcite .",
    "theoretical study of nanodiamonds with fullerene like surface @xcite suggests particle sizes from @xmath19 to @xmath20 .",
    "@xcite report that graphite particles with radius @xmath21 are thermodynamically unstable while the diamond structure is stable .",
    "ir spectroscopic study of diamondoids @xcite points towards possibility of @xmath22 nanodiamond in ism while @xcite suggest that the 3.43 and 3.53 @xmath4 emission features are observable for nanodiamond @xmath23 .",
    "@xcite suggests log - normal particle size distribution between @xmath19 to @xmath1 with peak diameter at @xmath24 . for the present work nanodiamond size",
    "is taken to be between @xmath19 to @xmath1 .",
    "the target nanodiamonds are taken as oblate and prolate spheroids and ellipsoids and their different axial ratios as given in table 1 .",
    "the size of these ellipsoids are taken such that the effective volume for each is equal to a sphere of radius @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 , so that nearly all possible nanodiamond sizes are taken into account .",
    "table 1 also gives , for @xmath1 nanodiamonds , the largest semi - axes and the number of dipoles used in dda calculations .",
    "the validity criteria for dda i.e. @xmath29 is well considered and in none of the calculation it is more than @xmath30 . to reduce calculation time 9 orientations for nanodiamond are considered as calculation for all 27 orientations done for some cases makes a difference of less than @xmath31 .",
    "the core - mantle model consisting of spherical nanodiamond core in different ellipsoidal graphitic mantle is represented in fig.[fig1 ] with the ellipsoid semi axes ` a ' , ` b ' and ` c ' and spherical core of radius ` r ' .",
    "the last column in table 1 gives nanodiamond percentage in total grain volume for ` a ' and ` r ' in the ratio @xmath32 .",
    "all nanodiamond - graphite ( core - mantle ) calculations are done for 27 orientations .",
    "calculations are done for 64 wavelengths from far - uv to near ir ( @xmath33 ) and linear in @xmath34 .",
    ".ellipsoid axial ratios , largest axis , no . of dipoles considered & nanodiamond % in core - mantle calculations [ cols=\"^,^,^,^ \" , ]     for comparison table 2 also shows the @xmath35 nanodiamond , two component model , that gives 0.40 silicate and 0.49 graphite fractions .",
    "this is well within estimated silicate and graphite grain abundances @xcite . on adding nanodiamond - graphite core - mantle particles as the third component the fit improves .",
    "this very small grain component is a small fraction of carbonaceous particles having even smaller nanodiamond core .",
    "that is much lower than the @xmath36 upper limit of ism nanodiamond reported by @xcite .",
    "the core - mantle component also reduces the graphite fraction slightly and changes negligibly the relative fraction of silicates .",
    "the @xmath37 values increase with increasing percentage of nanodiamond in graphite mantle but its overall contribution ( fraction ` s ' ) decreases .",
    "the fraction of nanodiamond - graphite is also much smaller than used by @xcite for @xmath38 nanodiamond grains .",
    "considering nanodiamond density of 3.52  gm / cc the nanodiamonds in our models are @xmath39 fraction of carbonaceous particles .",
    "the best fit , in the complete 0.2 to 10 @xmath40 wavelength range , stands for smaller nanodiamond in larger amount . for effective grain size of @xmath38 , the @xmath41 nanodiamond core implies @xmath42 size , which is about the size of nanodiamond in meteorites @xcite .",
    "the above results assume only allende type nanodiamonds in ism .",
    "alternatively ism nanodiamonds could be like terrestrial cubic diamonds , sp3 hybridized polymeric carbon or a complex mixture of these forms .",
    "different types of diamonds have different dielectric functions and will lead to slightly different extinction profiles . while @xcite consider sp3 polymeric carbon coatings , @xcite consider both cubic and allende type nanodiamonds .",
    "allende type nanodiamonds show far - uv steepening and peaking at lower frequencies than cubic diamonds and the far - uv break in quasars is better represented when greater proportion of allende type nanodiamonds are considered @xcite .",
    "various experimental , theoretical and observational studies suggest the possibility of carbon in diamond form in the ism . besides enhanced far - uv extinction @xcite , luminescence from diamond nano - crystals could be responsible for the extended red emission ( ere ) @xcite .",
    "the study of extinction properties of possible nanodiamond grains of different shapes and sizes is done to understand their role in far - uv extinction and in modification of the overall extinction curve .",
    "the extinction due to nanodiamonds of all shapes and sizes is essentially similar with negligible extinction from ir to near uv range and sharp rise in extinction in the far - uv .",
    "the extinction due to non - spherical shape is higher than that due to spherical . for nanosized particles the extinction efficiency increases linearly with effective radius .",
    "considering nanodiamond - graphite core - mantle target , modification in the 2175  peak and graphite extinction is studied . in general",
    "the 2175  peak gets lowered , broadened and there is enhanced far - uv extinction .",
    "increase in % of @xmath43 character in graphite gives rise to higher far - uv extinction .",
    "the three component modeling of average galactic extinction gives best results for small sized and low % of nanodiamond .",
    "this enables us to explain far - uv rise and simultaneous modification of the 2175  bump without putting constraints on the interstellar abundances .",
    "extinction from specific objects that show enhanced far - uv rise can be attempted by incorporating a nanodiamond component .",
    "this will enhance understanding of radiation induced transformations of carbonaceous matter in the ism .",
    "the use of high performance computing and library facilities at iucaa , pune is acknowledged .",
    "valuable discussions with dr .",
    "r. gupta and dr .",
    "vaidya are greatly appreciated ."
