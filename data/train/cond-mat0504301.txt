    "much interest has been attracted recently to the anomalous properties of low - disordered , strongly correlated two - dimensional ( 2d ) electron systems .",
    "the effects of electron - electron interactions are especially strong in silicon metal - oxide - semiconductor field - effect transistors ( mosfets ) ( for recent reviews , see refs .",
    "@xcite ) , but they are also pronounced in other systems like gaas / algaas @xcite and si / sige heterostructures @xcite .",
    "interactions lead , in particular , to critical behavior of the pauli spin susceptibility @xcite and sharply increasing effective mass at low electron densities @xcite",
    ". these phenomena ( at least in si mosfets ) are not dominated by spin exchange effects , since the land @xmath0 factor is found to be close to its value in a bulk semiconductor and the effective mass is insensitive to the degree of spin polarization . at the same time , spin effects are the origin of the strong positive magnetoresistance in parallel magnetic fields ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "therefore , one can probe the spin effects by studying peculiarities of a spin - polarized 2d electron system .",
    "the case of complete spin polarization of the electron system is especially interesting because it is the simplest from the theoretical point of view .",
    "it is known that application of a parallel magnetic field causes giant ( orders of magnitude ) positive magnetoresistance and fully suppresses the metallic state near the 2d metal - insulator transition @xcite .",
    "however , if the electron density is not too low ( ballistic regime , @xmath1 @xcite ) , the metallic temperature dependence of conductivity has been found to persist in the fully spin - polarized state @xcite .",
    "( note that in silicon - based devices studied in these papers , electrons possess the valley degree of freedom , which survives in the fully spin - polarized state . )",
    "conductivity of silicon mosfets in this regime was studied in ref .",
    "however , for much of their data ( particularly at relatively high temperatures and/or electron densities ) , the complete spin polarization was in fact not reached as a result of the insufficiently high magnetic fields used .",
    "theoretically , linear - in - temperature corrections to the zero - field conductivity in the ballistic regime were calculated in ref .",
    "@xcite . in the newer theory @xcite ,",
    "the exchange interaction terms were treated more carefully .",
    "however , it turned out that at @xmath2 , both the screening @xcite and the interaction - based @xcite theories describe the temperature - dependent conductivity equally well @xcite . to distinguish between them",
    ", studies of the effect of the parallel magnetic field on conductivity may be helpful .",
    "here we experimentally study the transport properties of a 2d electron system in silicon in parallel magnetic fields at different degrees of spin polarization in the ballistic regime .",
    "we show that in a completely spin - polarized state , disorder effects are dominant when approaching the regime of strong localization , which is in contrast to the behavior of the unpolarized state in low - disordered 2d electron systems .",
    "the temperature - dependent correction to the elastic relaxation time is found to change strongly with the degree of spin polarization , reaching a minimum just below the onset of full spin polarization , where the conductivity is practically independent of temperature . in the fully spin - polarized state ,",
    "the correction mentioned above is about two times weaker than that in @xmath2 at the same electron density .",
    "this is consistent with what one expects according to the simple version of screening theory @xcite .",
    "measurements were made in an oxford dilution refrigerator on ( 100)-silicon mosfets with peak electron mobilities of about 3  m@xmath3/vs at 0.1  k. the resistance was measured with a standard 4-terminal technique at a low frequency ( 1  hz ) to minimize the out - of - phase signal .",
    "excitation current was kept low enough ( below 1  na ) to ensure that measurements were taken in the linear regime of response .",
    "contact resistances in these samples were minimized by using a split - gate technique that allows one to maintain a high electron density in the vicinity of the contacts ( about @xmath4  @xmath5 ) , regardless of its value in the main part of the sample .    in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , we show low - temperature conductivity as a function of electron density , @xmath6 , in the metallic regime ( i.e. , when the conductivity @xmath7 ) for fully spin - polarized and spin - unpolarized states in two slightly different samples . as the electron density",
    "is decreased , the conductivity significantly drops as a result of a decrease in the electron mobility @xmath8 ( insets to fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "this mobility decrease originates from the effects of both disorder and electron - electron interactions .",
    "the former determines the elastic relaxation time , @xmath9 , while the latter is responsible for the enhanced effective mass @xcite . taking the effective mass values from ref .",
    "@xcite , we have calculated @xmath9 as shown in the insets to fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] . for the spin - unpolarized state ,",
    "the behavior of @xmath9 for the two samples is qualitatively different , although the mobilities are very similar . in sample a , the decrease in @xmath8 at low densities is dominated by electron - electron interactions ( increasing effective mass ) , while in sample b , disorder effects are more pronounced and lead to @xmath9 decreasing at low @xmath6 . in the fully spin - polarized state ,",
    "the disorder effects prevail in both samples .",
    "experimental traces of the parallel - field magnetoresistance at different temperatures are displayed in fig .",
    "the low - temperature resistivity , @xmath10 , rises with @xmath11 and saturates above a certain @xmath6-dependent magnetic field , @xmath12 , corresponding to the onset of complete spin polarization of the 2d electrons @xcite .",
    "increasing the temperature leads to smearing the dependences so that the resistance saturation occurs at higher magnetic fields .",
    "in other words , the saturation field increases as the temperature is increased @xcite .",
    "the resistivity rises appreciably with increasing temperature in both @xmath2 and @xmath13 , here the saturation field @xmath14 corresponds to the highest temperature used in the experiment .",
    "the magnetoresistance at two electron densities measured at the highest temperature used , @xmath15  k , is shown in the inset to fig .",
    "the fact that the magnetoresistance saturates at sufficiently high magnetic fields confirms that the full spin polarization is reached in our experiment even at this temperature . as seen from fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , just below @xmath12 the resistivity practically does not depend on temperature up to the highest temperatures used .",
    "the validity of this effect , which has also been observed in refs .",
    "@xcite , has been verified at ten electron densities in the range between @xmath16 and @xmath17  @xmath5 .",
    "we would like to emphasize that the flattening of @xmath18 just below the onset of complete spin polarization makes it difficult to analyze the data for @xmath18 obtained in a fixed magnetic field or in a narrow field region @xcite as the complete spin polarization may have not been reached at higher temperatures and/or electron densities .",
    "the low - temperature ratio @xmath19 vs.electron density is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] . in agreement with the previously obtained data , it increases weakly with decreasing @xmath6 , being close to the value @xmath20 predicted by the theory of the spin - polarization - dependent screening of a random potential @xcite .",
    "as seen from the inset , the ratio @xmath19 diminishes somewhat at higher temperatures .",
    "the normalized conductivity as a function of temperature in fully spin - polarized and spin - unpolarized states is depicted in the inset to fig .",
    "the correction to @xmath21 is linear in temperature with the slope given by @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is obtained by linear extrapolation of the data to @xmath24 .",
    "we emphasize that the so - defined slopes do not depend on @xmath9 and are therefore different from the slopes defined in ref .",
    "@xcite as @xmath25 : the ratio of the slopes @xmath26/[d\\sigma(0)/dt]$ ] used there is smaller by a factor of @xmath27 than the ratio @xmath28 used in this paper .    in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , we show how the ratio of the slopes @xmath28 for completely spin - polarized and unpolarized states changes with electron density . being approximately equal to 0.5 at low @xmath6 ,",
    "the slope ratio increases weakly with increasing @xmath6 but remains less than one in the range of electron densities studied .",
    "thus , the metallic behavior of the normalized conductivity is always suppressed in the fully spin - polarized state .",
    "we give a qualitative account of the absence of the @xmath18 dependence just below the onset of complete spin polarization . in the magnetic field @xmath29 ,",
    "the degree of spin polarization decreases linearly with temperature : @xmath30 ( where the factor @xmath31 and @xmath32 is the fermi energy of the spin - polarized 2d electrons ) .",
    "the increase in the number of electrons with opposite spin direction naturally leads to increasing conductivity .",
    "therefore , near the onset of complete spin polarization there exists another contribution to the temperature - dependent conductivity , whose sign is opposite compared to the conventional screening behavior of @xmath18 . in the simple version of the screening theory @xcite , the derivative @xmath33 at @xmath24 tends to infinity as one approaches the field @xmath12 from below .",
    "this feature will obviously be smeared out at finite temperatures and/or due to the disorder present in real electron systems .",
    "it is clear that depending on disorder strength , two opposite contributions to the linear - in-@xmath34 correction to conductivity can in principle balance each other @xcite .",
    "it is worth comparing the behavior of 2d electron system in si mosfets to that in another two - valley system , si / sige quantum wells .",
    "transport properties of the latter system have been found to be very similar to those of silicon mosfets @xcite , although the disordered potential in both cases is different resulting , particularly , from the presence / absence of a spacer .",
    "however , the peculiarities near the onset of complete spin polarization are less pronounced in si / sige quantum wells than in mosfets : only a weakening , but not absence , of the temperature dependence of the resistance has been observed in the metallic regime in a partially spin - polarized state @xcite .",
    "theoretically , the effect of the weakening of the @xmath18 dependence near the onset of complete spin polarization has been found for the 2d electrons in si / sige quantum wells in the frames of screening approach @xcite .",
    "we now compare the experimental ratio of the slopes @xmath28 with theoretical predictions .",
    "as we have already mentioned , in zero magnetic field , both the temperature - dependent screening theory @xcite and the interaction - based theory @xcite describe reasonably well the available experimental data for @xmath18 in silicon mosfets @xcite . for the fully spin - polarized state , however , their predictions are very different . in theory",
    "@xcite , the ratio @xmath28 ( for a two - valley 2d system ) is formally equal to @xmath35 @xcite , once the effective mass , as well as the @xmath0 factor , are independent of the degree of spin polarization @xcite . here",
    "the interaction parameter @xmath36 is responsible for the renormalization of the @xmath0 factor through @xmath37 , the coefficient @xmath38 if @xmath39 and @xmath40 if @xmath41 , and @xmath42 is the valley splitting . for negative @xmath36 , the observed slope ratio ( fig .  [ fig4 ] ) can not at all be attained within the approach @xcite : based on the @xmath2 data for @xmath36 @xcite , considerably smaller values of the slope ratio are expected compared to the experiment . on the other hand , according to the screening theory in its simple form ( ignoring the local field corrections ) , the ratio @xmath28 is equal to 0.5 , as inferred from doubling the fermi energy due to the lifting of the spin degeneracy @xcite .",
    "this value is close to the experimental finding .",
    "the observed decrease of the slope ratio at low electron densities is likely to be similar to the behavior of the resistance ratio mentioned above ( see fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) . concerning the data for si / sige quantum wells @xcite",
    ", one can evaluate the slope ratio for @xmath43  @xmath5 at about 0.45 , which is consistent with our results .",
    "in summary , we have found that in the ballistic regime , the metallic temperature dependence of the conductivity in a two - dimensional electron system in silicon changes non - monotonically with the degree of spin polarization .",
    "it fades away just below the onset of complete spin polarization but reappears again , being suppressed , in the fully spin - polarized state .",
    "a qualitative account of the effect of the disappearance of the @xmath18 dependence near the onset of complete spin polarization is given .",
    "while in zero magnetic field both the temperature - dependent screening theory and the interaction - based theory provide a reasonably good description of experimental data for the temperature - dependent conductivity in the ballistic regime , the results obtained in the fully spin - polarized state favor the screening theory in its simple form .",
