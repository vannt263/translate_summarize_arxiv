    "multidimensional theories suggest a great variety of geometries , topologies and compactification schemes ( for reviews see , e.g. , [ 14 ] and references therein ) .",
    "one of the opportunities of interest is that the geometry can be effectively four - dimensional in some space - time region but have a greater dimension in other regions .",
    "we here try to obtain examples of such space - times in the framework of 6d  with a minimally coupled scalar field as a source of gravity .",
    "more specifically , we consider a 6d space - time of the form @xmath3 , where @xmath1 is 2d lorentzian space - time , while each of @xmath2 is a two - sphere or a two - torus . as @xmath4 , we assume an  or asymptotically de sitter 4d geometry times small extra dimensions , while at the other end , @xmath5",
    ", we expect a geometry with large extra dimensions .",
    "we give three explicit examples of such solutions . in two of them",
    "the 4d subspace has a  geometry , while the third example corresponds to the notion of a black universe , that is , a  with an expanding universe instead of a singularity beyond its horizon @xcite .    in all these cases , the solutions can only be obtained with a phantom scalar field , having a wrong sign of kinetic energy .",
    "such fields naturally emerge in some unification theories , there are theoretical arguments both _",
    "pro et contra _ their possible existence , see , e.g. , discussions in @xcite . in this paper , as in many others , we admit it as a working hypothesis .",
    "we consider 6d gr with a minimally coupled scalar field @xmath6 having a potential @xmath7 as the only source of gravity . the total action is [ act ] s = , where @xmath8 is the 6d planck mass , @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the 6d ricci scalar and metric determinant , respectively , @xmath11 is @xmath12 for a normal , canonical scalar field and @xmath13 for a phantom one , and @xmath14 .",
    "the corresponding equations of motion are the scalar field equation @xmath15 and the s which can be written as [ ee ] r^a_b = - ^a_b - t^a_b - ^a_b t^c_c - 2_^a_b+ v ( ) ^a_b , where @xmath16 is the 6d ricci tensor and @xmath17 is the stress - energy tensor ( set ) of the scalar field .",
    "consider a 6d manifold being a direct product of three 2d spaces , @xmath3 , where @xmath1 is 2d space - time with the coordinates @xmath18 and @xmath19 , while @xmath20 and @xmath21 are compact 2d spaces of constant nonnegative curvature , i.e. , each of them can be a sphere or a torus .",
    "the metric is taken in the form : [ ds_6 ] ds^2 = a(x ) dt^2 - dx^2/a(x ) - r(x ) d_1 ^ 2 - p(x ) d_2 ^ 2 , where @xmath22 are functions of the `` radial '' coordinate @xmath23 , chosen under the condition @xmath24 ( the so - called quasiglobal gauge @xcite ) , while @xmath25 and @xmath26 are @xmath23-independent metrics on 2d manifolds @xmath20 and @xmath21 of unit size .",
    "we also assume @xmath27 .",
    "we do not fix which of @xmath2 belongs to our 4d space - time and which is `` extra '' : everything depends on their size .",
    "thus , if @xmath20 is large and spherical while @xmath21 is small and toroidal , we have a  configuraton in 4d and a toroidal extra space , and so on .    due to the symmetry of the problem and the properties of the scalar field set ,",
    "there are four independent equations , which may be written as follows ( the prime denotes @xmath28 ) : [ 00 ] r^t_t = - ^t_t  - ( pr)^-1(a pr) = v ( ) , + [ 01 ] r^t_t - r^x_x = -^t_t + ^x_x    + = -_^2 , + [ 02 ] r^t_t - r^_a = 0  [ p ( ar - ar)] = 2_1 p , [ 05 ] r^t_t - r^_m = 0  [ r ( ap - ap)] = 2_2 r , where @xmath29 ( belong to @xmath20 , @xmath30 ( belong to @xmath21 , there is no summing over an underlined index , @xmath31 if @xmath20 is a sphere and @xmath32 if it is a torus , and similarly for @xmath33 and @xmath21 .",
    "equations and contain only the metric functions @xmath34 .",
    "therefore , considering them separately , these are two equations for three unknown functions , so there is arbitrariness in one function . if the metric functions are known , the other two s can be used to find the scalar @xmath6 and the potential @xmath35 . from it",
    "follows that solutions with @xmath36 and @xmath37 in the whole range @xmath38 can only exist with @xmath39 , i.e. , a phantom field , since such solutions require @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "the metric under consideration describes the following types of geometries :    \\(i ) ss ( double spherical ) space - times : the case @xmath42 .",
    "\\(ii ) st ( spherical - toroidal ) space - times : the case @xmath43 or vice versa . if @xmath44 is large and @xmath21 small , we have static spherical symmetry in our space - time and a small toroidal extra space .",
    "the opposite situation is also possible as well as a total observable 6d geometry .",
    "\\(iii ) tt ( double toroidal ) space - times : if @xmath45 , we have the same as before but both @xmath20 and @xmath21 are toroidal .",
    "we seek configurations where @xmath38 and there are different geometries in the two asymptotic regions @xmath46 . in particular , there can be a 4d flat asymptotic region at large negative @xmath23 times small extra dimensions and something different at the other end . in this section",
    "we do not consider the properties of the scalar field but only analyze which kinds of asymptotic behaviour are compatible with and for each of the types 13 of 6d geometry .",
    "as an example , let us consider an  4d space - time with constant extra dimensions in ss geometry . without loss of generality ,",
    "this means that [ flat+ ] a(x ) ,  r(x ) ~x^2 ,  p(x )  x. let us substitute these conditions to and . according to , @xmath47 , @xmath48 or even smaller ( due to the expansion @xmath49 ) , and the l.h.s . of tends , in general ,",
    "to a nonzero constant , which agrees with the requirement to @xmath50 that stands on the r.h.s .. however , in the expression in square brackets tends to a constant , hence its derivative vanishes , while the r.h.s .",
    ", equal to @xmath51 , should behave as @xmath52 .",
    "we conclude that _ the asymptotic conditions are incompatible with the field equations .",
    "_    on equal grounds we could consider @xmath53 and/or exchange @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "other opportunities are considered in the same manner , and the results are summarized in table 1 .",

    "in addition to effectively 6d asymptotics , there can exist an  4d space - time with constant extra dimensions .",
    "evidently , at the two ends , @xmath67 , one can have similar or different admissible asymptotics . in",
    "what follows we will give three examples of such solutions to the field equations where on one end there is a 4d geometry with small extra dimensions and on the other there is an effectively 6d space - time .",
    "of interest are space - times with  geometry in one asymptotic region and something different in the other .",
    "the first example is an st wormhole geometry with a strongly different size of extra dimensions at the two ends , which exists among well - known solutions for a massless scalar , @xmath68 @xcite .",
    "one of such solutions has the form @xcite ( note that the coordinate @xmath69 is different from @xmath23 used in the rest of the paper ) [ ds_2 ] ds^2 = dt^2 - ^-4nu-^2nud_2 ^ 2 , = cu ( c / k)^-1 ( -z/ ) , where @xmath70 are integration constants related by @xmath71 .",
    "it describes a , twice  wormhole in the 4d subspace @xmath72 with a toroidal extra space @xmath21 having a unit size , @xmath73 at @xmath74 ( that is , @xmath75 ) and the size @xmath76 at the other end , @xmath77 , corresponding to @xmath78 .",
    "suppose that the size of extra dimensions @xmath73 on the left end , @xmath79 , is small enough to be invisible by modern instruments , say , @xmath80 cm .",
    "the size @xmath81 on the other end is much larger if @xmath82 is large enough .",
    "for example , to obtain @xmath83 m , one should take @xmath84 .",
    "the  throat is a minimum of @xmath85 , its radius is equal to [ r_th ] r _ = . to make this radius large enough for passing of a macroscopic body ,",
    "large values of @xmath86 are required : e.g. , to obtain @xmath87 m , one has to suppose @xmath88 .      with nonzero potentials",
    "@xmath7 , in most cases solutions can be found only numerically .",
    "an exception appears if after integrating we turn the appearing constant to zero .",
    "it then follows @xmath89 , @xmath90 , and takes the form @xmath91 ' = 2a$ ] .",
    "it is a single equation for two functions @xmath56 and @xmath54 , which can be solved by quadratures if one specifies @xmath56 since it can be rewritten as [ r ] ( ra) = a(x ) dx . to obtain an example with an  4d space - time on the left end and an ads asymptotic on the right ( a transition from line 2 to line 7 in table 1 )",
    ", we should suppose @xmath92 as @xmath53 and @xmath93 as @xmath94 .",
    "it is hard to find @xmath56 with such properties that would lead to good analytic expressions of other quantities .",
    "therefore , an example has been obtained with a piecewise smooth function @xmath56 @xcite : [ a(x ) ] a(x ) = 1 ,   x 0;a(x ) = 1 + 3 x^2/a^2 ,  x0 ( a = > 0 ) .",
    "the resulting solution has a @xmath95 smooth metric but jumps in @xmath96 and @xmath35 ( figure 1 ) .",
    "we have @xmath89 in the whole space and the following behavior of @xmath54 : [ r- ] r(x ) = x^2 + b^2   ( x 0 ) , r(x ) = ( 1 + )   ( x 0 ) , with @xmath97 ( thus @xmath98 is a throat of radius @xmath99 ) . at negative @xmath23 we have @xmath100 and @xmath101 while at positive @xmath23 the expressions are rather cumbersome .",
    "the resulting configuration is  times constant ( arbitrarily small ) extra dimensions on the left end and a 6d ads asymptotic on the right end , with @xmath35 tending to a negative constant playing the role of a cosmological constant .",
    "the jumps in @xmath102 and @xmath103 at @xmath98 could be easily removed by choosing @xmath56 smoother than @xmath95 at @xmath98 , which is possible by making a suitable arbitrarily small addition to .      in ss geometry , corresponding to @xmath105 , it is hard to solve equations and analytically , but examples of interest can be obtained numerically .",
    "one such solution , which has been found under the assumption @xmath106 , realizes a transition from line 6 to line 7 of table 1 .",
    "the metric functions are plotted in figure 2 , the corresponding @xmath107 and @xmath102 are not shown but are easily obtained using and .",
    "on the left end ( @xmath53 ) there is a 4d de sitter metric ( describing an exponentially expanding or contracting spherically symmetric space ) times small extra dimensions ; on the right end there is an ads static space - time .",
    "the configuration as a whole is a black universe @xcite where the cosmological expansions starts from a horizon , the static region belonging to the remote past ; in this case this expanding universe has a multidimensional origin .",
    "the results can be summarized as follows . in 6d gr with a minimally coupled scalar field as a source of gravity",
    ", we have constructed examples of space - times which are effectively 4d on the left end and effectively 6d on the right end .",
    "some of them have the nature of wormholes , others ( black universes ) actually represent expanding cosmological models of multidimensional origin . the existence of such configurations or their analogs with a different number of extra dimensions in our universe can not be a priori excluded , and their possible astrophysical consequences could be a subject of further studies .    it should be noted that our analysis certainly did not cover all opportunities : other , more complicated cases are also possible .",
    "for instance , of particular , there can be models where different subspaces exchange their roles as those belonging to a large observable space , like that described in @xcite .",
    "one more subject of a future study can be a relationship between the present scalar - vacuum system and multidimensional gravity with curvature - nonlinear actions @xcite in different conformal frames in application to space - times of the types considered here and in @xcite .",
