    "type - i bursts are nuclear explosions triggered by unstable burning on the surface of neutron stars ( for details see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "the burst spectrum is usually morphologically described as a pure blackbody , assuming that the persistent emission remains unchanged and can be subtracted off during bursting ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "generally , the persistent emission for a neutron star x - ray binary ( xrb ) mainly consist of the spectral components of a multicolor blackbody , a blackbody , and a powerlaw that is believed to have origins of accretion disc , boundary layer ( between the accretion disc and the neutron star surface ) , corona or jet ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) . in this letter",
    ", we investigated a well - known xrb 4u 160852 . according to the spectral and timing properties , 4u 160852",
    "was classified as an atoll source @xcite , for which the typical outburst evolution experiences the so - called island and banana states .",
    "theoretical predications for the possible deviations of the burst spectrum from a blackbody have been made under different mechanisms .",
    "for instance , the reflection of the burst emission by the accretion disc was considered in @xcite .",
    "in addition , the radiation of the boundary layer may also be affected by type - i bursts @xcite .",
    "@xcite proposed that the radiation torque may induce a substantial increase of the accretion rate during a type - i x - ray burst , likely resulting from the effect of poynting - robertson drag . on the contrary",
    ", @xcite predicted an ejection under the radiation pressure , of a large part of optically thin gas orbiting the neutron star .    in observations ,",
    "the possible influence of the bursts upon the accretion disc is mostly investigated with the so - called photospheric radius expansion ( pre ) bursts . for pre bursts , the x - ray luminosity reaches local eddington limit and is strong enough to lift up the outer layers of the neutron star @xcite .",
    "@xcite detected a pre burst from sax j1808.4 - 3658 in an observation campaign of _ chandra _ and _ rossi x - ray timing explorer _ ( _ rxte _ ) , and found spectral deviations from a blackbody at both low and high energies .",
    "in addition , by assuming that the shape of the persistent spectrum remains stable throughout the burst and involving a dimensionless quantity `` @xmath0 '' to account for the change in normalization of the persistent emission ( hereafter @xmath1 model ) , @xcite analyzed 332 pre bursts born out of 40 atoll sources .",
    "they found that the majority of the best - fit values of @xmath2 are significantly greater than 1 , suggesting an enhancement of the persistent flux during these bursts .",
    "since the changes of the structure of the accretion disc , i.e. the transitions between the standard disc and the advection - dominated accretion flow ( adaf ) , are expected to influence the burst spectrum , the variability of the persistent flux observed in pre burst may have a dependence on the spectral states .",
    "however , most of the pre bursts are located in the banana states @xcite and the influence of the island non - pre bursts on accretion process is less known . in order to study the bursts influence thoroughly , one needs to account as well for the non - pre bursts occurring mostly in the island state . to this end",
    "we studied the well - known x - ray binary 4u 160852 , which was firstly detected by _",
    "vela-5 _ and subsequently observed with _",
    "uhuru _ , _ heao-1 _ , _ rxte _ and other satellites @xcite .",
    "the distance to 4u 160852 was estimated as @xmath3 3.2 kpc with pre bursts when their luminosities reach eddington limit , under the assumptions of a canonical neutron star with @xmath4 , @xmath5 km , and @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "we analyzed all _ rxte _ proportional counter array ( pca , * ? ? ? * ) observations of 4u 160852 and found 46 bursts , 19 of which exhibited pre .",
    "the pre bursts have been identified by @xcite .",
    "the standard 2 mode data were used when studying the persistent spectra , for their better calibration , and the event mode data were adopted when studying detailed properties of bursts , because of their high resolution .",
    "there are five co - aligned xe multiwire proportional counter units ( pcus ) aboard _ rxte _ , and all active ones were used for the following analysis .",
    "the spectral fits were performed using _ xspec _ version 12.7.1 , during which a multiplicative model component ( wabs in xspec ) was employed to correct for the effects of interstellar absorption and the hydrogen column density was fixed to @xmath7 atoms @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "the instrumental background of pca was estimated with the latest bright source models and generated using the _ pcabackest _ version 3.8 , _ heasoft _",
    "release 6.12 . in the spectral fits ,",
    "the levenberg - marquardt algorithm was used to find the local best - fit values and their corresponding confidence intervals . because the effective area of pca drops off rapidly above 20 kev ,",
    "sometimes only a few counts are observed in higher energy band . to ensure that we could get an unbiased estimate of the parameters ,",
    "we have used the likelihood method , namely , the command `` statistic cstat '' in xspec .",
    "the fitted energy range was in principle 325 kev but subjected to a modification to 320 kev or 315 kev to avoid unphysical results born out of the poor statistics .",
    "the spectral states in which the type - i bursts occur were inferred from the positions in the color - color diagram ( ccd ) . in practice , we first produced pca lightcurves for each energy band ( 2.23.6 kev , 3.65.0 kev , 5.08.6 kev and 8.618.8 kev ) in a 128 s time bin , during which we excluded the data affected by type - i bursts . to correct for the pca gain drift over time because of the changing voltage settings , especially for different _ rxte _ gain epochs , we used the crab to calibrate the channel - to - energy conversions of pca by assuming that its intensity remains constant @xcite .",
    "the small - scale variation of the crab @xcite has little effect on the following analysis .",
    "similar to @xcite , we took the count - rate ratios of 3.65.0 kev to 2.23.6 kev as soft color and 8.618.8 kev to 5.08.6 kev as hard color for the input of the ccd diagram ( see figure 1 ) .",
    "finally , the `` island state '' or the `` banana state '' was defined with a hard color smaller or larger than 0.7 .",
    "first we produced lightcurve for each burst with a time resolution of 1/8 s. we then performed time - resolved analysis for those time intervals in which the count rate exceeds 25% of the burst peak . to improve the statistics , we summed up the time intervals so that the total counts can exceed 35000 photons .",
    "this means that , in order to have balance in statistics , the bin size has to gradually increase towards the burst tail . for the spectral fits",
    ", we employed two different models : the standard approach ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* wabs*bbodyrad in xspec ) in which the pre - burst emission is regarded as a background , and the `` @xmath0 '' model ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* wabs*(bbodyrad+@xmath9persistent flux ) in xspec ) in which the `` persistent spectrum '' is estimated by multiplying the pre - burst spectral shape with a normalization factor `` @xmath0 '' . obviously , the two approaches are equivalent when @xmath0 equals to 1 . since the type - i bursts are located in different spectral states , it is hard to estimate the persistent emissions with an exclusive model .",
    "the models we employed to fit the persistent flux were `` wabs*(gauss+bbody+comptt ) '' and `` wabs*(gauss+bbody+diskbb ) '' @xcite , and the gaussian component was set at 6.4 kev @xcite .",
    "it turned out that these two models can describe the persistent data well , and resulted in an averaged reduced @xmath10 @xmath3 1.01 ( 44dof ) .",
    "an example of the time - resolved analysis is shown in figure  [ time_resolved ] , in which the @xmath0 model was used . in figure",
    "[ time_resolved ] , the blue line shows the count rate against the burst time , for which we define the time with the maximum count rate as time zero .",
    "the red and green regions represent the 1 @xmath11 confidence interval of @xmath0 and temperature , respectively .",
    "thus , for each burst we can get a series of best - fit parameters along with the evolution of bursts . because the purpose of this letter is to distinguish the possible spectral differences between different spectral states , we divided the spectra into the island and banana groups according to the positions of bursts in the ccd ( see figure  [ ccd ] ) .",
    "here we used the reduced @xmath10 to describe the quality of the fits .",
    "figure  [ standard _ chi ] shows histograms of the reduced @xmath10 for different spectral groups when using the standard approach .",
    "clearly , the two distributions are significantly different and the kolmogorov  smirnov test gives a p - value of @xmath12 .",
    "the average reduced @xmath10 are 1.32 ( 21 dof ) and 1.71 ( 21 dof ) for the spectra in the island and the banana states , respectively .",
    "this result indicates that the fits are in generally poor in the banana state . in general , once the @xmath0 model was introduced , the average reduced @xmath10 are 1.14 ( 20 dof ) and 1.23 ( 20 dof ) for the island and the banana states , respectively , showing for both with largely improved fits .",
    "since @xmath0 was reported in @xcite to evolve strongly with the burst luminosity , we studied this trend as well but aimed at uncovering their possible dependence on the spectral states .",
    "here we estimated the burst luminosity at the surface of the neutron star as @xmath13 , where @xmath11 is the stefan  boltzmann constant , @xmath14 the distance to the source in the units of 10 kpc , @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the color temperature and normalization derived from the spectral fits with the xspec model `` bbodyrad '' , respectively .",
    "the factor @xmath17 represents the gravitational redshift correction at the surface of the neutron star .",
    "the result is shown in figure  [ number_l_fa ] .",
    "the distribution of @xmath0 differs significantly between the island and banana states : although both have a peak around 2.5 , the profile is much broader for the latter .",
    "the average @xmath0 for the island and the banana states are @xmath18 and @xmath19 , respectively . a kolmogorov ",
    "smirnov test shows that the possibility of having a consistent distribution of @xmath0 in the two spectral states is @xmath20 .    to have a clearer trend of the @xmath0 evolution against luminosity , we binned the points in figure  [ number_l_fa ] in a bin size of @xmath21 , and within each bin we calculated the weighted average of @xmath0 .",
    "the result is illustrated in figure  [ l_and_fa ] .",
    "the red and blue lines represent the weighted average for the bursts in the banana and island states , respectively .",
    "we found that the @xmath0 increases gradually with the burst luminosity in the banana state , which is consistent with the report of @xcite .",
    "however , the bursts in the island state show a very different behavior . when the burst luminosity is smaller than around @xmath22 the @xmath0 is similar to that in the banana state , otherwise the @xmath0 shows an opposite tendency , i.e. decreases with the increasing burst luminosity .",
    "as shown in figure  [ ccd ] , most of bursts in the island state are non - pre bursts , while in the banana state the pre bursts are appreciable . considering that the photosphere is lifted up when the burst luminosity reaches eddington limit , it is natural to speculate if the different behaviors as shown in figure  [ l_and_fa ] are caused by the photospheric expansion . to this end",
    "we calculatded the weight averaged @xmath0 for both the pre bursts and non - pre bursts .",
    "we note that there are no non - pre bursts having a luminosity larger than @xmath23 in the banana state .",
    "hence , the weight averaged @xmath0 in the banana state when the luminosity is larger than this value is actually the contribution from pre bursts .",
    "in addition , we found that in the island state there are 10 bright bursts ( five pre and five non - pre ) which have the peak luminosity larger than @xmath23 .",
    "we therefore calculated for both types their weight averaged @xmath0 and the result is shown in figure  [ l_and_fa ] lower panel .",
    "it is obvious that the overall trends are consistent for both types of bursts in the island .",
    "in this letter , we investigated the spectral deviations from a blackbody during type - i bursts in different spectral states .",
    "we found that these spectral deviations exist significantly in both of the banana and the island states . to study whether such deviations are derived from the scattering in the atmosphere of the neutron star as expected by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , we fitted the time - resolved spectra using a more accurate model burstatmo provided by suleimanov , during which the persistent flux was regarded as a constant .",
    "the result is shown in figure  [ standard _ chi ] . clearly , although the goodness of fit for burstatmo model seems to be better than the initial bbodyrad model , it is still not sufficient to account for the discrepancy for bursts in different spectral states .    technically , a variable persistent flux ( i.e. the @xmath0 model mentioned above @xcite ) can describe these spectral deviations successfully and improve the fit of burst spectrum .",
    "figure  [ standard _ chi ] indicates that @xmath0 component seems to be more significant in the banana state than what it is in the island state .",
    "further study has shown that the evolution of @xmath0 with increasing burst luminosity varies for bursts in different spectral states . in the banana state ,",
    "@xmath0 gradually increase with increasing burst luminosity . instead , in the island state , when the luminosity is larger than @xmath24 , @xmath0 decreases and this tendency is independent of the burst type .",
    "the similar phenomena of @xmath25 have been reported by @xcite and @xcite , respectively , and it is explained as an increased persistent flux . @xcite",
    "attributed it to the increased accretion due to the poynting - robertson effect .",
    "@xcite speculated instead that it is due to reprocessing of burst photons by the accretion disc and corona .",
    "neither of them considered the possibility of the decreased persistent emissions as illustrated in figure  [ l_and_fa ] .",
    "we notice that it might be too simple for the assumption in @xmath0 model , that the persistent spectral shape keeps unchanged during a burst .",
    "for example , by observing the khz quasi - periodic oscillations , @xcite suggested that some of the @xmath0 might be inaccurate for inferring the accretion rate .",
    "thus , it can not be ruled out that some fa are artificial ( e.g.fa < 0 ) .",
    "however , if the assumption in @xmath0 model does hold , our findings would imply that in the island state the persistent emission is enhanced in the weak bursts , but suppressed in the luminous bursts . on the contrary ,",
    "the persistent emission is always enhanced in those bursts born out of the banana state .    in theory",
    ", the radiation powered by the type - i bursts will have two important effects on the material orbiting the neutron star .",
    "one is to counteract gravity by transferring the radial momentum and the other is to exert a drag on the moving particles ( the so - called poynting - robertson effect ) .",
    "accordingly , the balance of these two opposite effects determines if accretion process will be suppressed or enhanced .",
    "if the latter is more important , more material will fall onto the neutron during bursts , and lead to an increased accretion rate ; while if the former is dominant , the material will be blown to infinity and become unbounded , resulting in a suppressed accretion process .",
    "the quantitative calculation has been carried out by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "they proved that during type - i bursts a test particle near the innermost stable circular orbit ( isco ) was likely to fall onto the central neutron star . on the contrary , when the particles are located at the outer part , say , at a distance of around 20 @xmath26 or more , they will be hurled out to infinity by a bright burst and be captured by a fainter burst ( for details , please see figure 5 from @xcite ) .",
    "their calculations can naturally explain phenomena that we found , if we assume spectral deviations arise from the interactions between the radiation field of type - i bursts and the accretion disc .",
    "according to the unified model proposed for outbursts in the low mass xrbs , a geometrically thin and optically thick accretion disc ( so called `` standard disc '' ) extends closer to the compact star in the banana state and is truncated at a larger radius in the island state , during which the corona or jets appear ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "although both the poynting - robertson effect and the radiation pressure diminish with the distance , the former is more sensitive . as a result ,",
    "the minimum luminosity required to eject out the material to infinite , is monotonically decreasing with the increasing distance @xcite .",
    "therefore , the feedback of bursts to the accretion process behaves as a function of the distance between the neutron star and the accretion disc .    in the banana state ,",
    "since the inner radius of the accretion disc is close to the neutron star , the poynting - robertson effect is overwhelming the radial radiation pressure , and leads to an increased accretion rate .",
    "while in the island state the accretion disc is truncated at an outer radius and the escape luminosity is relatively small , the particles in the accretion disc will be ejected out to infinity when bursts are luminous and be dragged onto the neutron star when bursts are less luminous .",
    "figure  [ l_and_fa ] lower panel shows that for the non - pre bursts the @xmath0 drops back to 1 at the luminosity @xmath27 , which corresponds to around 75% eddington luminosity . based on the figure 5 from @xcite",
    ", we can deduce that the innermost radius of the accretion disc in the island state is around 16 @xmath26 , where @xmath28 .",
