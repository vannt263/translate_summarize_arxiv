    "the large magnitude of elliptic flow , @xmath2 , in relativistic heavy - ion collisions at rhic  @xcite and lhc  @xcite has long been recognized as a signature of hydrodynamic behavior of the strongly - interacting quark - gluon plasma  @xcite .",
    "@xmath2 is understood as the hydrodynamic response to the initial anisotropy , @xmath3 , of the initial density profile  @xcite .",

    "this uncertainty hinders the extraction of the properties of the quark - gluon plasma from experimental data  @xcite .",
    "the statistical properties of anisotropic flow are now precisely known  @xcite .",
    "the atlas collaboration has analyzed the full probability distribution of @xmath2 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 in pb+pb collisions for several centrality windows  @xcite . in p+pb collisions",
    ", information is less detailed , but the first moments of the distribution of @xmath2 have been measured  @xcite . our goal is to make use of these measurements to separate the initial state from the response without assuming any particular model of the initial conditions  by only using a simple functional form which goes to zero at the geometric limits of @xmath6 and @xmath7 .    in theory , one can describe the particles emitted from a collision with an underlying probability distribution  @xcite .",
    "anisotropic flow , @xmath8 , is defined as the @xmath9 fourier coefficient of the azimuthal probability distribution @xmath10 : @xmath11 where we have used a complex notation  @xcite .",
    "note that the underlying probability distribution @xmath10 and @xmath12 fluctuate event to event , but they are both theoretical quantities which can not be measured on an event - by - event basis .",
    "the particles that are detected in an event represent a finite sample of @xmath10 , and the measurement of the probability distribution of @xmath8 involves a nontrivial unfolding of statistical fluctuations  @xcite .",
    "we assume that the fluctuations of @xmath8 for @xmath14 are due to fluctuations of the initial anisotropy @xmath13 in the corresponding harmonic , defined by  @xcite @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the energy density near midrapidity shortly after the collision , and @xmath17 are polar coordinates in the transverse plane , in a coordinate system where the energy distribution is centered at the origin .",
    "we assume for the moment that @xmath8 in a given event is determined by linear response to the initial anisotropy , @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is a response coefficient which does not fluctuate event to event .",
    "event - by - event hydrodynamic calculations  @xcite show that this is a very good approximation for @xmath14 . within this approximation",
    ", it has already been shown that one can rule out particular models of the initial density using either a combined analysis  @xcite of elliptic flow and triangular flow  @xcite data , or the relative magnitude of elliptic flow fluctuations  @xcite .",
    "our goal is to show that one can extract both @xmath19 and the distribution of @xmath13 from data .",
    "we hope to show that this is true even if we relax the linear assumption .",
    "we make use of the recent observation that the distribution of @xmath13 is to a large extent universal  @xcite and can be characterized by two parameters .",
    "both the magnitude and direction of @xmath20 fluctuate event to event .",
    "the simplest parametrization of these fluctuations is a two - dimensional gaussian probability distribution which , upon integration over azimuthal angle , yields the bessel - gaussian distribution  @xcite : @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the mean anisotropy in the reaction plane , which vanishes by symmetry for odd @xmath23 , and @xmath24 is the typical magnitude of eccentricity fluctuations around this mean anisotropy .",
    "both @xmath22 and @xmath24 depend on the harmonic @xmath23 .    in a previous publication  @xcite",
    ", we have introduced an alternative parametrization , the elliptic power distribution : @xmath25 where @xmath26 describes the fluctuations and is approximately proportional to the number of sources in an independent - source model  @xcite .",
    "the parameter @xmath26 depends on @xmath23 . when @xmath27 and @xmath28 , eq .",
    "( [ ellipticpower ] ) reduces to eq .",
    "( [ besselgaussian ] ) with @xmath29 .",
    "its support is the unit disk : it naturally takes into account the condition @xmath30 which follows from the definition , eq .",
    "( [ defepsilon ] ) . for this reason , it is a better parametrization than the bessel - gaussian , in particular for large anisotropies .",
    "( [ ellipticpower ] ) has been shown to fit various initial - state models  @xcite .",
    "note that @xmath22 is not strictly equal to the mean reaction plane eccentricity for the elliptic power distribution , but the difference is small for pb+pb collisions  @xcite .",
    "when the anisotropy is solely due to fluctuations , @xmath31 , the bessel - gaussian reduces to a gaussian distribution : @xmath32 and the elliptic power distribution reduces to the power distribution  @xcite : @xmath33",
    "the probability distribution of anisotropic flow , @xmath34 , is obtained from the distribution of the initial anisotropy @xmath35 by @xmath36 assuming @xmath18 , this becomes : @xmath37 in this case the distribution is rescaled by the response coefficient @xmath19 .",
    "figure  [ fig : atlasfits ] displays the probability distribution of @xmath2 and @xmath4 in various centrality windows  @xcite together with fits using rescaled bessel - gaussian and elliptic power distributions for @xmath2 , and rescaled gaussian and power distributions for @xmath4 . both parametrizations give very good fits to @xmath2 and @xmath4 data for the most central bins shown on the figure .",

    "] as the centrality percentile increases , however , the quality of the bessel - gaussian fit becomes increasingly worse , which is reflected by the large @xmath39 of the fit , and also clearly seen in the tail of the distribution : it systematically overestimates the distribution for large anisotropies . on the other hand",
    ", the elliptic power fit is excellent for all centralities . in particular",
    ", it falls off more steeply for large @xmath8 , in close agreement with the data .",
    "note that the bessel - gaussian distribution eq .",
    "( [ besselgaussian ] ) is scale invariant : rescaling it by @xmath19 amounts to multiplying both @xmath22 and @xmath24 by @xmath19 , so that the fit is degenerate : only the products @xmath40 and @xmath41 can be determined .",
    "therefore the bessel - gaussian fit to atlas data is in practice a 2-parameter fit for @xmath2 , and a 1-parameter fit for @xmath4 . on the other hand",
    ", the elliptic power fit is not degenerate because of the non - gaussian cut - off at @xmath42 , and returns both the response coefficient @xmath19 and the parameters pertaining to the shape , namely @xmath26 and @xmath22 ( for @xmath2 ) .",
    "however , the fit parameters are still correlated in the sense that the combinations @xmath43 and @xmath40 ( for @xmath2 ) have much smaller errors than each individual parameter .",
    "our ability to separate the response from the initial eccentricity thus lies in the difference between the bessel - gaussian and the elliptic power fits , that is , in the non - gaussianity of flow fluctuations .",
    "since the difference is small , errors must be carefully evaluated .",
    "the atlas collaboration reports the statistical error , the systematic error on the mean @xmath44 , and the systematic error on the relative standard deviation @xmath45 .",
    "the first systematic error is an error on the scale of the distribution , while the second is an error on its shape .",
    "the error on the scale directly translates into an error of the response coefficient @xmath19 , of the same relative magnitude . since our analysis uses the deviations from a gaussian shape , the dominant source of error is by far the error on the shape . in order to estimate the corresponding error on our fit parameters , we distort the distribution of @xmath8 in such a way that the mean @xmath46 is unchanged , and @xmath45 is increased or decreased by the experimental uncertainty",
    "this is done in practice by shifting the values of the @xmath8 bins according to @xmath47 , where @xmath48 is a small non - linear shift .",
    "we choose the ansatz @xmath49 , where @xmath50 is the tail of the @xmath8 distribution , @xmath51 is chosen in such a way that @xmath44 is unchanged , and @xmath52 is chosen in such a way that @xmath45 is increased or decreased by the systematic error .",

    "they are smaller than unity , with @xmath66 , in line with expectations from hydrodynamic calculations  @xcite , and decrease as a function of the centrality percentile , which is the general behavior expected from viscous corrections to local equilibrium  @xcite .",
    "we estimate that the low-@xmath67 cut of atlas at 0.5  gev increases @xmath54 by a factor 1.4 to 1.5 .",
    "the systematic error for @xmath53 is very large and therefore not shown : for most bins , the upper error bar goes all the way to infinity .",
    "now , if one takes the limit @xmath68 while keeping the rms @xmath4 constant , @xmath26 in eq .",
    "( [ power ] ) also goes to infinity and the power distribution reduces to a gaussian distribution eq .",
    "( [ vngaussian ] ) . therefore the atlas @xmath4 distributions are compatible with gaussians within systematic errors .        the other parameters of the fit to @xmath8 distributions , namely , @xmath22 and @xmath26 , characterize the shape of the distribution .",
    "they are displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : eps0alpha ] as a function of the collision centrality .",
    "@xmath22 increases smoothly with the centrality percentile : extrapolation to the most central collisions ( where the fit does not converge ) gives @xmath31 , as required by azimuthal symmetry .",
    "figure  [ fig : eps0alpha ] also displays comparisons with the glauber  @xcite and ip - glasma  @xcite models . these models are shown as shaded bands .",
    "the bands correspond to the fact that the elliptic power distribution does not exactly fit the distribution of @xmath3 for that particular model . specifically , the dashed line at the edge of the band is the value returned by a 2-parameter elliptic power fit to the distribution of @xmath3 .",
    "the full line at the other edge of the band is the value that the fit to the @xmath2 distribution would return if @xmath69 , with @xmath3 given by that model .",
    "if one assumes linear response , atlas data deviate from both models .",
    "for p+pb collisions , the full distribution of @xmath2 has not been measured , but only its first cumulants  @xcite @xmath70 and @xmath71  @xcite .",
    "assuming linear response to the initial eccentricity , each measured cumulant is proportional to the corresponding cumulant of the initial eccentricity  @xcite , @xmath72 , for @xmath73 ... the eccentricity in p+pb collisions is solely due to fluctuations  @xcite , therefore eqs .",

    "( [ vngaussian ] ) , the power distribution eq .",
    "( [ power ] ) always gives @xmath74  @xcite .",
    "we again use this non - gaussianity to disentangle the initial state from the response : we extract @xmath26 from the measured ratio @xmath75  @xcite .",
    "the rms anisotropy is then obtained as @xmath76  @xcite .",
    "one finally obtains for the power distribution : @xmath77 the values of @xmath54 extracted from cms p+pb data  @xcite using this equation are also displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : kappa ] . we multiply them by a factor @xmath78 to correct for the different low-@xmath67 cut ( @xmath79  gev/@xmath80 ) assuming a linear dependence of @xmath2 on @xmath67 .",

    "general arguments have been put forward which suggest that the hydrodynamic response should be identical for p+pb and pb+pb at the same equivalent centrality  @xcite . once rescaled , the p+pb slope is in line with pb+pb results , albeit somewhat steeper .",
    "note that the fit parameters can also be obtained from cumulants for @xmath4 in pb+pb collisions using eq .",
    "( [ kappa_ppb ] ) . for @xmath2 , there is a third parameter @xmath22 , therefore one needs a third cumulant @xmath81 . @xmath26 and @xmath22 , which control the shape of the distribution and its non - gaussian features ,",

    "we have checked that @xmath26 and @xmath22 thus extracted from cumulant ratios are essentially identical to those obtained by fitting the distribution of @xmath2 .",
    "this approach has the advantage that cumulants can be analyzed without any unfolding procedure  @xcite but @xmath70 may suffer from non - flow effects .",
    "we now discuss the effect of deviations from linear eccentricity scaling of anisotropic flow . because of such deviations ,",
    "the shape of the @xmath8 distribution is not exactly the same as that of the @xmath13 distribution , as already noted in event - by - event hydrodynamic calculations  @xcite .",
    "there are two distinct types of non - linearities : @xmath8 can be a function of @xmath13 which is not exactly linear , or @xmath8 can depend on properties of the initial state other than @xmath13 .",
    "we study these effects in turn .    adding",
    "a quadratic term would be equivalent to rotating the distribution 90 degrees or changing the sign of @xmath8 .",
    "thus the first significant non - linear term is the cubic : @xmath86 several hydrodynamic calculations show evidence that @xmath87  @xcite , but no quantitative analysis has been done yet .",
    "one typically expects @xmath55 to depend mildly on centrality . when fitting the experimental @xmath2 distributions with the added parameter of the cubic term , @xmath55 had large errors but was in the range from 0 to 0.15 .",
    "thus we fixed @xmath55 at 0.10 and plotted the @xmath54 values also in fig .",
    "[ fig : kappa ] .",
    "the effect of the non - linear response is to reduce the linear response coefficient @xmath54 , essentially by a constant factor . in the case where the distribution of @xmath88 is the power distribution ( [ power ] ) and in the limit @xmath28 ,",

    "( [ kappa_ppb ] ) and using the approximate relation @xmath90 for @xmath28 . ] with the elliptic - power distribution , the relative effect is also @xmath91 as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : kappa ] . note that this non - linear correction to the response is much larger than one would naively expect from eq .",
    "( [ cubic ] ) : the relative magnitude of the cubic term @xmath92 , yet it produces an effect of order @xmath55 .",
    "the reason is that the non - linear response contributes to the non - gaussianity of flow fluctuations .",
    "we now discuss deviations from linearity due to the fact that @xmath8 is not entirely determined by @xmath13  @xcite .",
    "one can generally decompose the flow as @xmath93 , where @xmath94 is uncorrelated with the initial eccentricity @xmath20 .",
    "there can be various contributions to @xmath94 from non - linear coupling between different harmonics  @xcite or radial modulations of the initial density  @xcite . in order to estimate their effect on the hydrodynamic response",
    ", we further assume that @xmath94 is a gaussian noise .",
    "then , the distribution of @xmath12 is a rescaled elliptic - power distribution , convoluted with a gaussian : the deviation from linearity here results in a gaussian smearing of the distribution .",
    "a quantitative measure of the magnitude of @xmath94 is the pearson correlation coefficient @xmath95 between the anisotropic flow and the initial anisotropy , defined as @xmath96 where angular brackets denote an average value over events in a centrality class .",
    "our analysis assumes the maximum correlation , @xmath97 .",
    "event - by - event hydrodynamic calculations show that there are small deviations around eccentricity scaling  @xcite .",
    "ideal hydrodynamics  @xcite gives @xmath98 for elliptic flow .",
    "however , the correlation between @xmath8 and @xmath13 has been shown to be significantly larger in viscous hydrodynamics  @xcite , and a value @xmath99 seems reasonable , but there is to date no quantitative estimate of @xmath100 as defined in eq .",
    "( [ pearson ] ) .    the effect on the fit parameters can be obtained using the fact that the rms flow @xmath101 is increased by the noise , while higher - order cumulants @xmath102 and @xmath103 ( see below sec .  [",
    "sec : cum ] ) are unchanged .",
    "we find that a decrease of @xmath100 by 1% results in an decrease of the extracted @xmath54 by 6% to 9% , depending on the centrality , the effect being maximum in the 20 - 30% centrality range .",
    "the value of @xmath100 found in ideal hydrodynamic calculations  @xcite depends mildly on centrality and is closest to 1 also in the 20 - 30% centrality range .",
    "therefore one can conjecture this should eventually be confirmed by detailed calculations that the effect of the noise @xmath94 is to reduce the extracted response essentially by a constant factor , independent of centrality .",
    "note that the cubic response in eq .",
    "( [ cubic ] ) does not contribute to @xmath104 to first order in @xmath55 , so that the two effects are in practice well separated .",
    "the conclusion is that deviations from linear eccentricity scaling all make @xmath54 smaller , by a factor which can be significant , but depends little on centrality .",
    "this is of crucial importance for the extraction of the viscosity over entropy ratio ( see below ) .",
    "the decrease in @xmath54 makes @xmath22 larger and @xmath26 smaller ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : eps0alpha ] ) , thereby improving compatibility with existing initial - state models .",
    "we now compare our result for @xmath54 with hydrodynamic calculations . to the extent that anisotropic flow scales linearly with eccentricity ,",
    "the value of the response coefficient @xmath54 is independent of initial conditions . in ideal hydrodynamics ,",
    "scale invariance implies that @xmath54 is independent of the system size , i.e. , independent of centrality .",
    "deviations from thermal equilibrium generally result in a reduction of the flow which is stronger for peripheral collisions  @xcite . in a hydrodynamic calculation",
    "@xcite , such deviations are due to the shear viscosity  @xcite and , to a lesser extent , to the freeze - out procedure at the end of the hydrodynamic expansion . therefore the dependence of @xmath54 on centrality in fig .  [",
    "fig : kappa ] can be used to estimate the shear viscosity over entropy ratio @xmath1 of the quark - gluon plasma .",
    "we use the same hydrodynamic code as in ref .",

    "the smooth solid lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : kappa ] are obtained with @xmath57 .",
    "the dashed lines show the sensitivity to @xmath1 .",
    "this extracted value of @xmath57 is consistent with that reported in the literature  @xcite , using specific models of the initial state . for sake of illustration",
    ", we also show the result for @xmath53 with the same @xmath1 and the same overall normalization factor as for @xmath54 .",
    "we recall that systematic errors on @xmath53 from experimental data are very large so that no conclusion on @xmath1 can be drawn from these data alone .",
    "we have shown that a rescaled elliptic power distribution fits the measured distributions of elliptic and triangular flows in pb+pb collisions at the lhc .",
    "these distributions become increasingly non - gaussian as the anisotropy increases .",
    "we have used this non - gaussianity to disentangle for the first time the initial anisotropy from the response without assuming any particular model of initial conditions  just using a simple functional form which meets the geometrical constrants of eccentricity .",
    "this is another aspect of the analogy between heavy - ion physics and cosmology  @xcite , where initial quantum fluctuations give rise to correlations , and the non - gaussian statistics of these correlations can be used to unravel the properties of the initial state  @xcite .",
    "the non - gaussianity is stronger for smaller systems , which is an incentive to analyze flow in smaller collision systems .",
    "we have found that the hydrodynamic response to ellipticity has the expected overall magnitude and centrality dependence : it decreases with centrality percentage .",
    "a somewhat similar slope is found for p+pb collisions .",
    "this decrease can be attributed to the viscous suppression of @xmath2 .",
    "comparison with hydrodynamic calculations supports a low value of the viscosity over entropy ratio , @xmath105 .",
