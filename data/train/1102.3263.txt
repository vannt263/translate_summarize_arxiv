    "it is generally believed that the strongly interacting matter exhibits a rich phase structure in extreme environment such as at high temperature and high baryon chemical potential .",
    "experimentally , rhic ( relativistic heavy ion collider ) and lhc ( large hadron collider ) may provide more information on this topics .",
    "theoretically , some results have been already obtained on a sound basis : first , the lattice simulations of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) indicate that , for physical quark masses , the transition from the hadronic phase to the quark gluon plasma ( qgp ) is a smooth crossover at finite temperature and vanishing baryon chemical potential  @xcite , whereas in the low temperature and very high density region , the techniques of perturbation qcd can be used and the color flavor locking ( cfl )  @xcite phase is proved to be the ground state of qcd  @xcite .    however , the above methods based on the first principle fail at the low temperature and moderate density region , due to the sign problem or the non - perturbative effect .",
    "phenomenologically , such a region in the @xmath1-@xmath2 plane is more relevant to reality and hence interesting since it is directly related to the physics of compact stars . on that account ,",
    "chiral models of qcd such as the njl model  @xcite that embody the basic low - energy characteristics of qcd such as symmetry properties have been extensively used to explore the @xmath1-@xmath2 phase diagram of strongly interacting matter .",
    "in particular , such model calculations suggest that csc phase may occur at low temperature and large chemical potential ( for reviews , see  @xcite ) . in addition , a popular result from the model studies is that the chiral phase transition always keeps first order at the low - temperature region  @xcite . combined with the crossover transition confirmed by lattice qcd at zero baryon chemical potential , usually , a schematic @xmath1-@xmath2 phase diagram with one chiral critical point(cp ) is widely adopted in the literature  @xcite .",
    "such a cp may be located at relatively high temperature and low baryon chemical potential , which has attracted considerable attention as it is potentially detectable in heavy - ion experiments  @xcite .",
    "generally , there is no reason to rule out the possibility that the qcd phase diagram may contain more than one chiral cp , especially when the chiral and diquark condensates are considered simultaneously ; some rich structures with multiple cp s may be expected for the phase diagram owing to somehow enhanced interplay between the two types of condensates .",
    "it has been shown on the basis of the njl model that it is indeed the case  @xcite ; the qcd phase diagram can admit multiple cp s when the repulsive vector interaction  @xcite or the charge - neutrality and @xmath0-equilibrium  @xcite or both of these two ingredients  @xcite are included .",
    "this is because the two ingredients act so as to enhance the competition between the chiral and diquark condensates and thus the would - be first - order boundary line in the low - temperature region of the @xmath1-@xmath2 plane can be turned into a smooth crossover or multiply - cut crossover lines with new cp ( s ) .",
    "indeed it has been found  @xcite that the number of the chiral cp s may vary from zero to four with the joint effect of these two ingredients .",
    "moreover , the present authors have shown  @xcite that the vector interaction can effectively suppress the chromomagnetic instability @xcite in the asymmetric homogeneous csc phase .",
    "it is noteworthy that a direct coupling term between the chiral and diquark condensates can be supplied by the axial anomaly  @xcite , which thus might lead to a new cp in the low - temperature region , as first conjectured in  @xcite on the basis of an analysis using the ginzburg - landau ( gl ) theory in the chiral limit ; see also subsequent detailed analyses  @xcite though still in the chiral limit .",
    "it is , however , to be noted that the gl theory assumes that both the diquark and chiral condensates are sufficiently small around the phase boundaries provided that the phase transitions are of second - order .",
    "in addition , the gl theory itself can not determine the coefficients in the action , and some microscopic model or theory is necessary for such a determination .",
    "recently , a microscopic calculation has been done  @xcite with use of a three - flavor njl model for massive quarks incorporating the axial anomaly term with a form of a six - quark interaction  @xcite , the coupling constant of which is denoted by @xmath3 : it was claimed in  @xcite that the low - temperature cp can exist owing to the axial anomaly for an appropriate range of the model parameters even off the chiral limit but still with a flavor symmetry as in the gl approach in the chiral limit .",
    "it should be noticed , however , that the su(3)-flavor symmetry may lead to a special type of csc phase , i.e. , the cfl phase , as is taken for granted in @xcite , which automatically satisfies the charge - neutrality and @xmath0-equilibrium constraints .",
    "then one may suspect that the possible emergence of the new cp might be an artifact of such an ideal situation with the three - flavor symmetry . nevertheless , it is a very interesting possibility that the axial anomaly - induced interplay between the chiral and diquark condensates would lead to a new cp in the low - temperature region .",
    "thus it is worth exploring to see whether a new low - temperature cp is induced by the axial anomaly in a dynamical model of qcd by considering the realistic situation with the broken flavor symmetry by the hierarchical current quark masses.we note that once the quark mass difference of different flavors is taken into account , it becomes a complicated dynamical problem to make the charge - neutrality and @xmath0-equilibrium constraints satisfied .",
    "more recently , such a realistic calculation in the framework of a two - plus - one - flavor njl model has been done by basler et al .",
    "@xcite ; they have shown that such a new low - temperature cp is not found in such a model even with the axial anomaly term , because an unusual interplay between the chiral and diquark condensates induced by the anomaly term actually leads favorably to the 2csc phase  @xcite rather than the cfl phase near the chiral phase boundary , even in the case with the equal quark mass limit  @xcite .",
    "it is worth emphasizing here that the constraints by the charge - neutrality and @xmath0-equilibrium are not taken into consideration in @xcite nor @xcite in contrast to @xcite where various types of multiple - cp structures are found in the phase diagram .",
    "thus the following two questions arise naturally : will the results found in @xcite be altered or not when the charge - neutrality and @xmath0-equilibrium constraints and/or the vector interaction are taken into account ? or will the phase structure with multiple cp s found in  @xcite rather persist when taking into account the coupling between the chiral and diquark condensates induced by such a six - quark interaction ?",
    "the main purpose of this paper is to answer these questions by incorporating the anomaly term that breaks the @xmath4 symmetry as well as the vector interaction under the constraints of the charge - neutrality and @xmath0-equilibrium in the two - plus - one - flavor njl model .",
    "the present work may be regarded as either an extension of the paper  @xcite by incorporating the charge - neutrality , @xmath0-equilibrium and the vector interaction , or an extension of the paper  @xcite by including the @xmath3-interaction .",
    "the main conclusion we reach is that the key results on the phase structure obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite persist even when the attractive @xmath3-interaction is incorporated .",
    "that is , there appear new cp ( s ) at the intermediate temperature owing to charge - neutrality constraint and then the transition in the low temperature region extending to zero @xmath1 becomes a crossover when the strength of the vector interaction becomes larger than a critical value : thus the number of the cp s can be even more than two , depending on the values of some related coupling constants . strikingly enough",
    ", we find that the interplay between the chiral and the diquark condensates induced by the anomaly term even acts toward realizing the multi - cp structure of the phase diagram under the neutrality and @xmath0-equilibrium constraints even without the help of the vector interaction .",
    "accordingly , the results in ref .",
    "@xcite are modified by considering these constraints .",
    "even though the chiral boundary in the low-@xmath1 region extending to zero @xmath1 also remains first order in our case in the absence of the vector interaction , which shrinks and vanishes eventually as @xmath3 becomes large and exceeds a critical value .",
    "we shall also examine the chromomagnetic ( in)stability under the influence of the axial anomaly , as was done in @xcite .",
    "it is well known that the asymmetric homogenous 2csc phase suffers from the chromomagnetic instability . at zero temperature",
    ", the calculation based on the hard - dense - loop ( hdl ) method  @xcite suggests that the meissner mass squared of the 8th gluon becomes negative for @xmath5 while the 4th-7th gluons acquire negative meissner masses squared for @xmath6 ; here @xmath7 and @xmath8 denote the difference of the chemical potentials of u and d quarks and the gap , respectively . note that @xmath9 is just equal to a half of the electron chemical potential @xmath10 when the vector interaction is absent , and this quantity is to be replaced by an effective chemical potential @xmath11 ( see below ) when the vector interaction is present , as shown in @xcite .",
    "the instability of the asymmetric homogenous csc phase should imply the existence of a yet unknown but stable phase in this region of the @xmath1-@xmath2 plane .",
    "candidates of such a stable phase include the larkin - ovchinnikov - fulde - ferrel ( loff ) phase @xcite and gluonic phase @xcite . besides developing the possible new phases ,",
    "the instability problem may also be totally or partially gotten rid of by some other mechanisms .",
    "for instance , the instability problem becomes less severe simply at finite temperature because the smeared fermi surface relaxes the mismatch of the fermi spheres of the asymmetric quark matter @xcite .",
    "furthermore , it is known that the larger the quark mass and the stronger the diquark coupling , more suppressed the instability even at zero temperature@xcite .",
    "recently , the present authors@xcite have shown that the repulsive vector interaction can also resolve the instability problem totally or partially .",
    "the stability by the vector interaction is realized due to the following two ingredients : ( 1 )  the density difference between the u and d quarks reduces the mismatch in the effective chemical potentials ; ( 2 )  the nonzero vector interaction suppresses the formation of high density and hence larger quark masses than those obtained without the interaction are realized .",
    "we shall show that the new anomaly term play a quite similar role as the vector interaction and the interplay between the chiral and diquark condensates induced by the anomaly term acts toward suppressing the unstable region of the homogeneous 2csc phase in the @xmath1-@xmath2 plane ; the neutral 2csc phase can become even free from the chromomagnetic instability if @xmath3 is larger than a critical value @xmath12 , which can be reduced significantly when the vector interaction is incorporated .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec.ii , the two - plus - one - flavor njl model with the extended flavor - mixing six - quark interaction",
    "is introduced under the constraints of the charge - neutrality and @xmath0-equilibrium .",
    "the phase diagram of the neutral strongly interacting matter with the influence of the axial anomaly is presented in sec.iii .",
    "sec.iv focuses on the role of the axial anomaly on the chromomagnetic ( in)stability .",

    "@xmath3 intensifies the competition between the chiral and diquark condensates due to the enhanced effective diquark - diquark interaction .",

    "consequently , the coe region tends to be more easily formed when both @xmath10 and @xmath3 take effects .",
    "therefore the chiral transition is significantly weakened and the smooth crossover gets to appear with new cp s in the intermediate temperature owing to the abnormal thermal behavior of the diquark condensate .",
    "the @xmath1-dependence of @xmath119 and @xmath11 for fixed @xmath81 and several values of @xmath2 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : abnormal1 ] .",
    "one can see that , with increasing @xmath1 , the constituent quark masses decrease persistently while the majarona mass for csc first increases , has the maximum value and then decreases in the coe region and nearby .",
    "let us see the details for each value of @xmath2 .",
    "for a small @xmath107 mev , the diquark pairing is weak and the gap @xmath8 does not appear at lower temperature region . thus the chiral phase transition keeps the nature of the first order at @xmath120 mev . at a lager @xmath121 mev , the diquark pairing becomes significant and the @xmath8 shows the abnormal thermal behavior with a maximum value around @xmath122 mev , and hence the chiral phase transition turns to a smooth crossover owing to the competition with the diquark condensate in the coe region .",
    "for even larger @xmath123 mev , the diquark pairing becomes more significant and the @xmath8 still shows the abnormal thermal behavior .",
    "however , the competition between the two condensates is not strong enough to qualitatively change the nature of the chiral restoration and a first order transition happens at @xmath124 mev .",
    "the reason why the crossover does not occur at @xmath123 mev but happens at @xmath121 mev can be understood as follows : starting from the same point ( @xmath125 , @xmath121 mev ) in the coe region , an increase of @xmath1 affects the nature of the chiral transition more significantly than that of @xmath2 does , since @xmath126 .",
    "we have seen that the abnormal thermal behavior of the gap @xmath8 plays an essential role in realizing the multi - cp structure of the phase diagram .",
    "such an unusual @xmath1-dependence of the @xmath8 can be attributed to the following two mechanisms : ( i )  the mismatch between the chemical potentials of u and d quarks owing to the charge - neutrality and @xmath0-equilibrium constraints and ( ii )  the small fermi spheres of the quarks in the coe region due to the relatively large quark masses : first , the difference in the chemical potentials @xmath11 or the mismatch of the fermi momenta disfavors the u - d pairing at zero or small temperature . however , as the temperature is raised in the low-@xmath1 region , more and more u and d quarks tends to participate in the pairing due to the smearing of the fermi surfaces , especially that of the u quark .",
    "of course , when @xmath1 is raised too much , the pairing will be gradually destroyed .",
    "thus the @xmath8 will have the maximum value at a finite @xmath1 and then disappears eventually when @xmath1 is further raised .",
    "these dual effects of the temperature on the diquark pairing lead to the abnormal behavior of the @xmath8 .",
    "this behavior becomes more prominent in the 2csc phase for a weak diquark coupling @xcite or in the coe region for a moderate or strong diquark coupling @xcite .",
    "second , when @xmath1 is raised , the dynamical quark masses decrease and hence the fermi spheres or momenta of u and d quarks grow significantly for a fixed @xmath2 , which means that the density of states at the fermi surface increases with @xmath1 , and thus the diquark pairing is enhanced in the coe region . the increased diquark condensates in turn tend to further suppress the dynamical quark masses .",
    "notice that such an increase of the diquark condensate along with increasing @xmath1 is expected to be most prominent around the phase boundary of the chiral transition , including the coe region , where the chiral condensates change most significantly .",
    "for the neutral 2csc , once the coe is formed , both of these mechanisms take effects simultaneously and are mutually enhanced , and thus the formation of the multiple - cp structure is readily made .",
    "this may explain why no intermediate - temperature cp is realized in ref .",
    "@xcite where the chiral - diquark interplay is embodied by the anomaly term but without the charge - neutrality and @xmath0-equilibrium constraints ; the anomaly term solely is insufficient for realizing the abnormal thermal behavior of the @xmath8 .",
    "it should be stressed that the mechanism for the emergence of the intermediate - temperature cp s in fig .",
    "[ fig : pdzerogv]b is apparently similar to that in the two - flavor case found in  @xcite .",
    "however , the strange quark plays an important role in the present case since the chiral condensate of the strange quark contributes positively to the effective diquark - diquark coupling for u and d quarks through the axial anomaly . we should stress that apart from the appearance of intermediate - temperature cp s , there is a common feature with and without charge - neutrality constraint : the chiral transition in the low-@xmath1 region extending zero temperature keeps first order provided that @xmath3 does not exceed a critical value at which the first - order line completely disappears .",
    "last but not least , we remark that the @xmath1-@xmath2 region where the two new low - temperature cp s are located in fig .  [",

    "tells us that the u - d diquark coupling is enhanced by the presence of the s quark chiral condensate due to the coupling between the chiral and diquark condensates induced by the @xmath3 term . on the other hand ,",
    "as was first shown in @xcite through changing the diquark coupling by hand , the chromomagnetic instability tends to be suppressed in the strong coupling region and can be completely gotten rid of when the diquark coupling is strong enough . thus we see that the coupling between the u - d diquark and the chiral s - quark condensates by the @xmath3 term leads to the suppression of the chromomagnetic instability .",
    "this is a new mechanism of the stabilization of the gapless 2csc phase , found in the present work .",
    "we here emphasize the important role of the strange quark and the anomaly term in suppressing the instability : in contrast to the pure two - flavor case , the rather large chiral condensate of the strange quark enhances the diquark coupling between the u and d quarks owing to the axial anomaly in the two - plus - one flavor case , and this enhancement of the diquark coupling causes the stabilization .",
    "due to their common effects on the chromomagnetic ( in)stability , fig.[fig : unstable - stable ] suggests that the instability may be totally cured in the asymmetric homogeneous 2csc phase when the coupling constants of the vector interaction and the extended six - quark interaction are in an appropriate range .",
    "admittedly , the present work has only dealt with the case of the so called intermediate diquark coupling .",
    "nevertheless , for a weaker diquark coupling , it is expected that the system can be still free from the chromomagnetic instability only with larger couplings for both the vector interaction and the anomaly @xmath3-term .",
    ", the unstable region with the chromomagnetic instability in the @xmath1-@xmath2 plane shrinks and eventually vanishes . ]",
    "( a )    , the unstable region with the chromomagnetic instability in the @xmath1-@xmath2 plane shrinks and eventually vanishes . ]",
    "we have explored the phase structure and the chromomagnetic instability of the strongly interacting matter under the charge - neutrality constraint within a two - plus - one - flavor njl model by incorporating a new anomaly term as well as the conventional kmt interaction .",
    "the anomaly terms have the forms of six - quark interactions and violate the @xmath4 symmetry as a reflection of the axial anomaly of qcd . similarly to the kmt term , the new anomaly interaction with the coupling constant @xmath3 also induces a flavor - mixing which leads to a direct coupling between the chiral and diquark condensates .",
    "we first investigated the role of the axial anomaly on the emergence of the low or intermediate - temperature cp ( s ) without the vector interaction .",
    "owing to the large strange quark mass , the favored csc phase near the chiral boundary is 2csc rather than cfl , where the electric chemical potential @xmath10 required by the charge - neutrality plays an important role on the chiral phase transition @xcite .",
    "the once - declared low - temperature cp in the symmetric three - flavor limit @xcite was ruled out in ref .",
    "@xcite due to the actual dominance of the 2csc over the cfl .",
    "we have shown that this is true under charge - neutrality constraint without the vector interaction ; the chiral transition in the low-@xmath1 region extending zero temperature keeps first order provided that @xmath3 does not exceed a critical value at which the first - order line completely disappears .",
    "however , the new chiral anomaly term enhances the competition between the chiral and diquark condensates under charge - neutrality constraint , and gives rise to the intermediate - temperature cp s for an appropriate range of @xmath3 .",
    "no such intermediate - temperature cp s had been found in the same model when only either the charge - neutrality constraint or the axial anomaly is exclusively included , as shown in @xcite and @xcite ; both of which did not take into account the vector interaction , either .",
    "we then investigated the @xmath1-@xmath2 phase diagram by incorporating the repulsive vector interaction as well : we remark that this task may be viewed as an extension of the work @xcite , in which the effect of the vector interaction on the phase diagram is fully explored under the charge - neutrality constraint , to incorporate the anomaly term .",
    "we have found that the cubic coupling between the chiral and diquark condensates induced by the axial anomaly does not affect the qualitative results obtained in @xcite .",
    "rather , the vector interaction and the anomaly term jointly act so that the multiple cp s are realized .",
    "indeed , by varying @xmath3 with fixed vector coupling or vise verse , we have shown that all the types of multiple - cp structures obtained in @xcite can be reproduced .",
    "in particular , the phase transition in the low-@xmath1 region extending zero temperature becomes a crossover only when the vector interaction is present with a strength larger than a critical value .",
    "furthermore , the maximum number of the cp s can reach as large as five when both the interactions are put on . in this case , the low- and intermediate - temperature cp s can appear even with small values of @xmath3 owing to the help by the vector interaction .",
    "this is very welcome because @xmath3 in the realistic situation at moderate and high density should be weaker than that in the vacuum , since the anomaly term is supposed to originate from the instanton configuration which is expected to be suppressed at finite density .",
    "besides the influence on the chiral phase transition , we have shown that the axial anomaly also plays an important role on the suppression of the chromomagnetic instability for the asymmetric homogenous 2csc phase , which is first disclosed in the present work : with an increase of the extended six - quark interaction , the @xmath1-@xmath2 region with the chromomagnetic instability shrinks and eventually vanishes when the coupling @xmath3 is sufficiently large .",
    "in particular , when taking into account the vector interaction simultaneously , the chromomagnetic instability is suppressed more significantly and can be completely gotten rid of by the axial anomaly .",
    "a general and remarkable message obtained from the present investigation is that the strange quark can significantly affect the properties of the neutral strongly interacting matter in which the 2csc phase with u - d pairing is realized : even though the strange quark does not directly participate in the cooper pairing in the 2csc , the interplay between the u - d diquark condensate and the strange chiral condensate induced by the anomaly term can lead to drastically different phase structure in the @xmath1-@xmath2 plane under charge - neutrality constraint .",
    "it should be remarked here that the contribution of other possible cubic flavor - mixing terms composed of different condensates , such as @xmath150 which arise from another type of six - quark interaction @xmath151 are all neglected in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : omega2 ] ) for simplicity .",
    "the interaction  ( [ eqn : lagrangian5 ] ) can be derived from the kmt interaction , which may or may not affect the phase structure . beside their direct contribution to the thermodynamic potential , these flavor - mixing terms also modify the dispersion relations of the quasi - quarks : for example , the dynamical quark mass becomes dependent on the quark - number density through the term @xmath152 .",
    "it is certainly an interesting problem to explore the possible effects of these cubic coupling terms on the phase diagram , we leave such a task to a future work .",
    "even apart from the neglect of the above vertex ( [ eqn : lagrangian5 ] ) , there are some caveats with the present study based on a chiral model that does not embody the confinement effect , and is relied on the mean - field approximation .",
    "the results obtained in the current study are largely parameter dependent and bears the shortcomings inherent in the mean - field approximation .",
    "for instance , the result that there can be multiple cp s associated with the chiral transition and the csc actually may merely mean that the qcd matter is very soft for a simultaneous formation of the diquark and chiral condensates coupled with the baryonic density along the phase boundary .",
    "of course , a study which incorporates these fluctuations should be performed , say , by means of the nonperturbative / functional renormalization group method@xcite with the present model used as a bare model .",
    "more profoundly , the effect of the confinement should be incorporated even in an effective model approach , which is a more challenging problem since the mechanism of confinement is still unclear . anyway , further studies based on different models and/or methods are needed to determine whether the low - temperature cp ( s ) exists .",
    "one of the tasks of future is exploring whether the low - temperature cp ( s ) persists or not when the inhomogeneous phases are taken into consideration such as the chiral crystalline phase @xcite or the loff phase @xcite .",

    "<S> we investigate effects of the axial anomaly term with a chiral - diquark coupling on the phase diagram within a two - plus - one - flavor nambu - jona - lasinio ( njl ) model under the charge - neutrality and @xmath0-equilibrium constraints . </S>",
    "<S> we find that when such constraints are imposed , the new anomaly term plays a quite similar role as the vector interaction does on the phase diagram , which the present authors clarified in a previous work . </S>",
    "<S> thus , there appear several types of phase structures with multiple critical points at low temperature @xmath1 , although the phase diagrams with intermediate-@xmath1 critical point(s ) are never realized without these constraints even within the same model lagrangian . </S>",
    "<S> this drastic change is attributed to an enhanced interplay between the chiral and diquark condensates due to the anomaly term at finite temperature ; the u - d diquark coupling is strengthened by the relatively large chiral condensate of the strange quark through the anomaly term , which in turn definitely leads to the abnormal behavior of the diquark condensate at finite @xmath1 , inherent to the asymmetric quark matter . </S>",
    "<S> we note that the critical point from which the crossover region extends to zero temperature appears only when the strength of the vector interaction is larger than a critical value . </S>",
    "<S> we also show that the chromomagnetic instability of the neutral asymmetric homogenous two - flavor color superconducting(2csc ) phase is suppressed and can be even completely cured by the enhanced diquark coupling due to the anomaly term and/or by the vector interaction . </S>"
