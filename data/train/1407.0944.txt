    "the impact of the environment on quantum entanglement is manifold . on the one hand , an initial entanglement between independent systems , can be destroyed by their coupling to their surroundings .",
    "this fragility of quantum entanglement is substantiated by the fact that it can vanish in finite time , as first shown for two - level atoms in distinct vacuum cavities @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the environment mediates interactions , hamiltonian or not , between the considered systems , and can then induce correlations between them , and hence potentially entanglement .",
    "it has been shown that finite entanglement can develop between two initially uncorrelated two - level systems , or qubits , sharing the same surroundings , but otherwise uncoupled @xcite . however , in the realistic case of a finite separation between the two systems , this effect is only transient if the environment is in thermal equilibrium @xcite .",
    "this is not the case when the surroundings does not reduce to a thermal bath .",
    "the systems steady state , reached asymptotically from any initial state , can present finite entanglement , as has been shown for two qubits in diverse environments , such as the electromagnetic vacuum and a resonant laser field @xcite , two heat reservoirs at different temperatures @xcite , and the electromagnetic field emitted by two bodies at different temperatures @xcite . the entanglement obtained in these works , can be essentially traced back to one of the two familiar features of a pair of infinitely close qubits , which are , the decoupling , from the environment , of the so - called subradiant state , and the divergent energy shifts of the single - excitation levels @xcite .",
    "experimentally , transient entanglement of two atoms has been generated using the rydberg blockade mechanism , which relies on similar dipole - dipole energy shifts , but of double - excitation levels @xcite .",
    "another approach consists in starting with multi - level atoms coupled to one or several monochromatic fields , and possibly to static fields or to a common cavity mode , and then reducing them to two - level systems by adiabatic elimination of upper levels in an appropriate regime @xcite . following the proposal of ref.@xcite ,",
    "long - lived entanglement of two atomic ensembles separated by 50 cm , has been observed experimentally @xcite .    in this paper , we are concerned with the entanglement generated by a resonant laser field in an atomic ensemble . entangled steady states of systems of many driven qubits",
    "have been obtained for highly simplified interaction models , in which each qubit is coupled identically to every other one @xcite , or is coupled only to its nearest neighbours in a chain @xcite .",

    "lehmberg s master equation is used to describe the dynamics of the atoms internal state @xcite . for two atoms , the resulting steady",
    "state is separable or entangled , depending on the relative strength of the laser amplitude and vacuum - mediated interaction @xcite .",
    "we focus on the regime of low laser intensities , in which entanglement is long - range . as we will see , the underlying physical origin of the found entanglement , is that , for weak laser fields , the atoms internal dynamics is dominated by the dipole - dipole interaction , laser photon absorption and collective radiative decay , which all preserve the state purity . as a result ,",
