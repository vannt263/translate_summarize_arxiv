    "fano resonances @xcite , i.e. asymmetric and sharp line - shapes that result from the interference of discrete resonance states with broadband continuum states , are ubiquitous in several areas of physics @xcite . in optics",
    ", they are observed in systems ranging from waveguide - cavity structures to plasmonics and metamaterials @xcite , promising applications for a wide range of photonic devices such as optical filters , switches , modulators and sensors @xcite . to this",
    "regard , line shape engineering , i.e. the possibility to control and tune frequency , shape and width of the fano resonance , is of major importance .",
    "conventionally , the fano line shape can be tuned over wide spectral ranges by carefully altering the geometry of a nanostructure @xcite . however , dynamical and fine control of fano resonances is a highly desirable functionality , which can not be accomplished by material or geometric engineering .",
    "so far , a few methods have been suggested for dynamical line shape engineering , based on two - beam interference @xcite , phase engineering of the excitation beam @xcite , the use of hybrid gratings @xcite , and the application of mechanical stress @xcite .    in this work a different route to create , shape and fine tuning fano resonances in photonic structures",
    "is theoretically proposed , which is based on dynamic modulation of the resonance frequency of a microcavity .",
    "we consider specifically dynamic fano resonances in coupled - resonator optical waveguide ( crow ) systems @xcite , which enable an exact analysis based on coupled - mode theory .",
    "the crow consists of a homogeneous chain of resonators in which light propagates by virtue of the coupling between adjacent resonators ; a fano resonance is dynamically created by periodic modulation of the resonance frequency of one resonator in the chain .",
    "creation of high-@xmath0 resonances by dynamic refractive index modulations based on photonic transitions was previously proposed in ref.@xcite , however in that system the resonances were not of fano type .",
    "crows have been explored in a variety of material platforms and resonator types , including photonic - crystal defect cavities , microspheres , microdisks , and microring resonators @xcite , with applications to light slowing down and storage @xcite , light capturing @xcite , time reversal @xcite , sensing @xcite , and for the realization of topologically - protected edge states .",
    "@xcite while in static crow structures fano resonances are usually realized by side - coupled microcavities @xcite , in our setup they arise dynamically from the interference of different floquet channels @xcite , and can be thus controlled by tuning the frequency and amplitude of the modulation signal .",
    "figure 1(a ) shows a schematic of the crow structure , which comprises a chain of coupled micro / nano resonators with the same resonance frequency @xmath1 and coupling constant @xmath2 .",
    "the resonators can be realized , for example , using photonic crystal defect cavities , coupled microdisk resonators or silicon microrings .",
    "the resonance frequency of the resonator at site @xmath3 is assumed to be biased and periodically modulated in time .",
    "this can be accomplished by modulation of the microcavity refractive index using various physical mechanisms such as free - carrier - plasma dispersion and electro - optic effects @xcite . in crow systems ,",
    "light transport can be described by coupled - mode theory @xcite , which reproduces with excellent accuracy the results obtained by fdtd numerical simulations @xcite .",
    "neglecting resonator losses , the coupled mode equations for the complex field amplitudes @xmath4 in each cavity read @xcite @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the resonance shift of the resonator at site @xmath3 , which comprises a bias ( static ) term @xmath7 and a sinusoidal term of amplitude @xmath8 and frequency @xmath9 . for @xmath10 , the static uniform chain of coupled resonators",
    "sustains bloch states of the form @xmath11 $ ] with the dispersion relation @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the bloch wave number [ see fig.1(b ) ] .",
    "forward - propagating waves in the chain , corresponding to a positive group velocity @xmath14 , have a bloch wave number @xmath15 in the range @xmath16 , whereas backward propagating waves correspond to @xmath17 . for @xmath18 , the resonator at site @xmath3 acts as a scattering centre , enabling to reflect light waves propagating along the crow at some spectral frequencies inside the crow transmission band @xmath19 .",
    "the high - frequency modulation regime @xmath20 simply corresponds to a re - normalization of the coupling constant ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) ; this case it is not of interest for the onset of dynamic fano resonances .",
    "here we assume that @xmath9 and @xmath8 are of the same order of magnitude than the coupling constant @xmath2 . in this regime",
    "dynamic fano resonances can arise because light can hop across the modulated resonator following different floquet paths @xcite . assuming that a forward - propagating light wave with bloch wave number @xmath15 ( @xmath21 ) and frequency @xmath12 is incident onto the modulated resonator from the left to the right side of the chain , according to floquet theory @xcite the exact scattered solution to eq.(1 ) has the form    @xmath22 + r_{\\alpha}(q )    \\exp[iq_{\\alpha } ( n+1 ) ] \\right\\ } \\exp(-i \\omega_{\\alpha } t ) & n \\leq -1 \\\\ \\sum_{\\alpha= -\\infty}^{\\infty }   b_{\\alpha } \\exp(-i \\omega_{\\alpha } t ) & n=0 \\\\",
    "\\sum_{\\alpha= -\\infty}^{\\infty }   t_{\\alpha}(q )   \\exp[-iq_{\\alpha } ( n-1 ) ] \\times   \\exp(-i \\omega_{\\alpha } t ) & n \\geq 1 \\end{array } \\right.\\ ] ]    where @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the reflection and transmission amplitudes of the various floquet ( scattered ) orders @xmath26 , @xmath27 are the harmonic amplitudes of the field in the modulated resonator at @xmath3 , and @xmath28 are defined from the relation @xmath29 with @xmath30 if @xmath28 is real ( propagative modes ) and @xmath31 if @xmath28 is complex ( evanescent modes ) .",
    "the power transmittance @xmath32 and reflectance @xmath33 of the modulated resonator can be then calculated as @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the group velocity at the bloch wave number @xmath28 and the symbol @xmath36 means that the sum is extended over the indices @xmath37 corresponding to propagative modes ( i.e. @xmath28 real ) . the terms with @xmath38 in the sums of eq.(4 ) , i.e. @xmath39 and @xmath40 , correspond to elastic scattering , i.e. the frequency of transmitted and reflected photon is not altered by the oscillating potential at site @xmath3 .",
    "the other terms that contribute to the total transmittance and reflectance , namely @xmath41 and @xmath42 , correspond to inelastic scattering channels , with transmitted and reflected photons with a higher ( for @xmath43 ) or lower ( for @xmath44 ) energy amount @xmath45 . for a lossless system one",
    "has @xmath46 and the system is reciprocal , i.e. transmittance is independent of the incidence side .",
    "substitution of the ansatz ( 2 ) into eq.(1 ) and eliminating @xmath47 and @xmath48 yields the following difference equation for the transmission amplitudes @xmath49 of various floquet orders @xmath50",
    "let us first notice that , in the absence of the ac modulation , i.e. for @xmath51 , the solution to eqs.(5 ) is given by @xmath52 , where @xmath53 is the transmission amplitude of the static crow , given by @xmath54        the transmittance @xmath55 of the static crow is simply given by @xmath56 . a typical behavior of @xmath57 versus the normalized frequency @xmath58",
    "is shown in fig.1(c ) , dotted curve .",
    "dynamic fano resonances can be created by switching on the ac modulation term . to this aim ,",
    "let us assume for the sake of definiteness @xmath59 , however a similar analysis holds for @xmath60 .",
    "the special case @xmath61 behaves rather differently and it will be considered in the next section .",
    "for @xmath59 the static crow structure sustains a localized ( bound ) mode oscillating at the frequency @xmath62 outside the transmission crow band ; see fig.1(b ) .",
    "the bound mode is exponentially localized around the site @xmath3 with a localization length @xmath63 defined by the relation @xmath64 , namely one has @xmath65 [ see the right panel in fig.1(b ) ] .    ,",
    "@xmath66 and for @xmath67 ( curve 1 ) , @xmath68 ( curve 2 ) , and @xmath69 ( curve 3 ) .",
    "( b ) transmittance for @xmath67 , @xmath70 and for @xmath71 ( curve 1 ) , @xmath72 ( curve 2 ) , and @xmath73 ( curve 3 ) . ]    to create a fano resonance at the frequency @xmath74 inside the crow transmission band , let us modulate the microcavity refractive index at the frequency @xmath9 satisfying the condition @xmath75 . in this case , a light photon at the frequency @xmath76 close to @xmath74 incident onto the modulated microresonator ( incident floquet channel ) can gain one energy quantum @xmath77 and drop into the bound state .",
    "similarly , photons in the bound state can loss one energy quantum @xmath78 and jump to the incident channel .",
    "interference between direct and indirect ( bound - state mediated ) photon crossing creates a fano - like resonance , as shown in fig.1(c ) , solid curve . for parameter values chosen in the simulation ,",
    "the total transmittance @xmath79 comes from the contribution of the scattering channel @xmath80 and of six inelastic channels @xmath81 , corresponding to @xmath82 ( for higher values of @xmath83 the modes are evanescent at any incidence photon energy and do not contribute to the transmittance ) .",
    "the different ( elastic and inelastic ) contributions to the total transmittance are depicted in fig.1(d ) .",
    "note that the contribution from the inelastic scattering channels is extremely small , i.e. the transmitted and reflected light basically has the same frequency than the one of the incident light .",
    "formally , the onset of the fano resonance can be explained by considering the small - modulation limit @xmath84 and looking for a solution to eqs.(5 ) as a power series @xmath85 , where the term @xmath86 is of the order @xmath87 . at leading order ( @xmath88 )",
    "one recovers the static case , namely @xmath89 , whereas at first order one obtains @xmath90 while @xmath91 is a bounded function of @xmath15 and of order @xmath92 , @xmath93 shows a singularity at @xmath94 $ ] , which breaks the perturbative analysis . the singularity can be avoided by considering both @xmath95 and @xmath96 of the same order @xmath97 . in the two - channel approximation ,",
    "one obtains at leading order @xmath98 where we have set @xmath99/[1-\\exp(2iq_1)+(\\sigma/ \\kappa ) \\exp ( iq_1)]$ ] .",
    "note that @xmath100 differs from the static value @xmath53 because of the complex term @xmath101 in the denominator of eq.(8 ) .",
    "since near @xmath102 the floquet channel @xmath103 corresponds to an evanescent mode , at leading order the transmittance can be thus calculated as @xmath104 , which well reproduces the exact shape obtained by exact numerical analysis of eqs.(4 ) [ see the dashed curve in fig.1(c ) ] . note that , around the frequency @xmath105 , the transmittance shows a characteristic sharp and asymmetric profile , rapidly varying from zero to ( almost ) one .",
    "the frequency @xmath74 around which the fano resonance appears can be tuned by changing the modulation frequency @xmath9 according to the relation @xmath106 , whereas the resonance width is controlled by the modulation amplitude @xmath8 ; see fig.2 .",
    "the case of unbiased microresonator ( @xmath61 ) shows a different behavior . here",
    "the static transmittance is unity [ eq.(6 ) with @xmath61 ] , and the structure does not sustain any localized mode . when the modulation is switched on , for @xmath108 quite remarkably _ two _ resonances ( rather than one ) at the frequencies @xmath109 and @xmath110 are created , symmetrically placed with respect to @xmath1 ; see fig.3(a ) . in the weak modulation limit , this behavior can be explained by observing that , for @xmath61 , a singularity can appear in _ either _ @xmath111 [ eq.(7 ) ] at the bloch wave numbers @xmath15 such that @xmath112 .",
    "the two resonances appear as asymmetric dips in the transmission spectrum [ see fig.3(a ) ] . as @xmath113 , the two resonances interference and overlap at @xmath114 , yielding a more complex resonance pattern comprising a narrow transmission dip with embedded an ultra - narrow resonance peak with unity transmittance at frequency @xmath114 , see fig.3(b ) .",
    "the ultra - narrow transmission peak created inside the dark dip and arising form resonance overlapping can be regarded as a kind of electromagnetically - induced transparency ( eit ) effect .",
    "the entire dynamical process , i.e. creation and overlapping of resonances , is well described within a five - channel model by considering the amplitudes @xmath49 , @xmath115 in eqs.(5 ) .     for @xmath116 and for ( a ) @xmath117 , and ( b ) @xmath118 .",
    "in ( b ) the inset shows an enlargement of the transmittance around @xmath114 , with a characteristic eit - like spectrum arising from resonance overlap . ]    , @xmath116 , @xmath117 and for increasing values of loss modulation parameter @xmath119 : @xmath120 ( curve 1 ) , @xmath121 ( curve 2 ) , and @xmath122 ( curve 3 ) . ]",
    "let us briefly comment on the practical requirements for the experimental implementation of dynamic fano resonances .",
    "ultrahigh-@xmath0 coupled nanocavities can be realized in a two - dimensional triangular - lattice air - hole photonic crystal slab @xcite , and ultrafast dynamic modulation of the refraction index can be achieved by carrier injection . for crow designed to operate at @xmath123 nm ,",
    "a typical value of the coupling rate is @xmath124 ghz , according the experimental data of ref.@xcite .",
    "hence the spectrum shown in fig.1(c ) corresponds to a dynamic fano resonance with spectral width ( distance between minimum and maximum of transmittance ) of @xmath125 mhz , created by refractive index modulation at frequency @xmath126 ghz and modulation amplitude @xmath127 . assuming that the fractional change in resonant frequency is directly related to the fractional change in index of refraction @xmath128 ,",
    "i.e. @xmath129 , the estimated value of modulation is within the current technology limits of the maximum index change ( @xmath130 ) . finally , let us briefly discuss the limitations introduced by cavity losses .",
    "there are basically two types of resonator losses that limit the observation of fano resonances : static cavity losses , and spurious time - periodic losses arising from index modulation of the resonator at site @xmath3 .",
    "as far as static losses are concerned , let as assume a nanocavity @xmath0-factor larger than @xmath131 , which is achievable with current technology according to ref .",
    "@xcite ; the static resonator losses simply limit the resolution of the spectrum to less than 200 mhz ; the fano resonance of fig.1(c ) , corresponding to a spectral width of @xmath125 mhz , should be therefore resolved .",
    "the other limitation that might prevent the observation of dynamic fano resonances comes from carrier injection used to modulate the resonance frequency , which generally introduces spurious dynamical modulation of cavity losses @xcite at site @xmath3 .",
    "we simulated the effect of cavity loss modulation by assuming @xmath132 $ ] , where the dimensionless parameter @xmath119 accounts for the imaginary - to - real modulation strength induced by carrier injection @xcite .",
    "figure 4 shows an example of computed fano resonances that takes into account modulation of resonator losses .",
    "the figure clearly shows that for moderate values of @xmath119 ( e.g. @xmath133 ) a severe degradation of the fano resonance occurs .",
    "hence spurious dynamic modulation of cavity losses represents the most severe limitation for the observation of narrow fano resonances ; in particular carrier injection leading to modulation strengths @xmath119 of cavity loss larger than @xmath134 should be avoided .",
    "lineshape engineering , i.e. the possibility to control and tuning frequency and shape of the fano resonance , is a functionality of key relevance .",
    "conventionally , the fano lineshape can be tuned over wide spectral ranges by carefully altering the geometry of a nanostructure , however material or geometric engineering alone does not enable dynamical and fine lineshape control . in this work a novel dynamic method to create , shape and tuning fano resonances in photonic structures has been theoretically proposed , which is based on dynamic modulation of the resonance frequency of a micro / nano cavity .",
    "analytical results based on exact and perturbative floquet analysis have been presented for the case of coupled resonator optical waveguide structures , however the method can be extended to other photonic structures , such as a waveguide side coupled to a cavity @xcite .",
    "our results provide an important step toward the engineering and dynamical control of fano resonances in integrated photonic structures that could be extended to disclose new physical aspects and applications of fano resonances .",
    "for example , the use of dynamic modulation breaks time reversal symmetry and thus , with a judicious engineering of the photonic structure , could be potentially extended to realize non - reciprocal fano - like resonances , i.e. different fano line shapes for forward and backward propagation , a possibility that has been so far overlooked .",
