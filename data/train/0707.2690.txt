    "a deconfined phase of nuclear matter is expected to be formed at the high energy densities created in relativistic heavy ion collisions @xcite .",
    "it is widely believed that important signatures of such a phase are reflected in the space - time extent and shape of particle emission source functions .",
    "recently , 1-dimensional source imaging techniques @xcite have revealed a non - trivial long range structure in the two - pion emission source at rhic @xcite .",
    "the origins of this structure are still unclear .",
    "the presence / absence of such a structure in the pion emission sources in heavy ion collisions at intermediate sps energies could yield important information which could help resolve the structure s origins .",
    "the na49 collaboration has carried out pb+pb collisions over a wide range of bombarding energies at the cern sps during the last decade @xcite .",
    "such a rich data set provides a unique opportunity to search for this long range structure at the sps and study its evolution with beam energy with a view to unraveling its nature .    in this paper ,",
    "the 3-dimensional emission source images for pions produced in central pb+pb collisions over the incident energy range 40 and 158  agev are presented .",
    "the results are discussed in the context of a gaussian shape assumption .",
    "the data presented here were taken by the na49 collaboration during the years 1996 - 2002 .",
    "the incident beams of 40 and 158  agev were provided by the cern sps accelerator .",
    "the na49 large acceptance hadron detector @xcite achieves large acceptance precision tracking ( @xmath0 ) and particle identification using time projection chambers .",
    "charged particles are detected by tracks left in the tpc and identified by the energy deposited in the tpc gas .",
    "mid - rapidity particle identification is further enhanced by a time - of - flight wall ( resolution 60ps ) .",
    "event centrality is determined by a forward calorimeter which measures the energy of spectator matter .",
    "3d correlation functions , c(@xmath1 ) , were obtained as the ratio of pair to uncorrelated reference distributions in relative momentum @xmath1 for @xmath2 pairs . here , @xmath3 is half of the relative momentum between the two particles in the pair center - of - mass system ( pcms ) .",
    "the pair distribution was obtained using pairs of particles from the same event and the uncorrelated distribution was obtained by pairing particles from different events .",
    "track merging and splitting effects were removed by appropriate cuts on both the pair and uncorrelated distributions .",
    "momentum resolution effects were negligible .    in the cartesian harmonic decomposition technique @xcite , the 3d correlation function",
    "is expressed as @xmath4 where @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 are cartesian harmonic basis elements ( @xmath8 is solid angle in @xmath1 space ) and @xmath9 are cartesian correlation moments given by @xmath10 the coordinate axes are oriented so that z is parallel to the beam ( long ) direction , x points in the direction of the total momentum of the pair in the locally co - moving system ( lcms ) ( out ) and y is perpendicular to the other two axes ( side ) .",
    "the correlation moments , for each order @xmath11 , are calculated from the measured 3d correlation function using equation ( [ eqn2 ] ) .",
    "each independent correlation moment is then imaged using the 1d source imaging code of brown and danielewicz @xcite to obtain the corresponding source moment for each order @xmath11 .",
    "bose - einstein symmetrisation and coulomb interaction ( the sources of the observed correlations ) are contained in the source imaging code .",
    "thereafter , the total source function is constructed by combining the source moments for each @xmath11 as in equation ( [ eqn3 ] )    @xmath12",
    "figure [ 40_160gev_fit ] shows the @xmath13 ( @xmath14 ) and @xmath15 ( @xmath16 and @xmath17 ) moments for mid - rapidity ( @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is particle laboratory rapidity and @xmath20 is cm rapidity ) , low @xmath21 ( @xmath22 ) @xmath2 pairs from 158  agev central ( 7@xmath23 ) pb+pb collisions , as a function of the relative momentum q in the pcms frame . here , @xmath16 is shorthand for @xmath24 etc .",
    "moments for other l s are either zero or negligible .",
    "the lorentz transformation of @xmath1 from the laboratory frame to the pcms is done by transforming to the lcms along the beam axis and then transforming to the pcms along the pair transverse momentum .",
    "the data are represented in fig .",
    "[ 40_160gev_fit ] by solid circles , while squares represent the results of fits to the independent moments with model sources , an ellipsoid shape ( 3d gaussian ) in panels ( a)-(c ) and a 2-source shape in panels ( d)-(f ) .",
    "the last function arises by assuming a linear combination of two gaussians for the single particle distribution .",
    "the best - fit parameters for the two shapes are listed in the lower panels .",
    "the 2-source shape yields a much better representation of the data .",
    "-1.cm    given that the only significant imaged moments are found for @xmath25 and 2 multipolarities , the net imaged source function in the x , y and z directions is simply the sum of the 1d source @xmath26 and the corresponding @xmath27 moment @xmath28 where i= x , y or z. in panels ( a)-(c ) , figure [ 40_160gev_src ] compares the net imaged source ( squares ) for mid - rapidity , low @xmath21 pion pairs from central pb+pb collisions at 40  agev ( i.e @xmath29agev ) to the best - fit parametrized functions , gaussian ( triangles ) and 2-source model ( circles ) . the source image and the 2-source model",
    "agree very well in all 3 directions and both disagree with the gaussian fit in the z direction .    at 158  agev ( i.e @xmath30agev ) , represented in panels ( d)-(f ) of fig .",
    "[ 40_160gev_src ] , the findings are similar , but in addition to the z direction , the source function starts to develop a non - gaussian tail in the x direction",
    ".        -1.cm",
    "the ratio of the rms radii of the source functions in the x and y directions is 1.3@xmath310.1 at 40  agev and 1.2@xmath310.1 at 158  agev .",
    "this deviation from unity , evident visually , points to a finite pion emission time .    moreover , the rms pair separation in the z direction , from figure [ 40_160gev_src](c ) and ( f ) , is 11fm at 40  agev and 12fm at 158  agev .",
    "these dimensions are much smaller than the lorentz - contracted nuclear diameters of 3fm at 40  agev and 1.5fm at 158  agev and in fact give the rms pair separation due to the longidutional spread of nuclear matter created by the passage of the two nuclei .",
    "since the latter are moving with almost the speed of light , one can infer the lower bound formation time of the created nuclear matter to be 8fm / c at 40  agev and 10fm / c at 158  agev .",
