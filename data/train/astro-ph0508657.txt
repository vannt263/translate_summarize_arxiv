    "for well over 30 years , the basic theory of active galactic nuclei ( agns ) has been that they are luminous because of the accretion of matter onto black holes ( bhs ; @xcite ) . in this picture",
    ", the luminosity produced by a bh of mass @xmath10 has a natural maximum , the eddington limit ( @xmath11 ) , at which the radiation pressure due to the accretion of the infalling matter balances the gravitational attraction of the bh .",
    "most models for agns assume that they are bhs radiating near the eddington limit , and as techniques for independently estimating bh masses in agns have been developed , it has become possible to test this supposition .",
    "in particular , large , modern spectroscopic surveys can provide estimates of the eddington ratios ( the ratio of the agn bolometric luminosity to the eddington limit ) for thousands of agns ( see , e.g. , analyses of the sloan digital sky survey [ sdss ] by mclure & dunlop [ 2004 ] and m.  vestergaard et al .",
    ", in preparation ) .",
    "unfortunately , the shallowness of these large , wide - area surveys imposes severe restrictions on the combinations of eddington ratio and bh mass that are observable , especially at @xmath12 . for @xmath13 ,",
    "the sdss is sensitive only to near - eddington radiators above this redshift , and even at @xmath14 the sdss analyses to date have not clearly established whether there is a lower cutoff to the @xmath0 distribution at fixed bh mass .",
    "@xcite derived bh masses for over 500 ( @xmath15 ) agns and found a broad range of eddington ratios .",
    "however , it is difficult to draw any conclusions about the underlying distribution of @xmath16 because their dataset is heavily weighted toward high - luminosity objects .",
    "the agn and galaxy evolution survey probes nearly a decade further down the agn luminosity function than the sdss .",
    "for the first time , this permits a relatively unbiased measurement of the distribution of eddington ratios at fixed bh mass at @xmath17 , while the distribution at fixed luminosity can be measured down to @xmath18 .",
    "the ages survey uses the 300-fiber hectospec robotic spectrograph on the mmt @xcite to survey galaxies and agns in the botes field of the noao deep wide - field survey ( ndwfs ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . both a population of high mass bhs radiating significantly below eddington and a population of low mass bhs radiating near or above eddington would be observable with ages . in this paper",
    "we show : ( 1 ) that the distribution of eddington ratios at fixed bh mass or at fixed luminosity is narrowly peaked and well - described by a single log - normal distribution independent of redshift and luminosity , ( 2 ) that this peak occurs at roughly 1/4 of the eddington limit , and ( 3 ) that the rms error in bh mass estimates from emission - line scaling relations is less than @xmath80.3  dex at fixed luminosity .",
    "the first two conclusions imply that the luminous growth of bhs over cosmic time is dominated by objects radiating near the eddington limit .",
    "we present a brief overview of our data from the ages survey in   [ sec : data ] and describe our method of analysis in   [ sec : analysis ] .",
    "we present our bh mass estimates and eddington ratios as functions of redshift and luminosity in   [ sec : results ] .",
    "finally , we discuss the implications of these results in   [ sec : discuss ] . in our analysis , we assume an @xmath19 , flat cosmology .",
    "ages is a redshift survey in the roughly 9 deg@xmath20 botes field that had been imaged by the ndwfs in @xmath21 , @xmath22 , and @xmath23 filters .",
    "subsequent surveys have imaged the field at many wavelengths , providing a rich multi - wavelength data set . in this paper , we make particular use of data from the _ chandra x - ray observatory _ xbotes survey @xcite , and the _ spitzer space telescope _ ( mips : rieke et al . 2004 ; irac : eisenhardt et al .",
    "2004 ) .",
    "the ages - i survey ( c.  kochanek et al .",
    ", in preparation ) selected agn candidates as either x - ray or 24@xmath5 sources , with @xmath24 mag ( vega ) optical point source counterparts .",
    "objects were considered to be point sources , if they were point - like in any one of @xmath22 , @xmath23 , or @xmath25 .",
    "since the luminosities we consider here are higher than the canonical seyfert luminosities , there should be little contribution from host galaxies in these agns .",
    "the primary sample of @xmath12 agns consists of either xbotes sources with @xmath26 counts ( over an average exposure time of 5 ks ) or 24@xmath5 sources brighter than 1  mjy that are off the stellar locus ( 2mass  @xmath27 $ ] ) .",
    "these are supplemented by x - ray sources with 2 or 3 counts and 24@xmath5 sources with @xmath28 .",
    "redshifts were obtained with hectospec at the mmto .",
    "the spectra were analyzed by two independent pipelines and verified by eye .",
    "this led to a sample of 733 broad - line agns with @xmath29 .",
    "we analyze a subset of this sample for which we can reliably measure emission line widths , as described in  [ sec : fwhm ] .",
    "there are three issues for understanding the completeness of our sample : the literal completeness of the spectroscopy , the effects of the optical flux limits , and the effects of the 24@xmath5/x - ray flux limits .",
    "the first , the completeness of the spectroscopy , plays no role in our conclusions . while we did not obtain spectra of every candidate matching our selection criteria , we did obtain redshifts for 97% of the candidates for which we obtained spectra .",
    "these represented only 66% of the candidates , but the candidates with spectra can be regarded as a `` random '' sub - sample of the candidates that was dictated by the fraction of the ndwfs region covered by spectroscopy and whether it was possible to assign fibers to the candidates . presumably neither of these issues are correlated with either eddington ratio or bh mass .",
    "thus , the only question is whether the spectrum allowed the measurement of the line fwhm , and we discuss this in   [ sec : fwhm ] .",
    "the second issue , the optical flux limit imposed for the spectroscopic targets , we will include explicitly in our analysis .    it is the third issue , the consequences of the 24@xmath5 and x - ray flux limits that we must consider in more detail .",
    "our x - ray limit is the deepest in the survey ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and therefore no correction is necessary for the x - ray completeness .",
    "however , if we examine the distribution of agns in the plane of the @xmath22-band and 24@xmath5 fluxes , it is clear that both of these flux limits matter .",
    "our spectroscopic limit is nominally defined by @xmath30 mag .",
    "however , the 24@xmath5+x - ray selected sample is only complete to @xmath31 mag .",
    "we evaluate the problem and estimate a correction by using the deeper samples from the ages - ii catalogs ( c. kochanek et al .",
    ", in preparation ) .",
    "ages - ii includes agns selected using mid - infrared colors from the irac shallow survey @xcite , based on the color selection method outlined in @xcite , as well as the 24@xmath5 and x - ray criteria used for ages - i .",
    "this leads to an agn sample with a 3.6@xmath5 ( approximately @xmath32-band ) flux limit of @xmath33 = 18 $ ] mag and an optical limit of @xmath34 mag that fills in most of the missing quasars to the optical flux limit of ages - i .",
    "the ages - ii @xmath33 = 18 $ ] mag limit , combined with the fact that @xmath12 agns have @xmath35 > 2.9 $ ] , implies that the survey is complete to @xmath36 mag .",
    "brighter than this magnitude , we simply compare the ages - i and ages - ii samples to determine the required completeness correction . for fainter agns",
    ", we must apply an additional correction that incorporates the fraction of agns that are lost in ages - ii owing to their relatively blue colors with respect to the [ 3.6 ] limit .",
    "this correction factor is known from the brighter magnitudes where ages - ii is complete .",
    "we show the functional form for our completeness correction in figure  [ fig : completeness ] .",
    "these corrections for completeness are important for the interpretation of the results in  [ sec : mass ] , and we return to the completeness corrections and how they affect our conclusions there .",
    "bh masses have been estimated from h@xmath1  emission line widths and luminosities for some time ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . however , it was only with the application of reverberation mapping ( for an overview , see * ? ? ? * ) that this relationship became firmly established , and then was revised with improved data and techniques @xcite .",
    "the general form of the relation is : @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the estimated bh mass in units of m@xmath39 , @xmath40 is the h@xmath1  full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) in @xmath41 , and @xmath42 is the continuum luminosity near the line ( 5100  ) in units of 10@xmath43 . because optical spectra can only probe h@xmath1  to a maximum redshift of @xmath44 , studies have been undertaken to find scaling relationships for uv lines , allowing the estimation of black hole masses at high redshift .",
    "a relationship for  @xmath451549 and the 1350    continuum ( probing @xmath46 ) was calibrated from reverberation - based h@xmath1  measurements and single - epoch  observations @xcite , which is well - matched to the luminosity range probed by ages - i . for intermediate redshifts ( @xmath47 ) , @xcite determined a scaling relationship for  @xmath452800 by comparing single - epoch measurements of  fwhm and 3000    continuum luminosity with results from h@xmath1  reverberation mapping under the assumption that the two lines are emitted at the same distance from the bh due to their similar ionization potentials . while the response of  in reverberation mapping campaigns has been rather weak ( see clavel et al .",
    "1991 and dietrich & kollatschny 1995 for the best result , that of ngc  5548 ) , reverberation studies of  have yielded bh masses in good agreement with those from h@xmath1 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "there has been a long struggle to measure bh masses from these emission lines and each line has associated peculiarities .",
    "we refer the reader to the original works , which address these issues in greater detail .",
    "we adopt ( @xmath48)=(0.68 ,  0.61 ) in equation  ( [ eqn : mhat ] ) for the h@xmath1 relation ( from * ? ? ?",
    "* although other versions of the relation differ by less than @xmath490.10 in slope ) ; we use ( @xmath48)@xmath50(0.20 ,  0.7 ) for  ( from * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; and we estimate in   [ sec : mg2 ] that ( @xmath48)@xmath50(0.31 ,  0.88 ) for .",
    "we measure the line widths from the ages - i spectra (   [ sec : fwhm ] ) and the continuum luminosity from the ndwfs photometry (   [ sec : contlum ] ) .",
    "we discuss the sensitivity of our results to the exact parameters of these relations in ",
    "[ sec : mg2fwhm ] .",
    "the ages - i spectra have a pixel scale of 1.2    and a resolution of @xmath51    fwhm . for our analysis ,",
    "we boxcar - smooth the spectra over 11 pixels , then subtract a locally - defined linear continuum from the region around the emission line of interest . the rest - frame wavelength regions used to set the continuum around each line are ( 4740 - 4765   , 5075 - 5100   ) for h@xmath1 , ( 2670 - 2682   , 2940 - 2970   ) for , and ( 1455 - 1465   , 1700 - 1705   ) for .",
    "we subtract narrow - line contributions to h@xmath1  using the [ ]  @xmath455007 line as a model , with the [ ] flux scaled by a factor of 0.15 .",
    "this fiducial value for the ( narrow h@xmath1)-to- [ ] flux ratio lies within the range defined by local agns that have only narrow emission lines ( baldwin et al .",
    "1981 ; veilleux & osterbrock 1987 ) . visual inspection of the post - subtraction spectra revealed little residual narrow - line contribution .",
    "we determine the peak flux in the line region and measure the fwhm of the line as follows ( adapted from * ? ? ?",
    "* and illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : demo ] ) .",
    "first , we determine two wavelengths on each side of the line : ( 1 ) the first crossing of the half - max flux level moving downward from the line peak ( indicated as blue1 and red1 in fig .  [ fig : demo ] ) ; ( 2 ) the first half - max crossing moving upward from the line edge ( blue2 and red2 ) .",
    "the mean of these two wavelengths is taken as the half - max point for that side of the line ( blue and red ) .",
    "the fwhm is defined as the difference between the blue and red points .",
    "the boxcar smoothing of 13    serves to minimize the sensitivity of our automated procedure to noise in the spectra and results in a final resolution of @xmath52 .",
    "this adds a negligible ( @xmath82% ) systematic contribution to our measured fwhm , for which we do not correct .",
    "we estimate the error in the fwhm with the technique described by corbett et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , in which line gradients at the half - max points are used to convert the poisson noise of the spectral counts at half - max into wavelength uncertainties . a minimum fwhm error of 10%",
    "is imposed on all measurements .    to remove spurious measurements from the dataset",
    ", every spectrum is examined for a series of problems : anomalous features ( e.g. , sky subtraction artifacts ) , significant absorption in the line profile , strong emission around , and low signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) .",
    "the presence of broad absorption in agns has been found to be independent of eddington ratio ( scoggins et al .",
    "2004 ) , so the lines removed for strong absorption ( mainly ) should be unbiased with respect to eddington ratio .",
    "in addition , the eddington ratio distributions we observe for objects with masses from and from are similar , despite contamination being much less significant near .",
    "we take this smooth transition as evidence that our cautious removal procedure only leaves objects for which the fwhm measurements are secure .",
    "we remove 326 of the 733 agns in this process : 70 spectral anomalies , 130 for absorption features , 77 with problematic  emission , and 49 with low spectroscopic s / n .",
    "representative spectra for the final three classes ( and one good spectrum ) are shown in figure  [ fig:4spec ] .",
    "some spectra fall into multiple categories , and for our accounting they are assigned to the first class in this ordering of problems .",
    "our final data set is composed of 407 agns , with mass measurements for ( 26 , 267 , 114 ) agns determined from ( h@xmath1 , , ) .",
    "the full range of measured line widths is @xmath53  for h@xmath1 , @xmath54  for , and @xmath55  for .",
    "our hectospec observations were made during the instrument s inaugural season of operation . during our runs ,",
    "the atmospheric dispersion corrector did not function consistently , making it difficult to accurately flux calibrate our spectra .",
    "we therefore estimate the continuum luminosities required for the @xmath10 estimates from the broad - band magnitudes . using the 6@xmath56-aperture ndwfs - dr3 @xmath22 magnitude",
    ", we calculate the flux at the band s effective wavelength ( 6515   ) , then compute the rest - frame 5100 , 3000 , or 1350    fluxes assuming a power - law continuum with f@xmath57 .",
    "this spectral index is the average spectral slope measured for the @xmath8700 agns of comparable luminosity in the sample of @xcite .",
    "the range around the median slope is less than 0.15 ( m.  dietrich & f.  hamann , in preparation ) , so our adoption of a fixed slope contributes little , on average , to our total observational uncertainties .",
    "we note that the dietrich & hamann measurements are consistent with the results from the sdss composite spectra @xcite .",
    "contributions of emission lines to the @xmath22-band flux should be less than 0.2 mag .",
    "initially , we used the relation of @xcite , for which ( @xmath48)=(0.53 ,  0.47 ) in equation  ( [ eqn : mhat ] ) .",
    "however , for agns in the redshift ranges in which we could estimate @xmath10 using both and a second line ( @xmath58 for h@xmath1 and @xmath59 for ) , we found systematic differences when using this relation .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig : dm.l ] , there is a linear trend in [ @xmath60()@xmath61(h@xmath1 or ) ] with @xmath62 that has a similar slope for both redshift ranges / lines .",
    "fitting for the luminosity trend , we find a consistent relationship for both h@xmath1 and , ensuring that all three lines will be on a common scale .",
    "we redefine the relation from this fit and find that ( @xmath48)=(0.31 ,  0.88 ) , while the @xcite slope is ruled out at the 5-@xmath63 level .",
    "although we use this modified relation in the current work , we are not at this time advocating our revised relation for other studies because of the differences between our analysis and that presented in the @xcite paper .",
    "after adjusting the slopes , the residual scatter between and h@xmath1 or mass estimates indicates an intrinsic dispersion beyond the measurement errors of 0.27  dex .",
    "this is less than the 0.4  dex of intrinsic scatter found in earlier studies of ( mclure & dunlop 2004 ) and suggests that @xmath10 estimates are of comparable accuracy to those from h@xmath1 or , although in principle all three mass relations could be affected by the same zero - point error .",
    "in addition to the scaling with luminosity , we examined the mass difference as a function of  fwhm , allowing both the luminosity and fwhm scaling to be free parameters in our fit .",
    "we find that the best - fit relation yields a fwhm scaling of 2.13@xmath640.34 .",
    "we interpret the consistency with the standard virial assumption as a positive indication for the validity of the -based technique .",
    "following @xcite , we estimate the bolometric luminosity as @xmath65 , a value that assumes an agn spectral energy distribution ( sed ) typical of optically selected quasars with little dust obscuration .",
    "we calculate the rest - frame flux at 5100    employing the same method that we used to estimate continuum luminosities in   [ sec : contlum ] . while this extrapolation to 5100    is quite far for the highest redshift agns in our sample , published conversions to @xmath66 using alternative continuum regions affect the resulting luminosities by less than 30% ( for our assumed spectral slope ) .",
    "of course , departures from the standard agn sed could change the relation between @xmath66 and @xmath67 , so it is important to keep in mind that the `` bolometric '' luminosities referred to throughout this paper are really just multiples of the optical luminosity .",
    "we emphasize here that we are adopting the theoretical framework that black hole mass can be reliably measured from the virial relationships .",
    "our analysis requires knowledge of black hole masses and bolometric luminosities , but we can only make estimates of these quantities . because there are dispersions in the spectral slopes and bolometric corrections of real agns , our adoption of fixed values for these parameters causes us to misestimate @xmath66 .",
    "intrinsic dispersion in the virial relationships causes us to misestimate @xmath10 . the combination of the intrinsic dispersion of eddington ratios and our misestimations of @xmath66 and @xmath10 result in the observed scatter of our measurements .",
    "a primary goal of this study is to understand the mass distribution of active bhs at a fixed luminosity and redshift .",
    "the homogeneous nature of our sample and the depth of the ages - i survey combine to allow us to address the underlying distribution over a wider range of @xmath66 and @xmath68 than other studies .",
    "figure  [ fig : lofz ] shows our sample of agn luminosities as a function of redshift , along with curves at fixed magnitudes , to illustrate how the optical flux limits restrict the sample .",
    "we also show how the ages - i data are distributed relative to the knee of the luminosity function as determined by the 2df - sdss lrg and qso survey ( 2slaq ; * ? ? ?",
    "in a bright survey like the sdss , for which the @xmath69 mag limit ( for @xmath70 agns ) corresponds to @xmath71 mag and the @xmath72 mag limit ( for @xmath73 ) corresponds to @xmath74 mag , one can not compare agns of fixed luminosity over as broad a redshift range as with ages - i .",
    "figure  [ fig : seurat ] shows the distribution of agns in inferred bh mass , @xmath10 , and bolometric luminosity , @xmath66 .",
    "the points are color - coded by redshift , and we show only a typical error bar to avoid clutter .",
    "these uncertainties reflect only the _ statistical _ errors in the line width and luminosity estimates , and we will discuss the possible consequences of systematic errors in   [ sec : discuss ] .",
    "figure [ fig : seurat ] has several striking features .",
    "first , it is characterized by a fairly narrow ridge that extends diagonally , with unit slope , across the entire diagram .",
    "second , this ridge is separated from the solid line representing the eddington limit by approximately 0.6  dex .",
    "third , at a given luminosity , the density of points falls rapidly toward higher @xmath10 , i.e. , at small eddington ratio .",
    "most of the conclusions of this paper are derived by quantifying these features . at fixed @xmath66 ,",
    "the ridge is broader than the statistical uncertainties , indicating that it is dominated either by intrinsic scatter in the underlying distribution or by scatter between the inferred values of @xmath10 and @xmath66 and their true values . while the systematic errors in @xmath66 should be modest , determining the systematic errors in @xmath10 is a notoriously difficult problem to which we will return in   [ sec : discuss ] .",
    "however , from the ridge s relatively narrow width it is already clear that this scatter can not be too large .",
    "the fact that the ridge is displaced from the eddington limit shows that the great majority of observed agns radiate at modestly sub - eddington rates , assuming that our @xmath10 calibration is correct in the mean .",
    "the fact that there are few agns above the ridge implies that the observed ( in practice , luminosity - limited ) agns are dominated by bhs radiating close to eddington rather than more massive bhs radiating well below eddington .",
    "the data presented in figure [ fig : seurat ] also permit one to pose an orthogonal question : what is the distribution of agn luminosities at fixed @xmath10 ? however , this question can not be addressed by mere inspection of this figure and will require additional analysis .",
    "agns rejected from the final sample due to low s /",
    "n could induce the illusion of a narrow ridge if these lay preferentially near the selection boundary .",
    "figure  [ fig : seuratbw ] shows the @xmath75 vs. @xmath76 positions of the agns eliminated due to low s / n spectra and can be compared to figure  [ fig : seurat ] .",
    "we have not included in figure  [ fig : seuratbw ] objects rejected due to absorption , emission , or other anomalous features . these objects ( for which we show the @xmath77 distribution in the inset of fig .  [",
    "fig : seuratbw ] ) have unmeasurable fwhms , and it therefore is not sensible to assign any mass value , in contrast to agns for which we simply have low confidence in the measured value .",
    "objects were rejected without reference to their position in figure  [ fig : seuratbw ] , and there is no strong clustering of their position in this diagram . the simplest interpretation of this broad , flat distribution is that the fwhm measurements are simply bad , and that the calculated @xmath78 values bear only a casual relation to the true values .",
    "while the inclusion of these uniformly distributed bad measurements would slightly increase the dispersion of our measurements , we believe that their rejection is justified . in any case , including them does not qualitatively alter our results , as we show in   [ sec : mass ] .",
    "hence , we adopt the conclusions based on their exclusion .    in the next two subsections",
    "we examine the distributions of eddington ratios at fixed @xmath66 (   [ sec : lum ] ) and fixed @xmath10 (   [ sec : mass ] ) as functions of redshift .      in order to characterize the true distributions of masses and luminosities for the bhs in our sample",
    ", we perform a very simple maximum likelihood analysis , fitting the data assuming a model in which the true distribution of @xmath79 is gaussian ( i.e. , @xmath0 is log - normal ) .",
    "we divide the sample into 2 bins in redshift and 3 bins in luminosity .",
    "the redshift division is at @xmath80 , and the luminosity cuts are at @xmath81 and @xmath82 in both redshift bins . due to the different redshift distributions of sources at high and low luminosity , it is impossible to make cuts that yield similar numbers of objects in each bin .",
    "we therefore choose cuts such that we have at least @xmath810 objects in each bin . in each @xmath83 bin",
    "we estimate the mean and dispersion of @xmath79 , corrected for the statistical uncertainties .",
    "the histograms in figure  [ fig : lumbin ] show the distributions of estimated @xmath84 in each @xmath83 bin . for each panel , we calculate the unweighted mean and standard deviation of the data points , and we plot a gaussian with those parameters as a dashed curve in the panel .",
    "solid curves show the gaussians with our maximum likelihood fit parameters , which account for the statistical errors in the linewidth and luminosity of each data point .",
    "overall , these statistical errors are small compared to the widths of the histograms , so there is little difference between the dashed and solid curves . table  [ tab : mgauss ] lists the measured mean , dispersion , skewness , and kurtosis of the distributions in each @xmath83 bin , and the mean and dispersion of the maximum likelihood gaussian fits .",
    "the first point to note from figure  [ fig : lumbin ] is that the distribution of @xmath84 measurements in each bin is nearly gaussian , with a center and width that is approximately independent of redshift and luminosity .",
    "this result quantifies the impression from figure  [ fig : seurat ] that the observed agns in our sample are predominantly bhs radiating fairly near eddington ( @xmath85 ) , rather than more massive bhs at @xmath86 .",
    "the skewness and kurtosis of the distributions are in good agreement with the values @xmath87 and @xmath88 expected for a gaussian distribution .",
    "the second point to note is that these gaussians are rather narrow : @xmath89  dex after accounting for the statistical errors in our linewidth and luminosity measurements .",
    "these widths reflect the width of the intrinsic distribution of eddington ratios at fixed luminosity _ and _ the errors introduced by our use of universal values for the bolometric correction and the spectral slope . while there may be scatter around these values or around the relationships used to derive our bh masses and agn luminosities , that scatter already appears in figure  [ fig : seurat ] .",
    "for every object in which some quantity is underestimated by the use of the mean relation , another object will have that parameter overestimated .",
    "the only source of scatter in the estimates of @xmath10 that is _ not _ fully reflected in the distribution of eddington ratios is the difference between the observed luminosity and the time - averaged continuum luminosity in the neighborhood of the broad line for a given agn , the latter being the quantity most appropriate for the @xmath10 calculation .",
    "this is because both @xmath66 and @xmath10 have a luminosity dependence .",
    "one may show that , if the rms difference between the mean @xmath90 and the one derived from the observations is @xmath91 , then the dispersion in mass determinations is larger than the observed dispersion in eddington ratios , @xmath92 , by @xmath93 where @xmath94 is the power - law of the luminosity - dependence in equation  ( [ eqn : mhat ] ) .",
    "we identify three sources of @xmath95 : measurement error @xmath96  dex , scatter due to agn variability @xmath97  dex , and extrapolation of the line continuum from the @xmath22-band measurement @xmath98  dex - band photometric uncertainty , 2 ) the rms variability of agns over the light - crossing time for the largest broad - line regions in our sample ( i.e. , the maximum time between a luminosity change and the response of the emission line width ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and 3 ) the effect of the 1@xmath63 error on the slope extrapolated to the ends of the observed spectrum .",
    "] . combining these in quadrature , and using @xmath99  dex",
    ", we find @xmath100  dex , which differs negligibly from @xmath92 .",
    "we note that this estimate of @xmath101 represents the maximum possible error on @xmath10 and assumes that the intrinsic eddington ratio distribution has no width of its own .",
    "the conclusion that the quadrature sum of measurement errors in @xmath10 , scatter in bolometric corrections , scatter in spectral slopes , and variations in @xmath0 is only @xmath80.3  dex rms is rather remarkable .",
    "the data give no clear indication of how to partition the scatter between these contributions .",
    "the rms scatter of 0.3  dex in inferred @xmath10 seems plausible on geometrical grounds , since the relation between observed linewidth and bh mass may depend on viewing angle ( @xcite ; c.  kuehn & b.  peterson , in preparation ) . if the observational errors or the distribution of viewing angles do dominate the width of the histograms , then the intrinsic distribution of @xmath0 is very narrow indeed .",
    "figure  [ fig : monte_lumbin ] compares the observed distribution in the @xmath102 plane ( shown earlier in fig .",
    "[ fig : seurat ] ) to three monte carlo realizations in which we draw an estimated bh mass for each observed agn from a gaussian in @xmath84 with mean of @xmath103  dex and dispersion of 0.3  dex .",
    "it is clear by visual inspection that this simple model describes the observed distribution of points remarkably well .",
    "while one may be tempted to see outliers or gaps in figure  [ fig : seurat ] , these features commonly appear in monte carlo realizations of the sample made assuming the log - normal model .",
    "we stress that from an observational standpoint , the procedure followed in this section is extremely clean .",
    "since the sample completeness is well - characterized at fixed optical luminosity and is independent of eddington ratio , there are almost no selection effects coming into play in any of the luminosity bins .",
    "application of our completeness corrections have nearly zero effect on these histograms . on the other hand , _ within _ each luminosity bin there is a contribution to the dispersion in the histogram from uncertainties in estimating @xmath10 .",
    "the robust nature of binning by luminosity also applies to agn surveys with other flux limits .",
    "for example , in figure  3 of @xcite , who analyzed more than 12,000 agns from sdss , one can make similar cuts at constant @xmath104 ( @xmath105 ) .",
    "@xcite calculated the mean eddington ratio as a function of redshift , finding the mean to increase slightly with @xmath68 ( from 0.15 at @xmath106 to 0.5 at @xmath107 ) , but they do not address the shape of the distribution at fixed luminosity , nor , for the redshifts that they can probe , the distribution at fixed mass .",
    "@xcite find a much broader distribution of eddington ratios in their sample of 234 agns compiled from the literature .",
    "because their sample consists of low redshift ( @xmath14 ) and local ( @xmath108 ) systems , and extends to bolometric luminosities as low as @xmath109  erg  s@xmath4 , the difference from our results could plausibly be explained by the very different properties of the samples .",
    "the @xcite and @xcite studies of heterogeneous samples of agns are most akin to what we have presented here . in both works ,",
    "eddington ratios are presented over a wide range of redshifts and luminosities . however , because both studies relied on diverse mixtures of samples , the selection effects are not easily understood , and therefore , the underlying distribution of eddington ratios can not be determined .",
    "for example , the @xcite luminosity distribution is heavily weighted towards high luminosity objects .",
    "two of the main advantages of the ages - i survey are the homogeneity of the sample and the relatively straightforward completeness corrections ( see   [ sec : completeness ] ) , which allow us to address the underlying distribution of eddington ratios .",
    "the distribution of eddington ratios at fixed luminosity is a convolution of the luminosity distribution at fixed bh mass with the underlying bh mass function ( see @xcite ) .",
    "thus , the fall - off at low eddington ratios in figure  [ fig : lumbin ] could , in principle , be attributed primarily to a rapid fall - off in the @xmath10 distribution toward higher masses . since we know from our previous discussion that the errors in bh mass assignments must be fairly small ( 0.3  dex rms at most ) , we can bin the sample by estimated bh mass and look directly at the distribution of eddington ratios at fixed @xmath10 .",
    "figure  [ fig : massbin ] shows these distributions for mass bins @xmath110 , @xmath111 , and @xmath112 , and redshift bins @xmath113 , @xmath114 , and @xmath115 .",
    "in contrast to figure  [ fig : lumbin ] , the distribution of eddington ratios at fixed mass is affected by the magnitude limit of the survey .",
    "we also must include the effects of incompleteness at the faint end .",
    "we use the completeness function of figure  [ fig : completeness ] and the @xmath22-band magnitude of each of our 407 agns to calculate the number of objects at each observed combination of @xmath77 and @xmath68 that are `` missing '' .",
    "the missing objects are then distributed in mass at the ( @xmath77,@xmath68 ) of the real agn via the eddington ratio distribution we found in   [ sec : lum ] .",
    "for all objects , we take the distribution as log - normal in @xmath0 , with a mean of 1/4 and with @xmath63=0.30  dex . the contribution of these missing objects to each bin of eddington ratio",
    "is then summed within the mass and redshift ranges chosen for each panel .",
    "the solid histograms in each panel are completeness - corrected .",
    "this alters the histograms , but does not substantially alter our conclusions .",
    "the vertical arrow in each panel of figure  [ fig : massbin ] indicates the point in that mass - redshift bin at which agns are first lost to optical selection effects ( which begin at the low-@xmath10 , high-@xmath68 corner of the bin ) , and the shaded region indicates the point at which all agns ( extending to the highest @xmath10 and lowest @xmath68 corner of the bin ) are lost . for the lower - mass bins ( particularly at high redshift ) , the optical magnitude limit truncates the distributions , and we can not determine whether there is a true cutoff at low @xmath0 .",
    "however , in some bins , the optical magnitude limit only affects the regime @xmath116 , and it is possible to test for a real cutoff . in the highest - mass highest - redshift bin of figure  [ fig : massbin ] , there are too few objects to make a robust determination .",
    "however , figure  [ fig : massbingood ] shows four bins  @xmath117 at @xmath118 and @xmath119 , @xmath120 at @xmath121 , and @xmath122 at @xmath123  in which the statistics are relatively good and the fall - off appears to be real .",
    "the poisson probabilities that the peak in each case is a statistical fluctuation are found to be low , as shown in each panel in figure  [ fig : massbingood ] .",
    "the peak is therefore robust and not merely a product of counting statistics .",
    "finally , figure  [ fig : massbingood2 ] shows the effect of including the low s / n measurements from figure  [ fig : seuratbw ] on our eddington ratio distributions at fixed mass .",
    "the low s / n spectra do not affect any of our conclusions above .",
    "we note that the scatter in inferred @xmath10 might move agns from one mass bin to another , which could potentially enhance the appearance of a peak either on the rising or the falling sides .",
    "recall from ",
    "[ sec : lum ] and table  [ tab : mgauss ] that the rms scatter in the inferred @xmath10 must be less than @xmath80.3  dex . because the mass bins in figure  [ fig : massbingood ] have widths of at least 1  dex , scatter between mass bins must be a small effect .",
    "the smooth distribution of eddington ratios seen in figure  [ fig : seurat ] implies that it would be difficult to import structure into or out of a particular mass bin without having significant structure in another part of the distribution from which objects can scatter .",
    "no such structure is seen in our data .",
    "in fact , if we bin the monte carlo realizations of figure  [ fig : monte_lumbin ] , which have a @xmath124  dex gaussian distribution of estimated @xmath79 and which match the sample s observed luminosity distribution by construction , then we get histograms that qualitatively resemble those in the four mass - redshift bins of figure  [ fig : massbingood ] .",
    "this simple model therefore appears consistent with our data , although this experiment on its own does not tell us whether the observed distributions are shaped primarily by intrinsic scatter in @xmath0 or by errors in @xmath10 estimation .",
    "the filled circles at the bottom of each panel in figures  [ fig : massbin ] and [ fig : massbingood ] show the relevant spectroscopic limit of the sdss for each redshift bin .",
    "the sdss data are not deep enough to probe the cutoff in any of these bins , i.e. , the sdss can not provide an unbiased study of the eddington ratio distribution below 0.1 for bhs with @xmath125 above @xmath126 , or @xmath127 above @xmath128 .",
    "because of its large area , the sdss can obtain better statistics for high mass bhs at low redshift , or for very massive bhs at higher redshift , and it will be interesting to see whether these have a peaked eddington ratio distribution similar to that found here .",
    "the calibration of presents a potential problem for the conclusions drawn from the ages - i data that make use of this line .",
    "our empirical calibration leads to a steeper dependence of @xmath78 on luminosity for the  relationship (   [ sec : mg2 ] ) than for or h@xmath1 . as pointed out by @xcite ,",
    "if the dependence of black hole mass on luminosity is nearly linear and there is a simple relationship between the continuum and bolometric luminosities , then a strong correlation of increasing @xmath10 with increasing @xmath66 will be automatically introduced .",
    "with such a scaling relation , it would be possible for a small , but random distribution of  fwhms to reproduce a tight eddington ratio distribution without actually being related to the bh mass .",
    "however , the clear trend in figure  [ fig : dm.l ] and the fact that the  relation scales as @xmath129 , even when the velocity dependence is allowed to vary , indicates that the relationship among the 3000    continuum luminosity , the line width , and the black hole mass is _ not _ random .",
    "our empirical calibration for  depends directly on what we use for the h@xmath1 and relations .",
    "a new calibration of those two emission lines has recently been published @xcite , which has derived shallower slopes for both the h@xmath1 and  luminosity scalings , with ( @xmath130 ) values of ( 0.91 , 0.50 ) and ( 0.66 , 0.53 ) , respectively .",
    "the effect of adopting those relations is to shift the h@xmath1 points up @xmath80.2  dex in mass ( as they have typical luminosities near 10@xmath131 erg  s@xmath4 ) , and to shift the  points up by @xmath80.28  dex at the low luminosity end ( @xmath132 erg  s@xmath4 ) , and to leave them nearly unchanged at the high luminosity end . using these relations",
    "then sets the parameters of our empirically calibrated  mass relation to ( 0.55 , 0.82 ) .",
    "this shift produces roughly coherent movement across the @xmath133 plane , so the shapes of our histograms at fixed mass are basically unaffected  although our highlighted bins in figure  [ fig : massbingood ] must be shifted upwards by @xmath134  dex in mass .",
    "our survey of @xmath6 mag , x - ray- and 24@xmath5-selected agns in the botes ndwfs field yields four basic results .",
    "first , the rms scatter in bh masses inferred from linewidth - luminosity scaling relations is less than 0.3  dex , at least for @xmath135 and the luminosity range @xmath3  erg  s@xmath4 .",
    "second , luminous agns at @xmath136 are powered by bhs radiating at roughly @xmath137 of the eddington rate : there are few cases of higher mass bhs radiating well below eddington or of lower mass bhs radiating well above eddington .",
    "third , at _ fixed mass _ above @xmath138 ( where selection effects are inconsequential ) , the distribution of eddington ratios at @xmath139 is strongly peaked .",
    "fourth , the distribution around this peak is confined to within @xmath140  dex in @xmath16 , with many fewer broad - lined agns on either side .",
    "our analysis does not test the zero - point or luminosity scaling of the @xmath10 relations . to aid comparisons with previous work",
    ", we have used the scaling relations of @xcite for h@xmath1 and @xcite for .",
    "the results of @xcite , in which reverberation - based bh masses were calibrated by assuming that agns follow the same correlation between bh mass and stellar velocity dispersion as quiescent galaxies , suggest that the zero points of these relations should be adjusted upward by factors of 1.4 and 1.8 , respectively .",
    "we did adjust the @xcite relation based on the empirical evidence for a different luminosity scaling , as shown in figure  [ fig : dm.l ] .",
    "altering the zero - points of the @xmath10 relations or the mean bolometric correction would change our conclusions about the _ location _ of peaks in the @xmath0 distributions , but they would not change our conclusions about the _ existence _ of these peaks .",
    "for example , the @xcite revision would shift the means of our @xmath0 distributions downward by @xmath141  dex , but would not broaden the distributions ( this shift has been incorporated into the analysis of @xcite . ) with an identical shift to the mass ranges in figure  [ fig : massbingood ] , the relative positions of the histograms and the arrows in each panel would remain the same , but everything would be at a slightly lower eddington ratio . given the numerous complexities of bh mass estimates from emission line widths , our empirical evidence that these estimates have less than 0.3  dex rms scatter is remarkable .",
    "one might expect scatter nearly this large from geometrical effects alone , since the relation between observed linewidth and the bh mass may depend on viewing angle .",
    "the dominance of the @xmath136 agn population by near - eddington accretors is very different from the local - universe sample of agns , for which the distribution of inferred eddington ratios is broader ( e.g.,@xcite ) .",
    "the luminosities of these local agns are typically much lower than those in our sample , so it is unclear whether luminosity or redshift dependence is responsible for most of the difference .",
    "the ages - i sample does not probe down to seyfert luminosities ( below @xmath142 ) , and we therefore can not comment on the contribution of broad - lined seyfert galaxies to the overall black hole growth .",
    "in addition , while narrow - line objects can not be analyzed using the methods employed here , they are a very small fraction of the overall ages - i agn sample , with only 29 objects in the range @xmath143 matching a narrow - line template and no such objects above @xmath144 . high eddington ratios for the most luminous quasars at high redshift are not surprising , since the steep high - mass fall - off of the bh mass function ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) means that the bhs required to power them at _",
    "sub_-eddington luminosities would be very rare .",
    "however , the dominance of near - eddington accretors at the knee of the luminosity function and at redshifts at which the quasar luminosity function is declining in amplitude imposes strong constraints on the distribution of bh fueling rates @xcite .",
    "of course , there must also be many bhs with much lower @xmath0 ( perhaps approaching zero ) , otherwise it would be hard to reconcile the local bh mass function with the observed number of agns .",
    "however , these low eddington - ratio objects do not contribute significantly to the observed agn population in the luminosity and redshift range probed by ages - i .    for high mass bhs at @xmath12",
    ", we can make these constraints more direct by computing the @xmath0 distributions at fixed bh mass .",
    "the depth of the ages - i survey is crucial in allowing us to compute histograms for @xmath145 that are unaffected by the survey magnitude limit ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : massbingood ] ) .",
    "accounting for completeness corrections , these histograms clearly decline toward both high and low @xmath0 from the peak .",
    "this peak could be further studied by the expansion of the ages survey presently underway ( ages - ii ) and the 2slaq survey , which probes to approximately the same depth as ages - i over a much wider area @xcite . however , because 2slaq agns are selected by optical colors , the effects of dust extinction may be more severe for this survey than for ages .",
    "our results strongly suggest that bhs gain most of their mass while accreting at near - eddington rates .",
    "since the height of the eddington ratio distribution falls as @xmath0 drops from 0.3 to 0.1 , any rise at lower values would have to be extremely steep to contribute more mass growth than the observed peak .",
    "the main loopholes are the possibilities that much of the growth occurs in objects that are obscured at optical wavelengths or are accreting with very low efficiency .",
    "such objects could plausibly have a different @xmath0 distribution .",
    "however , the reasonable agreement between the integrated emissivity of the optical quasar population and the local bh mass density ( @xcite ; see @xcite for a recent analysis ) suggests that any such population can not dominate by a large fraction .",
    "in fact , the @xcite analysis concluded that eddington ratios of @xmath146 at @xmath147 were required in order to obtain a good match between the emissivity from optical quasars and the local bh mass density .",
    "we also note that our agn sample is not as adversely affected by obscuration effects as most existing surveys .",
    "while the x - ray - selected agns are affected by soft x - ray absorption , the 24@xmath5-selected agns are not .",
    "furthermore , the bluest optical band used for target selection in this survey is the @xmath22-band instead of the more commonly used optical @xmath148-band .",
    "this relative immunity to obscuration will be enhanced further in the ages - ii agn sample , which will have an optical flux limit ( @xmath149 mag ) that is both at a longer wavelength and deeper .",
    "for a bh to become active , some event ( merger , tidal interaction , dynamical instability , etc . )",
    "must drive material into the central few parsecs of its host galaxy , and this inner material must then form an accretion flow onto the bh itself , on the much smaller scale of hundreds to thousands of au .",
    "the galactic - scale fueling events are likely to have a broad mass distribution , and there is no reason for them to know about the precise mass of the central bh .",
    "the sharp peak of the observed @xmath0 distribution suggests that these events are often sufficient to provide super - eddington fuel supplies and that the actual bh accretion rates are determined by the bh s self - regulation of the inner accretion flow .",
    "the narrow width ( @xmath150  dex ) and central value ( @xmath85 ) are important targets for theoretical models of accretion flows , though further investigation of the zero - point calibration of @xmath10 indicators is desirable to firm up the latter constraint .",
    "overall , the population of active bhs in the ages - i survey is simpler than one might have imagined beforehand , and explaining this simplicity is a new challenge for theories of agn evolution .",
