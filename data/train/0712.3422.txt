    "we do this for every retained subcube of @xmath21 this will yield a new random set @xmath22 iterating the procedure on every smaller scale yields an infinite sequence of random sets @xmath23^d.$ ] it is easy to see that @xmath24 is a well defined random object .",
    "we denote by @xmath25 the event that @xmath26 contains a connected component intersecting both the  left - hand face \" @xmath27^{d-1}$ ] and the  right - hand face \" @xmath28^{d-1}$ ] of @xmath1^d$ ] ( we will call such a connected component a path or crossing ) .",
    "we can then define @xmath29 we could of course have used any two opposite faces in this definition .",
    "furthermore , we define @xmath30 by a standard coupling argument it is easy to see that @xmath31 is non - decreasing in @xmath3 for every @xmath9 .",
    "several authors studied various aspects of mandelbrot s fractal percolation , including the hausdorff dimension of the limiting fractal set , as detailed in  @xcite , and the possible existence of paths  @xcite and @xmath5-dimensional  sheets \" @xcite traversing the unit cube between opposite faces .",

    "@xcite considered the behavior of @xmath12 for large @xmath9 , and proved that it converges to the critical value for bernoulli site percolation on the square lattice , as @xmath8 .",
    "this was generalized by falconer and grimmett  @xcite to all dimensions @xmath6 , where the limiting value however is not the critical value of site percolation on the ( hyper-)cubic lattice , but that of site percolation on a related lattice ( see section  [ sec - enh - dim ] ) .",
    "orzechowski  @xcite proved an analogous results for  sheet \" percolation .",

    "let us consider the model in two dimensions , where it is known  @xcite that @xmath34 is discontinuous at @xmath12 for all @xmath9 .",
    "analogously , if we tile the plane with independent copies of the system , the probability that there exists an infinite path intersecting the unit square @xmath1 ^ 2 $ ] has a discontinuity at @xmath12 for all @xmath9  @xcite .",
    "such behavior prompted the authors of  @xcite to call the phase transition in mandelbrot s fractal percolation first order or discontinuous ( although one of the authors later appeared to change his mind on the issue  see p.  130 of  @xcite ) .",
    "regardless of the label , the discontinuity of @xmath34 ( and , more generally , of @xmath31 for @xmath32 ) is an important feature of the phase transition , and it is natural to ask what happens to it as @xmath8 .",
    "we point out that the fact that @xmath33 for all @xmath3 strictly larger than the relevant ( depending on the dimension ) critical value does not shed much light on the large-@xmath9 limit of the path - crossing probability _ at _ the critical point .",
    "consider , for instance , the crossing probability of a square in ( ordinary ) two - dimensional bernoulli percolation in the scaling limit ( i.e. , as the lattice spacing goes to zero ) or equivalently in the limit of larger and larger squares .",
    "such a limit is needed to  see \" the phase transition and produce a situation that can be compared to the one in mandelbrot s fractal percolation . however , in bernoulli percolation , in the scaling limit or in the limit of larger and larger squares , the crossing probability of a square converges to one above the critical point , to zero below it , and to a value strictly between zero and one _ at _ the critical point , showing a behavior that differs from the one of the next theorem .

    "take @xmath9 very large , and consider a system with retention probability equal to @xmath13 .",

    "each subcube is retained with probability @xmath3 and discarded with probability @xmath4 , independently of all other subcubes .",

    "the result is that each closed site @xmath185 such that its two neighbors @xmath125 and @xmath126 are both open is independently declared open with probability @xmath226 , while sites that were already open simply stay open .",

    "secondly , from topological considerations one can easily conclude that ( conditioned on the event @xmath178 ) the presence of an open crossing of @xmath187 in the first coordinate in the enhancement percolation process described above implies the absence of a sheet crossing of @xmath1^d$ ] by the fractal set @xmath26 separating the two faces perpendicular to the first coordinate direction .",
