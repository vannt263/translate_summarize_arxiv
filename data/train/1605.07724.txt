    "the quest for neutrinoless double beta decay ( @xmath1 ) has experienced an interesting history  @xcite . in 1939 , combining the idea of double beta decay ( @xmath2 ) proposed by goeppert - mayer four years ago and the notion of majorana fermions formulated by majorana two years ago , furry for the first time discussed the possibility of observing two electrons but without any neutrinos during the transformation of the @xmath3 nucleus to the @xmath4 nucleus , i.e. , @xmath5 . at that time , simply based on the phase space argument , this @xmath1 mode was believed to have a half - life around @xmath6 , much shorter than that of the corresponding @xmath2 mode , @xmath7 . if such an estimation were true , one would have discovered @xmath1 quite shortly , maybe by the 1950s .",
    "the first turning point in the @xmath1 history is the discovery of parity violation in 1957 and the establishment of v - a theory , which concludes that if neutrinos were massless , @xmath1 would be exactly forbidden .",
    "such a discouraging result declared that the experimental search for @xmath1 entered the  middle ages \"  @xcite . although @xmath1 experiments were still performed in the 1960s and 1970s , the main goal was to test the lepton number conservation law . only until the early 1980s",
    "the search for @xmath1 embraced its  renaissance \" period  @xcite , mainly because the grand unified theories developed around that time can naturally generate a majorana mass term for neutrinos , and neutrinos with tens of ev masses were thought to be possible for being a good dark matter candidate in cosmology .",
    "in the current  contemporary ages \"  @xcite , the observation of neutrino oscillation , which indicates that neutrinos have masses , really boomed this field .",
    "several experiments have been built , or are under construction , and dozens of proposals are made for future investigations .",
    "such dedicated experimental efforts may enable us to extract rich physics results from @xmath1 in a near future .",
    "for example ,    * pinning down the nature of neutrinos . according to schechter - valle theorem  @xcite , the observation of @xmath1 would imply a majorana mass term for neutrinos , proving the majorana nature of neutrinos . * constraining the absolute neutrino mass scale and lepton cp - violating phases .",
    "this is because that if @xmath1 is mediated by the light neutrino majorana mass term , the decay half - life @xmath8 can then be written as @xmath9 where @xmath10 and @xmath11 stand for the phase - space factor @xcite and the nuclear matrix element ( nme ) , respectively , and @xmath12 is the so - called effective neutrino mass .",
    "although there still exist large uncertainties in the calculation of nme  @xcite , in principle , one can obtain the former two accurately within nuclear theory .",
    "then , the measured limit on the half - life @xmath8 would directly yield a constraint on @xmath12 , whose definition is given by @xmath13 where @xmath14 s are neutrino masses , and @xmath15 s and @xmath16 s are the mixing angles and cp - violating phases in the lepton mixing matrix , respectively . * determining the neutrino mass ordering .",
    "this is due to the presence of a lower bound for the above effective neutrino mass @xmath12 in the inverted neutrino mass ordering , according to the current global fit results  @xcite . *",
    "restricting new physics contributions .",
    "as @xmath1 is a rare process , any new physics that contributes to it should be constrained by the obtained data .    in this",
    "talk we focus on the question of determining neutrino mass ordering in the next generation @xmath1 experiments  @xcite .",
    "our goal is to provide a quantitative description of experimental power to distinguish between normal neutrino mass ordering ( no ) and inverted neutrino mass ordering ( io ) . for simplicity ,",
    "we only consider @xmath0ge - type experiments , as their background is found to be nearly flat in the signal region .",
    "moreover , we adopt bayesian analysis as our statistical method .          *",
    "large amount of @xmath17-decaying isotopes .",
    "the number of signal events @xmath18 is directly related to the fiducial mass of @xmath17-decaying isotopes .",
    "taking @xmath0ge for an example , we have @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the avogadro s constant , @xmath21 is the molar mass of @xmath0ge , and @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the exposure and detection efficiency , respectively . since the exposure @xmath22 is defined as the product of the fiducial mass and the experiment operating time , increasing the mass of isotopes is helpful to reduce the detection time . in table",
    "[ tb : classification ] we list the typical sizes of the fiducial mass in the previous , current and next generation @xmath1 experiments . *",
    "good energy resolution .",
    "ideally , all the above signal events should show up at the q - value of the corresponding @xmath1 process . for @xmath0ge ,",
    "such a q - value is 2039 kev .",
    "however , because of a finite energy resolution , these signal events spread out and can be easily contaminated by background events , especially those from the intrinsic @xmath2 process . because @xmath0ge - type experiments employ the ",
    "detector = studied substance \" scheme , a very high energy resolution can be reached . in this work",
    "we take fwhm ( full width half maximum ) as 3 kev . * low background .",
    "it was found that reducing the level of background is very helpful to improve the half - life sensitivity  @xcite . moreover ,",
    "if possible , one should pursue the zero background limit , so that a single @xmath1 event would be enough to pin down the majorana nature of neutrinos .",
    "for the next generation @xmath0ge - type experiments we will choose @xmath24  counts / kev / kg / yr , with bi standing for background index .",
    "bi s of other generations of @xmath1 experiments are also given in table [ tb : classification ] .",
    "* good detection efficiency .",
    "@xmath1 happens so rare that any signal event would be precious .",
    "here we take the typical value of @xmath25 for @xmath0ge - type experiments . *",
    "good scalability . by scalability we mean the ability to scale the experimental set - up to a larger size .",
    "this is very important for building a large @xmath1 experiment stage by stage .",
    "currently , we have two commissioning @xmath0ge - type @xmath1 experiments , i.e. , gerda and majorana demonstrator @xcite . in the first phase of gerda ,",
    "a lower limit of @xmath26 yr at @xmath27 confidence level was reported for an exposure of 21.6 kg  @xmath28  yr and a bi about @xmath29  @xcite .",
    "the gerda phase - ii and majorana demonstrator are expected to increase the exposure to about 200 kg  @xmath28  yr each , and to reduce bi to the @xmath30 level at the same time .",
    "more excitingly , these two collaborations are also discussing the possibility of building a future large scale @xmath0ge ( lsge ) experiment together  @xcite , which may eventually reach an exposure of around @xmath31 kg  @xmath28  yr , and @xmath32 .",
    "it is such a possibility that motivates us to perform a detailed statistical analysis , so as to find out at which level the currently undetermined neutrino mass ordering can be resolved then .",
    "we begin with generating pseudo - data samples that are to be used in the later statistical analysis . following gerda s analysis on its first phase data @xcite",
    ", we consider a region of spectrum that spans from 2022 kev to 2061 kev with a bin size of 1 kev .",
    "see fig .",
    "[ fg : spectrum ] for an example of the simulated event spectrum .",
    "red curve represents the total un - binned signal and background events , while the binned results are given by the gray histogram , where the poisson statistics is assumed .     for the @xmath33-based experiment , where the red solid curve represents the expected gaussian distribution of signal events on top of a constant background and typical values of the half life @xmath34 , the exposure @xmath35 , the energy resolution @xmath36 , and the efficiency @xmath25 have been used .",
    "the black - dashed horizontal line corresponds to the background with @xmath37 .",
    "the gray histograms stand for the total number of both signal and background events , which is randomly generated according to the poissonian distribution in each energy bin .",
    "taken from ref .",
    "[ 6 ]  @xcite . ]    in ref .",
    "[ 6 ]  @xcite , we indeed adopt the above generated spectrum , which incorporates statistical fluctuation , to perform analysis on the exclusion limit and discovery potential in the upcoming @xmath0ge - type experiments .",
    "however , for the current discussion on the determination of neutrino mass orderings , using the above statistical - fluctuation - included spectrum would be very time - consuming .",
    "this is because for each set of input parameters , one needs to generate and then analyze hundreds of pseudo - data samples so as to obtain enough statistics .    for simplicity",
    ", here we instead take the so - called asimov data set  @xcite , which is obtained by simply assuming the _ expected _ number of events for each bin in the spectrum . in terms of the example given in fig .",
    "[ fg : spectrum ] , the asimov data set just means the events under the red curve .",
    "apparently , no statistical fluctuations are included in this asimov data set .",
    "however , it was found that the analysis of the asimov data yields a good approximation to the _ median _ projection of experiments  @xcite . for our current discussion",
    "such a median projection is sufficient .",
    "we adopt bayesian analysis as our statistical method .",
    "bayesian analysis resides on the well - known bayes theorem , and describes the degree of belief in a certain hypothesis @xmath38 , given the data set @xmath39 .",
    "specifically , bayes theorem states that @xmath40 where @xmath41 and @xmath42 are the prior and posterior probabilities of the hypothesis @xmath38 , respectively .",
    "the probability of obtaining the data @xmath39 , given the hypothesis @xmath43 to be true , is denoted as @xmath44 , and is also called the evidence @xmath45 .",
    "lastly , @xmath46 stands for the overall probability of observing the data @xmath39 , and it is equal to @xmath47 , because of the normalization condition @xmath48 .    following the above formalism , we take our two competing hypotheses as @xmath49 and @xmath50 , and the above discussed pseudo - data samples would be our data set @xmath39 . to find out the more favorable hypothesis , we compute the following posterior odds @xmath51 where the ratio of evidences @xmath52 is termed bayes factor .",
    "if _ a prior _ we have no preference for a particular mass ordering , the above posterior odds is then directly reflected by the bayes factor @xmath53 .",
    "furthermore , to interpret the value of this posterior odds or the bayes factor , we adopt the jeffreys scale  @xcite given in table  [ tb : jeffreys ] .",
    "the computation of @xmath54 is performed via @xmath55 ( similar computation for @xmath56 ) .",
    "@xmath57 stands for the parameters in the hypothesis @xmath49 , and here they are three lepton mixing angles @xmath58 , two cp - violating phases @xmath59 , two neutrino mass - squared differences and the lightest neutrino mass @xmath60 .",
    "their prior probability distributions are collectively denoted as @xmath61 . for the mixing angles and mass - squared differences , we assume gaussian priors with the central values and @xmath62 errors taken from ref.[5 ]  @xcite . for cp - violating phases ,",
    "uniform priors are chosen , and for the lightest neutrino mass @xmath60 we adopt two different priors , i.e. , a uniform prior within @xmath63~\\text{ev}$ ] and a logarithmic prior on @xmath64~\\text{ev}$ ] . finally , we obtain @xmath65 by fitting the pseudo - data set with the above sampled parameters in the realm of @xmath49 .",
    "calculated by comparing between no with io , where the thick solid ( dashed ) curves correspond to the low nme @xmath66 ( the high nme @xmath67 ) .",
    "the orange , black and blue curves represent @xmath68 , @xmath69 and @xmath70 , respectively . taken from ref .  [",
    "6 ]  @xcite . ]    in fig .",
    "[ fg : nh_ih ] , the left and right panels correspond to the uniform and logarithmic priors on the lightest neutrino mass @xmath60 , respectively .",
    "given a true value of @xmath71 and an exposure @xmath72 , we can calculate the bayes factor @xmath73 , and show its contours as orange , black and blue curves for @xmath68 , @xmath69 and @xmath70 , respectively .",
    "thick solid and dashed curves distinguish two different choices of nme , i.e. , @xmath66 and @xmath74 for the former and later , respectively . for reference , we also plot the lower bound of @xmath75 in io , i.e. , the red horizontal line represents the result calculated by using the best - fit values of neutrino mixing parameters , while the dark ( light ) band is for the result by using @xmath62 ( @xmath76 ) ranges .      * an exposure of at least @xmath77 ( or @xmath78 ) kg  @xmath28  yr is needed in order to report a weak ( or moderate ) evidence for no . according to the jeffreys scale in table  [ tb : jeffreys ]",
    ", the weak and strong evidence should be understood as a degree of belief of @xmath79 and @xmath80 , respectively .",
    "* in the next generation of @xmath0ge - based @xmath1 experiments with an exposure of @xmath81 , we are only able to reach a value of @xmath82 , indicating a moderate evidence for no . to obtain a strong evidence ( @xmath83",
    ", one needs to further increase the exposure or reduce the level of background .",
    "the question of whether neutrino is its own anti - particle , namely , the nature of neutrino , leads to a long history of searching for @xmath1 experimentally .",
    "in the course of such a dedicated search , one also realizes that studying @xmath1 may help us distinguish the currently unresolved neutrino mass ordering .",
    "motivated by the latter fact , we perform a detailed quantitative analysis , aiming at finding out at which statistical level one can exclude the inverted neutrino mass ordering in the next generation @xmath0ge - type @xmath1 experiments .",
    "our finding indicates that the next generation @xmath0ge - type @xmath1 experiments indeed has some sensitivity to the discrimination of neutrino mass orderings , however , not in a very decisive manner .",
