    "the same experiment also uncovered new deviations ( larger than @xmath15 ) in the @xmath16 branching ratio ( at low and large @xmath17 recoil )  @xcite .",
    "a few months ago , the belle experiment performed an independent measurement of @xmath11  @xcite : the value , compatible with the lhcb measurements , agrees again poorly with the theory expectations in the sm .",
    "another interesting tension was observed in the ratio @xmath18 @xmath19 indicating that this deviation would affect predominantly @xmath20 compared to @xmath21  @xcite , and thus violate lepton - flavour universality .",
    "this difference among lepton modes was also supported by the fact that no deviation was observed in @xmath22 data at very large @xmath23 recoil  @xcite .",
    "very recently , belle has presented a separate measurement  @xcite of @xmath11 in the muon and electron channels , and hence of the observable @xmath24 proposed in ref .",
    "while the muon channel exhibits a 2.6 @xmath10 deviation with respect to the sm prediction  @xcite and in good agreement with the lhcb measurement , the electron channel agrees with the sm expectation at 1.3 @xmath10 .",
    "though it is not yet statistically significant , the result could point to a violation of lepton - flavour universality in @xmath11 in compliance with the one measured in @xmath25 . if this result is confirmed by lhcb with higher statistics and also other tensions in new experimental measurements of lepton flavour universality ratios , like the promising @xmath26 @xmath27  @xcite ,",
    "are detected , this would hamper any attempt to explain the @xmath11 anomaly in terms of non - perturbative qcd effects .",
    "it is striking that all the above - mentioned deviations can be alleviated simultaneously by a common mechanism , namely by a new physics ( np ) contribution to the short - distance coefficient of the semi - leptonic operator @xmath28 , i.e. to the vector component of the @xmath29 transition in the effective hamiltonian describing these transitions at the @xmath30-quark scale .",

    "then the observables are computed at each point of the scan and their error bars were obtained in dhmv14  @xcite computing the difference between the extreme values obtained for the observables in the scan with respect to the central value of the observable .",
    "the corresponding scan of parameters in bsz15  @xcite yields smaller errors than the ones in dhmv14 due to the much smaller uncertainties of the form factor inputs and the gaussian treatment of all errors in bsz15 .",
    "let us also remark that the _ total error _ in bbd14  @xcite in the nominal - prior evaluation is in the same ballpark as the one in dhmv14 .    on the other hand , it is interesting to notice that the parametric uncertainty ( including form factors ) in cj12  @xcite is 2 to 3 times larger than the one in dhmv14  @xcite and bsz15  @xcite , respectively .",
    "this issue is independent of and adds to the inflation of errors associated to factorisable power corrections by a factor of 2 due to the choice of scheme , as is discussed in sec .",

    "[ tab : p5p16 ] .",
    "let us also mention that in a subsequent article ( cj14 , ref .",
    "@xcite ) by the same authors , the total error for the same bin increased by 40% with respect to to the previous prediction in cj12 . in a later article from the belle collaboration  @xcite ,",
    "the prediction for the same quantity , provided by one of the authors of cj12 and cj14 , got an uncertainty reduced by 60% compared to cj14 ( see table vi of ref .",
    "unfortunately the absence of a precise error budget in refs .",
    "@xcite prevents us from exploiting the corresponding results for our comparison .",
    "moreover , we are not in a position to explain the origin of the 40% increase and subsequent 60% decrease in these two articles , which is unfortunately not commented on in either case .",
    "one might suspect that the origin of this large difference between the error attached to parametric and soft form - factor uncertainties in dhmv14 , bsz15 and bbd14 on one side and cj12 and cj14 on the other could be the error attached to the soft form factor .",
    "however , the uncertainty for @xmath181 in cj14 , estimated by considering _ only the central values _ of different form factor determinations , is even significantly smaller ( by a factor around 4 ) than the one for @xmath182 in dhmv14 from the calculation in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in summary , in addition to the inflated power correction error related to an inappropriate choice of scheme , discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : bszfit ] , we conclude that the analysis of the parametric errors in cj12 is at odds with the results of three different groups ( dhmv14 , bsz15 , bbd14 ) .",
    "as discussed in the introduction and in section 5.3 , it is of utmost importance to have observables able to test lepton - flavour universality . among this type of observables , @xmath25  @xcite and the recently measured @xmath3  @xcite are already providing very interesting information . following",
    "the structure of @xmath25 one can construct observables with similar capacities for other channels . because of the anomalies observed in the @xmath183 mode  @xcite , the observable @xmath26 @xmath27  @xcite becomes a natural candidate to analyse . in this appendix",
