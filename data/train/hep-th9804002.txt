    "dyson - schwinger equations ( dses ) provide a viable method for studying the non - perturbative behaviour of field theories . in gauge field theories in particular , a common technique is to analyse the fermion propagator by truncating the infinite tower of dses at the level of the propagator dses .",
    "one then implements an intelligent ansatz for the gauge boson propagator and boson - fermion vertex function@xcite .    for quantum electrodynamics in either three ( qed3 ) or four ( qed4 ) dimensions , there has for some years now been an ongoing programme of improving the ansatz for the fermion - photon vertex@xcite .",
    "a principal goal of this programme is to invent an ansatz which respects the gauge covariance of green s functions in accordance with the transformation properties discovered by landau and khalatnikov ( lk)@xcite .",
    "it has traditionally been common practice in dse studies of qed3 or qed4 to assume , either implicitly or explicitly , that in the quenched ( i.e. @xmath0 ) , massless limit , the dses admit the trivial solution of bare fermion propagator and bare vertex in landau gauge@xcite . in the case of qed4 , this assumption has recently been questioned by by bashir et al.@xcite , who use the one - loop perturbative correction to the vertex@xcite to model an unknown additional transverse part of the vertex .    in this paper",
    "we explore the problem of constructing a viable vertex ansatz for the case of qed3 , without recourse to the above simplifying assumption . we choose to work with qed3 rather than its four dimensional counterpart because its benign ultraviolet properties render the integrals we encounter finite , obviating the need for awkward numerical regularisations .",
    "the four component version of massless qed3 which we consider here has an interesting chiral - like @xmath1 symmetry which , if dynamically broken , leads to dynamical mass generation .",
    "the evidence from both dse and lattice calculations , suggest that this is almost certainly the case , at least for small numbers of fermion flavours@xcite . here , however , we shall be considering the chirally symmetric solutions , which must also respect the lk transformations , and can therefore be used to place restrictions on the allowed form of the vertex ansatz .",
    "we shall demonstrate the existence of a gauge in which massless qed3 admits a bare fermion propagator solution , though this may not be landau gauge , even in the quenched case .",
    "the vertex function decomposes into two parts , an in principle known part which reduces to the bare vertex in the gauge mentioned , and an extra , unknown transverse part . by studying the gauge parameter dependence of the photon polarisation scalar , we construct a computationally viable vertex ansatz for the first of these two parts .",
    "the massless fermion dse for qed3 in euclidean momentum space is @xmath2 where the euclidean @xmath3 matrices satisfy @xmath4 .",
    "@xmath5 is the photon propagator which , for the class of covariant , nonlocal gauges and for @xmath6 fermion flavours takes the form @xmath7 where @xmath8 the gauge choice @xmath9 with @xmath10 constant , defines the usual covariant gauge .",

    "any terms containing even numbers of dirac matrices would need to conspire to produce contributions to the final term in eq .",

    "we shall therefore assume that only the four @xmath22 listed in the appendix contribute to @xmath15 in the chirally symmetric sector .",
    "we also adopt the position that a useful ansatz should be such that the @xmath17 have no dependence on the gauge fixing function @xmath23 other than that entering implicitly via a functional dependence on other green s functions ( such as the @xmath24 dependence in @xmath25 ) .",
    "this allows one to exploit gauge covariance of the solutions of the dse as a constraint on the functions @xmath17 .",
    "then one can always impose gauge covariance on solutions of the dses by fiat as follows : first arbitrarily specify a vertex ansatz @xmath26 of the form of eq .",

    "form invariance of the dses under lk transformations then ensures that any propagator solution will automatically have the desired lk transformation properties .",
    "since our choice of landau gauge vertex was arbitrary , a constraint demanding the gauge covariance of propagator solutions then becomes vacuous . ]",
    "the ball - chiu vertex is arrived at by requiring that the following criteria be satisfied : + ( a ) it should satisfy the ward - takahashi identity ( wti ) : @xmath28 , + ( b ) it should satisfy the ward identity : @xmath29 , or equivalently , be free of kinematic singularities as @xmath30 and + ( c ) it must have the same transformation properties as the bare vertex @xmath31 under lorentz transformations and charge conjugation .    in many papers dealing with qed dses @xcite the vertex function is effectively assumed to be restricted by a further condition , namely : + ( d ) it must reduce to the bare vertex ( i.e. @xmath15 reduces to zero ) when dressed propagators are replaced by bare propagators .",

    "@xcite pennington et al . argue that restriction ( d ) is not justified in qed4 , and indeed not consistent with perturbation theory .",
    "likewise , we have no reason to assume in qed3 that condition ( d ) is valid or that the bare fermion propagator is a solution to the quenched theory in landau gauge . in fact , the vertex function is in principle determined by the vertex dse @xmath37_{dc }         k_{cd , ba}(q + \\ell , p + \\ell,\\ell ) ,    \\label{vdse}\\ ] ] where the kernel @xmath38 is a sum of skeleton graphs containing the dressed fermion and photon propagators and dressed vertex function .",

    "we therefore expect the full vertex to be functionally dependent on just the fermion propagator , and , more specifically , for both @xmath39 and @xmath41 to be determined if the fermion propagator is specified to be the bare propagator .",
    "one is tempted to ask whether there may nonetheless be some ( possibly nonlocal ) gauge in which the bare propagator is the solution to the fermion dse .",
    "such a scenario has been suggested by a number of authors in the context of the nonquenched theory@xcite . in these studies , however , the vertex ansatz is taken either to be the bare vertex or a scalar function multiplied by the bare vertex . in either case condition ( d )",
    "is satisfied and in the quenched limit the desired gauge leading to a trivial solution is landau gauge . here",
    "we demonstrate the existence of a nonlocal gauge in which the fermion dse is solved by the bare propagator without assuming condition ( d ) .",
