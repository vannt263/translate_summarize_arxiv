    "rare earth ( re ) ions are widely studied for numerous optical applications such as solar cells @xcite , optical amplification , biolabelling @xcite but also photodynamic therapy of cancer @xcite .",
    "although they present high quantum efficiencies , they could suffer from low absorption cross - section @xcite ( around @xmath0 ) so that metal enhanced fluorescence ( mef ) has been proposed to improve their emission properties .",
    "metal enhanced spectroscopies rely on the excitation and/or emission exaltation by coupling emitters to a plasmonic particle .",
    "this has been extensively studied , notably for tip or surface enhanced raman scattering ( ters / sers ) @xcite or dye fluorescence enhancement @xcite .",
    "practically , the highest signal enhancement is achieved for low initial absorption cross  section _ and _ quantum yield , since both excitation and emissions processes are enhanced . sun _",
    "et al _ described sers as photoluminescence enhancement in the limit of null initial absorption cross section and quantum yield @xcite .",
    "therefore , sers presents the highest enhancement ( up to @xmath1 ) @xcite whereas mef is typically of few tens only @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the results achieved for dye molecules can not be directly transposed to rare - earth ions which present extremelly low absorption cross - section but quantum efficiency close to unity on the contrary to dyes which present high absorption cross - section , and generally lower quantum efficiency .",
    "in addition , it is worthwhile to note that lanthanides luminescence is also extremelly sensitive to the surroundings so that identifying the role of plasmon is a difficult task .    a large number of works , mainly experimental @xcite , but also theoretical @xcite ,",
    "have been realized in order to probe the possibility to enhance optical properties of rare earth ions placed near metal nanoparticles .",
    "some recent works have highlighted that gold or silver metal nanoparticle could change the selection rules of rare earth ions emission @xcite but the localized plasmon contribution remains in discussion .",
    "indeed , it is very difficult to separate respective roles of plasmon and energy transfer in the observed enhancement of re ions luminescence @xcite .",
    "plasmon mediated enhancement relies on antenna effect that increases the excitation field and/or radiative emission rate @xcite , whereas energy transfer is a dipole - dipole frster - like mechanism between the metal nanocrystal ( donor or sensitizer ) and re ions ( acceptor ) @xcite .",
    "it has been observed that energy transfer is at the origin of luminescence enhancement near small gold and silver clusters composed by few atoms ( crystal size of few nm ) @xcite .",
    "however , larger metal particles ( typically few tens of nm ) are generally preferred for plasmon - enhanced fluorescence@xcite . recently , ma _",
    "et al _ measured 3-fold and 24-fold enhancement factor for @xmath2 doped silver core - shell nanoparticles with 20 nm core/15 nm shell and 9 nm core/11 nm shell , respectively @xcite . however , they used @xmath3 nm excitation wavelength far from the dipolar resonance so that we think that the enhancement mechanism is different from plasmon enhanced spectroscopy and most likely originates from energy transfer .",
    "two others groups reported 3 fold enhancement for @xmath2 ions coupled to about 30 nm silver particles when excited close to the silver dipolar resonance @xcite . in a former work , malta and couto dos santos have made a rough estimation of the possible emission enhancement for europium ions doped glasses containing silver nanoparticles @xcite .",
    "they estimated up to 50-fold maximum _ local _ enhancement factor for 30 nm silver particles but not conclude about the global enhancement of the overall doped shell .",
    "the purpose of this work is to theoretically determine and optimize the plasmon contribution to the luminescence enhancement in plasmonic nanoparticle doped with lanthanides .",
    "particular attention is devoted to describe an ensemble of rare earth ions coupled to a metallic nanoparticle instead of single emitter coupled to one particle as generally done since we are interested in the optical response of the whole doped nanostructure . in a first time , we investigate the role of the localized plasmons supported by the nanoparticle and determine the optimal particle resonance position compared to the emitter absorption and emission peak . to this end , we define in section [ sect : aef ] , the average fluorescence factor for a doped plasmonic core - shell particle of arbitrary shape . for comparison purpose , we illustrate the enhancement mechanism by considering a laser dye , namely the rhodamine 6 g ( rh6 g ) coupled to a spherical metal particle @xcite . in a second time , in section [ sect : rareearth ] , we investigate the fluorescence enhancement for rare earth ions emitting in the visible or the near infrared and placed in the shell of core - shell particles with metal core .",
    "we will thus estimate the achievable plasmonic enhancement .",
