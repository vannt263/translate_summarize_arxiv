    "frictional motion plays a central role in diverse systems and phenomena that span vast ranges of scales , from the nanometer contacts inherent in micro- and nanomachines @xcite and biological molecular motors @xcite to the geophysical scales characteristic of earthquakes @xcite .",
    "due to its enormous practical and technological importance , the problem has stimulated progress over the centuries .",
    "historical figures from leonardo da vinci onwards have brought friction into the field of physics , with the formulation of time - honored phenomenological frictional laws , which have been referred to as the coulomb - amontons laws .",
    "these statements can be briefly summarized as follows : ( i ) frictional force is independent of the apparent area of contact ; ( ii ) frictional force is proportional to the normal load ; ( iii ) kinetic friction ( the force to keep relative motion at constant speed ) does not depend on the sliding velocity and is smaller than static friction ( the force needed to initiate motion between two contacting bodies at rest ) .",
    "also in the light of a mass of empirical data , serious attempts were made in the first half of the 20th century toward a microscopic understanding of these laws @xcite . whereas the basic physics underlying sliding friction  non equilibrium statistical mechanics of solids , sheared fluids , and moving surfaces  is in principle quite exciting , the field as a whole has ( even if with notable exceptions ) failed to attract adequate interest by the physicist until the last few decades .",
    "a lack of microscopic data , and a corresponding lack of theory , have perhaps contributed to project an unattractive image of sliding friction .",
    "three quiet revolutions , of broad nature and unrelated to friction , are radically changing this state of affairs .",
    "first , progress in the general area of complexity provided new tools to tackle non - equilibrium disordered systems with interacting degrees of freedom .",
    "second , and crucial , the developments in nanotechnology extended the study of friction and permitted its analysis on well - characterized materials and surfaces at the nano- and microscale .",
    "notably the invention of scanning tip instruments of the atomic force microscope ( afm ) family @xcite has opened _ nanofriction _ as a brand new avenue ; the use of the surface force apparatus ( sfa ) @xcite has led to the systematic studies of confined mesoscopic systems under shear ; while instruments such as the quartz crystal microbalance ( qcm ) @xcite measure the inertial sliding friction of adsorbate submonolayers .",
    "thanks to these methods , a mass of fresh data and information on well defined systems , surfaces , materials , physical conditions has accumulated in the last two decades @xcite .",
    "the resulting insights into the atomic size contacts themselves in terms of chemical interactions and of the elementary processes that are involved in the excitation and dissipation of energy are changing our perspective .",
    "third , computer simulations have had a strong boost , also allowed by the fantastic growth of computer power .",
    "the numerical study of frictional models on one hand , and direct atomistic molecular dynamics simulations on the other hand , are jointly advancing our theoretical understanding .",
    "invaluable initial reviews of the progress brought about by these revolutions in our physical understanding of sliding friction can be found in the books by @xcite and @xcite .    despite the practical and fundamental importance of friction and the growing efforts in the field ,",
    "many key aspects of dynamics of friction are not yet well understood . even for the most studied nanoscale systems , such as afm sliding on graphite or nacl surfaces , a microscopic mechanism of friction is still lacking , and experimental observations ( for instance , velocity and temperature dependencies of friction ) have been rationalized within simplified models including empirical parameters @xcite .",
    "fundamental theory is still difficult in all fields of sliding friction , including nanofriction , since the sliding motion generally involves sudden nonlinear stick - slip events , that can not be treated within traditional theoretical approaches such as linear - response theory and hydrodynamics",
    ". experiments in tribology have long suffered from the inability to directly observe what takes place at a sliding interface .",
    "although afm , sfa and qcm techniques have identified many friction phenomena on the nanoscale , many interpretative pitfalls still result from indirect or ex situ characterization of contact surfaces . in this colloquium",
    "we will briefly cover some aspects , progress and problems in the current modeling and simulation of sliding friction , from nano to mesoscale .",
    "in nanoscale friction we consider systems that are small enough to be treated at the atomistic scale , such as in the afm experiments . for larger systems",
    "we need a mesoscopic approach that lies in between the atomistic details and the macroscopic behavior . in the spirit of a colloquium",
    "we intend to draw examples from our own experience to illustrate some of the concepts and points of interest , growth , and doubt in selected forefront areas .",
    "one of the main difficulties in understanding and predicting frictional response is the intrinsic complexity of highly non - equilibrium processes going on in any tribological contact , which include detachment and reattachment of multiple microscopic junctions ( bonds ) between the surfaces in relative motion while still in contact @xcite therefore friction is intimately related to instabilities that occur on a local microscopic scale , inducing an occasional fast motion of the corresponding degrees of freedom even if the slider s center - of - mass velocity is extremely small . understanding the physical nature of these instabilities is crucial for the elucidation of the mechanism of friction , as we will emphasize below .",
    "sliding friction has been addressed following different types of theoretical approaches : `` minimalistic '' models ( mm ) atomistic molecular dynamics ( md ) simulations , mesoscopic multicontact models and phenomenological rate - state ( rs ) models .",
    "mms are discussed in sec .",
    "[ models : sec ] .",
    "they provide an intermediate level description between atomic scale physics and macroscopic phenomenological approaches like rs models , focusing on a small number of relevant degrees of freedom which describe the sliding motion , and exhibit instabilities during stick - slip .",
    "applications of mms provided explanations for phenomena of high complexity [ see , e.g. , @xcite ] . on the whole , mms are playing a major role in rationalizing the wealth of nano and mesoscale friction data produced over the last decades .",
    "atomistic md simulations , discussed in sec .",
    "[ md : sec ] , have a wide range of applicability in nanoscale friction , and have reached a high level of rigor and accuracy @xcite .",
    "but , as discussed in sec .  [ sizeissues : sec ] , they are mostly limited to time and length scales which are too short to emulate many tribological phenomena .",
    "an important issue , therefore , is how to reduce the large - scale , many - parameter md equations to simpler mesoscale descriptions based on fewer degrees of freedom .",
    "multicontact models , discussed in sec .",
    "[ multicontact : sec ] , provide such a simplified description in terms of dynamical formation and rupture of elastically coupled contacts . at the largest macroscopic scale , phenomenological rs models simplify the description even further , introducing one or two dynamical equations with coefficients chosen to fit experimental quantities and then used to describe a wide range of observed frictional behavior , such as the transition between stick - slip ( regular or chaotic ) and smooth sliding @xcite , and variations of friction for a sudden change of velocity @xcite .",
    "rs models are often the best available approaches to describe macroscopic friction in the ordinary world , from the microsize @xcite to larger and larger scales @xcite .",
    "however , most of the `` state variables '' in rs models can not be easily related to physical system properties , a fact that limits the insight and predictive power of these models .",
    "this colloquium is limited to nano and mesoscale frictional modeling , and will not further deal with rs models ; the latter are well covered for example by @xcite .",
    "instead , sec .  [ special : sec ] will present theoretical case studies with model descriptions of a few examples of nanofrictional phenomena , such as electronic friction , magnetic dissipation , carbon nanotube tribology . for a closer and fresh perception of where the field stands we will also include a partial and incomplete list of problems that , in our perspective , still stand out for future theoretical study in friction and nanofriction .",
    "the prandtl - tomlinson ( pt ) model @xcite , which we discuss here in some detail , is the most successful and influential mm so far suggested for description of nanoscale friction .",
    "in particular it addresses friction force microscopy ( ffm ) where friction forces are measured by dragging an afm tip along a surface .",
    "qualitative conclusions drawn with this model provide guidance to understand friction at the nanoscale , that often retain their validity in more advanced models and md simulations .",
    "pt assumes that a point mass @xmath0 ( mimicking e.g. , the afm tip ) is dragged over a one - dimensional sinusoidal potential representing the interaction between the tip and a crystalline substrate .",
    "the point tip is pulled by a spring of effective elastic constant @xmath1 , extending between the tip position @xmath2 and the position of the microscope support stage , that is driven with a constant velocity @xmath3 relative to the substrate , see fig .",
    "[ fig : modelpt]a",
    ". thus the total potential experienced by the tip consists of two parts : ( i ) the tip - substrate interaction , and ( ii ) the elastic interaction between the tip and the support , and can be written as @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the amplitude , @xmath6 is the periodicity of the tip - substrate potential .",
    "note that in an afm experiment the real `` spring constant '' mimicked by @xmath1 in the pt model is not only due to the torsional stiffness of the cantilever but includes also the contribution from the lateral stiffness of the contact .",
    "there is no attempt in the model to describe realistically the energy dissipation into the substrate ( joule heat ) and all dissipation is described by a viscous - like force @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is a damping coefficient .",
    "the instantaneous lateral friction force measured in ffm experiments reads @xmath9 , and the kinetic friction @xmath10 is the time average of @xmath11 .",
    "the pt model predicts two different modes for the tip motion , depending on the dimensionless parameter @xmath12 , which represents the ratio between the stiffnesses of the tip - substrate potential and the pulling spring .",
    "when @xmath13 the total potential @xmath14 exhibits only one minimum and the time - dependent sliding motion is smooth ; for @xmath15 two or more minima appear in @xmath14 , and the sliding is discontinuous , characterized by stick - slip , fig .",
    "[ fig : modelpt]b .",
    "the value @xmath16 represents the transition from smooth sliding to slips by one lattice site ( single - slip regime ) .",
    "physically , stick - slip motion corresponds to jumps of the tip between successive minima of @xmath14 , due to instabilities induced by the driving spring ( @xmath17 ) .",
    "close to the inflection point the height of the barrier preventing the tip sliding decreases with the applied force , as @xmath18 @xcite this type of externally induced topological change in a free energy landscape is known as a fold catastrophe , and it has been found in many driven systems , including superconducting quantum interference devices @xcite , mechanically deformed glasses @xcite and stretched proteins @xcite .",
    "the simulation results obtained for diverse systems show that the fold catastrophe scaling is in fact accurate not only in the immediate vicinity of the inflection point but over reasonably large intervals of loads .",
    "the possibility of slips of higher multiplicity ( multiple - slip regime ) occurs for larger values of @xmath19 @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that this is a necessary but not sufficient condition to observe multiple slips , since the observed dynamics depends also on the damping coefficient @xmath8 . in particular , for @xmath19 one can distinguish between the overdamped regime of motion , @xmath20 , where the tip jumps between nearest - neighbor minima of the potential , and the underdamped regime , @xmath21 , where the tip may perform multiple slips over a number of lattice sites and even overshoot the lowest well of the potential @xmath14 . in that case",
    "the minimal spring force reached during stick - slip oscillations is negative .",
    "the elastic instability occurring for @xmath15 results in a nonzero value of the low - velocity kinetic friction that is given by the energy drop from the point of instability to the next minimum of the potential divided by @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "for @xmath13 this instability does not exist , friction is viscous , and @xmath22 for @xmath23 .",
    "the emergence of static friction can be interpreted as the arousal of a saddle - node bifurcation as a function of @xmath24 , realizing a sort of fold - catastrophe scenario @xcite .",
    "note that in real systems at finite temperature , hysteresis and dissipation must always disappear in the zero - speed limit of adiabatic sliding , where stick - slip instabilities are preempted by thermal fluctuations .",
    "this regime , sometimes termed thermolubricity , is addressed in sect .",
    "[ thermalpt : sec ] , particularly by eq .  .",
    "in experiment , the effective value of the pt parameter @xmath24 can be controlled by the variation of the normal load on the contact , which changes the potential corrugation @xmath5 more than the contact stiffness .",
    "ffm experiments at low normal loads indeed demonstrated smooth sliding with ultralow friction , connected to the absence of elastic instabilities @xcite . at higher loads instead , `` atomic '' stick - slip took place with the atomic periodicity of the substrate lattice , while increasing load ( corresponding to increasing @xmath5 ) further led to a multiple slip regime as predicted by the pt model , see fig .",
    "[ fig : modelpt]c .",
    "several generalizations of the original , one - dimensional pt model have marked new steps toward understanding and implementation of frictional phenomena .",
    "these extensions included considerations of :    two - dimensional structure of surfaces that led to the introduction of frictional imaging of interfaces @xcite ;    thermal fluctuations that allowed to understand an origin of velocity dependence of friction and introduced a new regime of friction , named `` thermolubricity '' @xcite ;    coupling between normal and lateral motion of the slider @xcite that led to a new approach to control friction and wear by modulating the normal load @xcite ;    flexibility of the afm tip apex that led to a predictions of new regimes of motion exhibiting complex stick - slip patterns @xcite .",
    "deferring some of these points bearing contact with the frenkel - kontorova model , we focus first on the effect of temperature on friction",
    ".      the main aspects of thermal effects on friction were considered in the pioneering work by @xcite .",
    "thermal effects can be incorporated into the model by adding a thermal random force @xmath25 to the conservative force between the slider and substrate and the damping term @xmath26 .",
    "then the tip motion is described by the following langevin equation @xmath27 the random force should satisfy the fluctuation - dissipation theorem ; as usual , it is chosen with zero mean @xmath28 and @xmath29-correlated : @xmath30 where @xmath31 denotes the boltzmann constant and @xmath32 temperature .",
    "the random forces and the damping term arise from interactions with phonons and/or other fast excitations that are not treated explicitly .    in the thermal pt model , eqs .   and ,",
    "beside the pt - parameter @xmath33 , thermal fluctuations bring out a new dimensionless parameter @xmath29 representing the ratio between the pulling rate @xmath34 and the characteristic rate of thermally activated jumps over the potential barriers , @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is the attempt frequency @xcite . as a result one should distinguish between two regimes of motion : ( _ i _ ) @xmath37 , regime of very low velocities or high temperatures ( typically @xmath38  nm / s at room temperature ) , where the tip has enough time to jump back and forth across the barrier , and ( _ ii _ ) @xmath39 , stick - slip regime of motion , where thermal fluctuations only occasionally assist the tip to cross the barrier before the elastic instability is reached . in these two regimes",
    "the following expressions for kinetic friction have been suggested @xcite : @xmath40 @xmath41 here @xmath42 is the athermal ( @xmath43 ) low - velocity limit of friction , @xmath44 is the equilibrium damping felt by the tip that is independent of the ad - hoc damping coefficient @xmath8 , and @xmath45 , @xmath46 are positive constants which depend on @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath6 , @xmath5 and @xmath8 but not on @xmath3 and @xmath32 .",
    "equation , describing the slow friction regime called thermolubricity @xcite , corresponds to the linear - response regime , while eq .",
    "has been derived assuming that thermally activated depinning still occurs in the vicinity of the athermal instability point . the velocity and temperature dependencies of friction force predicted by eq .",
    "result from the fold catastrophe scaling of the potential barriers , @xmath18 , which has been discussed in the previous section .",
    "furthermore , in between the two regimes described by eqs .",
    "and one should observe a logarithmic dependence of @xmath10 on velocity .",
    "however , it is very difficult to distinguish between @xmath47^{2/3}$ ] and simple @xmath48 behavior in experiments and numerical simulations @xcite . the logarithmic ( or @xmath49^{2/3}$ ] ) regime tends to span many decades , until @xmath3 becomes so large that the inertial or viscous - like effects set in .",
    "the @xmath50^{2/3}}$ ] dependence of the average rupture force has been also found in single - molecule unbinding experiments where the energy landscape of complex biomolecules is probed by applying time - dependent forces @xcite .",
    "the theoretical framework outlined above has explained a number of ffm experimental results on single crystal surfaces @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the statistical distribution of friction forces was measured to match predictions from the pt model @xcite .",
    "these results provide strong evidence that atomic stick - slip in ffm is attributable to thermally activated slip out of a local minimum as described by the pt model .",
    "thermally activated stick - slip friction is only seen in md at sufficiently low speeds , which are so far only achievable through accelerated md @xcite . at higher speeds",
    ", friction is mostly determined by dissipative athermal dynamical processes , which correspond to a fundamentally different regime of sliding .",
    "this limits severely the regime of validity of comparisons of the pt model with md simulations .",
    "equations   and also predicts that kinetic friction should decrease with increasing temperature @xcite .",
    "thermal excitations in fact help overcome energy barriers and reduce the stick - slip jump magnitude , so that nanofriction should decrease with temperature provided no other surface or material parameters are altered by temperature @xcite . up to now , most ffm measurements have been performed at room temperature , so that the temperature dependence of nanoscale friction has rarely been addressed in experimental work .",
    "recent experimental results @xcite , however , strongly disagree with the predictions of eqs .   and .",
    "friction forces exhibit a peak at cryogenic temperatures for different classes of materials , including amorphous , crystalline , and layered surfaces .",
    "can this effect be explained within the pt model ?",
    "recent analysis of the thermal pt model @xcite demonstrated that the friction force may indeed exhibit a peak in the interval of temperatures corresponding to a transition from a multiple - slip regime of motion , at low @xmath32 , to the single - slip regime at higher @xmath32 . in this picture , interplay between thermally activated jumps over potential barriers and the reduction of the slip spatial extension with @xmath32 may lead to a nonmonotonic temperature dependence of friction .",
    "however , the pt model fails to reproduce the observed features of the temperature and velocity dependencies of kinetic friction , and of the force traces measured with atomic resolution .",
    "the basic model describing the sliding of crystalline interfaces is the one - dimensional frenkel - kontorova ( fk ) model , see @xcite and references therein .",
    "first analytically treated by @xcite and then introduced to describe dislocations in solids @xcite , the fk model found subsequently a wide area of applications , in particular , in surface physics , where it is often used to unravel the physical behavior of adsorbed monolayers , specifically to address competing incommensurate periodicities .",
    "the standard fk model hamiltonian is @xmath51,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] describing a 1d chain of @xmath52 harmonically coupled classical `` atoms '' subjected to a sinusoidal potential , see fig .",
    "[ fig : fkmodel ] . the first term in eq .",
    "is the kinetic energy of the chain , the second one describes the harmonic interaction of the nearest neighbors in the chain with elastic constant @xmath1 and equilibrium distance @xmath53 , and the last term is the interaction of the chain particles with the periodic potential of magnitude @xmath5 and periodicity @xmath54 .",
    "static friction is probed by driving all atoms with an extra adiabatically increasing force @xmath11 until sliding initiates .",
    "tribological processes in the fk model are ruled by kink ( topological soliton ) excitations .",
    "consider the simplest case of the trivial commensurate ground state when the number of atoms @xmath52 coincides with the number of minima of the substrate potential @xmath55 , so that the dimensionless concentration @xmath56 is 1 . in this case , adding ( or subtracting ) one extra atom results in a chain configuration with a kink ( or an antikink ) excitation .",
    "after relaxation , the minimum - energy configuration corresponds to a local compression ( or extension in the antikink case ) of the chain .",
    "kinks are important because they move along the chain far more easily than atoms : the activation energy for kink motion ( the peierls - nabarro barrier ) is always smaller or much smaller than the amplitude @xmath5 of the substrate potential .",
    "the relevance of topological defects for slip can be understood going back to the pioneering work by frenkel on the shear strength of crystalline solids @xcite .",
    "frenkel estimated the ideal plastic yield stress of a crystal as the stress needed to displace one atomic plane by one lattice spacing .",
    "this calculation leads to an estimate for the yield stress which is of the order of the shear modulus .",
    "the result is in contradiction with experiments which typically show much smaller results .",
    "the reason for this discrepancy is rooted in the presence of dislocations which can be displaced by much smaller stresses , leading to plastic deformation much earlier than in the perfect - crystal limit . in ideal conditions ,",
    "the only barrier to dislocation motion is the peierls - nabarro stress due to the periodic lattice and this is typically orders of magnitude smaller than the shear modulus .",
    "because the kinks ( antikinks ) correspond to extra atoms ( vacancies ) , their motion provides a mechanism for mass transport along the chain and are thus responsible for mobility , conductivity , and diffusivity .",
    "the higher the concentration of kinks , the higher will be the system mobility @xcite .",
    "when the ground state is commensurate ( i.e. , @xmath57 ) , at nonzero temperature , the first step to initiate motion in the fk model is the creation of a kink - antikink pair , see fig .",
    "[ kinks ] .",
    "when the elastic layer is of finite extension , kinks are usually generated at one end of the chain and then propagate along the chain until disappearing at the other free end .",
    "each run of the kink ( antikink ) through the chain results in the shift of the whole chain by one lattice constant @xmath54 . in the case of a finite film confined between two solids ,",
    "one may similarly expect that the onset of sliding is initiated by the creation of a local compression ( kink , misfit dislocation ) at the boundary of the contact , while kink s motion is the basic mechanism of sliding .    a crucial role in the fk model",
    "is played by incommensurability and the _ aubry transition _ @xcite connected with it .",
    "let the substrate period @xmath54 and the natural period of the chain @xmath53 be such that , in the limit of infinite system s length , their ratio @xmath58 is irrational .",
    "roughly speaking , in this case the fk chain acquires a `` staircase '' deformation , with regions of approximate commensurability separated by regularly spaced kinks ( or antikinks if @xmath59 ) .",
    "if there is a nonzero probability to find particles arbitrarily close to the maximum potential energy @xmath5 these kinks are unpinned and mobile , otherwise they are pinned @xcite . for a fixed amplitude of the substrate potential @xmath5 , the fk ground state undergoes a transition between these two states ( the aubry transition ) at a critical value @xmath60 of the chain stiffness .",
    "@xmath61 depends dramatically and discontinuously on the incommensurability ratio @xmath62 defining the interface .",
    "in particular , it has been proven that @xmath61 takes the minimal possible value equal to @xmath63 [ in units of @xmath64 for the ratio equal to the irrational golden mean @xmath65 @xcite . from a physical point of view , this means that for @xmath66 there is a continuum set of ground states that can be reached adiabatically by the chain through nonrigid displacements of its atoms at no energy cost ( _ sliding mode _ ) . on the other hand for @xmath67 ,",
    "the atoms are _ all _ trapped close to the minima of the substrate potential and thus require a finite energy per kink ( equal to the peierls - nabarro barrier ) to move over the corrugated substrate .",
    "thus , for incommensurate contacts above the aubry transition ( @xmath66 ) , the kinks are mobile , chain sliding is initiated by even the smallest driving force and , accordingly , the static friction force vanishes , @xmath68  the chain sliding is _",
    "superlubric_. on the other hand , below @xmath61 the two incommensurate 1d surfaces are locked together due to pinning of the kinks that separate local regions of common periodicity , and in this case we expect stick - slip .",
    "the kinetic friction properties of the fk model @xcite are probed by adding a ( e.g. langevin ) thermostat as described for the pt model above . even where ( above the aubry transition ) @xmath68 the kinetic friction force @xmath10 is nonzero , because the dynamics at any finite speed results in the excitation of phonons in the chain .",
    "note also that a _",
    "finite - size _ @xmath43 fk model is always statically pinned , even for an irrational value of @xmath69 because of the locking of the free ends of the chain .",
    "however an aubry - like transition , exhibiting a symmetry - breaking nature , can still be defined @xcite . at finite @xmath32 ,",
    "pinning can be overcome by thermal fluctuations , which can initiate sliding even in the most - pinned state , the fully commensurate one , see fig .",
    "[ kinks ] . finally , we remark that friction in the dynamically driven fk model describes fairly just the onset of sliding of a crystalline contact @xcite , while it can not account for the highly inelastic plastic or quasi - plastic deformations of the surfaces characterizing real - life friction experiments .",
    "superlubricity is the phenomenon in which two incommensurate periodic surfaces may slide in dry contact with no atomic scale stick - slip instabilities which , as discussed above , are the main source for energy dissipation .",
    "its physical origin is first of all that the energy of two interacting infinite incommensurate systems is independent of their relative position ; and secondly that if they are hard enough they will slide without stick - slip .",
    "vanishing static friction has been first obtained within the fk model in the pioneering work of @xcite for mutually incommensurate periodicities , and sufficiently hard infinite lattices .",
    "later , @xcite predicted that for infinite incommensurate contacts also the kinetic friction should vanish , and called this effect superlubricity . in these conditions , the lateral corrugation forces between two non - matching , rigid crystals cancel out systematically , so that the kinetic friction of externally driven solid vanishes at zero speed , and is dramatically reduced even at finite speed .",
    "the term superlubricity has been criticized as misleading , since it might wrongly suggest zero friction in the sliding state in analogy to superconductivity and superfluidity .",
    "instead , incommensurability of periodic interfaces cancels only one of the channels of energy dissipation , that originating from the low - speed stick - slip instability .",
    "other dissipative processes , such as the emission of sound waves , still persist , and therefore even in the case of complete incommensurability the net kinetic friction force does not vanish .",
    "nonetheless , in the superlubric regime one expects a substantial reduction of the friction force relative to a similar , but commensurate case .",
    "detailed experimental studies of superlubricity were recently performed by @xcite , who measured friction between a graphite flake attached to the ffm tip and an atomically flat graphite surface .",
    "super - low friction forces ( @xmath70  pn ) are found for most relative orientations of the flake and the substrate , for which the contacting surfaces find themselves in incommensurate states ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : flakesuperlub ] ) . for narrow ranges of orientation angles corresponding to commensurate contacts ,",
    "stick - slip motion was observed and friction was high ( typically @xmath71  pn ) .",
    "a few earlier experiments @xcite also provided indications of superlubricity in dry friction .    these observations of superlubricity can be described within a generalized pt model treating the graphite flake as a rigid finite lattice , composed of hexagonal carbon rings , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : modifiedtom ] .",
    "the interaction potential is obtained by summing the pairwise interactions between carbon atoms in the flake and in the graphite surface .",
    "the resulting flake - surface potential @xmath72 depends on the position of the center of mass of the rigid flake given by the two - dimensional coordinate @xmath73 , and on the orientational ( misfit ) angle @xmath74 of the flake relative to the surface lattice .",
    "the motion of the flake attached to the ffm tip and driven along the surface is described by the pt equation where the sinusoidal tip - surface potential is replaced by the more complex potential @xmath75 . assuming that the flake is rotationally locked ( i.e.  @xmath74 is constant ) the angular dependence of average friction force is in agreement with observations : the friction exhibits narrow peaks of high friction with stick - slip motion around the values of @xmath74 corresponding to the commensurate configurations of the flake and the surface , which are separated by wide angular intervals with smooth - sliding ultra - low friction corresponding to incommensurate configurations @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that the angular width of the friction maxima , @xmath76 , should depend on the flake size , @xmath77 , where @xmath78 is the flake diameter , expressed in lattice spacings .",
    "accordingly , the width of friction peaks can be used to estimate the flake diameter .",
    "superlubricity between incommensurate surfaces provides a desired low - friction state essential for the function of small - scale machines .",
    "however , some experiments show that flake superlubricity has a finite lifetime : it disappears due to a reorientation of the flake into the commensurate state @xcite as observed in a generalization of the pt model @xcite and in tight - binding atomistic simulation @xcite .",
    "studies of superlubricity may have important implications for understanding the macroscopic properties of graphite and other solid lamellar lubricants which are common solid lubricants @xcite .",
    "mainly used as flaky powder , they are applied where liquid lubricants can not be used , and show remarkable nanotribological properties which are still not understood .",
    "recent md simulations @xcite demonstrated that two surfaces lubricated by mobile , rotating graphene flakes may exhibit stable superlubric sliding as for ideally incommensurate contacts and for surfaces covered by randomly oriented pinned graphene patches . under humid conditions",
    ", the multi - domain surface structures can form spontaneously due to the capillary forces which fix randomly oriented flakes at the sliding surfaces , while in vacuum graphite patches are free to reorient to a high - friction and high - wear regime .",
    "this may provide an answer to the long - standing problem of why graphite is such a bad lubricant in vacuum , and needs the humidity of air to perform well @xcite .",
    "many relevant generalizations of the fk model have been proposed so far to cover a large class of frictional relevant phenomena ; they mainly consist of modifications of model interactions or of dimensionality .",
    "for realistic physical systems ( as , e.g. , atoms adsorbed on a crystal surface ) , anharmonicity can be introduced in the chain interatomic potential , see @xcite .",
    "the main novelties here include effects such as a broken kink - antikink symmetry , new types of dynamical solitons ( supersonic waves ) , a breakup of the antikink soliton followed by a chain rupture , a changed kink - kink interaction .",

    "complex unit cell substrates @xcite , as well as quasiperiodic @xcite and disordered corrugated profiles @xcite have also been considered in simulations .",
    "these deviations from the standard fk potential may lead to qualitatively different excitations such as different types of kinks , phonon branches , changes in kink - antikink collisions . from a tribological point of view , different types of sliding behavior are to be expected at low - driving forces , when the dynamics is mainly governed by the motion of kink - like structures .    an important and more realistic generalization of the standard fk chain with relevant consequences for the resulting tribological properties ( critical exponents , scaling of friction force with system size , mechanisms of depinning , etc . ) involves increasing the dimensionality of the model .",
    "especially the fk 2d generalized versions of the model @xcite are naturally applicable to the description of a contact of two solid surfaces ( i.e. , the case of `` dry '' friction ) , in particular as is realized in qcm experiments , where 2d monoatomic islands of adsorbate atoms slide over a periodic crystalline substrate @xcite .",
    "these approaches are especially powerful in the investigation of the transient behavior at the onset ( or stopping ) of sliding , which is quite difficult to study in fully realistic 3d models , see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "noncontact afm tips oscillating on top of kink - like adsorbate regions @xcite dissipate significantly more than near in - registry regions .",
    "this mechanism is explained by the higher softness and mobility of solitonic regions @xcite , and it has been demonstrated by the dynamics of an incommensurate fk chain , forced and probed by a locally - acting oscillation @xcite .    in investigating confined systems under shear ,",
    "fk - like models with just one particle @xcite or an interacting atomic chain @xcite embedded between two competing substrates have led to uncover peculiar tribological phenomena related to stick - slip dynamics or to the appearance of `` quantized '' sliding regimes of motion @xcite .",
    "while some of these phenomena , such as chaotic and inverted stick - slip motion , two types of smooth sliding and transitions between them , have been already observed @xcite , others are still waiting for experimental confirmation .",
    "last but not least , the combined frenkel - kontorova - tomlinson ( fkt ) model @xcite has been introduced including harmonic coupling of the interacting chain atoms to a sliding body .",
    "this approach resembles the burridge - knopoff model , to be detailed in sec .",
    "[ larkin : sec ] , where , however , an on - site interaction with the lower body replaces a phenomenological dry friction law ( usually a velocity - weakening one ) .",
    "the fkt model introduces more degrees of freedom than the pt model , and it has been used to describe effects of finite size and stiffness of the afm tip and of normal load on friction @xcite .",
    "the latter effect has been modeled assuming a linear dependence of the amplitude @xmath5 of potential corrugation on the applied normal force .",
    "the validity of the fkt model has been tested by 3d md simulations @xcite , which confirmed the outcome of the model for most of investigated regimes except the limit of very low stiffness and high normal load . unlike the fkt model in which the breakdown of superlubricity coincides with the emergence of the metastable states , in the 3d model some metastable states",
    "appear to reduce frictional force leading to nonmonotonic dependence of force on normal load and tip compliance .    increasing dimensionality and adding realistic features to the fk model brings its extensions into closer and closer contact to full - fledged md simulations .",
    "the simple low - dimensional mms discussed in sect .  [ models : sec ] are useful for a qualitative understanding of many physical aspects of friction . to address subtler features , such as the temperature dependence of the static friction of a specific interface or the joule - heat dissipation , one should go beyond mms including atomistic structural details of the interface .",
    "such an approach is provided by md simulations .",
    "advances in computing hardware and methodology have dramatically increased our ability to simulate frictional processes and gather detailed microscopic information for realistic tribological systems .",
    "md simulations are used extensively in sliding nanofriction to provide unique insight into the relevant processes , sometimes overturning conventional wisdom .",
    "they represent controlled computational experiments where the dynamics of all atoms is obtained by solving numerically newton ( or langevin ) equations of motion based on suitable interparticle interaction potentials and the corresponding interatomic forces.the geometry of the sliding interface and the boundary conditions ( e.g.  as sketched in figs .  [ confined ] and [ cluster ] ) can be chosen to explore friction , adhesion , and wear . a thermostat , or other form of damping ,",
    "is introduced in order to eliminate the joule heat to obtain a frictional steady state .",
    "finally , after specifying the initial coordinates and velocities of the particles , the classical differential equations of motion are integrated numerically .    a worthwhile guide to atomistic md simulations of frictional processes focusing on fundamental technical aspects ( realistic construction of the interface , appropriate ways to impose load , shear , and the control of temperature ) can be found in the review articles by @xcite and by @xcite .",
    "for the general classical md approach , we refer the reader to the textbooks by @xcite and by @xcite .    by following the newtonian dynamics of a system executing sliding for a significant amount of time ,",
    "quantities of physical interest such as instantaneous and average friction force , mean ( centre - of - mass ) slider velocity , heat flow , and correlation functions are numerically evaluated .",
    "unlike standard equilibrium md simulations of bulk systems , frictional modeling inherently involves non - equilibrium conditions and a non - linear dissipative response to the external driving .",
    "a standard practical assumption is to add langevin terms to newton s equations , like in eqs .",
    ", for the pt model at finite temperature .",

    "the choice of the appropriate interaction forces between atoms represents a major problem .",
    "if @xmath79 is the total energy of the system ( here say , the slider plus the substrate ) , as a parametric function of all atomic coordinates @xmath80 , the force on atom @xmath81 is @xmath82 , perfectly determined once @xmath83 is known accurately .",
    "unfortunately this is generally not the case , for @xmath83 is determined by the quantum mechanics of electrons  a much bigger and unsavory problem to solve . _",
    "ab - initio _",
    "md , e.g.  of the car - parrinello type @xcite , has not really been of use so far in sliding friction , mainly because it can handle only rather small systems , typically hundreds of atoms , for relatively short times , typically @xmath84  ns . most md frictional simulations are therefore based on reasonable empirical interatomic forces ( `` force fields '' ) , ranging from relatively sophisticated energy surfaces accounting for electrons at the density - functional level or at the tight - binding level @xcite , to angle - dependent many - particle potentials , to simple pairwise potentials ( e.g.  lennard - jones ) , to basic simple models of elastic springs , extensions of fk - type formulations . in practice , several reliable force fields , parameterized to fit different ranges of experimental data and material combinations , are available in the literature @xcite . while this allows qualitative atomistic simulations of sliding friction , it is often far from quantitative .",
    "for example , during such a violent frictional process as wear , atoms may change substantially their coordination , their chemistry , sometimes their charge .",
    "once a specific system is understood after the elaborate development of satisfactory potentials , the mere change of a single atomic species may require a painful reparameterization of the interatomic forces . as a result ,",
    "systematic frictional studies are a _",
    "tour de force _ if no suitable set of consistent potentials is already available .",
    "a promising approach consists in the use of the so - called reactive potentials @xcite , capable of describing chemical reactions and interface wear , with the advantage , for large - scale atomic simulations , of a good computational efficiency compared to first - principle and semi - empirical approaches .      in a tribology experiment ,",
    "mechanical energy is converted to joule heat which is carried away by phonons ( and electrons in metals ) . in a small - size simulation ,",
    "the excitations generated at the sliding interface propagate and crowd - up into an excessively small region of `` bulk '' substrate , where they are back reflected by the cell boundaries , rather than properly dispersed away . to avoid overheating and in order to attain a frictional steady state , the joule heat",
    "must therefore be steadily removed .",
    "if this removal is done by means of standard equilibrium thermostats such as velocity rescaling or nos - hoover or even langevin dynamics , an unphysical dissipation is distributed throughout the simulation cell , so that simulated atoms do not follow their real conservative motion , but rather execute an unrealistic damped dynamics which turns out to affect the overall tribological properties @xcite .",
    "similarly in the pt and fk models , the damping parameter @xmath8 is known to modify kinetic and frictional properties , but there is no clear way to chose the value of @xmath8 . to a lesser or larger extent , this lamentable state of affairs is common to all md frictional simulations .    to solve this problem ,",
    "one should attempt to modify the equations of motion inside a relatively small simulation cell so that they reproduce the frictional dynamics of a much larger system , once the remaining variables are integrated out .",
    "a recent implementation of a non - conservative dissipation scheme , based on early formulations by @xcite , and subsequent derivations by @xcite , has demonstrated the correct disposal of friction - generated phonons , even in the relatively violent stick - slip regime @xcite .",
    "all atoms near the sliding interface follow plain vanilla newton s equation , while the atoms in the deepmost simulated layer , representing the boundary layer in contact with the semi - infinite heat bath ( see fig .  [ fig : thermostat ] ) , acquire additional non - conservative ( and non - markovian ) terms which account for the time history of this layer through a memory kernel @xcite .",
    "nanofriction simulations exploiting this dissipative scheme have recently been implemented that conceptually and practically improve over a traditional langevin simulation .",
    "improvement is achieved in particular by adjusting the damping @xmath8 applied to the simulation boundary layer so as to variationally minimize the energy back - reflected by that boundary @xcite .",
    "modern cpus perform of the order of @xmath85 floating - point operations per second ( flops ) per core .",
    "classical md can take advantage of medium - scale parallelization , with fairly linear scaling to approximately @xmath86 cores , thus affording about @xmath87 flops . as the calculation of the force acting on each atom ( usually the dominating step in a md calculation ) requires",
    ", depending on the complexity and range of the force field , about 10 to @xmath86 flops , the product of the number of simulated particles @xmath52 times the number of time - integration steps @xmath88 per runtime second on a modern medium - size parallel computer is approximately @xmath89 . with a typical time - step in the fs range ,",
    "a medium - size simulation involving @xmath90 atoms can progress at a rate of @xmath91  fs per second , i.e.  approximately @xmath92 in a simulation day .",
    "this total time scales down for larger systems sizes .",
    "these estimates should be compared with the typical times , sizes , and speeds of tribology experiments .",
    "if we wish to address macroscopic sliding experiments , typical speeds would be in the @xmath93 to @xmath94  m / s range : in @xmath95 the slider advances by @xmath93 to @xmath96 , i.e.  approximately @xmath97 to @xmath98 typical lattice spacings , enough for a fair statistics of atomic - scale events ( but hardly sufficient to gather significant data about phenomena such as the diffusion of additives or of wear particles within the lubricant , or step- or defect - related phenomena ) . in a nanoscale ffm experiment , however , the tip advances at a far smaller average speed ( i.e. @xmath99 ) and we can simulate a miserable @xmath100  pm advancement in a typical run , far too short to observe even a single atomic - scale event , let alone reaching a steady state . therefore ,",
    "whenever long - distance correlations and/or slow diffusive phenomena and/or long equilibration times are expected , mms will perform better than fully atomistic md simulations .",
    "there is nevertheless so much physical insight to be extracted from md simulations that it makes sense to run them even at larger speeds than in afm of sfa experiments ; and indeed , the sliding speed adopted in most current atomistic md frictional simulations is in the @xmath93 to @xmath94  m / s range .",
    "one of the challenging problems for md simulations is to account for the transition from stick - slip to steady sliding . in sfa and afm experiments ,",
    "stick - slip with its associated hysteresis and large friction generally disappears for speeds larger than @xmath101 m/s , while in md simulations the transition takes place in the m / s range . this major discrepancy ( up to @xmath102 orders of magnitude in speed ! ) between simulations and experiments , has been discussed e.g.  by @xcite , and relates to the effective spring - force constants and mass distributions , that are hugely different in the two cases , and much oversimplified in simulations .",
    "several attempts to fill these gaps rely on methods , including hyperdynamics , parallel - replica dynamics , temperature - accelerated dynamics , and on - the - fly kinetic monte carlo devised in recent years @xcite .",
    "another important aspect present in experiments and largely missed by md simulations is the ageing of contacts due to the substrate relaxation .",
    "ageing can decrease substantially the critical velocity for the transition from stick - slip to steady sliding .",
    "contact ageing is also believed to be responsible for the increase of the static friction force as a function of the contact time .",
    "direct imaging of contact regions in samples under a normal load show a logarithmic growth with time @xcite , leading therefore to an increasing static friction . at the phenomenological level",
    ", frictional ageing is well described by rate and state friction laws , widely used in geophysics @xcite , but its microscopic origin is still debated .",
    "the main mechanisms that have been invoked in the past to explain it are plastic creep @xcite or chemical strengthening at the interface @xcite . in a recent paper , afm",
    "was used to explore ageing in nanoscale contact interfaces , finding supporting evidence for the second mechanism , since when the contact surface was passivated it showed no more ageing @xcite .",
    "it is however likely that at larger scales and loads plastic creep would also play an important role . beyond its direct relevance for friction ,",
    "the intriguing issue of contact ageing occurs in other non - equilibrium disordered systems such as granular media or glasses .",
    "since it is currently impossible to treat atomistically all the characteristic length scales that mark the dynamical processes entering the friction coefficient of engineering materials , a rising effort is nowadays devoted to develop multiscale approaches .",
    "the basic consideration is that unless conditions are very special , all processes far away from the sliding interface can be described at least approximately by continuum mechanics , and simulated using finite elements , allowing for a macroscopic description of elastic and plastic deformation .",
    "the advantage of these continuum - theory methods is that it is possible to increasingly coarse - grain the system as one moves away from the sliding contact , thereby highly reducing the computational effort .",
    "several groups @xcite combine the atomistic treatment of the interfacial mating region , where displacements occur on an atomic or larger length scale , with a coarse - grained or finite - element continuum description elsewhere , where strains are small and continuous .",
    "the main difficulty lies in the appropriate matching conditions between the atomistic and continuum regions @xcite .",
    "since the atomic detail of lattice vibrations ( the phonons ) , which are an intrinsic part of the atomistic model , can not be fully represented at the continuum level , conditions must be met , for example that at least the acoustic phonons should not be excessively reflected at the atomistic - continuum interface . in other words",
    "matching at this interface must be such that long wavelength deformations should transmit with reasonable accuracy in both directions , which is vital to a proper account of joule - heat disposal into the bulk .",
    "we survey here some recent results from the growing simulation literature , mostly from our groups , and certainly not providing an adequate review of the field .",
    "hydrodynamics and elasto - hydrodynamics have been very successful in describing lubrication by microscopically thin films . with two sliding surfaces well separated by a hydrodynamically fluid film , friction",
    "is mainly determined by the lubricant viscosity .",
    "the friction coefficient can be calculated using the navier - stokes equations , showing a monotonic increase with the relative sliding velocity between the two surfaces @xcite . for small driving velocity and/or high load",
    ", the lubricant can not usually keep the surfaces apart and solid - solid contact eventually ensues . even before full squeezeout",
    ", a liquid confined within a nanometer - scale gap ceases to behave as a structureless fluid .",
    "pioneering studies of confined systems under shear reveal a sequence of drastic changes in the static and dynamic properties of fluid films in this `` boundary - lubrication '' regime .",
    "sfa experiments @xcite and md simulations @xcite have both shown clear upward frictional jumps , in correspondence to squeezout transitions from @xmath52 to @xmath52 - 1 lubricant layers .",
    "the lubricant squeezout for increasing load becomes harder and harder , corresponding to a ( near ) crystallization of the initially fluid lubricant @xcite .",
    "owing to layer - by - layer squeezout , there will be frictional jumps for increasing load .",
    "friction would not necessarily always jump upward , because restructuring of the solidified trapped lubricant film , and/or a switching of the maximum shear gradient from within the lubricant layer ( possibly accompanied by local melting ) , to the lubricant - slider interface may take place .",
    "it could jump downward in particular , if lattice mismatch between the compressed boundary lubricant layer and the rigid substrates jumped , say , from commensurate to incommensurate , the latter superlubric with a mobile soliton pattern , as sketched in fig .  [ solid_lub ]",
    ". possibilities of this kind are presently the object of investigation .    simulations also show that the presence of impurities or defects between two incommensurate stiff sliding surfaces can , even in a relatively small concentration , lead to pinning and nonzero static friction @xcite .",
    "defects can destroy superlubricity by introducing mechanical instabilities , which may occur depending on the system dimensionality , the structure and relative orientation of the confining walls , and the detail of the lubricant - wall interactions .",
    "md investigations of a melting - freezing mechanism in the stick - slip phenomenology of boundary - lubricated films were carried out by @xcite .",
    "various realistic models for lubrication layers in very specific contexts have been investigated with extensive md simulations @xcite .",
    "an ideal experimental setup to investigate the molecular origin of friction is provided by the qcm , where atomically thin systems , usually just one monolayer or less of rare - gas is deposited on a substrate resting on a quartz crystal .",
    "when the crystal surface oscillates strongly enough so as to dislodge the adsorbate islands under their own inertial force , the sliding friction is revealed by mechanical damping . depending on the substrates and on the system interactions at play , the equilibrium properties of these systems may exhibit distinct structural geometries , of interest in the field of 2d phase transitions ; different dynamical phases may show up for the driven over - layer , such as pinned solid , sliding solid , and liquid phases @xcite .",
    "these experimentally well - characterized systems have also been studied theoretically and numerically by molecular dynamics simulations @xcite . when the interface is commensurate the static friction is too large to allow for a massive slip @xcite ; yet slip is observed experimentally for a xe monolayer on a cu(111 ) substrate , a system that forms a commensurate interface @xcite .",
    "a possible explanation is a slip which does not occur coherently but by a nucleation process in which a bubble slips forward creating a new commensurate domain as revealed by md simulations @xcite .",
    "it is possible to estimate the critical radius of this domain and the energy barrier associated with the nucleation process by the conventional theory of nucleation , estimating the value of the relevant parameters from a solution of an effective fk model @xcite .",
    "thanks to thermally activated nucleation , with the additional help of impurities and disorder acting as seeds , the monolayer can slip under lateral forces that are much smaller than those expected for a rigid layer pinned by the commensurate interface , providing an explanation for the experimental results .    when the adsorbate is incommensurate and hard , solitons exist already in the ground state , and their free motion should in principle permit superlubric sliding . if however the adsorbate forms islands , as should generally be the case , perfect superlubricity is still broken by the island s edges , which present a barrier to the entering and exiting of solitons , necessary for the island to slide .",
    "this island edge pinning is currently under study by n. varini and collaborators .",
    "an advantage of md is that it can address extreme or otherwise unusual frictional situations , still unexplored because they may be experimentally difficult to realize .",
    "one such example are the high `` flash temperature '' regimes caused by local joule heating due to wear and other machining or braking conditions @xcite . even in equilibrium but at temperatures close to the melting point ,",
    "the outermost layers of a solid substrate generally undergo `` surface melting '' @xcite . in these conditions ,",
    "afm nanofriction can not generally be experimentally accessed , because the nearly liquefied surface layers jump to contact and wet the tip long before it reaches nominal contact @xcite .",
    "however , some solid surfaces , such as nacl(100 ) , do not melt @xcite , thus making for an interesting , albeit purely theoretical so far , case study .",
    "md simulations predict that high - temperature nanofriction over such a nonmelting surface would behave very differently depending whether the tip - surface contact is `` hard '' or `` gentle '' . in the first case",
    ", the tip plows the substrate with wear .",
    "the friction coefficient , very large at low temperature , drops close to the melting point , when the tip itself provokes local melting , and moves accompanied by its own tiny liquid droplet , precisely as in ice skating . for gentle , low - load ,",
    "wear free sliding on a hard surface the opposite is predicted . here",
    "friction , initially very small , is expected to increase as temperature is raised close to the melting point where the surface , still solid , becomes softer and softer due to increasing anharmonicity , with an analogy to flux lines in type ii superconductors .",
    "@xcite .",
    "a second example is high - speed nanofriction , as could be expected by a tip or a surface - deposited nanocluster ( fig .",
    "[ cluster ] ) sliding at large speed over a smooth crystal surface . a speed in excess of 1",
    "m / s is many orders of magnitude higher than that of ordinary afms or other nanofrictional systems , and is as yet unexplored .",
    "md simulations , carried out for the test case of gold clusters sliding over graphite surfaces , show , besides a standard low - speed drift sliding regime , the emergence of a novel `` ballistic '' sliding regime , typically above 10  m / s @xcite .",
    "the temperature dependence of the cluster slip distance and time , measuring its sliding friction , is predicted to be opposite in these two regimes , high - speed ballistic sliding and low - speed drift sliding .",
    "the interplay of rotations and translations is crucial to both regimes .",
    "simulations show that the two are correlated in slow drift but anti - correlated in fast ballistic sliding . despite the deep difference with drift ,",
    "the speed dependence of ballistic friction is , like drift , viscous , a useful result whose validity was not discounted in principle , and which it would be interesting to pursue and test experimentally .",
    "afm manipulation of surface - deposited clusters can serve as a useful method to measure the interfacial friction of structurally well - defined contacts of arbitrary size and material combinations . here , md simulations are extremely useful in understanding depinning , diffusion , and frictional mechanisms of clusters on surfaces .",
    "indeed , one of the remarkable experimental observations of the last decade concerns the unexpected ability of relatively large metal clusters to execute friction - free motions and even long jumps with size and shape conservation @xcite .",
    "gold clusters , comprising typically hundreds of atoms , have been repeatedly observed to diffuse on highly oriented pyrolytic graphite ( hopg ) surfaces with surprisingly large thermally activated diffusion coefficients already at room temperature ; a similar behavior was reported also for larger antimony clusters .",
    "md simulations of the diffusive regime have shown the possible coexistence of sticking periods , and of long jumps , reminiscent of so - called levy flights @xcite .",
    "the sticking lasts so long as the cluster - substrate surfaces are orientationally aligned , and the long sliding jumps occur when a thermal fluctuation rotates the cluster destroying the alignment @xcite .",
    "further understanding of the sliding of these deposited nano - objects will be of considerable future value @xcite .",
    "exploring novel routes to achieve friction control by external physical means is an important goal currently pursued in nanotribology .",
    "two methods have recently been suggested by simulation : mechanical oscillations and phase transitions .    _",
    "mechanical oscillations . _ natural or artificially induced oscillations obtained by small normal or lateral mechanical vibrations may , when applied at suitable frequency and amplitude ranges , help driving a contacting interface out of its potential - energy minima , increasing considerably surface mobility and diffusion , and reducing friction and wear . flexibility and accessibility",
    "are the main relevant features of this approach , since frictional properties can be tuned continuously by the frequency and the amplitude of the applied vibrations .",
    "this effect has been demonstrated experimentally with afm @xcite , see fig .",
    "[ oscillations : fig ] , and in sheared confined system @xcite and numerically with atomistic md @xcite or mm approaches @xcite . on a larger scale",
    ", it has also been reported that in sheared granular media experiments the stick - slip behavior is also significantly perturbed by tiny transverse vibrations @xcite . despite these promising numerical and experimental contributions ,",
    "a detailed analysis accounting for the friction dependence on vibrations is still to some extent lacking .",
    "most past theoretical studies of mechanical control adopted an oversimplified single - asperity model , which misses the collective behavior of multi - asperity mesoscopic interfaces .",
    "this and other aspects of interface oscillation are still calling for a proper treatment and understanding .    _ phase transitions .",
    "_ another idea to control friction is to employ a substrate undergoing a phase transition . while it is obvious that friction will change in the presence of a phase transition , it is more subtle to qualify and quantify precisely the effect",
    "surprisingly perhaps for such a basic concept , there are essentially no experimental data available  and no theory either . while it would be tempting to use linear - response theory @xcite , with the fluctuation - dissipation theorem making direct contact between criticality and viscous friction",
    ", one can not ignore that realistic dry friction is dominated by stick - slip instabilities that are intrinsically violent and non - linear .",
    "hence , one is left with md simulations .",
    "a pt - like md nanofrictional simulation based on a point slider over a 2d model substrate with a built - in structural displacive transition recently predicted that stick - slip friction should actually peak near the substrate critical temperature @xcite .",
    "these results show that friction will also depend upon the order parameter direction , a dependence due to the different ability of the slider to elicit disorder in the substrate depending on that direction .",
    "some level of control of atomic - scale friction can thus be anticipated through external switching of the order parameter direction ( e.g. , by an external field or strain ) .",
    "although the magnitude of the phase transition effects relative to the background friction will of course depend on the real system chosen , these results suggest pursuing this idea experimentally in , e.g. , displacive ferro and antiferrodistortive materials , a vast realm of solids exhibiting continuous or nearly continuous structural transitions .",
    "the pt model discussed in earlier chapters provides a good initial description of the frictional behavior of an individual contact that can be relevant for nanotribology experiments . however , recent simulations @xcite revealed that , even for an apparently sharp afm tip sliding on a crystalline surface , the actual interface consists of an ensemble of individual atomic contacts ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : mechano1 ] ) . on larger scales such as the mesoscale of sfa experiments",
    "the multicontact picture becomes even more obvious . the way how individual contacts can be averaged to yield macroscopic friction law has been the focus of intense research in the past decades .",
    "friction is not simply the sum of single - asperity responses , but is influenced by temporal and spatial dynamics across the entire ensemble of contacts that form the frictional interface .",
    "long - range elastic interactions between contacts are important and can not be neglected . @xcite and",
    "@xcite greatly improved and generalized these concepts to more realistically fractal rough surfaces .",
    "a significant progress in the solution of these problems has been recently achieved with coarse - grained mechano - kinetic models @xcite that describe friction through dynamical rupture and formation of interfacial contacts ( junctions ) .",
    "these contacts may represent molecular bonds , capillary bridges , asperities between rough surfaces , and for lubricated friction they can mimic patches of solidified lubricant or its domains .",
    "each contact is modeled as an elastic spring connecting the slider and the underlying surface . as long as a contact is intact ( unbroken ) ,",
    "it is increasingly stretched with a speed equaling the velocity of the slider , and thus produces an increasing force that inhibits the motion ; after the instability point is reached , a ruptured contact relaxes rapidly to its unstretched equilibrium state .",
    "the kinetics of contact formation and rupturing processes depends on the physical nature of contacts . for atomic scale contacts , capillary bridges and domains of solidified lubricants , the processes of rupture and formation of contacts",
    "are thermally activated , and the interplay between them may lead to a complex dependence of friction on slider velocity and sample temperature @xcite . for micro- and macroscopic asperities between rough surfaces thermal effects",
    "are less significant and threshold rupture forces should be taken from a distribution that is determined by the structure of the contacting surfaces .",
    "the mechanism of contacts detachment is similar to the one proposed previously by the fiber - bundle models @xcite .    at the nanoscale",
    "the rates of formation @xmath103 and rupturing @xmath104 of microscopic contacts are defined by the corresponding energy barriers @xmath105 and @xmath106 . the barrier for detachment , @xmath106 , is force dependent and diminishes as the force acting on the contact increases and the contact",
    "is stretched . as we discussed above",
    ", precisely this mechanism characterizes the pt model , but what has rarely been rationalized so far is that the process of contact formation must be considered as well .",
    "the dynamics of friction in the mechano - kinetic models is determined by four characteristic rates : ( i ) the rate @xmath107 of spontaneous detachment of contacts , ( ii ) the rate @xmath103 of contact formation , ( iii ) the rate @xmath108 of forced unbinding , and ( iv ) a characteristic rate of the pulling force relaxation , @xmath109 . here @xmath110 is an average threshold force for the contact rupture , @xmath1 is the stiffness of the pulling spring , @xmath8 is the dissipation constant , and @xmath0 is the mass of the slider . correspondingly , these models exhibit three regimes of motion : ( i ) smooth sliding at very low velocities or high temperatures , with @xmath111 , ( ii ) smooth sliding also for high velocities or low temperatures , with @xmath112 , and ( iii ) stick - slip oscillations for intermediate velocities and temperatures .",
    "these multicontact models demonstrate that the overall smooth sliding corresponds to uncorrelated atomic - scale stick - slip ( or smooth ) motion of individual junctions , while the global stick - slip motion emerges from a cooperative behavior of the junction subsystems .",
    "it is interesting to note that the transition from smooth sliding to stick - slip with increasing @xmath3 was indeed observed in sfa experiments with two weakly adhering boundary - lubricated surfaces @xcite .",
    "an important advantage of the mechano - kinetic models is that they are directly scalable to meso and macro - scales .",
    "application of these models already allowed to solve some significant disagreements between the experimental observations and the predictions of the pt model and md simulations .",
    "firstly , sfa experiments found that the critical velocity for transition from stick - slip is in the interval of @xmath113 m/s , while the md simulations and pt model lead to values which are 6 or 7 orders of magnitude larger @xcite . according to the mechano - kinetic models",
    "the transition should occur at @xmath114 that for reasonable values of the parameters agrees with the experimentally observed values of the critical velocity .",
    "secondly , the pt model and md simulations @xcite fail to reproduce the nonmonotonic temperature dependence of the average friction force found in ffm experiments for several material classes .",
    "the mechano - kinetic model demonstrates that the peak in the temperature dependence of friction emerges from two competing processes acting at the interface : the thermally activated formation and rupturing of an ensemble of atomic contacts @xcite .",
    "this observation also provides a direct link between the temperature and velocity dependencies of friction and it shows the experimentally observed fingerprint in the friction - velocity curves . specifically , at temperatures above the peak temperature , friction increases with scan speed , whereas , below the peak , friction decreases with velocity .",
    "an important and still unresolved question is what is the microscopic origin of the rupture and reattachment processes introduced for the interpretation of ffm experiments @xcite .",
    "similarly to the mechanism of energy dissipation in afm @xcite , they can be attributed to reversible jumps of surface atoms , flips of surface fragments or transitions between different tip structures , which are induced by the tip motion along the surface .",
    "these dissipative processes result in a bistable potential - energy profile for the tip - surface junction where the barrier separating the potential minima is continuously changed during sliding .",
    "an unambiguous understanding of the nature of the corresponding instabilities and evaluation of microscopic parameters which determine the values of the rupture and reattachment rates require first - principles calculations of potential energy surfaces for the tip - surface junctions .",
    "the first attempts in bridging the gap between mechano - kinetic models and md simulations have already demonstrated that model parameters can be completely specified using information obtained from fully atomistic simulations @xcite .",
    "then the parameter - free kinetic models are able to reproduce the temperature and velocity variation in the friction force as obtained from fully dynamical atomistic simulations with very high accuracy over a wide range of conditions .",
    "this combined approach is promising because it allows the full atomistic details provided in md simulations to be used in interpreting experimental phenomena at time and length - scales relevant to tribological measurements .",
    "elastic instabilities play , as we saw , a prominent role in explaining frictional dissipation at the nanoscale and one may thus ask what happens at larger scales for multicontact interfaces .",
    "the role of elasticity in friction crucially depends on whether stress gradient are present or not @xcite . for uniform loading",
    ", stress is distributed homogeneously on the contact surface and elastic interactions mediate the response of local slip fluctuations .",
    "experimental conditions , however , often lead to shear stress concentration at the edge of the sample leading to detachment fronts .",
    "we discuss the first case in this section and the second in the the next one .",
    "the interplay between small scale disorder due to random contacts and elastic interactions between the contacts is a complex statistical mechanics problem that is encountered in different contexts from vortex lines in superconductors @xcite , dislocations in solids @xcite , domain walls in ferromagnets @xcite to name just a few .",
    "two bodies in contact form a set of @xmath115 random contacts per unit area . in the limit of small uniform loads",
    ", we can consider a weak - pinning hypothesis , in which friction results from the fluctuations of the forces due to individual contacts , and derive a scaling theory @xcite . neglecting for simplicity tensor indices , the displacement of a contact at @xmath116 due to the elastic interactions with the other contacts can be estimated as @xmath117 where the elastic green function scales as @xmath118 , @xmath119 is the young modulus ( which is typically @xmath120 times larger than the yield strength @xmath121 ) , and the contact stresses @xmath122 are randomly distributed with zero mean correlations @xmath123 where @xmath6 is the contact diameter , depending on the normal load , the yield stress @xmath121 is taken as a measure of the stress due to the contacts , and @xmath115 is the contact density . in analogy with other collective pinning theories",
    ", we can estimate the typical lengthscale @xmath124 [ usually referred to as the `` larkin length '' @xcite or `` elastic coherence length '' @xcite ] at which elastic interaction become important by the condition that the typical displacement equals the size of the contact @xmath125 .",
    "a straightforward calculation yields @xmath126 where @xmath127 is a numerical constant , and @xmath128 is the average distance between contacts .",
    "the larkin length separates the lengthscales for which elastic interaction dominates ( @xmath129 ) and the contact interface does not deform , from those at which disorder dominates ( @xmath130 ) and interface adapts to the pinning - center landscape . for two macroscopic bodies in contact , eq .",
    "predicts that @xmath124 is very large because @xmath131 and @xmath132 , and pinning - induced deformations should be absent .",
    "one should bear in mind that boundary - induced stress gradient can still lead to observable elastic deformations , as discussed in the next section .",
    "an important aspect that is missing from the analysis above is the presence of long - range correlations : most contact surfaces are self - affine over several lengthscales .",
    "this implies that the assumption of uncorrelated surface stresses made in eq .",
    "is not valid .",
    "one can , however , repeat the larkin argument for long - range correlated pinning stresses @xmath133 where @xmath8 is a scaling exponent .",
    "computing the typical displacement in this case , we obtain @xmath134 for @xmath135 , while for @xmath136 long - range correlations are irrelevant @xcite and we recover the uncorrelated case in eq .  . the interesting feature of eq .",
    "is that the dependence is not exponential and the contact interface can deform even at small length scales .",
    "the effect of elastic interactions due to the contact of self - affine surfaces has been studied analytically and numerically , revealing that the solid indeed deforms elastically due to the contact @xcite .",
    "the role of elasticity in friction is vividly illustrated by the burridge - knopoff model for earthquakes @xcite where a set of frictional blocks of mass @xmath55 coupled by springs are driven over a substrate ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : bkmodel ] ) . in one dimension ,",
    "the equation of motion for the displacement @xmath137 of block @xmath81 is given by @xmath138 where @xmath139 and @xmath140 are the stiffnesses of the springs connecting the blocks between themselves and with the loading plate that moves at constant velocity @xmath3 .",
    "here @xmath141 is a phenomenological friction force that decreases with the velocity of the block and @xmath6 is the rest length of the springs connecting the blocks .",
    "the burridge - knopoff is a deterministic model but displays a very rich dynamical behavior with widely distributed slip events .",
    "the key to the instability is the velocity - weakening constitutive law @xmath141 employed to describe the frictional properties of each block .",
    "the model thus operates at a macroscopic scale and one needs to justify microscopically the origin of its constitutive law . in this context",
    "the model serves to illustrate the concept of localized instabilities during friction : on the tectonic scale slip is localized on some portions of the fault that does not necessarily move coherently as a rigid block .",
    "significant progress in understanding the relationship between the dynamics of individual contacts and macroscopic frictional motion has been achieved with the development of a new real - time visualization method of the net area of contact along the entire interface , as discussed in a series of papers by fineberg s group @xcite . in their experimental apparatus , two poly(methyl methacrylate ) ( pmma ) blocks were pressed together and sheared by a constant force .",
    "a similar visualization technique has been used for tribological studies of a different transparent material , columbia resin @xcite .",
    "owing to the transparency of the media , it was possible to record the contact area as the block were slipping .",
    "this method has enabled a number of key conclusions on the mechanism of transition from static to kinetic friction in macroscopic systems to be drawn : ( i ) the onset of sliding is preceded by a discrete sequence of crack - like precursors ( collective modes of the entire ensemble of asperities ) ; ( ii ) the transition is governed by the interplay between three types of fronts : sub - rayleigh , intersonic and slow fronts ; and ( iii ) a sequence of `` precursor '' events gives rise to a highly inhomogeneous spatial distribution of contacts before the overall sliding occurs .",
    "the collective behavior of the asperity ensemble that composes a frictional interface therefore determines the transition mechanism from static to kinetic friction .",
    "imaging the contacts during friction , also allowed to record the local values of shear and normal stresses . by doing this , @xcite showed that the friction coefficient is not a constant material property but it also depends on the way the system is loaded locally @xcite .",
    "these results call into question many assumptions that have ruled friction for centuries : if the onset of sliding occurs by the propagation of fronts then elastic deformations in the contact interface become relevant and should be taken into account by a theory of friction",
    ". this may even call into question the amontons law , stating that the friction coefficient is independent on the normal load and on the apparent contact area .",
    "indeed deviations from amontons laws have been reported for this experiment .",
    "the experimental phenomenology is well captured by a minimal spring - block model @xcite that describes friction at the slider - substrate interfaces in terms of rupture and reattachment of surface junctions , which represent asperities between rough surfaces .",
    "contrary to the above discussed burridge - knopoff model of earthquakes where phenomenological friction laws have been introduced ,",
    "the model of @xcite explicitly includes two most relevant material properties : interfacial elasticity and thresholds for yielding / rupture of surface junctions .",
    "the interfacial elasticity , which was ignored in previous commonly used models of friction , defines a new velocity scale that is independent of the rayleigh speed and corresponds to slow crack - like fronts @xcite mediating the transition from static to kinetic friction .    the spring - block model @xcite motivated a continuum description of friction between spatially extended materials that includes a coupling between the bulk elastic deformations and the dissipative dynamics at frictional interfaces , which mimic the rupture and reattachment of microcontacts @xcite .",
    "this promising approach may bridge a gap between microscopic and macroscopic scales and enable simulations of macroscopic friction processes at time and length scales relevant to tribological measurements .",
    "the 1d spring - block models discussed above @xcite have limitations , which do not allow a quantitative description of macroscopic friction experiments .",
    "in particular , the 1d models predict an exponential decay of elastic interactions within the sample , while a 3d description leads to a power law decrease of the stress .",
    "nevertheless , recent 2d calculations employing spring - block model @xcite and finite - element method @xcite demonstrated that the 1d models provide an important insight into the mechanism of dry friction between spatially extended materials , and allow to investigate the effect of system parameters on frictional response .",
    "it is important to note that , in order to reproduce experimentally observed spectrum of detachment fronts , the models should incorporate interfacial stiffness and local friction laws including both velocity weakening and strengthening branches @xcite .",
    "the models assuming local coulomb - amontons friction at the block - substrate interface @xcite do not exhibit slow rupture fronts like those observed in various experiments @xcite .",
    "a quantitative comparison to experimental data requires 2d calculations with a proper choice of local friction laws that is a challenge for future studies",
    ".    several questions still remain open : how general are these experimental results ?",
    "do they depend on the specific material , or the setup geometry ? if not , should we revise our general understanding of friction based on amontons laws ?",
    "yet amontons laws have worked quite well for centuries so they should still be valid at least in an average sense or in some conditions .",
    "all these questions require further theoretical insight and more experiments in mesoscale friction .",
    "as many theorists @xcite have discussed , sliding friction over a metallic substrate should elicit electronic excitations , giving rise to additional frictional dissipation besides that due to phonons .",
    "thus for example friction on a metal surface should drop when the metal is cooled below the superconducting critical temperature , as normal electron - hole gapless excitations disappear .",
    "a first qcm report of this frictional drop for the sliding of molecular n@xmath142 islands on a pb surface @xcite broke the ice , but also triggered a considerable debate @xcite .",
    "more recently , electronic friction was demonstrated in doped semiconductors , where local carrier concentration was controlled through application of forward or reverse bias voltages between the afm tip and the sample in the _ p _ and the _",
    "n _ regions , thus demonstrating the capability to electronically tune friction in semiconductor devices @xcite .    very recently , using a pendulum - type afm probe , a clear noncontact friction drop over the surface of nb has been characterized at the superconducting transition @xcite .",
    "the features observed at this transition follow quite closely the predictions by persson and collaborators , see fig .",
    "[ fig : kisiel11_nature_mat ] .",
    "this ultra - sensitive pendulum probe is now ready to be put to work to detect the change of electronic friction at other superconducting transitions .",
    "the main progress to be expected is now experimental , more than theoretical .",
    "promising cases should include the high-@xmath143 cuprates @xcite , organics @xcite , fullerides @xcite , heavy - fermion compounds @xcite and pnictides @xcite .",
    "one interesting physical issue that these investigations could address is the nature and role of strong electron correlations , generally believed to be important for superconductivity in most of these materials .",
    "strongly - correlated superconductivity models generally imply that , when not superconducting , the metal is not always fermi - liquid like , therefore with vanishingly small quasiparticle strengths and drude weights .",
    "moreover , it should be noted that a recent experimental and theoretical study demonstrated the general existence at a strongly correlated metal surface of an insulating `` dead layer '' with a thickness which for example in v@xmath142o@xmath144 reaches several nanometers @xcite .",
    "another interesting case to be studied could be two dimensional metal - insulator transitions at some surfaces , such as the mott transition reported for sn / si(111 ) @xmath145 @xcite .",
    "the relationship between nanofriction and magnetism at the atomic level is an intriguing side direction . in a recent magnetic exchange force microscopy ( mexfm )",
    "experiment @xcite , atomic force sensitivity to the magnetic state of a surface atom was demonstrated for an atomically sharp fe magnetic tip over the @xmath146 surface of antiferromagnetic nio @xcite . besides a different force for the two oppositely polarized surface ni atoms",
    "well explained by the fe - ni exchange available from electronic structure calculations @xcite  the results show a surprising difference of mechanical dissipation , with a large excess of order 15 - 20  mev per cycle in the antiparallel fe - ni spin configuration , as compared to the parallel one .",
    "the fe - ni exchange energy is higher in the antiparallel case , and the difference can clearly be dissipated by flipping the ni spin .",
    "however , direct excitation of surface antiferromagnetic magnons in the antiparallel tip - ni case  the first obvious possible explanation  is ruled out since , owing to strong dipolar anisotropy , the antiferromagnetic spin - wave dispersion of nio has a gap @xmath147  mev @xmath148  thz @xcite in bulk , and one at least as large at the surface .",
    "the low - frequency oscillatory perturbation exerted by the tip ( @xmath149  khz ) on the surface spin , far smaller than this gap , is completely adiabatic , and direct dissipation in the spin - wave channel is impossible .",
    "other strictly magnetic dissipation mechanisms involving mesoscopic scale phenomena , such as domain wall motion @xcite , also appear inefficient in the atomic scale tip - sample magnetic dissipation .",
    "one is left with magnetic coupling to surface atomic displacements .",
    "acoustic phonons are not gapped , both in bulk and at the surface , so they could indeed dissipate . however , the probe frequency is extremely low ; and since dissipation vanishes in linear response theory as a high power of frequency @xcite , a magnetic dissipation mechanism via phonons must involve some hysteretic phenomena far from linear response .",
    "recent theory work @xcite suggests that the nonlinear response may be related to the attainment of a strong coupling overdamped spin - phonon state very well known in other contexts @xcite , giving rise to an unusual kind of single - spin hysteresis .",
    "the tip - surface exchange interaction couples together spin and atom coordinates , leading to a spin - phonon problem with caldeira - leggett type dissipation . in the overdamped regime",
    ", that coupled problem can lead to a unique single - spin hysteretic behavior with a large spin - dependent dissipation , even down to the very low experimental tip oscillation frequencies , just as is seen experimentally . a quantum phase transition to an underdamped regime with a loss of hysteresis and a dramatic drop of magnetic tip dissipation",
    "should in principle be found by increasing and tuning the tip - surface distance .",
    "this experimental check would also help distinguish this interesting spin - phonon mechanism from more trivial possibilities , such as a additional dissipation simply due to a closer distance fe tip  nio surface approach in the antiparallel spin configuration .",
    "carbon and carbon nanotubes ( cnt ) are widely employed in tribology @xcite .",
    "nanotube applications are also numerous in nanofriction . @xcite and also @xcite discussed the possibility to slide or roll nanotubes on a surface . recently , a large longitudinal - transverse anisotropy of afm friction on surface",
    "deposited cnts has been explained precisely by the contrast between the longitudinal tube rigidity , against the transverse softness manifested by `` hindered rolling '' @xcite .",
    "zettl and collaborators @xcite demonstrated ultralow friction experienced by coaxially sliding multiwall cnts .",
    "coaxial cnt sliding also inspired numerous simulations @xcite .",
    "more simulation identified curious  even if at present rather academic  frictional peaks at selected sliding speeds @xcite corresponding to the parametric excitation of quantized nanotube breathing modes .",
    "recent theory work @xcite also discovered that the twofold degeneracy of the breathing modes can cause chiral symmetry to break dynamically at these frictional peaks , so that even purely longitudinal coaxial sliding of nonchiral tubes can generate angular momentum .",
    "other mechanical / rheological properties of cnts have also been probed by afm @xcite .",
    "water wetting and the interfacial friction of water in cnts have also been studied for various purposes .",
    "the observation of flow - generated voltages growing logarithmically with velocity of ion - rich water @xcite appears to be a manifestation of electronic friction which has found various explanations including stick - slip of ions embedded in high viscosity water near the tube @xcite or a statistical consequence of the flow - induced asymmetry in the correlation of the ions , in the ambient fluid as seen by the charge carriers in the cnt @xcite .",
    "recent studies have focused on disentangling confinement and curvature effects on water friction inside and outside cnts , showing that the friction coefficient exhibits a strong curvature dependence . while for a flat graphene",
    "slab friction is independent of confinement , it decreases with cnt radius for water inside , but increases for water outside , see fig .",
    "[ cntwater ] .",
    "the friction coefficient is found to vanish below a threshold diameter for armchair cnts .",
    "a `` superlubric '' , structural origin of this curvature dependence associated with a curvature - induced incommensurability between the water and carbon structures , has been proposed @xcite .",
    "handling matter with static periodic fields generated by interfering lasers adds a new exciting actor to the realm of toy systems that display real physics .",
    "trapping and handling colloidal particles with intense photon fields offers the possibility to change parameters freely , to compare directly experiment with theory , to test theoretical predictions , and to visualize directly in simple cases the intimate mechanics of sliding friction @xcite . in the novel approach freshly inaugurated by bechinger s group @xcite , a 2d close - packed crystal of charged colloidal particles",
    "is forced to slide by stokes forces in the presence of a laser - generated static potential .",
    "unlike conventional sliding crystal surfaces , two - dimensional lattices with different symmetries , lattice spacings and corrugation amplitudes can be constructed at will , realizing for example commensurate or incommensurate matchings , quasicrystal substrate geometries , and possibly `` disordered '' geometries too .",
    "besides and above all that , colloidal friction provides an unprecedent real - time visualization of the full frictional dynamics at play . unlike afm , sfa ad qcm which provide crucial , but averaged frictional data such as the overall static and kinetic friction , mean velocities , slip times , etc . , the colloidal experiments photograph the actual time - dependent motion of every individual particle during sliding , an exquisite privilege restricted so far to the ideal world of md simulations . transitions between different dynamical states become experimentally accessible and can be analyzed and related to the detailed particle motion .",

    "among provisional conclusions of this colloquium we mention :      ( _ ii _ ) the pt model is , despite its deceiving simplicity , extremely useful in understanding many aspects of nanofriction .",

    "other open problem are under what conditions these models yield realistic stick - slip friction as opposed to smooth sliding , and the exact role of the elastic interactions between contacts .",
    "( _ iv _ ) molecular - dynamics simulations are good and informative for qualitative descriptions of atomic stick - slip .",
    "open problems are the high speed of observed change from stick - slip to smooth sliding ; the potential artifacts introduced by unrealistic dissipation mechanisms of joule heat , and more importantly the simulation size and time limitations , in particular the complete omission of slow , logarithmic relaxations and ageing .",
