    "recent discoveries of distant planetary companions ( separations of at least tens of au ) around several nearby stars by direct imaging ( marois 2008 ; thalmann 2009 ) have stimulated investigation of their formation mechanisms .",
    "two contending theories of the planet formation  the core instability ( perri & cameron 1974 ; harris 1978 ; mizuno 1980 ; hereafter ci ) and the gravitational instability ( cameron 1978 ; boss 1998 )  differ quite dramatically in their ability to form planets at various distances from the star .",
    "it is generally thought that ci should be capable of forming giant planets close to the star , at separations @xmath4 au . both theoretical modelling ( mizuno 1980 ; stevenson 1982 ; pollack 1996 ) and the existence of two gas giants at semi - major axes of @xmath5 au and @xmath6 au in our own solar system ( coupled with some knowledge about the evolution of the planetary orbital architecture in the early solar system ) attest to this statement . at the same time it seems unlikely that giant planets can be formed by the gravitational instability in the inner parts of protoplanetary disks because of the long local cooling time of gas ( matzner & levin 2005 ; rafikov 2005 , 2007 ) . on the contrary ,",
    "giant planet formation by the direct gravitational instability appears feasible at large distances from the star ( boley 2009 ; rafikov 2009 ; clarke 2009 ; but see boss ( 2006 ) for an opposite view ) where the disk cooling time is short enough to permit fragmentation of the gravitationally unstable disk ( gammie 2001 ) . whether the ci can operate beyond several tens of au from the star is not so clear .",
    "the well known problem faced by the ci far from the star is that the buildup of massive refractory core ( necessary for triggering the vigorous gas accretion ) is thought to take very long time , longer than the @xmath7 myr lifetime of the gaseous component of protoplanetary nebula .",
    "studies illustrating this problem are usually based on two key assumptions ( dodson - robinson 2009 ) : first , that the ci is triggered whenever a @xmath8 m@xmath9 core is built by planetesimal accretion , and , second , that the planetesimals accrete onto the growing core at rather modest rates ( ida & lin 2004 ; we will explain later what do we mean by that ) .",
    "when these conditions are imposed it is generally found that the ci does not commence at @xmath10 au prior to the nebular gas removal .    in this note",
    "we show that aforementioned assumptions are too restrictive and neither of them need to be adopted in determining the feasibility of the ci .",
    "first , planetesimal accretion by the growing core can ( at least potentially ) be much faster than what has been previously assumed .",
    "second , the critical core mass itself strongly depends on the planetesimal accretion rate .",
    "based on these observations we formulate in this work a novel constraint on the operation of the ci in protoplanetary disks .",
    "onset of the ci is intimately related to the accretion of solid material by the protoplanetary core , as discussed in more detail in  [ sect : atm ] .",
    "for this reason we start by reviewing the process of planetesimal accretion by growing cores .",
    "it is well known that the rate at which a core accretes planetesimals is a strong function of planetesimal random velocities ( dones & tremaine 1993 ; hereafter dt93 ) .",
    "an important parameter for determining the dynamical state of planetesimal population is the ratio @xmath11 of the core radius @xmath12 to the hill radius @xmath13 , where @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the semi - major axis and the mass of the core , and @xmath16 is the mass of the star . at large separations from the star p=()^1/3 510 ^ -4a_10 ^ -1 m_,1 ^ 1/3_c,1 ^ -1/3",
    "[ eq : p ] is much less than unity , where @xmath17 is the core density and we define @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 g @xmath21 .",
    "dt93 have demonstrated that whenever @xmath22 there are four possible regimes of planetesimal accretion .",
    "* when the planetesimal random velocity dispersion @xmath23 ( @xmath24 is the angular frequency at the core s location )  a regime that we call _ very high dispersion _  accretion is very slow because gravitational focussing is inefficient and the collision cross - section is given by the geometric cross - section of the core .",
    "* when @xmath25 ( _ high dispersion _ in the notation of dt93 ) the relative planetesimals velocity with respect to the core @xmath26 .",
    "gravitational focussing is important and planetesimal accretion rate @xmath27 grows as @xmath28 goes down .",
    "* when @xmath29 ( _ intermediate dispersion _ ) one finds that @xmath30 is no longer determined by the random motions of planetesimals but is rather set by the shear in the differentially rotating disk , so that @xmath31 .",
    "gravitational focussing saturates at a constant value whenever @xmath32 and @xmath27 keeps increasing as @xmath28 decreases simply because the thickness of the disk goes down increasing local volume density of accreting bodies . * finally , when @xmath33 ( _ very low dispersion _ ) disk becomes so thin that a core can accrete the whole vertical column of material doomed for collision with it . given that focussing is at its maximum this situation corresponds to the most efficient accretion regime .",
    "the rate of accretion in the very low dispersion case is ( dt93 ) & & m = m_max(6.470.02)p^1/2 _ s r_h^2 , [ eq : max_rate ] + & & 5.1  g^1/2m_c^2/3_s_c^-1/6 , where @xmath34 is the surface density of solids . in this study",
    "we parametrize @xmath34 as _ s=1_1",
    "a_10 ^ -^-2 , [ eq : sig_s ] where @xmath35 g @xmath36 and @xmath37 is a constant ( minimum mass solar nebula ( mmsn ) corresponds to @xmath38 and @xmath39 ) .",
    "note that @xmath40 is independent of @xmath16 .    for comparison , it is often assumed that protoplanetary cores predominantly accrete planetesimals with the dispersion of random velocities @xmath41 , which corresponds to the _ transition _ between the so called shear- and dispersion - dominated dynamical regimes ( e.g. dodson - robinson 2009 ) .",
    "this is what we called a `` modest '' accretion rate before . at this transition",
    "dt93 find m_tr(6 - 10)p_sr_h^2 , [ eq : m_tr ] and one immediately sees that @xmath42 since @xmath22 .",
    "previous studies of the ci have been limited to considering planetesimal accretion only in the high - velocity regime ( @xmath43 ) or at the boundary with the intermediate velocity regime ( i.e. for @xmath44 ) . while large ( tens to hundreds km in size ) planetesimals indeed likely accrete in these dynamical regimes at rather slow rates it is quite possible that most of the mass growth of the core is not due to accretion of these large bodies .",
    "according to rafikov ( 2004a ) and goldreich ( 2004 ) , as the core becomes massive enough it dynamically excites large planetesimals in its vicinity since damping agents such as gas drag are not effective for massive bodies .",
    "this leads to fragmentation ( rather than growth ) of planetesimals when they collide with each other .",
    "resulting fragmentation cascade converts significant fraction of the solid mass into small mass debris .",
    "these fragments finally reach small enough sizes that they are dynamically `` cooled '' by gas drag to low velocities , which makes it possible for them to be accreted at very high rate compatible with @xmath40 ( rafikov 2004a , b ) in the very low dispersion regime .",
    "recent coagulation calculations done by kenyon & bromley ( 2009 ) confirm this general picture , lending support to the possibility of maximally efficient accretion in the very low dispersion regime .    in this work",
    "we are interested in obtaining a robust limit on the operation of core instability , which means that we need to consider all possible modes of planetesimal accretion and actually _ determine _ the accretion regime facilitating the onset of the ci the most ( instead of selecting it ad hoc ) .",
    "it is not obvious a priori which accretion regime is best for achieving the ci within the limited amount of time : on one hand high @xmath27 allows to build the core of a given mass faster , but on the other hand high @xmath27 also implies larger critical mass ( see  [ sect : mcrit ] ) , which takes longer to build .",
    "we will discover in  [ sect : mcrit ] that fastest route to the ci lies through the most efficient accretion at the rate @xmath45 and for this reason we parametrize planetesimal accretion rate as m & = & m_max6.47p^1/2 _ sa^2()^2/3 , [ eq : mdot ] + & & 210 ^ -5 _  ^-1a_10 ^ -_1_c,1 ^ -1/6m_c,10 ^ 2/3,(@xmath46 m@xmath9 ) where the parameter @xmath47 accounts for the deviation of @xmath27 from @xmath40 . in general @xmath47 may be a function of @xmath15 and @xmath14 , and it is expected that @xmath48 ( although in some situations @xmath49 may possible , see  [ sect : disc ] ) .",
    "but we will show in  [ sect : mcrit ] that slow accretion ( i.e. @xmath50 ) results in smaller distance from the star at which planets could form by the ci than in the case @xmath51 .",
    "it should also be emphasized that our concentration on the highest @xmath27 accretion regime is not only for the sake of the argument  as mentioned before this regime may actually occur quite naturally in the course of the core buildup .",
    "accretion luminosity corresponding to the @xmath27 given by equation ( [ eq : mdot ] ) is l & = & 8.2_s g^3/2 m_c^4/3 _ c^1/6 [ eq : lumin ] + & & 810 ^ -6 _",
    "a_10 ^ -_1_c,1 ^ 1/6m_c,10 ^ 4/3 .",
    "according to equation ( [ eq : mdot ] ) accretion at the rate @xmath40 results in the core radius growing linearly with time ( see eq .",
    "[ [ eq : m_tr ] ] ) also leads to @xmath52 , although the coefficient of this relation is considerably smaller than in the case of @xmath53 and has different scaling with @xmath14 . ] .",
    "time needed for the core mass to reach a predetermined value @xmath15 by accretion at the rate @xmath54 is [ see equation ( [ eq : max_rate ] ) ] ( m_c)0.6 0.3  a_10^ .",
    "[ eq : timescale ] it follows from this formula that a core can grow to 10 m@xmath9 in 3 myr by accretion at the rate @xmath40 even at @xmath55 au in the mmsn .",
    "previous results which did not account for the factors leading to the fast accretion ( planetesimal fragmentation and gas drag on debris ) predict much smaller distance ( @xmath56 au ) at which such core would be able to form on that time scale .",
    "having said all that , in the next section we show that the formation of the 10 m@xmath9 core is not a prerequisite for a ci and that the @xmath57 is a function of accretion rate .",
    "numerical calculations ( mizuno 1980 ; pollack 1996 ; ikoma 2000 ) and analytical theory ( stevenson 1982 ) show that ci commences when the core mass @xmath57 is so large that the mass of its atmosphere is comparable to the core mass itself , m_atm(m_crit)=m_crit , [ eq : instab_cond ] i.e. when the gaseous component of the protoplanet becomes self - gravitating . here @xmath58 is a parameter of order unity ; its exact value may depend on the accretion history of the core ( ikoma 2000 ) .",
    "condition ( [ eq : instab_cond ] ) should be regarded as an equation for @xmath57 which can be easily solved as long as the dependence of @xmath59 on @xmath15 and other parameters of the problem is specified .",
    "thus , calculation of @xmath57 involves understanding properties of planetary atmospheres and calculation of @xmath59 in particular .",
    "it has been known since the works of mizuno ( 1980 ) and stevenson ( 1982 ) that the critical core mass is a rather weak function of the density @xmath60 and temperature @xmath61 of the surrounding nebula ( see rafikov [ 2006 ] and  [ subsect : opacity ] for the discussion of the conditions under which this behavior is expected ) .",
    "this has led to the wide acceptance of the ci idea since the interiors of the solar system giant planets are believed to harbor @xmath62 m@xmath9 cores despite their different separations from the sun .",
    "unfortunately , this observation of the @xmath57 invariance has shadowed the fact first noticed by stevenson ( 1982 ) that @xmath57 is a strong function of the planetesimal accretion luminosity @xmath63 , or , equivalently , planetesimal accretion rate @xmath27 .",
    "this fact has been subsequently confirmed both numerically ( ikoma 2000 ; hori & ikoma 2010 ) and analytically ( rafikov 2006 ) .",
    "stevenson s analytical ( 1982 ) results strictly apply only to cores possessing radiative atmospheres with constant opacity .",
    "rafikov ( 2006 ; hereafter r06 ) has studied more general types of atmospheres and has shown that they segregate into two classes depending on whether @xmath63 is higher or lower than some critical luminosity @xmath64 . whenever @xmath65 the intense energy release near the core surface makes protoplanetary atmosphere and the nebular gas in the hill sphere of the core convectively unstable .",
    "such atmosphere have high entropy and rather low mass relative to the mass of the core . in the opposite case , when @xmath66 , protoplanetary atmosphere is separated from the nebular gas by a roughly isothermal shell of gas in which energy is transported radiatively and gas entropy decreases from the nebular value to a much smaller value characteristic for the atmosphere .",
    "density in this shell increases roughly exponentially towards the planet which makes @xmath59 much higher ( for a given core mass ) than in the high - luminosity case .",
    "it was demonstrated in r06 that far from the star protoplanetary atmospheres are virtually always characterized by @xmath67 , even if planetesimal accretion proceeds at the maximally efficient rate @xmath40 .",
    "for that reason we will consider only the low luminosity atmospheres in this work .",
    "the total atmospheric mass @xmath59 in the low luminosity case was computed in r06 by making simplifying assumptions about the conditions in the deep layers of the planetary atmosphere : either a polytropic model with constant polytropic index ( mimicking the fully convective interior ) or a fully radiative atmosphere with a simple power - law parametrization of the opacity dependence on gas pressure and temperature . under these assumptions a significant fraction of the atmospheric mass resides in the outer layer , near the inner boundary of the roughly isothermal external radiative zone , in agreement with calculations by mizuno ( 1980 ) .",
    "it can then be shown that ( r06 ) m_atm()^4 , [ eq : matm ] where @xmath68 is the boltzmann constant and @xmath69 is a weakly varying factor , which can be computed exactly for a given density distribution inside the atmosphere .",
    "this formula shows how @xmath59 depends on important parameters like @xmath15 and @xmath70 and on accretion history , to which @xmath63 is sensitive .",
    "however it is not obvious that the simplifying assumptions about the atmospheric properties used in deriving formula ( [ eq : matm ] ) are justified given the complexity of the physical effects encountered deep in the atmosphere : self - gravity gradually becomes important as @xmath15 approaches @xmath57 , grain sublimation changes opacity in a non - trivial fashion , the equation of state may be varying with depth because of molecular dissociation , an atmosphere may have both radiative and convective regions at the same time .",
    "these complications likely do not affect the qualitative conclusions reached in r06 but should be important for quantitative comparisons .",
    "on the other hand , numerical calculations of the ci which include the aforementioned physical effects ( ikoma 2000 ) are typically limited to exploring the dependence of @xmath57 on only a limited set of input parameters such as @xmath70 and @xmath27 .",
    "the latter is usually taken to be constant through the calculation and this assumption significantly limits the direct applicability of these numerical results to realistic situations ( since typically @xmath27 increases as @xmath15 grows ) , including our present study .    to be able to apply the existing numerical results for the cases when the core accretion history is non - trivial ( @xmath71 const ) while at the same time keeping the flexibility of the theory outlined in r06 we have resorted to the following approach .",
    "first , we still use formula ( [ eq : matm ] ) to calculate @xmath59 but now we do not assume coefficient @xmath69 to be constant as various physical effects in the deep atmosphere introduce additional variations of the density profile not captured by the analytical theory of r06 .",
    "second , using equation ( [ eq : instab_cond ] ) we calculate @xmath57 under the assumption @xmath72 used in ikoma ( 2000 ) . with this information in hand we can calibrate the dependence of @xmath69 on various physical parameters of the problem by comparing our results with those of ikoma ( 2000 ) .",
    "finally , after @xmath69 has been calibrated for a particular accretion history @xmath73const , equation ( [ eq : matm ] ) can be applied for a more general situation , e.g. for the @xmath74 dependence used in this work .",
    "this approach should work well as long as the state of the atmosphere is fully determined by the current value of @xmath27 , and is independent of the full accretion history .",
    "for this to be the case the thermal timescale of the atmosphere must be short compared to the planetesimal accretion timescale , and this has been verified in r06 .",
    "this gives us confidence that the outlined method should be robust and justifies its application to the problem at hand .",
    "since @xmath69 is predominantly affected by the changes of the thermodynamical state of material in the atmosphere ( grain sublimation , molecular dissociation , variations of the equation of state depend on gas temperature and density ) one should expect @xmath69 to depend most strongly on @xmath15 and @xmath63  variables that determine @xmath75 and @xmath76 deep in the envelope .",
    "ikoma ( 2000 ) have shown that in their case @xmath57 scales with @xmath27 and @xmath70 roughly as power laws .",
    "this motivates us to look for the dependence of @xmath69 on @xmath15 and @xmath63 also in the power law form .",
    "the details of the calibration procedure are presented in appendix [ app : zeta ] where we show that & & = _ 0 m_c^ ,  1.2 , [ eq : zeta ] + & & _ 0 410 ^ -32 ^ -82m_^-provides a reasonably good fit to the numerical results of ikoma ( 2000 ) .",
    "note that @xmath69 has been found to depend on @xmath63 only weakly , and can be considered a function of @xmath15 only . in deriving this result for @xmath69",
    "we have assumed that the coefficient @xmath58 appearing in the relation ( [ eq : instab_cond ] ) is independent of the planetesimal accretion history of the core and is thus the same in ikoma work as well as in our case .",
    "results obtained in the previous section allow us to compute @xmath57 for @xmath27 given by equation ( [ eq : mdot ] ) : substituting @xmath59 in the form ( [ eq : matm ] ) with @xmath69 given by equation ( [ eq : zeta ] ) into the instability condition ( [ eq : instab_cond ] ) and using equation ( [ eq : lumin ] ) for core s accretion luminosity we find [ eq : mcrit ] m_crit & & ^3/(5 + 3 ) + & & 40  _ ( ) ^0.35 a_10 ^ -0.35,where @xmath77 @xmath78 g@xmath79 and @xmath80 ( @xmath81 is the atomic hydrogen mass ) .    equation ( [ eq : mcrit ] ) shows among other things that @xmath57 is indeed a function of the planetesimal accretion regime : according to equation ( [ eq : mdot ] ) we may think of the free parameter @xmath47 as a direct measure of planetesimal @xmath27 , and @xmath57 scales roughly as @xmath82 . just for illustration , if ( as has been done in dodson - robinson 2009 ) planetesimal random velocities were kept at the level @xmath83 ( rather than being essentially zero as assumed in deriving equation ( [ eq : mdot ] ) ) the equation ( [ eq : mdot ] ) could still be used but with @xmath84 ( dt93 ; r06 ) . at @xmath85 au where @xmath86 one would then find @xmath57 smaller by a factor of @xmath87 compared to what equation ( [ eq : mcrit ] ) predicts for @xmath88 at the same location .    with equation ( [ eq : mcrit ] )",
    "we also show for our chosen @xmath27 behavior that @xmath57 varies with the distance from the central object : for @xmath47=const the critical mass scales as @xmath89 in the mmsn ( @xmath90 ) .",
    "this makes @xmath57 at 10 au twice as large as @xmath57 at 40 au , everything else being equal .",
    "thus , taking @xmath57 to be independent of the regime of planetesimal accretion and distance from the central object is generally not justified .",
    "for the ci to happen before the nebular gas dispersal the growth time of the core with mass @xmath57 must be less than the lifetime of the protoplanetary nebula @xmath91 , i.e. @xmath92 . plugging in our result ( [ eq : mcrit ] ) into equation ( [ eq : timescale ] ) this constraint can be rephrased in terms of the _ lower limit _ on the surface density of solids : _ s & > & _ lim,[eq : sig_crit ] + _",
    "lim&=&0.74 ^ 1/(4 + 3 ) [ eq : sig_lim ] + & & 0.1  ^-2 ( ) ^-1.13.this inequality represents the main result of this work  a robust lower limit on the _ planetesimal _ surface density at which ci is capable of producing giant planets within a protoplanetary nebula lifetime . note",
    "that @xmath93 is a sensitive function of the nebula lifetime @xmath91 , while it depends rather weakly on the bulk density of the core @xmath17 , atmospheric dust opacity @xmath70 , and the mean molecular weight of the atmospheric gas @xmath94 .",
    "now we can also determine the limiting core mass @xmath95 defined as the critical core mass for @xmath96 , i.e. at the very extreme of the region where ci can still occur within @xmath91 .",
    "it is found by substituting ( [ eq : sig_lim ] ) into ( [ eq : mcrit ] ) : m_lim&=&^3/(4 + 3 ) [ eq : mlim ] + & & 15  _ ( ) ^-0.4 .by construction @xmath95 is independent of the surface density profile in the nebula .",

    "however , a modest radial displacement of the core due to some type of migration can easily expose it to additional fresh material allowing @xmath15 to reach @xmath95 ( alibert 2005 ) .",
    "alternatively , increasing @xmath34 ( boosting up @xmath101 ) by a factor of 2 makes @xmath102 at 44 au .    quite interestingly ,",
    "the value of @xmath95 is not too far from @xmath103 m@xmath9 commonly accepted as the core mass throughout the whole protoplanetary disk .",
    "this coincidence is accidental since our estimate of @xmath95 was derived self - consistently rather than postulated in an ad hoc fashion .      given a constraint ( [ eq : sig_lim ] ) and having a particular model of the radial distribution of @xmath34 one can determine the maximal radial extent @xmath104 of the region in protoplanetary disk in which the ci can produce giant planets within the nebula life time @xmath91 . since @xmath34 is expected to be a decreasing function of @xmath14 this would only be possible for @xmath105 . using our power - law parametrization ( [ eq : sig_s ] ) of @xmath34",
    "we find that in a mmsn - like disk with @xmath90 a_lim^mmsn44   ( ) ^0.75 .",
    "[ eq : a_lim ] accretion at @xmath53 corresponds to @xmath88 in this formula .",
    "the limiting distance found in equation ( [ eq : a_lim ] ) is similar to previous estimates ( e.g. dodson - robinson 2009 ) obtained for less vigorous planetesimal accretion ( i.e. for smaller @xmath27 ) and fixed @xmath106 m@xmath9 but this is just a coincidence",
    ".    equation ( [ eq : a_lim ] ) shows that as @xmath34 ( or @xmath101 ) increases , the extent of ci - capable part of the protoplanetary disk also grows .",
    "but @xmath34 can not be increased without limit  at some point the gaseous component of the protoplanetary nebula would become self - gravitating , and , depending on its cooling time ( gammie 2000 ) , would either fragment or evolve quasi - viscously while maintaining the marginally gravitationally unstable state ( rafikov 2009 ; clarke 2009 ) .",
    "thus the most extreme value of @xmath104 can be obtained by taking @xmath107 in equation ( [ eq : sig_lim ] ) , where @xmath108 is the dust to gas ratio , which we take to be @xmath109 , and @xmath110 is the gas surface density at which the disk is marginally gravitationally unstable , which happens when the toomre @xmath111 is of order unity ( safronov 1960 ; toomre 1964 ) .",
    "assuming that the disk is heated by a central star with luminosity 1 @xmath112 at normal incidence ( i.e. neglecting complications related to flaring geometry , chiang & goldreich [ 1997 ] ) we find that f_dg_q=1(a)20a_10 ^ -7/4 ^ -2 .",
    "[ eq : sigma_sg ] using this density profile in equation ( [ eq : sig_lim ] ) we find a_lim^q=1200   ( ) ^0.64 .",
    "[ eq : a_lim_sg ] in practice this limit will hardly apply to real systems because self - gravitating disks with @xmath113 would not persist for the lifetime of the nebula , as we already mentioned .      through our calculations",
    "we have retained in all formulae the parameter @xmath47 defined in equation ( [ eq : mdot ] ) , which characterizes the efficiency of planetesimal accretion .",
    "this allows us to see how the variation of planetesimal @xmath27 with respect to @xmath40 affects the planet formation by the ci . from equation ( [ eq : sig_lim ] )",
    "we see that smaller @xmath47 ( corresponding to less efficient accretion ) results in _ higher _ @xmath34 and _ smaller _ @xmath104 , see equations ( [ eq : a_lim ] ) , ( [ eq : a_lim_sg ] ) .    as we emphasized in ",
    "[ sect : atm ] , this result is not trivial since less efficient accretion implies lower planetesimal luminosity , bigger @xmath59 for the same @xmath15 , and lower @xmath57 , making ci easier to get going .",
    "however , it turns out that the competing effect of being able to grow the massive core faster at higher @xmath27 is more important for the ci to commence _ within the limited amount of time_. for this reason the largest extent of the region in which the ci can happen in time @xmath91 is reached when the core is able to accrete at the highest possible rate , namely at @xmath40 ( we discuss whether it is potentially possible to _ exceed _ @xmath40 in  [ subsect : strengthen ] ) .",
    "this makes our numerical estimates in equations ( [ eq : a_lim ] ) , ( [ eq : a_lim_sg ] ) very robust .    just for illustration",
    "let us also consider a situation in which the core accretes planetesimals at the rate @xmath114 given by equation ( [ eq : m_tr ] ) , and determine @xmath104 in this case",
    ". comparing expressions ( [ eq : max_rate ] ) and ( [ eq : m_tr ] ) one can easily see that we can do this by simply setting @xmath115 ( @xmath116 is defined by equation [ [ eq : p ] ] ) either in equation ( [ eq : sig_lim ] ) or in equation ( [ eq : a_lim ] ) and determining @xmath104 from the resulting expression : a_lim^tr5   ( ) ^0.57 , [ eq : a_lim_tr ] where we assumed mmsn - like disk properties to provide direct comparison with @xmath117 given by equation ( [ eq : a_lim ] ) . if , as we did in deriving equation ( [ eq : a_lim_sg ] ) , we assume that the disk is marginally gravitationally unstable we would find @xmath118 au for our standard choice of parameters . in figure [",

    "in fact , equation ( [ eq : a_lim_tr ] ) implies that the formation of saturn by the ci at @xmath103 au in our solar system would only be possible if the surface density in the proto - solar nebula was at least 4 times higher than in the mmsn or if the nebula dissipation timescale was at least 10 myr , in agreement with existing studies which assume planetesimal accretion at @xmath123 ( ida & lin 2004 ) .",
    "rather interestingly , our calculations find very weak dependence of both @xmath93 and @xmath104 on @xmath70 .",
    "although the reduction of @xmath70 does help to reduce @xmath57 and @xmath95 , the values of @xmath93 and @xmath104 remain virtually unaffected .",
    "given the large uncertainly in the value of @xmath70 this property further strengthens our estimates of @xmath93 and @xmath104 .",
    "recently hori & ikoma ( 2010 ) calculated @xmath57 as a function of @xmath27 for protoplanets with dust - free ( possible if dust grains sediment from the outer layers of the protoplanetary atmosphere ) and metal - free ( i.e. containing only h and he ) atmospheres and found values of @xmath57 lower by up to an order of magnitude ( as low as @xmath124 m@xmath125 in the metal - free case for @xmath126 m@xmath125 yr@xmath127 ) than in the dusty case .",
    "it would certainly be interesting to repeat calculations done in   [ sect : mcrit ] , [ sect : constr ] and appendix [ app : zeta ] for the case of dust - free atmosphere to see how this extreme reduction of opacity would extend the radial range available for ci .    in practice",
    ", we can not do such calculation at present since it is not possible to calibrate @xmath59 against the results of hori & ikoma ( 2010 ) as we did in equations ( [ eq : matm])-([eq : zeta ] ) and appendix [ app : zeta ] .",
    "this is because in the absence of dust @xmath128 is a function not only of gas temperature but also of gas density .",
    "as demonstrated in r06 in this case @xmath57 is no longer independent of the ambient temperature @xmath61 and density @xmath60 of the nebula as the original analyses of mizuno ( 1980 ) and stevenson ( 1982 ) suggest .",
    "instead one finds that @xmath129 , where @xmath130 ( r06 ) . obviously , @xmath57 then also depend on @xmath60 and @xmath61 , and",
    "the knowledge of this dependence is very important for obtaining @xmath93 and @xmath104 in the dust - free case .",
    "unfortunately , we do not possess this knowledge from first principles as opacity calculations are rather complicated , and in any case we can not currently calibrate @xmath57 as functions of @xmath15 , @xmath61 and @xmath60 against numerical results because calculations of hori & ikoma ( 2010 ) were done for a single value of the planetary semi - major axis ( meaning fixed values of @xmath61 and @xmath60 ) , while @xmath27 was varied .",
    "the scaling of @xmath59 and @xmath57 with @xmath61 and @xmath60 and its implication for the possibility of the ci thus remain worthwhile issues for future investigation .",
    "we can still get a qualitative idea of how @xmath104 changes in the dust - free case by setting opacity in equation ( [ eq : a_lim ] ) at the very low level consistent with pure gas opacity , e.g. @xmath131 @xmath78 g@xmath127 .",
    "we then find @xmath132 au compared to @xmath99 au that equation ( [ eq : a_lim ] ) predicts for @xmath133 @xmath78 g@xmath127 .",
    "thus , opacity reduction due to sedimentation and coagulation of dust grains in the protoplanetary atmosphere may help in extending the range of distances in which the ci is possible .",
    "despite the robustness of our arguments it is not inconceivable that some additional factors can weaken them and make giant planet formation by the ci possible even beyond the limits represented by equations ( [ eq : sig_lim ] ) and ( [ eq : a_lim ] ) . alternatively",
    ", it is quite possible that some of the assumptions used in deriving these results are too extreme and one can get even better constraints by focussing on less dramatic assumptions . below we review factors that can work one way or another .",
    "one possible way to facilitate ci and increase @xmath104 is to consider possibility of planetesimal accretion at rates _ exceeding _ @xmath40 .",
    "this is very difficult ( since there are many factors that tend to reduce @xmath27 compared to @xmath40 , see  [ subsect : strengthen ] ) but may be possible if e.g. one takes into account the increase of planetesimal capture cross - section by the core caused by its extended , dense atmosphere .",
    "this effect has been previously investigated by inaba & ikoma ( 2003 ) who demonstrated that an increase of @xmath27 by a factor of @xmath62 compared to the value computed without atmosphere is possible . according to equation ( [ eq : a_lim ] ) such an enhancement of @xmath27 ( incorporated by increasing @xmath47 )",
    "would boost @xmath117 by a factor of @xmath134 .",
    "our present calculations assume that the core is accreting planetesimals continuously until the protoplanetary nebula dissipates  this is important at large @xmath14 since massive core requires long time to be built .",
    "but one may wonder if building smaller core in shorter time and then cutting off subsequent planetesimal accretion ( and energy release at the core surface , which supports atmosphere against going unstable ) completely may still lead to the ci and potentially extend it to larger semi - major axes .",
    "such accretion scenario has been adopted by e.g. pollack ( 1996 ) .",
    "the problem in this case is that even if @xmath135 it still takes long time for the atmosphere around the core to grow to the mass comparable to @xmath15 .",
    "ine0 show that this process occurs on thermal timescale of the atmosphere and typically takes millions of years .",
    "similar problem is also encountered in a scenario where the core grows rapidly by planetesimal accretion in the inner regions of protoplanetary disk and then gets scattered out to large radii by some massive perturber .",
    "one might expect that after the orbit of the scattered core circularizes by dynamical friction the core would gradually accrete massive atmosphere and undergo ci at some point . given that both the orbit circularization and envelope accretion are likely to take long time it is not at all obvious whether the ci could be achieved in this scenario within several myrs .",
    "there are many factors that can potentially reduce @xmath104 compared to 44 au estimated in equation ( [ eq : a_lim ] ) .",
    "for example , there are several reasons why it may not be possible for @xmath27 to reach the maximum rate @xmath40 .",
    "first , the growing core may clear out a gap in planetesimal disk around its orbit , thus significantly reducing @xmath27 ( tanaka & ida 1997 ; rafikov 2001 ; 2003a ) . in our previous calculations we implicitly assumed this not to happen e.g. because of the core migration through the disk , which allows fresh planetesimal material to be constantly supplied for core accretion ( alibert 2005 ) .",
    "second , as we mentioned in ",
    "[ sect : accr ] , a known pathway to @xmath136 is via the growth of the core to the size at which it starts dominating dynamical evolution of nearby planetesimals and triggers their efficient collisional fragmentation ( rafikov 2004 ) .",
    "however , there is a strong implicit assumption in this scenario  that the core can reach this critical size within the nebula lifetime .",
    "rafikov ( 2003b ) has shown that at @xmath137 au a dynamically dominant core would need to have mass of order @xmath138 g and would require on the order of @xmath139 myr to grow in the mmsn .",
    "this time scale is apparently in conflict with the typical dissipation times of protoplanetary disks .",
    "thus , one may need to either require a more massive disk at these radii or to find other pathways for accretion at @xmath40 .",
    "formation of massive solid bodies by direct gravitational instability facilitated by various streaming instabilities ( johansen 2009 ) may be quite relevant for the latter option .",
    "regardless of this ( arguably rather serious ) issue our estimate ( [ eq : a_lim ] ) still remains a useful upper limit on @xmath104 .    among other factors hindering the onset of ci and reducing @xmath104 we should mention the possibility of high opacity in the protoplanetary atmosphere .",
    "it was suggested in  [ subsect : opacity ] that @xmath128 may be very low because of the dust sedimentation and growth .",
    "however , infalling planetesimals which feed core accretion likely get partly disrupted in the atmosphere leaving behind large amount of refractory material .",
    "this may actually _ increase _ @xmath128 compared to the value of @xmath140 @xmath78 g@xmath127 assumed in equation ( [ eq : a_lim ] ) .",
    "nevertheless , given the weak sensitivity of @xmath104 to @xmath128 the potential increase of atmospheric opacity is unlikely to have huge effect on @xmath104 .",
    "we studied the formation of giant planets by core instability at different locations in the protoplanetary disk with the goal of determining the range of radii where the ci is feasible within the several myr lifetime of the protoplanetary disk .",
    "we demonstrate that this range is determined by two key factors :    * the high planetesimal accretion rate is necessary to build the solid core as rapidly as possible at large separations from the star .",
    "* intense energy release at the core surface caused by planetesimal accretion increases the critical core mass and delays the ci .",
    "the first factor turns out to be more important and the largest distance at which ci can happen , around 40 - 50 au , is obtained when @xmath27 is at its highest possible value corresponding to accretion of dynamically cold planetesimals .",
    "the core mass corresponding to this case is around @xmath141 m@xmath9 , likely compatible with the isolation mass at this distance .",
    "our approach is quite different from other similar studies which often assume that ( 1 ) accretion proceeds at much slower rate @xmath114 defined by equation ( [ eq : m_tr ] ) corresponding to accretion of planetesimals moving with random velocities at the level of @xmath142 and/or ( 2 ) the ci commences after the core has reached a fixed mass of around 10 m@xmath9 irrespective of the planetesimal accretion rate or the location in the disk . relaxing these two arbitrary assumptions we are able to obtain a significantly more robust and self - consistent limit on the ci operation which can be represented as a lower bound on the solid surface density ( @xmath1 g @xmath2 ) or an upper bound on the size of the region where the ci can get going within several myr timescale .",
    "these limits are insensitive to the mass of the central star and depend only weakly on the opacity in the core atmosphere .",
    "our predictions are relevant for interpreting the results of current and future direct imaging surveys ( marois 2008 ) designed to uncover and characterize the population of giant planets at large separations from their parent stars .",
    "author is grateful to ruth murray - clay for useful discussion and the suggestion of the limiting radius calculation for the marginally gravitationally unstable disk .",

[ [ eq : mdot ] ] , as in the @xmath73const case studied by ine0 ) . plugging this expression into ( [ eq : matm ] ) and using @xmath149 and equation ( [ eq : instab_cond ] ) we find m_crit=^s _ 0^sm^q , [ eq : m1 ] where q= ,   s= , [ eq : exps1 ] play the role of @xmath144 and @xmath145 in ine0 case .",
