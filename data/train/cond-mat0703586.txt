    "in the presence of a magnetic field , quantum magnets exhibit fascinating properties .",
    "in particular , it can happen that the uniform magnetization along the field exhibits plateaux for rational values , which has given rise to lots of theoretical  @xcite and experimental  @xcite work .",
    "the appearance of such plateaux was found to be favored by magnetic frustration .",

    "moreover , the possibility of having both orders , namely a supersolid , could potentially be observed in related compounds .",
    "as is well - known , frustration reduces triplet delocalization and thus , is favorable to solid behaviour , i.e. plateau formation , or supersolid behaviour . however , frustrated spin models are difficult to study numerically due to the sign - problem of the quantum monte - carlo ( qmc ) technique and the absence of reliable large - scale numerical techniques in two dimensions or higher",
    ". however , the effective bosonic models themselves can often be simulated when the frustration has disappeared and is absorbed in the effective parameters ; indeed , such effective bosonic models have been proposed either based on perturbation theory  @xcite or on phenomenological grounds .",
    "@xcite therefore , we think that it would be highly desirable to derive non - perturbative effective parameters directly from microscopic models and we propose to use the contractor - renormalization ( core ) technique to do so .",
    "the core method has been proposed in ref .   as a systematic algorithm to derive effective hamiltonians and operators that contain all the low - energy physics . in principle , these effective operators are given by an infinite cluster expansion .",
    "core has been successfully applied to a variety of both magnetic  @xcite and doped  @xcite low - dimensional systems and it turns out that , in most cases , the cluster expansion converges quite fast , which is a necessary condition for any practical implementation of this algorithm . still , the issue about core convergence is crucial and currently debated .",
    "@xcite    in section  [ ladder.sec ] , we remind the reader of the core algorithm and investigate the frustrated 2-leg ladder .",

    "the idea of this non - perturbative method is to derive an effective hamiltonian within a truncated basis set which allows to reproduce the low energy spectrum .",
    "this means that the original model is replaced by a model with fewer states but a more complicated hamiltonian under the condition that the retained states of the modified model have an overlap with the set of lowest lying eigenstates of the full original theory .    for clarity",

    "[ choicebasis.sec ] .",

    "one possibility is to iterate core in the renormalization group spirit and study the properties of its fixed point . here , following ref .",
    "[ ] , we propose to check the validity of the effective hamiltonian _",
    "after one step _ by comparing its properties to the exact ones on a given finite cluster . of course , once the effective hamiltonian has been shown to be accurate , it can be simulated exactly on much larger lattices than the original model , or thanks to other numerical techniques .",
    "for instance , although the original model is frustrated and can not be simulated efficiently by quantum monte - carlo ( qmc ) , there are cases where the effective hamiltonian can .",
    "we begin our core considerations for the spin @xmath4 antiferromagnetic heisenberg ladder with a rung as simplest possible basic cluster . because of the zeeman splitting , and as in the perturbation approach , we keep only two states per rung  : the singlet and the polarized triplet @xmath37 .",
    "then , we have computed up to range-8 effective core interactions by solving exactly up to 8 rungs . despite having an infinite cluster expansion in eq .",
    "( [ core_ham_def ] ) , previous studies have shown that , in many cases , the long - range effective interactions decay quickly so that they can be neglected beyond a certain range @xmath59 .",
    "this is a necessary condition for any practical implementation of core and should be checked systematically .    on fig .",
    "[ core_norm.fig ] , we plot the largest matrix element ( in absolute value ) of the range-@xmath59 connected contribution @xmath60 . for the coupling @xmath27 , @xmath61 , we indeed observe a strong decrease of the amplitudes of the different processes as a function of the range of interaction @xmath59 .",
    "this gives us confidence in the truncation beyond a certain range .",

    "[ pert_theo.sec ] , the range-2 effective hamiltonian will also be a @xmath46 model as in eq .",
    "( [ ham_sf ] ) .",
    "but for core , the dependence of @xmath42 , @xmath43 , and @xmath44 on the different interactions is different and reads : @xmath67 @xmath68 is the ground state energy of the @xmath69 plaquette which is found to be : @xmath70 consequently , the condition @xmath71 for the existence of a magnetization plateau at one half the saturation value translates into @xmath72 this criterion is shown on fig .",

    "note that a range-2 core calculation is quite simple , can be done analytically by solving a @xmath69 plaquette and already improves the accuracy with respect to perturbation theory .",
    "the limitations of this approach become evident for @xmath73 where naive implementation of core fails to reproduce the absence of magnetization plateaux and the matrix elements of @xmath60 do not decrease with increasing range @xmath59 , as shown for @xmath62 , @xmath63 in fig .",
    "[ core_norm.fig ] .",
    "there is a simple symmetry argument to understand why . for the specific case @xmath74 ,",
    "the hamiltonian has many additional symmetries , namely the exchange of the two spins on _ any _ given rung .",
    "therefore , it can be shown that the effective hoppings are strictly zero _ at all orders _ in the core approach , which of course leads to a gapped insulating phase at half - filling . indeed , in the core algorithm",
    ", it is necessary that the ground - state has a finite overlap in the reduced hilbert space .    in the vicinity of the line @xmath74 ,",
    "this argument is no longer strictly valid but , for practical calculations , we observe that in the core calculation , many overlaps become very small , which results in effective models that are not accurate .",
    "even if in principle , core could become accurate if longer - range interactions are taken into account , we think that in such cases , core loses its practical utility .    as we will discuss in the following , when the chosen basis does not represent correctly the ground - state , practical implementations of the core algorithm fail .",
    "when this is the case , several strategies are possible  : ( a ) keep other states for each block ; ( b ) keep more states for each block or ( c ) change the block .",
    "we now turn to the discussion of each case by focusing on what are the best block decomposition and/or states to keep .",
    "core will be useful when one can keep a small number of states per block and restrain to finite - range effective interactions . however , checking the convergence is not always easy ( except in 1d as we have shown on fig .",
    "[ core_convergence.fig ] ) so that it would be useful to have alternative information . in ref .",
    "[ ] , the authors proposed to used the reduced density matrix of the block as a tool to compute the relative weights of each block state .",
    "this procedure is similar to the density - matrix renormalization group method ( dmrg )  @xcite and can both help to choose the correct number of kept states , or indicate that a given block decomposition might not be appropriate .",
    "moreover , this analysis can be done independtly of core since it relies on an _ exact _ calculation and is rather easy since it can be done on small clusters  @xcite .",

    "we have considered a rung embedded in a larger cluster and we trace out the other spins in the exact density matrix obtained with the @xmath16 ground - state  @xcite ( gs ) @xmath76 . by diagonalizing this reduced density matrix , we obtain the probablity of finding a certain block state , given that the overall system has a wavefunction @xmath76 . for our choice of block",
    ", we obtain the weights of the rung states , namely the singlet @xmath36 and the 3 triplets .",
    "we immediately observe that the singlet weight vanishes or is very small when @xmath77 , which is precisely the region where a naive core calculation fails to reproduce the haldane phase . in such cases ,",

    "[ phase_diag.fig ] , a line indicates the region where the singlet weight becomes smaller than the @xmath49 triplet weight .",
    "it corresponds precisely to the region with large @xmath78 where exact results have shown that there is no magnetization plateau ( see fig .  [ size_plat_ed.fig ] ) . in this region",
    ", one needs to use other strategies for core .",
    "in most of core approaches , the kept states have been taken as the lowest in energy on a single block .",
    "this choice is of course natural and is often the best one .",
    "however , in the case where both @xmath14 and @xmath15 are close to @xmath31 , we will argue that this is not the case . from the reduced density matrix weight ( fig .",
    "[ dens_vert_dimer.fig ] ) , we have seen that the rung singlet state does not describe accurately the _ exact _ ground - state on a large system .",
    "therefore , a first modification to the standard core algorithm would be to keep the size of the truncated basis to 2 but take the largest - weight states , namely @xmath79 and @xmath37 in this region ( the 3-fold degenerate triplets will have a zeeman splitting in the presence of a magnetic field ) .",
    "as in the previous section , it is straightforward to compute _ analytically _ the range-2 effective hamiltonian that has again the form of @xmath42-@xmath43 model for spinless fermions as in eq .",

    "the reduced density matrix criterion gives us two useful informations  : ( i ) it gives a systematic way to locate the energy cut - off and fix how many low - lying states per block should be kept in the core approach ; ( ii ) it can also indicate that relevant block states are not necessarily the low - energy ones .",
