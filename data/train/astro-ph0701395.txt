    "one of the most intriguing aspects of modern cosmology is the formation of the first stars and galaxies .",
    "it is now widely believed that these first stars were very massive ; numerical simulations show that the collapse and fragmentation of primordial gas , where cooling relies on molecular hydrogen only , leads to popiii stars with masses @xmath3 ( e.g. @xcite ) . with few cooling mechanisms available",
    ", low mass star formation appears to have been initially suppressed . to enable the formation of low mass ( @xmath1 ) popii stars , additional metal coolants , generated in the first supernovae ,",
    "are required ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "little is known about the initial chemical enrichment of the universe .",
    "however , the onset of metal - pollution in the early universe must have played an important part in the transition from massive popiii to low - mass popii objects observable today .    currently , two general classes of competing models for the popiii ",
    "popii transition are discussed in the literature : _ ( i ) _ atomic fine - structure line cooling ( @xcite ) ; and _ ( ii ) _ dust - induced fragmentation ( e.g. @xcite ) . within the fine - structure model , cii and oi",
    "have been suggested as main coolants @xcite , such that low - mass star formation can occur in gas that is enriched beyond critical abundances of @xmath4}_{\\rm crit}\\simeq -3.5\\pm 0.1 $ ] and @xmath5}_{\\rm crit}\\simeq -3 \\pm 0.2 $ ] . }",
    "= \\log_{10}({n_{\\rm x}/n_{\\rm y}})_{\\star}-\\log_{10}({n_{\\rm x}/n_{\\rm y}})_{\\odot}$ ] , for elements x , y. ] the dust - cooling model , on the other hand , predicts critical abundances that are typically smaller by a factor of @xmath6 .",
    "this order - of - magnitude difference is much larger than the uncertainties within the fine - structure line model itself , which are still substantial , regarding the precise value of the critical abundances .",
    "also , elements other than c and o ( such as si and fe ) might contribute to the cooling ( e.g. @xcite ) , but are unlikely to exceed a factor of a few in the overall cooling rate .    without metals ,",
    "the primordial gas converges to the characteristic , or ` loitering ' , state of @xmath7k and @xmath8@xmath9 .",
    "numerical simulations identify this state as the main reason for the high mass - scale of popiii stars , because the gas undergoes a phase of slow , quasi - hydrostatic contraction during which any inhomogeneities that could seed further subfragmentation are wiped out by pressure forces ( see @xcite for details ) . cooling from dust , rather than metals in the gas phase , would only become important at higher densities , without influencing the evolution toward the loitering state , and hence the high mass - scale of popiii star formation ( @xcite ) .    ultimately , this theoretical debate has to be decided empirically .",
    "a way forward is to extensively test the fine - structure line model with observational data of c and o abundances found in old galactic metal - poor stars . in order to find the oldest , most `` primordial '' low mass stars , @xcite suggested to search for the most c- and o - poor objects .",
    "such abundances should reflect the level of a star s primordiality independent of the abundances of heavier elements ( e.g. fe ) .",
    "they may thus provide an important and feasible observational tool to constrain the formation mechanisms of the first low - mass stars in the high - redshift universe ( e.g. @xcite ) while also offering an empirical discrimination between the two cooling models .",
    "such constraints , in turn , should also provide clues to the relevance of the first generations of stars to cosmic reionization ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "detailed knowledge about the first epoch of star formation will also allow improved predictions for future high - redshift observations ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "together with the currently available data , the imminent arrival of large samples of metal - poor stars such as from segue or lamost @xcite , and the southern sky survey in the near future , provides an ideal test bed to empirically constrain and possibly differentiate between different cooling theories .",
    "to facilitate this test , we first note that we need a criterion for low - mass star formation that combines cooling due to cii and oi . our discussion is based on the theory presented in @xcite , and we here only summarize the main points of that theory in an idealized and simplified way for the convenience of the reader . to this extent ,",
    "let us consider the balance between fine - structure line cooling and adiabatic compressional heating : @xmath10 where all terms have to be evaluated at @xmath11 , @xmath12 .",
    "heating due to adiabatic compression is given by @xmath13 where @xmath14yr is the free - fall time at the characteristic state .",
    "the cooling terms are ( e.g. @xcite ) : @xmath15 and @xmath16 equation  ( 1 ) can then be written as @xmath17 } } + 0.3\\times 10^{\\scriptsize \\mbox{[o / h]}}\\ga 10^{-3.5 } \\mbox{\\ .}\\ ] ]    we thus introduce a new function , the ` transition discriminant ' : @xmath18 } } + 0.3\\times 10^{\\scriptsize",
    "\\mbox{[o / h]}}\\right)\\mbox{\\ , } \\ ] ]    such that low - mass star formation requires @xmath19 .",
    "this function reproduces the critical values in @xcite for the cases where only c or o are contributing to the cooling at the loitering state , and approximates the case where both are present by assuming that the individual cooling rates are simply added .",
    "the theoretical uncertainty estimated here again approximately reflects the analysis in @xcite .",
    "however , the true error could be significantly higher , but is difficult to reliably estimate without carrying out sophisticated three - dimensional simulations that incorporate all the relevant microphysics .",
    "such a comprehensive investigation is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "we note here that @xcite attempted to test their fine - structure model with ( rather limited ) observational data for c _ and _ o available at the time .",
    "the @xmath0 function now has the important advantage that cosmologically relevant measurements can be obtained from stellar c and/or o abundances ; in particular also from the common cases where only one of the two abundances is known .",
    "we collected data for c and/or o abundances for a wide range of metal - poor stars . in the cases where only one of the two abundances is available",
    ", @xmath0 is a lower limit .",
    "since we are searching for stars with the @xmath20 c and o abundances , knowledge of only one abundance is already sufficient to discriminate whether the star lies above @xmath21 .",
    "we are limited , in most cases , to the observations of metal - poor giants .",
    "as these stars ascend the red giant branch ( rgb ) , internal mixing takes place that changes the surface c abundance .",
    "a consequence of cno processing is an increase of the n abundances at the expense of c. hence , such mixed objects appear to have low(er ) c abundances that do not reflect the chemical composition with which they were born .    in the absence of information of the n abundance",
    "it is difficult to assess the degree of mixing the star has undergone . a rough estimate , however , can be obtained from the luminosity of the objects . @xcite investigated abundances of moderately metal - poor stars of different evolutionary stages , traced by luminosity . at @xmath22",
    "they find a decline of c abundances in line with the star ascending the giant branch beyond the rgb - bump @xcite that is responsible for extra mixing processes . according to figure  10 and table  7 in @xcite",
    ", we thus correct the c abundances of stars with luminosities @xmath23 by simply applying an appropriate offset .",
    "@xcite have available cno abundances which allowed them to extensively test their sample of giants for signs of mixing .",
    "we corrected their `` mixed '' giants in the same way as the other giants with no available `` mixing '' information . for comparison , we also calculated c - depletion - corrected lower limits of @xmath0 for objects that are enhanced in c ( but have no o data available ) .",
    "as expected , the c - rich objects are separated from the `` c - normal '' stars . amongst those stars",
    "are the two most iron - poor stars @xcite which have large c and o overabundances .",
    "in figure  [ dtrans ] ( top panel ) we test @xmath21 with halo data .",
    "we remind the reader that most of the data are lower limits because of missing c or o abundances .",
    "the c - based lower limits , however , are much more robust than those derived from o because @xmath0 , by definition , is dominated by the c abundance .",
    "all stars lie above the `` forbidden zone '' ( as marked in figure  [ dtrans ] ) or within a typical observational error ( 0.2 to 0.3dex ) to the critical limit of @xmath21 .",
    "there appears to be a lower envelope of the overall distribution of the data . keeping in mind that most of the values are lower limits",

    "most of the stars only have an o abundance available . with one exception",
    ", none of them has a metallicity less than @xmath2}\\sim-2.5 $ ] .",
    "this finding has recently been investigated by @xcite who consistently find a significant lack of metal - poor stars with @xmath2}<-3.0 $ ] in several dsph galaxies . in the absence of low metallicity stars these dsph systems",
    "must have had available sufficient amounts of at least c and o at an early time to avoid the formation of very metal - poor stars .",
    "we caution that the sample of collected data is not complete .",
    "the attempt was rather to populate the diagram with different groups of objects to study the overall stellar behaviour .",
    "purposely , we included stars with normal and enhanced c. any currently seen `` substructure '' ( e.g. the two groups that appear to be well separated ) within the data results from our limited selection . hence , further data should be added to fully map the diagram to clearly identify the `` observable '' @xmath0 region(s ) .    despite our interest in stars with low c and o abundances",
    ", we note that there is a simple observational bias against c and o deficient objects . obviously , it is easier to measure high abundances resulting in strong spectral features rather than weak ones . in particular , it is difficult , if not impossible , to detect features from elements of low abundances in warmer , unevolved main - sequence stars .",
    "insufficient data quality may lead to additional non - detections of elemental lines of interest .",
    "hence , c and/or o deficient stars , even if known , likely have available only upper limits , or no such abundance data at all .    for the region @xmath24}\\lesssim-3.0 $ ] , close to the `` forbidden zone '' ( see figure  [ dtrans ] ) , we attempted to collect as much data as possible to avoid missing any extremely c - o deficient objects .",
    "since no stars are currently known with @xmath25}\\lesssim-4 $ ] no data are missing from this region .",
    "if c and o indeed played such an important role in the formation of the first low - mas stars , it is crucial to obtain further information by means of more objects ( particularly main sequence stars ) with c and o deficiencies .",
    "these stars can provide the most accurate picture of the chemical conditions in the early universe in terms of the availability of cooling agents .",
    "it is not clear at this point what the lower end of c and o underabundances may be , and the current data , strictly speaking , only provide an observational upper limit on the critical level of @xmath0 .",
    "we therefore encourage observers to search for more objects with c and o deficiencies to obtain good measures of @xmath0 as close as possible to the critical value , or even below it .    regardless of observational difficulties ,",
    "it has been suggested that the most metal - poor objects are more likely to reside in the bulge rather than in the halo of the galaxy @xcite .",
    "this may imply an additional selection effect of our sample .",
    "however , recent work by @xcite has shown that the fraction of metal - poor stars in the halo may not differ greatly from that in the bulge ( see also @xcite ) , suggesting that the halo abundances shown in figure  [ dtrans ] may indeed be representative of the most metal - poor stars in the milky way ( but see @xcite ) .",
    "we use stellar archaeology to observationally constrain theoretical ideas concerning the formation of the first low - mass stars .",
    "in particular , our literature sample of halo stars provides a firm observational test for the critical metallicity as predicted by @xcite .",
    "no star is lying in the forbidden zone .",
    "this behaviour is consistent with fine - structure line cooling of c and o governing the transition from popiii to popii stars in the early universe .",
    "it is also consistent with the theory based on dust cooling @xcite , which predicts a much lower critical metallicity .",
    "however , this latter theory can not easily explain the complete absence of any stars with @xmath26 .",
    "another point of interest in figure  [ dtrans ] concerns the crossover of the solar abundance line into the forbidden zone .",
    "this happens at @xmath2}\\sim-4 $ ] .",
    "the `` c - normal '' stars in the top panel well follow the solar trend down to this metallicity .",
    "no metal - poor stars are known with @xmath2}<-4 $ ] with the exception of two objects that display rather exotic , non - solar - scaled , abundance patterns .",
    "their unusual behaviour is clearly reflected in our diagram .",
    "if they were to have solar - scaled abundances at @xmath2}<-5 $ ] , they would need to follow the trend given by all the other stars and would fall right into the forbidden zone .",
    "this would have been in conflict with our prediction .",
    "we note though , that stars with @xmath27 might have formed in the early universe .",
    "however , according to the @xcite theory , they would not have been of low - mass , and hence would have already died a long time ago , rendering them unobservable in present - day surveys . as a consequence , any stars with iron abundances lower than @xmath2}\\sim-4 $ ] should not display scaled - down solar abundance patterns as already found in the two stars with @xmath2}<-5 $ ] .",
    "the chemical behaviour , at least concerning c and o , should be very different , in line with a @xmath0 value above the critical threshold .",
    "the paucity of stars with @xmath2}<-2.5 $ ] in dsph galaxies and globular clusters , as compared to those in the galactic halo , suggests that the most metal - poor stars in these systems formed in a different environment ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "many globular clusters are likely to have formed in merging galaxies , ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "likewise , it has been suggested that some dwarf galaxies may form in the tidal tails of merging galaxies @xcite .",
    "also , interestingly , the oldest populations of stars in local dwarf galaxies appear to be very similar in age to the oldest galactic globular clusters @xcite , consistent with these systems having formed through mergers in the early evolution of the milky way and the local group .",
    "if globular clusters and dwarf galaxies do indeed form in the mergers of previous - generation galaxies , then the initial metallicity of the gas in these systems would have been that of the larger , merging galaxies responsible for their formation . the most metal - poor globular cluster and dwarf galaxy stars",
    "would then have formed from gas enriched by previous episodes of star formation that occurred in their parent merging galaxies .",
    "the merging galaxies themselves would , in turn , contain halo stars that formed at earlier epochs characterised by gas of lower metallicity .",
    "this may explain the lack of stars with @xmath2}\\lesssim-3 $ ] observed in local dsph galaxies , as well as the difference between the metal - poor tail of the metallicity distribution of these systems and that of the galactic halo @xcite .",
    "recent simulations of the formation of dwarf galaxies from primordial gas at high redshift @xcite predict a metal - poor tail of the metallicity distribution that extends well below @xmath2}<-3 $ ] .",
    "clearly , this is not observed for the nearby dsph galaxies observed by @xcite .",
    "this may be further evidence that some dwarf galaxies are formed in the mergers of pre - enriched larger galaxies , as opposed to being formed from primordial gas in the early universe .",
    "while the enrichment of the primordial gas to levels of @xmath28 may be required for the formation of low - mass stars , this may not be a sufficient requirement on its own .",
    "it has been suggested that the temperature floor set by the cosmic microwave background , @xmath29 , may imply a redshift dependent characteristic mass of stars formed in the early universe ( e.g. @xcite ; but see also @xcite ) .",
    "gas can not radiatively cool to below @xmath30 , hence , the fragmentation mass in collapsing gas clouds may be larger , in general , at higher redshifts .",
    "thus , low - mass stars ( @xmath1 ) that can survive until today may not readily form above a certain redshift , @xmath31 , above which only higher mass stars are likely to form , regardless of the metallicity of the gas .",
    "this scenario suggests an explanation for the observed lack of scatter in the abundance ratios of homogeneously analysed low metallicity stars ( @xcite ; see also @xcite ) .",
    "while the formation of massive stars likely begins at redshifts @xmath32 , stars with masses @xmath33 may not be able to form until later times when the @xmath30 is sufficiently low , at redshifts @xmath34 .",
    "this delay between the onset of high - mass and low - mass star formation may have given ample time for the ejecta from many supernovae to become mixed in the buildup of the galaxy before low - mass stars were finally able to form .",
    "if indeed there is an explicit redshift dependence on the minimum mass of stars that may form , then future observations of high redshift systems should find that only massive stars form at redshifts @xmath35 , largely independent of the degree of metal enrichment in these systems .",
    "the recent discovery of a massive post - starburst galaxy at @xmath36 by @xcite allows to place a firm limit of @xmath37 .",
    "our literature collection of metal - poor abundance data supports the notion that fine - structure c and o line cooling predominantly drives the transition from popiii to popii stars in the early universe . to refine or refute this theory , more abundances of existing and future metal - poor star data",
    "should be added to figure  [ dtrans ] .",
    "the ultimate goal is to understand the details of when and how the first low - mass stars formed",
