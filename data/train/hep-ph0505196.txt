    "consideration of the axial - vector @xmath4 and vector @xmath5 current - current correlator in the soft external electromagnetic field @xmath6 is an important part of the calculations of the complicated light - by - light scattering amplitude related to the problem of accurate computation of higher order hadronic contributions to muon anomalous magnetic moment . in this",

    "it is convenient to parameterize the @xmath11 correlator ( fig .",
    "[ w6 ] ) in terms of longitudinal @xmath12 and transversal @xmath13 with respect to axial current index lorentz invariant amplitudes @xmath14   .\\label{tt}%\\ ] ] both lorentz structures are transversal with respect to vector current , @xmath15 . as for the axial current , the first structure is transversal with respect to @xmath16 while the second one is longitudinal and thus anomalous .",
    "the appearance of the longitudinal structure is the consequence of the adler - bell - jackiw axial anomaly @xcite .        for the nonsinglet axial current @xmath17",
    "there are no perturbative @xcite and nonperturbative @xcite corrections to the axial anomaly and , as consequence , the invariant function @xmath18 remains intact when interaction with gluons is taken into account .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that in the nonsinglet channel the transversal structure @xmath19 is also free from perturbative corrections .",
    "nonperturbative nonrenormalization of the nonsinglet longitudinal part follows from the t  hooft consistency condition @xcite , i.e.  the exact quark - hadron duality realized as a correspondence between the infrared singularity of the quark triangle and the massless pion pole in terms of hadrons .",
    "however , for the singlet axial current @xmath20 due to the gluonic @xmath3 anomaly there is no massless state even in the chiral limit .",
    "instead , the massive @xmath21 meson appears .",
    "so , one expects nonperturbative renormalization of the singlet anomalous amplitude @xmath22 at momenta below @xmath21 mass .    in the previous work @xcite we analyzed in the framework of the instanton liquid model @xcite the nonperturbative properties of the nonsinglet triangle diagram in the kinematics specified above .",
    "we demonstrated how the anomalous structure @xmath23 is saturated within the instanton liquid model .",
    "we also calculated the transversal invariant function @xmath19 at arbitrary @xmath24 and show that within the instanton model at large @xmath25 there are no power corrections to this structure .",
    "the nonperturbative corrections to @xmath19 at large @xmath25 have exponentially decreasing behavior related to the short distance properties of the instanton nonlocality in the qcd vacuum .",
    "the present work is devoted to the study of the @xmath3 anomaly effect on the singlet @xmath11 correlator within the instanton liquid model .",
    "we calculate in the chiral limit the longitudinal @xmath22 and transversal @xmath1 invariant functions at arbitrary momentum transfer @xmath24 and demonstrate how the singlet anomalous @xmath22 part of the correlator @xmath22 is renormalized at low momenta due to presence of the @xmath3 anomaly .",
    "the amplitude for the triangle diagram can be written as a correlator of the axial current @xmath26 and two vector currents @xmath27 and @xmath28 ( fig . [ w6 ] ) @xmath29 where for light @xmath30 and @xmath31 quarks one has in the local theory @xmath32 the quark field @xmath33 has color ( @xmath34 ) and flavor ( @xmath35 ) indices , @xmath36 @xmath37  are flavor matrix of the axial current , and @xmath38 are the charge matrices , with the tilted current being for the soft momentum photon vertex .    in the local perturbative theory the one - loop result ( fig .",
    "[ w6]a ) for the invariant functions @xmath13 and @xmath12 for space - like momenta @xmath24 @xmath39 is @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the color number , and for light quark masses one takes @xmath42 . in the chiral limit , @xmath43 ,",
    "one gets the result @xmath44",
    "to study nonperturbative effects in the triangle amplitude @xmath45 at low and intermediate momenta one can use the framework of the effective approach based on the representation of qcd  vacuum as an ensemble of strong vacuum fluctuations of gluon field , instantons .",
    "spontaneous breaking the chiral symmetry and dynamical generation of a momentum - dependent quark mass are naturally explained within the instanton liquid model .",
    "the instanton fluctuations characterize nonlocal properties of the qcd  vacuum @xcite .",
    "the interaction of light @xmath46 quarks in the instanton vacuum can be described in terms of the effective t hooft four - quark action with nonlocal kernel induced by quark zero modes in the instanton field .",
    "the gauged version of the model @xcite meets the symmetry properties with respect to external gauge fields , and corresponding vertices satisfy the ward - takahashi identities .    in the framework of this effective model the nonsinglet @xmath5 and @xmath4 current - current correlators , the vector adler function , the pion transition form factor",
    "have been calculated for arbitrary current virtualities in @xcite . in the same model",
    "the topological susceptibility of the qcd  vacuum which is reduced to the singlet @xmath4 current - current correlator has been considered in @xcite .    the spin - flavor structure of the nonlocal chirally invariant interaction of soft quarks is given by the matrix products sector of the model . ] @xmath47 where @xmath48 and @xmath49 are 4-quark couplings in iso - triplet and singlet channels . for the interaction in the form of t hooft determinant one has the relation @xmath50 . in general due to repulsion in the singlet channel the relation @xmath51 is required .    within the gauged instanton model the dressed quark propagator in the chiral limit , @xmath52 ,",
    "is defined as @xmath53 with the momentum - dependent quark mass @xmath54 found as the solution of the gap equation @xmath55 where we denote @xmath56 the constant @xmath57 in ( [ mp ] ) is determined dynamically from eq .",
    "( [ sdeq ] ) and the function @xmath58 defines the nonlocal kernel of the four - quark interaction . within the instanton model",
    "@xmath58 describing the momentum distribution of quarks in the nonperturbative qcd vacuum is expressed through the quark zero mode function .",
    "it is implied in @xcite that the quark zero mode in the instanton field is taken in the axial gauge when the gauge dependent dynamical quark mass is defined . in particular it means that @xmath58 for large arguments decreases like some exponential in @xmath59 to make numerics simpler we shell use the gaussian form @xmath60 where the parameter @xmath61 characterizes the size of nonlocal fluctuations in the qcd vacuum and it is proportional to the inverse average size of an instanton .",
    "the vector vertex following from the instanton model is @xcite ( fig .",
    "[ w5]a ) @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the finite - difference derivative of the dynamical quark mass , @xmath24 is the momentum corresponding to the current , and @xmath64 @xmath65 is the incoming ( outgoing ) momentum of the quark , @xmath66 .",
    "the finite - difference derivative of an arbitrary function @xmath67 is defined as @xmath68        the nonlocal part of the vertex ( [ gv ] ) necessarily appears in order to fit the vector ward - takahashi identity .    within the chiral quark model @xcite based on the non - local structure of instanton vacuum @xcite the full singlet axial - vector vertex including local and nonlocal pieces",
    "is given by @xcite @xmath69 where @xmath70 here and below we use the notations @xmath71    the vertex ( [ g50 ] ) takes into account the quark - antiquark rescattering in the singlet axial channel ( fig .",
    "[ w5]b ) . for completeness",
    "we also present the vertex corresponding to the conserved iso - triplet axial - vector current which in the chiral limit is given by @xcite @xmath72   .\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the isotriplet axial - vector vertex has a massless pole , @xmath73 , that follows from the spontaneous breaking of the chiral symmetry in the limit of massless @xmath30 and @xmath31 quarks .",
    "evidently , this pole corresponds to the massless goldstone pion .",
    "the singlet current ( [ g50 ] ) does not contain massless pole due to presence of the @xmath3 anomaly .",
    "indeed , as @xmath74 there is compensation between denominator and numerator in ( [ g50 ] ) @xmath75 where @xmath76 is the pion weak decay constant . in cancellation of the massless pole the gap equation is used . instead , the singlet current develops a pole at the @xmath77 meson mass meson . ]",
    "@xmath78 thus solving the @xmath79 problem .",
    "let us also remind that in the instanton chiral quark model the connection between the gluon and effective quark degrees of freedom is fixed by the gap equation .",
    "in the effective instanton - like model the nondiagonal correlator of vector current and singlet axial - vector current in the external electromagnetic field ( @xmath11 ) is given by ( fig .",
    "[ w6]b ) @xmath80   , \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the quark propagator , the vector and the axial - vector vertices are defined by ( [ quarkprop ] ) , ( [ gv ] ) and ( [ g50 ] ) , respectively .",
    "the structure of the vector vertex ( [ gv ] ) guarantees that the amplitude is transversal with respect to vector indices @xmath81 and the lorentz structure of the amplitude is given by ( [ tt ] ) .    in @xcite we found for the nonsinglet axial current @xmath82 the expressions for the longitudinal amplitude @xmath83 and for the combination of invariant functions which shows up the nonperturbative dynamics @xmath84",

    "the result ( [ a4tot ] ) which is independent of the details of the nonlocal effective model is in agreement with the statement about absence of nonperturbative corrections to the nonsinglet longitudinal invariant function that follows from the t hooft duality arguments .",
    "the calculations of the singlet @xmath11 correlator results in the following modification of the nonsinglet amplitudes@xmath87 where @xmath88 .\\label{dw0}%\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    in @xcite it was shown that in the chiral limit the nonsinglet transversal amplitude gets only exponentially suppressed at large momenta corrections .",
    "the reason is that the asymptotics of the amplitude ( [ wltf ] ) is proportional to the vacuum nonlocality function @xmath89 that is necessarily has exponentially decreasing asymptotics .",
    "the singlet amplitudes differ from the nonsinglet ones by the term ( [ dw0 ] ) that also has exponentially suppressed large @xmath25 asymptotics .",
    "thus , within the instanton model the singlet longitudinal and transversal parts have only exponentially suppressed at large @xmath25 corrections and all allowed by operator product expansion power corrections are canceled each other .",
    "3 illustrates how the singlet longitudinal amplitude @xmath0 is renormalized at low momenta by the presence of the @xmath3 anomaly .",
    "the behavior of @xmath90 is presented in fig .",
    "4 . in both figures",
    "the corresponding results for the nonsinglet case are also shown .",
    "the values of the model parameters used in calculations are fixed earlier in @xcite as @xmath91 the coupling @xmath49 is fixed by fitting the meson spectrum .",
    "approximately one has @xmath92 @xcite .",
    "we also find numerical values of the invariant amplitudes at zero virtuality@xmath93 precise form and even sign of @xmath94 strongly depend on the ratio of couplings @xmath95 and has to be defined in the calculations with more realistic choice of model parameters .",
    "in the framework of the instanton liquid model we have calculated for arbitrary momenta transfer the nondiagonal correlator of the singlet axial - vector and vector currents in the background of a soft vector field . for this specific kinematics we find that in the chiral limit the large momenta power corrections are absent for both longitudinal @xmath12 as well transversal @xmath13 invariant amplitudes .",
    "these amplitudes have very similar behavior and are corrected only by exponentially small terms which reflect the nonlocal structure of qcd vacuum .    within the instanton model the renormalization of the singlet longitudinal @xmath22 amplitude occurring at low momenta due to the @xmath3 anomaly",
    "is demonstrated explicitly . in the nonsinglet case",
    "the behavior of @xmath12 and @xmath13 at low momenta is very different due to the contribution of the massless pion state . at the same time in the singlet case",
    "there is no massless state and the deflection of @xmath12 from @xmath96 amplitudes is rather small .",
