    "extensive research and development have been done recently on quantum information and communication technologies . among various media for quantum information and communication , the photon - number fock space is promising in the point that it provides higher dimensional states such as qutrits to carry more information than qubits .",

    "an experimental realization of quantum scissors has been done recently , generating a qubit of vacuum and one - photon state by truncating a coherent state @xcite .",
    "it is also interesting that an experimental result has been reported for the teleportation of the vacuum - one - photon qubit @xcite .",
    "the number - sum bell measurement accordingly plays an essential role for engineering the photon - number states via teleportation .",
    "some feasible schemes have appeared recently for implementing particularly the joint measurement of number - sum and phase - difference with linear optics @xcite , and an experimental demonstration has also been reported @xcite .",

    "we analyze the linear optical realization of number - sum bell measurement and number - state manipulation by taking into account the realistic experimental situation , specifically imperfectness of single - photon detector . the present scheme for number - state manipulation",
    "is based on the number - sum bell measurement , which is implemented with linear optical elements , i.e. , beam splitters , phase shifters and zero - one - photon detectors . as for the optical sources ,",
    "many useful manipulations of number - states are realized with squeezed vacuum states and coherent states , which are widely used in optical experiments , while single - photon sources may not be required @xcite .",
    "beam splitters and phase shifters will be available with high accuracy .",
    "on the other hand , photon detectors are currently developed devices , which in practice have finite quantum efficiency and nonzero dark count rate .",
    "hence , for feasible experiments it is desired to provide a systematic method to evaluate the efficiency of number - state manipulation with number - sum bell measurement , by taking into account the imperfectness of actual photon detectors .",

    "<S> then , the fidelity of manipulation and preparation of number - states , particularly for qubits and qutrits , is evaluated in terms of the quantum efficiency and dark count of single - photon detector . </S>",
    "<S> it is found that a high fidelity is achievable with small enough squeezing parameters and coherent state amplitudes . </S>"
