    "in diffractive hard scattering , the incident hadron in e - p collisions and one or both hadrons in @xmath2 collisions participate in a hard interaction involving very large momentum transfer , but nevertheless the respective hadrons emerge with small transverse momenta and a loss of small fractions of their longitudinal momenta . for such diffractive hard processes ,",
    "first comes a question of pure semantics , whether or not to say the diffractive proton `` exchanged a pomeron '' .",
    "only one pomeron has entitled historical rights to this name , and that is the pomeron of soft regge physics @xcite ( also sometimes called the soft pomeron ) .",
    "reference to pomeron in any other case exploits this established trademark as a mnemonic for describing some portion of the process in which a strong interaction scattering occurred that involved the exchange of no quantum numbers except angular momentum . in our discussion of diffractive hard scattering",
    ", we will use the lower case pomeron in reference to a process in which one or both incoming hadrons diffracts into the final state along with a hard process . on the other hand",
    ", the upper case pomeron will be reserved for the vacuum exchange trajectory of soft regge physics @xcite .",
    "there is general belief that properties of the pomeron reflect in the pomeron of diffractive hard scattering , although it is a central research question to identify the specifics .",
    "spacetime arguments generically suggest that hard events are well localized in space and time .",
    "thus it is expected that in a diffractive hard process , the diffractive hadrons undergo effects similar to what they would encounter in a high - energy elastic scattering . as such , diffractive hard physics",
    "is expected to involve long - time , long distance , thus nonperturbative , physics .",
    "nevertheless , that hard processes can occur intermittent to the diffractive scattering indicates that diffractive hadronic physics , via the pomeron , also possesses perturbative properties that can be explained through perturbative qcd .",
    "a primary goal of diffractive hard scattering physics is to unify the qcd picture of the pomeron with the phenomenological regge physics description ( for a review of regge phenomenology applied to diffractive physics please see @xcite ) .",
    "hard double pomeron exchange ( dpe ) processes are useful in addressing this question , since it turns out the qcd and regge physics description of these processes have some distinct qualitative differences , which are best expressed in the context of hard factorization .",
    "recall , for a hard scattering factorized process , the effect of the two incoming particles act independently on the hard event @xcite .",
    "the basic regge physics motivated model of hard diffractive processes is the ingelman - schlein model @xcite , and this model assumes hard factorization . in their model , diffractive scattering is attributed to the exchange of a pomeron , which operationally is defined as a colorless object with vacuum quantum numbers .",
    "their model treats the pomeron like a real particle and so considers , for example , that a diffractive electron - proton collision is due to an electron - pomeron collision and that a diffractive hadron - hadron collision is due to a proton - pomeron collision for single - sided diffraction and pomeron - pomeron collision for double diffraction .    for diffractive deep inelastic scattering ,",
    "basic ideas of hard factorization were outlined and diffractive parton distribution functions were defined in @xcite .",
    "a proof of factorization for diffractive dis was given in @xcite .",
    "for hard diffraction in pure hadronic collisions , collins , frankfurt and strikman ( cfs ) @xcite have demonstrated a counterargument to hard factorization .",
    "the cfs mechanism is a leading twist effect in which all the momentum lost by the diffractive hadrons goes into the hard event .",
    "an important feature about the cfs mechanism is that it requires the color flow properties of qcd in an essential way . in general",
    ", the presence of color in qcd implies pomeron exchange in simplest form is a two gluon exchange process @xcite .",
    "necessarily , the simplest model of the pomeron must involve at least two partons in order to be color singlet .",
    "the two gluon pomeron model has a key property for any pure hadron initiated reaction , which is a realization of the cfs mechanism .",
    "consider the hard dpe process @xmath3 , where @xmath4 are the colliding hadrons .",
    "the two gluons exchanged by @xmath5 are not both obliged to enter the hard event . instead",
    ", one gluon may attach to @xmath6 . in this case , the two incoming hadrons no longer act independently in inducing the hard event . by definition of hard factorization @xcite ,",
    "such a process is nonfactorizing .",
    "this mechanism was identified earlier by frankfurt and strikman @xcite .",
    "they originally referred to the nonfactorized pomeron of cfs as the coherent pomeron .",
    "subsequently , the ua8 presented results @xcite in which up to 30 percent of the dijet events in single - sided diffraction could be associated with the coherent pomeron , which they in turn named the superhard pomeron . with the hindsight of the ua8 experiment and the ideas of cfs , in @xcite the cfs mechanism was applied to a toy quantum field theory model of diffractive dijet photoproduction , in which the pomeron was represented by two gluon exchange .",
    "this work in turn , in turn , named the nonfactorizing , alias superhard , alias coherent pomeron process as lossless diffractive hard scattering to emphasize the efficient transfer of the pomeron momentum to the hard process .    the cfs mechanism has been developed for hard dpe in @xmath7 collisions for quark jets in @xcite and gluon jets in @xcite .",
    "the gluon jet process was shown in @xcite to dominate the quark jet process by several orders of magnitude .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to examine for the dpe dijet process , general differences between the factorized pomeron model of ingelman and schlein , f(is)dpe @xcite , and the nonfactorized pomeron model of lossless jet production of berera and collins @xcite , n(l)dpe .",
    "our notation specifies in the context of hard factorization whether the process is factorizable , f , or nonfactorizable , n , and in parenthesis gives the particular type of process .",
    "the latter specification is necessary since there are several different types of factorizable and nonfactorizable processes .",
    "detailed discussions about this point are in @xcite . as one example , factorized processes first have a basic distinction between simple hard factorization and the more specific regge factorization @xcite . in particular , the factorized ingelman - schlein dpe model also is regge factorized .    for nonfactorization ,",
    "one example outside of the cfs mechanism is the `` flux renormalization '' prescription of goulianos @xcite , which arises due to a breakdown of the triple - regge theory for soft diffractive excitation .",
    "also , nonfactorization is found in pre - qcd analysis of diffractive processes @xcite . an empirical analysis by alvero , collins and whitmore @xcite of the preliminary cdf double diffractive dijet data @xcite indicates that hard factorization is violated in this process .",
    "in fact , their analysis suggests for parton distribution functions that are most consistent over all diffractive processes , the experimental dpe dijet cross section is much less than expected by factorization . on the other hand ,",
    "the nonfactorizing cfs mechanism should enhance the cross section . nevertheless , the analysis in @xcite does not rule - out experimental realization of the cfs mechanism , since general understanding from regge models suggests that there is a large source of suppression which will emerge from effects generically termed absorptive corrections .",
    "these effect are due to exchanges of pomerons and gluons between particles in the basic model that possess very different rapidities , thus in particular between the two incoming hadrons . as such , these effects also are nonfactorizing .",
    "actual computation of absorptive corrections is nontrivial since they are nonperturbative .",
    "some work has been done to estimate their effects @xcite .",
    "a general conclusion of these works is that absorptive correction effects are independent of the hard kinematics and weakly s - dependent .",
    "as such , these effects should be very easy to distinguish from the n(l)dpe process .",
    "also , these effects only should shift , in particular decrease , the values of the cross sections from those computed in our basic models and the effect should be the same for either the f(is)dpe or n(l)dpe processes . in this paper",
    ", we are interested in examining qualitative differences between the f(is)dpe and n(l)dpe processes , which are minimally model dependent . for this we will examine the @xmath0 and mean rapidity ( @xmath1 ) spectra for both processes and for the cuts of cdf , d  and representative cuts for lhc .",
    "we also will present total cross sections for all the models and all the experimental cuts .",
    "thus the interested reader can test any suppression factor from any absorptive correction model that they wish .",
    "the reason that we do not give a demonstrative example of the overall absorptive correction suppression factor is that , as will be seen in the sequal , for all the models that are examined , we find disagreement in the ratios of the cross sections from those found in the available experimental data .",
    "this discrepancy minimally is of order @xmath8 .",
    "present understanding about absorptive corrections can not explain this discrepancy , since their effect only is to shift the cross sections by the same overall correction factor which drops out in the ratios .",
    "this discrepancy may reflect upon a limitation of our partonic level calculations or other controllable theoretical sources , or it may be that since the experimental data is still preliminary , it may yet be modified .",
    "we will not attempt to formulate any theoretical explanations for this discrepancy found in this paper .",
    "our modest goal is to examine the predictions of the basic models , which up to now still have not adequately been done for these processes .",
    "of special interest is to identify features that are minimally model dependent .",
    "furthermore , in light of the breakdown of hard factorization suggested in @xcite , it is important to know whether any features of the basic models are seem in the data .",

    "the small transfer of longitudinal momentum to the hard process implies large rapidity gaps between the jets and the two outgoing hadrons .",

    "@xmath39 is the parton 2 to 2 cross section , which is the same as in the above inclusive case eq .",

    "@xmath52 is known as the pomeron intercept which for the soft pomeron is @xmath53 @xcite .",
    "the pomeron parton densities used here are those of alvero , collins , terron and whitmore ( hereafter actw ) @xcite .",
    "their fits were to diffractive deep inelastic and diffractive photoproduction of jets , in which @xmath52 was a free parameter that was fit to data and found to be @xmath54 .",

    "the models will be denoted as actw a , b , c , d , and sg . the precise description of these models can be found in sect .",
    "iid . of their paper . in brief , the models a - d use conventional shapes for the initial distributions . model a represents a conventional hard quark parametrization , b has in addition to a an initial gluon distribution , c has in addition to a a soft quark distribution , and d has both additions to a. the final model , sg , has a gluon distribution that is peaked near @xmath55 .",
    "this form was motivated by the fit obtained by the h1 collaboration . in @xcite",
    ", they refer to it also as the `` super - hard gluon '' .",
    "our expression for the n(l)dpe dijet cross section is based on the toy quantum field theory model in @xcite which in effect is the model of low - nussinov - gunion - soper @xcite .",
    "the n(l)dpe dijet cross section expression obtained here extends from @xcite to account for the one - loop sudakov suppression factor .",
    "we presented preliminary results with sudakov suppression in @xcite .",
    "our treatment of sudakov suppression is the same as by martin , ryskin , and khoze @xcite .",
    "in fact , at one - loop order the nonabelian expression required here is the same as the abelian expression of sudakov @xcite which in the context of hard scattering was obtained earlier by collins @xcite .",
    "the only difference is , the abelian expression must be multiplied by an overall group theory factor to account for the additional color degrees in the nonabelian case .    for the n(l)dpe model in fig .",
    "[ dpamp12]b , @xmath11 and @xmath12 again are the longitudinal momentum fractions lost by proton and antiproton respectively . in difference to the f(is)dpe case , the momentum fractions for the incoming partons to the hard process are equal to those lost by the protons , @xmath56 and @xmath57 or equivalently @xmath58 .",
    "qualitatively this means all the momentum lost by the diffractive protons is transferred into the hard process .",
    "this kinematics is similar to the superhard component reported for the case of single - sided diffractive dijet production by the ua8 @xcite .",
    "our expression for the n(l)dpe dijet differential cross section is @xmath59 where @xmath60 here , the  polarization \" vectors are defined as @xmath61 @xmath62 are hadronic form factors with the explicit expressions of our model in eqs .",
    "( 10 ) - ( 12 ) of @xcite , and @xmath63 is the hard amplitude .",
    "two hard subprocesses are possible , @xmath64 and @xmath65 .",
    "the calculations in @xcite showed that the latter process gives zero contribution to the n(l)dpe dijet cross section when the final state transverse momentum of the two diffractive hadrons is zero .",
    "this should suppress quark jet production relative to gluon jet production . in @xcite this expectation was explicitly confirmed .",
    "thus only the @xmath64 hard process is relevant for n(l)dpe production .. the explicit expressions for @xmath63 for this process are given in appendix a of @xcite .",

    "is fixed up to an overall normalization which implicitly is specified through the hadronic form factors @xmath72 .",
    "based on the same quantum field theory model , an expression for the hadron - hadron elastic scattering amplitude can be determined and that expression involves the same hadronic form factors @xmath72 .",
    "in fact this expression for the elastic scattering amplitude essentially is the one of low - nussinov @xcite and gunion - soper @xcite .",
    "thus the free parameter in our n(l)dpe model that fixes the overall normalization of @xmath71 is chosen to yield the experimental value of the @xmath73 forward elastic cross section .",
    "the details of this procedure are given in @xcite .",
    "this section reviews details about the cdf and d  experiments that are relevant to the dpe dijet process . in particular , we state the cuts we will use to represent the cdf and d  dpe dijet experiments - collisions at @xmath74 @xcite . however their reported results are insufficient to include in our analysis . ] .",
    "also , cuts are given that are representative cases for dpe dijets at lhc .",
    "cdf has presented results on double diffractive dijet production @xcite at @xmath75 with transverse jet energies @xmath76 .",
    "the experiment has one roman pot on the @xmath32 rapidity side , which detects the diffractive hadron , here @xmath77 , going in this direction with the cuts @xmath78 . on the + rapidity side",
    ", there is no roman pot , only a rapidity gap requirement .",
    "thus , in principle , there is no specified cuts on the outgoing diffractive hadron , here @xmath79 , that goes in the + rapidity side .",
    "however , based on the rapidity gap length on this side , they obtain the estimate @xmath80 .",
    "the experiment places no explicit cuts on the dijet rapidity region . in our calculations , as our cuts , we will use the entire central detector region @xmath81 .",
    "the cdf double diffractive dijet experiment has three shortcomings in its interpretation as the dpe dijet process .",
    "first , the lack of a roman pot on the + rapidity side to detect the proton is a primary source of ambiguity in differentiating rapidity gap events that involve diffractive excitation of the proton versus pomeron exchange .",
    "second , a heuristic guide for pomeron exchange is that in the diffractive event @xmath82 . above this limit",
    "other regge exchanges may be important or the interpretation as a diffractive process altogether may be questioned . based on this guide ,",
    "the cdf roman pot cuts on the diffractive antiproton , @xmath83 , exceed the optimal region for interpretation as pomeron exchange .",
    "third , cdf does not implement on - line jet triggering .",
    "instead , they collect a sample of events that have a @xmath77 track in the roman pot and a rapidity gap in the + rapidity , @xmath79 , side . from these events , they separate those cases in which there are two jets in the central region with @xmath84 and discard the remaining data . since generally jets are difficult objects to create and the central region typically is soft , most of the collected data is discarded .",
    "furthermore , @xmath85 is a relatively low transverse jet momentum requirement for tevatron jets and at this level jets are fairly cloudy objects that may be difficult to reconstruct and measure precisely .",
    "d  has been examining double diffractive dijet production at two center - of - mass energies @xmath74 and @xmath86 @xcite .",
    "hereafter these two cases will be referred to respectively as d630 and d1800 . at present",
    ", the d  experiment has no roman pots , so that dpe dijet production operationally is defined as two hard jets in the final state which are separated from both sides of the beamline by large rapidity gaps .",
    "the dijet cuts are @xmath87 for d630 and @xmath88 for d1800 with @xmath89 for both center - of - mass energies .",
    "the d  approach has both an advantage and a disadvantage to the cdf approach .",
    "the advantage is d  implements on - line jet triggering .",
    "thus , they are able to make a more efficient usage of their collected data sample . in addition 12 and 15 gev jets",
    "are much better defined for identification by cone algorithms .",
    "the disadvantage of the d  approach is without roman pots the same ambiguities experienced by cdf arise here and are magnified .",
    "in particular uncertainty remains about what portion of the double gap events are double diffractive , single diffractive / single pomeron exchange or double pomeron exchange .",
    "moreover the momentum fractions lost by the proton and antiproton are not directly measured , so that in principle the experiment places no restriction on them .",
    "an upper bound on the momentum fraction lost by the @xmath79 and @xmath77 can be estimated by examining the maximum energy deposition in the hard event . from this , it can be inferred @xcite that @xmath90 . this bound is consistent with the heuristic notion that a pomeron can carry no more than @xmath91 of the diffractive hadron s momentum .",
    "for the d  cuts used in our calculations , we will use the upper bound @xmath92 .",
    "the jet @xmath0 requirements imply a minimum energy must be deposited in the hard interaction region , which places a lower bound bound @xmath93 given by @xmath94 for convenience , to accommodate both center - of - mass energy cases , we set @xmath95 , since this limit is lower than the values given by eq .",

    "this arises because the normalization constant is fixed for elastic scattering process , where @xmath366 is small since @xmath367 , the transverse momentum of the outgoing hadrons , is @xmath368 gev .",

    "the exclusive double diffractive dijet model is the same as our n(l)dpe model here , except for the inclusion of gluon densities in their model .",

    "were termed double pomeron exchange . some of the differences between the two processes have been elucidated here , which will help in interpreting experiment .",
    "the f(is)dpe model appears best to represent the present experimental data .",
    "however , inconsistencies still remain that need to be sorted - out by both theory and experiment before final conclusions can be made .",
    "although the n(l)dpe process does not appear to dominate the cross section , a subdominant component of it can not be excluded with present information .",
    "the cleanliness of the final state in this process , two outgoing hadrons plus a hard event , suffices justification to search for it . for new particle search experiments , this process could permit the ultimate measurement , although its diminutive cross section precludes it from being the ideal measurement .",
    "thus as should be the case with any good tale , the hard double pomeron exchange story is filled with uncertainties and conflicts .",
    "furthermore , the hope vested in the n(l)dpe process someday may vindicate a familiar moral , that the best things do nt come easy .",
