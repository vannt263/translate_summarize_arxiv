    "low - dimensional spin systems are one of the actively studied subjects in solid state physics due to the possibility to observe numerous quantum phenomena and to interpret these phenomena within relatively simple models ( e.g. , ising or heisenberg models for different lattice types ) .",
    "an interesting phenomenon in the spin physics is the formation of a spin liquid  a strongly correlated ground state lacking long - range magnetic order .",
    "this ground state is usually related to the electronic mechanism of superconductivity suggested for high-@xmath8 cuprates.@xcite spin liquids originate from quantum fluctuations that are particularly strong in systems with reduced dimensionality and low spin value .",
    "the fluctuations can be further enhanced by introducing magnetic frustration which impedes long - range ordering of the system .",
    "the spin-1/2 frustrated square lattice ( fsl ) is one of the simplest models giving rise to a spin liquid ground state . in this model",
    "( also known as the @xmath9 model ) , magnetic moments on a square - lattice are subjected to nearest - neighbor interaction @xmath2 along the side of the square and next - nearest - neighbor interaction @xmath3 along the diagonal of the square .",
    "the fsl model is described by the frustration ratio @xmath10 or , alternatively , by the frustration angle @xmath11@xmath12@xmath13 .",
    "defining the thermodynamic energy scale of exchange couplings as @xmath14 , one obtains @xmath15 and @xmath16 ( see fig .",
    "[ diagram1 ] and ref .  ) .",
    "( color online ) phase diagram of the fsl model.@xcite solid filling indicates the regions of long - range magnetic ordering , while hatched filling denotes the critical regions .",
    "positions of bacdvo(po@xmath17 and some of the previously investigated compounds are shown ( see text for references ) . ]",
    "extensive theoretical research on the fsl model has been done in the past .",
    "initially , the studies were focused on the afm region ( @xmath18),chandra1988,bacci1991,sushkov2001,siurakshina2001 while the general case ( arbitrary signs for @xmath2 and @xmath3 ) was only considered quite recently.@xcite the phase diagram of the model ( fig .",

    "classically , first - order phase transitions should occur at the naf ",
    "caf ( @xmath23 ) and the caf  fm ( @xmath24 ) boundaries . however , quantum fluctuations destroy long - range ordering , leading to the formation of critical regions with disordered ground states . in general",

    "despite numerous theoretical investigations , experimental realizations of the @xmath9 model are scarce .",
    "layered vanadium oxides li@xmath29voxo@xmath30 ( x = si , ge ) and vomoo@xmath31 were the first examples of the fsl systems .",
    "initially , these materials were ascribed to @xmath32 region of the phase diagram , and frustration - driven structural distortions were conjectured on the basis of nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) data.@xcite however , later studies revealed the lack of the structural distortions and established a different scenario for all three systems .",

    "thus , little experimental information about the critical regions of the fsl model is available , and the search for new fsl systems is still challenging .",
    "complex vanadium phosphates aavo(po@xmath0 have layered crystal structures ( fig .  [ structure1 ] ) with square lattice - like arrangement of v@xmath41 ( @xmath1 ) cations .",

    "metal cations and additional , isolated po@xmath30 tetrahedra are located between the layers .",
    "the layers are flexible towards buckling , therefore metal - oxygen distances can be tuned , and different metal cations can be accommodated within the structure .",

    "the crystal structures of aavo(po@xmath0 do not have tetragonal symmetry ; therefore , vanadium atoms do not form a regular square lattice . at first glance",
    ", the distortion of the square lattice is negligible .",
    "however , even a very slight alteration of the structure can lead to drastic changes in the exchange couplings as shown recently for ag@xmath33vop@xmath33o@xmath46 ( ref .  ) . in case of the aavo(po@xmath0 compounds",
    ", we studied this issue in detail using band structure calculations and found considerable deviations from the square lattice model for some of the systems.@xcite nevertheless , the deviation is really negligible for one of the compounds  bacdvo(po@xmath17 .",
    "below , we present magnetic properties of this compound and interpret the results within the fsl model . a detailed examination of the appropriate spin models for other aavo(po@xmath0 compounds",

    "the samples contained bacd(vo)(po@xmath0 and minor amount of unreacted bacdp@xmath29o@xmath37 .",
    "one then expects an equal amount of unreacted vo@xmath29 to be present in the samples .",
    "however , a minor impurity of vo@xmath29 can not be resolved by xrd due to the overlap of the strongest reflection of vo@xmath29 with that of bacdvo(po@xmath0 . instead",
    ", a minor amount of the vo@xmath29 impurity is evidenced by a small kink in the magnetic susceptibility data at @xmath56 k ( see sec .  [ results ] ) .",
    "we tried to improve the quality of the samples by varying temperature and duration of the annealing .",
    "unfortunately , bacdvo(po@xmath0 is rather unstable , and the formation of an unknown impurity phase was observed after long annealings at 800 @xmath57c or any annealings above 800 @xmath57c .",
    "the annealing at 900 @xmath57c resulted in melting and complete decomposition ( as seen by powder xrd ) of the compound towards unknown phases.@xcite regarding these difficulties , we did not attempt to grow single crystals of bacdvo(po@xmath17 , because the data measured on polycrystalline samples are sufficient to determine the parameters of the fsl model and the location of the system within the phase diagram .",

    "a slight change of slope observed at @xmath68 k is associated with magnetic ordering , while the curie - like upturn in low fields below 1 k is likely caused by extrinsic paramagnetic impurities .",

    "such a trend was already observed in the previously studied fsl systems , where @xmath180 and @xmath181 are decreased from @xmath182 and @xmath183 in li@xmath33vosio@xmath30 ( far away from any critical region ) towards @xmath184 and @xmath185 in pb@xmath29vo(po@xmath30)@xmath29 and finally to @xmath185 and @xmath186 in srznvo(po@xmath30)@xmath29 ( closer to the critical region).@xcite    in bacdvo(po@xmath30)@xmath29 , @xmath180 reaches only @xmath187 , well below the value found in the other fsl systems , while @xmath188 . the very small value of @xmath176 can not be attributed to a scaling problem due to a large amount of a foreign phase , since the magnetic entropy at high temperatures is close to @xmath189 ( the phonon contribution at @xmath175 amounts to less than @xmath156% of the total specific heat and can therefore safely be neglected ) .",
    "further on , a comparison of @xmath132 near its maximum for different fsl systems using a reduced @xmath190 temperature scale indicates that the maximum in @xmath132 of bacdvo(po@xmath30)@xmath29 is broader , and the decrease of @xmath132 above @xmath175 is much weaker than in the other known fsl systems .",
    "thus , this broad maximum with a small @xmath122 value at the maximum is also a direct experimental evidence for the strong frustration .",
    "a further ( and new ) manifestation of the frustration is likely observed in our magnetization curve ( fig .",
    "[ mvsh1 ] ) . above @xmath151 t",
    ", the slope of @xmath110 increases with magnetic field and steeps up just before saturation is reached .",
    "such a behavior has been recently predicted by theoretical calculations for the fsl.@xcite this steeping up just below @xmath191 is suggested to be more pronounced for systems that are close to the critical regions .",
    "however , further magnetization measurements on other fsl systems are needed to confirm this trend .    using exact diagonalization of finite - size clusters , shannon _ _",
    "et al.__@xcite calculated the dependence of a number of characteristic properties of the fsl ( such as @xmath192 , @xmath175 , @xmath193 , and @xmath176 ) as a function of @xmath194 .",
    "comparison of these predictions with the experimental observation for bacdvo(po@xmath30)@xmath29 and the related compounds indicates that while the overall @xmath194 dependence seems to be reproduced , the calculated absolute values are slightly too large .",
    "this difference is likely a consequence of the finite cluster size that leads to a gapped energy excitation spectra and thus an exponential vanishing of @xmath132 and @xmath157 at very low @xmath62 in contrast to the real behavior .",
    "the missing entropy has then to be recovered at higher temperatures , thus enhancing @xmath132 at its maximum and shifting the maximum to higher @xmath62 .    a last comment on the antiferromagnetic order observed at @xmath195  k. the anomalies in @xmath157 and @xmath59 are much smaller than those expected for a classical three - dimensional magnetic system but very similar to those observed in the other fsl systems , e.g. , li@xmath29vosio@xmath30 ( refs .   and ) or pb@xmath29vo(po@xmath30)@xmath29 ( refs .   and ) .",
    "since in some of these systems long - range magnetic order was directly confirmed by nmr or neutron scattering experiments,@xcite the similarity in the behavior allows us to safely claim that these small anomalies in @xmath73 and @xmath196 correspond to the onset of ( columnar ) antiferromagnetic order in bacdvo(po@xmath30)@xmath29 too .",
    "the ratio @xmath197 is smaller in bacdvo(po@xmath30)@xmath29 ( @xmath198 ) than in the other fsl systems ( @xmath199 ) , reflecting either the weakness of interlayer exchange and/or the suppression of the afm order by quantum fluctuations .    in conclusion ,",
    "our study of bacdvo(po@xmath0 shows that the magnetic properties of this compound are well understood within the fsl model . magnetic susceptibility , magnetization , and",
    "specific heat data consistently suggest @xmath4 k , @xmath5 k , hence @xmath200 , locating the compound into the caf region of the fsl phase diagram .",
    "bacdvo(po@xmath0 lies closer to the critical region of the fsl than any of the previously reported compounds .",
    "this conclusion is supported by a strongly reduced maximum of the magnetic specific heat and a positive curvature of the magnetization curve consistent with the recent theoretical predictions .",
