    "schrdinger - cat states  @xcite are most important in the domain of fundamental quantum mechanics , since the study of their progressive decoherence  @xcite would provide a better understanding of the transition from the _ quantum _ to the _ classical _ world  @xcite .",
    "however , due to their extreme sensitivity to the decoherence caused by the interaction with the environment , such linear superpositions of macroscopically distinguishable states are difficult to produce and to observe  @xcite . in the last few years , a major effort in this field has led to the experimental production and detection of _ mesoscopic _ superpositions of distinct states , both in the context of the single - mode microwave cavities  @xcite and of the dynamics of the center of mass motion of a trapped ion  @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "entanglement has been widely recognized as one of the essential and most puzzling features of quantum mechanics  @xcite , in that it allows the existence of _ quantum correlated _ states of two noninteracting subsystems : entangled states play a crucial role in the so called einstein , podolsky and rosen ( epr ) paradox  @xcite , and are essential in the rapidly growing field of quantum information , as they allow the feasibility of quantum state teleportation  @xcite , quantum cryptography  @xcite , and quantum computation  @xcite .    in two recent papers  @xcite ,",
    "one of us has proposed an original scheme for the generation of a new kind of _ amplified _ schrdinger - cat type states .",
    "it is based on the new concept of _ quantum injection _ into an optical parametric amplifier ( opa ) operating in _ entangled _ configuration .    as a relevant variant and a natural extension of the above scheme , in the present work we analyze the case of the quantum injection in an optical parametric oscillator ( opo ) in which two optical cavities are added to the opa scheme considered in ref .",
    "@xcite : refer to fig .",
    "[ fg : scheme ] .",
    "since the presence of the cavities leads to a large enhancement of the nonlinear ( nl ) parametric interaction , the number of the photon couples which are expected to be generated , in practical conditions , by the opo scheme is far larger than in the amplifier condition : in addition , the generation of parametrically coupled quasi - coherent fields represents in this context an appealing perspective .    the schrdinger - cat state that has been put forward in ref .",
    "@xcite and is being analyzed , in a more detailed fashion , in the present paper , is a superposition of two macroscopic states which are distinguished by their polarization .",
    "it can be considered as a sort of amplified version of the polarization - entangled states which have been widely used in the last few years for the demonstration of the violation of bell s inequality  @xcite , of teleportation  @xcite , and for the generation of greenberger - horne - zeilinger ( ghz ) states  @xcite .",
    "the present paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ spdc ] we briefly describe the process of type - ii parametric down conversion , with an emphasis on the kind of entangled states usually produced in these experiments , and on the state we want to generate . in sec .",

    "[ genera ] .",
    "[ detect ] is devoted to the presentation of the three methods we propose for detecting the schrdinger - cat state : photodetection ( sec .",
    "[ photo ] ) , measurement of the second - order quantum coherence ( sec .  [ corr ] ) , and wigner function reconstruction ( sec .",
    "[ wigner ] ) .",
    "we finally summarize and discuss our results in sec .",
    "[ conclu ] .",
    "the appendix is devoted to the development of the small interaction time approximation .    2",
    "let us first describe the kind of states commonly generated in the experiments aimed at the violation of the bell s inequalities . in these experiments",
    "the nl crystal ( typically beta - barium - borate : bbo ) is cut for type ii phase matching where the two down - converted photons are emitted into two cones , one `` ordinary '' polarized ( @xmath2 ) , the other `` extraordinary '' polarized ( @xmath3 ) . when the angle between the pump direction and the nonlinear crystal optical axis is sufficiently large  @xcite , the two cones mutually intersect along two lines , lying on opposite sides of the pump beam direction .",
    "these ones identify the output modes of the parametric down conversion : @xmath4 ( @xmath5 , @xmath6 ) .",
    "therefore the field belonging to the modes @xmath4 can be simultaneously @xmath3- and @xmath2-polarized .",
    "in typical conditions , the output state of the emitted photon couple may be expressed by  @xcite @xmath7 since we have , for each couple , four degrees of freedom involved , i.e. 2 states of orthogonal linear polarization @xmath3 , @xmath2 for each mode @xmath4 , we can rewrite state ( [ eq : pola ] ) in the more precise form @xmath8 which will be used in the following .",
    "the `` schrdinger - cat state '' we want to generate is a sort of amplification of this state , that is , it may be expressed in the form @xmath9 where @xmath10 is a state with a large number of photons in some sense , and the states @xmath11 are to be interpreted here as squeezed vacuum states .",
    "this kind of state is different from the traditional schrdinger cat states discussed in the quantum optics literature @xcite , where one has a _ single _ mode of the electromagnetic field in a superposition of two macroscopic states with different phases of the field .",
    "the state ( [ eq : catpro ] ) is a _ nonlocal _ superposition in which a macroscopic optical field is `` localized '' simultaneously either in the @xmath3- or in the @xmath2-polarized mode . in other words",
    "it is a state more similar to nonlocal field states such as @xmath12 where the field can be simultaneously in one cavity or in another cavity and whose generation is discussed in @xcite .",
    "we shall present here an experimental scheme for the generation of a state which is actually a mixed state , but nonetheless , has the same structure of the state of eq .",
    "( [ eq : catpro ] ) , that is , can be represented by the density operator @xmath13 where @xmath14 is a two - mode mixed state with a large number of photons , @xmath15 is a two - mode mixed state with a small number of photons and @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the interference terms .",
    "we shall consider an experimental arrangement , fig .",
    "[ fg : scheme ] , based on the one proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite and similar to that adopted in refs .",
    "@xcite to show the realization of inducing coherence , without induced emission .",
    "two down - conversion nl crystals , are arranged in such a way that the two corresponding idlers beams are aligned along a common direction @xmath18 . moreover ,",
    "both idler beams and the signal beam of one nl crystal ( with wave - vector @xmath19 ) are placed within couples of mirrors .",
    "this scheme can be thought of to realize the coupling of two nondegenerate opos .",
    "the signal beam of the other crystal , emitted along the direction @xmath20 triggers the photodetector @xmath21 .",
    "the directions @xmath20 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 are selected to realize for both nl crystals the type - ii phase matching described before .",
    "these beams are then associated with six modes , with annihilation operator @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "note that the first two annihilation operators refer to traveling - waves , while the last four refer to cavity modes .",
    "the dynamics of the system is determined by the nonlinear parametric interaction at each crystal and by the damping terms associated with losses and dissipation inside the cavities  @xcite , as we shall see in the next section .",
    "the partial hamiltonian operators describing the unitary dynamics inside the crystals are given by  @xcite    [ eq : hnl ] @xmath28    where @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 is the second - order nonlinear susceptibility of the crystals , and @xmath32 ( @xmath33 ) is the pump intensity in crystals 1 and 2 , respectively , which is assumed to be `` classical '' .    due to the explicit presence of dissipation in this problem",
    ", one has to write the master equation for the reduced density matrix of the combined system which arises from the hamiltonian terms ( [ eq : hnl1 ] ) and ( [ eq : hnl2 ] ) and from the damping terms @xmath34 for @xmath35 .",
    "since the damping constants @xmath36 are essentially connected to the transmittivity of the mirrors , it is quite natural to assume @xmath37 and @xmath38 .    upon writing the full master equation for the total density matrix @xmath39 of the ( six - mode ) system",
    ", it appears clear that the dynamics of the six modes actually decouples into two independent dynamics for two groups of three modes .",

    ", we can simply restrict ourselves to the investigation of the three - mode problem described by the master equation ( [ eq : meq ] ) with ( [ eq : parmeq ] ) , and we shall drop the subscript @xmath3 and @xmath2 when not needed .",
    "the wigner function  @xcite @xmath51 , with @xmath52 @xmath53 , resulting from this density matrix @xmath54 will then be a function of six real variables ( or three complex variables ) .",
    "its time evolution , upon evaluating the commutator and the damping terms and after some lengthy algebra , is described by the six - dimensional fokker - planck equation @xmath55 where the vector @xmath56 , the matrix @xmath57 , and @xmath58    the solution to eq .",

    "the stability properties of the system are intimately connected to the threshold of the overall opo consisting of nl1 and nl2 .",
    "below threshold , the system is stable and reaches a stationary state , since all eigenvalues of @xmath64 have positive real parts . on the other hand , above threshold",
    "the system is unstable and its energy exponentially increases , because some eigenvalues of @xmath64 have negative real part .",
    "this result can be easily checked in the case in which the parametric oscillator associated with nl2 is decoupled from nl1 ( @xmath65 ) : in this case modes @xmath18 and @xmath19 decouple from mode @xmath20 , and we end up with a four - dimensional problem for the modes @xmath18 and @xmath19 , described by a fokker - planck equation of the same type as eq .",
    "( [ eq:6fp ] ) , but with @xmath66 and @xmath67 . in this case",
    "the ( doubly degenerate ) eigenvalues of @xmath64 are @xmath68 and the stability condition becomes @xmath69 which coincides with the customary threshold for the parametric oscillator  @xcite .",
    "however , if we turn on the first parametric amplifier ( @xmath70 ) then the problem turns from 4-dimensional to 6-dimensional , as we have seen : the eigenvalues of @xmath64 change and it is in principle possible to change the threshold , i.e. , the stability condition .",
    "as soon as @xmath70 , namely the first parametric amplifier is present , the system becomes unstable , independently on the values of @xmath71 , @xmath72 , and @xmath73 .",

    "the second pump is on ( @xmath81 ) and the second parametric oscillator is in its equilibrium state below threshold .",
    "we therefore have a factorized initial state @xmath82 where @xmath83 and @xmath84 is the equilibrium state of the oscillator below threshold .",

    "the initial state @xmath84 is then given by the density matrix corresponding to the wigner function @xmath87 where it is straightforward to realize that the modes 2 and 3 are correlated .",
    "moreover , it is not a pure state , because @xmath88^{2 } \\nonumber \\\\   & = & \\left(1-\\frac{\\chi_{2}^{2}}{k^{2}}\\right ) < 1 \\ ; , \\label{eq : trrhosq}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] as expected .",
    "the reduced density matrices of each mode are identical and coincide with the thermal state @xmath89 with an initial mean number of photons given by @xmath90 which means that when the oscillator is initially sufficiently close to threshold the initial mean number of photons in modes 2 and 3 within the cavities can be large .",
    "at time @xmath91 the first pump is turned on ( @xmath92 ) : also the first crystal begins to operate and the two groups of three modes start their joint evolution , according to @xmath93 where the two factorized evolutions are identical because both the operator @xmath94 and the initial condition are identical in the two cases . as a consequence , we end up with two identical six - dimensional problems .    the solution of eq .",

    "roughly speaking , one should recover the opa results from the opo ones in the limit @xmath120 , since this condition means absence of cavity mirrors .",
