    "<S> the reaction matrix of a cavity with attached waveguides connects scattering properties to properties of a corresponding closed billiard for which the waveguides are cut off by straight walls . on the one hand </S>",
    "<S> this matrix is directly related to the s - matrix , on the other hand it can be expressed by a spectral sum over all eigenfunctions of the closed system . however , in the physically relevant situation where these eigenfunctions vanish on the impenetrable boundaries of the closed billiard , the spectral sum for the reaction matrix , as it was used before , fails to converge and does not reliably reproduce the scattering properties . </S>",
    "<S> we derive here a convergent representation of the reaction matrix in terms of eigenmodes satisfying dirichlet boundary conditions and demonstrate its validity in the rectangular and the sinai billiards .    </S>",
    "<S> @xmath0 ) @xmath1 ] ii    recently , there has been some interest in the application of the reaction - matrix theory of wigner and eisenbud @xcite and the projection - operator formalism of feshbach @xcite , originally developed for the description of nuclear collisions , to chaotic cavities with attached scattering channels @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> such models are frequently used as paradigms of chaotic scattering @xcite and found important experimental realizations by electron transport through open quantum dots @xcite , lasing optical micro - cavities @xcite and scattering of microwaves in resonators with attached waveguides @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it is known that the quantum scattering in the open system shows signatures of the classical dynamics in the closed system . </S>",
    "<S> for example , conductance fluctuations of open quantum dots are different for systems whose closed counterparts have integrable , fully chaotic or mixed phase space @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in fact many statistical results for quantum chaotic scattering rely on this connection as for their derivation an ad - hoc formulation of the scattering problem in terms of an effective non - hermitian hamiltonian is used @xcite , which describes the dynamics inside a closed system and an additional coupling of the corresponding eigenstates to some scattering channels . </S>",
    "<S> classical chaos enters via the random - matrix assumption for the hermitian part of this hamiltonian @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , while the effective hamiltonian appears naturally within the formalism from nuclear physics , it is not a priori clear when this formalism applies to some given billiard system and how the parameters of the two different models are related .    </S>",
    "<S> therefore it is important and interesting to develop a thorough understanding of the connection between the scattering properties of billiards , in particular the s - matrix , and the properties of the corresponding closed system , i.  e.  spectrum and eigenfunctions . </S>",
    "<S> for example , today it is well known that the spectrum can be found from a secular equation involving the s - matrix @xcite </S>",
    "<S> . for scattering from the outside of convex billiards in @xmath2 this scattering approach to quantization allows even for a mathematically rigorous formulation @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> unfortunately , the opposite direction is less profoundly understood . here </S>",
    "<S> , the unitary s - matrix is related to a hermitian reaction matrix , and this can in turn be expressed as a sum over the internal spectrum with coefficients reflecting the behavior of the internal wavefunction at the boundary separating billiard and waveguide . from the physical point of view , and in particular for the aforementioned applications @xcite , the most natural situation is a wavefunction which vanishes outside the billiard and on the boundary ( dirichlet b.  c. ) : electrons in a quantum dot are depleted from the boundary by a high negative gate voltage , the radiation field is restricted to the optical cavity by total internal reflection or additional mirrors , and in microwave resonators the metallic walls do not admit the electrical field . however , for this of all choices of boundary conditions no consistent representation of the reaction matrix as a spectral sum is known . </S>",
    "<S> we derived a formal expression @xcite but found both numerically and from semiclassical estimates that it fails to converge . </S>",
    "<S> recently , this conclusion was confirmed with different methods @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> it is certainly possible to circumvent this problem : one option is to ignore the divergence and to restrict the spectral sum by hand to some set of levels . </S>",
    "<S> naturally this must fail in a generic situation , but it can give reasonable results in some special cases , e.  g.  when the spectrum has a doublet or band structure @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a second option relies on the fact that in principle all boundary conditions providing a self - adjoint hamiltonian are admissible for defining the closed system , see @xcite for a nice explanation of this point . in particular neumann b.  c.  with finite wave function but zero derivative at the interface were considered previously @xcite . in this case </S>",
    "<S> the spectral sum converges , and the resulting reaction matrix successfully reproduces numerical or experimental scattering data </S>",
    "<S> . nevertheless it would be very unsatisfying , could the formulation of a proper reaction - matrix theory for billiards not be based on the physically relevant boundary conditions .    </S>",
    "<S> to remedy this situation we establish in the present paper a convergent expansion of the reaction matrix for dirichlet billiards with attached waveguides . </S>",
    "<S> our main result is eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ w ] ) below , where the coupling constants entering this series are given . </S>",
    "<S> before we get to this equation , we recall some results from previous work . following eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ w ] ) we give a derivation of this formula , discuss some interesting aspects related to it and show with two examples how it works .    </S>",
    "<S> we consider the same `` frying - pan '' setup as in refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , i.  e.   a cavity with an attached waveguide as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ sketch ] . </S>",
    "<S> the wave function must vanish on the boundary of the system . </S>",
    "<S> to obtain the corresponding closed system , dirichlet boundary conditions are imposed also on the line @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> it is assumed that this point of separation is well inside the waveguide such that for @xmath4 the wavefunction can be expanded in transversal modes @xmath5 a condition on the minimum value of @xmath6 will be given later .    </S>",
    "<S> energy eigenfunctions in a billiard satisfy the helmholtz equation @xmath7 with @xmath8 and @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , the scattering states @xmath10 are in the channel region given in terms of the s - matrix as @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the longitudinal momentum . </S>",
    "<S> there is a finite number @xmath13 $ ] of open modes with real @xmath14 . </S>",
    "<S> all other modes are evanescent and give contributions to the scattering states which decay exponentially into the waveguide . </S>",
    "<S> it is known that their influence is negligible unless the energy nearly coincides with a threshold for the opening of a new channel @xcite . for simplicity we will disregard evanescent modes here . </S>",
    "<S> then the @xmath15 s - matrix is unitary , and therefore it is related to a hermitian _ reaction matrix </S>",
    "<S> _ @xmath16 by @xmath17 as billiards are invariant under time - reversal , @xmath18 and @xmath16 are symmetric matrices .    </S>",
    "<S> on the other hand we consider the eigenfunctions of the closed billiard which vanish at @xmath3 and can therefore be represented as @xmath19 the corresponding eigenvalue is @xmath20 , and @xmath21 follows in analogy to @xmath14 . again because of time - reversal symmetry the coefficients @xmath22 can be chosen real . </S>",
    "<S> these coefficients are obtained by projecting the normal derivative of the eigenfunction at the interface on the transversal modes @xmath23_{x=0}\\,.\\ ] ] it is our goal to represent at arbitrary wave number @xmath24 the reaction matrix @xmath16 ( and thus via eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ sk ] ) also the s - matrix ) in terms of the discrete set @xmath25 . </S>",
    "<S> for this purpose we consider the green s function for the closed billiard which is defined by @xmath26 , as this quantity can at the same time be represented in terms of the s - matrix and by a spectral sum . </S>",
    "<S> indeed we have @xcite @xmath27 with @xmath28 and @xmath29 the s - matrix of the scattering system is implicitly contained in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ gfdeco2 ] ) , both in the scattering states @xmath10 and in the matrix @xmath30 . </S>",
    "<S> we can extract this information from the normal derivative of green s function at the interface , projected to transversal modes . after inserting eqs .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ sstate ] ) and ( [ psind ] ) into eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ gfdeco2 ] ) we have @xmath31 using eqs .  ( [ g ] ) and ( [ sk ] ) </S>",
    "<S> we see that the r.h.s . reduces essentially to an element of the reaction matrix @xmath32 because of the symmetry of green s function with respect to its spatial arguments the result does not depend on the order of limits , </S>",
    "<S> just the singularity occurring for @xmath33 must be avoided . </S>",
    "<S> comparing eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ kd ] ) to the spectral decomposition of green s function eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ gfdeco ] ) one naively expects that the reaction matrix has a spectral representation in the form @xmath34 with coupling constants @xmath35 however , this is not the case , as it was found in refs .  @xcite that with eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ oldw ] ) the sum ( [ kw ] ) fails to converge . </S>",
    "<S> convergence is lost because the individual terms in the ( absolutely convergent ) series eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ gfdeco ] ) grow too much upon the differentiation required by eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ kd ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> we will show in the following that eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ kw ] ) is still valid , albeit with modified coupling constants @xmath36 keeping in mind that differentiation and summation do not commute in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ gfdeco ] ) , we need a different strategy which allows to make use of this series anyway : we will represent the second derivative of green s function in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ kd ] ) by the _ value _ of green s function at some shifted point in space . </S>",
    "<S> to implement this idea we return to eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ g2x ] ) and bring it by some formal manipulations into the shape of eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ gfdeco2 ] ) , projected onto the transversal modes . then we get a representation of the reaction matrix which is equivalent to eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ kd ] ) but does not require differentiation , namely @xmath37 now we can safely use the spectral decomposition of green s function eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ gfdeco ] ) together with eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ billefd ] ) to obtain @xmath38 this is indeed equivalent to eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ kw ] ) with the coupling constants given in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ w ] ) .    </S>",
    "<S> some comments are in order at this stage . </S>",
    "<S> the point @xmath39 in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ kg ] ) corresponds to the first maximum of the partial wave @xmath40 . </S>",
    "<S> although no differentiation was involved , the normal derivatives of the wave functions @xmath22 appear in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ kmat - result ] ) because they determine the amplitudes of the partial waves at these maxima according to eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ billefd ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> however , the full reaction matrix @xmath16 can be obtained by the outlined procedure only , if the points @xmath41 are inside the waveguide for all @xmath42 . </S>",
    "<S> otherwise eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ kg ] ) breaks down . </S>",
    "<S> this implies a restriction which is at its strongest for the minimum of @xmath14 at @xmath43 . </S>",
    "<S> we can represent the wave number as @xmath44 with @xmath45 and find @xmath46 . </S>",
    "<S> hence , our expression for the reaction matrix will be valid provided that @xmath47 this condition will always be violated at the threshold energies for the opening of new scattering channels where @xmath48 . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> if we avoid these singular points by fixing @xmath49 to some positive value , the condition will always be satisfied in the semiclassical limit @xmath50 . </S>",
    "<S> in some sense these restrictions on the validity of our approach are similar to those allowing to neglect evanescent modes @xcite . from eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ condition ] ) we conclude that the situation which is most favourable for reaction - matrix theory in dirichlet billiards is a closed billiard which extends very far into the waveguide @xmath51 . </S>",
    "<S> intuitively this should be clear , because then the shape of the billiard resembles a scattering system .    </S>",
    "<S> a second comment concerns the uniqueness of the suggested procedure . according to eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ gfdeco2 ] ) , and because of the special geometry we consider , any point @xmath52 inside the waveguide region can be used to extract information about the s - matrix , while we have selected only those points where some partial wave @xmath40 has maximum amplitude . </S>",
    "<S> this may appear like an arbitrary choice . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , if we sample green s function at sufficiently many points , arbitrarily placed inside the waveguide , it is in principle possible to compute the s - matrix or the reaction matrix . </S>",
    "<S> however , the resulting expression will not have the canonical form of eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ kw ] ) and no coupling constants for individual levels can be defined in this case . </S>",
    "<S> therefore the connection to the formalism of refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite would be lost within such an approach and consequently it would not be very useful . </S>",
    "<S> in other words , the main accomplishment of our theory is not the mere possibility to compute the s - matrix from data obtained in the closed billiard , rather it is the fact that the resulting expression is still of the form of eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ kw ] ) .    </S>",
    "<S> further we note that the coupling constants in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ w ] ) reduce to the naively anticipated eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ oldw ] ) for states @xmath53 which are close to the energy shell of scattering , i.  e.  @xmath54 for @xmath55 . </S>",
    "<S> this explains why eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ oldw ] ) works ( up to some degree of accuracy ) for a cluster of almost degenerate states @xcite , and why it also provides a consistent answer for the mean coupling strength in the semiclassical regime @xcite : the approximation @xmath55 was always made from the outset . in general </S>",
    "<S> this approximation is not justified and eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ oldw ] ) breaks down .    the crucial difference between eqs .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ oldw ] ) and ( [ w ] ) is their behavior for @xmath56 which decides the issue of convergence . to discuss this question we need the semiclassical estimate for the average behavior of the boundary functions @xmath57 which we derived in eqs . </S>",
    "<S> ( 34 ) , ( 38 ) of ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite for chaotic billiards ( see @xcite for more general and accurate estimates of this type ) . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath58 denotes here the area of the billiard . </S>",
    "<S> substitution into eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ w ] ) leads to @xmath59 i.  e.  eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ kw ] ) is indeed absolutely convergent .    </S>",
    "<S> we find it illuminating to apply presented theory to a simple toy model , where all relevant quantities are known in closed form . </S>",
    "<S> consider a rectangular billiard with side lengths @xmath6 and @xmath60 which yields a half - infinite empty waveguide of width @xmath60 if one of the walls is removed . </S>",
    "<S> this is an integrable system since the transversal modes of the waveguide are decoupled . </S>",
    "<S> therefore we can restrict attention to some particular mode @xmath40 . </S>",
    "<S> the corresponding diagonal element of the s - matrix is found to be @xmath61 this is to be reproduced by the spectral sum eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ kw ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> the normalized eigenfunctions of the closed billiard are @xmath62 and therefore we have the longitudinal momentum @xmath63 , the boundary function @xmath64 and the coupling constants @xmath65 substitution into eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ kw ] ) yields after some straightforward transformations @xmath66 according to the two terms in the numerator we split this expression into two series which can separately be evaluated with the help of eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( 1.445.6 ) from ref .  @xcite . upon recombination of the two results we have @xmath67 which is precisely the reaction matrix corresponding to the s - matrix eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ srb ] ) via eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ sk ] ) .    </S>",
    "<S> now we test the outcome of eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ kw ] ) in the sinai billiard . </S>",
    "<S> s - matrix and eigenstates were computed with the methods described in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . for fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ sinai ] we have chosen a large number of open modes , @xmath68 , and a geometry which does not allow for narrow resonances . </S>",
    "<S> this is a very demanding regime , as a high number of states is expected to contribute . nevertheless , in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ sinai]a we show that a reasonable agreement can already be obtained from the 1,000 lowest internal modes . </S>",
    "<S> the agreement improves as we increase the number of states ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ sinai]b ) . for @xmath69 , </S>",
    "<S> corresponding to 15,575 modes , hardly any deviation is visible on the scale of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ sinai]a ( not shown ) . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , from eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ oldw ] ) we get garbage irrespective of @xmath70 ( also not shown ) . </S>",
    "<S> note that the error in an individual eigenphase @xmath71 of the s - matrix is at its largest when @xmath72 . </S>",
    "<S> these are the eigenvalues for a billiard with identical geometry but neumann b.  c.  at @xmath3 , while at @xmath73 the dirichlet billiard is quantized and we get perfect agreement . </S>",
    "<S> had we chosen neumann b.  c.  as starting point for the evaluation of the reaction matrix , the result would show relatively large deviations close to @xmath73 . in this sense </S>",
    "<S> the different boundary conditions are complementary . </S>",
    "<S> finally we remark that from eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ condition ] ) we can not expect agreement in the interval @xmath74 in fig .  [ sinai]a . </S>",
    "<S> indeed we observe in this region a few points which are very far off the exact result .    </S>",
