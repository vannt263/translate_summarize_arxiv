    "@xcite in fig .",
    "4b , we have plotted temperature dependence of second order ( @xmath32 ) ac-@xmath28 measured in ac field 3 oe and frequency 731 hz . usually , @xmath32 appears due to the presence of symmetry breaking field which originates either from the spontaneous magnetization or the superimposed dc magnetic field .",

    "this consistency of particle size calculated from various methods proves the unambiguity in present analysis .      after having confirmed the spm nature of these nanoparticles ,",
    "we attempt to establish the existence of interparticle interaction . as a first step",

    "it is also evident in the figure that with increasing particle size nonlinearity of plot is reduced , thus probably indicate that the strength of interaction reduces with the increasing particle size",
    ".    now we attempt to reestablish the presence of interaction among the particles from the frequency ( @xmath55 ) dependent shift in @xmath5 in ac-@xmath28(@xmath2 ) measurements .",
    "it can be mentioned that the variation of @xmath55 in ac-@xmath28 renders the variation in probe time @xmath56 ( @xmath57 @xmath58 ) which allows to probe the relaxation of particles in different time windows .",

    "@xcite it is fact that the significant presence of interparticle interaction induces the collective behavior and glassy dynamics even in the tailor made spm system .",
    "since the response of such systems is similar to sg , they are termed as super spin glass ( ssg).@xcite basically , ssg dynamics differ from the spm one in terms of critical slowing down of relaxation time .",
    "similar critically slow dynamics resembling sg like response is also shown by magnetic clusters forming in a matrix out of composition fluctuation or atomic segregation which is called cluster glass ( cg).@xcite however , it remains an experimentally challenging task to discern between critically slow dynamics of ssg and cg with the slow but non - critical dynamics of spm system .",

    "11 where we show that variation of @xmath5 with field follows at line in low field for all the samples .",
    "however , with the increase in field we find the deviation from at line as marked by vertical arrows in the figure .",
    "remarkably , in high field we find the variation of @xmath5(h ) agrees with the gt line .",
    "we have observed the similar behavior for all the samples and in inset of fig .",
    "11 we have plotted such high field behavior for n600 sample .",
    "the fields ( @xmath100 ) where we find crossover from at to gt behavior are approximately 250 , 200 and 100 oe for n600 , n650 and n700 sample , respectively .",
    "it is rather significant that the crossover fields from at to gt like behavior are close to the dipolar interaction fields found from the remnant magnetization measurements mentioned above ( fig .",
    "this crossover in critical lines around the dipolar interaction field for these nanoparticles is quite noteworthy .    the above experimental results in fig .",
    "11 has the similarity with the theoretical calculation by kotliar and sompolinsky@xcite who predicted that in presence of unidirectional random anisotropy ( i.e. , dzyaloshinsky - moriya type interaction ) the critical behavior for sg in fields lower than the anisotropy is close to ising - like following at line , and crosses over to heisenberg behavior in high fields .",
    "in fact , similar anisotropy induced crossover in critical lines is experimentally observed in au doped classical cumn sg system as well as in superconducting vortex - glass system.@xcite these results allow us to draw an analogy with the present psmo nanoparticles where the interparticle interaction acts as an unidirectional anisotropy leading to crossover from at to gt like behavior at field around the interaction field . indeed , dipolar interaction ( eq .",
    "11 ) is anisotropic which introduces angular dependence of spin ordering in system.@xcite    to confirm the unidirectional nature of the anisotropy arising out of interparticle interaction we have measured field cooled ( fc ) @xmath16 vs @xmath6 loop for all the nanoparticles . in presence of unidirectional anisotropy ,",
    "fc hysteresis loop is shifted along the field axis , generally , in opposite direction to the cooling field .",
    "this loop shift is commonly known as ` exchange bias ( eb ) ' which is characterized by field , @xmath101.@xcite the samples under study have been cooled in + 10 koe from room temperature to 10 k , and after proper thermal stabilization hysteresis loops have been recorded ( fig .",
    "we have ensured that the artifacts due to minor hysteresis loop are eliminated .",
    "it is evident in figure that collected @xmath16 vs @xmath6 loop is shifted toward the negative field axis .",
    "it is worth mentioning that we find similar opposite shift when samples are cooled in negative field .",
    "we calculate @xmath101 [ = - ( @xmath102 - @xmath103)/2 , where @xmath103 and @xmath102 are the point of intersection on the field axis at decreasing ( @xmath104 ) and increasing ( @xmath105 ) fields cycles ] as 155.3 , 132.4 and 105.7 oe at 10 k for n600 , n650 and n700 sample , respectively .",
    "conventionally , eb is believed to be directly associated with the interface of fm and af components .",
    "however , fm in contact with sg or ferrimagnets are also observed to give rise eb properties.@xcite for the present psmo nanoparticles , we believe that the observed eb is guided by the interparticle interaction rather than the fm / af interface mechanism .",
    "our conclusion is based on the following points : ( i ) fig .",
    "3 conclusively shows the fm nature of low-@xmath2 magnetic state for all the nanoparticles . ( ii )",
    "even if , eb arises due to the presence of residual af components then @xmath101 would vanish above the fm - af phase transition temperature @xmath106 .",
    "we find finite @xmath101 at or above 150 k whereas @xmath106 during cooling in same field occurs around 84 k for bulk psmo.@xcite ( iii ) the residual af components are supposed to increase with the increasing particle size as the decrease in particle size does not favor af ordering,@xcite therefore it will result in more fm / af interfaces .",
    "but , our estimated @xmath101 decreases with increasing particle size .",
    "( iv ) the variation of @xmath101 follows the similar trend of interparticle interaction , i.e. , decreases with increasing particle size .",
    "these results straightforwardly imply that eb in these psmo nanoparticles originate due to the mechanism guided by the interparticle interaction .",
    "furthermore , these confirm the unidirectional - anisotropic nature of this interparticle interaction which leads to crossover in critical lines on the h - t plane .",
    "details of eb in these nanoparticles will be published elsewhere .",
    "nonetheless , this interparticle interaction induced crossover in critical lines with fields in these compounds is quite intriguing and requires further studies involving both experimental and theoretical endeavor to comprehend .",
    "in conclusion , we show that nanoparticles of pr@xmath0sr@xmath0mno@xmath3 of three different average sizes have fm ground state contrary to their bulk counterpart in spite of having same crystallographic symmetry .",
    "the low temperature fm - af transition which is a marked feature of bulk compound is significantly absent in nanoparticles .",
    "detailed linear as well as nonlinear ac susceptibilities coupled with dc magnetization confirm the spm nature of these nanoparticles .",
    "presence of interactions among these particles has been corroborated from the analysis of frequency dependent peak in ac susceptibility and temperature dependence of coercive field .",
    "the nature of this interaction is identified to be of dipolar type and the strength of the interaction is found to decreases with the increase in particle size .",
    "this interparticle interaction gives rise to some kind of glassiness in the magnetic response even in these spm system .",
    "the effect of this dipolar interaction on the magnetic properties is clearly evident as the systems exhibit crossover from at to gt like critical lines with increasing field above their respective interaction field , which is rather intriguing .",
    "following the theoretical prediction , we believe that this crossover phenomenon is induced by the presence of unidirectional anisotropy which arises from the interparticle interaction and the presence of exchange bias effect in these samples confirms it .",
