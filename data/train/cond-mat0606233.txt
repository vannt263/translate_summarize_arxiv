    "thus the particles with @xmath90 actually follow the path during time @xmath78 rather than @xmath76 . because all the particles which had flipped during the time @xmath87 can not return back to their previous state as that before heating , no memory effect",
    "is observed .",

    "a slow logarithmic relaxation begins which is due to the energy distribution of the particles .",
    "as the sample is further heated to @xmath97 , all the particles with @xmath98 respond to this temperature change .",

    "secondly , positive heating does not yield memory effect whereas temporary cooling does .",
    "so there is an asymmetric response with respect to negative / positive temperature cycling .",
    "this asymmetry is due to the fact that after temporary cooling only smaller nanoparticles are able to respond to the temperature or field change and relax to the new equilibrium state .",
    "the larger nanoparticles are frozen . upon returning to the initial temperature or field value ,",
    "the smaller particles rapidly respond to the change such that this new state is essentially the same as that before the temporary cooling , and the larger nanoparticles are now able to resume relaxing to the equilibrium state .",

    "in contrast , for positive heating , all the particles smaller as well as bigger are able to respond to the temperature or field change .",
    "therefore , after returning to the initial temperature , the bigger particles do not respond at all whereas the smaller particles take time to respond , thus leading to no memory effect in the positive heating cycle .",

    "<S> the slow dynamics and concomitant memory ( aging ) effects seen in nanomagnetic systems are analyzed on the basis of two separate paradigms : superparamagnets and spinglasses . </S>",
    "<S> it is argued that in a large class of aging phenomena it suffices to invoke superparamagnetic relaxation of individual single domain particles but with a distribution of their sizes . </S>",
    "<S> cases in which interactions and randomness are important in view of distinctive experimental signatures , are also discussed .    </S>",
    "<S> the subjects of both superparamagnetism and spinglasses are quite old and well studied @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> yet they have been rejuvenated in recent years in the context of fascinating memory and aging properties of nanomagnets . </S>",
    "<S> these properties , which are believed to be of great practical usages , have been recently investigated in a large number of experiments on magnetic nanoparticles @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the observed slow dynamical behavior has been variously interpreted , based on the paradigm of either superparamagnet or spinglass , sometimes even obscuring the difference between the two distinct physical phenomena . </S>",
    "<S> the purpose of this paper is to reexamine some of the data , others as well as our own , and critically assess the applicability of the physics of either superparamagnets or spinglasses and occasionally , even a juxtaposition of the two . </S>",
    "<S> our main point is , spinglasses are marked by complexity , arising out of two separate attributes  frustration and disorder . while the manifested properties , such as stretched exponential relaxation and concomitant aging effects , can also occur due to ` freezing ' of superparamagnetism , especially in a polydisperse sample , the physics of spinglasses is naturally much richer than that of superparamagnets . a discernible experimental signature of superparamagnetism versus spinglass behavior seems to be the magnitude of the field - cooled ( fc ) magnetization memory effect that is significantly larger for the interacting glassy systems than the one in non - interacting superparamagnetic particles @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , invoking spinglass physics in interpreting data on the slow dynamics of nanomagnets can sometimes be like ` killing a fly with a sledge hammer ' , especially if a simpler interpretation on the basis of superparamagnetism is available . </S>",
    "<S> we explore such situations in this paper . </S>",
    "<S> + superparamagnetism was discussed quite early by frenkel and dorfman and later by kittel , as a property arising out of single - domain behavior when a bulk ferromagnetic or an antiferromagnetic specimen is reduced to a size below about 50 nm @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> for such a small particle - size the domination of surface to bulk interactions yields a mono - domain particle inside which nearly @xmath0 magnetic moments are coherently locked together in a given direction , thus yielding a giant or a supermoment . </S>",
    "<S> clearly , for this to happen , the ambient temperature must be much less than the bulk ordering temperature , so that the integrity of the super moment is maintained . </S>",
    "<S> however , as neel pointed out , in the context of magnetic properties of rocks in geomagnetism , the direction of the supermoment is not fixed in time @xcite . indeed , </S>",
    "<S> because of thermal fluctuations , this direction can undergo rotational relaxations across an energy - barrier due to the anisotropy of the single - domain particle , governed by the neel relaxation time : -0.3 cm @xmath1 in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( 1 ) , the preexponential factor @xmath2 is of the order of @xmath3 sec , v is the volume of the particle , and k is the anisotropy energy , the origin of which lies in the details of all the microscopic interactions . for our purpose k would be treated as a parameter whose typical value is about @xmath4 joule/@xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , at room temperature , @xmath6 can be as small as @xmath4 sec for a particle of diameter 11.5 nm but can be astoundingly as large as @xmath7 sec for a particle of diameter just about 15 nm . </S>",
    "<S> thus , a slight polydispersity ( i.e. , a distribution in the volume v ) , can yield a plethora of time scales , giving rise to interesting slow dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , if @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is a typical measurement time in a given experiment , the supermoment would have undergone many rotations within the ` time - window ' of the experiment , thereby averaging out to zero the net magnetic moment . </S>",
    "<S> one then has superparamagnetism . on the other hand , if @xmath10 , the supermoment hardly has time to rotate within the time - window , thus yielding a ` frozen - moment ' behavior . </S>",
    "<S> the consequent nonequilibrium features have led to the phrase :  magnetic viscosity \" while depicting the time - dependent freezing of moments @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> further , the transition from superparamagnetism to frozen - moment behavior occurs at a temperature , referred to in the literature as the blocking temperature @xmath11 , defined by @xmath12 when the measurement temperature t is less than @xmath11 the magnetic particles are blocked whereas in the other extreme they display facile response to applied fields . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , we emphasize that even within a single particle picture , sans any form of inter - particle interactions , such as in a dilute nanomagnetic specimen , one can obtain apparently intriguing effects such as ` stretched exponential ' relaxation simply because of size distributions . </S>",
    "<S> the latter will be shown to be responsible for much of the data on slow relaxations in nanomagnets . + turning now to spinglasses , historically the phenomenon was first observed in dilute alloys such as @xmath13 ( or @xmath14 ) in which magnetic impurities fe ( or mn ) in very low concentrations were  quenched - in \" from a solid solution with a host metallic system of au ( or cu ) @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the localized spin is coupled with the s - electron of the host metal which itself interacts with the other conduction electrons via what is called the ruderman - kittel - kasuya - yoshida ( rkky ) hamiltonian , thereby setting up an indirect exchange interaction between the localized moments . because the coupling constant of the exchange interaction , in view of the rkky coupling , alternates in sign ( between ferro and antiferromagnetic bonds ) , the system is ` frustrated ' . </S>",
    "<S> thus the ground state is highly degenerate yielding a zero - temperature entropy . </S>",
    "<S> an additional effect is due to disorder . because the dilute magnetic moments are quenched - in at random sites , the exchange coupling - strengths are randomly distributed . </S>",
    "<S> the dual occurrence of frustration and disorder has led to novel concepts in the statistical mechanics of spinglasses such as configuration - averaging , replica - techniques ( for computing the free energy ) , broken - ergodicity , etc . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> experimentally , spinglasses are characterized by a ` cusp ' in the susceptibility and stretched exponential relaxation of time - dependent correlation functions @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it is no wonder then that spinglasses also exhibit slow dynamics with associated memory and aging effects , albeit the root causes are much more complex than a system of polydisperse , noninteracting single - domain nanomagnetic particles , discussed earlier . </S>",
    "<S> indeed spinglasses , because of their complexity , have been employed as paradigms for studying real structural glasses , an unresolved problem of modern condensed matter physics @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> + given this background on two distinct physical phenomena ( and yet manifestly similar properties ) of superparamagnets and spinglasses , a natural question to ask is : can there be spinglass - like physics emanating from a collection of single - domain nanomagnetic particles embedded in a non - metallic , non - magnetic host ? </S>",
    "<S> the answer is clearly an yes when the system is no longer a diluted one such that the supermoments start interacting via dipole - dipole coupling . because the dipolar interaction ( like the rkky - mediated exchange interaction ) is also endowed with competing ferro and antiferromagnetic bonds @xcite , as well as randomness due to random locations of the magnetic particles , all the attributes of spinglasses can be simulated in interacting single - domain particles . </S>",
    "<S> this will be analyzed below . </S>",
    "<S> + with the preceding discussion the plan of the paper is as follows . in sec . </S>",
    "<S> ii we discuss the relaxation of non - interacting single - domain particles based on a rudimentary rate theory . </S>",
    "<S> the results of this rate theory , coupled with polydispersity of the particles , are applied in sec . </S>",
    "<S> iii to a large body of recently published data on the slow dynamics of nanomagnets . </S>",
    "<S> section iv deals with a different set of experiments that necessarily requires incorporation of interactions between the nanoparticles and hence spinglass - like physics . </S>"
