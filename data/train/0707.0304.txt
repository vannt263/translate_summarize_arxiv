    "the evolutionary processes transforming massive , gas - rich circumstellar disks into tenuous , gas - poor debris disks are still not well understood . during this crucial interval , planets form and the remaining disk material",
    "is accreted or dispersed .",
    "the path by which this transition proceeds remains uncertain .",
    "do disks clear uniformly throughout via grain growth and settling or is the process accelerated in the inner regions forming gaps ( e.g. @xcite ) ?",
    "evidence of dust clearing should be visible in the infrared ( ir ) spectral energy distribution ( sed ) .",
    "the _ spitzer space telescope _",
    ", with its wide wavelength coverage and increased sensitivity , is starting to reveal a new population of disks with unusual seds .",
    "lack of mid - ir excess emission from disks has been interpreted as a sign of dust clearing since the first disk seds were observed with iras @xcite .",
    "further examples and some spectra ( e.g. hd 100546 , @xcite ) were obtained of a few herbig ae / be stars with the iso satellite . in this paper , we designate disks with this characteristic missing mid - ir emission as ` cold disks ' due to the lack of emission from warm dust .",
    "these seds morphologically fall between the seds of classical optically thick disks , which show excess emission throughout the ir , and debris disks characterized by very weak far - ir excesses , leading them to be considered as transitional objects between the two classes .",
    "spitzer spectra are particularly important to characterize the sharp rise , since they cover the critical 8 - 30 range .",
    "the earliest example discovered with spitzer was coku tau 4 modelled to have an inner hole within 10 au ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "three additional t tauri stars , tw hya , gm aur and dm tau @xcite , have been identified as also containing cleared inner regions .",
    "one of the most exciting proposed explanations for these cold disks is that a planet has cleared a gap in the disk and thus that these inner holes may trace the presence of planetary systems @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we present spitzer spectra of four young stars of f - g spectral type that show a deficit of dust emission from the inner 15 - 50 au of the disk yet strong excesses longward of 20 .",
    "these cold disk sources were identified in the first look survey of the cores to disks ( c2d ) spitzer legacy project @xcite , comprising @xmath0100 young ( @xmath3 10 myr ) stars , mainly t tauri k and m stars , with circumstellar disks .",
    "all four sources are characterized by a steep , @xmath010@xmath4 rise in flux beginning at 15 , indicating a sudden change in disk properties at a specific radius in a manner similar to that seen in the t tauri transitional disks .",
    "such objects are rare but provide an important window into disk evolution and planet formation processes .",
    "the 5 - 35 spectra were taken with the infrared spectrometer ( irs ; @xcite ) on spitzer using both low ( r=160 , @xmath5:5.2 - 14.5@xmath6 m , @xmath7:14.0 - 38.0@xmath6 m ) and high ( r=600 , @xmath8:9.9 - 19.6@xmath6 m , @xmath9:18.7 - 37.2@xmath6 m ) resolution modules .",
    "spectra were extracted from the spitzer science center ( ssc ) basic calibrated data ( bcd ) images , generated by pipeline s13 .",
    "for the low resolution spectra , the ssc pipeline full aperture extraction was used . for the high resolution modules , the c2d extraction , based on a combined sinc fitting of the spectral trace to account for bad pixels and background emission ,",
    "was used ( see @xcite for further details ) .",
    "mips sed spectra , taken as part of the c2d project , are included in the seds for all four cold disk sources .",
    "for each source the bcds were coadded using mopex .",
    "the coadded images were extracted with iraf , using an optimized extraction with a 3 or 5 column wide aperture .",
    "the large ( @xmath0100 object ) c2d irs first look sample allows comparison between the four cold disk sources and the remaining systems to identify trends which might be diagnostic of their evolutionary state .",
    "the small number of cold disk sources ( @xmath3 5% identified ) , both in the c2d sample and in the literature , suggests that this condition is rare either due to rapid evolutionary timescales undergone by all stars or due to an unusual condition unique to a small sample of stars .",
    "the four cold disk sources are clearly differentiated from the majority of the c2d star+disk systems by the @xmath010 fold increase in ir flux between 10 and 30 . to characterize this increase in dust emission ,",
    "we have used the 30/13 flux ratio ( see figure [ fig:1330 ] ) .",
    "these wavelengths have been chosen to avoid strong silicate features , but include the full increase in continuum emission .",
    "the majority of the sample has emission that increases by a factor of 2.3 @xmath10 1.4 between 13 and 30 while the transitional disks rise by factors of 5 - 15 .",
    "interestingly , out of a sample comprised of predominantly low - mass stars , the cold disk sources are all of intermediate mass with spectral types of f and g. the majority of k and m stars and the higher mass a and b stars have low 30/13 ratios . however , there are only a handful of a and b stars in our sample so it is difficult to draw any significant conclusions about such stars .",
    "all four cold disk sources show polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon ( pah ) features , particularly at 11.3 .",
    "such emission is uncommon in the c2d sample with only @xmath010% displaying pah features ( @xcite , see their figure 5 for blow - ups of the pah bands ) .",
    "the presence of pah features may be enhanced in these cold disks because the lack of dust in the inner disk lowers the mid - ir continuum flux creating a stronger line - to - continuum ratio , thus facilitating detection .",
    "the four disks are also characterized by weak to non - existent 10 amorphous silicate features .",
    "lkh@xmath11 330 is the only one that shows an unambiguous , though low contrast , 10 feature .",
    "the spectrum of hd 135344 includes the wavelength region of the full 10 band but shows no silicate feature .",
    "the spectra of sr 21 and t cha begin at 10 @xmath6 m , but appear to have only weak silicate emission , if any .",
    "the broader 20 silicate feature is harder to isolate from continuum dust emission , particularly with the sharp rise in the sed beyond 15 .",
    "however , some 20 emission does seem to be present .",
    "this feature traces colder regions of the disk than does the 10 feature , and thus indicates the presence of amorphous silicates further out in the disks .",
    "the h@xmath11 equivalent width is often used as a tracer of accretion .",
    "different dividing lines between non - accreting weak - line t tauri stars ( wtts ) and classical t tauri stars ( ctts ) have been proposed but it makes little difference to the classifications in these cases .",
    "sr 21 ( 0.54  in absorption , @xcite ) and t cha ( 2 - 10  , @xcite , @xcite ) are nominally wtts , although t cha is highly variable and close to the cutoff .",
    "lkh@xmath11 330 ( 11 - 20  , @xcite , @xcite ) and hd 135344 ( 17.4  , @xcite ) are clearly ctts .",
    "modeling is necessary in order to interpret the seds in terms of the physical structure of the disk . in particular , can a disk model with a gap accurately reproduce the seds , including the steep rise between 13 and 30 ? is such a fit possible without resorting to a gap ?",
    "the disks were modeled with the 2-d radiative transfer code radmc @xcite .",
    "the steep factor of 10 rise in flux between 13 and 30 prevents these disks from being fit well by conventional disk models .",
    "we introduce a very wide gap with an inner radius , @xmath12 , near 1 au and an outer radius , @xmath13 , near 30 au ( see table [ table : model ] for specific values ) . in order to model the steep change in emission associated with @xmath14 , grid refinement",
    "is introduced at @xmath13 as well as the inner dust rim , @xmath15 .",
    "a physical reduction in dust density is only one possible scenario which could result in this sed shape ( see  5 ) .",
    "input parameters for these models include the stellar mass , @xmath16 , radius , @xmath17 , and effective temperature , @xmath18 .",
    "kurucz models are used for the stellar photospheres . where possible ,",
    "values for stellar and disk properties are taken from the literature ( see table [ table : model ] ) .",
    "the @xcite pre - main sequence stellar tracks were used to check that the parameters were consistent .",
    "the effects of modest differences in the stellar properties on the mid - ir portions of the spectra are small .",
    "for example , a 100 k change in the stellar temperature results in a change in @xmath13 of 2 - 3 au .",
    "optical and ( sub)millimeter photometry is often not simultaneous and is dereddened using the extinction law of @xcite .",
    "the disks are assumed to be flared with surface height @xmath19 such that @xmath20 as in @xcite .",
    "the models do not calculate the hydrostatic equilibrium self - consistently and here the pressure scale height is set at the outer disk edge , @xmath21 , which is assumed to be 300 au for all the models .",
    "values slightly lower than predicted by hydrostatic equilibrium are needed to fit the outer disks of both hd 135344 and t cha , which produces a smaller silicate feature even in the models with no gap .",
    "this could indicate dust settling in the outer disk , which might be expected from the older ages ( 8 - 10 myr vs 2 - 3 myr ) infered by the @xcite tracks .",
    "the dust composition is set in all models to a silicate : carbon ratio of 4:1 .",
    "the grain sizes range from 0.01 to 10 @xmath6 m with a power - law index of -3.5 and a dust mass of @xmath22 .",
    "the upper size limit of 10 is large compared to interstellar grains @xcite , but was necessary to account for the lack of any 10 amorphous silicate feature .",
    "this indicates a skewing of the size distribution likely through grain growth .",
    "no crystalline silicates are included .",
    "a midplane layer of 2 mm grains containing 90%   of the total dust mass , with the remaining 10%   in @xmath23 , has been added to account for the ( sub)millimeter slope ( as in @xcite ) . the inner edge of the disk , @xmath15 ,",
    "was set at the radius where the dust sublimation temperature of @xmath24 @xmath0 1500 k is reached .",
    "a slightly puffed up inner rim was included with @xmath25 being set at 0.03 , just above the hydrostatic equilibrium value .",
    "the disk inclinations are not well constrained so @xmath26 30@xmath27 was used arbitrarily for sr 21 and lkh@xmath11 330 .",
    "t cha is more edge on so @xmath26 75@xmath27 was adopted @xcite and hd 135344 is more face - on with @xmath26 10@xmath28 @xcite .",
    "however , until the disk is nearly edge on and begins to obscure the central star , varying the inclination produces little effect on the gap properties .",
    "the optimal size of the gap necessary to fit the mid - ir is found by minimizing the @xmath29 of the fit ( see figure [ fig : chi ] ) .",
    "@xmath13 is tightly constrained by the steep rise at 13 , while @xmath12 is less well constrained . the dust density in the gap",
    "was reduced by 10@xmath30 compared to the equivalent models with no gaps , and the minimum reductions needed were factors of 10 - 100 .",
    "all of our sources have 1 - 10 excesses which require 0.02 - 0.24 m@xmath31 of dust between @xmath15 and @xmath32 , a fraction of only 10@xmath33 to 10@xmath30 of the total refractory dust mass available .",
    "this matter is optically thick to the stellar light at the midplane .",
    "if we remove _ all _ matter from the disk inward of @xmath13 , then the near - ir fluxes are underpredicted .",
    "these excesses clearly show that at least some dust must be close to the star .",
    "we model the 1 - 10 @xmath6 m excess by keeping the inner disk intact and only inserting a gap from @xmath34 to @xmath35 , where @xmath36 . for t cha , this results in a particularly small , hot dust region inside the gap which would have a very short lifetime , of order thousands of years at most , without a continual influx of material .",
    "we have identified four cold disks around f and g type stars with unusually steep flux rises between 10 and 30 , whose seds can only be modelled with wide gaps of inner radii of 0.2 - 0.8 au and outer radii 15 - 50 au .",
    "these gaps are generally larger than those inferred for the 4 t tauri stars with similar 30/13 ratios found so far , which have outer gap radii of 10 - 24 au .",
    "another difference is that our sources have small 1 - 10 excesses which demand that hot dust exists between the inner edge of the gap and the star , i.e. our sources have gaps rather than holes .",
    "the statistics on sources of different spectral types are still too small to conclude whether this is a general trend or peculiar to our sources , and whether this extends to herbig ae / be stars .",
    "dust clearing related to planet formation would be one of the most exciting explanations for the observed seds .",
    "there is also the possibility of the disk being disrupted and the dust cleared by a stellar companion .",
    "hd 135344 and sr 21 are part of wide binaries with separations of 204 and 64 , respectively ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "although no companions are currently known within the modeled @xmath21 , close binaries ( @xmath350 au ) can not be ruled out for any of the sources .    another proposed scenario for quickly clearing the inner disk region is photoevaporation ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "this physical process occurs when the photoevaporation rate driven by the ionizing flux from the central star matches the viscous accretion rate , resulting in an inner hole .",
    "the predicted size of the inner hole is given by @xmath37 , with @xmath38 10@xmath39 k to give @xmath40 10 km / s , leads to predicted hole radii of 13 - 18 au for 1.5 - 2 m@xmath41 stars , although a more rigorous examination of the gas dynamics revealed that this equation over - estimates the inner hole size @xcite .",
    "however , models of herbig ae stars ( m@xmath42=2.5 m@xmath41 ) that combine photoevaporation with viscous evolution and differential radial motions of dust and gas predict that the inner disk clears quickly but leaves gas - poor dust rings at 10 - 100 au @xcite .",
    "the accretion rates for all four cold disks , with the possible exception of sr 21 , are too high to make this scenario likely .",
    "an alternative to physically removing the dust is to let it grow beyond the size at which it efficiently radiates as a blackbody so that it no longer emits strongly in the mid - ir @xcite .",
    "there is general evidence for grain growth in disks from both mid - ir and millimeter data ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the lack of strong 10 amorphous silicate features also points to grains having grown beyond interstellar sizes .",
    "there has been much recent modeling work on clearing disks through grain growth .",
    "@xcite found that cold disk seds could be produced by dust coagulation but the timescales were too fast .",
    "replenishment of the dust was necessary to match observed lifetimes of the disks .",
    "if replenishment processes such as fragmentation occur preferentially in the innermost region due to higher temperatures and densities @xcite , this might be sufficient to produce the fraction of a lunar mass needed close to the star . @xcite",
    "invoke dust filtration by an embedded planet whereby large grains pile up at the outer edge of the gap while small grains and gas pass through , thus accounting for both the hot small dust grains needed to fit the near - ir and the high mass accretion rates .",
    "the high spatial resolution of alma should be able to test these scenarios by searching for and imaging the emission from ( sub)millimeter to centimeter sized grains .",
