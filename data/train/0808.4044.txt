    "grbs are the brightest transient astronomical events known . multi - wavelength observations of grbs have confirmed that a significant fraction of long grbs are associated with the collapse of short - lived massive stars @xcite .",
    "a number of satellites equipped for grb detection have been placed in low earth orbit , the most recent of these being the orbiting observatories _ swift_@xmath3 ( launched 2004 november ; @xcite ) and _ glast_@xmath3 ( launched 2008 june ) . up to the end of 2008 july _ swift _ has detected 345 bursts since its launch . in this period",
    "116 grb redshifts have been measured from this satellite s rapid localization capability and by follow - up spectroscopy of the optical / nir afterglow and host galaxies by large ground - based telescopes .",
    "prior to grb 980425 it was thought that all grbs were from a limited range of energies @xcite .",
    "this particular grb was the first to be associated with a supernova of type ib / c and was also the first low - luminosity ( i.e. , under - luminous ) grb ( ll grb ) to be identified @xcite .",
    "the total ( isotropic - equivalent ) gamma - ray energy emission was some 56 orders of magnitude less than for a typical ` classical ' grb ( fig . 2 of @xcite ) , demonstrating that grbs can occur with a wide range of energies @xcite .",
    "initially it was thought that this grb was anomalous but more recent detections have challenged that view .",
    "grbs 031203 and 060218 have been identified as possible analogues of grb 980425 ( @xcite ) and these three can be considered to form a ` typical ' set of ll grbs . for a brief description of these three bursts",
    "see @xcite .",
    "because of their sub - energetic nature and the flux limits of recent satellite detectors , the ll grbs detected thus far are in the local universe ( @xmath4 ) . apart from the three typical ll grbs mentioned above",
    ", other subluminous grbs have been detected  e.g. , grb 050826 @xcite  some of which have been classified as x - ray flashes  e.g. , xrfs 020903 , 030723 and 060218 @xcite  or x - ray rich  e.g. , grb 040223 @xcite .",
    "x - ray flashes may represent an extension of the grb population to low energies @xcite .",
    "although ll grb events may be more numerous than ` classical ' events @xcite only a few have been observed in the local universe @xcite .",
    "small - number statistics limit the precision in estimating the local rate density of ll grbs  see uncertainties for values of this parameter reported by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we show in this paper that the improved sensitivity and larger field - of - view ( fov ) of these new generation satellite detectors will dramatically increase the statistics of these currently rare bursts .",
    "we also show how the improved capabilities of these detectors allows detection of ll grbs at higher @xmath5 .",
    "( for a perspective on studies of high-@xmath5 grbs with new generation instruments see @xcite . )",
    "the aim of this study is to compare the detection capabilities of three gamma - ray detector satellites for observing ll grbs , focusing on grb detection rates of the primary burst detectors of _ swift _ , _ glast _ and _ exist_@xmath3 ( intended to be launched about 2015 ) .",
    "we utilize only the primary detector parameters of flux sensitivity , fov and detector bandwidth for this study . for _ glast",
    "_ we assume the gamma - ray burst monitor ( gbm ) is the detector that will trigger on and monitor ll grbs @xcite . similarly , for _ exist _ we assume the high energy telescope ( het ) is the primary ll grb detector . thus ,",
    "our results for _ glast _ and _ exist _ define a lower bound on the detection capabilities of these new satellite detectors .",
    "in the _ swift _ era the detection rate of ll grbs is low . to gain an understanding of the progenitors and the mechanisms that cause ll grbs demands an improved detection rate .",
    "the sub - energetic nature of these events requires detectors with increased sensitivity and/or fov .",
    "we show in this paper how the improvement of these two parameters will increase the rate of detection of ll grbs .",
    "we use _ swift _ as a reference detector against which the newer detectors are compared .",
    "we briefly describe below the detector parameters for the three satellites . in the next section",
    "we will compare the predicted observational capabilities of these instruments .",
    "although we restrict the model to the major nasa high - energy observatories we note that other detectors suitable for ll grb studies are operational or are planned : _",
    "agile_@xmath3(launched 2007 april ) is a currently flying detector sensitive in the 30 mev50 gev band ; _ janus _ is a nasa small explorer ( smex ) early universe mission ( planned launch 2012 ) with a 120 kev x - ray flash monitor ; _ maxi_@xmath3(planned launch 2009 may ) , as an external facility of the international space station , will continuously monitor the whole sky for x - rays in the 0.530 kev energy band ; and _ svom _ ( planned launch 2012 ) , is a sino - french grb satellite detector with a trigger spectral domain of 4250 kev and a mission design that encompasses rapid ground - based follow - up observations .    on board",
    "* _ swift _ * , bursts are detected by the burst alert telescope , bat @xcite , a 1.4 sr fov , 15150 kev coded mask detector with a 5200 @xmath6 cadmium - zinc - teluride detector plane .",

    "the * gamma - ray large area space telescope * ( _ glast_@xmath3 ) , launched in 2008 june , is a current generation satellite for gamma - ray astronomy .",
    "the _ glast _ gbm consists of 12 nai detectors for the 8 kev to 1 mev range , and two bismuth germanate ( bgo ) detectors for the 150 kev to 30 mev range @xcite , with its burst trigger band being 50300 kev @xcite .",
    "its fov is 9 sr , about 6@xmath10 times larger than _ swift _ s .    the * energetic x - ray imaging survey telescope * ( _ exist _ ) is currently proposed to be a free - flying mission to detect grbs @xcite and conduct a hard x - ray sky survey @xcite . _",
    "exist _ will have two sets of coded mask telescope systems : a high - energy telescope ( het ) to cover the 5600 kev band and a low - energy telescope ( let ) for the 330 kev band .",
    "the ( partially - coded ) fov of the het will be about 2 sr ( j. grindlay , personal communication , 2008 - 08 - 06 ) .    to compare detection rates of ll grbs for these detectors we use their peak flux detection thresholds .",
    "determining the relative detection capabilities of these instruments is not simple for a number of reasons ( e.g. , see @xcite ) : the detectors are sensitive across different energy ranges and also vary over the fov ; the triggering algorithms are peculiar to each detector ; accumulation times vary and there are synergies and interferences between instruments on the same satellite . as our study is a gross comparison of detector capabilities we will take an uncomplicated approach to quantifying the relative detection capabilities of these three detectors .    in @xcite ,",
    "detection thresholds for the three detectors are normalized to the 11000 kev energy band .",
    "we approximate the peak flux thresholds of the detectors by using figs . 7 , 8 & 9 of @xcite .",
    "to approximate the peak flux thresholds we take the midpoint value of the peak flux range as defined by the trigger band of each detector .",
    "we obtain ( 2.0 , 3.5 , 0.3 ) ph  @xmath8  s@xmath9 , respectively . we express this in terms of relative sensitivities of ( 1.0 , 0.6 , 6.7 ) using the _ swift _ bat as the reference detector .",
    "these values are employed in the following section to determine the comparative flux thresholds of these detectors .",
    "the aim is to calculate the distribution of detectable grbs as a function of @xmath5 using the primary detector parameters mentioned above .",
    "the model assumes a flat cosmology with @xmath11 = 71 km s@xmath9 mpc@xmath9 , @xmath12 = 0.7 and @xmath13 = 0.3 ( the concordance cosmology ) .",
    "we employ a grb detection rate model with two free parameters : the grb local rate density , @xmath14 , and the ( two - jet ) beaming factor , @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the opening half - angle of a jet .",
    "we note that both these parameters are uncertain . for simplicity",
    "we fix @xmath17 and constrain @xmath18 from the model and the observed hl _",
    "swift _ grbs .      to calculate the detection rate of grbs we start with the following differential rate equation ( see @xcite , @xcite ) , which is valid for all independent cosmological transient events :    @xmath19    here @xmath20 is the grb differential event rate in units of @xmath21  per unit redshift",

    "an ` effective ' ( or potentially observable ) differential event rate that takes beaming into account is @xmath27 it is the grb rate observed by an infinitely sensitive detector with an unobscured all - sky view .",
    ".we employ two parameters in the model : the grb local rate density , @xmath14 , and the beaming factor , @xmath17 .",
    "the _ swift _ detection rate inferred from the total number of bursts over the mission time constrains @xmath28 ; @xmath29 is taken from @xcite and the @xmath17 are from @xcite and @xcite . [ cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]     the locations of the ll grb peaks in redshift ( upper panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : predobsrates_llandhl ] ) is determined by the relative sensitivities ( and , to a lesser extent , trigger bandwidths ) of the detectors .",
    "a more sensitive detector will be triggered by a greater number of distant grbs .",
    "the peak ll detection rates of bat and gbm occur in the redshift regime of @xmath30 $ ] while for het they occur at the significantly higher redshift of just over 0.7 .",
    "the ll grb detection horizon distances of the above detectors are @xmath31 .",
    "the sensitivity of het will also enable it to detect hl grbs at higher @xmath5 , thus probing a larger volume of space , as shown by the lower panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : predobsrates_llandhl ] .",
    "the height of each curve in fig .",
    "[ fig : predobsrates_llandhl ] is proportional to the fov of the detector . for a bright grb population",
    "the fov is the dominant parameter , but sensitivity becomes important for detecting fainter bursts , as illustrated by comparing the gbm and het curves for both populations in fig .",
    "[ fig : predobsrates_llandhl ] ( upper and lower panels ) .",
    "the moderately large fov of het coupled with its relatively high sensitivity implies it will detect an order of magnitude more ll grbs than the other two satellites combined ( table  3 ) .",
    "the large fov of gbm enables it to capture the most bursts for @xmath32 even though it is the least sensitive detector in this comparison study .",
    "its large fov also makes it the optimal detector out of the three for hl grbs out to redshift about 4.5 .",
    "[ fig : predobsrates_combined ] indicates that het will also be able to detect grbs in the early universe , thus potentially probing the evolutionary history of grbs .    from the upper panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : predobsrates_llandhl ] we note that het will detect large numbers of nearby ll grbs and , thus , significantly add to the statistics of this under - luminous population .",
    "in addition , fig .  [",
    "fig : detectorscfns ] shows that het takes over from gbm as the most efficient ll grb detector for @xmath33 in spite of it having a quarter of the gbm s fov .",
    "this is due to het s higher sensitivity , which is also reflected in het having a much larger ll horizon distance than the other two detectors .    _",
    "glast_@xmath3 s gbm , having the largest fov , produces thebroad and high differential detection rate prominent in the lower panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : predobsrates_llandhl ] .",
    "the predicted @xmath5-integrated detection rates of ll grbs are ( 0.2 , 0.4 , 6.5 ) yr@xmath9 for bat ( _ swift _ ) , gbm ( _ glast _ ) and het ( _ exist _ ) , respectively .    the notch in fig .",
    "[ fig : predobsrates_combined ] for the het curve is a result of two factors : ( 1 ) het s high sensitivity will detect a higher proportion of ll grbs than will the other two satellites and ( 2 ) the low ll grb beaming factor and high local rate density ( compared to hl grbs ) results in an effective differential ll rate about 250 times that of hl grbs",
    ". however , it may take two to three decades for this feature to become apparent .",
    "hence , it is unlikely that any single satellite observatory will detect this ` hidden ' ll peak during an operational career .",
    "nonetheless , even the 3 or so ll grbs detectable by _ swift _ and _ glast _ in the next 5 years will be a significant addition and will provide constraints on this population .",
    "we note two selection effects that may be significant but are not included in this study .",
    "firstly , as @xcite showed , the bat is more sensitive to high - redshift bursts because of their longer duration .",
    "secondly , the rate density of grbs may be evolving at high redshift , as suggested by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "@xcite reach a similar conclusion , but explain a higher than expected rate as evidence for an evolving grb luminosity function .",
    "these issues remain uncertain .",
    "however , their effect does not influence the main results from this study since our focus is on the detectability of small - redshift ll bursts .",
    "we also note that selection effects that plague the present grb redshift distribution need to be understood to exploit fully data for studying grb rate evolution .",
    "@xcite show that selection effects are especially dominant in the optical afterglow and spectroscopic observations of _",
    "swift_-triggered bursts .    in summary",
    ", we show that het will probe both ll grbs and early - universe grbs while gbm will be more sensitive to the hl population out to @xmath34 .",
    "surprisingly , we find that despite the lower sensitivity of gbm , its large fov implies a ll grb detection rate greater than that of bat and het out to the gbm s sensitivity horizon of @xmath35 importantly , het will increase the ll grb detection rate by a factor of about 30 compared to _",
    "it will open up a new detection regime by probing the ll grb population in a significantly larger volume out to @xmath36 .",
