    "the study of the path for connecting the string theory with the low - energy physics is one of the most important issues in particle physics and cosmology .",
    "however , we are still in the early stages of the study .",
    "in fact , we do not yet have a comprehensive string - based understanding of apparent characteristic patterns in quark and lepton masses and mixings at low energies .",
    "it is considered that these characteristic patterns are closely linked to the flavor symmetry , which is expected to arise from the symmetric structure of the compact space in the string theory .",
    "it is also likely that the flavor symmetry controls the mass spectra of heavy particles in the intermediate energy region as well as those of quarks and leptons .",
    "recent developments in the string theory have provided new aspects of string phenomenology .",
    "it has been pointed out in ref.@xcite that a new type of non - abelian flavor symmetry can appear additionally if the compact space is non - commutative . as a matter of fact ,",
    "in a string with discrete torsion , the coordinates become non - commutative operators.@xcite as a phenomenological approach , in refs.@xcite and @xcite the flavor symmetry @xmath1 has been introduced into the string - inspired model , where the cyclic group @xmath9 and the binary dihedral group @xmath10 have r symmetries , while @xmath11 has not .

    "we have discussed the projective representation of the dihedral group @xmath12 , which is identical with the binary dihedral group @xmath10 . ] the introduction of a binary representation of non - abelian flavor symmetry is motivated also by the phenomenological observation that the r - handed majorana neutrino mass for the third generation is nearly equal to the geometrical average of the string scale @xmath13 ( @xmath14gev ) and the electroweak scale @xmath15 . in ref.@xcite , solving the anomaly - free conditions under many phenomenological constraints coming from the particle spectra , we were led to a large mixing angle ( lma)-msw solution with @xmath16 , in which the appropriate flavor charges are assigned to the matter fields .",
    "the solution includes phenomenologically acceptable results concerning fermion masses and mixings and also concerning hierarchical energy scales including the string scale , @xmath17 scale and the majorana mass scale of r - handed neutrinos .    in the framework of the string theory ,",
    "we are prohibited from adding extra matter fields by hand .",
    "this situation is in sharp contrast to that of the conventional gut - type models .",
    "in fact , in the perturbative heterotic string theory we have no adjoint or higher representation matter ( higgs ) fields . within this rigid framework",

    "the renormalization group ( rg ) equations down from the @xmath13 have been studied for the scalar masses squared of the gauge non - singlet matter fields .",
    "it has been found that the radiative breaking of the gauge symmetry can occur slightly below the @xmath13 due to the large yukawa coupling which is identical with the colored higgs coupling .",
    "this symmetry breaking triggers a subsequent symmetry breaking.@xcite then , we obtain the sequential symmetry breaking @xmath19 where @xmath20 and @xmath21 represent the pati - salam @xmath22@xcite and the standard model gauge group , respectively .    the purpose of this paper is to pursue the further exploration of the path from the string scale physics to the low - energy physics . for this purpose",
    "we examine the particle spectra in the intermediate energy region in detail in the @xmath0 model with the flavor symmetry @xmath18 .",
    "afterward , the rg runnings of the gauge couplings are studied up to two - loop order .",
    "it should be emphasized that in our model the unification scale is not the so - called gut scale ( @xmath23 but around the string scale ( @xmath24 . we find a solution of the gauge coupling unification by adjusting the spectra of the anti - generation matter fields , with which the khler class moduli fields couple . in this solution @xmath25 and @xmath26 gauge couplings meet at @xmath27 .",
    "however , @xmath28 and @xmath29 gauge couplings are not perturbatively unified at the string scale .",

    "this paper is organized as follows . in  2 ,",
    "we explain main features of the @xmath0 model with the flavor symmetry @xmath18 .",
    "although we have never yet found a concrete example of the string compactification which induces this type of the flavor symmetry exactly , @xmath30 type of the flavor symmetry appears in some kinds of the calabi - yau compactification.@xcite further , the binary type of the flavor symmetry is expected to stem from the compact space with non - commutative geometry . in this paper",
    "we assume @xmath18 as the flavor symmetry . in  3 , we examine the particle spectra in the intermediate energy region ranging from the @xmath13 to the @xmath15 . in the intermediate energy region there appear rich spectra of extra heavy particles beyond the minimal supersymmetric standard model . after presenting the two - loop rg equations of the gauge couplings in the intermediate region , we carry out the numerical analysis of the rg runnings of the gauge couplings in  4 .",
