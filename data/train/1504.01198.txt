    "when the afm dw arrives at the junction interface ( @xmath58 ps ) , both the end spins of the dw are pinned at the junction , whereas the central part of the dw continues to move due to stt in the wide part of the nanotrack .",

    "this process is analogous to blowing air through soapy water using bubble pipes or plastic wands to create soap bubbles .",

    "we show the relation between the magnitude of the injected current and the velocity in fig .",
    "[ fig6]a , where the velocity is proportional to the injected current .",
    "we recall that the fm skyrmion is easily destroyed by touching the sample edges due to the skhe . at the same time , the maximum velocity of the fm skyrmion in a fm nanotrack is typically much less than @xmath74 m s@xmath75 , limited by the confining force of @xmath76  @xcite .",
    "conversely , there is no skhe for the afm skyrmion .",
    "hence , it can move straightly in an afm nanotrack without touching the edge .",
    "it is shown in , where a chain of encoded afm skyrmions moves in a nanotrack with a speed of @xmath77 m s@xmath75 driven by a vertical current without touching edges .    in fig .",
    "[ fig6]b we compare the afm and fm skyrmions .",
    "the velocity of afm skyrmions can be very large compared to fm skyrmion , which is suitable for ultrafast information processing and communications .",
    "the steady motion of afm skyrmions is demonstrated in , where they move in a thin film without boundary effect driven by the vertical spin current .",
    "this highly contrasts with the case of fm skyrmions demonstrated in , where skyrmions do not move either parallel or perpendicular to the film edges .",
    "we have proposed magnetic skyrmions in the afm system .",
    "the dynamics of afm skyrmions is very different from those in the fm system , since they are topologically protected and are free from the skhe .",
    "we have first checked that our simulation software reproduces a linear dispersion relation inherent to the two - sublattice structure of the afm system , and then employ it to explore various properties of the afm skyrmion .",
    "it is worth mentioning there are two recent preprints  @xcite on afm skyrmions , including the preliminary version of the present work  @xcite . our work is focused on the injection and vertical spin current - driven dynamics of afm skyrmions . regarding the other work in ref .",
    ", the thermal properties as well as in - plane current - induced dynamics of an afm skyrmion have been studied and a high - speed motion ( @xmath78 m s@xmath75 ) of an afm skyrmion has also been shown in the absence of the skhe , consistent with the present work .",

    "we perform the micromagnetic simulations using the object oriented micromagnetic framework ( oommf ) together with the dmi extension module  @xcite .",
    "the time - dependent magnetization dynamics is governed by the llgs equation  @xcite .",
    "the oommf has been developed originally and used extensively for the simulation of fm systems , and we have checked that one may use it to analyze the nanotexture in the afm system as well .",
    "indeed , we have successfully reproduced a linear dispersion relation inherent to the two - sublattice structure , as shown in .    for micromagnetic simulations ,",
    "we consider @xmath79-nm - thick magnetic nanodisks and nanotracks on the substrate .",
    "with respect to the material parameters , we recall  @xcite that an antiferromagnet is a special case of a ferrimagnet for which both sublattices _ a _ and _ b _ have equal saturation magnetization .",
    "both the dmi and the pma arise from the spin orbit coupling , albeit in different forms .",
    "we have checked that our results hold for a wide range of material parameters ( ) . here , we use the parameters of the same order as those given in ref .   for afm materials .",
    "we thus adopt the magnetic parameters from refs .  :",

    "<S> two approaches for creating the afm skyrmion have been described based on micromagnetic lattice simulations : ( i ) by injecting a vertical spin - polarized current to a nanodisk with the afm ground state ; ( ii ) by converting an afm domain - wall pair in a nanowire junction . </S>",
    "<S> it is demonstrated that the afm skyrmion , driven by the spin - polarized current , can move straightly over long distance , benefiting from the absence of the skhe . </S>",
    "<S> our results will open a new strategy on designing the novel spintronic devices based on afm materials . *    skyrmion is a topologically protected soliton in continuous field theory , which is recently realized in both bulk non - centrosymmetric magnetic materials  @xcite and thin films  @xcite , where the ferromagnetic ( fm ) background is described by the non - linear sigma model with the dzyaloshinskii - moriya interaction ( dmi )  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the study of the magnetic skyrmion is one of the hottest topics in condensed matter physics , due to its potential applications in information processing and computing  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> there are several ways to create magnetic skyrmions , e.g. , by applying spin - polarized current to a nanodisk  @xcite , by applying the laser  @xcite , from a notch  @xcite and by the conversion from a domain wall ( dw ) pair  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a magnetic skyrmion can be driven by the spin - polarized current  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , it does not move parallel to the injected current due to the skyrmion hall effect ( skhe ) , since its topological number is @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> this will pose a severe challenge for realistic applications which require a straight motion of magnetic skyrmions along the direction of the applied current  @xcite .    in this work , </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate that a skyrmion can be nucleated in antiferromagnets , as illustrated in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1 ] , based on micromagnetic lattice simulations . </S>",
    "<S> we refer to it as an antiferromagnetic ( afm ) skyrmion . </S>",
    "<S> we further show that the afm skyrmion can move parallel to the applied current since the skhe is completely suppressed , which is very promising for spintronic applications .    </S>",
    "<S> recently , antiferromagnets emerge as a new field of spintronics  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a one - dimensional topological soliton in antiferromagnets is an afm dw  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> an afm dw can be moved by spin transfer torque ( stt ) induced by spin - polarized currents or spin waves  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> besides , a two - dimensional ( 2d ) topological soliton , that is , the magnetic vortex , has been studied in 2d afm materials  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the afm system has an intrinsic two - sublattice structure . </S>",
    "<S> the spins of the ground state are perfectly polarized in each sublattice . </S>",
    "<S> we may calculate the topological number of the spin texture projected to each sublattice . </S>",
    "<S> hence , we propose to assign a set of topological numbers @xmath2 to one afm skyrmion , which shows no skhe since it has no net magnetization .    </S>",
    "<S> we also present two approaches to create an afm skyrmion . </S>",
    "<S> one is applying a spin - polarized current perpendicularly to a disk region , which flips the spin in the applied region . </S>",
    "<S> the other is a conversion from an afm dw pair in junction geometry as in the case of the conversion of a fm skyrmion from a fm dw pair  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we show that it is possible to move an afm skyrmion by applying a spin - polarized current . </S>",
    "<S> the afm skyrmion can travel very long distance without touching the sample edges . </S>",
    "<S> it is also insensible to the external magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> these results will be important from the applied perspective of magnetic skyrmions . </S>"
