    "the work in the present paper falls within the theory of mod @xmath0 modular galois representations .",

    "suppose we have a hecke eigenform @xmath42 on @xmath12 , and let @xmath43be the @xmath1-adic galois representation attached to it ( i.e. , @xmath44 is a @xmath45-dimensional @xmath32$]-vector space with a continuous action of @xmath46 ) .",

    "the representations @xmath54 are approximations of @xmath57 , and one can hope to understand @xmath57 by first understanding its approximations @xmath58 .    the corresponding theory when @xmath59 has been of fundamental importance and has had numerous applications in arithmetic and geometry , e.g. , in the proof of fermat s last theorem and in the proof of serre s modularity conjecture .",
    "this theory has a  level \" aspect and a  weight \" aspect .",
    "the most important part of the  level \" aspect is ribet s level lowering theory , which translates statements about the structure of the restriction of @xmath60 to a decomposition subgroup @xmath61 } = \\gal(\\qc[\\ell]/\\q[\\ell])$ ] to a congruence mod @xmath1 between @xmath42 and some other hecke eigenform of level @xmath62 whenever @xmath56 is a prime divisor of @xmath63 and @xmath64 .",
    "thus it is natural to try to understand @xmath58 by studying congruences mod @xmath0 between eigenforms .",
    "this approach has been developed to some extent , for example in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "an application of level lowering mod @xmath0 to diophantine problems is given in @xcite .",
    "related to this is the problem of stripping powers of @xmath1 from the level .",
    "concretely , we have the following result .    let @xmath65 be the highest power of @xmath66 dividing @xmath63 .",
    "then there exists a hecke eigenform @xmath67 of level @xmath68 such that @xmath69 .    for @xmath70 ,",
    "this was shown by ribet ( @xcite , theorem 2.1 ) . for @xmath71 ,",
    "this was shown independently by buzzard ( @xcite ) and by hatada @xcite .",
    "in the course of their study of this problem , chen , kiming and wiese ( @xcite ) introduced the following three progressively weaker notions of eigenforms mod @xmath0 : strong eigenforms , weak eigenforms , and dc - weak eigenforms , where  dc \" stands for  divided congruence \" . roughly , strong eigenforms are reductions mod @xmath0 of hecke eigenforms in characteristic 0 , while weak eigenforms are reductions of modular forms mod @xmath0 that behave like hecke eigenforms after reduction .",
    "a dc - weak eigenform is defined in a similar manner by extending the action of hecke operators to the space of divided congruences , first introduced by katz ( @xcite ) , which consists of sums @xmath72 of modular forms , not necessarily with integral coefficients , such that @xmath72 does have integral @xmath73-expansion .",
    "these are also instances of katz generalised @xmath1-adic modular functions .",
    "the notions of strong , weak , and dc - weak coincide when @xmath33 , but they are distinct when @xmath74 . a discussion of how these notions compare is given at the end of section 3 .",
    "the authors of @xcite show that one can attach to each eigenform in one of these classes a galois representation with the natural desired properties ( i.e. , the trace of the image of frobenius is related to the coefficients of the @xmath73-coefficients of the eigenform ) .",
    "the dc - weak eigenforms provide the context for a ribet - type level lowering result mod @xmath0 for modular galois representations modulo @xmath0 .",
    "let @xmath42 be a mod @xmath0 dc - weak eigenform of level @xmath75 .",
    "assume that the residual representation @xmath60 is absolutely irreducible .",
    "also assume @xmath4 .",
    "then there exists a mod @xmath0 dc - weak eigenform @xmath67 of level @xmath63 such that @xmath76 .",
    "furthermore , it is asked in @xcite whether , in the case that @xmath42 is a strong eigenform , @xmath67 can also be taken to be a strong eigenform . to be able to investigate this question",
    "experimentally one needs some sort of bound on the weights in which strong eigenforms arise .",
    "this leads us to the  weight \" aspect , which we will discuss next .    when @xmath33 , we have the following classical  weight bound \" result of jochnowitz . ] .",
    "suppose @xmath42 is a ( characteristic @xmath77 ) eigenform of level @xmath63 .",
    "then there exists a ( characteristic @xmath77 ) eigenform @xmath67 of level @xmath63 and weight at most @xmath78 such that @xmath79 .    in the above theorem",
    ", the congruence between the two eigenforms means that their @xmath73-expansions are coefficient - wise congruent mod @xmath1 .",
    "this result shows that there are only finitely many congruence classes of mod @xmath1 eigenforms of level @xmath63 , and hence only finitely many isomorphism classes of modular mod @xmath1 galois representations of conductor @xmath63 .",
    "this allows us to study mod @xmath1 galois representations experimentally ( see for example @xcite )",
    ". moreover , jochnowitz result was used by edixhoven ( @xcite ) to prove that the weaker form of serre s modularity conjecture implies the stronger form of the same conjecture .    in @xcite ,",
    "the author together with kiming and wiese showed , using an idea of frank calegari , the existence of a uniform weight bound on strong eigenforms mod @xmath0 .",
    "more precisely , the result is the following .",
    "there exists a constant @xmath80 depending only on @xmath63 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 such that any eigenform in characteristic @xmath77 of level @xmath63 is congruent mod @xmath0 to a modular form of level @xmath63 of weight at most @xmath80 .    in fact , it was conjectured in @xcite that there are only finitely many congruence classes of strong eigenforms mod @xmath0 for any @xmath2 .",
    "this is still an open problem and it is related to work of buzzard ( @xcite ) regarding slopes of modular forms .",
    "it is therefore interesting to ask whether such a weight bound exists for weak and dc - weak eigenforms as well .",
    "the main purpose of this work is to show that no such bound exists for dc - weak eigenforms . in particular , if we denote by @xmath81 the space of divided congruences of level @xmath63 with coefficients in @xmath82 and weight at most @xmath83 ( see [ dcsection ] for the definition ) , then we have the following result .",
    "suppose @xmath84 .",
    "then for all integers @xmath85 , @xmath86 , there exists a mod @xmath0 dc - weak eigenform @xmath87 , such @xmath88 and @xmath89 for any @xmath90 .",
    "the strategy is as follows .",
    "first , we introduce the space of divided congruences of level @xmath63 and coefficients in a @xmath91$]-algebra @xmath82 , and establish a base change property for this space .",
    "then , we describe the action of the hecke operators on divided congruences , and the hecke algebra they generate .",
    "when @xmath82 is finitely generated as a @xmath91$]-module , we establish a duality between the space divided congruences and the corresponding hecke algebra .",
    "this gives us a base change property for the hecke algebra @xmath92 , and allows us to identify dc - weak eigenforms with coefficients in @xmath82 with certain @xmath91$]-algebra homomorphisms @xmath93 .",
    "next , we introduce the notions of weight filtration and nilpotence filtration .",
    "the weight filtration of a divided congruence is the lowest weight in which it appears .",
    "the nilpotence filtration , first introduced by khare ( @xcite ) , is defined in terms of the nilpotence of the action of the hecke operators on the divided congruence under consideration .",
    "nilpotence of hecke operators is also the main tool used in @xcite to investigate hecke algebras attached to mod @xmath1 modular forms .",
    "while the weight filtration is easier to handle on a computer , the nilpotence filtration is somehow easier and more natural to study from a theoretical point of view . for divided congruences mod @xmath0 ,",
    "we establish a comparison result between the weight filtration and the nilpotence filtration .",
    "in particular , we show that controlling one of these filtrations means controlling the other .",
    "finally , we produce a situation in which the hecke algebra @xmath92 is explicitly known ( and is a finite integral extension of a power series ring ) .",
    "this allows us to write continuous maps @xmath93 with arbitrarily large nilpotence filtrations , concluding the proof",
    ".    it would be interesting to answer the question of existence of weight bounds for weak eigenforms , but this seems to be a harder problem .",
    "the first difficulty lies in that the hecke algebra corresponding to the space @xmath94 ( which consists of sums of classical modular forms with coefficients in @xmath82 , see [ dcsection ] ) is more difficult to control .",
    "there is however another difficulty .",
    "even if one knows explicitly the structure of the hecke algebra of @xmath94 , the above construction , which works for dc - weak eigenforms , would a priori produce only eigenforms which are sums of modular forms of different weights .",
    "we should therefore find a criterion that ensures that a dc - weak eigenform in @xmath94 is weak , i.e. , that it lives in a single weight .",
    "we present a result in this direction , which is a strengthening of proposition 25 in @xcite .",
    "let @xmath82 be a quotient of @xmath6 that contains @xmath26 .",
    "let @xmath95 be a ( normalised ) dc - weak eigenform with coefficients in @xmath82 .",
    "then @xmath42 is weak if and only if the eigenvalue of @xmath42 under the action of @xmath96}$ ] lies in @xmath26 .",
    "[ heckeops ] closely follows @xcite ( and its generalisation to higher levels in @xcite ) , and contains slight generalisations of several basic lemmas used in @xcite from the case of coefficients in a finite field to the case of more general coefficient rings .",
    "we chose to make explicit all the details in order to provide a clear reference for these basic results for future use . in the appendix",
    ", we provide a technical lemma for interchanging tensor product and projective limit which is needed to establish the base change property for the hecke algebra .",
    "for a positive integer @xmath97 , we denote by @xmath98\\!]\\ ] ] the @xmath6-module of @xmath73-expansions of cusp forms of weight @xmath99 on @xmath12 with coefficients in @xmath6 .",
