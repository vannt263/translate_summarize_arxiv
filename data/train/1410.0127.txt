    "quasars represent the high luminosity tail of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) . among their multiple applications",
    "are probing the intergalactic medium ( borodoi et al . 2014 ) or providing information on massive black hole growth ( kelly et al .",
    "2011 ) , but they have been also proposed as promising tracers of the expansion of the universe .",
    "the latter two aspects mostly rely on the presence of the broad emission lines in quasar spectra .",
    "the blr ( broad line region ) is unresolved but the spectral variability allows to measure the size of the blr from the time delay between the lines and of the continuum .",
    "for sources at redshifts @xmath2 the suitable line for such study is mg ii , monitored in the optical range .",
    "this delay is then used to determine the absolute quasar luminosity ( see czerny et al .",
    "2013 ) employing the idea of dust origin of the blr ( czerny & hryniewicz 2011 ) .",
    "using the south african large telescope ( salt ) , we obtained five spectra of the qso cts c30.10 , taken in a period of 15 months .",
    "all the spectra were analysed separately , in a relatively narrow spectral range of 2700  2900    in the rest frame .",
    "we used 16 different feii pseudo - continuum templates and we fit the spectra with the continuum and the mg ii line at the same time .",
    "the mg ii line in this source had to be modelled by two separate kinematic components , meaning that cts c30.10 is a type b source .",
    "we considered two components in emission with a double lorentzian line shape , which provided the best fit . using photometry from the optical gravitational lensing experiment ( ogle )",
    ", we were able to calibrate the spectra properly and to obtain the calibrated line and continuum luminosity .",
    "the time dependence of the salt mg ii flux , and ogle and catalina survey continuum luminosity are shown in fig . 2 ( modzelewska et al . 2014 ) .",
    "the monitoring of the distant quasar for 15 months has not allowed yet for any firm conclusion on the time delay between the continuum and the mg ii line ; however , we can try to make some preliminary estimates based on the fact that the continuum had a clear maximum just at the beginning of our monitoring campaign .",
    "reverberation studies of quasars can be used as new cosmology probes of the expansion of the universe .",
    "the understanding of the formation of the blr in agn , and in particular of the properties of the mg ii line , is also important in a much broader context .",
    "the measurement important for cosmological applications is the time delay , and this can be determined well in type b sources .",
    "our monitoring has been too short so far to allow for a detection , but the variability pattern of the line and the continuum seems to suggest a delay of about 300 days ."
