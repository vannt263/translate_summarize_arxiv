    "dynamical chiral symmetry breaking in the theory of quantum electrodynamics in ( 2 + 1 ) dimensions , qed@xmath4 , @xcite has been studied quite intensively over the years .",
    "the problem is of considerable interest for two reasons . on the one hand , qed@xmath4 has enough similarities to quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) such that analogies to the more complicated non - abelian case may be drawn . on the other hand ,",
    "qed@xmath4 itself is of considerable interest due to possible applications in condensed matter systems .",
    "in particular , qed@xmath4 with @xmath5 flavours of massless fermions has been suggested as an effective low energy theory of high-@xmath6 cuprate superconductors @xcite .",
    "these possess an unconventional @xmath7-wave symmetry of the pairing condensate , with nodes at the electronic fermi surface allowing for a description in terms of massless nodal quasi - particles .",
    "the quasi - particles do not couple to an external electromagnetic field and hence represent pure spin degrees of freedom ; a spin - charge separation has taken place . the interaction of these spinons with the collective , topological excitations of the gap can be described by a @xmath8 gauge theory . since furthermore the motion of the quasi - particles is mainly confined to the two - dimensional copper - oxygen planes in these systems one ends up with quantum electrodynamics in ( 2 + 1 ) dimensions .",
    "depending on whether the system is ordered or disordered it is either in an insulating quantum antiferromagnetic ( af ) phase or a pseudogap ( pg ) phase with remnant properties of the underlying superconductor . in the gauge theory the af - phase corresponds to a phase with broken chiral symmetry and long - range correlations due to massless photons . in the pg - phase",
    "the fermions are massless and the fermion wave function as well as the photon propagator develop power laws at small momenta with a fractional anomalous dimension @xcite .",
    "the above considerations explain the interest in determining @xmath0 , the critical number of fermion flavours for the chiral phase transition of qed@xmath4 .",
    "if @xmath9 then the effective low energy theory is chirally broken at zero temperature .",
    "for the superconductor this means that the theory displays a phase transition between the superconducting and the antiferromagnetic phase when doping is varied @xcite .",
    "if on the other hand @xmath10 the system goes from a superconducting to a pseudogap - phase when underdoped .    the value of @xmath0 has been investigated in a number of studies from dyson - schwinger equations ( dses ) in the continuum @xcite and lattice gauge theory @xcite .",
    "while the former allows for numerical as well as analytical studies in principle there remains the question of the importance of truncation artefacts . for @xmath0",
    "a partial answer has been obtained in @xcite , where it was found that the details of the fermion - photon vertex only have a minor quantitative impact on @xmath0 . in particular for all vertex dressings employed @xmath0 stayed well above @xmath11 .    in all studies of dynamical chiral symmetry breaking in continuum",
    "qed@xmath4 a clear separation of scales has been found .",
    "the intrinsic scale of the theory is given by the dimensionful coupling constant @xmath12 .",
    "then a second and much lower scale is given by the dynamically generated fermion mass @xmath13 in the chiral limit .",
    "related to this one has small values for the other order parameter , the chiral condensate .",
    "on the lattice with its finite volume this separation of scales is hard to bridge .",
    "consequently , recent studies for the number of flavours @xmath5 @xcite and @xmath14 @xcite determined bounds on the chiral condensate , but no definite value for @xmath15 could be extracted .",
    "a definite signal for chiral symmetry breaking was obtained only for @xmath16 @xcite . a very recent calculation claims that @xmath17 @xcite with the caveat of volume and discretisation artefacts .    in general , the presence of an infrared cutoff due to the finite volume reduces the value of the critical number of flavours .",
    "this has been demonstrated by gusynin and reenders in a simple truncation scheme for the dses @xcite .",
    "they considered an approximation to the dse for the fermion self - energy which neglects corrections to the fermion wave - function and the fermion - photon vertex .",
    "the photon is then given by its leading behaviour in the @xmath18 expansion . in this work we elaborate on these findings by considering a more sophisticated truncation scheme which explicitly takes into account non - perturbative effects in all of these quantities .",
    "in addition we follow a different strategy to assess the volume effects by evaluating the system on a three - torus to determine finite volume effects in the quark and gluon propagators @xcite ] .",
    "this work is organised as follows . in section [ sec2 ]",
    "we recall results for qed@xmath4 in the infinite volume / continuum limit .",
    "we present the dyson - schwinger equations for the fermion and photon propagators and discuss their asymptotic properties .",
    "in section [ sec3 ] we recall general conditions for chiral symmetry breaking on a finite volume , formulate the dses in a box and discuss our numerical methods to solve these . in section [ sec4 ]",
    "we present our numerical results for the propagators at finite volume and the critical number of flavours @xmath0 as a function of the box size . in section [ sec5 ] we conclude .",
    "we consider @xmath1 with a four - component spinor representation for the dirac algebra and @xmath19 fermions .",
    "this allows a definition of chiral symmetry similar to the cases of @xmath20 and @xmath21 . with massless fermions ,",
    "the lagrangian has a @xmath22 `` chiral '' symmetry , which is broken to @xmath23 if the fermions become massive .",
    "the order parameter for this symmetry breaking is the chiral condensate which can be determined _",

    "the gauge dependence of the fermion mass and wave function and , correspondingly , the fermion - photon vertex has been a much debated issue in the past , see _ e.g. _ @xcite and references therein .",
    "there in particular the technical question of how to truncate the fermion - photon interaction to obtain a gauge covariant pattern of chiral symmetry breaking and restoration has been discussed .",

    "this is why we prefer landau gauge in this work .",
    "a range of anstze for the fermion - photon vertex have been investigated in @xcite .",
    "there it has been found that the critical number of flavours @xmath0 obtained with the most elaborate construction , obeying the ward - takahashi identity , is almost similar to the one of the most simple ansatz , a bare renormalised vertex @xmath46 therefore to keep matters as simple as possible we will only present results for the bare vertex approximation in this work .",
    "we did check , however , that more sophisticated anstze do not alter the main conclusions presented below .",

    "note , however , that the effects of varying @xmath55 are quantitatively small in general ; all qualitative conclusions derived in @xcite and also here are independent of the choice of @xmath55 .",
    "an often used approximation to determine the asymptotic behaviour of the fermion and photon dressing functions has been the @xmath18-expansion .",
    "this expansion is equivalent to a perturbative expansion for small @xmath39 while keeping @xmath56 fixed . as @xmath1 is an asymptotically free theory",
    "this expansion does provide correct answers in the ultraviolet .",
    "for the photon polarisation and the vector dressing function of the fermion one finds for @xmath19 massless fermion flavours @xcite @xmath57 for the mass function of the fermion one can use the operator product expansion to obtain @xmath58 with the chiral condensate @xmath59 .",
    "note that the condensate can also be determined from the trace of the fermion propagator : @xmath60    in the infrared momentum region the @xmath18-expansion is clearly not sufficient .",
    "here one has to resort to a self - consistent analysis of the dses in terms of asymptotic power - laws .",

    "such an analysis is valid if no scales are present , _",
    "i.e. _ in the deep infrared momentum region @xmath62 and only in the absence of fermion masses .",
    "the appearance of infrared power laws with potentially fractional anomalous dimensions is thus an indicative and characteristic property of the symmetric phase of qed@xmath4 .    for a bare fermion - photon vertex",

    "( [ lindiv ] ) . since the difference between ( [ kappa_sub ] ) and ( [ kappa_wosub ] ) is rather small in the interesting region above @xmath5 and therefore unimportant for all of the conclusions of the present work we resort to the simple subtraction scheme ( [ lindiv ] ) and consequently reproduce ( [ kappa_sub ] ) in our numerics .",
    "the critical number of flavours @xmath0 where chiral symmetry is restored can be determined analytically from the dse for the scalar fermion dressing function @xmath35 .",
    "again we refer the reader for details to ref .",
    "@xcite and merely state the result @xmath68 the corresponding result from the functional renormalisation group is @xmath69 @xcite in agreement with our result for the unsubtracted equation .",
    "numerical results for ward - identity improved vertices lead to results in the range of @xmath70 @xcite .",
    "these numbers can be contrasted with @xmath71 from the @xmath18-expansion @xcite .",
    "note that all these results are far above @xmath5 relevant for the description of high-@xmath6 cuprate superconductors as discussed in the introduction .",
    "finally we wish to emphasise that these power law solutions can only be obtained when the full structure of the propagator dses is taken into account .",
    "the authors of refs .",
    "@xcite did not find a solution corresponding to a symmetric phase in their truncation scheme because the feedback from the function @xmath72 onto the vacuum polarisation is not taken into account .",
    "this then prohibits the appearance of power laws and therefore does not allow for the appearance of the chirally symmetric phase and should be discarded @xcite .",
    "before we embark on our investigation , let us recall the general finite volume behaviour of the chiral condensate @xcite .",
    "the fermion propagator in its spectral representation is given by @xmath73 where @xmath74 and @xmath75 are eigenfunctions and eigenvalues of the euclidean dirac operator , @xmath76 .",
    "the gauge field @xmath72 is treated as an external field .",
    "these eigenfunctions occur either as zero modes or in pairs of opposite eigenvalues . setting @xmath77 , integrating over x and neglecting the zero mode contributions , one obtains @xmath78 the chiral condensate can be deduced by averaging the left hand side of this equation over all gauge field configurations and then taking the infinite volume limit to give @xmath79 where @xmath80 is the mean level density of the spectrum , which becomes dense in the infinite volume limit . in the chiral limit , @xmath81 ,",
    "only the infrared part of the spectrum contributes and one finally arrives at the banks - casher relation @xcite @xmath82 if the two limits are interchanged , _",
    "i.e. _ if one takes the chiral limit before the infinite volume limit , one has a discrete sum in eq .",
    "( [ eq2 ] ) and the infrared part of the spectrum can not trigger a non - vanishing chiral condensate : chiral symmetry is restored .",
    "if , however , at a given volume the explicit fermion mass @xmath41 is not too small , one can still observe the spontaneous formation of a quark condensate .",
    "if the factor @xmath83 varies only slightly with @xmath84 , the sum in eq .",
    "( [ eq2 ] ) can still be replaced by an integral and eq .",
    "( [ banks - casher ] ) remains valid .",
    "for this to be a legitimate approximation one needs @xmath85 , at the lower end of the spectrum .",
    "thus one obtains the condition @xcite @xmath86 this relation reveals the crux of the matter . in principle , if the volume is large enough , the necessary quark masses are academically small and may even be neglected in the numerical treatment .",
    "what counts as _ large _ in this context , however , depends sensitively on the size of the chiral condensate . in qed@xmath4",
    "the condensate becomes extremely small already well below the critical number of flavours @xmath0 of the chiral phase transition @xcite .",
    "thus although a formulation on a finite volume may do well for @xmath87 , all signals of dynamical chiral symmetry breaking will be lost already well below the @xmath0 of the theory in the infinite volume / continuum limit .",
    "this behaviour will be quantified below .      on a compact manifold",
    ", the photon and fermion fields have to obey appropriate boundary conditions in the time direction .",
    "these have to be periodic for the photon fields and antiperiodic for the fermions . for computational reasons",
    "it is highly advantageous , though not necessary , to choose the same conditions in the spatial directions .",
    "we choose the box to be of equal length in all directions , @xmath88 , and denote the corresponding volume @xmath89 . together with the boundary conditions this leads to discretised momenta in momentum space .",
    "thus all momentum integrals appearing in the dyson - schwinger equations are replaced by sums over matsubara modes .    on a torus with antiperiodic boundary conditions for the fermion fields , the momentum integral changes into a sum of matsubara modes , @xmath90 counting momenta @xmath91 , where @xmath92 are cartesian unit vectors in euclidean momentum space . for the photon with periodic boundary conditions the momentum counting goes like @xmath93 . for the numerical treatment of the equations it is convenient to rearrange these summations such that they represent a spherical coordinate system @xcite , see fig .",
    "[ fig : latt ] for an illustration .",
    "we then write @xmath94 where @xmath95 counts spheres with @xmath96 , and @xmath41 numbers the grid points on a given sphere .",
    "the corresponding momentum vectors are denoted @xmath97 and their absolute values are given by @xmath98 .",

    "part of these effects are removed by our choice of ` cutting the edges ' of the torus , described in the previous section .",
    "the remaining finite size effects can be evaluated by varying the size of the cutoff . here , a natural minimal cutoff is given by the intrinsic scale @xmath12 of qed@xmath4 .",
    "thus , working in the range @xmath104 , we anticipate that finite size effects are of minor importance for cutoffs larger than the intrinsic scale , _",

    "here we use @xmath113 . note that for the photon the box volume is related to the lowest momentum point by @xmath89 with @xmath114 .",
    "the same box length then results in a slightly different value for the lowest momentum point in the photon dressing function .",
    "we refrain from showing the photon explicitly here , since the finite size effects are similar to the ones for the fermions .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : uv ] the finite size effects are visible only for the smallest cutoff .",
    "there are effects in both the infrared and ultraviolet momentum regions , where a number of momentum points deviate from the results with larger cutoffs .",
    "this is true for the renormalisation point dependent fermion wave function , normalised such that they match the continuum results , but also for the renormalisation point independent fermion mass function .",
    "the perhaps surprising observation that the variation of an ultraviolet cutoff also affects the infrared behaviour of the dressing functions implies a certain entanglement between the infrared and ultraviolet modes of a gauge theory .",
    "similar effects have been found in four dimensional yang - mills theory , see _",
    "e.g. _ @xcite and references therein .",
    "we also need to comment on the fact that we observe dynamical chiral symmetry breaking in our system at all , despite in practice working with a vanishing bare quark mass . in the continuum formulation",
    "this entails working in the chiral limit .",
    "however , due to the formal reasons discussed in section [ sec : chiral ] this can not be true on a finite volume , since taking the chiral limit before the infinite volume limit inevitably leads to the loss of dynamical chiral symmetry breaking .",
    "however , this is not what we observe here .",
    "indeed , the volumes we use are large enough to allow for extremely small bare fermion masses according to the relation of eq .",
    "( [ torusrelation ] ) . in practice , this allows one to neglect the fermion mass entirely in the numerical treatment of the dses .",
    "however it is important to keep in mind that this means we are working _ close _ to the chiral limit , but not _ in _ the chiral limit .",
    "we conclude this subsection with the observation that from about @xmath115 onwards almost no finite size effects are present .",
    "we therefore consider this value a lower bound for admissible cutoffs on a torus , in agreement with our general considerations concerning the natural scale in qed@xmath4 .",
    "this finding also agrees with corresponding results on finite size effects in lattice simulations , see @xcite and refs . therein . in order to be absolutely sure that cutoff effects do not play any role in what follows we use the somewhat larger cutoff @xmath116 from now on .",

    "we keep the ultraviolet cutoff of our system fixed and vary the infrared cutoff in the range of @xmath117 .",
    "we show the resulting behaviour of the fermion mass and wave function as well as the photon together with the corresponding continuum results in fig .  [",
    "fig : ir ] .",
    "again , we choose @xmath16 .",
    "the variation of the volume clearly results in the loss of a substantial amount of generated fermion mass when the volume gets smaller and smaller .",
    "for even smaller volumes than shown in the figure chiral symmetry is restored in agreement with the condition @xmath118 discussed in the subsections [ sec : chiral ] and [ res : uv ] . on the other hand",
    ", we observe that extremely large volumes are needed to account for the full effect of dynamical chiral symmetry breaking observed in the infinite volume / continuum limit .",
    "this is in marked contrast with the behaviour of the quark sector of qcd@xmath61 @xcite and can be explained by a closer look at the scales involved . whereas in qcd@xmath61",
    "the generated quark masses ( @xmath119 ) are of the same order as the intrinsic scale of the system ( @xmath120 ) , the situation is clearly different in qed@xmath4 . here",
    "our characteristic scale is of the order @xmath121 , whereas the generated fermion masses are of order @xmath122 , as can be seen from the plot . to keep volume effects small",
    ", this scale has to be well accommodated by the system on a box , which translates to a lowest momentum to be much smaller than @xmath123 .",

    "this is true for all three dressing functions , the fermion mass function @xmath106 , the fermion wave function @xmath107 and the photon self energy @xmath32 .",
    "let us now examine the influence of finite volume effects on the critical value @xmath0 , where the system undergoes a phase transition from the chirally broken into the chirally symmetric phase .",

    "the function @xmath125 is zero for @xmath139 and equal to the analytic result of eq .",
    "( [ crit ] ) in the symmetric phase above @xmath0 . for a given finite volume",
    "the phase transition is still indicated by a maximum in @xmath125 .",
    "however , there is an additional region at @xmath140 , where the function rises slowly towards its maximal value .",
    "this region is generated by the finite infrared cutoff of the system in a box , which prevents the fermion wave function @xmath107 from bending towards a finite asymptotic value at @xmath141 .",
    "this effect mimics a power law at values of @xmath19 where the system is still in the chirally broken phase . with increasing volume",
    "this region gets smaller and smaller until it reaches the sharp rise of the function in the infinite volume / continuum limit as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : zf ] .    as a result",
    "we find a critical number of flavours which depends upon the volume of the torus .",
    "the explicit values are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : massive ] together with corresponding results from ref .  @xcite . in the following we concentrate on the solutions close to the chiral limit and postpone the discussion of the ( orange ) curve with large bare fermion mass to the next subsection .    for volumes that are not too large , our solutions and the ones reported in ref .",
    "@xcite can be well fitted by a form @xmath142 for our results we obtain @xmath143 and @xmath144 , shown as dashed line in the plot .",
    "interestingly , to high precision the exponent of the box length in this fit is given by @xmath145 , although we do not have a good explanation for exactly this behaviour . in terms of @xmath146",
    "the fit then suggests a linear extrapolation to the infinite volume limit .",
    "however , it turns out that this linear behaviour breaks down for extremely large volumes .",
    "this is evident for the results from gusynin and reenders @xcite .",
    "the deviation from the linear behaviour is quantitatively important : for the truncation of gusynin and reenders a linear extrapolation to the infinite volume results in @xmath147 as compared to the infinite volume result @xmath148 .",
    "( note that the curve gets extremely steep for the very largest volumes , which are not plotted . ) for our results we find a value of @xmath149 for the linear extrapolation , whereas the analytical infinite volume result is @xmath150 . though this difference is not huge",
    ", it highlights the need for non - linear extrapolation procedures to the infinite volume limit . unfortunately our largest volumes are not yet large enough to penetrate this region of nonlinearity .      in this subsection",
    "we investigate the consequences of explicit bare fermion masses @xmath151 in the lagrangian of qed@xmath4 on the chiral phase transition . to this end",
    "we first determined the properties of the system in the infinite volume / continuum limit by solving the corresponding dses for a range of different bare fermion masses . for",
    "any given mass and varying @xmath19 we find that the fermion wave function never develops a pure power law in the infrared . instead there is a region @xmath152 , where the function is constant and a region @xmath153 where a power law is present .",
    "the scale @xmath154 depends on the explicit fermion mass as well as on the number of flavours .",
    "we conclude from this that away from the chiral limit the infrared exponent @xmath65 is no longer an order parameter . as concerns the global behaviour of @xmath107 we still observe the behaviour discussed above eq .",
    "( [ fitt ] ) : at a small enough momentum @xmath155 the value of the function @xmath107 increases with @xmath19 up to a certain point at a critical value @xmath0 and decreases again if @xmath19 grows further . in the chiral limit",
    "this critical value @xmath0 marked the chiral phase transition . here , however , this seems not to be so .",
    "the fermion mass function @xmath13 decreases exponentially with @xmath19 without a trace of a rapid change around @xmath0 .",
    "we therefore conclude that there is no phase transition in the infinite volume / continuum limit for qed@xmath4 with non - vanishing bare fermion masses @xmath151 .    on a torus with a given volume , however ,",
    "the scale @xmath156 decreases with @xmath19 and can become lower than the lowest momentum point @xmath157 on the torus .",
    "consequently one then sees a pure power law in @xmath107 for momenta @xmath158 .",
    "the critical number of fermion flavours @xmath0 where this transition is observed coincides with the value of @xmath19 where @xmath159 is maximal .",
    "thus in a sense one observes a chiral transition on a torus even for non - vanishing @xmath151 when there is none in the infinite volume continuum limit . for the choice @xmath160 the resulting values of @xmath0",
    "are plotted against @xmath161 in fig .  [",
    "fig : massive ] .",
    "apart from our smallest volumes the resulting values of @xmath0 are significantly larger than in the ` chiral ' limit .",
    "we also observe that in the infinite volume limit the critical number of flavours goes to infinity , in agreement with our findings discussed in the previous paragraph .",
    "away from the chiral limit qed@xmath4 on a torus shows a chiral phase transition when there is none in the infinite volume / continuum limit .",
    "this implies that extreme care is needed when one attempts to extract information on @xmath0 from lattice calculations with finite fermion masses .",
    "nevertheless it is interesting to compare to lattice results . as explained above the important scale in assessing finite volume effects",
    "is the lowest momentum point available on the torus compared with the generated fermion mass . in our setup with antiperiodic boundary conditions in space and time directions",
    "this scale is given by @xmath162 .",
    "on the lattice one usually implements antiperiodic boundary conditions in the temporal direction and periodic ones in the two spatial directions .",
    "this results in @xmath163 on the lattice .",
    "the couplings are related by @xmath164 , where @xmath165 is the dimensionless inverse coupling on the lattice and @xmath166 the lattice spacing . with @xmath167 and @xmath168 one then obtains @xmath169 .",
    "this means that we should compare the results of contemporary lattice calculations on @xmath170-lattices with our values for @xmath171 . from the plot of fig .",
    "[ fig : massive ] we then find chiral symmetry breaking for @xmath16 , whereas at @xmath172 the system is in the chirally symmetric phase .",
    "this is in agreement with recent lattice results @xcite and shows that these results are compatible with our value of @xmath173 in the infinite volume / continuum limit .",
    "finally we investigate the behaviour of the chiral condensate on a torus as a function of the explicit fermion mass . to this end",
    "we extract the condensate from our fermion mass function with the help of eq .",
    "( [ trace - condensate ] ) at a given fixed ultraviolet momentum cutoff .",
    "our results for @xmath172 and different box lengths @xmath174 are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : condensate15 ] . clearly , for small volumes the condensate decreases linearly with decreasing bare fermion mass @xmath151 and extrapolates to zero in the chiral limit . for large enough boxes",
    "this behaviour changes and we find a finite value in this limit in agreement with results from our continuum dses .",
    "it is interesting to note that the curves for small volumes are almost degenerate .",
    "a volume analysis in this region would therefore indicate weak finite volume effects where in fact there are large effects when the volume is increase further . again",
    ", this result should serve as a caveat for the interpretation of lattice results .",
    "in this work we investigated volume effects on the chiral phase transition of qed@xmath4 as a function of the number of flavours , @xmath19 . to this end we solved a coupled system of dyson - schwinger equations for the fermion and photon dressing functions in the infinite volume / continuum limit and on a three - torus .",
    "we worked in a truncation scheme that in the infinite volume / continuum limit reproduces a critical number of flavours @xmath175 , a number close to the one obtained with more involved approximation schemes @xcite .",
    "examining the same system on a torus we found considerable volume effects .",
    "these can be explained due to the presence of scales of vastly different magnitude in qed@xmath4 . on the one hand one",
    "has the natural scale @xmath176 , which is of order one . on the other hand ,",
    "the dynamically generated fermion masses are orders of magnitude smaller . for example",
    ", one has @xmath177 , for @xmath16 as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : ir ] . while the first scale remains of the same order , the second one rapidly decreases when the number of flavours becomes larger . when the generated fermion mass drops below the infrared cutoff of the system , given by the inverse of the box length , chiral symmetry breaking disappears and the system falls into the chirally symmetric phase .",
    "we quantified these effects and presented results for the critical number of flavours as a function of the box length .",
    "they agree qualitatively with corresponding results of  @xcite , determined in a simpler truncation scheme and a different set - up ( continuum limit with finite infrared cutoff ) .",
    "quantitative differences are small .",
    "our results confirm the notion that lattice calculations at @xmath172 or @xmath5 need very large physical volumes to see dynamical chiral symmetry breaking , let alone quantify their finite volume effects .",
    "contemporary lattice results can not yet accommodate for these and consequently find a system in the chirally symmetric phase in quantitative agreement with our findings .",
    "we have shown that these results are nicely compatible with a critical number of flavours @xmath175 in the infinite volume / continuum limit .",
