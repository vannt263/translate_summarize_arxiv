    "we then drive the system out - of - equilibrum by suddenly turning on the spin - orbit coupling and study the resulting dynamics . in section iii , we solve the boltzmann equation in the absence of interactions , and in section iv , we consider the effect of interactions on the spin dynamics .",
    "we summarize our results in section v.",
    "in the absence of spin - orbit coupling , the hamiltonian for two hyperfine states of a fermi gas can be expressed as a sum of single particle and two - body interaction terms : @xmath1 where the single particle hamiltonian is composed of a kinetic term and a potential term arising from the external trapping potential @xmath2 where @xmath3 denotes the fermionic annihilation operator for a particle in hyperfine state @xmath4 and mass @xmath5 . here",

    "as the relevant spin - orbit physics is two - dimensional , we assume a quasi - two dimensional , pancake geometry , obtained by tight confinement in the longitudinal ( @xmath10 ) direction ( @xmath11 ) . for simplicity",
    ", we assume that both the atomic states experience identical trapping potentials , but all our calculations can be readily extended to include more general trapping potentials realized in experiments .    at the ultra - cold temperatures realized in these experiments , the dominant contribution to scattering comes from the s - wave channel .",
    "the interaction hamiltonian therefore takes the simple form of a contact interaction : @xmath12 with interaction strength @xmath13 where @xmath14 denotes the s - wave scattering length . a key advantage of the fermonic experiments @xcite is the ability to use magnetic fields to tune the interactions between different internal states , via a feshbach resonance @xcite .",
    "here we work in the weakly interacting regime , which can be realized by working near the zero crossing of the feshbach resonance .",
    "the spin - orbit hamiltonian containing terms linear in momentum takes the form : @xmath15 where the first term is the rashba contribution and the second term is the dresselhaus contribution , parametrized by the coupling constants @xmath16 and @xmath17 respectively . here",
    "@xmath18 and @xmath19 denote pauli matrices .    in the ultra - cold gas",
    "setting , spin - orbit coupling is generated by using a pair of raman beams to drive transitions between two hyperfine states of an atom , while simultaneously imparting a momentum kick @xcite .",
    "the resulting spin - orbit hamiltonian takes the rashba equal dresshelhaus form @xmath20 , where the magnitude of @xmath16 is determined by the wave - length of the raman beams and the angle at which they intersect .",

    "scattering modifies the iso - energy contours in phase space : spin @xmath89 atoms experience a mean - field proportional to the density of the @xmath90 atoms and vice versa .",
    "more importantly , due to the exchange interaction , when two atoms collide , they precess about the common axis of their total spin . as argued by lhuillier and lalo ,",
    "it is this effect that gives rise to spin waves in the collisionless gas @xcite . in the experiments of du _",
    "@xcite , the initial state was polarized along the @xmath180direction , and spin dynamics was the result of the negligible difference in the trapping potentials experienced by the spin @xmath89 and @xmath90 atoms .",
    "consequently the amplitude of the resulting spin wave was very small , @xmath181 @xcite .",
    "by contrast in the present case the initial state is polarized along @xmath10 .",
    "absent spin - orbit coupling , this state has _ no _ dynamics as it is stationary with respect to the zeeman field and the interaction term .",
    "spin - orbit coupling however causes the spins to precess about the @xmath91 plane with a precession rate proportional to the momentum . over time",
    ", atoms with different momenta precess at different rates and can collide with one another .",
    "the atomic collisions subsequently lead to a dynamical spin segregation in real space @xcite . unlike the experiments of du _",
    "_ , the initial spin precession in our system occurs due to spin - orbit coupling , which is not a small effect .",
    "consequently the amplitude of the resulting spin wave is also larger than what was found in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "we remark that the amplitude of the total magnetization oscillations , and the associated spin texture in real space , depends non - monotonically on the strength of the zeeman field . for @xmath182 , and weak interactions @xmath183 ,",
    "the magnetization oscillations are only slightly larger than those studied in sec iii a , and the real space magnetization density resembles the spin helix shown in fig .",
    "[ intfiga ] ( top right ) .",
    "the magnetization oscillations reach a maximum at some @xmath184 , which depends on @xmath178 and @xmath173 . upon further increase of @xmath172 , the spin @xmath89 state becomes stable and there is no spin dynamics .",
    "in summary , we studied the spin dynamics in a weakly interacting , non - degenerate fermi gas following a sudden ramp of the spin - orbit coupling strength . in the absence of interactions and a zeeman field , we produced analytic expressions for the total magnetization and the magnetization density for arbitrary values of the spin - orbit coupling , trap frequency and the temperature .",
    "we argued that a fully polarized initial state will give rise to a spin helix on a timescale set by the trapping period with a wave - length that depends on the ratio of the spin - orbit interaction to the trap frequency .",
    "for the high temperature gas , we generalized the analytic results obtained by stanescu _",
    "_ @xcite to arbitrary spin - orbit coupling strength .",
    "we then numerically studied the spin dynamics in the presence of interactions and a zeeman field , highlighting the role played both separately and collectively by these terms . for weak zeeman fields",
    "the spin helix is preserved but it disappears for very large zeeman fields , as the fully polarized initial state becomes increasingly stable . in the presence of interactions",
    "however the dynamics is more complicated .",
    "interactions tend to _ enhance _ the amplitude of the spin oscillations .",
    "we explain this effect as a dynamical spin segregation driven by exchange .",
    "finally , we briefly comment on the role of fermi statistics in our calculations . in principle , all the results discussed in this paper apply equally well to bosons .",
    "the spin helix discussed in sec iii is a single - particle effect , and should also occur in a bosonic system .",
    "importantly , it is a _ dynamical _ effect and should be contrasted with the spin stripe phase predicted by ho and zhang , which occurs in equilibrium spin - orbit coupled bose - einstein condensates @xcite .    to conclude",
    ", our work shows that a seemingly one - particle term in the hamiltonian ( i.e. spin - orbit coupling ) , when coupled with coherent non - equilibrium dynamics of the fermi gas , could manifest rather non - obvious and complex ( and more importantly , observable ) behavior in cold atoms and molecules even at relatively high temperature where the quantum degeneracy of the system is not of any key importance . the dynamical physics we predict here is unlikely to manifest itself in any solid state systems ( and",
    "can only be seen in atomic gases ) although the basic concept of spin - orbit coupling originates in solids as discussed in detail in refs .",
