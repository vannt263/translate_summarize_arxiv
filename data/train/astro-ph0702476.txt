    "it was presented that quark matter may exist in the universe  @xcite .",
    "the existence is now supposed to be inside the core of neutron stars or inferred to be bare quark stars , where several observational signals have been suggested  @xcite .",
    "much attention has also been paid to explore the relevant astrophysical phenomena in such sites  @xcite .",
    "related to the newer observation of psr j0751 + 1807 , skyrmion stars have been proposed to explain the large mass ( @xmath2 ) of a compact object  @xcite .",
    "it has been presented that the quark matter might appear during supernova explosions  @xcite or the transition of a neutron star to a quark star  @xcite .",
    "current supernova studies demonstrate that the stellar collapse of stars below @xmath3 in the main sequence stage leads to the formation of neutron stars , while in the case of more massive stars , to the formation of the black hole @xcite . in the latter case",
    ", quark matters might appear because the central density could exceed the density of the qcd phase transition .",
    "it is worth mentioning here that supernova models with the phase transition are important because the vast release of the gravitational energy at the transition could be responsible for some classes of long - duration gamma - ray bursts @xcite . in this connection",
    ", another energy source has been recently proposed as _",
    "quark nova _ @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that the uncertainty of the equation of state ( eos ) is always a big problem in the research of core - collapse supernovae with the phase transition .",
    "we might study such microphysical phenomena in the core of the star directly from the detections of the gravitational waves .",
    "currently , the gravitational astronomy is now becoming a reality .",
    "in fact , the ground - based laser interferometers such as tama300 @xcite and the first ligo @xcite are beginning to take data at sensitivities where astrophysical events are predicted . for the detectors including geo600 and virgo , core - collapse supernovae especially in our galaxy ,",
    "have been supposed to be the most plausible sources of gravitational waves ( see reviews , for example , @xcite ) .    so far , there has been extensive work devoted to studying gravitational radiation in the context of rotational @xcite and magnetorotational @xcite core collapse supernovae .",
    "on the other hand , there are a very few simulations concerning the effects of the phase transition on the gravitational signals .",
    "lin and his collaborators recently presented a three - dimensional simulation with the use of the polytropic equation of state in baryonic phase and mit bag model in quark phase .",
    "they investigated how the delayed collapse of a rapidly rotating neutron star induced by the phase transition long after its formation , could produce the gravitational waveforms  @xcite .",
    "they demonstrated that the waveforms can be characterized by the damping timescale of the core and the induced core oscillation frequency .",
    "furthermore , they pointed that the energy release in the form of the gravitational radiation owing to the transition could be less than @xmath4 of the gravitational binding energy .    in the present paper , we also pay attention to the effects of the phase transition on the gravitational waveforms , not at the epoch considered above , but at the moment of core - bounce during the gravitational collapse of the massive stars . for this purpose",
    ", we perform the two - dimensional magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) simulations of the supernova cores accompanying the phase transition . to treat the qcd phase transition ,",
    "we employ a mit bag model .",
    "we construct the initial models by changing the strength of rotation and magnetic fields , and the degree of differential rotation parametrically .",
    "we also vary the hardness of eos in the baryonic phase in a parametric manner . in this paper",
    ", we investigate the relation between the phase transition and the change in the gravitational signals systematically .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we outline the numerical methods , input physics , the initial models , and the numerical methods for the gravitational waveforms . in sec .",
    "iii , we present numerical results .",
    "iv is devoted to the conclusion .",
    "the numerical method for mhd computations employed in this paper is based on the zeus-2d code @xcite , ( see @xcite for details of the application to the core - collapse simulations ) . in the following equations ,",
    "geometric units are used , @xmath5 .",
    "the basic mhd equations are written as follows , @xmath6 here , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 , and @xmath10 , are the density , pressure , velocity , internal energy density , magnetic field , gravitational potential , and the lagrangian derivative , respectively .",
    "in addition to the previous version @xcite , we newly take into account the general relativistic correction to the newtonian gravity because it affects the waveform of the gravitational wave at the moment of the phase transition and the subsequent contraction of the core .",
    "the effective potential @xmath11 in eq .",
    "( [ eom ] ) includes the correction @xcite , which is defined to be @xmath12 where @xmath13 here , @xmath14 is the gravitational potential which is constructed using the tolman - oppenheimer - volkoff equation .",
    "@xmath15 is the spherical newtonian gravitational potential .",
    "albeit simple , this method has been demonstrated to reproduce well the results of the general relativistic calculations  @xcite .      to describe the qcd phase transition in the supernova cores ,",
    "we follow the method adopted in ref .",
    "the transition to a hadronic phase is modeled by adding the mit bag constant @xmath16 to the energy density .",
    "this phenomenological term lowers the pressure of the quark phase , where a transition to a confined phase occurs .",
    "the eos in the quark phase is written as : @xmath17n_b^{4/3}+b , \\label{ro } \\\\",

    "we get : @xmath22 we assume that the first order phase transition occurs during the collapse beyond some critical density , which has been supported by a recent study about the quark - gluon plasma  @xcite .",
    "we set the qcd coupling constant @xmath23 in most models , which indicates that the coexistence phase between the baryon and quark is the widest in the density region .",
    "this choice helps us evaluate the effects of the phase transition maximally  @xcite . in the baryon phase",
    ", we adopt the phenomenological eos of bck  @xcite that includes two parameters of the incompressibility @xmath24 and the adiabatic index @xmath25 to express the degree of the hardness of matter above @xmath26 .",
    "the eos of bck is parametrized as follows , @xmath27 .",

    "two parameters of @xmath24 and @xmath25 are shown in table [ tab : pt ] .",
    "we note that recent measurements give the constraints on the incompressibility : @xmath34 mev @xcite .",
    "therefore the adopted value of @xmath35 mev is consistent with this measurement .",
    "we furthermore take into account the parameter of @xmath36 mev , which would correspond to an extreme value .",
    "we add the pressures of electrons and photons to the eos of bck  @xcite .",
    "since we focus on the behaviour of the eos above @xmath29 , we use the phenomenological eos of ref .",
    "@xcite below @xmath29 in all models .    as for the criterion of the phase transition",
    ", we impose the gibbs condition with respect to the pressure and chemical potential to bridge the baryon and quark phase .",
    "we assume that the transition starts at @xmath37  g  @xmath38 for the baryon phase in most models , whose value lies between those adopted by gentile et al  @xcite .",
    "then , the end point of the transition ( @xmath39 ) and @xmath16 are determined analytically from the condition of @xmath40 , @xmath41 , and @xmath23 or @xmath42 for the quark phase : @xmath39 and/or @xmath43 .",

    "as for the initial models , we changed parametrically the strength of the rotation and the magnetic fields .",
    "as for the microphysics , we adopted a phenomenological equation of state above the nuclear matter density , including two parameters to change the hardness of the matter before the transition . to treat the qcd phase transition",

    ", we found that the phase transition makes the maximum amplitudes smaller up to @xmath0 10 percents , when the iron core rotates strongly differentially .",
    "it was confirmed that the strong magnetic fields themselves decrease the maximum amplitudes by less than 8% regardless of the transition .",
    "even the extremely strong magnetic fields @xmath1 g in the protoneutron star do not affect the above features .    finally , we give some discussions and speculations based on the obtained results .",
    "we assume rather low density for the onset of the phase transition in comparison with a recently predicted eos by the lattice qcd computations @xcite .",
    "thus the results here could be some extreme cases predicted by the phenomenological mit bag model , and the change in the amplitudes due to the transition could be interpreted as an upper bound .",
    "although the other initial presupernova models may change our analysis to some extent , the qualitative results obtained here will not be different so much .",
    "this is because the structure of the iron core is similar , while the initial mass of the helium core increases with the progenitor masses @xcite . for the presupernova model of @xmath44 that has the iron core of 1.9@xmath45",
    ", we have found that gwa at the bounce is only about 3 percents larger than that of 13@xmath46 .",
    "since we concentrate on the forms of the gravitational wave just after the bounce , the difference in the helium core mass should not be important at all .",
    "if we could calculate the hydrodynamical evolution long after the core bounce especially in some failed core - collapse supernova models , we would observe the phase - transition of the protoneutron stars .",
    "we also think interesting to investigate the possible effects of color - superconductivity recently proposed @xcite . as a next step",
